RETHINKING THE BECAN CERAMIC SEQUENCE-DISJUNCTIONS, 
CONTINUITIES, SEGMENTATION, AND CHRONOLOGY 

Joseph W. Ball 
One of the benchmark ceramic chronologies for the Central Maya Lowlands-that of Becan, Campeche-was critically flawed
in its inception. ltsflaws resulted from a perceived need to parallel the established Uaxactun bellwether and a failure to recognize that the typological and modal content of the sequence of assemblages defined was not continuous but disjunctive in character. In fact, this sequence reflected a broken continuum of discrete segments separated by a major break representing an actual occupational and historical gap in the site history of Becan. This paper reexamines the premises of the original Becan sequence, reassesses its structure and chronology, and offers a new alternative for its replacement andfuturefield­testing. Reassessments of individual types and groups and their relationships and established chronologies, joined with a 
fresh consideration of Bejuco-phase depositional circumstances and stratigraphies, suggest that the political failure of Becan and the consequent abandonment of the center may have occurred as early as A.D. 730-750. The resulting gap in the occupational and ceramic sequences of the site lasted into the early ninth century. The suggested changes have significant ramifications not only for the chronologies of the site and the surrounding Rio Bee region, but also for their cultural, archi­tectural, and political histories. 
Una de las crono/og(as ceramicas fundacionales para las tierras bajas mayas centrales-la de Becan, Campeche-sufrio graves defectos en su inicio. Estos resultaron de una necesidad percibida de imitar la secuencia arquet{pica de Uaxactun y de unafalta de reconocimiento de que el contenido tipologico y modal de la secuencia de ensambles ceramicos definidos no era continua sino disyuntivo en caracter. De hecho, es ta secuencia refleja una serie discontinua de segmentos discretos separados por una ruptura importante. Esta ruptura represento no solo una disyuncion tipologica, sino un verdadero vado ocupacional e historico en la historia de! sitio de Becan. Este trabajo reexamina las premisas de la secuencia original de Becan, reevalua su estructura y cronolog{a y ofrece una nueva alternativa para su sustitucion y futuras pruebas en el campo . Reconsideraciones de los tipos y grupos individuales, sus interrelaciones y sus cronologfas establecidas, unidas a un nuevo examen de las cir­cunstancias y estratigrajlas deposicionales de lafase Bejuco, sugieren que elfracaso polftico de Becan y el consiguiente aban­dono del centro pudieron haber ocurrido tan pronto coma el 730-750 d.C. El resultante vado en la secuencia ocupacional, y por lo tanto en la secuencia ceramica de! sitio, duro hasta principios del siglo nueve. Los cambios propuestos tienen ramifi­caciones importantes no solo para la cronologfa del sitio y sus alrededores, la regionRfo Bee, sino tambien para sus desarrollos culturales e historias arquitectonicas y polfticas. 
Fir more than 40 years, the ceramic sequence 
eveloped for Becan, Campeche, Mexico 
(Ball l 973a, 1974, 1977) has served as a rel­ative and absolute comparative chronological stan­dard on which multiple local and regional sequences throughout the Yucatan peninsula north of Guatemala have been grounded (e.g., Arnauld et al. 2010 [Rfo Bee]; Balanzario 2011 [Kohunlich]; Delgado 2002 [El Tigre ]; Dominguez 1994 [Calak:­mul]; Dzul and Taladoire 2010 [Rfo Bee region]; Forsyth 1983 [Edzna]; Johnstone 2001 [Yaxuna]; Naida 2004 [Kohunlich]; Robles 1990 [Coba]; Varela 1998 [Oxkintok]; Witschey 1993 [Muyil]). Research programs at sites from southwestern Campeche (El Tigre) to northeastern Quintana Roo ( Coba) have relied on the Becan sequence routinely for this purpose. Together with Robert E. Smith's (1971) monograph on the pottery of Mayapan and George W. Brainerd's (1958) foundational survey, it has served a role in the literature of the Central and Northern Maya Lowlands that is broadly anal­ogous to that of the Uaxactun sequence (Smith 1955; Smith and Gifford 1966)-upon which it itself was based-in the Southern zone.

it has been used to frame examinations and inter­pretations of Maya settlement patterning, architec­ture, and political history from early Middle Preclassic through Terminal Classic times through­out southern Campeche, most especially in the Rfo Bee architectural region (e.g. , Bueno 1987, 1999; Carrasco 1989; Dzul and Taladoire 2010; Gendrop 1983; Jimenez et al. 2006; Nondecteo 2003; Nondedeo and Dzul 20 10; Nondedeo et al. 2010; 2013; Taladoire et al. 20 13; Thomas 1981; Vargas and Delgado 2003; Webster 1976). 
As a typology and a comparative relative chronology, with some very minor additions and tweaking to its typological inventory, it has with­stood the tests of time and multiple subsequent investigations well. The most recent syntheses of archaeology and cultural history both in the imme­diate area and farther afield on the peninsula con­tinue to rely on it unhesitatingly (Nondedeo et al. 2010, 2013; Taladoire et al. 2013). Nonetheless, recent work by the author in neighboring central­western Campeche (Ball and Taschek 2007, 2013, 2015) has occasioned a reexamination and scrutiny of the sequence, its component elements, and its stratigraphic and comparative typological under­pinnings. This has brought to light what appears to be a significant, albeit quite fixable, flaw in its basic structure. Given the continuing importance of the Becan sequence as a chronological standard for research throughout the region, it is important to call attention to the substantive and interpretive flaws in its original formulation and to present a tentative restructuring of this sequence. It is my hope that other researchers will take the proposed revisions into consideration in their own formula­tions of local and regional culture history and explicitly field-test the validity of the revised sequence in future investigations. 
A Realization, The Problem, Some Questions 
After revisiting the extensive Becan type collec­tions curated in the Ceramoteca of the Instituto Nacional de Antropologia e Historia (INAH), Centro Regional de Yucatan (CRY), Merida, and reexamining my own substantive treatments of these materials (Ball 1971, 1972, 1973a, 1977), I became convinced that the Becan ceramic sequence in fact comprises two separate, discon­tinuous segments , rather than a single continuum as originally assumed and established (Figure 1). Segment I extended as an intergrading series of wares, types, and modes from the Middle Pre­classic Acachen complex/phase through the full Late Classic Bejuco complex/phase, ending some­time in the early eighth century. Segment II begins with the ill-defined Chintok ceramic complex and continues with typological and modal additions into and through the Xcocom complex , until end­ing sometime in the late eleventh century. There is a significant disjunction between the two seg­ments, which I now believe reflects a real break or gap in the sequence for an undefined length of time in the middle and late eighth century, possibly extending into the early ninth. Manifestly, the temporal , and so cultural and historical , segrega­tion of the two ceramic , and thus occupational, segments has important potential ramifications for the associated settlement, architectural , and broad sociopolitical histories of the greater Becan and Rfo Bee zones. 
The principal questions engendering this reex­amination of the established Becan sequence were the following: 
(1) 
What, in fact,constituted the complete, true Chintok ceramic assemblage at Becan? What was its full typological content and its actual character (complex , subcomplex , facet, or other)? Did it even exist as a distinct entity apart from Xcocom (see Ball and Taschek 2013, 2015)? Forty years ago, this basic question remained unresolved, but subsequent work both at Becan and throughout the surrounding Rfo Bee region has now provided some clear, concrete answers (Taladoire et al . 20 13; Supplemental Table 1) . 

(2) 
Granting the existence of Chintok as a com­plete, stand-alone complex, when did it actually appear? Its dating was determined 40 years ago based largely on only two identifiable types securely associated with the assemblage-Palmar Orange-polychrome and Zacate! Cream­polychrome-and a handful of highly questionable radiocarbon determinations on architectural lintel beams (Ball 1977:186-187; Andrews IV and Andrews V 1980:281-285), coupled with the implicit presumption that Chintok developed out of and followed directly from Bejuco. At the time, no other solid presence or absence criteria could be brought to bear on the question . In defining the related -in actuality, parent-Rfo Bee regional

complex, Makan ("rural Chintok"), Sara Dzul and her colleagues pushed the developmental begin­nings of that assemblage back to ca. A .D. 700 (Dzul and Taladoire 2010:Cuadro 2, 132), with a facet change aroundA.D. 790 (Taladoire et al. 2013:357­358). It is now evident that Chintok simply repre­sents one site-specific aspect of a larger regional ceramic sphere, Makan. So, does the dating of the latter (A.D. 700-850) also apply to its expression at Becan? 
(3) 
How long did the Late Classic Bejuco assemblage/phase actually persist? When did it terminate? In this case, comparative typological evidence for the inception and early decades of Bejuco was strong and well tied into established Peten sequences, but after roughly A.D. 700/720, a significant decrease in dateable exotics (see Sup­plemental Table 1) made the question of duration uncertain, and I opted to assume replacement of the assemblage by a Tepeu 2-equivalent successor by A.D. 730-750. Forty years later, better dating of some east-west traveling ceramic wares and types and a reappraisal of the limited Tepeu 2­horizon polychromes recovered from some mixed Bejuco-Chintok deposits allow for a fresh assess­ment. Combined with some very limited credible radiocarbon dating and the incorporation of depo­sitional information not previously brought into play, an early eighth-century termination for the Bejuco ceramic assemblage now appears even more probable than it was 40 years ago . 

(
4) Are the very real typological and modal disjunctions between the Bejuco and Chintok/Xcocom assemblages (Figure 2; Supple­mental Tables 1 and 2; Supplemental Figure 1) indicative of an actual gap between the end of Bejuco and the appearance of Chintok ceramics at Becan? If so, how long did this hiatus last? 


Based on a fresh review of the original data, together with the enormous volume of additional research conducted over the last 40 years, I will attempt to address some of these questions. Others must await further focused investigations and additional data. 
"Chintok" -The Heart of the Problem 
Much of the overall problem stems from the weak original definition and establishment basis of the Chintok ceramic complex, a circumstance that four decades of extensive subsequent field and lab work have failed to improve (Campana et al. 2000, 2001, 2004; Dzul and Taladoire 2010; Nondedeo and Dzul 2010). The "Chintok com­plex" was and remains the most poorly defined or documented ceramic complex at Becan (Ball 1977:133-134; Dzul and Taladoire 2010: 126). Its original definition and dating were tenuously based on mixed core deposits in constructions 
overlying and underlying depositional contexts dating to the very well-defined and heavily rep­resented Bejuco Tepeu and Xcocom assemblages, and on what types and modes were not present, rather than on those that were present. In retro­spect, its existence and definition owed as much to early 1970s conventional dogma regarding the "necessary" existence of a traditional Tepeu 1, 2, 3 sequence at sites linked to the Peten as to archae­ological realities. Two strongly opinionated research directors -E. Wyllys Andrews IV and Richard E.W. Adams-also played roles in the need to "find" a Tepeu 2 horizon complex at Becan. I have reexamined Chintok and its prede­cessor (Bejuco) and successor (Xcocom) assem­blages with special attention to the securely dateable polychromes and exotic pottery defi­nitely associated with each. I have also reviewed the depositional circumstances and distributions of the two as represented in the 1969-1971 National Geographic Society (NGS)-Tulane Uni­versity and 1973 NGS-University of Wisconsin, Madison, projects , and the more recent (1999­2004) INAH program directed by Arque6logaLuz Evelia Campana. My conclusions from this review are at considerable variance with those reached in the early 1970s . 
The factored distinction of Chintok from Xco­com may well have been more arbitrary than real (see Ball and Taschek 2013, 2015) and very likely reflects differential access circumstances among the overall Terminal Classic (Xcocom) popula­tion, rather than purely temporal factors alone. More important has been recognition that the pre­sumed continuity between the successive Bejuco and Chintok assemblages was far more an artifact of assumptions and expectations in the late 1960s regarding the historical structure of ceramic sequences at major lowland Maya centers than it was an analytical or cultural reality. What truly characterizes the types, groups , wares, and modes

Peten, the two most critical and best represented being Palmar Orange-polychrome (Figure 3a; Ball 1977:76; Figure 28e; 28 sherds) and Zacate! Cream-polychrome (Figure 3b; Ball 1977:78; 9 sherds). Reexamination of the curated material at the INAH CRY Ceramoteca in 2011 revealed that all retained Chintok "Palmar" and "Zacatel" sherds in fact belong to the Danta and Joyac vari­eties of those respective types, both identified by Robert E. Smith (1955; Smith and Gifford 1966: 173) as constituents of the Terminal Classic Tepeu 3 ceramic complex at Uaxacttin. Smith and Gifford (1966: 157, 158) classified this material as two separate types and a group distinct from the Tepeu 2 Palmar and Zacatel variants, but Smith (personal communication, 1978) subsequently indicated that this decision was made by Gifford in what he, himself, felt was an overly rigid appli­cation of the then very new type-variety system rules of taxonomy. At issue was not the classifi­cation of the pottery, but its naming, and this was a point on which Gifford was adamant and Smith did not see any compelling reason for argument. Smith did footnote (Smith and Gifford 1966: 17 1­173) a hint of his discomfort with the potential taxonomic segregation of what were not such very different units at the level of the ceramic group, but the issue was not elaborated on in what was intended only as a provisional taxonomic key or 
index to the previously published monograph on Uaxacttin ceramics (Smith 1955). 
In his final classification of the comparable Late and Terminal Classic polychromes from Tikal, T. Patrick Culbert (1993:10-12) assigned both the Tepeu 3-horizon Eznab material and the Tepeu 2-equivalent Imix examples to the Palmar and Zacate! types of the Palmar group. Classifying and describing the Bec:in material in 1970-1972, I, like Culbert, saw the published Palmar and Zacate! types as providing the best matches to my own sherds, and, believing that I was dealing with a full Late Classic Tepeu 2-equivalent assemblage, I classified them as such, thereby concomitantly forcing the dating of Chintok into the Tepeu 2 horizon. Returning to this material after four decades of work with Maya polychrome sherds and vessels and the nuances of type-variety sys­tematics, I would still, like Culbert, classify the Becan material as Palmar Orange-polychrome and Zacate! Cream-polychrome, but of the Tepeu 3 Danta and Joyac varieties, respectively.1 
As for the two other apparent Tepeu 2 minority types associated with Chintok deposits, (Yuhactal Black-on-red, 1 sherd; undesignated red-slipped, gouged-incised, 1 sherd), I would today reassign these to Bejuco based on their recovery from heav­ily mixed core deposits and on my original obser­vation of Chintok: "No pure middens [deposits]

were encountered; all surface material was badly eroded and mixed with Xcocom pottery; structural fill derivatives were scanty and mixed with prob­able Bejuco sherds" (Ball 1977: 161). I would additionally note, however, that at Tikal, Culbert (1993: 11) found Yuhactal Black-on-red to be pre­sent in both the Tepeu 2-equivalent Imix and the Tepeu 3-equivalent Eznab complexes, so the issue may be moot for the solitary occurrence at Becfo. Gouged-incised redwares are, of course, far more typical of the Tepeu 3 than the Tepeu 2 horizon. 
The indisputable presence of the Tepeu 3-hori­zon types Tinaja Red and Achote Black as clear constituents of Chintok and of Xcocom, based on multiple occurrences in architectural core fill, was somewhat contradictorily taken to represent a pre­venient local occurrence of these wares, even while noting their distinctiveness from and lack of any clear relationships to the Bejuco redware and blackware types, Corona Red and Molino Black (Ball 1977:21-23, 34-36, 134). True Achote Black pottery, including a number of the several elaborate decorative variant types of the ceramic group, now appears to have emerged as a diagnostic component of the regional Makan assemblage by early in the eighth century (Tal­adoire et al. 2013:Table 2). Rather than taking this as support for assigning Chintok to a pre-Tepeu 3 position, however, I see it as evidence for estab­lishing the local origins and developmental history of Achote group pottery. Given the group's known archaeological and chronological distributions, I believe it quite conceivable that this popular blackware spread outward in all directions from a Rfo Bee zone of origin in the early decades of the Terminal Classic era, including southward into the north-central Peten. This well fits the historical distribution of the ware and also accords neatly with Nondedeo's (Arnauld and Nondedeo 2010; Nondedeo et al. 2010) suggested spread of cultural influences and stimuli originating in the Rfo Bee zone during precisely this interval. 
Although based on Chintok (Arnauld et al. 2010; Dzul and Taladoire 2010; Taladoire et al. 2013), Dzul's equivalent Rfo Bee regional com­plex, Makan, does not equate with or even parallel Chintok in its own developmental history and chronology. It is marked by clear derivatives and influences from the south and east in its con­stituent redwares, blackwares, and vessel forms, and it likely spread across southern Campeche and into the greater Becan hinterland well before its appearance as the Chintok assemblage around and at the abandoned center. Today, I would argue that "Chintok," as I defined it for Becan, is nothing other than a derivative member of Dzul's more robust full Makan complex and sphere. Dzul has fixed the first appearance ofTinaja Red in Makan at ca. A.D. 790/800 (Taladoire et al. 2013:Table 2),recognizing two temporal varieties of the type, Nanzal Variety (A.D. 790-850) and Tinaja Variety 
(A.D. 850-900/950). The curated Chintok exam­ples from Becan are classifiable only to the type level, but this would still make them chronolog­ically indicative of a date no earlier than the start of the ninth century, once more placing the com­plex on the Terminal rather than Late Classic hori­zon. All identifiable Xcocom sherds are definitively of the Tinaja Variety. 
The comparative typological diagnostics used to establish the broad relative and narrower absolute chronology of the Chintok assemblage either were improperly classified and evaluated or-less likely-represented Bejuco assemblage contaminants in mixed deposits. Reconsideration of these aspects of the assemblage supports realignment of Chintok on the full Tepeu 3 horizon and indicates a far shorter independent history than originally proposed. On these criteria, I would reset its inception at Becan from ca. A.D. 730/750 to around A.D. 810/830 or even later. 
As to the duration of the Chintok ceramic phase, this remains difficult to determine on the available data, but the new exotic groups and types and new local wares mimicking "northern" ones that join together with persisting Chintok wares to define the Xcocom complex could have been present by as early as A.D. 800/810 and are likely to have been well established by no later than 
A.D. 860/880 (Ball 1977; Ball and Taschek 2013, 2015). This would leave only a very short span for Chintok-realistically no more than 40 to 60 years-a possibility that accords far better with the overall archaeological record than do the orig­inal formulations of 40 years ago (Ball 1973a, 1977). 
In sum , although intergrading significantly with Xcocom (Supplemental Tables 1 and 2), the Becfo Chintok assemblage does represent a func­tionally complete, full ceramic complex. It was a

member of a larger Makan ceramic sphere found at sites throughout the Rio Bee architectural region within which the latter emerged and evolved over the eighth century. At and around Becan, Chintok was compositionally little differ­ent from Xcocom, if we exclude the multiple exotics and finewares that define the "early" and "late" facets or "a" and "b" subcomplexes of the later complex (Supplemental Tables 1 and 2; see Ball 1986:400-402; Ball and Taschek 2013, 2015). Its most salient distinguishing elements are those few polychrome exotics from the Peten that also serve to reset its local , site-specific chronology to A.D. 810/830 and after. 
The Bejuco Complex 
The Bejuco complex remains today essentially as originally defined, with a few minor additions by later investigators , but the radical realignment of the succeeding Chintok-Xcocom ceramic con­tinuum to after A.D. 830 demands a reexamina­tion of its own true duration, estimated in the early 1970s at ca. A.D . 620/630 to around 730­
750. As noted, the comparative typological evi­dence for the inception and early decades of Bejuco is strong and well tied into established Peten and southwestern lowland sequences. Fix­ing the correct temporal endpoint for Bejuco, however, is not so easy a task. There are few late Tepeu 2 indicators (Palmar and Zacate! appear in trace amounts), but then there is little strong evi­dence of interaction between Becan and the Peten after the Sabucan ceramic phase (ca. A.D. 450­630). My 2011 reexamination in Merida of the handful of securely (stratigraphically) associated Palmar and Zacate! polychrome varieties from the Bejuco complex confirmed that they are good, full Tepeu 2 ceramics -but from when within that production phase? Applying the Uaxacttin and Tikal ranges for the types alone allows their occurrence as early as A.D. 690-710 to as late as 
A.D. 825-845, and that is for true Tepeu 2 Imix varieties alone . Incontestably identified varieties of the Palmar type from pure Bejuco deposits are all of the established Resist and Huisquil varieties that have been securely dated at Altar de Sacri­ficios to before A .D. 770 , with the Resist Variety placed in the Early Pasion complex of A.D. 610­695 (Adams 1971). 
Although a substantial number of site reports and new sequences have been published for south­ern Campeche , Quintana Roo, the northern Peten , and northern Belize over the last 25 years (e.g. , Balanzario 2011; Delgado 2002; Dominguez 1994; Forsyth 1983; Naida 2004; Robles 1990; Varela 1998; Witschey 1993), so many of these have relied either directly or indirectly on the Becan sequence for their own temporal frames that applying their datings of these types and wares to Becan becomes perilously circular. The few conclusive new datings of chronologically still "loose" but potentially later Bejuco indicators that have been obtained since the 1970s have served only to affirm a full seventh-century posi­tioning for these wares, rather than to extend their duration. Such is the case, for example, of three beautiful Chimbote Variety Chimbote Cream­polychrome bowls and a Petkanche Variety Petkanche Orange-polychrome vase from a well­dated tomb (Burial 39) at El Peru-Waka' (Rich 2011 :311-312, Figures 7.40, 7.41, 7.47-7 .51). Moro Orange-polychrome, another important Bejuco type with an extensive geographic distri­bution , has been demonstrated to date to no later than A.D. 650 at Piedras Negras , in its likely zone of production (Holley 1983; Munoz 2004). At Altun Ha, extensive refuse and special deposits containing multiple examples of the important Bejuco exotics Petkanche Orange-polychrome and Egoista Resist, independently dated by asso­ciated radiocarbon and typological cross-dating, securely placed these types within a span of A.D. 650-7 50 (Pendergast 1979). All of the foregoing, and other Bejuco exotics such as Azcorra Buff­polychrome , also dated to ca. A.D. 550-650 at N aachtun, Pe ten (Walker and Reese-Taylor 2012), and Xbanil Light Brown-polychrome, are far more widely reported today than they were in the 1970s (e.g. , Eppich 2000; Fry 1983, 1987 [north­ern Belize, southern Quintana Roo]; Forsyth 1983 [central-western Campeche]; Robles 1990 [north­eastern Quintana Roo]; Walker and Reese-Taylor 2012 [northern Peten]). Nonetheless, most still largely depend for their absolute chronology on their original Becan dating. 
One possible, albeit perhaps tenuous, line of argument that might at least provide a reasonable terminus ante quern for the end of the Bejuco ceramic phase and associated occupation is the

reciprocal presence and absence of two fine paste potteries of the Late to Terminal Classic period: Fine Buff, or Orange-Buff, and Fine Gray. I deem the approach tenuous because the archaeological patterns involved could owe their existence to sys­temic distributional factors other than chronology. 
The Fine Paste-Wares 
Together with the multiple groups of Fine Orange Paste-Ware , Fine Buff and Fine Gray are recog­nized as important commercial products of the Mexican Gulf coast and proximate riverine inte­riors from along a band extending from southern Veracruz, through Tabasco and Chiapas, to west­ern Campeche (Bishop 2003; Bishop et al. 2006; Bishop and Foias 2013; Bishop and Rands 1982; Foias and Bishop 2005; Forne et al. 2010, 2011; Jimenez et al. 2006; Rands et al. 1982). Tempo­rally, the fine paste-wares span the full Late Clas­sic and Terminal Classic through Protohistoric eras, but the peak of their popularity and distrib­ution occurred in the later Late Classic and Ter­minal Classic. The distribution of Fine Orange pottery during this interval was virtually pan-low­land, varying somewhat regionally by period (Bishop 2003; Forsyth 2005). Fine Gray is found throughout the southwestern lowlands of Tabasco, Chiapas, and far western Campeche, with a bifur­cate distribution of which one arm extends up the Usumacinta and Pasion Rivers and into the south­ern Peten, and the other extends up the west coast of the peninsula to the northern plains and to sites along the east coast (Bishop and Foias 2013; Foias and Bishop 2013a). There is a trace occurrence of Late Classic Fine Gray in northwestern Belize (Kosakowsky et al. 2013) . 
Chemically and stylistically defined subsets (groups) of both Fine Orange and Fine Gray have been successfully associated with specific produc­tion source areas and temporal intervals and have been used effectively to document and map a num­ber of interaction patterns (Bishop et al. 2008; Bishop and Foias 2013; Demarest2013; Foias and Bishop 2005, 2013b; Forne et al . 2010; Forsyth 2005; Rands et al. 1982). Fine Gray has been sep­arated into two macrogroups, Chablekal and Tres Naciones, associated, respectively, with the full Late into Terminal Classic timespan and with a fully Terminal Classic dating (Bishop and Foias 2013; Bishop and Rands 1982; Foias 2013a). 
Fundamentally, Chablekal group pottery was a product of the greater Palenque region, the sur­rounding coastal plain of Tabasco and western Campeche, and the lower and middle U sumacinta drainage. While its chronology in the northern Lowlands and along some parts of the Usumacinta might appear from the general literature to be as yet unfixed (see Foias 2013a; Foias and Bishop 2005), the time of its appearance in its source zone has been well established as being no earlier than the middle eighth century, ca. A.D. 750/760 (Bishop and Foias 2013; Foias 2013a; Foias and Bishop 2005). At Aguateca, Dos Pilas, Cancuen, and in the broad environs of the upper U sumac in ta and Pasion drainages, the ware has been securely established to have appeared no earlier than A.D. 760 and to have peaked in importance during the following decades (Bishop and Foias 2013; Demarest 2013; Foias 2013a; Foias and Bishop 2013b; Forne et al. 2010, 2011).Achronologically corroborative late Late Classic occurrence has been reported for northwestern Belize (Kosakowsky et al 2013). 
From along the coast of Campeche and across the northern plains, reported datings of Fine Gray are largely impressionistic and wide-ranging, spanning the decades from the early seventh century -impossible given the chronology of the ware in its area of origination -to the late ninth century and even later (e.g., Ball 1978; Forsyth 1983; Jimenez et al. 2006; Robles 1990; Smith 1970; Varela 1998). In the case of Dzibilchaltun, however-the sole northern plains site at which Chablekal Group Fine Gray is richly and abun­dantly represented in a variety of solid strati­graphic and contextual situations (Andrews IV and Andrews V 1980)-Michael P. Simmons (1980; Andrews V 1981) was able to securely date the time of arrival and importance of the ware to the very late eighth into the early ninth century, independently duplicating and supporting the southern evidence for its spread. A radiocarbon­supported ceramic sequence established by Fer­nando Robles for Isla Cerritos also put the arrival of Chablekal Fine Gray there at some time after 
A.D. 750 (Andrews et al. 1988). Forsyth (1983) assigns the ware to the Muralla complex at Edzna, cross-dated to ca. A.D. 750/800-900/950. 
Fine Buff or Orange-buff Paste-Ware pottery has been found at sites along the southern Gulf

coast, from southern Veracruz to northern Campeche, well up the Usumacinta River, and on the northern Yucatan coastal plain, as well as at a scattering of interior central low lands sites, including Becan (Ball 1977, 1978; Bishop et al. 2006; Jimenez 2009; Jimenez et al. 2006; Pina Chan 1968; Ruz 1969; Smith 1970). Its chronol­ogy has yet to be satisfactorily documented, or even systematically explored. Jimenez Alvarez (2009; Jimenez et al. 2006) has implied a sev­enth-to middle eighth-century date, but has also suggested a duration well into the Terminal Clas­sic , as did Robert Smith (1970). Depending on the source, its duration has been given as extend­ing from ca. A.D. 590 to either sometime around 
A.D. 750 or well into the ninth century. By the latter, it would have been moving contemporane­ously with Fine Gray via the same networks linked to the Gulf coast. At Becan, Fine Buff pottery (Dzitbalche Orange-buff and Xlatun Incised types) is present only as part of the Bejuco assem­blage. Although speculatively assigned to a hypo­thetical late aspect of the complex, its precise temporal placement was never determined. Plainly, systematic documentation of its chronol­ogy remains sorely needed. Here , the importance of the ware is that its presence as a common com­ponent of the Bejuco assemblage establishes the fact of recurrent, stable interactions between Becan and the fine paste-ware distribution net­works of the Tabasco-Yucatan coastal zone during at least some part of the pre-Terminal Classic sev­enth-through eighth-century period. These were the same systems through which first Chablekal and then Tres Naciones Gray would have moved during the later Late Classic and Terminal Classic periods. 

The distribution patterns of all of the fine paste potteries are extensive, but those of each individ­ual group do differ considerably and are often exclusive of each other. The mechanisms involved in their movements clearly were varied. Nonethe­less, group-by-group vessel form repertoires, quantitative abundance, and overall recovery con­texts tend to controvert their likely roles as high­status or otherwise socially significant currencies for gifting or formal exchanges, as was the case for so much of the polychrome-painted ceramic fineware produced by the Late Classic Maya. Instead, a role as high-value , but not necessarily high-status, quotidian commercial exotica seems more appropriate to these wares-a role not unlike that of obsidian. 
At Becan, the full Terminal Classic Xcocom complex counts both Fine Gray and a good array of Fine Orange types among its components . These were recovered by both the NGS and INAH efforts at the site (Supplemental Table 1; personal observation , 2011). In the 1970s , the specific ceramics involved were visually, rather than chemically, identified as members of the Chablekal and not the Tres Naciones ceramic group , but their Xcocom association is conclusive and their presence does document a Terminal Classic-era (ninth century or later) connection with the Gulf coastal interaction network , what­ever their proper taxonomy.2 This is reaffirmed by the strong Fine Orange (Balancan and Altar groups) representation (Supplemental Tables 1 and 2). As noted, Fine Buff pottery is present only as part of the Bejuco complex. 
All substantiated temporal ascriptions for the spread of Fine Gray Paste-Ware pottery out of its coastal plain homeland and across the Maya Low­lands put this event/process at no earlier than A.D. 
760. Had Fine Gray ceramics reached Becan, they could have done so no earlier than this. The absence of the ware from Bejuco-phase Becan does have a number of possible economic and political explanations, but one very plausible one is that by the time of its widespread trafficking and availability, Becan no longer existed as a viable political and economic center. Given the presence at Becan of seventh-to eighth-century Fine Buff trade ceramics known to have been cir­culating via the same general coast-and-river routes as Late Classic Fine Gray, I would argue this to have been the case. By the time that Fine Gray became a major exotic commodity in wide­spread demand, the great transpeninsular cross­roads had ceased to function as such and lay moribund, if not actually abandoned.3 
The presence of Fine Orange-buff as a common constituent ofBejuco, combined with the absence of Fine Gray from the complex, suggests that Bejuco no longer existed as a functional assem­blage by A.D. 760 .At the same time, I would still radically reset the appearance of Chintok at Becan from ca. A .D . 730-7 50 to around 810/830 , or even later. When I originally undertook my reexami-
