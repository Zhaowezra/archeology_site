The process of childhood has increasingly attracted the attention of archaeologists, with a focus on the learning of adult identities and the social construction and fluid categories of age divisions. An important new book, The Social Experience of Childhood in Ancient Mesoamer­ica, edited by Traci Ardren and Scott Hutson, contributes to archaeological research on children. Despite the great temporal and spatial range of the chapters, the editors perform the impressive task of keeping the authors focused, although as with any edited volume, the con­tributors vary in their commitment to the volume's goals. 
Syntheses by Traci Ardren and Rosemary Joyce use­fully frame and contextualize the volume. Ardren refers to her introduction as "setting the table," and the imagery is apt, as she skillfully lays out the volume's concepts and goals, with contributors bringing differ­ent specialties to the table. Ardren critiques the lack of attention paid to childhood and the Western construc­tion of walls between childhood and adulthood. As childhood is socially constructed, she favors local def­initions of childhood created through age categories; Ardren cites three discrete phases of approximately four years each. An interesting facet of Ardren's intro­duction, ignored by most contributors, is her call for scholars to employ greater reflexivity and self-reflection based on their experiences raising children. While Ardren sees children as innovators, experimenters, and repositories of sacred knowledge, at least one author­
B yron Hamann-sees more sinister powers wielded by Colonial era murderous children. Considering how influential her work has been to many of the volume contributors, it is appropriate that Joyce clears the table. She does an excellent job teasing out the commonali­ties of the chapters, focusing on the agency of young people and their role in reproducing society, rather than simply identifying them as a category. 
Three chapters comprise the second part of the vol­
ume, "Defining the Child," and bring to the table archae­
ological (primarily mortuary) data, the bones from 
which interpretations are constructed. Geoffrey and 
Sharisse McCafferty usefully note that finding mortu­
ary remains is evidence of childhood interrupted­
allowing archaeologists to understand their social roles. 
Using three categories that differ from those of other 
contributors (infants, less than a year; children, up to 13 years; and juveniles, up to 21 years), the McCaffer­tys explore differences in burial location, grave goods and burial position at Postclassic Cholula, noting that a possible cemetery near the Great Pyramid contains few children, while many of the burials in an excavated house are children. Individuals increasingly received grave goods and standard burial positions as they moved through childhood, supporting the authors' contention that children were progressively indoctrinated into the gender roles of adulthood. Rebecca Storey and Patri­cia McAnany emphasize that mortuary treatment reflects adult valuation of individual children as well as communal ideas about commemoration. Maya bur­ial data from Late Formative K'axob feature a major­ity of child interments as secondary burials, with 85 percent of all juveniles buried inside structures, inter­preted as showing their death was the primary concern of household members. Based on these data, the authors support their hypothesis that mortuary treatment reflects both demographic realities about a child's death and the importance of children in family and society. Rissa Tra­chman and Fred Valdez Jr. assert the active participa­tion of children in the negotiation of their experience through play. The authors highlight the problematic nature of assuming continuity between sixteenth­century northern Yucatan ethnohistoric sources in both time and space. They extend relatively small burial data from Dos Hombres, Belize to an overview of Lowland Maya mortuary practices; they find continuity in the placing of gender symbols on children, especially shell pendants with females. 
The three chapters that constitute Part III, "Child­hood in Practice," bring substantial theory-laden meat to the table. Initially it seems that Scott Hutson arrives at the table with an empty plate, as his Chunchucmil, Yucatan, research features a lack of child-related arti­facts. Hutson compensates with a rich theoretical reflec­tion on how to isolate specific actors from an archaeological record to which everyone in society con­tributed. Using a relational model, Hutson explores children not as independent subjects but as intercon­nected nodes in larger networks, defined through their interaction with other members of society and built environments. Supported by incongruous collections of objects, Hutson focuses on abandoned houses, where he tentatively links play with resistance to adult con­structions of childhood. In contrast, Jeanne Lopiparo focuses on material objects, especially figurines, as she examines how childhood was constructed and per­formed through social practices marking life-cycle events, as well as participation in everyday and ritual activities. Lopiparo links the creation of figurines and molds at Uhia Valley sites, Honduras, with the recre­ation of specific household identity. She sees children

as active agents through their peripheral participation in the domestic organization of craft production and their ritual and domestic uses of household products, which inscribed meanings about social roles and prac­tices. Lopiparo's artifact illustrations are of the highest quality, and should serve as an inspiration to scholars who publish figurines. Stacie King also focuses on fig­urines, exploring Postclassic assemblages and mortu­ary ritual from Rfo Viejo, coastal Oaxaca. While King links figurines with ritual action involving people of all ages, she uses a small sample of burials to establish that different neighborhoods varied in their mortuary rites. Age-related social identity appears to be a primary dis­tinction in early Postclassic burials, with children not buried within the house, suggesting they were not con­sidered full family or community members, while fig­urines show they were still connected to adults. 
The three chapters in Part IV, "Sacrifice, Violence and the Sanctity of Children," offer a variety of deserts and spices, which will appeal to different palates. While concerned with the Colonial era, Byron Hamann focuses on the extreme agency of murderous children and child martyrs. Children, especially boys, became instruments of the Franciscans' conversion efforts, caus­ing intergenerational conflict. Hamann establishes the children's privileged access to the divine; this power was understood by children, who asserted their age­based agency through various actions, including the killing of native priests. An interesting comparison pro­vided by Hamann is that both sixteenth-century Euro­peans and Mesoamericans attributed a holiness to children that dissipates as a child ages. The sacred nature of children is echoed in the chapter on their rit­ual sacrifices in the great temples of Tenochtitlan and Tlatelolco by Juan Alberto Roman Berrelleza and Ximena Chavez Balderas. They trace the purity of chil­dren with a communion with the sacred that begins as a fetus ensouled with tonalli. Children were especially valued sacrificed in rituals involving rain and maize. Sophisticated analyses of teeth and bones reveal most sacrifices were males, which the authors note is appro­priate as they were sacrificed to male deities, for whom the children were seen as living representations. 
After lamenting the lack of attention paid to Olmec children, Billie Follensbee's conclusions essentially mirror those of the scholars she critiques: children 
served as sacrificial victims (Matthew Stirling) as well as heirs/elites (Ignacio Bernal). She incorrectly assumes bodily fat indicates children; scholars interpret earlier fat figurines from Soconusco as important elders. Fol­lensbee focuses on identifying women in Olmec mon­umental art, re-sexing several well-known Olmec sculptures. While her focus on Olmec sex and gender is welcome, I have reservations about her specific inter­pretations. Follensbee is one of the only scholars to refer to Olmec sculpture as "blocky," failing to cite the expert on naturalism and the human form in Olmec sculpture, the late Beatriz de la Fuente. She also conflates sex and gender, and reduces gender to binary male and female : categories. Assuming only Classical and Western artists denoted powerful men with well-modeled pectoral mus­cles, for Follensbee any shaping of the che't signals female. Because of the supposed blocky nature of Olmec stone sculpture, Follensbee turns to "more nat­uralistic" ceramic figurines to determine sex-specific body shape and associated gendered costume clements. A basic problem is her sample: she conflates figurines from San Lorenzo, La Venta and Tres Zapotes, homog­enizing 900 years of stylistic diversity from a vast region. It is also problematic to assume that stylistic canons employed for small ceramic figurines would be the same for monumental sculpture. The failure of sculpture to conform to the anatomy found on figurines is evident in her attempt to rechristen Cruz de! Milagro Monument 1 as the "Princess." This sculpture lacks the pinched waist and flaring hips of her female figurines. and while her coarse drawing suggests the presence of breasts, a comparison with the photograph from which she based her tracing reveals she has overemphasized the shading on the chest-subtle pectoral muscles become breasts in her Fig. I 0.13. Her chapter, however. remains very useful and will undoubtedly engender numerous debates and inspire additional research on Olmec sex and gender. 
This volume will be of great interest to Mesoamer­icanists and will inspire them to further include chil­dren in their research. While this volume will undoubtedly play an influential role in the expanding literature on the archaeology of children, other direc­tions are possible as well. Perhaps as the authors age, they will focus on an additional neglected category-­gerontological archaeology.
