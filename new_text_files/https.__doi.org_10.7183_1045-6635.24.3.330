OASES, CHILE: A RADIOCARBON CHRONOLOGY 
BASED ON HUMAN SKELETAL REMAINS 

Christina Torres-Rouff and Mark Hubbe 
The San Pedro de Atacama oases have been permanently occupied since ca. 2500 B.P. and over this time developed a rich culture that was intertwined with social developments in the south-central Andes. However, despite decades of archaeo­logical research, the region still lacks a strong chronological framework based on absolute dates. Here we present 53 new AMS 14C dates from osteological remains from San Pedro de Atacama, in order to contribute to an understanding of the Atacamefio cultural sequence. These dates suggest that some cemeteries were occupied for long periods.frequently tran­scending cultural phases, and that in fact a number of cemeteries within the same ayllu were in use concurrently. We also show that, not surprisingly, population displacement through time primarily follows oscillations in the sources of water. The new information presented here suggests that future work in the region should emphasize detailed analyses that con­sider intra-ayllu variability, given that diversity within periods is masked by the uniform use of cultural phases to describe human development. 
Los oasis de San Pedro de Atacama han sido ocupados permanentemente por casi 2,500 afios, periodo durante el cual se desarrollo una elaborada cultura que se entrelazo directamente con los acontecimientos sociales ocurridos en los Andes sur­centrales. Sin embargo, a pesar de decadas de investigaciones arqueologicas, la region aiin carece de un marco cronologico solido basado en fechas absolutas. Presentamos aquf 53 nuevas fechas de C14 AMS obtenidas a partir de restos osteologicos provenientes de diferentes cementerios precolombinos de San Pedro de Atacama, con el fin de contribuir a la comprension de la secuencia cultural atacamefia. Estas fechas sugieren que algunos cementerios fueron ocupados por largos perfodos que a menudo trascendieron las fases culturales y que, de hecho, multiples cementerios estuvieron en uso simultdneamente al inte­rior de cada ayllu, mostrdndonos que posiblemente existieron ciertas diferencias sociales que dictaron el uso de los diferentes espacios sagrados. Tambien concluimos que, coma es logico en un desierto tan drido, los desplazamientos poblacionales a traves del tiempo estuvieron condicionados principalmente por las oscilaciones en las fuentes de agua. Los nuevos datos que aquf presentamos plantean la necesidad de que futuras investigaciones en la region enfaticen la variabilidad dentro de los ayllus, dado que la diversidad existente dentro de los perfodos tiende a quedar enmascarada bajo el uso uniforme de las fases culturales como marco para describir el desarrollo humano.

encompass the various phases of occupation in the oases and river valleys of the region, particularly in the cluster of oases known today as San Pedro de Atacama. 
Given the abundance of well-preserved archae­ological remains and longstanding research, sev­eral scholars have attempted to define and understand the local chronology, initially through ceramic typology (e.g., Le Paige 1972/1973) and seriation (e.g., Tarrag6 1968, 1989), and subse­quently with thermoluminescence dating (e.g., Berenguer et al. 1988). In the late 1980s, only six radiocarbon dates were available for the area. How­ever, new dates have appeared at a slow but steady pace over recent decades (Costa 1988; Costa and

Despite the fact that the south-central Andes' sweeping chronology fits the general occupational pattern of the Atacama oases, only a few researchers have focused on local developments or considered the variable pattern of human occupations of the local ayllus, the traditional form of Andean com­munity organization (Cock 1981). The ayllu has both broad (community) and narrow (family) meanings (e.g., Isbell 1977). In most cases, it is a socially constructed grouping that speaks to kin­ship and reciprocity. As such, burial practices are frequently tied to ayllu membership and can serve as a structuring principle for analyses of prehistoric occupations. In San Pedro de Atacama, the ayllus are historically conceived of as the separate oases (including some that are geographically contigu­ous), each of which is a political grouping with kin affiliations (Figure 1). 
Studies focused on chronology and settlement patterns have tended to center on technological advances and symbolic traditions in ceramics. Not surprisingly, archaeologists have relied on changes in technique and iconography to define cultural phases, beginning with some of the earliest research in the area (Le Paige 1964, 1972/1973; Orellana 1963). In some cases, ceramic seriation has been verified by absolute dating (Berenguer et al. 1988; Uribe 2002), allowing for the refinement of phase boundaries. Nevertheless, archaeologists have defined local periods without great sensitivity to the different ayllus. Finally, there are very few direct dates for the individuals buried in local ceme­teries, which make up the bulk of the archaeolog­ical record for the area. Consequently, much of the chronological context results from the correlation of funerary offerings across cemeteries. Together, these methods may have failed to accurately reflect the details of the precolumbian human occupation in the San Pedro oases. A reconsideration of the chronology should help to situate the cemeteries within the larger context of human occupation of the oases. 
Here we attempt to generate a micro-scale chronological context for the occupation of the oases through the direct radiocarbon dating of human skeletal remains. We present 53 new radio­carbon dates from 22 cemeteries, allowing us to determine an absolute context for many of San Pedro de Atacama's precolumbian cemeteries. Our approach relies on the assumption that the use of cemeteries serves as a good proxy for the occupa­tion of each of these districts, and, as such, permits discussion of the local human occupation. Given that cemeteries are ritual spaces, the patterns revealed by these new dates may not exactly par­allel the usage given to habitation sites. It is possi­ble that certain cemeteries were favored by individual ayllus and that their use reflects an extended relationship between a particular sacred space and a particular social group. Archaeologi­cal evidence from the region supports this scenario by demonstrating that habitation sites have been found in close proximity to the cemeteries included here; similarly, the few dates available from habi­tation sites also support these contentions (Llagostera and Costa 1999; Nunez 1976, 2005). 
Development of the Atacama Oases: 
The Cultural Phases 

Since the earliest human presence in the area, around 10,000 B.P., group survival was linked to the exploitation of different ecological niches through the seasonal migration of hunter-gatherer groups following large mammals (Lynch 197 5; Nunez 1995; Nunez and Santoro 2011). With the emergence of semi-permanent and permanent set­tlements in the Formative period (beginning ca. 1200 B.C.), the oases, like the neighboring river valleys, provided good conditions for maize and other cultigens. These favorable conditions also allowed for the development of stable settlements that served as stopping-off points for llama cara­vans traveling through northern Chile, southern Bolivia, and northwestern Argentina (Nunez and Santoro 2011). 
The cultural development of precolumbianAta­cameno culture, in part, reflects the relationship between the oases and their neighboring areas (Fig­ure 2; Berenguer et al. 1988; Llagostera and Costa 1999; Nunez et al. 2010; Tarrag6 1968). Locally, the Late Formative period (Toconao phase, 300 B.C.-A.D. 100,and Sequitorphase,A.D. 100-400) is associated with the first stable occupation of the oases. During this time, groups ceased to be highly mobile and began to rely on the regular exchange of material goods with neighboring and more dis­tant regions, relationships that eventually charac-
