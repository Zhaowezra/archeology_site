ECUADORIAN CINNABAR AND THE PREHISPANIC TRADE IN 
VERMILION PIGMENT: VIABLE HYPOTHESIS OR RED HERRING? 

Richard L. Burger, Kris E. Lane, and Colin A. Cooke 
Cinnabar ore is the source of a bright red pigment (mercury [II} sulfide, HGS), a substance that was highly valued in the Central Andes during prehispanic times. It is traditionally believed to come from Huancavelica in south-central Peru, although some scholars have argued that a prehispanic cinnabar source existed at Azogues near Cuenca in southern Ecuador. It has also been suggested that the cinnabar recovered at archaeological sites in northern Peru such as Battin Grande may have come from this putative Ecuadorian source. In this article, the historical and archaeological evidence supporting this position is evaluated and found to be insufficient to sustain the Ecuadorian Cinnabar Hypothesis. Moreover, recent mercury isotope analysis of archaeological samples from northern Peru supports the earlier hypothesis that the source of the bright red pigment, sometimes referred to as vermilion, was cinnabar ore mined in Huancavelica. This source is located over 850 km to the south of archaeological sites such as Battin Grande, Chongoyape, and Pacopampa. 
El cinabrio ( sulfuro de mercurio) es la fuente de un pigmento rojo conocido como bermell6n. Este material Jue altamente valo­rizado en los Andes Centrales durante el periodo prehisptinico. Aunque tradicionalmente se ha asumido que el cinabrio vino de Huancavelica, ciudad ubicada en la region sur-central del Peru, algunos investigadores han propuesto que existi6 una fuente en Azogues, cerca de Cuenca, al sur de Ecuador. Tambien se ha sugerido que el cinabrio que Jue utilizado en sitios arqueol6gicos como Battin Grande, en el norte del Peru, pudo haber sido traido de dicha fuente. En este articulo se evalua la evidencia hist6rica y arqueol6gica que sustenta esta propuesta, la cual parece ser insuficiente para sostener la hip6tesis de/ cinabrio ecuatoriano. Ademtis, las antilisis recientes de is6topos de mercurio sabre muestras arqueol6gicas def norte def Peru sustentan la hip6tesis que lafuente del pigmento bermell6n utilizado fue cinabrio obtenido en las canteras de Huancavelica, ubicadas 850 km hacia el sur.

1999). The cinnabar mined at Huancavelica during this time was used mainly for production of pure or metallic mercury that played a key role in the amalgamation of precious metals. This process, developed in Mexico in 1554, made possible the large-scale exploitation of the silver mines of Po­tosi, Bolivia. Prior to the Spanish conquest, the main purpose of the cinnabar mined at Huancavel­ica was the production of vermilion pigment for face painting and other purposes (Burger and Matos 2002; Ramos 2004). Cinnabar ore from Huancavelica continued to be used to produce bright red pigment in colonial times in order to paint wooden drinking vessels known as keros and other items (Cooke et al. 2013:4183-414, Figure 2). 
Truhan and her colleagues disseminated the hypothesis of prehispanic Ecuadorian cinnabar exploitation at Azogues before its official publi­cation in 2005, and their idea influenced Izumi Shimada in his publications on interregional in­teraction and the exchange of elite goods in the Andes (Bruhns 2003: 160; Shimada 1998:246, 2000:58). For example, in a map of prehistoric long-distance exchange, Shimada showed cinnabar as being brought to Lambayeque from Azogues; an alternative path of cinnabar acqui­sition is shown as coming from Huancavelica but a question mark is associated with this route (Shi­mada 1998:239, Mapa 2). Similarly, Peruvian ar­chaeologist Mario Ramos (2004: 171-172) dis­cussed the hypothesis of Truhan and her colleagues in a survey of cinnabar in the ancient Andes. From these citations, it is clear that the idea has become popular among specialists in Andean archaeology. 
It is not difficult to understand the attractive­ness of the Ecuadorian Cinnabar Hypothesis put forward by Truhan and her colleagues. Excava­tions by Shimada and others at Batan Grande on the north coast of Peru unearthed elaborate tombs with cinnabar pigment painted on golden burial masks (Figure 2), sometimes alongside amber, emeralds, and other exotic materials that are found only in the northern Andes of Ecuador and Colombia (Shimada 1998, 2000; Shimada et al 2004). Moreover, the putative cinnabar deposit at Azogues lies only about 440 km from the elite tombs in Batan Grande, while the famous cinnabar source in Huancavelica is approximately 850 km away (Figure 1 ). It is not unreasonable to assume that, if a rich deposit of cinnabar existed

in southern Ecuador, it probably would have been utilized by the peoples of Lambayeque and else­where in northern Peru in preference to a more distant cinnabar source to the south. 
But, as this article will demonstrate, there is little archaeological or historical evidence in sup­port of the Ecuadorian Cinnabar Hypothesis. As part of their research, Truhan and her colleagues used colonial records to relocate the mines near Azogues that supposedly produced cinnabar and also provided inspiration for the name of the town. The mining works at Azogues are now abandoned and it is not possible to enter the tun­nels and shafts that catacomb the area. When Karen Olsen Bruhns and the other scholars visited the mines near Azogues, they did not find residues of vermilion pigment or other traces of cinnabar production in this area (Truhan et al. 2005). They assumed that the evidence for cinnabar mining was buried within the now collapsed tunnels and suggested that the colonial mining had probably obliterated the evidence of prehispanic cinnabar exploitation (Truhan et al. 2005:202). They did, however, find evidence of ocher deposits, whose red color derives from the presence of hematite (anhydroxous iron [III] oxide). 
The frustrating experience by Truhan and her colleagues on their visit to Azogues is by no means new. In the late nineteenth century, Theodor Wolf, who was commissioned by the Ecuadorian gov­ernment to evaluate the mining potential of south­ern Ecuador, visited the old mine works above Azogues at the base of Cerro Huaizhun (or Guachun) and desperately searched for cinnabar ore. He found only iron oxide and some other non-mercuric but reddish materials. Everything he tested came up negative for cinnabar. This per­plexed him because he believed that the colonial diggings "could not have been for nothing." Wolf suggested that native mercury might have been extracted here since it was occasionally found by peasants in streams, but as for the early colonial mining of cinnabar ore, he found it "almost im­possible that not a single trace of cinnabar remains on the walls or in the collapsed rock within the adits." (Wolf 1879:61-62).1 
Similarly, there are no reliable reports of cinnabar pigment being discovered during mod­ern investigations at archeological sites in Ecuador. The one possible exception to this state­ment comes from the Formative site of Pirincay (Figure 1), a site where Bruhns directed excava­tions for several years (Bruhns et al. 1990; Bruhns 2003:149-156). During fieldwork, Bruhns en­countered small red nodules (pepitas) mixed with Formative refuse; the function of these pepitas is unknown. They were described as consisting of a mixture of red ocher and cinnabar, but no chem­ical analysis was conducted to confirm this iden­tification. Instead, the investigators heated the small red nodules with a match, and, when they vaporized, it was interpreted as confirming the presence of cinnabar (Truhan et al. 2005: 197). While such an observation may be suggestive, it is hardly definitive. 
A comprehensive review by Richard Burger of the archaeological literature describing prehis­panic Ecuadorian artifacts in museums and other collections has likewise failed to tum up any ref­erence to objects decorated with cinnabar pigment. Similarly, a polling of colleagues who have worked in archaeological museums in Ecuador has not produced a single confirmed instance of cinnabar on an ancient object of any kind in the region. The apparent absence of cinnabar in Ecuadorian archaeological sites and on prehis­panic objects from Ecuador in catalogs and mu­seums is in stark contrast to the situation in Peru, where examples of cinnabar use are plentiful both in archaeological sites and museum collections (Cooke et al. 2013; Ramos 2004:161-164). 
Reinterpreting the Historical Evidence 
The foundation for the Ecuadorian Cinnabar Hy­pothesis is an incorrect interpretation by Truhan and her colleagues of Spanish colonial documents regarding mining activities in the Cuenca region. The problem is that Truhan et al. (2005) are posit­ing a short "Cuencano" mercury boom from spu­rious claims. It is possible that the mining docu­ments used by Truhan and colleagues seemed compelling, given that the name of the town, Azogue[s], is a Spanish word for mercury or quicksilver. It should be kept in mind, however, that there were many false claims in the early post-conquest decades, mostly for gold and silver, but even saltpeter could draw the attention of un­ethical self-promoters. In sixteenth-century Ecuador, many people wanted to take advantage

LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 27, No. 1, 2016 
of special tax concessions offered by the Spanish crown and, even more importantly, win potential labor allotments for their fictitious "discoveries." In this case, we have the claim of Quito Corregi­dor/Gobernador Gil Ramirez Davalos, made around 1561 and transcribed by Maximina Navarro in Investigaci6n Hist6rica de la Miner{a en el Ecuador (1990:51, 54, 55). But this un­founded claim is by no means unique; there are other writers, such as Quito oidor Licenciado Salazar de Villasante (Ponce 1992:96), whose relaci6n to the crown around 1570-1571 makes extravagant claims of the mineral riches of Quito, yet without any convincing specifics. Here is the exact wording and context of Salazar on "Quito" (not specifically Cuenca) mercury: 
In this city and its outskirts there are great and many ore bodies, as there is both gold and sil­ver. There are rich mercury mines, and they send mercury from them to New Spain, the same which were discovered by Gil Ramirez Davalos, being governor of Quito, and he and another work them today.2 
Salazar goes on to say that there is also much copper, iron, rock sulfur, and galena ["alcohol," an old term for lead sulfide] in the Audiencia, or Kingdom, of Quito generally. He does not say that this is near Cuenca, but clearly that is where the allegedly rich mercury mines were supposed to be. Salazar then states that he actually went to Cuenca to visit and allot Indian laborers to gold mine operators, presumably just before this relaci6n, (i.e., late 1560s); at that time, the gold mines were profitable before the crown inter­vened to curb abuses. Significantly, Salazar does not say that he visited Ramirez Davalos's mercury mines, or that he allotted laborers to work them. Salazar goes on to say that Ramirez Davalos was still working the mines ca. 1570, but evidence, referred to below, suggests he was not. 
The misleading interpretation of cinnabar min­ing in the Audiencia of Quito in Truhan et al. (2005) is apparently traceable to Juan Chacon's misreading of Lohmann's classic 1949 study of the mines of Huancavelica. It is clear from the footnotes in Lohmann (1999:18) that royal offi­cials simply said (to paraphrase): "if the mercury mines [of Ecuador] check out and there is any leftover mercury produced, it should be sent to New Spain." This was the big "if' that was never satisfied by Ramirez Davalos, despite the fact that he had family ties in New Spain. 
The following 1562 document (Navarro 1990:51) is a request from Spain's Indies Council (using the voice of the king, "yo el rey") for proof of mercury: 
I order you to send a report, signed by secretary Ochoa de Luyando, because I want to be informed about what mercury mine this is and what has been done, and if any mercury has been extracted and if it is a fortunate find and if some benefit may follow, and it would be good to approve and confirm that mining site.3 
The document does not constitute any proof of the actual existence of a cinnabar or mercury de­posit or its successful exploitation. 
Lohmann ( 1999: 16) suggests that Ramirez Da­valos discovered the mercury mines "around 1558" but we have been unable to confirm that date based on historical documents. Chacon (1986) repeats it based solely on Lohmann's state­ment. The supposed discoverer of the cinnabar deposit, Ramirez Davalos, was involved in nu­merous gold claims around Cuenca beginning in 1557 (the year in which he founded the city) as Maximina Navarro's documents show (1990:45), but it is unclear where the 1558 discovery date for Azogues comes from. Chacon says that he found no registered mercury mine claim in Cuenca records (1986: 146). The timing is impor­tant. Large-scale (more or less) amalgamation that required mercury for its implementation had just been invented or perfected by Bartolome de Medina in Pachuca, Mexico, around 1554, and the crown issued patent-like grants soon there­after. As a result, administrators representing the Spanish crown were interested in finding mercury sources for use in New Spain (Potosi still relied on smelting at this time), but there is no evidence for any mercury being sent to Mexico or any­where else from Cuenca. 
The monopoly of the Spanish Crown on mer­cury was jealously guarded precisely during these years, and this is where Lohmann ( 1999) is most helpful. He shows that Crown officials went back and forth on licensing Ramirez Davalos and other early mining entrepreneurs on the cinnabar trail in Huamanga. But this says nothing about actual
