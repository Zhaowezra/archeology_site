It is with great pride, anticipation, and hope that the Society for American Archaeology launches this first issue of Latin American Antiquity. 
The pride obviously derives from the executive board's belief that Latin American Antiquity will be a first-class journal like American Antiquity and will contain, in the years to come, many significant contributions to the understanding of Latin America's Precolumbian past. It also springs from our pleasure in having been able to respond positively to requests from a number of Latin American and North American colleagues for a journal in English and Spanish devoted to a wide variety of topics in Latin American archaeology. 
The anticipation lies in the prospect that the new journal will not only succeed in providing an important new outlet for our members from all over the world but also will relieve some of the pressure that American Antiquity has felt over the years. We can expect that the current and future editors of the latter will not be accused-as I was when I was editor-of actually running a journal of Maya studies! We anticipate, too, that Latin American Antiquity will reach out to our many colleagues in Latin America and make them feel a closer part of our Society. If this happens, we anticipate that the perception among some that the Society for American Archaeology is really a society for North American archaeologists will begin to dissipate. 
Our hopes are pragmatic and crucial for the well-being of the Society and rest in the financial and critical success of Latin American Antiquity. The executive board hopes that the membership of the Society and library subscribers will be sufficiently impressed with the new journal to subscribe to it. If you do not yet subscribe, please seriously think about doing so and please urge any library with which you are affiliated to do the same. We hope, too, that the membership will submit their best manuscripts to the new journal, so that its quality will reach the intellectual level that Pru Rice and her board of editors trust and expect it will. 
Finally, on behalf of the executive board I would like to thank all those individuals who have helped make Latin American Antiquity a reality. We particularly wish to thank Will Andrews and his fine committee who devoted numerous hours, including sending questionnaires throughout Latin America, planning, and lobbying the board, Jerry Miller and his staff, the late John Evans, and Pru Rice, Terry Majewski, and their colleagues. 
And to Latin American Antiquity: iBuena suerte!
