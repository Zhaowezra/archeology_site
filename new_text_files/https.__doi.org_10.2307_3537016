The discovery of the tombs at Sipan was an important milestone in Latin American archaeology. When he ventured into a small police station one night in 1987, Walter Alva did not know that it would decide his future for many years to come and stimulate a number of research projects on the Peruvian north coast. There, he got his first stunned look at objects looted from a Moche royal tomb: "Many were nearly pure gold, while others were silver or gilded copper. The exquis­ite craftsmanship on some of them surpassed anything previously known to have been produced by the Moche" (p. 29). What eventually paid off was not the seemingly for­tuitous seizure of artifacts that happened to fall into "good hands," but the dedication of Alva and Susana Meneses to the preservation of the cultural patrimony. With few economic resources at their disposal, they began to salvage information from recently looted tombs, recording and protecting murals, and instructing ' police about the importance of archaeological sites. ' This book is, above all, a tribute to their perseverance and to that of their colleagues. 

The volume was written to accompany a traveling exhibition of artifacts from the site and is organized into eight chapters. The first provides a brief history of the occupation of the north coast and presents an overview of Moche culture: its modes of subsistence, economy, religion, social organization, and craft pro­duction. The introduction permits the reader to appreci­ate the complexity and the significance of Sipan's royal tombs. The next two chapters place Sipan in context 
and describe the beginning of the archaeological 
research there and its importance. For example, the 
careful study of the construction sequence has shown 
that the platform underwent at least six building phases 
during nearly a 300-year history (ca. A.D. 1-300). 
Chapters four, six, and seven are dedicated exclu­
sively to the first three tombs excavated, which are the 
focus of the exhibition. The painstaking process of 
excavation (one year for the first tomb alone) paid off, 
and almost everything that could be preserved has been 
saved. In Tomb 1, the archaeologists even managed to 
recover and reconstruct 11 beaded pectorals! These 
chapters enable one to follow the excavation of each 
tomb step-by-step and the close-up photographs and 
fine-line drawings of many artifacts provide a wealth of 
information. The construction techniques of many arti­
facts such as pectorals, ear ornaments, and necklaces 
are also described. This part of the catalog is extremely 
well designed; the illustrations and plates are superb, 
and the fold-out drawings of the tombs are helpful in 
reading the corresponding explanatory texts. 
Chapters five and eight discuss the interpretation of the tombs in relation to a Moche priestess's tomb, dis­covered at San Jose de Moro, and to Moche iconogra­phy. The authors demonstrate convincingly that the two men from Tombs 1 and 2 at Sipan and this woman were the principal actors portrayed in the most famous Moche scene known to us, the Sacrifice Ceremony. In fact, most of the clothing and paraphernalia illustrated in this scene closely match the artifacts found in the tombs. This discovery has far-reaching implications for the study of Moche iconography. We now know that the individuals represented are not merely mythological figures but real Moche dignitaries. As Alva and Donnan 
note, "Not until the excavation of Tomb 1 did we have archaeological evidence that this ceremony actually took place, with living individuals enacting the roles of the priests depicted in the art" (p. 141 ). 
The discovery, excavation, and exhibition of the Royal Tombs of Sipan has put Moche culture in the limelight and given new impetus to Moche research. Apart from the ongoing excavation at Sipan, four other

large-scale archaeological projects are underway: Donnan is studying the early development of the Moche at Dos Cabezas; Luis Jaime Castillo and Carol Mackay are investigating the transition from the Early 
Intermediate period to the Middle Horizon at San Jose de Moro and Algarrobal; a group of three Peruvian archaeologists, Regulo Franco, Cesar Galvez, and Segundo Vasquez, are discovering stunning friezes at Huaca del Cao Viejo; and three distinct projects under the supervision of Santiago Uceda are underway at Huaca de la Luna-his group is investigating the main platform, Claude Chapdelaine is studying the urban sector, and I am excavating a sacrificial site. 
Although the preface states that "the volume was 
written primarily for the non-specialist" (p. 11 ), it is a 
must for anyone interested in ancient American cul­
tures, archaeologists and nonarchaeologists alike. It is 
not just a well-written exhibition catalog but also a sig­
nificant and lasting contribution to Peruvian archaeol­
ogy. 
Pampa Grande and the Mochica Culture. IZUMI SHI­

Izumi Shimada has organized his book into two sec­
tions. First, he presents a comprehensive study of cul­
tural development during the period of Moche 
domination of the North Coast of Peru (ca. A.D. 
0---750), including the origins of Moche culture and its 
legacy. Second, he describes in detail the late Moche 
city of Pampa Grande. He uses this extensive body of 
information to address the complex historical and 
structural issues of Moche society, especially as these 
relate to the emergence ofMoche urbanism, manifested 
in its fullest form at Pampa Grande. 
Shimada's success in presenting the rapidly expand­ing Moche research inventory represents one of the major strengths of the book. Pursuing a multidiscipli­nary approach, he integrates results of recent settle­ment, land use, geomorphological, and iconographic studies. Commendably, he incorporates the impressive but often under-represented contributions of European and Peruvian scholars. Shimada also draws on his own extensive research to address the complex cultural and chronological issues of the period. The presentation of his Pampa Grande studies offers for the first time in a published format an in-depth examination of a large 
Moche settlement. In sum, the descriptive aspect of the 
book represents the most comprehensive and thorough 
synthesis of Moche archaeology available today and 
ensures that it will remain a definitive reference for 
years to come. 
Shimada does not stop at presentation of data, how­ever. He also addresses the major issues that have recently reinvigorated Moche studies. In this undertak­ing, he uses the much-publicized Sipan and San Jose de 
Moro burial excavations in the Lambayeque and 

Jequetepeque valleys, the equally significant work at 
· 
Huaca de la Luna and Huaca el Brujo in the Moche and 
Chicama valleys, and the ambitious Upper Piura pro­
gram, together with his own recent surveys, to examine 
the emergence of Pampa Grande in its broadest 
sociopolitical and ecological context. 
Unavoidably, the interpretation of archaeological 
information is more open to debate than its formal 
description. It is inevitable, therefore, that some of 
Shimada's explications of Moche history and Pampa 
Grande's significance are questionable. However, two 
of his conclusions are both innovative and persuasive. 
First, there is growing evidence that Gallinazo was not 
an earlier north coast culture, either assimilated or con­
quered by its Moche successor. Shimada documents 
several instances of Gallinazo and Moche artifacts 
recovered from the same archaeological context, a dis­
covery that confirms some much earlier findings by 
Ubbelohde-Doering at Pacatnamu. This evidence sug­
gests that Gallinazo societies persisted alongside the 
dominant Moche polities. Second, we can no longer 
regard Moche political history within a simple devel­
opmental framework of state formation and expansion 
centered in the Moche-Chicama area. The troubling 
appearance of early Moche pottery in the far northern 
Upper Piura drainage has always complicated this 
scheme, but only now are scholars coming to grips with 
its implications. 
While many scholars would now agree with Shimada that the course of Moche cultural history was much more diverse than traditionally believed, some aspects of his alternative scenario must be regarded as tenuous. He proposes the rise of two distinct states cen­tered in the Moche and Lambayeque valleys that coex­isted until the Moche IV phase. At that time, a line of settlements was established in previously unoccupied portions of the mid-valleys of the Rfos Sana, Lambayeque, and La Leche, indicating expansion of the Moche Valley polity into these areas. Shimada's new variant ofMoche political unity, although based on sound settlement data from the Lambayeque region, is confronted with a formidable problem.
