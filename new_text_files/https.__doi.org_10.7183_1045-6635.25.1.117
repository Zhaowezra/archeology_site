authors explore the environmental and social effects of anthropogenic landscape change in the LRVV by look­ing at the upper drainage of the Rfo Verde, which includes the Nochixtlan Valley of the MixtecaAlta, as well as the Valley of Oaxaca. Based on sediment samples from these regions, the authors argue that intensive farming in the Mixteca Alta, which would have impacted the Nochixtlan Valley landscape beginning in the Early For­mative, generated large volumes of sediment that were transported to the LRVV. Modem ecological conditions were established by the Late Formative, resulting in a broad floodplain, braided river, and large estuaries. While erosion led to the long-term degradation of the Mixtec landscape, it facilitated the major Late Formative demo­graphic expansion in the LRVV. 
Burial practices are used to explore broader social relationships in Chapter 4, by Barber, Joyce, Mayes, Aguilar, and Butler. Viewing burials as active elements of social groups, the authors analyze a regional data set of 156 Late-to-Terminal Formative burials. The LRVV data are unique in Oaxaca due to the emphasis on com­munal cemeteries. The burial data support changes in social group definitions through time; there was a marked change in body orientation in the Terminal Formative. In addition, clear trends expressed more overt social inequality and more inclusive community membership, as children (excluded from Late Formative communal burials) were incorporated into public cemeteries. 
Chapters 5 and 6 both consider place making. Chap­ter 5, by Joyce, Levine, and Barber, focuses on the mas­sive Terminal Formative acropolis at the regional center of Rfo Viejo. The authors calculate that 2, 126 ,44 7 per­son-days of labor were needed to construct the primar­ily earthen, 455,055-m3 structure. While they interpret the construction of the acropolis as an exercise in build­ing communitas, rather than as a coercive act, political authority was tenuous and contested, as the acropolis was burned and abandoned by A.D. 250. Chapter 6, by Bar­ber, focuses on how social changes emerged from nego­tiations between regional political authorities and local populations at two smaller sites: Yuglie and Cerro de la Virgen. Traditional communal principles, with public actions prioritizing parochial affiliations, trumped pub­lic expressions of status inequality. Repetition of acts was an important component of creating and maintaining local community identity, from burials in community cemeteries to the frequent caching of low fired ceramic cylinders, which Barber charitably refers to as looking "homemade." It is fascinating that some of the visually least appealing vessels produced in Oaxaca were con­sistently chosen for caches at Yuglie. Were they saving their best pots for feasts? 
Chapters 7 and 8 direct! y confront the ZIH. In Chap­ter 7, Workinger utilizes San Francisco de Arriba, the supposed site of Zapotec conquest, to explore the dynamics of interregional interaction when agency is taken into account. Workinger succinctly provides seven different interaction scenarios along with their projected archaeological correlates. Rejecting the ZIH's unidi­rectional view of interaction, Workinger argues for the interdependence of interacting elites via a salient iden­tity perspective. Zapotec graywares have been inter­preted by ZIH supporters as "swamping" the local ceramic assemblage, but Workinger demonstrates the scarcity of Late Formative graywares in general; although they rose in frequency during the Terminal Formative, imports from the Valley of Oaxaca declined, while contacts with the Isthmus of Tehuantepec increased. Trade in prestige goods, rather than showing domination, materialized and legitimized growing sta­tus inequalities. Chapter 8, by Levine, supports and expands on Workinger's chapter with a focus on gray­wares, primarily the type G.12. Levine challenges the idea that an increase in one pottery type necessarily manifests conquest.A careful comparison of G. l 2s from the LRVV and Valley of Oaxaca shows clear distinc­tions between them in form, decorations, and surface treatment. The LRVV graywares are as similar to those from the Isthmus or the Mixteca Alta as they are to Val­ley of Oaxaca examples. Due to a Monte Alban-centric perspective, none of these other regions have ever been suggested as major exporters of graywares. In regards to creamware sherds, often cited as reflecting Zapotec imperialism, Levine notes that only three have been reported from unmixed contexts in the LRVV. 
Figurines are explored in Chapter 9, by Hepp and Joyce. The sample of 256 figurines (including musical instruments and vessel appliques) comes from Early to 
Terminal Formative contexts at eight sites. While not par­ticularly large, tl1e sample is of high quality, with more heads than limbs. The authors successfully link their sample to larger arguments about figurines in Formative Mesoamerica, a body of literature well suited to the vol­ume's theoretical focus on social practice and social iden­tity. One intriguing aspect of the LRVV figurine sample is the presence of figurines in public spaces, not just in household refuse. The authors suggest that if both pri­vate and public contexts served as arenas for figurine use, then public activities were also carried out in domestic settings. More details on the types of public contexts with figurines, as well as the quantities and type of figurines found in them, would allow for more nuanced interpre­tations. For example, the authors note that an acrobat fig­urine, not a common type, was recovered in a public building. Typical of Formative Oaxaca, figurines blurred the line between public and household contexts, which they refer to as "communal domesticity." Hepp and Joyce balance ritual-based interpretations of figurines with those that focus on negotiations of social identity. The authors' careful parsing of anatomical traits related to sex (female/male) vs. costume and accoutrements that per­form gender (feminine/masculine) is particularly useful,

as these concepts are often not untangled in figurine analyses. 
The final chapter is by a non-Oaxacanist, Pool, who usefully situates the LRVV within the broader context of Formative development in Mesoamerica, comparing it with Monte Alban and Tres Zapotes. Comparing these early polities through exclusionary and corporate strate­gies (and acknowledging the problematic nature of this binary), Pool finds the muting of inequalities of social status in the rise of the LRVV polity most comparable to Monte Alban, while at Tres Zapotes, exclusionary strategies featured prominently during the Middle For­mative. As an outsider to the Oaxaca Wars, Pool's per­spective on the ZIH is particularly insightful: he con­cludes that, despite decades of research focused on find­ing evidence for this phenomenon in the LRVV, it simply has not been demonstrated. Would it be overly optimistic to suggest that, based on current research, this may be the final word on the subject? 
Except for Pool, the authors are all past or current collaborators and/or students of Joyce. While this may sound like a festschrift for the senior Joyce, the vigor of his collaborations clarify that this book reports on just one stage of a very ambitious research program that he will continue to guide for decades. Is it too soon to ask for a volume on the Early Classic?
