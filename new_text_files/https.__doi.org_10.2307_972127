URBANISM AND EARLY STATE FORMATION IN THE 
HUAMELULPAN VALLEY OF SOUTHERN MEXICO 

Andrew K. Balkansky 
zA long-running debate in archaeology is the analytical priority given to local vs. interregional-scale factors in the origins of complex societies. These alternate approaches have often pitted local-scale, environmentally determined models against the large-scale, sociopolitical demands of ancient cities and states. In the archaeology of Oaxaca, Mexico, these distinctions are apparent in efforts to model the impact of Monte Alban on the development of complexity outside the Valley of Oaxaca. Huamelulpan, located in the western Mixteca Alta, Oaxaca, was one of Mesoamerica 's first urban centers. But despite sev­eral decades of intermittent work, the site had never been surveyed, and nearly nothing was known of the surrounding region. A systematic archaeological survey of Huamelulpan and its environs studied the urban transition from a regional perspec­tive. Huamelulpan 's urbanization was strongly correlated with the formation of a state-level polity. Interaction with Monte Alban occasioned these developments, albeit in ways more indirect than colonization or conquest. An approach to culture change is outlined that uses archaeological survey data to shift the scale of analysis between local, regional, and interre­gional levels to interpret the transition to city and state in Oaxaca's Huamelulpan Valley. 
La prioridad dada a facto res de escala local contra facto res de escala interregional en el analisis de/ origen de sociedades complejas es un tema de largo debate en arqueologfa. Estas aproximaciones alternativas han, en muchos casos, enfrentado modelos de determinismo ambiental de escala local contra las demandas sociopolfticas de ciudades y estados antiguos, a escala regional. En la arqueo/ogfa de Oaxaca, Mexico, estas distinciones son perceptibles en Los esfuerzos de modelar el impacto de Monte Alban en el desarrollo de la complejidad social fuera de/ Valle de Oaxaca. Huamelulpan, situado en el area occidental de la Mixteca Alta, Oaxaca, Jue uno de los primeros centros urbanos de Mesoamerica. A pesar de varias decadas de trabajos esporadicos, jamas se ha hecho prospeccion en el sitio y poco se conoce de la region que lo rodea. A traves de una prospeccion arqueologica sistematica def Valle de Huamelulpan, se estudio el proceso de transicion de/ sis­tema urbano desde una perspectiva regional. La urbanizacion de Huamelulpan esta correlacionada con la formacion de una estructura estatal en la region. La interaccion con Monte Alban Jue un factor en este proceso, aunque en formas mas bien indirectas, en Lugar de colonizacion o conquista. En este trabajo se esboza una aproximacion al cambio cultural que hace uso de los datos de la prospeccion arqueologica para producir analisis a niveles local, regional e interregional para inter­pretar la transicion hacia la ciudad y el estado en el Valle de Huamelulpan. 
A
ncient Mesoamerica's urban revolution finds its counterpoint in the origins of the state. Questions involving the interrela­tionship of city and state are necessarily posed from a regional perspective. The duality of urban­ism and early state formation is made explicit by Blanton (1981:392): "cities are a manifestation of the growth of institutions capable of organizing large regions into integrated systems." This same view underlies the approach of Sanders and Webster (1988:523 [citing Sjoberg 1960]), who see "a close association of preindustrial cities with the process of state formation ... [and emphasize] cities as centers of ancient states." A definition of the city as embedded within a wider political context is precisely what Marcus (1983a:206-208), based on an ethnohistorical analysis of sixteenth-century sources, argues had been the native perspective of the Prehispanic Mesoamerican Indian. As such, the ancient Mesoamerican city was expressly regional in nature, and its study requires regional approaches. Archaeological settlement pattern surveys are uniquely suited to collect data on a scale broad

enough to encompass the urban phenomenon 
(Ammerman 1981; Johnson 1977; Kowalewski 
1990a; Wright 1986). Yet the convergence of 
scholarly opinion on the use of regional survey 
methods in the study of ancient cities and states 
has not been equaled on the interpretive level. 
Theoretical frameworks have often proven inade­
quate to describe the complexity of the spatial 
patterns. 
In the archaeology of Oaxaca, Mexico, the the­oretical focus has shifted between environmen­tally deterministic and sociopolitical models of culture change (cf. Marcus 1990; Sanders and Nichols 1988). The role of Oaxaca's original and preeminent urban center, Monte Alban, in the development of complexity outside the Valley of Oaxaca has been a matter of particular contention (Joyce 1993; Marcus 1992a; Marcus and Flannery 1996; Zeitlin 1990). These positions have become so entrenched that scholars are faced with an unfortunate choice: look toward Monte Alban for an easy explanation, or reject Monte Alban involvement altogether to under­stand the rise of complexity in their study region. With few exceptions, scholars working in regions peripheral to the Valley of Oaxaca have not seri­ously attempted a multiscale approach in both methods employed, and in theoretical formula­tions. Even when regional survey methods are used, the resulting data are often underanalyzed, and explanations tend toward unidirectional (and often unsupported) arguments that place local (often environmental) factors at odds with the regional and interregional dimensions of culture change. Yet most scholars would agree that both in situ and extralocal factors must be considered. The power of regional archaeological survey is to detect processes operating at local, regional, and interregional scales. Ideas concerning environ­ment, ecology, and analytical scale, in the study of urbanism and early state formation, are further evaluated with survey findings from the Huamelulpan Valley, in the Mixteca Alta of Oaxaca. 
The divergence in causal priority between the ecological functionalist and sociopolitical per­spectives can be traced to the beginnings of set­tlement archaeology. Following Willey's (1953) landmark study, long-term surveys by Robert McC. Adams in southern Iraq (Adams 1965, 
1981; Adams and Nissen 1972) and William T. 
Sanders and colleagues in the central Mexican 
highlands (Sanders 1965; Sanders et al. 1979) 
sought to define the outlines of a civilization 
through changes in settlement patterns over the 
course of several thousand years. But despite 
shared intellectual origins, a theoretical schism 
arose that placed differing emphases on ecologi­
cal processes and human decision making. 
Sanders and colleagues (Sanders 1965, 1972; 
Sanders and Price 1968; Sanders et al. 1979) 
argue that population pressure drives all culture 
change; Adams (1965, 1966, 1981), however, has 
focused on the sociopolitical dimensions in the 
development of complex societies. In compara­
tive studies of cultural evolution, it is paradoxical 
that both Sanders's and Adams's views are logi­
cally deduced from Steward-White neo-evolu­
tionary frameworks, even though their respective 
survey results show striking parallels. 
Both the Mesoamerican and Mesopotamian cases illustrate the emergence of cities with phe­nomenal rates of early growth, due primarily to a profound regional reorganization, as rural popula­tions were drawn to urban settings. In both cases, early cities at Teotihuacan and Uruk were observed alongside their political counterpart, visible on the regional level and designed to coor­dinate the new settlement landscape, the state. A further similarity was the long period of relative stability that preceded an episode of transforma­tion leading to the rise of cities and states (Adams 1972; Sanders et al. 1979:105-108). Adams emphasized the discontinuous nature of change, while Sanders, despite his environmental predilections, noted that key transitions were often preceded by idiosyncratic historical events (e.g., the volcanic eruption that destroyed Cuicuilco, thereby eliminating Teotihuacan's only rival). Despite these similarities, the theoretical differences presented by Sanders and Adams con­tinue to resonate today. 
One way to reconcile the Sanders/ Adams the­oretical schism is a neo-evolutionary framework that focuses on episodes of change (Spencer 1990). In this framework, critical historical junc­tures are as significant as periods of relative sta­bility for evolutionary models (Gould 1986; Marcus and Flannery 1996). The rapid resettle­ment of rural populations into the world's first

cities is a key point of convergence. This phe­nomenon has been termed a "synoikism," to describe the rural to urban migration that results in the emergence of cities where none had existed before. Synoikisms are discussed in Demand's (1990) historical study of urban relocation in archaic and classical Greece. Marcus and Flannery (1996) have made a powerful case for the occurrence of a synoikism in the establish­ment of Monte Alban. As the Greek cases show, synoikisms were not unique events, but a recur­rent feature in the generation of cities. The Greek accounts, moreover, specify that the change from the relative autonomy of village life to an urban­ized landscape cannot be reduced to environmen­tal stress, but occurred "only in the face of overwhelming external threat to their continued existence as autonomous political entities" (Demand 1990:5). The synoikism was not charac­terized by gradual "forces," but was a swift trans­formation of the countryside, set in motion by specific human actors. The effects of a synoikism were far-reaching and had many potentially unin­tended consequences. Significantly, this includes the organizational stress from the reduction of vil­lage autonomy by the creation of a larger polity. Early states may be expected to result under these circumstances (Flannery 1972; Johnson 1982, 1987; Wright 1969; Wright and Johnson 1975). In terms of model building, synoikisms appear to be a general process and may be one path to urban­ization. 
This paper focuses on the critical juncture after 500 B.C., when Oaxaca was transformed into an urban society. After 500 B.C., we see the first city at Monte Alban; by 200 B.C., we see the institu­tional transition to the state (Marcus and Flannery 1996). Soon after the establishment of Monte Alban, competing centers outside the Valley of Oaxaca, across the mountains in Oaxaca's Mixtec-speaking region, arose at Monte Negro, Yucuita, and Huamelulpan (Figure 1). Huamelulpan was transformed into an unprece­dented concentration of power and resources at a single early urban center (Figure 2). Huamelulpan's urbanization was so rapid as to preclude other explanation than a synoikism; the change on a regional level so profound that noth­ing less than the institutional transition to the state is indicated. These developments cannot be 
explained as the outcome of simple population growth or other kinds of environmental determin­ism; rather, the changes were effected in the sociopolitical realm, in response to the imperial aspirations of the early conquest state at Monte Alban. Although I argue against a strong conquest model to explain Huamelulpan, I do consider Monte Alban expansion to have been the proxi­mate cause in Huamelulpan's transformation. Throughout this paper I shift the scale of analysis between local, regional, and interregional levels, providing multiple analytical perspectives against which the nature of Huamelulpan's emergence from longer-term human/land relationships may be evaluated. 
Huamelulpan and the Origins of Mixtec Civilization 
Mixtec society underwent fundamental evolution­ary change over 2,000 years ago when it was transformed from Formative villages to Classic urban civilization. This transformation was marked by the emergence of major centers of unprecedented size and complexity and the appearance of a city-town-rancho settlement sys­tem that has typified life in the region from the Classic period to the present (Spores 1983a). The first wave of urbanization saw the rise of centers with populations numbering in the thousands, shared architectural styles, the appearance of hieroglyphic writing, and class divisions that were the integrative nexus for a host of smaller, less diverse sites in their hinterlands; these cen­ters mediated interaction with the world outside their domains. Monte Negro, Yucuita, and Huamelulpan bore witness to this phenomenon in the Mixteca Alta (Acosta and Romero 1992; Caso 1938, 1942; Marti 1965a, 1965b; Spores 1967, 
1972, 1983a, 1984; Winter 1989, 1994). Later cities at Yucufiudahui, Cerro J azmfn, and Diquiyu, as well as a host of lesser centers, built on these foundations and forged cultural patterns that are recognizably Mixtec (Spores 1983b, 1983c, 1984). But despite its distinctive cultural traits, modern language boundaries, and indica­tions of complex society deep in prehistory, the origins of Mixtec civilization have often been sought outside the Mixteca Alta. 
Much of the early research in the Mixteca Alta was undertaken to define its relationship to Monte

Alban (see summaries in Bernal 1965; Paddock 1966). With a limited database, the Zapotec and Mixtec regions were seen as little different during early urban times. Monte Alban was the source of the dominant "culture" of Oaxaca, while the Mixteca Alta was considered "provincial" in comparison. Huamelulpan, with hieroglyphs sim­ilar in style to preclassic Monte Alban, as well as comparable architectural and ceramic affinities, seemed to exemplify the Monte Alban-centric view. 

The modem history of research in the Mixteca Alta begins with the work of Ronald Spores (1965, 1967, 1972, 1984). Spores has sought to delineate changes in Mixtec society through inter­nal processes, thereby providing a corrective to earlier diffusionist views that stressed ties to the Valley of Oaxaca. Yet, today, interpretations con­tinue to oscillate between Spores's position and the Monte Alban-centric view. Based on the pres­ence of Monte Alban-style ceramics, Plunket (1983:105-106, 367-372) concludes that a "coer­cive alliance" existed between the Zapotec capital and Yucuita. In Plunket's model, Zapotec tribute demand (if not direct control) was the catalyst for Yucuita's centralization and the formation of new administrative institutions. In a similar vein, Byland and Pohl (1994:52-56) imply that Monte Alban conquest led to the foundation of Monte Negro. Their argument is based on a previously unpublished analysis of a carved stone from Monte Alban, said to refer to the conquest of the Jaltepec-Tilantongo study region (Byland and Pohl 1994:53-54). The Monte Alban-centric

argument is then extended into the subsequent phase, for which the investigators argue that heavy densities of Monte Alban grayware vessels 
(G.35 bowls) at the site of Hua Chino indicate conquest by the Zapotec state (Byland and Pohl 1994:56-60). They conclude that the eventual breakdown of Monte Alban hegemony was the background to the conflicts and histories depicted in the Postclassic Mixtec codices. 
In the survey of the Huamelulpan Valley, con­tinuity is indicated by the considerable regional complexity that predates both Huamelulpan and Monte Alban. The existence of a major pre-urban center in the Huamelulpan Valley was unknown until comparatively recent times and is discussed later in this paper. Other comparisons also distin­guish Huamelulpan from Monte Alban. Huamelulpan is not a plaza-centered site like Monte Alban, but has the linear arrangement typ­ical of the major Mixtec centers (compare the

ground plan of Monte Alban [Blanton 1978] with that of Monte Negro [Acosta 1965], Yucuita [Plunket 1983], or Yucuiiudahui [Caso 1938]). Another factor is the continuity in tanware ceram­ics that predates the founding of the ancient city and dominates the ceramic complex throughout the Classic period. Even the hieroglyphs from Huamelulpan, though similar to Zapotec day signs and iconographic motifs (Caso 1956; Marcus 1983b ), nevertheless are inscribed on a platform flanked by monolithic cornerstones-a distinctive Mixtec feature (Gaxiola 1984). The use of Zapotec calendric numbers and similar day signs may simply indicate that the Mixteca had yet to develop its own indigenous writing system (Marcus 1983b). The other introduced elements at Huamelulpan are the gray Ramos-phase urns, excavated by Gaxiola (1978, 1984:37-38), that incorporate a representation of the Zapotec Lightning supernatural (Caso's Glyph C [Caso 1928; Caso and Bernal 1952]). Finally, although the survey found decorated graywares presum­ably imported from the Valley of Oaxaca at the principal sites in the Huamelulpan Valley, they were only associated with elite residential and ceremonial contexts. The decorated graywares and carved stones constitute a limited example of local Mixtec elite emulating Zapotec iconogra­phy; they do not constitute a widespread, intru­sive, and disjunctive ceramic or other material cultural manifestation. The local tradition contin­ues without interruption. 
Despite these considerations, and misgivings about an earlier mode of Monte Alban-centered arguments, there are, nevertheless, significant developmental parallels between the two sites (cf. Blanton 1976, 1978, 1983). Both sites were founded on a defensible hilltop in the center of a valley, where no site had been before. Huamelulpan's Late Cruz-phase antecedent was located on the low hills adjacent to Cerro Volado, within the boundaries of what eventually became urban Huamelulpan. On Cerro Volado itself, how­ever, there was no Cruz-phase occupation. In the case of Monte Alban, its central placement has been shown to have been a good administrative strategy that likely held the additional benefits of defense, as well as the ideological power of a sacred place (Blanton 1978; Spencer 1982, 1990). At Huamelulpan, the same administrative advan­
tage would have obtained from its placement in the central portion of the valley, while Huamelulpan's defensive features include a mas­sive defensive wall and a series of defended hill­top sites on its perimeter. To this day, the site retains great symbolic meaning for residents of the valley. The Mixtec name for Huamelulpan, Yucunindaba, means "the hill that flew" into the valley (Bradomin 1992). An associated origin myth continues to be told. 
Huamelulpan lies among a chain of narrow valleys strung along the upper basin of the Rio Balsas, between Teposcolula and Tlaxiaco. The site, centered on the terraced hilltop of Cerro Volado, overlooks a narrow alluvium and the modem town (Figure 2). Previous work at the site (Caso and Gamio 1961; Gamio 1957; Gaxiola 1984; Winter et al. 1991), with its mound groups, elite residences, ball court, and an enormous plat­form whose cornerstones are inscribed with hieroglyphs, established Huamelulpan as a major early urban center of the Mesoamerican Late Formative (see summaries in Flannery and Marcus 1983a, 1983b; Marcus 1983b; Spores 1984; Winter 1989, 1994). Yet many questions were raised by these initial explorations that could not be resolved without placing the exca­vated data into a larger site level and regional context (Gaxiola 1984:80; Winter et al. 1991 :84). What was the relationship between the mound groups, carved stones, and other features in the excavated portion of the site to the rest of Huamelulpan? What was the size of the site, and how did it vary over time? How was the rise of the urban center, from its antecedent conditions to its eventual collapse, related to events in the region as a whole? Did interaction with Monte Alban occasion any of these developments? Are there general processes of urban evolution and early state formation that might explain 
Huamelulpan and similar cases elsewhere in Mesoamerica? Based on the survey findings, I address each of these questions in tum. 
Methods 

An archaeological settlement survey of the valley was conducted in 1994-1995 to examine the nature of Huamelulpan's foundation and development from a regional perspective (Spores 1996). The project used full-coverage survey (Kowalewski

Minor modifications were made for the ridgeline that defines the valley, consistent with other mountain surveys (Drennan 1989; Finsten and Kowalewski 1991). In the mountains, all primary ridgelines and peaks were covered systematically, while supplemental information on site location was provided by informants. All visible architec­tural features, including mounds, stone founda­tions and walls, terraces, plazas, stairways, and roads were measured and drawn in the field. The possible effects of postdepositional occupation, erosion, and alluviation were examined at each site. Artifact collections were taken from circum­scribed locations at each site for later analysis in the laboratory. These procedures were applied consistently throughout the project area, provid­ing as near as possible a total sample of the vari­ability of the region's settlement. 
Sites were ordered chronologically using the ceramic sequence established through survey and test excavation in the Nochixtlan Valley (Spores 1972, 1974), and as employed on other survey and excavation projects in the Mixteca Alta (e.g., Byland 1980; Byland and Pohl 1994; Finsten and Kowalewski 1991; Lind 1987; Plunket 1983; Robles 1988; Winter and Hernandez 1977; Winter et al. 1993; Zarate 1987). Throughout this paper, I have attempted to specify the empirical basis of the chronological designations for sites of all time periods. The temporal focus of this study is the Ramos phase (Figure 3), when the first cities and states appeared in the Mixteca Alta. The phase was

I chose not to employ Gaxiola's (1976, with introduced elements of known provenience 1984) chronology for Huamelulpan, since it was from the Valleys of Oaxaca (Caso et al. 1967; temporally restricted and not geared to regional Kowalewski et al. 1978) and Tehuacan (MacNeish survey collections. Gaxiola's classification was et al. 1970).

At Huamelulpan, nearly the entire site is accessible for archaeological study. While the goals of the urban survey were the same as those at even the smallest sites in the valley, the data recovery methods were slightly intensified (more collections taken) to better account for the com­plex of mounds, plazas, terraces, and other fea­tures distributed across Cerro Volado and its adjacent hills. Every feature-from the largest mounds to individual residences on each of more than 300 residential terraces-were measured and drawn in the field. All features and terraces were sampled to determine chronology and to infer other aspects of the organization and variability of settlement within the site. Although time consum­ing, this was deemed necessary to obtain a com­plete picture of the changing settlement configuration at Huamelulpan. These methods approximate those used for intensive site surveys and have yielded the most complete information on the entire site of Huamelulpan. 
The advantage of these data lies in our ability to place Huamelulpan in a heretofore unavail­able site level and regional context. The full­coverage survey methods are comparable to those employed in the other principal Oaxaca surveys. Unlike many prior studies, extensive and well-reported excavations provide lines of comparison often unavailable to other survey projects. But there are at least two key limita­tions: the size of the project area and its relative isolation (Figure 4). Although the entire physio­graphic valley was surveyed, the size of the pro­ject area (138 km') is small by the standard of Oaxaca surveys (the Nochixtlan Valley survey is more than three times larger, while the contigu­ous central Valleys of Oaxaca and Pefioles cover an area 30 times greater than the Huamelulpan Valley). The other major limitation of the data is the placement of the study area, at some dis­tance from Oaxaca's interconnected valley sur­veys. Huamelulpan, given its isolation, does not enjoy the interpretive advantages of regions connected to large, contiguous survey blocks (discussed in Feinman and Nicholas 1990; Finsten and Kowalewski 1996; Kowalewski l 990b, l 990c ). Despite these limitations, the project was initiated because the encroachment of the modem world threatens the limited num­ber of early urban sites, and they cannot wait for 
the ever-expanding Oaxaca surveys to reach them. 
Pre-Huamelulpan Settlement Patterns 
The valley's settlement history dates from the Early Cruz phase (ca. 1400-1150 B.C.), with early sedentary communities located near the alluvium in the southern half of the project area (Figure 5). Although the areal extent of these sites is difficult to determine, given their antiquity and the overburden of later occupations, the distribu­tion of ceramics indicates at least two loci of set­tlement. These ceramic materials resemble the burnished plain and buff wares of the Tierras Largas phase in the Valley of Oaxaca (Flannery and Marcus 1994) and may be considered coeval with the origin of the tanware ceramic tradition in the Mixteca Alta (Spores 1972). By the Middle Cruz phase (ca. 1150-700 B.C.), the number of settlements had increased, all clustered in the low piedmont and on piedmont spurs overlooking the alluvium in the southern half of the valley, where we see the most accessible and productive lands for farming (Figure 6). 
One locality, Santa Cruz Tayata, had several dispersed mounds and became the first site in the valley to reach town-sized proportions. The Middle Cruz site was 37.5 ha in extent, with sev­eral satellites of lesser size and complexity clus­tered nearby. Ceramic cross-ties place this site temporally with the Early Formative at Etlatongo (Zarate 1987) and with the San Jose phase in the Valley of Oaxaca (Flannery and Marcus 1994). By the Late Cruz phase (ca. 700-300 B.C.), set­tlement had more than doubled compared to the previous phase; it now included localities across the full length of the Huamelulpan Valley (Figure 7). Santa Cruz Tayata grew to over 50 ha and sat atop a three-tier settlement hierarchy. Hierarchical development to this degree-and the likelihood that Santa Cruz Tayata functioned as a central place-almost certainly represents the sociopolitical complexity of a chiefdom (Carneiro 1981; Flannery et al. 1981; Renfrew 1978; Wright 1984). Settlement at this time was still largely confined to the southern valley. 
The particulars of Santa Cruz Tayata require further elaboration, since it was the main settle­ment prior to the advent of Huamelulpan, showed considerable internal complexity, and apparently

had elite-level ties to the Valley of Oaxaca (Figure 8). The primary mound stood more than 8 m high and sat adjacent to an expansive, artificially flat­tened plaza that had heavy densities of obsidian on the surface. This section of the site had occu­pations dating to several time periods. Obsidian also was recovered from a zone of burials that dated exclusively to the Middle and Late Cruz phases. The presence of obsidian suggests that elites at Santa Cruz Tayata were well acquainted

with Formative trade networks (Pires-Ferreira 1976). Interregional exchange of highly valued and ritually charged commodities like obsidian may have been one of the principal items traded among emergent chiefs (Drennan 1976, 1983a; Feinman 1991; Flannery 1968; Helms 1979). At a secondary mound, located 500 m southwest of the central plaza, the survey recovered a Delfina Fine Gray cylinder rim, double-burnished, with a Lightning motif excised on the exterior of the

Finally, artifactual differences in collections made across the site suggest emergent status dif­ferences. In one sector, decorated pottery and lux­ury items were associated with what appears to have been a number of exposed elite burials. Other exposed interments were only associated with

plain and utilitarian goods (such as storage jars and undecorated pottery). These burials and their asso­ciated households (the burials appear to be sub­floor interments) were located in close proximity on the same portion of the site. This may represent a barrio whose membership included households of variable status, much as has been documented through excavation at San Jose Mogote in the Valley of Oaxaca (Flannery and Marcus 1994; Marcus 1989; Marcus and Flannery 1996).

Ramos-phase sites Gust as they were at Yucuita [Plunket 1983; Spores 1972]). 
The local settlement shift that occurred in the southern valley was especially telling. Santa Cruz Tayata was eclipsed by a settlement (TL 161) located less than .5 km distant, which had been nearly unoccupied in Late Cruz times and had but one apparent advantage: unlike Santa Cruz Tayata, this new paramount of the southern valley had a direct line of sight to Cerro Volado. 
Ramos-Phase Urbanization 
Huamelulpan was by far the largest site of its time, and far larger than any site had ever been 
during the previous thousand-year history of set­tled life in the valley. The Late Cruz-phase antecedent to urban Huamelulpan was limited to one small site with only 6 ha of occupation. At the Ramos horizon, Huamelulpan experienced phenomenal growth and reached an extent of 
1.55 km2 early in the city's history. By the Late Ramos phase, the occupation was measured at 

2.12 km2• 
The rapid development from isolated rural vil­lage to the valley's predominant urban center probably occurred within a century, as indicated by the continuous distribution of chronologically sensitive ceramic types across the site. These

ceramic materials fall into Gaxiola's (1984) earli­est ceramic phase, Huamelulpan I, and ceramic cross-ties with the Valley of Oaxaca place the inception of the urban period to Monte Alban Late I (Drennan's [1983b:369] evaluation of radiocarbon dates places this period at 300-200 B.C.). Although no characterization study has yet been done to confirm the point of origin for these presumed imports, they were typologically identi­cal to defined Monte Alban types. Especially prevalent were the G.12 (combed bottom), G.17, and C.20 (Caso et al. 1967). The appearance of these imports from the Valley of Oaxaca has long been used as a Ramos-phase horizon marker in the Mixteca Alta (Spores 1972). Gaxiola's (1984:39) sole radiocarbon date of 2255 ± 80 
B.P. from the lowest levels of occupation in her excavations supports this chronological assess­ment (as does Plunket's [1983:20-44) cogent analysis of ceramic cross-ties and radiocarbon dates from the Nochixtlan Valley). 
Site-Level Settlement Dynamics 
Huamelulpan was unique in many respects beyond its size and regional impact. Many of the terraces on Cerro Volado appear to have been multifunctional, with a house or houses situated on a relatively higher level toward the back of the 

terrace, and a lower area in front presumably used for agriculture. The relative density of artifacts on intact terraces supports this inference, as they are far higher near the house foundations than at the front of the terrace. Other terraces, lacking house foundations, having few artifacts, and situated along natural runoff channels, may have been exclusively agricultural. This pattern of multiple­function terraces was not found at any other site in the project area. Such multifunction terracing is common in many parts of the modem world and probably occurred in prehistoric times-it simply has not been recognized as such (William M. Denevan, personal communication 1994). It was instructive to have observed that terraces of this kind are still used by the contemporary inhabi­tants of San Martin Huamelulpan. 
Agricultural production within the urban set­ting was further intensified through the construc­tion of "lama-bordo" terraces on Cerro Volado and adjacent hills. The lama-bordos are a verti­cally contiguous series of stone walls, which may exceed 3 m in height, designed to trap water and eroding soils as both descend natural drainage channels from the mountains to the valley floor. Lama-bordos-best likened to cross-channel or gully terraces-are an extremely productive farming technology often associated with Prehispanic sites in the Mixteca Alta (Spores 1969). The survey of Huamelulpan found that the lama-bordo terraces were fully integrated into the overall terracing scheme and were built in the time of the city (ceramics collected from the basal levels of terraces exposed by erosion and road cuts all dated to the Ramos phase). Resident farm­ing populations have been inferred at other ancient Mesoamerican cities (O'Brien et al. 1982; Sanders and Webster 1988). 
Other patterns could be inferred from the ter­race data set as well. Among those terraces dating exclusively to the Ramos phase, variations in ter­race size (especially width), access to exotic ceramics, proximity to mound groups and carved stones, house size, and relative accessibility sug­gested class-based differences between house­holds. These observations describe an urban plan composed of separate elite residential zones, each located near mound groups and surrounded by lower status households-a pattern that has impli­cations for the political organization and growth of the city (Marcus 1983a). 

On the uppermost terrace level, located near. the largest mound on the summit of Cerro Volado, the foundation stones of a multiroom structure covered an area of 136 m2-more than twice the size of the largest elite residence exca­vated by Gaxiola (1984:62-64). The domestic nature of this structure was supported by the many tortilla griddles (coma/es) and other kinds of utilitarian pottery found on the surface, manos and metates, and eroding human remains that likely came from a subfloor burial. Other houses located on the lower terraces were single-room structures covering an area of 20-30 m2 and had few or no decorated ceramics associated with them. Many of these households on the lower terraces of Cerro Volado may have been involved in specialized production, particularly chipped stone, and agriculture. There were both relative and absolute differences in the density and occurrence of chert debitage, chipped-stone tools, and proximity to the unoccupied lama-

bordo and other agricultural terraces. These findings contrast with the pattern of elite resi­dences excavated by Gaxiola (1984) that were not associated with specialized production of any kind. 
A few terraces and terrace clusters, however, with surface material suggesting higher status were interspersed among the less-elite terraces on lower levels of the hillside. These terraces were larger, had more decorated ceramics and pre­sumed imports, and were in close proximity to secondary mound groups (in one instance, an elite terrace cluster was associated with a previously unreported carved monolith). 
Finally, the quarrying of multiton limestone blocks took place in two separate locations on the summit of Cerro Volado. While the main opera­tion was found away from the residential area, secondary extraction took place a mere 50 m from the largest mound at the site. The distribution of quarried stone suggests that these materials were used to construct the city. 
Huamelulpan's segmented urban plan is reca­pitulated on the summit of Cerro Volado, where the principal mound group, main plaza, and the largest elite residence at the site share the hilltop with numerous small houses associated with util­itarian artifacts, heavy densities of chert debitage, the limestone quarry, and the origin point of a lama-bordo terrace that descends the great cleft in the hilltop nearly 200 m to the valley floor. This arrangement best conforms to the multiple-nuclei model of urbanism (cf. Marcus 1983a:202-206, 240). It is possible that each focus or nucleus of the site corresponded to variously ranked noble families and their retainers, much like the ethno­historic pattern of Mixtec social organization (e.g., Spores 1965, 1967, 1984:64-96). 
Huamelulpan in Regional Perspective 
The rise of the urban center had valleywide rami­fications. In the Early Ramos phase (ca. 300-200 B.C.), the region underwent major changes in both system scale and settlement hierarchy (Figure 9). For the first time there was a continu­ous distribution of settlement along the full 20­km length of the valley. The region's key secondary center, at Cerro La Calentura, was located even farther from the pre-urban focus of settlement in the Tayata subvalley and likely rep­resents a greater interest in regions to the north. Significantly, La Calentura-a terraced site with defensive walls-was located on a defensible hilltop near the region's least productive agricul­tural land but overlooks a small patch of alluvial land in the Teposcolula Valley. 
By the Late Ramos phase (ca. 200 B.C.-A.D. 200), nearly 100 sites dotted the valley, as site sizes and settlement densities all increased from the previous phase and reached their Prehispanic maxima (Figure 10, Table 1). These sites included several major secondary centers, whose functions likely included administration of the valley's expanded settlement system. This expansion was the direct consequence of the growth and central­ity of urban Huamelulpan. Regional settlement patterns reflected the urban transition, with settle­ment focused on the central valley near the urban core. The valley's key secondary center was now at Cerro Yucusavi, a terraced and defended hilltop site that had multiple architectural complexes and measured 56 ha-the second largest site ever in the Huamelulpan Valley. The location of the Yucusavi site, just 2.5 km southeast of Cerro Volado, underscores the centripetal effect of Huamelulpan. The valley's centralization was accompanied by increased occupational density, as suggested by relative artifact densities, inci­dence of terracing, and numbers of house founda­tions. 
Monumental architecture was not limited to Huamelulpan and its major secondary centers. Large-scale construction was begun at many of the region's lower-order centers. As a proxy measure of political control, the distribution of sites with mounded architecture suggests that the entire val­ley was administered from Huamelulpan (Figure 11). The total volume and elaboration of mounds roughly corresponds to the size-based settlement hierarchy for the Early and Late Ramos phases. As a secondary measure of the integration of the val­ley, the distribution of decorated ceramics also corresponds to the settlement hierarchy. Although few in number, decorated graywares and cream­wares were found not only at Huamelulpan, but at other key Ramos-phase sites in the valley. The G.12s and numerous tanware imitations are an indication of growing regional complexity, shown by exchange ties and perhaps emulation of the principal Valley of Oaxaca decorated style of the

Huamelulpan was but one of many hilltop ter­raced sites that defined the central core of the val­ley, four of which had defensive perimeter walls (Figure 12). These defensive walls typically sup­ported terraces that were too steep for habitation, lacked residential artifacts, were larger than the average terrace, and were placed along key access points at the edge of the site.

At Huamelulpan, the main defensive wall runs for more than 100 m and may have served to delimit the sacred core on the summit of Cerro Volado. Remnants of this wall were 8 m high and over 2 m thick in places and represent an under­taking as impressive as any mound group at the site. A more secular function may be inferred for the other terraced sites, whose defensive walls

guarded key access points on their lower slopes, rather than the mounds and elite residences on the hilltops. The location of these fortified sites formed an arc around the periphery of Huamelulpan. It is unclear, however, whether Huamelulpan's newfound concern with defense was in response to an external threat or represents an episode of militaristic expansion of its own.

This has proven a highly successful, relatively objective means to define early states in compar­ative perspective (e.g., Blanton et al. 1993; Marcus and Flannery 1996; Renfrew 1978; Wright 1977, 1986). In the Huamelulpan Valley, changes in hierarchy from the Late Cruz to Ramos phases suggest a society in transition from chiefdom to state, coincident with, or shortly after, the foundation of the urban center (Figures 13 and 14).

trative apparatus of Huamelulpan's polity reached four tiers (Figure 15). Settlement by the end of Ramos times had placed three new tiers over the previous Cruz phase and easily met the three-tier minimum administrative hierarchy used to define the state. The Late Ramos-phase growth of mid­dle-tier settlements in the valley suggests a more strongly integrated region than in earlier times. The marked increase in total sites and site sizes, distribution of decorated ceramics, and the Late Ramos pattern of defensible sites also suggest greater regional integration commensurate with a hierarchy-based definition of the state. As detailed above, other more idiosyncratic or tradi­tional measures of the state also were present. 
These include elite-level interregional ties, spe­cialized activities, coordinated militarism, scale of regional polity, and hieroglyphic writing, among other characteristics (although these also may be present in chiefdoms). Other studies have claimed that early states did not arise in the Mixteca Alta until the Late Classic (Byland and Pohl 1994:56-60, 208-220), but the empirical basis for their argument remains unclear.

tively small 45 ha, a decline of 80 percent from its Ramos-phase maximum. The survey, moreover, detected few of the decorated graywares typical of the contemporaneous Period IIIA at Monte Alban (Caso et al. 1967), or examples of the orangeware complex from the Las Flores phase in the Nochixtlan Valley (Spores 1972). No site replaced Huamelulpan as a major regional center, as was observed for the Yucuita-Yucufiudahui transition in the Nochixtlan Valley (Plunket 1983; Spores 1983b, 1983c ). The Huamelulpan Valley was now peripheral to developments elsewhere in the Mixteca (Spores 1984; Winter 1994). 
These changes were reflected on a regional level by the decentralization of settlement, as population moved from Cerro Volado and its immediate environs to reoccupy low-lying terrain in the southern valley (Figure 16). The settlement history of Santa Cruz Tayata is an example. After the fall of Huamelulpan, it again became a focus of settlement, as the pre-Huamelulpan settlement pattern reasserted itself in the southern valley, a condition that persists to this day. Meanwhile, many of the secondary centers to which some of the Ramos-era administrative burden had been delegated remained strong and likely achieved some measure of autonomy from the regional center. Huamelulpan, thought to have been aban­doned around A.D. 600, nevertheless maintained a remnant population, as the survey recovered both Las Flores and Natividad-phase ceramics 
from residential contexts on the lower terraces of 
Cerro Volado and its adjacent hills. These occu­
pations were continuous with the urban era settle­
ment, albeit at a much-reduced intensity. 
Huamelulpan was at or near the top of the 
region's settlement hierarchy until the end of the 
Prehispanic sequence. 

Late Postclassic distributions in site sizes and decorated ceramics show three principal settle­ments in the Huamelulpan Valley: Cerro La Cumbre, Huamelulpan, and the cluster of sites near Santa Cruz Tayata (Figure 17). The relatively flat hierarchy characteristic of the Late Postclassic in the Mixteca Alta has made it difficult to infer political relationships on the basis of archaeologi­cal data alone (Byland and Pohl 1994; Spores 1967, 1972, 1983d). Yet there was an intriguing pattern in the distribution of settlements and asso­ciated decorated ceramic wares within the Huamelulpan Valley during the Late Postclassic. Settlement density dropped off considerably toward the northern half of the valley, precisely where two of the region's largest Late Postclassic sites (Cerro La Cumbre and Huamelulpan) were located. Another division was reflected in the ceramics: although the decorated Graphite-on­Orange was found at sites across the valley, access to the other principal decorated ceramic, Yanhuitlan Red-on-Cream, was generally restricted to elite contexts at larger sites (see Natividad-phase ceramic descriptions in Lind

1987; Spores 1972). Yanhuitlan Red-on-Cream was most abundant, however, at the lone northern center of La Cumbre, where the Terrace 34 collec­tion had more Yanhuitlan Red-on-Cream than that recorded at all other sites in the valley combined. Whether this represents a favorable position in historically known exchange spheres between Teposcolula-Tlaxiaco-Achiutla (Romero Frizzi 1985) or defines a political boundary, or both, remains obscure due to the Huamelulpan Valley's location at the crossroads of three major polities (Spores 1967, 1983e, 1984).

been studied by regional survey-Huamelulpan, Yucuita, and Monte Alban-and all three projects recorded the same transformation. Huamelulpan was founded where no site had been before and reached urban proportions early in the city's his­tory. This is exactly what occurred at Monte Alban (Blanton 1976, 1978, 1983), and nearly so at Yucuita, which was relatively small in extent prior to its Ramos phase expansion (Plunket 1983:Table 3; Spores 1972, 1983a). These cases are all from Oaxaca and may be historically related. Yet simi­larities in the tempo and mode (Spencer 1990) of urbanism and early state formation in three well­documented instances in highland Oaxaca suggest that general evolutionary processes underlie these phenomena. 

Comparisons between Huamelulpan and Monte Alban show significant developmental similarities. Huamelulpan's foundation, like that of Monte Alban, represents a shift away from the region's best agricultural land, with populations relocating on defensible hilltops. To underscore this point, the key secondary center during the Early Ramos phase was located even further from the alluvium, near the region's poorest agricul­tural land. Santa Cruz Tayata, with the widest expanse of alluvium and the focal settlement dur­ing Cruz times, lost much of its population and regional stature. Much the same transition occurred in the Valley of Oaxaca, as regional population density and political power shifted from San Jose Mogote to Monte Alban (Marcus and Flannery 1996). Subsequent developments at both Huamelulpan and Monte Alban sought to overcome productive deficits. Huamelulpan's heavy investment in agricultural production­seen in the pattern of multifunction terracing, lama-bordo terraces, and settlement of the allu­vium near the urban center-all belie a locally acute resource shortage stemming from the newly urbanized landscape. This might be compared to the "piedmont strategy" used to provision Monte Alban (Blanton et al. 1982; Kowalewski 1982; Kowalewski et al. 1989:124-126; Marcus and Flannery 1996:146-150). Even more intriguing is Huamelulpan's pattern of agricultural intensifica­tion in the context of regional settlement patterns. These changes suggest heavy local investment in agricultural production even as Huamelulpan's political domain expanded beyond the frontiers of 
the valley. In this way, Huamelulpan (and perhaps other Mixtec centers) found the means to support increased populations that could then be sent forth on extravalley military adventures-a rela­tionship predicted by Flannery (1983a:331). Monte Alban's foundation also occurred during an expansionist phase (Marcus 1992a; Redmond 1983; Spencer 1982). 
These developmental similarities support the evolutionary perspective. Huamelulpan and Monte Alban both had early phases of expansion that accompanied early state formation; each had similar structural changes as local populations resettled from agriculturally productive zones to relatively marginal hilltop settings; both centers quickly replaced an antecedent chiefly society; and both arose in the context of widespread mili­tarism. Specific historical circumstances sur­rounding the rise of Huamelulpan and Monte Alban, however, were quite different, as were their subsequent developmental trajectories. Ultimate causation, even in evolutionary perspec­tive, must be sought in its historical context (cf. Spencer 1990). In the case of Huamelulpan, that historical context was the militaristic expansion of the Monte Alban state. 
The timing of Huamelulpan's foundation and early growth are consistent with a model of Zapotec territorial conquest (Flannery and Marcus 1976, 1983c; Marcus 1976a, 1983c, 1992a; Marcus and Flannery 1996; Redmond 1983; Spencer 1982, 1990). This model might apply equally well to Huamelulpan's early growth, or to Monte Alban's subjugation of large portions of the Mixteca Alta (but see Marcus and Flannery 1996: 195-207). Huamelulpan is well within the range of places evidently conquered by Monte Alban-a distance no greater than that which separates Monte Alban from Ejutla or the Cuicatlan Canada, regions that were likely con­quered by an expansionist Zapotec state (Feinman and Nicholas 1990; Redmond 1983; Spencer 1982). There were more than 40 conquest monu­ments at Monte Alban, only eight of which have been deciphered (Caso 1938, 1947; Marcus 1976a, 1980, 1983c, 1992a, 1992b:l75-176, 394-400; Marcus and Flannery 1996: 195-207). Yet the relationship between Monte Alban and regions on its periphery was variable, such that some places were conquered outright, others were

maintained as tributary provinces, and still others had less direct kinds of relationships with the Zapotec state (Marcus and Flannery 1996: 195-207). 
These considerations-along with the high level of regional complexity that predates Huamelulpan and the absence of an intrusive ceramic complex-argue against a strong con­quest position. A clear internal dynamic links the movement of local populations from Santa Cruz Tayata to Cerro Volado. City building, moreover, was not likely a part of Monte Alban's conquest strategy; the Zapotec ideal was to extract tribute, not make large investments (Redmond 1983:26-36). Cuicatlan is a case in point (Redmond 1983:83): the region did not see an increase in site sizes or settlement hierarchy to so pronounced a degree as the Huamelulpan Valley. If the Cuicatec case is the measure of Monte Alban conquest, then hierarchical suppression may be more indicative of conquest at this time, than the development of cities and states (Redmond's [1983] survey data do, however, show a significant shift in site location). Evidence for the conquest of the Cuicatlan Canada includes burned and abandoned settlements, a shift in site location designed to boost the region's agricul­tural productivity, production of desirable tierracaliente foodstuffs, establishment of a major fortress that controlled access to the region, a skullrack with its connotations of imperial admin­istration, and the conquest monument from Building J at Monte Alban (Redmond 1983; Spencer 1982). This pattern of evidence is notably absent from Huamelulpan and other sites in the Mixteca Alta. 
In the mountains of the Peiioles area, situated between the Valley of Oaxaca and the Mixteca Alta, the investigators argue that a relatively low level of interaction, certainly far less than con­quest, characterized relations between the two regions (Finsten 1996; Finsten and Kowalewski 1991). The core of Late Formative Peiioles had strong continuity with earlier periods and main­tained considerable autonomy from the Zapotec state. Only the far northwestern portion of the Pefioles area had sites distributed along a possible "communication corridor" leading into the south­ern part of the Nochixtlan Valley (Finsten 1996). Settlement along this corridor may have been 
related to Monte Alban expansion. Yet survey of the southern Nochixtlan Valley-that includes the site of Monte Negro-has not identified "the ele­gant settlement pattern shifts described for the Cuicatlan Canada" that could suggest Monte Alban conquest (Byland and Pohl 1994:55). Monte Negro may represent the farthest extent of Monte Alban expansion; but on the basis of pre­sent data, its status remains equivocal (cf. Flannery 1983b; Marcus and Flannery 
1996: 165-169). 

Other archaeologists have invoked Monte Alban conquest of the Mixteca Alta to explain the growth of Monte Negro, Yucuita, and later Mixtec centers (Byland and Pohl 1994:52-56, 209; Plunket 1983:105-106, 367-372). Their conclu­sions-based solely on the presence of limited numbers of Monte Alban-style ceramics-do not place these imports in context, acknowledge the continuity of the local ceramic tradition, and fail to include an analysis of relevant settlement pat­terns. The ambiguity of the evidence surrounding Monte Negro has already been noted. Yucuita is a case in point. Plunket (1983:355-372) ignores settlement changes that suggest strong local con­tinuity (Spores 1972, 1983a) and instead uses the presence of Valley of Oaxaca graywares as the sole index of Monte Alban conquest. In a similar fashion, the presence of G.35 (grayware) bowls at a particular site in the Jaltepec-Tilantongo survey area (Byland and Pohl 1994), rather than indicat­ing a Late Classic conquest, is just as likely to represent exchange beyond the Zapotec frontier (cf. Redmond's [1983:130-142] analysis of Llano de los Mogotes, a possible "port of trade" in the Tehuacan Valley). And while major Classic­period centers were generally located on defensi­ble hilltops, that fact alone is inconclusive, unless one argues that an incomprehensibly enormous area-far larger than the modern state of Oaxaca-was under the dominion of Monte Alban (there are multiple reasons for elevated site placement [Spores 1983b:l54]). By the Late Classic, Monte Alban's period of expansion had long since passed, and the Monte Alban state was instead consolidating its domain within the con­fines of the Valley of Oaxaca (Marcus 1992a:399--404). In both cases cited (Byland and Pohl 1994; Plunket 1983), the conclusions extend well beyond the data, serving a perceived theoret-

ical need that has no empirical basis. 

Despite my rejection of the direct conquest hypothesis to explain the rise of Huamelulpan, I nevertheless consider the regional data entirely consistent with Marcus's (1992a) model of macroregional interaction in Late Formative Oaxaca. The presence of several major prestate centers at San Jose Mogote, Santa Cruz Tayata, and Etlatongo, among others, was in this instance the direct precursor to the process of state forma­tion. Huamelulpan's pattern of early growth-and its implications for political expansion beyond the Huamelulpan Valley-have already been enumer­ated. In regard to its relationship with Monte Alban, an interregional connection is evident in the ceramic cross-ties and hieroglyphic writing. Most crucial of all, however, is the timing of Huamelulpan's transformation. At precisely the time when Monte Alban embarked on an aggres­sive campaign of extravalley expansion (Marcus and Flannery 1996; Redmond 1983; Spencer 1982), we witness the rise of complexity at Huamelulpan. The apparent synchronicity of Huamelulpan's development and Monte Alban's expansion in Late Formative times is an unlikely coincidence. But what remains to fill the explana­tory void? Other kinds of interaction, short of out­right conquest, could have provided the historical context within which a secondary state arose from a pre-existing condition of chiefly political com­plexity at Huamelulpan. 
I have already introduced the concept of syn­oikism. Based on a historical study of Greek city­states (Demand 1990), synoikisms were unique events instigated by specific actors in which a for­merly dispersed countryside is concentrated in a newly founded urban center. This pattern was repeated, almost invariably, in response to an external military threat (and, significantly, accompanied efforts at power building by elite individuals). The model of the Greek synoikism has been applied to the case of Monte Alban (Marcus and Flannery 1996). Considered more broadly, synoikisms may be an underappreciated process in the development of prehistoric urban­ization (Joyce Marcus, personal communication 1996). 
Theoretical expectations for a synoikism fit the Huamelulpan Valley's transition from dis­persed villages to concentrated urbanism, the tim­
ing and tempo of urbanization, and the establish­ment of defensible and fortified sites that accom­pany the rise of the urban center. It is possible that military pressure from an aggressor state at Monte Alban sparked a chain reaction in the high­lands, in which centralized polities like those at Huamelulpan, Monte Negro, and Yucuita were forced to take a more militaristic posture or risk being consumed (parallel arguments for a range of societies may be found in Carneiro 1990; Haas 1990, Redmond 1994; Spencer 1979; Wilson 1987). These sites are all in defensible settings, and, with respect to Huamelulpan, each is located some 30 km distant-or approximately a one-day walk, often considered the administrative limit of small polities (Blanton et al. 1993:163-164, 184; Marcus 1976b; Spencer 1982, 1990; Willey 1981). 
Settlement pattern data currently available for both Monte Negro (Byland and Pohl 1994) and Yucuita (Plunket 1983; Spores 1972) conform to the same pattern. An analogous shift to defensible sites occurred during the contemporaneous Early Palo Blanco phase in the Tehuacan Valley (Spencer 1979). Spencer (1979:72) argues that the study region lay beyond the Zapotec frontier, yet the abandonment of existing settlements and the foundation of a new hilltop center (Ts73/79) with a defensive wall suggests "the possible role of Zapotec militarism in the creation of the unsta­ble political climate of Early Palo Blanco times in the Tehuacan Valley." 

Synoikism as an explanatory model maintains a significant interregional component, yet incor­porates a more Mixtec-centered perspective. This view undercuts the often ill-considered arguments that either invoke Monte Alban conquest, or reject Monte Alban involvement altogether, to explain the rise of complexity in the Mixteca Alta. We may instead look to other major Mixtec centers as more immediate threats to Huamelulpan than Monte Alban. Although Huamelulpan's rise might be considered a co-occurrence of the Monte Alban synoikism, the data presented here better support an episode of hypercentralization at Huamelulpan in response to Zapotec pressure-a century or more after the foundation of Monte Alban. Huamelulpan's explosive growth was ini­tiated during the contemporaneous Monte Alban Late I, long after the foundation of the Zapotec

capital. Plunket (1983:24-25, 101-106) dates the rise of Yucuita to the same period, as do Byland and Pohl (1994:52-56) at Monte Negro, and Spencer (1979) for the disruption in the Tehuacan Valley. In either case, it is clear that militarism was a key element in both Huamelulpan's foun­dation and later growth. The survey data show a dramatic shift to defensible site locations during Ramos times. The apparent militarism seen regionally is matched by the extant excavated data. Gaxiola (1984:5 1-52), in Late Ramos-phase deposits, reports the excavation of an altar with trophy skulls and, in a second context, carbonized human bone associated with the remains of deer, a hearth, and numerous serving bowls (Gaxiola 1984:62-64). The historic Mixtec are known to have partaken of cannibalistic rites with war cap­tives (Flannery and Marcus 1983a; Spores 1984:150); both the regional and excavated data 
sets from Huamelulpan suggest that these prac­tices had considerable time depth. 
I presented a series of questions at the begin­ning of this paper that I have attempted to address here. To summarize, I have tried to show the intrinsic value of regional archaeological survey. The degree to which Huamelulpan's settlement history was linked to developments in the region as a whole could not have been predicted on the basis of excavated data alone. Huamelulpan's antecedent conditions, timing and tempo of urbanization, and accompanying changes in set­tlement patterns were all unknown parameters. The regional view tells us more about the site's origins than all previous studies combined. I also have argued that the inception of Huamelulpan's urban period was accompanied on a regional level by dramatic changes in settlement patterns and inferred kinds of interrelations among sites in the new settlement system. This new formation is perhaps best explained as that of a secondary state, which was generated through a combination of long-term evolutionary change in the valley with the proximate cause being the impact of an expansionist Zapotec state. The small, short-lived 
polity that resulted forever changed the develop­
mental course of the Huamelulpan area. 
But the findings raise an additional series of 

questions that can only be addressed through 
appropriately designed research-much of which

hold, and feature. What was the nature of interac­tion between Formative villages in the southern Huamelulpan Valley, the Valley of Oaxaca, and other parts of Mesoamerica? Did this interaction continue into the urban era? What was the rela­tionship of individual households to elite-level political structure during the period of urbaniza­tion at Huamelulpan? From where did Huamelulpan's founding population come? At what time were defensive walls installed at Huamelulpan? What kinds of integration charac­terized the relationship between Huamelulpan and its secondary centers? Was Huamelulpan's political domain limited to the valley proper? What was the settlement history of neighboring regions, and how did it affect the urban transfor­mation at Huamelulpan? This interplay between multiscale factors lies at the heart of any consid­ered approach to key questions in anthropological archaeology. Urbanism and early state formation was at once a local, regional, and interregional phenomenon. The traditional site-centered per­spective in archaeology cannot explain this tran­sition in the absence of its large-scale context. Mixtec cities and states, and those elsewhere in 
highland Mesoamerica, arose in rough contempo­raneity, and this fact holds significance for our understanding of the underlying processes at work in their formation.
