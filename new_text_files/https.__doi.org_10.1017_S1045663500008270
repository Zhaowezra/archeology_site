is demonstrably inapplicable to Mesoamerica. If Bell­wood's hypothesis is unhelpful for exploring these data it, then why mention it at all? An important topic not addressed is why the study area was largely depopulated at 400 BC. Hopefully, this issue will be addressed in the forthcoming volumes. 
The Cotsen Institute is to be commended for investing the resources to make such detailed archaeological evi­dence available. With the progressive corporatization of academic publishing, philanthropy by wealthy benefac­tors makes an increasingly significant contribution to basic archaeological data presentation. The large format and high-quality reproduction of photographs effectively display ceramic pottery sherds and figurines as well as their contexts of deposition. The 47 figures that present ceramics in Chapter 9 and the 23 that illustrate figurines in Chapter I 0 are the single most important, substantive contribution of this monograph. I recommend this vol­ume to those interested in the Formative-period archae­ology of Central Mexico, and as a good example of how to present archaeological data in a manner usable by oth­ers. These data are far from perfect, but the warts are pre­sented and the resulting interpretive shortcomings are explicitly grappled with.

This is a beautifully illustrated, large-format volume, printed on heavy glossy paper with 19 chapters and 23 expert authors. Izumi Shimada provides an informative guide to the volume in Chapter I . The book is divided into five thematic sections. 
In the first section, Frank Salomon discusses the writ­ten sources for the study of the Inka, grouping the texts as conversations among the soldiers, administrators, churchmen, indigenous witnesses, and others who com­posed them. The approach is insightful and poetic. Rodolfo Cerr6n-Palomino traces the linguistic history of the Inkas. He argues that the founders of the dynasty originated in the Lake Titicaca area and originally spoke Puquina. They adopted Aymara when they settled in Cuzco, using Quechua only late in the dynastic history. Ken-Ichi Shinoda summarizes recent DNA evidence. The analysis is complicated because the Inkas resettled populations on a massive scale, so that it is hard to tell which burials might be lnka in a genetic sense. Still, he tries to line up the evidence with Cerr6n-Palomino's evi­dence for an origin in the Titicaca basin. Brian Bauer and Douglas Smit focus on the archaeology of Cuzco. They reject the myth of a late migration of the founders of the dynasty into the Cuzco region, arguing that the Inka state took form by about A .D. 1300. The state developed grad­ually by dominating the heartland, while the imperial expansion was rapid and late. 
In the second section, R. Alan Covey provides more information on the consolidation of Inka power in the highlands surrounding Cuzco and discusses the infra­structure of the empire: highways, administrative centers, religious sites, and population resettlement. Terence D' Altroy provides an excellent overview of the impor­tance of the economy to the Inka. He documents how the Inkas used economic policies to transform land­scapes, cultural practices, and the biota of the Andes. 
The third section of the book begins with a discussion of cosmology by John Earls and Gabriela Cervantes. They use the impressive terrace system at Moray to illus­trate aspects of astronomy, pilgrimage, the coordination of large-scale agricultural activities, and agricultural rit­uals. Gary Urton shows how the Inkas used the khipu to administer their empire. His examples illustrate how khipu could be used at the local level to track sociopo­litical units and at the provincial level for communicating information between levels of the administrative hierar­chy. Thomas Cummins, discussing Inka art, notes that the geometrical standardized style served to project a vision of order. He contextualizes the Inka style in terms of space, materials and manufacture, and ritual and polit­ical functions and notes that, in the Inka world, objects have agency. Elena Phipps focuses on Inka and colonial textiles, with an overview of weaving, men's and women's garments, and how provincial weavers incor­porated Inka elements into their pieces. The Inka textile style persisted into the colonial period, when it was even more widely diffused. Inka architecture is discussed by Stella Nair and Jean-Pierre Protzen. They cover style, building types, technology, infrastructure, settlements, landscapes, and the use of color as a possible code. Susan Niles explains the Inka royal estates, which include many of the famous lnka sites such as Machu Picchu. The estates embodied the Inka concept of an ordered land­scape: productive, sacred, beautiful, and built for eternity. Peter Kaulicke discusses ancestor worship, relating the ancestors, and especially the mummies of the Inka kings, to life force. The Inka king was an axis mundi and the rituals of his life cycle were related to the cycle of light and dark, the flow of water, death, and regeneration; he uses one of the royal estates, Pisac, to illustrate the con­nection between ancestral tombs, sunlight, water, and agricultural productivity. 
The fourth section of the book discusses archaeolog­ical and ethnohistoric information from the provinces. Martti Parssinen examines Collasuyu, one of the four divisions of the empire. He discusses the boundaries of this division and argues for a somewhat earlier conquest

of the area than traditionally accepted. Archaeological evidence shows that the Inka also penetrated further into the eastern lowlands than previously known. He argues that the Titicaca basin was the source of significant archi­tectural, ceramic, and cultural influence on the Inka. Frances Hayashida and Natalia Guzman examine the Inka presence on the north coast of Peru. Noting that the presence of Inka style objects tells us little about the nature of Inka control in any area, they explain that the long tradition of complex societies on the north coast allowed the Inka to appropriate existing infrastructure, such as state ceramic workshops, which then continued to produce local styles as well as Inka pottery. Inge Schjellerup focuses on Chachapoyas, on the northeastern frontier of the empire. This area of tropical rainforest was heavily impacted by the Inkas, in part because of the rich economic resources: exotic animals, feathers, coca leaf, hallucinogens, gold, and salt. Although the Chachapoya resisted the Inka, there is little evidence that the Inca resettled foreign garrisons in Chachapoyas. Tamara Bray discusses the far northern frontier of the empire, again arguing that the conquest was somewhat earlier than traditionally thought. Resistance was fierce here, as evidenced by the numerous fortifications. She discusses the pre-Inka cultures, the Inka administrative sites, and the Spanish conquest. 
In the final section of the book, TetsuyaAmino shows how perceptions of the Inka changed during the colonial and republican periods. From early characterizations as either cruel tyrants or generous rulers, the Inka came to be seen as a symbol of indigenousness and then a concept akin to a life force. 
There is duplication of general information in many chapters. At the same time, specific themes such as craft production and military organization do not have chap­ters devoted to them, but information about them is spread across several chapters. The comprehensiveness of the bibliographies is variable: some cover the main sources, while others are more extensive. Some chapters conclude with suggestions for further research. Every chapter has insights valuable to experts in the field, but the book could also serve as a selection of readings for a course on the Inka or as a coffee-table book for the public. 
Archaeology and Bioarchaeology of Population Move­ment among the Prehispanic Maya.ANDREA CU CINA, editor. 2015. Springer, New York. xiii+l59 pp. $54.99 (softcover), $39.99 (ebook) ISBN 978-3-319-10857-5.

This is a slim volume of 13 papers in which archaeolo­gists and bioarchaeologists are expected to investigate the movements of population, but which really deal more widely with population dynamics and only possible movements in several cases. This is an English version, updated, of a Spanish publication whose title gives, in my opinion, a more accurate indication of what these papers contain than the English title. In Spanish, it is bio­logical affinities and population dynamics based on mul­tiple methods that are discussed, not just movements. It appears to be the inaugural volume of Springer Briefs in Archaeology, and the articles are brief, perhaps too much so for those who are not specialists. Thus, this is not an introduction to the methods and sites, but a summary of pertinent recent studies about dynamics in the Maya area from the Preclassic to Postclassic. A main criticism is that these can be too brief and try to pack too much infor­mation into a few printed pages. 
Once one gets beyond the misdirection of the title, there are valuable papers. In a limited review, obviously not all 13 can be discussed in any depth. The first three chapters are about the changes in trade networks and cultural influences during the Classic period that are indi­cated by chronological ceramic complexes in Xcambo, Yucatan (Sierra Sosa), Calakmul region (Dominguez Carrasco and Folan), and U sumac in ta Basin and various Gulf Coast sites (Jimenez Alvarez). Changes in ceramics do not necessarily indicate significant population move­ments, as the chapters indicate. 
The rest of the chapters are more clearly about poten­tial population movements. Calakmul is also the subject for Folan and colleagues (Chapter 4), who briefly sum­marize the rise and fall, political as well as of population, of this major Maya site. The researchers tie the history to climate stability and the ability to conserve water, which then failed in the drought aroundA.D. 800 at the end of the Terminal Classic. Making conclusions that have become more widely accepted, Rafael Cobos (Chapter 5) disputes that the history of Yucatan and Chichen Itza in the Terminal Classic and Early Postclas­sic reflected the incursions of Toltecs and Nahuatized Maya foreigners. Instead, archaeology indicates that there were no large-scale population movements, but rather changes originating with local Maya. 
Starting with Allen Ortega's Chapter 6, skeletons become the dominant evidence. Using mostly paleode­mographic evidence, without delving too deeply into its strengths and weaknesses, Ortega sets up how migration should be defined and a framework to find migratory patterns. Then there are three chapters that use dental nonmetric traits, the ASU system, to find populational continuity or possible foreigners. A look at the region using 18 skeletal samples (Cucina) finds complicated dynamics. Inland Peten clusters together, in contrast with coastal and northern populations, which show continuity from Classic to Postclassic periods.
