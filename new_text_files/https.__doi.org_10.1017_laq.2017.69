Contrariamente a Sugiyama et al., las fechas de radiocarbono de la Pirámide del Sol no signi.can que la Pirámide fue construida más tarde que las estimaciones actuales indican, ni que la cronología cerámica de Teotihuacan debería ser cambiada. 
I
thank Sugiyama and her colleagues for the opportunity to debate events at the Sun Pyra­mid (POS) and, more generally, radiocarbon and ceramic chronologies. Two structures are involved: the POS, excavated by Sugiyama and colleagues; and the arti.cial cave beneath it, explored by the Teotihuacan Mapping Project (TMP). Different interpretations involve four datasets: POS radiocarbon dates, POS ceramics, cave ceramics, and cave radiocarbon dates. I con­sider all the data and hypothesize that they re.ect construction and evolving use over roughly 200 years (ca. AD 50–250). Sugiyama and colleagues reject some dates. They propose that only con­struction is represented and that the POS was built about AD 170–310. Their comment clari.es that they seek to redate Tzacualli phase ceramics by shifting the Teotihuacan ceramic chronology forward to be in line with their interpretation of six POS dates. 
The Tzacualli ceramic phase is traditionally dated 
to 
AD 
1–150. 
Cowgill 
(2015:9–10) 
sug­
gests that Tzacualli was perhaps even shorter, about AD 1–100. In contrast, Sugiyama and colleagues propose that the Tzacualli phase is much later. They would begin it 20–70 years after its accepted ending. For them, Tzacualli ends around the time of the third to fourth century tran­sition. This breezes through the Miccaotli and Early Tlamimilolpa phases, whose legitimacy they accept, and lands in the time frame currently assigned by Millon, Rattray, and Cowgill to Late Tlamimilolpa. 
Assigning years to a ceramic chronology requires knowledge not only of the culture to which it applies but also important comparative data about other cultures whose own ceramic chronologies are affected. At Teotihuacan, the proposed change challenges the Bayesian analy­sis of 33 dates by Beramendi-Orosco and col­leagues 
(2009) 
that 
contributed 
to 
shortening Cowgill’s chronology, as well as other radiocar­bon dates that have associated ceramics (e.g., Manzanilla and López Luján 2001). 
Outside 
Teotihuacan, it disorganizes ceramic chronology concordances with other Mesoamerican cultures, including those in the Basin of Mexico, Oaxaca (see Rattray 1991:8), 
and 
the 
Maya 
region 
(e.g., 
Braswell 2003). 
A 
proposed 
change 
at 
Teoti­
huacan therefore requires collaborating evidence from other parts of the city and from many other sites. 
Inside the cave, Sugiyama and colleagues discuss “tertiary” contexts of dated charcoal. Methods of selection for dating and of con­struction of a contextual model are presented in Sload 
(2007, 
2015:225, 
228–230,

Material). The nearly .nished report of TMP

LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY 	[Vol. 29, No. 2, 2018 
work in the cave will provide more rebuttal. Here I note that since the old wood effect pertains to the sample itself, not its context, it is not a valid reason to discard a class of cave dates de.ned by context. 
Within the POS, Sugiyama and colleagues obtained seven samples for two time frames. One date agrees with POS ceramics (Sugiyama et al. 2013:425). 
Its 
context 
was 
reevaluated, 
decided to be possibly “tertiary,” and so the date was eliminated (Sugiyama et al. 2013:425). 
The 
remaining six cluster well, and so are used to date POS construction and realign the Tzacualli phase. The appearance is that a subset of POS dates drove interpretation of the POS and cave. 
If all radiocarbon dates from the POS and cave are accepted, the pyramid .ts into a broader explanation that includes a mid-third-century termination of the cave (Sload 2007). 
The 
timing 
accords with exterior architectural modi.cations to the POS: addition of the fourth and .fth cuerpos (as reconstructed) and construction of the adosada platform. With the publication of six contemporaneous dates from the interior of the pyramid on the east–west centerline, I hypothesize tunneling into the POS as part of a grand plan to terminate the mountain cave and rededicate it without the cave (Sload 2015). 

Two puzzling “structures” were found within the POS. Interpreted as “pre-Sun Pyramid” in construction date (Sugiyama et al. 2013), 
sup­
porting data are equivocal. Carbon burned in situ on top of one, a .oor section, produced two of the six clustered dates. Context implies two possibilities for the age of the .oor: it may be earlier than the burning, or it may be contemporaneous. The other structure, a wall with connected .oor section, is oriented to Teotihuacan north. As Sugiyama and colleagues (2013:415) 
note, 
structures 
along 
the 
Street 
of 
the 
Dead known to predate the POS have different orientations. Teotihuacan north is believed to have originated with construction of the POS and planning of at least the northern half of the cere­monial avenue (Millon 1973:52). 
Sugiyama 
and 
colleagues 
(2013) 
provide 
no 
evidence 
that 
the 
“structure” was pre-pyramid. Thus, both features may relate to later hypothesized tunneling (Sload 2015). 

The 
scenario 
presented 
in 
Sload 
(2015)is 
a hypothesis. I believe it is less arbitrary than Sugiyama and colleagues’ and accounts for more evidence (Fogelin 2007). 
It 
maintains 
the 
Teoti­
huacan ceramic chronology, reconciles all cave and POS radiocarbon dates, and is in accord with cave and POS ceramics. In so doing, the basic story regarding the timing and trajectory of the growth of Teotihuacan is maintained.
