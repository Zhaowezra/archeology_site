AN ANALYSIS OF pXRF OBSIDIAN SOURCE ATTRIBUTIONS 
FROM TIKAL, GUATEMALA 

Hattula Moholy-Nagy, James Meierhoff, Mark Golitko, and Caleb Kestle 
Portable X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (pXRF) was used to obtain source determinations for 2,235 obsidian artifacts. These were supplemented by 48 previously published results made by X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (XRF) and instru­mental neutron activation analysis (INAA) to bring the total sample to 2,283 . Thirteen geological sources have been iden­tified by instrument to date. Three sources in Highland Guatemala accounted for nearly 98 percent of all attributions, with approximately 2 percent from 10 green and gray obsidian sources in central Mexico. Geological sources can be brought into cultural context by examining their distributions among types of artifacts, recovery contexts, structure group types, dis­tance from the Classic period epicenter of the city, and chronological relationships. Several procurement systems operated to import obsidian cores and other artifacts. Consumers obtained obsidian artifacts primarily through marketplace exchange, but other kinds of distribution are also indicated. The reliability, portability, rapidity, ease of use, non-destructive nature, and relatively low cost of pXRF show promise for the acquisition of the source attributions needed to construct the past cul­tural contexts of obsidian procurement and use. This method produces results comparable to those obtained by other kinds of instrumental analysis, and with a considerably higher degree of reliability than visual determinations. 
Presentamos y discutimos atributos de yacimientos geologicos de 2,235 artefactos de obsidiana del sitio de Tikal obtenidos por medio de un instrumento portatil de espectrometr(afluorescente (pXRF). lncluimos tambien otros 48 resultados instru­mentales publicados previamente, sumando un total de 2,283 muestras. De los 13 yacimientos identificados en este analisis, casi el 98 por ciento provinieron de los tres sitios en el altiplano de Guatemala mas cercanos a Tikal. Casi el 91 por ciento del total son de un solo yacimiento, El Chayal. Alrededor del 2 por ciento son de 11 yacimientos de obsidianas grises y verdes del centro de Mexico; algunos de estos se ubican a mas de 1,000 km-aire de Tikal. Un total de 556 artefactos de obsidiana verde de Mexico forman el uno por ciento de los aproximadamente 50,000 objetos de obsidiana registrados de Tikal. Una base de datos de esta magnitud proveniente de un solo sitio permite el examen de los artefactos identificados como materiales culturales en lugar de solo muestras geologicas. Al estudiar la distribucion de yacimientos de obsidiana entre tipos de arte­
factos, contextos de recuperacion, tipos de grupos de construcciones, la distancia desde el centro de la ciudad, y los cambios de yacimientos a traves del tiempo, podemos situar la importacion y empleo de la obsidiana en su contexto cultural pasado. El metodo de analisis pXRF es portdtil,facil, rdpido, exacto y relativamente economico . Ademds, su naturaleza no-destruc­tiva presenta un considerable potencial para la adquisicion de muestras grandes para atribuciones de yacimientos. Este metodo puede rapida y economicamente producir resultados comparables a los obtenidos por otros metodos de analisis instrumen­tales y con mucho mds precision que las determinaciones visuales. 
0bsidian has been characterized as an ideal portable X-ray fluorescence (pXRF) of a large 
material for geochemical source attribu­sample of 2,235 obsidian artifacts from the pre­
tion because of the homogeneity of indi­Columbian site of Tikal, Guatemala (Supplemen­vidual geological sources and the chemical tal Table 1). We have also included 55 previously variation between them, which can be detected by published source determinations made by XRF instrument (e.g., Glascock 2002:2).

seven of which were reattributed in the present study, which brings the total to 2,283 determina­tions. Additionally, 13 artifacts sourced by pXRF were subsequently reanalyzed by NAA as a fur­ther control. 
The artifacts reported here were excavated in the 1960s by the Tikal Project of the University of Pennsylvania Museum. This large database of sources makes it possible to conceptualize the sourced artifacts as part ofTikal 's past cultural sys­tem, ratherthan as a batch of geological specimens. Here we present the distributions of identified obsidian sources among artifact type, recovery con­text, type of associated structure group, distance from the Classic period center of the city, and how these changed through time. The large body of source attributions made by pXRF generally sup­ports previously presented models of obsidian pro­curement and use that have been advanced for Tikal and the Maya Lowlands. It also offers new infor­mation that suggests that these models should be modified to encompass the variability indicated by the obsidian sources identified at Tikal. 
Obsidian Sources Identified at Tikal 
Tikal, situated in the Department of El Peten, Guatemala (Figure 1), was a major capital of the Maya Lowlands during the Classic period, ca. A.D. 250-870. From the time of its initial settlement in the Early Middle Preclassic period until its aban­donment in the tenth century A .D. (Table 1), the city imported a wide range of durable and perishable materials over regional and long-distance exchange networks. Among the most archaeologically promi­nent of these imports was obsidian from the high­lands of Guatemala and central Mexico. 
Excavations by the Tikal Project recovered con­siderable quantities of worked obsidian, most of it deposited during the time of the Classic period Manik, Ik, and Imix ceramic complexes (Table 1) (Culbert 1993). Over 50,000 artifacts, more than 80 percent of which were blade-production deb­itage, were recorded and published, with unknown but large quantities encountered in the field that were neither recovered nor recorded (E. M. Shook, personal communication to Braswell 1984, in Braswell 2010:135; Moholy-Nagy 1997:304). A major flaw in the original lab methods was the fail­ure to weigh recovered items of material culture, which would have been especially important in the case of accumulations of lithic debitage that were too large to count. 
As long ago as the 1930s, excavators in the Maya Lowlands visually distinguished two kinds of obsidian: gray, actually ranging in appearance

from almost colorless to black, and green, which 
was much less common. It was widely assumed that 
the green obsidian was of central Mexican origin 
(e.g., Kidder 1947:10), and this assumption was 
confirmed by early obsidian trace-element analy­
ses in the 1960s (Jack and Heizer 1968; Stross et 
al. 1968:Table 2). So far, the correlation between 
green obsidian and sources in the highlands of cen­
tral Mexico has held up well for Mesoamerica as 
a whole, and for the purposes of this paper we have 
assumed that all of the green obsidian found at 
Tikal is of central Mexican origin. 
On the other hand, visual characteristics of the 
various kinds of gray obsidians used for artifacts 
in the Maya area do not match up in a consistent 
manner with the chemical composition of their 
sources, either in the highlands of Guatemala or 
areas beyond. Although visual identification is non­
destructive, rapid, decidedly inexpensive, and can 
be carried out anywhere, it cannot discriminate reli­
ably between different gray Mesoamerican sources 
(e.g., Carballo et al. 2007:36-37; Jackson and Love 
1991 :Tables 1 and 3; Knight and Glascock 
2009: 514-518, Table 2; Moholy-Nagy 2003a; 
Santley and Barrett 2002:Table 8.2; especially 
Braswell et al. 2011: 143, Table 1). Visual sourcing 
is essentially conservative, constrained by the prior 
experience of the analyst. Additionally, results of 
a test by Braswell et al. (2000:Table 3) on a sam­ple where only three sources were present show that visual determinations are not reproducible, even among experienced analysts. Gray Mesoamerican obsidians can only be reliably attributed to source by instrument. 
We began to submit artifacts for instrument attri­bution in the 1960s (Moholy-Nagy 1975; Stross et 
al. 1968), but the early analyses could not dis­
criminate sufficiently between sources to be use­ful to this discussion. In 1978, using improved techniques of both XRF and NAA, we were able to analyze 26 obsidian artifacts (Moholy-Nagy et al. 1984), and then in 1981 another 29 (Moholy­Nagy and Nelson 1990). These 55 results estab­lished the presence at Tikal of the three major Highland Guatemalan sources of EI Chaya!, San Martin Jilotepeque (SMJ), and Ixtepeque, green obsidian from the central Mexican sources of Pachuca and Tulancingo, and five gray central Mexican sources. In addition to these known sources, three analyzed artifacts could not be attrib­uted to any source. These two data sets also revealed that the two most numerous gray Mexican sources present at Tikal, Otumba, and Zaragoza, occurred 
in translucent and opaque varieties (Supplemental Table 2). 
In 2010, the opportunity arose to analyze a much larger sample ofTikal obsidian artifacts by pXRF. We selected 2,235 artifacts from a study collection assembled by Lilita Bergs for an analysis of blade production methods. Seven of the 55 previously run artifacts were reanalyzed by pXRF. In all cases the results obtained by pXRF reassuringly matched those obtained earlier by XRF and NAA. We have included the remaining 48 previously run XRF and NAA instrumental attributions in this analysis in order to present a more di verse set of artifact types. 
The attributed sources discussed in this paper are probably not a representative sample of what was brought to Tikal. Although our total sample of instrumental attributions is the largest such data­base published to date for the Maya area, it com­prises less than four percent of the total number of obsidian artifacts recorded from the site. The data and hypotheses presented here could still be sig­nificantly modified by future research. More impor­tantly, the sample Bergs selected was made for a different purpose than source attribution, and we emphasized certain aspects of it, such as artifacts from the more remote areas of the site and debitage 
from special deposits from the center, which skewed the results toward the very high percent­age of El Chayal obsidian. Only a small proportion of rare and secondarily worked artifacts, such as the ceremonial lithics, thin bifaces, and ground and polished obsidian objects, were analyzed. It is pos­sible that analyzing more thin bifaces would have

identified more Mexican sources. Accordingly, we feel that the presence of sources and their distrib­utions among the selected variables is more sig­nificant than their absence or their percentages in the results. 
The 2010 pXRF analysis identified 13 geolog­ical sources. The three major Highland Guatemalan sources were present, with El Chayal accounting for by far the most attributions. Seven sources were located in central Mexico: Otumba, Pachuca, Zaragoza, Ucareo, Zacualtipan, Tulancingo, and Pared6n. Two artifacts were provisionally attrib­uted to the Mexican sources of Fuentezuelas and Tequila. Three artifacts were attributed to the La Esperanza source in western Honduras. 
One central Mexican source previously identi­fied at Tikal that did not appear in this most recent analysis was Zinapecuaro (Moholy-Nagy et al. 1984), which brought the total number of sources identified by instrument to 14. Additionally, a fine blade and two thin bifaces could not be assigned by the 1978 and 1981 analyses, raising the possi­bility that other non-Guatemalan sources could be present. Bergs did not select them for her study, so they could not be included in the pXRF analysis. 
In 2012 we submitted 13 artifacts of the sam­ple analyzed by pXRF to Michael D. Glascock at the Archaeometry Laboratory at the Missouri Uni­versity Research Reactor facility (MURR) for analysis by NAA. This group included the artifacts provisionally attributed to Fuentezuelas and Tequila, and two of the three artifacts attributed to La Esperanza (Supplemental Table 2). The pres­ence of obsidian from Fuentezuelas was confirmed. The artifact provisionally attributed to Tequila could not be attributed to any known source by either short-irradiation NAA or long-irradiation NAA. Two of the three artifacts from La Esperanza were reassigned to the Cerro Varal source in Michoacan, and we have assumed that the third arti­fact is from there as well. We note that the misat­tribution of the Cerro Varal source was due to the lack of geological reference material and was not a result of pXRF method. The pXRF attributions were confirmed for the nine other artifacts (Michael 
D. Glascock, personal communication 2012). Of the total of 20 artifacts analyzed by both pXRF and NAA, 17 attributions were verified. We feel con­fident that pXRF can reliably identify the most uti­lized Highland Guatemalan and central Mexican sources found at Lowland Maya sites. Most impor­tantly, the high rate of successful attributions that can be achieved by pXRF can be achieved by any­one who learns the method.Attributions are objec­tive and, therefore, reproducible. 

Although the actual number of artifacts of non­Guatemalan sources reported from the Maya Low­lands is very small, their presence is significant as a kind of tracer that connects sources to sites and sites to each other, as well as points up relation­ships of sources to different types of artifacts, recov­ery contexts, and intrasite distribution systems. These rare sources have cultural implications and efforts should be made to determine the kinds of exchange networks that brought them to the Maya Lowlands (Braswell et al. 2011:142). Reliable source attributions are the essential foundation for such research. 
The distributions of 13 identified sources are summarized on Tables 2-6. We have also included the total of 556 green obsidian artifacts recorded by the Tikal Project. Nearly all were classified visu­ally, but they are of interest here because they com­prise the most conspicuous component of the non-Guatemalan obsidian brought to the site. Instrumental analysis assigned 16 of the total to Pachuca and three flakes, possibly all from the same thin biface, to Tulancingo. 
Method and Source Assignment 
Portable X-ray Fluorescence 
All obsidian samples were run in unmodified form on an Innov-X Alpha series portable X-ray fluo­rescence device at the Field Museum Elemental Analysis Facility (EAF)1 (Golitko et al. 2010; Meierhoff et al. 2010; Millhauser et al. 2011), tak­ing care to analyze flat areas that fully covered the instrument aperture. The EAF instrument uses a tungsten anode to excite samples, with data col­lected using a Si-PIN diode detector at an energy resolution of less than 230 EV FWHM at the 5 .95 Ke V Mn Ka line. The instrument was set to "soils" mode and all samples were run for 90s on "heavy elements mode" ( 40 Ke V, 20µA beam) and 90s on "light elements mode" (15 KeV ) to generate ele­mental concentrations for 10 elements (K, Ca, Ti, Mn, Fe, Zn, Rb, Sr, Zr, and Nb) using the funda­mental parameters program provided by the instru-

ment manufacturer to generate initial concentration values. Values for these elements were then cor­rected using measurements of obsidian pieces from the Sierra de Pachuca (Mexico), Glass Buttes (Ore­gon), Wekwok (ANU2000-Lou Island, Papua New Guinea) and Kutua/Bao (ANU9000-New Britain, Papua New Guinea) obsidian sources, all of which have been repeatedly measured at other laboratories using several methods (Glascock 1999; Reepmeyer et al. 2011). These pieces were run at the beginning and end of each day of analysis. Mean values and standard deviations are listed in Supplemental Table 3. Precision for most measured elements across repeated measurements is less than five percent (K, Ca, Mn, Fe, Rb, Sr, Zr), and between five and fifteen percent for others (Ti, Zn, Nb), except in pieces for which concentrations are near to detection limits. 
Instrumental Neutron Activation Analysis 
Although NAA is a destructive analytical technique that relies on irradiating a portion of the artifact with neutrons, it has the advantages of measuring a large number of trace elements present at low concen­trations and at very high precision. NAA is capa­ble of use on very small obsidian samples (e.g., 5 mg) without bias due to mass. Because the Archaeometry Lab at MURR already has a com­prehensive NAA database for the Mesoamerica sources, the confidence level for source assign­ments in the region is very high (Glascock 2011; Glascock et al. 2010). 
Two different NAA procedures have been devel­oped at MURR for obsidian source determination (Glascock 1993; Glascock et al. 1998). The first procedure is referred to as the short-irradiation NAA method, and it can be used to measure up to seven elements with short half-lives. If the results from the short-irradiation NAA method are suc­cessful, further analysis may not be necessary. However, if the results from short-irradiation are inconclusive, the long-irradiation procedure can be used to measure 21-22 additional elements. In almost every previous study, a combination of short-and long-irradiation NAA gave a unique provenance result with a very high degree of con­fidence. Samples were prepared for short-NAA by using a trim saw to remove about 100 mg from the artifact while minimizing the damage to the remain­ing part of the artifact. After sawing, the samples 
were prepared for short-NAA by weighing into 2/5 dram polyvials. Sample weights were recorded to the nearest .01 mg. Samples were then sequentially irradiated for five seconds in a neutron flux of 8x1013 neutrons/cm2/s. After a decay of 25 min­utes to allow the radioisotope 28Al (2.24 minute half-life) to decrease to a safe level for handling and measurement, the samples were counted for 12 minutes to measure the emitted gamma rays with a high-purity germanium spectrometer. The ele­ments measured include: Al, Ba, Cl, Dy, K, Mn, and Na. Standard samples made from SRM-278 were similarly prepared and measured. Concen­trations in parts per million measured by NAA are determined by ratioing the measured counts per second per milligram to those for the standards with corrections for the different decay times. Most of the elements that can be measured by N AA have uncertainties of about two to three percent (Michael 
D. Glascock, personal communication 2012). 
Source Identification 
Hierarchical cluster analysis (Figure 2) of the pXRF chemical data identified 13 separate chem­ical signatures within the obsidian pieces analyzed (see Supplemental Table 3 for mean and standard deviation values). Separation between these 13 chemical groups is displayed on Figure 3, a bivari­ate plot of manganese and iron concentrations. While groups 3, 5, and 6 overlap when consider­ing only Mn and Fe, they are clearly distinct on a bivariate plot of zirconium and rubidium concen­trations (Figure 4). Furthermore, the single sam­ple comprising group 5 has a Sr concentration below the detection limits of the instrument (-10 ppm), in contrast to pieces included in groups 3 and 6, all of which have Sr concentrations greater than 100 ppm. 
As the EAF does not possess a comprehensive collection of samples for geological sources in Mesoamerica, comparison was made using cor­rected group mean values for the 13 identified chemical groups and published INAA and XRF data for known obsidian sources in central Mexico and Guatemala (Glascock 2011; Glascock and Cobean 2002), both by hierarchical cluster analy­sis (between-groups method using squared pair­wise Euclidean distances) and direct comparison of measured values for K, Ti, Mn, Fe, Zn, Rb, Sr, Zr, and Nb (Supplemental Table 3).

Figure 2. Hierarchical cluster analysis of group means for chemical groups identified by pXRF and for major central Mexican and Guatemalan obsidian sources using measured or published concentration values for K, Ti, Mn, Fe, Zn, Rb, Sr, Zr, and Nb. 

Cluster analysis (Figure 2) suggests clear matches for all but two of the identified chemical groups, including the major Guatemalan sources of El Chayal (Group 1), Ixtepeque (Group 3), and San Martfn Jilotepeque (Group 2), heavily utilized Mexican sources including Pachuca (Group 4), and Otumba (Group 6), as well as the central Mexican sources at Tulancingo (Group 13), Cerro Varal (Group 7), Ucareo (Group 11),Zacualtipan(Group 12), and Zaragoza (Group 8) (see Figure 1). The cluster analysis does not resolve potential matches between the single obsidian piece included in Group 5 and the Pared6n and Santa Elena source means. However, this piece had previously been assigned to the Pared6n source by NAAin the 1981 study. Group 9 is tentatively linked to the Zinaparo source by the cluster analysis, but inspection of actual concentration values indicates that this is a tenuous match. Group 10 is weakly linked to the El Parafso and Penjamo sources in the cluster analy­sis. However, inspection of actual concentrations suggests that this piece is more similar to published concentrations for the Fuentezuelas source. The inability ofXRF to completely distinguish between the Penjamo and Fuentezuelas sources has been noted previously (Glascock 2011). 
To confinn source assignments made by pXRF and identify the sources ofunassigned samples, 13 pieces were submitted for INAA at MURR. Short­irradiation INAA results confirm source assign­ments to the El Chayal, San Martin Jilotepeque, and Otumba sources. Two artifacts assigned to La Esperanza were attributed to Cerro Varal. Addi­tionally, the single piece comprising Group 10 was conclusively assigned to the Fuentezuelas source by short-INAA (Figure 5). Short-and long-irradi­ation IN AA indicates that the single piece included in Group 9, which had been tentatively assigned to

the Tequila source, did not originate there or at the Zinaparo source, and could not be conclusively linked to any other known source (Michael D. Glas­cock, personal communication 2012). The two most chemically similar sources, Osotero ( J alisco) or Valle del Azufre (Baja), are unlikely to have been available to the residents of Tikal based on prior information on the distribution of material from there. 
Artifact Types and Obsidian Sources 

The obsidian artifact inventory of Tikal consists of finished artifacts and debitage.Approximately 77.4 percent of it is debitage that was recorded, nearly all of it from the production of blades. Locally pro­duced finished artifact types include blades (15.7 percent), blade cores and still-recognizable core fragments (3.7 percent), eccentrics and incised obsidians (2 .5 percent), and much smaller numbers of perforators, scrapers, and small points (arrow­heads) edge-retouched from blades and flakes, and artifacts of ground and polished obsidian. Thin bifaces, nearly all of which appear to have been imports, account for about .5 percent. 
Although rare blades occur in the earliest recov­ery contexts, blade production debitage cannot be firmly dated until the Early Late Preclassic period. Tikal obtained all or nearly all of its obsidian in the form of large polyhedral cores (LPCs), which were reduced into blades by local craft specialists (Clark 1997; Clark and Lee 1979; Sheets 1975). Only one LPC has been identified so far (Moholy-Nagy 2003b: Figure 69a), which may have been part of an offering exterior to Burial 10, a middle Early Classic chamber burial (Coe 1990:479-487). How­ever, the former presence of LPCs, at least during the Classic period, is clearly attested by the sizes and forms of obsidian eccentrics, incised obsidi­ans, and debitage (Moholy-Nagy 2003b:31-33, Figures 69a-d, 71, 72). The scarcity of cortex on debitage and finished artifacts indicates that all obsidian that reached Tikal had been worked to some extent.

But before blades could be produced from them, LPCs, particularly those from the El Chaya! source, had to be trimmed to the proper shape by percussion flaking, and then blades were detached by pressure flaking. The sources, quantities, and types of recorded debitage show that LPCs from different sources arrived in different stages of production. Cores from sources other than El Chaya! apparently required little or no additional trimming before blades could be detached from them. Clark (1997:114, Figure 4C-E, G-1; Clark and Bryant 1997 :Figure 6C-E) distinguished three series of ini­tial or outermost pressure blades, ls, 2s, and 3s, which were usually discarded. These are grouped together here and tabulated as outer blades. Contin­ued pressure flaking produced fine blades, the desired product that actually reached consumers. Tikal fine blades are characterized by a regular, stan­dardized shape (e.g., Moholy-Nagy 2003b:Figure 72e). In the typology he proposed for debitage gen­erated by blade production, Clark did not specifically define a fine blade taxon because he was working 
with discarded debitage from which the fine blades had been removed. However, a reexamination of blades for this paper identified a few 3s blades (e.g., Moholy-Nagy 2003b:Figure 72c) in contexts that indicated that they also reached consumers. Many blades recovered from Tikal were no longer avail­able for study, but the numberof circulated 3s blades is probably small. They are of interest, however, in suggesting that not all 3s blades were discarded. 
The amount of blade production debitage encountered at Tikal is impressive. For example, Coe (1990:607) estimated that approximately a quarter of a ton of obsidian "scrap" was deposited together with about a ton of chert debitage exte­rior to Burial 116, the Late Late Classic chamber burial found beneath Temple I (Structure 5D-1). Several other debitage deposits associated with chamber burials and cached offerings were also very large (Moholy-Nagy 1997). During the Clas­sic period, Tikal appears to have imported obsid­ian on a much larger scale than any other site in the core area of the Maya Lowlands, but at pre-

sent there is little published comparative data from 
other sites in its vicinity. 
The attributed samples from these massive 
deposits are almost entirely from the EI Chayal 
source (Table 2). The costs of transporting a sub­
stantial amount of ultimately discarded weight over 
hundreds of kilometers, the additional labor 
required of the local blade producers to trim the 
LPCs into cores from which blades could be 
detached, and the planning and effort needed to dis­
pose of the production waste all entailed high costs. Yet the organizers of this aspect of Tikal's obsid­ian procurement found it worth their while to oper­ate this way for centuries, from the Terminal Preclassic period, when the first large subterranean debitage deposits appear, until almost to the end of the Late Classic period. 
Debitage also includes corrections of knapping errors, rare bipolar cores, and flakes and otherwise unidentifiable chunks created by reworking exhausted cores and salvaging broken finished arti­
facts. Sourced examples of these types of debitage 
were also overwhelmingly of El Chayal obsidian. 
Rare outer blades and core fragments of Mexican 
obsidian indicate that at least some of it was reduced 
into blades at Tikal. 
Complete exhausted cores, attributed exclu­
sively to El Chayal at present, are uncommon. The 
absence so far of recognizable blade cores and core 
fragments of sources other than El Chayal and Pachuca might be explained by the practice, com­mon in Mesoamerica, of breaking up exhausted cores (Parry 2002:41). The purpose of smashing cores into small fragments is not known. However, pulverized obsidian, which has a hardness of about six on the Moh's scale (Loomis 1923:20, 191), approximately the same as powdered glass abra­sives, might have been used as an abrasive and pol­ishing agent in lapidary work. It would be worthwhile to test this notion experimentally. Pul­verized obsidian would be difficult to detect in 
archaeological context.

Incised obsidians and some obsidian eccentrics were produced on macroblades and macroflakes struck directly from LPCs (e.g., Moholy-Nagy 2008:Figure 51), while the majority of eccentrics were thriftily worked on exhausted blade cores (e.g., Moholy-Nagy 2008:Figure 38). El Chayal was the only source identified among 42 eccentrics and four incised obsidians, which supports a behavioral link between these elite ceremonial arti­facts and the predominantly utilitarian prismatic blade industry. 
Obsidian thin bifaces (bifacially formed dart or spear points and knives) and rare eccentrics of Mex­ican style were apparently brought to Tikal as fin­ished artifacts. Of 24 thin bifaces of gray obsidian that could be attributed to a source, only two were of Guatemalan (lxtepeque) obsidian; the others were of obsidian from several Mexican sources and were of types found in central Mexico (Iglesias 2003 :Fig­ure 6.5; Moholy-Nagy 2003b: Figures 64-68h; Moholy-Nagy et al. l 984:Figure 1; Tolstoy 1971:Figures2 and 3). At present, no identifications by instrument of thin bifaces of El Chayal or SMJ obsidian have been published. Unlike in the case of the ceremonial lithics, we cannot postulate a behav­ioral link between thin biface production and blade production, as has been suggested, e.g., for Teoti­huacan (Andrews 2002: 51). Nor, in contrast to the chert thin bifaces found at Tikal, have we been able to identify evidence of local production of obsidian thin bifaces. At present, it appears that thin bifaces of central Mexican type and central Mexican sources were produced in Mexico. The rare exam­ples of Ixtepeque obsidian may have come from Papalhuapa, a production site near that source (Gra­ham and Heizer 1968:Plates 3 and 4). 
Broad blades are blades with cross sections more than 2.0 cm in width (Moholy-Nagy 2003b:Figure 70a-b; Moholy-Nagy and Nelson 1990:Figure 2k­l). They are rare. Six examples were attributed to the El Chaya), Pachuca, and Zaragoza sources, sug­gesting that they could have been imported in fin­ished form, as well as made locally. 
El Chayal was the only source identified among the few artifacts of ground obsidian. It had been used for an ear spool (Moholy-Nagy 2008:Figure 131 d) and for the small fragments of two uniden­tifiable artifacts. 
Of the 556 green obsidian artifacts recorded by the Tikal Project, 440 or almost 80 percent were fine blades (Table 2). There were also 79 thin bifaces (14.2 percent), 10 eccentrics (1.8 percent) of central Mexican style (which had probably been imported in finished form), and a smattering of other types and debitage. The artifacts attributed to the Tulancingo source were small flakes that may have come from refurbishing the same thin biface. They were a darker green and less translucent than the typical golden green obsidian from the Pachuca source. We did not keep complete records of the visual characteristics of excavated green obsidian, but transparent yellow green without inclusions appeared to be the most common. Sierra de Pachuca obsidian comes in several colors and qualities, only some of which were suitable for artifacts (Pastrana 2002:21-22; Ponomarenko 2004). 
The distribution of obsidian sources among arti­fact types supported previously established ideas about the predominance of the three Highland Guatemalan sources in the prismatic blade indus­try. The El Chaya] source accounted for nearly all of the blades and blade-making debitage analyzed. The behavioral link between blade production and ceremonial lithics was also confirmed. Fragments of a small ground-and-polished earflare and two unidentifiable objects of ground obsidian were also sourced to El Chayal, which suggests local production. Obsidian sources from central Mex­ico, including green obsidian, were most fre­quently represented among thin bifaces and fine blades, i.e., among artifacts of primarily utilitar­ian function. 
The pXRF analysis supports what has been commented upon elsewhere, namely, "Different categories of artifacts or resources contrast in use, use-lives, depositional frequencies and contexts, symbolism, weight and fragility, and circulation" (Stark and Garraty 2010: 48; also Moholy-Nagy 2003a). The Lowland Maya imported obsidian for artifacts with specific quotidian and special func­tions, uses, and meanings (Carballo 2007: 180), not as geological samples. Specifying the types of arti­facts made from different sources is critical to the understanding of every aspect of obsidian pro­curement and use, organization of artifact produc­tion, correlations with different social groups, forms of distribution at the consumer site, and the man­ner in which artifacts went into archaeological con­text. Yet most published source analyses do not mention artifacttypes at all. This omission is a con-

siderable impediment to research. By now we have a general idea of which Mesoamerican obsidian sources were utilized, and where and when they were moved over the landscape. But we will make better progress in understanding how or why obsid­ian was imported if we pay closer attention to the forms in which it was procured and used. 
Recovery Contexts 

The recovery contexts of archaeological material culture often provide information about the cultural function of artifacts and the social groups who used them. Most of the obsidian recorded from Tikal was debitage from blade production that came from spe­cial deposits associated with rulers and members of the uppermost social ranks (Moholy-Nagy 1997 :Figures 2 and 3). By special deposits, we mean deposits of cultural material usually formed during a single event, or a series of events closely spaced in time. The Tikal Project classified special deposits into burials and caches, with another category, prob­lematical deposits, for various kinds of concentra­tions of materials whose past systemic function was not apparent at the time they were recorded. Although the problematical deposit category was originally thought of as provisional with the intent to determine the function of the included materials and recovery contexts through further study, over the years it has come to take on an unintended iden­tity of its own (Moholy-Nagy 2008:67-71). 
During the Classic period, blade-production debitage made up the largest collections of specially deposited obsidian. Special deposits that included debitage were found exterior to the chamber buri­als of rulers; within caches placed with stone ste­lae, temples, and range structures; in special-purpose debitage dumps; in termination ' deposits; and in various kinds of problematical deposits. Classic period caches that included obsid­ian eccentrics sometimes also contained the deb­itage from their production. Fine blades and percussion flakes occasionally occurred in burials and may have been used as bloodletters (Carballo 2009:494). Virtually all attributed samples of spe­cially deposited obsidian were from El Chayal. 
Complete exhausted cores, exclusively El Chayal at present, are relatively uncommon. Most of them were recovered from Early Classic special deposits, such as caches and exterior chamber bur­ial deposits. In these contexts, they appear to have functioned as eccentrics (e.g., Moholy-Nagy 2008: Figure 621-m). Eccentrics may have been included in the debitage deposits exterior to burials in order to singularize them (Walker 1995). 
The only special deposits that included more than three or four artifacts from sources other than El Chayal were Type 43 problematical deposits, referred to in previous publications as Burial-like Problematical Deposits or BPDs (Moholy-Nagy 1999:308-309, 2008:70). These special deposits were distinguished by human remains, including primary and secondary burials and isolated bones and fragments. Broken status goods, such as jade ornaments, worked Spondylus shells, censers, and fragments of stone monuments sometimes occur in the same deposits with broken and incomplete domestic artifacts of chert, obsidian, ground stone, bone, pottery vessels, and sometimes large quan­tities of chert and obsidian debitage and sherds (Iglesias 2003). In some of these deposits, the bro­ken artifacts and pottery show signs of burning, often after breakage. Besides El Chayal and SMJ, obsidian from Pachuca, Tulancingo, Otumba, Ucareo, Cerro Varal, and unidentified sources was also represented in small quantities (Table 3). This finding supports the notion advanced by Iglesias (2003: 170-171) that in addition to status artifacts, ordinary household goods were a major component of Type 43 PDs. Attributed obsidian artifact types included fine blades, thin bifaces, debitage, as well as rare green obsidian eccentrics of Mexican type (Moholy-Nagy 2008:Figure 34a-d). Type 43 PDs are most frequent during the middle Early Classic through Early Late Classic period, associated with the short-lived manifestation of stylistic traits inspired by Teotihuacan, the disappearance of those traits, and lasting into Tikal's hiatus in monument inscriptions (Moholy-Nagy 2003c). 
Most of the excavated items of material culture, other than lithic debitage, came from recovery con­texts referred to as general excavations. General excavation lots include surface deposits, middens composed of household trash and craft production waste, materials incorporated into construction fill, and mixed deposits. They accumulated over time through site maintenance practices, construction activities, and loss (Schiffer 1972). An important point to keep in mind is that Tikal had a long his­tory of settlement and was abandoned gradually.

Its residents constructed and demolished architec­ture and relocated portable material culture, often mixing artifacts of different dates and from differ­ent areas. Artifacts tended to move from site periph­eries towards the center and from smaller structure groups to larger ones. On the other hand, the Tikal Project's careful spatial recording and the large size of the excavated sample permit some firm infer­ences regarding the relationship of sources to recov­ery context. Although El Chayal was the most frequently identified obsidian source in all recov­ery contexts, more Mexican sources were identi­fied in general excavations and Type 43 PDs than in any other contexts. 
Relating obsidian source to recovery context confirms the association noted previously between El Chayal obsidian and elite ceremonial activities. This is especially striking in the large deposits of debitage found exterior to chamber burials and included in cached offerings placed beneath stone monuments and with temples, as well as the use of El Chaya! for elite-associated ceremonial lithics. The size of the deposits themselves indicates core and blade production on a scale that necessitated subterranean disposal (Moholy-Nagy 1997; Sant­ley and Kneebone 1993:Figures 1-3). 
Structure Group Types 

William A. Haviland proposed a classification of 
Tikal structure groups according to presumed func­
tion, size, location, presence and nature of special 
deposits, and social correlates (described in 
Moholy-Nagy 2008:4). 
Civic-Ceremonial Groups are assumed to have 
been non-residential. They served other functions, 
such as the burial places of rulers, spaces for pub­
lic ritual displays, and marketplaces. 
Range Structure Groups are regarded as the res­idences of rulers and elites of the highest social rank. Administrative functions are also implied. Elsewhere in the Maya area, range structures are usually referred to as palaces. 
Small Structure Groups are thought to have been 
residences of commoners, many of whom were 
craft specialists, including obsidian knappers. 
Intermediate Structure Groups may have been 
the residences of lesser elite and commoners of 
higher social status. 
Minor Centers had both civic-ceremonial and residential functions and are found only on the peripheries of the city. 
Here we have combined Haviland's classifica­tion with the irregular concentric Epicentral, Cen­tral, and Peripheral Areas defined by Dennis Puleston (1983:Figure 21) on the basis of structure density. 
There was little difference between residential groups in the number of attributed sources, regard­less of size and assumed social rank. A more impor­tant factor was the area in which they were located. Far fewer sources were identified from the Periph­eries than from the Epicenter or Center (Table 4). 
El Chayal predominated in all types of structure groups. Mexican obsidian was recovered from Small Structure Groups, as well as from those assumed to be of higher status. This reinforces the impression gained from its distribution in recov­ery contexts that anyone could have access to it, and that most of the artifact types made of these distant sources, prismatic blades and thin bifaces, had a predominantly utilitarian function. Obsidian itself was not an indicator of social status at Tikal, at least not during the Classic period. It was the function and meaning of the artifacts made of it that gave them their social value. 
The greatest number of obsidian sources occurred in general excavations in Central Area Small Structure Groups; the next highest number came from Epicentral Civic-Ceremonial Groups, mainly from the construction fills of the monu­
mental architecture of Group 5D-2, the North Acropolis-Great Plaza Group. 
The distribution of sources among structure group types, particularly Central Area Small Struc­ture Groups and the major Epicentral Civic-Cere­monial Group, 5D-2, reinforces the impression of a practice of recycling middens, deposits of pro­duction waste, and construction fills of residential structure groups as construction fill of monumen­tal architecture (Moholy-Nagy 1997:299). Specif­ically, this idea is supported by the large number of sources found in association with Small Struc­ture Groups 4F-1 and 4F-2 in the Central Area, which included the domestic workshops of craft specialists (Haviland 1985). 
The impression gained from the number of sources identified from Central Area Small Struc­ture Groups is that different sources were no longer distinguished from each other by the time they

reached Tikal. The co-occurrence of the same Mex­ican and Guatemalan sources used for the same types of artifacts in Epicentral and Central Area structure groups seems to conform to "the homog­enizing effect" predicted by models of marketplace exchange (Berdan et al. 2003: 101; Braswell 2003: 157, 2010: 137; Hirth 1998:455). 
Zones 

Tikal took on its final, approximately concentric settlement pattern by the end of the Classic period. To examine the effect of distance from the epicen­ter, Group 5D-2, on the distribution of material cul­ture, we superimposed a series of concentric zones on the Tikal map (Carr and Hazard 1961), centered upon Map Square SD. Zone 01 is a circle with a radius of .25 km. Zones 02 through 26 are con­centric rings, each half a km wide, which surround Zone 01 and extend outwards to the boundaries of the Tikal National Park (Moholy-Nagy 2003b:Fig­ure 161, 2008:Figure 58). As in the case of source distributions among dif­ferent types of structure groups, the occurrence of Mexican sources appears to be closely correlated to distance from the city's epicenter (Table 5). They were concentrated in Zones 01-03 and became scarce beyond Zone 03. Two green obsidian thin bifaces occurred in Zones 06 and 08, two green blades in Zones 09 and 18, and a gray thin biface sourced to Otumba was recovered in Zone 20. Beyond Zone 14 almost all obsidian was attributed to El Chaya!. The predominance of El Chayal in the outermost zones, i.e., Zones 06-26, appears to be independent of the number of lots excavated, the number of obsidian artifacts per excavated lot (Moholy-Nagy 2003b:Chart 1.2 and Appendix G, 2008: Appendix 
i 	7), the percentage of obsidian among all durable artifacts recovered from a zone, the the dates of the artifacts (Table 6), or the percentage of recovered obsidian tested (Table 7). The almost exclusive occurrence of El Chaya! would appear to contra­dict the suggestion advanced above that most types of obsidian artifacts reached consumers through marketplace exchange. The extreme scarcity of other sources, however, is similar to the marked fall-off beyond Zone 05 in the occurrence and diversity of most artifact types and may have been due to the same, still to be determined causes. 
Dates 

The dates of the attributed obsidian artifacts accounted for much of the variability in the sample (Table 6). As noted above, many of Tikal's obsid­ian artifacts came from general excavation contexts that accumulated over time and were primarily dated by the included ceramics. Much of the attributed sample could not be assigned to a single ceramic complex and could only be given an approximate date. This is, unfortunately, especially true of fine blades, nearly all of which were domestic goods and recovered from primary middens and construction fill. Artifacts from special deposits associated with carved stone monuments and architecture could often be assigned to a narrower range of dates. 
Obsidian blades were already part of Tikal's inventory of durable material culture at the time of initial settlement during the Early Middle Preclas­sic period, the time of the Eb ceramic complex. However, they were very rare, both in the excava­tions of the Tikal Project and those of the Proyecto Nacional de Tikal in the Early Middle Preclassic levels in the Mundo Perdido Group (Laporte and Valdes 1993). An incomplete obsidian blade core turned up in a Late Middle Preclassic Type 42 Prob­lematical Deposit consisting of an accumulation of broken domestic and status goods without human remains. The core cannot be taken as conclusive evidence of local blade production, however, because its context suggests that it may have been an offering and perhaps acquired in finished form from elsewhere. 
It is not until the succeeding Early Late Pre­classic period, when both fine blades and blade production debitage occur in the stratigraphically dated, sealed construction fills of Group 5D-2 (Cul­bert 2003:49-51), that we have unambiguous evi­dence for local blade production. The first appearance of green obsidian, in the form of fine blades, was during the Early Late Preclassic, but it was very rare until the middle of the Early Classic. After that, it was a minor but constant presence into the Early Postclassic. 
Both El Chayal and SMJ obsidian were brought to Tikal throughout the Late Preclassic period, with the SMJ source predominating. During the Late Late Preclassic, the time of the Cauac ceramic com­plex, El Chayal began to account for most of the obsidian brought to Tikal. Yet despite the prepon-

derance of El Chayal from then on, cores from SMJ continued to be imported throughout the Classic period and into the Terminal Classic. This was also true of Ixtepeque obsidian. Although early source analyses suggested Ixtepeque may well have been present earlier (Moholy-Nagy 1975), the earliest reliable instrumental attributions date to the Ter­minal Preclassic. After that time it occurs in small quantities throughout the Classic and Terminal Classic periods and into the Early Postclassic. Dur­ing Tikal 's later occupation somewhat more obsid­ian seems to have come from Ixtepeque than from SMJ. El Chayal dominated the fine blade industry during the millennium or so from the Late Late Pre­classic into the Terminal Classic, but at no time was it the only source imported. The coeval presence of at least two sources of obsidian also holds at other Lowland Maya sites (Moholy-Nagy 2003a:304). 
Another important development during the Ter­minal Preclassic period was the earliest known sub­terranean discard of blade production debitage.

Large quantities, accompanied by larger amounts of chert biface production debitage, were recovered from an abandoned chultun and exterior to a Ter­minal Preclassic chamber burial in Group 5D-2. The latter deposit, exterior to Burial 125 (Coe 1990:336), is the earliest associated with a royal chamber burial from Tikal so far. From the Termi­nal Preclassic until the end of the Late Classic period, large accumulations of obsidian debitage were disposed of underground, nearly always with quantities of biface production debitage of chert. 
The obsidian component of these special deposits of debitage, virtually all of it from El Chayal, indicates that the volume of debitage cre­ated by blade production had increased to the point where the household workshop middens could no longer accommodate it, and it had to go under­ground (Moholy-Nagy 1997). The increase in chipped stone artifact production may have arisen in response to local demand, such as the monu­mental architectural projects commissioned by the

elite. But it might also have been organized to sup­ply consumers in Tikal's vicinity with blade cores. The quantities of blade production debitage from El Chayal in elite-related contexts, as well as the ceremonial lithics exclusively associated with Tikal's elites, suggest that they had organized and controlled a system to import quantities of roughly fashioned LPCs for their own purposes. This sys­tem apparently operated from the Terminal Pre­classic period to the end of the Classic. 
Striking changes occurred in many aspects of Tikal durable material culture during the Early Classic period, especially noticeable during the time of the Manik 3A and Manik 3B ceramic com­plexes. There was a surge in both the quantity of obsidian and the diversity of sources brought to the site, and new artifact types appeared. One impor­tant development was the custom of including exhausted blade cores in special deposits. Soon cores in offerings were worked into a variety of eccentric forms. At present, it seems that thin bifaces of central Mexican types and made of gray and green obsidian central Mexican sources sud­denly appear at Tikal concurrent with artifacts and iconography of Teotihuacan style. Rare Teotihua­can-style eccentrics of green obsidian also appear then. Both types of artifacts may relate to the mil­itary weaponry and symbolism described for Clas­sic period Teotihuacan (Carballo 2007). No eccentrics of Mexican style have yet been found in traditional Tikal caches or burials. However, both Mexican eccentrics and thin bifaces were included in Type 43 PDs (Moholy-Nagy 1999). While it is difficult to say much about the span of use of the rare Mexican eccentrics, at least half of which came from general excavations, obsidian thin bifaces continued to be used as projectile points and knives throughout the entire Late Classic and into the Ter­minal Classic period. 
Gray Mexican sources were also fashioned into fine blades by the middle Early Classic period. A few fragments of debitage (Supplemental Table 2) suggest that at least some blades were produced at Tikal from imported cores, like the fine blades of green obsidian. 
There was a lavish use of obsidian during the Early Late Classic period. This is apparent in the increased use of blades in all types of residential groups (Moholy-Nagy 2003c:Figure 4). It is also attested by the appearance of incised obsidians, an artifact type of ceremonial function apparently unique to Tikal. Incised obsidians were produced on macroflakes and macroblades struck directly from LPCs for no other purpose than inclusion in elite caches. The diversion of imported material from a utilitarian function to a purely ceremonial one was a significant departure from previous, more parsimonious artifact production. Incised obsidians gradually replaced obsidian eccentrics in cached offerings during the Late Classic period. 
The number of identified central Mexican sources appears to have declined sharply during the Late Late Classic and only green obsidian was iden­tified visually from Terminal Classic and Early Postclassic contexts. On the other hand, 17 thin bifaces came from contexts of Terminal Classic date. Three were of green obsidian and one was attributed to Ixtepeque. It is quite likely that at least some, if not most, of the 13 as yet unanalyzed gray Terminal Classic examples are of Mexican obsid­ian, in view of the near absence of Guatemalan sources among attributed thin bifaces from Tikal. 
The use of green obsidian peaked during the middle Early Classic through Early Late Classic periods. The earlier appearance of green obsidian compared to gray Mexican obsidian sources might very well be due to sampling, inasmuch as green obsidian can be recognized visually, while only about 4 percent of all recorded gray obsidian arti­facts have been geochemically sourced. On the other hand, we cannot yet dismiss the possibility that procurement and distribution of green obsid­ian was organized differently than that of gray Mex­ican obsidian. 
The obsidian eccentrics and incised obsidians of Maya sty le and the chamber burials and cached offerings associated with the elite did not survive into the post-Collapse Terminal Classic period. Thin bifaces, fine blades, and blade production debitage continued to occur in archaeological con­text, although in diminished quantities. One uncer­tainty regarding the quantity of obsidian imports at this time is the lack of sealed deposits. Very little construction took place during the Terminal Clas­sic, and most material culture dated to that time comes from a few unsealed problematical deposits and household middens. Conceivably, some arti­facts could be carry-overs from earlier times. 
A fine blade from the Early Postclassic period was attributed to Ixtepeque. Another was of green

obsidian. It is widely assumed that, by that time, 
Tikal no longer had a permanent population. 
The succession of predominance of Highland Guatemalan sources imported into the Maya Low­lands was confirmed, with SMJ giving way to El Chayal and El Chayal to Ixtepeque. Our attributed sample also demonstrated that SMJ and Ixtepeque obsidian were present throughout the Classic and Terminal Classic periods, and probably earlier. The period of use of green obsidian, from the Early Late Preclassic into the Early Postclassic, appears to be considerably longer than the time span of gray obsidian attributed to Mexican sources, which has been confirmed by instrumental analysis only for the period between the middle of the Early Clas­sic through the end of the Late Classic period. 
Discussion 

We would like to emphasize the special utility of pXRF to enable analysts to identify reliably and economically the rare and as yet unknown sources that might be expected to tum up in excavated col­lections, especially from large sites that date to the Classic and Postclassic periods. As noted by Braswell et al. (2011: 143), an experienced analyst will be able to pick out unusual looking materials visually, which can then be submitted for attribu­tion by instrument. The insurmountable problem with visual analysis, however, is posed by objects made of rare or as yet unknown sources whose appearance resembles those of known sources (Braswell et al. 20l l:Table l; Moholy-Nagy 2003a:Figure 1,Table 3). The use of pXRF can dis­tinguish translucent gray varieties of rare obsidi­ans, which might not be recognized by an analyst attempting visual attribution (Carballo et al. 2007:37). The few artifacts in a sample that can­not be attributed by pXRF could then be submit­ted to NAA or other instrumental analysis capable of detecting a larger set of elements. Such a pro­cedure would be more cost-efficient than analyz­ing a large collection by NAA, and more reliable than using visual attribution to make the initial sort. 
Among the new findings of our pXRF study was the uninterrupted presence throughout the Classic period of small quantities of LPCs from the High­land Guatemalan sources of SMJ and Ixtepeque, contemporaneous with the much greater quantities from El Chaya!. The LPCs from SMJ and Ixtepeque 
apparently needed little additional shaping, sug­
gested by the scarcity of attributed blade produc­
tion debitage and blade cores. 
Two new central Mexican sources were identi­fied, Fuentezuelas in Queretaro and Cerro Varal in Michoacan. The identification at Lowland Maya sites of rare artifacts of obsidian from very distant sources is not unique to Tikal. From Xkipche in the Puuc region of Yucatan, Braswell et al. (2011: 143) report a flake of obsidian from Huitzila, Zacatecas. They also note that a prismatic blade fragment found at San Juan Ambergris Cay, Belize, might have been made from obsidian from the La Joya­Teuchi tlan-La Primavera source in Jalisco (Braswell et al. 2011: 143). The presence of these rare and distant sources can only be detected by instrumental analysis, such as pXRF. If we used pXRF and other instrumental methods to establish databases of reliably sourced artifacts, we could begin to think about how these materials were imported into the Maya Lowlands, what other cul­tural phenomena they might have accompanied, and, especially, why they are present at all in a region that could access much closer sources of good quality. Eventually, exchange systems could be proposed for the Classic period similar to those proposed for obsidian (Braswell 2003) and pottery vessels (Hodge and Mine 1990; Mine 1994, 2009) for Postclassic Mesoamerica. 
The large sample of 2,283 pXRF instrument attributions included sufficient variability to pro­pose systemic interrelationships between geologi­cal sources and cultural contexts, which generally support current ideas gained from previous instru­mental analyses of obsidian from Tikal and the Lowland Maya area. This result encourages confi­dence in the method. Furthermore, our analysis provides some new findings and points up topics that could be explored by future research. 
Nearly all of the obsidian from Mexican sources had been worked into thin bifaces and prismatic blades. Their primarily utilitarian function is indi­cated by their most frequent occurrence in general excavations. Their presence in the construction fill of Civic-Ceremonial Groups and in Type 43 Prob­lematical Deposits supports an ultimate origin in elite and commoner residential groups. 
The distributions of attributed obsidian sources among types of artifacts, recovery contexts, types of structure groups, zones, and time periods

strongly suggest that more than one obsidian pro­curement and exchange system operated concur­rently at Tikal (Hirth 2010: 241, 246). We will only touch upon this subject here because a detailed pre­sentation of possible hypotheses is beyond the scope of this paper. An understanding of obsidian procurement must also consider the importation and exchange of all of the other durable goods brought to Tikal, as well as data about obsidian arti­fact production and use at neighboring sites . 
At least one procurement system, which func­tioned from at least the Early Late Preclassic until the abandonment ofTikal , brought in obsidian from several geological sources in the form of well-shaped LPCs that needed little or no trimming before blades could be made from them. We know from other evi­dence (e.g., Haviland 1981; Haviland 1985; Jones 
1996) that marketplace exchange flourished at Tikal throughout the Classic period. The presence of arti­facts thought to have been produced by craft spe­cialists indicates that marketplace exchange was present by the Early Late Preclassic and may even have been a prerequisite for Tikal's successful ini­tial settlement in the Early Middle Preclassic. Stone knappers and elite and commoner consumers prob­ably obtained most of their obsidian artifacts through marketplace exchange. Marketplace exchange might account for the mingling of sources in recovery con­texts in the central areas of the city, most likely exchange at more than one marketplace on the long way from central Mexico to Tikal. We should start thinking on a more regional scale about the interac­tions.of the different economic , social, and political structures and networks that took raw obsidian from somewhere in Michoacan or Queretero, transformed it into a thin biface or a blade core, and put it into the hands of a commoner at Tikal more than a thou­sand kilometers away. 
Another procurement system began to operate by Terminal Preclassic times and continued until the end of the Classic. Its presence is indicated by the mas­sive quantities of blade production debitage almost exclusively from a single geological source , El Chay al, the appearance of ceremonial lithics sourced to El Chayal, and the association of the debitage deposits and ceremonial lithics with Tikal's elites. This system imported large quantities of LPCs that required a good deal of additional shaping before blades could be produced from them. The high trans­portation and labor costs entailed by this system, the exclusive use of ceremonial lithics by the elite , and the deposition of debitage in recovery contexts asso­ciated with the elite indicate a procurement and dis­tribution system controlled by Tikal 's elites that may have operated independently of the marketplace. The re la ti ve scarcity of obsidian artifacts on the out­skirts of the city and their almost exclusive attribu­tion to El Chayal suggest still other ways of distribution during the Classic period (Supplemen­tary Tables 4a-4f) . 
Conclusion 
The use of pXRF to obtain large samples of obsid­ian source attributions shows significant research potential because it combines the portability, non­destructiveness, rapidity, and economy of visual identification with the reliability and reproducibil­ity of instrumental analysis. Although statistical differences have been found in the measurements of individual elements by laboratory XRF versus portable XRF (Nazaroff et al. 2010), measurements by pXRF were found to be internally consistent, and there is general agreement that in most cases pXRF is suitable for attributing the obsidian used for artifacts to their geological sources (Cecil et al. 2007; Drake et al. 2009; Meierhoff et al. 2010; Millhauser et al. 2011; Nazaroff et al. 2010; Speak­man et al. 2005). Issues of accuracy, standardiza­tion, and protocols raised for pXRF (Shackley 2010:20) are no different than those that exist for any other method of chemical measurement. As long as a reasonable level of precision is achieved (e.g., Frahm 2012), and obsidian sources of inter­est can be distinguished from one another using a more limited suite of elements detectable by pXRF, this method offers a rapid and cost-effective means of analyzing large collections of obsidian and iden­tifying pieces that require further measurement by other techniques to confirm source assignment. A more representative sample of obsidian artifacts from a single site could be attributed through the onsite pXRF sourcing of secondarily worked or rare artifacts , or pieces too thick to transmit light. Onsite attribution would also solve the problems that often arise in arranging temporary export artifacts from countries of origin or in borrowing them from 
museum collections for analysis at a laboratory.

years knows how much technology and software have revolutionized the commonplace even as appli­cations themselves have changed at dizzying rates." Technology extends human senses and enables the gathering of new kinds of information. Through technology we can now determine the composition and trace the origins of culturally significant mate­rials, including ceramics, stone, and even human remains. In the near future we will be able to make most such determinations right in the field. 
The relationship between technology and advances in knowledge is reflexive. Reliable instru­mental attributions play a vital role in generating plausible hypotheses about the past cultural contexts of sourced materials. We have demonstrated here the effectiveness of pXRF in making a rapid initial assessment of a large sample of artifacts together with the use of more accurate, but more expensive and slower instrumental methods such as NAA, to determine and confirm identifications of new or rare sources. The distributional analysis of this large sample of 2,283 geochemical source attributions has brought new information to light about the importation and consumption of obsidian at a major Lowland Maya site. Future efforts should be directed towards promoting the refinement and use of pXRF and other technology to compile databases of reliable source attributions that can be studied in terms of cultural variables. Linking source with cul­ture will provide a better understanding of the pro­curement and use of imported materials as integral components of past cultural systems.

Both before and after the Spanish conquest, 
indigenous scribes recorded their communities' 
histories and belief systems, as well as the 
events of the conquest and its effects and 
aftermath. Today, the descendants of those native historians still remember their ancestors' stories. In Mesoamerican Memory, Amos Megged 
and Stephanie Wood have gathered the latest scholarship from contributors around the world 
to compare these various memories and explore how they were preserved and altered over time.
