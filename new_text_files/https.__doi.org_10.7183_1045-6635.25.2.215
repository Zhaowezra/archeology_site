PATARAYA: THE ARCH AEOLOGY OF A WARI OUTPOST IN NASCA 
Matthew J. Edwards and Katharina Schreiber 
The research reported in this article explores Wari imperial strategies in the upper Nasca Valley of south-central Peru and, building on previous research, documents the flexibility and diversity of those strategies. The focus of these investigations is the site of Pataraya, a small Wari provincial outpost, and its environs. Despite its size, the rectangular enclosure at Pataraya is well planned and conforms to the canons of Wari state architecture documented at other Wari provincial sites. The site was founded early in the Middle Horizon (A.D. 650-1000) and then abandoned during the collapse of the Wari system. Extensive excavation at this condensed version of the Wari building tradition-over 60 percent-uncovered a pattern of spatially segregated use and access within the enclosure. Activities were relegated to specific patio groups with little replication of function, and the sectors themselves were connected by an astonishingly complex system of narrow corridors. The site appears to have been involved in the transfer of coastal products, especially cotton, to the sierra along an ancient road that is also associated with another much larger Wari compound and with the reorganization of an older local site near modern-day Uchuymarca, both of which were also documented during the project.

El eje de estas investigaciones es el sitio de Pataraya, un pequefio puesto provincial de avanzada, y sus alrededores. Apesar de su reducido tamafio, el complejo rec­tangular en Pataraya fue cuidadosamente planificado conforme a las canones de arquitectura estatal Wari documentados en otros sitios administrativos Wari. El sitio Jue construido en la parte temprana del Horizonte Media (650-1000 d.C.) y abandonado durante el aparente colapso del sistema Wari. la excavacion extensa-alrededor del 60 por ciento de la superficie de ocupacion-de esta version condensada de la tradicion constructiva Wari, revel6 un patron de uso y acceso espacialmente diferenciado en Pataraya. Ciertas actividades fueron relegadas a grupos de patios especf/icos, que a su vez estaban conectados par un sistema sorprendentemente complejo de estrechos corredores. Hubo tambien escasa repetici6n de funciones entre las diferentes sectores, lo cual indica que la poblaci6n de Pataraya durante el Horizante Medio conformaba una sola unidad eco­n6mica. las actividades parecen haberse centrado en el traslado de productos costefios, especialmente algod6n, a la sierra, a traves de un antiguo camino asociado con Pataraya y con otra ocupaci6n Wari en el mismo valle de Nasca tambien docu­mentada durante el proyecto. Esta ocupaci6n, cerca de! poblado actual de Uchuymarca, esta representada por otro complejo Wari mas grande y por una significativa reorganizaci6n de un sitio local mas antiguo. 

mpires employ a wide variety of strategies Ein order to effectively control and incor­porate new territories and peoples into larger political and economic systems (Doyle 1986; Eisenstadt 1969). At one level, such polities reorganize the political structure of conquered peoples so that it articulates with imperial gov­ernment (Menzel 1959:232-233; Schreiber 1992: 17-27; Sinopoli 2001; Smith and Schreiber 2006:5-6). At a second level, local economic pro­duction is reorganized to support state projects and to exploit regionally specific resources, as well as to provide transportation of such tribute and products to imperial centers (Earle 1991: 11­15, 2009:266-269; Smith and Schreiber 2005:197-199). At a third level, empires manip­ulate indigenous religious beliefs in order to le­gitimize their own power structures (Morrison 2001; Sinopoli 1994: 167-168; Smith and Schreiber 2006: 16-20). In order to successfully maintain long-term control over vast territories, empires not only employ a wide variety of con­solidation strategies, but they also must be flexi­ble in their ability to tailor strategies to particular

situations, and they must be able to vary their strategies over time as their interests or needs in a particular region change (Barfield 200 1; Schreiber 1992:1-39, 2001:71-74). 
The Wari Empire of Middle Horizon Peru (ca. 
A.D. 650-1000) provides the opportunity to ex­plore imperial strategies in a variety of settings. Unlike in the case of many other empires, the study of Wari relies solely on archaeological ev­idence, because no written records are available to aid us in our interpretations (Schreiber 2001:70). Thus, investigations of Wari occupa­tions not only provide new theoretical insights into the workings of ancient empires, but also contribute to the development of methodological approaches allowing us to discern particular as­pects of imperial processes (see Parker 2003: 5 25­526). Over the past several decades, archaeolog­ical investigations of Wari provincial occupations have been undertaken in a variety of settings and, through a combination of excavation and survey, archaeologists have been able to reconstruct many aspects of Wari provincial administration. The geographic distribution of Wari infrastructure­planned architectural complexes and roads-are our best proxy for the extent of Wari political control (Boone 199l:ix; Schreiber 2001:72). Sites with distinctive Wari architecture (Schreiber 1978:26-99; Spickard 1983:139-140) are found as far north as the Cajamarca region of the north highlands of Peru (Williams and Pineda 1985), as well as at the sites of Pikillacta (McEwan 1984, 1996, 2005) and Huaro (Glowacki and McEwan 2001) near Cuzco, and Cerro Baul and Cerro Mejia in the Moquegua Valley of southern Peru (Nash and Williams 2004; Williams 2001; Williams and Nash 2002). Many Wari sites have been interpreted as political centers, and several studies have been able to contextualize them within regional settlement systems, addressing the impact of the Wari occupation on local polit­ical arrangements (e.g., McEwan 1987, 2005; Schreiber 1992; Williams 2001). In several in­stances, economic reorganization of conquered territory has been addressed. For example, con­struction of agricultural systems has been inves­tigated in the Moquegua Valley, including the de­velopment of cultivated tracts of land and irrigation systems during the period of Wari oc­cupation (Williams 1997). Changes in the Wari 
occupation over the course of the Middle Horizon in the Sondondo Valley entailed the expansion of the size of Jincamocco and an increased focus on economic matters-building extensive bench terraces throughout much of the valley, and gen­erally reorganizing agricultural production (Schreiber 1992: 149-15 I). The effects of the Wari occupation on local belief systems have also been addressed in Sondondo, where imperial strategies included efforts to exert ideological control over its subjects there (Schreiber 2004: I 34-146). Overall, it has become apparent that no two Wari sites are alike, that Wari strategies were tailored to the circumstances encountered in each indi­vidual region over which it established dominion, and that Wari strategies were modified over time. 
The current study builds on this prior work and addresses the Wari occupation in yet another type of setting, further hinting at the flexibility and diversity of Wari imperial strategies. The small Wari compound of Pataraya in the Tierras Blancas River valley (Figure I), offers a unique opportunity to study Wari strategies in a small region on the boundary between coast and high­lands. This site lies within the modem Department of Ayacucho (Province of Lucanas), but geo­graphically falls within the upper portion of the Nasca drainage of the south coast. The investi­gations reported here demonstrate considerable Wari investment to control coast-highland ex­change during the Middle Horizon. 
Archaeological Context, 
Prior Research, and New Questions 

The Nasca drainage is located on the south coast of Peru and comprises some eight rivers that orig­inate on the western flanks of the Andes and unite on the desert coastal plain to form a single stream that flows to the Pacific (see Figure 1 ). Due to the presence of an ancient mountain range along the coastline, human occupation of the drainage is lo­cated well inland. The drainage can be divided into a northern and a southern group of tributaries, which differ in hydrographic conditions; the north­ern rivers (Grande, Palpa, Viscas, Ingenio) have normal dendritic drainage patterns and tend to flow year-round, while the southern rivers (Aja, Tierras Blancas, Taruga, Las Trancas) are shorter, with few tributaries, producing relatively low wa-

650), the Nasca drainage has received a great deal of attention from archaeologists, art histori­ans, collectors, and looters for over a century (see Silverman 1993: 14-29 for a comprehensive his­tory of investigations). It has long been assumed that there was a strong Wari presence in Nasca, yet our knowledge of the Middle Horizon in Nasca has always been limited. In 1927, Julio C. Tello excavated nearly three tons of smashed, finely decorated ceramics of Wari origin at the site of Pacheco in the lower-middle Nasca Valley (Daggett 2009:27-28; Tello 2002:203-207); ad­ditional areas of the site were excavated by Ronald Olson in 1930 (Menzel 1964:23-25). Looted cemeteries also yielded fancy Wari ce­ramics over the years, many coming to reside in major international museums. In her seminal work on Wari ceramic styles, Dorothy Menzel carefully reconstructed the provenience of many specimens that had originated in Nasca, and these played an important role in her definition of several Wari styles (Menzel 1964). Given the presence of a major Wari offering site at Pacheco, along with clear Nasca influence on Wari ceramic styles and technology, the connection between Wari and Nasca was apparently a strong one. 
The highland province above Nasca has also produced evidence of Wari occupations. The Province of Lucanas straddles the Continental Divide and includes portions of three drainages (see Figure 1). The northeast portion of the province drains northward via the Sondondo Val­ley to the Rfo Pampas and on to the Amazon, the central portion drains south and southwest via the Acarf River to the Pacific, and the western portion of the province comprises the headwaters of the multiple streams that form the Nasca drainage. The Wari occupation of the Sondondo Valley, centered on the site of Jincamocco, has been extensively documented (Schreiber 1992, inter alia). 
Beginning in the mid-1980s, when archaeo­logical research in the central highlands of Peru became impossible due to political unrest, teams from the University of California, Santa Barbara, began a series of investigations of the southern Nasca valleys. Initial efforts were focused on the puquio irrigation system employed in Nasca (Schreiber and Lancho 1995, 2003), and over the next decade an intensive survey of the four south-em tributaries of the Nasca drainage (Aja, Tierras Blancas, Taruga, and Las Trancas) was accom­plished (Schreiber 1999: 168). Survey proceeded from the lower Nasca Valley at about 300 m asl some 60 km up into the Andean foothills, to an elevation of 1200 m asl in Aja and Las Trancas, and to 1600 m asl in the Tierras Blancas Valley. Some 1200 archaeological sites were recorded, ranging in date from the Middle Archaic to the Spanish Colonial period. Several sites recorded in those surveys have since been the focus of more intensive study, including Late Intermediate period Pajonal Alto and La Tiza (Conlee 2000, 2003, 2004), Early Nasca Marcaya and Upanca (Vaughn 2000, 2005, 2009), and Early Horizon La Puntilla (Van Gijseghem 2004, 2006).' 
One of the initial research objectives in un­dertaking the Nasca survey was to better under­stand the Wari occupation of Nasca, which was assumed to have been substantial. It was thus a curious tum of events that virtually no evidence of Wari, other than the occasional potsherd in a looted cemetery, was encountered after several years of survey. Ultimately two or three ceme­teries that appeared to include Wari-type above­ground or semi-subterranean tombs were located, but no evidence of Wari habitation or adminis­trative architecture was found until the end of the project (Schreiber 1999: 169). Although the project goal of reaching 1200 m asl in each valley had been met, prior aerial reconnaissance over the Tierras Blancas Valley indicated the presence of sites and an interesting tract of abandoned ter­races farther up the valley, and so survey was ex­tended to 1600 m in this valley. This upper portion of the valley carries the name Pataraya, a combi­nation of Quechua pata (terrace) and Spanish raya (line), which describes the lines of aban­doned terraces that cover the hillsides. 
Pataraya lies in a zone of transition between coastal and highland agricultural strategies. Below Pataraya, all agriculture is restricted to the valley bottom, rainfall is negligible to nonexistent, and irrigation is critical. Above Pataraya, agricultural fields lie not on the valley bottom but on the hill­sides, where there are extensive tracts of bench terraces; rainfall is present, although not abundant, and so most crops require additional irrigation. In the transitional zone of Pataraya, agricultural fields lie both on the valley bottom and on the valley

flanks. Rising rapidly in elevation at this point, the valley bottom land has been sculpted into low terraced fields and the hillsides are covered with sloping-field terraces (Denevan 2001: 176---177). Rain does fall here, but it is very limited in quan­tity; irrigation of all fields is necessary. 
Archaeological sites in this zone include a half dozen village sites dating to Early Nasca times, a single very large town site dating to Late Nasca times, a Wari cemetery, and a small site with Wari-style architecture. This paper reports the re­sults of three seasons of archaeological fieldwork at the Wari site, named Pataraya, and its environs between 2007 and 2009. These investigations in­cluded extensive archaeological excavations at Pataraya, survey of the upper valleys of the Nasca River's main tributaries (the Tierras Blancas and Aja rivers), and limited test excavations at two Middle Horizon sites in the highland Aja Valley discovered during the surveys. 
Investigations at Pataraya 
The Wari rectangular enclosure at Pataraya is quite small compared to most of the known Wari provincial centers. Nevertheless, the site is very well planned and conforms to the canons of Wari administrative architecture, including virtually all of the features of the tradition, even those that would have been invisible to visitors (Schreiber 199 l a:203-204; Spickard 1983:139-140). The site includes a main, nearly perfectly square, en­closure with two additional rectangular enclosures appended to it (Figure 2). Excavations at the site were undertaken during the 2007 field season and were focused on clarifying and documenting the architecture, exposing living surfaces and fea­tures, characterizing use of the site's different ar­eas, and recovering artifacts and other materials indicative of site chronology and function. Be­cause of Pataraya's small size, we were able to excavate over 60 percent of the site's main occu­pation surfaces. Systematic wall trenching was also undertaken in order to fully expose the site's plan, including all of its passages and doorways, as illustrated in Figures 2 and 3. 
The main enclosure measures roughly 20 m on a side and is defined by a double-faced, rub­ble-filled masonry enclosure wall that originally stood one full story high, with a single entrance (Edwards 2010:214). The square space inscribed by the enclosure wall is divided into four, roughly equal-sized quadrants that are themselves subdi­vided in patterned ways. Analysis of wall joining patterns indicates that the site was built from the outside in, just as has been documented at other Wari sites, demonstrating that the rectangular en­closure was built according to a preconceived plan. The site's square outer enclosure wall was built first, then divided into four quadrants, and, finally, each of these was subdivided into patios surrounded on their perimeters by galleries and corridors. Some of the galleries were further sub­divided, forming small rooms. A key observation provided by exposing so much of Pataraya's total architectural plan is the documentation of an in­triguing system of intrasite communication pro­vided by narrow corridors between and around the site's four sectors, creating an astonishingly differentiated pattern of access and privacy, es­pecially given the small size of the site (see Figure 3; compare to Brewster-Wray [1983:124]; also see Edwards [2013:568-574]). 
Two rectangular constructions were added to the main enclosure, a large enclosure abutting the structure to the east and another smaller one to the north. The additional enclosure to the east is substantial, inscribing an area equal to nearly 40 percent of the area of the entire main enclo­sure. The construction technique for this addition is robust, like the main enclosure, with a rigor­ously orthogonal enclosure wall that abuts the main compound and matches its orientation. It is also incorporated into the site's overall system of communication, and access can be gained only via the main entrance. However, the area lacks any internal subdivisions or other structures. The area to the north is considerably different. While matching the rest of the rectangular enclosure's shape and orientation, its walls abut the main en­closure wall but are not substantial, standing only a few courses high. The area is not incorporated into the overall system of access and communi­cation within the site, and it is the only sector that can be entered without first passing through the main entrance. 
Beyond the spatial arrangement, architectural and construction materials and methods were also documented. Like other Wari sites, Pataraya's walls were constructed of double-

faced, rubble-core stone and dried clay mortar masonry. Three types of living surfaces were identified based on the level of effort expended in their preparation. The most basic type is a passively trampled earthen floor that is mostly associated with domestic contexts. Other floors were surfaced with sundried, coarse sand and clay plaster. In one apparently ceremonially im­portant area of the site, a much finer plaster was used, which consists of a mix of fine sand and clay that appears nearly white. Site furniture, consisting of platforms, benches, and bins, was also documented throughout the enclosure (see Figure 2). These small constructions generally consist of low, single-face stone masonry retain­ing walls that, in the case of the platforms and benches, are filled with a hardened clay mix and then surfaced with a finer clay and sand plaster similar to that used on the prepared floors (Figure 4). The location of much of this furniture is as­sociated with domestic contexts. The placement of these elements also appears to have been a little more ad hoc than that of the site's more substantial architectural elements, suggesting that they were added as needed by the site's inhabi­tants over the span of its occupation.

known. 
Secondary evidence of other architectural de­tails was uncovered during excavation. Most of the wood recovered from the site, both in exca­vations and from the flotation samples, is archi­tectural. This material was ubiquitous on living surfaces around the main enclosure. The bulk of this material probably represents the remains of perishable roofing materials: timber lathe and thatch. Equally ubiquitous soot stains on living surfaces also suggest that many of the main en­closure's gallery spaces were roofed. The ex­cellent preservation of the plaster floor in patio B suggests to us that this area was also roofed, although most of the patios appear to have been open (see Edwards 2013: Figure 4). Soot tends to accumulate on ceilings from cooking, lighting, and heating fires and is then incorporated into floor deposits when those roofs collapse and rot (Schiffer 1996:145). Thatched, hipped, and flat roofs are portrayed on Wari ceramic architectural models on display at various museums in Peru, and the archaeological evidence at Pataraya in­dicates that the enclosure was also covered by thatch roofs, though in the absence of fully pre-

served walls it is not possible to determine their form. We also recovered fragments of red pig­mented plaster in deposits near structural walls and among the rubble, suggesting that much of the masonry was once plastered and, at least in some areas, painted. Finally, several of the more elaborately decorated vessels recovered from the site were found complete but fragmented within fallen wall rubble, suggesting that the vessels perhaps rested in niches when the site was abandoned. 
Stratigraphy at Pataraya is relatively simple, consistent with a single continuous occupation and an arid environment where soil development is slow. Rubble from Pataraya's collapsed walls is the main post-abandonment stratum. Below this is a stratum of wind-blown sediment of vary­ing thickness, generally piled deeper against the walls than in more exposed areas. There is far more of this sediment on top of the occupation surfaces and below the collapsed wall rubble than has accumulated on top of the rubble, even though 
the same natural deposition process-wind­carried sand and silt-continues to act on the site, suggesting that Pataraya's walls stood at their full height for some time after abandonment. In some places, the wall rubble stratum is interspersed with eolian sediment, indicating episodic wall collapse, perhaps resulting from earthquakes-a common occurrence in the seismically active An­des. The cultural strata underlie these post-aban­donment deposits and are usually thin, consisting of a single discernible surface that, in places, con­sists of a prepared floor. Exceptions include mid­den, found in two sectors of the site (sector E and patio group A), and cultural fill that was placed below floors to level, and in one case raise, occupation surfaces (patio B). In many areas, these surfaces were intentionally buried in a thin deposit of clean, pale, manuported river sand. Most occupation surfaces lie atop culturally sterile parent soil of weathered bedrock. In one sector of the site, a second occupation surface is dis­cernible that is associated with brief reoccupation
