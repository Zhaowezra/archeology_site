ARCHAIC ORIGINS OF THE LOWLAND MAYA 
Jon C. Lohse 
The earliest Lowland Maya are commonly recognized by permanent architecture and the appearance of pottery. However, when other lines of evidence are considered, strong continuities with late Archaic populations can be seen. Reconciling these views relies on more than simply gathering more data. It is also necessary to consider the effect of decades of schol­arship that defines the precolumbian Maya as "civilization" rather than considering the historical contexts of important transitions, such as the one that culminated with sedentism, the adoption of new technologies, and participation in long­distance exchange. The Archaic-to-Preclassic transition was relatively brief and largely obscured by the practices of estab­lishing permanent dwellings. Nevertheless, this period must have been extremely dynamic and marked by significant cultural change, making it important to researchers interested in early Mesoamerica. Using three lines of evidence-subsistence, economy and technology, and stratigraphically controlled radiocarbon data-this article argues that the Lowland Maya had their cultural origins at least in the late Archaic and that the case for pottery before ca. !000 B. C. remains uncertain. Future research is needed to determine precisely how far back in time certain cultural practices that characterize Preclas­sic and Classic Maya society can be documented. 
La investigacion arqueologica sob re las orfgenes de las tierras bajas mayas ha tendido a enfocarse en la cerdmica y la arqui­tectura permanente, y ha favorecido explicaciones que involucran influencias externas. Solo recientemente la evidencia de depositos precerdmicos pre-aldeanos ha cambiado sustancialmente este punto de vista. Esta perspectiva tradicional resulta ser un enfoque de umbra/ para estudiar el cambio cultural, en el cual la presencia de ciertos rasgos reorienta la investigacion hacia un conjunto diferente de planteamientos poco relacionados con las que caracterizan a el o las periodos precedentes en las cronologfas regionales o culturales. Un resultado de este enfoque es que en las andlisis antropologicos se pierde el con­texto historico en el cual ocurrieron esas transiciones cultural es. Este artfculo se enfoca en la transicion de la vida precerdmica a la aldeana, ca. 1100-900 a.C., en las tierras bajas mayas. La evidencia indica que la cerdmica y la vida aldeana reconoci­ble parecen haber sucedido casi al mismo tiempo; si es que existieron aldeas precerdmicas, Los arqueologos aun no las han identificado. A fin de contextualizar el surgimiento de la sociedad sedentaria, se comparan tres amplias lfneas de evidencia para el Arcaico Tardio y la parte temprana del Precldsico Media ( subsistencia, economfa y tecnologfa, y fechamiento abso­luto ). Como resultado de esta vision comparativa, se destacan desarrollos importantes, pero tambien se hacen evidentes las fuertes continuidades con las tradiciones previas. Una de las metas de este estudio es esbozar un marco para investigar la transicion desde el Arcaico Tardio hasta la parte temprana de! Precldsico Media a lo largo de las tierras bajas, y as[ postu­lar que las patrones culturales mayos pueden trazarse sistemdticamente desde las adaptaciones pre-sedentarias. Un segundo objetivo es abordar argumentos epistemologicos que han existido par mucho tiempo en cuanto a coma se define lo "mayo."

evidence of "civilization." They note that 
estamos interesados en la genesis de la civi­lizaci6n maya. Para nosotros, "genesis" implica conocer los origenes y los procesos evolutivos e implica investigar a las sociedades mayas mas tempranas y SU desarrollo hist6rico. "Civilizaci6n" es un termino ambiguo que puede significar "cultura," "sociedad estatal," o "sociedad estratificada"; aquf nos referimos a un sistema de estratifi­caci6n social con las practicas polftico­econ6micas y la tradici6n artistica que lo acompaiian [2000:440; emphasis added]. 
Defining Mesoamerican traditions in this man­ner as advanced stages of cultural development, first and foremost, that happened to appear within a specified geographic area amounts to a threshold approach to studying cultures and culture change. This perspective includes the search for stages of cultural development, following formulas by Mor­ton Fried, Elman Service, and other cultural evo­lutionists (see Upham 1990:90). If enough variables are found to be present, the weight of evidence nudges the analysis in a different direction that car­ries new, often unrelated working assumptions and rules of evidence. Exceptions to this way of look­ing at the transition from residentially mobile forager-horticulturalists to sedentary farmers exist in Mesoamerica, notably along the Pacific coast of southern Mexico and Guatemala (Blake 1999; Blake et al. 1995; Clark 1994; Clark and Blake 1994; Kennett et al. 2002; Neff et al. 2006; Voorhies 2004) and in Oaxaca (Flannery 1985; Marcus and Flannery 1996). Long-term research in these regions has documented significant changes in eco­logical adaptations and concomitant shifts in set­tlement and sociopolitical complexity. 1 In the case of the Maya, however, who have long seemed to 
1 lack long-term cultural antecedents, one conse­quence of stage-based or threshold approaches has been that the processes or events that led mobile groups reliant on hunting, foraging, and horticul­ture to adopt a sedentary settlement strategy ·have frequently gone overlooked. Along with under­standing reasons behind settlement choices, also lost is the historical context within which this and other significant transformations occurred. Did hierarchical institutions emerge overnight, or were they the result of slow-growing developments that have their roots in the Archaic? When they did appear, and what became of egalitarian structures that previously regulated important aspects of inter­personal relations and that have been shown else­where to be tenacious in the face of change (e.g., Weissner 2002)? Did long-distance trade contribute to the appearance of so-called complex society? A threshold approach to understanding the earliest Maya is poorly suited to answering these and related questions. 
Recent investigations have made inroads in bridging the conceptual distance between the Archaic and early sedentary portions of the record in the Maya Lowlands (Andrews and Robles 20 l O; Awe 1992; Clark and Cheetham 2002; Iceland 1997, 2005; Lohse 2005; Lohse et al. 2006; Pohl et al. 1996; Rosenswig 2004; Rosenswig and Mas­son 2001; see summary by Zeitlin and Zeitlin 2000), though archaeologists still face considerable difficulties in reconstructing this transformation. Several reasons account for this gap, not all of which involve the paucity of investigated late Archaic sites. Knowledge of the Archaic in this area is limited primarily to northern and central Belize, meaning that Lowland-wide preceramic sequences are yet unknown. Northern and central Belize are associated with early Middle Preclassic Swasey and Cunil ceramic spheres, respectively (Andrews and Hammond 1990; Awe 1992; Cheetham 2005; Kosakowsky 1987; Valdez 1987), and some discussion has linked these early ceramic traditions with people who preceded them (Clark and Cheetham 2002; Iceland 1997, 2005). It is, however, currently impossible to accurately iden­tify potential precursors to the earliest ceramic tra­ditions elsewhere, including Xe (and sometimes Real) along the Pasion Drainage (Adams 1971 ), Eb in the northern Peten (Culbert 1977; Laporte and Fialko 1993), andEkin northern Yucatan (Andrews 1990; Andrews et al. 2008; Figure 1). 
Additionally, identifying Maya sites based on ceramics and architecture often precludes investi­gating or even recognizing preceramic deposits that might exist at those same sites. Related to this is that locales representing late Archaic populations that transformed into, comingled with, or were replaced by "the Maya" are fundamentally differ­ent from early village sites and need to be approached and understood accordingly. Here, I make the case that several sites actually contain evi-

dence for both periods, yet Archaic components represent the activities of forager-horticulturalists rather than sedentary village fanners, meaning that site structure and stratigraphy are significantly dif­ferent than those seen in permanent occupations with related features. Another, and in my view sig­nificant, problem with the historical focus on ceramics for telling us about the earliest Maya is that, by the time ceramics appeared, much of the Low lands had already been occupied for centuries, if not millennia (see below). Without evidence for wholesale population replacements, which is cur­rently lacking, early ceramics do not provide evi­dence for and should not be equated with the earliest May.a. 
According to available dates, the transition from preceramic to early village life took place over a brief interval, between approximately 1100 and 900 or even 800 B.C. in the Central and No1thern Lowlands. This short span lends to its low archae­ological visibility. Compounding this problem is the fact that practices associated with how the ear-

liest village sites were established, such as build­ing low platforms or laying house floors, obscured and removed many preceramic deposits or resulted in the mixing of contexts and materials, particularly carbonized plant and wood remains. Awareness of all of these factors should greatly facilitate the future identification and interpretation of Archaic, as well as early Middle Preclassic, deposits and sequences. 
Last, conceptual problems arise when scholars ascribe ethnic identities to archaeological cultures. The contemporary and historical Maya comprise a number of sociopolitical groups, language families, and ethnicities, and use of the term Maya by archae­ologists to refer to precolumbian peoples conflates a great deal of important cultural variation. This is particularly troublesome when investigating the vague beginnings of cultural traditions whose pop­ulations today number in the millions. Working backward in time in a direct historical manner from European contact to the Postclassic and into the late and even Early Classic, during which time Ch'olti'an served as the courtly language (e.g., Campbell 2004; Houston et al. 2000), may or may not be straightforward. However, for even earlier periods, important questions must be resolved before scholars can argue for cultural continuity across significant disjunctures in the material record. Do settled villages and ceramics mark the first "Maya," or are precolumbian Maya only rec­ognizable as language or ethnic groups? If the lat­ter, then what of people living in the Lowlands prior to the reach of historical linguistic recon­structions? How long before the earliest written or linguistic record can scholars confidently describe their subjects as "Maya"? Defining the ancient Maya as "a civilization" obscures the possibility that different regions of the Lowlands were occu­pied by distinct social groupings that followed dif­
Jerent paths to settled village life. 
In this article, I reframe the consideration of the Archaic-to-Preclassic transition in the Lowlands away from the common threshold approach and toward a historically contextualized evaluation of this process. Available Archaic data are primarily limited to Belize and eastern and central Peten. Nevertheless, a detailed comparison that considers both preceramic and early village deposits helps clarify this transition as it may have occurred else­where. Below, I briefly summarize some previous 
models explaining the earliest Maya. Next, I com­pare what is known for the late Archaic and early Middle Preclassic with respect to three important lines of evidence: subsistence, economy and tech­nology, and dating and stratigraphy. By evaluating data from key sites representing some or all of the ca. 1100-900 B.C. period, archaeologists can bet­ter understand what the transition to sedentary, ranked society entailed. Moreover, the focus on processes of change rather than thresholds of com­plexity will help investigators better recognize how and when the shift to agricultural village life and social ranking took place. Strong emphasis is placed on directly dated site sequences. Much recent work on this topic has relied heavily on ceramic cross dating, which, while indicating the stratigraphic priority of one ceramic complex over another, does little to resolve specific questions about when the transition from residential mobil­ity and preceramic lifeways to settled villages took place. Moreover, as will be seen, imprecision in how published radiocarbon sequences have been viewed has led in cases to problematic assessments about the timing of initial developments. Echoing Iceland ( 1997, 2005) and Clark and Cheetham (2002), I conclude that some component of the ear­liest sedentary villagers in Belize and adjacent Peten were descended from preceramic popula­tions and that the term Mayacan be applied at least to the latest Archaic horticulturalists in those regions. Importantly, the transition did not occur at the same time in all regions of the Lowlands, and much work is required before we can understand the full implication of the time lag between differ­ent developments. The lack of robust, Lowland­wide data for this transition at present precludes comprehensive syntheses explaining why Archaic foragers settled down. Nonetheless, some prelim­inary thoughts are provided concerning how archaeologists might conceptualize this process. 
The Earliest (Village) Maya 
The period from ca. 1100 to 900 B.C., corre­sponding with the rapid widespread appearance of "pan-Mesoamerican" motifs (Clark and Pye 2000; Powis 2005), was one of the most dynamic in Mesoamerica, and it was sometime in this period of social and political change that the earliest vil­lages appeared in the Maya Lowlands.

Oaxaca, along the Pacific coast, and elsewhere, where the transition from the Archaic to sedentary village life extended over longer periods of time, in the Maya Lowlands this transition was relatively brief. With evidence for sharply increasing exchange of ideas and information across Mesoamerica and the apparently sudden appear ­ance of villages in this region, making sense of early sedentism during this period has long been a problem for archaeologists. Before the availability of preceramic data from northern and central Belize, most models that had been proposed to account for Maya origins were diffusionist in nature. These combined ceramic and linguistic evi­dence to propose in-migrations into the Lowlands by ceramic-bearing Mixe-Zoque speakers from the Isthmus of Tehuantepec or by way of Honduras or by proto-Mayan speakers from the Guatemala Highlands (Adams 1966, 1977; Andrews 1990; Kaufman 1976; Puleston and Puleston 1971; Wil­ley 1982; seeAwe 1992:350; Powis 2005:6). Only recently has research indicated in situ development from preceramic traditions (Figure 2).

ers from the Isthmus of Tehuantepec as influential to the early Maya. Andrews (1990) likens the Xe tradition to early Formative Barra and Ocos ceramic periods found in the isthmus and elsewhere. Of Barra and Ocos, he notes that "the similarity in ceramic assemblages for more than a thousand years over this large area argues strongly for its eth­nic and linguistic unity, for its separation from the Maya Lowlands, and for its identification with the historic Mixe-Zoque in the state of Chiapas" (1990: 15-16). Observed similarities between earl Formative Isthmus ceramics and later Xe maten­als include types that have comparable matte, pow­dery slips with nearly identical paste composition and temper inclusions, and vessel forms (Andrews 1990:7). Decorations such as double-line breaks also compare favorably with early Middle Pre­classic Chiapan ceramics, though they are also widely distributed across much of Mesoamerica. Linguistic interaction in the form of loan words from proto-Mixe-Zoque to Mayan dialects (Camp­bell and Kaufman 1976) has also been identified as evidence for isthmian and Gulf Coast influence in the Maya area, although the date of this influ­ence has since come into question (Wichmann 1998), and it seems that the greatest impact on Mayan languages from the isthmus came instead around the last couple of centuries B.C., after the distinction emerged between Mixean and Zoquean. The southeastern Highlands of El Salvador and western Honduras are also identified as areas of early influence (Demarest 1986; Sharer and Gif­ford 1970). Sharer and Gifford (1970:458-459) compared Early Preclassic materials from Chalchuapa with finds along the Pacific coast, pos­sibly Kaminaljuyu, and Highland Chiapas sites and suggest that a single, early ceramic horizon may have linked all these regions. These materials were believed to predate the earliest pottery in the Low­

, lands. By the early Middle Preclassic, similarities were observed between Colos and Kai ceramic complexes from Chalchuapa and Xe and lat er 
.
Mamom spheres in the Maya area. Shared traits included the presence of Jocote orange-brown types and varieties in both various Xe and Chalchuapa assemblages (Sharer and Gifford 1970:452). On the basis of relative ceramic chronologies and the shar­ing of key types, Sharer and Gifford note 
By the early portion of the Middle Preclassic, there was a certain undeniable ceramic artic­
ulation between the Lowlands (with its recently arrivedpopulations), and the Highlands. There is also the suggestion that Chalchuapa should be included in the Xe ceramic sphere, in tum a reflection of the hypothesized initial migra­tion of early agricultural settlers into the east­central Lowlands from the southeastern Highlands [1970:459; emphasis added]. 
Probable routes of entry included the Motagua Val­ley and nearby drainages in western Honduras. 
Following the recognition of early Middle Pre­classic Cunil pottery in central Belize (Awe 1992) and arguments that it predates Swasey in northern Belize (Cheetham 2005; Cheetham et al. 2003; Clark and Cheetham 2002), Ball and Taschek (2003: 181-182) advanced similar hypotheses about the earliest pottery makers in the Eastern Lowlands. They suggest that the linguistic and cul­tural affiliations of Cunil and Swasey potters were different and that early Belize Valley peoples may have been Mixe-Zoque speakers who arrived by way of Honduras. Garber et al. (2004a:27-3 l) also identify Puerto Escondido, Honduras (Joyce and Henderson 2001 ), as a possible source of influence for early sedentism in central Belize. 
Relying on linguistic evidence, Terrance Kauf­man (1976) postulates the breakup of a proto­Mayan language by about 2200 B.C. in the Cuchamatanes Highlands of western Guatemala and suggests that splinter groups began moving into the Lowlands by ca. 1400 B.C., reaching as far north as Dzibilchalrun by approximately 1000 B.C. If this model is correct, these early pioneers pre­sumably would have brought with them ideas about pottery from Highland traditions established in the Antigua Valley, at Karninaljuyu, and elsewhere (see Robinson et al. 2005). Geographically intermedi­ate early Formative complexes, particularly Xox (1200-800 B.C. [Sharer and Sedat 1987:428]) in Alta Verapaz, could have provided "stepping­stones" linking purported Highland areas with the Lowlands. The impact of historical linguistic stud­ies on the understanding of early Maya prehistory is discussed in detail below. 
More recently, from excavations and analysis of lithic assemblages at Colha and nearby sites, Ice­land (1997, 2005; also Hester et al. 1996) has argued that groups living by inland swamps and chert outcrops in northern Belize were ethnic pre­cursors to the Maya. Based on continuities in set-

tlement and chipped stone technologies, Iceland links these occupants with later village dwellers of the region. An important aspect of the proposed lithic continuity is the practice of removing pris­matic blades from cores by direct hard percussion. Such macroblades appear as early as ca. 3000 B.C. (Wilson et al. 1998) and continue through the Pre­classic and Classic periods. Indeed, every aspect of the "Colha Lithic Tradition" (Potter 1991; see Ice­land 2005) is found in preceramic deposits and continues unbroken until the Postclassic, when soft hammer percussion came into use along with imported chalcedony and new projectile point forms (Iceland 2005:21). 
The implications oflceland's (1997, 2005) study for the rest of the Lowlands, or even elsewhere in Belize, are far from clear. For example, Clark and Cheetham (2002) have expanded on Iceland's proposition to address Cunil predecessors in cen­tral Belize by assuming that the northern Belize pre­ceramic tradition was geographically restricted. Clark and Cheetham suggest that the Belize River Valley was occupied by a different preceramic pop­ulation and note that "the territorial complemen­tarity evinced between Cunil and Swasey goes back to Preceramic times before either group adopted ceramic technology" (2002:306; but see Awe 1992:364). Support for this argument comes from the apparent absence of Archaic period constricted adzes and Lowe points and also by dating Cunil a full century or more before Swasey. Recent prece­ramic data from central (Lohse 2008; Lohse and Awe 2007; McAnany and Murata 2006; Murata 2009; Wrobel et al. 2007) and southern Belize (Prufer 2008) dispel much of this claim, and a care­ful analysis of published dates from both regions (presented below; also Lohse 2009) reveals that the case for placing Cunil a century or more before Swasey is less than secure. 
The origins of other early Lowland ceramic tra­ditions, too, warrant attention, and new and ongo­ing projects are likely to produce important information about the nature of these early soci­eties and the people who preceded them. For exam­ple, early excavations by the Peabody Museum at Seibal (also Ceibal) and the Altar de Sacrificios along the Pasion Drainage uncovered modest Xe deposits that were dated to approximately 600-900 
B.C. (Willey 1973; Willey et al. 1975). New research at Ceibal (Inomata et al. 2008; Ponciano et al. 2006) has encountered platformed Xe con­structions that appear to be among the largest pre­600 B.C. architecture yet documented in the Lowlands. These constructions signify large early populations, perhaps with preceramic antecedents. 
In the northern Peten, research at Nakbe in the Mirador Basin has recorded precocious Middle Preclassic developments (Clark et al. 2000; Hansen 1998, 2005; Hansen et al. 2002). Evidence for early occupations consists of earthen floors, postholes in bedrock, and radiocarbon dates that span ca. 1500-840 B.C. at one sigma (Hansen 1998:Table ' 1, 2005:Table 5.1). These dates come from rem­nant paleosols that underlie the eastern groups at Nakbe (Hansen 1998:55-56, 2005:58, 62), and accompanying ceramic associations are described as "poor" (Hansen 1998:55) and "extremely sparse" (Hansen 2005:62). The earliest ceramic phase, Early Ox, is dated to 1000-800 B.C. (Clark et al. 2000:500; Hansen 2005:58), but if the earlier radiocarbon assays reflect human activity, then the question of precisely when the region was first occupied remains unclear. Paleoenvironmental work at Lago Puerto Arturo (Wahl et al. 2006 ), west of the Mirador Basin, indicates an Archaic presence with maize by at least ca. 2600 B.C., rais­ing the likelihood that future work at or near Nakbe may recover material remains of these preceramic horticulturalists. 

Discussion of Previous Models for the Earliest (Village) Maya 
Although little consensus exists about the nature, identity, or origin(s) of the earliest Maya, infor­mation from recent years challenges prevailing views about their relationship to earlier inhabitants of the region. It is now known from Paleoindian data in Belize (Hester et al. 1981; Lohse et al. 2006; Pearson and Bostrom 1998; Valdez andAylseworth 2005; Zeitlin 1984 ), Highland Guatemala (Brown 1980; Gruhn et al. 1977), and northern Yucatan (Gonzalez et al. 2008) that people were in this region long before ceramics and village life. More­over, evidence for preceramic horticulture in the central Peten (Cowgill and Hutchinson 1963; Islebe et al. 1996; Vaughan et al. 1985; Wahl et al. 2006). southeastern zones (Rue 1989; Rue et al. 2002), and northern Yucatan (Whitmore et al. 1996) based on paleoenvironmental and pollen studies (see Leyden 2002) has long been available. Yet these data remain

to be integrated into a model that also accommo­
dates early Middle Preclassic developments. Aside 
from the incomplete nature of the record, one rea­
son for this lack of agreement involves the differ­
ent lines of evidence for defining "Maya." In some 
cases, the term refers to sedentary occupants of the 
region, while in other usages it pertains specifi­
cally to distinct ethnic groups defined by language, 
writing, or both. Reconciling these ethnicities with 
the material record prior to the point(s) in time 
where they overlap remains a confounding issue. 
Relying on material data alone, as Iceland ( 1997, 2005) and early ceramic-based models do, schol­ars have proposed material connections between early occupants of the Lowlands and those of later time periods that are more securely identified as Maya. However, aside from the work around Colha, these reconstructions routinely stop at the earliest signs of village life. An alternative to using mate­rial traits relies on systems of cultural expression, such as language or script, that can be linked to ethnographically or historically documented eth­nic Maya. Yet, if these data are the standard, then researchers are even more limited in their time depth. Maya writing demonstrates canons of con­tinuity from the late sixteenth century to the first century A.D. (Houston 2000:142, Table 1). Dis­covery of an early text at San Bartolo in the east­central Peten pushes this date back to 400-200 B.C. (Satumo et al. 2006). Houston (2000: 143) notes that the earliest scripts demonstrate clear stylistic rela­tionships with those seen on terminal Olmec mon­uments like La Venta Monument 13 and San Miguel Amuco Stela l. By the Classic period, from ca. A.D. 250 onward, whatever linguistic variation existed in the Lowlands was at least partly ameliorated by the use of Classic Ch' olti' an as a universal language of the elite class (Houston 2000). Yet, by this time, the Lowlands had almost certainly been occupied i by Mayan speakers for at least 1,000 years if not 
longer. 
Problematic is that precisely when Mayan 
speakers entered the Lowlands and where they 
came from remain unknown and somewhat con­
troversial. Kaufman's (1976) historical recon­
struction places them perhaps as early as 1400 B.C. 
and remains influential today (e.g., Sharer and 
Traxler 2006:Figure 1.3). However, glot­
tochronology is poorly suited for addressing the 
causes for language splintering or for identifying 
exogenous sources of influence at key junctures of dialect change. Regarding its usefulness for recon­structing temporal sequences at all, Houston et al. note that the technique offers "at best imprecise results and at worst spurious certainty of chronol­ogy" (2000:326; also Brody 2000:339). Addition­ally, in the absence of corroborating indicators that place language-specific populations in any partic­ular region by an early date, reconstructed popula­tion movements are highly speculative and possibly inaccurate. Many more data are available today regarding regional settlement histories than when Kaufman (1976) published his study, and his impli­cation that the Lowlands were vacant linguistic ter­rain until the breakup of proto-Mayan is disproved. Finally, his reasons for identifying the Saloma region of the Cuchumatanes Highlands as the source area for proto-Mayan are untenable. These include that proto-Mayan includes terms for both highland and lowland flora and fauna and that "in this area, lowland people are ignorant of highland products but highland people are aware of lowland products" (Kaufman 1976:104). On this basis, Kaufman notes that the proto-Mayan homeland must have been in the Highlands but close to river systems that connect to the Lowlands. Saloma, located close to several small rivers flowing north and northeast, appears as the best candidate. If he refers to contemporary populations, this is a diffi­cult notion to sustain in the modem era of eco­nomic integration. If he refers to prehispanic populations, then the statement is equally ques­tionable; long-distance trade goods from the High­lands, specifically obsidian, are present in Lowland contexts as early as ca. 900 B.C., if not earlier (see below). Kaufman (1976:104) also notes that it is easier to move downstream than upstream; hence, early proto-Mayan speakers must have moved from Highlands to Lowlands. Considering that virtually every region of the Western Hemisphere, includ­ing extreme elevations, was explored if not popu­lated by the end of the Pleistocene (Dillehay 2000), the Highland-to-Lowland direction of movement based on least resistance is spurious. Early explor­ers and occupants of Central America traveled both up and down steep slopes and often did so repeat­edly over the course of annual cycles. As a result, historical linguistic reconstructions for precisely when and, equally important, whence early Mayan speakers entered the Lowlands should be viewed

with skepticism. This remains an important topic 
to be addressed by historical linguistic research. 
The general impasse found in present-day 
research on Maya origins was summed up nearly 
40 years ago by Puelston and Puleston when they 
argued that "the data gives us little evidence for the 
presence of pre-ceramic hunter-gatherers. Never­
theless we have little reason to suspect that Pre­
classic Maya were derived from indigenous 
groups" (1971:331). This statement reflects what 
I consider to be two dimensions of the problem 
regarding the earliest Maya: ( 1) by definition, 
"Maya" could not have occupied the Lowlands 
before the appearance of settled village life, and (2) 
data available to the contrary are commonly over­looked in favor of sedentism, use of ceramics, and long-distance trade and exchange. Overcoming this problem involves not only evaluating all available information concerning possible continuities with the pre-sedentary record but also recognizing prob­lems in terms of how "Maya" are recognized and defined in the first place. 
Below, I examine three lines of evidence (sub­sistence, economy and technology, and dating and stratigraphy), such as they are available, for impor­tant late Archaic and early Middle Preclassic deposits and sites (Figure 3). By outlining topics that might be looked at more closely in the future, my objective is to demonstrate cultural continuity from Archaic to "Maya" periods and in so doing build the case that culturally Maya peoples occu­pied these regions long before they adopted seden­tary ways of life. 
Subsistence 
Although Willey ( 1966) defined Mesoamerican tra­ditions by village life and agricultural production, it is now known that food production became increasingly important in Archaic diets after 3400 
B.C. The progression of food production utilizing swidden methods to full-blown agriculture appears to have been a long, slow one that extended even into the Middle Preclassic (Pohl et al. 1996). Con­sequently, "agriculture" can no longer be viewed as a requirement for the appearance of settled life or identified as a causal factor in social complex­ity in lowland Mesoamerica (e.g., Blake et al. I 992; Neff et al. 2006). Nevertheless, because of the extended record through macrobotanical and pollen 
studies, food-related practices can help indicate 
cultural continuity or discontinuity from the 
Archaic onward. 
In terms of Archaic diet, work by Mary Pohl and her colleagues ( 1996) across northern Belize iden­tified trace maize and manioc pollen grains before 3000 B.C. After 2400 B.C., maize cultivation increased dramatically, along with evidence that inhabitants were clearing and burning forested areas in order to create habitats favorable for grow­ing maize; by 1500 B.C., maize was ubiquitous. This includes not only these sites in northern Belize (Jones 1994; Pohl et al. 1996) but also near Blue Creek in northwestern Belize (Beach et al. 2009), Actun Halal in central Belize (Jones and Hallock 2008), in the Holmul region in eastern Guatemala (Wahl and Estrada-Belli 2008), and in central (Pule­ston and Puleston 1971:332; Vaughan et al. 1985) and northern (Wahl et al. 2006) Peten. These find­ings essentially duplicate what John Jones (1994) and John Jacob (I 995) had earlier reported at Cob­web Swamp near Colha. Although maize and (probably) manioc production was commonplace elsewhere in Mesoamerica as well, it is clear that no significant break in the paleoenvironmental record marks the initial appearance of sedentism. Rather, continuity in some forms of food produc­tion can be seen from Archaic to early Middle Pre­classic times. 
Continuity is seen not only in gradually increas­ing reliance on cultigens but also in the pattern of localized resource exploitation. This comparison evaluates Archaic components at Pulltrouser Swamp and Actun Halal, where inventories of food­stuffs strongly reflect local settings, against pub­lished early Middle Preclassic data. Excavations into lower levels at Pulltrouser revealed evidence of what Pohl and her colleagues call a "mixed indigenous economy" (1996:363) of hunting and fishing. In addition to early domesticates such as maize and manioc and nondomesticated foodstuffs including fruit trees such as sapodilla, Pohl et al. (1996) recovered the remains of freshwater fish, snakes, small mammals such as armadillo, and tur­tles. All of these species are common in low-lying swampy environs and reflect the utilization of prox­imate subsistence resources. 
Unlike the swamp margin setting of Pulltrouser, Actun Halal is located in the karstic drainage of the Macal River Valley. Halal is a 30-m-long rock-

low-lying areas, these animals included reptiles and other taxa associated with swamp settings. In upland areas, key resources included small and medium-sized forest species. Early domesticates contributed somewhat to this diet and are perhaps best seen as a way to offset the risks of food short­ages or overcome variation in the seasonal avail­ability of other primary resources. 
These subsistence patterns compare favorably with the early Middle Preclassic remains. Carbon isotope studies on early, ca. 900 B.C., burials from northern Belize indicate only a modest reliance on maize. Specific data come from Swasey-period burials from Cuello (Tykot et al. 1996; van der Merwe et al. 2000) and from a female found in a possible canal in northern Belize (Pohl et al. 1996). Isotopic studies indicate that early populations from Cuello relied upon maize as a component of their diet, but only to a moderate degree.

these remains include armadillo _and dog, both of which consumed maize through grazing or scav­enging rather than being fed by humans (van der Merwe et al. 2000:24). Considering this alternate source for C4 carbon, maize represented less than 30 percent of the Preclassic diet at Cuello (van der Merwe et al. 2000:29). Later examples from Cahal Pech, dating to the Middle Preclassic, also indicate modest reliance on maize, with consumption of this crop not significantly increasing until after 400 
B.C. (Powis et al. 1999:372). 
Early Middle Preclassic fauna also resemble the Archaic pattern, with sites relying heavily on locally available species. Leslie Shaw ( 1999) ana­lyzed two early Middle Preclassic middens at Colha (Anthony and Black 1994) and has identified a wide variety of freshwater fish, reptiles, and small to medium mammals. Based on her analysis, Shaw describes a picture of "diversified hunting, fishing, and collecting in the immediate habitat" (1999:88). Marilyn Masson (2004:Table 7 .3) examined a smaller sample of Middle Preclassic fauna from the same part of the site and adds deer, dogs, and tur­tles to the list of early fauna. In spite of small per­centage differences in each animal class, all three assemblages reflect the broad-based exploitation of local resources. 
Analyses of early Middle Preclassic remains 
· 
from Cuello (Wing and Scudder 1991) also indi­cate a broad-based hunting/collecting strategy focusing on local resources. Important species found at Cuello include dog, white-tailed deer, armadillo, peccary, and turtles. One primary dif­ference between the Cuello and Colha data is the higher frequency of fish at Colha compared to the frequency for the same time period at Cuello. This difference might be explained by the fact that Cuello is located farther inland and, although not far from the New River, may have been far enough 
at 96.85-96.80) 4340-4050 B.C. 
from water that the utilization of freshwater fish was less important to the local diet in that early village. 
An important Middle Preclassic assemblage from the Tolok residential group near Cahal Pech shows virtually the same pattern demonstrated at northern Belize sites. Based on analysis of a mid­den behind Structure 1 at the Tolok group, Powis et al. (1999:374) describe the Middle Preclassic food economy at Cahal Pech as reflecting a broad subsistence base that included not only maize but also locally available terrestrial faunas such as deer, dog, armadillos, rabbits, and agouti; some birds including turkeys and curassow; and freshwater shellfish and fish. An important component not seen in sites to the north is the pearly mussel, which thrives in the sandy-bottom, quickly moving streams of central Belize (Powis 2004). Remains of these pelecypods are found in large quantities at least by the Middle Preclassic if not earlier, and they were a significant component of local diets. Like the freshwater fish at Colha vs. Cuello, pearly mus­sel represents an important local resource that helps to define subsistence patterns between sites located in different environments. 

Importantly, even as reliance on maize agricul­ture increased through the Preclassic, use of local fauna persisted. For example, analysis of Late Pre­classic fauna (Masson 2004) from the same part of Colha that produced the early Middle Preclassic samples also reveals high species diversity among animal remains (Figure 5). It appears that by the Late Preclassic, hunting, trapping, and collecting of wild fauna had become one strategy for supple­menting an otherwise agricultural subsistence regime. 
In addition to the steady increase in the impor­tance of maize in local diets, another important dif­ference between Archaic and early Middle Preclassic subsistence data is the trace presence of

reef fish remains in inland fauna middens after ca. 900 B.C. These species have been found at both northern and central Belize sites, indicating the widespread pattern of importing this resource. Because they occur in such low frequencies, it is unlikely that deep-sea reef fish were a significant source of protein in early Middle Preclassic com­munities. Rather, their primary importance may have been economic, that of exotic goods not locally available, rather than related to diet. 
This discussion illustrates the relationship between incipient maize-based horticulture and other forms of getting protein in the context of the Archaic-to-Preclassic transition. Clearly, Archaic peoples were consuming at least some maize and other domesticates in addition to nondomesticated forest foods and locally available sources of pro­tein. Indeed, pollen evidence has shown that food production preceded recognizable village life in the Lowlands by over a millennium. In the early Middle Preclassic, people do not seem to have been heavily reliant on maize, though the importance of agriculture steadily increased throughout the mid-die and Late Preclassic. In contrast, early Middle Preclassic villagers relied heavily on undomesti­cated forest garden foods, as well as animals that were specific to localized habitats, as had their Archaic predecessors. 

Economy and Technology 

Two additional lines of evidence for contextualiz­ing theArchaic-to-Preclassic transition involve eco­nomic and technological patterns. By "economic patterns," I refer to the movement through trade or other mechanisms of goods and resources across intermediate (intraregional) and long (interre­gional) distances. The distinction between intrare­gional and long-distance movements is important, as the earliest recognized lowland villages so far all contain exotic goods. "Technological patterns" refers to the manufacture of some tool forms and what this might tell researchers about how those tools were used. Understanding the nature and sources of possible early influences in the Lowlands is critical for accurately characterizing the transi-

tion from residentially mobile forager­horticulturalists to sedentary village life. Likewise, discerning important technological trends, primar­ily in stone tool production, can help archaeologists identify examples of possible cultural continuity or discontinuity from preceramic to settled life. 

In light of the significance of long-distance exchange in the Preclassic and Classic, it is impor­tant to consider the degree to which, or even if, pre­ceramic populations also engaged in trade with other regions in Mesoamerica. To date, little evi­dence indicates that Low land Archaic peoples prac­ticed any form of long-distance· trade. The only suggestion that preceramic groups participated in larger exchange networks is by Zeitlin (1984), based on the first three of four seasons of the Belize Archaic Archaeological Reconnaissance (BAAR) project, directed by Richard MacN eish, Antoinette Nelken-Terner, and others from 1980 to 1983. Zeitlin notes that "the small number of imported obsidian flakes and the use of nonlocal volcanic rock for ground stone tools disclosed by our exca­vations indicate that some mechanism for long­distance commodity procurement had already been established in Belize" (1984:366). Unfortunately, excavations into Archaic deposits at Colha (Iceland I 997) and Pulltrouser Swamp (Pohl et al. 1996) and published preceramic findings from elsewhere (e.g., Lohse 2008; McAnany and Murata 2006; 
Murata 2009; Rosenswig 2004; Rosenswig and Masson 2001) have yet to identify any exotic mate­rials. Furthermore, many of the sites investigated by the BAAR were located in sandy topsoils prone to disturbance and mixing, making it possible that exotic goods discarded during later occupations became intermingled with earlier components. Aside from Zeitlin's (1984) comment, no other long-distance or exotic item has been reported from a preceramic deposit in the Maya Lowlands. 
The absence of data for exotic goods should not be taken to mean that preceramic groups did not engage in long-distance exchange. Indeed, Archaic trade networks have been identified elsewhere in Mesoamerica. Barbara Voorhies (2004) and her colleagues argue that coastal Chantuto peoples in southern Mexico obtained obsidian both directly from closer sources and indirectly from more dis­tant sources. Also, in the Basin of Mexico, Chris­tine Neiderberger ( 1979) suggests that sedentary Archaic peoples may have acquired green obsid­
ian through indirect networks rather than directly 
at the source. Working near the town of Tecolutla 
along the northern Veracrnz coast, Jeffery Wilker­
son (1975) recorded obsidian from Queretaro, over 
330 km distant, and suggests trade as one possible 
mechanism for how that material ended up in Palo 
Hueco deposits, ca. 2900 B.C. These examples 
illustrate the potential for trade networks to have 
existed in Mesoamerica long before sedentism. 
While archaeologists cannot yet conclude whether 
long-distance trade was an important aspect of pre­
ceramic economic systems in the Maya Lowlands, 
currently available evidence suggests that it was 
not. 

Recognizing intraregional exchange can be more difficult than identifying the presence of long­distance networks due to the fact that very few notable resources are present in this region. "Notable" refers to materials that are easily iden­tified if found away from areas where they natu­rally occur. Maya Mountain granite, chert from the Northern Belize Chert-Bearing Zone (NBCBZ; also Colha chert), and marine goods are three exam­ples. Another factor is that archaeologists currently understand preceramic settlement to have been 
mobile, with groups moving from one resource area to another depending on seasonal availability. This means that any related movement of goods may reflect this system of settlement mobility rather than actual exchange. Finally, adequate site data, too, are lacking. For example, since preceramic sites have yet to be explored in southern Belize, it is not known if Archaic people there utilized gran­ite. Similarly, preceramic foragers along the coast might have fished for reef fish or used marine shells and simply not carried those remains to sites far­ther inland. Future research is needed to clarify the possible movements of resources from these areas. 
The only evidence suggesting that goods might have moved even short distances during the Archaic comes from Lowe points that were made of NBCBZ chert. This material ranges from banded or mottled gray to yellowish or dark brown and is often opaque and sometimes faintly translucent (Shafer and Hester 1983:521). It is of uniformly high quality and was exploited from Paleoindian times until the Postclassic. At least two specimens from central Belize are sufficiently well preserved that they can be identified as having come from the Colha area. These include one specimen recovered

at the Caves Branch rockshelter (Wrobel et al. 2007) and another found near San Ignacio. A third specimen made from Colha chert (Valdez and Aylseworth 2005 :36) was recovered near August Pine Ridge, also outside the NBCBZ. Because so many known Archaic points are heavily patinated, it is likely that many more specimens of NBCBZ Belize chert might also be found in nearby regions. However, a few specimens are also known that are not of northern Belize chert (Figure 6). From these data it is clear that preceramic peoples of the East­ern Lowlands exploited a wide range of lithic out­crops across a relatively large area and that at least some tools made of high-quality material traveled beyond their points of origin. 
This pattern of weakly developed trade is in stark contrast to that observed for the early Middle Preclassic. Reef fish and marine shell from the Caribbean appear in middens in central and north­ern Belize (Hohmann and Powis 1996; Shaw 1999). At Blackman Eddy, additional nonlocal items include stingray spines, granite, and polished green­s tone (Garber et al. 2004a:32). All of these goods, as well as obsidian, are also found in Cun ii deposits at Cahal Pech (Awe 1992; Healy et al. 2004: 1 15). Based on evidence from these two sites alone, long­distance trade networks were clearly established by the beginning of the first millennium B.C. In this context, the apparent absence of exotic goods in preceramic deposits is among the most striking dif­ferences between the Archaic and Preclassic. 

Of course, pottery also showed up at this time, and the nature of early assemblages reveals some­thing of the conditions under which they appeared. Elsewhere in Mesoamerica, early assemblages are characterized by a low diversity of vessel forms. Arnold ( 1999), sees the high frequency of teco­mates in the early Formative (ca. 1500-900 B.C.) at La Joya on the Gulf Coast as an indication of residential mobility. In the Mazatan region of south­ern Mexico's Pacific coast, Clark (l 994:Figures 71-72) notes that tecomates constitute 81 percent

of Barra (1550-1400 B.C.) assemblages and that this figure drops to 55.8 percent in the succeeding Locona phase ( 1400-1250 B.C. ). Clark (1994) sees Barra as the beginning of true sedentism in the region and has argued that increases in assemblage diversity and sophistication, along with other important developments such as increases in plat­form size and some forms of public architecture, reveal agentive, self-motivated behaviors that underlie rank differences and emergent social dis­tinctions (Clark 2000; Clark and Blake 1994). While even the earliest Mazatan pottery was ele­gant (Clark I 994:473), gradual changes in assem­blage composition indicate that processes associated with rank society occurred over time and did not appear all at once at the outset. Recent work on Guatemala's Pacific coast (Morgan and Valle 2007) also records a steady increase in assem­blage variation, from nearly all tecomates to a mix­ture of many different forms, between ca. 1350 and 800 B.C. In contrast, Cunil assemblages from Belize appear at the outset with a diversity of forms. Garber et al. describe Cunil as a "well-developed technology" (2004a:28) and note no evidence of experimentation. Awe had earlier described Cunil as "by no means experimental ... represent[ing] a ceramic tradition that had been developed for some time" ( 1992:230). Early assemblages from north­ern Belize are similarly described (Bartlett et al. 2000; Kosakowsky 1987; Kosakowsky and Pring 1998; McAnany and Lopez 1999; Valdez 1987). 
In the absence of data to the contrary, it remains possible that ceramic technology developed in situ in the Maya Lowlands rather than as a result of external influence. However, this seems improba­ble considering the character of the earliest assem­blages. Rather, evidence indicates that the appearance and spread of ceramic technology occurred under a more compressed time frame than elsewhere and also in a different settlement con­text than that reconstructed for the Pacific and Gulf Coast regions. Sourcing studies needed to confirm the origin(s) of the earliest Lowland Maya pottery are only now under way (e.g., Sullivan 2006). How­ever, such work done on slightly later assemblages from K' ax ob, dating to ca. 800 B.C. (Bartlett et al. 2000), reveals that these vessels were made using locally and regionally available clay and temper resources. Pending future analyses, it appears that early Maya potters were exposed at least to ideas regarding fully formed assemblages and vessel diversity, if not to the actual ceramics themselves. 
In addition to exchange networks and the appearance of pottery, whether produced locally or acquired through trade, important technological information concerning the Archaic-to-Preclassic transition comes from chipped-stone artifacts. Many of these technological details involving tool production at Colha are previously reported (Hes­ter et al. 1996; Iceland 1997, 2005; Wilson et al. 1998). The discussion here focuses on Archaic stone tools that have been found elsewhere, their possible roles in subsistence practices, and what this might have meant for the earliest village Maya. 
The Northern Belize Chert-Bearing Zone has been identified as important for precerarnic stone tool production as early as 3000 B.C., and many of the traits developed during the Archaic can be traced through the Preclassic and Classic periods as well. These include use of hard hammer macroblades and macroflakes as blanks for tool manufacture, and limited biface production that became increasingly important and specialized over time and that used more controlled methods, such as soft hammer and direct pressure, for removing flakes (see Iceland 1997, 2005). These practices provide the most con­vincing evidence to date for continuity from the Archaic to the Preclassic in the Maya Lowlands and identify Colha as an important region for prece­ramic populations. Based on the relatively inten­sive manufacture of constricted adzes at what appear to be special-purpose workshops, Iceland (2005) further argues that at least some form of eco­nomic specialization relating to stone tool produc­tion was present in the late Archaic. 

Recent work, however, reveals that similar tool­production activities occurred across a much wider area, even in places where raw material was not so plentiful as in northern Belize. Constricted adzes have recently been recovered from surface con­texts in far northwestern Belize and in excavation at Actun Halal (Figure 7). These tools were bifa­cially worked from locally available chert of poor quality. Previous studies (Hudler and Lohse 1994; Lohse 2008) have demonstrated that these general­purpose tools were used for woodcutting, exhibit frequent contact with soil, and were ideally suited for the kinds of horticultural activities that charac­terized this early period. These artifacts are impor­tant in indicating the widespread presence of late

Archaic peoples across a variety of habitats in the Eastern Lowlands, not just those areas in proxim­ity to the NBCBZ. In spite of the wide occurrence of constricted adzes, archaeologists working else­where have yet to document the kind of macrob­lade production found near Colha. It is probable that Archaic tool manufacturing in the NBCBZ took place with greater intensity than it did else­where, likely because of the abundance of high­quality material available here. 
Further evidence for the importance of bifacial flaking comes from the growing number of reported Archaic Lowe and Sawmill points, including from southern Belize, the Belize River Valley, and across northern Belize (Awe and Lohse 2007; Morgan et al. 2008). Many of these artifacts were finely flaked using a variety of techniques including hard and soft hammer flaking, direct pressure, and perhaps even indirect percussion (Figure 8). Indicative traits include broad, flat flake scars with minimal nega­tive bulb scars on each face; precisely formed stems and barbs from controlled pressure flaking; and deeply notched comers formed by indirect per­cussion. Together with previously published Archaic points characterized by well-controlled parallel oblique flaking (Kelly 1993:216, Figures 8-9; Lohse et al. 2006:217, Figure 6g-i), it is clear that virtually all of the stone-working techniques practiced in later times were also present in the Archaic, if not earlier. Importantly, these traits also appear on artifacts that were not made on NBCBZ materials, indicating that they were widely prac­ticed across a much larger region. 
Some Lowland Archaic points reveal further cultural similarities with later peoples in terms of subsistence-related technological behavior. Based on the strong alternate bevel found on the blades of most Lowe points, Clark and Cheetham (2002) note that they probably served as hafted knives rather than as projectiles. This same trait also char­acterizes Sawmill points (Kelly 1993 :216), though to a lesser degree. Examination of additional spec­imens confirms this observation; no available illus­tration or artifact shows any firm evidence for the kind of impact damage from contact with hard material such as bone or stone that characterizes true projectile points elsewhere. Rather, many are significantly resharpened, sometimes all the way down to the haft element. Additionally, many Lowe and Sawmill points are clearly serrated along one or both edges (see Figures 6a, 8), indicating their use as cutting implements. The absence, so far, of any evidence for projectile-based technology in the Lowland Archaic foreshadows the importance of handheld tool kits and weapon systems until at least the fourth century A.O., when the atlatl is argued to have been introduced into the Lowlands from central Mexico (Schele and Freidel 1990: 146-1 47),

Radiocarbon and Stratigraphy 
Archaeologists are only now learning what the tran­sition from the Archaic to the Preclassic looked like in terms of subsistence and material culture, yet it remains unclear precisely when this transition occurred. The "Precerarnic" has been described as extending to approximately 900 B.C. at Colha (Ice­land 1997), while the early Middle Preclassic has been dated as early as 1000 B.C. (Hammond and Gerhardt 1990) at Cuello, 900 B.C. at Colha (Valdez 1987), and 800 B.C. at K'axob (McAnany 2004; McAnany and Lopez 1999); from 700 B.C. to slightly before 800 B.C. in the Northern Low­lands (Anderson 2003; Andrews et al. 2008; Andrews and Robles 2004); to perhaps 1000 B.C. in the Mirador Basin (Hansen 1998, 2005); and, by

some consensus, to 1100 B.C. in central Belize. Based on these estimates, theArchaic-to-Preclassic transition occurred roughly between 1200 and 800 
B.C. or even later. Absolute dates from this inter­val are therefore critically important for two rea­sons. First, judicious use of absolute dating can clarify the record of cultural change across the Low­lands with greater temporal resolution than that attainable through stylistic cross dating of ceramic types, many of which themselves are not securely dated. Second, site-by-site chronologies built on robust series of absolute dates taken from (and con­sidered in) secure stratigraphic contexts reveal when and how this process took place, whether it involved occupation continuities or hiatuses, and when certain sites became "sedentary" while oth­ers were not. 
Clearly, theArchaic-to-Preclassic transition was a region-wide phenomenon that took place across the entire Lowlands. From available data, it does not appear to have occurred at the same time or under identical circumstances everywhere. Indeed, there is no reason to expect that it did, particularly if one of the major forces that impelled this shift was economic, as suggested by data presented above. Rather, the probable scenario for this period is of nascent sedentists coexisting alongside mobile groups, both of which were pursuing generalized horticulturalist-forager subsistence practices (see Clark and Cheetham 2002; Iceland 2005). Com­piling a regional radiocarbon chronology from site­specific sequences may be the best way to identify these trends. 
Care must be taken to identify aberrant dates that skew the transition too early or too late. Below, I review portions of dated sequences from Cuello and Colha in northern Belize and from Cahal Pech, Blackman Eddy, andActun Halal in central Belize. Each site offers a series of dates that can be used to evaluate early settlement from the late Archaic to the early Middle Preclassic. This sample includes dates that have been used to establish pottery and village life before 1000 B.C. at Cuello, Blackman Eddy, and Cahal Pech, arguably the earliest per­manent sites yet known in the Maya Lowlands. I also evaluate assays from arguably the two best­dated Lowland Archaic sites, Operation 4046 at Colha and Actun Halal. All dates are discussed at their greatest probability within a two-sigma range of error and are presented as calibrated calendar ages. All dates were taken from their original pub­lications and calibrated using the online Ox Cal ver­sion 4.0.5 calibration program (Bronk Ramsey 2008; Table 2). Clearly, issues of sampling affect these reconstructions, and future work may alter the current view. 
Some radiocarbon sequences are not included. Several dates extending as early as 1500 B.C. come from Nakbe (Clark et al. 2000; Hansen 1998, 2005) but are not reviewed here. Specific contextual and stratigraphic details of sample locations are not published in sufficient detail to permit an inde­pendent evaluation of whether the earliest of these dates are associated with sedentism and pottery. Researchers there have furthermore not made the claim forpre-1000 B.C. village life, noting only that people seem to have been in the area by around 1500 B.C., perhaps living close to bajos near the site center (Hansen 1998:55-56), and that pottery truly appeared only after 1000 B.C. Recent pale­oecological work at Lago Puerto Arturo (Wahl et al. 2006) indicates disturbed habitats and early cultigen production by ca. 2650 B.C. and shows the potential for preceramic data at Nakbe. Addi­tionally, 22 dates from Chechem Ha Cave (Moyes 2006; Moyes et al. 2009) are also not included. These include several assays extending beyond 1000 B.C. and many associated with pottery in the first millennium B.C. However, as at Nakbe, it is not clear that pre-1000 B.C. dates are attributable to humans; no corroborating evidence such as culti­gens or artifacts presently indicates human pres­ence. Without such supporting indicators, it remains possible that the dated carbon is of natural, non­cultural origin. Finally, dates for early domestica­tion and environmental modification have been published by Pohl et al. (l 996:Table I). Of the many localities included in that study, evidence from Pulltrouser Swamp indicates an Archaic camp. Individual contexts and stratigraphic sequences at Pulltrouser have yet to be presented as a discrete set, however, and so these dates are not reviewed here. Nevertheless, that sequence, together with the record at Colha, probably remains the best general description of the late Archaic in the Lowlands.

classic village development (Hammond, ed. 1991). Moreover, the record of over 80 published dates from carefully recorded early contexts surpasses that of nearly any other site in the Maya world. Based on clearly documented stratigraphic con­texts, a series of development phases is defined from the site center that extends from Phase 0, the earliest recognized occupation, to Phase XI (Ham­mond et al. 1991 ). In correlating the site's radio­carbon, construction, and ceramic chronologies, Hammond places Phases 0, I, and II with the Swasey complex and Phases III and IIIA with the Bladen complex. While abundant data from the Preclassic and Classic are available from many of the site's major structures and surrounding settle­ment, Cuello is perhaps best known for the evidence it contains for early village life. 

Early work, however, led to confusion about the first appearance of sedentary villages (Andrews and Hammond 1990; Marcus 1983; Potter et al. 1984). Excavations conducted in 1975-1976 pro­duced age estimates for what was termed an early Preclassic component dating from approximately 2500/2000-1000 B.C. (Hammond 1977; Ham­mond et al. 1976). While these dates were not uni­versally accepted at the time (Marcus 1983; Potter et al. 1984 ), they had a large impact on the schol­arly community. For example, MacNeish used the proposed date for the beginnings of village life, approximately 2000 B.C., as the end date for his provisional sequence of preceramic phases for Belize (MacNeish et al. 1980). Many of the early dates from the 1975-1976 seasons have since been rejected for several possible reasons, including the recycling of old carbon into later contexts (Ham­mond et al. 1977), and the overall chronology of the site has been greatly revised (Andrews and Hammond 1990). Below, I review published dates from after the 1975-1976 seasons that have been i assigned to Phases 0-IIIA, as well as a more recent group of assays (Hammond et al. 1995) that also returned early age estimations. This review helps resolve the early confusion and also demonstrates how the process of founding early villages obscured Archaic deposits that might be located in those 

same locations. 
Andrews and Hammond (l 990:Table 1) list 72 
dates from different time periods. Hammond et al. 
(I991:Table 3.1) list 84 dates, including three obsid­
ian hydration dates; 12 of these are not in the pre­vious publication. Of these 84 dates, 37 come from Phases 0-IIIA. An additional 12 assays were pub­lished by Hammond et al. (1995), including 11 listed in their Table 1 and a twelfth, OxA-4542, mentioned in the text (Hammond et al. 1995:124). None of these 12 dates are ascribed to phases, though they all fall into the early end of Cuello's chronology (see Table 2). It is not clear how many of the 37 phased dates (those published before 1995) were collected after the problematic 1975-1976 seasons; Andrews and Hammond (1990:Table 1) list three samples (LJ-4919, LJ­4922, and LJ-4923) as being post-1976 determi­nations, while Hammond et al. (1995 :Table 3.1) list these among the 1975-1976 dates. To minimize ambiguity, I omitted these three samples from this review, leaving 32 remaining assays. One of these, OxA-361, was considered unacceptable by the excavators (Hammond et al. 1995:Table 3.1) and so was also excluded. The resulting 31 dates (Fig­ure 9) are the best representation of Swasey-and Bladen-period constructions at the site. 
A small number of the 31 post-197 6 Swasey and Bladen assays predate 1000 B.C. The earliest, OxA­4461 (1456-1049 B.C.), comes from Burial 179, a 12-to 15-year-old female found with an infant, Burial 180, at her chest (Hammond et al. 1995: 127). Burials 179 and 180 were recovered close to but stratigraphically below Burials 176, 177, and 178, all of which were found with associated grave goods that included Bladen-style bowls, jar sherds, and even jade jewelry. All five burials were located in a thin paleosol that covers portions of the site area. Parts of this paleosol were removed by the Maya when they constructed their initial dwellings on the exposed bedrock surface; elsewhere it was left in place. While Burials 176, 177, and 178 are of the Bladen phase based on associated goods, Burials 179 and 180 are distinct in that they had no grave offerings. 
Hammond et al. (1995: 127) compare Burial 179 to Burial 62, which had earlier been dated to approximately the same time (OxA-1649, 1402-1055 B.C.; and OxA-2103, 1292-810 B.C. [Hammond et al. 199l:Table 3.1]). The spread of the Burial 62 dates is not problematic considering that the burial had been contaminated by the appli­cation of chemical preservatives (Hammond et al. 1991:31-32). However, the fact that this burial was dated twice to correct for an earlier, contaminated

date of ca. 510 ± 80 B.C. (OxA-361, uncalibrated) 
means that the number of radiocarbon dates indi­
cating Swasey and Bladen occupation at the site 
should be reduced by one from the previously listed 
number of 31. Burial 62 is also unusual in that it 
was recovered from a deep cleft in bedrock (Ham­
mond et al. 1991:31) rather than associated with 
any recognizable dwelling. It also lacked grave 
goods of any sort. The three dates taken from Bur­
ial 62 (OxA-1649 and OxA-2103) and Burial 179 
(OxA-446 1) are three of the four oldest from the 
post-1975-1976 excavations. Their contexts (in the 
undisturbed paleosol rather than below sealed 
floors or occupation surfaces), their early dates, 
and the fact that they are unaccompanied by any 
grave goods suggest that these burials may be late 
Archaic in age, rather than representative of the ear­
liest permanent occupations of the site. 

Another early assay is OxA-4454 (Hammond et al. 1995), which dates to 1130-810 B.C. This date was processed from a charcoal sample col­lected from 20-25 cm above bedrock in the previ­ously described paleosol. A second carbon sample collected from 5 cm higher, OxA-4453, yielded a date of 782-412 B.C. A third date, OxA-4542, taken from this same paleosol spans from 940 to 7 50 B .C. As noted, this paleosol represents the pre­existing land surface that covered the site area before the village of Cuello was established and upon which the earliest villagers built their low platforms. It contains ceramic debris in some places, has been cleared away to bedrock in oth­ers, and is described as having been built up over time as opposed to having "occupation material trodden into it" (Hammond et al. 1995:123). This distinction is not overly meaningful, since both processes (building up vs. materials being worked downward) can occur at the same time, particularly in proximity to human settlements. Because these i soils frequently contain charcoal from natural fires, dating them by radiocarbon is notoriously impre­cise. For example, lowland paleosols are known to span the Archaic through Preclassic or even Clas­sic periods (Beach et al. 2006; Pohl et al. 1996). The fact that paleosols at Cuello contain pre-1000 

B.C. carbon is not reliable evidence that pottery and village life were present at this early date. 
In addition to these dates, other assays have been used to substantiate the early postulated age for Swasey and Bladen materials. One is Q-1916, which dates to 1617-747 B.C. This sample was recovered from a fire pit (F51) in Structure 325, belonging to Phase II (Hammond et al. 1991 :Table 3.1). This was the earliest period of formal patio arrangement, and Structure 325 had "four detectable stages of successive internal flooring" (Hammond et al. 1991 :32). Seven total post­1975-1976 dates are from this phase; the other six span from as early as 774-412 B.C. to as late as 514-196 B.C. (see Table 2). Based on its strati­graphic relationship with these six other well­contextualized and tightly clustered dates, Q-1916 should not be considered representative of pre-I 000 
B.C. cultural activities during this phase. A more likely interpretation is that it represents old carbon that became intermixed into a later deposit. The fact that its two-sigma distribution covers almost 900 years is another reason to exclude this assay from consideration. 

Additional assays have only small probabilities for dating to before 1000 B.C. but warrant consid­eration. One is Q-1918, dating to 1266-751 B.C. This sample was collected from Phase IHA, a Bladen phase, and is likely old carbon that wound up in a later deposit. Another, OxA-4455, dates to 1058-794 B.C. and is from charcoal in a chultun filled with Bladen-phase pottery (Hammond et al. 1995: 125). Given its context and close association with Bladen ceramics, this sample, too, almost cer­tainly postdates 1000 B.C. A final date, AA-458, has an enormous error range ( 130 radiocarbon years) and dates to 1114-410 B.C. This sample, which is associated with Swasey Phase IA, is listed as "com kernels from ? occupation level" (Ham­mond et al. 1991:Table 3.1) and presumably was recovered from a fire pit feature. The error range makes it impossible to assess the accuracy of this date, and by itself it is not reliable evidence for pre­1000 B.C. sedentism. 
Excavations at Cuello are widely regarded as among the best-documented in the Maya Low­lands. However, a review of the earliest post­1975-1976 dates finds no clear, unequivocal evidence that pottery can be dated to before 1000 
B.C. The earliest dates upon which earlier 1200 or 1100 B.C. age estimates for Swasey have been based come from later contexts and are strati­graphically out of place, from burials with no grave goods or ceramic associations, or are from carbon in soil. The fact that Cuello's earliest architecture

was built directly over bedrock from which the pre­existing paleosol was cleared indicates how easily old carbon could have accumulated in later con­texts. This scenario has been identified by Ham­mond (2002) as the most probable explanation for the earlier confusion concerning Cuello's 1975-1976 dates; most of those samples were derived from Swasey and Bladen contexts, which would have been directly exposed to freshly dis­turbed soils perhaps containing remnants of pre­ceramic occupations. The most secure early dates associated with ceramics, coming from Burials 176, 177, and 178, date to between approximately 930 and 520 B.C.; Burial 174 is slightly earlier at 1056-768 B.C. While it therefore remains possi­ble that ceramics and architecture appeared before 1000 B.C., the greater chance is that they can be dated to the early 900s B.C. 
Blackman Eddy 
Blackman Eddy, in the Belize River Valley, was investigated by James Garber and colleagues (2004a) from the early 1990s for over 10 years. Structure B-1, near the site center, was damaged by bulldozing in the 1980s, and in 1994 Belize's Department of Archaeology deemed that the build­ing was beyond repair. However, a long construc­tion sequence had been exposed, and an opportunity was presented to excavate what remained of the building in order to document its full history, down to the lowermost Middle Preclassic remains, was recognized (Garber et al. 2004a:26). Although important information for other time periods is pre­sent at the site (Garber et al. 2004b ), this discus­sion focuses on the earliest remains encountered beneath Structure B-1. 
A series of bedrock features including chultuns and an arcing series of postholes representing initial-phase occupation were exposed and docu­mented (Garber et al. 2002). Fifteen assays from these features and the overlying Structure B-1 have been used to construct a temporal framework for cultural developments beginning as early as ca. 1400 B. C. The initial component of this sequence, termed Kanocha, has been integrated into the Cunil sphere (Awe 1992) and is dated by the four earli­est dates (Figure 10). 
Of the four Kanocha-phase assays, only Beta­122281 completely predates 1000 B.C. This sam­ple, dating to 1400-1048 B. C., was collected from a chultun labeled Bedrock Feature (BR-F) 3. Exca­vation plans (Garber et al. 2004a:Figure 3.4) indi­cate that this chultun, though not completely exposed, measured 1.28 min diameter and .5 min depth (Garber et al. 2002). It contained dark midden-like fill, ceramics, lithic debris, and fresh­water shells and was interpreted as a refuse pit whose contents were in secondary context. The remaining three Kanocha-phase dates, Beta­162573, Beta-159142, and Beta-122282, are also from charcoal recovered from features in or on the bedrock surface. The former two were recovered from a two-chambered chultun, BR-F5a and BR­F5b, containing abundant Middle Preclassic debris of all kinds. These dates cluster at 1051-838 B.C. (Beta-162573), 996-816 B.C. (Beta-159142), and 980-804 B.C. (Beta-122282). 
Given the tight temporal distribution of these three dates, they clearly represent a well-defined early occupation at Blackman Eddy that began per­haps as early as 1000 B.C., though probably slightly later. In the absence of supporting dates, they also

significantly increase the likelihood that Beta­122281 is from old, perhaps Archaic carbon that was incorporated into a later deposit and does not date ceramic-bearing contexts. Additional support for an ephemeral Archaic component here comes from a stone tecomate found in the two-chambered chultun (Garber et al. 2002). Identical stone bowls were recovered by the BAAR project from prece­ramic sites across northern Belize (MacNeish and Nelken-Temer 1983). However, none have been reported from other Cunil or Swasey assemblages, making it likely that this bowl was already at the site when bedrock features were made and then filled with debris. 
Cahal Pech 

Cahal Pech is among the largest sites in central 
i Belize and contains an occupation sequence span­ning from at least the early Middle Preclassic into the Terminal Classic (Awe 1992). In the late 1980s, Jaime Awe ( 1992) conducted research seeking evi­dence for the earliest occupations at the site. His findings, together with subsequent efforts (Cheetham 1995; Healy 1999; Healy and Awe, ed. 1995, 1996; Healy et al. 2004 ), offer the most com­plete and best-documented sequence of early devel­opments in central Belize. The following discussion focuses on work on and in front of Structure B-4 
in the central precinct, where excavations have 
yielded a series of early dates (Figure 11 ). 

Units 4 and 5, excavated in the late 1980s and early 1990s, extended from the top of Str. B-4 into the interior of the structure. Unit 5 extended 8.27 m (Awe 1992:125) and recovered data from the very bottom of the construction sequence. Sample Beta-77207, dating to 1307-996 B.C., was col­lected in 1991 from Level 14, beneath Floor 13, and was processed in 1994 to confirm a previously reported early date (Beta-56765, see below [Healy and Awe 1995:201]). Awe describes this context as the earliest in Str. B-4 and notes that "the absence of ballast and cultural remains below the tamped clay/marl surface of Floor 13 suggest[s] that the original ground surface of the site was scraped and leveled prior to the construction of the first build­ing" (1992:133). Healy and Awe describe the sam­ple as from "a context just above site bedrock" (1995:201). Healy et al. (2004:Table 7.1) associ­ate this date with the fill of Str. B-4 sub-12, a .84­m-high platform that grades into naturally sloping terrain. However, the description of the context as lacking any cultural remains (Awe 1992:133) and the sample's position immediately over bedrock leave open the question of whether it predates sedentary occupation of the site, is a fragment of old carbon that was redeposited into the ceramic-

free fill for Str. B-4 sub-12, or truly represents burned material that originated with the first con­struction event recognized so far at the site. 
Beta-56765, from Awe's (1992) early excava­tions, also provides evidence for early remains. This sample was collected from Level 12, below Floor 11 (Healy and Awe 1995:201), and belongs to Str. B-4\3rd. Dating from 1306 to 516 B.C., it has a very large range of error. Awe (1992:134) describes this context as a low tamped marl plat­form that may have a series of small pole-and­thatch apsidal structures. Several pole-impressed clay briquettes recovered from Floor 11 indicate the nature of these wattle-and-daub constructions. The stratigraphic context of this date is secure, and it is clearly associated with early village construction and pottery. The long sigma of Beta-56765 makes it impossible to assess, and as with Q-1916 andAA­458 at Cuello (see above), it perhaps should be altogether discounted. 

The chronological position of Str. B-4\3rd can be understood in relation to the two succeeding phases, Str. B-4\4th and Str. B-4\5th. The first includes a series of floors (Floor 10 A, B, and C), each belonging to a new, low platform (Awe 1992: 134-135). Floor 10 C, the earliest, supported a low wattle-and-daub structure that was destroyed by fire. Beta-40865, 1056-792 B.C., comes from the charred support beam for this early hut (Awe 1992: 135). Immediately afterward, this platform was elaborated as Str. B-4\5th, dated by Beta-40864 to 1002-797 B.C. That these two dates are nearly identical indicates the rapid growth of this build­ing and together with Beta-77207 helps to contex­tualize Str. B-4\3rd. Sometime during or after 1307-996 B.C. (Beta-77207), B-4 sub-12, the ear­liest version of Str. B-4, was built. Str. B-4\3rd remains imprecisely dated, but during the interval of approximately 1056-792 B.C., two succeeding phases, Str. B-4\4th and B-4\5th, were built and abandoned. The continual nature of occupation at Str. B-4 is indicated by Beta-40863 (792-402 B.C.), which dates Str. B-4\7th. The other, less likely pos­sibility is that B-4\3rd significantly predates 1000 
B.C. and then was left open and in disuse for a very long time before being serially reoccupied by later inhabitants. 
Two additional dates from Plaza B immediately in front of Str. B-4 also predate 1000 B.C. and pro­vide information about early constructions. In 1994, David Cheetham (1995) excavated a 5-x-5-m unit (PU 94-1) against the base of Str. B-4 extending north out into Plaza B and down to bedrock. Cheetham recorded a series of at least 12 floors, below which was a soil described as "dark, dense, organic, and 'greasy' in both texture and appear­ance" (1995:27). This lowest deposit was com­pletely devoid of ceramics but contained abundant chert debitage. Two carbon samples from PU 94­1 give an indication of the construction chronol­ogy in front of Str. B-4. Beta-77205 was collected from Level 10, directly below Floor 9. This level, presumably of subfloor fill, contained a number of Cunil ceramics and dates to 1088-832 B.C. Beta­77204 was collected from the ceramic-free pale­osol above bedrock and dates to 1214-537 B.C. 
The Structure B-4 and Plaza B sequences con­tain a number of sealed Cunil contexts that have been dated by radiocarbon. In terms of stratigra­phy, the earliest villagers cleared away existing soil before constructing their low platforms and houses on fill placed directly over bedrock; elsewhere, they left the soil in place. This practice was documented at Cuello and may also have been carried out at Blackman Eddy. Next, a series oflow platforms was built, each supporting one or more wattle-and-daub huts, with each phase characterized by burning and rapid remodeling. The adjacent Plaza B was built up more slowly, with less frequent modifications and additions. 
Based on current data, it is possible that ceram­ics here predate those at Cuello, though perhaps only by a small margin. According to original descriptions, neither of the two earliest dates, Beta­77207 and Beta-77204, were found with ceramics, and the enormous error range of the next earliest date, Beta-56765, leaves it only marginally useful. As a result, the stratigraphic position of Cunil ceramics and early architecture is best assessed by looking at the overall sequence. It remains possi­ble that pottery appeared here before approximately 1000 B.C., though given the probability distribu­tions of Beta-40865, Beta-40864, and Beta-77205, it is equally probable that ceramics appeared in the 900s B.C. Carbon dates and lithic artifacts in the paleosol beneath Str. B-4 and Plaza B suggest that an ephemeral Archaic site was located here prior to sedentary occupation, as originally suggested by Cheetham (1995:27; also Clark and Cheetham 2002:309).

Colh<i 
Perhaps the most important site in terms of under­standing the transition from the Archaic to the Pre­classic in the Maya Lowlands is Colha. This site and the surrounding NBCBZ are best known for industrial-scale lithic workshops that characterize the Preclassic and Classic periods (Hester and Shafer 1984, 1994; Shafer and Hester 1983). Exca­vations in the Colha center documented early vil­lage development beginning in the Middle Preclassic, similar in many respects to Cuello (Anthony and Black 1994; Potter et al. 1984; Sul­livan 1991). From the early 1980s through the 1990s, survey and excavation also targeted prece­ramic deposits (Hester et al. 1980; Hester et al. 1981; Hesteretal. 1996; Iceland 1997; Kelly 1993; Lohse 1993; Shafer et al. 1980; Wood 1990). 
A total of 32 radiocarbon dates from Colha date Archaic and Preclassic components. Of these, nine are from Archaic deposits at Operation 4046, approximately 1 km southeast of the site center (Iceland 1997; Lohse 1993), and 23 are from the central plaza. Twelve of these are primarily asso­ciated with pottery of the Bolay complex, and 11 are associated with the succeeding Onceimo com­plex. Bolay is the earliest ceramic complex at Colha (Valdez 1987) and is best compared stylistically with other complexes of the Swasey sphere, though it does not appear to be as old as Swasey at Cuello (Potter et al. 1984:630). The Operation 4046 exca­vations and stratigraphy have been described else­where (Iceland 1997, 2005; Lohse 1993), while excavations in the site center are described by Anthony and Black (1994), Potter et al. (1984), and Sullivan (1991). 
Operation 4046's strata are divided into four zones, A through D. The top two extend as much as 80 cm below the surface and contain evidence of noncontinuous occupation from the Middle Pre­classic to the Terminal Classic (Iceland 1997:27). Zones C and D contain no pottery but have abun­dant lithics of various forms. Zone C is approxi­mately 20 cm thick and occurs at different elevations across Operation 4046; this zone con­tains large numbers of stone tools, including diag­nostic constricted adzes. Zone D extends another 50 cm and contains quarry material and macrob­lades (Iceland 1997). 

Based on available dates and differences in their artifact assemblages, Iceland ( 1997) estimates that Zone C spans approximately 1500-900 B.C. and that Zone D, which is poorly dated by comparison, lasted from around 3400 to 1900 B.C. Operation 4046 represents an open, slowly aggrading, clay­rich environment, meaning that organic preserva­tion is not as good as at other sites. Accordingly, dating was accomplished by a combination of radiocarbon and soil humates taken from bulk sed­iment samples. At lower elevations, humate dating was the only available option for assessing absolute ages. One drawback of this technique is that the organic fraction from sediment samples does not

always represent distinct cultural activities. Rather, age estimates merely give an idea of when carbon was deposited; no determination is possible con­cerning the cultural or noncultural origin of that car­bon. Additionally, humate dates require moderately sized samples. Accordingly, the resultant age esti­mate is a reflection of the span of sediments from which samples are taken. 
A radiocarbon sample, Tx-81 06, taken from the top of C provides a date of 1530-976 B.C., and another, Tx-7371, taken from the interface between ZonesB andC, dates from 1413-971 B.C.Another date, Tx-8295, was taken from a bulk humate sam­ple located in Zone C, 58-75 cm beneath the sur­face. This pooled sample dates to 850-758 B.C., but given the fact that it spans 17 cm of deposit (vir­tually the entire estimated thickness of Zone C), it should not be considered representative of the end of the site's preceramic occupation. Precisely dat­ing the end of the preceramic here is further com­plicated by the large sigma (169 years) for sample Tx-8 106. Nevertheless, no radiocarbon or other evidence suggests that Iceland's (1997) conclusion that the preceramic here lasted until approximately 900 B.C. is incorrect. 
Dating for Zone D, which Iceland (1997) sug­gests corresponds with an earlier cultural period in the regional Archaic chronology, is more prob­lematic. This zone is dated by only two assays, both of which are from soil humates. When cali­brated, one, Tx-7460, spans over 2,000 years of time, making it impossible to accurately assess the true age of the sediments that this date represents. The other, Tx-8020, has a tight probability distri­bution but was collected from a vertical span of 25 cm. Based on these two assays, Iceland (1997) offers that Zone D dates from approximately 3000-1900 B.C., but on the basis of this review, it is clear that much additional dating work is needed before this period of the Archaic can be fully under­stood. 
Dates from the site center are from Bolay (equiv­alent to Bladen) and Oncecimo ceramic phases (Valdez 1987) and were collected from contexts representing the gradual growth of domestic build­ings and features in this part of the site. None of the radiocarbon dates available from this part of the site, including 12 that are primarily associated with Bolay pottery (see Table 2), predates l OOO B.C. The earliest, Tx-4060 and -4151 (combined sample), dates to 931-786 B.C. When the sequence of Pre­classic dates is arranged in chronological order with the preceramic ones, and the questionable Tx-8295 is omitted from consideration, a slight gap in the age distributions appears just before 1000 B.C. (Figure 14). Sample CAMS-8397, dating to 1056-810 B.C. (92.8 percent), marks the approx­imate end of the preceramic sequence, while Tx­4060 and Tx-4151 (931-786 B.C.) indicate the beginning of ceramics at the site. 
Unlike the case at other sites, no information has been recovered from the Colha site center to sug­gestArchaic occupations in this area. It is not clear that excavations ever encountered the buried pale­osol that forms the deposit at Operation 4046 or is similar to what was cleared away at other sites when the first low platforms and house floors were built. Early Middle Preclassic remains including a low platform with burinated cores and evidence for stone working were recorded immediately above preceramic deposits at Operation 4046. Based on the proximity of these finds, Iceland describes the chronological relationship between preceramic and early Middle Preclassic components at the site as "distinct but close" (2005: 17). As at other sites dis­cussed here, additional excavations and dating would add considerably to the understanding of this important transition. 
What We Know and Can Surmise 
About the Transition 


The data available for addressing Lowland Maya cultural continuity from the Archaic to Preclassic periods are not yet robust. Nevertheless, by sys­tematically considering multiple lines of evidence for important cultural practices, a strong case emerges for cultural continuity from the preceramic to the early Middle Preclassic. Earlier, similar argu­ments are not contradicted here but, rather, revised. Based on his work at Cahal Pech, Awe (1992) hypothesized that Archaic peoples played an impor­tant role in the subsequent rise of social complex­ity. At Colha, Iceland (1 997, 2005) observed important technological traits in the late Archaic that also define the Preclassic and Classic Colha Lithic Tradition. Clark and Cheetham (2002) argued for Archaic predecessors to Cunil and Swasey populations in central and northern Belize. However, the Colha Lithic Tradition appears more

widespread than only the NBCBZ. In fact, schol­ars might reasonably expect to find pronounced, intensive, and perhaps even specialized Archaic toolmaking wherever sufficient quantities of suit­able raw material were present with resources that allowed groups to survive on a seasonal basis. Such resources would include water and access to abun­dant, diverse flora and fauna. The proposition by Clark and Cheetham (2002) that central and north­ern Belize were occupied by two distinct popula­tions of proto-Maya, similarly, is undermined by available evidence. The central Belize Archaic component of that model was not based on actual data when it was published, and new finds continue to indicate just how widespread preceramic occu­pations were across a diversity of habitats. 
No evidence currently indicates that the Archaic Maya were linked with or integrated into wider Mesoamerican networks. Even if they were, as future data may show, trade and exchange of exotics do not appear to have played an important role in shaping broad adaptive strategies or deeply rooted cultural practices. However, when it does appear, long-distance trade poses one of the most dramatic contrasts between preceramic and early Middle Pre­classic deposits. Settlement patterns also appear to have shifted at this time from a generalized distri­bution of temporary camps located in a variety of habitats to permanent locales located close to water­ways (the Belize River in central Belize and the New River in northern Belize). Considering that forager-horticulturalists had previously maintained access to a wide range of subsistence resources through residential mobility, perhaps the greatest advantage gained by locating permanent settlements near navigable waterways was access to trade. 
The timing of the transition continues to vex research into Maya origins. In this review of 69

radiocarbon dates from five sites with deposits from the early Middle Preclassic, the Archaic, or both, three important points are illustrated. First, no site yet contains any clear, irrefutable indication of pot­tery before 1000 B.C. Some pre-1000 B.C. assays at Cuello are from burials that are not associated with ceramics and which consistently do not come from beneath house or patio floors. Others are from buried soils, which are notoriously difficult to date. Many early dates are stratigraphically out of order and may represent old carbon that was reworked into later deposits (Andrews and Hammond 1990). At Blackman Eddy, only one assay extends com­pletely beyond 1000 B.C. The other three Kanocha­phase dates are at least a couple of centuries younger, making it most probable that early pot­tery here appeared in the 900s B.C. Cahal Pech cur­rently offers the best case for pre-I 000 B.C. pottery in the Maya Lowlands, though the original descrip­tions of key contexts describe them as either ace­ramic paleosols or artifact-free zones directly over bedrock. The longevity of construction at Str. B-4 provides compelling evidence that ceramics indeed appeared here before I 000 B.C., yet it is my view that the earliest version of this building remains imprecisely dated. Regardless of the date for early pottery, the presence of lithics in the underlying paleosol is significant, as it suggests the presence of an Archaic deposit that immediately predates the earliest constructions. 
A second important point concerns the nature of Archaic sites and why these have proved so dif­ficult to locate. With the exception of Actun Halal, all dated Archaic finds come from open deposits. Once populations became sedentary, these soils were frequently cleared away from bedrock for the construction of houses and platforms. In cases like Cuello, some deposits appear to have been left in place in "yard" areas; the same might also be true at Cahal Pech based on Cheetham's ( 1995) descrip­tion of the dark earth beneath Plaza B. Where soils were removed, carbon that was deposited either naturally or through preceramic human agency appears to have been reworked into later cultural contexts; this explains the earliest date from Black­man Eddy and also most of the seemingly aberrant 1975-1976 dates from Cuello (Hammond 2002). The redeposition of carbon not only highlights con­tinuity of occupation between some ceramic and preceramic sites; it also raises the point that village and preceramic sites are different in nature and that the process of founding new village sites is likely to have erased a lot of Archaic evidence from the landscape. 

Finally, pottery and sedentism most likely did not appear at the same time at all sites. Current evi­dence indicates that ceramics were present at Cahal Pech faintly earlier than those documented in north­ern Belize. The precise difference in dates is diffi­cult to determine when dealing with two-sigma ranges, but Cunil pottery at Cahal Pech and per­haps Blackman Eddy could reasonably be between 25 and 100 years older than Swasey at Cuello or perhaps Bolay/Bladen at Colha. The issue seems to come down to a very few critical dates: Burial 174 at Cuello (OxA-5037, 1056-768 B.C.), Str. B-4\4th (Beta-40865, 1056-792 B.C.) and Level 10 of Plaza B (Beta-77205, 1088-832 B.C.) at Cahal Pech, and BR-F5b (Beta-162573, 1051-838 B.C.) at Blackman Eddy. While these assays all overlap at two sigmas, the burials that are stratigraphically associated with 174 at Cuello (Burials 176, 177, and 178) all span from approximately 900 to 500 B.C., while two stratigraphically associated Cunil assays at Blackman Eddy (from "bedrock" and BF­5a) date to approximately 980-800 B.C. This clus­ter, together with stratigraphic evidence for constructions prior to Str. B4\4th at Cahal Pech, appears to place Cunil slightly before the earliest northern Belize complexes, yet still probably after 1000 B.C. Based on the small sample of available dates, however, this issue is far from resolved. Inter­estingly, Colha was still occupied by preceramic peoples at 1000 B.C., and the earliest ceramics and sedentary village at K' axob did not appear until ca. 800 B .C. (Bartlett et al. 2000; McAnany and Lopez 1999). Explaining the apparent lag between these sites requires further research, but current strati­graphic and radiocarbon evidence indicate that some villages had been established for one to four, and perhaps more, generations by the time others appeared. This brief period would have been incred­ibly dynamic, bearing witness to many of the trans­formations that defined later Maya society. 
Future Directions 
Clearly, the last couple of centuries before the first millennium B.C. were important times of change across Mesoamerica. New influences entered into the Maya Lowlands, and judging by stratigraphic

and chronological details, these influences were not evenly experienced by everyone at the same time. Rather, they took effect over a very short period that represents the transition from Archaic to settled, village life. Given the possibility that the Belize and New rivers provided conduits for the introduction of ideas and exotic goods, future researchers might seek evidence for comparable developments in the Western Lowlands, particu­larly along waterways such as the Usumacinta and its tributaries. Equally probable is that Archaic pop­ulations were firmly enough entrenched elsewhere in the Lowlands, perhaps including northern Yucatan and even central Peten, that they resisted assimilating new styles or technologies for some time. In any event, more than anything the transi­tion from Archaic to Preclassic appears to have rep­resented a dramatic shift in consumer behavior, with a broad inventory of exotics available for the first time. Considering that some early communi­ties acquired access to these exotics before others, scholars should consider a scenario in which social ranking and lineal control over fixed territories developed over only a couple of generations. 
Given the low volume of available data and the enormous expanse of the Lowlands, it seems pre­mature to theorize this transition in a synthetic way. Nevertheless, Demarest's ( 1989) lattice model, pro­posed to explain the coevolution of Formative chief­doms, comes close to providing an appropriate framework for evaluating the kinds of interactions that were taking place between regions in early Mesoamerican history. The lattice model, which bears many important similarities to Renfrew's (1986) peer-polity interaction model, accommo­dates multidirectional influences without imposing unnecessary baggage about predominating cultural influences, colonization, or political domination and subordination. Lack of fit comes from the fact that it describes exchanges and interactions between polities, a term that poorly describes what­ever sociopolitical entities may have occupied the Maya Lowlands in the Archaic period, in ways that impel sociopolitical development. Precise mecha­nisms of influence were also not identified when the lattice model was proposed to understand the possible role(s) of the Olmec in the rise of "civi­lization" in eastern Mesoamerica (Demarest 1989). Rather, Demarest merely noted that "the current level of evidence is insufficient to test this struc­ture" (1989:336). Renfrew ( 1986)summarizes pos­sible kinds of influence that one could expect into five broad categories: overt warfare between poli­ties; competitive emulation between elites in rival polities; symbolic entrainment, in which complex iconographic systems developed in one region are adopted elsewhere; transmission of innovation, including technological developments or altogether new technologies; and increased exchange. Although general, these identify possible direc­tions for future analyses into late Archaic or early Formative interaction between the Lowlands and , nearby zones. 
Although promising, applying a lattice-type framework to the Lowland Archaic is problematic because it is not known what, if anything, "left" the Maya area. One possible example includes impor­tant iconographic elements identified by Garber and Awe (2009) on Cunil pottery and related assem­blages. These elements include cross motifs, nat­ural images relating to birds and crocodiles, "flame brow" symbolism, and the Cave Monster maw, and Garber and Awe (2009: 151) propose these as uniquely "Low land Maya." Clearly these motifs are not unique to the Maya Lowlands, yet the asser­tion of these researchers is that they appear as early here as elsewhere. Whether they predate similar ele­ments and motifs found elsewhere depends on the accuracy of carbon-dated sequences at those sites. If it could be proved that these motifs indeed appeared early in the Lowlands and spread else­where, this would be a prime example of symbolic entrainment, as described by Renfrew (1986:8-10). Another possible example includes laminar blade technology, which was clearly present in the Low­land Archaic, particularly around the Colha area. Considering, though, that blades were also present at San Lorenzo Tenochtitlan by ca. 1150 B.C. (Cobean et al. 1971) and are found in Archaic deposits across Mesoamerica (e.g., MacNeish et al. 1967; Neiderberger 1979; Wilkerson 1975), it is unlikely that this technique emanated exclusively from the Lowlands. Rather, the development of specifically prismatic technology, as opposed to percussion blade making, seems to have occurred well after contact was established among most sub­regions of Mesoamerica (Clark 1987). 
Clearly, more data are needed before archaeol­ogists can theorize the appearance of sedentism and ranking in the Maya Lowlands at the end of

the Archaic. Still, any viable model will need to take into consideration preexisting preceramic popula­tions and cultural traditions, at least in the Eastern Lowlands extending west to the central Peten, where Archaic populations are now known to have existed. Additionally, based on current evidence one can expect this transition to have been marked by changes in consumerism, as new technologies and materials became available, as well as by choices for locating settlements. 
Conclusions 
As one reviewer of this article observed, there are 
different Maya origin questions that must be kept 
separate. Although true, defining "Maya" as "civ­
ilization," whatever that term means, and thus only 
discemable past a particular threshold of social or 

political development precludes any true under­
standing of the specific historical trajectories under­
gone by "Maya" (social, linguistic, ethnic, etc.) 
groups. Traditional scholarship has favored the 
view that the Maya Lowlands were vacant terrain 
prior to sedentism and that the archaeological Maya 

were the result of combined influences and even 
population movements from external regions. Only 
lately has mounting evidence from preceramic 

occupations begun to seriously challenge this per­
spective. However, the processes by which the ear­

liest permanent villages were built eradicated much 
of the evidence for what cultural continuity may 
have defined the Archaic-to-Preclassic transition, 
making this brief period difficult to recognize. This 

situation only compounds the challenges to under­
standing Maya origins that arise through threshold 

or stage-based approaches. 
In addition to emerging archaeological data, some of the best information supporting an Archaic Maya origin actually comes from the Maya them­; selves. For instance, the historical linguistic work · previously discussed dates the breakup of the proto­Mayan language family at ca. 2200 B.C. and sug­gests that splinter groups entered the Lowlands soon afterward. While more precise dates and direc­tions of movement for these events are needed, the premise that contemporary Mayan languages stem from Archaic ancestral tongues remains commonly accepted. Similarly, origin narratives read from Classic period inscriptions recount the Maya prac­tice of fixing the beginning date of their Long Count 
cycle to a day in 3114 B.C. (Schele and Freidel 1990:81 -82), an event often described by archae­ologists as "mythological" (Hammond 1991:3) or "mythohistorical" (Rice 2004:67). It is unlikely that the Archaic Maya had the ability to track time to this degree of precision, yet this date is highly congruent with the beginnings of food production in the Lowlands (Pohl et al. 1996). It is not unrea­sonable that Archaic events were recorded first through oral and then through written traditions that persisted until the Spanish arrival (e.g., Ted­lock 1985) and that at some point a specific date was retroactively affixed to this early period (see Sharer and Traxler 2006: 114) as a way of anchor­ing the cultural sequence in a known, or recalled, era that was highly significant in terms of cultural origins. Oral tradition has long been identified as a key element in Maya systems of communication (Tozzer 1941; see Houston and Stuart 1992) and would have been very important to preliterate soci­eties for conveying information across large areas. Ideally, Archaic events including population move­ments, language diversification, and how the begin­ning of world time was conceptualized will one day be evaluated with archaeological data. Until then, they should not be ruled out as possible sources of information for extending know ledge of the Maya into deep time or declared a priori as "mythologi­cal" and irrelevant to scientific inquiry (cf. White­ley 2002). 
The precolumbian Maya have long been per­ceived by researchers as one of the most complex and sophisticated New World civilizations. Yet, after decades of focused study, archaeologists are still unsure about their origins. Considering the breadth of knowledge for other time periods, the preceramic can easily be identified as one topic of study about which scarcely anything is known. This problem has as much to do with the slowly grow­ing record of ephemeral deposits as with frame­works used by archaeologists to make sense of their data. However, emerging evidence, together with information that has been on hand for decades, increasingly indicates that important aspects of "Maya" culture were present across at least parts of the Lowlands well before ca. 1000 B.C. Future research might profitably focus on these early time periods, considering all available lines of evidence, as scholars work to better understand the Archaic origins of the Lowland Maya.

Notes 
1. Long-term research into Belize's Archaic record by Richard MacNeish and his colleagues also addressed the tran­sition from hunting and gathering to settled village life but for reasons discussed elsewhere (Kelly 1993; Lohse et al. 2006:212) failed to adequately resolve this issue. 
2. Dr. Greg McDonald of the National Park Service kindly analyzed all of the Actun Halal fauna! remains with the exception of the artiodactyl, which was identified by Dr. Kitty Emery, Elyse Anderson, and Ero! Kavountzis of the Florida Museum of Natural History, at the University of Florida, Gainesville.
