CHANGING PATTERNS OF RI TUAL ACTIVITY IN AN UNLOOTED 
CAVE IN CENTRAL GUATEMALA 
Brent K.S. Woodfill, Stanley Guenter, and Mirza Monterroso 
The Cave of Hun Na/ Ye. located in central Guatemala, was discovered unlooted by a local landowner in 2005 and was immediately subject to investigation by the authors. The cave contained ritual remains dating to between the Terminal Pre­classic and Terminal Classic. In addition to allowing a detailed reconstruction of ritual activity in the northern highlands, its presence along the Great Western Trade Route allows archaeologists to examine hypotheses about interregional trade during the Classic period. In particular. changes in the ritual assemblage between the Early and Late Classic indicate that the cave was an important trade shrine for merchants and travelers passing between the highlands and lowlands until ca. 
A.D. 550, at which point it became a local shrine used to reinforce elite power. These changes are then linked to larger pat­terns occurring in other parts of the trade route, especially to Tikal and the kingdoms along the Pasion and Usumacinta rivers.

d. C., el material consiste de vasijas quebradas de un estilo local y estd concentrado en la entrada de la cueva, donde es posi­ble hacer una ceremonia publica enfrente de una audiencia. En base a esta evidencia ya material recuperado en otras cuevas vecinas, los autores sugieren que mercaderes llevaron material en bruto de las Tierras Altas hasta el Peten central, parando en la cueva para hacer ceremonias pidiendo permiso de paso de los duenos sobrenaturales de la region. Al principio de! Cldsico Tardio, en contraste, Cancuen fue establecido para controlar el movimiento de estos bienes, importando el material en bruto parafabricar productos de exportacion para las Tierras Bajas. Los cambios del patron de uso de la rutafueron represanta­dos en el nuevo patron de ritual, que se llev6 a cabo por elites locales para forralecer su poder polftico a traves de actos rit­uales publicos en la entrada de la cueva.

It contained 30 whole vessels and a stone coffer with a series of carved glyphs and figures on the lid and each of the four sides which, when opened, was found to contain a tapir femur covered in calcium carbonate. The vessels date from the Terminal Pre­classic to the Terminal Classic (ca. A.D. 150-900) and were largely exotics in the style of regions as far away as the Motagua Valley and Kaminaljuyu.

A Description of the Cave 

The Cave of Hun Na! Ye (Figures 2 and 3) actually consists of two adjacent caves. They are located at the source of a small tributary to the Pasion River, above a small, deep pool (over 40 m) that feeds into an 8 m waterfall. Cave I is a long, restricted cave with the majority of artifacts, while Cave II (The Vault) is a single chamber located directly above it. Both are quite small (covering a total horizon­tal area of 15 m x 22 m), although the arduous and undulating path that one takes to get through Cave I makes it appear deceptively large. 
Cave I 
The entrance to Cave I is located behind a small ledge located approximately 7 m above the dry sea­son water level. A lens of smashed pots and dust covers most of the ledge floor; upon excavation, two whole, small, unslipped, and roughly-made cups (HNYV-28 and 29; Figure 4a) were discov­ered, one placed upside-down and the other right­side up on the bedrock. Several other cups of much better quality-both whole and partial-were found immediately inside the entrance (HNYV-23 to 26, Figure 4b). Both the vessels and a large accumulation of ceramics in a small pit adjacent to them were covered by a thick layer of white cal­cium carbonate.

Beyond the entrance lies an undulating tunnel consisting of a series of vertical climbs with ample natural hand-and foot-holds. While these tunnels were mostly dry during the course of investigation, the water level of the pool was particularly high dur­ing the first visit to the cave (about 5 m above the dry season water level); the rise in the pool's water level created a waterfall inside the cave at the ini­tial descent, slowly flooding the tunnel system. 
In order to reach Chamber I, the principal focus of Precolumbian ritual activity in the cave, one must climb up the cave wall to reach a tight crawl­space which appears to have been made by the ancient Maya by removing pieces of breakdown (remnants of a collapsed ceiling). The chamber itself begins to open up nearly immediately­although the ceiling remains level, the floor is a series of travertine pools and dams that end abruptly with a meter drop to rough, uneven bedrock. Sev­eral large formations naturally channel traffic through a single, narrow path. 
The ancient Maya left three whole pots on this path, all within the travertine pools (HNYV-1 to 3, Figure 5). The majority of the Hun Nal Ye vessels

were found on the back wall of Chamber I (Figure 6)-the stone coffer and an orange-slipped ceramic lidded box (HNYV-10) were placed in a single niche located about 1.5 m above the floor, and five whole vessels, including another ceramic box, were stacked on the floor below it. An area covered by ceramics and damp organic residue was found next 
to this pile. At the bottom, Monterroso and Wood­
fill discovered two whole vessels (HNYV-17 and HNYV-18), one placed atop the other; the bottom vessel (Figure 7a) contained part of a juvenile human pelvis. A variety of small jars and cups were placed in niches and on sloping walls near the back part of Chamber I. 
Chamber II is accessed by a natural doorway near the stone coffer. It, like its predecessor, con­tinues to slope downward while the ceiling remains at a stable height, although here the slope is largely composed of breakdown left behind when the ceil­ing collapsed in the distant past. There is one large, active formation on the up-slope part of the cham­ber and several whole vessels (Figure 7 c) in niches near the entrance to Chamber I. This part of the cave has a small window to the outside, although it is too small for a human to pass through. A space in the breakdown below the window contains a nearly complete tapir skeleton that was cemented to the cave floor by a thick layer of calcium car­bonate. The skeleton appears to have been articu­lated in the past, but it is slightly disturbed, likely due to water action. 
The northernmost part of the cave is Chamber III, a low crawlspace accessible by climbing down the Chamber II slope. Two vessels (a bowl and a cup) were found placed upside-down on the floor. 
Cave II 
Cave II (The Vault) is much simpler to describe­it is a simple chamber with no dark space, a steeply sloping floor, and an inverted V-shaped ceiling highly reminiscent of a corbelled vault. A few scat­tered ceramic sherds have been identified on the floor, as well as one nearly-complete vessel (HNYV-30, Figure 7d), a Late Classic bowl with large chunk of its base missing. 
The Artifacts: Description and Patterns 

The majority of the artifactual assemblage from Hun Nal Ye (Woodfill and Monterroso 2005; Wood-fill 2007, 20 I 0) is ceramic, although a single obsid­ian prismatic blade, part of a juvenile human pelvis, a tapir skeleton, and the stone coffer (see below) are also present. Each of the artifacts will be briefly described before an explication of the general trends found in the material data. 
The Stone Co.ff er 
The stone coffer (Figures 8-12) was made of a dark volcanic stone and consists of two parts -a body with four nubbin supports and a lid. It is 38 cm long, 
21.7 cm wide, and 10.9 cm tall, including the 2.8 cm-thick lid. The supports are 1.6 cm tall. The lid and the four sides of the body were carved by at least three different hands. The carving style, both in the iconography and the hieroglyphs, dates to the late phase of the Early Classic period, approx­imately the late-fifth or sixth centuries. 
The lid (Figure 8) depicts the moon goddess, who closely resembles the maize god but is here distinguished by her animal companion, a rabbit tucked into the crook of her arm, as well as a Tl 8 lff683b moon sign to the right of this pair.

"carved thing" in Glyph 12. Glyphs 7 and 8 may be part of the proper name of the stone box. How­ever, the prefix ta-on Glyph 7 intriguingly may indicate the original contents of the box, for ta is the universal preposition of Classic Mayan, being the equivalent of the English "on/at/in/for." The meaning of the signs in Glyphs 7 and 8, though, is not transparent in this interpretation, as they appear to read haab, chi, and naah, "year," possibly "deer," and "house" respectively. 
Glyphs 9 and 10 are more certainly part of the proper name of the coffer and consist of the names of the Moon Goddess as well as apparently that of her rabbit companion. Most curiously, he is referred to as "10 and 20," or "30," the number of days in a lunar month. Maya lunar months varied between 29 and 30 days long and it may be that this mytholog­ical rabbit, which the Maya saw in the dark patterns on the face of the moon itself, was thought to be the patron of, and perhaps in some way responsible for, the additional day in these lunar months. Undoubt­edly this name reflects some myth now lost to us. 
Glyphs 11 and 12 state that the preceding names of the Moon Goddess and her rabbit were the name of the box itself, and that it belonged to the indi­vidual whose own name follows in the last four glyphs of the text. This person actually had two names, the first of which, in Glyphs 13 and 14, appears to read Yuhklaj Chan Muwaan. While the name is only written as Yuk Chan Muwaan, the -laj ending to yuk, a verb meaning "to shake," can be inferred by analogy with a similar name that appears on a looted Codex-style plate (Robicsek and Hales 1981 :204, 2A) as well as the name of the fourteenth king of Copan, K'ahk' Joplaj Chan K'awiil (Martin and Grube 2000:206). 
This name can be translated loosely as "Hawk who Shakes the Sky." The second name is found in Glyphs 15 and 16 and reads K'an K'uuch, or "Yellow Vulture." This pattern of two royal names, where one con­sists of a verbal phrase incorporating a reference to celestial phenomena and the second consists of an animal modified by a color term is a common one in ancient Maya onomastics (Colas 2004).

gle figures, which appear to be humans rather than divinities, both of whom face to the left, toward a group of hieroglyphs. All four sides are bounded by vertical columns, each of which features a cou­ple of hieroglyphs. 
Unfortunately, while at least 44 hieroglyphs were carved upon the four sides of the stone box, these are carved at a much smaller scale than those upon the lid, and the carving is much more crude, especially those hieroglyphs on the short sides. The vast majority of the signs that form these hiero­glyphs bear no resemblance to known and deci­phered signs in Classic Maya writing, with the result that none of these short texts are actually leg­ible. Some individual glyphs, such as those in the middle of Side 3 (Figure 11 ), however, are slightly more recognizable. Glyph C 1, for example, resem­bles the glyph WAY, while glyph C2 is that of a throne, suffixed by the syllable -na, unfortunately still an illegible collocation. Glyph C3 is the most interesting in this part of the text as it is an Emblem Glyph in which an unknown main sign is prefixed by the number 1. 
This Emblem Glyph is otherwise unattested and thus does not aid in elucidating the origins of the stone box, nor where it was carved. 
While the epigraphic information on the sides of the coffer remains opaque, more can be said about the iconography. On each of the long sides of the box the figure seated upon a throne to the left is an elderly deity, dressed in an elaborate cos­tume including a headdress, wearing a possible cape or pectoral, and with a skirt and belt.

estingly, on both Side 1 and Side 3 this figure pos­sibly has jaguar paws for hands. Underneath the outstretched left hand of each of these figures is a rectangular object that matches the way the ancient Maya depicted codices. Unfortunately, the figure on the right of Side 3 is mostly eroded away, but enough remains of his face to see that it is that of the Jaguar God of the Underworld, known to be a patron of nighttime and fire (Stu­art 1998). The equivalent figure on Side 1 (Fig­ure 9) is shown in almost mirror fashion to the elderly deity across from him, except that he does not have a codex or other object beneath his out­stretched hand. Interestingly, on Side 1 the figure to the left bears the cruller above a Roman nose and scalloped "beard" that identify this character 
as the Fire God. It is unclear exactly what the scene represents, as the hieroglyphs between the two figures that may have explained their inter­action cannot be read. On both Sides 1 and 3 the figure to the left may be reading from the codex, or handing it to the figure on the right. 
The figures on the short ends of the box, as noted above, appear to be human. Each has his hair tied up in a topknot, but otherwise there is no headdress on either of them, and their costume is spare in com­parison to that of the deities on the other sides of the box. Each is seated cross-legged on a small pad, definitely not a throne, and faces left. The fig­ure on Side 2 (Figure 10) has on his or her lap an open codex, while no object is found with the fig­ure on Side 4 (Figure 12). However, this latter indi-

vidual is facing the longest hieroglyphic text on the body of the box, consisting of 11 illegible glyphs. Interestingly, the head variant glyphs in this text all face the human individual, indicating that this text was meant to be "read" unusually from right to left. The same reading order is apparent for the interior text of six glyphs facing the human figure on Side 
2. The fact that this human figure has a codex, while his counterpart on Side 4 does not, mirrors the scenes on the long sides of the box and suggests a crucial symbolism that connects all of these scenes, and reminds one of Vase K 1196, which shows the old deity, God N, apparently teaching a pair of youths from a codex. Federico Fahsen (Woodfill et al. 2006) has suggested that the box originally held a codex, and this may well have been the case. While the epigraphic information cannot be mus­tered to support this contention, the iconography can be, and it is notable that the size of the cavity within the box is consistent with the sizes of the four surviving Maya codices. No evidence of any such codex has been found in the coffer, or any­where in the cave, however, and the only material found associated with it is discussed below. 
In summary, the hieroglyphic text on the lid of this stone coffer, stylistically dating to the late-fifth or sixth centuries, identifies it as in some way being connected or dedicated to the Moon Goddess and her rabbit companion, and informs us that the orig­inal owner was a Maya lord who bore the two names Yuhklaj Chan Muwaan and K'an K'uuch. Unfortunately, he is not identified by an Emblem Glyph and we cannot even be certain that he was a king, although no sub-lord, especially in this period, is known to have been the recipient of such an elaborate and precious carving. The hieroglyphs and iconography on the lid indicate a lowland tra­dition, and it is likely that this object was carved far to the north of Hun Na! Ye cave, or at least was carved by a sculptor from this region. Given that hieroglyphic inscriptions are otherwise all but entirely absent from this region, especially in the Early Classic period, the former possibility seems the more likely. 
The sides of the box are carved in a different style than the lid, but are still within the tradition of the Early Classic lowlands. However, the hiero­glyphs are for the most part pseudoglyphic or are so crudely carved as to be illegible. The iconogra­phy, of gods and scribes exchanging codices, is suggestive as to what the box originally contained. It may well have once held a codex, and the iconog­raphy on the lid suggests that this may have even included lunar calculations, or myths associated with the moon goddess.

all northern highland types found in neighboring assemblages (e.g., Arnauld 1986; Ichon 1992; Smith 1952). There are subtle differences between the material recovered from the entrance and the cave interior, however. The sherds at the entrance tend to be more elaborately decorated, with trichromes, incisions, and appliques, which are largely absent in the interior of the cave. With the exception of two cached vessels at the cave entrance (discussed in the following paragraph), all of the unslipped ceramics were found in the cave interior. This corresponds to general patterns observed in disparate parts of the Maya world (e.g., Brady 1989; Peterson 2006; Rissolo 2003; Woodfill 2007), in which more elaborate vessels are found in places where an audience could observe the ritual practi­tioner using (and often destroying) them. Since there is ample space for a small crowd to gather on the opposite shore of the pool, it is hardly surpris­ing that this pattern exists here too. 
One interesting connection between the two sherd concentrations is that each covered two cached whole vessels. This would appear to mean that the majority or entirety of each assemblage rep­resents a single ritual event, with vessels deposited and then ritually covered through the smashing of pots and, in the case of the Chamber I vessels, the burning of organic materials. The specifics of each assemblage were quite different from each other, however. The entrance feature was on relatively level ground and the vessels were short cups (each under 5 cm tall), so the ceramics formed a shallow lens over much of the floor. In Chamber I, on the other hand, the two pots were placed right-side up

in a natural pit in the bedrock that was approxi­mately 40 cm deep with one atop the other. The ceramic sherds and the organic "sludge" (analysis pending) were thrown into the pit until they cov­ered all but the lip of the top vessel. Since only this matrix was recovered from the top vessel, it is impossible to tell what, if anything, it originally held, but the bottom vessel contained a partial juve­nile human pelvis. 
The Whole Vessels 
The whole vessels found in Hun Na! Ye (Table 2) represent ceramic complexes from most of the Maya highlands and span a wider period of time than the sherds, dating to between the Terminal Preclassic and the Terminal Classic. Due to at-times fuzzy chronological correlations between the dif­ferent regions represented in the sample, it is impos­sible to accurately chart the chronological relations among all of the vessels, so, for the purpose of this paper, they will be divided into two broad groups­the Terminal Preclassic/Early Classic and the Late!Terminal Classic. 
The Terminal Preclassic/Early Classic group likely consists of 18 of the whole vessels, a partial vessel, and the stone coffer. It represents a strong "international" tradition, with vessels associated with complexes from the Salama and Motagua Val­leys, Kaminaljuyu, and, potentially, northwestern El Salvador. The stone coffer also corresponds to this grouping and also represents this internation­alization, albeit as the solitary lowland artifact in the assemblage. 
The Late!Terminal Classic group, however, has exclusively local wares. All are typical northern highland-style vessels (Figure 13; e.g., Arnauld 1986; lchon 1992; Smith 1952). Twelve vessels and the entirety of the material from the sherd con­centrations correspond to this group. In addition to the material in the cave itself, 15 vessels dating to
