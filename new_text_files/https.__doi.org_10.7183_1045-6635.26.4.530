THE POLITICAL LANDSCAPES OF EASTERN SONORA, MEXICO: 
A RECONSIDERATION OF SCALE AND ORGANIZATION 

Matthew C. Pailes 
The indigenous polities of eastern Sonora. Mexico, play an important role in reconstructions of the late prehispanic political 
geography of northwest Mexico and the U.S. Southwest. Most interpretations of political organization in the region rely heavily on Spanish conquest accounts from the 1500s augmented by some archaeological data. Researchers have argued that political units in this region were organizationally complex and controlled substantial territories. Recent investigations in the Moctezuma Valley mostly refute these interpretations. This paper presents evidence of the limited scale of political organization in the region. including settlement patterns. the distribution of public architecture, the movement of rare goods. stylistic differences in material culture, and demographic reconstructions. Previous ethnohistoric research mistakenly assumed that Spanish exploration chronicles provided a near complete list of primate centers. This approach produced interpretations of geographically expansive polities. Present data suggest that the region was highly balkanized into numerous autonomous political units that were minimally involved in macro-regional political and social trajectories. The character of political organization in this region resulted in part from a patchy landscape, low demographic pressure, and geographic location between more centrally organized groups. 
la zona este de Sonora, en Mexico,juega un rol importante dentro de las reconstrucciones a macro-escala sobre la organizaci6n polftica durante el Periodo Prehispdnico en el Noroeste!Suroeste. La mayorfa de las reconstrucciones para este periodo se basan principalmente en interpretaciones sobre los relatos etnohist6ricos de la conquista espafi.ola durante el siglo diecisiis, en conjunto con algunos datos arqueol6gicos. Los investigadores concluyeron que los sistemas de gobierno en esta ref;irin tuvieron una organizaci6n compleja y ejercieron un control politico considerable sobre un abundante territorio. las recientes investigaciones en el Valle de Moctezuma refutan estas interpretaciones. El estudio presentado en este artfculo se enfoca en examinar la escala de organizaci6n polftica, que al parecer es bastante limitada. Varias lfneas de evidencia apoyan esta inter­
pretaci6n, incluyendo el andlisis del patron de asentamiento, la distribuci6n de la arquitectura publica, el movimiento de bienes ex6ticos, las diferencias estilisticas en la cultura material y las reconstrucciones demogrdficas. Las investigaciones etnohist6ricas previas se equivocaron en asumir que los documentos sobre la conquista proporcionaban una lista completa de centros primarios. Este enfoque proporcionaba informaci6n sabre sistemas de gobierno geogrdficamente expansivos. Los datos actuates sugieren que esta regi6n fue bastante balcanizada con numerosas unidades poUticas aut6nomas que se invo­lucraron m(nimamente en las trayectorias sociales y polfticas a macro-escala.

his article delineates demographic, ex­change, and stylistic boundaries as proxies for the likely scale of political integration in the Rfo Sonora region. For the purposes of the ensuing discussion, a political unit is defined as the largest regularly cooperating group. Based on broad ethnographic observations, integration is presumed to include cooperation in functions such as production, distribution, and mutual de­fense and to correspond to a component of self­identity with spatially discernible limits (Feinman and Neitzel 1984; Fish and Fish 2000; Hayden and Villeneuve 2010). 
Previous researchers (Douglas and Quijada 2004; Riley 2005) have argued that categorically different scales of political integration existed in eastern Sonora. Note that eastern Sonora includes all of the Rfo Sonora region and likely some por-

ti on of the Casas Grandes region. Wilcox et al. (2008: 164) argue that testing these competing models is a prerequisite of formulating recon­structions of pan-regional political trajectories in northwest Mexico and the U.S. Southwest-here­after referred to as the Northwest/Southwest (Fig­ure I). Assumptions about the scale of political units lie at the center of virtually every recon­struction of social organization in the region, re­sulting in presently irreconcilable interpretations. The following analysis is designed to conclusively demonstrate that, in fact, the scale of integration in eastern Sonora was geographically small. This interpretation contrasts with most previous mod­els that presumed a substantial geographical breadth to the political units that dominated the late prehispanic period (ca. A.D. 1200-1500).As a result, interpretations regarding how many mid­dlemen were required in trans-regional exchange relationships, the scale at which warfare was con­ducted, the political machinations employed to integrate disparate sections of society, the labor potential of individual political units, and the overall level of social complexity suggested for this region must be reconsidered. 
This article addresses the question of scale through multiple lines of archaeological evidence from the Moctezuma Valley, Sonora, Mexico. These data are indicative of political, social, ide­ological, and economic interaction spheres. Taken together, they clearly demonstrate that small scales of political integration were the norm. 
Settlement pattern and demographic data play a dominant role in my argument. Other forms of evidence, such as coordinated building projects in the form of monumental public architecture or subsistence infrastructure indicative of centralized political control, are generally not observed in the region. Variations in material culture reflective of alternative ideological ascriptions and other social distinctions are clearly discernible, but may not be exactly coterminous with political bound-

aries. Provenience data reflect economic interac­tion spheres but also may not correspond to po­litical affiliations. Where appropriate, this study also employs lines of evidence indicative of social and economic affiliations, which place an upper limit on the likely scale of political integration. A comparison of the scale of interaction suggested by these data to demographic estimates for the region demonstrates incongruities that cannot be matched to most previous models. 
Previous Research 
The interpretation of large-scale political integra­tion was most fully developed by Carroll Riley ( 1979, 1987, 1999, 2005). Four primary ethno­historic accounts-those of Cabeza de Vaca (1536; Adorno and Pautz 1999), Marcos de Niza (1539), Coronado (1540-1542; Hallenbeck 1949), and Ibarra (1565; Obregon 1928)-and a secondary account by Las Casas ( 1951) provide the basis for most interpretations. Riley (1999: 196) refers to the political units of the region as "state lets," a term that denotes a middle-range level of organi­zational complexity. The size and even location of identified statelets are rough estimations, but Riley (1987:72, 2005:164) provides several maps that are the basis for Figure 2. The boundaries are noted as arbitrary, but each statelet is named after a primary village mentioned in ethnohistoric texts. This approach suggests that there should be only one political unit per named area. The essence of Riley's (2005: 152) model is that of large towns, or "energetic polities," surrounded by satellite vil­lages. The scale of the territory included in these political units is not explicitly stated. Most ar­chaeologists understandably interpret the shaded regions of Riley's maps to indicate the rough ex­tent of specific statelets (e.g., Phillips 1989). 
The concept of statelets was developed shortly after Charles DiPeso (1974) put forward his ar­gument that the mostly contemporaneous town of Paquime, in western Chihuahua, was a mer­cantile center controlled by a Mesoamerican group. In this theoretical milieu (see also Foster 1999; Kelley 1992, 1995, 2000), neighboring eastern Sonora was naturally viewed as heavily impacted by Mesoamerican groups, leading to a dependence on Jong-distance exchange and mod­erate organizational complexity. Given the polit­
ical dynamics of the Mesoamerican frontier and 
the less politically complex U.S. Southwest, 
statelets presented a logical intermediary in terms 
of both geography and organizational patterns. 
The statelet model has many ramifications for pan-regional reconstructions. Several of the most notable are that statelets facilitated material trans­fers between Mesoamerica and the U.S. Southwest (Pailes 1980, 1990, 1997), they accepted large immigrant populations from surrounding regions (Wilcox et al. 2008), they were the inheritors of Casas Grandes elites after Paquime collapsed (Lekson 2009), and they were the last bastion and perhaps apogee of political complexity in the broader Northwest/Southwest (Riley 2005). 
Archaeological data confirming or refuting the statelet concept are variable and, overall, scarce. Contemporaries of Riley's ethnohistoric research described settlement patterns that appeared com­mensurate in many regards with his model. Doolittle ( 1984a, 1988) demonstrated the pres­ence of a site-size hierarchy in the Sonora Valley. The two largest sites were described as having nodal positions in the valley and both had features interpreted as public architecture. Doolittle argued that the political power of these sites arose largely through the management of subsistence surplus. This was in contrast to other contemporary mod­els that saw long-distance exchange as the driving force throughout the sequence (Pailes 1978, 1980). Doolittle (1984b) also estimated very high populations ( 100 ,000 people) for the region. Riley (1987, 2005) subsequently utilized these figures to support his arguments for significant organi­zational complexity. Although it was not a focus of research, the scale at which Doolittle confirmed the patterns suggested by Riley and the scale at which they were originally proposed are obvi­ously substantially different (Figure 2). 
Many contemporary Northwest/Southwest ar­chaeologists have strong doubts about Riley's model, but U.S. researchers express curiously little interest in eastern Sonora (Lekson 2009:215), and published criticisms remain lim­ited and based on anecdotal observations (e.g., Doelle 1989; Fontana 1989). McGuire and Vil­lalpando ( 1989) offer a slightly more in-depth critique but mainly focus on details of Doolittle's demographic estimates and chronological refine­ment. Again, they present no original data. More

jada and Douglas 2003). Their data were gener­ated by limited survey and excavation in several reaches of the Bavispe Valley in the 1990s (Dou­glas 1997). The settlement hierarchy was less clear, and public architecture was not associated with the largest sites and was of an equivocal na­ture. Douglas and Quijada took this as evidence that, at least in the Bavispe Valley, political power was contested at a very local level. The research presented in this article builds on the arguments of Douglas and Quijada by extending research to the Moctezuma Valley. Multiple lines of evidence suggest small scales of integration. When pro­jected onto the entire region, these observations present a categorically different model of the po­litical landscape. These findings will require new models of the internal dynamics of the region and a reconsideration of the role of eastern Sonora in pan-regional trajectories. 
The research presented here is also a first ap­proximation of a Sonoran counterpart to programs carried out in the Casas Grandes region in recent decades. As noted, the primate town of this re­gion, Paquime, was previously interpreted as a hegemonic center with political authority that spanned a large portion of the Northwest/South­west from A.D. 1200 to 1450 (DiPeso 1974).1 Utilizing settlement pattern and excavation data from the hinterland, Michael Whalen and Paul Minnis (1999, 2001a, 2001b, 2009) now argue that Paquime exerted direct political control over only a relatively small region. They estimate a radius of 15 km of intensive political control and 30 km of lesser influence. Regular economic re­lationships extended through the near periphery­a radius of ca. 75 km-with prestige goods flow­ing to the hinterland and subsistence resources to the core area (Whalen and Minnis 2001a:190­191, 193). Ideological influence, as indicated by the distribution of ceramic traditions that used a common symbolic repertoire (VanPool and Van­Pool 2007) and, to a lesser extent, public archi­tecture (Whalen and Minnis 1996), had a distrib­ution more in line with DiPeso's original formulation. Their effort demonstrates the utility of investigating multiple lines of evidence to for­mulate a better understanding of political scale. It also provides a template for some of the scalar relationship likely to exist between different spheres of interaction and offers a guide for reevaluating prior arguments that were overzeal­ous in their perception of social complexity. 
Delineating Political Units 
Data Collection 
Recent research in the Moctezuma Valley has produced most of the data presented below. Sys­tematic survey included inspection of all land­forms along the Rio Moctezuma for approxi­mately 30 km (Figure 3). Settlements are undoubtedly present to both the north and the south of the project boundary. Excavations were carried out in a sample of structures and extra­
mural contexts. The results of excavations at the two largest sites, El Noga! (Son L:2: 1) and Teon­adepa (Son L: 1 :23), will be the focus in the fol­lowing discussion. Approximately 8 .3 m3 were excavated at El Noga! and 6.3 m3 at Teonadepa. The vast majority of excavations were placed in domestic contexts, with portions of three struc­tures excavated at both sites. One midden context at both sites was also minimally sampled. The research agenda also included systematic surface collection and detailed mapping of both sites (Supplemental Figures I and 2). Only a limited number of reliable dates were obtained, but in combination with diagnostic artifacts they suggest that both sites were occupied contemporaneously from A.D. 1200 to at least A.D. 1500 (Supple­mental Figure 3). The main occupation of El No­ga! may have started about a century earlier, but this discrepancy in dates is likely a result of the chance sampling of a few younger contexts. Both sites present evidence of use into the contact pe­riod in the form of rare flaked glass debitage. A fuller accounting of methods and excavated con­texts can be found in Pailes (2015). 
Settlement Patterns 
Settlement pattern data are of obvious relevance to discerning political integration. There is a rec­iprocal relationship between how people are dis­tributed on the landscape and how centers of pop­ulation are connected into larger cooperating groups. Given the lack of previous quantitative interpretations regarding Rio Sonora settlement patterns, the most effective approach is via com­parison to globally observed patterns indicative of alternative modes of organization.

con-elation offers a well understood comparative measure (e.g., Berry 1961; Cavanagh 2009; Crumley I 976; Drennan and Peterson 2004; Hod­der I 979; Paynter I 982; Whalen and Minnis 200la). 
The basic premise of the approach is that set­tlement systems will exist on a continuum of in­tegration in both horizontal and vertical dimen­sions. Settlement systems that form a linear an-angement on the logarithmic plot are said to be log-normal, and suggest a system that is orga­nizationally cohesive and interdependent (John­son 1980)-a scenario that strongly suggests a distinct sociopolitical unit. Convex distributions

above the log-normal plot suggest weak hierar­chical organization and likely the inclusion of multiple smaller-scale and largely independent systems or, conversely, a sample that failed to capture the highest echelon of population centers (Drennan and Peterson 2004; Johnson 1980: 11; Peterson and Drennan 2005). Deviations below the line indicate a situation in which one so-called "primate" center overly dominates all interactions and thereby diminishes horizontal integration be­tween centers of lesser size and importance (Hod­der 1979; Johnson 1980; Whalen and Minnis 2001a). Primate relationships are common among middle-range societies. A summary statistic of 
rank-size convexity, known as the A-statistic, was proposed by Johnson (1980:239) and refined by Drennan and Peterson (2004). Values range from a maximum of 1 in cases where all sites are of equal size to zero for systems that match a log­normal distribution, and they approach -1 for in­creasingly primate distributions. 
For comparative purposes, datasets from across the Northwest/Southwest were assembled in Figure 4 and Table 1 (also see Supplemental Table 1, Supplemental Text). The figures and sta­tistics were calculated utilizing rsboot (Drennan 2012). Note the clear primacy reflected in the Casas Grandes and Trincheras data, which are neighbors of the Rfo Sonora region. These pat­terns match contextual expectations of the overly dominant character of the largest settlement (McGuire and Villalpando 2011; Whalen and Minnis 200la). Marana, an example drawn from the Hohokam region, follows a roughly log-nor­mal pattern except for the tail end of the distrib­ution. Independent lines of data confirm horizon­tal economic interdependence as well as hierarchical relationships in this settlement com­munity (Fish et al. l 992b). The Sonora Valley data approximate a log-normal distribution form a distinctly convex distribution. As noted, there are currently two political units identified in this region, but it is possible that the settlement system was moving towards centralization. All other east­ern Sonora valleys have significantly convex dis­tributions. In the case of the Bavispe data, the survey was noncontiguous. As a result, portions of non-integrated systems were included. The data nonetheless highlight a lack of any obvious regional primate centers in the surveyed areas. 
Data from both the Moctezuma and Onavas val­
leys suggest that multiple smaller scale units (or 
portions thereof) are subsumed in the survey area. 
Several important observations are suggested by 
this dataset. The valleys that have overwhelm­
ingly dominated the literature of northwest 
Mexico-Casas Grandes and Magdalena­
Trincheras-are unique cases. It is also clear that 
there is a fair degree of variation within the Rfo 
Sonora region, as suggested by the variance in 
A-statistics between the Sonora Valley data com­
pared to the Moctezuma, Bavispe, and Onavas 
valleys. Overall, though, eastern Sonora appears 
to be characterized by geographically very small­
scale sociopolitical units. 
To summarize, the data indicate that there are multiple political units captured within the 30­km reach of the Moctezuma Valley. This is visu­ally perceptible in Figure 3, in which the settle­ment pattern is bisected by a narrow portion of the valley, with the major sites of El Nogal in the south and Teonadepa in the north anchoring two separate communities. Presumably the level of economic and political integration was greater within these communities than between them. This pattern appears to be the most common for political units in the Rfo Sonora region and indi­cates groups of significantly smaller scale than those inferred from ethnohistoric research. 
Public Architecture and Infrastructure 
The organization of large-scale labor projects, whether for subsistence or ideologically moti­vated purposes, is a standard indicator of man­agerial hierarchy. In the Northwest/Southwest the distribution of public architecture is particularly informative because such features play critical roles in legitimizing local leadership offices and therefore reflect the scales at which integration was achieved (Lekson 1991; Wilcox 1991). The Rfo Sonora area differs from neighboring regions for its lack of public architecture. A few large enclosures, possibly ball courts, were identified in the Sonora Valley (Doelle 1989; Doolittle 1988; Riley 2005), but similar examples are not present in the Bavispe or Moctezuma valleys. Possible platform mounds were found in both of these val­leys, but neither was associated with large settle­ments and both were so small that their role as public architecture is questionable.

Moctezuma Valley example is only 11 m by 6 m at its base and 1 m tall. Pedro de Castaneda, a chronicler of the Coronado expedition (Hammond and Rey 1940), states that leaders stood upon ter­races to issue directions, but these may have been natural features. Las Casas mentions temples of stone and mud that contained idols and the seated• bodies of deceased rulers, but because he never visited the area, the reference is questionable. In general, public architecture or other constructions that would have provided a focal point for large­scale integration are absent from the Rio Sonora area. Minimally, it can be stated that an archaeo­logically visible, consistently replicated form of public architecture is lacking in the region. The variance in recorded features may also suggest a lack of agreed-upon forms to effectively materi­alize group membership and attendant leadership positions. In regional comparison, these Rio Sonora forms reflect a much more middling effort at integration than Pueblo great kivas or great houses, Casas Grandes ball courts, Trincheras terraced hills, or Hohokam platform mound and antecedent ball court communities. 
It is also worth noting that, in contrast to sur­rounding areas, Rio Sonora subsistence produc­tion would not have required large-scale coordi­nation. Irrigation continues to be practiced on a relatively small scale throughout the region. The narrow river and the steep flanking mesas pre­clude expanding irrigation to the upper terraces. Even today, most canals are at most a few kilo­meters long and most no more than a few hundred meters (Doolittle 1988; Sheridan 1996). Laterals directly off of the main river remain a common practice. These small systems would not require the large-scale control and coordination postu­lated for neighboring desert groups (e.g., Abbott 2003; DiPeso 1974). 
Exchange of Prestige Goods 
The manipulation of rare goods exchange economies is frequently associated with leader­ship offices in middle-range societies (Earle 1982; Friedman and Rowlands 1977). The exchange of rare goods can bind the upper echelons of dis­parate political units into networks of reciprocity and other forms of economic interaction. Under­standing the topology of the exchange of rare goods can thus aid in delineating political inte­


gration. Because rare goods are often exchanged between political units, the distribution networks should be larger than any one local political unit. How such objects were utilized in political machi­nations will be the subject of a forthcoming arti­cle. For the present analysis, the exact role of prestige goods does not need to be reconstructed, so long as two assumptions can be made: (I) rare materials, once acquired, were dispersed among at least some inhabitants of the largest settlements within local political units; and (2) exclusion from a given exchange network likely implies simul­taneous exclusion from corresponding political networks. Obviously not all individuals received the beneficence of local leaders. There seems little doubt of this in the Moctezuma Valley; al­most no items that could be considered exotic were discovered at most small sites. However, it seems unlikely that polities of similar size would participate in mutually exclusive exchange net­works unless they were also divided into different political units and likely different macro-ex­change networks. In short, the size of the ex­change network of rare goods should surpass or equal the limit of any political boundary, but not be smaller (Supplemental Figure 4). 
Data on rare goods from the Moctezuma Val­ley are limited to obsidian. Obsidian is not locally available and is often interpreted as a prestige good circulated in rare goods economies (Bayman 1995; Mills et al. 2013; Mitchell and Shackley 1995). There is a clear difference between the largest sites of the Moctezuma Valley, with only 16 obsidian artifacts recovered at El Noga!, com­pared to 123 at Teonadepa. Fieldwork at El Noga) collected all observed obsidian. At Teonadepa, obsidian was so ubiquitous that the collection strategy targeted only excavated materials and a surface sample. Excavations focused on similar contexts at both sites, and there are no other ap­parent biasing factors to explain this difference. Only one other site recorded during survey, La Cuchilla (Son L:1 :6), contained significant amounts of obsidian on the surface. This site was also located in the northern portion of the project zone and conforms to expectations of a near-de­mographic peer of Teonadepa that participated in the same exchange network of rare goods.

Bavispe Valley. The data suggest that whatever 
economic processes regularly delivered obsidian 
materials to Teonadepa and La Cuchilla did not 
include El Nogal. Given the relatively similar 
size of these sites, this is taken as evidence that 
the same political unit did not subsume both sites. 
In fact, it may suggest that these two sites not 
only were not in the same local political unit but 
were in different macro-interaction spheres. In 
short, obsidian was clearly a rare good that only 
certain individuals could obtain from connections 
outside the valley. The fact that one large site, 
Teonadepa, regularly obtained the resource and 
another, El Nogal, did not indicates that the upper 
echelons of these two settlements did not interact 
in the same political economy. This leads to the simple observation that they were likely in dif­ferent political units. 

Artifact Style Boundaries 
Perhaps the most tra<iitiona\ o1 al\ method'& foy discerning boundaries in the archaeological record is the delineation of styles of material culture. There are a litany of theories that underpin the ultimate source of variation in such patterns spe­cific to both material categories and particular ecological and historical contexts (Green and Perlman 1985). Stylistic boundaries are clearly not reliably isomorphic with any form of social or political boundary. But as Hegmon (1992:528) points out, although the absence of boundaries cannot be interpreted as evidence of cultural ho­mogeneity, the presence of material culture boundaries can most often be interpreted as a re­liable marker of social distinction. 
In many cases, a clear argument can be made that stylistic differences were intentionally ma­nipulated to signify membership in a group. Whether the impetus to make use of such sym­bolic content was intentionally undertaken to de­marcate exterior relationships or was the result of managing relationships within the group (sensu Hodder 1985) is not critical to the present case. In both instances, it can be assumed that the re­sulting borders would likely be coterminous with-or greater than -political boundaries. That is, the perceived boundary might include multiple political units that made use of identical or related symbolic repertoires, and multiple fonts of sym­bolism might be employed in any one political unit, but it seems unlikely that political units 
would surpass the size of these stylistic bound­
aries (Renfrew 1986:2). Parenthetically, research 
in the broader region has shown that groups 
avoided prolonged participation in multiple social 
networks that employed non-congruous symbolic 
content. Rather than imparting benefits by span­
ning multiple traditions, such social brokerage 
positions lead to instability (Peeples and Haas 
2013). 
Alternatively, some stylistic differences are 
arguably reflective of unconscious behaviors. 
Tasks were performed in certain ways because 
that is how they were encoded into social learning 
frameworks and remained mostly at the level of subconscious habitus (Dietler and Herbich 1998, after Bourdieu 1977). In many cases, such vari­ance would not be an intentional means of de­marcating social affiliation, but it is still useful to archaeologists as a means to identify commu­

of delineation: (1) those that were manipulated with the intent of purposefully signaling ascrip­tion to specific groups; (2) and those that were the result of following rote manufacturing patterns but are nonetheless useful for discerning certain kinds of group membership. These alternative approaches have the potential to identify cross­cutting memberships in different kinds of groups, but in the present case the discussed boundaries appear largely coterminous. 
Ceramics. Substantial differences are apparent in the ceramic assemblages from El Nogal and Teonadepa (Figure 5). The small painted sherd assemblages provide the clearest example of dif­ferences that were intentionally manipulated. There is a near mutual exclusion of painted types, with Teonadepa adhering to a Chihuahuan tradi­tion reminiscent of Casas Grandes, and El Nogal participating in poorly defined traditions of south­ern and western Sonora. The one exception is a specific type of the Chihuahuan tradition, here labeled Babicora-like. This type is nearly absent from Teonadepa but present at El Nogal. Overall, the Chihuahuan and Sonoran groups are mani­festly different. Chihuahuan ceramics are mostly slipped white with red and black polychrome de­signs.2 Sonoran ceramics are unslipped brown­wares and utilize a variety of hematite paints, in-
