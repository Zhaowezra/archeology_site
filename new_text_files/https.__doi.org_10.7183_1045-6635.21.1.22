CRAF T SPECIA LISTS AT MOCHE: 
ORGANIZATION, AFFILIATIONS, AN D IDEN TITIES 

Helene Bernier 
This article examines the organization of specialized craft production at the urban site of Moche, known as the capital of the Southern Moche state. Recent excavations in workshop contexts revealed that the urban population of Moche was in part composed of ceramists, metallurgists, and lapidaries. These craft specialists played a significant role in the economic, political, and religious spheres of the Moche polity. Data obtained during excavations of workshops and domestic com­pounds are used to analyze the context, scale, and intensity of craft production, taking into account the nature of the goads produced and the identity of consumers. The discussion also considers the integration of craft specialists into the daily life and social structure at the site of Moche. Excavations showed that while urban craft specialists were not independent. they were not tightly controlled by a centralized ruling elite. They produced symbolic goods in various small to middle-scale workshops integrated into residential units, under the direct authority of urban leaders taking advantage of this particular organization of semi-attached craft production in various status-building strategies.

he presence of craft specialists has been Tconsidered long ago as an important crite­rion in the definition of prehistoric states (Childe 1950; Service 1962:148). More recently, specialized craft production has emerged as a major focus of archaeological research regarding complex societies. The identification of craft specialization in the archaeological record, as well as the analy­sis of the organization and functions of craft pro­duction, held the attention of researchers (Brumfiel and Earle 1987; Clark 1995; Clark and Parry 1990; Costin 1991; Costin and Wright 1998; Evans 1978; Helms 1993; Tosi 1984). It is generally held that 
craft specialization refers to situations in which skilled craftsmen are at least partially withdrawn from alimentary production, obtaining food and essential subsistence goods in return for the objects they produce (Costin 1991:4; Evans 1978:115; Muller 1984:49). Craft specialists possess abilities that are beyond the reach of the average member of the society (Vaughn 2004:62) and produce mate­rial goods intended for consumption outside their own households (Inomata 2001:322). From one society to another, craft specialization answers var­ious economic, social, and political needs and ben­efits diverse population strata. The organization of

CRAFT SPECIALISTS AT MOCHE 
this social phenomenon is also highly variable and depends on many factors of which context, inten­sity, and scale, as defined by Costin (1991) in a widely cited study, are most often used in diverse models of analysis. 
This particular study focuses on investigating the organization of craft specialization in the Moche society between the fifth and eighth century A.D., a time period that corresponds to the Moche IV phase in the southern part of the Moche territory. I examine data from the site of Moche, considered as the urban capital of the Southern Moche Polity. 1 By analyzing data from workshops and consump­tion contexts, I argue that the presence of interre­lated characteristics generally assumed in complex societies such as large-scale and centralized work­shops, full-time craft specialists, and the state­sponsored production of luxury crafts (Costin 1991:11, 18; Junker 1999:267) does not entirely correspond to archaeological evidence uncovered at Moche. 
Excavations in the Moche urban capital showed that urban craft specialists were not totally inde­pendent and were involved in the political and ide­ological spheres of the Moche society. However, specialized craft production was not rigorously con­trolled by the centralized ruling elite. Artisans worked in various small to middle-scale workshops integrated into domestic architectural compounds. They produced symbolic goods visually that con­formed to the Moche collective identity, most likely under the direct authority of urban leaders at the head of lineages, extended families, or corporate groups. Through the production, handling, and dis­tribution of such material symbols, urban leaders were able to increase their sociopolitical status and develop their participation in the state organization. 

; The Organization of Craft Specialization 
The context of specialized craft production refers to the degree of affiliation between artisans and elite members. First considered by Earle ( 1981), the dis­tinction between independent and attached con­texts is now a major aspect of the theoretical framework of archaeologists. Attached or elite­sponsored craft specialists are submitted to the con­trol of elite patrons and produce for a restricted group of consumers. Independent specialists, exempt from any elite authority, produce for an 
unspecified demand. Independent specialists also hold the rights of alienation over their products and they are subject to the law of supply and demand (Brumfiel and Earle 1987 :5; Clark 1995:286; Clark and Parry 1990:298; Costin 1991: 11; Gero 1983 :41--42). Production by attached specialists is related to the need of exerting a control over the production and distribution of certain goods that have an important function in the political and ide­ological spheres. Choices made by independent craft specialists, not directly dictated by patron's exigencies, are rather motivated by needs of econ­omy and production efficiency (Costin 1991:11; Junker 1999:262-263). Earle's twofold analysis of context, although still at the center of most studies on craft specialization, has been more recently developed and broadened. Some scholars now con­sider a category of"embedded" specialists who are neither completely independent nor attached (Ames 1995: 158; Janusek 1999: 126), discuss the identity of attached artisans (lnomata 2001), or examine other social elements influencing their work (Spiel­man 2002:202). 
The intensity of production corresponds to the time devoted by the artisans to their specialized activities. Whereas full-tjme specialists devote 
themselves only to craft production and depend entirely on other members of the society in order to acquire subsistence goods, part-time specialists remain partly autonomous (Costin 1991:16). The part-time independent production has the advan­tage of being polyvalent and flexible in case of a drop in demand (Brumfiel 1998:146), while the production by full-time attached specialists, totally dependent, is more easily controlled by the elite (Costin 1996:212). 
The scale of craft production refers to the size of production units, that is to say the number of arti­sans working in a workshop or the importance of the population the workshop serves (Costin 1991:15; Feinman et al. 1984:309). In a minimal scale of production corresponding to a single indi­vidual, a household or a small family group, arti­sans are probably recruited in accordance with kinship. In opposite, in a very large production scale, objects are produced in large workshops by artisans recruited according to their skills and avail­ability (van der Leeuw 1977). The scale is gener­ally determined by the volume of demand. It is also influenced by a concern for efficiency and econ-

omy in the case of independent production, and by supervision needs in the case of attached produc­tion (Costin 1991:15-16). 
The nature of the goods produced by artisans is another important element in the study of craft spe­cialization. Subsistence goods, essential to hous­ing, defense, transport, cloth making and food production, are opposed to prestigious goods, whose utility extends far beyond basic subsistence needs. Prestige technologies are also labor­intensive, time consuming, and involve high artis­tic skills as well as exotic and costly materials (Brumfiel and Earle 1987; G. Clark 1986; Costin 1991; Hayden 1995, 1998; Helms 1993; Peebles and Kus 1977; Yerkes 1991). Both categories of goods show distinct production dynamics. Subsis­tence goods are normally produced by artisans seeking to improve technical qualities and increase efficiency. Prestigious objects are crafted by arti­sans following the opposite logic, deliberately investing time and energy to increase their mater­ial value. It is generally thought that utilitarian goods were produced more often in independent context, while prestigious goods tended to be pro­duced by attached specialists (Clark and Parry 1990:319-321; Costin 1991: 11; Junker 1999:267). 
Moche Society and the 
Urban Capital of Moche 

The Moche polity flourished on the Peruvian coastal desert between the first and the eighth cen­tury A.D. This complex society settled in valleys irrigated by rivers flowing westward from the Andes to the Pacific Ocean, in a narrow littoral strip stretching between the Piura Valley and the Nepefia Valley. The Southern Moche polity is con­sidered as the first expansionist state to emerge on the Peruvian coast, from the Moche III phase begin­ning around the fourth century A.D. (Bawden 1996:227-248; Castillo and Uceda 2008:714; Chapdelaine 2000: 125, 2001 :69, 2002:81; Mose­ley 1992:166; Topic 1977:366, 1982:270; Wilson 1988:333). Considered as a center of primary importance within the Moche polity, the site of Moche is located six kilometers inland from the Pacific Ocean, on the south bank of the Moche River. The site is composed of a 60-hectare plain bordered by two monumental platforms: Huaca del Sol and Huaca de la Luna, standing at the base of a hill named Cerro Blanco. In the plain between the two platforms lies an extensive urban sector buried beneath thick layers of sand and sediments, with residential architectural compounds separated by streets and open public areas (Figure I) (Chapdelaine 1997, 2001, 2002, 2003; Montoya et al. 2000; van Gijseghem 1997, 2001). 
The site of Moche was occupied by members of the ruling elite maintaining the authority and the continuity of ritual activities and state institutions. The site was also occupied by a large urban popu­lation composed of lineages or corporate groups of which members were characterized by unequal economic status and were endowed with various social roles.2 The urban population was integrated into the Moche political structure at many levels: trade, ritual, administration, non-alimentary pro­duction, and large-scale architectural and artistic projects (Chapdelaine 2001). 
The first large-scale excavations at Moche were organized in the 1970s by the Chan Chan-Moche Valley Project of Harvard University. These exca­vations permitted a detailed study of Moche funer­ary practices (Donnan and Mackey 1978), and also led to a greater understanding of domestic archi­tecture (Topic 1977) and subsistence patterns (Pozorski 1979). Beginning in 1991, the Peruvian project Huaca de la Luna (PHLL), directed by San­tiago Uceda and Ricardo Morales from the Uni­versidad Nacional de Trujillo, furthered considerably the knowledge regarding monumen­tal architecture and urbanism (Uceda 2001; Uceda et al. 1997, 1998, 2000, 2003, 2006; Uceda and Tufinio 2003). Between 1995 and 2000, the urban sector was the object of a research program involv­ing the University of Montreal and the Universi­dad Nacional de Trujillo. This program called Zona Urbana Moche (ZUM) provided new data about Moche urban and social organization during the apogee or Moche IV phase (Bernier 2006; Chapde­laine 1997, 1998, 1999; Chapdelaine et al. 2003; Uceda and Chapdelaine 1998). The data discussed in this article were collected during excavations conducted by PHLL and ZUM projects. 
The presence of craft specialists in Moche soci­ety is well documented and has already been sub­ject of studies (Donnan and McClelland 1999; Russel et al. 1994, 1998; Russel and Jackson 2001; Shimada 1978, 1994a, 2001; Uceda and Armas 1998; Uceda and Rengifo 2006). Recent discover-

ies at Moche provided important data leading to a better understanding of the organization of craft activities. Excavations and surface collections 
. revealed the existence of seven workshops dedi­
'. cated to specialized production, all dating from the Moche IV phase. Ceramists, potters, metalwork­ers, and lapidaries represented a sizeable part of the population living at Moche, playing a significant role in the economic, political, and religious spheres of the Southern Moche state. 
Workshops at Moche 

While data collected in burials and habitation struc­tures might provide evidence about consumption contexts and consumers of goods produced by craft specialists, the study of the organization of pro­duction mainly focuses on data obtained in work­shop contexts. It is important to consider that the recovery of archaeological evidence of craft pro­duction do not necessarily indicate the existence of specialists. Moche workshops, dedicated to spe­cialized production, are characterized by the dis­covery of permanent structures and dense concentrations of direct evidence related to craft activities, in opposition to the rest of the urban sec­tor where traces of consumption strongly dominate. Direct evidence consists of raw materials, tools, debris, and unfinished, broken, or flawed objects abandoned during the manufacturing process.

Ceramics 
A ceramic workshop specializing in the manufac­ture of ritual objects was discovered and partially excavated by archaeologists from the Universidad Nacional de Trujillo in 1994 and 1995 (Armas 1998; Uceda and Armas 1997, 1998). The work­shop was occupied during the Moche IV phase and has been renovated three times. Composed of at least 15 rooms covering at least 64 m2 during the first occupation and probably more than 300 m2 during the last occupation, the working area was mainly dedicated to the specialized production of figurines, musical instruments, decorated vessels, and molded necklace elements, using fine clay. Floor-intrusive kilns, grinding stones, matrices, molds, unfired pieces, pigments, as well as tools like potter's plates, scrapers, polishers, and bur­nishers were discovered in the ceramic workshop, suggesting that all steps of ceramic production were undertaken in situ (Table 1, Figure 2). Pastes and tempers were prepared, matrices and molds were created, and pieces were molded, painted, dried, fired, and stored in the workshop (UcedaandArmas 1997:102, 1998:103). 
A second ceramic workshop was dedicated exclusively to the production of domestic vessels. This extensive working area is located outside the urban sector, at the base of the Cerro Blanco, and has not been excavated yet. Surface assemblages show that cooking pots (ollas), neck jars (can­taros), and large storage jars (tinajas) were shaped, dried, and fired in the domestic pottery workshop. Evidence of in situ production include concentra­tions of ashes, unfired and fragmented flawed ves­sels, potter's plates, scrapers, polishers, and high concentration of domestic sherds (Jara 2000:39). Although surface observations do not allow a pre­cise estimation of the size of the domestic pottery workshop, the 10,000 m2 covered by sherd con-

centrations indicate the importance of the work­ing area. 
Metals 
Moche metallurgists used a variety of sophisticated techniques to work copper and, to a lesser extent, gold. Metal ingots were cast into stone molds or thinned into sheets that were afterwards gilded by electrochemical replacement plating or mise en couleur techniques. Sheets were then cut, folded, embossed, stamped, and soldered (Donnan 1973; Jones 1979; Lechtman 1984, 1988; Lechtman et al. 1982). Such metalworking processes and tech­niques required specialized tools, structures, and workshops. 
Two metal workshops were discovered in the Moche urban sector. First, a cylindrical adobe fur-

nace with a 1.23 meter chimney was found in a 20 square-meter room of Compound 7 (see Figure 1 ). The structure has an orifice at the base, probably intended to insert fuel, blocked with a mud brick fashioned in order to fit exactly its shape (Figure 3). The clay mortar covering the furnace's inner wall was heavily burnt and the base was covered with a compact layer of ashes and charcoal. Neu­tron activation analysis of the mortar revealed a con­centration of gold residues 16 times higher than the average concentration for a clay sample from Moche. A crucible containing the remains of cop­per was also found close to the chimney. The struc­ture was free from any ore and smelting residues, however. It was probably used to melt ingots of pure precious metals for the manufacturing or the plat­ing of delicate objects (Chapdelaine 1998:93; Chapdelaine et al. 2001:388). 
A second area dedicated to metallurgy was dis­covered in 2003 at Moche, in Compound 27 (see Figure 1 ). In this workshop covering 54 m2, archae­

; ologists found concentrations of scoriae, copper residues, sheet fragments, as well as copper prills resulting from the smelting process that was most likely taking place closer to mines or fuel sources (Figure 4 ). Beads, needles, spears, a tumi knife and a mace head were among the finished objects found in the workshop. Tools such as tuyeres, crucibles, hammers, polishers, and anvils stained with cop­per were also discovered (Table 2) (Figure 5) (Chiguala et al. 2004:112-114, 126-128; Uceda and Rengifo 2006: 163-164 ). The presence of prills and various tools indicate that many steps of the

metallurgical process were carried out in Com­pound 27. Artisans melted pure metals, annealed ingots, thinned sheet metal, and shaped objects from these sheets. 
Stone 
Three workshops dedicated exclusively to stone adornment production were discovered and exca­vated in the Moche urban sector. Since the manu­facture of stone adornments does not necessitate a permanent installation, archaeological evidence of lapidary work is essentially composed of concen­trations of small objects abandoned by artisans, such as blanks, cutting debris, and adornments bro­ken or abandoned in the process of manufacture (Table 3, Figure 6). Complete finished adornments are rare and were probably regularly collected. Var­ious tools are also present in lapidary workshops, such as polishers and blades (Figure 7). 
The largest workshop extends vertically on three Moche IV occupational floors and was found in Compound 12 (see Figure 1). While material evi­dence of production covers 30 m2, the high con­centration of debris covers approximately 12 m2. Steatite-like local stone was the most abundant material used by the artisans of Compound 12 in order to make beads and pendants. This soft stone was not systematically recycled and was probably not of great material value. Turquoise was also used

in the workshop to make small beads, mosaic pieces, and inlays. This valuable stone was much more difficult to acquire than steatite; even the smallest pieces and debris of turquoise were thus used and re-cut to make minute irregular beads. 
Two additional lapidary workshops showed very similar types of material evidence with regard to technology of production, tools, as well as style and iconography of the finished products. The second area dedicated to stone adornment production was discovered in Compound 37 (see Figure l). It is lim­ited to one occupational floor and concentrated in a single room, from which six m2 were excavated (Bernier 2005:215-219). Discovered and excavated in 2005, the third lapidary workshop was located in Compound 17 (see Figure 1). The working area extended on 17 m2 in a single room renovated three times during the Moche IV phase (Chiguala et al. 2006:149, 195-199). 
The artifactual content of ceramic, metal, and lapidary workshops strongly contrast with mater­ial remains usually recovered in household con­texts. As an example, Table 4 compares the concentrations of objects directly related to craft activities present in workshops and those present

The Context of Moche Craft Production: 
Ethnohistorical Data 

Russel and Jackson (2001) and Shimada (2001) used ethnohistorical data from sixteenth-century administrative colonial documents in order to reconstruct the organization of Moche craft pro­duction in the Chicama and Lambayeque valleys. At the time of the Spanish conquest, north coast polities were characterized by a dual political orga­nization in which each hierarchical level was com­posed of social groups or parcialidades that were paired and integrated under the authority of the upper-level groups. Parcialidades included extended families and social groups specializing in agriculture, fishing, or craft production (Netherly 1984, 1990; Ramirez-Horton 1981; Rostworowski 1977). The flexible organizational structure of par­cialidad systems could be split, subdivided, and reorganized, allowing the integration of conquered populations without major reorganization in their political structures. ·consequently, small political

systems could survive despite the conquest or dis­mantling of their upper hierarchical levels (Netherly 1984:230-233 , 1990:463-464). 
The great stability . through time attributed to parcialidad systems provides basis for the recon­structions of Shimada and Russel and Jackson, according to whom dual organizations were pre­sent in Lambayeque and Chicama Valleys during Moche domination. Some parcialidades would have included groups of craft specialists attached to leaders of various hierarchical levels (Russel and Jackson 2001: 161-162; Shimada2001:196). In the Chicama Valley. for example, these specialists had to provide a material tribute to elite members of the highest level who, in tum, ensured a redistribution of food, materials, or services. Attached craft spe­cialists were also under obligation to exchange goods with other family groups of their own par­cialidad (Russel and Jackson 2001:161-164). 

Whereas sixteenth-century documents provide evidence for a dual organization in the Moche val­ley during the late Prehispanic period (Netherly 1990), the existence of a system of parcialidades is not clearly documented in the archaeological record at the time of the Moche occupation, eight centuries before. Dual systems should be reflected by archaeological patterns such as pairs of similar constructions, architectural features forming sym­metric, mirrored images (Moore 1995: 168), or dual divisions in irrigation canal networks (Netherly 
1984 ). On the other hand, the abundance of primary context archaeological data uncovered during con­trolled excavations at Moche allows complement­ing the ethnohistorical analogy with a reconstruction of the organization of craft produc­tion based on archaeological evidence.

Location of Workshops 
In the archaeological record, the location of work­shops is one of the main criteria for distinction between independent and attached specialization (Costin 1991:25; J. Clark 1986:26). While inde­pendent specialists are exempt from constraints related to elite supervision, attached specialists

should work in workshops located close to monu­mental architecture, elite residences, or large-scale storage facilities, helping the administration of pro­duction (Costin 1991:25; J. Clark 1986:26). Fol­lowing this reasoning, archaeological data seem to indicate a context of attached production in the Moche urban sector, although no workshop has been discovered in direct association with a mon­umental compound. Workshops of the urban sec­tor were located between 100 and 225 m from the main platform of Huaca de la Luna (see figure l ). They were therefore located relatively close to the seat of religious activities of the ruling elite, in a political, religious, and administrative center of the Moche state, facilitating the supervision over the production. Moreover, the fine ceramic workshop was located on the east side of Avenida 1, charac­terized by high-status domestic architecture (Ver­ano et al. 1999) and a funerary platform where prestigious burials were discovered (Chauchat and Gutierrez 2003, 2004; Uhle 1913:106-107). 
Nature of the Goods and Identity of Consumers 
The nature of the goods produced in workshops also reveals the context of craft production. While inde­pendent specialists, subject to competition, logi­cally favor an economical and efficient production appropriate for subsistence goods, attached spe­cialists are supported by elite patrons from whom they depend. The production of luxury goods, responding to elite demands and involving complex technologies, expensive materials, and high energy investments, most likely indicates the presence of attached specialists (Brumfiel and Earle 1987:5; J. Clark 1986:44; Vaughn 2004:63). 
At the site of Moche, the nature and functions of the objects produced in urban workshops, as well as the identity of those who acquired them, clearly involve a certain degree of affiliation between craft specialists and the local elite. Accord­ing to archaeological evidence encountered in workshop contexts, the majority of objects pro­duced by specialized ceramists, metallurgists, and lapidaries could be described as intennediate goods (Table 5, Figure 8). These goods were not merely utilitarian objects without symbolic or material value, easy to produce when needed by everyone. On the other hand, they did not constitute the most prestigious objects found exclusively in elite buri­als that reflect a substantial investment of energy and prestigious materials by highly skilled artisans who had access to an elaborate knowledge. 
Intermediate goods were made of various mate­rials. Many were crafted with resources available

and abundant locally such as steatites, clay, tem­per and iron oxides. Others, like metal implements, inlaid adornments, or painted vessels, were made with materials of higher value due to their scarcity and their foreign origin, introduced from outside the Moche Valley or even outside the Moche terri­tory. Copper deposits are located in the high por­tions of coastal valleys such as Vini, Zana and La Leche (Shimada 1982: 164 ). Turquoise used to pro­duce adornments and inlays was obtained from sources located in southern Peru or in Bolivia (Alva 1994:99). Kaolin, used as a white pigment to dec­orate ceramic objects, was acquired from the north­ern Andes (Topic and Topic 1983:252). These foreign materials circulated by the means of exchange networks most likely controlled by elites. 
Intermediate goods were used in various con­texts by a wide range of individuals. Most of the Moche IV elite burials found in association with the monumental architecture at Moche contained 
; offerings such as decorated vessels, musical instru­
. ments, stone beads and pendants, copper imple­ments, and gilded copper personal adornments (Chauchat and Gutierrez 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005; Tufinio 2002). These offerings, similar to objects produced in workshops of the urban sec­tor, provide supplementary evidence for an attached specialized production. The same intermediate goods are also present in the burials of urban dwellers and particularly abundant in their houses, indicating that they were available to the general urban population rather than strictly restricted to

the elite (Bernier 2006; Chapdelaine 1998; Chapde­laine et al. 1997; Tello, Armas, and Chapdelaine 2003). 
More importantly, intermediate goods produced by craft specialists of the urban sector possessed a strong symbolic meaning expressed by the deco­ration, the figurative representations, or by the con­texts in which they were used. They served as markers of status, identity, and belief, as material symbols in domestic and public rituals, and as social tools to further political ambitions, commu­nicate membership within groups, and reinforce differences between competitive factions. Deco­rated vessels, feminine figurines, musical instru­ments, personal adornments, and copper spears and knives are good examples of Moche intermediate goods. 
Moche decorated vessels were privileged means of expressing the complex ideology. They were also privileged funerary offerings and were most 
likely used during competitive displays of wealth, 
household rituals, or feasts. Stylistically standard­ized feminine figurines were present in nearly all domestic contexts excavated, either complete or broken off following definite patterns. They were probably used as amulets during domestic rituals or considered as imbued with protective or magi­cal properties (Limoges 1999:135-138; Prieto 2008:313-314). Personal adornments were also stylistically standardized and they mirror figurative images present in Moche ceramic iconography (Bernier 1999). This thematic relation indicates

that figurative adornments possessed a strong sym­bolic value, despite of their simplicity. The most common musical instruments in Moche production and consumption contexts are whistles, ocarinas, and rattles. Often richly decorated, they were most likely personal objects used during processions, household celebrations, and funerary rituals (Des­jardins 2000:137). Bourget (2001:113) proposed that whistles belonged to a special category of musi­cal instruments, ideologically related to human offerings and the cult of the ancestors. Copper spears and knives were used in ritual hunts and sac­rifices. Tumi knives were highly symbolic funer­ary offerings associated with high-status men and women of the urban sector. 
Organization of Attached Craft Production 
Pretending that Moche urban craft specialists were attached to an elite group only gives a vague idea about the real identity of the patrons holding a con­trol over craft production. Many categories of elites, invested with various roles and unequal power, were present simultaneously in the Moche state and represented at the site of Moche. It is assumed that the Southern Moche capital housed members the ruling elite culminating the social hierarchy, appropriating the power and maintaining the authority over labor force, the official ideology, and symbols by which it was materialized (Baw­den 1996: 108-138). While no royal tomb was dis-
