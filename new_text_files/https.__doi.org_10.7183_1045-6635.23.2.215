DONUT STONES AS THIGH-SUPPORTED SPINDLE WHORLS: 
EVIDENCE OF ANCIENT MAYA HOUSEHOLD 
YARN AND CORDAGE PRODUCTION 

John J. Tomasic 
Donut stones are a relatively common class of ground stone artifact found at archaeological sites throughout Mesoamer­ica and Andean South America. and a variety of functional interpretations have been proposed for these artifacts. In this article, ethnographic, ethnohistoric, and archaeological data are presented along with the results of replicative experiments in support of an argument that some donut stones from the Maya Highlands and Southern Lowlands may have functioned as whorls for a previously unrecognized type of thigh-supported spindle. Based on a functional interpretation of donut stones as thigh-supported spindle whorls, these artifacts can potentially be used to provide insight into the nature of ancient Maya household yarn and cordage production.

onut stones, which are also referred to in Dthe archaeological literature as doughnut stones (lnomata 1995:578-580), perfo­rated stones (Kidder et al. 1946:141-142), and ring-stones (Willey 1972:134-137), are cylindri­cally shaped ground stone artifacts with a central hole formed by biconical drilling (Figure 1). Within the Maya Highlands and Southern Low­lands (Figure 2) these artifacts are primarily found in household contexts dating to the Late Preclas­sic and Classic periods (250 B .C.-A.D. 850) (lno­mata 1995:578-580; Kidder et al. 1946: 141-142; Kovacevich 2006:456-457; Moholy-Nagy 2003:48; Sheets 1978:37-38, 2006; Willey 1972:134-137, 1978:90-93). The overall dimen­sions of donut stones can vary considerably, with most donut stones ranging between 10-20 cm in diameter and 5-10 cm in height (lnomata 1995:578-579; Kidder et al. 1946: 141-142; Sheets 2002: 145-150; Willey 1972: 134-137, 1978:90-93). Most donut stones are undecorated with smooth exteriors, but examples bearing more elaborate carved and incised designs on their exte­riors are not uncommon (Moholy-Nagy 2003:48; Sheets 1978:37-38, 2002:145-150; Willey 1972:34-37, 1978:90-93). 
In this article, several lines of evidence are pre­sented in support of a functional interpretation of some donut stones from the Maya Highlands and Southern Lowlands as tools used in household yam and cordage production. Previously, donut stones from the Maya Highlands and Southern Lowlands have been interpreted primarily as digging stick weights (Kidder et al. 1946:141), mace heads (Moholy-Nagy 2003:48), spear shaft weights (Wil­ley 1972:136), and perforated mortars (lnomata 1995:578-579; Sheets 2006:70). This article begins with a critical review of these previous functional interpretations of donut stones. Next, ethnographic and ethnohistoric data are presented in support of the idea that some of these artifacts might have functioned instead as whorls for thigh-supported

spindles. Archaeological data are also presented from the meticulously excavated, rapidly aban­doned sites of Ceren and Aguateca, as well as from sites throughout the Maya Highlands and South­ern Lowlands, showing an association between donut stones and household fiber spinning activi­ties. Finally, replicative experiments using modem copies of donut stones as whorls for thigh-sup­ported spindles have provided insight into the man­ner in which these artifacts might have been used, the types of fiber that might have been spun, and the types of yarn and cordage that might have been produced using this technique. 
Overall, this article suggests that donut stones have been overlooked as potential whorls used in thigh-supported spinning for a number of reasons, including a lack of understanding of prehistoric fiber spinning technologies, a lack of precise con­textual information on donut stones in archaeo­logical excavations, and an uncritical acceptance of previous interpretations of donut stones, many of which were not particularly sensitive to evi­dence of female domestic activities in the archae­ological record. As potential spinning tools, donut stones can provide critical evidence regarding the nature of ancient Maya household yarn and cordage production. 
Previous Functional Interpretations of Donut Stones 
One of the oldest, most widely accepted interpre­tations is that donut stones functioned as digging stick weights. Digging sticks are long, sharp sticks used to create holes for sowing seeds in agricultural fields in Mesoamerica (Palerm 1967). During the World War II era excavations at Kaminaljuyu, large numbers of donut stones were recovered through­out the site, and these artifacts were interpreted as probable digging stick weights (Kidder et al. 1946: 141-142). Presumably, the donut stone would add weight to the digging stick and facilitate the cre­ation of holes for the sowing of seeds. In the 1950s and 1960s, as donut stones were found at other sites, the digging stick weight interpretation gained wider acceptance, and was generally considered to be the most likely functional interpretation of donut stones from archaeological sites in the Maya Highlands and Southern Lowlands (Willey 1972: 134-137; Wood­bury 1965:165). 
Although the functional interpretation of donut stones as digging stick weights remains one of the most commonly encountered in the archaeological literature, ethnohistoric and ethnographic data actu­ally cast serious doubt upon it. In his study of Con­quest and Colonial period agricultural implements in Mesoamerica, Rojas Rabiela ( 1984) examines both pictorial and written records to demonstrate the types of digging sticks used by Mesoamerican agriculturalists at the time of the conquest. Accord­ing to Rojas Rabiela (1984), planting was done with a relatively simple hardwood stick from 1.5-3 m in length with a sharp, fire hardened point. In their reviews of agricultural implements used by contemporary Maya, Palerm ( 1967) documents the use of a hardwood digging stick roughly 1.5-3 m with a sharp tip, and McBryde (1947:20-23) doc­uments the use of a 2-m long fire hardened pole. Surprisingly, Rojas Rabiela ( 1984), Palerm ( 196 7), and McBryde (1947) make no mention whatso-
