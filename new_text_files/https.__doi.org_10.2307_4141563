
MONTE NEGRO AND THE URBAN REVOLUTION IN OAXACA, MEXICO 
Andrew K. Balkansky, Veronica Perez Rodriguez, and Stephen A. Kowalewski 
This paper is about Monte Negro's origins, and how this site fits the emerging pattern in studies of Oaxacan urbanization including the Zapotec capital at Monte Alban. Our settlement data from a multivalley regional survey in the Mixteca Alta including Monte Negro allows comparison with other urban centers that we have surveyed. Monte Negro's origins are due to internal settlement shifts, but occurred in the external context of widespread militarism and multiple urban transitions. Examination of local, regional, and macro regional settlement systems through time reveals variation in urban trajectories that current models were not designed to explain. 
Monte Negro se puso el arquetipo de! urbanismo mixteco en los 1930s, cuando sus origenes se vincularon al periodo de fun­daci6n de Monte Alban. Desde entonces, los arque6logos han debatido las causas de su urbanizaci6n y su relaci6n con Monte Alban, postulando explicaciones que citan desde procesos locales y aut6nomos, hasta migraciones o conquistas zapotecas. Nuestros datos de patrones de asentamiento, resultados de un recorrido arqueol6gico de JO valles en la Mixteca Alta central, incluyen a Monte Negro y sitios precursores cercanos a el. Recorrimos terrenos mas alla de la famosa acropolis de Monte Negro y realizamos un mapa que incluye estructuras excluidas del mapa hecho por Alfonso Caso y Jorge R. Acosta. El con­texto regional de Monte Negro nos permite compararlo a nivel regional y macroregional con otros centros urbanos mixtecos. Nuestros resultados sugieren que la urbanizaci6n de Monte Negro comenz6 rapidamente durante el Formativo Tardio, y que este desarrollo Jue parte de una transformaci6n generalizada por toda la Mixteca Alta. Explicamos los or(genes de Monte Negro por medio de un proceso de desarrollo aut6nomo y local, pero subrayamos que estos cambios ocurrieron en un con­texto de militarismo generalizado y multiples transiciones urbanas.

that was seat of the most venerated royal lineage in the prehispanic MixtecaAlta. Burgoa's account of the Mixtec urban genesis-taken from seven­teenth-century informants and earlier written sources-is an accurate description of Monte Negro and its location, and suggests that local set­tlements consolidated to defend against an exter­nal military threat. Monte Negro's urbanization in this mythical-historical account contains the Mix­tec world in microcosm, with noble control over land and intensification through terracing as the economic basis of social stratification, the signifi­cance of ritual and divine sanction in the constitu­tion of political authority, and settlement patterns in which farmer-householder-soldiers lived and worked on their terraces. Mixtec ethnohistorical sources suggest that warfare was endemic but not subsistence based, and instead directed toward community self-preservation and the maintenance of elite prerogatives (Spores 1983a). 
Monte Negro has been studied scientifically since the 1930s (Caso 1938), but the absence of sys­tematic regional and macroregional settlement data has made it difficult to situate the site's origins in comparative perspective (Figure 1 ). Survey in the Valley of Oaxaca has placed Monte Alban's long­term evolution in site-level (Blanton 1978) and regional settlement contexts (Blanton et al. 1982; Kowalewski et al. 1989). The debate over Monte 
Alban's origins continues to revolve on the Monte Alban/Valley of Oaxaca survey empirical axis (e.g., Blanton et al. 1999; Marcus and Flannery 1996), underscoring the need for comparable settlement pattern data from the Mixteca Alta. 
Our recent settlement survey in the central Mix­tecaAlta (Balkansky et al. 2000; Kowalewski et al. 1999; Perez 2003), including Monte Negro and its environs, expands the range of variation relevant to debates about Oaxaca's urban revolution. Monte Negro's regional settlement patterns reveal its pop­ulation sources and timing and pattern of urban­ization. Our results indicate that Monte Negro arose from a preexisting local population that was cen­turies-old; this settlement cluster nucleated on the mountaintop overlooking Tilantongo, providing strong empirical support for Burgoa's account.

Monte Negro's residential density, new architec­tural forms, and scale of public construction were unprecedented for its time and place. Monte Negro has the virtue of being unencumbered by later occu­pation-the site was abandoned soon after its foun­dation-leaving an open window into these times. 
Questions about Monte Negro mirror the wider debate in Oaxaca archaeology concerning Monte 

:Alban's conquests during the period of incipient state formation (Balkansky l 998a; Marcus and Flannery 1996: 199-206; Spencer and Redmond 2001a, 200 lb; Zeitlin and Joyce 1999). Monte Negro arose during MonteAlban's founding period (ca. 500-200 B.C.), raising questions about shared material culture, ethnicity, inter-site relationships, and institutional innovations including urbanism and the state (Bernal 1965; Flannery 1983a; Mar­cus 1983a; Winter 1994a). In sorting through these debates, we contend that the relevant scale of analy­sis exceeds any one site and its local valley, and includes, minimally, the several interacting regions that today comprise highland Oaxaca (Figure 2). This analytical approach recalls Price's (1977) observation that studies of urbanism and the state must move beyond the bounds of any single polity and consider interaction among clusters of similar polities (cf. Feinman 1998). On a theoretical level, the Monte Negro results are relevant to questions about whether cities and states arise from one or multiple centers simultaneously and the differing territorial implications of competing models (e.g., Algaze 2001; Marcus 1998; Spencer 1998; Trig­ger 1993). 
We present new regional settlement pattern and site maps for Monte Negro, and re-evaluate expla­nations for Mixtec urban origins. We argue that Monte Negro arose from a local settlement shift, but emphasize that the site's rapid urbanization

stemmed from interactions involving several cen­ters, including the Zapotec capital at Monte Alban. Mixtec ethnohistorical sources echo these expec­tations, but how well do these accounts inform our understanding of remote prehispanic times? How could Monte Negro's excavated data be conjoined with multiregional settlement patterns, building a model consistent with Mixtec ethnohistory? What does Monte Negro tell us about Oaxaca's urban rev­olution? Oaxaca's first urban societies were recon­stituted on terraced hilltops, with Monte Negro the fossilized remnant of that initial beginning. 
The Mixtec Urbanization 
Scholars define urbanization as increasing settle­ment density and social differentiation that culmi­nates in a new community type (Sanders and Price 1968:46). Conventional notions of urbanism include occupational specialization and intensified production, social stratification and emerging states, along with monumental construction, stan­dardized art styles, and technological innovations such as writing; although the precise constellation of these traits varies in a given setting, their cumu­lative effect is indeed revolutionary (Childe 1950). 
Yet, the crucial, often overlooked component is the regional dimension, with ancient Mexican cities being the primary nodes of regional and even macroregional socioeconomic systems (Blanton 1981; Kowalewski 1990; Marcus l 983b ). 
In the Mixteca Alta, the critical diagnostic fea­ture of the urban transition is the shift to terraced hilltops with subordinate sites below them on the regional level (Spores 1972, l 983b ). Spores (1983b) calls this transition the "Ramos phase urbanization," a period of qualitative change in site location, settlement density, and architectural com­plexity, replicated at Yucuita, Cerro Jazmfn, Huamelulpan, Monte Negro, and their subordi­nates. Mixtec urbanization began during the Monte Alban le phase (Figure 3), or Early Ramos phase in the Mixteca Alta (Balkansky 1998b; Plunket 1983:103; Winter 1994a:Note 1). Monte Alban began conquering sites outside the Valley of Oax­aca during this phase (Spencer and Redmond 2001a), and defensive considerations have been implicated in the origins of Mixtec cities (Balkan­sky 1998b; Winter 1994a). 
MixtecaAlta settlement patterns shifted with the widespread abandonment of earlier villages-the former head towns and their surrounding satellites

coalesced into single urban agglomerations at the 
moment of transition, sometimes called a "syn­
oikism" after the fashion of urban relocation in 
ancient Greece (Demand 1990; cf. Adams' s [1972] 
"urban implosion"). Huamelulpan's synoikism was 
in response to an external threat from Monte Alban 
and other fast-urbanizing Mixtec cities (Balkansky 
1998b). MonteAlban's synoikism could represent 
the confederation of formerly autonomous polities 
(Blanton 1978:35-40; Blanton et al. 1999:63--65), 
or one polity's response to intensified conflict with 
its neighbors (Marcus and Flannery 1996: 139-154 ). 
Historical accounts (Demand 1990) suggest that 
whatever their specific cause, synoikisms occur 
rapidly, often within the lifetime of a single ruler. 
Monte Negro was Oaxaca's premier example of 
a synoikism, its short-lived existence leaving the 
initial urban flashpoint frozen in time. The site was 
qualitatively distinct from all sites that had ever 
existed before in the MixtecaAlta. Monte Negro's 
mountaintop location, dense residential terracing 
and inferred population density, new forms of pub­
lic architecture and scale of monumental con­
struction, and more elaborate forms of elite 
households and segregated residential zones were 
never before in evidence. What was the trigger for 
Monte Negro's urban transformation? How does 
Monte Negro contribute to our understanding of 
broader Mixtec and Oaxaca patterns of urbaniza­
tion? We must first review Monte Negro's exca­
vated data, pertaining to its elite residences, 
temples, burials, and chronology; then tum to recent 
re-evaluations and current knowledge of the wider 
Mixteca Alta before presenting our results. 
Excavations at Monte Negro 1937-1940 
Any discussion of Monte Negro must begin with 
Alfonso Caso and Jorge R. Acosta's initial field 
. research designed to understand that site's rela­

: tionship to Monte Alban and the urban revolution in Oaxaca (Acosta and Romero 1992; Caso 1938, 1942). Monte Negro bore many similarities to Monte Alban, including its mountain setting sur­rounded in terraces and monumental construction. Monte Negro's excavated buildings and chronol­ogy, along with the Caso-Acosta map (Acosta 1965:Figure 27; Acosta and Romero 1992:Figure 9; Marquina 1951:Plate 104) showing the temples and elite residences on the acropolis, were the key results of this project. Caso and Acosta's map, along with excavated data from tombs and offerings, pro­vides evidence of urban planning and social dif­ferentiation at the site. Monte Negro's lesser size and monumentality relative to Monte Alban sug­gested that the site was a developmental interme­diate between the Olmec and other early progenitors ofMesoamerican civilization, and later sites such as Monte Alban and Teotihuacan (Acosta and Romero 1992:157-161). 
Monte Negro's excavated buildings consisted mostly of rectangular platforms arranged around small patios (Acosta 1965; Acosta and Romero 1992:29-72; and see Flannery's [1983a] com­mentary). One set of buildings was aligned along an east-west street over 100 m long; another align­ment of buildings ran north-south, apparently giv­ing the site an L-shaped layout. Monte Negro's largest plaza was surrounded with a temple and low buildings on the east-west street, with the build­ings enclosing an area of about 20 x 20 m (Figure 4). Excavated substructures were made of lime­stone blocks and earthen fill (not exceeding 2 m), often with cylindrical stone column bases that could support perishable roofs. The columns were Monte Negro's most distinctive architectural feature, made of irregular cut stones stacked to form solid cores for cylindrical rubble masonry supports. The restored columns could exceed 3 m in height, and were associated with both elite residences and tem­ples. Stone stairways provided access to adobe or wattle-and-daub structures set atop the platforms. 
Acosta (1965) compared the elite residences to the Roman impluvium, structures with 3 to 4 rooms arranged around small flagstone patios and possi­bly designed to channel rainwater into underground reservoirs. Walls had stone foundations with adobe blocks above; columns supported probable thatched roofs (Acosta and Romero 1992:Figure 24). High-status residences were located near tem­ples, sometimes connected via roofed passages. Household enclosures were private and standard­ized, and their strong spatial association with tem­ples suggests the conjoined civic-religious complexes of later palaces at Monte Alban. Monte Negro's houses were more elegant than earlier excavated examples in Oaxaca, but nonetheless "seem transitional between the house of a chief and the palace of a king" (Marcus and Flannery 1996:168). 
Excavated tombs suggested some degree of

social stratification, with higher-ranked members of society sometimes buried in the temple plat­forms, with numerous ceramic offerings, shell and jade ear ornaments, and annular skull deformations to signify elite status (Acosta and Romero 1992:137-153). Some tombs were made of adobe blocks with stone or wood beams for roofing; other burials were simple pits. We still lack a compara­ble set of excavated household and burial data for residents living outside the monumental precinct. 
Monte Negro's temples varied in size and lay­out, though each was set atop stone platforms with column supports and stairways. They bore certain similarities to more standardized, later versions at Monte Alban. Monte Negro's Temple T (Figure 5) comes closest to Monte Alban's later two-room temples (an institution of statecraft), having a colon­naded entrance and partial division into two rooms (Marcus and Flannery 1996:Figure 185). Flannery (l 983a) notes that the circle-and-triangle motifs carved on Temple T's stairway risers were similar to Monument 3 at San Jose Mogote, connoting blood (and possibly human) sacrifice. What is most striking about Monte Negro's temples, however, is their internal variation-none of the four excavated examples is quite like the others. 
Monte Negro was founded shortly after Monte Alban; its ceramics were similar but not identical and of local manufacture, based on clay composi­tion and other technical differences (Acosta and Romero 1992:76, 159). The ceramic differences and two anomalous radiocarbon dates suggested that Monte Negro might have predated Monte Alban and been the source of Oaxaca's urban civ­ilization (the dates came from Libby-era solid-car­bon methods [see Flannery 1983a]). We know today that Monte Negro's origins date to the sec­ond half of Monte Alban I (e.g., Flannery l 983a; Winter 1989: 116, I 994a:Note I). 
Bernal (1958, 1965) rightly cautioned that Monte Negro's seventh-century B.C. radiocarbon dates were questionable and suggested the site was contemporary with Monte Alban, albeit a provin­cial, somewhat less-developed outlier. Bernal (1965:799) also made a rather prescient observa­tion, noting that Monte Negro and its culture was linked to, but not necessarily derived or imported from, Monte Alban: "there were no basic differ­ences in Monte Alban I between the two main areas of Oaxaca, which later became Zapotec and Mix­tec ... a single culture covered Oaxaca, though at different degrees of intensity." Bernal refers to

material culture, particularly ceramic similarities, but the physical characteristics of excavated buri­als at Monte Negro showed a significant divergence from those of the inhabitants of Monte Alban that was attributed to ethnicity (Acosta and Romero 1992:142, 16l; Romero 1951). MonteNegro's true antecedents remained a mystery, since at the time no contemporary Mixtec or earlier sites were known from Oaxaca. 
Mixtec Urbanization Studies Since the 1960s 
Archaeological research at Monte Negro was begun as a study ofMixtec relationships with Monte Alban. Yet scholars continue to oscillate from autonomous to non-autonomous models, with the underlying 
·issue being contact with Monte Alban. Monte Negro and other Mixtec cities either arose independently (Spores l 983a, I 983b) or were the outcome of Monte Alban conquest or Valley Zapotec migrations into the Mixteca Alta (Byland and Pohl 1994:52­56; Flannery l 983a; Marcus and Flannery 1996:165-169; Plunket 1983:358, 367-368). 
Spores's (1972, 1974a, 1983a, 1983b) "conti­nuity model" is derived from ethnohistorical sources and uses archaeological survey and exca­vation from Yucuita to explain the Mixtec urban­ization. Yucuita was occupied from Early Forma­tive times and regional settlement and ceramic con­tinuities crossed the urban threshold (also Spores 1984:228-229); Monte Alban, in Spores's view, was not a significant factor in Mixtec urbanization. Spores ( 1983a:227) writes, "Mixtec-speaking peo­ples did, however, develop a social system that allowed effective integration of localized clusters of communities and furnished mechanisms whereby territorial boundaries, distance, and even ethnic frontiers could be overridden." 
Mixtec cities arose independently according to Spores, but were linked via noble marital alliances, marketing networks, and sometimes conquest war­fare. Hilltop sites could indicate conflict, but it was not clear who was fighting whom. The resettle­ment on terraced hilltops nonetheless would require a strong ideological component and religious spe­cialists extending their authority into the secular domain. MixtecaAlta settlement patterns were thus composed of clusters of interrelated polities, not single pan-regional centers such as Monte Alban. We will present evidence that a settlement land­scape of conjoined, sometimes conflicting small polities arose together during the initial Mixtec urbanization.

Flannery's (1983a; also Marcus and Flannery 1996: 165-169) "outpost model" argues for Monte Alban expansion into the Mixteca Alta. Flannery (1983a:99) reinterprets the 1930s excavated data from Monte Negro, arguing that the site was "an outpost from the northwesterly expansion of Monte Alban 's influence." Monte Negro and Monte Alban shared certain traits-both were terraced sites on high mountain ridges, both had colonnaded public buildings on stone platforms, both had evidence of militarism and human sacrifice, and both had sim­ilar ceramic inventories. Monte Alban' s larger size and slightly earlier foundation could suggest that causation emanated outward from the Valley of Oaxaca. Other recent views of the Mixtec urban transition mirror these expectations (Byland and Pohl 1994:52-56; Plunket 1983:367-372). 
Monte Negro's architecture and especially tem­ple construction, the evidence for blood sacrifice, and grayware ceramic frequencies could support an argument for Zapotec migration from the Val­ley of Oaxaca to establish the new center. Valley Zapotec colonization was extensive beginning in the le phase (e.g., Balkansky 2002; Marcus and Flannery 1996:195-207; Spencer and Redmond 200 la), including expansion into the mountains north of the Valley of Oaxaca (Drennan 1989) and potentially in the mountainous Pefioles area (Fin­sten 1996). Oaxaca's current multiregional data­base makes the case for Zapotec expansion into outlying regions even stronger than it was twenty years ago (e.g., Balkansky 1998a, 2001). Marcus and Flannery' s ( 1996: 166) restatement of the out­post model operates in this wider empirical con­text: "Monte Negro might, in fact, be a foothold of Zapotec expansion into the mountains beyond the Etla region-an outpost that was later relin­quished." 
Oaxaca's urban revolution was more widespread than Monte Alban alone, a fact evident since Caso' s (1938) intitial work in the Mixteca Alta (also Guzman 1934). Monte Negro arose among multi­ple, contemporary urban centers, confounding our notions of straight-line descent from one source (or their complete autochthony). Specific causal mech­anisms for Mixtec urbanization remain contested, but the recovery of systematic settlement data on its regional and macroregional dimensions has changed the parameters of the discussion. It is from this large-scale perspective that we propose a uni­fied model consistent with the full range of varia­tion in Oaxaca's early cities. 
The Synergism Model 
Monte Negro was but one of several Mixtec urban centers whose shared material similarities and evo­lutionary trajectories far outweighed their differ­ences (that might otherwise be attributed to unique ties with Monte Alban). Yucuita was for several centuries a significant pre-urban head town, and its ongoing local tanware ceramic tradition sug­gested continuity rather than replacement (Spores 1972, 1983b). Cerro Jazmin's initial urbanization was contemporary with Monte Negro andYucuita, and its founding population was derived from nearby valley-floor sites-true for every Mixtec center so far surveyed (Balkansky et al. 2000). Huamelulpan, located 30 km west of the Sierra de Nochixtlan, was too large, too populous, too Mix­tec in its architectural and ceramic traditions, and showed too much continuity with earlier periods to sustain arguments for non-local origins (Balka­nsky 1998b; Gaxiola 1984). Arguments for an external source such as Monte Alban are uncon­vincing when we see these four centers and their satellites developing locally. 
Our "synergism model" of Mixtec urban ori­gins retains compatible elements of the continu­ity and outpost models. Spores's (1972, 1983a, 1983b) continuity model suggests the local-scale processes at work, though it does not explain why urbanization began when it did. Flannery's (1983a) outpost model suggests the large-scale context for the Mixtec urbanization, though its key expectations about the sources of Monte Negro's founding population are not met. Our account dif­fers from other discussions of Oaxacan urbaniza­tion (e.g., Blanton et al. 1999; Joyce and Winter 1996; Marcus and Flannery 1996) in emphasiz­ing co-development and concordant change over a broad macroregion (Balkansky 1999, 2003; Kowalewski 2003; Smith 2002). In this synergis­tic framework, the sources of culture change are multiple and have recursive and self-amplifying evolutionary effects. The test implications are simultaneous settlement shifts and the emergence of new social institutions-and variation in these changes on a time scale that we suspect should be measured in decades not centuries. Variation should occur on site and regional levels as local

populations innovate and adapt to changed cir­cumstances on the macroregional scale. The tim­ing of major transitions should be linked historically. Our model presupposes a multisite and syner­gistic urban transition, with Monte Alban expan­sion the presumed catalyst. Monte Alban's raiding and territorial expansion set off a "chain reaction" (Marcus l 983a:358) causing preexisting chiefdoms and their satellite communities to consolidate into urban centers at Monte Negro and other Mixtec sites (Balkansky 1998a, 1998b). Monte Alban's militaristic expansion had indirect repercussions extending as far as the Tehuacan Valley (Spencer I 979), but not every highland site was conquered, colonized, or co-opted. The settlement pattern evi­dence from the Mixteca Alta involving dozens of hilltop sites suggests that no Mixtec center was conquered or resettled by Zapotecs, especially con­sidering their ceramic and settlement continuities. Monte Negro's size, material culture, and func­tional differences, moreover, put it far outside the range of known Zapotec outposts (e.g., the Quiote­pec fortress [Spencer and Redmond 1997:483-504]). Winter (1994a) also notes the Mixteca Alta's distinct cultural traits, suggesting local development and a Mixtec ethno-linguistic origin for the early cities, although warfare stimu­lated their growth. Monte Negro's excavated data (Acosta and Romero 1992) are best interpreted within the con­text of current regional and macroregional settle­ment patterns (Balkansky 1999; Balkansky et al. 2000), the cumulative results having reinforced Spores's (1972) original arguments for local con­tinuity crossing the urban threshold. Monte Negro's institutional innovations (as seen in architectural plan) were part of a widespread emergent com­
. plexity that cannot be traced to a single site. Alliance 
networks for the arranged marriage of noble chil­dren and for everyday economic exchange (Spores 1974b) would account for the broadly (though not specifically) shared ceramic horizon stretching across highland Oaxaca in Late Formative times. Mixtec political autonomy would not preclude noble intermarriage on the macroregional scale, and such gene flow has been surmised from stud­ies of skeletal morphology (Christensen 1998: 189-237). Monte Negro's rulers, having descended from a preexisting high-ranked Mixtec lineage, would have "stood in a position of recip­rocal dependency with similar elite families located in other centers in the Nochixtlan Valley, in the Mixteca, or conceivably in other areas of Mesoamerica" (Spores 1983b: 123). Militarism among sometimes allied, sometimes competing polities was a component of these alliance net­works and could account for the pervasive settle­ment shift to terraced hilltops under conditions of intensified warfare. 
Oaxacan urbanization was widespread and culminated in the rise of states between 500 and 200 B.C. Explanations for these developments, however, continue to focus on Monte Alban as though it were the only urban center of its time. This approach is no longer defensible empiri­cally since the relevant range of variation in urban forms involves at least a half-dozen interacting sites in highland Oaxaca and might also include sites on the coast (e.g., Joyce et al. 1998; Workinger 2002). The Mixteca Alta, moreover, may have had the highest regional settlement den­sities and population levels in highland Mesoamerica at the time of MonteAlban's foun­dation (Smith 2002:Table 7.1). This single result of the recent surveys forces us to reconsider cur­rent models of Mixtec cultural evolution, all of which presume a lower demographic density and developmental lag vis-a-vis the Valley of Oaxaca. The relevant scale of analysis needed to model Oaxacan urbanization extends beyond the bounds of any single site or region since none alone rep­resents the full range of variation in urban forms at the moment of transition. 
Methods 
Our contribution consists of the regional settlement pattern map, showing Monte Negro's full bound­aries beyond the architectural core and its neigh­boring Ramos phase and antecedent sites; the sketch map for Monte Negro that updates and expands on the original Caso-Acosta map; and ceramic surface collections and dates. The regional settlement pattern map shows Monte Negro and its nearby satellites, and includes sites that pre-dated Monte Negro's urbanization. The site sketch map includes structures shown on the Caso-Acosta map from the 1930s and the several additional structures that we mapped during 1999. The new surface col-

lections and corresponding chronology refer to the entire site area that extends beyond the monumen­tal core. Other recent mapping projects include an air photo tracing as part of a regional survey in the Tilantongo area (Byland and Pohl 1994:52-56, Map 10), and study of Monte Negro's exposed buildings for purposes of historic preservation (van Broekhoven et al. 2000). 
The regional settlement pattern map and other data in this article were the result of a full-cover­age regional survey of 1,343 km2 completed dur­ing 1999 (Balkansky et al. 2000; Kowalewski et al. 1999). The Central Mixteca Alta Settlement Pat­tern Project boundaries adjoined prior surveys (Balkansky l 998b; Byland 1980; Byland and Pohl 1994; Spores 1972; Stiver 2001) such that system­atic settlement patterns in the Mixteca Alta now exceed 3,000 km2 of continuous coverage (Figure 2). Surveying at this scale allows direct compar­isons between Mixtec and Zapotec civilizations from within a single universe of sites. 
Our field methods at Monte Negro and the Tilan­tongo area were the same as in other parts of pro­ject area: multiple survey crews walked field-by-field and hill-by-hill, taking notes and mapping sites as they found them on INEGI 1 :50,000 scale topographic maps. Sites with archi­tecture were drawn to scale using compass, mea­suring tape, and pacing. Our usual procedure was to map the extensive terrace systems at these sites but we were unable to map most of the terraces at Monte Negro; modem farming and erosion has damaged and sometimes removed the prehispanic terraces, thereby limiting the value of terrace-based analyses. We nonetheless noted the extent and con­dition of the remaining terraces, walked the site to its limits, and mapped surviving terraces near the site's architectural core. We used diagnostic surface ceramics for chronological purposes based on the published ceramic classifications for the Valleys of Nochixtlan (Spores 1972) and Oaxaca (Caso et al. 1967; Drennan 1976; Flannery and Marcus 1994), taking representative collections from circum­scribed areas within sites as a check against our field observations. Our research problems were regional in scope, and so our field methods were designed to put Monte Negro and other centers in a settle­ment context of hundreds of sites, and thousands of square kilometers (e.g., Balkansky et al. 2000:Figure 5). 
The Archaeological Settlement Survey 
Pre-Urban Settlement Patterns 
Our regional settlement pattern maps show Monte Negro's local context and its relationship to previ­ous and contemporaneous sites in the Tilantongo area (Figure 6). Late Cruz phase materials were absent at Monte Negro itself, but there were sub­stantial Early and Late Cruz phase occupations on lower hills and the surrounding valley floor-more than enough local occupation to account for Monte Negro's size and population. There were even ear­lier antecedents, in the form of preceramic Archaic sites near Tilantongo (Kowalewski et al. 1999). 
La Providencia was the local center antecedent to Monte Negro; it measured 91.57 ha and was among the largest pre-urban sites in Formative Oax­aca. La Providencia-its dimensions, chronology, and especially its imposing hilltop location-was a complete surprise to us; this site represents an intermediate move to a defensible hilltop that was roughly contemporary with the foundation of Monte Alban. Other Cruz period political centers in the southern Nochixtlan Valley, most notably Etlatongo, resettled on nearby hilltops by the Early Ramos phase (Blomster 1998:636-638; Spores 1983b, 1983c). 
The Tilantongo area capital moved three times during the Formative period, culminating with the foundation of Monte Negro. The Early Cruz cen­ter at Diuxi was 120 m above the valley floor; Late Cruz La Providencia was 220 m above the valley floor; Monte Negro was 500 m above the valley floor, at 2,600 min elevation (Figure 7). The suc­cessive movement of local capitals in the Tilan­tongo area to higher, more defensible terrain could be evidence for the intensification of conflict. We would emphasize that it is no longer tenable to claim that Monte Alban was the first significant hill­top site, and that others followed later. La Provi­dencia and Yucuita were already situated on hilltops and were among the largest sites of their times at the onset of the urban era. 
Diuxi and La Providencia were not the only sig­nificant sites predating Monte Negro in the Tilan­tongo area. Within a 5-km radius of Monte Negro, the total area of all Early Cruz phase sites exceeded 70 ha, with Diuxi itself measuring 49 .52 ha. In the Late Cruz phase, the Tilantongo area occupation

(including La Providencia) totaled 178.57 ha. When we converted these figures to population estimates, we found a tight association between the dispersed Late Cruz phase population and our estimates for Monte Negro's population. 
We used Sanders's (1965:50) 10-25 persons per hectare for "compact low-density villages" (also used for contemporary sites in the Valley of Oax­aca [Blanton et al. 1982]) to estimate Cruz phase populations since Cruz sites were not terraced to the same degree as later sites, and so were less densely occupied. Sites in later time periods such as Ramos typically receive higher population den­sity estimates. The 17 Late Cruz sites within 5 km of Tilantongo totaled 178.57 ha; using a density estimate of 10-25 persons per hectare for pre-urban and rural sites, the population estimate for the Late Cruz phase was an average of3, 125 persons (Table 1). This population estimate was remarkably con­sistent with the independent measures for Monte

Monte Negro's Founding Population 
We do not require external migrations to explain Monte Negro's founding population, its sources being located within the Tilantongo area. But what was the site size and relative density compared to earlier times? Was population growth a cause of the urban transition? How did Monte Negro's demographic parameters compare with its contemporaries? 
We walked Monte Negro's surface-mapping structures, taking ceramic collections, and making notes-and drew its boundaries. Monte Negro's Early Ramos (Monte Alban le phase) size was 
77.76 ha (measured from Arc View), including the continuous occupied area from the architectural core to the surrounding residential terraces (Figure 8). Ancient residential terraces were visible throughout the site, but their original sizes and forms were not always preserved because of mod­ern farming and erosion. Because most of the ancient residential terraces were fragmentary, we chose not to include them in our sketch map or m actual terrace counts for the population estimates 
Monte Negro was further surrounded with the agricultural terracing system called lama-horde (Flannery l 983b; Kirkby 1972; Spores 1969). Thi farming technology is similar to cross-channel 01 gully terraces, but built to an enormous scale. Ter­race walls are made of stone and rebuilt over time with flights of identical terraces descending frorr natural drainages on hillsides and leaving rede­posited soils several meters deep. Mixtec farmer have been building lama-bordo terraces for thou-

sands of years, reclaiming otherwise unproductive land. The expansion of the lama-bordo terrace sys­tem in Ramos times allowed dense urban popula­tions to subsist on marginally productive hilltops. The lama-bordo terraces were not included in the site area or population calculations, because the sur­face data suggested small to nonexistent residential occupations on them-but these features nonethe­less reflected the intensive use of available moun­tainous terrain to support the urban occupation. 
We used two methods in our population esti­mates for Monte Negro that relied on Sanders's ( 1965) methodology for calculating prehispanic populations in the Basin of Mexico (also Blanton et al. 1982; Parsons 1971; Sanders et al. 1979). The first method derived population densities from actual courtyard counts; the second used a standard density measure as applied to the total site size. The latter method used a higher density figure than for the earlier Cruz period. 
Caso and Acosta's map of Monte Negro depicts an area of 4.5 ha in the excavated portion of the site, containing 25-30 courtyard groups consisting of three to four small structures around a small patio or courtyard. Groups of adjacent rooms were sometimes difficult to assign to different courtyard groups, so we calculated population estimates based on minimal and maximal numbers of court­yard groups identified. We considered the courtyard groups to have been residential architecture given the excavation results (Acosta and Romero 1992), their ubiquity across the site, and utilitarian surface artifacts associated with them. Sanders' s ( 1965: 134) estimate of 5-10 persons per courtyard group for Basin of Mexico households gave us a population density of 28-67 persons per hectare that we then applied to Monte Negro for an esti­mated population of 2,100-5 ,200 persons, or roughly 3,700 persons at its midpoint. 
Our second method of calculation involved using the terraced area of the site (although not actual terrace counts) to establish a population

range. Sanders (1965:50) proposed a population density of 25-50 persons per hectare for sites defined as "compact high-density villages," arange that was used for most sites of this period in the Valley of Oaxaca (Blanton et al. 1982: 10-11 ). Sanders' s description fits the density of material and general morphology of Monte Negro, as agricul­tural activity was limited within the residential zone, and at least part of the site was laid out in a grid. Our selection of 25-50 persons per hectare also corresponded to Blanton's (1978:29-30) esti­mate for Monte Alban. Our results using the full terraced area suggest that Monte Negro had 1,900--3,900 persons in residence, or an average population of 2,900. The two methods gave popu­lation ranges that overlapped, and we suggest using the average of the two estimates-3,300 for Monte Negro's peak population-until new data become available (Table 1). 
We also examined the change in regional set­tlement from the Cruz to Ramos phases through quadrat analysis using a Geographic Information System (Perez 2001). The quadrat analysis con­sisted of converting the settlement pattern maps for the entire project area to point distributions where each site was represented by its UTM coordinate. The total surveyed area was then divided into quadrats of various sizes to obtain mean and vari­ance values for each point (measuring patterns of dispersal and clustering); these values, obtained at several scales, were then compared for each chrono­logical period. In the Late Cruz phase, .72 percent of the survey area was occupied; Early Ramos set­tlement covered . 77 percent of the total surveyed area. Thus the total occupied area in our survey zone increased from Cruz to Ramos phases by only .05 percent, revealing the most notable spatial attribute of the Ramos phase urbanization: that regional pop­ulation growth was not the critical element in the urban transition. Ramos urbanization was a change in the morphology of regional settlement into fewer, less clustered, larger sites-it was a rushing inward to the new urban centers. 
Environment and Terraced Fields 
We wanted to evaluate Spores's (1983a:227) argu­ment that the "development of social stratification and the state was neither inevitable nor precluded by the relatively restrictive environment of the Mix­teca." The several small valleys of the Mixteca Alta do not appear at first glance to be conducive to gen­erating surpluses on the scale of the Basin of Mex­ico or Valley of Oaxaca. Mixteca geography thus makes the region an ideal test case for the proposi­tions that environmental constraints and population pressure were causal factors in urbanization (Sanders and Nichols 1988), or led to conquest war­fare and the rise of the state (Carneiro I 970). It would therefore be worth knowing whether Monte Negro could have sustained itself from the resources available in the Tilantongo area and to what degree it needed to intensify production. Burgoa's (1989 [167 4]) quote at the outset of this paper (albeit 2,000 years after the fact) suggests that most farming took place on terraces within the city, not outside it. 
We can measure some of these factors indirectly through studies of agricultural terracing, especially lama-bordo terracing (Spores 1969). These gully terraces are horseshoe-shaped stone walls, designed to catch water and eroding soils in natural drainage channels on hillsides. Monte Negro has several immense lama-bordo terrace systems cascading down the mountainside, physically contiguous with the site boundaries and descending over 500 m to the valley floor. The Valley of Oaxaca "piedmont strategy" (Kowalewski et al. 1989: 124-I 26) was an analogous form of intensification that began in the le phase. Ancient Mixtec farmers intensified agricultural production through terracing, but why? Flannery (1983b:331) suggests, "the lama-bordo system may be another classic example of a labor­intensive system which resulted from, and in tum supported, strongly centralized authority. It is also probably a classic example of the way a relatively small state can intensify the productivity of its immediate sustaining area to the point where it has the manpower needed to exact tribute from weaker neighboring areas." 
We calculated the approximate area of lama­bordo terracing in and around Monte Negro, draw­ing on field observations and aerial photographs. Some of these terraces were still in use in recent decades, but were associated directly with Monte Negro rather than other prehispanic sites and so pre­sumably date from the Early Ramos phase occupa­tion of the city. The terraces chosen for the analysis, moreover, descended from within Monte Negro's site boundaries making a stronger case for dating their construction by association with the site. We found 60 ha of lama-bordo terraces within a 2-km

radius of Monte Negro. Kirkby ( 1972:4 7) estimated 
lama-bordo productivity at 2 tons of maize per 
hectare; thus Monte Negro farmers could have pro­
duced 120 tons of maize annually from these ter­
races. One ton of maize can feed a household of 5 
persons each year (Nicholas 1989), so 120 tons feeds 
about 120 households or 600 persons annually. 
When compared to our prior population esti­
mates, we found that lama-bordo production could 
not have supported the entire population of Monte 
Negro. Another 270 ha of lama-bordo terraces were 
needed to produce enough food for the estimated 
population of3,300. The relatively flat valley-floor 
land around Tilantongo is still farmed today and 
covers an area of 2,500 ha that would represent 
Monte Negro's immediate hinterland. Monte 
Negro's population, in other words, was still depen­
dent on an agriculturally rich hinterland for surplus 
production. All other farming would have occurred 
entirely in the mountains above 2,500 m where 
frost restricts the growing season. 
Monte Negro was short-lived, and given the absence of rural sites in its vicinity, never devel­oped a strong agricultural base in the Tilantongo area or more distant hinterlands from which to pro­duce locally or exact tribute. The urban polities that survived into the next phase integrated larger regional to macro-regional networks of agricultur­ally productive rural settlements. We conclude from these observations that the Mixtec environment was not a limiting factor, since the regional popu­lation was basically the same from Late Cruz to Early Ramos times. Insofar as population pressure was a factor in urbanization, it came after the nucle­ation of multiple dispersed settlements onto ter­raced hilltops. Valley-floor land was still accessible. Intensification through terracing would supplement potential productive shortfalls and fit the defensive . posture of the new cities. Extensive terrace systems would also provide land for farmer-soldiers within the urban setting, consistent with Burgoa's descrip­tion. Monte Negro's rise and demise was deter­mined in the politico-social arena, rather than in its 
local environmental constraints. 
Architecture 
We mapped Monte Negro's architecture with com­pass, tape measure, and pacing, using the Caso­Acosta map (e.g., Acosta 1965:Figure 27) as a starting point, and adding new structures as we found them (Figure 9). All told, we added 29 struc­tures; 4 definable, intact terraces surrounding the monumental core; and 2 plazas, 5 patios, and 7 freestanding walls. We also walked the old foot­path to the site, winding its way uphill from Tilan­tongo, that probably dates from prehispanic times (similar to the roads on Blanton's [1978) topo­graphic map of Monte Alban) and is still used today (Figure 10). It takes the intrepid surveyor about 1.5 hours to reach the summit, and was the main approach to the site prior to the first camino de ter­racer{a built in the 1930s and later improvements that allow vehicular transport. 
We were surprised at the degree of architectural variety over the whole site compared with the exca­vated area alone. Some of the new structures we mapped were larger than the excavated buildings; others had configurations-and presumably func­tions-different from those already reported. Struc­ture 1, for example, was the largest of a four-mound group east of the Temple T complex. Structure 1 measured 33 x 18 x 1 m and supported an addi­tional structure built of stone and earthen fill that measured 8 x 6 x 1 m. The mound group and plaza (35 x 20 m) to which Structure 1 pertained was larger than any single complex shown on the Caso­Acosta map and followed the general architectural alignment of the site. Monte Negro was not in fact L-shaped, an article of faith among Oaxacanists since Marquina's (1951) volume was published. 
We recorded additional structures on residen­tial terraces adjacent to the architectural core. These structures were generally smaller (2 x 4 m to 4 x 8 m) and were considered residential, based on sim­ilarities with excavated structures (Acosta and Romero 1992). Some of the terrace walls near the architectural core were 2 m high, showing the con­siderable labor investment in terrace building and terrain modification apart from the structures them­selves. 
Another important find was the four-mound­and-plaza group located approximately 350 m north of the architectural core. This mound-plaza group did not follow the east-west architectural align­ment of the site. The structures could conceivably date slightly later in time than most of the archi­tectural core and represent the expansion of the site into the multiple-nuclei model of urbanism (Mar­cus 1983b) typical of later Mixtec cities (Balkan­sky 1998b ). These structures were similar to the

four-mound and plaza groups within the monu­mental core. In this instance, the larger east mound (2-m tall) was adjacent to a plaza (20 x 20 m) and lesser structures (.5-1-m tall) that were damaged from plowing. This mound group was located within a zone of ruined residential terraces and Early Ramos phase ceramics. 
Monte Negro's architecture, and the architec­tural precincts at other Early Ramos centers in the Mixteca Alta, departed entirely from Late Cruz monumental building style and site layout. Early Ramos formal architecture had much greater styl­istic and functional variety, with monumental zones that exceeded Late Cruz phase civic-ceremonial precincts: monumental stone staircases, formal streets with aligned buildings suggesting urban planning, greater investment in construction mate­rials and labor, and sites that were fortified with defensive walls and ditches. Late Cruz phase sites with platform mounds in our survey area had only one or two mounds (size range: from 7 x 5 x .5 m to 28 x 25 x 5 m) facing one another across a plaza (size range: from 11 x 11 m to 12 x 24 m). In some cases, terraces and residential occupations sur­rounded the pyramidal architecture, though the monumental area itselfnever exceeded 1400-1500 m2. Monte Negro's ceremonial precinct covered 30,000 m2 (20 times greater than even the largest Late Cruz phase mound/plaza complexes). 
Second-tier sites such as La Calentura and San Jose de Gracia had varied configurations (Figure 11 ); these sites originated in Early Ramos times and had no significant subsequent occupations. First­tier centers such as Cerro Jazmfn and Huamelul­pan (Figure 11) also varied considerably from each another; the original layout of these two sites dates from Early Ramos, though both had later additions increasing the size of certain structures. Aside from the new types of buildings and the greater monu­mental scale in Early Ramos times, we noted that no two Mixtec urban centers looked the same. Monte Negro's excavations identified residential as well as ritual structures in addition to small stair­cases that connected the civic ceremonial area to

the east-west street. Cerro Jazmfn's hilltop had a 
large staircase connecting the civic-ceremonial area 
with the residential terraces below. Huamelulpan 
had two mounds facing an immense plaza on its 
hilltop; another of its salient characteristics was the 
lama-bordo terrace system that began at its very 
center. Yucuita's monumental layout consisted of 
10 dispersed mound-plaza complexes, none of 
which could be defined as central. 
Architectural variability at the Early Ramos 
cities suggests that a uniform architectural tern­. plate had not been established in the Mixteca Alta : (and in fact never would be), and that the new and expanding centers were experimenting with new architectural patterns, and presumably new forms 
of administration. 
Monte Negro 's Ceramics and Chronology 
Monte Negro dates to Monte Alban le, or the Early Ramos phase in the Mixteca Alta (Caso et al. 1967; Spores 1972), with ceramics of this phase cover­ing the full extension of the site (Figures 3 and 12). Monte Negro rose and fell within this narrow time-frame, an episode lasting perhaps one century or less (Drennan 1983). There was also a small N ativi­dad (Postclassic) component within Monte Negro's architectural core, though this later use of the site was probably ritual rather than residential (see below). 
Mixtec tanwares were the predominant ceram­ics on the surface (constituting 75 percent of our opportunistic collection though the actual surface frequency was even higher) and made in the local Tilantongo-area clay body (Acosta and Romero [ 1992:79] report that 85 percent of their excavated ceramics were types we would classify as tan­wares ). Our tanware collections included jars, cucharas (spoons), coma/es (tortilla griddles), and bowls in tanware with red, and sometimes black­on-red painting and incised decoration. Monte Negro's tanwares and red-on-tanwares were con­sistent with the Early Ramos transition. 
There were also grayware and decorated gray­ware ceramics on the surface, usually assumed to have been Valley of Oaxaca imports though no chemical sourcing data exist to evaluate this propo-

Acosta and Romero (1992:76, 159-161) (also 
Caso 1938) dated Monte Negro's ceramics to 
Monte Alban I. Our surface collections and the 
published excavated samples conformed most 
closely to the le phase (that for us would include 
the transitional, seldom-used, and brief lb phase); 
absent was the Period II or Late Ramos phase 
ceramic complex (also see Flannery 1983a; Spores 
1972, l 983b ). The most compelling ceramic diag­
nostics in this regard were the decorated graywares, 
especially the G.12 (combed bottom) and G.17 
(fish plate) varieties that co-occurred with Mixtec 
tanware and red-on-tanware vessels that were 
Cruz/Ramos transitional in composition and form. 
We suspect, therefore, that Monte Negro arose and 
was abandoned within the confines of Middle to 
Late Period I, an inference consistent with the tran­
sitional character of the utilitarian vessel forms and 
local tanware clay body and the decorated gray­
wares. 
We also found a few scattered Natividad (Post­
classic) ceramics on terraces near the monumental 
core of the site: fine cream wares in hemispherical 
bowl and flaring jar forms made in the local, Tilan­
tongo-area clay body (a distinct yellow to yellow­
orange color). We suspect that the Postclassic 
component was not habitational, but rather ritual 
re-use of the site. We would not be surprised if 
prominent individuals from Postclassic Tilantongo 
were sometimes interred within the monumental 
zone at Monte Negro, among other kinds of ritual 
revisits that continue in the present. 
Grayware Ceramic Frequencies 
We remain skeptical that the presence of graywares 
alone indicates Zapotec control of sites in the Mix­
teca Alta. The le phase grayware ceramic horizon 

was widespread in Oaxaca and present in regions . with a variety of relationships with Monte Alban

Excavated elite houses at Huamelulpan had grayware counts that ranged as high as 10-20 percent of the total ceramic inven­tory (Gaxiola l 984:Table 1), comparable to Monte Negro's 14 percent that came from tombs and other offering contexts (Acosta and Romero 1992:75, 79). Huamelulpan and Monte Negro shared in the Mixtec tan ware tradition and had similar grayware frequencies-the ceramic inventories at these two sites were essentially the same. 
Robles's (1988:35-127) ceramic data are the most telling, coming from non-elite domestic con­texts at a site 1.5 km from Yucuita. Robles's hori­zontal excavations at "La Loma" (N 226 in Spores 's [ 1972] survey) yielded grayware frequencies rang­ing from 1.6 to 7. 7 percent of each excavated house, and 5.3 percent of the total ceramic inventory (7 excavated houses and 38,341 classified potsherds). These results are consistent with Spores's (1974a) test excavations at Yucuita and indicate the proba­ble results if excavations were undertaken outside the monumental precinct at Monte Negro. We can­not conclude from these results that graywares (and grayware-bearing peoples) migrated en masse into the Mixteca Alta, or that graywares substituted for the local tanware tradition. Graywares, albeit at low frequencies, were so pervasive that Spores (1972) created a class of "Nochixtlan Valley Gray­ware," present from Early Formative times onward. 
Mixtec graywares in both elite and non-elite excavated contexts differed substantially from Monte Alban and comparable Valley of Oaxaca sites. Monte Alban's Period I tombs and offerings contained 76.5 percent graywares (Caso et al . 1967: 16), this figure representing the complete ves­sels from elite contexts comparable to the Monte Negro excavations. Monte Negro was not unusu­ally rich in graywares (14 percent) compared to other elite contexts at urban centers in the Mixteca Alta, suggesting that its relationship with Monte Alban was not markedly different either. Robles's (1988) ceramic data cast further doubt on wide­spread Zapotec incursions into the Mixteca Alta. 
One further comparison should suffice. The Cuicatlan Canada is the region most often cited as an example of Monte Alban conquest. Spencer and Redmond (1997 :Table 9 .4) report that Feature 4 at the site of La Coyotera (whose solid context and radiocarbon samples date the Zapotec takeover [Spencer and Redmond 200la]) contained 64 per­cent graywares. We would be astonished to find a Mixtec site with grayware frequencies anywhere near this figure. This same feature yielded 26 cream wares, "undeniable imports from the Oaxaca Valley" (Spencer and Redmond 2001a:193). Rob­les (1988), excavating the La Loma site near Yucuita, counted 4 creamwares in nearly 40,000 potsherds. These data notwithstanding, nearly every scholar favoring Monte Alban's heavy influ­ence or occupation of the Mixteca Alta cites the

Monte Negro 's Regional and Macroregional 
Setting 

Monte Negro's foundation meant a change in spe­
cific site location, but not in the total population of 
its home valley (Perez 2001). The total Tilantongo 
area population remained basically unchanged 
from Late Cruz to Early Ramos times, only a greater 
fraction of the regional population resided uphill 
in one site. Monte Negro accounted for 88 percent 
of the local population within 5 km of Tilantongo 
(compared to La Providencia's 51 percent in the 
Late Cruz phase), and a corresponding centraliza­
tion of administrative functions. 
Tidaa was a hilltop terraced site (21.10 ha) with 
public architecture located 10 km north of Monte 
Negro (Figure 6) and may have been its secondary 
center; Tidaa might also have fallen within Cerro 
Jazmin's political sphere or might have been 
autonomous. There were also several smaller sites 
without discernible architecture nearer to Monte 
Negro, indicating a two-tiered settlement hierarchy 
unless one includes Tidaa. Monte Negro's site-level 
administrative complexity thus grew exponentially, 
but was not matched immediately on the regional 
level. 

Outside the Tilantongo area, we see Early Ramos phase cities elsewhere in the Nochixtlan Valley at the rapidly urbanizing centers ofYucuita and Cerro Jazmin. Our survey data suggest that Cerro Jazmin's origins were similar to Monte Negro (Balkansky et al. 2000). Cerro Jazmin was a terraced hilltop site, situated on an imposing mountain ridge overlooking the northwestern cor­ner of the Nochixtlan Valley; its antecedent sites were traceable from Late Cruz phase valley-floor 
. settlements that coalesced on Cerro Jazmin during 
.
· the Early Ramos phase. Cerro Jazmin's site size 
(79.65 ha) and chronology (the urban takeoff begin­ning in the Early Ramos phase) were similar to Monte Negro, though it did not have the same degree of architectural elaboration; it too was aban­doned by the beginning of the Late Ramos phase. Yucuita's urbanization also began in Early Ramos times, but alone among the Nochixtlan Valley cities the site survived this transitional phase and per­sisted for centuries (Plunket 1983; Spores 1972, 1983b). Yucuita's local settlement hierarchy even­tually exceeded that of prior phases, increasing in depth and suggestive of the qualitative changes in regional political administration consistent with state emergence. 
As we look further outward at the archaeologi­cally-known MixtecaAlta, we find other early cities contemporary with Monte Negro. Huamelulpan was founded in Early Ramos times, but located outside the Nochixtlan Valley, 30 km west of Monte Negro. Huamelulpan (Balkansky l 998b; Balkan­sky et al. 2000; Gaxiola 1984) was surrounded with nearby hilltop sites, some of which were possible early competitors. Huamelulpan eventually con­solidated its hinterland; similar to Yucuita, the site continued growing into the Late Ramos phase (exceeding 2 km2 in size), establishing a stable urban and state-level society. Huamelulpan's pub­lic architecture was massive in scale and mirrored in lower-orders of its settlement hierarchy by the le phase/II interface. 
The Mixteca Baja sites ofDiquiyu (Marti 1965) and Cerro de las Minas (Winter 1996) were founded in the Early Ramos/le phase equivalent. Monte Negro and the other neighboring MixtecaAlta set­tlements were part of an extensive network of cen­ters, each spaced roughly 30 km from one another and extending into the Mixteca Baja (see Winter 1989:36-37), suggesting small territorial sizes for these competing polities. We have argued else­where (Balkansky et al. 2000) that the early Mix­tec cities never controlled more than 2,000 km2 of subject territory (and usually much less), owing to intersite competition and shifting alliances as well as the limitations imposed from local geography. Monte Negro's territorial domain never grew beyond its home valley, complicating our expecta­tions about changing administrative complexity and its relationship to territorial expansion. 
On the scale of the southern highlands, Monte Alban and the Valley of Oaxaca comes into play, bringing us to the question ofMixtec/Zapotec inter­action and its relevance to Oaxaca's urban revolu­tion (Figure 13). Monte Alban's estimated population grew threefold in the le phase (Blanton 1978), the same time the site began acquiring ter­ritories outside the Valley of Oaxaca (Spencer and Redmond 200la). The Mixtec urbanization, not coincidentally, began at this time, shown from the several centers including Monte Negro that arose in the Nochixtlan Valley. Huamelulpan and other

hilltop sites were located further west. We cannot view this settlement structure, considering all the foregoing evidence in this paper, as indicating Zapotec migrations into the Mixteca Alta, much less conquest; neither could we support arguments for the complete autochthony of the Mixtec cities. The settlement shift across the highlands was simul­taneous, including Monte Alban's own accelerat­ing urbanization. Oaxaca's urban revolution was at once a local, regional, and macroregional phe­nomenon, and formulations that ignore the exis­tence of multiple interacting but autonomous centers fail to adequately theorize this transforma­tion. 
Monte Negro Reconsidered 
How are we to understand Monte Negro in the con­text of Oaxaca's urban revolution? In the 1930s, Alfonso Caso, Jorge R. Acosta, and their colleagues first observed the ceramic and architectural affini­ties between Monte Negro and Monte Alban (and wondered whether Monte Negro was the source of Oaxaca's urban civilization, rather than the reverse). In recent decades, most subsequent researchers have assumed a causal arrow radiating outward from the Valley of Oaxaca, whether through colo­nization, conquest, or other coercive influence (Byland and Pohl 1994:52-56; Flannery 1983a; Marcus and Flannery 1996: 165-169; Plunket 1983:367-372). Ronald Spores's (1967, 1972, l 983b) counterpoint emphasizes local continuity in the Mixtee sequence and an autochthonous alter­native. Spores's (l 983a) specific model is that polit­ical authority arises from the ritual realm, and that emergent rulers used divine sanction to mobilize resources and encourage dispersed populations to resettle on hilltops. Spores leaves the timing of the Mixtec urbanization unexplained. 
Scholars who attribute the origin ofMixtec cities to outside influences use grayware ceramics as the crucial, sometimes exclusive, evidence (and then cite Monte Alban's conquest of the Cuicatlan Canada). Yet we remain skeptical about the gray­wares and doubt that the Canada is the right anal­ogy. Mixtec-Zapotec ceramic affinities are evident since Early Formative times, long before the estab­lishment of Monte Alban (Balkansky et al. 2000; Spores I 972, l 983c:73; Zarate 1987) and need not signify an intrusive, coercive, or otherwise unequal relationship between these regions. Mixteca Alta excavations suggest that elite contexts contained about 15 percent graywares and non-elite contexts about 5 percent graywares in Ramos times. These grayware frequencies are far below levels found at sites where Zapotec incursions are evident (e.g., Spencer and Redmond 1997). Grayware ceramics must be placed in each region's local context, espe­cially for regions outside zones of outright conquest or colonization where a more complex process and shared highland ceramic tradition is indicated. 
Similar considerations apply to architecture. Monte Negro's newly mapped structures-and incomplete knowledge of Period I architecture at Monte Alban (e.g., Fahmel 1991; Flannery and Marcus 1983; Winter 1994b)-raise doubts that vague architectural affinities signify Zapotec influ­ence over Monte Negro. We might just as reason­ably argue that Monte Negro influenced Monte Alban. Monte Negro's elite residences could be considered the prototype for the Monte Alban II palace (considering the impluvium layout, reduced access, and corridors to public buildings). Monte Negro's temples were similar to later Monte Alban temples, though without the standardized two-room layout. Monte Negro might instead have emulated other polities, though in that case its emulators failed miserably since the architecture at le phase sites varied so substantially. 
Our view is that Monte Negro's and Monte Alban's architectural parallels represent a contin­uous tradition of shared elite political culture rather than the single origin and diffusion of traits. The architecture of Oaxaca's urban tradition cannot be shown to have arisen at a single site and spread out­ward; excavated temples and palaces or proto­palaces arose simultaneously at several sites, evident in the record by the Early Ramos/le phase. The le phase occupation at San Martin Tilcajete in the Valley of Oaxaca (that the excavators argue was a rival polity to Monte Alban) included a "palatial residence" and multiroom temple (Spencer and Redmond 200lb); the palace was similar to later structures at Monte Alban, though the temple had several unusual features compared to later Zapotec temples. Monte Negro's temples (Figures 4, 5, and 9) varied from each other and from the multiroom temple at Tilcajete, and from both earlier and later temples in the Valley of Oaxaca (e.g., Marcus and Flannery 1996:126-128). Mixtec sites, moreover,

differed from one another in architectural compo­sition, suggesting that Monte Alban did not impose a "state sty le" or "conquest template" over the Mix­teca Alta. Instead, Mixtec urbanization was char­acterized by rapid, community-specific social innovations manifest in architecture, and success­ful innovations were shared (but not replicated pre­cisely) over wide areas. 
Monte Alban's militaristic expansion acceler­ated Oaxaca's urban revolution, but expansionism alone does not explain the urban transition in the Mixteca Alta; the shift to hilltop centers and rapid urbanization occurred in several locations, at least within the limits of our current chronological res­olution. Monte Alban colonized vacant regions (e.g., the Sola Valley [Balkansky 2002]) or con­quered low-density regions with specific aims (e.g., the Cuicatlan Canada [Spencer and Redmond 1997]) beginning in the le phase. Other regions such as Ejutla (Feinman and Nicholas 1990) and Miahuatlan (Markman 1981) may have been co­opted by Period II through negotiation and inter­marriage, albeit under military threat. MixtecaAlta settlement patterns, in contrast to each of the afore­mentioned cases, suggest urban trajectories in response to an external threat, with new social insti­tutions evolving in response to changed local cir­cumstances. 
Monte Negro's consolidated Late Cruz phase precursors would account for its population range and site size. Monte Negro's resettlement, more­over, had an intermediate stage on the nearby hill­top of La Providencia (a development concurrent with Monte Alban' s foundation). Monte Negro was larger, and its architecture more complex, than we had realized; the site's entire occupation dated from the Early Ramos or le phase, and these results have implications for models ofits origins. The most par­simonious explanation is that societies in residence since Early Formative times responded to intensi­fied warfare through nucleation of formerly dis­persed local populations. MonteAlban's militarism was the probable external catalyst, but the Mixtec urbanization was a local process of consolidation and institutional innovation-and not the secondary outcome of events occurring elsewhere. 
We have so far avoided the testy issue of state formation, though Oaxaca's urban revolution was tied closely to this process (Blanton et al. 1999; Marcus and Flannery 1996; Spencer and Redmond 2001b). Monte Negro, though without a true palace-if palace is defined as "a monumental building, partly civic and partly residential, whose construction required the same level of corvee labor seen in the public buildings" (Flannery 1983a: 102)-nonetheless had elite residences often connected to public buildings. Monte Negro's high­status households were of a different order than those of earlier times and might constitute an inter­mediate form of palace or could be construed to meet the definition above. Other measures of administrative complexity include the functional variety of building forms (e.g., Flannery and Mar­cus 1976), and Monte Negro would meet most cri­teria for states on that account. 
Monte Negro, with the additional structures recorded in 1999, had greater architectural variety than anticipated; the site's functional differentia­tion was vastly greater than its Late Cruz phase pre­cursors and represented one specific variation on monumental public building found among the early Mixtec cities. Monte Negro's mound-plaza group east of the Temple T complex (Figure 9) was unlike the buildings already excavated, contributing to the functional variation at the site; along with the pos­sible "ball court" whose functions were never defined (Acosta and Romero 1992:49), the range of building forms suggests a qualitative leap in administrative complexity. Even those buildings classified as temples varied considerably. Temple T-North, for example, had several entrances and exits, at least 10 columns, an irregular floor plan, subfloor burial, and was contiguous with another colonnaded elite residence. We are not certain what this structure represents, though we would suggest an administrative function; Acosta and Romero (1992:43) would concur, adding, "we prefer to ask that the reader study [the drawn floor plan] and make their own interpretations" (translation by authors). One could argue that the qualitative change in architectural complexity-and the pres­ence of proto-palaces, temples, numerous unde­fined buildings, and one odd structure that could be a ball court-are sufficient criteria for state insti­tutions. 
We finally rest, however, on the regional settle­ment data showing that Monte Negro's emergent urbanism was not situated within a multitiered set­tlement hierarchy that defines states on the regional level; if anything, the prior Late Cruz phase occu-

pation centered on La Providencia had a more com­plex regional organization. Monte Negro's status as a city-state is also doubtful because the failure to survive its founding period suggests that state­level institutions able to persist over several gen­erations had not solidified. Monte Negro was the quintessential "transitional society" (Marcus and Flannery 1996:157, 160-161), poised on the brink of state formation before falling into ruin. 
Our survey results have brought Monte Negro and its surrounding region into a comprehensive, multivalley perspective, but many questions remain. Excavations in areas outside Monte Negro's monumental precinct would clarify how macroregional interactions affected local develop­ments, including the origins of the Mixtec system of social stratification, and the reasons why most incipient Mixtec cities were abandoned early in their histories. We must also know more about Monte Negro's precursor societies, to understand how extant Mixtec communities could deter out­side powers and create the basis from which polit­ical authority was reconstituted on terraced hilltops at the dawn of the urban era.
