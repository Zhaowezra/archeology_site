AN ALTERNATIVE ORDER: 
THE DUALISTIC ECONOMIES OF THE ANCIENT MAYA 

Vernon L. Scarborough and Fred Valdez, Jr. 
Harkening back to the debates associated with "dualistic economies" in addressing emerging nation states, we examine aspects of the ancient economy of the lowland Maya. Resource-specialized communities were knit together in a network of interdependencies that allowed high degrees of self-sustaininf? separation from the larf?e monumental centers about which we know most. The social and biophysical environs of the ancient Maya permitted multiple economic spheres that influ­enced their political organization and affected their lack of developed hegemonic controls. Evidence is presented from the present-day ecolof?ical set aside of the Programme for Belize in northwestern Belize.

Before leaving El Cayo, I had an argument with Satterthwaite about my plans for subse­quent seasons. I had made up my mind, I said, that I would begin with mapping and excavat­ing at Barton Ramie. Linton thought this was a grave mistake, a setting off down the wrong path in settlement pattern research. If I did that, he warned, I'd be beginning "in the mid­dle of nowhere." The Barton Ramie tiny cer­emonial unit was too small to even qualify as a "minor center." (Gordon Willey 2004) 
ere the ancient lowland Maya organized Waround a single monolithic economic system directed and coordinated by only sizable administrativef'ceremonial" centers or political economic nodes? Is it possible that a more nuanced view of the many and varied "communi­ties" composing the Maya countryside were orga­nized in a manner reflective of their own sociogeographic needs and wishes, rather than those identifiable from the largest "capitals?" 
Although large political and religious centers are the subject of much attention in Maya archaeology and clearly did affect the trajectory of socioeco­nomic and sociopolitical organization, they were not the only landscape adaptations or social units established by lowland settlers. A second funda­mental, although less archaeologically visible, eco­nomic adaptation undergirding greater Maya society was associated with the many small towns and villages detached from the subordinate "sus­taining areas" of the centralizing nodes. In this arti­cle, we examine the complementary but interdependent organization of the many highly integrated networks of communities that functioned both unilaterally and cooperatively with the more conventionally understood support populations in proximity and answerable to the larger centers. By recognizing a multifaceted economic and political interplay, a "dual" or multifaceted economy and political identity is proposed by way of two strate­gies in ordering ancient Maya society.

"Dualistic Economies" 
The notion of dualistic economies was a heuristic device designed to emphasize those economic sys­tems in peripheral settings still outside the orbit of nineteenth-and twentieth-century capitalistic cen­ters, an economic approach challenging the grow­ing reliance on globalistic formalism. J. H. Boeke's (194 2, 1946) work in Indonesia introduced the con­cept, and it afforded considerable interest at the time. Nevertheless, when J. S. Furnivall (1939, 1948) returned to Indonesia a generation later, he concluded that Boeke had been misinformed about an independent economic identity in the hinter­lands in spite of the market principle's subsequent penetration into the entire countryside. 
Scarborough's colleague Barry Isaac (personal communication, 2007) suggests that three condi­tions eroded the concept from current study. First, the weight of the formalist versus substantivist debate in economic anthropology ultimately shifted perceptions toward the view that economies every­where operated on the same principles (Isaac 2005). Rather than move past this divisive contrast and assess economy as a dynamic interaction between groups based on the social relations of production (Halperin 1994, 2007), a version of formalist order implicitly co-opted the social sciences. Aspects of this perspective continue to pervade the inclusive­ness of "world systems" in archaeological circles and lead to a rigidly hierarchical view of ancient society (Algaze 1993; cf. Stein 1999). 
Second, the postmodern critique in some con­texts interpreted "difference" as subordination and "racism" in separating groups by their economic impact on a region or country (Frank 1970). Some of this critique was warranted, but it had the daunt­ing effect of discouraging ethnographic compar­isons or limiting discussion of systematic economic differences across cultures and societies. In an ironic twist of the above noted lumping of economies, aspects of the postmodern view cham­pioned the uniqueness of all cultures and, therefore, their incommensurable attributes when compared to other kinds of rural, community-based ethnog­raphy that might otherwise elucidate the varied but patterned ways by which groups make a living and organize their time and resources. 
Third, "dualistic economies" gradually disap­peared with the near complete penetration of the market economy into all "traditional" economies. Economies formerly positioned outside the colo­nial and postcolonial embrace are now largely absent and prevent the kinds of ethnographies that could elucidate other earlier economic adaptations. These local economic systems once had the poten­tial to explain aspects of successful nonmarket­driven, economic decision making for a world order now affected by overconsumption and environ­mental overexploitation. Given the lack of case studies from the ethnographic record, archaeolog­ical method and theory can help to readdress the concept. 
Near Eastern Pastoralists and 
the Peruvian Vertical Archipelagc,> 

The role of multiple economic pathways within a constellation of nearby and interacting societies is not a new assessment (Scarborough 2000). Gil Stein (2005) has recently reemphasized the numer­ous complementary and competing economic divi­sions within and between archaic states in the Near East. There, as well as in ancient Peru (Murra 1980), the most immediate and separable division is between the sedentary town and city and the archae­ologically "invisible" nomadic pa storalist. The role 
_of animal transhumance was a crucial linkage in knitting together sedentary villages and agricul­tural economies for the first farmer of the Near East (Adams 1978; Hole 1981; cf. Fernea 1970; Sand­ford 1983). We do not have the same catalytic argu­ments for the rise of the various levels of social complexity for early Andean societies (Van Buren 1996), but "vertical archipelago"-like exchange within and between the montana and the coast by way of South American camelid pastoralists is sup­ported ethnographically (Murra 1970; cf. Stanish 2006). In both cases, from separate hemispheres, a dualistic and complementary economy is pro­posed based primarily on significant differences in mobility. Nevertheless, there are other economic divisions in complex society that warrant assessment when pastoralism and animal husbandry are not consid­ered components. Multiple or "dual economies" in the archaeological literature examining the archaic state are not immediately apparent because of the "overpowering" influence of the research strate­gies that focus on the largest centers. Although the

research goals of anthropological archaeology emphasize a holistic assessment of all quarters of society and a representative sample of those set­tlements beyond the surroundings of the largest centers, our logistical and cultural biases empha­size center over periphery. When we are so fortu­nate to survey large tracts of contiguous landscape uninterrupted by dense vegetation or serious degra­dations by modem society, we still seem to assess communities with just one overriding socioeco­nomic and sociopolitical paradigm. Elsewhere, Scarborough (2005a) has alluded to a default bias in settlement and land-use archaeology based on meticulous and systematic survey control that emphasizes hierarchical ordering of communities based on their settlement size and architectural forms. This tendency to place communities in aver­tical set of tiers with each ascending tier reflecting greater degrees of control and coordination over all lesser tiers automatically prevents the development of other models of complexity and interaction. Implicitly, all economic and political interpreta­tions are linked back to the largest and most cen­tralizing nodes-a top-down perspective­frequently addressed as cities (Adams 1981; Blan­ton et al. 1997; Sanders et al. 1979; cf. Lohse and Valdez 2004; Tolstoy 1983). 
Another Set of Methods and Theory 
To analyze and hierarchically model the origins of civilization and the evolution of cities is a laudable endeavor with an illustrious scholarly history among archaeologists from V. Gordon Childe (1950) to Bruce Trigger (2003). But what if we were to examine the development of complex soci­ety from a slightly oblique perspective, one that emphasized interdependencies between commu­nities of similar scales and complexities? This approach is neither top-down nor bottom-up but lat­eral, emphasizing the nuanced relationships between horizontally placed tiers of society. In the Maya Lowlands, our lack of systematic survey con­trol over large swathes of contiguous landscapes has biased our research approach for nearly a century-a completely understandable situation given the harsh ecological conditions. When com­pared to the near-complete survey control found in portions of the semiarid Near East, the Mexican Highlands, or the narrow valley systems of Peru in which vegetation is sparse and there is good visi­bility and preservation, our understanding of the small villages and towns undergirding Maya soci­ety is sorely incomplete. The lack of well-preserved surface debris (frequently hidden in vegetal ground cover), coupled with high rates of organic decay, prevents total surface survey coverage of any region in the Maya Lowlands. Because of these method­ological constraints, we have emphasized a glori­ous history of ancient Maya tombs, palaces, and pyramids from the highly visible architectural cen­ters. We have a much less textured view of the rest of the Maya economy and its associated hinter­lands. 
Nevertheless, our limited survey samples can force us to scrutinize our data under a different set of analytical lenses. By focusing survey and exca­vation efforts far from the large centers and attempt­ing to compare and contrast small communities­frequentl y identifiable by only minimal public architecture-with their immediate resources and environments, a different view of Maya socioeco­nomic and sociopolitical organization emerges. Conventional practice routinely places survey tran­sects so that they lead away from one large center or link two or more sizable Maya centers. This is an attempt to identify population density drop-off gradients-assuming that all inhabitants between centers are allied in various degrees of subservience to one center or another (Ford 1986; Hageman and Lohse 2003; Puleston 1983; Ricketson and Rick­etson 1937; cf. Ashmore et al. 2004; Deevey et al. 1979). Given the logistical difficulties in jungle ecology survey, this methodological strategy has allowed some comparisons with those more com­plete surveys found in the aforementioned semi­arid settings of the world. Although only linear spokes of a wheel leading out from a set of large sites, the several transects now mapped within the Maya Lowlands (Culbert and Rice 1990) identify enough settlement variability to permit compar­isons to other regions of the world where the archaic state arose. What emerges from Maya studies is an attempt to fit our interpretations into the same hier­archical structure of early state established for other regions globally. 
In the Near East, the early decipherment of cuneiform in connection with the excavation of the largest cities resulted in a highly hegemonic view of society (Oppenheim 1977; Postgate 1992). Some

of the earliest and most complete regional surveys were also conducted along the lower reaches of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers and adjacent drainages of Iraq and southwestern Iran, and the models of social complexity continued to emphasize state­level hierarchy (Adams 1965, 1981; Adams and Nissen 1972; Neely and Wright 1994; Wright and Johnson 1975). In the New World, a similar search for state origins was stimulated by Willey's ground­breaking settlement surveys first in the Viru Valley, Peru (1953) and subsequently in the Belize Valley, Belize (Willey et al. 1965). The Belize Valley sur­vey and excavations were especially innovative because the transect survey was a ribbon of settle­ment tethered to the abundance of the river and not originating from a large center with those many hierarchical implications (see epigraph). Never­theless, as was the case with archaeological enquiry elsewhere (Trigger 1989; Willey and Sabloff 1993), early site-centered excavation drove Maya archae­ology. Some archaeologists suggested that the Maya were incapable of statecraft (Meggers 1954 ), whereas others suggested that Maya settlements were a constellation of lesser level chiefdoms (Sanders and Webster 1978). These interpretations were seriously flawed as research in both center and periphery demonstrates social complexity and statecraft (Sharer and Traxler 2006). What the his­tory of Maya archaeology affords, however, is an opportunity to now chart a different course for inter­preting Maya social structures, a path that other parts of the world may wish to emulate, rather than 
redeploy the same "city-centric" associations. 
Maya Settlement and Land-Use Models 
The ancient Maya practiced a highly dispersed set­tlement design making arguments for a controlled subservient labor force by a hegemonic elite less tenable than characterized by several other early experiments in state-level social complexity (Scar­borough 2003, 2005b; cf. Stein 2005). Clearly, some sizable centers like Tikal and Calakmul were controlling centers with large support populations subordinated to governing elite. Nevertheless, much of the Maya area was relatively densely set­tled outside the coercive sphere of the large cen­ters, sometimes as densely occupied as the central nodes themselves (Lohse and Valdez 2004; cf. Cul­bert and Rice 1990). 
One recurrent model of social and political organization for the Maya area proposes the seg­mentary state (Ball and Taschek 1991; Sanders and Webster 1988; Taschek and Ball 1999; after Southall 1988; cf. Fox 1977) in which centers were supported by a set of redundant almost clone­like towns and villages, each community and polity a mirror image of its parent center or polity from which it separated years before. These descendant communities functioned identical to Marx's much earlier notion of the Asiatic Mode of Production-a highly Eurocentric assessment oflndia and China (Isaac 1993 ). His Asiatic Mode of Production suggested that Asia was without significant history because of his perception that a complicated urban-built environment was absent-history only a manifestation of the built environment (Sinopoli 2005). Marx championed the position that once a village reached a popula­tion size that overreached its local resources, it reproduced itself in an identical manner to its par­ent village. History, then, was uniformly homog­enized with little hope for truly complex or social evolved institutions-and the same can be said of the segmentary state model. 
Clearly, the Maya were more than a segmented continuum of villages and towns identical to one another and attached to a defining major center or urban node (Chase and Chase 1996; Fox et al. 1996; Marcus 1993, 1995). Nevertheless, conventional wisdom continues to see the rural hinterlands of the Maya Lowlands composed of autonomous com­munities operating as insular and presumably sub­ordinate entities, generally speaking, independent and self-sufficient unto themselves until labor or tribute to the great centers was demanded (Sprajc 2005). Part of this interpretation is based on Eric Wolf's (1955, but cf. 1986) influential notion of the "closed corporate community" known from post­colonial Highland Guatemala. However, Wolf's work captured the ethnographic present and the legacy of the Colonial embrace, not necessarily the character of socioeconomic and sociopolitical order during the Classic Period. 
What has evolved in our discipline is an implicit view of the Maya as a top-down political economy directed by a literate elite living in the largest cen­ters and commanding the livelihoods of a huge undifferentiated hoi polloi scattered among the interstices of all other large centers. But does a

complex society anywhere really function in this manner (cf. Yoffee 2005), especially one occupy­ing a set of diverse environments associated with constraining ecologies (Scarborough and Burnside 2008)? A conventional model for ancient Maya society continues to suggest that autonomous vil­lage economies littered the landscape (Dunning et al. 2003; Lucero 2006; Tourtellot et al. 2003); they were insular communities but diversified produc­tion within their limited and constrained environ­ment to reduce risk and generate enough of everything to buffer them from starvation. This per­vasive model accommodates the strict application of hierarchical/hegemonic societal organization because small subordinate communities are implic­itly viewed as without significant history, cloned from near identical parent villages and towns; vil­lages that were dependent on the political and social largesse of the highly centralized and ordered "cities." However, the environmental parameters for a semitropical setting, one shown to be fragile, unpredictable, and frequently inhospitable, suggest an evolving set of interdependencies based on regional community networks (Scarborough 2005b; 2008; Scarborough and Burnside 2008; cf. Aylesworth 2005). These social, political, and eco­nomic networks (cf. Barabasi 2002) based on small community-level nodes provided the flexibility necessary to adapt rapidly to changing social and physical environments apparent in the dynamic ecological settings of the semitropical world. 

A Subsistence Economy 
Maya economy and political organization were more diverse than presently assumed. When long­term research invests in large contiguous survey tracts, like that now being undertaken in the Belize Valley (Garber 2004; cf. Iannone and Connell 2003; after Willey et al. 1965) and in the Three Rivers Region of the east-central Yucatan Peninsula (Gud­erjan 2007; Scarborough et al. 2003; Valdez 2005, 2006), a very different interpretation of the past unfolds-outside the current disciplinary percep­tion of an only slightly exaggerated Foucauldian panopticon of control by hegemonic Maya centers. Professional consensus continues to emphasize the kingly ideal based on the monumentality of archi­tecture and an epigraphic record biased by eco­nomically self-interested and politically insecure scribal elite from the largest centers (cf. Sharer and Traxler 2006). 
The view from the greater engineered landscape beyond the major centers emphasizes a subsistence economy based on a network of interdependent exchanges consisting of both material goods and 
the associated information afforded these preserved materials. In this context, the subsistence economy is more than the what, when, and where of pro­duction; it is the dynamics of how production, dis­tribution, and consumption differ from traditional views of the political economy (Scarborough et al. 2003). 
Elsewhere, we (Scarborough and Valdez 2003) have proposed that the Maya were frequently orga­nized into settlement and economic units of "resource-specialized communities" (Figure 1 ). These communities were highly interdependent and grounded on the economic benefits of unique sets of goods and services differentiating one com­munity from another. By combining the variety and abundance of specialized production from the indi­vidual communities at a marketplace that coordi­nated the timing and labor for organizing the required exchange, a greater region of communi­ties obtained the necessary balance of resources for a sustainable harvesting of an otherwise fragile environment (Scarborough 2005b). Unlike classic views of the political economy in which the elite governors control production schedules and coerce and cajole laborers to comply with work demands, a much more flexible heterarchical order between communities is envisioned. 
The resource-specialized community model aids in explaining how semitropical environments can be used to best marshal highly dispersed resources and the human populations dependent on them in arriving at complex social systems. The Maya Lowlands are known for their abundance of diverse life forms. Nevertheless, the number of any species in any one patch or microenvironment is limited when compared to the vast herds of spe­cific ungulate species or the limited varieties of grasses growing redundantly in large field tracts of more temperate and semiarid environments. The semitropical wet-dry forests and savannas of Cen­tral America structure a dispersed settlement design that mimics aspects of the natural ecology. When coupled with highly seasonal rainfall fol­lowed by four months of droughtlike conditions

and a karstic bedrock that prevents significant sur­face drainage, making a living in the Maya Low­lands proved challenging. Because storage of food in the humid tropics was always a difficult under­taking with a high incidence of rapidly growing disease vectors-frequently waterborne­communities self-organized within and among themselves to best cope with these deranging forces (Scarborough et al. 1999; Scarborough et al. 2003; Scarborough and Burnside 2008). One strategy was to move harvested foods quickly to consumers for exchange and consumption. Because of the dispersed character of communi­ties one from another, roads and pathways were highly developed (Shaw 2001, 2008; cf. Cheetham 2004; Trombold 1991). Perhaps more important was the establishment of elaborate although flex­ible time tables for anticipating harvesting sched­ules and the rapid movement of food and related items to receptive marketplaces. This is not to say that long-term storage advances were not made (cf. Smyth 1990), for example the role of salt produc­tion for preserving organic comestibles appears widespread (Andrews 1983; Mc Kill op 2002; Valdez and Mock 1991). Nevertheless, a struc­tured set of schedules operating at more mundane levels than the calendar round is strongly implied (Scarborough 2005b, 2008; Scarborough and Burnside 2008). 
Within this socioeconomic and ecological set­ting, it is difficult to imagine the singularity of a steeply pitched hierarchical political order sup­ported by independent or autonomous farming vil­lages answerable to hegemonic centers. This is not to say that some of the large centers were unable to amass strong support from their immediate sus­taining areas, rather villages in their orbit were fre­quently subordinated and compelled to offer tribute and other kinds of support. Nevertheless, many communities operated outside the bonds to a spe­cific center and secured their economic well-being by routinely interacting with other small neigh­boring communities. To say that these interdepen­dent communities were outside the sphere of the large commanding centers and operated separately from them would be a simplification. Surely they were aware of the wishes and activities emanating from the sizable centers. Nevertheless, heterarchi­cal socioeconomic and sociopolitical relationships connected many small communities away from the

Programme for Belize 
Over the last 15 years, an uninterrupted set of archaeological survey and excavation projects have operated in the 1,000 km2 ecological set aside know as the Programme for Belize, located within the greater Three Rivers Region of northwestern Belize (Adams et al. 2004; Hammond et al. 1998; Ham­mond et al. 2000; Scarborough et al., eds. 2003; Tourtellot et al. 2003; Tourtellot and Hammond 1993; Valdez 2005, 2006) (Figure 2). Together with several other projects in the immediate vicinity (Beach et al. 2002; Guderjan 2007; Guderjan et al. 2003; Houk 1998, 2000; Lohse et al. 2005), long­term investigations have yielded abundant infor­mation about occupation and land use of this region from the Middle Preclassic (600 B.C.-400 B.C.) to the Late Classic periods (A.D. 650--A.D. 900). Within this tract, special attention has been given to small sites or communities and their relationship to the environment. Three well-defined topographic settings reveal in microcosm much of the overall variability found elsewhere in the Maya Lowlands

(cf. Dunning et al. 2003) (Figure 3). The low-lying meanderings of the Rio Bravo and Booth's River are associated with hummocky terrain and shallow relief frequently covered by large patches of dense swamplike vegetation. Ancient settlement tends to cluster around a few elevated limestone ridges or hillocks with several of the largest centralizing nodes in northern Belize identifiable. 
The uplands to the west of the riverine setting are consistently identified by high forest, rolling karstic terrain and several very large urban com­munities, perhaps the largest being the well-known site of La Mil pa (Hammond et al. 2000; Tourtellot et al. 2003), occupying the summits of elevated hillocks. Nevertheless, much of the terrain is low­lying bajo, or seasonally inundated, closed basin swamp, like that elsewhere on the same shared Peten plateau into adjacent Guatemala (Kunen 2004). 
At the interface separating the riverine lowlands and the upland plateau is a 100 m high escarpment of rugged, drainage-incised, karstic exposure (Fig­ure 2). This north-south trending ribbon ofland rep­resents horst and graben activity during the Pliocene (Dunning et al. 2003). An outer eastern arm of the exposure immediately above the south­ern portions of the Rio Bravo is the Rio Bravo Escarpment. Merging with the Rio Bravo Escarp­ment to the north-but separated from it to the south-is the more interior Lalucha Escarpment. Together, they comprise some of the most rugged terrain over a relatively short distance in the Maya Lowlands. Settlement and land-use alterations tend to be dense, continuous through time, and associ­ated with many varied land-and water-management features. 
These latter communities and their land-and water-use practices are of particular interest given their distance from the grand centers whether above into the interior of the Peten Plateau or below within the Booth and Bravo riverine reaches. Although several survey and excavation samples have been systematically retrieved from within each of the environments identified (Hageman and Lohse 2003; Lohse 200 l; Sunahara and Meadows 2005; Tourtellot et al. 2003), they remain limited given the region's size and visibility difficulties resulting from the dense vegetation. Nevertheless, Hage­man's (Hageman and Lohse 2003) intersite tran­sect connecting the large riverine center of Dos Hombres to the elevated plateau center of La Mil pa indicates that the easternmost Rio Bravo escarp­ment tends to be the more rugged and precipitous of the two diverging escarpment edges (Figures 2 and 3). Few colonized residential sites are identi­fiable, but this former escarpment does have a high incidence of artificial terracing along its steeply incised drainages. The Barba Group, a small but artifact-rich community, is an exception lying atop an elevated spur overlooking several ancient agri­cultural terraces in this rugged terrain (Hageman and Lohse 2003). However, the nearby and parallel­running Lalucha escarpment consists of broad, steplike shelves climbing from the riverine zone and portions of the adjacent Rio Bravo escarpment onto the Peten Plateau (Sunahara and Meadows 2005). Generally, there are larger sections of horizontally bedded, limestone bedrock allowing for a greater incidence of small habitation sites when compared to the Rio Bravo escarpment exposure. 
The greatest density of small communities occurs along the elevated edges of the escarpments.

These communities are sometimes identifiable by a small pyramidal structure in their ill-defined and diminutive central precincts, but just as frequently they are without significant monumental architec­ture (Hageman and Lohse 2003; Kunen and Hugh­banks 2003; Walling et al. 2005). Nevertheless, these communities are separated from one another by distances on the order of 2-5 km and associated with several courtyards and adjacent platforms that identify a site center, sometimes with terraced fields within and surrounding the diminutive central precinct (Femand 2002; O'Neal 1999). They do not appear tethered or in immediate proximity to the sustaining populations found surrounding the truly large centers associated with either the Peten Plateau or the low-lying riverine environments (contra Tourtellot et al. 2003; Tourtellot et al. 2005). 
Given the size and abundance of these small communities occupying this transitional topo­graphic and environmental zone, disconnected from the ambiente of the grand monumental cen­ters, what are these settlements telling us about Maya socioeconomic and sociopolitical organiza­tion? We propose that another set of interactions were in place between these escarpment edge com­munities different from those satellite communi­ties and households geographically positioned in a more dependent relationship to the large adminis­trative/ceremonial centers. We further posit that our attention in the Maya area is explicitly and implic­itly affected by a centric view of social organiza­tion, a condition of site survey and exploration dictated by the highly visible architecture encoun­tered in. an environment of otherwise green obscu­ration. Nevertheless, by carefully excavating several of the less architecturally prominent com­munities outside the radius of the large centers, a different view of the Maya emerges. 
Ecologically, the significance of the escarpment edge and its overall ruggedness is its "naturally" disturbed environmental associations. Denevan (2001) emphasizes the role of early sedentary pop­ulations located throughout greater Amazonia prior to Spanish and Portuguese entradas; communities frequently positioned at the edge or elevated mar­gins of a bluff or escarpment. Archaeologically, the incidence of Amazonian "terra preta" soils is high­est at these localities, indicative of complicated organizational adaptations based on long-term physical attachments to the elevated settings and the recurrent exploitation of nearby riverine resources from these sites. These sites are posi­tioned to harvest high-forest products from the ele­vated reaches of the bluff tops and adjacent plateau interiors (cf. Erickson 2003). Elsewhere, these topographic "breaks" or naturally disturbed habi­tats or patches within semitropical environs are posited to have been zones for domestic experi­mentation with cultivators coaxed in some instances toward the early domestication of some plant varieties (Groube 1989; cf. Pipemo and Pearsall 1998). Regardless, disturbed zones like those identifiable along the Lalucha and Rio Bravo Escarpments were colonized early and accretion­ally expanded without great investments in archi­tecture. Our excavation data from the many communities along the escarpment's elevated edge suggest continuous occupation beginning in the Middle Preclassic period (Sullivan and Sagabiel 2003). By the Late Preclassic period (400 B.C.-A.D. 200), artifactual and settlement indica­tors suggest considerable and stable occupation with only slight evidence for monumental archi­tecture (Hyde 2005). We do not know the extent of terrace field construction at this time (cf. Dunning et al. 2003), but a Late Preclassic period inventory of ceramics has been retrieved routinely from these 

surfaces. 
As Denevan (1992, 2001) forcefully discusses for South America, the amount of work associated with cutting down tropical trees employing a stone­age technology is substantial. For the largest trees, it requires 60 times more effort to chop down one of these behemoths with a stone ax than it does with a steel edge (Hill and Kaplan 1989:331). Ethno­graphically, some farmers incrementally expanded their swidden plots by selecting those patches of forest connected in their upper canopies by an "unbreakable network of creepers" and allowing for as many of these recalcitrant hardwoods to fall with the felling of one or two giants (Up de Graff 1923; see Denevan 2001:118-119). When the pro­cedure worked, the long-lived swidden patch was slowly increased in area. If coupled with a dis­turbed and less resistant opportunistic growth of an escarpment edge, contiguous lateral landscape exposure would permit larger settlements and more potential for agricultural plots. 
Although swidden fields imply impermanence and the eventual relocation of farming activities to

another area, recent reassessments of historical and contemporary swidden activity suggest that it is only realistically accomplished with the advent of steel machetes and axes. Following Denevan's lead from Amazonia, Doolittle (2000: 17 4-190) makes the convincing argument that North American indigenous populations seldom employed slash­and-bum agriculture. 
The overwhelming corpus of evidence indi­cates clearly and convincingly that although native North Americans cleared the forest by slashing-and-burning, they did so for perma­nent clearance. Cultivation typically involved little, if any, field rotation; perhaps biennial fallowing but rarely, if ever, regular shifting of fields to new locations. The notion of swidden should perhaps be more appropriately labeled a myth. (Doolittle 2000: 190) 
The implications of both Denevan' s and Doolittle's insights have significant consequences for assess­ing the size and structure of ancient Maya settle­ment. Once a set of communities invested in place and the socioeconomic and sociopolitical interde­pendencies implied, they were unlikely to easily subordinate or relocate regardless of external pres­sures from large centers several kilometers away (cf. Gilman 1981). 
In the Programme for Belize tract, the naturally disturbed environs of the escarpment made several resources more abundant initially than in the expan­sive primary forest zones associated with areas either above or below it (see Guderjan 2007). This is not to say that colonizing Preclassic populations were restricted to escarpment margins, as we have ample evidence that bajo-margins and adjacent shallow lakes (Dunning et al. 2002; Hansen et al. 2002; Jacob 1995; cf. Kunen 2004) were attractive settlement zones perhaps equally disturbed and abundant in resources. In fact, geographical prox­imity to bajo-margin zones became especially attractive with the advent of Classic period popu­lation spikes and the increased number of large centers, a settlement adaptation initiated by the Late Preclassic period in the northern Peten with the grand florescence of El Mirador (Hansen et al. 2002; Matheny 1987; cf. Scarborough 2007). Nev­ertheless, Preclassic period occupation in the Three Rivers Region is posited not to have warranted the same kind of center aggregation given the limita­tion of resources (i.e., lack of bajo-margin rich and aggraded sediments precipitated from elevated and adjacent erosive construction projects) and the social exchange networks that evolved in the con­text of the escarpment edge. 
By the Classic period, an investment in place along the Three Rivers escarpment edge was unin­terrupted by communities in close proximity to one another. Civic architecture, although diminutive, was constructed to define the center of some com­munities. Small pyramids and range structures appear in several small communities, communities linked to one another but not dependent on the truly huge Maya centers developing elsewhere (Scar­borough et al. 2003; cf. Iannone and Connell 2003). 
In one case, a small resource specialized com­munity invested in numerous runoff water basins by engineering the naturally sloping, escarpment margins (Walling et al. 2005, 2006) (Figures 2 and 4). Chawak But'o'ob is typical of many of the small, architecturally ill-defined communities except that it has a sophisticated ballcourt con­struction at its southernmost margins, a ballcourt comparable in size and form to any found elsewhere in the Three Rivers Region (Walling et al. 2005, 2006) (Figure 5). Chawak But'o'ob has no other civic construction and only modest house platforms and nondescript courtyards. Given the absence of another ballcourt along the escarpment edge, we interpret the Chawak But'o'ob as the ballgame locus for an extensive constellation of small com­munities linked by several economic and political interdependencies. Although Chawak But'o'ob obtained adequate potable water from both its water basins and proximity to the Rio Bravo, another resource-specialized community (Grupo Agua Llu­via) acquired its water from a large tank (Trach­man 2007) (Figures 2 and 6). Because Grupo Agua Lluvia was a community of five structures, its 72 m3 capacity tank-with a dedicatory plate interred under its intake channel-was a construction and maintenance investment many times greater than its community size warranted.1 Here, the tank func­tioned to provide at least one neighboring com­munity with a dry season water supply that the residents of Grupo Agua Lluvia themselves could never consume. 
Medicinal Trail site located on the escarpment edge is another example of a resource-specialized community found with a very large reservoir

(Chmilar 2005; Hyde et al. 2006) (Figures 2 and 7). The entire extent of the community remains unclear, but survey and excavation data suggest a community much larger than either of the two men­tioned above. Nevertheless, the capacity of the tank, 785 m3, suggests community access beyond the reaches of the community itself. 2 Water is at a pre­mium at the elevated margins of the escarpment; and a centralizing resource the size of this tank would likely draw intercommunity members together during the dry season, if not throughout the year (Scarborough 1998; cf. Vogt 1968). 
Other communities are posited to have staged opportunities for social interaction and economic integration by emphasizing the production of arti­factual or food specialties, for example the pro­duction and exchange of particular kinds of pottery for both functional and stylistic ends (Sullivan and Sagabiel 2003 ), flint quarrying and knapping exper­tise (Hyde et al. 2006; Lewis 2003; Tovar 1996), varieties of maize or the harvesting of rare forest crops obtained from controlled, otherwise fragile microenvirons in proximity to a few communities (Hageman 2006), and perhaps cotton and textile production (cf. Puleston 1977). By the Late Clas­sic period, maize was the dominant staple, sug­gesting larger, more open mi/pas (field plots) than apparent during the Preclassic period colonization of the region; Classic period field systems fre­quently intensified production through ditched and raised fields as well as terrace constructions (Beach et al. 2002; Berry and McAnany 2007; Dunning et al. 2003). 
All these strategies for specialization permitted the social and economic interplay necessary for long-term bonding between communities. These practical economic ends were complemented by numerous ritual occasions, which communities organized in their own way to further bind the com­plex network of interdependencies connecting towns and villages separate from the large center order. In the case of Chawak But' o' ob, the institu­tion of the ballgame-frequently associated with the great centers-was employed along the Lalucha escarpment edge. The identification of a ballcourt at the margins of a very small community away from any other formal civic architecture empha­sizes the divisions between the dual economy; the grand centers associated with a century of excava­tion and survey, and those distant villages outside

the powerful shadows of the great "cities" identi­fied by activities uniting a large number of heter­archically organized communities into less dramatic but comparable composite wholes.3 
The recently identified small, rural escarpment­margin site of Quincunx and its diminutive solar observatory identified immediately southwest of the nearby minor center of Blue Creek (Zaro and Lohse 2005) (Figure 2) further suggests the unify­ing force of ideology away from the largest cen­ters and their architecturally commanding, astro­nomical E-Groups (Sharer and Traxler 2006). Given the abundance of E-Group solar observa­tional layouts at mid-to-large centers throughout the Maya Lowlands, how do we explain the diminu­tive structure at the small rural community of Quin­cunx? We suggest that it represents the kind of integrative feature that heterarchically aligned,

small communities required in uniting their sociopolitical and socioeconomic ends away from the great centers. Like the ballcourt at Chawak But'o'ob, this diminutive solar observatory func­tioned to periodically unify small agricultural com­munities around their agricultural calendar and bring immediate attention to the specific location of Quincunx (cf. Scarborough and Wilcox 1991). The upsurge of archaeological work over the last 
two decades in the Belize Valley (Garber 2004) provides a complementary set of regionwide data that contrasts with centric views of a single large center. This work is more in line with the "natural" consequences of an ecologically disturbed riverine environment. Although research along this ribbon­strip corridor continues to be interpreted by way of hierarchical-dependency models (Iannone 2004; Taschek and Ball 2004 ), the absence of a truly huge

center in a valley (cf. Chase 2004) with a history of settlement pattern research tethered to the mean­ders of the Belize, Mopan, and Macal drainage sys­tem allows for other interpretations. The recent documentation of a ballcourt at the very small site of Ontario between two small "major" centers has been interpreted as evidence of a buffer-zone com­munity (Driver and Garber 2004 ). Although Ontario has considerably more architecture (although still diminutive) than apparent at Chawak But' o' ob of the Programme for Belize escarpment edge, the former may have functioned in a manner not unlike the latter. Communities the size of Ontario are widespread throughout the Belize Val­ley and may have operated without the hypothe­sized dependency relationships to neighboring larger centers. 
Offerings Versus Tribute 
The entrenched view that the ancient economy is a one-dimensional model for explaining the liveli­hoods of societies permits a tidy approach to orga­nizing survey data and identifying social complexity through time. Hierarchical relation­ships encompass both top-down and bottom-up interpretations of the social order and establish dependency relationships based on ranked tiers of material remains and inferred levels social stratifi­cation. Sophisticated access to increasing amounts of meaningful information is acquired and distrib­uted up and down the socioeconomic and sociopo­litical pyramid providing one definition of social complexity (Scarborough and Burnside 2008). Refined resources are concentrated in increasingly greater quantities and qualities as the hierarchical system is ascended. 
Complementing this economic model is the view that settlement and land use mimic the same type of economic and political hierarchy outlined above with communities of diminutive size and architectural investment subordinate to those of grander scale. We posit another approach inclusive of this conventional wisdom, and suggest a broad­based socioeconomic and sociopolitical linkage among small communities that play a dominant role in organizing the economy. Here, we have revisited the notion of a dual economy derived from the archaeological record. 
The "tribute economy" (after Wolf 1982:71-77) 
has been presented as the principal vehicle orga­nizing ancient states. In terms of standard defini­tions of the political economy, this remains a highly useful way to characterize aspects of the archaic state. Nevertheless, it glosses over the multifaceted function of the economy in that many small com­munities can easily resist participation in its hier­archical order, especially those societies with highly dispersed and environmentally "hidden" population aggregates like the ancient Maya. Under these latter circumstances, communities band together into fluid economic networks through time and space. Relationships are less con­strained by a tribute mode of production and more by an "offering mode of production"4 in the absence of significant wealth differences or local stratification. Drawing from a heterarchical bottom-up and lateral perspective, the institutional principle is network cooperation and participation among resource-specialized communities. In some cases, small-and medium-sized civic centers coor­dinated activities from their periodic marketplaces for the circulation and redistribution of raw and refined resources acquired and produced in the 
small villages and towns. 
Nevertheless, the dualistic economy is primar­ily based on the proximity of a sizable constella­tion of small communities that play their own ballgames and honor their own agricultural rituals detached from the formalized marketplace centers. They interact with one another under the shadows of the largest centers and participate in the latter's grand activities through negotiation, rather than coercion. Other populations within the immediate orbit of the largest civic centers are attached to the highly "visible" political economy as identified by the tribute mode of production, but even these pop­ulations have latitude in defining their own eco­nomic well-being. 
Joyce Marcus's (1993, 1998) important set of articles articulating the "dynamic model" for the rise and fall of cities and their regional sustaining population best captures the variability apparent in our data set. From the Late Preclassic period to the Posclassic period (A.D. 900--A.D. 1500), Maya "kingdoms" cycled in and out of interregional con­trol. A dualistic economy aids in understanding this dynamic because it shows how a resilient hinter­land population negotiates its livelihood in a detached manner away from the great "cities."

Because resource-specialized communities can together sustain themselves, their negotiated sup­port for the tribute economy can wane if control­ling elites emphasize hubris and coercion. This has implications for an understanding of the Maya col­lapse as it reflects the staying power of those hin­terland groups lasting beyond the hierarchical control of the largest urban aggregates and their immediate sustaining populations. The populations closest to those fragmented centers did indeed dis­appear (Scarborough and Burnside 2008), but those small communities outside that radius continued and likely absorbed a portion of those desperate populations abandoning the largest centers. 
When we examine the contemporary Maya, it is not the vestiges of the great Maya elite and their political economy that we are revisiting. Rather, it is the highly resilient and interdependent resource-specialized communities of the past that characterize their present-day endurance and longevity, especially in light of colonial and post­colonial domination.5 Although the highly tex­tured intercommunity studies of ethnographic present-day Zinacantan (Cancian 1965; Vogt 1968, 1969), Chamula (Collier 1975), or Chichi­castenango (Bunzel 1952) are frequently mined to best assess the political economy of the ancient Maya (Freidel et al. 1993; Schele and Freidel 1990), they best reflect the kinds of lasting eco­nomic, political, and ideological association of those original resource-specialize communities (cf. Connell 2003:39--40)-not the behaviors of Maya kings and their hubris. They reveal signifi­cant aspects of those ancient farmers archaeology has left behind. 
Acknowledgments. We wish to thank Joyce Marcus and Barry Isaac for carefully examining the draft of this article, although we make no assertion that either is in full agreement with our perspective. The two external reviewers, Tom Guderjan and Lisa Lucero, provided helpful insights, which were partially incorporated.

Notes 
I . Given the abundance of seasonal rainfall, individual households are assumed to have caught adequate water sup­plies from the immediate vicinity of their domiciles for eight months of the year. Nevertheless, if an individual requires 2.4-4.8 liters of water a day (McAnany 1990:269) during the four months (120 days) of droughtlike conditions, then a vol­ume of 72 m1, or 72,000 liters, of water provides for the needs of 125-250 people. Even if these figures are cut in half, because of evaporation (slight in the humid tropics), leakage, or other deranging forces, the potential number of individuals that might draw from this feature far exceeds the size of the immediate community at Grupo Agua Lluvia. 
2. 
On the basis of the logic provided in Note I, the large Medicinal Trail reservoir with a volume of 785 m3, or 785,000 liters, would have provided water to 1,363-2,726 individuals. 

3. 
Ballcourts in the Maya area are frequently found in small communities (Scarborough 1991). The uniqueness of the Chawak But'o'ob site is the absence of any other civic construction and the highly formalized appearance of the structure. Furthermore, no other ballcourt has been reported elsewhere along or near the escarpment margins. 

4. 
Eric Wolf (1982:71-77) showed the utility of a tribute mode of production in identify the political economy. Nevertheless, a mode of production operating in societal gatherings of the scale and complexity that we are addressing suggests a different directionality for the movement of goods, services, and information. We use the phrase "offering mode of production" as a counter to formalized hierarchical con­trols and suggest that resource-specialized communities inter­acted and exchanged resources and information in a manner based more on equity and aspects of authority than on power and coercion. The offering mode of production is unlike the kinship mode of production that Wolf also identifies, because the former is not circumscribed by the extended household and remains something different than the recently resurrected "house model" (Gillespie and Joyce 2000), after Levi­Strauss's "house societies" (1982, 1987). The offering mode of production emphasizes the role of community inclusive of lineage alliances and their extension into neighboring com­munities. The necessity of raw and processed resources accompanied by situational societal and environmental infor­mation forms the foundation for the "offering mode of pro­duction" shared between communities. 

5. 
The widespread and traditional role of the periodic market or "solar "perhaps best documented in Highland Guatemala and Chiapas, Mexico, is a living vestige of the interdependencies among communities drawn from the "resource-specialized community" model posited for the ancient Maya (Scarborough and Valdez 2003; cf. McBryde 1945; Reina and Hill 1978).
