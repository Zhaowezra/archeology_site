
CONCEPTS OF ETHNICITY AND CULTURE 
IN ANDEAN ARCHAEOLOGY 

Emily M. Stovel 
Although Andean archaeology has long used the term "ethnic" to refer to human groups, new understandings of ethnicity have injected less static understandings of contextualized identity construction into our models of the past. A review of recent work on ethnicity in the field reveals, however, that methodological approaches to these social entities do not always follow suit and rather favor normative synchronic comparisons. This paper explores the origins and trends in the study of ethnic groups and ethnicity in Andean archaeology, arguing that we may be seeing the persistence of the culture concept in the guise of ethnicity. It also examines best practices in the literature in order to make recommendations concerning the adoption of local, contextual, and diachronic methods in conjunction with multiple lines of evidence. These practices are more likely to expose the processes of identity construction by rendering explicit the relationships among culture, ethnicity, and the use of emblemic material culture. It argues, thereby.for the provision of proof of this process rather than its assertion. 
A pesar de que la arqueolog{a andina haya utilizado durante mucho tiempo el termino "etnico" para referirse a los grupos humanos en el pasado, una nueva definici6n de la etnicidad ha producido una vision menos estdtica de la construcci6n con­textualizada de identidades. Sin embargo, el presente trabajo, tras la exploraci6n de trabajos recientes sabre la etnicidad, revela que las enfoques metodol6gicos empleados no siempre siguen esta nueva trayectoria y par lo tanto favorecen com­paraciones normativas sincr6nicas. Este art{culo explora las or{genes y las tendencias en el estudio de las grupos etnicos y la etnicidad en la arqueolog(a andina, proponiendo que quizd estamos frente a la persistencia del concepto de cultura detrds de! uso actual de! concepto de etnicidad.A su vez, examina las mejores prdcticas en la literatura con elfin de ofrecer recomen­daciones sabre la adopci6n de una metodolog{a contextual y diacr6nica aplicando multiples lfneas de evidencia que nos dejardn mas cerca de la construcci6n de la identidad en el pasado.

This was no pristine social landscape of per­
manent tribes or pure ethnicities [Larson 
2004:21]. 
he cultural landscape of the Andean world Tis generally understood to have been com­posed of ethnicities of various sizes and complexity coexisting in the vertical ecological landscape of the Andean mountain range and adjoining coastal valleys and deserts. Each com­munity was expressed as a series of interconnected settlements that used trade, intermarriage, kin rela­tions, organized exchanges of labor, and/or satel­lite settlements in diverse ecological regions to gain access to a maximum of resources (Murra 1972, 1975, 1984; Salomon 1985). A number of schol­
ars have explored, directly and indirectly, how this dispersed, interconnected cultural landscape might have worked, questioning its variation in time and space, and connecting it to the development of social complexity (Blom 2005a, 2005b; Blom et al. 1998, 2003; Bray 1995, 2005; Goldstein 2000, 2005; Janusek 2002, 2004; Santoro et al. 2010; Stanish 1992, 2003; Van Buren 1996). 
Ethnic diversity also plays a pivotal part in our understanding of time in the Andes. The generally accepted chronologies of the Andes characterize the past as alternating between periods of regional integration (i.e., cultural horizons) and local dif­ferentiation (i.e., ethnic disintegration) (Rowe 1962; see Covey (2008) and Dulanto (2008) for changing perspectives on the Late Intermediate

Period). Thus ethnicity, as a pivotal part of the cul­
tural, temporal, and economic landscape of the Andes, is a fundamental part of Andean archaeol­ogy (Stanish 2005). 
Our definitions of ethnicity and how it works, however, have changed. Following Sian Jones (1997), Fredrik Barth (1969), and others (e.g., 
Bentley 1987; Bonfil Batalla 1992; Cohen 1974; 
Cohen 1978; Comaroff and Comaroff 1992; Dfaz­Polanco 1984; Shennan 1989), scholars of the Andes now employ a more active understanding of ethnic identity as a reflexive, perhaps inten­tional, political identity that develops due to spe­cific economic and political circumstances. An exploration of ethnic diversity in the Andes, there­fore, has become a more complex endeavor than the geographic and temporal delineation of named communities. We are drawn to the task of under­standing when, if, and how specific ethnic com­munities developed and what evidence we have of ethnic processes in the past. 
How well, however, do these two applications of ethnicity combine? Vertical complementarity argues that ethnic groups maintained strong affili­ation across long distances and through time, while being subject to shifting patterns of endogamy and exogamy, changing political and environmental conditions, and changing needs for group cohesion and the display of identity. The new intellectual par­adigm asks scholars to explore what conditions lead to the creation of ethnic identities in specific historical contexts and what materials are used in the public negotiation of these new social entities. The former may allow for shifting alliances and changing identities, but it presumes innate conti­nuity over long distances and periods of time­something perhaps more appropriately called "cultures" -and a synchronic comparison of high­land centers with satellite enclaves or of several enclaves co-occupying disparate ecological niches. The latter calls for diachronic comparative analy­ses that consider how identities are constructed from extant cultural resources within changing eco­nomic or political contexts. 
This contradiction has created problems for scholars of ethnicity in the Andes. Whereas the first would ask for multiple lines of evidence to coin­cide (i.e., covary) to confirm the presence of a cul­ture group expressed across the vertical archipelago, the latter would ask for only certain 
attributes to covary over time as part of the process 
of identity construction, maintenance, and display in the face of other shared practices/material cul­ture, usually in one location. This opposition echoes Jones's (1997:29) definition of ethnic groups as classification and ethnicity as a process. Although the definition of ethnicity has changed, its study is 
often accompanied hy normative methods that are 
not clearly different from previous procedures. As a result, the communities labeled ethnic have more the appearance of innate cultures rather than hav­ing been the product of active ethnic processes, which are significantly less frequent in occurrence. 
This article will examine how ethnic processes appear in some key texts on Andean archaeology in order to examine the methods employed to "see" ethnicity in the past. Clarifying this analytical process is important as we recover more about the special part that identity played in the social land­scape of the Andes and in the development of social complexity there (e.g., Goldstein 2005; Janusek 2004). If we substitute the term "ethnic" for "cul­ture" in our reference to presumed prehistoric groups or classifications of material culture, we are not applying a more critical method of discerning active identity construction, maintenance, or change. This requires a diachronic contextual analysis (as is often recognized but seldom employed) and, as I will argue here, the retention of the concept of culture as either an analytical tool to describe synchronic moments of comparatively different behavior and beliefs reflected in multiple material aspects or, more important! y, as the actual cultural background upon which ethnic identities were constructed. 
Ethnohistory and the 
Andean "Ethnic" Landscape 

The picture provided by colonial documents of pre­colonial Andean societies defies imposed Euro­pean experiences of territory or ethnic habitats representing mini-nations. The Andes are, and were, characterized by a dispersed settlement pat­tern that reflects varied economic practices carried out by each group such that one encounters some monocultural and some multicultural communities with much movement of populations and goods and varying qualities of authority and responsibilities .1 Communities also adhere to a central location

imbued with ritual, spiritual, and ancestral signif­icance (pacarinas, or places of origin, and huacas, revered locations of spirits, such as shrines). This cultural landscape is called the "vertical archipel­ago" (Murra 1972, 1975, 1985a, 1985b; Salomon 1985; Stanish 1992) in that each enclave, satellite community, or individual located away from a cul­tural core is seen as an island, connected by ethnic affiliation and economic "complementarity" but separate in space. Other terms and models have been proposed for this system with reference to the different practices of specific places and times or to correct missing components of the model: ver­ticalidad escalonada (Durston and Hidalgo 1997; Hidalgo and Durston 1998), complementariedad reticulada (Llagostera 1996), mobilidad giratoria (Ntifiez and Dillehay 1995), the coastal horizontal economic system (Rostworowski 1990; Shimada 1982), and the altiplano mode model (Browman 1980, 1984).All such models, however, explore the mechanisms by which Andean communities existed in a geographically dispersed, interdigi­tated manner (Martinez 1998). 
Many of these cultural groupings, variously referred to as ethnic groups, nations, or chiefdoms (senorios), underwent change through Inka and/or colonial administrative practices which tended to move communities across the landscape ( mitimaes, yana), require specific dress or the display of eth­nic symbols, condense dispersed or multiple com­munities into specific places (i.e., Spanish reducciones), and provide communities with names (Abercrombie 1998; D'Altroy 1987; Decoster 2005; de! Rio 2005; Huertas Vallejos 2009; Hidalgo and Durston 1998; Julien 1993; Lorandi and Rodriguez 2003; Ogburn 2007, 2008; Patterson 1987; Uribe et al. 2002; Van Buren 1996). Massive depopulation due to epidemics throughout the colo­nial period (Cook 1981) and migration to avoid abusive tribute obligations also led to significant population restructuring in the colonial period. 
The ubiquity of the term "ethnic" in the archae­ological literature is most likely an inherited prac­tice from critical ethnohistoric work on the concept of verticality (which has so strongly influenced archaeological research in the area) that used "eth­nic" as the primary term for groups in the Andes. Murra (1972, 1976, 1985a, 1985b), for example, uses the term ethnic or etnias almost exclusively to refer to the communities he is describing, affirm­ing that ethnic groups are found in different sizes and degrees of social and political complexity. He 
describes ethnic groups as very different culturally, 
with widely dispersed homelands and different lan­
guages (which are shared by multiple ethnic 
groups) and names (i.e., los yacha, los lupaqa, etc. 
[Murra 1972:430]). 
Rostworowski (1990) speaks more directly about the problems found in our conceptualization of ethnic groups, such as the lack of clarity about what the term means and the vagueness with which early chroniclers define types of communities. But when she uses the term herself, Rostworowski (1990) describes ethnic groups as having different occupations or geographic origin points (i.e., farm­ers vs. fishermen, highlanders vs. coastal people) suggestive of cultural differences. Her concept of macroetnia is composed of several chiefdoms under a single leader, probably speaking a unique language, and with a name (i.e., the Co/lee). She clearly discusses the problems of reading etic labels and entities into the past, but provides neither diachronic recognition of political identity con­struction nor clarification as to why these entities are not called cultures. Salomon (1982:76), in tum, cites Rowe (1946) when he explores how Andean ethnology initially adopted an Inka classification of "named highland regional-ethnic groups" with­out understanding what these names mean to Andean people themselves (see also Topic 1998). 
From this pivotal literature, Andean archaeolo­gists have inherited a classificatory system of groups labeled "ethnic" with cultural differences (including names, economic differences, and lan­guage differences), cohabitation of strategic resource zones, and possibly asymmetrical inter­action. These groups have become a central com­ponent of descriptions of the past in the Andes and a primary focus of research.2 That scholars have sought to explore these entities in the past using archaeological methods is not under debate here. The issue at hand is that archaeologists continue the practice of calling these entities ethnic groups rather than cultural groups while their analytical definition of ethnicity has changed. Andean archae­ologists may employ the former term to avoid the static nature of the culture concept as it was used in the earlier culture-historical period of the disci­pline and as part of a general disciplinary ques­tioning of the anthropological object of study

(Borofsky et al. 2001; Jones 1997; Shennan 1989; Watson 1995). Perhaps the term was initially adopted because the entities observed in colonial documents are not discrete, but are interrelated, interspersed, and overlapping, so they do not appear as traditional cohesive, territorially bound cultures. Perhaps the term "ethnic groups" is analytically intermediary-neither a household, nor a state (see discussion below), so it functions as a useful orga­nizational mid-range tool. Either way, the charac­teristics of the entities described appear to be innate and discrete. Moreover, as we shall see below, even if we have adopted the term ethnic to avoid the political and conceptual problems with a static cul­ture concept, we are returning to stasis through nor­mative methods. 
As in most analyses, scholars of Andean eth­nicity explore patterns of similarity and difference in time and space. Ethnicity, however, has func­tioned both as an object of study and as an analyt­ical device we use to explain patterning. If we persist in thinking that ethnic identity results in coherent, discrete categories of material culture, including stylistic production, burial practices, architecture, and skeletal morphology or genetic homogeneity (as critiqued by Bawden [2005:12] and S. Williams [2005]), we are ignoring the abun­dance of shared practices and material culture throughout the Andes that can belie such categories. We also circumvent the role of key objects and behaviors to bring together and signal explicit, cohesive identities at pivotal historic junctures. Recent explorations of ethnicity in the discipline are beginning to reflect this new understanding. 
Defining Ethnicity Differently 
The principal change in how Andean scholars understand ethnicity is the adoption of a sense of intentionality on the part of ancient peoples in the development, maintenance, and transformation of ethnic identities. There is also a shift from the study of or with ethnic groups to a focus on the use of ethnicity in Andean work. Throughout, there is a growing emphasis on the ethnic processes by which a group gathers and projects a cohesive identity, usually in a specific political or economic context (e.g., articles in Aldenderfer 1993; Kaulicke et al. 2002-2004; Knudson and Stojanowski 2009; Rey­craft, ed. 2005; Williams and Alberti 2005, in addi­tion to those reviewed below). Even so, the term often refers to innate characteristics that distinguish a group or groups. 
Most scholars writing since the early 1990s emphasize the following aspects of ethnicity: it is (or ethnic groups are) a process, rather than a state of being (e.g., Beron 2005; Reycraft 2005; Sillar and Dean 2002); it involves investment in the recognition of sameness and difference (e.g., Julien 1993; Navarrete 1990; Sutter 2005); it is self-defin­ing and reflexive (e.g., Vaughn 2005), and expressed materially to others (e.g., Bawden 1993; Sutter 2005). All suggest some form of intentional construction and communication of group charac­ter and cohesion (e.g., Gil Garcia 2002:230; Tor­res-Rouff 2009:220). This process arises due to specific historic, political, and economic condi­tions (e.g., Gordones Rojas and Meneses Pacheco 2005; Stovel 2005; Van Gijseghem 2006). Ethnic processes (rather than simply ethnic groups) are also linked to Inka political and administrative processes (e.g., Bauer and Covey 2002; D' Altroy 1987; Patterson 1987; articles in Kaulicke et al. 2002-2004; V. Williams 2005). 
Structurally, ethnic distinctions have been rep­resented as organizationally above gender distinc­tions (Oakland Rodman and Fernandez Lopez 2005) and above household or kin groups (e.g., Goldstein 2005; Janusek 2004). Bray (2005:120), in turn, has described ethnic groups as encom­passing several "nominally distinct polities" in northern Ecuador. Some sources may indirectly represent ethnicity as that part of the suite of a cul­ture's behaviors that encompasses identity pro­duction and representation (e.g., Barth 1994; Gordones Rojas 1994). Both Janusek (2004) and Goldstein (2005) suggest ethnic groups are larger than ayllus (collaborative Andean descent groups )3 in the structural sequence of combinations that include moieties and larger suprahousehold enti­ties. Janusek (2004:30) describes ethnic groups as "macro-ayllus" composed of several smaller house­hold groups and organized according to unequal moieties, combined into larger political entities or federations, variable in size and spatial distribution. Macro-ayllus share with ethnic groups the role of a cohesive group in times of "political confronta­tions or major rituals," and the concept of "com­mon ancestors, and a landscape of sacred places." At another point, however, Janusek (2004:33) 
Downloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core. YBP Library Services, on 22 Aug 2018 at 17:24:40, subject to the Cambridge Core terms of use, available at https://www.cambridge.org/core/terms. https://doi.org/10.7183/1045-6635.24.1.3 
claims, from the ethnographic and ethnohistoric literature, that ayllu families "are multiethnic, don­ning appropriate clothing styles in the local region, exchanging songs and dance routines, and in some cases speaking multiple languages" (added empha­sis). It would seem, then, that ethnic groups here are political and connected strongly with distin­guishing cultural attributes of dress, language, and ritual knowledge, but are periodic. Goldstein (2005:30) in tum sees ayllus and ethnic groups as suprahousehold entities that share a sense of soli­darity, ancestry, history, place, and belonging. Goldstein (2005:32) is explicit about seeing ayllus as ethnicity in motion, as they are tied to place through "points on the landscape" of ancestral importance, rather than bounded territories. 
When authors substantiate these arguments about ethnicity, they cite authors who discuss the process by which ethnicity is derived from deeper cultural beliefs as part of shared experiences. These experiences structure the interpretation of chang­ing political and economic situations (including conflict and power asymmetries) whereby indi­viduals and/or groups may seek to coalesce and dif­ferentiate themselves as part of position taking and/or building political power (Barth 1969; Bent­ley 1987; BonfilBatalla 1992; Cohen 1974; Cohen 1978; Comaroff and Comaroff 1992; Diaz-Polanco 1984; Jones 1997; Shennan 1989; although see Dietler and Herbrich [1998) for a different per­spective). Thus the general literature on ethnicity from which recent Andean scholars draw seems, explicitly (Jones 1997:95-96 in particular) or not, to see ethnicity as derived from a deeper cultural set of practices and beliefs. 
Active interpretations of ethnicity stem from disciplinary concerns with the concepts of tribe and culture and the general postcolonial political movement where research focused on self-deter­mination (i.e., intentionality) as part of identity processes rather than description on the part of for­eign western scholars (Jones 1997:52). Barth ( 1969) is particularly interested in the self-ascrip­tive process of ethnicity: how groups are defined and how their boundaries are set, often in oppo­sition to others, by the members themselves. Work based on the congruence of these ideas has had a long presence in other areas of archaeology (e.g., Emberling 1997; Hodder 1979, 1982; McGuire 1982; Stone 2003). The following section con­siders recent Andean approaches to ethnicity in the past. 
Identifying Ethnicity in Andean Archaeology 
Using an active paradigm for ethnic identity explains why and how groups develop and main­tain discrete identities during specific time peri­ods, rather than simply assuming that this is a universal social practice. This paradigm imbues the communities we work with and for with more agency while attempting to avoid the political implications of archaeological culture creation that can serve nationalist goals (Capriles Flores 2003, 2005; Gordones Rojas 1994; Kohl and Fawcett 1996; Kojan and Angelo 2005; Meskell 2002; Trig­ger 1984). A closer examination of archaeological analysis and data found in this same literature, however, reveals a normative trend that belies an active interpretation. 
When exploring how to recognize ethnic groups in the past, Andean archaeologists discuss various forms of style. There is much debate about what style means in the making of artifacts, but the pre­ponderance of authors relevant here cite Sackett (1985, 1986, 1990) and his concept of isochrestic variation, Wiessner (1983, 1984, 1985) and her concept of emblemic style, and Stanish (1989) and his caveat against artifact-based analysis of ethnic identity (see also Hegmon [1992) and Wobst [ 1977) for often cited work on style in this literature and the relevant discussion in Dietler and Herbich [1998)). To simplify a complex exchange, Sackett (1985, 1986, 1990) has argued that recurrent style characteristic of a specific group reflects an uncon­scious cultural affiliation or way of doing things. Wiessner (1983, 1984, 1985), however, sees cer­tain types of style as more intentional in their com­munication of group identity. Emblemic style is particularly useful because it seeks to define the boundaries of a community and thus echoes Barth's ( 1969) assertions that ethnic processes seek to dis­tinguish "us" and "them" categories. 
Stanish (1989; Aldenderfer and Stanish 1993) has warned us against seeing exotic goods as indicative of exotic identity, since the presence of exotic goods varies by context (e.g., higher fre­quency in graves rather than houses). He suggests as well that the portable nature of ceramics, for example, makes them unreliable indicators of iden-

tity in that they can muddy the waters of group material homogeneity and cohesion. He has argued that domestic architecture is a more powerful indi­cator of groups' identity in that, despite variation, "the basic residential [household] plan will remain more or less the same, and an "ideal" form of domestic residence can usually be defined" (Alden­derfer and Stanish 1993:6). This perspective is opposed to scholars who prefer objects or decora­tive practices involved in public ritual and/or dis­play (e.g., Blom 2005a; Reycraft 2005; Torres Rouff 2009). In the former case, ethnicity is a cul­tural concept, an ideal norm (not idealized, or diachronic, according to the authors) more sug­gestive of latent cultural practices. The latter cases reflect a different definition of ethnicity involving active, explicit (intentional) stylistic behavior in and for public ritual. 
If isochrestic variation is the partially uninten­tional reproduction of cultural ways of making things, then this model does not reflect the stylis­tic behavior of ethnicity as defined currently in the Andean archaeological literature because it lacks intentionality. Rather, it represents a range of styl­istic behaviors from which ethnicity will draw to objectify a new but related collective self (Jones 1997). Our obvious access to this process in archae­ology is through local, diachronic, and compara­tive analysis where we can identify previous practices, the impact of changing conditions, and the selection of specific material to represent and participate in group cohesion. The current Andean archaeology of ethnicity, however, favors two nor­mative approaches: synchronic comparative analy­ses and the identification of a priori ethnic markers. 
Methods Employed 
Tracing, for example, the vertical model inAndean archaeology, a type of architectural or ceramic style must be distinguished in the highlands and then found in the lowlands (e.g., Stanish et al. 1993; Wise 1993) during the same time period. This is a powerful mechanism to explore the social land­scape of the Andes, but it is only evidence of eth­nicity as it is currently conceived in the literature when we can determine that those stylistic ele­ments are objectified and communicated to others in conditions that require it. Vertical or zonal col­onization would provide the conditions for such objectifications in multiethnic (rather than multi­cultural) communities, but most analyses search for "the 'normative' or 'ideal' domestic unit" (Stanish et al. 1993:89), without a concurrent examination of the process through which housing might be chosen as a symbolic communication of difference. Without this, we are probably looking at isochrestic cultural variation. 
Nielsen (2001 :43), in fact, has asserted that it is unlikely that housing would be a reliable marker of ethnicity as it is currently defined and is more likely a reflection of deeper cultural practices. This is to say, the use of domestic architecture as a mech­anism for tracing vertical colonies remains valid if we understand these larger communities as cul­tures rather than ethnic groups. There is evidence. however, that this one-to-one matching of enclave expressions with highland origins is not possible because some highland centers appear to be het­erogeneous, while colonial enclaves are homoge­neous and not referential to or derivative from core practices, but stylistically new and different in their own right (Blom 2005a, 2005b; Blom et al. 1998; Goldstein 2005; Janusek 2002). The common approach to identifying ethnic groups in the verti­cal archipelago by comparing highland and coastal attributes is undermined by new evidence and the theoretical incompatibility of synchronic compar­ison with active, contextualized, definitions of eth­nicity. It would appear that this comparative approach is best suited to the exploration of longer lasting, more normative entities across the land­scape (i.e., cultures). 
Others argue for the use of specific artifact types to distinguish ethnic groups, but do not specify why those markers were chosen to signal ethnic­ity or provide a priori external justifications for their selection (Bawden 1993; Bonomo et al. 2005; Conrad 1993; Gordones Rojas 1994; Gordones Rojas and Meneses Pacheco 2005; Janusek 2005; Julien 1993; Oakland Rodman and Fernandez Lopez 2005; Vaughn 2005). This approach does not accommodate variation in the roles artifacts or stylistic types take depending on how and why ethnic groups develop. That is, there cannot be universal artifact types which might serve as eth­nic markers. These processes must be demon­strated through a diachronic analysis. Otherwise, a scholar is assuming the existence of ethnic iden­tity before it is studied.

Along these lines, Sutter (2005:184) asserts there is no "a priori reason to assume that any given culturally based behavior (i.e., artifact manufacture and use, archaeological features, cranial deforma­tion, etc.) will be an indicator of group affiliation ... because group formation and affiliation have been shown to be situational." Sillar and Dean (2002:217), in tum, question the presumption that cohesive and well-defined communities existed in the Andean past (see also discussion in Meskell [2002]). They find no material difference among the historically named Cana, Quispicanchi, Can­chi and Colla groups (see a similar case in Lima Torrez [2008a:142]). Others have found material diversity within historically named groups (e.g., Lima Torrez 2008b:270). These studies show the futility of using standard artifact types (i.e., ceram­ics) to identify ethnic groups in all cases. 
My concern here is the use of the term "ethnic groups" for different analytical concepts: one that is periodic and involves the contextual and inten­tional construction of difference, and another that is more passive, the isochrestic reflection of doing things differently. Neither will fall out into nicely differentiated cultural units, but the former involves a specific approach to understanding the political and economic context of an episodic construction and maintenance of difference, while the latter is often a placeholder analytical term used to refer to cultural difference, cultures, even "peoples," in the context of a discussion of something else. This col­lapse of categories is most likely the product of two understandings of ethnicity functioning at the same time: one inherited from ethnohistory that is essen­tially referring to cultures, and another that defines ethnicity as active but studies it as static entities. 
Ethnicity and Culture 
As is evident above, the large majority of scholars expressly studying ethnicity adhere to active con­textual ideas of ethnicity based on the work of Fredrik Barth ( 1969) and Sian Jones ( 1997) (among others cited above) to build a political picture of intentionally built group cohesion in the face of competition for resources or pressure from others, and as a social process in and of itself, rather than a first step in organizing data. But while many of the scholars working on ethnicity today recognize the active, reflective, constructed, and contextual 
nature of ethnicity espoused by Jones (1997), many 
have not implemented her important caveats with 
respect to time and culture. 
According to Jones ( 1997), ethnicity is the process whereby people draw on the shared expe­riences of habitus (Bourdieu 1990) to objectify cul­tural practices. Thus while culture and ethnicities are intimately intertwined, they are not the same thing (Navarrete 1990). Culture becomes the struc­turing context and frame for the coalescence of eth­nic communities, and ethnicity is related to but not determined by culture. Culture provides the frame­work within which conditions are interpreted and acted upon, not just the conditions themselves. As such, the spatial extent or discontinuity of a style or, even less so, of a discrete material assemblage cannot be a reflection of ethnicity (Jones 1997: 100). Rather, we must identify a potential culture (with any temporal or spatial expression) that includes "the existing cultural practices and modes of dif­ferentiation characterizing various social domains, such as gender and status differentiation, or the orga­nization of space within households" (Jones 1997: 125). From this, "the expression of ethnicity may be confined to a limited range of stylistic attrib­utes which have become associated with an ethnic referent, and these attributes may be actively main­tained and manipulated in the negotiation of social relations" (Jones 1997: 116). 
Berdan and collaborators (2008), for example, have brought together a volume that asserts that these periodic and historical entities (i.e., ethnic groups) require conditions of cohabitation and hier­archy and are best studied through diachronic con­sideration. They recommend a focus on "diacritical symbols that helped define ethnic groups" (Stark and Chance 2008: 14, 18). Jones ( 1997) would con­cur and identifies a shared cultural substrate as the most likely source for these symbols (see Hegmon and Kulow 2005 for another example of change overlying continuity, although for the case of agency). It is not possible here to explore all poten­tial archaeological approaches to culture (see, for example, Thomas 1996). Rather, I will clarify meth­ods Andean archaeologists might adopt that are more in line with the identity models they already use. 
Thus, Jones asserts that ethnicity is the objecti­fication of cultural differences according to the con­text of interaction and the historical circumstances engendering the objectification. This demands keen
