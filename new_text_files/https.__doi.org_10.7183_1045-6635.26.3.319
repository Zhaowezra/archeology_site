POLYCHROME POTTERY ECONOMICS AND RITUAL LIFE IN 
POSTCLASSIC OAXACA, MEXICO 

Marc N. Levine, Lane F. Fargher, Leslie G. Cecil, and Jamie E. Forde 
Tututepec was a regional capital that dominated much of southern Oaxaca, Mexico, during the Late Postclassic period 
(A.D. 1100-1522). This article synthesizes the results of compositional (neutron activation and petrography ), stylistic, and iconographic analyses of pottery from commoner household excavations at Tututepec to address questions concerning ceramic production and distribution and also to shed light on aspects of political economy and domestic ritual at the capital. The study focuses primarily on Mixteca-Puebla polychromes, painted serving vessels bearing complex decorative motifs. Our compositional analyses, interpreted in light of the bedrock geology of the region, indicate that commoners obtained at least six to ten distinct varieties of pottery made from raw materials available locally within greater Tututepec. We argue that households probably acquired pottery through a central marketplace at the capital. In addition, our study demonstrates that commoners had regular access to polychromes from multiple producers, challenging the widespread notion that these vessels were restricted to elites who controlled their production. We argue that polychrome serving vessels played a prominent role in commonly occurring domestic rituals. Furthermore, commoners appear to have consciously selected vessels painted with imagery associated with warfare and sacrifice, suggesting that they actively supported the official imperial ideology of Tu tu tepec. 
Tututepec Jue una capital regional que domino gran parte def sur de Oaxaca, Mexico, en el Posclasico tardfo ( l/00-1522 d.C.). Este art{culo sintetiza los resultados de los analisis de la composicion (analisis por activacion neutronica y petrografia), estilo e iconografia de la ceramica de las excavaciones de conjuntos habitacionales de la genie comzin en Tututepec para abordar cuestiones sobre la produccion y la distribucion de ceramica, y tambien para aclarar los aspectos de la econom{a polftica y ritual domestica en la capital. El estudio se centra mas intensamente en la ceramica polfcroma Mixteca-Puebla, vasijas para servir con motivos decorativos complejos. Nuestros analisis de la composicion, interpretados a la luz de la geolog{a de la region, indican que la genie comzin obtuvo entre seis y diez variedades distintas de ceramica, manufacturadas con materias primas disponibles localmente-dentro o alrededor de Tututepec. Planteamos queen Los conjuntos habitacionales probablemente se adquirio la ceramica a traves de un mercado central localizado en la capital. Ademas, nuestro estudio demuestra que la gente comzin ten{a acceso a la ceramica polfcromafabricada por varios alfareros, desafiando la idea gene ­ralizada de que estas vasijasfueron restringidas a las elites, quienes controlaban su produccion. Proponemos que las vasijas polfcromas de servir jugaron un papel destacado en los rituales domesticos ordinarios. Azin mas, las comuneros parecen haber seleccionado conscientemente las vasijas pintadas con imagenes asociadas con la guerra y el sacrificio, lo que sugiere que apoyaron activamente la ideolog{a imperial oficial de Tututepec.

role in such studies, especially those focusing on market dynamics in Postclassic Central Mexico (e.g., Garraty 20 13; Hodge et al. 1993; Mine 2006; Neff et al. 2000; Nichols et al. 2002). Far less research, however, has examined Postclassic markets in Oaxaca. Much of this work has relied disproportionately on ethnohistorical-as op­posed to archaeological-data (e.g., Appel 1982; Pohl et al. 1997; but see Feinman et al. 1992). Furthermore, nearly all of the Oaxacan research has focused on the Valley of Oaxaca and Mixteca Alta regions, where the presence of market ac­tivity in the Late Postclassic is generally accepted, although the development, nature, and articulation of these markets with other facets of sociopolitical life remain less clear (Feinman and Nicholas 20 10:9 1; Terraciano 200 1:248-249). In present­ing the results of compositional and stylistic analyses of pottery at Tututepec, on the southern 
coast of Oaxaca, this study sheds new light on Late Postclassic market activity while also in­vestigating how patterns of ceramic production and consumption provide insights into social re­lationships at the capital. More specifically, we trace economic patterns associated with Mixteca­Puebla polychrome pottery to commoner house­holds where these highly decorated vessels were used in intimate ritual practices. 
Tututepec is located in the lower Rio Verde region of Oaxaca, Mexico (Figure 1). During the Late Postclassic period (A.D. 1100-1522), this Mixtec capital conquered and extracted tribute from dozens of subject communities along the coast of Oaxaca and adjacent regions (Spores 1993). In this study, we present the results ofln­strumental Neutron Activation Analysis (INAA) and petrographic analysis of 66 potsherds from household excavations carried out by the Tutute-

pee Archaeological Project (TAP). These com­positional studies were conducted in conjunction with a broader stylistic analysis of the Late Post­classic Yucudzaa phase (A.D. 1100-1522) ce­ramic assemblage and a more detailed icono­graphic study of Mixteca-Puebla polychrome pottery. 
The primary goals of the INAA and petro­graphic sourcing studies were to better define compositional variability within the Tututepec pottery assemblage and to distinguish local from imported wares. The results reveal the presence of at least six to ten compositionally distinct pot­tery "recipes" representing multiple local pro­ducers and without clear evidence for imported pottery. We interpret this ceramic diversity as support for the idea that Tututepec households obtained pottery chiefly through market ex­change, which provided access to pottery from multiple producers. Viewed within the context of the broader findings of the TAP excavations (Levine 2007, 2011; Levine et al. 2011), the ce­ramic study supports the notion that commoner households were deeply engaged in commerce that depended on and was facilitated by a central marketplace at the capital. 
Our study focuses primarily on Mixteca­Puebla polychromes, widely regarded as the most finely painted and iconographically complex pot­tery from Postclassic Mesoamerica (see Nichol­son and Quinones 1994). Considering that the TAP residences were relatively low-status com­moner households, the quantity of Mixteca­Puebla polychromes recovered was unexpectedly high (Levine 20ll:Table 4). This finding demands a reappraisal of the conventional thinking that Mixteca-Puebla polychromes were essentially high-status wares that circulated among royal people to facilitate the creation and maintenance of elite exchange networks (Lind 1987:20, 1994:97; Pohl 2003; Smith and Heath-Smith 1980:31). Conversely, the TAP data demonstrate that for at least one segment of the commoner populace of Tututepec-a comparatively affluent segment-polychrome pottery was an important feature of household ritual life. We argue further that Mixteca-Puebla polychromes played a promi­nent role in small-scale ritual feasting contexts in which food and drink were served. These ritual events were strongly oriented towards the living 
members of the household, creating a context for the negotiation of social ties and identity. Fur­thermore, the INAA and petrographic studies demonstrate that commoners had access to Mix­teca-Puebla polychromes from multiple produc­ers. Because the TAP excavations recovered a narrow range of polychrome vessel forms but a diversity of painted decorations, we suggest that commoners selected vessels on the basis of their painted designs and associated symbolic conno­tations rather than vessel shape. Among the dec­orative elements featured on the Mixteca-Puebla polychromes at the TAP residences, those asso­ciated with warfare and sacrifice were particularly well represented, suggesting that commoners sub­scribed to a broader polity-level ideology sup­porting the Tututepecan program of expansion and conquest. Yet these polychromes also served as a focal point in commoner household ritual practices that provided a context for the negotia­tion of social relationships and identity. 
Tututepec and the Ceramic Sample 
Tututepec is located on the coast of Oaxaca and adjacent to the Rio Verde floodplain, one of the largest and most fertile tracts of land in Oaxaca (Joyce and Mueller 1997). Apart from excellent farmland, Tututepec benefitted from access to valuable lowland trade goods, such as cacao, cot­ton, feathers, fish, and sea salt (Smith 1973). Dur­ing the Late Postclassic, Tututepec conquered an estimated 25 ,000 km2 of coastal Oaxaca, includ­ing dozens of vassal communities who paid trib­ute to the capital and ultimately fueled its trade with highland centers (Spores 1993). Tututepec appears to have been a regional entrep6t that served as the critical southern node of a lucrative highland-lowland Mixtec trade circuit (Joyce et al. 2004; Levine 2007; Monaghan 1994; Pohl 1994; Spores 1993). 
The 66 ceramic samples analyzed in this study were recovered from excavations at two residences at Late Postclassic Tututepec (Levine 2007; Table 1). These two households, Residences A and B, were located approximately 1.25 km northeast of the civic-ceremonial core of Tututepec. Limited excavations were also carried out at a third house­hold, Residence C, but these are discussed only sparingly herein. Detailed studies of the household

architecture and associated material culture indicate that Residences A and B were relatively low-status commoner residences, but did have access to social valuables (Levine 2011). The utter lack of evidence for pottery production indicates that these house­holds obtained ceramics through exchange. 
The Late Postclassic pottery of Tututepec cor­responds to the Yucudzaa phase (A.D. 1100­1522) in the lower Rfo Verde ceramic chronology and includes fine brownware, medium brown­ware, coarse brownware, and grayware paste types (Levine 2007; see also Joyce 1991: 171; O' Mack 1990). All of these paste types were in­cluded in our compositional analyses, yet a greater emphasis was placed on sampling Yucud­zaa polychrome pottery (N = 33), a variant of the well-known Mixteca-Puebla style found across much of Late Postclassic Mesoamerica (Hernan­dez 2010; Lind 1987; Pohl 1994; see also chapters in Nicholson and Quinones 1994). Because the TAP recovered a surprisingly high quantity of Mixteca-Puebla polychromes in commoner con­texts, we decided to focus primarily on these dec­orated wares. 
Among the 66 ceramic samples included in this study, 55 were drawn from Residence A, dat­ing to the fourteenth century, and 11 from Resi­dence B, dating to the fifteenth century (Levine 2011). The households were dated on the basis of radiocarbon dates, stratigraphic analysis, and diagnostic pottery corresponding to the lower Rfo Verde region ceramic chronology. Little evidence for architectural remodeling at the residences sug­gests that they may have been occupied for a rel­atively short period of a few generations. The ce­ramic samples were selected from the TAP excavations and primarily from midden contexts adjacent to living areas, where the vast majority of artifacts were recovered. Most of the samples were fine brownwares (N = 51), a category that includes Yucudzaa polychromes, followed by medium brownwares (N = 4), coarse brownwares (N = 3), and graywares (N = 3). Five additional samples represented undetermined paste types that diverged from the aforementioned categories (Table 1). Figures 2 and 3 include drawings of a selection of the Yucudzaa phase pottery samples. 
The non-random ceramic sampling strategy had three objectives: (1) to include samples from all of the Yucudzaa phase ceramic paste cate­gories; (2) to include potential non-local ceramics identified on the basis of stylistic analysis; and 
(3) to sample Mixteca-Puebla polychromes dis­playing a diversity of decorative, formal, and compositional attributes. We employed the INAA and petrographic techniques to better define the diversity of ceramic wares obtained and utilized at Tututepec, including the proportion of local versus non-local wares, and to probe further into the nature of production and distribution of Mix­teca-Puebla polychromes. 
Mixteca-Puebla Codex-Style Polychromes 
George Vaillant (1938:565) initially used "Mix­teca-Puebla" to describe a geographic region as­sociated with a particular "ceremonial symbolism, as seen in manuscripts and on late pottery," but this term later came to describe a broader range of Postclassic artistic styles extending beyond Oaxaca and Puebla (Smith 2003:181-182). In light of debate concerning the Mixteca-Puebla concept and terminology (see Smith 2003), we use it in reference to the specific codex style, which evokes the artistic elaboration of codices known from Oaxaca, Puebla, Tlaxcala, and the Basin of Mexico. This style is typified by illus­trations in the Mixtec and Borgia codices, but it is also manifest in other media, such as painted murals and pottery, metal jewelry, turquoise mo­saics, and carved stone, bone, shell, and wood (Caso 1969). Jamie Forde's (2006) detailed study of Yucudzaa poly chromes from the TAP excava­tions demonstrates that they represent a regional sub-style of the broader Mixteca-Puebla codex­style pottery. 
Scholars have long associated Mixteca-Puebla polychrome pottery with elites because of their elaborate painted decoration, requiring great skill and knowledge, and their relative scarcity com­pared to other Postclassic serving wares (Hernan­dez 2010:265). The complexity of the codex-style imagery, including a colorful and enigmatic array of symbols, gods, animals, people, and other motifs with religious connotations (Lind 1994:94-95), also contributed to the notion that they were en­demic to elite culture. Images in the Mixtec codices reinforce these assumptions, including scenes of royalty toasting one another with polychromes brimming with libations (Lind 1994:87). Further-

more, the discovery of Late Postclassic tombs with spectacular offerings of Mixteca-Puebla poly­chromes at sites such as Monte Alban (Caso 1969) and Zaachila (Gallegos 1963), helped cement the idea that these vessels were restricted to elites. 
Lind (1994:97) asserts that Pilitas poly­chromes, a sub-style of the Mixteca-Puebla style from the Mixteca Alta, "appear to have served as fancy drinking vessels displayed at royal wed­dings and at public gatherings among the political elite." Similarly, yet speaking of social relations at the interregional scale, Pohl (2003:206) posits that Mixteca-Puebla polychromes "helped pro­mote shared social agendas and alliances in royal feasting networks that unified Eastern Nahua, Mixtec, and Zapotec royal houses." Although we do not dispute the role of polychromes in elite rituals, the Tututepec data demonstrate that some commoners also obtained and used Mixteca­Puebla polychromes. This finding implores us to rethink our assumptions about the significance of these decorated wares and their place in Late Postclassic Oaxacan society. 
Yucudzaa polychromes from greater Tututepec bear a strong resemblance to Mixteca-Puebla polychromes found in the Valley of Oaxaca and Mixteca Alta-especially Pilitas polychrome (Forde 2006; cf. Lind 1987:14-22). Forde recorded over 50 decorative motifs among the Yucudzaa polychromes from the TAP excava­tions, including anthropomorphic, zoomorphic, and phytomorphic images, as well as ritual ob­jects. The decorations were painted in a variety of colors, including orange, yellow, black, red, blue, white, pink, and-less frequently-purple, brown, and yellow. In regard to vessel form, over 85 percent of the polychromes from Residences A and B were either cajetes (bowls) or ollas Uars), both of which had hollow tripod supports (Table 2). Vessel support forms included conical, ser­pent-head, deer-hoof, opossum-head, eagle-head, and mushroom/phallic types. The cajetes were painted on their interiors and often on their exte­riors as well (Figure 4). The ollas had globular bodies and slightly restricted mouths and were painted on their exteriors only (Figure 5). Mix­teca-Puebla polychromes were common in all three of the households excavated by the TAP­all of which were determined to be non-elite res­idences (Levine 2011). Taken together, Mixteca­Puebla polychromes amounted to nearly 8 percent of all rim sherds recovered at the TAP households (Table 3). In comparison, available data from contemporaneous excavated household contexts elsewhere in Oaxaca suggest that Mixteca-Puebla polychromes typically made up less than 3 per­cent of the ceramic assemblage-far less than at Tututepec (Levine 2007:Table 6.02). 
In the following section, we describe variabil­ity in the local bedrock geology of the greater lower Rfo Verde region, the source of raw mate­rial used to produce Tututepec ceramics. This discussion is important because regional variabil­ity in geochemical and mineralogical character­istics provides a crucial link to the results of our compositional analyses, allowing us to propose general locations where clay and temper for the pottery may have been procured.

The Progreso pluton, which lies beneath Tu­tutepec and stretches west, is comparatively richer in mafic minerals, as well as magnesium and iron. Furthermore, this material should exhibit a rela­tively high frequency of hornblende and biotite, as well as plagioclase and heavy elements (e.g., Fe, Cr, and Zn), as compared with potassium feldspar and quartz (more felsic minerals). In contrast, the Rfo Grande pluton, just east of Tu­tutepec, has comparatively fewer mafic inclusions and is richer in felsic minerals. Finally, the allu­vium at the eastern and southeastern edge of Tu­tutepec is located where erosion from these two distinct plutons converges, resulting in sediments (clays, silts, and sands) that exhibit a "mixed" character intermediate between the two plutons.

Petrographic Analysis and Results 

The petrographic analysis of the TAP samples began with an examination of the thin sections to identify mineral and rock inclusions, as well as other materials (e.g., bone, shell) present in the silt, sand, and gravel size ranges. In the second step of the analysis, each thin section was point counted using a mechanical stage to move across the thin section at I-mm intervals and record as­sociated minerals at each interval (see methodol­ogy in Stoltman [1989, 2001]). A minimum of

100 point-counts were carried out for each thin­section, where possible, to ensure an accuracy of approximately 3.5 percent. The third step in­volved quantitative analysis of mineral composi­tion and texture using ternary plots of quartz, pla­gioclase, and mafic minerals (especially biotite), as well as clay, silt, and sand. Clusters on these ternary plots combined with statistical analysis were then used to distinguish high and low mafic compositions as well as fine and coarse pastes (Figure 7; Supplemental Figures 1 and 2).1 
Consistent with the composition of the local geology, the petrographic analysis showed that mineral inclusions observed in the ceramic thin sections were derived from granite-granodior-

ite-tonalite (Supplemental Table 1; Blatt and Tracy 1996:Figure 3-2). Thus, we conclude that all of the TAP pottery was made locally, probably with raw material mined within 10 km of the capital. Moreover, there was enough diversity within the sample to distinguish ceramic groups with mineralogical attributes associated with sources comparatively higher (i.e., Progreso plu­ton) and lower in mafic inclusions (i.e., Rfo Grande pluton; Supplemental Table 2). Together, the mineralogical and texture data allow us to identify 10 distinct local ceramic paste groups and tie them to distinct source locations in and around Tututepec (Table 4).
