MOCHE SOCIOPOLITICAL DYNAMICS AND THE 
ROLE OF LICAPA II, CHICAMA VALLEY, PERU 

Michele L. Koons 
Fieldwork at the Moche (A .D. 250-900) site of Licapa /I in the Chicama Valley, Peru, has resulted in a more nuanced history of the changing sociopolitical relationships among Moche centers. The distinct archaeological signatures of Moche society, namely ceramics and huacas (monumental structures), have been interpreted as emblematic of an ethnic and political reality and a.1 evidence for a state. Nonetheless, scholars are now disentangling these assumptions, arguing that Moche society was a complex mosaic of interacting settlements. My research at Licapa II combined surface collection, geophysical surveys, excavation, and chronometric analysis to better understand this site within the context of broader Moche sociopolitical dynamics. Ceramic and architectural evidence from Licapa II indicates that a shift in ideological organization occurred around AD. 650. This shift reflects changes seen throughout the Moche world. Licapa II is located on the border of the northern and southern regions of Moche cultural development, and ceramic styles indicate that many of the interactions between these regions could have occurred here. By comparing these findings to evidence of sociopolitical reorganization seen elsewhere, research from Licapa II contributes to a non-state and decentralized view of the sociopolitical structure of Moche society. 
El trabajo de campo llevado a cabo en el sitio Moche (250-900 d.C.) de Licapa II, ubicado en el valle de Chicama, Peru, nos presenta una historia mas matizada de las relaciones sociopoUticas entre los centros Moche y los cambios de estos a traves de! tiempo. Las caracter{sticas arqueol6gicas distintivas Moche, es decir, la ceramica y las huacas ( edificios monumentales hechos de adobe), han sido interpretadas como emblematicas de una realidad etnica y poUtica, y definidas como evidencia de un estado. Sin embargo, los investigadores estan ahora evaluando estas hip6tesis, argumentando que la sociedad Moche pudo haber sido un mosaico complejo de asentamientos de interacci6n. La investigaci6n realizada en Licapa IIcombina la recolecci6n superjicial, los estudios geoj{sicos, la excavaci6n y el analisis cronol6gico para entender mejor el sitio dentro de un contexto mas amplio de la dinamica sociopolftica Moche. La evidencia ceramica y arquitect6nica de Licapa /I indica que alrededor del 650 d.C. se produjo un cambio en la organizaci6n ideol6gica, que refleja los cambios vistas en todo el mundo Moche. Licapa II esta situado en la frontera de las regiones norte y sur Moc hes y los estilos ceramicos indican que gran parte de las interacciones entre las regiones podrfan haber ocurrido all{. Al comparar estos resultados con las pruebas de reorganizaci6n sociopoUtica en zonas fronterizas, la investigaci6n en Licapa fl contribuye a una vision no-estatal y descentralizada de la estructura sociopolftica de la sociedad Moche. 
he Moche civilization (A.D. 250-900) is Tcharacterized by elaborately decorated temple complexes, wealthy elite burials, and exquisite ceramics found over 10 valleys in the desert on the north coast of Peru (Figure 1; Bawden 1996; Quilter 2010). The Moche have long been considered a single archaeological cul­ture and the first state-level society in South America (Bourget, cited in Atwood 2010; Stanish 2001). Over the last 15 years, Luis Jaime Castillo and Santiago Uceda (2008) have established that Moche was not a single, homogeneous entity. Rather, it consisted of at least two major cultural regions-the northern region and the southern region-separated by the large Pampa de Paijan desert (Figure 1). Differences in ceramic and ar­chitectural styles between the two regions have led scholars to contend that the northern region was composed of a series of independent polities (Castillo and Donnan 1994; Castillo and Uceda 2008; Swenson 2004). Research in the southern region is starting to indicate a similar pattern, but it has not reached the same level of nuance as re­search in the north.

The research presented here on Licapa II chal­lenges the Moche state model through an exami­nation of a midsized ceremonial center in a critical location between the northern and southern Moche regions. By working within the framework that similarities and differences in material culture are indicative of site affiliations (Plog 1976; Smith 2003), this study compares architecture and ce­ramics from Licapa II to patterns seen at other Moche sites in both regions. This work tests the validity of the boundary drawn between the north­ern and southern Moche regions and challenges current understandings of Moche political orga­nization. Based on this comparative research and new radiocarbon dates from Licapa II, I argue that people residing in both the northern and southern Moche regions were organized into a series of independent and diverse polities that in­teracted in dynamic ways throughout the duration of Moche presence in Peru.

Koons] MOCHE SOCIOPOLITICAL DYNAMICS AND THE ROLE OF LICAPA II 

When compared to surrounding sites, the analysis of material culture obtained through sur­face collection, geophysical surveys, excavation, and radiocarbon dating at Licapa II reveals that a major ideological reorganization occurred throughout the Moche world sometime around 
A.D. 600-650. Specifically, this reorganization is reflected in a change in ceramic styles and ar­chitectural patterns seen at Licapa II that has also been identified at larger Moche centers to the north and south. The earlier phase consisted of highly visible monuments where elite-driven cer­emonies focused on shared religious traditions. The later phase had more intimate monumental spaces with dedicated public areas for large-scale feasting events (cf. Bawden 1977; Uceda and Tufinio 2003). 
In this paper, I compare Licapa II to two large southern Moche sites: Huacas de Moche, located in the Moche Valley, and El Brujo, in the Chicama Valley (Figure 1). Huacas de Moche consists of Huaca de la Luna, Huaca del Sol, and a large "urban zone" or residential area between the hua­cas (monumental structures) . Previous studies at the Huaca de la Luna maintain that the Huacas de Moc he was the capital of the southern Moc he state and the locus from which Moche sociopo­litical influence spread to other valleys (Uceda 2010). The El Brujo complex is located on the northern side of the mouth of the Chicama River, adjacent to the coast. The site consists of Huaca Cao Viejo and Huaca Cortada. Residential areas and smaller buildings lie between and to the north and south of the main huacas (Mujica 2007). No­tably, the mural and architectural program of the final phase of Huaca Cao Viejo is identical to the final phase of Huaca de la Luna. Because of the large size and architectural similarities of these two centers and the abundance of finely decorated Moche ceramics in these valleys, the Moche and Chicama valleys are considered the heartland of the Moc he sphere of influence (Larco 1945). 
Licapa II is a smaller huaca center in this heartland, and it displays many of the architectural characteristics of the southern centers of El Brujo and Huacas de Moche. The site is located in the northern Chicama Valley, on the border of the northern and southern regions. The most signifi­cant archaeological findings from this site are the multiple ceramic styles, specifically those asso­
ciated with both the southern (Moche IV and V) and northern region (Late Moche). To date, few studies of the Moche archaeolog­ical culture have been conducted with the aim of 
(1) examining the changing dynamics of Moche settlements through time, (2) uncovering the re­lationships between the traditionally agreed upon northern and southern regions, and (3) discussing the role of differently sized settlements, specifi­cally in the Moche heartland. By addressing these three aims through multiple archaeological meth­ods, this research contributes to understanding how Moche sociopolitical relationships crosscut physical boundaries and changed through time. 
Licapa II presents an ideal test site for inves­tigating these aims because: it was occupied for the majority of Moche presence on the north coast1; it is located in the northern Chicama Val­ley, on the so-called border between the northern and southern Moche regions; and it is the first Moche ceremonial site of its size and kind to be investigated in the heartland (see Giersz [2011] and Makowski [1994, 2010] for examples of other midsized centers outside the Moche heartland). 
Ceramic and Architectural Style 
Moche is broadly defined as a series of religious traditions manifest in a shared suite of symbols in the cultural products of people who lived along the north coast of Peru between A.D. 250 and A .D. 900 (Bawden 1996; Donnan 2010; Quilter 2010). These shared religious traditions have been linked to a political dimension that led to the spread of the Moche ideology. Early scholars maintained that the mechanism of this spread was warfare and conquest (Larco 1945). They often disregarded other factors such as access to resources, trade routes and partners, kinship ties, and marriage al­liances. This political dimension is relevant to un­derstanding how power was distributed, reinforced, legitimized, and practiced in the Moche world and is critical for elucidating Moche authority and in­terregional interactions. A close comparison of ma­terial remains, including ceramics and architectural structures such as huacas with good chronological control, reveals the dynamism of Moche geopoli­tics over time and space.

tegral to the identity of a group (Hegmon 1992). People move physical objects from place to place through trade, exchange, and migration. Addition­ally, aesthetic design can be emulated away from the place of origin as a way to display the adoption of a particular ideology. For example, elsewhere I show that Moche IV vessels were made with clays from numerous valleys but were manufac­tured in the same form and with similar surface decorations (Koons 2015). Christopher Donnan and Donna McClelland (1999) have identified a number of different artists on the basis of the dif­ferent characteristics seen in the details of Moche fineline art. It is very possible that these skilled artists traveled around the Moche world to paint vessels (see Houston 2015; Sillar 2000). The adop­tion or rejection of particular ceramic aesthetics, regardless of the clays used, often signifies group inclusion and exclusion (Quilter 2010). 
Unlike ceramics, huaca architecture is immo­bile, but the fa\:ades convey messages of ideo­logical affiliations. The visible exterior form and painted fac;ade can look the same as other huacas, but any number of internal construction tech­niques could have been used to achieve this goal, which may signify nuances in the way labor was 
organized and managed across sites. Furthermore, although stationary, huacas were not static fea­tures on the landscape. Many Moche huacas are composed of multiple superimposed buildings. Uceda and Tufinio (2003:202) have noted that each building at Huaca de la Luna renewed the power of the temple. Many burials are found in the fill of each building, possibly as offerings to the temples themselves, the gods, or a deceased or new ruler. Architecture played an active role in the production and reproduction of sociopolit­ical life and stood as a monument to the past in addition to the present authority. 
Background on Moche Studies 
In the early half of the twentieth century, Rafael Larco Hoyle (1945), the pioneer ofMoche studies, was a vehement promoter of the Moche as a highly advanced civilization and a conquest-based polity. He envisioned a central authority located in the heartland and argued that this polity used warfare and religion to maintain control over the popula­tions of other coastal valleys (Larco 2001: 185­196). Work by Gordon Willey (1953), William Duncan Strong and Clifford Evans (1952), the Harvard Chan Chan Moche Valley Project (Mose­ley and Day 1982) , and David Wilson (1988) in areas south of the Moche Valley reinforced Larco's view of a unified Moche and led to the develop­ment of models that saw the Moche as a single conquest state. 
Larco's (1948) five-phase ceramic sequence tracked Moche development through time, and it remains influential. The sequence is based on changes in the shape of the spout and body of stirrup-spout bottles, a ubiquitous vessel shape throughout the precolumbian Andes. Larco iden­tified five different phases based on his excava­tions throughout the Chicama Valley. Nonethe­less , he never stratigraphically excavated the entire sequence in order. More recently, other at­tributes, such as changes in the iconography on the vessels corresponding to Larco's phases, have been identified (Donnan 1976:54-58; Donnan and McClelland 1999; McClelland et al. 2007). Until the 1990s, Larco (1945) and other scholars thought that Moche expansion could be tracked based on when ceramics of a particular phase were adopted in each of the north coast valleys (Moseley and Day 1982; Strong and Evans 1952; Willey 1953; Wilson 1988) . 
Research in the last two and a half decades has called into question Larco's expansionary state model (Bawden 1996; Castillo 2001; Castillo and Donnan 1994; Castillo and Uceda 2008; Chapde­laine 2001; Lockard 2005, 2009; Quilter 2002; Shimada 1994, 2010; Swenson 2004). lnvestiga­tions at sites such as San Jose de Moro in the Je­quetepeque Valley (Figure 1) have demonstrated that Larco's five-phase ceramic sequence is not an appropriate framework for ceramics in the northern valleys, so scholars working there have adopted a revised three-stage (Early, Middle, Late) ceramic chronological sequence (Castillo 2001). Based on differences in ceramic and architectural styles, as well as settlement patterns, the northern region is currently viewed as a series of indepen­dent polities (Castillo and Donnan 1994; CastiJlo and Uceda 2008; Swenson 2004). 
Research on the southern Moche region has not reached this level of nuance, but strides are being made to obtain the data necessary to create a more refined view of the cultural products of the

region (see Mi Ilaire 2010; Quilter and Koons 2012). The Moche I-V sequence is still used for the valleys south of the Pampa de Paijan desert. Nonetheless, Larco's classification is currently be­ing revised, given that recent research has shown that it does not represent a true chronology cor­roborated by radiocarbon dates (Koons and Alex 2014; Lockard 2009). Nonetheless, it does track stylistic differences in the Moche world (Cole 2012; Donnan 2011). Researchers are investigating what these different styles represent, which will help us better understand how and if ceramic style is related to Moche geopolitical interactions. Thus far, our research at Licapa II supports Lockard's work and shows that Moche IV, V, and Late Moche styles were all in use simultaneously. 
Field Research at Licapa II 
Licapa II is located on the southern foothills of the Cerro Azul mountain in the northern portion of the lower Chicama Valley (Figure 2) .The mon­umental core consists of two huacas, identified as Huaca A and Huaca B. Huaca A measures 55 by 57 m at its base and is 9 m high, and Huaca B measures 80 by 66 m at its base and is 6-7 m high. Huaca A is located 300 m to the northeast of Huaca B. The two huacas are very different. A person standing on the summit of Huaca A is quite visible from the ground surface, whereas Huaca B consists of interior rooms that would have hidden people from view. Between the hua­cas is what appears to be a looted residential area. To the west of both huacas is an area with two smaller buildings, a possible platform cemetery area, and a possible storage facility (Figure 2). Geophysical survey data show that other struc­tures once stood to the southwest of the extant architecture (Koons 2012). A canal that dates to the Moche period also runs through the site. 
Field research at Li ca pa II took place in 2010 and, for this study, focused on architecture and ceramics. Only diagnostic ceramics were col­lected. These include rims, bases, decorated body sherds, molds, instruments, and figurines. Com­plete and fragmentary yet identifiable vessels

were recorded in the same way as sherds. All non-diagnostic sherds were left onsite. For each of the sherds, 39 attributes were recorded (Koons 2012:Appendix B.l). Nonetheless, for the purpose of this article, the types of wares present and their spatial distribution are the main interest. 
In addition, 26 samples of charcoal for radio­carbon analysis were collected to contextualize the ceramics and architecture at the site and to chronologically compare Licapa II to other Moche sites. All dates presented in this article were cali­brated with OxCal4.2 software (Bronk Ramsey 2009) using the ShCall3 calibration curve (Hogg et al. 2013) . Information about the radiocarbon samples and their context is shown in Table 1. 
Huaca A 
Architecture and Chronology. Huaca A has a stepped and elongated eastern fa9ade . The other three sides consist of steep and narrow steps, making them appear almost vertical (Figure 3). Excavations in the northwest comer (Unit 1 in Figure 2) and along the eastern fa9ade (Unit 2 in Figures 2 and 3) revealed that the structure com­prises at least two buildings. The earliest date from Huaca A, cal A.D. 475-582 (AA94806) , comes from the lowest excavated floor in the structure (Floor 4C; see Koons 2012). Lower floors may exist that were not reached in 2010. The remaining dates cluster between cal A.D. 550 and 650 (Table 1). When these are compared with dates obtained from other site sectors using Bayesian statistical methods, as is discussed in detail below, they demonstrate that Huaca A is the oldest structure on the site. Ceramic data con­firm this chronological placement. 
Ceramics. Of the 580 sherds recovered from both units and all levels of Huaca A, 323 were utilitarian wares. Midgrade and fine wares ac­count for the remaining 257 sherds. The most abundant diagnostic ceramic from Huaca A is a style I call Licapa A, which is first defined here. This ceramic style is characterized by a thick or­ange paste with large temper and thick cream slip (Figure 4). In addition to paste, the forms of Li­capa A vessels are also distinct and include gob­lets, a large basin, and a large paica (storage con­tainer) of an atypical Moche form (Figure 4a). At least 73 sherds of this style were recovered. More may be present in the Licapa II sample, but this cannot be determined until a closer ex­amination of the pastes of the non-decorated sherds is conducted. Petrographic analysis shows that pastes used for Licapa A ceramics are similar to pastes from the ceramic workshop at Cerro Mayal, also in the Chicama Valley (Koons 2015). Although no Licapa A ceramics were recovered at the workshbp, this suggests that the Licapa A paste is local to the Chicama Valley. 
As discussed below, Moche IV and V fineline ceramics are abundant throughout the rest of the site. Nonetheless, only 15 Moche IV and V fine­lines and 11 stirrups were found associated with Huaca A, and all were in the uppermost rubble levels. This suggests that Moche IV and V fine­lines were introduced to the site after the main use phase of Huaca A ended around A .D. 650. 
Significance. Huaca A likely was an important ceremonial structure in the Chicama Valley from at leastA.D. 475 toA.D. 650.A burial of a female was found in the eastern elongated side of the huaca (Figure 5). Above her was a series of su­perimposed offerings of textiles, ceramics, llama, and cuy (guinea pig) . In a looter's tunnel that burrowed below the burial, one complete goblet with a stylized bird motif was recovered and frag­ments from at least eight others were also found (Figure 4d). It is possible that these goblets were from a looted tomb deeper inside the huaca and below the series of offerings-the female burial being one of these offerings. Placing superim­posed offerings above an elite tomb is a common Moche practice (see Castillo 2011; Millaire 2002; Tufinio 2004:35-38). Likewise, the majority of goblets with known provenience come from tombs. 
Although unique in form, the goblets have rat­tle bases similar to those seen in fineline drawings of the Sacrifice Ceremony and excavated else­where (see Castillo 2001; Donnan and McClel­land 1999) . The Sacrifice Ceremony is known from painted scenes found mainly on Moche IV fineline ceramic vessels and involves anthropo­morphized objects and animals slitting the throats of prisoners and filling up goblets with their blood (Donnan 2010:48; Donnan and McClelland 1999). The blood is then given to the priestess and another participant to be presented to two presumably higher-level priests. Although the goblets themselves do not necessarily indicate

the performance of this ceremony on Huaca A, the shape and form of the huaca support this ar­gument. A huaca with similar terracing and one elongated side is seen in a rollout drawing from a Moche vessel (Figure 6). The depiction of an elite individual with a goblet seated atop the huaca may hint at the kinds of ceremonies per­formed on structures like Huaca A. 
Overall, radiocarbon dates and architectural and ceramic evidence indicate that Huaca A was a highly visible structure probably used for events like the Sacrifice Ceremony prior to A.D. 650. This contrasts with what is seen at Huaca B and the residential area to the south. The archaeolog­ical evidence is different and shows that these areas were mainly occupied after A.D. 650.

an elevated platform with a series of rooms or patios measuring approximately 65 m north-south by 50 m east-west. An adobe wall lines the west­ern side of the platform; no walls were found on the northern or eastern side. Compared to Huaca A, Huaca B appears to have been a much more private structure with restricted access. 
Radiocarbon dates obtained from Huaca B and the platform indicate that the structure was mainly in use after HuacaA. The four architectural dates range from cal A.D. 630 to 876. Three earlier dates, ranging from cal A.D . 431 to 649 (AA94820, AA94819, and Beta-302529; see Table 1) were obtained from materials found on sterile sand below the platform. These early dates suggest that there was some activity in the area prior to the construction of Huaca B. 
Ceramics. In total, 1,032 diagnostic ceramic sherds were recovered from all the excavated levels of Huaca B and the Huaca B platform. Of these, 271 were decorated fine wares. No Licapa A style ceramics were encountered in this part of the site. Twenty-eight of the 85 fine ceramics found on Huaca B itself (Unit 5 in Figure 2) were finelines and include figurative Moche IV, possibly Moche V, and Late Moche San Jose de Moro style. In ad­dition, a style of ceramics was found only on Huaca B that looks like an imitation of San Jose de Moro

Significance. Huaca B and its platform are very different from Huaca A. The divided and exclusive spaces of Huaca B attest to a less inclusive-or less visible-setting than that at Huaca A. The platform to the north of Huaca B was an extension and may have been more public than the huaca itself. The spaces were not resi­dential in nature; rather, they were likely used for some ceremonial or civic function. No evi­dence for households, either elite or commoner, was encountered. Food and drink preparation ac­tivities for large-scale ceremonies or events ap­
pear to have occurred on the platform. 
Residential Area 
Five levels of occupation between the two huacas followed a pattern suggestive of high-status res­idences (Unit 3 in Figure 2). Well-made adobe architecture, hearths, in situ paicas, a cuy pen, as well as combs, pendants, and ceramics of very high quality were found here.A total of2,160 di­agnostic ceramics were recovered from all occu­pation levels. Of these, 732 were decorated fine wares . At least 149 sherds were fineline Moche IV and V styles . Significantly, Moche IV and V were found together with no stratigraphic or tem­poral distinction, making Licapa II the first site at which they have been encountered mixed. This discovery proves that the latter part of Larco's Moche I-V sequence is not chronologically ac­curate. Rather, it represents stylistic differences. 
This area of the site appears to have changed in purpose and function over time. After residen­tial use ceased, it was transformed into monu­mental space through the construction of a small platform. Materials directly associated with the small platform were hard to recover since the up­per levels of the site were so looted. The platform abutted the canal . This canal was also likely in use in earlier phases, given that its eastern wall appears to have been reused and incorporated into the later small platform, and the base of the canal was below the level of the base of the orig­inal wall. 
Site organization at Licapa II is similar to pat­terns seen at Huacas de Moche and El Brujo , 
where the area between the huacas was used for domestic and residential purposes. It is unknown whether this space was occupied on a permanent basis, temporarily inhabited at certain times of the month or year, or just used as a staging ground for ceremonies in association with the huacas. The fine ceramics found in association with do­mestic wares, hearths, and a cuy pen between the huacas suggest that these features were used for the preparation of food for ritual functions and were not just features of the everyday Licapa II houses. If people did live in this space perma­nently, then they could be considered upper class by Moche standards. They retained this same sta­tus through the five occupations in the area and until the small platform was built. Bayesian analy­sis, detailed below, indicates that the entire resi­dential sector postdates Huaca A and was mainly occupied after A.D. 650 (Koons 2012). 
Chronology of Licapa II 

To test the likelihood that Huaca A is older than Huaca B and the residential area, I set up a se­quential Bayesian model stating that the dates from Huaca A were from one phase that preceded another phase with the dates from Huaca B and the residential area. For this model I used only radiocarbon dates that were from annual materials and in direct association with Licapa A ceramics (Huaca A) and Moche IV and V ceramics (Huaca B and residential area dates).2 OxCal calculates the probability distribution of each individual date and then combines these distributions with the prior knowledge in a statistical statement (Bayliss et al. 2007; Bronk Ramsey 2009). The model needs to have an index of agreement of at least 60 percent. A low index of agreement can occur because a date is an outlier (due to displaced context or contamination) or because the assump­tions of the model (e.g., relative chronology) are incorrect. With an overall agreement index of 91.8%, the dates are consistent with the constraint that Huaca A precedes Huaca B and the residential area (Figure 7). This indicates that Huaca A was likely built before Huaca B and the residential area, but both sectors may have been in contem­poraneous use for some time. Nonetheless, be­cause calibration curve is not very precise in this period, the extent of the overlap in use remains unclear.

scenes of the Sacrifice Ceremony were directly associated with the huaca; rather, the physical goblets seen in paintings such as the one in Figure 6 were found. 
After A.D. 650, the residential area was occu­pied, and Huaca B was in its main phase of use. Huaca B was a less open structure than Huaca A and was associated with different activities, such as large-scale feasting involving ritual ceramics. With this expansion, Moche IV and V ceramics were introduced at the site, which brought a new way of expressing Moche religion. Late Moche ceramics were also introduced, although in small quantities. The portable objects now depicted im­ages in fine line of the ceremonies that were once likely performed on Huaca A. Nonetheless, no Moche IV fineline goblets or other ceremonial accoutrements were found. This may indicate that this type of ceremony was no longer performed at Licapa II; yet it was still commemorated through activities such as feasting, as is evidenced by the increase in food storage and serving ves­sels, as well as by the plethora of highly charged ritual ceramics. The different practices that oc­curred in these two sectors of the site and the dif­ferent phases of use for these two sectors suggest that an ideological shift occurred at the site some­time around A.D. 650. 
Licapa II in the Moche World 
Ceramics 
Ceramic and radiocarbon data from Licapa II clarify Moche ceramic chronology (Koons and Alex 2014). Although Licapa II was not occupied for the entire duration of Moche society, impor­tant changes in social structure are inferred based on the evidence from the site. Prior to A.D. 650, Licapa II was characterized by Licapa A ceramics. An analysis of radiocarbon dates indicates that this style was contemporaneous with Moche III and IV at Huacas de Moche and El Brujo (Koons and Alex 2014:Figure 2). Around A.D. 650, a major shift occurred at the site. This shift is seen at other Moche sites starting around A.D. 600. This date corresponds with the purported closing of Huaca de la Luna, where Moche IV ceramics were adopted for the final phase of use only around A.D. 500-550 (Uceda 2010).Also around A.D. 600-650 Moche IV ceramics were intro­duced at El Brujo and the final huaca was con­structed to mirror Huaca de la Luna (Mujica 2007). Prior to this time, the material culture of El Brujo was more akin to that at Early Moche sites, such as Dos Cabezas in the Jequetepeque Valley (Donnan 2007) . Data from Licapa II indi­cate that Moche IV ceramics were introduced at the site around A.D. 650-the same time the site was expanded to include Huaca B and the resi­dential area. 
The initial spread of Moche IV reconfigured north coast ideology around A.D. 600. The Moche IV style persisted as the dominant style at Huacas de Moche and at sites in the Santa Valley and other southern valleys until A.D. 800-850 (Chapdelaine 2001, 2008, 2010a, 2011; Uceda 2010) . Nonetheless, the Moche IV phenomenon was quickly reinterpreted in additional locales, as discussed below, and from these emerged the Moche V and Late Moche styles beginning around A.D. 650 (Koons and Alex 2014). 
The contemporaneity of Moche IV and V has been noted by scholars since the publication of dates in the ninth century A.D. for Moche IV from Huacas de Moche (Chapdelaine 2001; Uceda et al. 2001; Uceda et al. 2007) . Nonethe­less, prior to work at Licapa II, there was no de­finitive evidence that these two styles were in use together at a single site. Although there are no dates available from other Moche V sites in the Chicama Valley, numerous examples of Moche V pottery exist in the Larco Museum that all come from this region and are strikingly sim­ilar to the ceramics found at Licapa II. Sites with Moche V materials in the Larco collection include Paijan, Facala, Santa Ana, Mocan, and Tchufn, all located in the northern Chicama Valley (see Figure 2). 
The Moche V style outside of the Chicama Valley is encountered only at a handful of sites and in isolated surface finds. In the southern Je­quetepeque Valley, just north of Licapa II (Figure 1), sites such as Pacatnamu (Ubbelohde-Doering 1958) and Huaca Colorada (Swenson and Warner 2012) have geometric and figurative Moche V fragments. The phase corresponding to the use of Moche V at Pacatnamu was not dated. The 14C dates for Huaca Colorada show that it was occupied between cal A.D. 600 and 800 (Swenson

and Warner 2012) . Edward Swenson and John 
Warner (2012) found many examples of Moche 
V sherds when they performed a reconnaissance 
survey south of Huaca Colorada on the Pampa 
de Paijan, which is geographically between Li­
capa II and Huaca Colorada. They also noted 
roads in this region, suggesting a connection be­
tween the northern Chicama and southern Je­
quetepeque when Moche V was in use. Further 
to the north, Pampa Grande (Shimada 1994) has 
geometric Moche V and Late Moche fineline 
sherds (Johnson 2010). Dates associated with 
these materials were first reported by Shimada 
(1994). Koons and Alex (2014) recalibrated these 
dates using the Sh Cal 13 curve and show that the 
Moche V dates range from cal AD. 683 to 805. 
There also are some examples of isolated Moc he 
V finds, such as one sherd found on Cerro Chepen 
in the Jequetepeque Valley, but these are rare. 
To the south of Licapa II, Galindo also con­tained examples of Moche V sherds (Bawden 1977; Lockard 2005, 2009). The majority of the dates from the Moche occupation at Galindo range between cal AD. 673 and 764, which is after the adoption of Moche V at Licapa II (see Koons and Alex 20 14) . Moc he V has also been found along roads between the Chao and Santa valleys (Figure 1), suggesting that there was some movement further south (Pimentel and Paredes 
2003), but the evidence in other southern valleys is sparse to nonexistent. 

Moche V ceramics are not found at Huacas de Moche, and the Moche V presence at El Brujo is poorly documented. Nonetheless, Moche V wares have been found in the residential areas known as Las Tinajas and Paradones, but this information has not been fully published (Mujica 2007). A few examples of Moche V have also been found in the fill of the final phase of Huaca Cao Viejo at El Brujo and suggest that the huaca had been abandoned and interred prior to the adoption of this ware at the site. Huaca Cortada, the other Moche huaca at El Brujo, has not been excavated. 
The abundance of Moche V sherds and vessels in the northern Chicama Valley, along with the early dates for this style from Licapa II (AA94823; cal A.D. 630-675) , suggest that Moche V was developed and first produced in the northern Chicama Valley, possibly around Li­capa II. From here the style spread north and south around A.D. 650 (Castillo 2009; Cole 2012). The adoption of Moche V wares by some sites and not others in the northern and southern regions possibly relates to shared political, reli­gious, social, ethnic, or kin relationships among people at these disparate centers and indicates that affiliations after AD. 600-650 in the Moche world were quite dynamic and complex. No Moche V workshops have been found in the northern Chicama Valley, but the hypothesis is that future research will confirm that Moche V originated here . 
I note that the ceramics at Licapa II that were brought to the site from the north are easily iden­tifiable. A recent petrographic study of Moche IV, Moche V, and Late Moche ceramics from the Moche, Chicama, and Jequetepeque valleys showed that differences in mineral inclusions in­dicate that sources local to each valley were being exploited (Koons 20 15). 

Research on northern and southern Moche ce­ramics has shown that what was once thought to be a monolithic Moche style is actually a series of substyles or regional styles related to a shared religious ideology (Benson 2003; Cole 2012; Donnan 2011). Research from Licapa II builds on this argument and confirms that Moche IV and V are themselves distinct styles. Nonetheless, these styles do postdate Moche I/II and III, which also are contemporary (Koons and Alex 2014). This research further supports the conclusion that the Larco sequence should no longer be consid­ered to represent progressive temporal phases of Moche ceramic technological development. 
No other site to date has been excavated with Moche IV and V styles in such abundance. Fur­thermore, evidence for Late Moche ceramics at Licapa II and Moche V ceramics in the Jequete­peque Valley demonstrates the need to rethink the notion of boundaries such as the Pampa de Paijan desert (Figure 1). We need to consider the movement that occurred across the desert that led to people at Licapa II using and developing multiple ceramic forms and participating in a dy­namic sociopolitical landscape. 
Architecture 
Licapa II has a layout similar to Huacas de Moche and El Brujo. It has two major huacas and a res­idential component between two huacas.

Koons] MOCHE SOCIOPOLITICAL DYNAMICS AND THE ROLE OF LICAPA II 
Nonetheless, Licapa II is different than El Brujo and Huacas de Moche in several ways. First, the huacas themselves are less than half the size of the huacas at the large centers . Second, the forms of the huacas at Licapa II are distinct and not di­rectly comparable to El Brujo, Huacas de Moche, or any other studied Moche huaca. Third, at El Brujo and Huacas de Moche, a distance of 500 m separates the two huacas, whereas there are only 300 m between Huaca A and Huaca B at Li­capa II. Fourth , the north-facing fac;ades of the final buildings at Huaca Cao Viejo and Huaca de la Luna display the same elaborate mural pro­gram , which confirms ideological ties between the two sites. This mural program is not seen at any other Moche site, including Licapa IL Finally, the offset of the two huacas at Licapa II is differ­ent from the offset at the large sites. At both El Brujo and Huacas de Moche, the northernmost huaca is located to the northwest of the south­ernmost huaca at an angle of roughly 310°. At Licapa II the huacas are offset by 29° and the northern huaca, Huaca A, is located to the north­east of Huaca B. The layout of Licapa II is unlike any other studied and published Moche site and therefore may prove to be unique to the site itself . This may be related to the fact that it was oriented with specific landscape features (Makowski 2008, 20 IO; Zighelboim 1995). The basic orientation of the site (Huaca A to Huaca B) follows the base of the imposing Cerro Azul immediately to the west, suggesting that the placement of the huacas was deliberate. The huacas are also oriented to­ward the Quebrada de Cupisnique, the main ac­cess between the Chicama Valley and the high­lands. The angle of the architecture-24° east of north-also may have had celestial significance (see Seoane 2011). 
Although different in the ways outlined above, a similar shift in use patterns is apparent at Licapa II and Huacas de Moche. Huaca A and Huaca de la Luna were the first structures at the sites and both appear to have been dedicated to worship aspects of the Moche religion. Nonetheless, both ceased to be used for religious ceremonies some­time around A.D. 600-650. It was also around this time that Huaca B and Huaca del Sol became the prominent huacas at their respective sites. The spaces associated with Huaca B are compa­rable to those seen at Huaca del Sol (Tufinio et al. 2012). These include public spaces for cere­monies and feasts as well as restricted-access ar­eas. It was also after A.D. 600-650 when the do­mestic area between the huacas was first occupied at both sites. Chapdelaine (2002) interprets this change at Huacas de Moche as evidence for an increase in the power of the urban class. Overall, the changes through time seen at Licapa II, from the construction of Huaca A to that of Huaca B, reflect a similar pattern seen at Huacas de Moche. 
Earlier sites (prior to A.D. 600-650) contain large, highly visible huacas and large plazas. These huacas were the center of all political and religious activity at the site. As noted, many of the earlier Moche huacas were stepped platforms that increasingly grew in size through the super­imposition of buildings. Uceda and Tufinio (2003) have noted that each building at Huaca de la Luna was interred as a way to renew the power of the huaca. Burials are found in the fill of each build­ing, possibly as offerings to the huaca itself or to the deceased or new ruler. Architecture played an active role in the production and reproduction of social and political life and stood as a monu­ment to the past and a symbol of the present au­thority. The pre-A.D. 650 date of HuacaA, along with the offerings and possible burial within this huaca, suggest a similar function. Huaca A was tied into the pre-A.D. 600-650 ideology exem­plified by other sites throughout the Moche world. 
Later sites (after A.D. 600-650) include huacas but also incorporate other architectural features, such as platform structures with multiple rooms, extensive restrictive residential architecture, cor­ridors that limit open movement, and storage areas (Bawden 1977; Shimada 1994). It has been sug­gested that these additional types of architecture were housing for the more bureaucratic and less religious arm of society (Bawden 1977; Uceda and Tufinio 2003) . Whereas religious and political activities were blurred and undertaken in the same structure in earlier times, a more strict division existed between the religious and the political later on. Therefore, the addition of these features has been interpreted as the result of increased so­cial segregation and secularization (Bawden 1977; Chapdelaine 2001, 2002; Uceda 201 O; Uceda and Tufino 2003). Many scholars have noted that Moche architecture consisted of more restricted spaces through time (Bawden 1977; Chapdelaine

2002; Hecker and Hecker 1985; Moore 1996; Shi­mada 1994; Swenson 2011) . Swenson notes that while huacas from earlier phases grew outward and larger, the later structure of Huaca Colorada in the Jequetepeque Valley retracted inward, with increasingly narrow spaces and restricted access. The same pattern of narrowing of spaces was noted for Huaca B at Licapa II. 
The patterns noted between early and late Moche sites are present for the two different phases of Licapa II. These patterns indicate that a change in the political or religious structure oc­curred at many sites around A.D. 600-650. It should be noted that the changes in Moche soci­ety, as reflected in the use of different artifacts, did not occur uniformly. Different types of mate­rial culture were adopted at different sites at dif­ferent times . This is further evidence of the dy­namic nature of Moche sociopolitical structure . 
Conclusion 
Licapa II, a midsized Moche ceremonial center located on the northern boundary of the southern Moche region, provides an excellent case study for understanding inter-and intra-site dynamics in the Moche world both before and after a major ideological transition occurred ca. A.D. 600-650. Research at Licapa II has helped to achieve three major goals: (1) to examine changing Moche set­tlement dynamics through time; (2) to better un­derstand the relationships between the two regions; and (3) to address the role of settlements of differ­ent sizes, specifically in the southern region. 
AroundA.D. 600-650, significant changes oc­curred not only at the site itself but also through­out the Moche world. One of these changes was the introduction of Moche IV ceramics outside Huacas de Moche and the quick development of Moche V, possibly in the northern Chicama Valley and around Licapa II. Architectural changes also occurred at the same time. Both at Licapa II and elsewhere, highly visible structures were aban­doned in favor of more intimate architecture with restricted spaces. This shift in architecture and ceramic styles may indicate a change in Moche ideology. The next major step is to further inves­tigate the catalysts for these changes. 
In addition to the popular theory that environ­mental instability led to internal strife (Bawden 1996; Dillehay and Kolata 2004; Moseley and Deeds 1982; Moseley et al. 2008; Shimada 1994), the question of foreign influence has recently be­come more prominent. Wari presence on the north coast has been noted for a long time, but Wari in­fluence over Moche society remains one of the biggest questions in Andean Middle Horizon 
(A.D. 600-1000) archaeology. Castillo et al . (2012) note the same multidimensionality of Moche society that I explore here at the onset of the Middle Horizon. Their argument is that Moche was not one polity, settlement, state, or society, and the influences of Wari and other foreigners on the Moche were just as varied and complex as any other influence. Foreigners did not come in and conquer the Moche; rather, they formed rela­tionships with certain polities and sites. Chapde­laine (20 lOb) notes that these foreign groups were likely the source of exotic knowledge that was incorporated into the politics and ideology of the different Moche polities to varying degrees. In fact, although Moche and other Andean societies were contemporaneous, very little evidence of foreign materials at Moche sites exists in the ar­chaeological record (Castillo et al. 2012). 
There are a few exceptions . A double-spout and bridge vessel in the central coast style and a possible Chancay figurine foot were recovered at Licapa II. How these relate to the Moche oc­cupation remains unknown. At San Jose de Moro, Wari influence is seen in the ceramics found in burials. After the initial introduction of Wari Chakipampa wares, a hybrid Moche-Wari poly­chrome style was developed and used for a short period of time (Castillo et al. 2012). I noted this style in the Chicama Valley while doing recon­naissance work on the back side of Cerro Mo­collope. A single polychrome sherd was also re­covered from inside the canal at Licapa II. Many Wari ceramics were recently found at Huacas de Moche, also in burials (Santiago Uceda, personal communication 2013), indicating that we have much to learn about the relationship between these two cultures and the potential influence Wari had over Moche politics and ideology around A.D. 600-650. 
In addition to Wari, other local valley highland groups interacted with Moche polities and would undoubtedly have had influence on political de­velopments (Billman 1996; Lau 2004; Ringberg

Koons] MOCHE SOCIOPOLITICAL DYNAMICS AND THE ROLE OF LICAPA II 
2012; Vogel 2012). Defensive structures and out­posts have been noted in the "buffer zones" be­tween highland and lowland peoples (Lau 2004; Proulx 1985; Topic and Topic 1983; Vogel 2012; Wilson 1988). The headwaters of coastal canal systems were also located in the upper and middle valleys. Maria Rostworowski (1990:450) notes that in the colonial era each valley had its own highland-coastal relationship that was unique to the hydrology and internal politics of that valley. This topic merits much more attention for the Moche period, especially in the Chicama Valley, where highland-coastal relations are unstudied. This scenario may help explain the nuances and complexities we are beginning to see on the in­dividual valley level. Due to the multidimension­ality of Moche society, numerous and diverse factors likely catalyzed the changes that are ap­parent in the archaeological record around A.D. 600-650. 
Through analyses of ceramics, architecture, and radiocarbon dates, I have shown that Licapa II was likely an independent center intimately connected to a dynamic landscape of interrelated nodes in an ever-changing and complex network of sites. In this network, alliances and relation­ships crosscut the northern and southern Moche boundary, which needs to be reevaluated. We should reconsider the way that ideas, people, and artifacts moved across the landscape to create webs of sociopolitical alliances. 
Research at smaller Moche centers such as Licapa II challenges the idea of a traditional set­tlement hierarchy. The settlement patterns suggest a hierarchical yet decentralized system (Castillo et al. 2012; Giersz 2011; Makowski 1994, 2010). This research demonstrates that small centers could have been the locus of innovation, such as the development of Moche V, and were not nec­essarily under the control of a larger center. More research at centers of various sizes, along with more contextualized radiocarbon dates, will deepen our understanding of how the people re­siding at the different Moche centers interacted 
with each other through time .

Notes 
I. The site was not occupied during the earliest known phases of Moche, A.D. 200-400. Therefore, data from Licapa II cannot aid in understanding the development of Moche in this valley or elsewhere. 
2. Beta Analytic consistently produced dates later than those processed by the NSF-Arizona laboratory, even when portions of the same material were sent to the two labs. This is troubling and suggests that different protocols were used. For accuracy, I chose to use only the NSF dates in my Bayesian models, given that these dates were consistently more compa­rable to dates from other Moche contexts and sites (see Koons and Alex 2014).
