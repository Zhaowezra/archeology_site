RECONSIDERING THE OCAMPO CAVES AND THE 
ERA OF INCIPIEN T CULTI VATION IN MESOAMERICA 

Bruce D. Smith 
In northeastern Mexico, near Ocampo, Romero's and Valenzuela's caves have been central to explanations of agricultural origins in Mesoamerica for more than four decades. Along with caves in Tehuacdn and Oaxaca, these "Ocampo caves" have provided almost all of the available evidence for the initial appearance of a number of key Mesoamerican crop plants, includ­ing maize, beans, and squash. This article reanalyzes the cultural and temporal context of.five crop plant assemblages in the Ocampo caves: maize (Zea mays), bottle gourd ( lagenaria siceraria), and three species of squash ( Cucurbita argyrosperma, 
C. moschata, C. pepo ). Fifteen AMS radiocarbon dates on early domesticates both confirm the stratigraphic integrity of the two caves and substantially revise the temporal framework for initial appearance of core domesticates in northeastern Mexico, showing the transition to food production in Tamaulipas took place more recently than previously thought. A sub­stantially foreshortened chronology for Ocampo crop plants confirms the northern periphery role of Tamaulipas in the ori­gins of agriculture in Mexico, while also underscoring the need for establishing AMS-based archaeobotanical sequences across Mesoamerica to gain an adequate context.for understanding the temporal, environmental, and cultural contexts of ini­tial plant domestication in the region. 

Situadas cerca de Ocampo, Tamaulipas, en el noreste de Mexico, las cuevas de Romero y Valenzuela fueron las mas impor­tantes para abordar las explicaciones sobre Los origenes de la agricultura en Mesoamerica por mas de cuatro decadas. ]unto con las cuevas de San Marcos y Coxcatldn en Tehuacdn y la cueva de Guild Naquitz en Oaxaca, estas "cuevas de Ocampo" han proporcionado casi toda la evidencia disponible desde el comienzo de la domesticacion de numerosas plantas, incluyendo maiz, frijol y calabaza. Este articulo reanaliza las dimensiones culturales y temporales de cinco plantas de cosecha de las cuevas de Ocampo: maiz (Zea mays), calabaza vinatera (lagenaria siceraria), y tres especias de calabaza (Cucurbita argyrosperma, C. moschata, C. pepo). Quince fechas de radiocarbono obtenidas por acelerdor de Los cultigenos confirman la integridad estrategrdfica de las dos cuevas, y revisa considerablemente la dimension temporal de la aparicion inicial de las principales plantas domesticas en noreste Mexico. la transicion hacia la produccion de alimentos en Tamaulipas demuestra que este proceso se presento en tiempos mas recientes de lo que se pensaba. lnicialmente presentada en la cronologia de Ocampo desde 9000 a.P., por exemplo, Lagenaria siceraria y Cucurbita pepo no aparecen en la ocu­pacion de las cuevas hasta 4400-4000 a.C. (fechas calibradas). Cucurbita argyrosperma estd presente desde 3000 a.C. (fechas calibradas), el maiz desde 2400 a. C. (fechas calibradas), y la Cucurbita moschata desde 800 a.C. (fechas calibradas). Esta cronologia recortada de plantas de Ocampo confirma el papel que tuvo la periferia norte de Tamaulipas en el origen de la agricultura en Mexico. al mismo tiempo que subraya la necesidad de establecer bases de secuencias arqueobotdnicas fechadas por acelerador en toda Mesoamerica, para entender suficientemente el contexto temporal, medioambiental y cul­
tural de la domesticacion inicial de la region.

chronological, and cultural contexts of early Mesoamerican food-producing societies (Fritz 1994a, 1994b; McClung de Tapia 1992, 1994; Smith l 995a, l 995b). This article extends the reassessment of existing collections of early Mesoamerican domesticates by reconsidering the maize (Zea mays) and cucurbit (Lagenaria sicer­aria, Cucurbita argyrosperma, C. moschata, C. pepo) materials recovered from Romero's and Valenzuela's caves near Ocampo, Tamaulipas, in 
1954. 
Before turning to a discussion of these five species, however, and the temporal and cultural context of their initial occurrence in Romero's and Valenzuela's caves, it is important to look at the central role that these Ocampo caves played in the first efforts to account for Mesoamerican agri­cultural origins. In a major synthetic article pub­lished in 1964, for example, the Ocampo caves provided the bulk of the information then avail­able on the origins of agriculture in Middle America (Mangelsdorf et al. 1964). Even as this 1964 synthesis appeared in print, however, research and attention had already shifted from Tamaulipas to the Central Highlands of Mexico. MacNeish and others (e.g., Mangelsdorf et al. 1964:431-432) had concluded that Tamaulipas and the Ocampo caves were on the northern periphery of agricultural origins in Mesoamerica and had turned their attention farther south, where subsequent research in Puebla (Tehuacan) and 
then Oaxaca in fact did indicate an apparent ear­lier appearance of many domesticated crop plants in those regions. In addition to having apparent temporal and geographical precedence over the Ocampo caves, the Tehuacan caves and Guila Naquitz were also the subject of extensive, detailed, and comprehensive publications, which provided the basis for interpretive overviews of Mesoamerican agricultural origins (e.g., Flannery 1973, 1986; MacNeish 1967, 1991). 
Even though by the mid-l 960s the Ocampo

caves of Tamaulipas had been both overshadowed by excavations in Tehuacan and Oaxaca, and placed far to the north of the central and southern highland "hearth" area of plant domestication, Romero's and Valenzuela's caves still played an important role in shaping the general account of agricultural origins in Mesoamerica formulated during the 1960s, which can be termed the Era of Incipient Cultivation explanation. This explana­tion was based in large part on a comparison of the Tehuacan and Tamaulipas sequences and the timing and order of appearance of different crop plants in the two regions (Figure 2). 
The initial analysis of the archaeobotanical sequence of the Ocampo caves (Figure 2) sug­gested that several domesticated plants made a very early appearance in Tamaulipas, e.g., pump­kin ( Cucurbita pepo) and bottle gourd (Lagenaria siceraria) at 9000 to 7000 B.P.1 (Cutler and Whitaker 1961; Mangelsdorf et al. 1964:430; Whitaker et al. 1957:356). The common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) was added later, between 6000 and 4300 B.P. (Kaplan and MacNeish 1960: 44, 52, 54; Mangelsdorf et al. 1964:430), and maize was not present until around 4300-3800 
B.P. 
(Mangelsdorf et al. 1967a:33, 34). C. moschata followed at about 3800-3400 B.P. (Cutler and Whitaker 1961; Whitaker et al. 1957:356-357), and C. argyrosperma (then called 

C. 
mixta, see Merrick and Bates 1989) appeared at 1800-1100 B .P. (Whitaker et al. 1957:356-357), along with the sieva bean (Phaseolus lunatus) (Kaplan and MacNeish 1960:44, 55). 


This pattern in the Ocampo caves-of a few early domesticates followed by the appearance of other domesticated crops at widely spaced inter­vals-also was observed in the archaeobotanical sequence of the Tehuacan caves, but the Tehuacan sequence differed considerably in terms of both the temporal spacing and the sequence of appear­ance of various species. In the Tehuacan Valley, five crop plants (bottle gourd, common bean, maize, and two squash species [C. moschata and 
C. argyrosperma]) first occurred in Coxcatlan­phase zones (7000-5500 B.P.) in Coxcatlan and San Marcos caves (Figure 2). Within the 1,500­year span covered by the Coxcatlan phase, radio­carbon dates on materials associated with the bottle gourd and C. argyrosperma specimens that 
were recovered in zone XIII of Coxcatlan Cave (Cutler and Whitaker 1967:218) yielded a date of 7000 B.P. The earliest C. moschata (Cutler and Whitaker 1967:214, 218) and common bean spec­imens occurred in zone XI of the same cave (Kaplan 1967:204). Four radiocarbon dates from this zone were averaged to 6070 B.P. (Johnson and MacNeish 1972: 17). The earliest maize, assigned wild status at the time (Mangelsdorf et al. 1967b:180), was recovered from zones E and F of San Marcos cave, with zone E providing a radiocarbon date of 6100 B.P. The underlying zone F was thought to represent "only a very slightly earlier part of the Coxcatlan Phase" (Mangelsdorf et al. 1967b:179). Just above zone E, zone D in San Marcos cave yielded both a radiocarbon date of 5300 B.P. (Johnson and MacNeish 1972:23) and an assemblage of larger maize cobs identified as "early cultivated" (Mangelsdorf et al. 1967b:181). Following maize in the Tehuacan archaeobotanical sequence, C. 
pepo appeared at 3500-2900 B.P. (Cutler and Whitaker 1967:215, 218; MacNeish 1967:294) and sieva bean (Phaseolus lunatus) at 1,300 to 400 years ago (Kaplan 1967:204-205). 
As shown in Figure 2, the original Ocampo and Tehuacan archaeobotanical sequences, for­mulated in the 1950s and 1960s, were quite dif­ferent in terms of when various crop plants made their initial appearance in the two regions. They did fit fairly comfortably, however, with what was thought at the time regarding where different plants were likely first brought under domestica­tion, based on known areas of species distribution and greatest diversity of modern cultivars. Cultivated Cucurbita pepo, for example, exhib­ited little present-day cultivar diversity in south­ern Mexico and was far more variable to the north (Cutler and Whitaker 1967:219); the earliest evi­dence for its domestication came froni the Ocampo caves, leading MacNeish to conclude that "considerable evidence indicates that it was first domesticated in Tamaulipas between 7000 and 5500 B.C." and subsequently spread north­west into the southwestern United States by 2500 to 1000 B.C. and south to Tehuacan, arriving there about 1000 B.C. (MacNeish 1967:294). In contrast, Cutler and Whitaker (1967:219) and MacNeish (1967:293) considered the heartland of domestication of C. moschata to be in warm

A comparison of the archaeobotanical sequences from the Ocampo and Tehuacan caves, as originally con­structed in the 1950s and 1960s, showing ·the estimated initial appearance of different species of domesticated plants (based on Cutler and Whitaker 1961, 1967; Johnson and MacNeish 1972; Kaplan 1967; Kaplan and MacNeish 1960; MacNeish 1967; Mangelsdorf et al. 1967a, 1967b; Mangelsdorf et al. 1964; Whitaker et al. 1957). 
coastal regions south of Tehuacan. MacNeish (1 967:293) also proposed that, based on modern distributional patterns, Phaseolus vulgaris arrived in both Tehuacan and Tamaulipas at about the same time, after being first domesticated in an area west of both regions. The Tehuacan Valley, on the other hand, was situated in an area of con­siderable variability of modern cultivar forms of Cucurbita argyrosperma; given its early appear­ance in the region's archaeobotanical sequence, Cutler and Whitaker (1967:218) and MacNeish (1967:293) suggested that C. argyrosperma was first brought under domestication near the Tehuacan region. Finally, Tehuacan also was con­sidered as a likely heartland for the initial domes­tication of maize (MacNeish 1967:294), since it 
(1) offered a habitat that "may in fact have been almost ideal for wild com" (Mangelsdorf et al. 

1967b: 178); (2) had produced "the first ears of wild maize so far discovered" (Mangelsdorf et al. l 967b:180), as well as (3) very primitive cobs of "early cultivated" maize (Mangelsdorf et al. 1967b:l 81), which predated the appearance of maize in the Ocampo caves by more than 1,000 years (Figure 2). 

Era of Incipient Cultivation Explanation 

All of these observed differences between the Tamaulipas and Tehuacan archaeobotanical sequences in terms of the timing, sequence, and temporal spacing of the first appearance of key domesticates, and the degree to which they fit comfortably with available information regarding the likely geographical areas of their initial domestication, led directly to two more general conclusions regarding the initial domestication of plants in Mesoamerica. These two conclusions, derived directly from the comparative analysis of

the Tamaulipas and Tehuacan caves, became the twin central themes used to characterize agricul­tural origins in Mesoamerica and to further define the Era of Incipient Cultivation in the region.2 
The first of the central themes of the Era of Incipient Cultivation explanation of agricultural origins in Mesoamerica involves the temporal and spatial isolation of domestication of different plant species. The Ocampo and Tehuacan sequences appeared to show that each of the key domesticates had its own separate history of domestication-that maize, squashes, and beans were independently domesticated in different regions of Mexico at different times. As early as 1957, for example, based on the late appearance of maize in the Ocampo sequence, Whitaker et al. (1957:357) would conclude that: "These ... observations are significant because they suggest that com and the three squash species did not originate at the same place, or if they did originate in the same area, that they were not domesticated simultaneously. " 
Writing a decade later, after the Tehuacan caves had been excavated and a com­parative analysis of the Tehuacan and Tamaulipas sequences had been carried out, MacNeish (1967:295) was able to draw an even more sweeping conclusion: "There was no single uni­linear development of agriculture in any hearth or hearths but a series of small developments of plant domestication in many regions that stimu­lated and contributed to the evolution of agricul­ture over a wide area." 
The second central theme of the Era of Incipient Cultivation explanation of Meso­american agricultural origins is that, within these different regions of Mesoamerica, a long period of low-level "incipient" reliance on cultivated plants could be recognized during which only a few, mostly local, crops were grown in regionally specialized economies by societies still based largely on hunting and gathering economies (Mangelsdorf et al. 1964:432). This era of "incip­ient cultivation" and regionally specialized economies, extending from around 9000-4000 B.P., also was viewed as a five-millennia-long "period of transition from food collecting to sedentary agriculture" (Flannery 1968:68), during which cultivated plants gradually became increas­ingly important in economic systems (Flannery 1968:68; Mangelsdorf et al. 1964:427, 431, 432). 
Estimates for the gradual increase in importance 
of domesticated plants through the 5,000-year­
long period of incipient cultivation have been 
offered for both Tehuacan (MacNeish 1967:301) 
and Tamaulipas (Mangelsdorf et al. 1964:431). 
This transitional era of incipient cultivation ended 
by about 4000 B.P., with the coalescence of a 
Mesoamerican crop complex composed of maize, 
beans, squashes, and chili peppers "that revolu­
tionized the whole nature of plant growing from a 
level of incipient cultivation to one of village 
agriculture" (Mangelsdorf et al. 1964:432). 
Kent Flannery's 1966 excavation of Guila Naquitz cave in Oaxaca (Flannery 1986) provided further evidence for the longevity of the era of incipient cultivation that led to the appearance of Mesoamerican village agricultural economies around 4000-3500 B.P. The early occupation lay­ers of Guila Naquitz (zones D-Bl) yielded radio­carbon dates of 9800 to 8500 B.P. (Flannery 1986:175), as well as more than 100 specimens of Cucurbita seeds, rinds, and peduncles (Whitaker and Cutler 1986). Most of these were believed to have come from a species of wild Cucurbita gourd, but nine seeds and six peduncle fragments, including a seed recovered from a zone D context that had been assigned an age of 9800 B.P., were identified as domesticated Cucurbita pepo (Whitaker and Cutler 1986). Seven rind frag­ments of bottle gourd also were recovered from zones D-Bl at Guila Naquitz. 
In addition to pushing the onset of the Era of Incipient Cultivation back to almost 10,000 B.P., the Early Holocene occupational episodes of Guila Naquitz also fit comfortably within, and provided support for, the general profile that had been developed for the incipient cultivator soci­eties of 9000--4000 B.P., based on earlier analyses of the Ocampo and Tehuacan caves. The Early Holocene habitation zones at Guila Naquitz pro­duced evidence of only two plant species identi­fied as domesticated (Cucurbita pepo and Lagenaria siceraria), which represented only a very minor element in an overall economy that was otherwise based entirely on wild species of plants and animals. Thus, even though the early pumpkin remains from Guila Naquitz indicated that C. pepo likely had been first domesticated in the Southern Highlands of Mexico rather than, as had been previously proposed, in northern

Mexico (Whitaker and Cutler 1986), Guila Naquitz still fit the general profile of an early, regionally specialized, food production economy based on the isolated and independent domestica­tion of a local plant species that initially played only a small economic role. Since Guila Naquitz is thought to have been occupied on a seasonal basis by a small single family group or "microband," it also provided further support for the characterization of typical societies during the Era of Incipient Cultivation as small seminomadic bands. 
By the close of the 1960s, then, all of the salient features of the Era of Incipient Cultivation had been identified and articulated, and it stood as the first general overall account or explanation for the origin of agriculture in Mesoamerica. In sum­mary, the essential elements of this explanatory framework were the following. 
Time-spanning the Archaic. Reaching across five to six millennia, the Era of Incipient Cultivation bridged much of the Early and Middle Holocene periods. It was anchored on the later end by the emergence of com-bean-squash crop complexes and village-based agricultural economies at 4000 B. P. and on the early end by the initial domestication of a number of plant species (cucurbits, maize, beans) at 10,000 to 7000 B.P. (Figure 2). 
Location-a central heartland vs. small paral­lel regional hearths. Although the Central and Southern Highlands of Mexico are, on the one hand, often mentioned as the center of plant domestication and agricultural origins during the Era of Incipient Cultivation, there is at the same time a strong emphasis on the geographically dis­persed nature of plant domestication-"of small developments of plant domestication in many regions"-that marked the parallel long-term existence of regionally specialized economies, each of which began with the domestication of one or several local crop plants. 
Pace of change-a gradual transition. The five­to-six-millennia-long Era of Incipient Cultivation was considered to be a period of slow transition and change during which the crop plants of vari­ous specialized regional economies were more widely dispersed and food production gradually increased from a minor role to gain greater over­all importance, with the broad-based coalescence 
of a Mesoamerican crop complex occurring by 

4000 B.P. 
Cultural context-small seasonally mobile families. Throughout much of the period from 10,000-4,000 B.P., the basic socioeconomic unit of incipient cultivator societies was the rnicroband, comprising one to three nuclear fam­ilies that relocated their settlements during differ­ent seasons of the year to take advantage of locally available wild resources. By 7000 B.P. a number of such rnicrobands were coalescing into larger macroband settlements during the seasons of greatest resource abundance; over time, the size and duration of such seasonal settlements gradually increased, as did reliance on stored agricultural crops. MacNeish (1972) provides a detailed summary of changing settlement and subsistence patterns in the Tehuacan Valley throughout the Era of Incipient Cultivation (see also MacNeish 1991). 
Many of the basic elements essential to an explanation of agricultural origins were included in the Era of Incipient Cultivation as it was for­mulated and refined during the 1960s. It identi­fied the first domesticated crop plants and provided hard evidence of where and when they were first brought under domestication, and it offered archaeological information regarding the cultural context and 5,000-to 6,000-year-long developmental trajectory of the transition from hunting and gathering to village-based agricul­ture. Attention and interest were rather quickly drawn away from the Era of Incipient Cultivation explanation of agricultural ongms 
in Mesoamerica, however, because of what it did not include-a consideration of process, of why agri­culture emerged in Mesoamerica. 
Processual Explanations 
At the moment we know a good deal about the order in which various plants were domesticated in several regions ... [of Mesoamerica]. We still do not know why they were domesticated, and it will certainly be a long time before we do [Flannery 1973:287]. 

In several landmark articles, Kent Flannery addressed this central processual question of why (Flannery 1968, 1973), and in so doing, opened up a broad new alternative perspective on explain­ing agricultural origins. Flannery's alternative approach employed systems theory and ecosys-

tern analysis in an effort to "see aspects of this prehistoric culture change which were not super­ficially apparent" (Flannery 1968:81). Combining knowledge of present-day plant and animal com­munities in the Central and Southern Highlands of Mexico with the Archaic period floral and fau­na! assemblages recovered from caves in Tehuacan and Oaxaca, he identified a set of six procurement systems employed by preceramic hunter-gatherer/incipient cultivator societies. These six procurement systems focused on "a small series of plant and animal genera whose ranges cross-cut several environments" (Flannery 1968:82): (1) maguey, (2) cactus fruit, (3) tree legumes, (4) white-tailed deer, (5) cottontail rab­bit, and (6) wild grasses. 

Flannery (1968:82-93) described the attributes and seasonal availability of the species included in these six procurement systems, as well as the technology, scheduling, and settlement patterns employed by hunter-gatherer/incipient cultivator societies in utilizing them. He also proposed that the initial transition to food production could be explained in terms of positive feedback and a deviation-amplifying process that dramatically expanded the importance of one of these procure­ment systems, that involving wild grasses. This dramatic expansion, which "caused one minor system to grow all out of proportion to the others, and eventually to change the whole ecosystem of the southern Mexican highlands" (Flannery 1968:94), began with early experiments with plant cultivation sometime between 7000 and 4000 B.P., a series of genetic
combined with changes in a few key genera that, acting as a "kick," allowed a deviation-amplifying system to be established: "Starting with what may have been (initially) accidental deviations in the sys­tem, a positive feedback network was established which eventually made maize cultivation the most profitable single subsistence activity in Mesoamerica" (Flannery 1968:95). 
Although Flannery focused on the expansion of the wild grasses procurement system, and the eventually central role to be played by maize in the farming economies of incipient cultivators, he also included beans in his explanation, noting both the nutritional advantages of combining the two crops, and the settlement-subsistence system changes necessitated by an increasing reliance on 
"early maize-bean cultivation" between 7000 and 
4000 B.P. (Flannery 1968:95-96). 
In his 1973 article, Flannery again focused pri­marily on maize, but also provided a longer list of early crop plants that were selected for cultiva­tion, including beans, squashes, amaranth, chiles, tomatoes, avocados, and numerous semitropical fruits (Flannery 1973:287). He also expanded his causal explanation in another direction by offer­ing a possible answer to the core question of why incipient cultivators first began selecting and planting maize: 
Highland Mesoamerica has great contrasts in wild productivity between wet and dry years. Cultivation might have arisen as an attempt to "even out" the dif­ference between these extremes by increasing the range of weedy, pioneer annuals, but we just don't know for sure. Whatever the cause, the origins of Zea cultivation amount to a deliberate increase in the availability of an "emergency ration"-one of the few that could be increased on a yearly basis [Flannery 1973:296). 
Teosinte, the wild ancestor of maize, in turn: "responded to cultivation and selection with a series of favorable genetic changes which moved it in the direction of maize. And this may have tipped the balance in favor of increased attention to the genus Zea on the part of man" (Flannery 1973:297). In his volume on Guila Naquitz, Flannery (1986) considerably refined and expanded the explanatory framework for Mesoamerican agricultural origins outlined in his 1968 and 1973 publications and employed it in a detailed consideration of the transition to food production in Oaxaca. 
In summary, Flannery's processual, causal explanation, focused and refined over the years, fell squarely within the larger cultural history/cul­ture process debate of the 1960s and 1970s in which explanatory frameworks such as the Era of Incipient Cultivation were recognized as provid­ing answers to a set of basic preliminary culture history questions, while setting the stage for the formulation of processual, causal explanations. Flannery's processual explanation for the origin of agriculture in Mesoamerica thus in large mea­sure both replaced and "covered" the earlier Era of Incipient Cultivation explanation and shifted it to a supporting role. 

This processual explanation, however, was not firmly anchored to the cultural-historical founda-

tion of "already answered" questions. While accommodating a number of its general elements, Flannery's account did not accept or rely on all of the specifics of the Era of Incipient Cultivation explanation and, in fact, took issue with it in a number of respects. Two of the most important general issues raised by Flannery had to do with the accuracy of age estimates for the initial appearance of domesticated crop plants and the criteria employed to identify such early archaeo­botanical specimens as domesticated plants. 
Flannery cautioned archaeologists about accepting the age assigned to early domesticates by: "sensation-seeking opportunists who were more concerned with finding the 'oldest domesti­cated plant' than with clarifying the processes by which agriculture began" (1973:271), and sug­gested that "When they [archaeologists] see a chart showing 'domestic beans' at 5000 B.C., and only one single cotyledon is indicated-separated by 2,000 years from the next oldest bean-they might take it with a grain of salt." Flannery also cautioned botanists regarding the various ways in which plant materials can be moved down through deposits: "I wish I could explain to every botanist that while an archaeologist looks the other way for one minute, a pack rat can bury an intrusive bean 50 centimeters deeper in his favorite dry cave" (Flannery 1973:272). In terms of assigning domesticated status to early plant materials, Flannery (1973:272) also questioned 
claims for domestication based on a single burned seed, a single trampled rind, or a single crumpled pod. In cases where the range of variation of the wild ances­tor was not known (in fact, even in cases where the actual species of wild ancestor was not known), we had prestigious botanists assigning a single crushed speci­men to a modern race-a race which in some cases may have taken thousands of years to stabilize. These were botanists who, under normal conditions, would have argued that nothing less than 100 specimens­with a mean and standard deviation-was an adequate sample, but perhaps the search for agricultural origins is not a normal condition. 

Citing Pickersgill, Flannery also raised the possibility that early bottle gourd (Lagenaria siceraria) remains in the Americas represent a long-established wild plant of the American trop­ics, rather than, by default, an introduced domes­ticated crop (Flannery 1973:303, 306). Caution 
. was similarly urged in assessing the domesticated 
status of early squash/pumpkin (Cucurbita) seeds 
recovered from Mesoamerican caves (Flannery 
1973:288). The scattered and isolated nature of 
these early specimens was noted, as was the 
potential difficulties involved in trying to distin­
guish the seeds of early domesticated Cucurbita 
from wild plants, given that the range of variation 
in seed size and shape in as yet unidentified wild 
ancestor species remains undocumented 
(Flannery 1973:300-301). 
In addition to raising questions regarding the true age and/or wild vs. domesticated status of early bottle gourd, bean, and squash specimens, Flannery also provided a lengthy overview of the debate surrounding the antiquity and identity of the wild ancestor of maize (Flannery 1973:290-300). Summarizing the views of George Beadle and Walton Galina!, Flannery 
joined them in concluding, for a variety of rea­sons, that teosinte is the wild ancestor of Zea mays, and that the early maize cobs from Tehuacan represent an early domesticated form of the crop plant rather than evidence for a "wild maize" progenitor. All of these concerns raised by Flannery can now be seen to have pointed to a number of promising research pathways. Almost two decades would pass, however, before these areas of inquiry identified by Flannery would be pursued. The analytical tools and approaches needed to address questions surrounding the actual age and domesticated status of early Mesoamerican crop plants, as well as the identity of their wild ancestors, had not yet been devel­oped. 
Recent Reconsideration of the Antiquity of 
Mesoamerican Domesticates 


Accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) radiocar­bon dating (Gowlett 1987) is the most important of the analytical advances made since Flannery's 1973 article. Increasingly employed in archaeol­ogy through the 1980s, AMS dating requires only very small samples. Since it allows small speci­mens of early crop plants to be dated directly and, therefore, bypasses all of the potential problems inherent in relying on conventional radiocarbon dates obtained on assumedly associated and con­temporary organic materials, it has clear and obvious applications to the issue of when plant species were initially domesticated.

AMS dating was not employed in a reconsid­eration of the actual age of any Mesoamerican domesticates until 1989 (Long et al. 1989), when a series of 12 AMS dates were obtained on the earliest maize cobs from Coxcatlan and San Marcos caves in Tehuacan. Initially dated to 7000 
B.P. based on conventional radiocarbon dates obtained on material from the same habitation layers (Figure 2), the earliest maize from Tehuacan proved to date only to 3500 cal B.C. In a parallel study (Benz and Iltis 1990), a detailed morphological analysis of the early cobs from San Marcos cave confirmed in detail earlier opin­ions (see Flannery 1973:293-294)-that the early Tehuacan maize represented a domesticated rather than a wild plant. 

Even though these two related studies focused on a single domesticate-maize-and a single region-Tehuacan-their results served to rekin­dle the concerns raised much earlier by Flannery regarding the actual age and domesticated status of early Mesoamerican crop plants, in general, and to draw attention to all of the associated tem­poral, geographical, and cultural aspects of the Era of Incipient Cultivation. If the early primitive maize from Tehuacan was not nearly as old as previously thought, for example, then perhaps other Mesoamerican crop plants also had a much shorter history of domestication. This in tum would call into question the long-term existence of distinct and regionally specialized economies in which a few local crop plants played minor roles in otherwise hunting-and-gathering economies. Perhaps the primary Mesoamerican domesticates-maize, squashes, pumpkins, and beans-were brought under domestication much closer together temporally (and geographically?), and were dispersed and combined into regional crop complexes much more rapidly and readily than previously thought. If the timetable of plant domestication in Mesoamerica was substantially shortened, it also would open up for reconsidera­tion the environmental and cultural contexts of initial cultivation. The search for new evidence of early agriculturalists would need to expand into different time periods and different environmen­tal and geographical settings (Fritz 1994a, 1994b; Smith 1995a, 1995b ). 
While rekindling the concerns raised by Flannery, and drawing attention back to the Era of 

Incipient Cultivation in Mesoamerica, the reanalysis of Tehuacan maize also underscored the obvious need for similar studies that would focus on other domesticated plant species and on the other already extant regional archaeobotanical sequences of Oaxaca and Tamaulipas. Kaplan has undertaken a research program to reconfirm mor­phological markers of domestication and to obtain direct AMS radiocarbon dates on early archaeological specimens of beans (Phaseolus) from Tamaulipas, Tehuacan, and throughout the Americas (Kaplan 1993, 1995). In a parallel man­ner, the present study reconsiders the archaeolog­ical evidence for the early history of five primary domesticates in the Ocampo caves of Tamaulipas: bottle gourd (Lagenaria siceraria), squash and pumpkin (C. pepo, C. moschata, C. argyros­perma), and maize (Zea mays). To better docu­ment the specific cultural and temporal context of the initial appearance and subsequent occurrence of each of these crop plants in the Ocampo caves, Romero's cave and Valenzuela's cave are consid­ered separately rather than together. Discussion of each cave begins with a brief summary character­ization of the number, nature, size, and duration of episodes of human habitation, along with the associated excavation level, occupation number, cultural zone, and temporal/cultural phase assign­ments made by the cave's excavators. These cul­tural/stratigraphic overviews are compiled from a number of published articles, as well as archived field notes and reports (i.e., Kelley 1954a, 1954b; MacNeish 1954a, 1954b, 1954c). For both caves, 
this brief occupation and excavation history is followed by the results of reanalysis of the long­curated cucurbit materials (collections of the Illinois State Museum) and maize (collections of the Botanical Museum, Harvard University). Basic descriptions of plant assemblages are pro­vided for each of the five domesticates being con­sidered, along with the criteria used in taxonomic assignment, and they are placed within the strati­graphic and cultural sequences initially developed for the two caves. 
A total of 15 AMS dates on early cucurbit and maize specimens from Romero's and Valenzuela's caves are then employed to establish more accurately when the five domesticated plant species first occur in the archaeological sequence of the Ocampo caves. In a concluding section, the

Era of Incipient Cultivation is reconsidered in light of this new AMS-based chronology for the transition to agriculture in Tamaulipas. 
The Ocampo Caves 

The caves are located at an elevation of 1,500 m asl in the Infiernillo Canyon north of Ocampo in the Sierra Madre mountains of Tamaulipas in northeastern Mexico. Romero's cave (Tm c 247) and Valenzuela's cave (Tm c 248) were excavated respectively by Richard MacNeish and David Kelley in February and March 1954 (Kelley 1954a, 1954b; MacNeish 1954a, 1954b, 1954c). Valenzuela's cave is situated just below Romero's cave, and the occupational histories of the two caves overlap. As a result, the initial analysis and interpretation of the sequence of human occupa­tion of Romero's and Valenzuela's caves, along with nearby Ojo de Agua cave (Tm c 274), involved a combined presentation of information from all three of the Ocampo caves, organized into a series of eight cultural/temporal phases developed by MacNeish (Figure 2).3 Between 1957 and 1967, four landmark publications docu­mented the occurrence of seven different domes­ticated crop plant species in the habitation layers of the Ocampo caves. In a 1957 article the cucur­bit seeds, rind fragments, and peduncles recov­ered from Romero's, Valenzuela's, and Ojo de Agua caves were identified (Whitaker et al. 1957); based on these identifications, the occur­rence of three squash species ( Cucurbita argyros­perma, C. moschata, and C. pepo ), as well as bottle gourd (Lagenaria siceraria), and a wild Cucurbita gourd (labeled C. foetidissima), was traced up through the sequence of eight cultural phases established for the Ocampo region. Three years later, in a similar fashion, the occurrence of different types of domesticated common bean and sieva bean (Phaseolus vulgaris and Phaseolus lunatus) and a species of wild runner bean (Phaseolus coccineus) was documented for the Ocampo caves sequence (Kaplan and MacNeish 1960). In another pioneering study, the presence of plant and animal materials in a total of 221 human paleofeces recovered from Romero's and Valenzuela's caves was documented (Callen 1963). Finally, in 1967, the analysis of the more than 12,000 specimens of maize (Zea mays) recovered from the Ocampo caves was published 
(Mangelsdorf et al. 1967a). Taken together, these four reports presented an archaeobotanical sequence that for the first time documented the initial appearance of maize, beans, squashes, and bottle gourd in a region of Mesoamerica. These four publications, along with MacNeish's and Kelley's archived catalogs, field notes, and draft manuscripts, provide a solid basis for reconsider­ing the archaeobotanical evidence for early domesticated plants in the Ocampo caves. 
Romero 's Cave (Tm c 247) 
Measuring 20 m across and 24 m high at its mouth, Romero's cave extends some 18 m into the cliff face of Infiernillo Canyon. 
Excavation and Initial Analysis. Taking note of the extensive rock fall that covered the western half of the cave floor, MacNeish extended his 7 .6­x-12-m (25 x 35 feet, east-west by north-south) block excavation unit outward from its south (back) and east walls (Figure 3). 
Treasure seekers had previously dug five large holes in this eastern half of the cave, and a pair of l.5-m 2 
(5-foot-square) excavation units bracket­ing one of these provided MacNeish with an ini­tial vertical stratigraphic profile along the north edge of his excavation area. This profile revealed a sequence of cultural deposits resulting from episodes of human occupation of the cave. Frequently consisting largely of abundant and well-preserved plant remains, along with animal bones, projectile points, ceramics, and other cul­turally diagnostic artifacts and cultural debris, these dark-colored occupation layers often were interspersed with light-colored layers composed of both ash, likely the product of wood fires (Schiegl et al. 1994; Weiner et al. 1995), and what the excavators identified as "cave dust. " 
By the time the block excavation was com­pleted, 22 separate stratigraphic layers had been uncovered in Romero's cave; 16 of these were identified as resulting from episodes of human occupation. Based on the presence of diagnostic artifact types, primarily projectile points, other lithic tool categories, and ceramics, these 16 occupation layers were assigned to a temporal sequence of seven cultural complexes. Six radio­carbon dates helped establish the chronology of cave occupation. The cave's 16 occupation layers differed in thickness and horizontal extent, which

was thought to reflect seasonal occupations of varying duration by either single-family (microband) or multiple-family (mac roband) groups. MacNeish's characterizations of the size of the occupying groups and their seasons of habi­tation of the cave, along with his estimates of the volume of each occupation layer, are presented in Table 1. The horizontal extent of each of the occu­pation layers is shown in Figure 3. Eight of the first nine occupations were limited to the back 6 m of the cave (occupations 1 a, 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, and 9), along with occupation 15; five of the final seven occupations extended over much of the area exposed in the block excavation (occupations 10, 
11, 13, 14, and 16). 
With a few exceptions, then, occupational lay­ers in Romero's cave up until about 2600 B.P. (occupations la-9) were restricted to the back portion of the cave (less than or equal to 32 m2 within the block excavation), while those after 2600 B.P. extended over twice as large an area (greater than 64 m2 within the excavation unit). At odds with this general pattern of expansion of occupation area after 2600 B.P. are occupation 15, restricted to the back of the cave, occupation 6, which extended across much of the block excava­tion, and occupation 12, which extended across a small area (about 11.5 m2) in the front half of the cave. Ceramics first appear in occupation layer 9 (MacNeish 1954a). 

As MacNeish and his crew worked down through the 16 occupation layers of Romero's

cave in 1.5 m2 excavation units, they sequentially assigned field catalog numbers 1-323 to the par­ticular levels of particular squares, as they were excavated. Field catalog number 247/107, for example, refers to all materials found in occupa­tion layer 7 of excavation unit S25E5. The field catalog for Romero's cave (MacNeish 1954c) provides provenience information for each of the 323 field catalog numbers assigned during exca­vation, as well as an initial inventory of all mate­rials recovered, listed by field catalog number, excavation unit, and occupation layer. These field catalog numbers, which were often written directly on the larger archaeobotanical specimens such as maize cobs, Lagenaria and Cucurbita rind fragments and peduncles, frequently made it possible both to reestablish the original prove­nience of plant materials from Romero's cave and to cross-check current museum collections against MacNeish's initial catalog inventory lists. 
Subsequent to this initial inventory, maize materials from Romero's cave were sent to Mangelsdorf for analysis (Mangelsdorf et al. l967a). The bean (Phaseolus) materials were similarly studied by Kaplan (Kaplan and MacNeish 1960), and the cucurbit specimens were analyzed by Whitaker and Cutler (Whitaker et al. 1957). 
Bottle Gourd (Lagenaria siceraria). Two bot­tle gourd seeds, three possible peduncles, and 325 rind fragments were present in the Romero's cave cucurbit collection. The two seeds were recovered from occupation 10, while peduncles were found in occupations 5, 13, and 16. Of the 325 Lagenaria rind fragments in the collection, 251 had sufficient provenience information to allow them to be assigned to occupation layers within Romero's cave (Table 2). Almost all of the bottle gourd rind fragments from Romero's cave were uncarbonized and relatively large, making it easy to distinguish them, with a few exceptions, from Cucurbita rind on the basis of both color and rind thickness. The L. siceraria rind fragments ranged in surface (epidermis) color from dark purplish­gray through reddish-brown to (rarely) light yel­low, and averaged more than 3 mm in thickness (Table 2). Rind color and thickness are not always reliable indicators of taxonomic group, however (Ford 1986; Roberts 1995), and the assignment of rind specimens in the Ocampo cave cucurbit 
assemblages to L. siceraria was based on their 
distinctive elongated, loosely organized, irregu­
larly patterned inner cells (Cutler and Whitaker 
1961:479; Roberts 1995:7-8). 
As shown in Table 2, the average weight and thickness of bottle gourd rind fragments remained fairly consistent through the I 6 occupation layers of Romero's cave. In contrast, two related general trends can be observed in terms of the relative abundance of bottle gourd in occupation layers of the cave. First, there is a marked increase in the occurrence of bottle gourd specimens beginning in occupation layer 8 (only nine L. siceraria spec­imens were recovered below occupation 8); and second, in occupation layers 8-16, there is, not surprisingly, a general correlation between the estimated total volume of the layer and the abun­dance of bottle gourd fragments (Tables I and 2). 
Lagenaria first appears in occupation layer 2 of Romero's cave, described as a 2.5-cm-thick layer of vegetal material and characterized as a brief occupation by a microband of the Ocampo cultural complex (6000-4300 B. P.) (Table I). A sample of the single bottle gourd rind fragment recovered from occupation 2 of the cave yielded an AMS radiocarbon date of 5260 ± 60 B.P. (Beta 81974). 
Squash and Pumpkin (Cucurbita). The Romero's cave collection includes a total of 140 Cucurbita rind fragments, 287 seeds and seed fragments, and 42 peduncles. The 140 Cucurbita rind fragments from Romero's cave were almost all uncarbonized and could be easily distin­guished from bottle gourd rind on the basis of both color and rind thickness. In contrast to the Lagenaria rind fragments, which were thick and usually dark in color, Romero's cave fragments of Cucurbita rind were thin (usually less than 2.5 mm) and light tan to brown in color. In addition, their diagnostic cross-section cell structure-iso­diametric with a regular configuration (Roberts 1995 :7)-served to distinguish them from bottle gourd. 
Although no attempt was made to distinguish, on the basis of rind cross-section morphology, either between wild Cucurbita gourds and domes­ticated forms, or between different domesticated taxa, there are still several general patterns to be noted in the distribution of Cucurbita rind up through the occupational episodes of Romero's

cave. Even though the average thickness of·rind fragments remained quite consistent throughout the occupation of the cave, they show a marked increase in average size and, as was the case with bottle gourd, in abundance (total weight) after occupation 8, particularly in occupations 11, 13, and 16 (Table 3). 

Cucurbita fruits are attached to the vine by a short stem or stalk, also called a peduncle (from the Latin for "little foot"). These fruit stalks or peduncles, if well preserved, have long been char­acterized as the best diagnostic tool available for the identification of archaeological specimens of Cucurbita at the species level (Cutler and Whitaker 196 1:474, 476; Whitaker 1981:462; Whitaker and Cutler 1965:344-346).4 Of the 42 Cucurbita peduncles recovered from Romero's cave, 23 could be confidently sorted into one of three types, based on their morphology (Table 4). 
The 10 type 1 peduncles (247/ 11, 12, 16, 26, 54, 55, 70, 71, 102, 183) all have 10 very promi­neut, ropy, and rounded parallel ridges, perpen­dicular to the base, with deep intervening creases or furrows. These rounded ridges, often alternat­ing five large and five small around the peduncle, have basal lobes that often noticeably round under prior to attachment with the fruit (Figure 4). 
Although angling gradually outward to form a large, roughly pentangular base (average maxi­mum basal diameter: 32.5 mm, range 19.4-42.4 mm), these rounded ridges do not flare abruptly at the base, nor do they coalesce to form an encir­cling basal peduncular ridge or shelf. Interridge creases extend through to the bottom of the peduncle. In 8 of 10 specimens convex discs of rind were still attached to the peduncle base. 
These type 1 peduncles fit the brief general profile for C. pepo fruit stems outlined by Cutler and Whitaker (1961:476): "hard, usually with deep furrows; flaring slightly or not at all at base; roughened by coarse setae [hairs]." Whitaker et al. (1957:Figures Sa, 6a) identified the two type 1

peduncles shown in Figure 4 as representing C. pepo. In addition, the peduncles shown in Figure 4 can be seen to compare favorably in terms of size and general morphology with the three mod­em peduncles shown in Figure 5, which belong to cultivated types of C. pepo ssp. pepo (Decker 1986), the major lineage of C. pepo that origi­nated in Mexico.

They are smaller (average maximum basal diameter: 22.0 mm, range 15.4--27.l mm), with almost no overlap in size with type 1 peduncles (Figure 6). Rather than having 10 parallel ridges, type 2 peduncles have five large ridges, interspersed not with deep creases but with broad, shallow, and rounded fur­rows or indentations. These ridges terminate in

lobes (sometimes prominent) at the peduncle base, with the lobes in tum connected by a distinctive basal ridge or shelf that occasionally exhibits minor lobes and interridge depressions (Figure 7). As is the case with interridge creases in type 1 peduncles, intact setae (hairs) can be seen in the interridge depressions of type 2 peduncles. 

Type 2 peduncles fit the brief general profile for Cucurbita moschata fruit stems outlined by Cutler and Whitaker (1961:476) and Nee (1990:63): hard, with shallow, smoothly rounded and angled furrows, widely expanded, and flaring at the fruit attachment (Figure 8). Whitaker et al. (1957:156) identified 12 Cucurbita. moschata peduncles during their initial analysis of the Ocampo caves' Cucurbita assemblage, which is quite close to the 11 Romero's cave peduncles classed as type 2 in the present study.' The earli­est type 2 peduncle (247/68) occurs in occupation 9 of Romero's cave (Table 1). A small sample of this peduncle yielded an AMS radiocarbon date of 2620 B.P. ± 60 (Beta 91410). 
Only two peduncles (247/45, 247171) were assigned to type 3 in the present study. These peduncles are large (maximum basal diameter: 
31 .2 and 48.8 mm), thick, and, rather than flaring at the base, they are cylindrical to somewhat bul­bous (Figure 9). Both are roughly oval in cross­section, lack the distinctive well-defined ridges of types 1 and 2, and are corky in appearance. The larger of the two (247 /45), which is not complete, has three ridges intact, each of which is broad and flat to gently rounded, with a central groove, giv­ing the impression that each ridge consists of two smaller parallel conjoined ridges. Each of these smaller ridges has a distinctive vertical line or central "applique strip." 
These type 3 peduncles fit the general descrip­tions of mature fruit stems of C. argyrosperma (Cutler and Whitaker 1961:478; Fritz 1994c:281; Merrick 1989:62) (Figure 10): thickened, corky, roughly cylindrical in shape, often with five smooth vertical lines occupying the positions where lobes had been when the fruiting stem was immature. The earliest type 3 peduncle (247171) occurs in occupation 6 of Romero's cave (Table 1).

A small sample of this peduncle yielded an AMS radiocarbon date of 4450 ± 60 B.P. (Beta 81975). 
A total of 100 Cucurbita seed fragments, along with 187 largely intact seeds (including 164 that yielded both length and width measurements), were present in the Romero's cave collections. These seeds and seed fragments were distributed in a very distinctive horizontal and vertical strati­graphic pattern throughout the cave's deposits. 
Cucurbita seeds first occur in occupation lay­ers 4 and 5. The seven seeds and 26 fragments assigned to these two occupations were recovered from four adjacent squares along the back wall of the cave (Table 5, Figure 3). This general distrib­utional pattern continues through occupation layer 11. Occupations 7 and IO contained a total of 1 47 seeds and 69 fragments, all of which were recovered from just two excavation units along the back wall of the cave and may represent fecal deposits (Table 5). Similarly, the 24 seeds and 5 fragments recovered from occupation layers 8, 9, and 11 were distributed across five squares in the rear of the cave. In total, eight squares along the rear of the cave yielded all of the seed fragments and all but one of the 178 Cucurbita seeds recov­ered from occupations 4-11 (95 percent of the Romero's cave Cucurbita seed assemblage).

from occupations 12-16 (along with one seed from occupation 11) were recovered from nine squares along the east wall of the cave and two squares just north of the Cucurbita seed concen­tration in occupations 4-11 at the rear of the cave (Table 5, Figure 3). A single isolated seed was recovered from excavation unit W5 in the north­west comer of the block excavation. 
The group of seeds from occupations 4-11, near the rear wall, form a relatively tight size clus­ter (Figure 11, Table 5), with mean length and width values for these levels ranging from 12.2-14.6 mm and 6.7-9.4 mm, respectively. When considered together, the 155 measurable seeds recovered from occupations 4-11 have mean length and width values of 12.7 and 8.3 mm, with coefficient of variation values for length and width of 8.6 and 9.0. Based on her comparative consideration of seeds from 50 modem Cucurbita fruits representing four species, King (1985:87-88) suggested that groups of seeds with coefficients of variation less than 6.5 probably represent a single fruit, fruit from the same vine, or possibly fruit from an isolated population. Coefficient of variation values from approxi­mately 6.5 to 14 probably represent multiple, closely related fruit; coefficients of variation val­ues above 14.0 may indicate the presence of seeds from unrelated fruit. Based on these coefficient of variation values for modem C. pepo, the seed assemblage from occupations 4-11 in Romero's cave would appear to reflect a single isolated vari­ety of Cucurbita, with the largest single grouping (87 seeds from occupation 7) perhaps represent­ing seeds from a single fruit or single plant. In contrast, the eight seeds from occupations 12-16 along the east wall, which are all much larger in size than those in occupations 4-11 (Figure 11 ), with mean length and width values of 18.7 mm and 11.7 mm, also have much higher coefficient of variation values for seed length (17. 7) and seed width (13.3), likely indicating an expansion of

cultivar varieties grown after occupation 10. 
Numerous different physical attributes have been considered in efforts to sort Cucurbita seeds into taxonomic categories at the species and sub­species level, including color, size, width/length ratios, seed outline, seed scar shape, surface tex­ture and hairiness, and shape and size of the seed edge or margin (e.g., Burgess-Terrel 1979; Decker 1984, 1986). While a number of these seed attributes, particularly seed body and seed margin color and texture, have been successfully employed to sort modem seeds, they have often proven difficult to apply in the analysis of less­well-preserved Cucurbita seeds recovered from archaeological contexts. 
With the possible exception of a single seed from occupation layer 13, all of the Cucurbita seeds from Romero's cave share two key morpho­logical characteristics, allowing them to be classed as type 1: they all have margins that are relatively hard, smooth, and uniformly rounded in appearance, and they all, to varying degrees, exhibit a prominent ridge along the inner edge of the seed margin. In addition, type 1 seeds have marginal hairs that are relatively short, although they are not always well preserved. When still present, these hairs are "rooted" along the inside edge of the marginal ridge, and extend up and over this ridge and out onto the margin itself for only a short distance, leaving much of the margin exposed or "naked." In type 1 seeds recovered both from archaeological contexts and from fruits left broken and abandoned in modem fields, mar­ginal hairs have often separated from the ridge and remain as a line of "tufted" broken and intact hairs of varying length (Figure 12). 
When compared with more than 100 seed accessions of different modem cultivated varieties of C. pepo, C. moschata, C. argyrosperma, and C. 
ficifolia, the margin characteristics of the type 1 seeds briefly described above conform closely and consistently to seeds of C. pepo, while differ­ing from the seeds of the other three species. 
Three samples from type 1 seeds were submit-

ted for AMS radiocarbon age determinations. Two of these, from occupation layer 4, represent­ing the earliest Cucurbita seeds recovered from Romero's cave, yielded dates of 5290 ± 70 (Beta 91407) and 5050 ± 50 B.P. (Beta 91408). A seed from occupation layer 7 produced a date of 4480 ± 60 (Beta 91409). 

A single seed (seed RC 186, 247/267, W5) from occupation 13 and measuring 17.9 x 11 .6 mm was assigned to type 2, based on margin and hair characteristics somewhat distinct from those described for type 1 seeds. The "hairs" on this specimen (which actually form a solid layer) were much longer than those of type 1 seeds, and, in fact, extended from the inner edge of the marginal ridge on one side of the seed completely around the seed margin to where they were again firmly rooted along the inner edge of the marginal ridge on the other side of the seed. This unbroken envelopment of the seed margin by a "hair" layer appears to be a distinctive characteristic of C. moschata; as a result, the single type 2 seed recovered from Romero's cave could reasonably be assigned to this species. 
Maize (Zea mays). The initial analysis of maize from the Ocampo caves in the 1960s (Mangelsdorf et al. 1967a) focused almost entirely on the materials recovered from Romero's cave. Of the 12,000 maize specimens included in the study, only a single cob from Valenzuela's cave was included (Mangelsdorf et al. 1967a:36-37), along with several specimens of apparent teosinte and Tripsacum. A total of 3,015 of the 3,472 maize cobs and cob fragments in the Romero's cave assemblage were classified into nine categories, based on their resemblance to existing races of maize in Mexico, with about two-thirds assigned to the Chapalote complex (17 pre-Chapalote, 133 early Chapalote, 1,546 trip­sacoid Chapalote, 37 1 Chapalote [Mangelsdorf et al. l 967a:37]). 
For this study, a survey of the Ocampo caves' maize collections was narrowly focused on obtaining AMS radiocarbon samples from the earliest cobs recovered from both Romero's and Valenzuela's caves to determine when maize first appeared in the occupational history of these two adjacent sites. In Romero's cave, maize first occurs in occupation level 7. Of the nine speci­mens of maize recovered from occupation 7, field notes indicated that five came from "badly pitted" or "disturbed" contexts. Two of the four remain-

ing cob fragments, obtained from "relatively undisturbed" contexts and labeled as "early com," were submitted for AMS radiocarbon dates, yielding age determinations of 3930 ± 50 B. P. (Beta 85431) and 2560 ± 60 B. P. (Beta 85432). 
Valenzuela 's Cave (Tm c 248) 
Located directly below Romero's cave on the cliff face of the south wall of Infiemillo Canyon, Valenzuela's cave (Tm c 248) contains two chambers. With an opening to the northwest and a low ceiling, the east chamber is the larger of the two and contained most of the evidence of human occupation. The west chamber opens to the north and is narrower, with a higher ceiling (Figure 13). 
Excavation and Initial Analysis. Under the direction of David Kelley, block excavation units were opened up in both chambers of the cave, exposing a stratigraphic history of human occu­pation that paralleled, in many ways, the habita­tion episodes of nearby Romero's cave. Eight occupation layers were defined in the east cham­ber of Valenzuela's cave. As was the case in Romero's cave, these occupation layers contained well-preserved plant remains, animal bones, cul­turally diagnostic artifacts and other debris, and were occasionally separated by noncultural zones of ash and "cave dust." Only the final two of the eight occupations present in the east chamber were represented in the west chamber (Table 6). 
Each of these occupation layers was assigned to a cultural complex; three radiocarbon dates helped to define the time periods during which the cave was occupied. Kelley's interpretations of the size of the occupying group (microband or mac­roband) and their possible seasons of habitation of the cave, along with estimates of the volume of each occupation layer, are presented in Table 6 (Kelley 1954a). The horizontal extent of each of the occupation layers is shown in Figure 13. 

As was the case in Romero's cave, the occupa­tions of Valenzuela's cave that are more recent than 2600 B.P. (occupations 7 and 8) were exten­sive in area and volume (> 17 m'), while those before 3500 B.P. were smaller in size and volume ( < 4 m3) and apparently represented smaller occu­pying group (Table 6). The somewhat scattered, noncontinuous distribution of occupations 1-6 (Figure 13), and the frequent reference to their "patchy" nature, underscores Kelley's characteri­zations of these lower occupation layers as often disturbed by the numerous pits dug down into the cave floor both by the occupation 7 and 8 inhabi­tants of the cave and by subsequent treasure hunters. Ceramics first appear in occupation layer 7 (Kelley 1954a:95, 97). 
The same cataloging system was employed in Valenzuela's cave as was used in Romero's cave. The field catalog for Valenzuela's cave (Kelley 1954b) provides provenience information for each of the 152 field catalog numbers assigned during excavation. It also represents an initial inventory of all materials recovered from the cave, listed by field catalog number, excavation unit, and occupation layer. It was often possible, using original field catalog numbers, to both reestablish the original provenience of plant materials from Valenzuela's cave and to cross­check current museum collections against Kelley's catalog inventory lists. Along with the Romero's cave collections, the maize from Valenzuela's cave was analyzed by Mangelsdorf et al. (1967a), the beans by Kaplan and Mac Neish ( 1960), and the cucurbit material by Whitaker et al. (1 957). 
Bottle Gourd (Lagenaria siceraria). No bottle gourd seeds or peduncles were present in the Valenzuela's cave cucurbit collection. Lagenaria rind fragments were distinguished from Cucurbita on the basis of color (dark red to red­dish brown), rind thickness, and distinctive cross­section cell anatomy. A total of 106 bottle gourd rind fragments were recovered from Valenzuela's cave (Table 7). Of these, only 56 had sufficient provenience information to allow them to be assigned to occupation layers. 
Generally comparable to the Lagenaria assem­blage from Romero's cave in terms of both rind fragment size and thickness, these 56 specimens were all recovered from occupation 6 and 7 con­texts in Valenzuela's cave. Occupation layer 6 was often difficult to distinguish from the underlying occupation 5 layer in the cave, however, which was only occasionally separated from it by a thin intervening noncultural layer of white ash (Table 6). It was not surprising, then, that the sample of bottle gourd rind fragment identified as being from occupation 6 yielded an AMS radiocarbon date of 5670 ± 60 B. P. (Beta 81976), indicating

'Kelley (1954a:76) and MacNeish (Kaplan and MacNeish 1960:34) provide different numbering schemes for the human occu­
pation layers in Valenzuela's cave. The numbering systems are the same up through occupation 4, but above occupation 4, a 
layer of gray ash is considered as noncultural by Kelley and not assigned an occupation layer number. MacNeish, however, 
designates it as occupation 5, thus resulting in a renumbering of all of Kelley's subsequent occupations in the cave: Kelley's 
occupation 5 becomes 6 in Kaplan and MacNeish 1960:34, 6 becomes 7, 7 becomes 8, and 8 becomes 9. To avoid confusion 
in working with the original field notes, Kelley's numbering system is used here.

Squash and Pumpkin (Cucurbita). The Valenzuela's cave cucurbit collection includes 146 Cucurbita rind fragments, 134 seeds and seed fragments, and 4 peduncles. The Cucurbita rind fragments could easily be distinguished from bot­tle gourd rind on the basis of their light tan color, their distinctive cross-section cell structure, and their thinness( <2.5 mm). Like the distributional pattern of Lagenaria (Table 7), Cucurbita rind fragments first occur in occupation 5 and increase in abundance in occupations 6, 7, and 8 (Table 8). 
In contrast to Romero's cave, which yielded 42 Cucurbita peduncles, only four were recovered from Valenzuela's cave, all from occupation 7. Three of these peduncles were classed as type 1 (C. pepo) and one as type 2 (C. moschata). Of the three type 1 peduncles (248/121, 130, 132), one (248/132) likely represents a wild Cucurbita pepo gourd, based on its 10 ridges and small size (max­imum basal diameter: 10.3 mm). Like those recovered from Romero's cave, the single type 2 peduncle from Valenzuela's cave (248/132) has five prominent rounded ridges interspersed with broad shallow indentations, a flat shelf connect­ing basal lobes, and a maximum basal diameter of 
22.5 mm. A small sample of this type 2 peduncle yielded an AMS radiocarbon date of 1550 ± 60 
B.P. (Beta 91411). 
A total of 64 Cucurbita seed fragments and 70 largely intact seeds, including 62 that provided both length and width measurements, were pre­sent in the Valenzuela's cave collections (Table 9).

10.6) are similar to those of occupations 4-11 in Romero's cave (8.6, 9.0), and they too fall into the 6.5-14 range suggested by King (1985) as proba­bly indicating multiple, closely related fruit. 
In contrast, the coefficient of variation values for seed length increase substantially in occupa­tions 7 (13.3) and 8 (13.6) of Valenzuela's cave, reflecting the expansion of cultivated types of Cucurbita grown after occupation 6. This expan­sion of varieties of pumpkin in occupations 7 and 8 of Valenzuela's cave is well illustrated in Figure 
14. While occupations 7 and 8, on the one hand, yielded seeds in the same size range as occupa­tions 5 and 6, suggesting the continued cultivation of a long-established "small-seeded" variety of Cucurbita, the upper two occupations also con­tained seeds that were distinctive in being longer and having a lower width/length (W/L) ratio, indicating a thinner seed relative to seed length. This is similar to the pattern observed in Romero's cave, where larger, relatively thinner seeds having a lower W IL ratio dominated the seed assemblages after occupation 10. 
All of the Cucurbita seeds from Valenzuela's cave exhibit distinctive seed margin characteris­tics allowing them to be assigned to seed type 1 (which compares favorably to modern C. pepo seeds). "Rooted" along the inside edge of the marginal ridge, the marginal "hairs" of type 1 seeds are short, extending up and over the ridge and only a short distance out onto the seed mar­gin itself, which remains smooth and uniformly rounded on the vast majority of the Valenzuela's cave type 1 seeds. These hairs often form a line of "tufted" broken and intact hairs of varying length. 
Three samples from type 1 seeds were submit­ted for AMS radiocarbon age determinations. Two of these, from occupation layer 5, represent­ing the earliest Cucurbita seeds recovered from the cave, yielded dates of 5540 ± 60 (Beta 80801) and 5260 ± 50 B.P. (Beta 80800). A third seed, lacking exact provenience information but labeled "occupation 4/5" produced a date of 4920 
± 60 B.P. (Beta 80802). 
Maize (Zea mays). The Valenzuela's cave maize collections were surveyed to obtain AMS radiocarbon samples from the earliest secure stratigraphic contexts, to determine when maize first appeared in the occupational history of the site. Maize first appears in occupation 6 of Valenzuela's cave. Of the three excavation units that yielded occupation 6 context maize remains, one contained leaf fragments, another stalk frag­ments, while the third square contained several cobs. One of these, a small intact cob 47.4 mm in length and 14 mm in diameter (Figure 15) yielded an AMS radiocarbon date of 3890 ± 60 B.P. (Beta 85433). Moving up in the occupational sequence of the cave, 13 excavation units con­tained maize specimens in occupation 7 contexts, with cob fragments recovered from only 6 of these. One of these cob fragments, from a secure occupation 7 context, provided an AMS radiocar­bon date of 1380 ± 60 B.P. (Beta 85434). 
Summary al!d Discussion 
This reanalysis of the early cultivated plants from the Ocampo caves, undertaken both to clarify the temporal and cultural context of the transition to food production in northeastern Mexico, and more broadly to reconsider the nature of agricul­tural origins in Mesoamerica, provides answers to a wide range of relevant questions. 
Depositional Integrity of the Caves and 
Research Potential of the Collections 
The first set of questions centers on the deposi­tional integrity of the caves and the associated research potential of the collections, housed for more than four decades in a number of different museums. As the Ocampo caves were excavated, individual field catalog numbers were assigned to all of the materials recovered from different lev­els of different excavation units. Still tied to the collections today, these field catalog numbers allowed separate detailed level-by-level analysis of the early cultigens in Romero's and Valenzuela's caves to be carried out, even though, in the initial analyses, data on the maize, bean, and cucurbit materials from the two caves were first combined and then grouped by general cul­tural-temporal periods. Thus these collections still have excellent research potential. 
What then of the stratigraphic integrity of the cultural deposits within Romero's and Valenzuela's caves? Detailed provenience infor­mation obviously would be of little value if the cultural deposits were highly disturbed. In the archived field notes and manuscripts, both

MacNeish and Kelley describe evidence of pit­digging activities in the caves, both by the origi­nal inhabitants and by much more recent treasure hunters. These pits were easy to recognize, how­ever, and the cultural deposits otherwise appeared largely undisturbed. The relatively intact and undisturbed nature of the occupational layers of both caves is confirmed by the 15 AMS radiocar­bon dates obtained on early plant remains during the present study (Tables 10 and 11 ). In both caves, with some exceptions-to be discussed below-the AMS dates exhibit close agreement within specific occupational episodes, both with other AMS dates and with conventional radiocar­bon dates obtained almost 40 years ago. 
In addition, the AMS and conventional radio­carbon dates can be arranged, with a few discrep­ancies, in a consistent, ordered temporal sequence. In Valenzuela's cave, the single anom­aly is the date of 5670 B.P. on Lagenaria from occupation 6 (level 3 of square E20). Clearly this bottle gourd rind fragment dates to occupation 5, not 6. Rather than indicating the vertical displace­ment of this rind fragment out of its true deposi­tional context, however, its original assignment to occupation 6 reflects the clearly acknowledged and frequently encountered difficulty in distin­guishing the dividing line between occupations 5 and 6 in a number of areas of Valenzuela's cave. 
Similarly, in Romero's cave the only obvious anomaly is a maize cob assigned to occupation 7, which yielded a date of 2560 B.P., suggesting it actually belongs in occupation 9. With this single exception, the 14 radiocarbon dates from Romero's cave provide an ordered temporal sequence, while at the same time underscoring the challenge inherent in accurately delineating and differentiating the sequential habitation episodes that are represented in the cave. Given that the collections from Romero's and Valenzuela's caves are reasonably well provenienced, and that the excavated and recorded cultural deposits were relatively intact, let us tum to the complex ques­tion of the caves ' occupational history, and the related issue of the timing and sequence of appearance of different species of domesticated crop plants. 
Initial Occupations, Initial Domesticates 
The stratigraphy and available radiocarbon dates for Romero's cave, expressed in calibrated calen­dar years (Table 10), indicate a series of at least three short-term episodes of occupation (occupa­tions 1, 2, and 4) between about 4200 and 3900 cal B.C. Thin noncultural ash and cave dust lay­ers separate occupations 1, 2, and 4, indicating intervals of abandonment. Each of these early "occupations," however, could itself conceivably represent multiple short-term habitation episodes. This is particularly true for occupation 4, a 5-10 cm thick vegetable layer that yielded two AMS radiocarbon dates barely overlapping at the two­sigma 95 percent probability range, suggesting multiple seasonal occupation of the cave. 
Evidence for two domesticated plants was

recovered from these initial occupations ( 1--4) of Romero's cave. Three bottle gourd rind fragments were recovered, one of which yielded an AMS date of cal 4200 B.C. Cucurbita remains from these initial occupations consist of 32 thin rind fragments, 7 peduncles, 4 seeds, and 26 seed frag­ments. A wild Cucurbita gourd is likely repre­sented in this rind-fragment assemblage, based both on thin rind fragments and small seeds, but no peduncles from wild gourds were recovered from occupations 1--4. The only domesticated squash species present is C. pepo, based on two peduncles and the four seeds, two of which yielded AMS dates of 4080 and 3915 cal B.C. (Table 10). 
Although it was occupied much earlier, nearby Valenzuela's cave provides clear parallels to the record of initial occupation and the initial appear­ance of domesticates in Romero's cave. Valenzuela's cave was first used by a hunting-and­gathering group about 8000 B.P. (occupation 1), with at least three subsequent episodes of occupa­tion (occupations 2--4) taking place before the ear­liest habitation of Romero's cave (Table 11). 
Separated from these earlier occupations by patches of gray ash and "cave dust," occupation 5 of Valenzuela's cave, an extensive 2-8 cm thick layer of vegetal material, included a number of occupations that bracketed the time frame of ini­tial occupation of Romero's cave. Dating to about 4300 to 3700 cal B.C., these occupational episodes also provided the earliest evidence of domesticated plants in Valenzuela's cave. As with Romero's cave, these earliest domesticates were bottle gourd and Cucurbita pepo. The earliest stratigraphic bottle gourd fragment in the collec­tions from Valenzuela's cave yielded a date of 4490 cal B.C. (compared to 4200 cal B.C. for the earliest bottle gourd from Romero's cave). Cucurbita remains first appear in occupation 5 contexts of Valenzuela's cave, which produced 8 rind fragments, 32 seed fragments, and 16 seeds (Table 9). All of the seeds were assigned to type 1 
(C. pepo ), with three seeds yielding AMS dates of 4360, 4045, and 3695 cal B.C. (compared to dates of 4080 and 3915 cal B.C. for the earliest C. pepo seeds in Romero's cave). In summary, based on the six earliest AMS radiocarbon dates for these two domesticates (4490, 4360, 4200, 4080, 4035, and 3915 cal B.C.), it is reasonable to conclude that the earliest domesticates (Lagenaria sicer­aria and C. pepo) first appeared in both Romero's and Valenzuela's caves during short-term sea­sonal occupations that occurred between 4500 and 4000 cal B.C. 
Later Occupations, Later Domesticates 
After about 4000 to 3900 B.C., both Romero's cave and Valenzuela's cave appear to have stood largely vacant for about 1,500 years, from 3900 to 2400 B.C. Both caves, however, show evidence of short episodes of habitation during this 15-cen­tury span. In Valenzuela's cave a solitary AMS date of 3695 cal B.C. (Table 11) indicates a pos­sible brief occupation, while in Romero's cave three thin ash layers (occupations 5, 6, and 7) have yielded AMS dates of 3100 and 3085 cal 
B.C. (Table 10), along with several conventional dates that are more problematic (they have large standard deviations) and fall several centuries earlier. One of these AMS dates (3085 cal B.C. from occupation 6) was obtained on a Cucurbita peduncle assigned to type 3 (C. argyrosperma), marking the earliest documented record of this species in an archaeological context in the Americas and the addition of a third cucurbit species to the list of domesticated plants under cultivation in northeastern Mexico by 3000 B.C. 
Both caves were reoccupied again at about 2400 B.C. In Valenzuela's cave this reoccupation is marked by a thin vegetal layer (occupation 6) that overlies the white ash and cave dust layer deposited during the long hiatus. Maize (Zea mays) first appears in this thin vegetal layer, with a sample from one of the small cobs from occu­pation 6 providing an AMS date of 2350 cal B.C., which agrees closely with the conventional radio­carbon date obtained for occupation 6 (Table 11 ). The reoccupation of Romero's cave is marked by occupation 8, a thick vegetal layer that may well represent a number of episodes of habitation. Occupation 8 is bracketed by two conventional dates from occupation 9 that have large standard deviations, and a comparable AMS date from occupation 7 (Table 10), all of which are likely assignable to occupation 8. The AMS date in question (2455 cal B.C.) is from a small maize cob, representing the initial appearance of this domesticate in Romero's cave. Thus, as was the case with bottle gourd and C. pepo, maize made

its appearance in the same temporal context in both Romero's (2455 cal B.C.) and Valenzuela's (2350 cal B.C.) caves. 

Following the initial appearance of maize in the two adjacent caves at about 2400 B.C., they were again both vacant for long periods of time. Valenzuela's cave stood empty for another 2,900 years, until about AD. 500, when a thick ash layer (occupation 7), containing patches of vege­tal material and the first recorded ceramics, marks the return of human habitation of the cave, likely in a series of episodes of occupation. One of these episodes yielded a peduncle assigned to type 2 ( C. moschata) that produced an AMS date of A.D. cal 535 (Table 11).

appearance of additional cultivar varieties of C. pepo by A.D. 500-600. 
Cucurbita moschata, ceramics, and additional cultivar varieties of C. pepo, however, first appeared earlier in Romero's cave, which was unoccupied from 2400 to 800 B.C. (Tables 1 and 10). A thin ash layer (occupation 9) marks the. cave's reoccupation and contains the earliest well­provenienced ceramics, as well as a C. moschata peduncle that yielded an AMS date of 800 cal 
B.C. Additional varieties of C. pepo, however, did not appear in Romero's cave until occupation 11, which dates to about AD. 400 (Tables 1 and 10). 
Reconciling the Present Study and Past Analyses 
While the present study reconfirms the integrity of both the museum collections and the stratigra­phy of the Ocampo caves, its results also differ in a number of respects from the initial analyses of some of the Ocampo archaeobotanical assem­blages. It is not possible to carry out a detailed reconsideration of these earlier analyses, because the plant assemblage data sets from Romero's and Valenzuela's caves were first combined, and then grouped by general cultural-temporal periods. It is essential, however, to address the most obvious and important area of disagreement between this and previous studies---differences regarding the cultural and temporal context of initial appear­ance of the five crop plants under consideration here: Zea mays, Cucurbita moschata, Cucurbita argyrosperma, Cucurbita pepo, and Lagenaria siceraria. 
There is, interestingly enough, close consensus between this study and past research regarding the timing of the introduction of maize into Tamaulipas. In the initial analysis of the Zea mays

from Ocampo, the earliest identified maize was a single cob recovered from Fiacco-phase contexts (4300--3800 B.P.) in Valenzuela's cave, while 242 cobs were recovered from overlying Guerra­phase occupations. In the present study, the earli­est maize cob from Valenzuela's cave (occupation 6, Flacco phase) yielded an AMS date of 2350 cal B.C., and the earliest cob from Romero's cave (occupation 7, Guerra phase) produced a similar AMS date of 2455 cal B.C. The estimated arrival of maize at 2500 B.C. in La Perra cave, located about 100 km northeast of Ocampo (Mangelsdorf et al. 1956:128--129; 1967a:33), is also in close agreement with the Ocampo dates. 
Similarly, results of the present study do not vary significantly from those of earlier researchers regarding the arrival of C. moschata in the Ocampo caves. In their initial analysis, Whitaker et al. (1957:357) conclude, "In the Ocampo caves, C. moschata appears definitely in the Mesa de Guaje culture (3400--2400 B.P.) and there is a peduncle which is probably C. moschata in the Guerra C.ulture (3800--3400 B.P.)." Although none of the 13 peduncles identified in the present study as coming from Guerra-phase contexts or earlier were identified as C. moschata, a C. moschata peduncle was recognized from Mesa de Guaje-phase contexts (occupation 9, Romero's cave). It yielded an AMS date of 800 cal B.C., which falls into the 3400--2400 B.P. time range of the "definitely" identified C. moschata of Whitaker et al. (1957:357). 
In addition, although there is a 3,200-year dif­ference between the arrival date assigned by Whitaker et al. (1957:357) to C. argyrosperma for the Ocampo caves, and that established in the pre­sent study, the discrepancy rests on a difference of opinion regarding the taxonomic assignment of a single peduncle. The only peduncle identified as 
C. argyrosperma by Whitaker et al. (1957:355--357) was recovered from a Palmillas­phase context (1800--1100 B.P.) in Romero's cave (occupation 11 ). In this study, in addition to the Palmillas peduncle, a second peduncle, from occupation 6 of Romero's cave (Figure 9), also was identified as C. argyrosperma and yielded an AMS date of 3085 cal B.C. 
The present study also differs from the initial report on the Ocampo cucurbits by Whitaker et al. (1957) in terms of the earliest evidence for bottle 
gourd in the Ocampo caves, once again on the 
basis of a few specimens. While Whitaker et al. 
(1957:356) list two bottle gourd fragments as being recovered from Infiernillo contexts (9000--7000 B.P.), and 87 from Ocampo-phase occupation layers (6000-4300 B.P.), only three bottle gourd rind fragments from Ocampo con­texts were located in the collections, and none was identified as being from Infiernillo occupa­tions of the two caves. In addition, there is no mention of any lnfiernillo-phase cucurbit rind (either Cucurbita or bottle gourd) in either the Romero's cave report or the excavation unit notes (MacNeish 1954a, 1954b). In Valenzuela's cave, while cucurbit rind is listed as coming from a pos­sible Infiernillo context (248/80), this material was found, on inspection, to be thin Cucurbita rind rather than Lagenaria, and to have come from a less-than-secure stratigraphic context. In summary, there is no evidence in either the exca­vation records or in the extant cucurbit collection for bottle gourd being present in the Ocampo caves during these early occupation episodes (a likely explanation for this discrepancy is pre­sented below). In the absence of any evidence for bottle gourd during Infiernillo times, the two very similar AMS dates on the earliest, stratigraphi­cally secure Lagenaria rind from Romero's and Valenzuela's caves (4200 cal. B.C., 4490 cal B.C.) provide the best available estimate for the first appearance of this species in the Ocampo sequence. 
There is a similar discrepancy between the pre­sent study and earlier analyses regarding the pres­ence of domesticated Cucurbita in Infiemillo occupations of the Ocampo caves. Whitaker et al. (1957:356) assign six seeds of a wild Cucurbita gourd, seven seeds of a domesticated pumpkin 
(C. pepo ), and one domesticated squash rind frag­ment to Infiernillo-phase contexts in the two caves. Earlier descriptions, however, provide con­flicting information. MacNeish (1954a: l2) indi­cates, "Vegetable materials are extremely rare and only 20 specimens were found [in the Infiemillo phase occupation la] ... . three of these wild specimens are from wild squash. Seeds from a feces may be from a very small variety of pump­kin, Cucurbita pepo which indicates a use of domesticated plants." No plant remains or feces are noted in the field catalog for this initial occu-

pation of the cave, however, nor does Callen (1963:190) list any Infiernillo-phase coprolites being recovered from Romero's cave. In addition, no plant remains assigned to Infiernillo occupa­tions of Romero's cave were present in the col­lections. Given these contradictions, it is likely that MacNeish's initial report reflects preliminary interpretations that were subsequently revised, along with the cultural assignments of some lower stratigraphic levels of some excavation units in the cave. 
Valenzuela's cave presents a similar situation in regard to the presence of Cucurbita materials in Infiernillo-phase contexts. In his account of the Infiernillo occupations ( 1-3) of Valenzuela's cave, Kelley notes that in occupation 2 "there also were six wild squash seeds" (Kelley 1954a:81). In his subsequent analysis of the coprolites from Valenzuela's cave, however, Callen did not iden­tify any Cucurbita seeds or rind in Infiernillo­phase specimens (Callen 1963:190, 192). To further complicate the issue, Kelley goes on to state that in addition to the seeds from Infiernillo­phase occupation 2, "There were some peppers as well as some pumpkin seeds and there was a def­inite fragment of a pumpkin rind found within the refuse" (Kelley 1954a:81), as well as "a few frag­ments of pumpkin" from occupation 3 of Valenzuela's cave (Kelley 1954a:84). The field catalog for Valenzuela's cave, however, lists only one excavation unit as possibly containing Cucurbita seeds from an Infiernillo occupation (50 seeds from N5E20, L6/7), which was consid­ered doubtful since maize also is present in the deposit (Kelley 1954b:8). No seeds or rind frag­ments of Cucurbita were located in the collection that could be assigned to the Infiernillo occupa­tions of Valenzuela's cave. 
The elusive and problematic nature of the Infiernillo-phase Cucurbita material from the Ocampo caves and its equivocal domesticated sta­tus is further evident in subsequent discussions in the literature. For example, Kaplan and MacNeish (1960:35) state, "The people of the Infiernillo phase were nomadic family bands of wild plant collectors who did some hunting. Nevertheless they utilized the domesticated gourd (L. sicer­aria) and the pumpkin ( C. pepo ). The seeds of the pumpkin, however, are extremely small and it must have been close to the hypothetical wild form if not actually wild." Similarly, Cutler and Whitaker (1961:Table 1), on the one hand, list domesticated C. pepo as being present in the Ocampo caves by 9000 B.P., while at the same time providing a much more cautious statement on the subject (Cutler and Whitaker 1961:477): "The oldest cultivated squash remains we have seen are from the Ocampo caves . . . . small C. pepo seeds from the lowest level, the Infiernillo Culture, may have come from weeds, or camp fol­lower plants, but by the second period, the Ocampo Culture, pepo certainly was cultivated." In 1964 Mangelsdorf et al. take a similarly rather tentative position regarding the domesticated sta­tus of the reported early Cucurbita from the Ocampo caves: "The best case for a cultivated plant at this early time is the summer squash or pumpkin (C. pepo). The plant, apparently, was first utilized for its seeds. Several of these seeds have been found in an Infiernillo deposit and some authorities believe domesticates to be repre­sented among them (Whitaker, Cutler and MacNeish 1957, MacNeish 1959)." A footnote to this statement provides further information: "Of the six pumpkin seeds ( C. pepo) in Infiemillo refuse, three are quite small and probably wild, but in the opinion of Whitaker and Cutler the other three seeds, all larger, appear to be domesti­cates" (Mangelsdorf et al. 1964:430). 
By the mid-1960s, then, the case for the pres­ence of Cucurbita in Infiernillo-phase contexts in the Ocampo case had been narrowed to six seeds recovered from refuse deposits (as opposed to human coprolites). Three of these seeds were "small" and considered to be in the size range of wild Cucurbita gourds; three were large enough to represent domesticated plants. But three decades later these six seeds did not appear to be present in the Ocampo cave cucurbit collec­tions---certainly there were no Cucurbita seeds in the collections from Infiernillo-phase contexts. There were, however, six seeds in the collections that by accident could easily have been assigned to the Infiernillo phase. The seeds in question, assigned seed numbers RC 1-6 in the present study, are stratigraphically the earliest Cucurbita seeds recovered from Romero's cave, having been found in occupation level 4 (sometimes labeled

occupation 3 in the field catalog). And while occupations 3 and 4 in Romero's cave (Tm c 247) were assigned to the Ocampo phase, occupation 3 in Valenzuela's cave (Tm c 248) (Table 6) was identified as belonging to the Infiemillo phase. If these six seeds were counted as being from occu­pation 3 of Tm c 248 rather than occupation 3 of Tm c 247, they would have been the basis for the identification of domesticated Cucurbita pepo in the Infiemillo phase of the Ocampo caves.6 The seeds themselves provide further support for this possibility, since three are "small" (11 x 7, 11 x8, 
10 x 7 mm) and three are "large" (13 x 9, 14 x 10, 15 x 9 mm).7 Samples of two of these six seeds yielded AMS dates of 3915 and 4080 cal B.C., confirming their Ocampo-phase assignment. When combined with comparable dates of 4045 and 4360 cal B.C. on the earliest C. pepo from Valenzuela's cave, they provide a solid estimate for the initial appearance of domesticated pump­kin in the Ocampo caves. 
In summary, it is possible to largely reconcile the results of the reanalysis of the Ocampo caves presented here with those of earlier researchers, while at the same time substantially revising the record of the initial appearance of domesticated crop plants in northeastern Mexico. This revision in the timing and sequence of arrival of key domesticates in Romero's and Valenzuela's caves in tum reopens the question of the role of the Ocampo caves in understanding the origins of agriculture in Mexico. 
Viewing the Origins of Agriculture in Mesoamerica from Northeastern Mexico 
Richard MacNeish's search for the transition from hunting and gathering to food production in Mesoamerica began with the excavation of caves in Tamaulipas in the late 1940s and early 1950s. The subsequent pioneering analysis of plant remains from Romero's and Valenzuela's caves played a central role in defining the Era of Incipient Cultivation-the first general cultural­historical account of agricultural origins in Mesoamerica. Soon overshadowed by Flannery's processual explanation (1968, 1973, 1986), this Era of Incipient Cultivation has rarely been recon­sidered over the past 25 years. The reanalysis of the Ocampo caves presented here provides such an opportunity to assess and update this long­standing cultural-historical framework and, in the process, to point to potentially promising areas of future research. 
Before turning to a consideration of the four main elements of the Era of Incipient Cultivation (duration, location and sequence of domestica­tion, pace of change, and cultural context of change), let us first address the related question of whether Tamaulipas and the Ocampo caves were central or peripheral to Mesoamerican agricul­tural origins. In the late 1950s, as Richard MacNeish shifted his research focus south from Tamaulipas to Tehuacan, it was with the recogni­tion that the Ocampo caves were located far to the north of where agriculture first developed in Mexico. This view of Tamaulipas being in a northern peripheral position was at odds, how­ever, with the early dates from the Ocampo caves for C. pepo and Lagenaria, and the suggestion that C. pepo may have been first domesticated in northern Mexico. Tamaulipas thus seemed to simultaneously occupy two contradictory roles­one on the margin of agricultural origins along the northern periphery, and the other more central, as one of several regions of parallel independent agricultural development, each with its distinct set of locally domesticated plants that were later joined by crop plants introduced from other areas. The case for C. pepo being first domesticated in Tamaulipas, however, has now been weakened in a number of important respects. First, C. pepo ssp. fraterna, a wild Cucurbita gourd of north­eastern Mexico that had been proposed as the wild progenitor of the Mexican lineage of domes­ticated C. pepo (i.e., C. pepo ssp. pepo) (Decker 1986), has been shown not to match the expected genetic profile of this as-yet-unidentified wild ancestor (Decker-Walters et al. 1993). Second, the time depth of domesticated C. pepo, as well as Lagenaria, in the Ocampo caves has been short­ened by about 2,600 years, from 9000 B.P. to 4400 cal B.C., thus reducing the strength of the region's claim of temporal priority of domesti­cated cucurbits. Third, reanalysis and direct AMS dating of Cucurbita pepo specimens from Guila Naquitz cave in Oaxaca, far to the south of Ocampo, has confirmed both their domesticated status and their considerable antiquity (ca. 8000

cal. B.C. (Whitaker and Cutler 1986; Smith 
1997). In all likelihood, as additional archaeo­botanical sequences that span the Archaic are established for different regions of Mexico, and reanalysis and direct dating of extant collections from other early sites are completed, I think that Tamaulipas will be shown to be indeed situated to the north of the regions where plants were first brought under domestication in Mexico. The Ocampo caves, then, quite likely contain a record of the sequential introduction of crop plants, including C. pepo, that were initially domesti­cated to the south, hundreds or thousands of years earlier. 
The role of the Ocampo caves sequence as generally representative of northeastern Mexico also should be qualified in several respects. Given the remote location and rugged terrain of the Ocampo caves, they should not be considered as representative of Tamaulipas or northeastern Mexico; crops may have arrived in other less remote areas of Tamaulipas some time before they first appeared in the Ocampo sequence. It is also important to keep in mind that neither Romero's nor Valenzuela's caves contain unbro­ken records of human occupation. In both caves, temporal clusters of brief seasonal occupational episodes are separated by long periods of time­often thousands of years-during which the caves were unoccupied. As a result, when introduced domesticates first occurred in the Ocampo sequence, their initial appearance often was pre­ceded by a long span of time for which there is no available information regarding either their pres­ence or absence in the region. C. argyrosperma, for example, appeared in the Ocampo caves at 3000 cal B.C. A period of a thousand years or so of no occupation and no information that extends back from 3000-4000 cal B.C. separates the ini­tial appearance of this species from the next ear­lier occupational cluster, which occurred between 4400 and 4000 cal B.C., and which has yielded no evidence of C. argyrosperma. Based on this set of facts, it would be reasonable to conclude that C. argyrosperma was not cultivated by the occupants of the Ocampo caves at 4000 cal B.C., that it was grown by 3000 cal B.C., and that it therefore was introduced into the region sometime between 4000 and 3000 cal B.C. C. argyrosperma also 
provides a good example, however, of why it is important to take into account the nature and strength of the evidence for both the presence and absence of different crop plants in the Ocampo sequence. The evidence for C. argyrosperma at 3000 cal B.C. consists of a single directly dated peduncle. Given the limited nature of this evi­dence for cultivation at 3000 cal B.C., which, in fact, went unrecognized in the initial analysis of the Ocampo cucurbits by Whitaker et al. (1957), perhaps C. argyrosperma also was cultivated at 4000 cal B.C., yet simply left no record. Conversely, even though I am confident in the taxonomic identification of the peduncle in ques­tion as C. argyrosperma, perhaps future DNA analysis will indicate otherwise, which would push the first appearance of this domesticate for­ward in time another 3,200 years, to cal AD. 200. Thus, C. argyrosperma underscores how impor­tant it is to keep in mind the inherent interpretive limitations of the Ocampo archaeobotanical sequence, and the extent to which it is compatible with different alternative explanatory frameworks of Mesoamerican agricultural origins. 
A final observation regarding the interpretive limitations of the Ocampo caves is that they do not tell us very much about the human societies that made the transition from hunting and gather­ing to food production in northeastern Mexico. Like La Perra cave (MacNeish 1958), Romero's and Valenzuela's caves contained a record of spo­radic short-term seasonal occupations, but as yet there is no information available regarding the size, location, or relative permanence of the other settlements that comprised the annual cycle of these societies. This is not meant as a criticism of the pioneering research involved in the excavation of these caves, or of the landmark analysis of their archaeobotanical assemblages. Rather it is an acknowledgment of how little subsequent research has been carried out in the region, and how much still remains to be done. 
Turning to the four main elements of the Era of Incipient Cultivation explanation (duration, loca­tion and sequence of domestication, pace of change, and cultural context), it is the first-dura­tion-that is most clearly highlighted as a result of the direct AMS dating of the early domesti­cates of the Ocampo caves, as well as by other

parallel redating initiatives. Kaplan's broadscale direct AMS dating of early domesticated beans (Phaseolus) from throughout the Americas (1993, 1995) has established that these species were quite likely brought under domestication late in the developmental process in Mexico, which in effect largely removes them from the early chap­ters of the history of emergence of food produc­tion economies in Mesoamerica. In both the southwestern and eastern United States, beans arrived substantially later than maize, providing further support for the apparent late domestica­tion of this species in Mexico. Similarly, the recent direct AMS dating of the arrival of maize in the southwestern United States at about 2000-1500 cal B.C. (Wills 1995), and in the east­ern United States by cal A.D. 1 (Riley et al. 1994) appear compatible with the AMS dates that mark the arrival of maize in Tamaulipas at about 2500 cal B.C., and the initial appearance of this domes­ticate in Tehuacan at 3500 cal B.C. (Long et al. 1989). Combined, these AMS dates on early maize, along with numerous conventional radio­carbon dates associated with early maize cobs and kernels from Central America and South America, as well as Mesoamerica, seem to indicate that maize was domesticated several thousand years more recently than initially proposed in the Era of Incipient Cultivation cultural-historical frame­work.8 Direct AMS dating of the early cucurbit materials from Romero's and Valenzuela's caves has produced similar results, with L. siceraria mid 

C. pepo first appearing not at 9000 B.P., as origi­nally proposed in the formulation of the Era of Incipient Cultivation framework, but at 4400-4000 cal B.C. All of these direct AMS redating initiatives suggested that the span of time separating initial plant domestication in Mesoamerica from the first appearance of village­based agricultural economies, at around 2000-1500 cal B.C., was only 3,000-3,500 years long, extending back to perhaps 5000 cal B.C. rather than to 9000-10,000 B.P. The reanalysis of cucurbit assemblages from Guila Naquitz, how­ever, has confirmed that the initial domestication of at least one species-Cucurbita pepo--had occurred by 8,000 cal. B.C. (Smith 1997). 
It is interestjng to note that the earliest evi­dence for domesticated plants in the eastern 
United States-squash (C. pepo), sunflower (Helianthus annuus var. macrocarpus), marsh elder (Iva annua var. macrocarpa), chenopod (Chenopodium berlandieri ssp. jonesianum)-at about 3000-2300 cal B.C. predates the earliest clear evidence for an increased role for crop plants in that region (at ca. 1000-400 cal B.C.) by perhaps 1,000-2,500 years. Thus it appears that both Mexico and the eastern United States wit­nessed an extended period of what could be termed "low-level food production" during which a number of plants had been domesticated, were cultivated, and played a small, yet important dietary role, before assuming much more promi­nent positions in food production economies (Flannery 1986; Fritz l 994a; Gremillion and Sobolik 1996; McClung de Tapia 1992, 1994; Smith 1992). This extended period of initial low­level food production, which remains poorly doc­umented in both regions, serves to connect two 
temporally and developmentally distinct cultural transitions-the initial domestication of plants and the subsequent emergence of economies cen­tered on food production. 
While Mexico and the eastern United States were similar in having long initial periods of low­level food production, they also seem, at least at this point in time, to have been different not only in terms of the duration of these initial periods of incipient cultivation (6,000 or so years in Mexico and perhaps 2,500 years in the eastern United States), but also in regard to both the geographi­cal and environmental contexts of initial domesti­cation, and the timing or sequence of domestication-the second main element of the Era of Incipient Cultivation cultural-historical framework. In the eastern United States the wild ancestors of three of the four initial domesticates (Iva annua, C. pepo ssp. ovifera var. ozarkana, Chenopodium berlandieri) were very similar in their pioneering adaptations as floodplain weeds, and all three shared the same primary habitat and geographical range-the mid-latitude interior stream and river valley corridors of the Mississippi River and its tributaries (Smith 1992). In contrast, while a pioneering adaptation to dis­turbed ground situations also has been noted for the wild relatives of maize, pumpkins, and beans (Flannery 1986:8-9; Flannery and Ford 1972),

recent biological research on the habitat require­ments and present-day geographical range of the likely progenitor populations of these domesti­cates tends to support a central theme of the Era of Incipient Cultivation scenario (MacNeish 1967); the trinity of maize, beans, and squash/pumpkin could well have been brought under domestication in different environmental and geographical contexts in Mexico (Smith 1995b ). The wild populations of teosinte that gave rise to maize, for example, grow today at elevations of 400 to 1,700 min the central Balsas River regions of Guerrero (Doebley 1990), while the progenitor populations of wild Phaseolus from which the common bean was domesticated occur today around Guadalajara (Gepts 1990). Cucurbita argyrosperma is now recognized as having been brought under domestication from C. argyrosperma ssp. sororia, a wild gourd with a broad geographical distribution in eastern and southern Mexico (Merrick 1989, 1990), while C. moschata is considered to have developed from a still unidentified wild gourd in lowland settings of Central America or Colombia (Nee 1990). The wild ancestor of C. pepo ssp. pepo in Mexico is as yet unidentified. 

It is tempting, of course, to see this regional pattern of plant domestication reflected in the Ocampo caves sequence, with C. moschata, for example, appearing late because it was domesti­cated far to the south, and C. Argyrosperma and maize showing up earlier than C. moschata, since they were brought under domestication closer to Tamaulipas. The timing of domestication of dif­ferent crop plants is, of course, the other key vari­able in such speculative equations, and the sequences of Romero's and Valenzuela's caves could certainly still be read as providing indirect evidence in support of another of the central themes of the Era of Incipient Cultivation expla­nation-that different species were not only brought under domestication in different regions of Mexico, but also at different times. In contrast to the eastern United States, where three and per­haps all four of the initial domesticates appear to have been domesticated in a span of 500 years or so, if the Ocampo sequences are assumed to rea­sonably gauge, from a distance, the process of domestication in Mexico, they would indicate a much more drawn-out process. Again, however, I would argue that rather than providng much clar­ification of either the location or relative timing for domestication of different crop plants, the Ocampo sequence points instead to the substan­tial temporal and geographical gaps that still exist in the basic cultural-historical framework of this complex transformational process. The timing and sequence of appearance of domesticated plants, particularly cucurbits, in the long-estab­lished sequences of Tehuacan and Oaxaca should be clarified by additional direct AMS dating of specimens. At the same time, a sustained effort should be undertaken to establish archaeobotani­cal sequences that span the Middle Holocene in other regions of Mexico through the excavation of both caves and open-air river valley settlements. 
It is also only through such excavation initia­tives that it will be possible to adequately address the most important and most elusive elements of the Era of Incipient Cultivation cultural-historical explanation-the pace of change and the cultural context during both the initial domestication of plants and the subsequent long transition to vil­lage-based maize-centered farming communities.

Notes 
I. Throughout this article, "B .P." indicates age estimates expressed in uncalibrated radiocarbon years, while "cal" is used to identify dendro-calibrated calendrical dates (e.g., 40SO cal B.C.). 
2. 
In his attempt to recognize cultural regularities and estab­lish a tentative developmental sequence for five centers of world civilization, including Mesoamerica, Steward (1949) first proposed the "Era of Incipient Cultivation" and described it as follows: "It must have been very long, pass­ing through several stages, which began when the first culti­vation of plant domesticates supplemented hunting and gathering, and ended when plant and animal breeding was able to support permanent communities [Steward 1949: 10] . ... Farming was at first supplementary to hunting and gath­ering, and the social groups were consequently small and probably semi-nomadic. Technologies differed little from those of the earlier hunting and gathering periods [Steward 1949: 17]." 

3. 
Plant remains were poorly preserved in Ojo de Agua cave and were limited in occurrence to the upper Palmillas level (1800-1100 B.P.) (Kaplan and MacNeish 1960:34). As a result, Ojo de Agua archaeobotanical assemblages played only a minimal role in the summary accounts of the Ocampo caves. 

4. 
A total of 46 Cucurbita peduncles were found in the Romero's and Valenzuela's cave collections, three more than the 43 counted in the initial analysis of these collections (Whitaker et al. 19S7:3S6). Several stem fragments, along with rind fragments where peduncles were once attached, that I included in the peduncle category rather than the rind category, quite likely account for this small discrepancy between the two studies. 


S. Of the two C. moschata peduncles Whitaker et al. (l 9S7:Figure Sb, Sc) illustrate, however, only one (Figure Sb, 247 /180) was classed as a type 2 peduncle here, highlighting the difficulties sometimes encountered in assigning pedun­cles to species categories. The other peduncle identified as C. moschata by Whitaker et al. (247/122) has a number of moschata-like characteristics. Its base partially flares abruptly outward, and it does not exhibit deep interridge creases. At the same time, however, it strongly resembles type 1 peduncles in size (maximum basal diameter 30.7 mm) and in having 10 distinct ridges and lobes-alternating large and small. Rather than assigning this peduncle to either type 1 (based on its size and 10 ridges) or type 2 (based on its shallow furrows and partially flaring base), it was placed in the unassigned Cucurbita sp. category (Table 4), along with 18 other peduncles, most of which were too fragmentary for type assignment. Another peduncle (247/88) illustrated by Whitaker et al. (19S7:Figure 6c) and identified as C. pepo was assigned in the present study not to type 1 but to type 2, based on its·small size (maximum basal diameter 17 mm), five ridges, shallow interridge furrows, flaring base, and basal ridge. To further complicate matters, a third peduncle illustrated by Whitaker et al. (19S7:Figure 6b) and identified as C. pepo similarly was not assigned to type 1 in the present study, since it actually appears to be a better candidate for inclusion in type 3. Based on its five prominent and grooved ridges and corky infilling of interridge creases, it resembles a type 3 peduncle from an immature fruit (G. Fritz, personal communication 1995). It too was placed in the unassigned Cucurbita sp. category (Table 4). 
6. 
If the bottle gourd rind fragments from occupations 1-4 of Romero's cave had similarly been counted as being from Valenzuela's cave, it could account for the initial identifica­tion of Lagenaria from Infiemillo-phase contexts in the Ocampo caves. 

7. 
On close inspection, the two 11-mm-long seeds in this group of six turned out to be mesquite (Prosopis). 

8. 
A controversial alternative chronological framework that places the domestication and diffusion of maize as early as 8000 B.P., based on the proposed presence of maize micro­fossil remains (pollen and phytoliths) in Central American and South American sites, has been proposed (e.g., Pearsall and Piperno 1990). See Fritz (1994a, 1994b), Pipemo (1994), Smith (1995a, 199Sb), and Rovner (1996) for a recent discussion of this controversy.
