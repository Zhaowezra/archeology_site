lights the importance of studying exterior (decorative) 
and interior styles (p. 109). The latter is not defined, 
but paste studies (mineralogy, granulometry, paste tex­
ture, and pigment composition) can distinguish one 
technical style from another and are particularly good 
for plain or non-diagnostic fragments. 
Beside these flaws, the synthesis and data theorization on Andean itinerant potters are probably Ramon's most important contribution to the field. His work joins ethno­graphical and ethnoarchaeological studies on ceramic production and distribution conducted in the Andes by Arnold, Bankes, Camino, Drue, Hagstrum, Mohr Chavez, Ravines, Roddick, Sabogal, Sillar, and many others. His conclusions underline the frequency of sea­sonal work and itinerancy as a way of life for many pot­ters (or as it used to be). He also discusses the opacifying 
(p. 119) effects of the concept of a vertical archipelago on recognizing the movement of potters and argues for a rehabilitation of plain ware study. The book ends with six appendices (pp. 137-167) with details about the fieldwork of the author, terminology, the reproduction of two ceramic ethnographic accounts (Briining's 1898 and Espejo 's 1951), and one of the interviews conducted by the author. 
In sum, his synthesis is empowering and highlights the many facets of the pottery trade, in which the golon­drinos play more than a marginal role. This book repre­sents a major contribution to the field and a longitudinal focus on ceramic domestic studies, but suffers from ques­tionable strategies in the use of sources.

In La Gente del Agua, Eduardo Williams attempts to shed light on the prehispanic aquatic life way of the Taras­can culture in western Mexico, undertaking an ethnoar­chaeological study to do so. The aquatic lifeway, as termed by Williams, is the culture system that resulted from a long history of human interaction with the aquatic ecological zones of the highlands lake basins in Western Mexico. This culture is the product of significant eco­logical adaptations; it supplemented an agriculturally based diet, facilitated trade, travel and interaction, and eventually was the foundation for the emergence of com­plex societies. Primarily deriving from the Lake Cuitzeo Basin, but also the Lake Chapala and Lake Patzcuaro basins, Williams's research incorporates ethnographic, 
ethnohistoric, and archaeological methods and datasets in order to investigate and reconstruct the prehispanic aquatic lifeway. This monograph adds to the literature devoted to lacustrine adaptations, such as research from the Basin of Mexico and the Toluca Valley. However, whereas these basins are constrained in their scope due to cultural change already having occurred by the twen­tieth century, the more modem ethnographic study pro­vided by Williams makes this research applicable throughout Highland Mesoamerica. 
Chapter 1 provides an introduction to the methods utilized in the study. Williams discusses the goals of the research, specifically the use of ethnography to gain a holistic understanding of the cultural and ecological adaptations in the study areas over time. This longitudinal study then incorporates these datasets into the creation of bridging arguments, in which archaeological data may be interpreted as representing dynamic human behavior, as it pertains to the aquatic lifeway. Williams then explains the use of ethnohistory as an ancillary attempt at providing correlates between human behavior and the material culture of the archaeological record. The sources of this data derive from several texts, including the Rela­cion de Michoacdn and the Relaciones geogrdficas, to 
name a few. 
In Chapter 2, Williams first starts by explaining the geography of the study areas. This is critical, as these highland lake systems, in the absence of major river net­works in Mesoamerica, form a unique ecological niche from which the adaptation of humans to these areas cre­ates a unique aquatic culture. Williams then outlines the prehispanic chronology, starting in the Early Formative (ca. 1500-500 B.C.), as informed by archaeological research from the study areas. Focusing on the three lake basins mentioned previously, Williams provides the tra­jectory of the evolution of this aquatic lifeway, first as it is seen in the prehispanic archaeological record, and then as it is transformed in the period of Spanish colonialism. 
This discussion of the tongue duree from Chapter 2 sets up Chapter 3, which details the recent historic and modern day ethnographies derived from Williams's detailed recording and analyses. This chapter discusses, first, the aquatic lifeway recorded in the Lake Cuitzeo Basin, and then the Lake Patzcuaro Basin. The discussion for each begins with the geographic setting of the lake basins, and then provides lists of aquatic plant and animal species, displaying the complex biological composition of the lake zones. The ethnographic section is divided into a discussion of three major aquatic activities: fishing, hunting, and gathering. Each activity is discussed in terms of their role in food procurement and craft produc­tion and is accompanied by photographs of the ethno­graphic subjects, activities, and tools. Williams himself points to the true importance of ethnoarchaeological

studies such as this: as a means to provide salvage ethnog­
raphy where "traditional" societies are rapidly trans­
forming, and where these aquatic lifeways are being 
dramatically altered or disappearing entirely. It is here 
that I find one of the most useful and enduring qualities 
of the book. 
The end of Chapter 3 then shifts focus to explaining 
the archaeological implications of these ethnographic 
studies; specifically how the ethnographic data is used 
to provide correlates for the interpretation of the archae­
ological record. Williams explains the archaeological 
artifacts related to aquatic activities of subsistence and 
details the importance of such aquatic resources. An 
excellent example of this is the documentation of net 
weights, or sinkers, which, in the ethnographic study, are 
represented by clay roof tiles and stones. Archaeologi­
cally, a distinct artifact class emerges that finds its cor­
relate in the net weight category; modified prehispanic 
potsherds (also referred to as recortados) were thought 
to have been used in the same manner as their ethno­
graphic, roof-tile counterpart. Similar correlates are 
detailed by Williams as they pertain to the three major 
aquatic activities (fishing, hunting, and gathering). 
Finally, the question of manufacturing, craft production, 
and the use of distinct spaces for aquatic activities are 
discussed, as they pertain to the archaeological record 
and its interpretation. 
Ethnohistoric data is used in Chapter 4 in the recon­
struction of the protohistoric and historic period 
economies, with specific attention paid to aquatic 
resources and activities. It is here that the discussion is 
broadened to include the political economy of the pre­
hispanic Tarascan state, as pertaining to the aquatic Jife­
way. WiJliams explains how it is no coincidence that the core of the Tarascan state occurred in a linked system of lake basins, each of which contained societies prac­ticing a complex lacustrine economy. Williams makes the case that researchers need to examine aquatic culture and resources in much the same way as they do agricul­tural land and resources. Williams convincingly argues that, upon the emergence of the Tarascan state, the importance of the aquatic lifeway was such that its role 
in the political economy not only was secured, but was 
a major cause for an increase in population and the suc­
cess of the state system. 
Chapter 5 provides a comparative analysis between 
other major lacustrine systems and their research, dis­
cussing areas such as the basin of Mexico, the Lerma 
Basin, areas in the Mayan region, and the Lake Titicaca 
region. This allows the reader to see the varying degrees 
by which aquatic lifeways have been recorded elsewhere, 
both ethnographically and archaeologically, and to what 
extent they can inform us of the cultural adaptations of 
prehispanic cultures. This multiregional, comparative 
analysis shows how such lacustrine adaptations can be 
critical cross-cultural variables when discussing the 
emergence of complex societies. 
Williams's La Gente de/Agua is an exemplary study 
in ethnoarchaeological research. It does an excellent job 
of providing an understanding of cultural and ecological 
adaptations as they relate to aquatic resources over time, 
as well as in creating bridging arguments that link the 
activities of the aquatic lifeway from the ethnographic 
present to the material culture of the archaeological past. 
Williams offers explicit methods, built upon a sound the­
oretical framework for his study, couched in processual 
concepts of middle range theory and a political economy 
framework. Indeed, this monograph is a testament to 
Williams's long history of research in Western Mexico 
and provides researchers, not only in this region, but 
elsewhere in Mesoamerica, a sound structure with which 
to study ecological adaptations and the dynamic 
processes of human-environment interactions, wonder­
fully linking the static archaeological record to the 
dynamic human behavior of the aquatic Jifeway. Finally, 
I must acknowledge an English version of William's monograph, published by the British Archaeological Reports International Series in 2014, and entitled Water Folk: Reconstructing an Ancient Aquatic Lifeway in Michoacdn, Western Mexico. The BAR publication, however, is a shortened version, with less imagery relat­ing to the ethnographic study, no comparative discussion (see Chapter 5), and less of a discussion of ethnohistoric sources and data.
