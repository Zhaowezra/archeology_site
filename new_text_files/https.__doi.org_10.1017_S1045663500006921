so Ii date the empire by integrating independent enclaves, and above all to weaken the Valley of Puebla, the Triple Alliance's main adversary. The king's administrative reforms were intended to augment the coherence of the empire, to hold the nobles in check, and to reinforce the authority of centralized power. Motecuhzoma's mark also touched the religious sphere with major reforms. For example, the replacement of Quetzalcoatl with Huitzilopochtli, the Mexica patron deity, had important consequences when the Spaniards were assimilated to Quetzalcoatl, who was believed to be returning to recover his kingdom. Graulich examines these early contacts in detail, the sojourn of the Spaniards in Tenochtitlan, the strange and impossible joint government of Motecuh­zoma and Cortes, and finally the controversial death of the tlatoani. 
One of the most significant contributions made by Graulich's work is to demystify Motecuhzoma's sup­posed cowardice in the face of the Spaniards. Many accounts attest to the fact that the tlatoani thought that the rich but decadent Mexica Empire was on the verge of collapse with the arrival of the invaders. In contrast, the king saw the Spaniards as full of vigor, and the mem­ory of the fall of Tollan filled him with anguish. Having said that, Graulich demonstrates that after sizing up the power of the newcomers-for example, by influencing the Mayas who attacked them in Cinda-the Mexica king adopted several strategies to resist their advance, such as magical tactics inspired by myths. And so, Mote­cuhzoma sent to the coast an individual who resembled Cortes so strongly that even the Spaniards, amused by the act, called him Cortes. Graulich keenly detects that the tlatoani hoped to reproduce Tezcatlipoca's maneuver at Tollan by placing a mirror before Quetzalcoatl to con­fuse him. Unfortunately, the conqueror was oblivious to the ruse. At the same time, Motecuhzoma employed more drastic measures to fight against the foreigners. According to Graulich, the Cholula massacre-com­monly cited to condemn Cortes's gratuitous violence­must have been an ambush. Accused, Motecuhzoma had to confess that his troops were surrounding the city, and the Spanish garrison in Veracruz was attacked at the same moment as the trap set at Cholula. Graulich empha­sizes the tactical interest of this attempt to do away with the conquistadores in a closed location where the efficacy of Spanish weaponry was diminished. At the same time, the author believes that during the Toxcatl festival, in Cortes's absence, the Mexicas attempted to eliminate the Spaniards. These elements contribute to reappraising Motecuhzoma's personality. The tlatoani's pride and tyranny can now be situated within the context of the myths that the victims of the conquest forged to explain the punishment of the transgressor king, the scapegoat of the catastrophe of the conquest. They also spread the image of defenseless pacific Indians who waited until 
the last moment to fight against the Spaniards, who per­petrated unwarranted slaughter. Graulich breaks with this cliche, which is in fact humiliating and slanderous for the ancient Mexicans, and he shows that the Mexicas indeed defended themselves, and above all that Mote­cuhzoma was not the superstitious cowardly sovereign who abandoned his empire without putting up a fight against the foreigners.

Together with drug production and distribution, mining is one of the most significant macroeconomic activities currently transforming the Andes, and particularly Bolivia and Peru. In the past decade alone, these two countries have figured among the world's highest pro­ducers of both cocaine and precious metals. Every archaeologist working in the Andean highlands is imme­diately confronted with two issues: it is better not to cross paths with drug activity while doing survey, and it is better not to interfere with the big mines. Regarding archaeological heritage, mining is far more destructive than narco activities, since many of the main mines and the highways or conducts specially built to transport pre­cious materials to the coast are on or near archaeological sites. In this context, a substantial book like the one edited by Tripcevich and Vaughn on mining and quar­rying is more than welcome. It shows the potential of this field of study and will also serve as a sort of testi­mony, before many of these archaeological sites vanish. 
The volume includes an introduction by the editors, 13 specific chapters, and two closing discussions. The geographical scope of the book covers four countries (Bolivia, Chile, Ecuador, and Peru) but 8 of the 13 articles are related to Southern Peru. Only one small reference is devoted to northern Peru (in Brooks, Schworbel, and Castillo), and only one chapter partially deals with Ecuador (Ogburn). While most of the articles include dif­ferent amounts of ethnographic and historical informa­tion, there are two explicitly devoted to ethnography (Roddick and Klarich; Jennings et al). The two commen­tators, Burger and Shimada, who both have much expe­rience on the topic, provide excellent discussions indicating the achievements and limitations of each of the chapters, so I recommend the reader to start with those texts. In general, some of the specific chapters show the

sustained interest of the author(s) on the topic (e.g., Salazar et al; Tripcevich and Contreras), while others mostly suggest the intention of the author(s) to continue to pursue research on mining, with no actual hypotheses or articulated results in hand. At the same time, some arti­cles include very clear research questions (e.g., Janusek et al, Vaughn et al) while others are mostly devoted to indicating the potential of the topic in the specific region where the authors work (e.g., Reindel, Stollner and Graf­ingholt; Shultze ). It would have been greatto have a book with more uniform standards, meanwhile, as Shimada stated" ... this book has a definite preliminary character." 
Studies about mining and quarrying are important on no less than four levels: (1) to document the activity in itself (e.g., How was mining performed in the remote past? How was it conceived? How were people organized to exploit mineral resources?); (2) to show how mining and quarrying relate to and potentially modify our overall picture of the societies of that remote past (e.g., Was mining the main productive activity in any of those spe­cific societies? Did those societies include specialized groups devoted to mining or quarrying activities? How did these activities impact the economies of those soci­eties?); (3) since provenience studies are crucial to under­standing relations between different areas through material evidence, performing deeper analysis of quarries and mines can provide the basis to better understand dis­tribution networks and to place specific findings in a regional context; and (4) to indicate relative values of archaeological materials depending on distance and/or difficulty of access of mined or quarried resources. This is especially significant, given that much of the archae­ological record is constituted by materials that were at one point mined or quarried. The studies included in this book contribute in these four senses. However, I must express my disappointment regarding quarrying for pot­tery. The literature on this topic in the Andes is so vast that it seems underrepresented in this book, not so much because there is only one chapter devoted to the topic, but because that literature has not been used compara­tively in the other chapters. 
To close, there is one major issue that runs through all of the chapters that warrants further discussion: How can we identify and understand mining and quarrying in the remote past? This question is the starting point to articulate data collected in the field and to integrate the different disciplines implied in research about mining and quarrying (archaeology, ethnography, and history, among others). If we look at the chapters devoted to the Late Horizon (e.g., Cantarutti; Ogburn; Salazar, Borie and Ofiate) the method is clear. First, the early colonial data on the activity is put together, and then this data is compared with the archaeological material. However, things get muddy when working with earlier times, like the Early Intermediate Period or Middle Horizon. Aware of these issues, when dealing with the symbolic impor­tance of a mine, Vaughn and his colleagues observed: 
"Though we do not wish to draw a direct analogy between the ethnographic present, the Inca, and the pre­Incaic Andes we offer two lines of artifactual evidence to suggest that Mina Primavera was symbolically impor­tant to those who exploited it. .. " In different ways, most of the chapters touch this point (e.g., Van Gijseghem et al). Regarding a similar issue (i.e., the limits of analogy and generalization), Shimada noticed that several authors assumed the prestige of certain materials in those remote periods, ignoring" ... such critical factors as the organi­zation and management of their production sites, pro­ductive outputs, and the contexts and manners in which products were utilized." He emphasizes the importance of analyzing such contexts when considering the oper­ational sequence "based more on pertinent empirical data from primary context excavations and archaeometric and experimental testing of excavated evidence ... than on inferences or assumptions built on ethnohistoric, ethnographic, and/or modem material scientific data." Thus, we arrive at the book's core. I agree with most of Shimada's criticisms, and even with his main objective, but I take a slightly different approach. We need to remember that there is nothing like a purely archaeolog­ical discussion, and even Shimada's interpretative frames or concepts (operational sequence and technological choice) are ethnographic products .resulting from ethno­graphic experiences that have been systematized. Our models will always (implicitly or explicitly) include that kind of evidence or noise (exactly the same occurred decades ago with the verticality model and the ayllu). This is the case with mining and quarrying because the selection of what Shimada calls "empirical data" about those activities is conditioned by our models, which ulti­mately come from ethnography and/or history. They are unavoidable. What we need is a wider and more sophis­ticated database of ethnographical and historical evidence on the subject, to be able to play with different options, not to impose a single one. Even if this book is devoted to the "Ancient Andes," most of the chapters have ref­erences to colonial or post-colonial times. However, what is lacking is a panorama enriched by multiple cases in different latitudes a11d altitudes, considering different forms of extraction, and by bibliographies that go beyond the most obvious written sources. This will allow us to develop more nuanced and varied models on mining and quarrying. Overall, the book edited by Tripcevich and Vaughn is a valuable step in that direction.
