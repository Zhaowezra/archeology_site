SALINAS DE LOS NUEVE CERROS, GUATEMALA: 
A MAJOR ECONOMIC CENTER IN THE 
SOUTHERN MAYA LOWLANDS

Salinas de los Nueve Cerros is a precolumbian Maya city located at the base of the highlands in the lowlands of west-central Guatemala. It is the only Classic-period center in the southern Maya Lowlands that based its economy on the production of an important raw material for export: salt. Because of its economic role and its location along a major trade route, Salinas de los Nueve Cerros had a particularly long history of occupation. The site has evidence of a large sedentary pop­ulation starting during the Middle Preclassic (by ca. 800 B.C.) that continued several hundred years beyond the Classic collapse, before finally being abandoned ca. A.D. 1200. The salt source was located in the center of the city. This presents a rare opportunity to test the degree of elite control over the production of a non-elite resource. Production during the Classic period does appear to have been tightly controlled by elites, as evinced by the presence of multiple administrative structures and elite tombs throughout the salt-working zone, located less than JOO mfrom the site epicenter. 
Salinas de los Nueve Cerros es una ciudad maya precolombina ubicada al pie del Altiplano en la zona occidental-central de Guatemala. Es el unico centro de la epoca Cldsica que bas6 su econom{a en la producci6n de una materia cruda de alta impor­tancia, la sal. Esta producci6n fue controlada por las elites de la ciudad durante la epoca Cldsica y posiblemente antes, como estd evidenciado por la presencia de multiples estructuras administrativas y tumbas dentro de la zona de producci6n de sal. Por su ubicaci6n sabre una fuente de sal al Lado del rfo Chixoy, tuvo una ocupaci6n particularmente larga, con evidencia de un asentamiento grande empezando en el Precldsico Media Temprano (ca. 900 a.C.) y terminando hasta los finales del Poscldsico Temprano (ca.1200 d.C.). Por estar localizado en lafrontera entre las Tierras Altas del norte (al sur de/ sitio), las Tierras Bajas de! suroccidente (al norte) y Chiapas (al oeste), ten{a residentes provenientes de varias otras regiones de! mundo maya y mantuvo contactos con todas las distintas zonas en la mayor parte de su historia. Durante el Cldsico Terminal (800­900 d.C.), sus residentes lograron conexiones con las ciudades florecientes de las Tierras Altas def norte, por lo cual sobrevivieron unos siglos mas que sus iwinos de las Tierras Bajas, solo siendo abandonado alrededor de! 1200 d.C. Lafuente de sal sigui6 siendo importante despues de su rolapso, siendo explotada por varios grupos mayas, espaiioles y guatemaltecos a traves de las epocas Poscldsicas, colonial y moderna, con el ultimo intento de producci6n de sal formal ocurriendo durante la decada de 1980.

resisted Spanish control for over a century, only succumbing to conquest in the 1690s (King 1974). At this point, the Spaniards took possession of the salt source, transforming it into afinca (plan­tation) named Las Salinas de los Nueve Cerros ("The Saltworks of the Nine Hills"). 
While Nueve Cerros has typically been classi­fied as a northern highland site due to its location in the department of Alta Verapaz, it is actually located in the Maya lowlands (Dillon 1987) and is part of the Transversal region (Demarest 2013; Demarest et al 2014; Demarest et al. 2008; Wood­fill 2010) that runs east-west along the base of the Cuchumatan Mountains.1 The site is found on the banks of the Chixoy River, which has long been known as a major artery connecting the Maya highlands and lowlands throughout history (Adams 1978; Andrews V 1990; Amauld 1990; Brown 1985; Dillon 1977; Hammond 1972; Seier 1993). Recent research both at Cancuen (Demarest 2013) and Nueve Cerros (Woodfill et al. 2013) has shown that the Transversal also was the location of an east-west trade route that connected southeastern Peten with the present Mexican states of Chiapas and Tabasco. As a consequence, the site continu­ously demonstrates strong ties with regions on both sides of the highland-lowland divide and the Guatemala-Mexico border.

Nueve Cerros has an exceptionally long his­tory, with ample evidence of occupation spanning the Middle Preclassic (ca. 800 B.C.) through Early Postclassic (A.D. 900-1200) periods (Woodfill et al. 2014). Evidence of occupation and salt production after the Spanish conquest can be found on and around the salt dome, in­cluding china ware (Woodfill et al. 2011 ); large riveted cast-iron pans for boiling down the brine dating to the end of the nineteenth century (Dillon 1979); and a cinderblock and PVC basin at one of the brine springs from the last attempt to com­mercialize the salt during the 1980s (Gregorio Mendez, personal communication to Dillon 1990; Mariano Pop, personal communication to Wood­fill 2012). The small oil companies that have been 
periodically exploiting the deposits located un­derneath the dome since the 1950s have also left their mark, including the ruins of the first oil camp in the region, graded roads on the salt dome, an air strip, and three abandoned wells. 
The purpose of this article is to present new data recovered from Nueve Cerros and to place the data within larger discussions about the Clas­sic Maya economy. Despite the fact that pioneer­ing work at the site was carried out in 1975 (Dil­lon 1977, 1979)-four decades ago-Nueve Cerros has not been adequately incorporated into our understanding of Classic Maya interregional interactions and trade. Our research demonstrates that this important urban center was fully inte­grated into the economy of the Western Maya

A History of Investigations at 
Salinas de Los Nueve Cerros 


The first Spanish mention of the Nueve Cerros salt source was in 1620 (Salazar 2000). Shortly thereafter, Tovilla (2000), the governor of Verapaz and the former head of royal salt production in Spain, took interest in this new lowland source. Nevertheless, he was unable to establish a perma­nent Spanish presence in the location. In spite of broad recognition of the salt flats and brine stream in the site core throughout the colonial and early republican periods (van Akkeren 2003; Feldman 2000; Sapper 1985; Thompson 1970; Viana et al. 1955), the archaeological site associated with the natural resource was not mentioned until the late nineteenth century, when Simeon Habel (1878) visited the saltworks. Karl Sapper (1897, 1901) came soon thereafter and removed a red sandstone monument with glyphs that was subsequently pub­lished by Seier (I 902-23:IIl:facing page 578). 
The site returned to obscurity after Sapper's visit for 80 years until Brian Dillon began research there in the 1970s (Dillon 1977, 1979). He returned in 1990 to salvage several large salt storage vessels for display in the National Museum of Guatemala (Figure 3; Dillon 1990). Several Guatemalan ar­chaeological salvage projects returned to the site over the years (Arroyo 1993; Geopetrol 2005; Leal 2006). In 2009, local community leaders invited Woodfill and his team into the region to assist with the development of locally managed ecotourism at the site (Woodfill 2013). Research began in 2010 and has continued each subsequent year, with Dillon returning to work with the present project during the 2011 field season. 
A Description of Salinas de los Nueve Cerros 
Salinas de los Nueve Cerros is located in a par­ticularly hot, swampy segment of the Chixoy floodplain seven km north of the Sierra de Chama. It typically experiences temperatures up­wards of 30°C and receives an average of 2,252 mm of precipitation a year (INSIVUMEH 2003),

ranking it among the wettest regions of the Maya 
world. 
The site is defined by three primary geograph­ical features (see Figure 1). The Cerro Tortugas salt dome, brine stream, and several salt flats are located in the center of the city. The 21-km-long Nueve Cerros ridge, which contains multiple caves and freshwater springs, forms the western border of the site. The Chixoy River forms the northern border of the site and would have connected its residents to cities throughout the western Maya world. The brine stream, salt flats, and Chixoy all perpetually shift locations, having moved, ex­panded, or contracted since Dillon's work in the 1970s and 1990. 

The epicenter of the site stretches over a kilo­meter north-south atop a slight natural rise between the Tortugas dome and the Nueve Cerros ridge. It is bordered by saltwater swamps to the east and freshwater swamps to the west. The northernmost part of the site, the Tierra Blanca group, also is lo­cated atop naturally high ground-several densely occupied ancient levees separated by low, wet areas with minimal evidence of architecture that would have been highly productive agricultural zones (Woodfill et al. 2014). Tierra Blanca has the longest documented occupation history in the re­gion to date, ranging from the Middle Preclassic (ca. 800 B.C.) through the Early Postclassic (after ca. A.D. 1000). Due to its proximity to the river, this area likely served as the port of the city, al­though this has not yet been proven conclusively. 
A series of plaza groups, some with monu­mental stone sculptures identified by Dillon ( 1977, 1979, 1987), spans most of the base of the northern slope of the salt dome. Another area, Tortugas, is located immediately south of the site epicenter along the base of the Nueve Cerros ridge. Prelim­inary research (Dillon 1977; Woodfill et al. 2012) has determined that both of these areas were pri­marily occupied during the Classic period. 
While settlement among these three areas was contiguous during the Late Classic, they continued to have a significantly distinct material culture. Table 1 shows the relative proportions of northern highland, southern lowland, and local ceramic tra­ditions in these three zones during the Late Clas­sic. Tortugas is distinct from the other two zones with almost no access to foreign materials or in­terest in foreign styles. This could indicate varia-

The Great SaJt Debates and 
Salinas de los Nueve Cerros 


Dillon's initial research visit to Salinas de los Nueve Cerros in 1975 was motivated by his study of Spanish Colonial references to salt, its impor­tance in the aboriginal diet, and its significance as a trade item (Dillon 1975:98-104; see also Mendizabal 1929). Anthony Andrews, also en­gaged in studying ancient saltworks (Andrews 1980, 1983), visited Dillon at Nueve Cerros while both were engaged in their dissertation research. Shortly thereafter, a debate about the role of salt in the Classic Maya diet and economy began. This lasted for more than a decade (Andrews 1980, 1983, 1984, 1998; Dillon 1988; Dillon et al. 1988; MacKinnon and Kepecs 1991; Marcus 1991 , 1994; Marquez 1982; Mock 1994; Pohl 1985; Valdez and Mock 1991; White et al. 1993). One side argued for the biological necessity of salt in a meat-poor tropical diet, while the other held that salt was more of a luxury and could be obtained through other means, such as burning palm fronds. One of us (Dillon 1988) also questioned the gen­eral assumption of a meat-poor Maya diet. The basic model proposed was that the northern coast of the Yucatan Peninsula, which continues to be a major salt production zone today, provided most of the salt to the ancient Maya world (e.g., An­drews 1980, 1983). 
As the debate has continued into the twenty­first century, there has been a diminished emphasis on the biological necessity of salt, shifting instead to whether other saltworks beyond the north coast could have sustained regions of the Maya world. The southern Maya lowlands have very little evi­dence of sustained trade with northern Yucatan,

Woodfill et al.] SALINAS DE LOS NUEVE CERROS, GUATEMALA 
and multiple saltworks have been identified along the Belizean coast (Andrews and Mock 2002; McKillop 1995, 2002). More recently, Fenner and Wright (2014) returned to an examination of di­etary salt, proposing that the higher than predicted strontium levels present in Classic-period bones from Tikal could be explained by high salt con­sumption -9 .2 g per adult per day, even higher than the controversial 8 g originally proposed by Andrews (1980). 
Salt deficiency (hiponatremia) is a serious mat­ter, which in extended situations can lead to nau­sea, confusion, heart and liver failure, brittle bones, seizures, coma, and death (Schrier 2010). Our tastes (and indeed the tastes of much of the world) tend toward adding much more salt than is neces­sary or even healthy for bioregulatory functions, since we, like other mammals, like its flavor. Thus, it is often treated less like a biological necessity and more like a spice and can serve a variety of other functions, such as preserving food and fixing dyed textiles (Williams 2010). For all of these reasons, we can and should consider it a desirable good, one that was sought out for exchange and consumption throughout the history of the Maya world and, indeed, the human species. 
In relation to the debates regarding the geo­graphical origin of commercial salt, the Nueve Cerros data do come down on the side of McKil­lop (2002): there is little direct evidence of inter­action and exchange between the southern low­lands and the saltworking sites of Yucatan. As discussed in the following section, Nueve Cerros alone would have been able to produce sufficient salt to meet the conceivable demands of much of the Classic Maya economy. Its location along the major western river system would also have made it easy to distribute salt throughout the western and central Maya lowlands. 
The Classic-Period Saltworks and Potential Scale of Salt Production at Nueve Cerros 

The salt production zone (Figure 4) is located atop an artificial platform that juts out from the base of the salt dome. It is unclear where the artificial fill begins and the natural slope of the dome ends, but excavations performed by Dillon in the 1970s reached a depth of 9 .5 m before hitting the water table inside Late Preclassic fill (Dillon 1979, Dillon et al. 1988). The production zone consists of 24 structures, including multiple large stepped plat­forms containing elite tombs that are located atop upwards of 1,200,000 m3 of artificial fill. These are adjacent to salt workshops with ovens and the Atzam Red "vasijonas" (giant ceramic bowls with diameters nearing 2 m; Figure 3) used to store the brine before it is boiled down (Dillon et al. 1988). 
Trenching the western slope, Dillon (1979; Dil­lon et al. 1985) uncovered several earlier structures that were buried during renovations. These also contained well-stocked elite <ombs dating as far back as the Early Classic. Other later tombs at the site contained many dozens of complete ce­ramic vessels and jade ornaments. Overall, the elite burial pattern bespeaks great wealth and con­tacts far beyond the local area (Dillon 1981 a, 1987; Dillon and Christensen 2005). 
The most dramatic and idiosyncratic of the Nueve Cerros burials, Tomb 5, contained an Early Classic elite burial accompanied by chronologi­cally diagnostic ceramic and jade offerings (Dillon et al. 1985, Dillon and Christensen 2005). The individual within it may have had the frontal part of his skull removed for facial modeling and dis­play above ground for a long period of time after the initial interment. Stratigraphic and ceramic evidence clearly indicates that during the early part of the Late Classic Tomb 5 was reopened via an intrusive pit dug through the plaster floor of the structure that had been built above it (Dillon et al. 1985:Figure 6). During this revisit, the miss­ing facial bones were replaced, laid atop fill that now partially covered the preexisting skeleton (Dillon and Christensen 2005:Figure 3). The de­ceased was also honored with an entirely new set of offerings during this second visit-24 crudely made small ceramic vessels, many with lids, con­taining 29 human finger bones that were presum­ably the result of self-amputation, 26 whole or intentionally broken obsidian prismatic blades, and a clam shell (Dillon et al. 1985:Figure 2). While there is little reason to believe that elites were directly involved in the day-to-day boiling of the brine and scraping of the salt flats, their presence was remembered through the constant renovation, expansion, and construction of the area, and even as newer elite structures and tombs were built, the presence of earlier elites was im­printed into the everyday practice of the area.
