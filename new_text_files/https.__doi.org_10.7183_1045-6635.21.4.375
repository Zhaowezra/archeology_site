SEX-SPECIFIC PHENOTY PIC VARIABILITY AND SOCIAL 
ORGANIZATION IN THE CHIRIBAYA OF SOUTHERN PERU 

Kenneth C. Nystrom and Christine M. Malcom 
Analyses of skeletal phenotypic traits have the potential to yield information pertaining to social organization, such as kin­ship and residence patterns. In this research, we examine sex-specific phenotypic variability of craniofacial and mandibu­lar metric traits in eight skeletal samples from four sites (San Geronimo, Chiribaya Alta, Chiribaya Baja, and El Yara/) attributed to the Chiribaya polity (A.D. 772-1350) and a contemporary llo-Tumilaca!Cabuza group (El Algodonal) from southern Peru. Through this data set we investigate various aspects of social organization (e.g., postmarital residence pat­terns) within the Chiribaya polity. We also examine Chiribaya interactions with the contemporaneous, yet culturally dis­tinct, Tumilaca cultural group. The pattern of between-group bias-corrected estimates of biological distances points toward a more distant biological relationship between the two cultures than has previously been reported. Among the Chiribaya groups considered, determinant ratio analyses indicate that males from two cemeteries (Chiribaya Alta Cemetery 4 and Chiribaya Alta Cemetery 7) were significantly more variable than females, suggesting that males were the more mobile sex. Several explanatory models are considered, including a matrilocal residence pattern and the in-migration of males. We also examine the unique nature of results from within Chiribaya Alta, which support the argument made by previous researchers that this site represents a regional political center.

Cerna and Buikstra 2005; Tomczak 2003). Bio­cultural data indicate internal social differentiation from early on in the Chiribaya cultural sequence (Buikstra et al. 2005); isotopic dietary reconstruc­tion specifically connects markers of differentia­tion (e.g., mortuary behavior and cranial modification styles) to differential control and con­sumption of specific resources (Buikstra et al. 2005). Thus, the main distinction made within Chiribaya seems to exist between coastal pescadores and inland agricultural labradores (Buikstra et al. 2005). While they were distin­guished from each other by diet, mortuary behav­ior, and outward manifestations of social identity (e.g., artificial cranial modification), the absence of significant biological distances suggests that these ethnic groups were not endogamous. Reliance upon modern ethnographic scholarship (Burton and White 1984; Korotayev 2003; Murdock 1949), sup­ported by archaeological and biological evidence for the subsistence practices of the groups in ques­tion, would suggest the presence of within-and between-ethnic group female exogamy and patrilo­cality as the structuring principles of Chiribaya social organization. The current research will exam­ine within-cemetery sex-specific phenotypic vari­ability in craniomandibular metric traits as a means of investigating social practices, including post­marital residence and mate exchange patterns among the Chiribaya polity in the Osmore drainage, southern Peru. As postmarital residence is linked with the formation of descent groups, sociopoliti­cal authority, and resource control, this research will complement previous research on polity-level social organization of the Chiribaya as well as pro­vide a novel perspective on prehistoric social orga­nization in the Andes. 
Previous Research on 
Chiribaya Social Organization 

Chiribaya was initially identified in mortuary mate­rial culture by Ghersi ( 1956) and established as a cultural phenomenon extending from Tambo in the north to Azapa in the south, with most sites con­centrated in the coastal and Middle Osmore river valleys. Research on Chiribaya has been guided by a biocultural approach that integrates data drawn from skeletal biology with archaeological infor­mation. As a result, investigators have been able to reconstruct significant portions of the lifeways of Chiribaya groups who inhabited the south coast of Peru (Figure 1) during the Middle Horizon (ca. 
A.D. 
500-1000) and late Intermediate period (ca. 

A.D. 
1000-1300 [Buikstra et al. 2005; Knudson and Buikstra 2007; Knudson et al. 2007; Lozada Cerna 1998; Sutter 2000; Tomczak 2003]). 


The picture that has emerged is of Chiribaya as an overarching sefiorfo (Buikstra et al. 2005; Lozada Cerna and Buikstra 2002, 2005) with inter­nal ethnic differentiation based upon resource spe­cialization. The most marked differentiation within 
' Chiribaya is evident between the coastal pescadores and inland agricultural labradores (Buikstra et al. 2005; Lozada Cerna and Buikstra 2005; Tomczak 2003), though recently Zaro and colleagues have documented intrasite economic diversification at Chiribaya sites along the intervalley coast north of the Ilo Valley (Zaro 2007; Zaro and Alvarez 2005; Zaro et al., this issue). These two ethnic identities have been established based on geographic loca­tion and locally available resources, material cul­ture related directly to economic production (e.g., fishing and farming implements recovered from domestic and mortuary contexts), expressive mate­rial culture (e.g., ceramic form and style), and the cultural practice of artificial cranial modification. Pescadores are found primarily at the site of San Geronimo and Chiribaya Alta Cemetery 4. These individuals are associated with numerous grave goods, ceramics classified as Chiribaya-San Geronimo (Jessup 1990; Lozada Cerna 1998), and an annular style of cranial modification. The labradores, in contrast, are found at the inland sites of Chiribaya Baja and El Yara! as well as in sev­eral cemeteries at ChiribayaAlta. With the notable exception of Chiribaya Alta Cemetery 7, fewer grave goods are generally found in labradores tombs, ceramics are of the Chiribaya-Algarrobal and Chiribaya-Yaral types, fronto-occipital cranial modification styles predominate, and fewer indi­viduals have modified crania in general (Jessup 1990; Lozada Cerna 1998). 
In Rostworoski' s ( 1970) "horizontality" model, the individual communities that control specific resources are socially bounded, endogamous units. Within Chiribaya, the recognition and maintenance of ethnic difference through distinct styles of cra­nial modification, variation in domestic and grave goods, dietary patterning, and geographic distance

Figure 1. Map of the Osmore Valley with the Chiribaya sites examined in this research noted. 
(see the Material section below for more informa­tion) would support this contention. Previous research, however, has concluded that these out­ward manifestations of social differentiation do not reflect the endogamous populations that Rost­woroski describes (Lozada Cerna and Buikstra 2005). For example, Lozada Cerna and Buikstra (2005:216) found no clear pattern of significant biological distances between Chiribayapescadores and labradores. The authors suggest that social practices, such as political marriages or annual rit­uals, may have eliminated between-group genetic differences through small amounts of gene flow. Furthermore, the presence of nonlocal individuals in Chiribaya samples, identified via strontium iso­tope signatures (Knudson and Buikstra 2007), sug­gests that neither the economically specialized communities nor Chiribaya society as a whole were closed to gene flow. 
This body of within-Chiribaya work is com­plemented by research examining the relationship between Chiribaya and other cultural groups found in and around the Osmore River Valley before, dur­ing, and after Chiribaya formation and fluores­cence. In particular, the origin of the Chiribaya tradition has received considerable attention, with some researchers attributing them to migrant high­land populations (Sutter 2000, 2009), and others, to autochthonous groups (Buikstra et al. 2005; Lozada Cerna 1998; Lozada Cerna and Buikstra 2005). In their examination of nonmetric cranio­facial traits, Lozada Cerna and colleagues (Buik-

stra et al. 2005; Lozada Cerna 1998; Lozada Cerna and Buikstra 2005) found that late Intermediate Chiribaya groups (San Geronimo, Chiribaya Alta, Chiribaya Baja, El Yara!) exhibited a closer bio­logical relationship to a Formative period coastal group (Roca Verde, 500 B.C.-A.D. 200) and a sig­nificant biological distance from the mid-valley Tiwanaku colony of Chen Chen (A.D. 725-950). On the other hand, using nonmetric dental traits, Sutter (2000, 2009) suggests that the Chiribaya represent an intrusive highland population. Sutter (2000) found that Archaic period (A.D. 800-1000) samples from coastal Ilo Valley (Yara, Km 4) were more similar to Archaic groups from the Azapa Valley to the south than they were to the late Inter­mediate period Chiribaya he examined (Chiribaya Alta, San Geronimo, El Yara!). 
Additionally, there has been work that consid­ers the biological relationship between Chiribaya populations and the Ilo-Tumilaca/Cabuza. Both domestic and mortuary assemblages from Ilo­Tumilaca/Cabuza sites are distinct from Chiribaya, and Owen ( 1993, 2005) argues that the two groups were competitive, with Chiribaya expanding at the expense of other local groups, including llo­Tumilaca/Cabuza. However, Lozada Cerna ( 1998) found that the two cultural groups seem to have shared styles of cranial modification and that biodistances derived from nonmetric craniofacial traits did not exclude the possibility of gene flow between them. 
Phenotypic Morphology and the Reconstruction of Social Organization 
While cranial and dental morphology have been used in biological distance analyses across the Andes in a number of different geographical and temporal contexts (e.g., Blom et al. 1998; Nystrom 2006; Rothhammer et al. 1982; Rothhammer et al. 1984, Sutter 2006; Sutter and Mertz 2004; Varela et al. 2008; Verano 2003), the analysis of within­group craniodental morphology can yield infor­mation on kinship, mating structure, and residential practices (Birkby 1982; Bondioli et al. 1986; Cor­ruccini 1972; Hubbe et al. 2009; Kennedy 198 I; Schillaci and Stojanowski 2003, 2005; Spence l 974a, l 974b; Stojanowski 2003, 2005a; Sto­janowski and Schillaci 2006). The consideration of intra-cemetery analyses of sex-specific phenotypic 
variability in order to reconstruct postmarital resi­dence patterns began with the work of Lane and Sublett (1972) and Spence (I974a, I974b). These analyses rely upon partitioning female and male components of population variation based on mor­phological data, such as cranial (Birkby l 982; Cor­ruccini I972; Lane and Sublett I 972) and dental nonmetric traits (Corruccini and Shimada 2002) and cranial metrics (Spence I 974b). Konigsberg (1988) has expanded on these analyses by placing them in a population genetics framework to address and verify several fundamental assumptions, 
' including that differential sex-specific migration over multiple generations results in measurable dif­ferences in phenotypic variability. Despite the potential contribution that these analyses can pro­vide, such research has remained infrequent (Hub be et al. 2009; Schillaci and Stojanowski 2003 ; Ste­fan 1999; Stojanowski and Schillaci 2006; Tom­czak and Powell 2003). The analysis of intra-cemetery variability in the Andes has been limited, with the notable exception of Shimada and colleagues' work at Huaca Lorn (Corruccini and Shimada 2002; Shimada et al. 2004). These researchers examined the dental metric variability of elite individuals from the West and East tombs of Huaca Loro (A.D. I000). The authors ultimately suggest that the heterogeneity demonstrated in the "north" females could be indicative of patrilocal­ity (Corruccini and Shimada 2002; Shimada et al. 2004 ), whereas intrasample variance in the "south" females could reflect biological homogeneity (Cor­ruccini and Shimada 2002). 
Theoretical and Methodological Assumptions 
Analyses of sex-specific phenotypic variability in any data set rest upon several fundamental theo­retical assumptions: 
1. 
Closely related individuals will share more alleles in common than distantly related individu­als, as well as experience similar levels of environment-related phenotypic variance. 

2. 
There is no difference between the sexes in environment-related phenotypic variance (Konigs­berg 1988; see Lees and Relethford 1982 for con­trary evidence). 


The heritability estimates for metric variables 
(which we employ here) are generally lower than those for odontometrics (for recent discussions, see 
Downloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core. YBP Library Services, on 22 Aug 2018 at 17:32:05, subject to the Cambridge Core terms of use, available at https://www.cambridge.org/core/terms. https://doi.org/10.7183/1045-6635.21.4.375 


Carson 2006; Konigsberg and Ousley 1995; Scott and Turner 1997; Stojanowski 2005b). However, these data still have value for differentiating between populations or, in the case of the current research, examining sex-specific phenotypic variability. 
Comparatively low heritability estimates for cran­iometric traits have led some to argue that cranio­metric data are more heavily impacted by environmental influences, rendering them less reli­able in the reconstruction of biological relationships. 1 However, heritabilities only explain the amount of additive genetic variance relative to total variance in a single population and within a single generation, and as genetic variance is reshuffled each genera­tion, heritabilities can change substantially from one generation to the next. Furthermore, high heritabil­ity does not mean that traits are any less susceptible to environmental variance (Stojanowski 2005b ). 
If the theoretical assumptions stated above hold true, even in the face of low heritabilities and high environmental variance, closely related individu­als will share more alleles in common and experi­ence similar environments (e.g., diet, climate); thus they will be phenotypically more similar relative to other such groups. We cannot and do not dis­count the impact of the environment in the pro­duction of the phenotype and acknowledge that in reality we are reconstructing biocultural relation­ships. 
Further, there are three assumptions that specif­ically relate to the reconstruction of postmarital residence (Konigsberg 1988; Lane and Sublett 1972; Schillaci and Stojanowski 2003 ): 
I. Postmarital migration patterns are constant or relatively fixed for the time periods under consid­eration. 
2. For within-group analyses, the sex that demonstrates the greater variability is the more mobile sex in terms of postmarital residence. The nonmobile sex would be theoretically composed of related individuals who would exhibit similar phe­notypic variance and covariance due to common inheritance. 

3. 
For between-group analyses, the sex that demonstrates greater between-group variability represents the nonmobile sex. Theoretically, the nonmobile sex would not experience the homoge­nizing effects of gene flow and will therefore exhibit greater between-group variance and genetic divergence. 


Finally, there are a number of methodological assumptions (analysis of the impact of these assumptions is presented below): 
1. 
The sex of each individual can be accurately estimated from skeletal morphology. 

2. 
The cemetery-specific sample sizes used in these analyses are of sufficient size to serve as an accurate representation of the community. 

3. 
Artificial modification of the crania does not impact sex-specific phenotypic variability. 


Material 
Metric data were collected by CM from four Chirib­aya skeletal collections (San Geronimo, Chiribaya Alta, Chiribaya Baja, and El Yaral; Figure 1) and one Ilo-Tumilaca/Cabuza collection (El Algo­donal). These same samples have been examined previously by several researchers, making it pos­sible to articulate results from the current research with the isotopic reconstruction of diet (Knudson et al. 2007; Tomczak 2003) and residential mobil­ity (Knudson and Buikstra 2007), as well as to compare results from craniometric data to pheno­typic variability reflected in cranial nonmetric traits (Lozada Cerna 1998; Tomczak 2003). Previously published raw C14 dates for these sites are cali­brated using OxCal 4. 1 and the ShCal04 calibra­tion curve (Bronk Ramsey 2009; McCormac et al. 2004; Table 1 ). Radiocarbon date probability dis­tributions produced by OxCal 4. 1 are represented in Figure 2. 
San Geronimo is approximately 200 m from the coastline and contains components dating from the Formative to colonial periods (Lozada Cerna 1998). In contrast to the other sites discussed below, all of which have formally bounded cemeteries, the human skeletal remains at San Geronimo were recovered from midden contexts. Grave goods at San Geronimo were rich and consisted primarily of items related to the extraction of marine resources including harpoons, fishhooks, and miniature wood boats (Buikstra 1995). Coupled with the archaeological data, paleodietary recon­struction (Tomczak 2003) indicates that the indi­viduals at the San Geronimo site were pescadores. Of the individuals interred at San Geronimo, 67 per­cent had crania modified in the style that Lozada Cerna (1998) designates "annular." Given that no other modification styles were found at San Gero-

nimo, and that annular modification is all but absent 
in the inland sample of El Yaral, Lozada Cerna 
(1998) associates this style of modification with the 
pescador ethnic identity. Although occupation of the four Chiribaya sites examined here was roughly contemporaneous, radiocarbon dates suggest that occupation of San Geronimo began slightly later than that at El Yaral and Chiribaya Alta (see Table 1, Figure 2; Lozada Cerna and Buikstra 2005). Chiribaya Alta is located about 5 km from the 
coast on a ridge about 100 m above the Osmore River Valley. At this site, the mortuary component greatly overshadows the domestic, whereas the reverse applies at the other sites included in this analysis (Lozada Cerna 1998; Lozada Cerna and Buikstra 2002). Nine distinct cemeteries were exca­vated at Chiribaya Alta. The earliest calibrated radiocarbon dates (approximately A.D. 750-850) at Chiribaya Alta come from Cemeteries 3 and 7.

whereas Cemeteries 6 and 8 date to A.D. I050-1 150 (Lozada Cerna and Buikstra 2002; Table I, Figure 2). In addition to these temporal distinctions, the use of separate cemeteries at ChiribayaAlta seems to be another marker of social difference. For example, Cemetery 4, which yielded the richest, most elaborate grave yet recov­ered from a Chiribaya context, may have served as the burial site of elites identifying with the pescador ethnic group, given that 50 percent of the individ­uals interred here exhibit the annular style of cra­nial modification and ceramic grave goods are of the Chiribaya-San Geronimo style (Lozada Cerna 1998). In contrast, Lozada Cerna (1998) tentatively classifies Cemetery 7 at Chiribaya Alta as an elite lab radar cemetery, citing its spatial centrality, rich textiles and grave offerings, and the high percent­age of individuals (7 4 percent) with fronto-occipital modified crania. It is noteworthy, however, that dietary data suggest that individuals interred in Cemetery 7 consumed large amounts of marine resources (Tomczak 2003), perhaps suggesting that their elite status gave them privileged access to resources from all ecological niches under the con­trol of the Chiribaya polity. Given the complexity of internal variability in terms of cranial modifica­tion styles (Lozada Cerna 1998), diet (Knudson et al. 2007; Tomczak 2003), and mortuary behavior,

the role and function of Chiribaya Alta remain unclear, but most researchers infer a combined cer­emonial/ political function (Jessup 1990; Knudson and Buikstra 2007:576; Lozada Cerna and Buik­stra 2002). 
Chiribaya Baja is approximately 8 km from the coast. The site contains 13 terrace levels from which remnants of wood and cane residential architecture were recovered (Rice 1993). Chiribaya Baja occu­pied the widest point of the valley, and both archae­ological (Jessup 1990, 1991) and isotopic analyses (Tomczak 2003) indicate a concentration on agri­cultural production. In a study of cranial modifi­cation at this site, CM determined that the incidence of cranial modification is comparatively low and that among those exhibiting cranial modification, the fronto-occipital modification style heavily pre­dominates (9 1 percent of modified crania). These findings further support the supposition that the site is associated with agricultural production and the Labrador ethnic identity. 
El Yara) is approximately 50 km from the coast (Rice 1993). The site sits at the junction between the Moquegua and Ilo valleys of the Osmore drainage, where the river disappears into a subter­ranean channel. Calibrated radiocarbon dates (Table 1, Figure 2) indicate that occupation was contemporaneous with the other Chiribaya sites. Dietary reconstruction indicates a focus on terres­trial agricultural products, though marine resources still played a role in subsistence (Knudson et al. 2007; Tomczak 2003). Two cemeteries were iden­tified (Buikstra 1995) with relatively impoverished grave good assemblages compared with the Ilo Val­ley Chiribaya sites (Buikstra et al. 2005). Also note­worthy is the visually more subtle fronto-occipital style of deformation that predominated at El Yaral paired with comparatively low incidence of cranial modification in general. The burials at El Yaral are also distinct in that tombs are primarily circular or ovoid in contrast to the rectangular form that dom­inates in the lower valley (Buikstra 1995). Fur­thermore, the cemeteries as El Yara) are the only known Chiribaya sites to yield burials associated with the Ilo-Tumilaca/Cabuza style (Lozada Cerna 1998; Owen 1993). The presence of collared tombs, as well as its inland location, has raised specula­tion about greater cultural linkage or interaction with highland migrants in the middle valley. 
The site of El Algodonal sits in the Middle 
Osmore Valley, 12 km from the Pacific coast. Beginning in 1989, Owen ( 1993) uncovered domestic units, terraces, and plazas, as well as a mortuary area; he proposed that the site had been occupied in the early Ceramic period, abandoned during the Middle Horizon, and resettled by mid­dle valley immigrants during the late Intermediate period. Radiocarbon dates from the mortuary com­ponent place occupation of the site between A.D. 950 and 1250 (Owen 1993:444 ). 
In terms of material culture, Owen character­izes the site as Ilo-Tumilaca/Cabuza on the bases , of ceramics, textiles, and tomb form, although he 
· 
acknowledges the presence of Chiribaya material culture at the site as well. Economically, Owen argues that the late Intermediate period occupants of El Algodonal were able to employ irrigation canals abandoned after the collapse of Tiwanaku to facilitate intensive agricultural production at the site. The relationship between the Chiribaya and Tumilaca people is unclear. Owen interprets aspects of material culture and site characteristics (e.g., the defensible nature of Tumilaca sites later in the archaeological sequence) as reflecting an adver­sarial relationship between the two, with Chirib­aya expanding at the expense of Tumilaca. However, Chiribaya radiocarbon dates, evidence of shared cranial modification styles, and model-free biological distances that suggest the presence of gene flow between Chiribaya and Tumilaca chal­lenge this interpretation (Lozada Cerna 1998 ). 
Methods 
Metric data were collected on 32 craniofacial and mandibular traits (Table 2) in accordance with the standards articulated by Buikstra and Ubelaker (1994 ). As all of the data were collected by CM, there is no interobserver error. In order to test for intra-observer error, CM randomly remeasured 30 percent of the crania three weeks after the initial phase of data collection. The calculated mean per­centage error was 1.42 percent. 
Age and sex estimates were based upon mor­phological characteristics of the cranium and pelvis when available (Buikstra and Ube laker 1994 ). Because we were interested in sex-specific differ­ences in phenotypic variability, only those adult individuals with sex estimates of "female" and "male" were included, eliminating all individuals

with "probable," "unknown;' or "indeterminant" sex. Next, those individuals missing greater than 50 percent of craniomandibular values were elim­inated, followed by the elimination of any variable missing greater than 50 percent of values across individuals. The final sex-specific sample sizes are reported in Table 3. 
Missing data are a common problem when deal­ing with archaeological skeletal samples, and in order to bolster sample size in this research, miss­ing data values were imputed using the expectation­maximization (EM) algorithm in SYSTAT 12.0. Contrary to some methods, multiple regression imputation via an EM algorithm provides an unbi­ased estimate that does not affect levels of between­group variation (Droessler 1981 ). 
Following missing value imputation, all 32 vari­ables were run through a discriminant function analysis in SAS 9.1. Six variables were selected as being significant for differentiating between the sexes Cx = .05): bizygomatic diameter, maximum ramus height, foramen magnum length, bicondy­lar breadth, chin height, basion-prosthion length. 
However, the male sample size from Cemetery 7 at Chiribaya Alta (n = 5) constrained the number of variables to four (n -I). Consequently, the first four variables selected by the discriminant function analysis were utilized in subsequent analyses (bizy­gomatic diameter, maximum ramus height, fora­men magnum length, bicondylar breadth). 
To estimate multivariate variance, determinant ratios were calculated (Konigsberg I988; Schillaci and Stojanowski 2003; Stefan 1999; Stojanowski 2003). The determinant is a property of a vari­ance/covariance matrix and is a measure of inter­nal variability. The ratio of two determinants therefore characterizes the differences in multi­variate variance between two sets or groups. Deter­minant ratios (ldet01/ldet11 I) were calculated in SAS 
9.1 using the four variables selected by discrimi­nant function analysis. When the ratio is I there is equal variance between the sexes. A ratio greater than I indicates that males were more variable, whereas a ratio less than 1 indicates that females were more variable (Stefan 1999). Statistical sig­nificance was determined by comparing the observed value to a randomized distribution of determinant ratio values based upon resampling (500 iterations) of the original data set. 
Between-group, bias-corrected minimum bio­logical distances (heritability = .55, equal popula­tion weights) were calculated for each sex from the minimum genetic relationship (R) matrix (Releth­ford and Blangero 1990; Relethford et al. 1997) using the RMET 5.0 software provided by Dr. John Relethford (http://konig.la.utk.edu/relethsoft.html). The more mobile sex is expected to exhibit a closer between-group minimum genetic distance due to immigration from common source populations, whereas the nonmobile sex is expected to exhibit greater between-group distances due to the lack of between-group migration (Schillaci and Sto­janowski, 2003:8-9).

agreement was high, in those instances where there were discrepancies, CM performed additional assessments. In cases where the discrepancy could not be reconciled, the age or sex of the individual was listed as "undetermined." Given that in this research such individuals were eliminated from the analyses, any interobserver error would not have resulted in the inappropriate inclusion of individ­uals with indeterminate or unknown sex. 
Sample Size 
While skeletal preservation on the south coast of Peru is generally exceptional, several concerns regarding sample size arose in this research. First, sample sizes were necessarily reduced when some individuals were eliminated because their sex could not be reliably determined. Other individuals were eliminated because they were missing data for greater than 50 percent of the entire suite of cran­iomandibular traits. The negative impact of preser­vation and missing data was ameliorated through the imputation of missing values. Finally, the nature of our investigation meant that we were not able to 
include material from several ChiribayaAlta ceme­teries (2, 5, 6, 8, and 9 [see Table 3]) due to small sex-specific sample sizes as this would lead to a situation where there were more variables than observations for a particular sex (Stojanowski and Schillaci 2006). CM recorded metric data on a total of 181 adult individuals. Following data manipu­lation (e.g., elimination of those individuals with indeterminate sex), 162 (or 89 percent of the orig­inal adult sample) remained for analysis. Cemetery­and sex-specific sample sizes are reported in Table 3, and the age and sex distribution of the final sam­ple is reported in Table 4. 
Artificial Cranial Modification and Metric Variability 
Artificial cranial modification was a common prac­tice among the Chiribaya. In her examination of 255 crania from El Yaral, Chiribaya Alta (Cemeteries 1-7), San Geronimo, andAlgodonal, Lozada Cerna ( 1998) found that 40 percent were not intentionally modified, 20 percent were annularly modified, and 40 percent were variants of fronto-occipital modi-

fication. These pooled-sample percentages, how­ever, obscure a great deal of intra-cemetery varia­tion, as well as the fact that unmodified crania account for greater than 50 percent of the observed crania at five of these cemeteries (Yaral Cemetery I, Chiribaya Alta [ChA] Cemeteries 1, 2, 3, and 6). 

· 
Modified crania are found in high frequencies (>50 percent) in only three cemeteries: ChA Cemetery 4 (67 percent modified) and 7 (96 percent modified) and San Geronimo (67 percent modified). Of the individuals included in the current research, 55.6 percent exhibited some form of artificial modifi­cation (17.9 percent annular, 37.7 percent fronto­occipital), while 41.3 percent were unmodified (or 
3.1 percent of the final sample [n 5] could not

Given the preponderance of individuals with artificially modified crania in our samples, it is important to consider the impact this cultural prac­tice may have on craniometric variance. The avail­able literature on the impact of artificial cranial modification on metric traits is equivocal. Cocilovo (1975) reports that there were no significant dif­ferences with regard to facial dimensions and main­tains that cranial modification has no effect at all on the face. Anton (1989) found that nasal region measurements (nasal aperture breadth and nasal height) were stable across modification style. Cheverud et al. (1992), however, report general anterior-posterior reduction in facial dimensions, particularly in the maxillary alveolus and nasal
