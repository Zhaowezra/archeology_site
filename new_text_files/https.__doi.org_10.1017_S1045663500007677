STINGRAY SPINE USE AND MAYA BLOODLETTING RITUALS: 
A CAUTIONARY TALE 

Helen R. Haines, Philip W. Willink, and David Maxwell 
Stingray spine use in Maya human bloodletting rituals has long been an accepted phenomenon. Recent work has suggested that intact spines may have been used and that the symptoms resulting from envenomation were an important part of the bloodletting ritual. Zoological and medical research, however, indicate that stingray toxins pose a more serious threat to human health than mere pain and inflammation. Medical studies conducted to track injuries resulting from stingray attacks report that some two-thirds of all cases result in tissue necrosis. Reconciling the use of stingray spines by the Maya with the physiological effects they present is crucial if we are to understand how the Maya viewed toxic marine materials and why they incorporated them in their ritual behaviors. Correlations between political events and stingray spine use may hold the key for understanding how these objects were articulated into the larger social and political sphere. We provide a dis­cussion of the effects of stingray envenomation and the health risks inherent to the ritual use of stingray spines as blood­letters among the ancient Maya. Finally, we offer some possible explanations for the role of cleaned and defleshed spines in ritual contexts.

(Stross and Kerr 1990). The Postclassic Maya underwent days of fasting, abstinence, and long steam baths prior to participation in ceremonies (Landa 1978 [1566)). Maxwell (2000) has sug­gested that pain and localized poisoning resulting from the use of toxic marine materials might also have been used to induce visions (also see Furst 1976; Schele and Miller 1986:177; Weil 1972). 
Many mortuary collections, caches, and other ritual deposits from the Central Peten, Coastal Belize, and other Maya regions contained toxic marine materials (Maxwell 1996), including stingray spines, porcupine fish remains, cone shells, and sea urchins, as well as a variety of sponges and corals (Coe 1959; Garcia Moll 2004; Maxwell 1996, 2000; Pendergast 1969; Willey 1972), all of which are capable of causing severe pain when alive. Stingray spines, however, are the most com­monly reported of these marine materials, and have been recovered from numerous burials and caches (Borhegyi 1961:283-284; D. Chase 1991; Coe 1959; Fitzsimmons et al. 2003; Garcia Moll 2004; Healy 1992; Maxwell 1994, 1996, 2000; Miller and Taube 1993:46; Pendergast 1969; Schele and Miller 1986; Welsh 1988; Willey 1972) (Figure 1). Based on their appearance in autosacrifice imagery recorded on polychrome vessels (Thompson 1961) and monuments (Graham 1977; Tate 1992) these spines are widely accepted as having been used in bloodletting rituals (Benson 1988: 176; Boihegyi 1961 :283-284; A Chase 1991; Fitzsimmons et al. 2003; Freidel et al. 1993; Schele and Miller 1986; Willey 1972). 
Maxwell originally postulated that the pain resulting from the toxin present in fresh or relatively fresh stings was an important part of Maya rituals and may have played a part in Maya ritual blood­letting (2000:92). Currently, the poison from only a few stingray species has been studied and addi­tional research is needed into the properties of these toxins to understand the full effects of envenoma­tion. One serious side-effect, in addition to the pain­inducing nature of stingray venom, was found in common with all stingrays, yet it is absent from much of the standard literature; it is the likely infec­tion of the wound with minute particles of the tis­sue that encases the spine that may result in necrosis (Auerbach 1991; Barss 1984; Fenner et al. 1989; Germain et al 2000; Haddad Jr. et al. 2004; Perkins and Morgan 2004). The potential of wound mor­bidity has been overlooked in discussions of stingray spine use and may play an important role in furthering our understanding of how the ancient Maya perceived these animals. 
In this paper we discuss the physiology of stingrays as this relates to human injuries, and the physiological effects of stingray venom. We draw upon zoological studies of stingrays and medical studies of envenomation by stingray spines, includ­ing brief discussions of several documented cases. The aim is to clarify the nature of stingray toxins and their potential effects and to discuss the impor­tance of stingray spines in Maya ritual activities in light of these potential dangers. 
Stingray Physiology and Envenomation 
Stingrays are common in tropical and temperate waters throughout the world. Most species are found in either salt or brackish waters, although a few species have adapted to fresh water (McEachran and Fechhelm 1998: 172). Four fam­ilies of rays with stings (Rhinopteridae, Mylio­batidae, Urolophidae, and Dasyatidae) are found in the coastal waters off the Yucatan Peninsula (Greenfield and Thomerson 1997; McEachran and Fechhelm 1998; Schmitter-Soto 1998 Smith 1997; Stehmann 1978), although only a single species of each of the first three families has been documented in Maya waters (Rhinoptera bonasus, Aetobatus narinari, and Urobatis jamaicensis). Members of the family Dasyatidae are more common, with four species documented in the Maya area (Dasyatis americana, D. latus, D. sabina, and Himantura schmarde). Dasyatidae are found along the Gulf and Atlantic coasts of North and Central America, favoring shallow bays, sandy lagoons or river mouths, and open patches of sand between coral reefs (Halstead 1988). 
It is likely, based on their more frequent pres­ence, that the majority of stings used by the Maya came from members of the family Dasyatidae (Fig­ure 2). This is only a statistical assumption, how­ever, for while it is possible to identify stingray spines to family and even genus (Halstead 1988), this is rarely the case in archaeological fauna! reports. The stings of the Dasyatidae rays, like most rays, are located in the basal or proximal third of the caudal appendage, and in some species stings can reach almost 40 cm in length (Figure 3). These

integumentary tissues (Auerbach 1991; Halstead 1988). Envenomation occurs during the process of penetrating or lacerating the victim's tissue; the integumentary sheath of the sting is ruptured caus­ing venom to be introduced into the wound (Auer­bach 199l;Barss l984;Bumettetal.1986;Fenner et al. 1989; Halstead 1988). Damage to the sheath also exposes the serrated margins of the spine that, when coupled with the whip-like effect of the tail, exacerbates the injury thereby increasing the dis­tribution and absorption of the toxins (Halstead 
1988).Laceration of the tissue by the dentate mar­gins also can introduce mucus and pieces of the spine and sheath into the wound, further increas­ing the severity and toxicity of the attack (Auer­bach 1991; Halstead 1988). 
Intense pain is the most common symptom reported after a stingray attack. Initially localized around the point of contact, over the course of the first hour pain can spread to encompass the entire limb (Auerbach 1991; Burk and Richter 1990; Bur­nett et al. 1986; Halstead 1988:748-751; Maxwell 2000; Russel et al. 1958); primary shock can occur as a result of the intensity of the pain. Although the pain may reach maximum intensity in the first 90 minutes, it can last from six to 48 hours after the envenomation occurs. In the first few minutes after an attack, nausea, faintness, vertigo, and brady­cardia (abnormally slow heart action) have been reported (Auerbach 1991; Burk and Richter 1990; Burnett et al. 1986; Halstead 1988:748-751; Maxwell 2000; Russel et al. 1958); however, these are likely associated with shock resulting from the pain rather than a direct effect of the toxin (Hal­stead 1988:748-751). Additional symptoms may include a drop in blood pressure, cardiac arryth­rnias, diarrhea, sweating, tremors, muscle spasms, muscular paralysis, edema in the soft tissue, and varying amounts of bleeding (Auerbach 1991; Burk and Richter 1990; Halstead 1988:748-751; Maxwell 2000; Russel et al. 1958). Initially the wound will have an ashy appearance before becom­ing cyanotic (blue) and then eventually turning red (Auerbach 1991; Burk and Richter 1990; Burnett et al. 1986; Halstead 1988:748-751; Maxwell 2000; Russel et al. 1958). 
Stingray venom is proteolytic (containing enzymes that break down proteins and peptides akin to the process of digestion), and contains at least I 0 amino acids and toxic factions, with some of the more toxic components being serotonin, 5'-nucleoti­dase, and phosphodiesterase (Auerbach 1991; Bur­nett et al. 1986). Although stingray venom is known to contain numerous different chemical compo­nents, many of these elements have yet to be clearly characterized (Germain 2000: 1074). 
Stings with intact integumentary sheaths are more toxic (Russel et al. 1958); however, damaged stings can still be venomous even if the spine appears bare (Auerbach 1991; Halstead 1988; Rus­sel et al. 1958). In a study of 180 damaged stings, the majority of spines retained sufficient epidermis in the ventro-lateral glandular grooves to make the stings toxic (Halstead 1988:720-722). Studies have found that while the toxins in the spines may remain
