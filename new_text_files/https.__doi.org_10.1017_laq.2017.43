Excavations conductedin2015and2016discoveredauniquesetoffriezesattheInitialperiod(2100–1000calBC)siteof Taukachi-Konkánin thecoastalPeruvianvalleyofCasma.Atthis time, theCasmaValley was dominatedby theSechínAlto polity,a culturaldevelopmentofunprecedented complexitycharacterizedby largeplanned cities,monumentalconstructions, and strong interconnections among component settlements.Friezes areknownfromall majorSechínAlto polity sites where theytypically adornstructure facades; however,theTaukachi-Konkán friezes are unusual becausetheycover allfour interior walls of a sunken court with restricted access. Based on analysis of the context and content of these friezes, we suggest that thecollective imagery depicts aspectsof Sechín Alto polity cosmology, including possible iconographyrelatingtotheir creationmyth.Furthermore,motifsfromtheTaukachi-Konkán sunken courtcanbe foundat contemporarysites bothwithin and outside theCasmaValley. This suggeststhat theworldviewwereconstructed may havebeen widespread duringthe Initial period.

Pozorski 1987:51–70, 86–103).TheInitial period(2100–1000 cal BC) was an especially dynamic time characterized by the construction of carefully planned cities dominated by large platform mounds that established site axes and orientations for most of the larger structures at each site (S. Pozorski and T. Pozorski 1989, 1994a, 1994b, 1998).We used datafromthese threelarge sitesplusover halfa dozen smaller sites to de.ne the Sechín Alto polity based on shared architectural forms, orientation, and artifacts(S. Pozorski andT. Pozorski 2011a;T. PozorskiandS. Pozorski 2005,2012).Withinthe northern, SechínbranchoftheCasmaValley,we grouped four contemporarysitesintothe Sechín Alto Complexbased on proximity and consistent

Previous Fieldwork at Taukachi-Konkán 

Taukachi-Konkán, thesecond-largestsite within the SechínAlto Complex, liesslightly northwest of the Sechín Alto site on an expanse of plain bordered by Cerro Taukachi on the west and Cerro Konkán on the east. Based on early site surveysofthe area, clustersof platform mounds and associated plazas on either edge of the plainwereinitially treated as twoseparatesites (Thompson 1961:211–217). Subsequent exami­nation of air photographs and surface evidence revealed connected and associated architectural features forming a single large site that spans the pampa (Fung and Williams 1977:116–118) and occupies an area of about 1,250 by 500 m (Figure2;S. Pozorski andT. Pozorski1987:75). The principal platform mound of Taukachi-Konkán lies near Cerro Taukachi on the west wherethe sloping cerro base enhances its height. Associated intermediate-sized structures lie near this main mound and extend out in rows along theedgesofthesite.Atthefareasternendofthe pampa is an un.nished platform mound near a group of joined mounds. Along the north edge of thesite and near its east end,agroupof four mounds stands out becausethree membersofthe group are not oriented toward the central site axis, probably because they once faced a road (Figure2a–d).Taukachi-Konkán was seriously impacted by a Late Intermediate period (AD 1000–1470) Casma-culture occupation of the same pampa. The construction of late walls, roads, and compounds greatly alteredthe con.g­uration of numerous Initial period buildings at

thesite,which also suffered becausetheirfacing stones were robbed for reuse in later construc­tions (S. Pozorski and T. Pozorski 1987:77; S. Pozorski andT. Pozorski 2012). 
We .rst excavated at Taukachi-Konkán for three .eld seasons in 1992–1994, concentrat­ing on the western part of the site, especially theprincipal mound and surrounding structures. We exposed much of the surface of the main mound, nowknown as theMoundoftheColumns (Figure2e) becausethe front halfofthe mound probably hadaroof supportedbyover100 round columns. We argued that the structure served as a palace or royal residence for Sechín Alto polity nobility basedonthepresenceof audience areas and high-status storage areas as well as a less accessible asymmetrical area at the rear of themound that hadaresidentialfunction(T. Pozorski and S. Pozorski 1997, 2000, 2012). These datafromTaukachi-Konkán were critical to our argumentsthat thestrength and cohesion of the SechínAlto polity depended on interrela­tionships among sites containing largeplatform mounds with varied and complementary func­tions (S. Pozorski andT. Pozorski 2008). 
Ceramic collections found associated with the Moundof theColumns are dominatedby neck-less ollas decorated with large punctations along the shoulders of these vessels. These ceramics areessentially identical to thosefound at other Sechín Alto polity sites such as Pampa de las Llamas-Moxeke (S. Pozorski and T. Pozorski 1987:38–39) and Sechín Alto (T. Pozorski and 
S. Pozorski 2005:147). Nine radiocarbon dates

Recent Excavations at Taukachi-Konkán 

We returned to the site of Taukachi-Konkán in 2015 to further explore the eastern zone of the site where we had opened only one excavation in 1993. Muchofthesite remainstobeexplored through excavation, and there is an urgency to this .eldwork becauseofincreasingly aggressive effortsto cultivateTaukachi-Konkán despite its clearly proclaimedstatusasaprotected archaeo­logical zone.Wejust completed our 2016 season, and the plain north of the central site, which contained middens and remains of residential structures, is now under cultivation by means of a small underground pipeline connected to a well pump. Furthermore, the projected path of an intervalleycanal to bring water from a larger riverfarther north cutsTaukachi-Konkánin half. 
We began our 2015 excavations by testing sixlarge-to intermediate-sized platform mounds and selecting three of the four well-preserved structuresalongthe northedgeofthesiteforfur­ther clearing.Thetallestand most southernofthe four structures(Figure2d) had remainsofround columnsandaspecial modular roomatits center that wehave de.ned asasquare-room unit(S. Pozorski andT. Pozorski 2011b). Square-room– unit architecture has been excavated at all major Sechín Alto polity sites where it consistently occurs in prominent, often central, locations. We have argued that this room form, with its roundedexterior corners, roundor squareinterior corners, highwall niches,raisedthresholds, and entrances restrictedbypilasters andwooden bar­closuremechanismsisakey architectural form emblematicof SechínAlto polity administration. Associated ceramics from this tall mound are similar to examples recovered from the Mound of the Columns, and three radiocarbon dates on wood from pilasters within this room date the structure between 1500 and 1400 cal BC (Table1). Thethird structurefrom the south in the sequence(Figure2b) also has a square-room unit at its center, further illustrating the connection between the eastern platform mounds and the western part of Taukachi-Konkán and

with the SechínAlto polity in general.In 2016, we excavated the summit of the most northern aligned structure(Figure2a) where wefound a third square-room–unit type room that was unusual becauseit contained tworowsof small rectangular columns,a columnshape more typi­cal of later sites. 
The last structure we tested in 2015 was the second building from the south in the row of aligned structures(Figure2c).In contrast to the form of the other three, which consist of relatively tall platform mounds capped by square-room units,the second structure consists ofalower,morerectangular mound with clear wings that project toward the east and form the northand southwallsofasunken courtinfront of the mound(Figure3). This mound and its wings form a U shape, a con.guration that is commonlyseenin intermediate-sized moundsat many CasmaValleyInitial periodsites, as well asatlargeInitialperiodmound sitesonthe north and central coasts. 
We started excavating along the north wall of the sunken court where the wing wall was relatively clear, and almost immediately we found remains of a large frieze. We contin­ued excavating this sunken structure in 2016 and were able to clarify architectural details of the sunken court and clear more friezes on thewest, south, and east walls(Figure4).We also discovered that the sunken court measures 
17.75 m north-south by 19.5 m east-west and has two entrances. A narrow staircase near the northwest cornerofthe courtascends 1.75mto the mound summit near its north end. This access pattern is very different from the wide, centralstaircases that typically provide accessto SechínAlto polity platform mounds bothlarge and small. A second, wider staircase, located in the center of the east wall, ascends some 
1.25 cm out of the sunken court on to an open, .at plaza.Alow bench,18cm tall,extends out 4 m from all four interior walls of the sunken court. The court is oriented E21oN, an orien­tation signi.cantly different from the general Taukachi-Konkán site orientationofE32oN. This difference in orientation may re.ect deliberate alignment withatopographical featureor celes­tial phenomenon or body that was connected with rituals that took place within the sunken court. 
No radiocarbon dates are available for the sunken court or its associated mound; never­theless, artifactsfound within thesunken court coincide with artifact inventories from other Initial period sites within the Casma Valley. As is typically the case for large Initial period formal architecture(Burger and Salazar-Burger

Taukachi-Konkán Friezes 

The.rstfrieze weexcavatedisonthe north side of thesunken courtwherethe courtwallisatits tallest due to protectionbydeep sandy deposits. The plastered wall surface bearing the frieze is preserved to a maximum height of 1.46 m above the .oor, and consequently this frieze is morethan three-quarters complete.Thedegreeof surface weatheringindicates that allthe friezes remained exposed long enough to erode away any trace of color, leaving only white, which may have been a base coat. Better preserved friezes and frieze fragments within Casma and nearbyvalleysare polychrome,andtheexamples from Taukachi-Konkán were likely also once brightly colored. Despite the lack of preserved color, the frieze content is clear: two large sea lions arefacing each other(Figure5). Each is

A much smaller, but very similar, depiction of a sea lion was recorded as part of a painted friezeonawall believedto pertainto oneofthe earliest construction phasesatthesiteof Punkurí in theNepeñaValley north of Casma. Its color was described as “bottle green” or “darkgreen” (Museo de Arqueologíay Antropologíade San Marcos 2005a:104). The sea lion there forms part of a composition believed to represent a being lying on its side accompanied by animals, includingamonkeyandapossible opossum.

the square-room–unit architectural form and the administrative authority behind it within polity iconography (Pozorski and Pozorski 2011b). This “power symbol” is also present at Cerro Sechín in the Sechín Alto Complex, where it occurs on the clubs or staffs of most warrior .gures (Samaniegoand Cardenas 1995:Fichas4, 39, 76, 87, 111, 124, 137, 150, 163, 175, 196, 261, 279, 293, and 303; Tello 1956:146–228) and at SechínBajointhe SechínAlto Complex, where it forms part of Initial period graf.ti (Fuchs and Patzschke 2015:Figure 46; Fuchs et al. 2006:Figure 13).Astone mortar fragment fromtheCasmaValleyexhibitsadesign(Bischof 2008:Figure4.20c; León 1995:Figures2and4; Pozorski and Pozorski 2016:Figure 5.11) that pairsapower symbol with one-halfofaface that shares traits with Cerro Sechín warrior images (Samaniegoand Cardenas 1995:Fichas4,13,25, 39,47 56, 67, 76, 87, 99, 111, 124, 137, 150, 163, 175, 196, 213, 234, and 261) and with one of thefaces adorning theMoxekemound(Tello 1956:Figure 31). 
The frieze surface on the western wall is preserved to a maximum height of 1.34 m. This frieze surface is centrally placed on the western wall. The only entrance leading up to the mound is located north of the frieze near the northwest cornerofthesunken court.The central portion was damaged by modern tree roots; however, enough remains to suggest a tentative reconstruction. In the center, part of a mouth withfangsis preserved, suggestingacentralface, probablyafeline(Figure6).Wewere puzzledby thefrieze fragmentsoneithersideoftheface until Rosa MarínJavesuggestedtheyrepresent raised paws. While there are many creatures in early Andean iconography that may be represented withfangs and clawed feet (e.g., birds, felines, bats,hybrid beings), we were abletouse known early iconography, especially in theCasma and Nepeña valleys, to more fully interpret and reconstruct the frieze content.Thefanged mouth is typicalof felines,most notablythe full-round felinesculptureatPunkuríinthe NepeñaValley (Bischof 2015:Figure81; MuseodeArqueología y Antropología de San Marcos 1005a:86–87; Samaniego 2011),andisalsoseeninslightlylater Early Horizon iconography (Fux 2015:Figure 12).The three-toedpawwithan opposabledigit, a key element in our iconographic reconstruc­tion, replicates paws depicted on the painted feline located on the innermost Cerro Sechín structure(Fuchs andPatzschke 2015:Figure 47; Samaniego 1995:Figure1;Tello 1956:251–252), onafeline-likestone sculpture fromMesapatac in the upper CasmaValley(Bischof 2015:Figure 86; Suárez Ubillus 2010), and onastone carving from Chavín de Huantar (Bischof 2015:Figure 98b).Based on these comparisons,wefeel con­.dent about our reconstructionofthe west frieze as the upper bodyofafelinewith raisedpaws,a stance depictedin the Punkurífelinesculpture. 
Recognition of the feline theme of the west frieze enabledusto reconstructpartofthesubject matterof the eastfrieze(Figure7). Thefrieze segments there are preserved to a maximum height of 74 cm, and they are separated by the central staircase that rises up out of the sunken court. On either side of the staircase, remnantsofprobablepawsare present,and based on similarities with the west frieze and early iconography, we believe theserepresent thehind limbs of the feline depicted on the west wall. Other partsofthe east frieze are puzzling because thereisaclear depictionofahuman foot near the left paw. This foot is modeled in detail, including evidenceofthebigtoenail,andthis detailandthe arrangementof thetoes makesit similartofeet excavatedbyTelloat CerroBlancointhe 1930s (Museo de Arqueologíay Antropologíade San Marcos 2005b:149–150). 
Thefrieze on thesouthwallispreserved to a maximum height of 86 cm, and it is clear that this frieze(Figure8)isverydifferent from the sea lions on the opposing north wall. The north and southfriezesdo sharesimilarities,however, because the designs depicted on the south are similarinsize and spacing; they arealsomirror images of each other, like the sea lions.

Comparisons and Conclusions 

Our attempt to interpret the content of the friezes must be speculative because there are so few examples of Initial period iconography and because much of the portable art lacks reliable context. Furthermore, these friezes are over3,000 yearsold,making connections with later cultures and ethnohistorical sources tenuous at best. Despite these limitations,webelieve that by considering boththe context and the content of the friezes, we can gain insights into Initial period cosmology. 
The sunken court at Taukachi-Konkán with friezesonallfour interiorwallsisboth consistent with thetenetsofpolity architecture and unique within the Sechín Alto polity and within the body of known Initial period iconography. Its near-squareformwith rounded corners and the presence of a wide bench are traits common to square-room units, and both entrances are nar­rowedbypilasters, alsoa common SechínAlto polity trait. Despite this consistency, there are signi.cant differences that make this sunken court special. Clearly, the sunken court was plannedand constructedinamannerthatbestdis­plays the friezes andgivesthem added meaning through their context.

It was constructed well to the side so that the frieze of the face and paws of the feline, the principal .gure, couldbecenteredonthefrontof this mound.Even thoughtheyaredistinct friezes, the pairedmirrorimages on the north and south walls form a symmetrical complement to feline frieze components that are at the west and east ends of the court. The contrasting locations of thewest entranceinthe northwest cornerandthe east entrance, whichis centeredin the eastwall, clearly indicates that the centered east entrance was for arriving visitors while the northwest entrance allowed hosts and/or religious prac­titioners access to the sunken court from the mound at its west end. 
It is also signi.cant that the court is rel­atively small and sunken over a meter below the surrounding ground surface and even deeper below the summits of the wings and principal mound. This suggests that the court and its friezes were accessibletorelativelyfewindividualswho enteredthe courtbydescendingtoalowerlevel. Such restricted accessibilityisin marked contrast to thesituationat other SechínAlto polity sites with friezes.Moxeke,oneofthetwolargestplat­form moundsatPampadelas Llamas-Moxeke,is believedtohaveservedasareligious structureor temple (Pozorski and Pozorski 1997). At Mox­eke, immense, full-.gure beings that once stood at least4 mtall and huge headsover2 mwide .llniches on thefront and rounded cornersofthe mound(Tello 1956:60–64, LáminasIVGandV). Thesefriezes were positioned some15mabove the local ground surface, making them readily visible, and the large open plazas immediately in frontofMoxeke couldhaveheldan audience of thousands.Additional friezes coverthe back walls of the north and south atria of Huaca A(Pozorski and Pozorski 1986, 1993, 2011b; 
T. Pozorski and S. Pozorski 1994), the other largeplatformmound atPampadelas Llamas-Moxeke, which we have interpreted as a large storage structure(Burger 1992:83; Pozorski and Pozorski 1997). We have argued that the north frieze representsapairofjaguarswhile thesouth frieze is too poorly preserved to interpret. The Huaca A friezes would have been less public because of their recessed location, but their position on the facade of the tallest part of the

mound probablymadethematleastpartly visible from the plazas to the north and south of the mound. Accesstothe summitsquare-room units of HuacaAwasseverely restrictedbyasystemof gates and wooden bar-closure mechanisms, and the atria decorated by the friezes are relatively small,soitislikelythatfewindividuals actually spenttimeinclose proximitytothe friezes. 
All component sitesofthe SechínAlto Com­plex also have evidence of friezes. At Cerro Sechín, a succession of superimposed, round-cornered structures with decoratedfacades forms the coreof the site.The innermost room hasa pairof painted felinesfacing each other across the entrance (Samaniego 1995;Samaniego etal. 1985; Tello 1956:251–252); the second struc­ture has friezes,including prominent .shmotifs (Samaniego 1995; Samaniego et al. 1985); and the outermost structure has the stone carvings of warriors and victims for which the site is especially well known (Samaniegoand Cardenas 1995; Tello 1956:146–228). At Sechín Bajo, anthropomorphic friezes described as religious .gures relatedtoritual activities adorn bothsides of the atrium associated with the main central roomof themound, whichisalsoa square-room unit(Fuchs et al. 2009). 
The SechínAlto site, capitalof the polityof the same name, contained the largest structure in the New World during Initial period times. Friezes were present on the summit of this immenseplatformmound that measures 250m by 300minarea and once stoodover35 m tall. Known friezes associated with the penultimate majorInitial period construction phase decorated rowsof columns that lined thelong edgesofa platform made of cone-shaped adobes that forms the center of the mound (Pozorski and Pozorski 2005, 2011a). Whenitwasinitially constructed, this platform was the tallest part of the mound, towering some9mabovethesurrounding mound summit. About 500 BC, the columns with friezes were almost totally destroyed, leaving onlysmall remnants at the north end of the platform. Enough remains, nevertheless, to determine that the columns were very closely spaced, had friezes on both interior and exterior surfaces, and had subject matter that varied from column to column. Given the height of the platform with columns,theexteriorfacesofthe columns were likelyvisible from theimmenseplazas that extend outovera kilometertothe eastinfront of themain SechínAlto site mound. Hundreds, even thousands,ofindividuals couldhaveviewed this imagery. In contrast, access to the interior of the sacred precinct formed by the colonnade was probably much more restricted, and this suggests that only a few special visitors were abletoviewthe friezes on the colonnade interior. We have hints about the subject matter of the friezes on theexteriorofthe columns becauseof nearby graf.ti. Immediatelytothe east and well below theraised conical adobe platform,Initial periodgraf.ti artists scratched images onalarge wall surfaceofaplatformthat supportedsquare­room–unit modules. All the depictions appear to be humans; two are faces and two are full .gures (Pozorski and Pozorski 2015).Assuming thegraf.ti artists were drawingwhat theysawon the columns, then humans or humanlike beings were partofthe frieze content. 
During thelastmajor Initial period construc­tion phase at the Sechín Alto site, a thick .ll layer was added to the top of the main mound, covering the zone of square-room–unit modules and bringingthelevelofmuchofits summitup even with thetop of the conical adobe platform. At this time, access to the sacred precinct and its columns was by way of a long, narrow, roofed corridor only 1.25 m wide. A large, rectangular,round-cornered room25by50min size was constructed on this new mound surface immediately eastofthe conical adobe core, and iteffectivelyblocked public viewof thesacred precinct from the east. Possibly as a planned replacement for the earlier imagery, the new summitroomhadalarge friezeonits eastexterior wall. This wall was 5 m thick at its base and originally stood an estimated 10 m tall, and the frieze on its surface could have measured up to 50 m long by 10 m tall. This frieze would also have been readily visible from the large plazas eastofthe main mound.Even lessof this laterfrieze survives becauseitwas stripped from the exterior wall surface, leaving a bare stone wallface that contrastsmarkedlywith theintact plasteronthe room interior.The onlyremnants of the frieze are in the wall fall where large fragments of shaped plaster with red, yellow, black,blue, blue-gray,green,andwhitepigments

con.rm the former existence of a polychrome frieze. Both the friezes of the colonnade and the frieze on the east room wall were destroyed during the Early Horizon when the summit of the SechínAlto site main moundwasreoccupied by people who built a small settlement on the mound surface.Facing stones were stripped from Initial periodfacades forreuseinnew structures, and the conical adobe platform was mined for silt-rich soil to make mortar and plasterfor new buildings.The Initial periodfriezeswouldhave begun to erode, but enough still remained to provoke desecration duringthe EarlyHorizon.It is likelythat boththe destructivereoccupationof this speci.c mound, capitalofthe former Sechín Alto polity, and the destruction oficonography that depicted the polity’s leadership, pantheon, and/or power symbols represented a deliberate effort to confront and dominate the legacy of the Sechín Alto polity because of considerable remnant animosity in the social memory of the local population(Pozorski and Pozorski 2011a). 
Taken as a whole, these Casma Valley data suggest that facades and atria decorated by friezes and other media had a more public function, and their content re.ects this. This is especially evident in the Moxeke friezes that probably depicted actual deities and/or divine rulers.Aparallel canbe seenattheInitial period platform-mound site of Huaca de los Reyes in the Moche Valley, where successively smaller plazas have increasingly complex iconography. Colossal heads comparabletothe Moxekeexam­ples line one edge of the outermost plaza and are accessible to the largest audience; more varied human .gures, possibly culture heroes, border the second plaza that was much smaller and less accessible, and possible full-round images were present within thesmallest and least acces­sible room on the mound summit (Pozorski 1980). 
When we look at the contextoftheTaukachi-Konkán friezes, we see a sunken court that is setwithinaU-shaped mound structure, between thetwowings that are believedbysomescholars to represent opposing yet complementaryforces within society and the cosmos(Burger 1992:62– 63).Ourexcavationsof thesunken court,how­ever, provide more information than is usually availablefor Initial period courts and plazas.This sunken court hasasmall .oor area and relatively narrowrestricted entrances,andthis suggeststhat accessintothe courtwas limited. Theimpact on visitorswouldhave been enhanced becausethey had to descend below the surrounding ground surface in order to enter, giving the visitor a sense of immersion in the world represented by the friezes. When we examine the content of theTaukachi-Konkán friezes,weseea com­plementary set of symbols that may represent aspectsofSechínAlto polity cosmology.Straight ahead of the entering visitor, on the mound front,isthe felineface borderedby raisedpaws, and the opposing hind feet on the east wall transform the sunken court into the body of the feline. This would give the visitor a sense of being enveloped by and possibly protected by the feline, a being grounded on the earth and with possible connections to the underworld (Beltrán 2013:5, 65),given thesunken aspectof the court. The .erce countenance of the feline image,however, with its raised claws andfangs, reveals an aspect that is not totally benevolent. In thisworldview,the sea lions on the northwall canbe interpretedasrepresentingthe ocean,and the possible bird imagery on south wall may represent the sky. Expanding on the idea that the sunken court described here represents the bodyof thefeline, we also suggestthat similar round-cornered rooms, especially square-room– unit architectural forms, might also symbolize thefeline and its power, despite the absence of felineimagery. 
Thefelineclearly dominatesthesunken court, suggesting it may be a major deity, possibly a creator deity.The positionofthe felineforelimb and hind limb friezes on opposing walls trans­forms the sunken court into a vessel, possibly symbolizing a womb that opens to the outside world via the east staircase that is centered between the hind limbs. In this scenario, the puzzling human foot element in the east frieze might depict part of a creation myth involving humans bornoffelines.Anaspectof laterMoche iconography might be related to this interpre­tation. The exterior walls of a small room on thesummitofHuacadela LunaintheMoche Valley has a frieze that has been interpreted as representing humans copulating with felines (Morales Gamarra 2003:461, Lámina 14.6a).

More broadly, felines, especially jaguars and pumas, are pervasive in Andean iconography and folk beliefs, indicatingtheirimportanceover centuries and across a wide area (Beltrán 2013; Gonzalez Eliçabe 2016;Steele and Allen2004). Much of the surviving folklore comes from the tropical forest,the native habitatofjaguars, and these data have been used to suggest coastal-tropical forest connections (Gonzalez Eliçabe 2016). Jaguars are also important as symbols of force and power and because their dominant position within the tropical forest ecosystem and their territoriality may have served as a model for human social organization and inter-settlement interaction(Gonzalez Eliçabe 2016). Within local communities, jaguars are tools of social control as potential punishers when tradi­tionalvalues and rulesare not respected (Beltrán 2013:70). Close associations among jaguars, shamans, and shamanicpractices connect jaguars to religion and ritual, and themonumental depic­tions within Sechín Alto polity iconography suggest that felines had attained the status of major deity. 
It is also possible to examine the context and function of the sunken court with friezes more generally within the site of Taukachi-Konkán and within the SechínAlto polity.The sunken court lies near the east end ofTaukachi-Konkán within a row of three intermediate-sized structures(Figure2a–c) with orientations perpendiculartothemainaxisofthe site.These structures were probably oriented toward a road that entered the site from the north. A gap in the aligned architecture about 50 m wide immediately east of the row of structures is the likely pathofthisroad within thesite(Figure2). AtPampadelas Llamas-Moxeke, structures with comparabledeviant orientations were also found tobe orientedtoward roads enteringthe site from the east and west (S. Pozorski and T. Pozorski 1994b).The deliberate positioningofthesunken courtalongamajor entry routeintothe siteof Taukachi-Konkán and theCasmaValleysuggests that it was accessible and important to an elite sectorof site visitors.Inthis capacity,itmayhave beenapilgrimage centeroracenterfor education or indoctrination for both local Sechín Alto polity members and distinguished visitors from outside. 
Within the Sechín Alto polity, the sunken room with friezes is one of two known sacred precinctsthat seemtohavevariedin accessibility and function. Unfortunately, the subject matter of the colonnade friezes at Sechín Alto site is unknown; nevertheless, we do know that the columns had distinct images, possibly repre­senting supernatural beings or culture heroes important to the polity, that were subsequently intentionally destroyed. Accesstothisinnermost partofSechínAlto sitewasveryrestricted. The sunken courtatTaukachi-Konkán and its asso­ciated friezes occupy a relatively small space, precluding visitationby massesofpeople.Nev­ertheless, it was likely more accessible than the sacred core at the Sechín Alto site, and the iconographywas probablymorebroadlyrelevant tothelocaland visiting population. Felinemotifs occur within the Sechín Alto polity at Pampa de lasLlamas-Moxeke and Cerro Sechín and as stone carvingsinthe upper CasmaValley. Feline and sea lionmotifs occuriniconographyfromthe nearby NepeñaValley(Samaniego 2011),pro.le felines were discoveredonsidetemplesat Huaca de los Reyes in the Moche Valley (Pozorski 1980), and felines continue to be important in EarlyHorizon iconography. Such commonalities arecritical becausetheyenableustothink more broadlyintermsofawidespread Initial period cosmology,and theyprovideaframework within whichtoassess and interpretnew discoveries. 
An even broader cosmological framework mayberepresentedby thesunken courtfriezes atTaukachi-Konkán. Although separatedin time and space, the cosmological model proposed by PeterRoe(1982)formanycontemporarytropical forest groups holds some intriguing comparative possibilities. In this model, he describes how many groups such as the Shipibo have a three-tiered or three-layered cosmological view of the universe: a Sky World, an Earth World, and a Subaquatic Underworld. In the tropical forest model, the Sky World is represented by the harpy eagle, theEarthWorldisrepresented by thejaguar, and the Subaquatic Underworld is represented by the caiman(Roe 1982:127– 131). Some tropical forest groups have more complex cosmologies containing more layers (Roe 1982:128), somewhat analogous to the multitiered cosmologiesoftheAztecsandMayas

of Mesoamerica(Coe 1994:178, 1999:203–206). More recently,Roe(2008:183) has interpreted Chavín iconography of the Tello Obelisk as re.ecting a similar three-tiered cosmological framework.HeretheSkyWorldis representedby the harpy eagle, theEarthWorldisrepresented by thejaguar,but the Subaquatic Underworldis representedby the caimanicdragon. 
WeproposethattheTaukachi-Konkán sunken court friezes might re.ectasimilar cosmological framework. In this scenario, the possible bird motifon thesouthwallrepresentstheSkyWorld, the feline of the west and east walls represent theEarthWorld, and thesea lions represent the Subaquatic Underworld. Thefelineofthe Earth World hasa central positioninthis cosmology, re.ecting its status as a transitional being that can, like living jaguars and pumas, go back and forth between the earth and the underworld. By proposinga link between theimagesof the Taukachi-Konkán sunken court and this broader cosmological model, we add another layer of complexity to theirinterpretation. Theidea that such images mighthave multiple,layered mean­ings should not be surprising considering the complex later iconography of Andean cultures such as Chavín and Moche, and we should also keep this potential for multiple meanings in mind when viewingisolatedimages on artifacts. Surely people living 3,500 years ago would have related to these images on various levels, recognizing them as part of a larger cosmology and worldview.
