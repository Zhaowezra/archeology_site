REVIEWS AND BOOK NOTES 
the volume contains would have been better served had 
he given some thought to the uses to which it might be 
put rather than dwelling on its departures from his own 
preferences. 
It is true, as Baudez complains at length, that most of the contributors are splitters and that many of them have produced taxa that incorporate chronological and geographic as well as morphological considerations in their classificatory decisions. Believing that an attempt to mandate purely morphological taxonomic defini­tions would be an exercise in futility, we chose instead to make explicit the bases for the analysts' naming decisions and to indicate relationships among taxa from various regions at an another classificatory level, that of ceramic systems. Ceramic systems point to relation­
ships among taxa without obscuring taxonomic and descriptive variability. Thus they provide an effective mechanism through which investigators may pursue comparative analyses and situate their own material in a regional context. The sort of regional synthesis that Baudez would have liked, elevating a few types and modes to "most significant" status, would be far less useful to the serious comparative analyst. 
Our volume, like much in archaeology, should be considered a "work in progress." We are hopeful that future collaboration with colleagues working in Honduras will result in further advances in our ability to use pottery in attempts to reconstruct prehistoric pat­terns of interaction.
