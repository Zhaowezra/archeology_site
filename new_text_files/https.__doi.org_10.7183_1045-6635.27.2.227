BATS AND THE CAMAZOTZ: CORRECTING A CENTURY OF 
MISTAKEN IDENTITY 

James E. Brady and Jeremy D. Coltman 
At the end of the nineteenth century, Eduard Seler identified the bats depicted on a ceramic vessel excavated by ErwinDieseldorffatthesiteofChama, Guatemala,asthe camazotz,ordeathbat,fromtheK’iche’ Maya myth, the PopolVuh.The attribution was never critically reviewed. Nevertheless, it became so deeply entrenched that virtually every image of aMaya bat is identified as a camazotz. We have located no ancient depictions of the Hero Twins in the chamber of thecamazotz, which calls into question the salience of this scene for the ancient Maya. In iconography and ethnohistory,multiplefigureswithbat­likecharacteristicsexist,bothbatsandanthropomorphicbat­men.Clearly,thesituationiscomplex.We argue that bats appear principally in four roles. The first is as an emblematic symbol representing some group. The batplayed a second role as a messenger, often paired on vessels with a bird. A third category relates to pollination, vegetation,and fertility, and here the bat may be paired with the hummingbird. The last and largest category is wahy beings, whichmost epigraphers now think were bestial forms of personified diseases. Included here are the many vessels depicting thefire­breathing bat, including Dieseldorff’s Chama vessel. We argue that the identification with the camazotz should bedropped altogether and that the associations proposed by Seler need to be rethought.

Popol Vuh (Christenson 2007:172) 
There is a long history of using the Popol Vuh, amytho­historical originnarrativeofthe Postclassic K’iche’Maya kingdom, asa guide for interpreting Mesoamerican iconogra­phy.At the turn of the twentieth century, EduardSeler (1904) identified the bat represented on aLate Classic ceramic vessel excavated by ErwinDieseldorff (1904) at Chama, Alta Verapaz,Guatemala, in the Q’eqchi’Maya area, as the ca­mazotz or “death bat” deity from the Popol Vuh(Figure 1). Recinos et al. (1950) used a drawingof the bat from the Dieseldorff vase to illustrate their translation of the Popol Vuh, further strengtheningtheassociationbetweenthearchae­ological images and the K’ichean myth. Thequotedpassageprovides littlesupport formakingsuch an identification. Nevertheless, it has be­come so widely accepted that virtually every 
Maya image of a bat is identified as a camazotz(Coe1982:24;FashandFash1994;Reents­Budet1994:237, 278).
As we have worked on the role of the bat in ClassicMayaideology, wehavebecome increas­ingly uneasy with the identification of all bats asrepresenting a camazotz.Another bat­like figureis also mentioned in the Popol Vuh. The messen­ger from Xibalba is described as having bat­likewings but is not called a camazotz (Recinos etal. 1950:177–178). Winged figures are depictedin Mesoamerican art, such as on the Olmec jadefigure in the Brooklyn Museum (Benson and dela Fuente 1996:246). On a polychrome bowl inthe Museo Popol Vuh in Guatemala, a figureholds a cape spread out as if it were bat wings(Reents­Budet 1994:355). (This figure is dis­cussed in greater detail in our section on wahybeings.)Ourpointhereissimple:multiplefigureswithbat­likecharacteristicsexistinMayaiconog­raphy and ethnohistorical documents. They areboth bats and anthropomorphic bat­men. Clearlythe situation is complex, but conflating them un­der a single heading, camazotz, simply obscuresthat complexity. Furthermore, we ask how theidentificationofbatimagesascamazotzadvancesour understanding in cases where they are notrelated to the Popol Vuh.

We had hoped to disentangle the various rep­resentations by examining images of bats fromscenes that were clearly drawn from the story inthe Popol Vuh. To our surprise, we were unableto find a single image from Maya ceramics thatdepicts the Hero Twins in the chamber of the ca­mazotz.1 This suggests that the scene had lowsalience for the Classic Maya,a distinctpossibil­ity in that the incident in the story is so short.Al­ternatively, the scene in the Popol Vuh may havedeveloped aftertheClassicperiodand,therefore,was not part of the Classic myth. Regardless ofthereason,thelackofimagesdepictingthisscenemakes us question why any, let alone all, imagesof bats in Maya iconography are interpreted ascamazotz. 
The lack of depictions of the Hero Twins inthe chamber of the camazotz also underscores the fact there has been no critical study of baticonography. The Chama vessel described bySeler (1904) and Dieseldorff (1904) and othervessels similar to it bear central figures with batheads and human bodies and so are clearly an­thropomorphic bat­men. These individuals arefrequently shown with flames emanating fromtheir mouths. If the camazotz could spit fire, onewould expect this distinctive feature to be men­tioned in the Popol Vuh. The fact that it is not mentionedweakenstheinterpretationofthefigureas a camazotz. 
Theissuecannowbeputtorestbecauserecentepigraphicdeciphermentshaveidentifiedthisbatfigure. Grubeand Nahm (1994:701) readthe textaccompanying the bat figure on K10802 as K’ak’:sotz’, literally “fire bat.” The reading im­plies exactly that the red scroll is actually fire.The image on the vessel depicts a bat that, ac­cording to Grube and Nahm (1994:701), has“scrolls of red blood or flames emerge from theopenedmouth.” In aslightlyamendedtranslationofthetextonK1080,Stuart(2005:162)deciphersthe phrase as K’ahk’ Uti’ sutz’, meaning “fire isthe bat’s mouth” or “fire is the bat’s speech.” A wide array of these bats appears on other LateClassic Maya vessels, including the Dieseldorffvase (Romero 2013:Figures 41a–d,46).Whatweare looking at is not a camazotz, but a bat whosemain attribute is elaborate scrolls of fire exitingthe mouth. 
Blood, Decapitation, and Sacrifice:

ACritique of Seler’s Interpretations 
Not only do we feel that Seler erred when heidentified the figures on Dieseldorff’s Chamavessel as the camazotz, but he compounded theerror by equating these with bat deities depictedin Late Postclassic Central Mexican codices. In the Codex Borgia, the bat deity is depicted aslicking the blood from the gaping wound in thechest of a person (Figure 2a; Seler 1904:235–236). In this depiction, the deity wears a trophyhead on his own chest. The Codex Vaticanus B shows an anthropomorphic bat cutting off thehead of an individual with one hand and holdinga second severed human head in its other hand (Figure 2b; Seler 1904:236–237). In the CodexFejérváry­Mayer, an anthropomorphic bat is de­picted with a heart in one hand and a decapitatedhead in the other (Figure2c).The Codex PorfirioDíaz(Pl.1c)showsananthropomorphicbathold­ing a heart in one hand and a human head in theother(Thompson 1966:181).Focusing onthe de­capitation of Junahpu, Seler saw a clear parallelin the Central Mexican bat deities. We stress the fact that Seler’s interpretation was driven by theiconography of Postclassic Central Mexicancodices. Seler rarely touches on Classic Mayaiconography, and the images on the Dieseldorffvase are not even remotely similar to those in theMexican codices. 
In Classic Maya iconography of the SouthernLowlands,thethemes ofblood,decapitation, andsacrifice are notas explicitly depicted, and so wequestion whether they are the primary associa­tions.As far as we are aware, no image from theClassic period shows a bat as a decapitator. Con­versely, we know of no Classic decapitation nar­rative thathas aparallel in the PopolVuh.Asam­ple of Late Classic Maya vase scenes (K1256,K3924, K8936) shows a multitude of otherstrange supernatural beings such as jaguars andGodAholding severed heads, yet the bat is curi­ously absent from such contexts.
Although Classic Maya bat depictions differsubstantially from those of Late Postclassic Cen­tral Mexico, Seler took the crossbones and dis­embodied eyeballs on the wings of bats and the“death collar” of eyeballs around their neck asevidence that Classic Maya bats had the same

associations with blood, decapitation, and sacri­fice as Postclassic Central Mexican bat deities. In part, our objection stems from the fact that wequestion rather than simply accept that the cross­bones and disembodied eyeballs are related tosacrifice. Stuart (Vogt and Stuart 2005:157) sug­gests thatthebonesandeyesagainsta dark back­ground may simply refer to subterranean space.Thedesign on the wing of abat, therefore, wouldsimply designate it as a “cave bat” (Figure 3).The disembodied eyeball also appears with theimpinged bone glyph on a half­shaded back­ground and so may, as Stuart suggests, relate tothe underground space. The cross­hatchingaround the eyeball indicates darkness and maybe associated with the fact that this is a spacewhere people cannot see. It is possible that eyesappearing on bat wings, therefore, have more todo with the actual function of sight. One of theoutstanding characteristics of bats is their appar­ent ability to “see” in complete darkness. 


Bats in Ethnohistory and the Emblematic
Use of Bats in Iconography 

The images of bats in Maya ethnohistoricalsourcesare more varied,morepositive,andmoresocially important than implied by iconographicdepictions. Bats were closely associated with anumber of groups of different size in the MayaHighlands, includingtheTzotzillinguisticgroup.Ximenez reports that the bat was the patron ofZinacantan, the deity of that town took the formof a bat, and its inhabitants called themselves“batmen” (Calnek1988:47).ThebookofChilamBalam ofTizimin, from the northern Maya Low­lands,mentionsanimportanttownnamedZotz’il, or “bats” (Edmonson 1982:68).
The royal line (perhaps a lineage [Orellana1981:159]) of the Kaqchikel was called zotzilá­ha, the House of the Bat (Recinos et al.1950:179). Seler (1904:234) suggests that thishousewasacave.Thispossibilityis strengthenedby the documented association of lineages andclansintheMayaareawithparticularcaves(Gui­teras Holmes 1947:1).The king of the Kaqchikelwas called Ahpop­Zotzil, lord bat or chief of the zotzils (Recinos and Goetz 1953:47), and theirpatron god, not surprisingly, took the form of abat (Recinos et al. 1950:180). Reents­Budet

(1994:238) suggests that a polychrome vesselfrom Alta Verapaz in the Los Angeles CountyMuseum of Art containing rows and columns ofpainted bat heads “may be emblematic of a par­ticular social group or ruling family, similar tothe heraldic emblems of European royal lin­eages.” If Reents­Budet is correct, this may sig­nify that kin groups associated with bats weresomewhat widespread inAlta Verapaz because anumber of vessels with similar decoration have been documented.3 Neither the identification of groups with the bat nor the "emblematic" use ofthe bat motif in iconography appears to have anyconnection with the camazotz. 
The dangers of attempting to force an identi­fication with the camazotz of the Popol Vuh is nowherebetter illustratedthaninFashandFash’s (1994) interpretation of Structure 20 at Copan.Based on the multiple bat sculptures adorningthe now­destroyed structure, they conclude thatthe ancient Copanecos had built the “House ofBats” from the Popol Vuh and entertain the idea that additional structures at the site might haverepresented the other “torture houses” mentioned in the story (Fash and Fash 1994:66). Nonethe­less, they recognize Structure 20 as a sacredmountain of the site. Consequently, we suspectthat it was designed to deliver an important po­litical message. Fash and Fash do not state howthe construction of “torture houses” would have served to legitimize royal power. 


Bats as Servants or Messengers 
A second role played by bats is that of servantsormessengers.The Memorial deSololá (Recinos1980:42) relates that a bat guards the doors ofTulan.As mentioned earlier, the messenger fromXibalba in the Popol Vuh is described as havingbat­like wings (Recinos et al. 1950:177–178).
In a myth about the creation of flowers in theCodex Magliabechiano, a bat produced fromQuetzalcoatl’s semen acts as a messenger or ser­vant, biting off apiece of Xochiquetzal’s genitalsandbringingittothegod(Boone1983:206–207).ElizabethHill Boone (2007:204) notesthat in theCodexBorgiaasimilar—butnotidentical—sceneis depicted. Here, a bat descends towards Xochi­quetzal with a torrent of blood and flowers. Fourhummingbirds appear to be feeding on the bat,asif thebatitself represented an aromaticflower.Another hummingbird, this time in the guise ofQuetzalcoatl, stands on a flowering tree thatgrowsfromXochiquetzal’sheart,whichisplacedwithin a solar sign. Nicholson (2006:374) notesthat on page 30 of the Codex Borbonicus, a batdancerparticipatesinthe veintena of Ochpaniztlidedicated to Teteoinnan, who is conceptually re­lated to Xochiquetzal. The presence of the batimpersonator may relate to the myth recorded inthe Magliabachiano and Borgia.
Houston et al. (2006:232) note thatthe “cross­cultural linkage of birds or winged deities withmessengers does not require much of a stretch.Birds, much like messengers, move with swiftresolve. They dart through the air like speechscrolls but communicate beyond the normal pro­jection of human lungs.” This is clearly true ofbats. The Huichol believe that wind, personifiedby a hummingbird, isa favorite messenger of thegods(Zingg 1938:245). Blaffer (1972:131) notesthat, for Zinacantecos, a nocturnal hummingbirdactsasthemessengeroftheancestorsandisoftenconfused with the bat. We argue below that forthe Maya, bats were, in fact, the nocturnal coun­terparts of hummingbirds. Thus, given the closerelationship between bats and hummingbirdsamong the Classic Maya (Barthel 1968:86; Blaf­fer 1972:130–131), bats also may have beenviewed as messengers.

earth deities.AMixe informant jokingly referredto bats as “children of the earth” (los hijos del mundo) but refused to explain the nature of thejoke (Miller and Villa 1956:254). Orellana(1981:160)alsoassociated thebatwiththe Earth. The link between bats and Earth is explicit inbat iconography. In Classic Maya art, bat wings,like water lilies and turtle shells, are often ren­dered witha cross­net patterning (Figure 4).Thismotif, referred to as the “earth net,” is one of the most widely employed symbols of Earth in an­cientMayaart(Taube2010:149).Thus,batwingsaredepictedwithaspecificearthmotif,indicatingan intimate relationship with Earth (Miller 1991:Figure 32; K3639).
The connection with caves and Earth is im­portant in another respect in that these are widelyseen as being the repositories of revelations andesotericknowledge.DorisHeyden(1975:142)hasproposed that the cave beneath the Pyramid ofthe Sun at Teotihuacan may have been used byoracles.ShankariPatel(2005:102–104)hasarguedthatacenote­templeatSanGervasio,onCozumelIsland, held the oracle of the goddess Ixchel. Therelationship between caves and auguries is stillseen today in ethnographic sources. Each year,the alcalde rezadores at Santa Eulalia, Huehuete­nango, Guatemala, go to the cave of Yalan Na toreceive the great prophecy during the uayeb (LaFarge 1947:128).Asimilar ritual,in whichnativeofficials entered the Cave of the Ancestors on May 3, the Day of the Cross,and spoke to the an­cestors, is recorded by June Nash (1970:22–23).
The role of the bat as messenger and its asso­ciation with Earth are usedasspecific referencestoscribes.AndreaStone(2005)arguesthatscribesare associated with caves. She interprets a sceneon Vase No. 16 from Lords of the Underworld (Coe 1978) as depicting a scribe on a pilgrimagevisit to a cave receivingthe paintpotemblematicof scribal office from God N (Stone 2005:136–139).AlthoughHouston(2001:337)hasaslightlydifferent interpretation of the scene, both agreethat the scene legitimizes scribal status throughsupernatural investiture.

bird is interesting in light of Houston et al.’s(2006:232) comment about birds as messengersandalsobecauseasimilarbirdispairedwithabatonK1080andK2716,suggestingthattheanimalsare acting as messengers. Romero (2013:142) ex­plicitly recognizes the role of the bat as a messen­ger from the gods to scribes. The relationship be­tween a scribe and a bat is represented in severalscenes in Classic Maya iconography. One poly­chrome vessel (K3639) depicts an anthropomor­phic bat addressing an artist seated on a thronewhile carving a mask.The wings of this bat recallthe cape ofAhkan on the Museo Popol Vuh bowl(this image is discussed further in the section onwahy beings).Anothersceneonapolychromeves­sel (K4550) depicts an anthropomorphic bat, thistimewithoutacape,conferringwithascribalartistwho holds a paint pot and brush. On the oppositeside of the vessel, a hummingbird shares a flowerand communicates with another individual. The pairing illustrates the relationship we suggest be­tween birds and bats as messengers. The pairingof the bat with a hummingbird is discussed ingreater depth in the next section. 


Bats and Fertility 
The associations of bats with Earth and fertilityareconsistent with others that link bats withveg­etation. Blaffer (1972:64) mentions a passage inthe book of Chilam Balam of Chumayel—”Thendescended the four mighty supernatural jars, thiswasthehoneyoftheflowers”—andnotesparallelpassagesinthebooksofChilamBalamofTiziminand Mani: “Then descended two mighty demonbatswhosuckedthehoneyoftheflowers.”These parallel expressions appearto associate batswithnectar. Another passage in the Chilam Balam ofTizimin describes Chac Vayab as the bat whoalso suckshoney fromflowers (Blaffer1972:65).
In another place, Blaffer (1972), followingLaughlin, equates nectar with blood to return tothe traditional association of bats with blood and sacrifice.Ratherthancreatingametaphortotreadthat well­worn path, we prefer to focus on theclear, obvious, and explicit association with nec­tar, pollination, and fertility. Blaffer (1972:130–131) notes the close relationship between batsand hummingbirds, suggesting that the relation­ship with fertility was the message intended by theMaya.Infact,oneClassicMayavase(K1254)depicts a hummingbird attached to the head of abat god as if it were sucking nectar. In nature,both creaturescan be seen atdusk suckingnectarfrom the same night­flowering plant species. Wesuspect that this may have led to the bat beingseen as the nocturnal counterpart of the hum­mingbird. Among the tree species that are polli­nated by bats is the cosmologically importantceiba tree (Blaffer 1972:65).
The discussion of bats in association with flowers, nectar, and hummingbirds has profoundimplications for the analysis of the meaning ofbatsinprecolumbianMayasocietybecausemanyscholars argue that the species portrayed is thevampirebat(Benson1988:104;Dieseldorff1904;Muñoz2006:18;Thompson1962:348, 1966:177,180).5 If these are not vampire bats, then the log­ical association with blood evaporates and un­dercutstheassociationwith decapitationandsac­rifice. We note that vampire bats today tend tofeed on livestock, which were not present in pre­columbian times. It is likely that vampire batswere fewer in number and therefore probablyplayed a smaller role in ancient society.
We also note that bats have a strong sexualconnotation that suggests a relationship with fer­tility (Benson 1988:119; Romero 2013:118).Thebat sculptures from Copan show the creatureswith prominently displayed and erect penises(Fash and Fash 1994:63; Romero 2013:119, fig­ure 47). Some bats on Maya polychrome vesselsare also shown with male genitalia (Dieseldorff1904:Plate XLIX; K1080; K1901; K3007;K6996).Brady(1988)haspointedoutthatachar­acteristic of cave­dwelling supernatural beingsistheir highly sexual nature. Blaffer (1972:68–73)has noted that there are a number of connections between bats and the h?ik’al, whose most note­worthy feature is his six­foot­long penis and hy­per­fertility. This relationship appears to be thebasis of the Zinacanteco expression that a girlwho loses her virginity has been “ruined by abat” (Blaffer 1972:120).

moremalevolentaspects. Earlierin thisstudywesuggested that the principal bat character for theLate Classic Maya was not a camazotz, but a batthat emits fire from its mouth (Grube and Nahm1994). Although we have rejected the camazotzlabel for the bat during the Classic period, werecognizethatthebatconstitutedpartofthebroadcategory of the poorly understood wahy beingsthatfrequently appear on LateClassicMaya ves­sels (Houston and Stuart 1989).
In one example, a wahy bat holds a plate ofsevered hands, feet, and other body parts consti­tutingtheprobablesustenance ofthe broadercat­egory of Maya wahy beings (K1080). Holdingplates of human offal is not a task reserved justforbats.Other wahy beingsshownholdingsimilarplates containing any combination of humanhands, eyeballs, and femurs include the toad,monkey, canine, jaguar, rodent, and turkey (seeK1181, K1231, K1376, K1259, K4116, K1380,K1442, K2010, K3242, and K8733). If the batwere the camazotz of the Classic period, onewould certainly expect to find a more isolatedrole for him, particularly one that expressed theact of decapitation.
As far as we are aware, no Classic­period textmentions the bat as decapitator or equates it withany narrative that parallels the Popol Vuh. The closestrelationship we havebeen able to findbe­tween bats and decapitation is with the wahy be­ing known asAhkan, mentioned earlier in regardto his image on the Museo Popol Vuh bowl,where he is depicted spreading his cape with thecrossbones and disembodied eyeballs, as if itwere bat wings (Reents­Budet 1994:355). In thenext image on the same vessel, Ahkan appears,without his cape, in the act of self­decapitation(Grube2004;Romero2013:59;StoneandZender2011). Any attempt to use these scenes to linkbats with decapitation would be tenuous indeed.At best, both Ahkan and bats were part of thesame general category of wahy beings that wereidentified with a similar symbol set that includedcrossbones, eyeballs, and on occasion, skeletalmandibles.6 Rather than death and sacrifice, thiscomplex, in our opinion, is more indicative ofthemes related to caves, sorcery, darkness, andthe general category of Maya wahy beings.
Although decapitation does certainly occur inClassic Maya art, it is at the hands of other wahy beings rather than the bat. The skeletal God A isoften shown with a decapitated human head inhand (K1256, K1490, K8803, K8936, andK3924). A probable manifestation of this deityknown as “Turtle Foot Death” appears on the so­called Frieze of the Dream Lords at Toniná, witha decapitated head in hand (Martin and Grube2000:185). Various depictions of Classic­periodskull racks exist in art, including the Frieze of theDream Lords (K3924; K3038; Houston et al.2006:Figure 6.18b). An actual skull rack morethan likely existed at Toniná with the back of therackdepictingthedreadedwahy inmodeledstucco (Houston et al. 2006:221).The bat is absent fromtheseexamples.Evenifoneweretoexist,itwouldonly further demonstrate that the bat was part ofa much broader complex of maleficent creatures.
Originally considered to be companion spiritsor “co­essences,” these strange bestial creaturesarenow thoughttobemore representativeofsor­cery and personified illnesses (Houston et al.2006; Stuart 2005). Some ethnographic accountsregardingthebatseemtoconfirmthis.InYucatan,illness may be caused by bats (Ankli et al.1999:148). Thompson (1962:348) notes that thebat “is regarded as a sorcerer and is associatedwith sorcery” in the Maya area. In San MiguelAcatán, Huehuetenango, Guatemala, this is as­cribed to the bat’s ability to suck the blood ofvictims without being felt (Siegel 1941:71). Theassociation appears to be widespread (Alcorn1984:181; Villa 1966:3) and ancient (Coe andWhittaker 1982:64) in Mesoamerica.
Perhaps growing out of this, most referencesto bats in ethnographic sources have a generallynegativeconnotation,connectingbatswithdeath,destruction, and evil. Among the K’iche’ ofNahualá, a bat entering one’s house foreshadowsmisfortune (Ishcol et al. 1970:49). The Tzotzilconsiderbats tobe “scavengerrobbersassociatedwith blood” (Blaffer 1972:68). They are consid­ered abnormal because they are nocturnal, livein caves, sleep upside down, and consume blood(Blaffer 1972:69). The Kanjobal fear bats andperform ceremonies so that livestock that hasbeen bitten will not die (Grollig 1959:185–185).AmongtheHuastec,batsflyingfromacavewhena curer and patient approach may be taken as anomen that the patient is guilty of some transgres­sion (Alcorn 1984:237).

Discussion and Conclusion 
This paperhassought to radically shift theanaly­sis of Maya bat iconography away from identi­fyingeverybatasacamazotz(Coe1982:24;Fashand Fash 1994; Reents­Budet 1994:237, 278). Ithasbeennoted thatwehavenotfoundanysceneson Classic Maya pottery that show the HeroTwins in the chamber of the camazotz. This sug­gests that the incident in the story was not ofgreat importance to the ancient Maya. If a depic­tion of a bat is not related to the incident in the Popol Vuh, then its attribution as a camazotz is wrong and obscures our understanding of themessage of the ancient image. Furthermore, thenear universality of identifying bats with the ca­mazotz has inhibited critical study of the role ofbats in Maya art.
We also have criticized the uncritical adher­ence of the field to Seler’s association of bats with blood, sacrifice, and decapitation. This wasbasedonSeler’soverrelianceonalimitednumber of depictionsfromLatePostclassic CentralMex­ican codices for the interpretation of bats in allparts of Mesoamerica and for all time periods.Wesuspectthatthebatmayhavebeenextensivelyreworked in Late Postclassic Central Mexico to play a role in the state cult of warfare. We havecited recent work that calls into question the in­terpretation of the crossbones and disembodiedeyeballsshownonbat wingsasrepresentingsac­rifice and decapitation. Our intent here is to re­open a discussion on bat iconography that hasbeen largely closed for over a century.
In place of the former identification of bats ascamazotz, with an interpretative emphasis onblood, sacrifice, and decapitation, our own exam­inationofClassic­periodimagessuggeststheneedforamorecomplexandnuancedanalysisthatrec­ognizes the complexity of bat iconography. Wehave argued that bats appear principally in fourroles. The first is as an emblematic symbol repre­senting some group. There is a good deal of eth­nohistoric evidence of a strong identification ofgroups with the bat.This is seen iconographicallyonvasesfromAltaVerapazwithrowsandcolumnsof bat heads and in the bat sculpture of Copan.The second role played by the bat is as a messen­ger, often paired on vessels with a bird. We havenoted that the bat has a special relationship with scribes in this context. A third category relates topollination,vegetation,andfertility,wherethe batmay be paired with the hummingbird. This cate­gory flies in the face of the widely accepted ideathat the vampire bat served as the model for alldepictions. Thus, the argument for an associationwithblood,decapitation,andsacrificemustbere­assessed.Thelastandlargestcategoryisasa wahybeing.Includedherearethemanyvesselsdepictingthe fire­breathing bat, including Dieseldorff’sChama vessel. This last type of bat depiction isrelatedtocaves,sorcery,darkness,andthegeneralcategory of Maya wahy beings.
To conclude, we argue that the identificationof bat images as representing camazotz is simplymistaken unless the scene can be shown to relate to the story in the Popol Vuh. Because of the early date of publication, the relative dearth ofimages available, and the author’s well­deservedeminence in the field, Seler’s interpretation waswidely accepted and became firmly entrenched.Interestingly, Seler wrote at a time when therewas little comprehension of the significance ofcaves in Maya archaeology, and his own work atQuen Santo reflects this lack of understanding(Brady et al. 2009). The emergence of cave ar­chaeology over the last several decades has al­tered archaeological appreciation of the impor­tance of the subterranean world for the ancient Maya. We call for a reinterpretation of bats thatbrings them in line with current thinking.

Notes 
1. 
Reents­Budet (1994:278) claims that a scene on a poly­chrome vessel represents a camazotz and the Hero Twins. Onclose examination, however, there is no basis for identifyingthe figures around the rim of the bowl as Junahpu and Xbal­anque. This underscores the problem we are addressing. Theidentificationofbatswith camazotzhas become soentrenched that it colors interpretation even in the face of disconfirmingevidence.

All numbers preceded by a “K” refer to images in theMayaVaseDatabase,anarchiveofrolloutphotographscreatedby Justin Kerr at www.mayavase.com. The vessels in thatdatabase that are referred to in this article lack provenienceand are held by private collectors. In order to conform to theethics of the Society for American Archaeology, we are notincluding images of these vases in our article. We also haveopted not to include two images of unprovenienced vesselsheldbytheLosAngelesCountyMuseumofArtandtheMuseoPopol Vuh.

4. 
Where Earth appears capitalized and in italics, it refersto the indigenous belief in the earth as a sacred, animate, andsentient being (see Brady and Prufer 2005 for a discussion ofthis). The Spanish term mundo (as in the next sentence) often refers to the same concept.

5. 
Because of Mesoamerican influence in the American Southwest, it is noteworthy that bats are depicted, not withdisembodied eyeballs, but with flowers on their wings (Hays­Gilpin and Hill 1999:Figure 2a).


6.The hieroglyph for darkness or night,Ak’ab, frequentlyappears as part of the general diagnostic criteria of bats andAhkan. Vessels bearing this sign are also held by these deitiesas well as by the preeminent rain deity, Chahk (Stone andZender 2011:145).
