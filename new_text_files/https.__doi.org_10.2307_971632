
HOUSEHOLD AND FAMILY AT MOCHE, PERU: 
AN ANALYSIS OF BUILDING AND RESIDENCE PATTERNS 
IN A PREHISPANIC URBAN CENTER 

Hendrik Van Gijseghem 
The Moche was the last complex society to develop on the Peruvian north coast during the Early Intermediate Period (200 B.C.-700 A.D.). While archaeological research on the Moche has traditionally concentrated on the impressive marks of polit­ical and religious power, we know relatively little about Moche household organization and patterns of residence. In this research, conducted at the eponymous site of Moche, I identify three types of architectural organization relating to both residential and nonresidential spaces. An analysis of building materials and architectural superposition suggests a close relationship among construction quality, household size, and occupational continuity, in the case of residential architecture. The observed diff 
er­ences, I argue, reflect strategies of household social reproduction among Moche 's urban population that depend largely on socioeconomic status. I also contend that different 
forms of labor were responsible for tire construction of residential com­pounds and other specialized areas, the function of which may not be primarily residential. This research emphasizes the great potential of studying domesticity in prehistory as well as the dynamics of urban construction and suggests methods effective

La cultura Moche representa la ultima sociedad compleja que se desarroll6 en la Costa Norte del Peru durante el Perfodo Inter­medio Temprano (200 a.C.-700 d.C.). Si bien las investigaci6nes acerca de esta cultura tradicionalmente se han concentrado en los impresionantes monumentos asociados con el poder polftico y religioso, muy poco se sabe sabre la organizaci6n de la vivienda de las Moche. En esta investigaci6n, que se realiz6 en el sitio de Moche, he identificado tres tipos de organizaci6n arquitect6nica. El andlisis de los materiales de construcci6n y de las superposiciones arquitect6nicas sugiere que existe una estrecha relaci6n entre la calidad de construcci6n, el tamaiio de la vivienda, y la continuidad de su ocupaci6n. Encontramos que las viviendas pequeiias, en las cuales se dio poca atenci6n a la elaboraci6n arquitect6nica, presentan una ocupaci6n breve; fueron construidas en la tierra vacante y se abandonaron despues de su ocupaci6n. Par otra parte, en las viviendas multifamiliares mds grandes se observan ma yores niveles de inversion de tiempo y esfuerzas en la arquitectura, as{ coma una ocupaci6n continua y dindmica que puede perdurar varias generaciones. Las diferencias observadas estarfan reflejando diversas estrategias en la reproducci6n social de los hogares familiares entre la poblaci6n urbana de Moche, que habrfan dependido en gran parte del estatus socioecon6mico de sus habitantes. Tambien se observa que la construcci6n de todos los conjuntos residencialesfue realizada con formas de orga­nizaci6n de/ trabajo distintas a las aplicadas en la construcci6n de las edificaciones que pertenecen a la infraestructura polftica del estado. Los resultados de esta investigac6n revelan el gran potencial que puede ofrecer el estudio de las estructuras domesti­cas en la prehistoria. Tambien sugieren metodos eficaces para la reconstrucci6n de la forma de las viviendas y las familias, y sus cambios en las sociedades urbanas.

from an eminent corporate, religious, and adminis­trative center: the eponymous Moche site (Figure 1 ). 
Occupation at fhe site spans the Early Intermedi­ate Period (200 B.C.-A.D. 700) from the end of the Gallinazo phase, through Moche phases I through 
IV. After reaching its apogee-in the Moche IV phase, the site was abandoned at the start of the Middle Hori­zon Moche V phase, a period of political reorgani­zation (Shimada 1994). 
This paper addresses the architectural variability present on the Moche site and attempts to assess con­struction quality in order to address issues of socioe­conomic inequality represented by urban domestic architecture. Data were collected during the 1995 and 1996 field seasons of the Zona Urbana del Sitio Moche (ZUM) Project directed by Dr. Claude Chapdelaine of the Universite de Montreal. Twelve architectural groups were excavated during this period (Figure 2). The strategy emphasized hori­zontal clearing of the outline of visible structures and their excavation down to the level of the first clay floor, so this paper is primarily concerned with the later, Moche IV, occupation of the site. 
In this research, I consider four scales of archi­tectural analysis, including (1) building materials; (2) walls and simple features; (3) rooms and complex features; and (4) architectural compounds, hence­forth termed Architectural Areas or AA (following Topic's [1977) terminology). I am assuming that construction quality is a reflection of differential eco­nomic investments in appearance and durability (Abrams 1989; McGuire and Schiffer 1983; Rathje 1983; Rathje and McGuire 1982). I then assess the socioeconomic variability in the organizational dynamics of the household on a diachronic basis, seeking to perceive the alterations made to an archi­tectural structure through time and to determine the degree to which these changes reflect continuity with preceding occupations. In other words, in each Archi­tectural Area, I ask: did the inhabitants of Moche rebuild the same compound or were significant trans­formations made? I believe this question is of sig­nificance in determining variations in residence patterns and their socioeconomic correlates. 
The distinction between residential and nonresi­dential structures is difficult to assess in Moche urban setting (Shimada 1994; Uceda and Armas 1997), and I am choosing to include in my sample a type of archi-

tecture that is arguably nonresidential. It corresponds to an architectural organization that is different from residential ones, and its consideration here allows us to further our understanding of Moche urban plan­ning, labor organization, and socioeconomic vari­ability. The overall results suggest the existence of three different architectural patterns reflecting socioeconomic differences, state investment in set­tlement planning, and postmarital residential pat­terns in the late occupations of the Moche site. 
Moche Domestic Architecture 
Other than occasional descriptive and casual com­ments, Moche domestic architecture typically has not received much attention for phases prior to Moche V (Campana 1983). It is nevertheless necessary to mention the works of Teresa Lange Topic at the Moche site (1977, 1982), which constitute the bulk of the available data. In addition, domestic architec­ture has been described succinctly in the context of valley-wide settlement pattern studies, particularly by Willey (1953) in the Vinl valley, Donnan (1973) and Wilson (1988) in Santa, Proulx (l 968) in Nepeiia, and Billman (1996) in the Moche valley. The works of Bawden ( 1982, 1990), Anders ( 1981 ), and Shimada (1990, 1994) are notable for their innova­tive approach to Middle Horizon Moche V domes­tic and administrative compounds in Galindo (Moche valley) and Pampa Grande (Lambayeque valley). 
Moche residences are generally described as being made of adobe bricks or cut stone masonry, which form part or the entirety of the walls, with veg­etable material covered with clay ( quincha) com­prising the upper part. Floor plans are consistently rectangular and structures are usually an aggregation of several rooms, typically incorporating an open patio (Benson 1972; Campana 1983; Donnan 1976). Some walls are made of stones but in the majority of cases adobes seem to have been preferred, at least in the lower valley and large centers (Campana 1983;

Topic 1977). Some scholars recognize that during the Moche V period adobes were largely appropriated for construction by the socioeconomic elite (Baw­den 1982, 1990; Shimada 1994). 
Iconographic representations enable us to obtain a partial picture of architectural details. However, such interpretations require great caution since it can be difficult to distinguish between the symbolic and factual aspects of the representational content (Ben­son 1972). For example, one of the most striking aspects of buildings painted or modeled on Moche ceramics are the steep slopes of the roofs. Explana­tions for this feature often include the need for ven­tilation, lighting, and/or protection against the occasional torrential rains. According to Gillin ( 1973 :40), roofs of mid-twentieth-century houses in the surrounding region have an unintentional low­grade slope due to their composition, which requires shorter pieces of wood than a fiat roof. The height of Moche gables may have been associated with wealth (through their inherent visibility and mater­ial cost). Evidence exists to suggest that steep gables were not merely part of a sacred set of signs but actu­ally characterized some elite structures (Donnan 1976:75-76; Tello 1998:121). This peculiar archi­tectural canon seems to have preoccupied Moche artists in their portrayal of buildings. 
Architectural Coponents on the Moche Site: The Sample 
The sample analyzed includes 12 arbitrarily delim­ited Architectural Areas (Al\) in which clearing and excavations have taken place during the 1995 and 1996 seasons. Data from these Architectural Areas are of uneven quality. Most of my interpretations come from studies of AA #5, AA #6, AA #7, AA #9, AA #15 (Figure 2), and of a sector composed of a patio and surrounding features (labeled AA #10, AA #11,AA #12, andAA #13; which are treated together as a single entity referred to as the Public Patio Area in this paper, except when stated otherwise). Detailed description of the architectural data can be found in Van Gijseghem (1997), Chapdelaine (1995, 1996, 1997, 1998), and Chapdelaine et al. (1997). Com­mon room functions that I have identified in all Archi­tectural Areas include cooking spaces often associated with a food preparation area, large gen­eral-purpose spaces (analogous to Bawden's [1982] sala), storage rooms, and many small antechambers. Of particular interest are the dynamics of super­
position of the occupations. There is a clear demar­cation between dwellings that were built over a long period and those characterized by a momentary con­struction event. The former type demonstrates a sus­tained occupational history in the form of superimposed floors, subdivided rooms, demolished walls, and annexes. However, some Architectural Areas include only a single construction phase and evidence little or no transformation over time. 
Architectural Area #5 (Figure 3) is a partially excavated two-room structure. The smaller of these . 
rooms contained two parallel ovens but their precise function could not be determined. The structure was built over 1 m of windblown sediment, under which a previous structure with different orientation and higher construction quality was encountered, albeit

in a small test-pit. Material remains were few and primarily composed of domestic wares. 
AA #6 (Figure 4) is a small domestic unit com­posed of a perimeter wall that contains a core of five rooms exhibiting some degree of food preparation, as evidenced by culinary refuse, ash deposits, and fire-altered architectural clay. Artifactual content is not abundant and is mainly composed of plainware (Chapdelaine 1997, 1998). The kitchen area includes burned adobes and a large grinding stone. The fau­nal assemblage (Vasquez and Rosales 1998) includes mollusc ( Donax obesulus and Scutalus proteus ), birds (P halacrocorax sp.), camelids, and is domi­nated by fish (Paralonchurus peruanus). 
AA #7 (Figure 5) is a large compound with com­plex architectural superposition, evidence for stor­age, and other specialized use of space. The compound contains a cylindrical chimney and a series of ten large alias aligned along the thick west wall (Chapdelaine 1997, 1998). This infrastructure may suggest a period of specialized economic activ­ity. A series of three niches built in a small rectan­gular room is part of one of the later (although not the latest) occupations. A large cache of fine ceram­ics was found embedded in the floor in one of the rooms. Culinary refuse includes several varieties of mollusc, fish, guinea pigs, and camelids in three dis­tinct spatial concentrations (Chapdelaine 1998). Ceramic assemblage is varied and abundant and includes both plainware and fineware. 
AA #9 (Figures 5 and 6) is located across a nar­row street from AA #7. It was the most completely excavated unit on the site at the time of the analysis. At least two zones of combustion with associated food remains are perceptible and the compound is composed of three interconnected residential units. One of these has a door opening onto the street with an elaborate stone doorsill. Based on wall abutments, I suggest that the easternmost unit is an annex that was built some time after the others. At the time of the analysis, this Architectural Area contained 22 rooms, but subsequent excavations revealed a total of 45 rooms and three hearths, supporting the idea of three residential subunits. A small burial platform was also found as part of this compound, which sug­gests real or fictive kinship ties among the three res­idential groups. I will discuss this possibility in a later section of the paper. Room 9-4, by analogy with a similar one excavated by Tello (1998), may be a small shrine covered by a gabled roof. The hearths revealed a fauna! assemblage dominated by Llama sp. Mollusc and fish were also present, albeit in smaller quantities (Vasquez and Rosales 1998: 182). In this case as well, ceramic content was abundant and revealed the presence of looted burials, domes­tic plainware vessels, and large storage jars. 
The Public Patio Area (Figures 5 and 7) comprises a patio measuring 15 by 12.5 m, a street running north to south and the surrounding architectural features. The patio itself contains benches and platforms, including one accessible by a ramp, evidence of roof­ing on parts of it, jars embedded in the floors, and an elite burial on its northeastern side. It appears that a single access point exists, which provides access to

and from the street located to the West. The patio is surrounded by AA #10, in which an adobe step-motif and a niche were excavated (Van Gijseghem 1997); AA # 11, with evidence of food preparation; AA# 12, composed of large rooms; and AA #13 (across the street) characterized by semisubterranean storage rooms and bins. AA #13 also has an elaborate adobe doorsill and three other points of access in the form of small two-and three-tiered stairs leading over the wall to the street. 
It appears that the patio itself had restricted access, with a single doorway opening onto the street, mak­ing the designation "public" somewhat misleading. From the street, one doorway leads to the kitchen (AA #11 ), and at least four points of access lead to AA #13. Although the street is by definition a pub­lic space, the ease with which one can gain entry to the storage facilities of AA # 13 leads me to believe that the sector may have had restricted access beyond the excavated area. Inspection of the Patio floors and doorsill revealed little wear, which suggests that it was not a surface of intense, repeated use. The nar­rowness of the street may have controlled circula­tion flow, as suggested by Shimada ( 1994) in Moche V Pampa Grande. The cooking space in AA # l l con­sists of a low platform and a hearth contained by burned adobes. The fauna] assemblage comprises mollusc (Donax obesulus and Semimytilus algosus ), crustaceans (Platyxanthus orbingyi), and Llama sp. (Vasquez and Rosales 1998:183).

Figure 6. Isometric View of Architectural Area #9 with the location of elements discussed in the text. 
AA #15 (Figure 8) is very similar in form to AA #6. In this case, too, a small number of rooms (three) are aligned at one end of a large enclosed space and demonstrate signs of domestic activity. The kitchen area contains a low concentration of faunal remains dominated by mollusc, fish, and the bones of a few guinea pigs (Vasquez and Rosales 1998: 185). Clear­ing down to the base of two of the walls revealed no direct association with previous construction. Ceramic content is not abundant and includes pri­marily plainware sherds. 
Levels of Analysis aud Architectural Elaboration: Assessing Quality of Construction 
Walls. Invariably, walls in our sample were con­structed with adobe bricks to arying heights. The uppermost portion of the walls was probably built of plant material. Being more durable and expensive than quincha (wattle and daub), adobe is considered a mark of greater investment and status. Adobe lay­out displays substantial variability and includes vir­tually every possible brick layout. I computed the

average wall height as an index of material invest­ment in permanence and durability. Wall thickness demonstrated little variability due to the consistency in brick layout. 
Clay Plaster ( Enlucido ). A fair number of walls in most Architectural Areas are coated with clays of varying quality. Although the variation seems con­tinuous, I determ1ned two criteria to characterize such a coating. A simple coat of clay applied fol­lowing the construction of the wall represents a rel­atively inferior level of quality; it can be thin enough to expose the position of the adobes underneath. A relatively superior quality coating is uniform, often made of finer clay, is smooth and homogeneous, and conceals the underlying brick pattern. Such a layer is often continuous with the floor forming a single unbroken surface, suggesting simultaneous con­struction events. 
Floors. Floor types also vary in quality. The infe­rior quality involves no preparation whatsoever and it appears that in these cases people were living directly on the desert sand. The intermediate level consists of a surface of packed earth distinct from the natural matrix, which entailed spreading a coat of wet clay, dirt, and rubbish and allowing it to dry. The superior quality consists of a thick level of rub­bish (sherds, gravel, clay lumps, culinary refuse, ash) covered with a thin coat of clay forming a uniform, solid, and even surface. It seems that the depth of the floor below the modem surface has no perceptible influence on its preservation, since large sections of well-preserved floors have been encountered just a few centimeters below the ground. 
Vertical Differentiation. The vertical differentia­tion of living floors is illustrated by the presence of platforms and semisubterranean rooms. This vari­able, quantified as the total vertical distance between the highest and lowest contemporaneous floors of a unit, has been used by Shimada (1994) in Moche V Pampa Grande. It has been demonstrated to be asso-
' ciated with socioeconomic status (see also Donnan 
" 
1976:72). 
For all these variables the same pattern appears: the Public Patio Area emerges as the most finely con­structed, followed by AA #9 and AA #7 (Table 1 ). AA #6, AA #5, and AA #15 are clearly demarcated from the other ones, and are of lower construction quality. Other elements such as storage spaces and other distinctive architectural features indicate the same hierarchical sequence of Architectural Areas. They demonstrate the presence of differences in socioeconomic status on the urban landscape, which are reflected in the level of investment and degree of elaboration of house construction. 
In terms of architectural elaboration and invest­ment, it is necessary to realize that we are in the pres­ence of an intermediate category of Moche's population, reflecting a distinctive urban adaptation. None of the structures in this sample compare in elaboration to structures such as Topic's (1977) AA #2, or the Universidad de Trujillo's AA # 17, A #18, and AA #19 (Tello 1998), qualified as palaces or elite residences. Thus, the variability in this sample may not reflect a complete cross-section of urban architectural elements. Rather, I suggest that the vari­ability represents the mid-ranges of the urban socio­economic spectrum, an urban middle-class, so to speak. 
House Size and Distribution of Indexical Features 
Although the exact dimensions of Architectural Areas are at this point unknown, it is possible to extrapolate from excavated samples. Thus, AA #9 could measure some 600 square m (approximately 18 m by 33 m). It is conceivable that AA #7 has sim­ilar dimensions judging from its western alignment and its north-south length coterminous with dimen­sions from AA #9. AA #6 and AA #15, on the other hand, seem to be considerably smaller. Although one

mately 175 m. AA #15 has the same configuration: a small nucleus of rooms with evidence of domestic activities associated with a large space without divi­sions or prepared floors extending on the opposite side. The size of AA #5 is difficult to evaluate since we ignore it if the architecture on both its sides is connected or related. 
Some architectural elements can be considered prestigious because of their ritual, ceremonial, sym­bolic, or aesthetic aspects. These elements are often associated with sociopolitical power in Moche soci­ety. Topic (1977), for instance, excavated a room with a "step-motif' painted on one of the walls. Like­wise, the ZUM projects encountered some "unusual" features that may contribute to the analysis. Stairs, benches, elaborate doorways, platforms, ramps, and decorative elements are such features that give a sense of notability to architectural structures and dis­tinguish them from more modest dwellings. Not sur­prisingly, we encounter all these features in the sector composed of AA #7, AA #9, and the Public Patio Area. The only two features with broadly ideologi­cal undertones are found associated with the Public Patio: a plastered adobe "step-motif' located just northeast of it, and two parallel steps made of adobes laid out in a manner reminiscent of a common dual composition found in Moche iconography. The step­motif is a symbol frequently associated with ideo­logical power in much of the Andean world (Donnan 1976; Ladr6n 1942; Velarde 1939). 
Methodological Considerations 
This research relies primarily on architectural data. 
While excavating the upper stratigraphic levels of the site, it became evident that architecture was the only reliable indicator of the site's spatial organization. Occasionally, I will include discussion of the portable content, but due to extensive looting, little can be said with confidence abou room content and we can only 
assume or demonstrate primary deposits with diffi­culty. Nonarchitectural material will therefore not be systematically addressed but rather discussed in very general terms. In this respect, itis convenient to rely on architecture, one of the only artifact classes that has been consistently spared by huaqueros. As will be seen, nonportable artifacts and features provide adequate and fairly complete information on the phase of occupation under examination (see also Healan 1993:110). 
Another problem is our inability to be certain about the contemporaneity of the architectural struc­tures that form the sample. However, a number of elements lead me to believe that these Architectural Areas were in use at the same time. There is little reason to doubt that AA #7, AA #9, and the Public Patio Area were occupied at the same time, based on structural association. However, the main indicator of contemporaneity for AA #5, AA #6, and AA # 15 remains ceramic content, radiocarbon dates, and depth below the present desert floor. Many elements suggest that the spaces under scrutiny are contem­poraneous with one another. While they may not have been built at the same time, their respective periods of use certainly overlapped. 
The Adobes of the Urban Zone of the Moche Site 
This portion of the analysis addresses the essential building material on the Moche site: adobe bricks. Here I will attempt to show how recurring patterns in building material can indicate specific strategies

used in architectural projects. I suggest that the com­position of adobe walls reveals different construc­tion patterns for dwellings and specialized spaces, and that different material resources were used for their construction. 
Populations on the Peruvian Coast have used adobes, or sun-dried mud bricks, in one form or another in virtually every time period since the early stages of sedentism (McClelland 1986). Presently, scholars consider them to be rough chronological and cultural markers based on their shape (conical, loaf­shaped, rectangular) and technique of manufacture (mold-made, handmade) (Kolata 1982; McClelland 1986). The large-scale production of mold-made adobes in complex societies is infused with mean­ingful indications of labor organization. In Mesopotamia, Aurenche (1982:888) considers the use of molds to be an indicator of a priori planning involving a preconceived notion of architectural real­ization. Similarly, large-scale use of adobe bricks in construction projects evokes for Shimada ( 1994: 158) the exertion of elite power and labor mobilization. 
Hastings and Moseley (1975) have made a con­vincing case for corporate labor organization in the form of adobe brick manufacture in the construction process of the Moche huacas. In their model, outly­ing communities, households, or corporate groups would produce and lay out adobe bricks that bore their distinctive m!ker' s mark. This practice accounts for the characteristic cellular layout of Moche plat­forms. This economic pattern would be similar to the Inka mit'a labor-tax and is_often cited as its Early Intermediate Period analog (Moseley 1975). 
Extensive use of adobes may provide a first insight into state involvement in Moche domestic architec­ture. Indeed, it is conceivable that the urban zone's adobes were produced according to similar labor principles as those governing the construction of the massive Huacas del Sol and de la Luna. If this were so, we would expect to encounter similar shape and size variations in both contexts. However, data seem to indicate that this is not necessarily the case. Sum­mary comparison of this sample with measurements from monumental platforms in Pacatnamu (McClel­land 1986) and the Huaca del Sol (Hastings and Moseley 1975) indicates similar variability between domestic and monumental contexts. In fact, the range in brick size and coefficient of variation is greater for our domestic sample than for the two huacas (Van Gijseghem 1997). 
Most of the walls in any given Architectural Area exhibit an appreciable variation in brick size. Coef­ficients of variation in brick size within a single wall are commonly of the order of nine to 12 percent, which is similar to the coefficient of variation found in the sample as a whole. In other words, the varia­tion within a single wall is comparable to the overall range. This leads me to believe that in most instances, builders primarily reused adobes taken from other structures rather than series of "freshly-made" ones. Recycling ofbuilding material is a practice that I have witnessed in present-day construction projects while • in Peru. The presence of oxidized bricks (submitted to intense and sustained heat) in unlikely portions of more than a third of the walls analyzed only hints at the importance of this practice. 

There are a number of exceptions to this tendency of internal variation in brick size. For instance, the southeast wall of the Public Patio was built using very small bricks (24.88 cm on average), and these dimen­sions are uniform based on a small coefficient of variation (just above four percent). In a similar way, the north wall of the Public Patio was built using very large bricks, also uniformly distributed: 35.96 cm on average for a coefficient of variation of 4.83 percent. 
In these two cases that belong to the same Archi­tectural Area, it is reasonable to believe that adobes were made specifically for this task and in each instance with a single set of molds. Moreover, one of only three adobes bearing a maker's mark found in architectural context comes from a destroyed sec­tion of the west wall of the Public Patio. This rein­forces the idea that a distinct type of construction activity characterized this sector, different from the one found in residential units. 
Continuity and Change in the Organizational 
Dynamics of the Moche Site Inhabitants 

The structural arrangement of floors and walls may be used to understand the changes taking place throughout the lifetime of a house. Three Architec­tural Areas clearly demonstrate a lengthy occupa­tional history (AA #4, AA #7, and AA #9). In each of these cases, the reoccupation of space is articu­lated in a similar way: the older structures are used in the construction of the more recent ones. For instance, the walls of room 4-1 and the long peri­pheral wall of AA #7 were still in use, along with newer features, presumably several generations after their initial construction. During the lifetime of these

houses, the occupants repeatedly laid new floors over old ones, built new divisions, took down obsolete walls, and built annexes. However, the structural dynamics and occupational continuity remain largely uninterrupted and stratigraphically dense. Another example is one of the hearths of AA #9 that was built over an older one, thus preserving through time the room's function as a food-processing and cooking area. 
A second very distinct type of architectural pat­tern exists on the Moche site, which corresponds to a rather short occupation of domestic space. In this pattern, the building is dissociated spatially and strati­graphically from other architectural features. AA #5, AA #6, and AA # 15 are representative of this pat­tern. Accordingly, a test pit in AA #5 revealed older architecture underneath 1 m of windblown sediment. No underlying architecture was visible below AA #6 and AA #15, although excavation was finalized at the level of the base of the walls to verify the absence of older associated architecture. In each case these demonstrate a lower level of architectural elabora­tion and are composed of a small nucleus of habita­tion rooms associated with a large, presumably open-air area encircled by a wall. Ethnographic anal­ogy (Gillin 1973) suggests that such private court­yards may have been the loci of many daytime domestic activities. 
In other cases, as in the Public Patio and adjacent AA #I 3, the main occupation is structurally (and pre­sumably functionally) dissociated from older archi­tecture. Test excavations demonstrated this by revealing older levels of different configuration and construction style. It appears that the Public Patio was constructed directly over an architectural structure of a different nature (divisions are perceptible and domestic refuse underlies the patio). Complex strati­graphic superposition was also recorded below one of the storerooms on the south side of AA # 13. This phenomenon suggests that a sudden change in the function of that space occurred: from what appears to be a segmented domestic space to one associated with managerial, production, or ritual activities. We have already discussed the possible state investment in the construction of the Public Patio in the form of adobe brick production. 
Discussion: Household and Family at Moche 
In light of our observations ofMoche domestic archi­tecture, a certain number of inferences have been developed in this paper. A hierarchy in construction quality correlated with household size, on the one hand, and with organizational dynamics, on the other, characterized the Moche site during the latter part of the Moche IV phase. Higher-quality architecture, whose primary function presumably was not resi­dential, may be associated with Moche political and religious infrastructure. The public patio area andAA #9 represent a nucleus of higher-quality architecture 
(based on the available sample), an interpretation supported by their spatial proximity to Topic's (1977) AA #2 and AA #3, the highest-quality architecture thus far encountered on this part of the site. Also sup­porting this interpretation is the street aligned with the southern edge of the Huaca de la Luna and AA #8. This elaborate elite compound excavated by the Universidad Nacional de Trujillo (Chapdelaine et al. 1997; Tello 1998; Z(!valeta Paredes I 999) demon­strates the correlation among size, construction qual­ity, and architectural continuity. AA #7 belongs to this class of architectural elaboration, although its subsequent occupational levelsbscure the data. AA #5, AA #6, and AA #15 represent an inferior con­struction quality. 
It is generally recognized that the relative size of a dwelling is a rather reliable indicatorof both wealth (Netting 1982) and household size (Wilk and Rathje 1982). From this perspective, AA #6 and AA #15 appear as lower-status dwellings that may have housed only a small number of people-a nuclear family composed of four-to-six people may be approximated. However, AA #7 andAA #9, and pos­sibly the public patio area, judging by their size and important internal segmentation (formal and func­tional), may have housed larger groups, extended families, or associated nuclear families organized in corporate groups. These organizations would share kinship, residence, and occupation (see Manzanilla 1996; Widmer and Storey 1993 :90). The idea of struc­tures housing multifamily households is supported by the presence, in a limited sample of AA #9, of at least two contemporaneous hearths in different parts of the building, which may suggest two family groups, following the classic (but possibly flawed) one hearth/one nuclear family assumption (Manzanilla 1996:233; Wilk 1983). Excavations carried out after the present analysis uncovered a third hearth. Multi­ple hearths are consistent with other architectural indications of discrete subunits (wall abutments and circulation patterns). This spatial organization is rem-

iniscent of compound 38 in Moche V Pampa Grande (Shimada 1994:Fig. 7.29). According to Wilk and Rathje (1982) and Hirth (1993), the cohabitation of family groups implies a greater variety and com­plexity in the production and distribution of resources compared to smaller, single-family households. The presence of a burial platform accessible to the three subunits of AA #9 supports the argument for a kin­based affiliation between the residents (see Widmer and Storey [1993:97, 101] for similar arguments in Mesoamerica). 
Along with McGuire and Schiffer (1983) and Rathje (1983), we can link quality of construction with an effort in household permanence. I argue that a considerable amount of energy invested in con­struction of a domestic architectural unit reflects not only wealth (Abrams 1989; Healan 1993; Rathje 1983), but also a long-term intention toward perma­nence. Similarly, the less energy that is invested in construction (e.g., AA #5,AA #6, andAA #15) often reflects a fragile family structure, less durable eco­nomic alliances, and a higher frequency of post­marital neolocality (Blanton 1994, 1995). We will recall that AA #5, AA #6, and AA# 15 were built on previously unoccupied surfaces and were not reoc­cupied after abandonment (I suggested earlier that this could have occurred after one generation). These are features that we would expect from a neolocal residential pattenl In contrast, we are witnessing long occupational continuities inAA #4, AA #7, and AA #9. 
Strategies of Household Social Reproduction 

Material investment in dwellings is often aimed at cross-generational socioeconomic stability, part of a strategy called "household social reproduction," which can be defined as "the various strategies that household heads utilize to achieve and maintain desired social statuses for themselves and their off­spring" (Blanton 1994:19). The formation and evo­lution of complex cross-generational households have been documented as an effective economic strategy to achieve and maintain long-term socio­economic status (Freedman 1966; Goody 1972; Wilk 1983). Moreover, variations in household reproduc­tion strategies have been witnessed to co-vary with socioeconomic status (Bourdieu 1976). Similarly, for the Formative Period Basin of Mexico, Santley (1993:75-76) suggested that large households were able to command more long-term economic and political power than "junior nuclear families [who] budded off to found households of their own" (1993:75). 
In this archaeological context, the annex adjacent to AA #9 may represent a spatial expansion accom­modating one heir and his/her marriage partner and offspring: a pattern often referred to as the "stem fam­ily" (Segalen 1986). This is an expected result of extended family structure as a form of economic adaptation (Evans 1993: 176; Murdock 1965). Segalen (1986) attributes variations in the structure of coresidential groups to the organization of pro­duction and differential wealth. One heir is often chosen to take over the household and establishes res­idence with his/her parents. In a historical survey of peasant and urban societies, large multifamily groups often represent the "gentry" (the wealthier families), while poorer domestic groups often are the ones organized in smaller nuclear families (Bourdieu 1976; Goody 1990; Klapisch 1972; Segalen 1986). This pattern is consistent with that suggested here for the Moche site. It is also associated with high rates of postmarital mobility among poorer nuclear fam­ily households (Santley 1993:75) who invest less energy and resources in house construction, main­tenance, household burial, and ritual. Indeed, these features of household activity are absent in AA #5, AA#6, andAA#l5. 
Similar variability between socioeconomic classes in postmarriage household size and mobility in peasant communities has been documented for China (Fei 1946; Goody 1990), France (Bourdieu 1976; Segalen 1986), and Mesoamerica (Santley 1993; Wilk 1983, 1988). Fei mentions a few large Chinese houses "in which a large number of kin live together, but this is found only in the gentry" (1946:2). 
Most of these studies, however, are based on dif­ferential land ownership and patterns of inheritance in agrarian societies. There is no evidence of agri­cultural activity (or direct land tenure) at the Moche site. Being in an important corporate center, it is con­ceivable that we are in the presence of a "leisure class" (Goody 1990:96) composed of artisans (Uceda and Armas 1997) and holders of political and man­agerial office (see Topic 1977). The variability demonstrated with respect to this site does not nec­essarily apply to the whole ofMoche society, but may exemplify the dynamics of its urban "middle-class." Interestingly, one of the elite residences excavated

by Topic (1977, see also 1982) does not preclude the presence of nuclear families in the upper strata of Moche urban society. If this is correct, it would appear that an exclusively small proportion of the urban population (the aforementioned urban middle class) could have adopted cross-generational house­hold centralization as a specific strategy. Both the less wealthy and the most wealthy organized in nuclear family households. Shimada argues for the presence in Moche V Pampa Grande of such a middle-class in which social mobility could have been possible (1994: 178). Effective strategies for household repro­duction could have been one way to achieve or main­tain a higher status. 
Considering that pooling of resources appears as a significant factor in household centralization, I am compelled to agree with Blanton (1995) who sug­gests that ideology can also be an important acces­sory in household reproduction strategies. He demonstrated that a strong correlation exists between postmarital residence patterns and the canonical communication of the house embodied in "various material media in the house, including symbolically structured spatial organization, shrines, gender-spe­cific use of space" (Blanton 1995: 114 ). I will expand this definition to include functional segmentation of space (Healan 1993; Kent 1990) as exemplified in AA #7 andAA #9, which may contribute (like Blan­ton's shrines and liminal use of space) to a complex canonical communication, in essence analogous to Bourdieu's concept of habitus (1976). Vertical dif­ferentiation, discussed earlier, may act in a similar way. Emotional investment in household ritual also supports a strong strategy of social reproduction as seen in AA #9 and its burial platform, its possible shrine, and in the elaborate ceramic cache found in AA #7 (Chapdelaine 1998). Similarly, a human skull­cap found in a wall trench outside the southeastern comer of the annex built in AA #9 may indicate cer­emonies and offerings associated with house con­struction. Domestic burials were also found only in AA #9, AA #7, and in the public patio area. These architectural areas also had high proportions of ceramic figurines (Limoges 1999) and musical instruments (Chapdelaine 1998; Desjardins 2000) when compared to AA #5, AA #6, and AA # 15. 
According to Blanton (1994) we could expect to find a high incidence of exterior decorations on wealthier houses, composed of recognized status symbols. These would have the effect of legitimiz­ing the status of the occupant and communicating this status to the community. I am not sure, however, in which forms such elaboration should appear. Ceramic representations of elite architecture locate decorations primarily at the level of the roof that may not be recovered archaeologically. Yet, schol­ars working on an elite compound at the foot of the Huaca de la Luna in 1997 (Tello 1998) unearthed a large ceramic mace identical to the ones found on iconographic representations of elite architecture. 
As I suggested in the first part of this paper, it is also possible that indexical communication in Moche domestic architecture was partially achieved through the height and inclination of roof gables. While this remains hypothetical, the importance of gabled roofs on ceramic representations does lead me to suppose their symbolic relevance in communicating status. Tello (1998) interpret a small room with a central adobe post as a familial domestic shrine based on several lines of evidence. The adobe post in the cen­ter of the room is believed to have supported a dou­ble gabled roof. A very well-coflstructed, but badly looted, room on the south side of AA #9 had a sim­ilar adobe column in its center that may have served such a function. Because this room was completely looted, however, no evidence of its function as a shrine could be collected and the interpretation remains largely unsubstantiated, except through anal­ogy with the structure in AA #8 (Tello 1998). 
Three Architectural Variants 
At this point it is useful to summarize the variabil­ity of architectural elements found in our sample. I have suggested the existence of three distinct forms of construction patterns. The first type consists of dwellings represented by large, multifamily com­pounds, exhibiting superior construction quality. Yet, it is not as impressive as AA #2 excavated by Topic (1977), or as AA #8, AA #17, AA #18, or AA #19, excavated by a team from the Universidad Nacional de Trujillo. This type is characterized by long occu­pational continuity in room layout and general forms. Room functions are diverse and evidence exists for a variety of domestic activities including cooking and substantial storage. Most floors are composed of pre­pared clay, and walls are built using primarily recy­cled adobe bricks. Benches and platforms are numerous. Across generations, I suggest that the occupational continuity and the high investment in construction quality and domestic ritual reflect strate-

gies of household social reproduction. Household groups are possibly multigenerational, as offspring and relatives aggregate in a single compound. As Bourdieu points out: "here as elsewhere, wealth attracts wealth" (1976: 121). 
The second observable pattern consists of smaller, expediently built houses. They are composed of a node of domestic rooms where cooking, sleeping, limited storage, and general household activities may have taken place. A large open space lacking a pre­pared floor abuts the small rooms. These architec­tural areas demonstrate a short-lived occupation after construction, with neither prior nor subsequent peri­ods of use. Artifactual content is rather poor in num­ber and variety. These dwellings supposedly housed a single nuclear family and never grew into larger compounds (see Santley 1993 for a similar opinion in another context). I suggest that they represent a residential pattern unlike the previous type, charac­terized by considerable postmarital household mobil­ity, restricted power and status, and a narrow economic base. 
The third pattern is applicable to spaces that may or may not have housed individuals, but were cer­tainly part of a specialized infrastructure. It is rep­resented in our sample by the public patio area, which was built in a single event using building material produced specifically for this task, a phenomenon that was not encotmtered in strictly residential struc­tures. Its establishment may have resulted in reloca­tion of a segment of the resident population. Substantial storage spaces qre found there, and I sug­gest that only certain people had access to these spaces. Activities carried within the patio may have included craft or managerial tasks. Signs of Moche ideological and political power are imbued in some of its distinguishing elements, peculiarities of a kind that are absent from residential compounds of the previous type. While the public patio area does not directly teach us about variability in residence pat­terns, it allows us to appreciate other construction dynamics that helped shape the urban landscape. The evaluation of the relationships between this space and surrounding compounds and the assessment of its role as domestic or non-domestic will undoubtedly require more work. 
I agree with Bourdieu (1976) who warns us against simplistic and normative views of residence patterns in the social sciences. I believe that archae­ology still has a long way to go to fulfill the promises offered by studies of the household. Breaking out of this normative mold, recognizing the existence of systematic variation in household composition and change within communities appears to be a logical step. 

The postmarital residence patterns of the Moche urban dwellers are in any case difficult to reconstruct in all their intricacies. I suggest that the present framework does indeed contribute a great deal toward understanding architectural continuity through time and in explaining the divergent trends manifest' 
between the larger, richer, and smaller, poorer' dwellings on the Moche site. 
Conclusions 
There exists at Moche a clear variability in the size, level of internal segmentation, construction quality, and occupational continuity of houses. These ele­ments also have a tendency to covary. The larger dwellings housed extended families or polynuclear family households organized in corporate groups, pooling a variety of resources, and adapted to a wider set of production and distribution strategies. The smaller households would have relied on a narrower economic base and the contributions of a smaller number of participants. These smaller dwellings demonstrate, through their size, construction qual­ity, and short occupation, less permanence than the wealthier houses. This suggests less durable cross­generational kinship relations as well. The larger, wealthier households demonstrate a more effective permanence strategy from one generation to the next, clearer evidence for household ritual, and a higher level of integration in terms of membership. This translates into a more advantageous social repro­ductive strategy reflected in the transmission of a privileged socioeconomic status to one's offspring, resulting in the formation of extended, multigener­
ational households. 
Political agents who enforced rigid planning of the community also shaped the urban architectural fab­ric. The public patio area reflects such an investment in which we witness a sudden shift in the nature of the structure's occupation as well as signs of politi­cal involvement in the construction of that space. The dynamics of labor organization and supply of build­ing material, irrespective of the fact that the public patio area may or may not have housed individuals and families, were different from those of architec­tural areas of a more strictly residential nature.

I believe it to be important, from the perspective 
of an increasingly mature household archaeology, to 
conceive of households and settlements as dynamic, 
fluid entities (Evans 1993; Santley 1993; Wilk and 
Netting 1984). To understand household form and 
function, one must question the mechanisms through 
which they come to exist, change or remain stable 
over time, how they reproduce, and how these 
changes are manifest in the material record. 
Studying domestic architecture allows a privi­leged view of the dynamics that shaped and charac­terized past societies (Hermann 1994; Deetz 1982). Many lines of evidence must be sought in order to engage in a progressive discussion of those dynam­ics. My goal here has been to suggest that many ele­ments, seldom taken into account in the literature on household archaeology, might yield valuable infor­mation when approached jointly. Careful inspection of such features as wall abutments and architecture­based chronologies has provided data consistent with variations in social and economic conditions that are a part of daily life in a prehistoric state. 
I have underlined the variability present in the architecture of Moche's urban dwellers and tried to understand it in light of anthropological literature on residential patterns and socioeconomic correlates. I understand this exercise is fraught with difficulties of a kind inherent to archaeological interpretation. However, it is my hope that the foregoing statements will stimulate reflection on some of the more subtle socioeconomic aspects of this most fascinating com­plex society. After a century of research on Moche society and culture, archaeologists have only recently started investigating the less-glamorous aspects of north coast peoples. Many secondary communities and regional centers are presently under investiga­tion, and this research will provide comparative mate­rial for use in understanding the role of the eponymous center.
