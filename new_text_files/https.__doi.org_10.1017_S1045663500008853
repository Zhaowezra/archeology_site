For those teaching the archaeology of the Andes in Eng­lish, there are two strategies and two lineages of text­books. One line embeds the Andean region in a continental context, covering all of South American pre­history at one go. The first modem textbook in this line was Gordon R. Willey's 1971 An Introduction to Amer­ican Archaeology, vol. 2: South America; the most recent textbook is Jerry D. Moore's beautifully illustrated new book, A Prehistory of South America: Ancient Cultural Diversity on the Least Known Continent, 2014. The other approach (and the more popular one, based on my infor­mal survey) is to focus almost exclusively on the Central Andes, and in particular on Peru. While this reflects an exceptionalist perspective common among Central Andeanists, it is not wholly unjustified given both the richness of Central Andean prehistory (home to the Chavin, Wari, Tiwanaku, and Inca,just to name the hori­zon cultures) and the deep, wide, and intense tradition of doing archaeology there. With the growth of archae­ological research elsewhere on the continent, that may well change in the next few decades, but for now I expect that most courses on South America will continue to focus on the Central Andes. 
Although he now occupies Willey's old office, Jef­frey Quilter has opted to follow the latter tradition for his new textbook. This lineage began with Wendell C. Bennett and Junius B. Bird (Andean Culture History, 1949). New entries followed at irregular intervals: Edward P. Lanning's Peru before the Incas (1967),Luis 
G. Lumbreras's The Peoples and Cultures of Ancient Peru (l974),Michae1 E. Moseley's The Incas and Their Ancestors: The Archaeology of Peru (1992, revised 2001), and James B. Richardson III's People of the Andes ( 1994). It has been 20 years since the last truly new text, and Quilter's volume fills a growing void between the older books and the exponential growth of new information. The rapid pace of discovery over the last few decades responded in part to the defeat of Shin­ing Path in the early 1990s, which reopened the door for more intense foreign participation in Peruvian archaeology. Equally important were the establishment of multiple permanent and solidly funded Peruvian pro­
jects at a string of Moche sites on the north coast and at Late Preceramic sites in the Supe valley north of Lima, and the growth of cultural resource management archae­ology in Peru. Quilter is well situated to summarize this work, as he made major contributions to Late Preceramic 
archaeology in the 1980s and has worked on Moche 
matters in more recent years. These are not the only strengths of the book, however. Quilter is an old hand in the Andes and well connected to the research com­munity; The Ancient Central Andes is remarkably up to date. For instance, the chapter on the Early and Middle Preceramic periods includes Cuncaicha, the first site in the world to confirm Pleistocene occupation above 4 ,000 masl-and that site was published almost a year after the book. Of course, no text can be truly comprehensive, and no doubt some will be disappointed that their work did not make the cut. 
In 1949, Bennett and Bird set a pattern that subsequent texts have generally followed: placing Central Andean prehistory firmly in the physical context of geography, climate, environment, and resources (one of their three chapters was "The Setting"). Quilter is no exception. After an opening chapter on the history of archaeology and archaeological thought in the region, Chapter 2 addresses "Space, Time, and Form." Subsequent chapters follow chronological order. For the Preceramic periods, Quilter uses the now-common Early, Middle, and Late divisions that he was the first to systematize in 1991 (Journal of World Prehistory 5:387-438). He begins with the broader context (the only time the book leaves the Central Andes), then starts the trek through Central Andean prehistory with the earliest evidence of humans in the region, over 14,000 years ago. 
After the Preceramic periods, Quilter follows the Rowe scheme of horizons (periods of broad similarities in art sty Jes) and intermediate periods (times of intense regionalization). This is the chronological ordering still most frequently used by NorthAmericanAndeanists for the ceramic era. Each chapter offers broad coverage of important events and trends throughout the region. Although Quilter's Andean research has been exclusively on the coast, I do not see a coastal bias in his presentation of prehistory. 
Unlike some authors, Quilter puts the Late Horizon or Inca expansion last, in historical order. This seems a deliberate choice to build the patterns of Andean pre­history through time to their culmination with the Inca empire, rather than start with the Inca and explain ear­lier societies in terms of their relation to the last inde­pendent Andean state. Quilter ends his Late Horizon chapter with a brief run through the Colonial period to the present. 
One of my colleagues has already adopted this text for a course in Andean prehistory and it is working well. Quilter's writing is clear and serviceable, though not long on rhetorical flourishes. The organization is logical and the coverage is even and judiciously selected. I have two recommendations, should there be a future edition. First, the illustrations are inadequate. Each chapter has four or five black and white plates, often with multiple 
images at scales often too small to be useful. The sites,

settings, and objects of Central Andean prehistory are visually stunning, particularly in full color (as Richardson [1994] and Moore [2014] have demonstrated). Cost is a factor, but Routledge could surely manage a CD or a link to online images, if color in the book is prohibitive. Sec­ond, the most interesting chapter in the book is the final one, labeled "Afterword." In this chapter, Quilter draws together the threads of Andean prehistory developed throughout the text and makes many important observa­tions and interpretations. A more descriptive title (e.g., "The Patterns of Andean Prehistory") would help signal to users how important it is. These are minor quibbles, and I highly recommend The Ancient Central Andes for anyone teaching the topic. Based on past history, it will be a while before we see a more advanced text. 
Los Alfareros Golondrinos. Productores ltinerantes en las Andes. GABRIEL RAMON JOFFRE. 2013. IFEA Instituto Frances de estudios Andinos and Sequilao Edi­tores, Lima. 167 pp.PEN30.00 (paper),ISBN 978-9972­623-81-3.

In his latest book, Gabriel Ramon Joffre seeks to demon­strate the importance of seasonal migrant potters in the 
Andes and to offer directions to better identify their work 
in the archaeological records. His background in archae­
ology, colonial studies, and history allows him to offer 
a socio-historical and socio-political perspective of the potters' work, and a provocative critique of the state of ceramic data interpretation, the use of ethnographic anal­ogy, and the lack of attention given to utilitarian ware by Andean archaeologists. His criticisms of Andean archae­ology aim to show that the concept of itinerant potters is not considered (enough) in data interpretation. His style is dynamic, direct, and categorical. 
After introducing the book and geographical context, Ramon presents methodological considerations central to his argument: the problem of flawed ethnographic analogies; the necessity of revising the concept of pottery production based on the concept of technical style (which includes technological traits, forms, and decoration, cf. 
p. 45), place of manufacture, and distribution networks; the importance of inter-Andean variability of technical styles; and the danger of using local traits as generalities for a region. 
Ramon's criticism of the bad use of ethnographic analogy by Andean archaeologists is built on a 1938 arti­cle by Julio Tello (pp. 34--38), who used ethnographic accounts of utilitarian ware production to interpret elite data and draw generalities about ceramic production. 
This ongoing practice, says Ramon, leads to the homog­enization of the cultural panorama, instead of acknowl­edging diversity. 
Ramon probably knows the literature too well to ignore that, in 77 years, viewpoints have changed. Inter­est in domestic contexts and advances in the study of material remains with analytical technologies such as petrography, scanning electron microscopy, and chemical analysis, allow us now to look at ceramic production and distribution of utilitarian (and other) wares in a much more convincing manner. These analyses help distin­guish the nonlocal character of many plain wares. 
As for the lack of focus on utilitarian ware, Ramon forgets publications like those of Tellenbach or Ulbert, who analyzed ceramics from the Formative site of Mon­tegrande, which are mostly utilitarian.Also, the ceramic studies edited by Izumi Shimada ( 1994 Tecnolog{a y organizaci6n de la producci6n de cerdmica prehispdnica en las Andes) do not all deal with elite ware, while other studies recognize the difference between elite, ceremo­nial, and utilitarian ware productions (e.g., the works of Chapdelaine and colleagues on Moche ceramic produc­tion, or Stovel in San Pedro de Atacama). 
In addition, local wares are now more regularly dis­tinguished from foreign productions based on character­ization studies and comparison with geological data and comparative materials-ethnographic or not-contrary to what Ramon says (note 26, p. 46). Finally, the chaine operatoire and technical styles might be concepts emerg­ing in Peru but commonly used in Argentina or Chile (e.g., the works of De la Fuente, Drue, Falabella, Ghezzi, Hayashida, Lopez, Makowski, Masucci, Paez, Puente, 
Roddick, Vaughn, Williams, and their colleagues). 
In Chapter 4, Ramon defines golondrinos as migrant workers, delineates their seasonal schedule and travel habits, and presents the useful concepts of village base (pueblo base) and destination village (pueblo destino) 
(p. 52). In Chapter 5, he reviews some notions about exchange of products and circulation of pots, offers a potters' typology, and describes in more detail the routes, destination, work, and categories of itinerant potters, with ad hoc examples. From a pool of case studies, without mentioning prior interviews of some of the potters he investigates or offering a detailed lit­erature review, Ramon extracts recurrences to help iden­tify the presence of itinerant potters and to support his model of local and nonlocal productions of domestic ware. In Chapter 6, Ramon offers a synthesis of the observations and cases previously presented in an analysis of the geography of techniques, dynamic of the chaine operatoire, and itineraries of golondrinos. The tendencies he observes in technical styles, raw materials, and ware production are pointers to help rec­ognize the work of itinerant potters. Ramon also high-
