CHILDHOOD LOST: ABDUCTIONS, SACRIFICE, AND TROPHY HEADS OF CHILDREN IN THE WARI EMPIRE OF THE ANCIENT ANDES 
Tiffiny A. Tung and Kelly J. Knudson 
This study examines isolated child skeletal remains from ritual structures at the Wari site of Conchopata (A.D. 600-1000) to evaluate how they were modified into trophy heads and whether the children were sacrificed. The skeletal remains rep­resent at least seven children. Strontium isotope ratios are examined to determine whether children were taken from foreign locales. Results show that the children's skulls exhibit a hole on the apex of the cranium and on the ascending ramus of the mandible, identical to the adult Wari trophy heads. At least one child may have been sacrificed. 87Sr/i6Sr demonstrate that two of the four sampled child trophy heads were nonlocal, suggesting that children were occasionally abducted from dis­tant communities, perhaps for sacrifice and certainly to transform some into trophy heads. The similar child and adult tro­phy heads suggest that the ritual treatment of children was not uniquely designed, at least as it related to their processing. display, and destruction. Furthermore, it is suggested that the child trophy heads were not simply passive symbols of pre­existing authority by the head-takers and trophy head-makers. The trophy heads simultaneously imbued those agents with authority-they did not merely reflect it-demonstrating the "effective agency" of the trophy head objects themselves. Finally, we suggest that prisoner-taking and trophy head-making by military and ritual elites served to legitimate the authority of those individuals while simultaneously serving larger state goals that enhanced Wari state authority and legitimated its policies and practices. 
Este estudio examina 6seos humanos incorp6reos de varios nifios provenientes de estructuras rituales en un sitio de afiliaci6n Wari (d.C. 600-1000)-Conchopata-para evaluar si fueron modificados como cabezas trofeos y si fueron sacrificados. Los restos 6seos representan por lo menos siete nifios. Ademds, se analizan las proporciones de isotopos de estroncio para aclarar si estuvieron raptados desde regiones afuera de! centro de! imperio Wari. Observaciones de perforaciones en los dpices de Los crdneos de Los nifios indican que fueron cabezas trofeos. 87Sr/i6Sr demuestra que dos cabezas trofeos de nifios eran extran­jeros. Esto sugiere que los guerreros de Wari capturaron nifios, como hicieron a Los adultos prisioneros. Las similitudes entre las cabezas trofeos de nifios y adultos, indican que el tratamiento ritual de los nifios no Jue unico o especial en su disefio, a menos que se relaciona su procesamiento, exposici6n, y destrucci6n dentro de las estructuras rituales. Ademds, se sugiere que las cabezas trofeos de los nifios no fueron sfmbolos pasivos de una autoridad pre-existente de sus captores y fabricadores. Las cabezas trofeos simultdneamente imbuyeron esos agentes con autoridad-no la reflejaron simplemente. En este sentido, las cabezas trofeos tuvieron una "agencia efectiva" dentro de sus contextos de obtenci6n, fabricaci6n, y utilizaci6n. Finalmente, sugerimos que la captura y fabricaci6n de cabezas trofeos por la elite militar y ritual legitimizaron su autoridad, a la vez sirviendo metas mds amplias del estado que aumentaron su autoridad y legitimizaron sus principios y prdcticas.

together with grave goods highly reminiscent of a capacocha offering (Andrushko et al. 2008; Gibaja et al. 2005); this demonstrates that these Inka child sacrifices were not limited to mountaintops. Other Andean groups have been suspected of practicing child sacrifice, such as the Moche (A.D. I 00-700) on the north coast of Peru where skele­tons from three children, two of which were head­less, were recovered from a ritual plaza at Huaca de la Luna (Bourget 2001). These child skeletons were recovered from the same plaza as numerous sacrificed adult males (Verano 200 l a). However, because there was no osteological evidence among the child burials for the mechanism of death (e.g., perimortem fractures, cutmarks, or chopmarks), it is unclear if they were sacrificed or died natural deaths (Bourget 2001). Recent research at the late Middle Horizon/early Late Intermediate Period site of Santa Rita B in the Chao Valley has uncovered additional examples of possible child sacrifice; three subadults (two 10-12­year olds and a 13-15 year-old girl) were appar­ently sacrificed and interred with two principal burials (a 7-year-old child and an adult male) (Gaither et al. 2008). Although the subadult sacri­fices exhibit no perimortem trauma, the context and burial orientation led the authors to suggest they are retainer sacrifices (Gaither et al. 2008), not dis­similar to the child retainer sacrifices documented at the Middle Sican site of Huaca Loro (Shimada et al. 2004). In short, while there is clear evidence of child sacrifice among the Inka and compelling evidence for it among pre-Inka cultural groups in the northern Peruvian Andes and coast, it remains unclear if other pre-Inka groups practiced child sacrifice. The dearth of data on child sacrifice among pre­Inka groups is paralleled by limited information on 
; child trophy heads. This lack of information has 
made inquiries into the practice of child head-taking and its possible relationship to child sacrifice dif­ficult to address. In tum, scholarly inquiries regard­ing the role that children played in prehispanic rituals have been limited, a void that inhibits our ability to characterize how ritual activities affected the lives of individuals of all ages. A focused study of children's bones from ritual structures provides a direct means to evaluate if children were sacri­ficed, how their remains were made into trophies, and from where they were obtained. These data also afford insights into how children were integrated into ritual life and how they may have been per­ceived in prehispanic Andean society. 
In this study, we evaluate whether the Wari empire (A.D. 600-1000) in particular engaged in any of these practices. The notion that the Wari may have done so stems from new trophy head finds at the Wari site of Conchopata (Tung 2008), and from what is known of other prehispanic Andean soci­eties. For example, the Inka practiced child sacri­fice, and it has been proposed that some of their cultural practices and aspects of statecraft derived from the Wari (Earle 1997; Schreiber 1992). Also, because studies of Nasca trophy heads (A.D. 1-600) and associated iconography provide com­pelling evidence that adults and an occasional child were likely captured for the purpose of ritual sac­rifice and transformation into trophy heads (Proulx 2001), it is possible that a subsequent polity in a neighboring region (i.e., the Wari in the Ayacucho Basin) conducted similar activities (Figure 1 ). Moreover, Nasca-derived iconography in much of Wari art indicates that the Nasca polity strongly influenced Wari material culture (Cook 1994; Men­zel 1964 ). Therefore, it would not be surprising if Nasca ritual practices also permeated Wari society. Finally, the possibility that children were sacrificed and transformed into trophy heads in Wari society finds precedent in the apparent evidence that the Wari Empire sacrificed adults and transformed them into trophy heads (Tung 2007a). 
Much of what is known about Andean trophy heads derives from iconographic and osteological studies of the Nasca (Browne et al. 1993; Proulx 2001; Silverman 1993; Silverman and Proulx 2002; Verano 1995). Detailed osteological study of Nasca trophy heads has identified their defining charac­teristics, such as an intentionally enlarged foramen magnum to extract the brain and an intentionally drilled hole on the anterior of the frontal bone (Ver­ano 1995). Carrying cords are often still in place in many of the Nasca trophy heads, demonstrating that they were carried and displayed. 
To evaluate whether Wari did indeed make tro­phies out of children's heads and practice child sac­rifice, seven isolated children's skulls from two ritual spaces at the Wari site of Conchopata were reconstructed and analyzed. (They are clearly iden­tified as the remains of children, not dwarf indi­viduals, as has been previously suggested

[Ochatoma and Cabrera 2002]). These children's adult trophy heads, who may have been sacrifice skeletal remains are ideal to address these issues victims (Cook 2001; Tung 2007a). That these because they were excavated from the same ritual uniquely shaped buildings are ritual in nature is spaces-circular and D-shaped rooms-as the indicated not only by their architectural design, but

also by the presence of sacrificed camelids and intentionally smashed ceramic urns that had been beautifully decorated with images of Wari deities and elaborately dressed warriors (Ochatoma 2007; Ochatoma and Cabrera 2002). 
The Wari Empire 
The Middle Horizon (AD. 600-1000) in the Peru­vian Andes was initiated by various changes in art, architecture, and sociopolitical organization that reached nearly all parts of the Andes. These pan­Andean changes stemmed from two major cultural centers: Tiwanaku in the southern Andes of modern-day Bolivia, and the capital site of Huari in central highland Peru (Isbell 1987) (Figure 1 ). Wari influence was more geographically wide­spread than that of Tiwanaku, as evident in the wider distribution of Wari architecture that mim­ics forms from the capital site of Huari (Isbell 1984, 1991; Isbell et al. 1991). This style, known as the "orthogonal cellular architecture horizon," in addi­tion to the D-shaped ritual buildings (Isbell 1991 ), appear at numerous sites in the Peruvian Andes (Anders 1991; Feldman 1989; Isbell 1989, 1991; McEwan 1991; Moseley et al. 1991; Schreiber 1992; Williams 200 l) (Figure 1 ). In particular, Azangaro (Anders 1991) and Jincamocco (Schreiber 1992), located on the fringes of the Wari heartland, display Wari architecture, as do more dis­tant sites such as Viracochapampa and Honco­pampa in northern Peru (Isbell 1989; Topic 1991), Pikillacta near Cuzco (McEwan 1991), and Cerro Baul in southern Peru (Feldman 1989; Moseley et al. 1991; Williams 2001 ). There are also numerous Middle Horizon sites that have Wari ceramics and textiles intrusive to the local style, illustrating the extent of Wari influence (Cardona Rosas 2002; _Cook 1994; Cook and Glowacki 2003; Menzel 

; 1964, 1968; Nash and Barrionuevo 2009; Owen 2007; Schreiber 1992; Stone-Miller and McEwan 1990; Tung 2007c). 
This widespread influence and control in par­ticular parts of the Andes may have succeeded through religious indoctrination (Cook 1994, 200 l; Menzel 1964), commensal feasting and drinking (CookandGlowacki2003; Isbell 1984, 1987,2007; Williams and Nash 2005), and/or military cam­paigns (Feldman 1989; Lumbreras 1974).But rather than viewing these as mutually exclusive means to rule, we see the various evidence as an indication that Wari political leaders were savvy in their imple­mentation of different strategies in distinct places, and in how they negotiated with local elites. 
While there is compelling evidence for these various strategies of rule (Feldman 1989; Isbell 1984, 2007; Lumbreras 1974; Menzel 1964; Williams and Nash 2005), evidence from the impe­rial heartland suggests that military might, or the threat thereof, as well as ritual authority, were par­ticularly prominent. These are apparent in icono­graphic depictions of Wari warriors carrying weapons and trophy heads and Wari deities hold­ing prisoners and trophy heads. Notably, these images appear on large, state-produced ceramic urns, some of which are a meter in diameter (Ochatoma and Cabrera 2002). The "official" cou­pling of images of warriors, captives, and trophy heads strongly suggests that activities involving them are interrelated. Further evidence of military conflict, or violent unrest more generally, is seen in adult cranial trauma rates that average about 25 percent among those from Conchopata and other Wari affiliated sites in the Majes valley of south­ern Peru (Tung 2007b ). 
The establishment ofWari ritual authority in the heartland and hinterland is evidenced by the wide distribution of D-shaped ritual structures, some of which contained ritually smashed ceramic vessels and sacrificed camelids (Bragayrac 1991; Cook 2001; Isbell and Cook 2002; Ochatoma and Cabr­era 2002; Williams 2001 ). The display and destruc­tion of adult human trophy heads in ritual buildings was another significant part of establishing this rit­ual authority. This is apparent at the site of Con­chopata, the secondary site in the Wari heartland (Isbell and Cook 2002), where 24 adult trophy heads were found burned and smashed on the floors of two ritual structures (EA 72 and EA 14 3 ). Fifteen of the 16 adult crania whose sex could be deter­mined were male (94 percent), and eight of the 19 adult trophy heads (42 percent) exhibited cranial trauma (one perimortem and seven antemortem fractures) (Tung 2008). Moreover, strontium iso­tope ratios obtained from local burials and a sub­sample of adult trophy heads indicate that a majority of the adult trophy head victims came from a geographical locale outside of the Ayacu­cho Basin (Tung and Knudson 2008). Together, the demographic, trauma, and chemical data suggest

that adults who were transformed into trophy heads may have been victims of raids, many of whom may have been nonlocal enemies of the Wari state. This is further supported by ceramic iconography show­ing Wari deities controlling bound prisoners and holding trophy heads, as well as images of warriors wearing trophy heads around their necks (Isbell and Cook 2002; Ochatoma and Cabrera 2002). 
Expectations: Taking Child Captives and 
Documenting Sacrifice 

Childskulls that display the same postmortem mod­ifications as adult trophy heads will be identified as trophy heads. Such modifications include an intentionally drilled hole on the apex of the cranium and the ascending ramus of the mandible. To deter­mine whether the bodies of children received sim­ilar ritual treatment as those of adults, juvenile remains were inventoried to see if the same adult skeletal elements (i.e., crania, mandibles, and hand phalanges) were present among the juvenile bones. The skeletal elements were then examined for cut­marks, chopmarks, and burning. If adults and chil­dren are represented by the same skeletal elements that show similar modifications, it will be suggested that both age groups were similarly integrated into Wari rituals. 
The knowledge that the Inka practiced child sac­rifice contributes to the supposition that preceding Andean groups also engaged in this practice, but evidence for skeletal trauma that is consistent with intentional killing would further support the hypothesis. For example, cutmarks or chopmarks on the cervical vertebrae, the inferior edge of the occipital, and/or the posterior edge of the mandible may suggest lethal decapitation (Angel and Cald­well 1984; Waldron 1996), while a perimortem fracture on a cervical vertebra may suggest a bro­ken neck that could have been fatal (Angel and Caldwell 1984 ). Because the cutrnarks, chopmarks, and perimortem fracture could also result from postmortem processing for burial, the osteological data must be evaluated with information on the archaeological context and more general knowl­edge about sacrifice in the Andes. 
The question regarding whether local or foreign children were taken captive, sacrificially killed, and then transformed into trophy heads is crucial to examine, for these insights reveal much about Wari imperial strategies for the subjugation and integra­tion of "outsider " polities. To estimate if children from these ritual structures were from the Wari heartland or some distant geological locale, we obtained strontium isotope ratios from four of the seven children, and compared those to the expected strontium isotope value for the Ayacucho Basin (Wari imperial core) (Tung and Knudson 2008). We hypothesize that, like the adult trophy heads from the ritual structures at Conchopata, one or more child trophy heads will exhibit a nonlocal strontium isotope value, suggesting that, on occasion, chil­dren (or just their heads and hands) were taken cap­tive and brought back to Conchopata for possible sacrifice and transformation into trophies. 

Materials and Methods 
The skeletal remains analyzed in this study include hand phalanges, cervical vertebrae, and cranial and mandibular parts representing at least seven chil­dren. The child skeletal remains do not derive from mortuary spaces, so the bone modifications described below (e.g., cutmarks, chopmarks) are unlikely related to burial treatment. Three chil­dren's skulls are from the D-shaped ritual room (EA72) and four are from the circular ritual room (EA143); both spaces measured 11 min diameter (Figure 2). Because the human remains were smashed and commingled on the floors of the rit­ual rooms, some crania could not be affiliated with their mandibles. 
Each cluster of human bone from the floor of EA143 was photographed, mapped, and assigned a numerical code while in situ (Isbell and Cook 2002). In most cases, a cluster of skull fragments pertained to one individual. However, in other cases one skull could be dispersed among several bone piles. For this reason, alphabetical lab codes were assigned that identified each particular individual. (See Table 1 for listing of the child skeletal remains that are present for each juvenile.) Spatial and strati­graphic relationships could not be examined for cra­nia from EA 72, as there are no detailed maps or sketches showing them in situ, though field pho­tographs do show the skulls clustered together.

All juvenile skeletal elements were observed with a lOx handheld magnifying lens for modifi­cations such as drilled holes, cutmarks, chopmarks, and burning. They were also observed for ante-and perimortem trauma, and cribra orbitalia (an indi­cator of physiological stress) was observed when orbital roofs were present. 
All tooth and bone samples were prepared in the Archaeological Chemistry Laboratory at Arizona State University.

Cranium 4 (C4) included skull fragments from a child (Tr-P) and an adult (Tr-D, visible in photo but not discussed in this article). Skull fragments from Tr-P were below and immediately east of Tr-D. (Photos courtesy of William Isbell.) 
Of the four child crania from EA143, two had skull parts scattered among several different clus­ters. Trophy Head H (Tr-H) was scattered among Cranial Clusters 14 and 15, and Tr-P was dispersed among Cranial Clusters 4 and 13 (Figures 3 and 4). Tr-A was from skeletal remains in Cranial Cluster 
I only, and Tr-S was from Cranial Cluster 19 only (Figure 3). Cranial Clusters 12 and 18 also had some juvenile bone fragments, but they could have belonged to any one of the other child skulls; there­fore, they could not be added to the MNI estimate. 
It is unknown if the dispersion of child skeletal parts occurred during the process of the ritual, or if they were separated after ritual activities had ceased. 
Age-at-Death 
Three of the four children in the circular ritual struc­ture were 3 to 8 years old at the time of death. The fourth child in that room was 4 to 11 years old. The three children in the D-shaped ritual space were not as well preserved, but based on cranial size and

thickness, each was identified as 3 to I 2 years old (Table 1). 
Modifications: Drilled Holes, Cutmarks, Chop­marks, and Burning 
Among the four juvenile crania with an observable calotte, all show a hole at bregma, on the apex of the cranium (Figure 5), and of the two mandibles observed, one exhibited a hole on both the left and right ascending ramus (Table 1, Figure 6). Because the locations of these intentionally drilled holes mirror those on the adult trophy heads, these child remains are identified as trophy heads. 
Of the three child mandibles preserved well enough to observe for cutmarks, all exhibited them on the posterior edge of the ascending ramus, mod­ifications that mirror those of the adult trophy heads (Table 1, Figure 7). Cutmarks were also observed on the temporal bone of EA I43-Tr-P, superior to the external auditory meatus (Figure 8). Of the nine child hand phalanges, only four were sufficiently pre­served to observe for cutmarks; none were affected. Nevertheless, the mere presence of isolated pha­langes from children's hands suggests that their fin­gers were ritual objects used in conjunction with the trophy heads, as was done with heads and fingers from adults (Figure 9). No cutmarks were observed on any of the three child cervical vertebrae. 
One of three mandibles (EA 14 3-Tr-P) displayed chopmarks on the inferior-posterior edge of the ascending ramus (Figure 7), a feature often observed on individuals that have been beheaded from behind (Waldron 1996). When a sharp-edged instrument strikes the neck from behind, the blade often makes contact with the inferior comer of the lower jaw, resulting in observable chopmarks, like those on Tr-P. 
Several of the child trophy heads were burned at high temperatures, as evidenced by their light gray color and vitrification. The Conchopata adult trophy heads were similarly vitrified; they sound similar to clinking glass when tapped together (Tung 2008). The color of the bones suggests that the heads were burned at temperatures of at least 800° C (if burned for about three hours surrounded either by air or topsoil), or as high as 1000° C (if burned for one hour surrounded by topsoil) (Walker et al. 2008). Although the duration of burning is unknown, it appears that the bones were burned at temperatures slightly lower than would have been

Disease 
Cribra orbitalia was observed on one of the four child trophy heads (25 percent), which suggests that the affected individual may have suffered from ane­mia (Ortner et al. 2001; Stuart-Macadam 1987; Walker 1986; Walker et al. 2009) or inflammation caused by a dental abscess, sinusitis, or other naso­oral infections (Wapler et al. 2004). ln short, those lesions indicate general physiological stress among a quarter of the children that were made into tro­phy heads. In contrast, only five percent (N = 19) of children that received proper burial in a Con­chopata tomb suffered from similar biological stres­sors. However, the difference is not statistically significant (Fisher's exact, p = .324, N = 23).

There were four calottes, two frontal bones, two partial facial areas, four partial mandibles, three cer­vical vertebrae, and eight hand phalanges, none of which exhibited antemortem trauma (i.e., healed fractures). Thus, it appears that these children did not suffer from injury earlier in their childhoods. 
All juvenile elements were examined for peri­mortem trauma (i.e., injuries that occur around the time of death). A perimortem fracture was observed on the lamina of a cervical vertebra from EA143­Tr-P (Figure 10), the same child that showed chop­marks on the mandibular ascending ramus. The affected vertebra is either cervical vertebra 4, 5, 6, or 7. The angle of the break and the homogenous color of the broken edge and the surrounding bone indicate that the fracture was perirnortem, not post­mortem.

Strontium Isotope Ratios 
Strontium isotope ratios were obtained from bone from four children (five samples total): EA 1 43­Tr-A cranial fragment 87Sr/86Sr = .71013; EA143­Tr-H hand phalanx 87Sr/86Sr = . 71601 ; EA 14 3-Tr-P cranial fragment 87Sr/86Sr = .70613; EA-143-Tr-P vertebral fragment 87Sr/86Sr .70607 (the cranial

Discussion 
Child Trophy Heads in the Wari Empire 
The seven child trophy heads represent 23 percent of the entire trophy head sample recovered from Conchopata (7/31 23 percent), whereas only 7

The significantly higher frequency of child tro­phy heads at Conchopata is striking, and it may sug­gest that children were intentionally sought for this ritual program. The children's heads represent more than a couple of eccentric specimens; they seem to be a common and integral part of these elaborate 
Wari rituals, where the child trophy heads are inte­grated with those from adults. Perhaps the Wati community (or ritual specialists or other elites with decision-making power within the larger commu-
