Every student of Maya archaeology learns that archae­ologicalresearchatthesiteofTikal,Guatemala,helpedrevolutionizearchaeologyinthe1950sand1960s.Tikalbecame a test case for innovation in the archaeology ofsettlement patterns, environmental interaction, andurbanism. It is rewarding that Tikal once again is thecenter of innovation in archaeology. David Lentz,Nicholas Dunning, and Vernon Scarborough’s editedvolume Tikal: Paleoecology of an Ancient Maya Cityrepresents an outstanding contribution to the social sci­ences and providesa serious example of effectiveinter­disciplinary research in archaeology.
As laid out by Dunning, Lentz, and Scarborough inthefirstchapter,theinterdisciplinaryresearchfeaturedinTikaladdressesaseriesofproblemson:(1)theimpactofagroforestryacrossthehistoryofthesite,(2)thepoliticalecology of water management; (3) the significance ofwetlands (bajos); and (4) the relationship betweenhydraulicinfrastructureandanarrayofurbanservices(p.4).TheprojectwasorganizedbytheUniversityofCincin­nati, wherethe threeeditorsresideinthedepartmentsofAnthropology,Biology,and Geography.Theirintroduc­tory chapter situates their investigation within the envi­ronmental and archaeological history of Tikal and theMaya Lowlands. The subsequent chapters present theresultsoftwofieldseasonsandseveralyearsofanalysis.

Weaver and colleagues use the dig­itized maps to estimate hydrological patterns and therole of the built environment in water management.
The following three chapters bring us back again tointerdisciplinary assessments of ecological interactionandchange.Chapter6,byDunningandcolleagues,inte­grates geoarchaeological and palynological data toexaminetheroleofwetlands,suchasbajosandaguadas,in the Tikal agro­ecosystem.

They document a socio­eco­logical system with considerable longevity but alsoreveal its increasing vulnerability over time.
Most of the chapters focus either on the built land­scape or on ecological data of human­environmentalinteraction. Buttles and colleagues, however, provide adetailed report of material culture in Chapter 11. They describeflakedandgroundstoneartifacts,boneandshellimplements, and ceramics and classify them accordingto different behavioral categories. Chapters 10 byWeb­sterandMurthaand12byBeachandcolleaguesprovidecomparative perspectives to the research conducted bytheUniversityofCincinnatiproject.WebsterandMurtha,whohaveconductedindependentresearchatTikal,offeralong­termnarrativeofdemographicchangethatstressesunintended consequences of surplus production andpolitical competition.
