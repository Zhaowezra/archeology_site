THE INTRODUCTION OF WHEAT IN MENDOZA, ARGENTINA 
DURING THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY A.D.: 
ARCHAEOBOTANICAL EVIDENCE 

Carina Llano and Victor Duran 
During the colonial era, southern Mendoza, Argentina, functioned as a frontier where indigenous and Spanish-speaking people interacted. Contact caused major transformations to indigenous economic, social, and political organization.Archae­ological analysis is fundamental to understanding the characteristics of local indigenous populations that rapidly incor­porated European products into their diets. Analysis of archaeological remains from the region, therefore, can cast light on important aspects of Spanish-indigenous interactions. The aim of this work is to describe the archaeobotanical record of Cueva de Luna-located in the Rfo Grande Valley and containing occupations dated between ca. 3800 B.P. and European contact-and to understand how plants were exploited by the inhabitants of southern Mendoza. Preliminary analysis of the archaeobotanical record, consisting primarily of seeds and woody endocarps in a dry state of preservation, indicates the use of native wild taxa, among which algarrobo (Prosopis sp.), molle (Schinus polygamus), solupe (Ephedra), and jarilla (Larrea nitida) abound. American cultivars including beans (Phaseolus vulgaris) are also present. Sifinificantly, the record includes Eurasian taxa, including wheat (Triticum sp.) and walnut tree (Juglans sp.). The Cueva de Luna record is important in this ref(ard for it may correspond to the nineteenth century, when the area was inhabited by what may have been the last indigenous Pehuenche group preceding the current ranchers. Our results provide a basis for future work related to change and continuity in the prehistoric use of plants.

Recent archaeological studies carried out in southern Mendoza, Argentina, show that wild plants, particularly algarrobo (mesquite) and molle (peppertree), were important for the survival of hunting and gathering populations (Llano 2011 ). Nonetheless, contact between indigenous groups and Spanish colonizers resulted in the exchange of cultivated plant species (Capparelli et al. 2005). The most credible archaeological evi­dence confirming the concurrent use of wild native species and Eurasian cultivars is provided by the archaeological site of Cueva de Luna, located in the middle Rfo Grande basin, Mendoza, Argentina (Duran 1999; Llano 2011). 
Prior to our excavations, limited information was available on human habitation in the area before the nineteenth century. The only systematic archaeological studies were Gambier's (1980, 1985, 1987) publications about the site of Gruta El Manzano, together with Schobinger's and Gradin 's work on rock art (Schobinger 1978; Schobinger and Gradin 1985). Subsequently, Duran's (1991-1992, 1993-1994, 1999, 2004) his­torical and archaeological investigations demon­strated the existence in the Rfo Grande Valley of exchange networks between different indigenous groups and Spanish-speaking people. The tempo­ral sequence at Cueva de Luna is presented in Table l, which summarizes Duran's (2004) five­component sequence built on radiocarbon dates, changes in lithic technology, and other chrono­logical indicators. 
The aim of this work is to present the archae­ological record of Cueva de Luna, with special emphasis on identifying changes or continuities in the use of plant species. We also assess the spread of wheat in the study region based on eth­nohistorical information (Baez 1948, 1949) and the exhaustive analysis of plant macro-remains from Cueva de Luna carried out by Capparelli et al. (2005). We see the recovery of wheat and wild plant species from a single site, as documented here, as an important contribution for the follow­ing reasons: (1) it provides archaeological evi­dence of the spread of Old World plants in South America; (2) the context suggests that these remains date to the late Holocene; and (3) the plant macro-remains, together with other archae­ological evidence, indicate exchange between Spanish-speaking and indigenous populations. 
Brief Outline of the Culture History of 
Northwestern Argentina 

Archaeological evidence from the Gruta de! Indio site (Garcfa 200 3; Garcia and Lagiglia 1999; Neme and Gil 2008) indicates that the exploration and colonization of southern Mendoza began dur­ing the Late Pleistocene or at the beginning of the Early Holocene, ca. 11,000 B .P. Toward the begin­ning of the Middle Holocene (ca. 8000-7000 B .P.), the number of sites and density of associated materials increase (Gil et al. 2005). Regional occupation appears to change dramatically between approximately 7000 and 4000 B.P.: archaeological evidence decreases and, in some cases, disappears completely (Gil et al. 2005). This trend seems to be mirrored in a number of regions across the South American continent (Nunez and Grosjean 1994; Zarate et al. 2005). At the beginning of the Late Holocene, between 3800 and 3200 B .P., archaeological deposits reap-

Table 2. Summary of the Different Domains of the Microenvironment Adjacent to the Archaeological Site. 
Descri tion 
Morphology  The archaeological site is located on a basalt formation that, having eroded, has created a series of  
canyons with hollows and caves.  
Soil  Soils are generally fine, stony or sandy, and poor in organic matter.  
Vegetation Types  Psammophilous steppes, halophyte plants, and vegas.  
Climate  Dominant arid climate. Air masses from the Pacific anticyclone unload heavy snowfall during winter  
in the mountains and weaker summer rains in the eastern highlands.  
Land use  The native flora and fauna arn currently depleted and under severe stress, given that the area has been  
farmed for more than 200  and oil extraction has been carried out for over 50  

pear in almost all regions. In all these areas, grow­ing human occupation of the land is signaled by an increase in the number and size of archaeolog­ical sites, especially toward the middle of the Late Holocene. Between 2000 and 1500 B.P. the col­onization process spreads over the most marginal zones, including the desert of La Payunia and the mountainous zone above 2,700 m asl (Neme and Gil 2008). In some of these areas, cultivated plants such as corn and squash are introduced at this time (Llano 2011). 
The analysis of ethnohistorical documents indicates that around the second half of the six­teenth century the region was inhabited by nomadic groups with a hunting-based economy. There is also evidence that these groups practiced exchange with the western side of the Andes, which resulted in access to Chilean agricultural products (Duran 2004). This trade relationship was so well established during the seventeenth century that hunter-gatherer groups inhabiting the area around Cueva de Luna exploited a wide vari­ety of animal and plant species from both regional environments. By that time, the demand for exotic goods from Hispanicized criollo society had resulted in the formation of a large-scale exchange network connecting the different indigenous groups with each other and with the Spanish­speaking population (Duran 2004). This network grew even stronger during the eighteenth century. Although indigenous groups continued hunting and gathering traditionally foraged species, they also started producing food. By the end of the eighteenth century, populations were no longer organized into bands, but rather into tribal groups with greater political integration, incipient social hierarchy, and an economy based also on com­merce and grazing (Duran 2004; Michieli 1978). 
Environmental Context and 
Description of the Cueva de Luna Site 

The study area is located west of the city of Malargtie, in the central Rio Grande Valley. This region may be considered to be an extension of Argentinean Patagonia (Cabrera 1976; Gonzalez and Fauque 1993; Polanski 1954; Roig 1972). Because the Andean massif is lower in altitude here than in the rest of the province, the South Pacific anticyclone is the dominant weather pat­tern (Capitanelli 1972). The annual average rain­fall of approximately 300 mm is evenly distributed across the seasons, which are mild to cool, with an average annual temperature of l 2°C. Although winter precipitation (both snow and rain) predom­inates due to the presence of the anticyclone, sum­mer rainfalls produced by humid air masses from the Atlantic also reach the area. 
Phytogeographically, the area can be charac­terized as an ecotone between the Monte, Patag­onia, and Payunia ecosystems (Roig et al. 2000). Vegetation is mostly similar to that encountered in Monte regions (represented by Larrea), but it includes Patagonian species such as Grindelia chiloensis and Retanilla patagonica, a species endemic to Payunia regions. In flood-prone areas close to the site, cattail (Typha subulata), common reed (Phragmites australis), and Cortaderia rudiuscula are found. Due to local conditions of elevation, temperature, and humidity, the vegeta­tion is highly adapted to drought and wind, as well as to herbivorous animals. Compact, hemi­spherical, cushion-like species abound. The description of the microenvironment is summa­rized in Table 2.

elevation of about I ,300 mas!, and approximately 
I .5 km to the north of the El Manzano stream (Figure I). The cave is 9 m high by 8.5 m deep and has a southwest-northeast orientation. Exca­vations were carried out in 1996 by Victor Duran. The units were oriented north-south and were placed across the middle part of the cave. They covered an area of 3 .5 m'. The excavation reached a depth of 60 cm from the surface (Figure 2). Three natural layers are identifiable in the strati­graphic profile (Figure 3). Layer I is closest to the surface and varies in depth from 2 cm in grid square D4 to 20 cm in grid square G4. Layer II is the most important because it has the largest num­ber of archaeological remains. This stratigraphic unit is very homogeneous and is made up of gray­ish-brown sandy loam. Within this matrix we identified a concentration of Gramineae and mixed branches that may have been a "bed." Layer III consists of reddish-brown loamy sediment that starts to appear between 50 and 55 cm below the surface. No plant macro-remains were recovered in this layer. 
Materials and Methods 
Archaeobotanical materials from Cueva de Luna were screened through a 2-mm mesh. The fraction larger than 2 mm was sorted visually, while the fraction smaller than 2 mm was examined in full under the microscope (a Nikon SMZ800). Recov­ered materials were found to be intact and in a dry state of preservation. The section on results pro­vides a list of the families, genera, and species identified from the sample. The only quantitative results were frequency data calculated on the basis of absolute counts. Density and ubiquity could not be measured given that the volume of sediment excavated was not recorded. Eppendorf containers indicating site, layer, grid square, and level of occupation were prepared for all plant macrofos­sils. They are stored in the Anthropology Depart­ment of the Museo de Historia Natural de San Rafael, Mendoza (MHNSR).

Discussion and Conclusions 
The archaeological record of Cueva de Luna indi­cates that occupation in the area began ca. 3800 
B .P. (Component 5; see Table 1). Indigenous groups inhabited the region as part of a multian­nual system of mobility. This system covered a very large area, which may have extended across the Andean mountain range and as far west as the Pacific coast (Duran 2004; Sanhueza et al. 2004). After this initial occupation, there is a gap of more than 1,500 years in the archaeological record. There have been various tentative explanations for this, among which environmental change may be the most likely (Gil et al. 2005). Around 1500 

B .P. the archaeological record resumes, indicating 


adaptations and patterns of occupation similar to those of the initial period (Component 4). 
The archaeobotanical record from Cueva de Luna consists primarily of seeds and woody endocarps in a dry state of preservation and abounds with native wild taxa, including algarrobo (Prosopis sp.), molle (Schinus polygamus), solupe (Ephedra), andjarilla (Larrea nitida). Domesti­cated American species such as bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) are also present. The relative abundance of cultivated vs. native beans is noteworthy. Eurasian wheat and walnut trees are also present, but only in the youngest levels of grid squares D4 and E4, which is consistent with the chrono­stratigraphy of the site. It should be mentioned that, in the chronology suggested by Duran (2004), materials from Component 3 cannot be assigned to a particular time period. Nevertheless, Neme et al. (1995) propose that Component 3 should be attributed to hunter-gatherer occupa­tions preceding European contact, given that no evidence of Spanish influence has been found in the zooarchaeological record (Neme et al. 1995). 
Ethnohistorical evidence for the adoption of Old World crops in Argentina was exhaustively examined by Capparelli et al. (2005). It is impor­tant to emphasize that the neighboring country of Chile played a central role in the production and

distribution of crops like wheat, barley, and Euro­pean fruit trees. Indeed, wheat may have been introduced into southern Mendoza before the city of Mendoza itself was founded in 1561 by Pedro de! Castillo. Baez (1948) claims that the indige­nous Huarpe traded these crops with Chilean groups prior to that time. Bengoa (1991) also states that, during the second half of the sixteenth century, with the Spanish expansion south of the Biobio River, indigenous communities began con­suming new plant and animal species (Torrej6n and Cisternas 2002). Given this information, it is not unreasonable to think that trade networks across the Andes may have been established fairly early on. 
Furthermore, historical data show that wheat was not directly introduced by the Spaniards (Cap­parelli et al. 2005), but that the spread of this species occurred as a result of exchange with peo­ple from Chile during Valdivia's government (Baez 1948). This is perhaps not surprising con­sidering the existence of trans-Andean trade routes, as documented by Bibar (1966 [1558]). These observations lend support to the hypothesis that, in some regions, Old World crops spread before permanent settlement by Spanish-speaking people, as occurred in the Calchaquf valleys (Cap­parelli et al. 2005). Therefore, although Compo­nent 3 contains vast quantities of macro-remains of Triticum (n = 67), it may correspond to hunter­gatherer occupations prior to European contact. 
In the case of the younger Component 2, the archaeobotanical data are consistent with other authors' interpretations (Duran 2004; Neme et al. 1995) that it corresponds to Pehuenche occupation of the region in the eighteenth and nineteenth cen­turies. Pehuenche groups played a key role in the introduction and management of Old World species in the area, and modern rural populations (represented by ranchers) may have ancestral ties to them. 
The results of this study suggest that, despite the fact that Eurasian cultivars were introduced to the American continent by Spaniards, local groups received these resources by exchange. Therefore, while the introduction of wheat and walnut trees increased the number of vegetal taxa known and probably consumed, they do not appear to have replaced local resources. Instead, they appear to have been added to the list of species consumed, indicating use of both native and introduced crops, rather than an abrupt break­down of the traditional system. Future research should evaluate potential transformations brought

about by the incorporation of Spanish Mediter­ranean agricultural and animal husbandry tech­niques. These inevitably entail both a structural modification of ecosystems and a process of cul­tural change, but not necessarily a loss of local knowledge.
