MelissaVogel’sbookonElPurgatorio,anancientcity on the north coast of Peru, is part of a University Press of Florida series, Ancient Cities of the New World,about ancienturban sitesofMesoamerica and South America. It is exciting to see the capital of theCasma includedina series with Aztec, Inca, and Maya cities because until recently this civilization wasvirtually unknown.Itisprimarily throughVogel’s research that theCasma statehas been identi.ed and studied. The book details a decade of research at the site and addresses broader issues of urbanism andsociopolitical transformations.Atthe coreofthe research is the hypothesis that during the latter half of the .rst millennium AD in the Andean coastal regions,afundamental shiftoccurred,awayfromelites using public ritual on largeplatform mounds to assert theirpower andconnectiontothe supernatural,toward new types of cities with walled enclosures where elites engaged in exclusive activities that furthered economic interests and territorial expansion. Vogel terms this a “hegemonic transition,” which entailed achange fromreligious-basedgoverningstrategiesto onesthat were morebureaucratic and centralized,and thestudy detailshowElPurgatorioisanexampleof this transition. This transformationiswell documented by many researchers, but Vogel provides a new and insightfulwayof lookingat thiskeytransition. 
The book has nine chapters, beginning with chap­ter1,anexaminationofurbanisminancient America. In this chapter, debates over urbanism in ancient societies, and the uniqueness of Andean cities are discussed.It also includesadescriptionofthe research planatElPurgatorio,whichinvolved survey,mapping, excavation, andlab analyses.Chapter2isanoverview of late prehistory in the Andean region, which is not a comprehensive history but instead is aimed at readers unfamiliar with the region or those who want an update. This is a productive approach and helpsmakethe book accessibletodifferent audiences. A focus of the chapter is the architectural tradition on the north coast and how it changed over time. Platform mounds were dominant until late Moche (AD 550–800) when high-walled compounds became more common. Some civilizations, in particular the Lambayeque, maintained the platform mound tradi­tion, while the Chimú and the Casma did not. This hegemonictransitionwasashift from public,theatrical ritual ledbyreligious leaderstoexclusiveevents (such as feasts) in which religion was less important. In assessing why this change occurred, Vogel stresses that thewalledcompounds area local traditiondating back to the Early Horizon, becoming monumental in the Middle Horizon. However, it is hard not to contemplate the possible relationship between the spread of the Wari state, whose hallmark was large, enclosed compound architecture, and the preference forthisarchitecture. While compound architectureis foundin theregionpreviously,justasitisinmany areas,itisnot untilWariandthe MiddleHorizonthatit becomeslarger, moreimpressive,and associated with elites.Vogel doesdiscussin laterchaptersthatWari, andthe increased tradeand interactioninthe Middle Horizon, contributedtothe riseof theCasma state.

Chapter5 covers religionand ritual,withalarge sectiononritual architecturethatis,in places,repet­itive from previous chapters. Vogel makes an inter­esting comparison with Egyptian temples that have several gathering areas from large plazas to small rooms used only by the highest of.cials and rulers. Here and at El Purgatorio, “rather than appealing to the masses, there was an exclusion of the masses” 
(p. 40).InChapter6the urban economyis discussed, and Vogel points out the uniqueness of the political economies of Andean cities where exchange was focusedontribute,reciprocity,and redistribution. She concludes that both elite supervised workshops and household production existed in the city. Chapter 7 concentrates on theidentities of the urbanresidents. Social strati.cation was correlated with residential districts that consisted of ruling elites, intermediate elites, and commoners. 
Chapter8 examines El Purgatorio’s relationships with other regions. Vogel emphasizes cross-cultural interaction with Andean groups including Pachaca­mac, Chancay, Wari, Chimú, and Lambayeque. She makes some comparisons with West Mexico’s shaft tomb complex,which hassome similaritieswith north coast Andean cultures, although the evidence seems fairly weak. Chapter 9 sums up the research and discusses its broader implications. Vogel compares Casmatothe Induscivilization,acorporatestate with an elite rulingclassbut noindividualglori.cationor theatrical displays of power. She concludes that the research supports Stanish’s(2010) idea that Andean cites were small because they had limited market exchange,and their economies were underthe control of elites, andoften did not surviveleadership changes. 
One strength of the book is that Vogel makes comparisons with otherancient states while also high­lightingtheunique natureofElPurgatorio.Thebook is part of a series of accessible studies of urbanism that complementintroductory textbooks.However,it seemsadvanced forintroductory studentsand maybe more appropriate in an upper division course. In its appeal to a wider audience it is not as data heavy as many academic books,butoverall,itis well-written and argued, and makes a substantial contribution to the study of ancient civilizations.

In this ambitious book, AllenChristenson arguesthat contemporary Tz’utujil Maya ritual practices during Semana Santa (HolyWeek)preserve elements ofthe ancient “world renewal” ceremonies of the lowland andhighlandMaya. Christensonattemptsthisby.rst reviewing accounts of rituals from Yucatan and the Maya highlands,and theroleofEasterinthe Spanish conquest, before devoting several chapters to ethno­graphicdescriptions of contemporaryTz’utujil cere­monies.ItiscommendablethatChristenson attempts to historicize the claims of continuity between pre­columbian year-end (Wayeb’) rites and Holy Week in Santiago Atitlán that have been put forward by scholarssuchasE.Michael Mendelson (1957, 1959) for over half a century. Unfortunately the lack of a well-de.ned theoretical andmethodological approach limitshowconvincingitisasaworkof ethnohistory. 
The book comprises an introduction and 10 chap­ters. It has no endnotes that would allow further theoretical or methodological explanations without encumbering themaintext. Theintroductionde.nes the object of the book as Maya “world renewal” ceremonies, described as those through which ritual practitioners “rebirth theworld,” especially “at critical points duringthe calendaryear”(1).Discussion of suchworldrenewal ceremonies willbefamiliartoa Mesoamericanist audience, but Christenson doesn’t explicitly place his work in dialogue with any aca­demictheoriesofritual or syncretism. Onereason this is so problematicis that thereis nothingexclusively Maya about world renewal ceremonies so broadly de.ned. Ceremonial elements such as the new .re, sacri.ce, and “world trees” are hardly unique to Mesoamericaeither. This limits theauthor’s abilityin manycases to demonstratehistorical continuity or pur­poseful syncretism as more plausible interpretations ofaHolyWeek rite than acculturationorlocalization within aglobal religion. 
Following theintroduction, the.rsttwo chapters describe precolumbian world renewal ceremonies in lowland Yucatan and the Maya Highlands. These descriptions arederived primarily fromthe accounts of colonial Spanish clergymen, supplemented by colonial Mayan language texts and interpretations of precolumbian iconography.The author admirably assembles and discusses selections from the reports of numerous missionary priests, especially for the Highlands. These works, by the likes of Las Casas, Remesal and Vico, are not widely available in
