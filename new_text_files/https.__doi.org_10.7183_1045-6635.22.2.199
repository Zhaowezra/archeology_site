EASTERN PERIPHERY OF THE MAYA LOWLANDS

This paper pursues the application of a central tenet of the dual-processual framework, the corporate/network continuum, to the development ofUxbenka, a small monument-bearing polity in the southern Maya Lowlands. During its growth, Uxbenkti underwent a transformation from a small farming community to a complex polity with many of the trappings of elite author­ity that characterizes Classic Maya centers. It was one of the earliest complex polities to develop on the southeastern periph­ery of the Maya lowlands during the Early Classic period (A.D. 300-600). The polity was founded upon earlier agricultural communities that are now known to extend back to at least A.D. 100. Starting after A.D. 200 the location of the original agricultural village (Group A) was leveled and reorganized to form a public monument garden and the center of political authority throughout much of the Classic period (A.D. 400-800). In this article we present radiocarbon ages from well­defined stratigraphic contexts to establish a site chronology. Based on these data we suggest that by A.D. 450Uxbenka was the center of a regional political system connected to some of the larger polities in the Maya world (e.g., Tikal). We argue that at this time Uxbenka underwent a significant change from a polity organized by a corporate inclusionary form of ruler­ship to a more networked one marked by exclusionary authority vested in elites who privileged their ancestral relations and network interactions across the geopolitical landscape.

hierarchically structured (Blanton et at 1996; Fein­man 2000a). This framework is not considered an alternative to more traditional concerns with hier­archy, or as presenting new typological formula­tions, but rather as a means to emphasize different forms of hierarchical and heterarchical organiza­tion and to "expand our comparative theoretical concepts so that they may better account for more general patterns of societal variation and change" (Feinman 2000b:32). 
This paper pursues the application of a central tenet of the dual-processual framework, the cor­porate/network continuum, to the development of Uxbenka, an ancient complex polity located along the eastern periphery of the Maya Lowlands in an important archaeological region known colloqui­ally as "southern Belize" (Figure 1). We argue that Uxbenka was the first community in southern Belize with the ability to mobilize labor around sig­nificant architectural construction and landscape transformations. During its evolution Uxbenka underwent a shift from a small village or hamlet during the Late Preclassic to a complex polity with social differentiation reflected in distinctions between civic-ceremonial and residential spaces, specialized architectural forms, and carved stelae that record statements attesting to the authority and network interactions of individual elites. We argue that this process represents a shift in leadership dynamics at the site from corporate strategies to more network modes of action, with elites reach­ing out and making economic, social, and political connections with the rulers from larger political centers as sources of local power. 
Our discussion of Uxbenka focuses primarily on the period from 50 B.C. to A.D. 600. Before 
A.D. 200 Uxbenka was a small village or farm­ing community, with no monumental buildings or significant public architecture. Following A.D. 200 the first documented masonry construction appears (in ceremonial buildings), the transfor­mation of residential spaces into public plazas, and

significant landscape alteration. After A.D. 400 elites began erecting carved stone monuments describing the achievements of individuals and attesting to their genealogical legitimacy as rulers. Uxbenka remained the only community in the region engaged in monument production until after A.D. 550, when we see the rise of Pusilha, Lubaantun, Nimli Punit, and other minor capitals (Braswell and Prufer 2009). Our data have impli­cations for understanding early settlement expan­sion in the southeastern lowlands and extend the age of complex polities in the southern Belize back by at least 300 years. 
Dual Processual Frameworks and 
Corporate/Network Strategies 

Theories are sets of general guiding principles "that help us-as researchers and as curious human beings-make sense of specific cases and of the world around us" (Hegmon 2003:213). They pro­vide us with tools to categorize and explain phe­nomena. Most models of the evolution of political and economic complexity in Mesoamerica have been dominated by theoretical notions linking cen­tralization to hierarchical development (Flannery 1972), with more recent agent-based modifications that emphasize individual self-interest and strate­gies of accumulation (Clark and Blake 1994; Hay­den 1995). Significant criticism has been leveled against models of these kinds in Mesoamerica in that they focus primarily on directional develop­ments of static societal types (Blanton et al. 1996: 1) and that they fail to recognize that there can be mul­ti pie strategies, pathways, and organizational modes that actors can take in their pursuit of power, many of which will leave different patterns in the archaeological record (Feinman 2001: 155). The dual processual framework identifies two distinct strategies employed by politically and economi­cally motivated actors without ignoring the "sig­nificant cross cultural implications" of hierarchical complexity for understanding social variations (Feinman 2000b:34). 
These organizational strategies occur along a continuum from decentralized/inclusive, or corpo­rate, to highly centralized, or exclusionary, net­worked configurations. Corporate strategies emphasize collective approaches to group integra­tion, particularly in staple food production, com­munal ritual, labor tasks, and to some degree the suppression of economic differentiation (Feinman 2000a:214). Archaeological evidence for such a strategy can include communally constructed archi­tecture, few status markers in domestic settings, and general lack of distinction in the distribution of prestige items in both houses and burials. While long-distance trade and craft specialization may be present in corporate configurations, they tend not to be controlled by a centralized administrative hierarchy (Feinman 2001: 158). 
At the network-or exclusionary-end of the continuum, individual accumulation of power and prestige are favored with personal exchanges of wealth, lineal patterns of inheritance, elaborated burials, and other markers of individualized lead­ership in greater evidence (Feinman 2000b:38). Archaeological evidence for such strategies includes prestige items from distant locations preferentially found in elite contexts (e.g., chiefly houses or high-status burials), individualized rep­resentations on "art" or political monuments, dif­ferential size of residential structures, or highly restricted, private, elite spaces. Corporate/network strategies coexist to varying degrees in all social formations (Blanton et al. 1996:2), but to the extent that one is emphasized over the other they represent different modes of political and eco­nomic organization. 
One advantage of applying the dual-processual approach to the analysis of ancient polities is its flexibility as a model. Representing two extremes of a continuum, corporate/network ideologies sug­gest that "there is more than one strategy or path­way to power" and that these different ends of the continuum would have different archaeological correlates (Feinman 2001: 155). Further, "corpo­rate/network is neither a typology nor a dichotomy since there is a large definable middle ground that can be empirically observed between these polar extremes. Rather, it is an axis of dimension on which modes of political-economic action may be compared and contrasted" (Feinman 2000c:221). Hence, these strategies cannot be conflated with specific cultural formations or "personalities" (Feinman 2001: 156). Nor can it be assumed that changes along the continuum will be uniformly directional, or that specific strategies will remain unchanged in a region or a particular temporal sequence. Understanding the corporate/network

dimension allows one to enhance comparative-evo­lutionary discussions while maintaining hierarchi­cal complexity as a key analytical axis. 
The flexibility of this approach is reflected in numerous applications of dual-processual theory to the study of complex societies. The original treat­ment was a comparison of Early and Middle For­mative network strategies present in incipient Gulf Coast and West Mexican polities with the decidedly corporate character of Teotihuacan (Blanton et al. 1996). Other, more recent studies in Mesoamerica have examined corporate power-sharing strategies in the Tequila Valley of Jaliso, Mexico (Beekman 2008) and inter-site competition between corporate institutions against individual aggrandizers in the Terminal Classic Naco Valley of Honduras (Urban and Schortman 2004). Elsewhere, the model has been applied to the reevaluations of political action­strategies in the Puebloan Southwest (Feinman 2000a, 2000b ), and outside of the New World cor­porate/network strategies have been proposed as a mechanism to study the development of secondary states in the Aegean (Parkinson and Galaty 2007), and to examine leadership strategies in data-rich ancient Greece (Small 2009). 
In the southern Maya Lowlands, it has been proposed that in Late Preclassic ( 400 B.C. -AD. 300) polities, leadership used corporate strategies for polity building, evidenced by public displays of "cosmic renewal imagery" (Blanton et al. 1996: 12) and reliance on cyclical notions of time. These strategies were eclipsed in Classic period (AD. 300-800) polities where elite groups pro­moted named rulers whose ancestry, divinity, and paramount power was proclaimed on carved ste­lae placed in visible public locations. The emer­gence of institutionalized divine rulership (ajaw) symbolized exclusionary control of both super­natural processes and prestige goods. The wide­spread use of the Long Count calendar system for tracking dynastic histories on stelae and other media after AD. 300 further enhanced the exclu­sionary messages and practices (Feinman 2001: 170). Following the decline of many lowland polities in between AD. 700 and 950 both the ste­lae tradition and the use of the Long Count ceased, signaling an end to these very specific elite strate­gies of consolidating and maintaining power, which may generally indicate a return to more cor­porate strategies (Aimers 2007:346). 
At Uxbenka we suggest that internal develop­ments likely fell along a corporate-network con­tinuum, with a shift over time from a corporate kin-group organization as the polity formed to an organization increasingly network in character. This shift along the continuum occurred parallel with the development of public spaces, landscape transformation, and elite appropriation of sacred spaces, all of which required a significant mobi­lization of labor. These changes culminated in establishment of carved monuments describing, in text and image, the authority of privileged indi­viduals, their ancestral relations, and their network interactions across the geopolitical landscape. Our assessment is based on a renewed understanding of the chronological development of different archi­tectural components of the site, based on strati­graphic excavations and radiocarbon dating, combined with records from carved monuments, and excavations from an important cave site that overlooks Uxbenka. 
Uxbenka and Its Sociopolitical Context 
Before discussing the development of Uxbenka, it is important to describe the regional geopolitical landscape. Despite a century of research, southern Belize remains one of the least understood regions of the Maya Lowlands, in part due to its relative inac­cessibility. Colloquially referred to in Belize as the "forgotten district," it remained reachable only by boat or foot until the late 1960s. The region is geo­graphically circumscribed by the Maya Mountains to the west, swampy river basins to the south, the Caribbean Sea to the east, and inhospitable pine barrens to the north. At the time when it was set­tled, Uxbenka was positioned in a geopolitically marginal region. Through time it found itself situ­ated near trade routes connecting larger polities, including Tikal, Copan, and Caracol. 
Chronological schemes (periods and phases) characterizing the development of complexity in the Maya Lowlands have been employed for decades, despite the fact that they cannot be applied uniformly across regions and do not measure the same processes at different polities. Following Demarest (2004: 12-14) we agree that it is neces­sary to accept some "odd mix of terms that largely serve as arbitrary units of time, but that still have some residual implications ... regarding level of

development." Hence, we use the standard tempo­ral nomenclature employed in the Maya Lowlands (Figure 2). This paper focuses primarily on two temporal components: the latter portion of the Late Preclassic (A.D. 1-300); and, the Early Classic 
(A.D. 300-600). The Late Preclassic witnessed both the development and disintegration of major political centers in the central Maya Lowlands, with massive expansion and political centraliza­tion occurring at Tikal and Calakmul correspond­ing with a decline of authority at the earlier power centers of Nakbe and El Mirador. The Early Clas­sic in the Peten is characterized by the ascendancy of Tikal as a regional power, and the extension of its influence southward towards Copan aroundAD. 426 (Sharer 2003:322). Tikal's greater regional 
. influence was possibly stimulated by increased 

interaction after AD. 378 with the highly central­ized and expansionistic state of Teotihuacan located in the central Mexican highlands (see Braswell 2003). This would have facilitated Tikal's access to lucrative trade routes in the southern Peten and southeastern lowlands (Sharer 2003:351). 
Southern Belize is located in a geographic and cultural frontier of the Maya Lowlands. Like other Maya frontiers (Henderson 1992), it was likely peripheral to, yet connected with, the cultural and political developments occurring in larger and more 
economically and politically powerful centers (Schortman and Urban 1994). During southern Belize's apogee betweenAD. 400 and 900, its poli­ties were involved in significant economic inter­actions, facilitated by a range of mineral and biotic resources (Abrarniuk and Meurer 2006; Dunham 1996; Dunham and Prufer 1998; Graham 1987), exceedingly productive agricultural lands (Prufer 2005; Wright et al. 1959), and easily traversable coastal (McKillop 2005) and inland (Hammond 1978) trade routes that provided access from the Caribbean Sea to the southern and western Peten. Archaeological and epigraphic studies suggest that polities in southern Belize may have been linked politically and economically with Copan and Quirigua (Braswell et al. 2005:220; Grube et al. 1999; Marcus 1992, 2003:95), Tikal (Leventhal 1992: 152; Prufer 2005; Wanyerka 2005), the west­ern Peten (Bill and Braswell 2005; Prufer et al. 2006), the southeastern Peten (Prufer 2005), and the Belize Valley (Braswell et al. 2005:226; Prufer 2002: 180). 
Until recently most regional settlement chronologies relied on architectural styles (e.g., presence of ballcourts), epigraphic data, and, to a lesser extent, comparison of ceramics with other regions of the Maya Lowlands (e.g., Dunham 1996; Hammond 1975; Leventhal 1990, 1992). In gen­eral, these studies indicate that the number of poli­ties and density of settlements were highest during the Late Classic. In adjacent regions, Elizabeth Graham ( 1994) found evidence of pre-AD. 600 set­tlements along the coastal plain in the Stann Creek District, 80 km to the north, though this area is sep­arated from southern Belize by a series of inhos­pitable pine savannas. Most of the occupation of the Stann Creek region is Late and Terminal Clas­sic, and little is known about the numerous sites in the region beyond the broadest temporal sketch. Some, such as Pamona, Mayflower, and Kendal are located along rivers seasonally navigable by canoe, and have been suggested to be nodes in riverine site hierarchies (Graham 1994:320), or formed through expanding kin or other social networks. Coastal sites may have been simple subsistence villages that also engaged in procurement of marine and estu­arine resources (Graham 1994:316) or, in some cases, mediated maritime trade networks (McKil­lop 2005). Along the coast of southern Belize, McKillop (1996: 56) recovered a Protoclassic

mammiform vessel from a Preclassic shell mound 
(ca. A.D. 100) and radiocarbon-dated Early Clas­
sic settlements on Wild Cane Caye, indicating 
established maritime communities by AD. 300. 
However, two decades of work by McKillop (2005, 
2006) strongly suggest mercantile seafaring was 
largely a post AD. 500 phenomenon, further under­
scoring the relatively late timeframe for most 
regional development, albeit one that extended well 
into the Postclassic. 
The early communities closest to Uxbenka were in the southeastern Peten (Guatemala), positioned along the western foothills of the Maya Moun­tains. Most of these settlements post-date A.D. 600, though there were earlier Preclassic occupa­tions at Sacul, Ixkun, Xutilha, and Ixtonton in the Dolores area (Laporte 1994, 2001; Laporte and Ramos 1998). Throughout the watersheds that drain the western Maya Mountains of Guatemala, including the Rios Machaquila, San Luis, and Pusilha, there is continuity between the Preclassic and Early Classic at many locations, marked by what Laporte calls the "Peripheral Chicane!" sphere (2001: 17), defined by the continuation of Preclassic ceramic types well into the Early Clas­sic period. Laporte has suggested an A.D. 100 to 
A.D.600 geopolitical landscape of competing rural elites autonomous from the larger central Peten polities (Laporte 1996; Laporte and Ramos 1998). Overall, the southeastern Peten, like southern Belize, was most densely populated during the Late and Terminal Classic periods, and evidence for Early Classic occupations is ephemeral (Brady 1989: 207; Laporte 2001). 
The only other Preclassic or Early Classic com­plex polity in the region is Ek Xux, located in the interior of the eastern Maya Mountains along the Bladen Branch of the Monkey River, which is home to a number of sites that have been mapped, but are generally poorly understood (Dunham and Prufer 1998). Nine sites with public architecture are known in the eastern flank of the Maya Mountains, but excavation data only exist for Ek Xux and Muk­lebal Tzul, both located in adjacent valleys near the headwaters of the Bladen Branch. These suggest that Ek .Xux was settled in a small alluvial valley during the Late Preclassic and persisted as a rela­tively small community for at least four centuries. Muklebal Tzul, located on a series of high ridges 3 km to the west of Ek Xux, appeared rather sud­denly on the landscape after A.D. 600 and quickly eclipsed its small neighbor (Prufer 2005). 
With the exception of Uxbenka and Ek Xux, Southern Belize remained only sparsely settled until after A.D. 550 when the region rapidly grew to include at least 10 monument-bearing polities and over 100 smaller communities. The best known of these are Lubaantun, Pusilha, and Nimli Punit. Hammond (1975:52) conducted excavations at Lubaantun and, based primarily on ceramics, sug­gested the site was founded in A.D. 731 ± 20 years (Maya calendar date 9.15.0.0.0 ± 1 katun). He also noted that the ceramic assemblage was dominated by Tepeu 2/3 Peten sty Jes of the Late Classic (max ­imally A.D. 700-890). Hammond also argued for links between southern Belize and sites in the Pasion River area of the western Peten (1975:295), which are supported by more recent studies at other Late Classic centers (Braswell et al. 2005; McKil­lop 2006; Prufer 2005;). Lubaantun lacks epigraphic history from monuments, though two carved ball­court markers have been stylistically dated to the Late Classic (Wanyerka 2005). 
Pusilha was excavated by the British Museum (Joyce 1929; Joyce et al. 1927), Leventhal ( 1990, 1992), and Braswell (Bill and Braswell 2005). Hieroglyphic texts suggest that the polity may have been formed as late as A.D. 570 and per­sisted at least through A.D. 790. Excavations in core and domestic contexts support this chronol­ogy (Braswell and Prufer 2009:48), though small amounts of Early Classic materials have been recovered from cave sites in the vicinity of this center. As at Lubaantun, ceramic data suggest Late Classic affiliation closely aligned with Tepeu sphere polities in the Peten, particularly in the Pasion and Petexbatun areas (Bill and Braswell 2005). 
Nimli Punit is the least known polity in the region. It is located on a 100 m high ridge over­looking the coastal plain (Hammond et al. 1999). Most of the published chronological material on Nimli Punit comes from 25 carved monuments found in the elite plazas of this highly consolidated center. These have been interpreted to suggest the site was occupied only during the Late Classic, with stelaeerected between AD. 711 andA.D.830 bracketing a short dynastic history for the polity. The Nimli Punit inscriptions are described as both "unique and idiosyncratic" (Grube et al. 1999: 36)

with examples of reverse order readings, inverted calendar signs, and evidence that the placement and carving of the monuments may be temporally separated events. Epigraphers have also suggested that Nimli Punit was regularly interacting with sites to the southeast, specifically Copan, based largely on the presence of a possible toponym for this important center (Wanyerka 2009:465). 
Artifacts and monuments indicate ties between southern Belize and the central Peten from A.D. 370-500, probably via trade routes through the southeastern Peten (Prufer 2005). During the sub­sequent period (A.D. 500-900) there may have been a shift in interaction and affiliation within the region, with epigraphic accounts of ties develop­ing between southern Belize and sites located in the southeast periphery, especially Copan and Quirigua (Braswell et al. 2005; Grube et al. 1999; Marcus 1992; Wanyerka 2009:440-477) andAltun Ha (Wanyerka 2009:473), though archaeological correlates of these relationships are wanting. The southern Belize apogee was a time of significant expansion and population growth in the region, and those developments lie outside the scope of this paper. By the ninth century the area was in decline, and there is little evidence of any significant inland Postclassic occupation. 
A favorable location and the presence of desir­able resources may have played a role in the devel­opment of the Uxbenka polity. The landscape around Uxbenka is exceptionally rich for agricul­ture and also has easy access to coastal and inland trade routes. Soils around Uxbenka derive from decomposing sedimentary sand-, silt-, and mud­stones interspersed by limestone outcrops. These are part of a formation of low hills running from Nim Li Punit to several kilometers west of Uxbenka and referred to as the Toledo Uplands (Wright et al. 1959:8). Today, these soils are considered among the most fertile in the region. Within the lands of the ancient Uxbenka polity, modern Mopan Maya farmers plant shifting slash-and-bum corn crops with a short 3-5 year fallow. According to local farmers the same lands have been planted and rotated since the 1950's with no loss of soil pro­ductivity. These upland soils are also considered ideal for the cultivation of cacao (Steinberg 2002:59), a practice documented in the region at least since the seventeenth century (Thompson 1972:35-41) and reflected in the modern Mopan cacao economy. Though anecdotal, remnant cacao groves in the Maya Mountains suggest a flourish­ing regional economy in cacao products (Prufer 2002:186-187), and several cacao beans were found in a mortuary cave 25 km north of Uxbenka dating to ca. A.D. 300 (Prufer and Hurst 2007). 
At Uxbenka excavations have focused on chronology-building and the identification of the early components at the site (Figure 3), primarily in the Stela Plaza (Group A), the North Group (Group B), and two settlement complexes near the site core. Group A is the location of three pre-A.D. 500 stela, while Group B contains Late Classic architecture, including a ballcourt complex. In the following section we report on our efforts to develop a reliable chronology for Uxbenka, and relate this chronology to the development of the complex polity. 
Chronology and Development at Uxbenka 
Radiocarbon Methods 
In a region with few absolute dates from archaeo­logical contexts, our AMS radiocarbon dating pro­gram allows us to develop an independent chronology for interpreting settlement dynamics and the growth of Uxbenka. Charcoal and other organic samples from well-documented strati­graphic contexts (see below) were prepared along with standards and backgrounds at the University of Oregon Archaeometry Facility and the Univer­sity of California Irvine Keck Carbon Cycle AMS Facility (UCI KCCAMS) following standard prac­tices.1 Where possible a single piece of wood or charcoal was selected to avoid the averaging inher­ent in bulk samples, and pieces likely to be shorter­lived (e.g., twigs) were chosen where possible to reduce any old wood effect (Kennett et al. 2002; Schiffer 1986). All dates are reported in Table 1 as conventional radiocarbon ages corrected for frac­tionation with measured o13C according to Stuiver and Polach (1977). Calendar ages discussed in the text and listed in Table 1 are 2-sigma calibrated ranges (95.4 percent probability; for clarity, dis­continuous ranges are simplified in the text).

Group A: Stela Plaza 
Excavations in the plaza reveal that what was once AMS radiocarbon assays suggest that the Uxbenka an uneven and likely conically shaped hilltop was was a settled community by the first century A.D. significantly modified to create the flat, open stela Excavations in Group A, the Stela Plaza (Figure 4), plaza.

tivel y easy to modify and its high clay content ren­ders it relatively impermeable to water, but there is little pooling of water during torrential rainy season deluges. One clue as to how this plaza drains has emerged from several test units and trenches excavated into the plaza that reveal pos­
sible drainage channels cut along a N-S axis into the bedrock plaza floor. Though not datable, these features likely coincide with the transformation of space into an open plaza. 
The early buildings in Group A may have been situated around the perimeter of the hilltop (Group A), inside what was eventually modified into the stela plaza. In Str. A-5 constructions using cut stone 
blocks date to after cal A.D. 300, based on profiles from looters' pits (Op. 06-6). A carbon sample removed from between the early plaster floor cap­ping a dirt platform and masonry construction blocks dated to cal A.D. 348-532 (UCIAMS­33401). This single date is consistent with two oth­ers from a test unit excavated adjacent to Str. A-5 (Op. 06-5) where charcoal samples from strati­graphic layers between plaster floors produced two dates. The first (UCIAMS-33403) dates to calA.D. 250-392 and the second (UCIAMS-33404) to cal 
A.D. 14 2-33 7. These dates all support the presence of an earlier dirt platform or floor below the stone constructions. In the upper levels of this unit diag-

nostic basal flange ceramics were recovered, 
indicative of an Early Classic occupation. 
A separate indication that the Late Preclas­
sic/Early Classic transition was a time of signifi­
cant site reorganization and landscape modification 
comes from a 17 m-long trench excavated in front 
(west) ofStr.A-6 in 2006 (Op. 06-7a-f). This exca­
vation revealed a low, one-to-two course sandstone 
wall seemingly unassociated with any extant archi­
tecture. An AMS date from the base of this wall 
suggests it was constructed sometime during cal 
A.D. 136-324 (UCIAMS-33400). This wall par­allels but is located below the western edge of Str. A-6. In addition to the wall, several large flat sand­stone pavers were found directly on leveled bedrock, suggesting the presence of an early floor. 
Excavations into structures in Group A also pro­duced pre-A.D. 250 dates and artifacts. These exca­vations suggest that (a) the earliest buildings at Uxbenka, identifiable only by the remnants of plas­tered floors, appear between A.D. 75 and 350, and most likely between A.D. 75 and 200; (b) the ear­liest buildings lacked any significant stone or masonry in their construction; ( c) stone sub-and superstructures likely appear after A.D. 350; and, 
(d) most of these Early Classic buildings show no evidence of any significant architectural remodel­ing (though they were frequently re-plastered). 
Test units were placed into three buildings, A­l, A-4, and A-6, and excavated to bedrock. In all three buildings there was evidence of burning in the very lowest levels, suggesting preparation of the building surface or clearing activities prior to con­struction. Str. A-1 is a triadic pyramid that may have formed part of a pseudo E-group complex ori­ented 90 degrees off the prototypical Uaxactun model, based on morphological similarity to other examples (see Aimers and Rice 2006). A series of 2 x 2 and 2 x 4 units were placed into the eastern and western flanks of this platform. The eastern flank was shaped bedrock that was modified through leveling and the addition of a stone fa;ade to give the appearance of a monumental construc­tion. Below a large section of wall collapse that may have marked an interior room or chamber, we found a well-preserved inset stairway flanked by balustrades, characteristic of architecture in the central Peten (Freidel 1979), albeit diminutive size. The most numerous artifacts associated with the stairway were fragments of crude Late Classic 
flanged and effigy modeled censers (A.D. 600-850), commonly found in elite contexts in the Belize Valley and central Peten (Rice 1999:38-391; Taschek and Ball 1999: 220). At the base (landing) of the stairway (Op. 07-4), between two layers of plaster flooring, a large deposit of carbonized wood fragments produced a date of cal A.D. 544-610 (UCIAMS-42809), which is consistent with large censer fragments and the presence of Late Classic ceramics. 
Excavations into the eastern flank of the plat­form between two structures (Op.07-5) revealed degraded plaster floors with no stone construction s below them and below those floors mixed fill that produced two dates from small areas of burning, between 200 and 230 cm below the final use sur­face, in what may be a mixed midden soil. One of these dated to calA.D. 73-211 (UCIAMS-42825). The second dates to cal A.D. 255-382 (UCIAMS­42808). Though not stratigraphically consistent, these suggest that the practice of building with stone on the eastern flank of Str. A-1 did not begin before the middle of the third century A.D., well into the Early Classic. Two additional samples from above the plaster floor date to between cal A.D. 420-610 (UCIAMS-46298, -42809). 
A single 2-x-2-m excavation into the western flank of A-1 uncovered an earlier construction below the final building phase (Op 08-4, Figure 5). This is the only example of multiple building phases in Group A. While the eastern flank of A-1 con­sisted largely of fill and a stone fa;ade over the existing hillslope, there was an intact structural wall under its western flank located approximately 180 cm below the final architectural surface. One AMS radiocarbon assay from below a ceramic­rich midden soil dated to cal A.D. 128-229 (UCI ­AMS-56360). This and the ceramics recovered are consistent with a Late Preclassic occupation. A sample recovered from fill within the buried struc­ture dated to cal A.D. 147-330 (UCIAMS-56359) and may be associated with the initial Early Clas­sic construction of the stela plaza. Two additional samples recovered from the surface of a plaster floor covering the earlier building date to cal A.O. 354-510 (UCIAMS-56367) and calA.D. 426-526 (UCIAMS-56368). This excavation revealed that the western flank of Str. A-1 was remodeled at least once during the Early Classic and not again during 
the Late Classic Period.

The Str. A-1 radiocarbon dates are generally con­sistent with dates from excavations in structures A­4 and A-6. In both buildings excavation units were placed into the summits and continued to bedrock, and in both the stratigraphy suggests that the Early Classic single-phase structures were placed over earlier, plaster-topped, dirt and rubble mounds. In the lowest levels of each excavation we encountered burned soil horizons, perhaps indicating clearing in preparation for the initial building events or dedi­catory activities. Generally, few artifacts were found in lower levels of these excavations. Eroded censer fragments as well as diagnostic Late Classic Fine Orange wares were found in upper levels within the stone construction and collapse debris, suggesting use after A.D. 600. In Str. A-4 a rim-to-base frag­ment of an orange-slipped basal flange bowl char­acteristic of the Early Classic central Peten Tzakol phase gloss wares was found in situ below the stone construction layers but above the early degraded floors, indicating an A.D. 300 terminus post quern for the later construction. 
In Str. A-4 (Op. 07-2) an AMS date from char­coal recovered from 260 cm below the building summit, at the interface of degraded bedrock, and dated the earliest construction phase. The sample came from a 1-2 cm thick charcoal and ash layer that extended across the entire 1-x-2-m unit. The layer dates tocalA.D. 255-382 (UCIAMS-42806), statistically indistinguishable from the date from 
Str. A-1 (UCIAMS-42808). In Str. A-6 (Op 07-3, Figure 6) two AMS samples date the interface between the earliest plaster floors and fill from later stone construction. Those dates suggest that the earliest stone building was constructed some­time between calA.D. 256 and calA.D. 402 (UCI­AMS-42805, -42807). This early floor was likely the surface of a small structure, but no ceramics were recovered, and organic material for dating was not recovered. 
North Group: Group B 
Excavation and dating of targeted contexts in Group B (Figure 7) produced a somewhat later chronol­ogy than Group A with no evidence of Preclassic dirt platforms below later constructions. All of the extant structures appear to be post-A.D. 500 con­structions. These include a temple (Str. B-1), ball­court (Strs. B-6 and B-7) and three patio structures (Strs. B-3, B-5, and B-11). Excavations of the front stairway of Str. B-1 (Op 08-8) produced a Late Classic assemblage consistent with elite ritual use. Artifacts include numerous effigy censer fragments and polychrome ceramics, suggesting the stairway was an area of ritual activity. A single AMS assay from under a slumped step produced a date of cal 
A.D. 658-766 (UCIAMS-56364). 
Group B does appear to have a significant Early Classic component, though much of it was buried during later site reorganization. Excavations placed between Strs. B-2 and B-3 (Subop 08-9) uncovered a section of a 1.6 m high masonry building or wall buried below the visible structures. A single radio­carbon assay from the base of the wall dated to cal 
A.D. 220-335 (UCIAMS-56362), suggesting con­struction in Group B consistent with the Early Clas­sic reorganization of Group A. 
Further evidence of a Early Classic reorgani­zation of Group B comes from excavations in front of Str. B-9, a low platform on the southwestern edge of Group B (Op 08-7, Figure 8). These revealed at least three Early Classic construction phases marked by plaster floors and partially intact construction blocks. At the base of the unit, 2 m below the surface, large cut limestone and sand­stone blocks were encountered on bedrock, appar­ently transported there to level the naturally northwest-sloping mudstone hill. Five calibrated dates from this excavation suggest that modifica­tion of the hilltop and construction of the Early Classic surface was carried out between A.D. 238 andA.D. 381 (UCIAMS-56361, -56369, -56370, -56371, -57044). Because two plaster floors sep­arate the dates from this excavation , we modeled, using OxCal (Bronk Ramsey 2009), a serie s of construction episodes every 40-50 years through this period. 
Settlement Groups 
We also have limited data on early settlements on hilltops adjacent to Groups A and B. Excavations in a small residential group (SG21, Figure 3) recov­ered charcoal accompanying a crypt burial that dated to calA.D. 179-334 (UCIAMS-42824). The simple crypt was in a dirt mound faced with a sin­gle course of stone and contained simple ceramic grave goods with degraded waxy reddish slips. This same settlement group was also occupied during the seventh century based on dates from a burial in an adjacent residential structure (cal A.D. 680-772,

A 6-x-3-m excavation on a hilltop between Group A and Group B (SG20, Figure 9) uncovered the remains of an early residential compound buried under 1.3 m of unconsolidated crushed mudstone fill that covered the entire hilltop. At 1.3 m below the modem surface a thin plaster floor was docu­mented in plan and profile covering a small badly decomposed dirt mound. At the base of the mound the partial remains of a small Late Preclassic Chi­cane) complex Sierra Red jar were found under a rock, possibly a cache commemorating the build­ing (see Rosenswig and Kennett 2008 for a simi­lar example). Residue from inside the vessel produced two dates of cal 35 B.C.-A.D. 84 (UCI­AMS-57042) and cal A.D. 135-244 (UCIAMS­56358). Charcoal from sediments directly below the cache dated to cal A.D. 84-2 15 (UCIAMS­56366).

Figure 7. Group B Plaza showing locations of on-and off-structure excavations. 
These dates suggest that the building was aban­doned and covered with fill no earlier than A.D. 
134. We interpret this as being the remains of a Pre­classic structure that was buried during the reor­ganization of the site. The presence of landscape modification outside the core architectural groups may be' an indication that these reorganizations resulted in other early buildings being abandoned and effectively erased from the site core area, under­scoring the difficulty of determining how this early settlement was organized. 
Kayuko Naj Tunich Cave 
Chronologies from Uxbenka are also informed by excavations conducted at Kayuko Naj Tunich Cave (Kayuko Cave), a small (19 m long x 2.5 m wide, maximum) cave located 2.3 km due south of the Uxbenka site core and 200 m above the valley floor (Figure 10). All the public architectural groups at Uxbenka open towards the 100 m high white cliff face where the mouth of this cave is located. Else­where, we (Moyes and Prufer 2009) have suggested that Kayuko Cave and the Witz (mountain) were

Based on previous stud­ies demonstrating that caves and mountains were critical elements in settlement planning and elite claims to legitimacy (Brady 1997; Prufer and Kin­don 2005; Vogt and Stuart 2005 ), Moyes and Prufer (2009) have proposed that Kayuko Naj Tunich may have been a "foundational" shrine established by elites when Uxbenka was reorganized in the Early Classic, a transformational time in the history of the polity. We base our assessment of this being an "elite" space in part on the scale of architectural modifications to the cave, which would have required an organized labor force to transport cut stone blocks and plaster a significant distance. Dur­ing the time that the cave modifications were con­structed, the only parts ofUxbenka using masonry construction were in Group A. In addition, a sig­nificant body of archaeological literature on caves points to the construction of architectural modifi­cations in subterranean spaces being a component of elite appropriation of powerful features in the sacred landscape (e.g., Brady and Prufer 2005; Prufer 2005). Further, ethnohistoric sources indi­cate that, across Mesoamerica, founding and cen­tering of communities, which are elite activities, are frequently focused on caves and sacred mountains (Garcia-Zambrano 1994). 
Accessing the cave requires scaling a 20 rn high cliff face to the entrance, which has significant architectural modifications, including a cut stone stairway leading 5 m to a masonry doorway, behind

which stood a large sandstone altar. The hundreds of tabular construction blocks used in these con­structions were clearly chosen for their flat sur­faces and likely came from the Rio Blanco, located in the valley km from the cave. All the architec­

ture in the cave and some sections of cave wall were plastered. A carved wooden canoe or basin was positioned on an altar-like feature; the outer growth edge of this wooden object dated to between cal 
A.D. 231-382 (UCIAMS-46295). 

Wooden beams once supported additional con­structions in the cave. These are evidenced by post­molds in the constructed cave floor and plaster molds in the walls, as well as intact sections of a supporting beam placed into the elevated floor. The beam dated to cal A.D. 240-339 (UCIAMS-42799) while a post fragment dated to cal A.D. 257-392 (UCIAMS-42803). A charcoal sample collected from the base of a pile of crystals (spar) associated with the stairway dated to cal A.D. 230-335 (UCI­AMS-42802). Several additional dates indicate repeated remodeling of the wooden apparatus in the cave and burning of incense during the Early Clas­sic Period, cal A.D. 427-60 1 (UCIAMS-42800, ­4280 l, ::;42804 ). The founding and use of Kayuko Naj Tunich correlates with the establishment of monumental architecture at Uxbenka, and its use is likely linked to early elites from the site. 
Discussion 
All of our evidence points to Uxbenka being a small, likely farming, community during the Late Preclassic. While the exact size and age of the founding community remains under investigation, one of the primary loci of settlement was posi­tioned on the hill that later developed as the stela plaza (Group A) of the Classic Period center. Exca­vations have revealed and dated Preclassic contexts that suggest the early occupants of the site built dirt mounds capped with thin, tamped marl or plaster floors containing postholes, consistent with per­ishable structures that date elsewhere in Mesoamer­ica to the Middle Preclassic (Flannery 1976; Willey 1977). Prior to our research project, a Middle Pre­classic jade spoon was found by a caretaker in Group A near to a looted Classic Period tomb, but it lacks more specific provenience (Healy and Awe 2001). Our excavations produced no evidence of significant status differences (e.g., differing house sizes or elite burials) in these contexts, and no evi­dence of public architecture dates to this early time. 
The Group A hilltop is an ideal location for ini­tial settlements in the region; it is defensible (though we have no evidence of conflict), commands a view over the Rio Blanco Valley, is located adjacent to lands that are fertile and desirable for agriculture, and is close to year-round water supplies. Today,

local farmers vie for access to these lands immedi­ately surrounding the site, which are favored for both milpa (slash and bum) and matambre (mulching) agriculture, allowing for crops to be grown every year without faltering. In the small valley below Groups A, B, and F, some farmers grow two crops of com in a single year and have marked this area with an indigenous land-use mapping project as the location of most agricultural lands (TMCC 1997). 
The same criteria that made this region favor­able for early settlements would have continued to make it an ideal location for later development. After A.D. 200, Group A underwent a major reor­ganization and Group B was integrated into the built environment. The process may have taken more than a century. Significant changes included landscape modification in the form of leveling hill­tops and filling hillslopes. It also involved the trans­port of hundreds of thousands of cut sandstone blocks from nearby creeks and outcrops for mon­umental buildings. At least three of these buildings were constructed over earlier dirt structures. In addition, at least one settlement compound was buried under several tons of crushed bedrock, effec­tively erasing it from the landscape. This time period marks a radical shift in elite strategies reflected in the ability to mobilize labor for con­struction projects. While it remains possible that this expansion represents an intrusive force enter­ing the region, we have no evidence of disjunction or abandonment, and the continuity of use in Group A suggests indigenous development rather than some kind of intrusive population. Regardless, it seems likely that local populations would have been directly involved in the labor-intensive reconfigu­ration of Group A. This time period also represents a fundamental shift in the Group A plaza from a village settlement to a public ceremonial space.

Texts and iconography from carved monuments also serve as another source of information on the development of the Uxbenka polity. The produc­tion of monuments glorifying the actions of indi­vidual rulers and elaborating their exclusionary relationships with supernatural forces is an indi­cator of a shift toward highly exclusionary, or net­work, strategies being employed by elites (Blanton et al. 1996:12; Feinman 2001:170). At Uxbenka the first carved monuments do not appear until at least 100 years after the Early Classic construc­tion began in Groups A and B and monuments continued to be erected into the eighth century. All of the known stelae are located in the Group A plaza, suggesting it became a monument garden glorifying living rulers and their linkage to the ancestral founders of the community and, ulti­mately, the land. The earliest dated monument fragment is Ste la 23, which records an Initial Series date of9. l.0.0.0 6Ajaw 13 Yaxkin, or 25th August, AD. 455, and is carved in a decidedly central Peten style (Prufer and Wanyerka 2005). Another monument, Stela 11, does not record a specific cal­endar age, but is stylistically similar to Early Clas­sic monuments from the central Peten. It also contains the personal moniker of Chak Tok Ich' aak I or "Jaguar Paw" the fourteenth king of the Tikal royal dynasty, who ascended to rulership in AD. 360 and was recorded as having died following a major political upheaval at Tikal in AD. 378 (Stu­art 2000:479-48 1). The stela has been interpreted as containing information about an event contem­poraneous to its creation, as opposed to a retro­spective event, and also contains several specific references to the Tikal royal dynasty (Wanyerka 2009:270-275). 
Several questions surround the nature ofTikal's relationship with Uxbenka during the Early Clas­sic. Was Tikal involved in the shift at Uxbenka from a village to a complex polity? Was the relationship a form of economic hegemony? Did the Uxbenka rulers maintain political and economic indepen­dence, or were they a tributary state under Tikal's direct rule? Our data suggest that Uxbenka 's ini­tial shift from a village to a hierarchically-organized polity Gccurred at least a century prior to Tikal's hegemonic southward expansion recorded else­where. Tikal was an expansionist polity during the latter part of the Early Classic and appears to have played a role in founding the Copan dynasty in AD. 426 (Sharer 2003:322). While it has been pro­posed that Uxbenka was an Early Classic vassal of Tikal, and may have been utilized by Tikal for access to trade routes or extraction of local resources (Wanyerka 2009:224), there is little archaeological evidence for such a relationship. Ceramics from dated Early Classic contexts gen­erally resemble those found during the Late Pre­classic period, consistent with Laporte's observations that, in the southeastern Peten, Pre­classic forms persist well into the Early Classic in what he calls the "Peripheral Chicanel" sphere (2001: 17). We suggest that local production of ceramics with brownish-red slips and waxy surface textures generally characteristic of the Late Pre­classic continued well beyond AD. 300 in south­ern Belize, and we see no evidence of Makin Phase ceramics from Tikal and very little evidence of cen­tral Peten Tzakol 1 sphere materials in Early Clas­sic contexts. 
Nevertheless, the epigraphic data clearly refer to a relationship between Tikal and Uxbenka. Whether this was an economically driven hege­monic relationship remains to be tested, and archae­ological evidence of economic ties between the two polities is limited. It is also important to con­sider alternatives. Small monument-bearing poli­ties might have periodically formed alliances with larger states, but were essentially autonomous cen­ters of political development, perhaps emulating their larger neighbors. Similarly, larger polities may have fluctuated between attempts at centralization and expansion (occasionally successful) and some­what weaker political interactions, as has been pro­posed in Marcus's "Dynamic Model" (Marcus 1993:133-137, 1998:92). Adam Smith (2003: 136-139) suggests that, within a given system, three non-exclusive external processes can be seen as contributing to the rise of new political centers (also see M. Smith 2003: 18): authorization, the direct control by a larger and prior polity; memo­rialization, which can be triumphal or attest to sym­bolic subjugation; or, emulation, the competitive and potentially imitative production of social forms and symbols derived from more prestigious and powerful centers. At Uxbenka we see no material evidence of authorization by larger polities at any point in its early history and instead suggest a com­bination of emulation and memorializing may have played a role in the site's early development.

Conclusions 
The data presented here suggest that U xbenka had humble beginnings as a hilltop village commu­nity, founded on some of the most productive agri­cultural lands in the region, with easy access to coastal and montane resources. During the Late Preclassic period an absence of significant status­differentiating goods or architecture indicates that early leadership may have been kin-based and inclusionary, existing on the corporate end of a cor­porate-network continuum of elite strategies. Start­ing around A.D. 200 Uxbenka began a significant transformation centered on what was likely the core area of the village. This was marked by the construction of public architecture and modifica­tion of the landscape to accommodate a new com­munity design. Whether these changes were entirely internal or they represent the appearance of an intrusive force remains unknown, though continuity with ceramic assemblages from earlier contexts suggests it may have been at least par­tially locally based. Regardless, these changes rep­resent a new political strategy for the region reflected in the ability of elites to mobilize signif­icant labor around capital projects. While the con­struction of the public plaza and the mobilization of labor certainly reflect hierarchical differentia­tion, during this time period we see no evidence of exclusionary strategies being exercised by elites; there is no evidence of elaborate residential struc­
tures, large accumulations of status marking goods, or iconography that is self-aggrandizing. 
By no later than the middle of the fifth century, Uxbenka started participating in the Classic Period monument-building tradition, erecting stelae in Group A attesting to the individual prowess of named elites and their connections with powerful rulers elsewhere in other larger city centers (e.g., Tikal). The transformation of the Group A hilltop from a residential space to a public monument gar­den celebrating revered ancestors suggests both continuity of occupation and the memorialization of ancestral space as an elite strategy. Hence, the transformation of the hilltop space may have had as much to do with legitimizing the authority of emergent elites as with their ability to monopolize choice patches of land. While this memorialization may have begun earlier, during the centuries when Uxbenka changed from a small farming commu­nity to a more complex political center the adop­tion of the monument tradition represents a clear shift in elite strategies to one in which individual named rulers asserted their legitimacy on publically visible media. 
The establishment of Kayuko Naj Tunich Cave is contemporaneous with Early Classic develop­ments in the site core. Transporting raw materials and the construction of architectural modifications in the cave would have required a considerable labor force. The construction and use of the cave, perched on a cliff on a prominent mountain and vis­ible from all the public spaces in the community, would have been a powerful sign of elite ability to manipulate powerful and ancient symbols repre­senting forces in the universe responsible for human welfare and success (Brady and Prufer 2005). The cave was remodeled several times during the Early Classic, and, along with the monuments in Group A, would have served as a constant reminder of the ancestral connections and supernatural powers claimed by ruling elites (Moyes and Prufer 2009). 
Research currently underway at Uxbenka sug­gests that the Late Classic reorganization of the polity was at least as dramatic as the Early Clas­sic. Massive landscape modification characterized changes as the public areas of the site grew to their final configuration. Data suggest that growing num­bers of elites established settlements away from the site core, while smaller household groups were pushed further into the hinterlands, possibly onto more marginal lands in terms of access to soils, year-round water sources, and proximity to the community center. Kayuko Naj Tunich shows no evidence ofuse after A.D. 600, suggesting changes in elite strategies for appropriating symbolic capi­tal. The stela plaza continued to be used for erect­ing monuments at least through the middle of the eighth century, but no new construction programs were undertaken after A.D. 500. Instead, it appears to have served as a monument garden dedicated to the founding ancestors, while the focus of politi­cal power shifted to Group B. The Late Classic landscape would have been markedly different, with at least six other monument-bearing sites within 30 km of Uxbenka, and over 40 smaller communities with public architecture crowding the landscape. Uxbenka would have continued to dom­inate the Rfo Blanco drainage and the most expe­dient trade route from the Caribbean Sea and the

eastern Maya Mountains into the Peten, and eco­nomic demands of that core area may have driven the rapid Late Classic growth in southern Belize. By the middle of the ninth century the region was in decline. It remains to be determined if this decline was in response to tumultuous events and waning fortunes in neighboring regions or the conse­quences of local population growth, resource exhaustion, and general failure of elites to withstand the pressures of their highly networked geopoliti­cal and social landscapes.

Note 
1. After removing adhering sediment, samples were sub­ject to acid/base/acid washes in lN HCl and lN NaOH !70°C; 30 min). The initial acid wash dissolved any carbon­ate contamination and repeated base \'.'ashes extracted humates accumulated from soil organic matter. A final acid wash removed secondary carbonates formed during the base treatment. Samples were then returned to neutral pH with two 15 min baths in DI water at 70°C to remove chlorides and dried. Sample C02 was produced by combustion at 900°C for 6 hours in sealed evacuated quartz tubes using CuO powder and Ag wire. Sample C02 was graphitized at UCI KCCAMS by reduction at 550°C using H2 and a Fe catalyst, with reac­tion water drawn off with Mg(Cl04)z (Santos et al.. 2004). Solid graphite samples were pressed into targets in Al boats and loaded on the target wheel with standards and back­grounds for AMS analysis.
