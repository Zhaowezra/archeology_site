WHEN WAS THE SUN PYRAMID BUILT? 
MAINTAINING THE STATUS QUO AT TEOTIHUACAN, MEXICO 

Rebecca Sload 
The traditional view based on ceramics is that construction of the Sun Pyramid at Teotihuacan c'lmmenced in the first century A .D. Likewise, radiocarbon dates from the artificial cave beneath the Pyramid indicate that it was created at about the same time. Both Pyramid and cave are seen as having a role in the founding of the city. Recent excavation inside the Pyramid produced radiocarbon dates that cluster in the mid-third century A.D. Members of the Sun Pyramid Project inter­preted the dates as representing initial construction of the structure, moving it significantly later in time than previously thought. They also reinterpreted the dates for the construction of the cave, making it contemporaneous with the revised Pyramid construction. This paper adds radiocarbon dates from the cave to the original set and employs Bayesian analysis. The initial interpretation is supported: the dates reflect a cycle of cave creation through termination that began in the mid­first century and lasted about 200 years. I interpret the dates from the Pyramid as reflecting ritual associated with cave ter­mination and a concomitant redefinition of the Pyramid that involved architectural modifications and tunneling. Pyramid and cave dates are reconciled with each other, with ceramics, and with the ceramic chronology. The traditional timing of first century Pyramid construction is maintained, along with its social, political, and economic implications.

the first century A.D. to around the beginning of 
the third, "much later than previously suggested" 
(Sugiyama et al. 2013:428). This article reiterates 
the traditional viewpoint of a first-century initia­
tion of construction of both Pyramid and cave , 
and it offers a corresponding interpretation of the 
PPS dates. 
The timing of construction of the Sun Pyramid has implications that extend beyond the monument itself. Sugiyama et al. (2013:429) propose con­temporaneous construction at Teotihuacan's three largest pyramids-the Sun Pyramid, the Feathered Serpent Pyramid (FSP), and the Moon Pyramid­during a "period of rapid monumental expansion" that occurred on a "massive scale between A.D. 170-310 ." Moving the construction of the Sun Pyramid to the beginning of the third century con­tradicts the traditional view that Teotihuacan ur­banism developed during the first two centuries 
A.D. as a result of rapid population growth linked to construction of the gigantic Sun Pyramid (Cowgill 1992, 2000; Millon 1981, 1992). 
Background 
Sun Pyramid 
One of the earliest references to the Sun Pyramid is Almaraz (1865), who measured the Pyramid before Batres' reconstruction early in the twentieth century. The removal of thousands of tons of soil and stones from the Pyramid during reconstruction (Bastien 1967:62; El Imparcial 1995:122 [1906]) does not appear to have been symmetrical . Batres (1995: 101-102 [1906)) found remains of the stair­cases of the Pyramid on the front or western faade, suggesting that he altered this face less than the other three. Sugiyama (2010:Figure 11.5) offers support: one of the east-west measurements of the outer Pyramid is close to Almaraz's mea­surement of 224 m. 
Other projects also focused on the exterior of the Pyramid. In 1966, as part of INAH's Proyecto Teotihuacan, Acosta (1966:12) cleared the plaza in front of the Pyramid and found the original staircase of the adosada platform. Matos's (1995) IN AH Proyecto Especial Teotihuacan 1992-1994 worked on a large scale, consolidating the enor­mous U-shaped platform that surrounds the Pyra­mid and establishing the relationship between them. Two minor excavations clarified the rela­tionship between the current Pyramid and the outer Pyramid. Also as part of the Proyecto Teoti­huacan, a trench dug by Salazar cut into the north side of the Pyramid (Smith 1987:Figures 6-7). Millon's Teotihuacan Mapping Project (TMP) test excavation (TE) 16 subsequently cut into the southeast corner of the Pyramid (Millon 1970:23). In both cases, ceramics indicated that the outer Pyramid was probably built during the Late Tlamimilolpa phase (Millon 1970:24; Smith 1987:258). 
A number of projects examined the interior of the Pyramid on the east-west centerline. The two largest were INAH tunnels at the base of the Pyra­mid. Beginning in 1917 , Gamio excavated from the back or east face, and in 1933, Noguera entered the Pyramid from the west under the staircases (Figure l; Gamio 1922; Noguera 1935; Perez 1935). Noguera (1935:53) noted that the ceramic fill of the adosada platform dates later than the fill from the Pyramid itself. Rattray (2001:375) dates construction of the adosada platform to Early Tlamimilolpa times, while Millon (1992:393) places it in the Miccaotli phase, slightly earlier than the FSP in the Ciudadela. 
Inside the tunnels dug by Gamio and Noguera, Kroeber dug a number of pits to collect additional ceramics, and Valliant, Bastien, and possibly oth­ers excavated short exploratory tunnels near the center of the Pyramid (Millon et al. 1965: 16-18) . In the summer of 1959, Millon and Drewitt in­vestigated the tunnels. A stone-faced wall, the pur­pose of which has yet to be determined, was found in association with an offering in the tunnel dug by Noguera (Millon et al. 1965:21-25, Figures 37-40). Acosta tunneled north and south of the wall, perpendicular to Noguera's tunnel. The pro­ject was completed by Smith (1987:4, Table 27). Between 2008 and 2011, the PPS excavated the floor of Noguera's tunnel, digging parallel or per­pendicular supplementary tunnels as needed (Sugiyama et al. 2013). All excavations found that ceramics in the first cuerpo of the Pyramid dated almost exclusively to Tzacualli (Teotihuacan I; Millon 1970:22;Millonetal. 1965:6-7;Noguera 1935; Rattray 2001:Table 5; Smith 1987:4, Table 27; Sugiyama et al. 2013:429, Table 1). For every­one except Sugiyama and colleagues, this trans­lated into a Tzacualli phase construction for the bulk of the Pyramid.

adosada platform 

Two projects investigated the east-west cen­terline at higher elevations. In 1962, Smith (1987 :5) tunneled from the east to the approximate center of the Pyramid at the base of the fifth cuerpo (Figure 1). Ninety-five percent of ceramics dated to Tzacualli; Miccaotli and Tlamimilolpa were minor components (Smith 1987:Table 27). This work indicated that the majority of the Pyra­mid dates to Tzacualli and that the top appears a bit later. 
TMP TE22 corroborated the scenario. In 1968 a 4-m-deep test pit was made in the floor of Smith's tunnel (Figure 1; Millon 1970:22; Rattray 2001 :55). At a depth of about 2 m a great earthen talud with a mud plaster surface began to appear in the south wall (Millon 1992:Figure 5). The talud gradually sloped down to the north for 2 m until it nearly filled the pit and forced excavation to stop (Millon 1970:22). The talud indicated the existence of a buried structure with a base that rested ap­proximately on the top of the Pyramid's third cuerpo (Figure 1). Location, shape, size, and fin­ished surface pointed to a temple base on the sum­mit of an earlier Pyramid. Twin temples almost certainly existed, as determined by the presence of an east-west talud located just south of the cen­terline of the Pyramid sloping down to the north (Millon 1992:360, 390, Figure 5). This implies both a corresponding east-west talud sloping down to the south near the south edge of the top of the third cuerpo and a corresponding temple platform just north of the east-west centerline. Both the change in ceramic composition and the existence of sizable structures on top of the Pyramid's third cuerpo indicate that the fourth and fifth cuerpos were later additions. These facts, as well as the later ceramic fill in the adosada platform, are im­portant to the hypothesis presented here. 
Cave 

INAH archaeologists accidentally discovered the cave beneath the Pyramid in 1971. For more than two decades it was thought to be a natural forma­tion, a lava tube, as evaluated by Mooser (Heyden 1975:131). Geophysical surveys demonstrated that the cave was human-made (Chavez et al. 2001; Manzanilla 1994; Manzanilla et al. 1994; Man­zanilla et al. 1996). Regardless, few dispute that the location of the cave on the east-west centerline of one of the largest pyramids in the world indi­cates a ritual function. The idea that the artificial cave of the Sun Pyramid was the most important mountain cave (Alfaro et al. 2003:494) fits with a growing body of evidence that suggests ancient Mesoamericans did not distinguish between nat­ural and human-made ritual caves. Both func­tioned interchangeably as key elements of the cos­mos (Brady 1997, 2003a, 2003b, 2012; Brady and Ashmore 1999; Brady and Veni 1992; Moyes 2013). Conquest period texts make the same point. The Aztecs identified eight types of caves, ac­cording to Sahagun (1963:275-277). Two types, Xaloztotl and Tepetlaoztotl, were clearly human­made and yet bore the same Nahua word for cave, 
oztotl, as the other six. The apparent emic view­point of no distinction is adopted here, and the artificial cave is referred to simply as a cave be­cause that was its function. 
Soon after discovery, INAH cleared the 6.5­m-deep entrance shaft of the rubble that had sealed the cave since the last prehistoric visitors and commenced a multi-year program of consolidation

and exploration. The former made the cave safe for entry. INAH installed a metal staircase and electric lights and cleared the centers of the block­ages to ground level. It erected a block-and-tackle system at the cave entrance to remove the sub­stantial amount of surface material, which was reported as "truckloads" and as containing nothing important (Millon 1981:233-234). Exploration included Acosta's excavation of the terminus, the most significant findings of which are reported by Heyden (1973 , 1975 , 1981) .

Conundrum 
The PPS assumed at the outset of excavation tha1 material from the lowest levels of the Pyramic would date its initial construction, estimated a 100-150 A.D. during the Tzacualli phase (Sarabi< and Sugiyama 2011:10). Six of the seven PP Pyramid dates did not meet expectations: thq consistently date to the mid-third century (Tabh 1), significantly later than Tzacualli (Figure 3) The conundrum is resolved by proposing that con struction of the Sun Pyramid occurred "over < century later" than currently assumed (Sugiyam< et al. 2013:429). Sugiyama et al. (2013:416, 428 view Pyramid construction as "a long process' that occurred around the beginning of the thirc century within a time frame of A.D. 170-310. 
The core of the issue is how to reconcile the unexpectedly late radiocarbon dates with the Tza· cualli fill of the Pyramid and the ceramic chronol· ogy (Figure 3). Sugiyama et al. eschew the tradi· tional method of dating the Pyramid, whereby th<

Moon Pyramid Building 4 (Sugiyama et al . 20 13:429). 
The FSP was most likely built during the Early Tlamimilolpa phase (Cowgill 2003:319; Cowgill and Cabrera 1991; Gazzola 2009:227). Moon Pyramid Building 4 was built at the same time or perhaps at the end of Miccaotli, depending upon whether ceramic fill or radiocarbon dates are the primary guiding tool (Sugiyama 2010:141; Sugiyama and Cabrera 2007: 120, Tables 1-2). Sugiyama and colleagues imply that old Tzacualli fill was used for the Sun Pyramid during the same time period that Miccaotli or Miccaotli/Early Tlamimilolpa fill was being used in the other two pyramids. This seems unlikely. 
Surface construction at Teotihuacan relied on the constant reuse of material from local dumps (Rattray 2001 :43). As a result, undisturbed strati­fied deposits often contain ceramics from phases earlier than the actual phase of construction. While assignment of building phases based on ceramic fill is thus not entirely precise, it is the method used to date virtually all substantial construction at Teotihuacan. It is the traditional basis for dating the Sun Pyramid, as seen above. Rattray (2001) used it to date construction associated with the nu­merous TMP test excavations. It established con­struction sequences at monuments like the FSP and Moon Pyramid that have a series of radiocar­bon dates (Sugiyama 1998:149, Table 13.1; Sugiyama and Cabrera 2007). Ceramic stratigraphy produced chronological orderings of construction sequences that underlie our understanding of the life cycle of the city. Sugiyama and colleagues suggest that the Sun Pyramid is an exception. 
The Sun Pyramid is immense , with an esti­mated volume of 1,270,000 m3 (Barba and Cor­dova 2010:Apendice G). This is about four times larger than the final Moon Pyramid (Building 7), estimated at 329,000 cubic meters, and 35 times larger than the FSP, estimated at 36,000 cubic me­ters (Barba and Cordova 2010:Apendice G). At least four independent projects at the Sun Pyramid found that 95-100 percent of ceramics date to Tzacualli. Combined with the pattern of constant reuse of refuse, it seems unlikely that the massive fill requirements of the Sun Pyramid were met exclusively through the use of previously ignored Tzacualli dumps, while the simultaneous fill re­quirements of the much smaller Moon Pyramid Building 4 and FSP were met through the use of contemporary Miccaotli/Early Tlamimilolpa dumps . 
The solution to the conundrum is to hypothe­size that the "late" PPS dates do not mark initial construction of the Pyramid. Rather, they date rit­uals associated with cave termination and a con­comitant redefinition of the Pyramid that involved additions of the adosada platform and the fourth and fifth cuerpos. This interpretation maintains the traditional viewpoint that Tzacualli fill indi­cates Tzacualli construction. Exposition begins with the TE28 radiocarbon dates. 
TE28 Radiocarbon Dates 
Sload (2007) hypothesizes a timeline for cave cre­ation, use, and termination that begins around the middle of the first century AD. and ends about the middle of the third. Analysis is rooted in the position that undisturbed cave contexts represent Teotihuacano behavior. Sugiyama and colleagues disagree and eliminate from analysis more than half of the original TE28 dates. They assert that it is difficult to date construction and use of the cave due to its "highly disturbed context" and "lack of many primary contexts" (Sugiyama et al . 2013:425). Indications are that neither argument applies to the TE28 radiocarbon-dated charcoal. 
Not all areas of the cave are equally disturbed. The most affected areas are the two ends. Acosta completely excavated the terminus (Figure 4a).

(b) cave entrance, with the Teotihuacan step (chalk mark on riser), foot of the modern staircase, and large INAH consol­idation masonry on the south wall (patch is lighter); and (c) cave entrance, with first flight of modern staircase and talud excavated by the PPS, defined by wood beam at top and INAH patch at base (light colored masonry; all photographs by 
Rebecca Sload [1978), copyright Rene Millon). 
The entrance underwent substantial consolidation work, summarized above, as well as at least two excavations or patches (Figure 4b-c). 
Evidence is elusive to support claims of heavy looting during Teotihuacan times (Sugiyama 2011:185, 188-190; Sugiyama et al. 2013:407­408), or at any other point. The only known fact about the possibility of looting is Heyden 's (1975: 131) comment that, at the time of cave dis­covery, the blockages had openings in their upper halves apparently made "long ago by vandals." The two TMP ceramic collections-TE28 (273 sherds) and the 1976 surface collection (148 sherds)-contain no ceramics later than Early Tlamimilolpa that cannot be ex.plained as ex situ. Most "late" cave ceramics were found near the entrance, suggesting introduction probably as a result of consolidation . While people clearly en­tered the cave between the time it was blocked off and modem discovery, their intentions are un-

Beneath it a Teotihuacan concrete floor (made of compact earth mixed with an ag­gregate of gravel composed of crushed volcanic scoria) runs essentially the length of the cave, from the entrance to at least as far as Blockage 2 near the terminus (Figures 4b and Sa; Sload 2007:Figures 6, 8, 12, 13).1 The concrete floor provides an effective barrier against casual intru­sion. It is inaccurate to designate as looted those contexts found beneath an intact concrete floor or in undisturbed areas beneath cleared blockages, because clearing occurred during consolidation. TE28 encountered minor pits, one of which con­tained a nail (Altschul l 978a:38), but intrusions were neither widespread nor particularly destruc­tive of stratigraphy other than in the terminus (Figure 2, Area B). 
Multiple lines of evidence indicate that Teoti­huacanos laid the concrete floor and built the blockages contemporaneously. Concrete covers the west but not the east faces of blockages, and concrete flooring does not exist beneath blockages (Supplemental Figure 1). Integrity exists between blockages and concrete floor and between cave walls and blockages (Figure 5; Supplemental Fig­ure 1). Mud mortar bonds the rocks that form the cores of blockages (Figure 5). Drewitt (1978) found it adhering to the middle of the cave ceiling at Blockage 16. Teotihuacanos built the blockages from floor to ceiling, and construction necessarily began in the terminus. They sealed evidence of initial use beneath the concrete floor (Sload 2011), and they blocked off the cave east of the Trans­verse Chambers (Figure 2). Teotihuacan concrete effectively closed the cave . It is hypothesized to be the final step in the ritual termination of the cave. 
The concrete floor thus separates the initial use of the cave-defined as all activity through termination-from use or entry occurring after­wards. The objective of TE28 was to explore the initial use. Excavation cut through the concrete floor and examined all content to the bedrock. Many "under the concrete" contexts remain undis­turbed, a situation in direct contrast to the highly disturbed areas of the entrance, terminus, and top of the concrete floor for the length of the cave. I dated TE28 charcoal to determine initial use, and the first selection criterion was undisturbed context (Sload 2007: 12).2 
Sugiyama et al. (20 13:425) contend that the cave lacks primary contexts. Surface archaeology at Teotihuacan was seen to be characterized by

the reuse of fill from local dumps. Nonetheless, multiple lines of evidence indicate that Teotihua­canos did not use redeposited fill in "under the concrete" contexts. The undisturbed cave ceramic assemblage is homogeneous: more than 95 percent phases to Tzacualli-Miccaotli, 87 percent of shapes are ollas or bowls, and fine wares are no­tably absent (Sload and Cowgill 2009). This uni­formity suggests that ceramics were not a com­ponent of fill, but rather represent use in the cave. 
"Under the concrete" layers are patterned. The TE28 field crew first noticed the consistency and established naming conventions. In general,"!" layers are surface deposits; "2" layers are the con­crete floor; "5" and "3" layers are cascajo (crushed volcanic scoria) fill that contains lesser amounts of silt, tepetate (indurated volcanic ash), and small volcanic rocks; and "4" layers are crushed tepetate with minor amounts of silt and cascajo. The layers were deposited sequentially. Supplemental Figure 2 illustrates a typical configuration. These con­sistencies indicate a purposefulness that is missing from redeposited fill. 
Another consideration is the origin of the ma­trices of "under the concrete" deposits. These are the "3," "4," and "5" layers that contain undis­turbed cultural material, including the dated TE28 charcoal. The cascajo, tepetate, and volcanic rocks that comprise the matrices are natural to the cave, as well as occurring below ground throughout the Teotihuacan Valley (Barba and Cordova 2010). Thus, their presence provides no indication as to whether they come from the excavation of the cave or were imported from elsewhere. But other factors do. 
In evaluating probable origin it must be re­membered that cave creation involved the removal of material, not the addition that occurred in sur­face construction. Geophysical surveys recorded clear signs of the extraction of cascajo-the pri­mary building material for surface architecture­from within the cave. This is actually one of the lines of evidence for establishing the artificial na­ture of the cave. While it is theoretically possible that Teotihuacanos brought in "under the concrete" matrices from another underground cavity, it seems more likely that they obtained the fill from inside the cave by knocking material off the walls and ceiling. 
The distinction is important because it impacts embedded cultural material. If the matrices of undisturbed layers are foreign to the cave, then their contents may represent extraneous behavior. If the matrices are indigenous to the cave, then embedded cultural material was likely brought into the cave deliberately, reflecting purpose and correct timing with respect to activities occurring in the cave. Excavation data support this line of thought (see the detailed discussion in Supple­mental Appendix l). 
All indications are that "under the concrete" cave deposits do not have the same characteris­tics as surface fill. Ceramics seem purposeful, and matrices are organized, patterned, and prob­ably of internal origin. Embedded artifacts are likely in the cave because of use in the cave. An added consideration for carbon is that the cave is almost entirely dark, except at the entrance, necessitating artificial light. The hypothesis is that "under the concrete" deposits are primary. They are not quite as informative about ancient behavior as in situ features because of some loss of context, but they are reliable for absolute dat­ing purposes. Combined with the fact that "under the concrete" deposits suffered little disturbance, the objections of Sugiyama et al. are unfounded. All dates from TE28 deserve consideration . 
Bayesian Modelling 
I used the OxCal 4.2 Bayesian statistical program to estimate absolute time frames for creation, use, and termination of the cave (Bronk Ramsey 2009). The sequential model was chosen. It assumes a chronological order to the groups in which one starts after the previous one ends, with the possi­bility of a gap. PPS dates (Sugiyama et al . 2013:Table 2) were modelled separately. The six "late" dates, PPS-1 through PPS-6, were one group. PPS-7 and PPS-8 were each set as a "group" of one, which produced identical calibrated and mod­elled la and 2a ranges for each sample. 
The Bayesian program used the lntCal l3 cali­bration curve and, for PPS-3, the Marine13 calibra­tion curve (Reimer et al. 2013). I ran multiple analy­ses using slightly different prior models of TE28 dates. The results support the reported posterior model. To confirm methodology, Sugiyama et al.'s (2013:423) model was first reproduced using the lntCal09 and Marine04 calibration curves they used.

Results are presented in two formats. Table 1 gives the dates organized by group. Each date is represented by two bars . The bottom bar is the un­modelled calibrated date and the top bar is the Bayesian modeled date. Each bar reports one and two standard deviations rounded to the nearest five years: lu is the shaded area and 2u the unshaded.

The data are used to evaluate the TE28 dates and their relationship to the PPS dates. 
TE28 Dates 
Charcoal was abundant in the cave, accounting for nearly one-third of the approximately 250 lots of cultural material collected by TE28. Equipped with the strong a priori suspicion that undisturbed layers represent primary contexts (Altschul 1978a:135), the goal of sample selection was to bracket "under the concrete" cave use. After de­termining undisturbed location, I chose samples that seemed to have the best chance of defining the beginning and ending of initial cave use (Sload 2007: 10-12). 
The results of the first iteration of radiocarbon dating were promising. Fifteen of the 16 charcoal samples were chronologically ordered as expected. The absolute dates indicated time frames for cave creation and termination corresponding to the mid­dle of the first and third centuries A.D., respec-

tively (Sload 2007:25-26, 28-29). Beta 220760 was the anomaly. It is discussed below. The four charcoal samples dated in 2009 indicated termi­nation activity, and that was their group identity for Bayesian analysis. 
The hypothesis is that the first four dates in Table 1 represent activity associated with cave creation and initial leveling of the floor, back-to­back operations that prepared the cave for use. The charcoal was in cascajo fill layers resting on bedrock. Represented areas are A, C, and D (Fig­ure 2). Table 1 shows that the modelled dates have a consistent la range of cal AD. 30-70175, and a 2a range of cal A.D. 015-90. Likewise, Figure 6 illustrates that cave creation most likely occurred during the middle decades of the first century AD. These results match the initial analysis and support the hypothesis that cave creation and ini­tial leveling of the floor were likely completed within several decades (Sload 2007:28). 
The next five dates in Table 1 have contexts amenable to use. Represented areas are B, C, and D (Figure 2). Supplemental Appendix 1 describes the excavation contexts. The modelled dates at 2a encompass the time period from cal A.D. 70 to the last decade of the second century. The la range is from around cal AD. 85 to 130. Likewise, Figure 6 indicates that cave use immediately fol­lowed cave creation and ended sometime during the second century. Because sample selection fo­cused on defining the two ends of initial cave use, it is likely that this middle period is underrepre­sented. Dating more "use" charcoal may expand the period. 
Eleven dates are hypothesized as relating to termination activities. Represented areas are A, B, C, and D. Sload (2007) discusses the contexts of the initial charcoal samples. Supplemental Ap­pendix 1 provides context for the 2009 samples. Modelled dates for termination at 2a span the pe­riod cal AD. 170 to 325 . The la range is cal AD. 213 to 274. Table 1 shows a consistent modelled mid-third century range for termination. Figure 6 also indicates that the highest probability for ter­mination is the middle of the third century. The initial hypothesis is supported. 
The last column in Table 1 gives the agreement index (A). It indicates the extent to which the pos­terior distribution overlaps with the original dis­tribution. A value under 60 indicates a possible er­ror in the stratigraphy (Bronk Ramsey 1995:427). Beta 266130 has an agreement index of 57 .2. Beta 266130 and Beta 266129 are charcoal samples dated in 2009 to help clarify Beta 220760. All three samples have "early" stratigraphic locations and "late" absolute dates. I hypothesize that the disconnect indicates that termination activity im­pacted fill to bedrock in this particular section of the cave (details are in Supplemental Appendix 1 and Supplemental Figure 3). 
Beta 266130 has a marginal agreement index because it is the latest TE28 date . When Beta 266130 is excluded from the Bayesian model, the most noticeable change occurs within the time pe­riod for termination. The separate minor peak dis­appears from the beginning boundary, and the time period becomes essentially the major peak from AD. 130-250 (Figure 6). For the end bound­ary, the beginning changes from AD. 235 to 180, while the end remains at AD. 350. The effect on boundaries is a larger overlap between the end of the beginning, which remains unchanged, and the beginning of the end, which moves earlier by 70 years (Figure 6). The duration of termination at 2a does not change. The interpretation that ter­mination occurred around the middle of the third century remains. 
Another effect of eliminating Beta 266130 from the model is that the next latest date, Beta 266127, becomes more nonconforming. Its agree­ment index changes from 87 .5 to 67 .4. As with Beta 266130, there are no grounds for doubting its undisturbed context. Since both dates have 2a ranges that fall within the hypothesized period of termination, the best model seems to be the one that includes all dates and is shown in Table 1. 
Another consideration in dating termination is Beta 220758 (Figure 7; Bronk Ramsey 2009). The sample was charcoal from the Layer 3a fire pit centered under Blockage 12 (Supplemental Figure 1). The fire pit was huge by cave standards, ex­tending 1 .75 m east-west and covering the entire excavated north-south dimension of the Area C West pit (Altschul 1978b:24). As discussed by Millon (1981:234, 1988, 1993:22), spatial and contextual data clearly indicate a ritual function associated with cave termination. Figure 7 shows that the fire pit most likely dates to the middle of the third century, agreeing with the modelled re­sults of the 11 hypothesized termination dates.

Several general comments support the cave model. Independent evidence indicates that the model is generalizable to unexcavated sections of the east-west cave path. A radar study of the cave showed that the path contains fill that has an av­erage depth of 70 cm (Barba 2009). Thus, the en­tire path of the cave appears modified. The model may have some mixing between use and termina­tion dates. This includes the possibility that some fire pits were used during both time periods. The practical effects are likely not serious because the calibrated but unmodelled dates for use and ter­mination trend chronologically, as expected (Table 1). The cave model seems fairly robust. The time span from cave creation through termination seems fairly well defined. Experiments with elim­inating some termination dates from the model did not result in changes that entail restating the model. Bayesian analysis of 20 TE28 radiocarbon dates does not change the initial interpretation based on 16 dates (Sload 2007). This supports 
Steier and Rom's (2000: 197) observation: "If the 
samples are already well resolved in time by the 14C measurement alone, the Bayesian sequence algorithm does not change the data." The cave model seems to comply. 
PPS Model 
The PPS obtained eight radiocarbon dates, seven from the Pyramid and one from the cave (Table 1). Six dates from the Pyramid, PPS-1 through PPS-6, are significantly later than the expected time frame of the Tzacualli ceramic phase, the first century AD. (Figure 3). Sugiyama and colleagues used Bayesian analysis to model these six dates as one group. The modelled la range was cal A.D. 169-308, which translates into the hypothesis that "the Sun Pyramid was constructed around A.D. 170-310" (Sugiyama et al. 2013:429). 
Sugiyama et al. (2013:412-419) construct phases to explain data from the PPS Pyramid ex­cavation. As its name implies, the "Pre-Sun Pyra­mid" phase encompasses features hypothesized as existing prior to construction of the Pyramid.

These include Floor 2 (PPS-I and PPS-2), Struc­ture 1, Floor 1, and Burial 2 (PPS-6). The "Con­struction of the Sun Pyramid" phase includes Bur­ial 3, Burial 4 (PPS-5), Offering 1 (PPS-3), and Offering 2. Figure 8 shows all features; cross-ref­erencing with Table 1 gives the dates. 
By definition, Bayesian modelling assumes that all members of a group belong to the same phase. Sugiyama and colleagues' model, however, mixes dates from the Pre-Sun Pyramid and Con­struction of the Sun Pyramid phases . They strati­graphically confirm that Burial 2 (PPS-6) pre-

dates the construction of Structure I (Sugiyama et al. 2013:415). Having a Pre-Sun Pyramid con­text and acceptable date , they include PPS-6 in 
the Bayesian model. This inconsistency is not 

addressed. 
PPS-7 also stratigraphically pre-dates Structure 1 (Sugiyama et al. 2013:425). Dating to Tzacualli, PPS-7 was the "only radiocarbon sample that agrees with the ceramic results" (Sugiyama et al . 2013:425). Having a Pre-Sun Pyramid context and an unacceptable date, it was excluded from the Bayesian model. Sugiyama et al.'s model does not reconcile their stratigraphic data to their dates. The following model does. 
A Unified Hypothesis 

The following hypothesis accepts that TE28 dates represent undisturbed behavior from the cave and that PPS Pyramid samples reflect "secure dates taken from primary contexts from either pre-Sun Pyramid or Sun Pyramid contexts" (Sugiyama et al. 2013:423). The explanation maintains the tra­ditional view that construction of the main mass of the Pyramid occurred during the Tzacualli phase. All dates are consistent with each other, the ceramics, and the ceramic chronology. 
Since the hypothesis focuses on the "late" PPS dates and their integration with TE28 dates, ex­position begins with the "early" PPS dates. These are PPS-7 from the Pyramid and PPS-8 from the cave (Table 1). PPS-7 can be interpreted as an in situ burning event occurring either at the outset of construction of the Tzacualli mass of the Pyra­mid or just before. PPS-7 corroborates the tradi­tional time frame for Pyramid construction. PPS­8 aligns more with TE28 cave use than with cave creation. Interpretation is difficult due to two types of contextual ambiguities.3 
Table 1 and Figure 6 visually indicate that the "late" PPS group aligns with the TE28 termination group. The conventional radiocarbon age (CRA) provides quantification. Setting aside PPS-3 be­cause it was shell and used a different calibration curve (which aligned the sample to the group), the "late" PPS samples have CRAs ranging from 1820 ± 40 to 1700 ± 40. These match almost ex­actly the range of the 11 cave termination dates, whose CRA range is 1830 ± 40 to 1700 ± 40 (Table I). The implication is that activity in the interior of the Pyramid corresponds to cave ter­mination. Is this possible? 
Tunneling 
In order for the "late" PPS dates to relate to cave 

termination activities, Teotihuacanos would have had to have tunneled into the base of the Pyramid. Before summarizing the evidence, it is important to understand the limitations of the data. 
At the time of Millon et al.'s (1965: 11) tunnel investigations in 1959, INAH was in the process of walling in the Noguera tunnel as a result of significant weakening caused by the 1957 earth­quake. The job was completed several years later (Millon et al. 1965: 11), and their publication pro­vides the only existing profile data for the tunnel. 
The Noguera tunnel is only 1.2 m wide, pro­ducing the practical effect of a single east-west cross section of the Pyramid (Millon et al. 1965:12). The ability to ascertain the existence of ancient Teotihuacano tunneling rests on the width of the Noguera tunnel capturing a dividing line between original fill of the Pyramid and the hy­pothesized refill resulting from a mid-third century tunneling operation. In that case, the north and south profiles of the Noguera tunnel would exhibit differences. If the Noguera tunnel was totally sub­sumed within the hypothesized Teotihuacan tun­nel, the profiles on both sides of the tunnel would likely be the same , reflecting the refilling. 


About 50 m from the entrance to the Noguera tunnel, an inclined plane appeared a short distance above the tunnel floor (Millon et al. 1965: 15). The slope of the plane rose gently but steadily to the east for 6.5 m. It reached a maximum height of 
1.35 m and ended at the stone-faced wall associated with the offering mentioned earlier (Millon et al. 1965:15). (This is Sugiyama et al.'s [2013:412] "Wall Consolidated by Millon.") The inclined plane appeared only in the north wall of the tunnel, not the south (Millon et al. 1965: 15). The covering fill seemed similar to the material found in the prior 17 m, while the south wall profile indicated fill containing more abundant ceramics and less sand (Millon et al. 1965: 15). It is of course possible that the differences reflect distinct but contempo­raneous fill sources, but it is also true that they could reflect two temporally separate fill opera­tions. The ramp remains unexplained.

around 80 m from the entrance of the Noguera tunnel (Sugiyama et al. 2013:425). It belongs to the "late" PPS group of dates (Table 1). Perez (1935:92) found five postholes between meters 56 and 80. These may indicate a tunneling opera­tion that required the use of supports in this section of the tunnel. Bastien excavated a tunnel near the center of the Pyramid around 1946 (before the earthquake), which Millon et al. (1965:16) found to be in good condition with no supports. The suggestion is that bracing may not have been needed throughout a Teotihuacano tunnel. 
Data are scant because of the complete walling in of the Noguera tunnel and the sampling nature of Sugiyama et al.'s (2013:412) excavation strat­egy. Given the limitations, it is surprising that possible indications exist ofTeotihuacano tunnel­ing. The possibility cannot be ruled out. 
Spatial Relationships of the "Late " PPS Dates 
In tracing the construction sequence of the Pyra­mid, it was seen that the adosada platform and fourth and fifth cuerpos were later additions. Ex­cept for the posthole, PPS features spatially align with the modifications (Figure 8). 
Millon first suggested that the adosada plat­form was built to seal the cave (Heyden 1975:134). Acosta's work in the plaza demon­strated that Teotihuacanos centered the staircase of the adosada platform on the cave entrance (Millon 1981 :231, Figure 7 .9). The staircase also aligns with the west end of the cave (Figure 9). PPS Floor 2 spans the junction between the adosada platform and the Pyramid, a location that also corresponds to the North and South Trans­verse Chambers in the cave (Figure 8).4 I hypoth­esize that these spatial relationships are deliberate. 
PPS Floor 2 had no apparent function, the east and west ends seemed deliberately cut, and a high concentration of broken artifacts occurred just be­yond the eastern end (Sugiyama et al. 2013:413). PPS-1 and PPS-2 are "late" dates from in situ burning on Floor 2 (Table 1; Sugiyama et al . 2013:Figure 5). Cutting, breaking, and burning are termination rituals at Teotihuacan . The hy­pothesis is that Floor 2, PPS-1, and PPS-2 associ­ate with rituals necessitated by cave termination. The location may indicate termination of the Tza­cualli Pyramid or of the meaning of the intersec­tion in the cave between the main east-west path and the North and South Transverse Chambers (Figure 8). 
Approximately contemporaneously with con­struction of the adosada platform, Teotihuacanos added two cuerpos to the top of the Pyramid as currently reconstructed. The addition did not sub­stantially increase the volume of the Pyramid be­cause the first cuerpo alone makes up about half the Pyramid's mass (Millon et al. 1965:12). This relatively minor modification created a major spa­tial dislocation between the cave and the Pyramid. Whereas the cave terminus reached the summit of the "old" Tzacualli Pyramid, now it no longer does (Figure 8). Adding cuerpos to the Pyramid effectively moved the cave terminus out of the "center." 
I hypothesize that Offering 2 commemorated this event (Figure 8). Offering 2 is not dated, but it was the richest offering found by the PPS (Sara­bia and Sugiyama 2011; Sugiyama et al. 2013:417--418,428). The quality of Offering 2 is matched by multiple significant spatial alignments. Offering 2 aligns with the cave terminus, even to the extent that both are south of the centerline (Figure 8). Offering 2 also aligns with the junction of the third and fourth cuerpos. The location is the point at which the "old" Pyramid meets the "new," and it was the summit prior to cave termi­nation . A mask in Offering 2 suggests a termina­tion ritual. The right cheek and eye appear to be pierced by a series of miniature projectile points (Sugiyama et al. 2013:417, Figure 11 ). 
Beyond Offering 2, several PPS features have "late" dates (Table 1): Offering 1 (PPS-3), Burial 2 (PPS-6), and Burial 4 (PPS-5). The features spa­tially align with the fifth cuerpo and are well east of the cave terminus (Figure 8). The hypothesis is that they reflect a ritual that dedicated the "new" Pyramid summit. 
"Late" PPS features have spatial relationships with contemporaneous Pyramid modifications. The hypothesis is that the decision to terminate the cave necessitated a concomitant redefinition of the Pyramid. Teotihuacanos accomplished this in two ways: architectural modification and tun­neling. Modifications to the Pyramid blocked off access to the cave (Figure 9) and changed the spa­tial relationship between the cave and the Pyramid (Figure 8). Tunneling on the east-west centerline of the Pyramid at ground level permitted a ritual

deemed necessary to terminate the mountain cave and dedicate the "new" Pyramid sans cave. "Late" PPS features captured this ritual. The number and patterning of spatial and temporal relationships between cave architecture, Pyramid architecture, and PPS features suggest that Teotihuacanos cre­ated sacred space by establishing spatial relation­ships and terminated the sacred space by severing these relationships. 
Conclusion 

My hypothesis has multiple components. It main­tains that all PPS and TE28 radiocarbon dates re­flect undisturbed archaeological contexts . The TE28 dates indicate that cave creation, use, and termination occurred over a period of about 200 years, from approximately the middle of the first century A.D. to the middle of the third. Construc­tion of the main mass of the Pyramid commenced contemporaneously with cave creation in the first century A.D. "Late" PPS radiocarbon dates reflect modifications to the Pyramid occurring as a result of cave termination. The decision to terminate the cave produced a multi-pronged and well-coordi­nated termination of the Tzacualli phase Pyramid as well. 
Retaining the traditional time frame for con­struction of the Sun Pyramid during the Tzacualli ceramic phase maintains its hypothesized impact on the process of city and state formation. Tradi­tionally, these processes have been most clearly ascertained by population changes and monumen­tal architecture (Cowgill 2004, 2007; Millon 1981, 1988; Sanders et al. 1979:303). Explosive popu­lation growth occurred during Tzacualli times (Cowgill 1992:97-98). At the beginning of the Tzacualli phase, the city covered an area of roughly 8 km2 and had a population estimated be­tween 20 ,000 and 40 ,000 individuals (Cowgill 1997:133). By ca. A.D. 200 the city covered around 20 km2 and had a population estimated at 80,000-100,000 (Cowgill 2004:533). Not much later, Teotihuacan attained its maximum popula­tion of around 125 ,000, becoming more dense but not growing much beyond the urban area estab-

lished during the Tzacualli phase (Cowgill 1997:129-130; Millon 1992:344). 
Other population patterning suggests causality linked to the Sun Pyramid. The last pre-Teotihua­can ceramic phase in the Teotihuacan Valley is Cuanalan (ca. 500-150 B.C.). The largest known Cuanalan period settlement had a maximum pop­ulation of 1,000-2,000 and a location affording good access to the perennial springs in the Valley (Cowgill 1992:Figure 5 .1, 89-90, 2000:262). Dur­ing Patlachique, the first Teotihuacan ceramic phase, settlement in the Valley abruptly shifted more than 2 km further north (Cowgill 1992:Fig­ure 5 .1, 2000:262). The clear shift away from the easily understood Cuanalan location to one that sacrificed easy access to prime farmland and had no obvious defensive advantage (Cowgill 2000:262) requires other explanation. The Pat­lachique settlement pattern foreshadowed that of Tzacualli (Cowgill 1992:96). It may be partially explained by a "'sacred mountain' syndrome" (Cowgill 1992:93) that fully materialized in Tza­cualli times with the construction of the mountain cave at the Sun Pyramid. During the Tzacualli period, settlement depopulation occurred repeat­edly throughout the Basin of Mexico concomitant with the concentration of population at Teotihua­can (Cowgill 2004:533). Although the reasons for the location of Teotihuacan are not understood, it is likely that the population movement was related to the initiation of construction of the "enormous" Sun Pyramid (Cowgill 2000:262). 
The traditional view is evolutionary. Beginning in the first or second century B .C. Teotihuacan began to grow, becoming in less than 500 years one of the largest cities in the world (Millon 1993:33). At its height, the polity was a regional state or possibly a hegemonic empire (Cowgill 2004:529, 2007). The Sun Pyramid was likely the locus of power during the Tzacualli phase (Cowgill 1992:99), followed by a shift in Early Tlamimilolpa times to the Ciudadela and the FSP (Cowgill 1983:336, 1992; Millon 1992:390-395; Pasztory 1993:4µ7, 50; Sugiyama 2005:39). The political, social, and economic changes oc­curring during the Tzacualli phase had an ideational component linked to the Pyramid and cave (Millon 1981:231-232). The traditional view provides a behavior-and belief-based mechanism for early city and state formation at Teotihuacan. 
It is supported by a model for the Sun Pyramid and cave in which ceramic chronology and cave and Pyramid ceramics, spatial alignments, and ra­diocarbon dating are all in agreement.

Notes 

1. 
Labeling of blockages follows the TMP practice, which continued that of Baker et al. (197 4). It reflects the order of blockage construction, with numbering starting at the terminus and continuing westward. Sugiyama et al. (2013:Figure 1) re­verse the labeling, numbering the last built as the first. Evidence for the existence of Blockage I is inconclusive. 

2. 
See Sload (2007:12, 21-24) for an explanation of sample selection in Area B, which has no concrete floor. 


3. 
PPS-8 consisted of "carbon fragments" found within the nucleus of the talud that defines the west end of the cave (Sugiyama 20 13:428). INAH patched the base of the talud during consolidation and xploration (Figure 4c) , introducing 


one type of contextual ambiguity. The second relates to the fill matrix of PPS-8, which is described as tepetate, rocks, stones, lenses of dirt, sand, carbon, and artifacts, mostly ce­ramics (Sugiyama et al. 20 13 :408). This description sounds more like redeposited surface fill than undisturbed "under the concrete" "3," "4" or "5" layer matrices. While PPS-8 aligns, interpretation is much less clear than for TE28 dates, as dis­cussed in Sload (2007) and here. 
4. The Moon Pyramid Project's total station map of the Sun Pyramid cave (Sugiyama 20ll; Sugiyama and Sarabia 20 11) made minor changes to the TMP map, if considered relative to the huge mass of the Pyramid. The Bonfil and Oteo map published by Heyden (1975:Figure 1) has the cave length at 103 m; the TMP map, 100 m (MiEon 1981:231); the new map, 97 m (Sugiyama and Sarabia 201 1:44). Superposing any of these maps onto the front face of the Pyramid changes little regarding the spatial relationships between cave and Pyramid. This is especially true if it is remembered that the most im­portant factor is the connections Teotihuacanos believed they had achieved. Figure 8 schematically reflects the most recent data.
