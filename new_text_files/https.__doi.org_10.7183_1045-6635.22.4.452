THE DOMESTICATION AND EARLY SPREAD OF MANIOC (MAN/HOT 

ESCULENTA CRANTZ): A BRIEF SYNTHESIS 

Christian Isendahl 

Owing to poor preservation of organic remains in humid environments, direct evidence of early manioc (Mani hot esculenta Crantz) cultivation is exceptionally rare in datable archaeological contexts, Recent research summarized here offers 
new insights into the spatio-temporal framework of the initial domestication and early spread of manioc in the Neotropics. lnte­grating evidence from comparative plant genetics and paleoethnobotanic starch analysis to contribute to the archaeology of manioc origins, this review finds that (1) the strongest candidate for the botanical origin of domesticated manioc-the wild progenitor of the root crop-is the species Manihot esculenta sub1>pecies flabellifolia (Pohl) Ciferri; (2) the geographi­cal origin of manioc-the biome in which the progenitor evolved-is most likely in the savannas, the Brazilian Cerrado, to the south of the Amazan rainforest; (3) the Cerrado is also, in our best estimate, the region rl agricultural origin of initial cultivation; (4) domesticated manioc had spread from the agricultural origin by the early Holocene, possibly as early as 10,000 years ago, but certainly by 7000 B.C.; and (5) domesticated manioc was a readily available plant in most habitats of the Neotropics by the mid-Holocene, at least some 6500 years ago. 
Debido a las condiciones desfavorables para la conservaci6n de restos orgdnicos en climas tropicales, la evidencia directa para sustentar el cultivo de mandioca (Manihot esculenta Crantz) es todav{a extremadamente escasa en contextos arqueol6gicos fechables. Investigaciones recientes resumidas en el presente trabajo ofrecen nuevos enfoques para el marco espacial-tem­poral de la domesticaci6n inicial y difusi6n temprana de mandioca en las tierras neo-tropicales. lntcgrando evidencias de la genetica comparativa de plantas y los andlisis de almidones paleoetnobotdnicos para contribuir a los orfgenes arqueol6gi­cos de la mandioca, esta revision de la literatura encuentra lo siguiente: (I) el candidato principal para ha/lar el origen botdnico de la mandioca domestica-la progenitora silvestre de esta ra{z-es la especie Manihot esculenta con subespecie fta­bellifolia (Pohl) Ciferri; (2) el origen geogrdfico de la mandioca-la comunidad bi6tica en donde evolucion6-es probab/e­mente en las sabanas de! Cerrado brasileno hacia el sur de los bosques tropicales de la Amazonia; (3) el cerrado brasileiio es tambien la region de! orig en agrfcola del cultivo inicial; ( 4) la mandioca domesticada se d(f'undi6 a partir de sus orfgenes agrfcolas desde el periodo Holoceno Temprano, posiblemente en epocas tan tempranas como hace 10,000 aiios; y (5) la man­dioca domesticada era una planta ampliamente disponible en casi todas las comunidades ambientales neo-tropicales durante el Holoceno Medio, por lo menos desde 6,500 anos atrds. 
anioc is a tuberous root crop and the Mfourth most important dietary source of energy in the tropics (Alves 2002:67). lt is the most important world crop known to origi­nate from the lowland Neotropics; some half a bil­lion people in Africa, Asia, and Latin America depend on manioc for their sustenance (Cock 1982:756). World manioc production yields at least 184 million tons, 18 percent of which is harvested in Latin America and the Caribbean (FAO 2003). In Amazonia, ethnographic and historical data demonstrate that manioc is a major staple and key component of indigenous subsistence and political 
economies. The importance of manioc production, distribution, and consumption systems in the evo­lution of complex societies is a recurrent theme in Amazonian archaeology (e.g., Heckenberger 1998; Lathrap 1970, 1973, 1977; Oliver2001; Roosevelt 1980). Despite the key role that archaeologists have afforded manioc cultivation in processes of long­term social change and evolution in Amazonia, direct evidence of precolumbian manioc cultiva­tion, storage, processing, and consumption remains elusive and rare. Although this may in part be on account of the poor preservation conditions for manioc from archaeological contexts in the humid

THE DOMESTICATION AND EARLY SPREAD OF MANIOC 
tropics, recent paleoethnobotanical research sug­gests that manioc formed part of mixed subsistence economies and did not dominate precolumbian diets to the extent previously assumed (e.g., Perry 2004: 1070; Pipemo et al. 2000). Nevertheless, ever since the prehistory of crop plants evolved as a field of scientific investigation, the poor preserva­tion conditions of paleoethnobotanical remains has remained a serious impediment to investigating agriculture in the humid tropics, in Amazonia and elsewhere (Lentz 1999:11). In regard to manioc, the outlook has been particularly discouraging. First, manioc is an entomophilous species; it is pol­linated by insects, and thus much less represented than are wind-pollinating species in sediment pollen records, the standard source for recon­structing the species composition of vegetation in the distant past (Piperno 1988:39; Piperno and Pearsall 1998:37). Second, although the secretory cell phytoliths (microscopic siliceous particles) from the plants' roots and leaves are distinct (Chan­dler-Ezell et al. 2006) manioc produces few diag­nostic phytoliths (Pipemo 2006a:48). Third, while preservation of macroscopic plant remains (such as seed and tuber fragments) is usually through accidental charring, tubers are very rarely isolated among carbonized plant remains (Piperno and Pearsall 1998:33), and even when carbonized, tuber fragments of manioc are difficult to identify (Lentz 
1999:11). Fomth, since manioc is usually propa­gated vegetatively, seeds have had few opportuni­ties to carbonize and be preserved at archaeological sites (Lentz 1999: 11). In regard to the record of paleoethnobotanical remains of manioc, then, absence is highly equivocal and difficult to inter­pret. Finally, there are considerable lacunae in the coverage of archaeological research in the humid lowland Neotropics. 
In more recent years, two lines of research have evolved rapidly and produced results with partic­ular potential to advance our understanding of the very early prehistory of manioc cultivation in the New World. The first are the advances made within paleoethnobotany to recover and identify micro­scopic traces of manioc starch grains from archae­ological contexts (e.g., Babat 2003, 2005; Chandler-Ezell et al. 2006; Hart and Wallis 2003; Perry 2002, 2004, 2005; Pipemo 2009; Pipemo and Becker 1996; Pipemo and Holst 1998; Piperno and Pearsall 1998; Pipemo et al. 2000; Torrence and Barton 2006). The second line of evidence is plant genetic research on the relationship between manioc cultigens and various wildManihot species to elucidate the botanical origins of the crop in a manner until recently thought indecipherable (e.g., Allem 1999, 2002; Olsen 2002; Olsen and Schaal 1999, 2001, 2006). The botanical origin of the domesticate can potentially lead to inferences on the geographical origin of manioc cultivation. 
The aim of this paper is to synthesize the cur­rently available data and sketch an up-to-date overview of the domestication and early spread of manioc cultivation in the New World, essentially addressing the fundamental wheres and whens of the prehistory of the crop. It begins with a brief introduction to manioc as an indigenous crop in the Neotropics, focusing on basic aspects of botanical characteristics, cultivation techniques, and food processing. The main part that follows the general discussion of the crop consists of two sections. The first of these is an outline of the evidence shedding light on the origins of manioc, drawing on the results of comparative analyses of domesticated and wild Manihot populations within crop genet­ics. The section that follows examines the direct paleoethnobotanical evidence available for estab­lishing the timeframe of early cultivation and spread of manioc in the New World. 
The Crop Manihot esculenta Crantz 
There are several common synonyms for manioc used worldwide, for instance cassava and yucca. Gade (2003:52) therefore recommends that the term manioc should be used as the standard in English for the cultivated plant. Etymologically, "manioc" is a French variety of a term derived from the Tupfan word "maniot," recorded on the Brazilian coast and first noted in writing in the 1550s. Linneaus pub­lished manioc as Jatropha manihot in 1753 and the current botanical name Manihot esculenta Crantz was introduced in 1766 (Gade 2003:45-46). Other botanical synonyms used more recently include 
Manihot utilissima, Manihot palmata, Manihot aipi, and Manihot dulcis (Carneiro 2000:67; Sauer 1993:57). Until the 1970s, M. utilissima was often used to denote "bitter" varieties of manioc and the others "sweet" varieties (see below) (e.g., Lathrap 1970; Sauer 1950, 1952). However,Manihot escu­lenta Crantz of the family Euphorbiaceae, sub-

family Crotonideae, and tribe Manihotae should be used as the botanical name for all manioc domesti­cates (Hawkes 1989:486; Ng and Ng 2002:167; Rogers 1963:45-46). The botanical tribe Maniho­tae includes 98 species of perennial herbs, shrubs, and trees distributed from the southwestern United States to Argentina (Rogers andAppan 1973). Most Manihot species are found in arid or seasonally dry regions (Sauer 1993:56), where they normally exhibit a patchy distributional pattern, rarely being dominant features (Nassar 2000). At the time of European contact, domesticated manioc was culti­vated widely in the lowland Neotropics on well­drained soils. 
Manioc is a woody shrub reaching between 1 and 4 meters in height. The plant develops tuber­ous roots that are the main edible part, containing large carbohydrate reserves mainly in the form of starch. A single plant usually produces between five and ten tubers that vary greatly in length, but the tubers of modem cultivars can approach 1 m and weigh up to 2 kg. Under optimal environmen­tal conditions yields can approach 30 tons of fresh tubers per hectare, but 5 to 15 tons are far more common (Alves 2002:67; Sauer 1993:58; Westby 2002:281). 

Since manioc requires a long growing season to mature at lower temperatures and does not fare well with frost (Lathrap 1970:49), its distribution in the Neotropics is limited to elevations below ca. 2,300 m (Sauer 1993:59). Growth of the manioc plant is particularly favorable in areas with annual mean temperatures between 25° and 29° C, but it toler­ates 16° to 38° C. Different varieties have dissimi­lar ideal temperatures, and yields may vary considerably with changing temperatures (Alves 2002:79-80). Manioc is mostly grown in areas where annual precipitation exceeds 1,000 mm, but the crop is also common in areas with an average annual rainfall of between 500 and 800 mm and a long dry season of four to six months. Even if man­ioc is a drought tolerant crop, plant growth and yield will decrease with low annual rainfall or prolonged periods of water-deficiency. As with any rain-fed cultivation, planting should ideally take place close to the onset of the rainy season to ensure adequate soil humidity when roots initiate and tuberize (Alves 2002:82; Henry and Hershey 2002:22). 
A considerable advantage of manioc is that it does relatively well in environments where other crops might fail: it is tolerant of low soil pH, low amounts of soil phosphorous, and high levels of exchangeable aluminum in the soil. It is resistant to periodic and prolonged droughts, to defoliation by pests and viruses, and competes well with weeds, requiring comparatively little attention after planting. Normally, no intensive land preparations are needed to plant manioc and receive an accept­able yield. Owing to these resilient qualities, man­ioc cultivation tends to be a dominant feature of smallholder subsistence economies in tropical areas with relatively frequent drought incidence and poor soils (Alves 2002:82; Henry and Hershey 2002:17-22; Howeler 2002:115; Sauer 1952:45 , 1969 [1959]:116; Sauer 1993:58). 
Although highly adaptable to various lowland Neotropical environments , the principal limiting factor for manioc cultivation in Amazonia is its sensitivity to excessive soil humidity, and it requires well-drained soils in areas of high precipitation (Sauer 1993:58). Enhanced drainage can be pro­vided, however, by various agro-techniques such as mulching, ridging, terracing, constructing drainage canals, and preparing mounds (Leihner 2002). A nutritional disadvantage of manioc is that its tuberous roots are very low in protein content. In manioc-dominated diets, protein deficiency can lead to malnutrition and also aggravate symptoms related to manioc cyanogenic toxicity (Fregene and Puonti-Kaerlas 2002:196). 
The tubers usually mature and are harvested within eight to twenty-four months after planting, depending on the variety, local environmental con­ditions, nutritional needs, and socio-economic con­text of cultivation. The length of the growing period is reduced in areas of seasonally inundated soils. For instance, in the floodplain of the Amazonian water­shed (the vdrzea),harvest needs to take place within six months to avoid destruction by flooding (Beech­ing et al. 1993:515; Henry and Hershey 2002:22). 
Manioc can be grown by both vegetative and seed propagation, but vegetative propagation by placing stem cuttings in the ground predominates. The main advantages of vegetative propagation over seed propagation are a shorter period of plant establishment-under favorable conditions, stem cuttings sprout and root within a week-and the development of a more vigorous plant (Alves 2002:67). Stem cuttings are often replanted each time a plant is harvested, so that productivity is con-

tinuous rather than seasonal (Lathrap 1973: 17 4). Planting stem cuttings from the previous harvest reduces uncertainty since vegetatively propagated the plant maintains the genotype of the parent (Ng and Ng 2002:168). 
Manioc displays considerable diversity in regard to a number of different traits -in starch quality, plant architecture, the color of the leaves, the flavor of the edible parts, the concentration and distribution of cyanogenic glucosides in the plant, the length of time for maturation, etc. -and a number of different varieties are recognized, both in folk taxonomies and by plant geneticists (Balye­jusa Kizito et al. 2007). Variation depends on a number of factors, including shifting environ­mental conditions and cultivation techniques, but in particular the plant genotype (Nassar 2000). Conservative vegetative propagation-i.e ., replanting cuttings of the same parent genotype material generation after generation -promote genetic uniformity rather than diversity. Owing to the great number of varieties the long-term history 
of the relationship between manioc and people must have been one of plant hybridization and cul­tural selection (Lathrap 1977:725; Sauer 1969a [ 1959]: 118). It is a reasonable hypothesis that pre­columbian agriculturalists practiced a selective method of choosing cuttings not only from the stems of the previous planting, but also from select plants of hybrids growing within or in the vicin­ity of the plot and crossings between wild Mani­hot species and cultivars, as has been documented from contemporary farming systems in Guyana (Elias et al. 2001). Furthermore, throughout the Holocene many Amazonian social formations were non-or semi-sedentary (Oliver 2001; Politis 2001) and manioc cultivators must have brought seeds-which travel much better than do stem cuttings-with them (e.g., Ugent et al. 1986:99). Cultural selection of planting material may have been made on the basis of a number of different plant characteristics determined as particularly favorable, for instance tuber size, taste, drought tol­erance, color of leaves, pest resistance, and adapt­ability to local soil conditions (Balyejusa Kizito et al. 2007; Sauer 1952:45). Over time and across space, such strategies would have added to an increasingly broad repertoire of available manioc varieties, the result of the long-term interaction of agricultural selection, experimentation, and inven­
tiveness on the one hand, and natural processes of species hybridization by out-crossing on the other (Rival and McKey 2008). Some reports indicate that there are over 5,000 known distinctive vari­eties of manioc worldwide (Wilson 2003:404), and indigenous Amazonian manioc cultivators typi­cally maintain considerable diversity even within a single field-plot (Rogers 1963 :45; Sauer 1950:507). For instance, the Aguaruna of the Peru­vian Amazon collectively cultivate more than 100 distinct varieties of manioc, which are distin­guished principally on the basis of tuber shape and the color of the leaves, and each plot may hold up to 25 different varieties (Brown 1986). 
Manioc varieties are often classified into two main groupings-"bitter" and "sweet" -on the basis of the relative amount of cyanogenic gluco­sides in the plant. When the tissue of the tuber is damaged, for instance by harvesting and food preparation, the cyanogenic glucosides are hydrolyzed to poisonous hydrocyanic acid (HCN, or prussic acid) (Carneiro 2000:67; Wilson 2003 :404). All manioc varieties contain cyanogenic 
glucosides, but only in plants with high concen­
trations, with high cyanogenic potential (CNP), is 
juice extraction and heating the edible mash needed to avoid symptoms of intoxication. These are vari­eties of the "bitter" group. "Sweet" manioc vari­eties contain only low amounts and can be eaten after simple boiling or roasting. Poor processing of bitter manioc failing to extract glucosides may result in acute cyanide intoxication, with symp­toms like vomiting, dizziness, and paralysis, and can be lethal (Cock 1982; Westby 2002:282; Wil­son 2003: 404). But manioc food products with rel­atively low CNP may also cause neurological disorders if consumed over long periods of time, in particular among populations suffering from 
chronic malnutrition (Nestel and Macintyre 1973). 
Recent studies show that the CNP may be affected 
by variables other than genotype:_ including cli­
matic and soil conditions and plant age (Alves 
2002:78; Westby 2002:283). 
Manioc remains one of few world crops for 
which farmers favor more toxic varieties (Wilson 
2003:405). Varieties with high CNP are believed 
to have several benefits: (1) higher productivity 
(Piperno and Pearsall 1998: 125; Wilson 
2003:405); (2) larger amounts of starch and bet­
ter-quality starch (Lathrap 1970:53; Sauer

1950:507); (3) greater pest-resistance (Bellotti 2002; Lathrap 1970:50; Wilson 2003); and (4) the ability to yield storable flour and bread (Lathrap 1970:51; Piperno andPearsall 1998: 125). Lathrap (1973:174) argued that precolumbian farmers specifically selected for the quality and quantity of starch and the ability to store, but there is no absolute consensus on the advantages of high CNP varieties. For instance, Piperno and Pear sall (1998: 125) point out that there are no concrete data supporting the idea that flour from bitter man­ioc is better in quality, and Sauer (1950:508) argued that sweet varieties are normally more tol­erant to both drought and low temperatures. A major source of disagreement is probably the enor­mous diversity of manioc varieties, which con­trasts with the over-simplified sweet/bitter dichotomy, and which has largely been abandoned among agronomists, plant biologists, and plant geneticists (e.g., Balyejusa Kizito et al. 2007). 
Varieties of the high CNP group are today pri­marily cultivated in Amazonia and the Antilles. Sweet manioc occurs largely throughout the low­land Neotropics and is often grown as a supple­ment to bitter manioc where these dominate. Generally speaking, where high CNP varieties are cultivated they form the major staple, while maize is the major staple where sweet manioc varieties dominate over bitter varieties (Hawkes 1989:486; Piperno and Pearsall 1998:124; Sauer 1950:508; Wilson 2003). At the regional scale, however, the relative importance of bitter versus sweet varieties varies from one area to the next (Moran 1991 :362). For instance, in the relatively nutrient­poor soils of northwest Amazonia bitter varieties dominate strongly, while mainly sweet varieties are cultivated in the more nutrient-rich soils of western Amazonia. 
Sauer (1950:507) suggested that bitter manioc is older and closer to the wild progenitor. Rogers ( 1963 :46), however, argued that sweet manioc vari­eties found along the eastern slopes of the Andes were the first to be used for cultivation and con­sumption, and that bitter varieties of manioc were selected from wild stock at a later stage and came into use when efficient techniques of extracting poisonous contents had been developed. 
Lathrap ( 1970, 1973, 1977) argued for the cul­tivation of bitter varieties of manioc as the most important driving force of Amazonian cultural evolution, and suggested that storable bread and flour made from treated bitter manioc provided the foundation for increasing social complexity among Amazonian societies: it made possible sur­plus production, it provided the economic basis for specialization, it laid the foundation for social differentiation, and it stimulated the growth of exchange networks. Lathrap (1973:175) argued that an extensive trade network based on bitter manioc surplus production was flourishing in northwest South America 5,000 years ago, but. that Amazonian agriculture and manioc cultiva­tion had a much longer prehistory. Roosevelt ( 1980) argued against the hypothesis that bitter manioc cultivation played a prominent role for Amazonian social complexity since it is a protein­deficient staple crop. 
More recently, Heckenberger ( 1998) and Oliver (2001), among others, have revitalized the interest in manioc for understanding social complexity. Heckenberger (1998) shows how a subsistence strategy focused on the cultivation of bitter man­ioc and fishing provided the economic foundation for large, sedentary village populations and regional settlement in the Upper Xingu region, ca. A.D. 900-1500. Ethnographic and archaeological data suggest a cyclic, long-fallow system of cultivating bitter manioc varieties on terra firme soils (dry uplands) of low fertility, producing the bulk of dietary carbohydrates. Exploitation of diverse aquatic resources, especially fish, covered nutri­tional needs for proteins. 
Oliver (2001) polemically calls manioc the "super-crop" of greater Amazonia, emphasizing the significant advantages of the crop (environmental flexibility, ease of cultivation, considerable drought resistance, efficient producer of carbohydrates, degree of consistently high yields, aptitude for stor­age, etc.), and the role that these attributes have played for positioning manioc at the center of Ama­zonian subsistence systems and socio-economic development since at least the early Holocene. 
Results from recent paleoethnobotanical research suggests that, rather than being dominated by a handful of monocrop staples such as manioc or maize, precolumbian neotropical cultivation was highly diverse at essentially all spatial scales down to the individual field plot (e.g., Dickau et al. 2007; Goldstein 2010; Perry 2004, 2005; Piperno 2009: Piperno and Dillehay 2008; Piperno et al. 2000).

lsendahl] THE DOMESTICATION AND EARLY SPREAD OF MANIOC 

The Origins of Manihot esculenta Crantz 
Until quite recently, detailed questions regarding the temporal and spatial origins of manioc domes­tication were considered impossible to adequately address (Lathrap 1970:49; Sauer 1952:46). Over the last decade or so, however, important clues are emerging from plant genetics, specifically from comparative approaches analyzing molecular sim­ilarities between wild Manihot species and domes­ticated varieties. There are three different origins to consider here (Allem 1999: 123, 2002: 1): (1) the botanical origin (the wild progenitor from which domesticated manioc descends), (2) the geograph­ical origin (the biome in which the progenitor evolved), and (3) the agricultural origin (the area of initial cultivation of the ancestor). Plant geneti­cists address botanical origins by measuring the degree of genetic relatedness between species on the basis of DNA analyses. The most likely area of 
geographical origins is inferred from the distribu­tion and habitats of the wild species most closely related to the domesticated species. Interpreting agricultural origins is an interdisciplinary effort involving the collected contributions of plant genet­ics and botany, supplemented by paleoclimatology, paleoethnobotany, and archaeology to narrow down the probable area of original domestication. A fourth sub-question concerns the time frame of the domestication process, but on this point plant genetics has far fewer answers to offer and the time-depth of initial domestication and manioc cul­tivation is discussed in the next section, in large parts drawing on recent advances in paleoethnob­otanical starch analysis. 
The great diversity of manioc varieties does indeed suggest a long history of cultivation. According to the Vavilovian model of historical botany (Vavilov 1951), the geographical origin of a plant is most likely to be the area where the genetic variation in related wild species is the most abun­dant. The longer a botanical tribe-such as Manihotae -occupies an area, the more variable it will become and the more probable it is that a wild progenitorof a domesticated plant developed there. Drawing on Manihot distributions and diversity patterns, several geographical and agricultural ori­gins have been proposed. Vavilov ( 1951) identified a center of Manihot diversity in the savanna envi­ronments of Bolivia and Brazil, south of the Arna­zon rain forest. Rogers (1963) initially singled out two centers-one in the drier areas of southern Mesoamerica, the other in the dry northeastern por­tions of Brazil-and later argued for a complex botanical history of multiple origins (Rogers and Fleming 1973). Nassar (2000) identifies four cen­ters of species diversity: (1) southern Goias and eastern Minas Gerais of the Brazilian savanna, the Cerrado; (2) southwestern Mexico; (3) northeast­ern Brazil; and (4) southwestern Mato Grosso of Brazil and adjacent areas oflowland Bolivia. Find­ing the greatest degree of variety in the first Brazil­ian center of diversity, Nassar (2000) proposes that the Cerrado (a mixture of arboreal woodland with an open canopy and continuous grass undercover, open scrub grassland with scattered trees, and closed scrub) is the area of original domestication and that the other centers reflect precolumbian migration of farming populations. Introduced to a new area, domesticated manioc would hybridize with wild Manihot species, producing multiple cen­ters of diversity. 
A number of scholars other than botanists have also attempted to identify the geographical and agricultural origins of manioc. Geographer Carl Sauer (1952:40-45) proposed a single geograph­ical origin in northwest South America for man­ioc and New World agriculture in general. Sauer (1969a [1936]:136-137) argued that the critical objective of cultivation was to provide an ade­quate supply of carbohydrates, which could be filled by starchy Manihot tubers. Demand for starchy tubers became great in proto-agricultural subsistence economies, but with dispersed distri­bution they were at risk of depletion and local extinction. To Sauer, cultivation of starchy tubers by vegetative propagation evolved as a direct response to secure an adequate supply of a criti­cal food resource. Root crops rich in carbohydrates were the first plants to be brought under domesti­cation. Although numerous species may have ini­tially been propagated, Sauer argues that favorable qualities of some plants over others , for instance in regards to productivity, nutritional content, and storage ability, would focus efforts on a smaller number of plants. The simplicity of vegetative propagation, placing non-digestible, unused parts of preferred plants back in the ground, ensures that it would soon be mastered in outline without demanding considerable human inventiveness.
