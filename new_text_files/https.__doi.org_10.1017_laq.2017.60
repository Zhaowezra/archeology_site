Although dendrochronological methods have the potential to provide precise calendar dates, they are virtually absent in Mesoamerican archaeological research. This absence is due to several long-standing, but erroneous, assumptions: that tree rings in this region do not re.ect annual growth and environmental variability, that an adequate number of samples do not exist, and that tree-ring measurements cannot be useful without modern trees to link prehispanic chronologies. In this article we present data from the sites of La Quemada and Los Pilarillos, located in the Malpaso Valley, Zacatecas, to demonstrate that suitable archaeologically derived samples of dendrochronologically useful species do exist, that the samples from these sites are measurable and cross-datable, and that the tree rings can yield precise calendar dates using a method that “wiggle-matches” radiocarbon dates on tree-ring sequences. The work demonstrates the potential of these methods to address chronological, and, in the future, climatic questions, which have so far eluded archaeological work in the region. 
Los métodos dendrocronológicos tienen el potencial de proporcionar fechas de calendario precisas, sin embargo son escasamente utilizados en las investigaciones arqueológicas Mesoamericanas. Esto se debe a la existencia de varios supuestos de larga permanencia, pero erróneos tales como: que los anillos de los árboles en esta región no re.ejan el crecimiento anual y la variabilidad medioambiental, que no existe un número adecuado de muestras, y que las mediciones de los anillos de los árboles no pueden ser útiles sin la existencia de árboles modernos para vincular las curvas prehispánico. En este artículo, se presentan datos de los sitios de La Quemada y Los Pilarillos, localizados en el Valle de Malpaso, Zacatecas, para demostrar que existen muestras arqueológicas dendrocronológicamente adecuadas, medibles, que se pueden “cross­date”, y que se pueden obtener fechas precisas usando un método llamado “calibración de radiocarbono de secuencias de.nidas” (radiocarbon wiggle-matching). El trabajo pone en evidencia el potencial de estos métodos para abordar cuestiones cronológicas, y en el futuro, también climáticas, las cuales hasta la fecha han eludido el trabajo arqueológico en la región.

wouldthereforebea useful tool forarchaeolo­gists(Schulman 1944).Scott(1966)reviewedall evidence thenavailable and argued forthe poten­tial of dendrochronology in Mexico, including its archaeological sites. Although work was slow to start, much has been achieved with the development of long tree-ring sequences from living and relic trees in Mexico and nearby areas covering the past1,300 years(Stahleetal. 2011; Stahleet al. 2012;Villanueva Díazet al.2002). Archaeological applications have been less suc­cessful. With the noted exception of the Casas Grandesregionin Chihuahua,Mexico (Bannister and Scott 1962;Scott1966), and one other very recent exception focused on Maya chronology (Kennett et al. 2013), therehave been virtually no successful dendroarchaeological applications published from Mesoamerican archaeological materials. 
Indeed, one of the scarce exceptions may largely explain the problem. In his study in conjunctionwithan archaeological projectonthe coastofOaxaca, Naylor(1971)found thateven though the environmental conditions seemed ideal, the tree rings he examined were compla­cent, which means they were not sensitive to environmental variability, an essential compo­nent to successful dendrochronology.This pes­simistic prognosis seemed to stall dendroarchae­ological studiesin Mesoamericaforageneration. 
Three key things then changed. Over the next 10 to 20 years it became well established that trees growing in extratropical and tropical climatic zonesand higher altitudesinMexico can be used in dendrochronology (Cook and Kair­iukstis 1990; Stahle 1999). Second, networks of long tree-ring chronologies were compiledto investigateclimateprocessesthat ledtorenewed attention to both living tree and relic wood sequences in Mexico (e.g., Stahle and Cleave-land 1993), and reliableMexican tree-ring data were included in thelandmarkNorth American Drought Atlas(Cook et al. 2004). Finally,with the turn of the millennium, the Laboratorio Nacional de Dendrocronología of the Instituto Nacional de InvestigacionesForestales,Agríco­las y Pecuarias (INIFAP) was founded. Since then, dendrochronological researchershavesuc­cessfully developed tree-ring chronologies for many regions of Mexico that date back as much as 1,300 years(Cleaveland et al. 2003;González-Elizondo et al. 2005;Stahleet al. 2011;Stahle et al. 2012;Stahleet al. 2016;Villanueva Díaz etal. 2002),andit became possibletoinvestigate speci.c climate-historyassociations (e.g., Burns et al. 2014). Despite such major contributions, there have been only two applications of den­drochronology using archaeological wood or charcoal in Mesoamerica(Kennett et al. 2013; Turkon et al. 2015). Perhaps it is the legacy of Naylor’s study that thwarted archaeologists from further attempts at dendroarchaeological analysis.Orperhaps its applicationwas impeded due to the belief that archaeological wood sam­ples were too scarce, too small, or too poorly preserved to be useful, or possibly that mod­ern analogues were absent (Evans andWebster 2001:206). 
The present article aims to demonstrate the feasibility of dendrochronology in Mesoamer­ican archaeology, particularly how relatively shorttree-ring sequences in small collections of archaeological wood can provide signi.cantly more precise control of time than other avail­ablemethods.Wefound that suf.cient samples exist, tree rings are discernible and measur­able, and their sequences can be dated rela­tive to each other and combined into “.oating chronologies.”With theintegrationof the tree-ring 14C wiggle-matching calibration method, these datasetsprovide important and immediate chronological contributionstothearchaeological recordofMesoamerica.In areas such asin the Malpaso Valley of northwestern Mesoamerica, where precise chronological control and .ne-scale reconstruction of past climate conditions have eluded archaeologists, these dendroarchae­ological applications may offer one of the only methods that can directly address chronological issues with suf.cient precision. 


NorthernMesoamerican FrontierDating Problems 
Oneofthe manytheoriestoexplainthe northern expansion of the Mesoamerican frontier during theClassicperiod continuestobeacceptedtoday, although there is inconclusive data to support it. This theory suggests that during the Classic period, perhaps around AD 450–500, a group

of Mesoamerican people moved north because of the opportunity provided by an increase in regional rainfall, which supported an agricul­tural lifestyle in a region previously too arid (Armillas 1964). This theory also attributes the subsequent abandonmenttoadrought,orareturn to the previous arid conditions, which drove the agriculturally dependent society back into centraland westMexico, perhaps aroundAD850 (Figure1;Armillas1964;Braniffand Areti-Hers 1998;Parlerm andWolf1957). 
Therearetwomajor problemsthathave pre­vented archaeologists from testing and address­ing this theory. First, the calibration of single radiocarbon dates, the principal dating method for this region, gives wide ranges of calendar dates that are not precise enough to pinpoint the times of earliest arrival, cultural changes, or abandonment of settlements. This is particularly the case when nearly all dates are from charcoal samples, which can only give the dates after (terminus post quem)the growth of a particular partofatreewithno certaintyofthefellingyear. Overall, in work published to date the available radiocarbon rangeshave not been abletoresolve ahigher-resolution chronology (Beekman 2010; Nelson1997;Nelsonetal.1997;Soler Arechalde et al. 2011;Trombold1990).Establishingamore precise chronology by reducing the margins of errorwouldprovideamuch clearer understand­ing of the early development of sites and the network of interaction that developed between

sites through time, ultimately helping to re.ne the timing ofabandonment. 
Second,ofthestudiesthat directly addressthe climatic change hypothesis, most indicate that climate conditions were stable duringthe Classic period(Brown 1992;Elliott et al.2010;Frederick 1995; Trombold and Israde-Alcantara 2005). The newly established Mexican Drought Atlas (http://drought.memphis.edu/MXDA/) recons­truction is not regarded as robust prior to AD 1200 for northwest Mexico. Nonetheless, it does indicateasomewhat moister period betweenAD 500 and 725 and a several decades-long dry interval in the middle to late eighth century (Stahle et al. 2016; IRI/LDEO Climate Data Library 2016a;IRI/LDEOClimateDataLibrary 2016b).Although these dataare admittedlyinter­polated from a much wider region, theyprovide some basis forthe climate-drivenhypothesis. 
Whether or not there were large-scale and long-term climatic changes that could be iden­ti.ed by these studies, there is support from observations in more recent periods, when pre­cipitation is frequently insuf.cient for subsis­tence agriculturalproduction(Elliott et al. 2010; Turkonetal.2011). Indeed,manyshorttomulti­decadal dry periods are indicated in various historic and proxy records through the past millennium (Cooketal. 2004;Stahleetal.2016), suggesting that drought conditions which could haveseverelyaffectedthestabilityand longevity of prehispanic agricultural communitiesinnorth­ern Mexico did frequently occur. Archaeologi­cal tree-ring evidence may, in the future, offer a means to develop a direct-proxy, tree-ring– based precipitationreconstructionfortheClassic period.Theincentiveisobvious,sincethe current reconstructionsofpastenvironmental conditions are primarily based on alluvial sediments and pollen deposited overlong periodsof time and do not offer suf.cient chronological resolution to identifyshortto decadal-scalevariability. 
The Malpaso Valley 
The Malpaso Valley, located on the northern marginofthe frontier zone, presentsanideal case forre.ning therelationship between chronology, climate, and prehispanicsettlement through den­droarchaeological analysis.Mean annual rainfall is about 400 mm (ComisiónNacional del Agua 2008), which provides marginal to suf.cient moisturefor agriculture(Verheye 2010)butinthe eventof belownormalrainfall becomes marginal or worse. 
Like most regions in northwest Mexico, and despite a series of intensive excavations and excellent research, the pace and timing ofthese cultural developments are still not well under­stood.TheMalpasoValley,forexample,is gen­erally reported to have been occupied between AD 550 and 900 (Beekman 2010;Nelson 1997). Archaeologistshave noted that thedividing and remodelingofarchitecturalliving space indicates theintensityor durationofuse (Lelgemann 2000; Nelson and Schiavitti 1992;Nelsonetal. 1993; Nelson et al. 1997), but using this observation to create analytical phases has provendif.cult. Similarly,despite major advances in understand­ingthe potteryoftheregion,thedevelopmentofa ceramic chronology has been hinderedbyalack of chronological precision(Torvinen et al. 2014; Torvinenetal.2015).Itis clear thatanyadvances in chronological control can help address cultural questions, not only within the Malpaso Valley, but also in the regions with which the valley occupants had contact. 
Despite the widespread belief that archae­ological wood samples are not available in Mexico, we have already collected an adequate numberof samplestobeginthedevelopmentofa local tree-ring chronology from two contexts in theMalpasoValley.Theproject teamisworking on other contexts as well. Thetwo contexts dis­cussed below,however,havethe greatest number of samples and have receivedthe most attention to date. Other contexts willbe presentedin future publications.

TheCuartelisa room complexoverlooking the centralsite core.Inthe 1950sand 1960s Pedro Armillas conducted excavations in the Cuartel (Armillas 1963; Trombold 1990). Most of his records are now lost, but his artifact collection is intact and undergoing analysis at Arizona StateUniversity.Numerouswood sampleswere collected duringtheseexcavations,butduetothe passageof timesinceexcavation, most areinvery poor condition and their fragments generally have short ring counts. One sample, however (INAH 16), still had more than 40 rings and is discussed below. 
Recent excavations in adjacent rooms, directed by Marco Antonio Santos Ramírez in 2012–2014, providemorein-depth understand­ingofthisroom complex(Santos Ramírez 2014). Thecomplexhadtwomajor constructionphases. Theoldest,asingle-storystructureinthe shape of a half-moon, was relatively small and likely ceremonial in function. The space was later remodeled into a two-story masonry structure, different than the adobe found in most other sectorsofthe site.The generally more substantial construction materials and high frequency of .ne ceramics suggest that this area housed an elite population (Jiménez Betts 2004; Santos Ramírez 2014). The 13 interconnected rooms on the ground .oor were closed to the public and intentionally separated, perhaps forseparate governing lineages. The upper .oor seems to have been used for more public social activities (Santos Ramírez 2014). Some fallen beams, probably used as roof supports between the two .oors, were found within these rooms. The beamswereverywellpreserved, some partially charred, along thestill-plasteredwalls (Notimex 2013). These beams, along with some of the wood recovered by Armillas discussed above, provide the .rst assemblage for dendrochrono­logical applications (samplesINAH16andLAQ 28–32).

Until now, best efforts to date the two siteshaveemployed radiocarbon datathathave only led to broad chronological estimates—for example, AD 550–800 (Nelson 1997:103–105). Employing a Bayesian chronological modeling approach (Bronk Ramsey 2009a, 2009b;Zeidler et al. 1998), today we can do a little better. Figure3 illustratesa reanalysis of theNelson (1997)dates fromLaQuemada, which results in a largely similar main phase terminus post quem (TPQ) for the two main datasets from Terrace 18 and Midden 11, respectively, cal AD 711–825 and cal AD 707–808 at 68.2% highest posterior density (HPD). Theinitial phaseshort­lived sample(B-77239, a corncob) setsaTPQ for the data in the model and is likely placed at AD 660–723. These dates suggest a more restricted age range for the site compared to previous estimates (AD 550–800). 


LabMethods and Analysis 
Basic Principles of Dendrochronology 
Dendrochronological analysis is based on two basic principles (Fritts 1976; Schweingruber 1988;Speer2010).First,treespecies suitablefor dendrochronology produce one visible tree ring per year as the response to growth conditions. Each annual tree ring usually includes a rapid growing season when conditions are favorable, producing earlywood, and one of more slow

growth, calledlatewood, witha dormant phase with no growth between each annual increment. These changes are evident in .uctuations in tissue density, color, and cell size within each ring. The number of annual rings in the cross sectionofa tree recordsthebiologicalageofthe tree. The outermost ring in a sample represents thelast yearof growth.Barkorwaneyedge, the ring immediately belowbark, representsthe year in whichthe treewas cutdown, and its presence is important for archaeological interpretation. 
Second, annual-ring widths vary in response to changing climatic and environmentalfactors, such as temperature and rainfall, producing wider rings when conditions are favorable and narrower rings when conditions are poor (Fritts 1976). Despite individual circumstances and histories, trees of the same species in the same geographic area under similar climatic and environmental constraints produce over time similarring-widthgrowth patterns. Bringing the two basic principles together, dendrochronology matches the unique growth pattern between trees and site chronologies to relatively date them against each other. 
Breaking down the two principles, a successful application of dendrochronology requires the following preconditions: (1) tree species with annual growth rings,(2) multiple samples per species,(3) generally 50 or more rings per sample, (4) trees that grew in the same climatic region, (5) trees that grew during the same time period, and (6) growth responsemainlyassociated with climate and not speci.c microscale environmental conditions. When sampling multiple living trees, all but the last are usually immediately apparent. In an archaeological setting, however, all six preconditions must be considered. 
In order to address the preconditions of archaeologicalwood samplesfor dendrochrono­logical analysis, a clear view of the ring bound­aries and cells on the transverse surface is necessary to evaluate annual-ring growth, ring count, and species identi.cation. Sketches and photographs of the samples are taken before sample preparation becausethe preparationpro­cessis partially destructive.Wood segmentsof unburned timbers are prepared by sanding the transverse surface to a high polish with a pro­gressive seriesof coarsetovery.ne sandpapers. Charred samples are prepared by sanding or scraping with a .ne razor and blowing away the dust. If thesampleis fragile,itisprepared by snapping it to create a fresh break. After preparation, samples are inspected under stereo, or dissecting, microscopes or scanning electron microscopes to identify genus and species, if possible,andtomakean initialring count.Gen­era and subgeneratypesof species areclassi.ed using anatomical characteristics, primarily on the basisof thetransverse surfaces. 
All samples in our collection have annual rings, meeting precondition 1. Precondition 2, multiple samples of the same species, is min­imally ful.lled and cautiously accepted, as explained below. Of the assemblage, 17 of the samples contain more than the ~50 rings requiredinprecondition3.Precondition4is met bytherestrictionsin transporttechnologyatthe time,givingahighprobabilitythatthetrees felled for construction were all from the same climate zone in the Malpaso Valley. Additional con.r­mation of preconditions 5 and 6 are generally supported by the analysis as presented in the results sections below. 
Due to poor preservation and friable con­ditions, species-speci.c attributes are dif.cult with archaeological wood remains, especially when charred. In addition, many pine species have similar wood anatomical features that are not diagnostic at species level(Schweingruber 1988). In the state of Zacatecas, there are cur­rently12 species andvarietiesofpine, with suc­cessful hybridization between many (Martínez 1948), and more species were likely during the occupation of the site. Although we hesitate to identify the archaeological samples to the species level, all are pines. We conservatively identi.ed four subgeneratypesby differencesin the abruptness of early-to latewood transition, thewidthof latewood, and thedistribution and size of resin ducts(Table1). Thereare at least four samples ofeach type in our collection.

precision. Ring widths were measured twice along each radius, with a minimum of two radii per sample.Measurementswere carefully recon­ciled within single sample sequences and their radii combined before attempting to cross-date with the tree-ring sequences of other samples, and additionally reconciled when missing or false rings were apparent in between-sample comparisons. For samples that had many frag­ments fromthe same tree, thelarger fragments were measured and the resulting measurements combined when visible characteristics of ring patterns couldbe.ttogether. 
The ring-width sequences in samples from the same site and contexts were compared for possiblecross dating, usingthe established den­drochronological methods of visual compari­son, distinctive marker years, and supporting statistical tests (Cook and Kairiukstis 1990), including Student’s t-score, intercorrelation, and trend coef.cients provided by Tellervo and COFECHA software (Brewer 2014;Holmes 1983). A trend coef.cient is the percentage of increasesor decreasesinyear-to-yearring widths that arethe sameintheoverlap between samples. Successfully cross-dated samples in the same context were combined into chronologies. The chronologies and singlesamples fromdifferent contexts werethen compared,andagain,ifanyof those sequences cross-dated successfully, those datasets were combined. Once the chronologies were compiledfor each site,theywere compared witheachotherandwith samplesthatlacked suc­cessful within-site cross dating. By this method,

we could determineifthetwositeswere occupied at the same time. 
Placing Floating Tree-Ring Chronologies in Absolute Time 
Themethods described above demonstratehow a tree-ring chronology is constructed. When an archaeological chronology is produced for a species, time period, and geographicregionfor which there are no established calendar-dated reference chronologies to place it in absolute time, then it is considered a “.oating chronol­ogy.”A radiocarbon dateonsamples usedin the chronology can place the chronology approxi­matelyin time.Atree-ring radiocarbon “wiggle­match,” however, achieves a more speci.c and precise placement with a much smaller relative error(Bayliss 2007;Bronk Ramseyet al.2001; Galimberti et al. 2004). 
Ourtree-ring chronologiesgive relative dates of the tree rings in the timbers from several cultural contextsatthetwositesand suggesttheir chronological order relative to each other.Since there are no reference chronologies, they are .oatingintime. Thewiggle-matchmethod helps to obtainthe absolute datesby creatinga dataset of multiple 14Cdates separatedbythe numberof rings between the dated tree-ring segments.For this purpose, after cross-dated sequences were combined into chronologies, samples were cho­senfor 14Cdating. Generally,oneortwosamples were chosen from each chronology,plussingle samples chosen for their long ring sequences or culturally meaningful contexts. From each sample, a series of decadal-scale sequential ring segments were selected and cut for radiocarbon dating. For each wiggle-match, a dataset was compiledofthe 14Cdatesplacedalongthesame timelineastheirrespectivesegments and .ttedto the IntCal13 northern hemisphere international radiocarbon calibration curve (Reimer et al. 2013) using the D_Sequence function in the OxCal software (Bronk Ramsey et al. 2001). The results of wiggle-matches are reported by quoting the mean ± sigma (µ ± s )ofthe modeled probability distribution of the wiggle-match. Ranges, when cited, are for the 68.2% (and 95.4%) highest posterior density (HPD) intervals(n.b.,these are not 1s [and2s ]ranges becausethe calibrated and/or modeled ranges are not symmetrical probability distributions). The success of a wiggle-match depends on identify­ing a unique .t, which is typically affected by thelengthof the sequence, numberof tree-ring sequenced data,andtheshapeoftheradiocarbon calibration curve in the relevant period. 
Determining the Years of Construction and Occupation 
Determiningthe yearin whicha treewasfelled is thekeyto establishing construction dates and occupation range. The outermost ring, indicated bythepresenceof barkorwaneyedge,isthelast ringofgrowthandtheyearin whichthe tree died. 
Once the tree-ring datasets have been abso­lutely dated, the construction and occupation datesare determinedbytheenddatesofthesam­ples.For each sample,if the outermost growth ring is at the waney edge, then the date of its outer ring is the felling date and indicates the earliest date range for the cultural use of the tree. For timbers found at archaeological sites, however, the waney edge is frequently missing due to preparation ofthe wood for construction or natural decay.Sothe datesof the outerextant ring in these samples give a “felled after” date (TPQ), indicatingthat constructionhadtobelater than that year. 


Results 
Here we present the initial results of the dendrochronological and radiocarbon wiggle-matching methods forthe MalpasoValley sites of Los Pilarillos and La Quemada. We begin with the dendrochronological results for each structural context, then compare contexts within each site. Next, we compare the two sites. Finally, we present the results as absolute dates by considering radiocarbon assays and the wiggle-match analysis. 
Cross-Dated Samples from within Sites in the Malpaso Valley 
La Quemada. We collected seven samples from the 2012–2014 Cuartel excavations at La Quemada (LAQ)and inspected 22 more stored from the Armillas excavations in the 1960s. One additional sample was collected from the temple onTerrace 18(Figure2). Most of the

At Terrace 18, the sample LAQ35, a Type III pine, has only 39 rings, which makes cross dating questionable. Nevertheless, we highlight it hereasit maybe an important bridge between other samples from the site and because it wasfoundinadifferent context(Table1).We discuss it in terms of wiggle-matching later. Similarly, LAQ 16, from the original Armil­las Cuartel collection, has 56 rings and pro­vides an important timemarkerfor theCuartel occupation. 
Los Pilarillos. Thirty-three samples were collected from threeareas at LosPilarillos, the North and East Rooms in the North Banquette and from the East Banquette. All samples are of pine species Types II and IV. Each sample wasbroken,somewithasmanyas14 fragments. Twelve sampleshavemorethan50 rings and are closetomeetingthe minimumpreconditions for dendrochronological analysis. 
Two samples from the North Room of the North Banquette (PIL 13 and PIL 21) are of Type II pines and cross-date, ending only a year apart(Figure5). Neither sample hasa de.nitive waney edge,but since their outer ring dates are within a year of each other, and the rings extend around 25%of theircircumferences,itislogical to think that they were cut at the same time. Thesamples were combined intoaLos Pilarillos chronology, 106 yearsinlength. 
PIL 15, also from the North Room of the North Banquette and of Type II pine, is com­posed of two measured fragments, neither of which suggests a close proximity to a waney edge. The lack of waney edge indicates that we can onlygivethe outer ringa “felledafter” date. The average ring width, about 0.2 mm, is so small that many rings easily could have broken off.

dating should be possible between Los Pilar­illos and La Quemada and, if so, would be an indication that their occupations were con­temporaneous. This between-site cross dating was con.rmed, with good statistical support, by matching growth patterns in the La Quemada chronology with the Los Pilarillos chronology (Figure6). Thecross datealsoindicates that the two species, Types I and II, respond similarly to the same climate parameters. This cross date putsthe end dateofthe LosPilarillos chronology at RY 1134, ending 44 years later than the La Quemada chronology. 
An additional cross date was successful between the La Quemada and Los Pilarillos chronologies and a single sample, PIL 15, also from the Los Pilarillos North Banquette, ends at RY 1069, 65 years earlier than the Los Pilarillos chronology.Due to theshort41years of overlap, the relative cross date of the two Los Pilarillos sequences had not been identi­.ed when initially comparingthe LosPilarillos samples. Adding PIL 15 to the original Los Pilarillos chronology of PIL 13 and 21 creates a revised 126-year chronology that increases the visual similarity and supporting statistics with theLaQuemada chronology(Figure6, Table2). 
Finally, the placement of a second tentative crossdate betweenLAQ16andtheLos Pilarillos chronologyis supportedby 14Cwiggle-matching (Tables2 and3, Figures6 and8). LAQ16 and

order. The radiocarbon wiggle-match method­ology supports the cross-dating of the two chronologies and relative order by placing them in absolute time. 
As mentioned above,longer sequences have the greatest potential for successful wiggle-matching. Sample LAQ 31 from Room K of theLaQuemada Cuartel, whereLAQ 30was also found, was selected because it contains 174 rings, its outer ring is very close to the waney edge, and it is a Type III pine variety. After ring widths were measured, seven tree­ringsegmentsweredissected, eachvariouslyof 9–11 years but with known tree-ring intervals between them.The resultant 14Cages were then .tted against IntCal13 (Figure7 andTable3; Reimer et al. 2013). Application of the wiggle­matchmethodology placedtheendofthesample sequence (RY 1174, four years later than the midpoint of the last dated tree-ring sample) at cal AD 636–655 (68.2% HPD). 
The wiggle-match of the LAQ 31 radiocar­bon dates explained the lack of cross dating betweenitandtheLos PilarillosandLaQuemada chronologies, and most other 14C-dated samples, because its absolute dates do not overlap the time period represented by the other samples.

Nonetheless, the wiggle-match of three 14C­dated segments from the Terrace 18 sample placesit tentatively between theLAQ31 sample and thetwo site chronologies(Figures6 and8).

Wiggle-Matching the Combined Samples 
Theerror range canbeeven further reduced,and cross datingfurther con.rmed,by coordinating more of the 14C dates from the La Quemada and Los Pilarillos samples. Using the relative dates from thetree-ring sequences in Figure6a,

a wiggle-match based on 25 radiocarbon dates along the complete chronology signi.cantly reduces the dating .t range to ±4 calendar years (µ ± s of the wiggle-match posterior density distribution; Figure8).Five datesdo not neatly .t on the radiocarbon calibration curve and are possible outliers,though theirexclusion does not signi.cantly alter the dates obtained from employing all 25 14C dates—moving the mean (µ) .t point for the start of the tree-ring chronology two yearsolder.The “cleaned” wiggle-match places the 305-year chronology at cal AD 466 to 770 ± 4, which places the dates for minimal occupation at cal AD 639 to after 770, with the construction events at La Quemada occurring soon after cal AD 639, 661, 711, 726, and 770 (RY 1003, 1025, 1075, 1090, 1134, respectively; Table3and Figure6) and a building construction after AD 770 for LosPilarillos (RY 1134; Figure8). All dates have a ±4-year error quoting the µ ± s of the wiggle-match posterior density distribution. Conservatively,theoverall 95.4%HPDrangeis -9/+8years. 
Cross Dating between Pinus Types 
Even if they are contemporaneous, different species can have different climate responses so thattheirtree-ringgrowthpatternsmaynot cross-date. While all our samples are Pinus spp., this possibility was a concern due to the multiple Pinus sp. types represented at both sites. As noted above and listedin Table1,four types of pine species are represented in the collection, and the La Quemada samples include species TypesI and III with theLos Pilarillos samples representingspeciesTypesII andIV andafew samplesofType III(Table1). Samplesof only Type I make up the La Quemada chronology of Cuartel Rooms E and K, and in the Los PilarillosNorth Banquette chronology onlyType II species are represented. The successful cross dating between the two chronologies indicates that Type I and II species have similar climate responses in their growth patterns. For species Types III andIV thereisnosupportingevidence of similargrowth patterns between them or the other species types, but that is not necessarily an indicatorofdifferentgrowth responses.Other reasons forthe unsuccessful cross datingofthose samples may be differences in represented time periods and short overlaps, as indicated by the earlier dates of LAQ 31 and the short sample LAQ 35, or, perhaps, a stronger nonclimatic growth response in these samples that masks theclimatesignalin the parent trees.The latter reasonis suggestedbythe absenceof cross dates between alltheType IV samplesfromthe same context atLos Pilarillos. 
Thetotal number of samples(25) is small, but the species distribution could be culturally signi.cant. The exclusive use of Type I pines at La Quemada Cuartel Rooms E and K and Type II in theNorth Banquette of LosPilarillos suggests that those particular species were each chosen for their respective buildings. Type III is the only type represented at both sites and suggests preference or availability, but the suggestion must be used with caution because only two samples of that type were found at each site.The chronological orderof thetypes atLa Quemada(fromtheearly samplesofType III to the later of Type I) and the 174-year lifespan of LAQ 31, however, may indicate that species Type III was plentiful when the site was .rst settled but that its availability quickly became limited (although pine types are not distinguished, Elliott [2012] .nds an overall stable use of wood in the Pinus genus during the La Quemada occupation). Whether the selection of the different types re.ects cultural preferences for speci.c wood charac­teristics, availability of the species, or a combi­nationof the twois unknownbut worth further research. 


Discussion 
We have made signi.cant progress in cross-dating archaeological tree-ring samples and wiggle-matching theirradiocarbon ages to place the resulting chronologies in real time and to beginto demonstratethe potentialfor tree-ring datingfor the.rstmillenniumADin northwest­ern Mexico. If we make the assumption that the last extant rings on all but one sample are closetooratthe bark and thereforewithinafew years ofthe felling date, we offer the following preliminary chronological .ndings and possible culturalinterpretations.All of the cal AD dates

below have ±4 range and represent the µ ± s dates fromthe tree-ring chronologyin Figure6 and thewiggle-matchin Figure8. 
The Cuartel 
Bothring measurementand wiggle-matchresults show that three beams from Rooms E and K within theCuartel complex (LAQ28–30) were cut within ~20 years ofeach other, after cal AD 711 ± 4 for Room E and for Room K after cal AD 726 ± 4(µ ± s ). One beam from the same room (LAQ 31) suggests an earlier construction, after cal AD 639 ± 4(µ ± s ). Giventhesize, strength,andgood preservationof thesesamples,weassume that theywere used as roof support beams. RoomKin particularwasa multistory interior room (Santos Ramírez 2014), whichwouldhaverequiredsubstantialstructural support. Thefact that thetwo samples(LAQ30 and 31) were found side by side in the same context, but the preserved tree rings and likely use dates are as much as 100 years apart, could supportthe remodelinginterpretationproposed by Santos Ramírez (2014). Perhaps the early beam was used during the initial construction phase, after cal AD 639 ± 4(µ ± s ), and due to its good condition was recycled during the second construction phase when the other beamswere cut,sometimeafter calAD 726 ± 4 (µ ± s ). 
In terms of a broader chronological inter­pretation regarding the Cuartel’s construction within the structural development of the site of La Quemada, our chronological evidence, compared with other radiocarbon dates from other researchers, suggests that theCuartel dates .t withinthebroad rangeof dates suggestedpre­viously (AD 500–800; Nelson 1997;Trombold 1990). More speci.cally, the later part of this wide range, after circa cal AD 639 to after circa cal AD 770, is consistent with the reanalysis of Nelson’s(1997)radiocarbon dates shownin Figure3.These dates, combined with thepromi­nent location of the Cuartel and its proximity to the central core, support the hypothesis that the Cuartel is one of the earliest constructions at La Quemada (Santos Ramírez 2014). The tree-ring 14Cwiggle-match dateindicatethat the reconstructionofthe Cuartel(aroundcalAD770 ± 4) potentially coincides with the beginning of the Terrace 18 construction episode during thelateeighth century AD.We emphasizethat this interpretationis based on minimal data and shouldbeusedonlyasahypothesistobe tested by future information, and not to reorient the regional chronology. 
The last extant tree ring in a sample from a possible beam in the temple on Terrace 18 (LAQ35) dates to cal AD 661 ± 4. Previously published dates from theimmediatesurrounding architectureinthesame room (Nelsonetal. 1997) indicatedarange between approximatelycalAD 600 and 740. In comparison, the LAQ 35 date seems like a plausible initial construction date. ThisTPQdateis consonantwiththemostlikely modeled calendar age range for the corncob (B-77239) found at the base of the Terrace 18 construction(cal AD 660–723, 65.8% HPD range, shown in Figure3). If our new dates are representative of cutting and building, then these dates for Terrace 18 are also consistent with the early date fromthe Cuartel, suggesting widespread site constructionwithinafew years. 
Los Pilarillos 
AsLosPilarillosissubstantially smallerthanLa Quemada, although still more elaborately built than most other valley sites, the relationship between the two is of particular interest to understanding Malpaso Valley cultural dynam­ics. Dendrochronology measurements and cross dating(Figures6 and8)place samplesPIL 13 and PIL 21 from roof fall in a large room on the highest mound at cal AD 770 ± 4(µ ± s ), about 50–100 years later than the major­ity of beamsinthe Cuartel(LAQ 28–31) and the Terrace 18 temple construction. This later dateis consistent with twointerpretations.First, the monumental architecture at Los Pilarillos could have been built signi.cantly later than the Cuartel and Terrace 18. In fact, PIL 15 (the other sample included in the cross date) while earlier than the other two Los Pilarillos samples, may indicate later construction than theLaQuemada datesduetoitslackofwaney edge and context. Second, since these dates are from roof construction, we must consider this context most vulnerable to degradation due to exposure to weather, and therefore the beam might have needed to be replaced after initial

construction. Thehypothesis that LosPilarillos was constructed more than 100 years after La Quemada may soon be addressed by ceramic seriation studies, which have identi.ed some time-sensitive ceramic markers(Torvinen et al. 2015).The contemporaneityofLAQ16indicates that La Quemada was still occupied at the time of thesettlementof LosPilarillos,butthe single LAQsample and its limited contextdo not allow further interpretation. 
Thesuccessful cross datingofsamples within each site and between thetwo site chronologies, plus thetentativeplacementsofthe singlesam­ples, all suggested and validated by their 14C dates, is an indication that with more samples,

tree-ring measurements, cross dating, and dating, a better understanding of chronological changes in the region is possible. Additional sampleswill augment thetree-ring datatoforma reference chronologyagainstwhichnewsamples can be cross-dated. A reference chronology is expected to correlate with tree-ring data from other sites in a larger region that can be used to reconstruct constructionsequences and spatial and temporal relationships between sites. The construction of a robust chronology also will be the basis for the next step in this project, to provide a regional record of climatic variability recorded in the ancient tree rings to reconstruct past environmental conditions. 


Conclusion 
Although preliminary, these studies have pro­duced optimistic results that dendrochronolog­ical methods are a viable source of study for northwest Mesoamerica and have the poten­tial to address questions that require .ne-scale chronologies that still elude archaeologists. Despite the fact that some of the cross-dated placements of wood samples from the Malpaso Valleyare tentativeduetothelackofsuf.ciently overlapping sequences,the con.rmationofthese placementsby the 14Cwiggle-match methodis encouraging supportthat theplacementsare cor­rect withinaminor rangeof error.Forexample, these datasuggestthat theHallofColumns–like structure at the site of Los Pilarillos was con­structedabout 50–100 yearslaterthanpartsofLa Quemada. Continued work with this collection and the addition of samples from new contexts, new sites, and neighboring regions, all of which wehave initiated, shouldinthe futureprovidea reference chronology that can be used to address more of these chronological questions. 
Of course,the culturalinterpretationisonlyas good as the data. Dendrochronological methods, even when they work perfectly, datethe speci.c time at which the tree was cut down. Archae­ologists must continue to interpret these dates with consideration of the culture and broader contexts in which the samples are found. In addition, one or more reference chronologies against which additional individual samples can be dated becomemorerobustwith potentialfor paleoclimatic analysis. In noting the need to expand the application, we conclude by taking advantage of this audience of practicing archae­ologists with an offer to examine any archae­ological wood that you may have from your excavations in this region. Although the method is partially destructive, the potential payoff is huge.With enough rings,samples mayprovide chronological data for your own sites and also contribute to an understanding of theprehistory of this dynamic region of Mesoamerica.
