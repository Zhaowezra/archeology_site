SOURCING CHIHUAHUAN POLYCHROME CERAMICS: ASSESSING 
MEDIO PERIOD ECONOMIC ORGANIZATION

Traditionally, the wide distribution of distinctive Chihuahuan polychrome ceramics has been interpreted as evidence for the extensive interaction sphere of Casas Grandes, or Paquime. The role of the major center of Paquime in the political and economic system is a crucial question in de.ning the nature and intensity of interactions in the Casas Grandes region and the extent of intraregional social and political integration. A large-scale, regional sourcing project using Chihuahuan polychrome ceramics provides new information on their production and distribution. It also demonstrates the limitations of ceramic sourcing analyses and presents a strong case for the fact that the underlying geology of a region determines the resolution at which ceramics can be attributed to production loci or resource procurement zones. 
La amplia distribución de la distintiva cerámica policromada de Casas Grandes se ha interpretado tradicionalmente como evidencia de una extensa esfera de interacciones de Casas Grandes o Paquimé. Determinar el rol que tuvo el centro mayor de Paquimé en el sistema político y económico es una pregunta importante para de.nir la naturaleza e intensidad de interacciones en la región de Casas Grandes y el nivel de integración social y política intrarregional. Un programa regional a gran escala con el objetivo de de.nir las fuentes de barro de la cerámica policromada de Casas Grandes proporciona nueva información sobre su producción y distribución. Además, las investigaciones demuestran las limitaciones del análisis de fuentes de producción de cerámica y ejempli.can la manera en que la geología de una región determina el nivel de resolución con el cual se puede atribuir la cerámica a lugares de producción o zonas de obtención de recursos naturales. 
T
he Casas Grandes region, including the site of Casas Grandes, or Paquime1 (Figure1),haslongbeen recognizedasan important prehistoric culturalregion(Bandelier 1892;Brand1943;Hewett1908;Lumholtz1902; Noguera 1926;Sayles1936). CharlesDiPeso’s work in the 1950s especially highlighted the importance of Paquime as a large “urbanized” center in the greater Southwest, by which we mean thesouthwestern UnitedStates and north­westernMexico(Di Peso 1974). 
Di PesointerpretedPaquime asamajor trade and production center during the height of its occupation, theMedio period, whichlasted from approximately AD 1200 until about 1400 (Dean and Ravesloot 1993; Ravesloot et al. 1995; seealsoBraniff 1986). Di Peso had placed the Medio period earlier, from about AD 1100 to about 1300,butWhalen and Minnis(2009:41– 70) recently analyzed 84 radiocarbon samples fromfour sitestothe westofPaquime provide further support for the revised dating for the Medio period. They divide it into an early (ca. AD 1200–1300) and late (AD 1300–ca. 1450) phase(Whalen and Minnis 2009:67–70).2 More recent archaeological research in northwestern Chihuahua has concentrated on de.ning the nature and the intensity of interaction in the Casas Grandes region and the extent of intra­regional social and political organization(e.g., Carpenter 2002; Douglas 1995; Douglas and MacWilliams 2015;Fish and Fish1999;Gamboa

Of particular interest is the question of how dominantPaquimewasinthe political and economic system. 
Among other archaeological evidence, the distributionofdiagnostic ceramicsis frequently used to model socioeconomic organization and exchange systems. Theextensivedistributionof distinctive Chihuahuan polychrome ceramics, forinstance, has been traditionally interpretedas evidence forthe wide interactionsphereofCasas Grandes (e.g., Brand 1935;Carpenter2002;Di Peso 1974:2:622–624; Phillips 1989:383–384; Woosleyand Olinger1993;see Figure1).Within 
theframeworkof theseresearch interests, oneof the questions is whether Paquime was a major producer of Chihuahuan polychrome pottery or if these ceramicswereproducedat multiple set­tlements.Inourstudy,weconcentrateonpainted ceramics becausethey are perceived tobe both temporally and culturally diagnostic, and their productionmayhave requiredspecialized skills. In this article,we addresstwo issues:weaimto contribute to a better understanding the socio­economic organizationofCasas Grandes and the challenges and limitations of ceramic sourcing. 


PolychromeCeramics and theCasas 
Grandes Economic System 

Many arguments regarding the economic role ofPaquime have focused on theproduction and

distributionofprestige goods,such as shell, cop­per, turquoise, and macaws (see Supplemental Text1foradiscussionof economic modelsand additional references). For a more comprehen­sive understanding of economic organization, however, it is important to consider other types of economic goods as well, including utilitarian objects (e.g., Carpenter 2002; Sprehn 2003, VanPool and Leonard 2002) and subsistence goods (e.g., Minnisetal. 2006).Various modesof exchange canbe operationalin themovementof prestige goods and other commodities. Prestige goods may have been part of an integrated exchange networkandmayhaveservedasaform of currencythat couldbetradedforother objects. Ontheother hand,theexchangeofdifferent types of goods couldhave been organized in different spheres (e.g., Adams 1974;Douglas[1992:19] and Carpenter [2002:163] argue for precisely that kind of scenario in the Casas Grandes regional system), and prestige goods may not have beenexchangeablefor other commodities such as subsistence goods (e.g., Bohannan 1955). Yet, prestige items maymediatethe movements of other materials(e.g.,Malinowski 1922). 
In most nonegalitarian societies, it is likely that elites tried to control access to rare, highly valued goods. The degree of control by the central authority of the production and distri­butionof other typesof goods,however,varies signi.cantly among different societies. If elites interfered with economic activities concerning nonprestige goods,itmay indicatea highdegree of elite power and control.3 Thus, the study of various goods is critical for the assessment of centralization and control by elites. Moreover, such studies servetoevaluatethedegreeof eco­nomic differentiation and integration. In many societies, high-skill and low-output production, such as metal work, tends to be conducted by specialists. If the production of other types of goods that aredistributed in larger quantitiesis also specialized, it may suggest a higher degree of economic differentiation and integration. 
In this regard, the study of ceramics is par­ticularly important. Ceramics are among the most abundant artifacts in the archaeological record, and they were usually produced in high quantities. Accordingly, in the Southwest, the distributionofdiagnostic ceramicsisfrequently used to model socioeconomic organization and exchange systems(e.g.,Abbott 1996;Habicht-Mauche 1995;HantmanandPlog1982;Hegmon et al. 1995;Lightfoot and Jewett1984;Upham 1982;Upham et al.1981). 
Late prehistoric Southwest polychrome ceramicsare particularlywell suitedforthestudy of economic systems and regional interaction because they exhibit rich stylistic information, and they are perceived as being both culturally and temporally diagnostic. The distribution of distinct Chihuahuan polychromes,forexample, has been interpretedasevidence fortheextensive interactionsphereofPaquime (Carpenter 2002; Di Peso 1974:2:622–624;Pailes and Reff 1985: 358; Phillips 1989:383–384; Woosley and Olinger 1993)and is generally used to delineate a Casas Grandes regional system (LeBlanc 1989;Whalen and Minnis1996, 2001). 
In terms of their sociopolitical meaning, Di Peso(1974:Vol.2)saw Chihuahuan polychrome ceramicsasprestige goods.Thisviewissimilar tothatofsome scholarsregardingthesocialfunc­tion of contemporaneous painted polychrome ceramicsinthe northern Southwest(e.g.,Cordell and Plog 1979; Lightfoot and Jewett 1984; Upham 1982).Di Pesoassumedthat Chihuahuan Polychromes were one of the principal high-value trade goods and that they were produced by highly specialized craftspersons living at Paquime.His argument,however,was not based on much archaeological evidence (see Minnis 1988:185). Except for a few pieces of un.red, utilitarian brownware, thereis little directevi­dence for pottery manufacture atPaquime, and possibletoolssuch as polishing stones and sherd scrapers are dispersed throughout the site (see also Sullivan 1988;Triadan1989).If thesetools wereusedin potterymanufacture,itmayindicate that ceramicswere not produced at specialfacil­ities. Moreover, a number of archaeologists are inclined to think that fourteenth-century South­west ceramics, including polychrome pottery, were produced at the household level and that access to them was neither restricted to nor controlled by elites (Crown 1994; Hagstrum 1995; Mills 1996; Mills and Crown 1995:13; Triadan1997;Zedeño1994;see also Pool1992). Douglas(1992)argues that most nonlocal ceram­icsfoundatPaquimemaynothavebeen prestige

goods.Thus,aninteresting questioniswhether or not this latter view of Southwest ceramic production equally applies to Chihuahuan polychromes. 
Basedonmorphologicaland stylistic analyses ofwholevessels, Sprehn(2003,2006)argues that some Chihuahuan polychromejars and incurved bowlswereproducedbypart-timespecialistsand that eliteswereusing theiconography on oneof thetypes,Ramos Polychrome, to transmitpower (see also VanPool and VanPool 2006, 2007, 2015). She measured standardization of vessel size and form and skill of design execution and found very low coef.cients of variations (CVs) for some of the variables she measured. Simi­larly,aregression analysisbyWhalenand Minnis (2009:159, Figure5.6, 163) indicates high stan­dardizationinthe formingofRamos Polychrome jars.IfChihuahuan polychromes were produced inamore centralized or specialized manner,this may indeed support the notion that Paquime was oneof themostdeveloped production and distribution centersin Southwestprehistory. 


PolychromeCeramicsinthe Casas 
Grandes Region 

At the beginning of the Medio period, the decoration on painted pottery at Paquime and contemporarysitesinthe CasasGrandes region changed from predominantly bichrome red-on­browntopolychrome, whiletheutilitarian coarse waresstayed more or less thesame. This change in painted decoration is a pan-Southwestern phenomenonin ceramic assemblages duringthis time(seeAdams1991:117; Carlson 1970, 1982; Crown 1994,1995,1996;Hays1991:26; Kintigh 1985;Montgomery and Reid1990;Smith1971). 
During the late thirteenth and throughout the fourteenth century AD, Chihuahuan poly­chromes were relatively abundant in an area that ranges from southeastern Arizona and south­westernNewMexico to theBabicoraplainsinthe south,andfromthe vicinityofVilla Ahumadato the easttotheBavispedrainagein northeastern Sonora(Brand 1935:Figure1, 1943; Carpenter 2002:Figure 1; Sayles 1936). Small quantities of these polychrome ceramics are also found in site assemblages asfarasthe GilaRiver basin,

themiddleRio Grande, aroundElPaso, andin Trincheras sitesin Sonora(Gallaga2004). 
In marked difference to other polychrome wares of this time period from other areas of the Southwest, Chihuahuan polychromes occur predominantly as ovoidjars (Figure2). Ef.gy

vessels are another distinct traitofChihuahuan Polychrome ceramics(Figure3). They occur as “hooded” jars,aswellaswhat Kidder(1916:258) called true ef.gies, and exhibit anthropomor­phic and zoomorphic features (e.g., Di Peso 1974:2:337–338; Hewett 1908:Plate XIV; Kid­der 1916:Plates I–III; Lumholtz 1902:Plates I–II). 
Various types of polychrome pottery have been identi.ed and described for the Medio period at Paquime (Di Peso et al. 1974:6:183– 316), the most abundant of which is Ramos Polychrome(Figure2a).Itisthe hallmarkofthe Chihuahuan polychrometraditionandisalsothe mostabundanttypeintheregion. BabicoraPoly­chrome(Figure2b)is thesecond mostabundant type of theMedio period polychrome ceramics. Villa Ahumada Polychrome(Figure2c) occurs in slightly lower frequencies at Paquime than Babicora Polychrome, and in very low numbers in assemblages of contemporary sites about 70 km to the northwest of Paquime (Whalen and Minnis 2001:114).Other polychrometypes such as Carretas,Corralitos, Dublan, Escondida, and Huerigos occur at Paquime and in very small numbersat sitesin northwesternChihuahua(Di Peso et al. 1974:6:534; Whalen and Minnis 2001:81–82, Figure 3.14). Also, some of these types are not easily classi.ed when found as sherds.(Fora more detailed description of the types and theirregional distribution, see Supple­mentalTexts1and2, Supplemental Figure1.) 
At Paquime, polychrome ceramics are not associated with speci.c archaeological contexts, nor are they unevenly distributed in any of the excavatedroom blocks(Di Pesoetal.1974:6:79). They are found in burials, on room .oors, and in room .ll, as well as in extramural areas, and in general seem to have been part ofhousehold assemblages. In fact, a number of polychrome jars show exterior sooting and were probably used for cooking (Di Peso 1974:2:532–533; Di Pesoetal. 1974:6:85–86).Forexample,Di Peso and colleagues (1974:6:251) record 39.4% of Ramos Polychromejarsassooted. Whalen and Minnis have extensively excavated four sites west of Paquime (Whalen and Minnis 2009:4, Figure1.2). Theyalso found polychrome ceram­icsinallexcavated contexts,including room .ll, on .oors, and in middens, at the one site where they recovered such sherds (Whalen and Minnis 2009:115–134). 


Sourcing ChihuahuanPolychromeCeramics 
To investigate the production and regional dis­tribution of Medio period polychrome ceram­ics in the Casas Grandes region, we initiated a large-scale sourcing project with extensive regional coverage in collaboration with the Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia Chihuahua; the Arizona State Museum and its now retired archaeological curator Michael Jacobs;thePaquimeRegional Project,directed by Michael Whalen and Paul Minnis; and the Chihuahua Archaeological Project, directed by JaneKelley and JoeStewart.One of the objec­tives was to compile a regional compositional

database for these ceramics. We decided to focus on Ramos, Babicora, andVilla Ahumada Polychrome because they are the most abun­dant and widelydistributed polychrometypesin theregion.We tookamultitechnique approach and employed instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA), petrography, and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). 
To date we have analyzed 655 samples of Chihuahuan polychrome ceramics from31 sites byINAA(Table1).We should emphasizethat the sample is heavily biased toward Paquime with from which 288 ceramics have been ana­lyzed.We also analyzed14 samplesof modern potterymadebytwopotters,ManuelOlivasfrom Casas Grandes and Manuela Dominguez from Anchondo, and took samples of the clays they used. Thus,the total numberof sampled pottery is 669 (see Table1). 
To determine the production loci for these ceramics, we carried out two raw material sur­veys covering an area of approximately 50 km2 and four majordrainages(Figure4). Oursample included clays that areusedbythe twomodern potters mentioned, as well as sources that are usedby pottersinthevillageofMataOrtiz(Bell 1994). In total, we analyzed 66 primary and secondaryclaysbyINAA (SupplementalTable 2).To determine themineralogyof the ceramics and someoftheclays,wealso analyzed52ofthe ceramics, including allthree types, and22 clays petrographically (SupplementalTables2and 3). (Foramore detaileddiscussionof methodsand samplingstrategies, see SupplementalText3).

BasedontheINAA,we wereabletode.nethree large compositional coregroups(Figures5a and 5b). We call these core groups because they formed themoststatistically robust groups.We included samples that had group membership probabilities of more than 1% for their own compositional group and lower probabilities of belonging to any other groups(Table2). Samples that showed similar probabilities of belongingtotwoormoregroups wereexcluded from the .nal grouping. When looking at

area (see Figure1, Supplemental Figure 2, and Supplemental Table 1). They also contain allthree polychrome types (see Table2). The sherds from Paquime come from all excavated room blocks (or units in Di Peso’sterminology; see Supplemental Table 1). These three core groups can be subdivided into several smaller compositional subgroups, and a large quantity of additional ceramics can be assigned to eight smallergroups (SupplementalTable1; see also Bishop et al. 1998). Theseeight smallergroups also all have some samples from Paquime and from regional sites, and they contain all three types. 
In additiontothe three coregroups and these smaller, mixed type, and mixed provenience groups,we can also de.netwogroups that con­tain predominantly Babicora Polychromes, des­ignated BabicoraGroups1and2(see Figures6a and 6b, Supplemental Table 1) for a total of 13 compositional groups.Mostof the sherdsin the Babicora 1 and 2 groups come from sites around theBabicoraBasin and the upper reaches of the SantaMaria and SantaClara Rivers (see Figure1). BabicoraGroup2(n = 19) consists exclusivelyofBabicora Polychromes anda little over half come from site CH I:9:1 (GP) (or 
H:9:1[ASM];see Supplemental Figure2 and Supplemental Text 3, which explains the site designation protocol) close to the Laguna de Babicora. This siteis probablylocatedinacluster of sites around the town of Las Varas, about 25km northeastofthe Lagunade Babicorathat is describedby Carey(1931:336, Figure3).Five sherds comefromCHH:11:5(GP)tothe eastof Babicora, and one sherd each comes from CH I:15:3(GP) andCH I:16:1(GP)inthe upper SantaMariaRivervalley andCH H:8:3(GP) to the northeast of Babicora, but there is also one sherd from CH F:6:1 (GP) in the group. ThissiteismostlikelyVilla Ahumada. Babicora Group 1 (n = 25) contains mostly Babicora Polychrome sherds (but also a few sherds that havealight browntobrown paste and areclearly paintedin Ramosstyle)andtwoVilla Ahumada sherds. Most of the sherds in this group come from sites in the upper reaches of the Santa MariaRiver southeastofNamiquipa(CHI:15:1 [GP],CHI:15:2[GP], CH I:15:3[GP]), from the upper SantaClaraRivervalley(CH I:16:1 [GP],CHI:16:2[GP]), andafew from sites closetothe Lagunade Babicora(CH I:9:11 [GP], CH I:9:5[GP]),but sixsherds that belong to this group were foundatPaquime (Supplemental Table1). 
Based on the differences in iron and trace element concentrations, the three large core groups probably represent three different clay sources that were used to make the pottery. It is interesting that all three of the core groups containthe threedifferent polychrometypes (see Supplemental Tables 1 and 2). In other words, some of the three different pottery types were made using the same clays, exploiting three different sources,ifnot more when one includes the smaller groups as potentially representing additional clay sources. Thereis littleevidence that special clay sources were used to make Ramos Polychrome. This coincides well with some of Sprehn’s(2003).ndings.Her analyses demonstrated thatovoidjars and incurvedbowls of thethree types showed similarstandardization

We emphasize that the proveniences of the sampled ceramics—that is, the sites where they were found—represent their consumption, not necessarily the loci of their production. If the ceramics were produced elsewhere, then their provenience also provides information about distributional patterns but not the mechanisms involved in their distribution (see Shepard

Of all analyzed prehistoric sherds(n = 655), 274 or 42% can be assigned to the three core groups, and an additional 205 or 31% can be assigned to the two southern groups and the eight smaller compositional groups. In total, 479 or 73% of all analyzed sherds can thus be assigned to compositional groups; 176 or 27% of the analyzed sherds remain unassigned. This is similartoresults forother largesourcing studies inthe Southwest(e.g.,Crown 1994:29,32,Table 3.1;Triadan 1997:32). 
Of all analyzed sherds fromPaquime(n = 288), 176 or 61%fall into thethree coregroups, and another (1.9%) can be assigned to Babicora Group 1. This lends support to the idea that the three core groups may in general represent productioninthe region aroundPaquime.If we look at all analyzed Ramos Polychrome(n = 328) fromall sampledsites,alittleoverhalf(170 or 51.8%) could be assigned to the three core groups. Of all analyzed Babicora Polychrome (n = 219),82 or 37.4% couldbeassignedtothe three core groups and 36 or 16.4% to the two southern Babicora groups, and of all analyzed Villa Ahumada(n = 108), 22 or 20.4% could be assigned to the three core groups. Again, if the three core groups represent production in and around Paquime, this could indicate that a substantial quantity of Ramos Polychrome pottery was produced in this area. Under the same assumption, this would also indicate that some Babicora andVilla Ahumada Polychromes were made in this area. The pattern of composi­tional attributionfor Babicora Polychromealso showsthat someof this potterywasmadein the southern periphery.Villa Ahumada Polychrome mayhave been made at severallocations outside this putativezoneof productionaroundPaquime. 
Of all the analyzed samples that were found at Paquime(n = 288), over 60% of both the Ramos and Babicora Polychrome (67.8 and 62.4% respectively) and 34.9% of the Villa Ahumada Polychrome can be assigned to the three core groups (see Supplemental Table 1). This indicates that peopleatPaquime consumed considerable quantities of the Ramos and Babi­cora vessels that may have been produced in and aroundthesettlement.BecauseBabicoraand Villa Ahumada Polychromes occur in similar quantities in Paquime excavation contexts (see our discussion above), which shows that their consumption was at similar levels, the lower percentage ofVilla Ahumada grouping with the three coregroups suggests that larger proportions of Villa Ahumada seem to have been brought in from other areas. We should reiterate that, overall,the quantitiesofBabicoraandVillaAhu­mada Polychrome are much lower than Ramos Polychrome atPaquime. 
When looking at the two Babicora groups, we can be more speci.c. The pattern described above suggests local production of these ceramicsinthe southernareaofthe Chihuahuan polychrome distribution zone and fairly localized consumption for most of them. If these two groups indeed represent southern production, then the sherds from Paquime that fall into Babicora Group 1 indicate that some pottery, speci.cally Babicora Polychrome, from these areas reached Paquime. This supports Sprehn’s (2003:238) assumption that vessels may have moved into Paquime from other areas demonstratinglong-distance connections. Interestingly, all of the brown-paste, Ramos-style sherds in Babicora Group 1 are from the southernsites, while allthe sherds fromPaquime thatfall into this group areBabicora Polychrome (see Supplemental Table 1). The brown-paste, Ramos-style sherds assigned to this group may indicate that people tried to emulate Ramos Polychrome in this southern area using locally availablematerials.Triadan(1997:94) describes a similar scenario for fourteenth-century Fourmile Polychrome of the White Mountain RedWareseriesatGrasshopper Pueblo. 
Instrumental Neutron Activation Analysis of Modern Pottery 
Our results also show that the 14 samples of modern pottery haveno compositional similarity with any of the prehistoric sherds. As a next step we compared clays that were used by the modern potters to their own pottery wasters

(SupplementalTable2).Theclaythat Anchondo potterManuelaDominguez uses (CHC20) does not match her pottery compositionally. Potas­sium, chromium,iron,andsomeoftherareearth element concentrations are signi.cantly higher in the clay than the wasters, while the cesium concentrationis considerablylower in theclay thanin thewasters.The potterlevigates her clay (see Rice 1987:18), which could account for someof thedilutionthat we seeinthe modern sherds, while the considerable amount of sand that she adds as temper could account for the enrichment of the other elements. 
In the case of the modern pottery of Manuel Olivas from Casas Grandes, secondary clays from the Laguna del Fierro to the southeast of the town of Nuevo Casas Grandes (samples CHC06, CHC07, and CHC08), a road-building pit close to the potter’s home(CHC09), and a brown clay from the Convento site (Di Peso 1974:Vol. 1; CHC10) generally are a better .t with his wasters than clays from a primary source to the northeast of the potter’s work­shop (samples CC111, CC112, CC113, CHC16, CHC17, CHC18, CHC19) that he also uses (see SupplementalTable2). Basedonprincipal components analysis calculated on the basis of the modern sherds, at 99.99% variance the probabilities for the secondary clays to match the sherds range from 30 to 57%. This potter also levigates his materials and mixes several clays from different sources together. He also uses considerable quantities of alluvial sand as temper.Theseresults indicatethatthetechnology ofthesetwomodern pottersisdifferentfromthe technology employedby theprehistoric potters, whichwediscuss below.We believe that these differencesin manufacturingtechnology,aswell as the use of different raw material sources, can accountforthefact thatthemodernsherdsdonot matchthe prehistoric pottery.Moreimportantly though, the example of the Anchondo pottery showsthat paste preparation can resultin pottery that does not chemically resemble the clay that wasusedfor its manufacture. 
Petrography 
Fifty-two Chihuahuan polychrome sherds and 22 clay samples that were analyzed by INAA were also subject to petrographic analysis (Supplemental Table 3). The samples included Ramos, Babicora, and Villa Ahumada sherds. They were alltaken fromthe Sayles collections at theArizona StateMuseum (see Supplemental Table 1 for provenience details) and included sherds fromPaquime,sitesinthe CasasGrandes Rivervalley(site numbersthat startwithCHE), and sitesfromthe peripheryof the polychrome distribution area (Figure1 and Supplemental Figure 2). Samples were chosen from each of the potential subgroups of the three large core groups,the small compositional groups, and the two Babicora groups (Bishop et al. 1998)to investigatewhetherdifferent temper recipes were used that correlate with the three polychrome types or the compositional groups. The analy­sis revealed that most of the sherds contained fairly large, angular rhyolitic ash fragments— basically, crushed rhyolite rock. We could not distinguish speci.c temper groups based on the mineralogy. It should be emphasized that we also could not discern anydifferences in temper between Ramos, Babicora, and Villa Ahumada Polychrome. That is to say, Ramos Polychrome contained the same type of inclusions as the other two types. This supports Di Peso and coauthors’ observationthat “itwould appear that the paste of most pottery types was essentially similar, particularly in the case of the Medio period ceramics, as the potters added to their moist clay base opaque white angular particles (probablytuff), along with some clear crystalline grains (probably phenocrysts), andafewvaried colored ones, such as red, black, yellow, and tan” (Di Peso et al. 1974:6:1). The petrography thus indicates that similar paste recipes were used for ceramics that were distributed over a wide area. In contrast, the analyzed primary source clays that areweatheringinsituinrhy­olite deposits contain heavily weathered rock fragments, which were absent in the analyzed sherds. Rhyolite, capped by younger basalts, forms the hills west of the Casas Grandes River(Secretaríade ProgramaciónyPresupuesto 1989a, 1989b) and is thus easily available as a tempering material. In that sense the temper we observedinthe samples couldbe considered local.Rhyolitesformthe bedrockof theSierra Madre, however, and thus occur throughout the ceramic distribution area. Petrographic analysis

of Ramos Polychrome sherds from Joyce Well in southwestern New Mexico shows that they all had crushed or decomposed rock temper from igneous sources and could be sorted into three larger temper groups containing welded tuffs, latite, or crushed conglomerates (Carpen­ter 2002:157–159).Carpenter argues that these tempersindicatethat theywere produced locally. Thetuffand conglomeratewereavailablearound Joyce Well. The latite source is about 16 km north of the site. Because we have not been abletodirectly comparethinsections fromJoyce Well with our samples, it is dif.cult to say how different they actually arefrom each other,but crushed rock seems to have been a temper of choice atJoyceWell. 
Our petrographic .ndings have important implications regarding the technology of Chi­huahuan polychrome production. Based on the chemistry, we arefairly certain that theprehis­toric potters used noncalcareous primary clays. Primaryclays areoften notvery plastic and hard towork(Rice 1987:37; Shepard 1985:11),andif they were used for pottery production, some of the coarser nonplastic inclusions mayhave been removedbythe potters.Adding temperis usually not required because these clays have plenty of naturally occurring nonplastic inclusions. The results of the petrographic analysis, however, show that theprehistoric potters actually added crushed rhyolitic ash as temper. One sample shows signatures of crushing in the form of a conchoidal fracture in a quartz fragment. This indicates that the clays must have been substan­tially processedtomakethe polychrome pottery. It looks as if the naturally occurring coarse, weathered, nonplastic fractions were removed, maybebysievingorwinnowing,andthen temper was added deliberatelytothe paste.The modern pottersintheCasas Grandesregionlevigate their clays, but there is no archaeological evidence that the prehistoric potters used this method. Thereisalsonoevidence that Native Americans used levigationhistorically.For instance, Shep­ard(1985:52) states that “although potters take great care and spend much timeremoving coarse particles of clay, and although their methods are varied,Ihavefound no recordof an American Indian potter levigating clay.” Instead, prehis­toric potters mayhaveusedwinnowing baskets to remove coarse particles from the clay after itwasdried and crushed.Forexample, sieving is often used in clay preparation by traditional potters (seeDillingham 1992:44;Fontana et al. 1962:51, Figure 43, 56; Guthe 1925:Plate 9, 19). 
The potters who made Chihuahuan poly­chromes seem to have employed a paste prepa­ration technology that is very labor intensive, and different from other areas of the greater Southwest.In otherregions,suchasthesouthern Colorado Plateau, theMogollonMountains, and theHohokam area, contemporaneous prehistoric potters used well-sorted, plastic secondary clays and added different types of temper to make polychrome ceramics(e.g.,Crown 1994:41;Tri­adan 1997:32–40, 49; Triadan et al. 2002). In general,secondaryclays arepreferredby tradi­tional potters becausethey are widelyavailable, .ner, better sorted, and have less nonplastic inclusions and are thus easier to work with (Shepard 1985:51). 
Laser Ablation Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry 
We analyzed a subsample of each of the three compositional coregroups and allprimary clays by laser ablationICP-MSin collaboration with HectorNeffof CaliforniaStateUniversity,Long Beach (see SupplementalTables1,2, and4, and 5). The objective was to analyze only the .ne matrixof thesherdsamples.We hoped that with this approach we could eliminate the potential distortingeffectsoftemper and naturally occur­ring nonplastic inclusions (see Neff et al. 1988, 1989), and possibly be able to correlate some of thesampled source clays with theprehistoric pottery. 
Matching source clays to ceramicsisdif.cult because potters almost never use clays as they arefoundin nature (seeTriadan 1997:17–18 for a discussion). As mentioned, they usually add nonplastic materialsastemper and mayevenmix clays to obtain desired propertiesfor the pastes. INAAisabulk chemical analysis,meaning that both clay and temper are represented in the elemental pro.les measured by this technique (Neff et al. 1988, 1989). Thus, .nding source clays that match ceramics is rare, apart from the dif.culty of actually locating sources that were used to make prehistoric pottery.Weused

the laser ablation study as an additional test to evaluatewhetherany ofthe sampledclays could havebeenusedtomakethe ceramicsrepresented in thethree compositional coregroups. 
We analyzed 30 sherds that were assigned to thethree compositional coregroups determined byINAA. Theselected sample consisted of10 sherds for each core group that had 70–100% probabilityof belongingto theirrespectivegroup (see SupplementalTable1and5).Asmentioned, we also analyzed all of the sampled primary clays(n = 19; see Supplemental Table 2). In total, we analyzed 49 samplesbylaser ablation ICP-MS.The laser ablationICP-MSreplicated thegroups determinedbyINAA,except fortwo samplesthat fell into different groups than those determinedbyINAA(see SupplementalTable4). This indicates thattheclaymatrixofthe sherdsis an important contributortothe chemical pro.les of thegroups.Nevertheless, we could not match anyofthe analyzed clays to thesherds,however. 


Conclusions 
The same clays from at least three sources seemed to have been used to make a large quantity of allthree analyzed Chihuahuan poly­chrome types. In addition, the petrographic analsis revealed that there was no difference in the tempering materials used in the production of thesethree types.Thissuggests that accessto speci.c raw material sources was not restricted, and that manypotters had accesstothe threeclay sources represented by the three compositional coregroups.Italsoindicates that thetechnology involvedin making thethree ceramic typeswas thesame. Theseresults stronglysupportthe idea that themakersofRamos Polychromewere not using special clay sources or paste recipes. 
Our study provided new details about the manufacturing technology of the polychrome ceramics. People in the Casas Grandes region seem to have used primary, residual clays and crushed rhyolite temper to make these vessels. This indicates sophisticated paste processing techniques,verydifferent from other regionsin the greater Southwest, where potters generally used well-sorted secondary alluvial clays and then added the appropriate tempering agents(see Triadan 1997:32–40, 49; Triadan et al. 2002). The petrographic analysis has also shown a remarkably consistent general paste recipe for producing thethree polychrometypes.Follow­ing Whalen and Minnis’s (2009) convincing argument, some Babicora Polychrome samples may date to the early Medio period. If that is the case, then we see continuity in resource exploitation and general technology, supporting their argument for the local development of the polychrome pottery tradition. 
We are not yet able to attribute production to speci.c sites or even circumscribed resource procurement zones (see Rands and Bishop 1980). Thereare several potentialreasons forthis: One possibility is that we might not have found the actual sources that were used prehistorically. Alternatively, paste preparation, especially the use of rhyolitic ash, may have altered the bulk chemical compositionsofthesherdstoadegree that they cannot be matched with source clays. The laser ablation ICP-MS of the .ne-grained matrix of the sherds reproduced the chemical groups, however, which indicates that the clay signature in the analyzed prehistoric pottery is robust and contributes signi.cantly to the bulk compositional pro.lesof thesherds.We believe that themainreason for our dif.cultiesinmatch­ingsource clays to the compositional groups lies in the regional geology. 
The geology in northern Chihuahua is rel­atively uniform over a large region (Secre­taría de Programación y Presupuesto 1989a, 1989b). In general, the areas to the west of the CasasGrandesRiver consistof massiverhyolite deposits cappedby basalts.Thus,onthe macro-level, there is not much geological variability even between different drainage basins. On the other hand, within these rhyolitic deposits, the variability of rare earth concentrations is high. For instance, there is relatively high elemental variability between sampled source clays that are located relatively near each other, and we couldnot establishsystematic trendsin rare earth concentrations over a sampled area of approxi­mately50km2,coveringfourdifferent drainages. It seems clear that in this geologic environment, .nding speci.c, characteristic, local chemical signatures is exceedinglydif.cult. 
Establishing place of production based on comparisons with raw materials is dif.cult in the bestofcircumstances.An approach that uses rawmaterialsto establishprovenancebeyondthe

macro-regionallevel may notbe possibleinthe CasasGrandesregion.Forahigherlevelofreso­lution,suchas drainage basinsorindividualsites, the onlypromising approach maybetoestablish compositional reference groups that are linked to speci.c production loci, such as wasters or un.red potteryofthetypes analyzedinthestudy (see Schneider et al. 1979).Unfortunately,to date we are notawareofanyavailablearchaeological material that would satisfy these criteria. 
Polychrome ceramics from all excavated room blocks at Paquime were assigned to the three coregroups,which suggests that allthree sampledtypes were likelymade ona household basis by many producers and that they were predominantly domestic goods.It alsosuggests that their consumption was not restricted to a small segment of the population of Paquime (see also Rakita and Cruz 2015:64, 81; Sprehn 2003:215). The fact that we can distinguish manycompositional groups,albeit not allaswell de.nedasthethree coregroups,indicatesthatthe productionofthe three polychrometypeswasnot very centralized. This observation is supported by Cruz Antillón and coauthors (2004). They present resultsoftheirinvestigationsat threesites located east and southeastofthe CasasGrandes valley. Based primarily on the distributions of polychrome ceramics in these sites, they argue that the regional economic system was not very well integrated and that thereisnoevidence that Paquime controlled the regional economic sys­temorfunctioned asalarge-scaleredistribution center.Whalenand Minnis’s(2009)and Pitezel’s (2011)ceramic data fromexcavatedsitessupport this interpretation. They also show that poly­chrome ceramicsare foundinall contextsin their sites, refutingrestricted consumptionby asmall segment of their populations. 
Sprehn’s(2003) analysis does showahigh level of standardization for the forming of incurved bowls and ovoid jars of the three polychrometypes,andhigh skilllevelsin design execution, whichlead her to conclude that these vessels,and especiallyRamosjars,weremadeby part-time specialists. It should be emphasized, though, that she analyzed whole vessels from museum collections.Mostofthesevesselshadno secureproveniences and only42 ofthe 699 that she analyzed were from Paquime. Considering

that most vessels came from looted contexts and thus predominantly from burials, it may very well be that there is an inherent bias for relatively bettermadevesselsin her sample.In general, there is quite a range in the skill of designexecutiononRamos Polychromevessels. Figure7 showsthreevessels from theArizona StateMuseum collections. Figure7amay have

been a vessel made by somebody still learning to paint the design. Figure7bisrepresentative of what we would call a typical Ramos jar, and Figure7c shows a vessel with superior designexecution.Vessels thatexhibitthistypeof painting complexity and sophistication are rare in both museum collections and archaeological sherdassemblages.Nevertheless, theCV values for ovoid jars of Ramos, Babicora, and Villa Ahumada Polychromes show high standardiza­tioninforming thevessels, and higher skill for decoratingRamos Polychromein general.Soit is quite plausible that some vessels were made by specialists for special occasions and maybe peopleofrelativelyhigher social status.The lack of evidence of anyceramic workshop activities, however, suggests that thesespecialists operated within theirown households.Wealso notethat theCVvalues forthevariables Sprehn measured were comparable for the whole Casas Grandes region (Sprehn 2003:210–230), indicating that production skills were high regardless of where the polychromes were made. 
Similarly,VanPool and Leonard(2002)argue that highly standardized metates possibly were made by many specialists: “If specialists pro­duced utilitarian items such as metates, then the scale of specialized production (sensu Costin 1991) indicates that specialized production was not somethinginwhichonlyafewpeoplepartic­ipated,butwas insteadafundamental organizing principle of the system centered at Paquimé” (VanPool and Leonard 2002:712). Like Ramos Polychrome ceramics, they were consumed by many households, and access does not seem to have been restricted, although the authors do suggest that these metates signify status dif­ferentiation at Paquime (VanPool and Leonard 2002:725–726). 
Whalen and Minnis’s ceramic analyses (2009:167–169, Table 5.4) show that vessels fromPaquime tendtobelarger,but their anal­yses included all ceramics, and the majority were unpainted. They postulate that there may have been more emphasis on public feasting at Paquime and that these vessels were used for social and political purposes (Whalen and Minnis 2009:150–180). They also note that Paquime has much higher frequencies of polychrome pottery (18% of all recorded pottery) than the two small sites they excavated, which had 3– 5% polychromes.Nonetheless, their earliersys­tematic surface collections (Whalen and Minnis 1995) have frequencies that range from 1.8 to 18.2%, and the frequency at Paquime is well within the range observed for fourteenth-century sites with varied painted wares and types in other areas of the Southwest(Triadan 1997:58–64, 97, 2013:218–225; Zedeño and Triadan2000). The contextsin whichthey were found – and therefore the consumption patterns 
– are also comparable. We thus contend that themajorityof Chihuahuan polychromevessels, including Ramos Polychromes, were probably made and certainly usedbyabroad segmentof population of Paquime. This is also supported byarecent iconographic analysisof Chihuahuan polychromewholevesselsby Searcy(2014).He found that decorativemotifsthathe believesare associated with Mesoamerican in.uence were essentially equally distributedinwhathe de.nes as more hierarchically organized sites and sim­pler sitesinthe region (Searcy 2014:66–68). 
The question of whether Paquime was a major producer of polychrome and especially Ramos Polychrome ceramics cannot be de.ni­tivelyansweredatthis timewecannot matchany ofthe coregroupstorawmaterialsources close to Paquime. Similarly, petrographic studies of the ceramics revealed no mineralogical distinctions. Based on the overall volume of these polychromes at the site and in the region, and thefact that 61%of analyzed ceramics from Paquime canbe assignedtothethree coregroups, we believe that a signi.cant portion of these vessels were probably produced at Paquime or at least in the core area of distribution. If the three core groups represent production in and around Paquime, then that would also suggestthat signi.cant quantitiesofthis pottery were consumed atPaquime and that some of it moved out in alldirections into thedistribution area. This should not be surprising, given that Paquime and thefour sampledsitesinthe core area are the largest settlements with the most people, and thus theseresults maysimplyre.ect population densities.Theresultsdonot preclude the possibility that polychrome ceramics were also produced outside the core area and that some moved into Paquime and surrounding

settlements.Infact,someBabicora Polychrome probably came to Paquime from the southern areas of the polychrome ceramic distribution zone. It should be kept in mind, however, that none of the other smaller compositional groups consistedof ceramicsthat camepredominantly from a speci.c site or area such as the northern fringesof thedistributionsphereinsouthernNew Mexico, except for the two Babicora groups. Those two groups suggest that some Babicora Polychrome and some brown-paste, Ramos-style ceramics were made in the southern parts of the distribution area and seem to have been distributed and consumed mostly in that region. 
In summary, many Chihuahuan polychrome ceramics, including Ramos Polychrome, were likelymade atPaquime and surrounding settle­ments, probablybymanyhouseholds,butitis not clear that Paquime dominated their production and distribution. Access to polychrome vessels was not restricted, and allsegmentsofthe popu­lationseemtohaveusedthemforoften mundane activities, such as cooking, indicating that the ceramicswere notaprestige item controlledby people with relatively higher status. This sup­ports an interpretationthat economyofPaquime wasnotvery centralized or politically integrated.

Notes 
1. 
Casas Grandes and Paquime are currently in use as names for the site (see Van Pool et al. 2008; Whalen and Minnis 2009). Both mean “Big Houses.” We have no preferencebut,likePitezel(2011),usePaquimeheretomake it easierto distinguishthesitefromtheregion. 

2. 
These new dates supportLekson’s(1984)original suggestion that there was an early and late component to theMedio period, basedonthe presence or absenceofGila Polychrome.Stewart andcolleagues(2004, 2005)have also suggested an early and late phase forthe Medioperiodbased on theirworkin theBabicora Basin. 

3. 
For example, Minnis and colleagues (2006) argue that some food production was centralized and possibly supervisedbyPaquime elites,someofwhomlivedatspecial sites.
