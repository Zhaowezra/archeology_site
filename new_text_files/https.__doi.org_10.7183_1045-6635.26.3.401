DUAL STRATEGIES OF THE RURAL ELITES: 
EXPLORING THE INTERSECTION OF REGIONAL AND LOCAL 
TRANSFORMATIONS IN THE LURIN VALLEY, PERU 

Giancarlo Marcone and Enrique Lopez-Hurtado 
In this paper, we examine recently recovered data from two sites belonging to different 
chronological periods in the Lur{n Valley of the Peruvian central coast. We discuss in a comparative framework how rural elites in the settlements of Late B and Panquilma saw their lives transformed while dealing with the intrusion of the Lima polity and the Inkas, respectively. Each site presents evidence of at least two sets of ritual and feasting activities, one in domestic contexts and another associated with monumental architecture. We propose that in both cases the rural elites of these two sites implemented a set of mutually constituted strategies when dealing with outside political influence. These strategies were oriented upwards to deal with changes at the regional level as well as downwards to maintain their privileged position in their own communities during moments of change. These parallel strategies were developed through a complex interplay of economics, ideology, and public prestige available to the elites. In the case of Late B, the rural elites acquired economic power, consolidating a loose level of leadership by sacrificing part of their public prestige. At Panquilma, we find evidence for the existence of rural elites with a solid economic position who were compelled to search for legitimization and prestige in the local realm rather than by participating in a new and larger economic system. 
En el presente art{culo comparamos los datos obtenidos de las excavaciones realizadas en dos sitios de diferentes periodos, ubicados en el valle de Lur{n, en la costa central peruana. Nuestro antilisis de los asentamientos de Lote B y Panquilma examina comparativamente c6mo las elites rurales vieron sus vidas transformadas, en tanto que tuvieron que hacer frente a la intromisi6n de los Lima ya la expansion Inca, respectivamente. En estos dos sitios las excavaciones revelaron la presencia de al menos dos conjuntos rituales, uno realizado en contextos domesticos y otro llevado a cabo dentro de la arquitectura monumental. Nosotros proponemos que en ambos casos, las elites rurales establecidas en estos dos sitios implementaron estra­tegias paralelas de respuesta a las influencias poUticas externas. Estas estrategias fueron orientadas en algunos casos hacia arriba, para hacer frente a los cambios en el nivel regional, y en otros hacia abajo, para mantener su posici6n privilegiada dentro de sus propias comunidades durante estos momentos de cambio poUtico. Dichas estrategias se desarrollaron a traves de una compleja interacci6n entre factores econ6micos e ideol6gicos, enfunci6n de las nuevas oportunidades derivadas del cambio a nivel regional. Nuestro estudio demostr6 que, para las elites de Lote B, la bUsqueda del poder econ6mico y de la consolidaci6n su liderazgo, termin6 ocasionando la perdida de independencia y prestigio social. En Panquilma se demuestra la existencia de una elite rural econ6micamente s6lida, inmersa en la bUsqueda de legitimaci6n y prestigio en el timbito regional, mas que su participaci6n en un nuevo sistema econ6mico.

groups in the Lurin Valley of the Peruvian central coast, and the role they played in the integration of the valley within regional politics at the onset of the Middle and Late Horizon periods. To this end, we will compare the development of power strategies within these intermediate groups, in­corporating new data from the sites of Lote B (ca. A.D. 200-700) and Panquilma (ca. A.D. 1000-1470). 
We seek to show that the power strategies these groups developed did not depend exclu­sively on the regional political context and were not solely the result of social conjunctures at the community level. We propose that, in both cases, intermediate groups (referred to as rural elites in this article) implemented two sets of mutually constituted strategies when dealing with outside political influence at each of these two sites. These strategies were oriented upwards to deal with changes at the regional level as well as downwards to maintain their privileged position in their own communities during these moments of change. These power strategies were developed in a complex interplay of economics, ideology, and sources of public prestige available to them. As a result, in one of our cases, rural elites achieved economic power, solidifying a previ­ously loose leadership by sacrificing part of their autonomy and public prestige. In the other case, the economic means of the rural elites were solid, and this compelled them to seek legitimization and prestige in the regional realm and to forego participation in a new economic system. 
Intermediate Elites, Local Elites, and Lurin Rural Elites 
Recently, Elson and Covey (2006:7) have called our attention to the study of the intermediate levels of society in order to understand the negotiation processes between the ruling elite and the wishes of the commoners. They identify intermediate elites as those groups that hold social power at the local level but are still under the control of a more powerful and influential elite located at the top of the regional political hierarchy. In their vi­sion, the head of a pan-regional state or empire acted as ruling elite, and the regional leaders of subordinate polities acted as intermediate elites (Elson and Covey, ed. 2006). Although highly il­lustrative of the capability of these intermediate groups to act as a hinge between regional and local arenas, the book has a bias toward state­level societies and empires. This bias comes with the risk that intermediate social positions are con­ceptualized as a static social category. As is ex­plicitly stated by Tung and Cook (2006:69) in the same volume, the aim is not to replace the elite­versus-commoner dichotomy with a three-way scheme, but instead to recognize that there are different social levels and that each one of these steps in the political hierarchy of a society has to deal with two fronts of action. Despite not neces­sarily being considered "elites," these intermediate 
groups exert some degree of power over other groups in society. Sometimes they will be regional rulers under the control of an expansive state but with power over people inside their region. Other times they are people socially located between these regional rulers and the communities. In gen­eral, we can say that social actors caught in a di­alectic relation with social groups above and be­low them can be understood as members of an intermediate group. 
Among the different possible intermediate so­cial situations, this article specifically deals with the intermediate groups who settled in the Lurfn Valley during two distinct but comparable time periods. We found evidence to indicate that during both periods the Lurfn Valley was characterized by the presence of competing dispersed settle­ments with relative autonomy, headed by local­level community leaders. In both cases, the dis­persed settlements of these leaders were located in direct relation to the agricultural fields-a pat­tern that differs from the centralized organization identified in neighboring valleys like the Rfmac Valley. We are calling these intermediate groups in the Lurin Valley "rural elites" so we can dif­ferentiate them from regional elite groups and other intermediate groups living in more central­ized (although not necessarily urban) settings in the Rfmac and Chill6n valleys. 
Studying Intermediate Groups 
In the Andean region, intermediate groups have traditionally been seen as links in administrative 
chains or steps in a bureaucratic ladder (Burger 1989:53). In this view, states and empires are con­ceived as political systems in which the flow of

information (religious, administrative, economic) between segments of society was a necessary con­dition to ensure the viability of the system (Burger 1989: 53; Topic 2003:244-245). In order to guar­antee the flow of information to different segments of society, it would have been necessary for states and empires to adapt to the variability existing within their own sphere of influence. This adap­tation was accomplished by copying or replacing local forms of leadership (Covey 2000: 119-120). In this view, leadership at the local level was trans­formed in relation to the level of involvement and type of administration that the state or empire de­cided to have in any given region (Covey 2003:349; Topic 2003:244). 
Many archaeologists have increasingly criti­cized this approach as a top-down perspective that ignores local agency (e.g., Conlee 2003; Goldstein 2000; Wernke 2006). As a more bot­tom-up alternative, scholars have highlighted how local leaders were permanently contesting re­gional power through resistance, acquiescence, or negotiation in terms of their own narrow po­litical agenda (Goldstein 2000; Stein 2005:1-29; Dillehay et al. 2006:249-256). From this point of view, local leadership is understood as a locally based process guided mainly by local leaders. Following these polarized positions, intermediate groups are seen as either highly dependent on overreaching rulers and interregional interactions or as highly independent, driven by their own benefit, but constrained by their local context. Both explanations have proven to be limited in understanding the variability and complexity of social processes in the archaeological record (Dillehay et al. 2006). 
How does one take part in this new system, or take advantage of it, without losing local support? How do local elites recognize or accept new re­gional authorities without losing face at the local level? Starting with the basic idea that any social group is immersed in a dialectical relationship be­tween what is above it and what is below it (Tung and Cook 2006:69), it is possible to hypothesize that intermediate groups were forced to respond to political transformations on two different but parallel fronts: the regional political organization and the local community. Were the actions of in­termediate elites toward the groups above and be­low them interconnected or independent? One possibility is that intermediate elites would be­come involved in regional power-building strate­gies that they already used locally before. Alter­natively, interaction with primary elites and their institutions may have led intermediate elites to duplicate these strategies locally. A third scenario is one in which intermediate elites engaged in dif­ferent but related strategies on these fronts. So, for example, their local strategy may have in­volved control over local ritual activities with cer­emonial items, while their regional relationship with primary elites was articulated through circu­lation of these items. Finally, the dual power strate­gies may have been in different realms altogether. Therefore, the study of intermediate groups should be centered on the study of the factors underlying their different power strategies. 
For analytical purposes, and building from an extended literature discussing the basis of power differentials and social inequality, we can divide the factors composing these political strategies into two broad types. The first is related to eco­nomic accumulation and wealth differences (Costin and Earle 1989:691; Daltroy and Earle 1985: 187-206). The second highlights leadership and social status as flowing from prestige strate­gies and ideology (Conrad and Demarest 1984:4-5; DeMarris et al 1996:18; Goldstein 2000:335-336). Most archaeologists agree that, even while these factors frequently co-occur in the same power strategy, some factors will be more important than others in any particular set­ting (De Marrais et al. 1996: 19-21). Political and social turmoil like that documented at the onset of both the Middle and Late Horizon periods is an example of this kind of particular setting. 
Rural Elites in the Lorin Valley 
The Lurfn Valley (Figure 1) has been surveyed and prospected numerous times. We have, nonetheless, only a partial image of its settlement patterns through time. Based on this fragmented information, most of the sites with domestic ar­chitecture identified in the valley can be associ­ated with two very different chronological peri­ods. The first spans more or less from the Early Intermediate to the beginning of the Middle Hori­zon period (ca. A.D. 500-800), and the second corresponds to the late occupations of the valley

immediately before-or contemporary with-the presence of the Inkas (ca. A.D. 1100-1535). No settlements are known between these periods for this valley and most of the Peruvian central coast (Segura and Shimada 2010). 
The settlement pattern s from these two periods present important similarities. Contrary to what can be observed in neighboring valleys like Rfmac and Chi116n, the Lurfn Valley presents a dispersed settlement pattern throughout its sequence. There are no large populated centers where the evidence of domestic architecture might allow one to as­sume large conglomerations of people or a clear hierarchy of sites. The only exception is Pacha­camac , which was a site with pan-regional oracu­lar functions, only proven for the Late Horizon period and without evidence of centralized or even permanent population. Furthermore , we still have a limited understanding of its size, scale of influ­ence, and importance in other periods of the Lurfn Valley historical sequence. The idea that Pacha­camac was the political and economic center of the valley, in addition to its religious center, has been constructed from ethnohistorical accounts projected uncritically to all the prehispanic periods 
and not supported by archaeological evidence. 
We propose that the leaders of the dispersed settlements of the Lurfn Valley during both chronological periods were rural elites with a rel­ative degree of autonomy. The term "rural" is used here to distinguish these dispersed commu­nities and their leaders from the inhabitants of sites in other areas of the central coast, such as the Rfmac Valley, that had larger concentrations of population but do not necessarily correspond to a classic definition of an urban setting (see Makowski [2008] for a more detailed discussion of the risks involved in the use of the term "urban" in Andean archaeology). 
Nonetheless, these two settlement patterns pre­sent important differences. During the Early In­termediate/Middle Horizon, the population den­sity was low, monumental sites were isolated from domestic residences, and, in general, mate­rial culture was limited. The houses were simple, perishable structures made out of stone and mud. In contrast, during the Late Intermediate/Late Horizon periods the population density seems to have been larger, the sites had complex and well­preserved architecture, and they were located ba-

sically at every possible quebrada or waterway. The quantity of artifacts recovered at these sites is impressive, especially when it comes to ce­ramics. Monumental buildings were not isolated but rather incorporated into the settlements, and almost every settlement had its own monumental structures (Eeckhout 2004:406-407; Lopez-Hur­tado 2011:71-72). These settlements do not pre­sent noticeable distinctions in size or in the char­acteristics of their monumental buildings. This evidence indicates that, despite the unequivocal presence of population growth, there is no proof that this process was necessarily accompanied by political centralization. 
The absence of large, densely populated set­tlements, the lack of a clear hierarchy within sites, and the presence of multiple similar monumental structures scattered uniformly across the land­scape allow us to propose the idea of a decentral­ized political organization in which each site or community maintained relative independence from the other. In both cases, this relative absence of a centralized system was affected by the arrival of new political structures in the valley. The Lima polity established direct political control over the low valley of the Lurfn River at the end of the Early Intermediate and early Middle Horizon. The rural elites of the valley were under the cul­tural influence of Lima before, but preserved their independence until the beginning of the Middle Horizon, when they came increasingly under di­rect influence of a multi-valley political organi­zation. Similar evidence of the advance of this Lima polity has been reported for other valleys in the central coast (i.e., Dillehay 1979; Guerrero and Palacios 1994; Kaulicke 2000). 
Similarly, the arrival of the Inka to the Lurin region transformed the lives of commoners and leaders at the late period sites, first through a strong cultural influence manifested in the early presence of Iuka-style ceramics, and later due to their direct political and economic control over the region (Feltham 1984; Lopez-Hurtado and Nesbitt 2010:2015). Of course, the opportunities and requirements imposed on the elites of Lote B by the growing Lima polity would have been different than the opportunities associated with the Inka presence. Finally, the overall relevance of these communities for the centralized political organization was likely also different. 
Lote B and a Lima Political Formation 
Based in the Rimac Valley 

From early on in Andean archaeology, scholars have proposed the existence of a state associated with the late period of the ceramic style known as Lima (Dillehay 1979; Earle 1972; Kaulicke 2000; Kroeber 1926, 1954; MacNeish et al. 1975; Patterson et al. 1982; Shady 1982; Stumer 1954; Willey 1943). These theories about the existence of a Lima state on the Central Coast are based on four lines of evidence: (1) a stylistic change in the local ceramic tradition that comes with the relative homogenization of ceramic production (Earle 1972; Patterson et al. 1982; Segura 2004); 
(2) 
the appearance of a new ceramic style (Niev­erfa) associated with pan-regional elite activities (Kaulicke 2000; Segura 2001; Shady 1982); (3) an apparent process of agricultural intensification (Agurto 1984; Shady 1982; Stumer 1954); and 

(4) 
a decrease in the size and number of monu­mental sites (Kaulicke 2000; Stumer 1954). The latter were located principally in the flat valley floors of the lower Chill6n and Rfmac valleys and composed by the agglutination of small do­mestic structures surrounding mud-brick public buildings. There are no clear hierarchies within this first tier of sites in the region, with the ex­ception of the apparently larger sites of Maranga and Cajamarquilla. The lack of clear differentia­tion among monumental sites has prevented the identification of clearly defined centers of cultural development and constitutes the source of the ongoing debate about the nature of political cen­tralization in the Lima culture. 


Although the issue is not always addressed directly, some researchers think that political cen­tralization in the central coast at this time may correspond to a scenario of competing small poli­ties sharing the same ceramic tradition (Earle 1972; Kaulicke 2000; Stumer 1954). Others prefer to discuss Lima political formations as a diarchy, with sites like Maranga or Pachacamac holding religious power and sites like Cajamarquilla ful­filling a more secular role (Agurto 1984; Eeck­hout 2003; Marcone 2010). A third group explains the site distribution from a temporal perspective. They propose that Maranga was the center of the tradition during the middle phases of Lima de­velopment. Later, during late Lima phases at the

start of the Middle Horizon, the nucleus of this culture moved to Cajamarquilla, in the middle valley. This settlement was linked to the rise of a new elite, agricultural intensification, and political centralization (Agurto 1984; Guerrero and Pala­cios 1994; Kaulicke 2000; Segura 2001; Stumer 1954). 
Beyond the questions of whether this late po­litical development of the Lima culture corresponds to the formation of a state-level polity or not, and whether this polity was ruled by one or multiple sites, it is evident that the Peruvian central coast went through important political transformations between the end of the Early Intermediate and the start of the Middle Horizon. It has been assumed that underlying these political developments was an increase in population and agriculture that gave rise to a process of political centralization (e.g., Kaulicke 2000; Marcone 2011; Stumer 1954). Other researchers explain these developments as no more than a byproduct of Wari imperial expan­sion and hegemony (e.g., Makowski 2002:116; Menzel 1967; Patterson 1966). 
Even though Lima-style cultural materials ex­isted in the Lurfn Valley before the emergence of a centralized political entity, the start of the Mid­dle Horizon period coincided with an increase of Lima ceramics in the valley (Patterson et al. 1982). These appeared to be more similar to Rf­mac materials than in preceding periods (Earle 1972; Lavallee 1966). Lima-style monumental architecture in the Lurfn Valley also became more frequent in this late period, both at Pachacamac and in the valley (Marcone 2011). This evidence was used to propose the Lurfn Valley as the pe­ripheral southern border of the Lima culture, which was consolidated into the Lima cultural hinterland during the late Lima phases (Earle 1972; Marcone 2010; Patterson et al 1982). The role that Pachacamac played in this regional sce­nario is still unclear and contentious, but our ex­cavations at the site have shown an increase in late Lima-period occupation (Marcone 2011). This growth at Pachacamac, which included the construction of several secondary buildings in previously empty areas, coincided with an ex­pansion of the Old Temple, the main temple in the site at this time, and an increase in late Lima ceramics. It is difficult, therefore, to support the idea of Pachacamac fulfilling the functions of a regional political center; rather, the site was ex­posed to the same process of centralization evi­dent in the Lurfn Valley and the region in general. An alternative view of the Lima presence in the Lurfn Valley proposes that the advance of the Lima culture happened early in the sequence and that the valley was well incorporated into a Lima political system from earlier in the Early Inter­mediate. In this view, the processes identified by Patterson and Earle are not the result of the rise of a Lima state, but rather a consequence of Wari influence in the region (Makowski 2002). Re­search at Lote B partially supports both of these hypotheses, but not completely. 
The Rural Elites at Late B 
The Lote B site is situated in the lower valley of the Lurfn River, 14 kilometers from the coast, covering the summit and high slopes of a hill lo­cated at the mouth of the Manchay quebrada, which connects the Lurfn Valley with the Rfmac Valley. Based on its morphological characteristics, the site of Lote B has been divided into four sec­tors (Figure 2). Sectors 1 and 2, located at the summit, likely formed a single hilltop compound. Slightly downslope, Sector 3 is composed of two buildings built as a combination of small rooms and open spaces or plazas over two successive terraces. Our excavations in the bigger of these buildings showed that its walls were covered with a coat of plaster painted bright yellow, which is a common decoration for Lima public buildings in the Rfmac valley (Flores 2005). Further down­slope, in a small artificially leveled area, Sector 4 is dominated by a semi-rectangular building with restricted access and small internal subdivi­sions, interpreted as a storage facility. 
Our excavations show a long occupational se­quence at the site composed of three main phases (Table 1). The earliest, present only in Sectors 1 and 2, was poorly represented in our excavations, where middle Lima ceramics and local wares were found at the bottom of the units. A second phase seems to have been restricted mostly to the hilltop compound (Sectors 1 and 2), with only scattered evidence in Sectors 3 and 4. The ceramics associ­ated with this middle phase were also local wares and middle Lima-style materials (Figure 3). Fi­nally, the last phase was identified throughout the site and was associated mainly with late Lima ce-

ramies. Although the phases of the Lima ceramic style are not entirely consistent with our stratig­raphy, the two generally tend to correlate. 
Our excavations make clear that Lote B was not a village , as initially proposed by Patterson et al. (1982), but rather a hilltop elite residential complex. Lote B, identified as Site 149 on Pat­terson's map, was not fortified-at least not formally-but would have had a clear defensive advantage. At the top of the hill, our excavations identified a residential area and adjacent open spaces with storage structures and abundant evi­dence of feasting activities. The area contrasts markedly with Sectors 3 and 4, with more modest architecture and smaller deposits of archaeologi­cal materials (especially ceramics) than Sectors 1 and 2 (Figure 4; Table 2). 
Despite being residential in nature , Sectors 1 and 2 display a high proportion of decorated ce­ramics, similar to the amount of decorated pottery from public areas of the site in Sectors 3 and 4 (Figure 4). This high percentage of decorated ce­ramics ( 12 percent in Sector 1, 13 percent in Sec­tor 2, 8 percent in Sector 3, and 16 percent in

Sector 4), together with the presence of storage structures, stone architecture , and evidence of feasting activities, suggests that the group that settled this compound occupied a relatively priv­ileged position. The large quantity of decorated ceramics at the hilltop contrasts with the dispersed commoner settlements close to the agricultural fields. Patterson identified five small sites (Sites 151-155) with some evidence of stone architec­ture, grinding stones, and a few mostly plain ce­ramic sherds. In both Sites 15 3 and 151, the field notes record a few Lima-style ceramic fragments used to assign a temporal position to these sites (Patterson 1966; Patterson et al. 1982). 
Apart from the ceramics, the materials recov­ered from the hilltop are unremarkable. They in­clude a few objects of personal adornment and food items, giving the impression that the inhabi­tants of this compound were not wealthy. Follow­ing this evidence, we propose that the inhabitants of Sectors 1 and 2 based their privileged position on the use and display of fine Lima ceramics, which are highly similar to the ceramics found in first-tier sites of the Rfmac and Chill6n valleys.
