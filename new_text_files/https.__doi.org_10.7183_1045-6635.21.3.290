"OLMEC" HEAD SHAPES AMONG THE PRECLASSIC PERIOD MAYA 
AND CULTURAL MEANINGS 
Vera Tiesler 
This paper analyzes the biographical and related archaeological information of JO artificially shaped skulls from the broader Maya area, which bear resemblance to the high and narrow head morphology depicted in Olmec art. The skeletal evidence of this head form, which was accomplished by combining compression cradleboards with constricting horiwntal wraps (tabular erect type in its pseudo-circular variety), is rare and predates A.D. 250 in all cases. Here I compare the cra­nial vaults shaped in this fashion with that of 49 other Preclassic period Maya indivisuals from different parts of the Maya world. The discussion explores the possible evolving social and religious roles of this emblematic body modification. I argue that Olmecoid head modification was a syncretic cultural adoption, since it was just one of many expressions of a deeply embedded Preclassic tradition, still practiced centuries after the demise of Olman 's societies themselves. The visible effect of the artificial pear-shaped heads most likely reflected gradual shifting ideological schemes, probably emulating early ver­sions of the Maya Maize God, given the resemblance to Preclassic period renderings of this supernatural force.

forms that resemble Olmec portraiture during the Preclassic period. 
Head Modeling in Ancient Maya Society 
Among the ancient Maya-and in fact much of Mesoamerica--cranial vault modification consti­tutes a widely spread and deeply rooted tradition that was practiced at all levels of society over a span of several millenia (Romano 1974; Stewart 1975:208-224; Tiesler 1998, 1999a, 1999b).1 This popular custom, which was carried out through massages, cradleboards, head compression devices, and constricting bands, led to astoundingly het­erogeneous visual results. Already seventy years ago, Earnest Hooton noted on the skulls retrieved by Edward H. Thompson from the Sacred Cenote of Chic hen Itza that "the varieties of cranial defor­mation are so numerous that they are bewildering" 
(Hooton 1940:273 ). This appraisal has been echoed by more recent Maya scholarship, at least for the Classic period (Stewart 1975:222; Tiesler 1998, 1999a; Tiesler and Romano 2008). 
If we believe the archaeological record, infant head modeling was practiced in the broader Maya territory at least by 1000 B.C. The earliest cases of lambdoid flattening and tabular oblique shaping, documented in Altar de Sacrificios, Guatemala (Xe Phase) and in Cuello, Belize (Swasey/Bladen phase), date to the late Early and early Middle Pre­classic period (Saul 1972: 107; Saul and Saul 1991:153-155). A millennium later, artificial skull shaping had already turned into an almost gener­alized practice with the majority of Classic period vaults (85.42 percent, N = 295) showing signs of cultural modification (Tiesler 1999a:223 ). 2 To pro­duce these deformations, the ancient Maya used cradleboards, cephalic apparatuses, and related implements, sometimes combined with compres­sion bands, massages, and-albeit rarely-also the abrasion of the occipal bone. 3 
Regarding the possible social motives behind this body tradition with its highly visible results, there is to date no conclusive evidence in the archae­ological record that might suggest that the artifi­cial head forms adhere to status or gender distinctions (see Tiesler 1998: 185-188; Tiesler 1999a:220--235; Tiesler and Benedict 2001 for sta­tistical examination on a regional level). Neither have other ideological or ethnic motives been con-elusively identified that could account for the var­ied choices of head shapes during the Classic period 
(A.D. 250--900), a time that witnessed a peak in the diversity of splinting and wrapping techniques and their combinations. I have argued in previous works (Tiesler 1999a:327-330; Tiesler 2005; Tiesler 2009a) that this diversity, which shows up both within and between settlements and among regions, could have been the outcome of family or com­munity traditions, passed on by generations of female practitioners. Apart from diversity, we can notice broad regional preferences for distinct head forms. Slanted heads seem more popular in the western sphere of the Maya Lowlands and along the coastal fringes, while erect head forms were in vogue in the Guatemaltecan Highlands and parts of the Lower and Middle Usumacinta region, namely in Palenque. Nevertheless, at least before the onset the second millennium A.D., these pref­erences have to be interpreted only as ratios of cradleboard vs. splinting traditions, not in terms of homogeneity vs. heterogeneity.4 
Similar to the Classic period traditions, uncer­tainty also marks our present understanding of the role held by cranial modifications during the Pre­classic period, although evidence is mounting that links some of the skull shapes of Preclassic east­ern Mesoamerica visually to the Olmec head iconography known from the Gulf Coast. The evi­dence goes back to Arturo Romano's seminal study on a skull from Pampa el Paj6n from the coastal plains of Chiapas, dated to the Middle Preclassic, which bears a striking resemblance to the pear­shaped head morphology of the anthropomorphic carvings from the Gulf Coast Olmec heartland 
(identified also as "Olman"), leading the author to speak of an "Olmec" cranial modification (Romano 1977 a, 1980: 114 ). Alterations of this type in Pre­classic period skulls from the Maltrata area in high­land Veracruz have been described (Carlos Serrano, personal communication 2001 ). Also in the broader Maya territory, this visual outcome of cranial vault manipulation must have been known on a regional scale, as my own research suggests. Over the years, I have documented nine skulls with artificially pro­duced Olmecoid head shapes that date to the Pre­classic period and add to the specimen from Pampa el Paj6n described by Romano (see Tiesler 1998:192-195; Tiesler and Rodriguez 2009) (Fig­ure 1). The skeletal evidence comes from five

archaeological sites, two of them located in Low­land Guatemala, and the other three in the Mexi­can states of Chiapas and Yucatan. 
In the following, I will address the overall dis­tribution, prevalence, trends, and changing cultural implications of"Olmec" head shaping among Pre­classic Maya settlers. I provide case descriptions for individuals displaying Olmecoid head forms and compare them to other coeval vault shapes from the broader Maya area. Correlating the bur­ial information with chronological and spatial assignments, I provide a broad sketch of the evo­lution of this form of cranial modification in the Maya area until its apparent abandonment prior to A.D. 250. The discussion traces the origins and possible mythological significance of pear-shaped heads in the Olmec heartland. The potential role that this symbolically laden head form played dur­ing the centuries to come in the Maya area is con­fronted with different scenarios of late supra-regional Olmec and epi-Olmec interaction, aspiring to contribute to the present Olmec debate (see Pool 2007: 12-17; Stark2000). I go on to trace the evolving social and religious importance of pear-shaped vault modification within the Maya area itself. I explore the practice conceptually as an integral part of deeply embedded daily traditions, which is confronted with gradually shifting ide-

ologies, autochtonous customs vs. syncretic cul­tural adoption, and the possible emulations of supernatural entities. The interpretation builds on interdisciplinary data analysis and is inspired by biocultural schemes and cognitive approaches (see, for example, Houston et al. 2006; Lopez-Austin I 989; Tiesler 2007), which are combined to con­tribute fruitfully to the discussion of Maya socio­cultural and religious evolvement during the Preclassic period. 
Techniques and Taxonomic Criteria 
This study forms part of a larger, ongoing, project that aspires to provide a representative coverage of head shaping in the Maya area from the skeletal record and associated contextual and graphic doc­umentation. To this end a cohort of 1,918 relatively well-preserved skulls from 149 site collections from the circum-Maya area have been systemati­cal] y scrutinized for head shaping so far (see Ties Ier 1999a, 2009a). To evaluate the presence, degree, and type of cultural deformation in the skeletal record, I employ a range of detailed nonmetric cri­teria and combine them with metric parameters when possible. The shape, extent, severity, and anatomical relationship are described for each com­pression plane and constriction groove. General morphological attributes, which are relevant for scoring artificial modification, were also included: basic vault measurements, foraminal clivus, anatomical location of vertex, distance of opis­tocranium from lambda and opistion, bilateral bulging vs. reduction of bilateral width, the degree and side of vault asymmetries (bipolar plagiocra­nia), and the presence, form, and severity of supra­inial lesions. 
The present classification of artificially modified head shapes is based on a taxonomy established orig­inally by Jose Imbelloni (1938; Dembo and Imbel­loni 1938) and adjusted to Mesoamerican modification practices by Romano (1965), and Tiesler ( 1998, 1999a). This system, which is in com­mon use now to characterize Mesoamerican artifi­cially modified head shapes, categorically distinguishes between tabular forms, attributed to the application of hard compression instruments, and the annular type, brought about by constriction bands, single strings, bandaging, or tightly adjusted hats. While the fitting of free compression boards on the infant head usually leads to oblique tabular forms, cradleboards are associated with tabular erect shapes that lead to high and broad heads (Figure 2). The duration of compression forces and the amount of pressure determine the severity of the morphologi­cal changes. Besides intermediate and extreme mod­ifications, slight forms of anterior-posterior reduction describe either lambdic (tabular erect occipital plane), occipital (tabular oblique frontal curve), or frontal flattening (tabular erect frontal plane or tab­ular oblique occipital curve). In these slight modifi­cations, the opposing compression plane is much less visible and might not even be recognized (see Dembo andlmbelloni [1938] and Dingwall [1931] for ethno­graphic and ethnohistorical references; see also top row of Figure 2). Irregularities in the application of the compression devices, mostly cradleboards, can lead to severe cranial asymmetries, while pads, put underneath the compression boards, may lead to sin­uous skull contours. 
Headboards or cradles may be combined with constricting bands, which lead to sulci (i.e. shal­low depressions running lengthwise) on the vault's external surface. 5 The joint application of horizon­tal head wraps and rigid tablets cause "pseudo­circular" oblique tabular modifications, which lead to elongated, tubular vaults with slanted foreheads. Conversely, pseudo-circular tabular erect shapes (identified here with the Olmec form of artificial cranial modification), are attained by combining tight bandages with cradleboard compression. In this modeling procedure, the rigid planes lead to an upward movement of the vault, while the cir­cumferential pressure exerted by the horizontal headbandrestricts the skull's bilateral expansion in the upper temporal area and may lead to a visible division into an upper and a lower lobe and bulging of the lower half of the occiput (Romano 1980:96). The appearance of the narrow forehead that results from this process is either bulgy or vertical. The occipital chord tends to have a concave contour when viewed in profile and its upper part may show a back slant (see first skull profile of Figure 2's bot­tom row; see also Figure 3). The overall form of the cranium that is produced through this proce­dure may be described as pear-shaped or high and tubular, just like the pear-shaped head style depicted in Olmec imagery. In the following, I will refer to these skull shapes as "Olmecoid," "Olmec style," or "Olmec type."

Results: Olmec Head Shapes 
During the Preclassic Period 

In the following, I provide a brief site-by-site case description of the nine specimens with pseudo­circular tabularerect vault shapes, including a tran­scription of the first case reported more than thirty years ago by Arturo Romano ( 1977 a, 1980). Apart from relevant craniological information, sex, and age-at-death, burial context and chronology have been documented (see also Table 1). 
Pampa el Paj6n, Chiapas, Mexico (Burial l) 
Arturo Romano (1977 a, 1980) reports an artifi­cially shaped skull from Pampa el Paj6n, dated to the Encanto Phase (750/700-600 B.C.), which belongs to the only skeleton reported from this estuarine center on the pacific coastal plain of Chi­apas with ties to La Venta (Pailles 1987:93). The corpse had been buried faced-down in an extended position. No artifacts were found buried with the skeleton; nonetheless, its burial location in the upper portion of the large and central El Encanto Mound led the author to believe that the interred was a privileged adolescent male (see also Salas 
1980:93). 
The severe tabular erect modification displayed by the skull vault had been produced by combin­ing a cradling device with a horizontal wrap (Fig­ure 3). The prolonged immobilization within the

cradleboard during the compression period had caused greater pressure on the left anterior and right posterior portions of the vault and resulted in cra­nial asymmetry, a common side effect of head shap­ing in cradles. The constricting action of the cloth increased the upward growth of the compressed head, while effectively limiting its bilateral expan­sion. An almost horizontal groove was left by the circumferential constriction in the upper mastoid and asterion surfaces, which visibly separates the skull into an upper and a lower lobe (Romano 1980:96). 
Chiapa de Corza, Chiapas, Mexico (Burial 144, Burial 147, Burial 154) 
Not far from Pampa el Paj6n, on the fringes of the Grijalva river, lies Chiapa de Corzo. Its strategic location explains its importance within the Isth­mus/Maya intersection as early as the Middle Pre­classic period (Lowe and Agrinier 1960). The explorations led here by the New World Archaeo­logical Foundation between 1955 and 1965 uncov­ered some 168 burials, which were studied by the author at the INAH headquarters of physical anthro­polgy (Agrinier 1964; see Tiesler 1998:139-140, 1999a). Of the 32 skulls that were sufficiently well preserved for evaluation, some 24 date to the Pre­classic or Protoclassic period. Three of these, all from Structure SA, display Olmec type artificial

shaping: Burial 144 dates to the Late Preclassic Guanacaste phase (300-100 B.C.), while Burials 147 and 154 are related to the Protoclassic Istmo phase (A.D. 0-200). 
Burial 144 corresponds to a simple pit that con­tained the skeleton of a probably female adult, which was partly covered with red pigment. The individual had been buried together with travertine earflares and domestic vessels (Agrinier 1964:37). Her head had been shaped slightly with a cradle­board device. No bipolar bulging is evident, sug­gesting that the antero-posterior compression had been combined with bandages. Burial 147 con­tained the remains of a young woman interred with a spindle whorl made from a ceramic sherd (Agrinier 1964:40). Her posterior skull vault, mod­eled in a cradleboard, displays acute lambdoid flat­tening. Bulging of the lower occiput (xyphobasia) was noted. Both temporal regions show a narrow horizontal sulcus, suggesting that the hard model­ing device had been combined with a constricting headband. The circular wrap reduced the bilateral width of the cranium and also likely led to bone thinning above the occipital protuberance. Struc­ture 5a-13 was also used to rebury the bones of a young man together with remains of at least one child (Burial 154). The frontal bone of the male is severely flattened as is the posterior portion of the vault. No bilateral bulging is evident, indicating that the compression tablets were combined with a con­stricting band. 
Altar de Sacrificios, El Peten, Guatemala (Burial 13, Burial 124) 
This site from the Lower Pasion area served as a major trade center already during the Late Pre­classic period. Here, Harvard's Peabody Museum led explorations that recovered a wealth of well­documented burials (N = 136), which cover more than two millennia of continuous occupation (Smith 1972).7 Of the six individuals that predate 
A.D. 250, Burials 13 and 124, both of them sim­ple primary interments, stand out as showing the combined effects of cradleboard and headband use. Burial 13 dates vaguely pre-A.D. 150 (probably San Felix phase, possibly Late Plancha phase) (Smith 1972:245). The restored, narrow cranium of Burial 13 belongs to a mature male. It displays a slight flattening of the frontal bone and a straight posterior compression surface, together with baso­occipital bulging (xyphobasia) and vault asymme­try. In this case, the hard compression device exerted pressure on the skull along with both cir­cular and antero-posterior constricting bands. The vault modification of Burial 124, probably a young female, was dated to the late Middle Preclassic (San Felix phase: 600-300 B.C.) (Smith 1972:265-266). Its vault modification is similar to that of Burial 13. In this case the expression of the posterior compression plane also dominates the skull shape with a horizontal sulcus above the mas­toid area proving that circular wraps had been used. 
Seibal, El Pet en, Guatemala (Burial 11) 
Located about 60 km east of Altar de Sacrificios on the southern fringes of the Central Maya Low­lands, Seibal was explored by the Peabody Museum of Harvard University (Tourtellot 1990). During its early phases of occupation in the Middle Preclas­sic, there is evidence of interaction with Highland Guatemala and contact with the Olmec region (Tourtellot 1990:235-24 1 ). Burial 11 is the earli­est skeleton recovered from the site, dating to the Escoba Mamon phase (600-300 B.C.). The grave was occupied by a middle-aged male adult, whose incisors displayed Ik-shaped dental filing (reduc­tion of the lateral edges of both central incisors that simulates a 'T' in the upper dentition). No objects were found with the interred. His skull vault shows a tabular erect flattening in the frontal and in the lambdoid area. In this case, a wide, shallow con­striction groove is evident in the posterior portions of both parietal bones, dividing the cranium into an upper and a lower lobe (Figure 4). 
Dzibilchaltun, Yucatan, Mexico (Burial M-871A) 
This large site, which had already emerged as a cen­tral settlement by the Middle Preclassic period, was the subject of a comprehensive archaeological 
investigation by The Middle American Research Institute (MARI) (Andrews and Andrews 1980). The burial described from this research consists of a simple pit interment without an offering from El Mirador's Structure 605-7. Curiously, this speci­men was not included in an earlier study on this skeletal series by T. Dale Stewart (1975), who did provide an extensive description of the artificially modified head shapes of all other preserved indi­viduals from the MARI explorations. The restored and marked remains from the MARI work are now

housed at the INAH Center of Yucatan, where the author documented Burial M-87JA (Xculul phase: 50-250 B.C.) (Tiesler 1998). It corresponds to a robust middle-aged male, whose high, narrow skull displays strong lambdoid flattening and a wide groove left by a horizontal constricting headband (Figure 5). Its bilateral width had been noticeably reduced by the bandaging. 
Caucel, Yucatan, Mexico (Burial l/Str. 52, Burial 2/Str. 1094) 
Recently, the salvage excavations of Fernando Ro­bles and his INAH team at Caucel, which lies on the outskirts of Merida, have produced a skeletal series of more than 20 individuals (Monica Rodriguez, personal communication 2009). Their study has led to the discovery of two more speci­mens in the peninsula, which emulate the artificial head morphology expressed by Olmec figurines (Tiesler 2009b; Tiesler and Rodriguez 2009). The preliminary results from the work at Caucel indi­cate a large settlement with ties to the North Coast that saw its major occupation during the Middle Preclassic, although it continued to be inhabited until at least the Early Classic period (Robles and Ligorred 2008; see also Andrews and Robles 2008). 
The first specimen belonging to Burial l was recovered from Structure 52 of the site, together with Dzudzuquil Group ceramics, which ties this context to the Early Nabanche phase (800/700 B.C.-4001300 B.C.), making it the earliest skull shaped in Olmec fashion to have been documented in the Yucatec Peninsula. It belongs to a robust young or middle-aged adult male. The anterior compression plane visibly flattens the middle half ofthe frontal bone. The dorsal flattening, more pro­nounced than the anterior one (occipital plane vari­ant), produced a straight dorsal plane, which dominates the back of the head. As in earlier exam­ples, the hard compression device led to vault asym­metry. A horizontal groove is visible in dorsal view and accentuated by the unnaturally reduced bipo­lar width of the vault (Figure 6). No supra-inial lesion was observed. 
The second skull from Caucel comes from Bur­ial 2 of Structure 1094, the simple pit interment of a male adult, dated to Late Nabanche (400/300 B.C.-A.D. 250). In this case, the slight artificial erect modification led to the basal bulging of the lower portion of the occipital bone (xifobasia), while a wide and shallow horizontal sulcus was noted in the asterion areas. Again, the width of the vault appears unnaturally reduced by the circum­ferential constriction.

adheres roughly to the average of coeval contexts 
with non-Olmecoid head shapes of .67 (N = 36). 
The 10 individuals with Olmecoid vault modi­
fications belong to adolescent or adult individuals 
of both sexes. Males strongly outnumber females 
(70 percent vs. 30 percent; N = 10) in a proportion 
that is similar to the sexed non-Olmecoid cohort of 
the same time range (69.57 percent vs. 30.43 per­
cent; N = 46). This bias is also observed in many 
Classic skeletal series from the Maya area and could 
be the result of differentiated burial practices, which 
have given priority to male individuals in the cer­
emonial precincts and site cores (being the same 
locations that receive priority from archaeological 
excavation), as scholarship has argued (see Krejci 
and Culbert 1999: 104, for discussion). From the 
perspective of physical anthropology, other factors 
certainly may contribute to this bias (see also 
Wright 2006:30-34). Since bone mass, size, and 
density are important intrinsic factors in the sur­
vival of bone elements, gracile female skeletons are 
prone to be less preserved than those of taller, robust 
males (Galloway et al. 1997), which reduces the 
possibility of positively sexing the former. Gener­
ally speaking, the extremely deteriorated, frag­
mented human remains that characterize most 
archaeological Lowland skeletal series lack most 
primary diagnostic features in the iliac bones or the 
skull, which in the past has led scholarship to rely 
heavily on nonmetric general features such as 
degree of robusticity from long bones. Degree of 
robusticity, again, is easier to tie to males than to females. 

Geographically, the 10 Olmecoid skulls origi­nate from three distinct areas within the broader Maya area, although the limited number of speci­mens does not allow for generalizations (Figure 1 ). Three of them come from the northern part of the Yucatan peninsula (Dzibilchaltun and Caucel). Another three Olmecoid vaults issue from the Pasion area in the southern part of the Central Maya Lowlands (Seibal and Altar de Sacrificios), and four more were recorded for the western fringes of 
the Maya world, towards the Isthmus corridor (Pampa el Paj6n, Chiapa de Corzo). Revealingly, the 10 crania with Olmecoid vault shape constitute only one of several different vault forms that were in vogue before the onset of the Classic period. This diversity in skull shapes is also evident within the regions and even within the sites that perform Olmec type shaping. To explore this aspect further, I compared the nine skulls I scored myself that were modified in Olmec fashion to other Preclas­sic period specimens from the overall skeletal record (N=58). The 58 of the 59 skulls included in this investigation ( 46 of which could be sexed, see abovementioned sex distribution) come from 16 settlements in the larger Maya area (Figure 7a-c). Possible inter-observer errors were avoided, since all skeletons were analyzed by the author. 8 Intra­observer error was kept to a minimum by scoring most specimens twice and by multiple checks on data congruence following the taxonomic criteria 
already outlined. 
Two of three individuals from Kaminaljuyu, 
who have been ascribed to the (Middle or Late) Pre­
classic period, display slight irregular frontal flat­
tening,probably resulting from the use of tumplines 
at an early age. These cases were excluded from 
the cohort of artificially shaped crania along with 
the third skeleton from Kaminaljuyu, which dis­
played no signs of artificial vault modification. Col­
lectively, the artificially modified skull vaults from 
the Maya regional record make up 77 .59 percent (N = 45) of the Preclassic series. The other 13 cra­nia (including the three skulls from Kaminaljuyu) did not show any evidence of artificial head mod­eling. 
The Preclassic period skulls included in this 
study represent a fraction of larger site collections, 
which are mostly ascribed to the (Late) Classic period. Since most of the site samples did not 
include a sufficient number of scored specimens, a systematic site-by-site reconstruction of evolv­ing shaping preferences was deemed problematic. For the purposes of this investigation, I therefore provide only one broad outline of head shaping, as observed in Chiapa de Corzo, the largest collection with Preclassic period specimens available. In the earliest of its 23 scored Preclassic specimens there are five skulls that date to the Middle or Early Late Preclassic (Francesa Phase: 450-250 B.C.), three of which show artificial vault modification ( 60 per-

cent). In each case, the head modeling was pro­duced by splints combined with compression wraps (tabular oblique type). Moving toward the Proto­classic period (Guanacaste and Istmo Phases: 300 B.C.-A.D. 200, 15 out of 18 skulls demonstrate artificial shaping (83.33 percent), suggesting a rise in popularity of this practice. In this period, hard compression devices are still almost always com­bined with constricting headbands, while formal and technical diversity is enhanced with the intro­duction of cradleboards (with three tabular erect types vs. nine tabular oblique types). In all three cases, the cradleboards were combined with head wraps that led to pear-shaped head forms, as described above. In any case, either erect or slanted, all heads from the first two centuries A.O. still appear narrow and unnaturally high in Chiapa de Corzo. A change in head form is noted only later, during the Early and Late Classic periods when the cephalic compression devices, commonly used before, appear to have been completely replaced by cradleboards and the circular headbands replaced by saggital bands. These technical inno­vations led to dramatic changes in head form: the population of Chiapa de Corzo begins to display shorter and unnaturally broad, protuberant heads. A saggital groove visibly separates the parietal lobes in some of the Classic period skulls from this site, still enhancing the impression of head width. When considered on a pan-Maya scale, the cran­
iological information reveals more general patterns in the artificial vault modifications.9 The skeletal record consulted for this study suggests that dur­ing the Preclassic and Protoclassic periods, artifi­cial skull forms were already produced by using either cradleboards or head apparatuses. Occa­sionally, the hard compression devices were used in combination with tight saggital or horizontal bands. When chronologically sequenced, the results show clear long-term trends in head forms, tech­niques, and shaping devices in the Maya region on the dawn of the Classic period. The shifting pro­portion between erect and oblique types toward the Classic period indicates that cradleboards were gradually replaced by splinting traditions. With the notable exception of Chiapa de Corzo, this change resulted in a growing proportion of reclined, slanted heads towards the Protoclassic and, more so, Early Classic period, as seen in Figure 8. 
Regarding the Olmec type skulls under study, these appear to have been most popular during the Middle Preclassic period (Figure 9). 10 That is when the effects of tight wrapping still show up in more than half of the artificially modified vaults. Further along the timeline, infants' heads continued to be wrapped with constraining headbands, but now wrapping practices had become increasingly tied to splinting traditions, producing the slanted, tubu­lar heads known from Classic period portraiture and the cranial record. Revealingly, before AD. 250 the
