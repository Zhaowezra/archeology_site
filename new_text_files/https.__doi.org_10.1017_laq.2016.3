IDENTIFYING DOMESTIC CERAMIC PRODUCTION IN THE MAYA 
LOWLANDS: A CASE STUDY FROM UXBENKA, BELIZE 

Jillian M. Jordan and Keith M. Prufer 
Utilitarian ceramic vessels form the bulk of artifact assemblages in the Maya Lowlands, but little is known about their production beyond the likelihood that they were made in a domestic context without elite involvement. Characterizing the production and distribution of these vessels is vital to understanding ancient Maya economic systems; nevertheless, this is a dif.cult task in the absence of primary production locales. We use spatial data, use-wear analyses on stone and ceramic tools, and analyses of .nished products to identify households involved in ceramic production at three settlement groups at Uxbenka, Belize, during the Late Classic Period (A.D. 600–800). Our analyses indicate that Uxbenka potters were likely involved in some level of residential specialization focused on speci.c vessel forms. These data, in conjunction with ceramic data from nearby Lubaantun and Nim Li Punit, suggest that all three polities were self-suf.cient in terms of utilitarian pottery production and primarily engaged in intrapolity distribution. We argue that this self-suf.ciency is due to widely available resources, smaller population sizes, and the availability of high quality agricultural lands. 
Las vasijas de cerámica utilitaria forman el grueso de los conjuntos de artefactos en las tierras bajas mayas. Sin embargo, se sabe poco acerca de su producción, más allá de la probabilidad de que se hayan manufacturado en contextos domésticos, sin la participación de la élite. La caracterización de la producción y distribución de estas vasijas es vital para entender los antiguos sistemas económicos mayas; sin embargo, esta es una tarea difícil en ausencia de los lugares de producción primaria. En este estudio se utilizan los datos espaciales, el análisis de uso-desgaste de las herramientas de piedra y cerámica y el análisis de los productos terminados para identi.car los lugares domésticos que participaron en la producción de cerámica en tres grupos de asentamientos durante el Período Clásico Tardío (600–800 d.C.) en Uxbenka, Belice. Los análisis indican que es probable que los alfareros de Uxbenka hayan participado en un cierto nivel de especialización residencial centrado en formas de vasijas especí.cas. Estos datos, junto con los datos de la cerámica procedente de los centros cercanos de Lubaantún y Nim Li Punit, sugieren que las tres entidades políticas fueron autosu.cientes en términos de la producción de cerámica utilitaria. Esta fue principalmente realizada para la distribución adentro del mismo asentamiento. Se argumenta que esta autosu.ciencia se debió a la amplia disponibilidad de recursos, los tamaños de población reducidos y la presencia de tierras agrícolas de alta calidad. 
U
nderstanding the production of utilitar­ian vessels is critical to our interpre­tation of ancient Maya economies and can aid in evaluating nonelite, hinterland social organization (Freter 2004; 
McAnany 1993a; 
Masson and Freidel 2002). 
Production 
locales, 
often identi.ed based on the presence of pri­mary .ring features, raw materials, production tools, products, and by-products (Stark 1985), 
are notoriously dif.cult to detect in the archaeo­logical record (Sullivan 1988). 
This 
is 
especially 
true in the Maya Lowlands because of multiple factors, including poor preservation, the ten­dency of archaeologists to focus on architectural remains, heavy vegetation obscuring activity areas, and the nature of domestic production itself. Utilitarian ceramic production is often seasonal and sporadic, with timing linked to both agricultural cycles and seasonality. This can result in relatively low volumes of .nished prod­ucts (Rice 1987).

Lowlands, have identi.ed ceramic production locales through systematic survey. In that region, the presence of at least two lines of evidence form the “gold standard” (Stark 2007:168) 
of 
investi­
gating ceramic production: primary production features (kilns, kiln furniture), high densities of ceramic wasters (mis.red or over.red sherds and vessels) or .nished products, and unusually high percentages of particular pottery types or form classes (Arnold 1991; 
Arnold 
et 
al. 
1993; 
Feinman and Nicholas 2007, 
2011; 
Pool 
2009; 
Santley et al. 1989;Stark 
2007; 
Stark 
and 
Garraty 
2004). 

The adoption of these same criteria for the Maya Lowlands is problematic in two ways. First, potters likely used open .ring methods. These are dif.cult to identify archaeologically, even if researchers focus their efforts on areas between house structures, where open .ring likely occurred. Such identi.cation has been dif.cult even in the arid American Southwest, where visibility and preservation are consider­ably better (Sullivan 1988). 
In 
the 
absence 
of 
kilns or open .ring features, it is unlikely that wasters (a major line of evidence elsewhere) would be found in any abundance. Second, although potters at some sites surely participated in larger-scale community specialization, not all utilitarian ceramics were produced in large quan­tities. It is likely that many household potters, particularly in smaller polities, produced ceram­ics solely for the household or for intrapolity exchange. Household production does not leave the same signatures as community specialization, if it leaves any trace at all in the archaeological record. 
Although locating primary .ring features would be ideal, the lack of these features should not preclude researchers from investigating utili­tarian pottery production. Nonetheless, it is nec­essary to rely on multiple lines of evidence given the ambiguities that can exist when determining the function of simple household tools of produc­tion. In this article, we discuss use-wear analysis on pottery production tools made of ceramic and stone material, analyses of .nished products, and the spatial organization of settlement groups as evidence for utilitarian production at Uxbenka during the Late Classic period (A.D. 600–800). We draw on ethnographic and ethnoarchaeolog­ical literature to identify patterns of domestic production and develop a model of evidence that should be visible in the archaeological record. The model is useful for researchers working across the Maya Lowlands and in other regions where remains of open .ring features are elu­sive. This case study highlights the variability in domestic production and the dif.culty in understanding the scale and intensity of domestic ceramic production in the Maya Lowlands. To contextualize our study, we provide a brief review of studies of ceramic production in the Maya Lowlands. We recognize that human behavior cannot be placed into discrete typological bins, although typologies can be useful for compari­son. In order to avoid reducing pottery production to a mode de.ned by the presence or absence of a series of traits, we use data to evaluate how domestic production .t into the overall economy of the Uxbenka polity and the southern Belize region (Hirth 2009). 
We 
argue 
that 
the 
medium-sized Maya polities of southern Belize were self-suf.cient in terms of ceramic production. Self-suf.ciency might have been supported by an abundance of natural resources (such as clay), a wealth of high-quality agricultural lands that did not necessitate intensi.cation of ceramic production to supplement household income, or lower population densities resulting in less demand (Arnold 1985). 

Ceramic Production in the Maya Lowlands 
Many studies of pottery production in the Maya Lowlands distinguish between polychrome ves­sels produced by elites and utilitarian vessels made by commoners. These traditions existed simultaneously during the Late Classic period and “their products circulated among different populations by means of different mechanisms at both local and larger regional levels” (Ball 1993:259). 
Scholars 
have 
invested 
considerable 
effort in understanding elite pottery production in the Maya Lowlands. Evidence suggests that specialists attached to and working within archi­tectural palace complexes decorated, and perhaps constructed, polychrome vessels (Ball 1993; 
Foias 2007;

palace production is generally limited to tools used to decorate vessels (Inomata 2001; 
Inomata 
and Triadan 2000). 
Nonetheless, 
examination 
of 
stylistic, epigraphic, chemical, and typological attributes provides indirect evidence of regional production, workshops, and individual artisans (Reents-Budet et al. 2000). 
The 
Maya 
used 
polychrome vessels for serving food and drink, to record historical events and ideological informa­tion, and for gift giving and tribute (Reents-Budet et al. 2000;Rice 
2009). 

Unlike elaborately decorated polychrome vessels, little is known about utilitarian ceramic production, distribution, and consumption in the Maya Lowlands (e.g., Lopez-Varela et al. 2001, 
2002; 
Pool 
2009;Rice 
2009;Stark 
1985). 
Late 
Classic elites consumed utilitarian vessels but likely did not participate in their production or distribution (Ball 1993). 
Ethnographic 
and 
archaeological evidence indicates that utilitarian pottery production among the Maya and in much of Mesoamerica took place at the household level, although not all households were producers (Arnold 1985; 
Deal 
1998; 
Feinman 
and 
Nicholas 
2007; 
Hayden 
and 
Cannon 
1984; 
Hirth 
2009; 
Reina and Hill 1978;Rice 
2009). 
Lowland 
Maya 
household production is often characterized as a decentralized, part-time, seasonal activity con­ducted in rural areas, where domestic craft production was a means to diversify household production and mitigate against risk (Hirth 2009: 
13–32). 
In the absence of known production areas, regional studies of consumption and distribution present one way to approach utilitarian ceramic production (Fry 1979, 
1980; 
Hammond 
et 
al. 
1976; 
Rands 
and 
Bishop 
1980). 
Such 
studies 
suggest community specialization at larger cen­ters, such as Palenque and Tikal, but “cannot rule out production by individual households or local part-time specialists” (Fry 1979:495). 
At 
Palenque, compositional and microscope data (instrumental neutron activation analysis [INAA] and petrography) identi.ed four primary paste groups that could be traced to four distinct geographic zones due to the heterogeneity of the landscape, which is fortuitous and anomalous in the Maya Lowlands. At Palenque, ceramic vessels were produced on a “community or zonal basis” (Rands and Bishop 1980:42). 
A 
similar 
pattern, based on fall-off curves, exists at Tikal, where there were three to .ve production zones in the periphery that were distributed up to 20 km from the site core (Fry 1979, 
2013; 
Straight 
2016). 
On 
the 
basis 
of 
high 
sherd 
densities 
of 
speci.c 
wares 
at 
Tikal, 
Becker 
(1973:400) 
also identi.ed a household that possibly par­ticipated in specialized production. At Copán, un.red clays, wasters, production tools, and high frequencies of ceramic sherds indicated the existence of seven production locales (four residential, three nonresidential single mounds) near clay sources (Freter 1996, 
2004). 
By 
con­
trast, at Lubaantun, located 13 km northeast of 
Uxbenka, 
Hammond 
and 
colleagues 
(1976) 
determined that utilitarian and polychrome ves­sels were produced locally using similar raw materials recovered from within 6 km of the site core. Based on INAA data, they determined that “Lubaantun was basically self-suf.cient in ceramics; domestic and ceremonial wares were all made on the spot, and a .ourishing school of potters and vase-painters existed there” (Ham­mond et al. 1976:167). 
Subsequent 
work 
on 
the 
Lubaantun assemblage supports this assertion (Fauvelle et al. 2012). 
Notably, 
compared to Palenque and Tikal, Lubaantun is a much smaller site, with a low population density; it is located in the southeastern periphery and lacked integra­tion into wider political and economic spheres (Daniels and Braswell 2014;West 
2002). 

Uxbenka and Southern Belize 
Uxbenka is a medium-sized polity located in the fertile foothills of the Maya Mountains near the modern Mopan Maya village of Santa Cruz in the Toledo District of southern Belize (Figure 
1). 
It 
is 
one 
of 
the 
earliest 
and 
longest 
occupied sites in what is today a peripheral and sparsely populated region of the Maya Lowlands (Prufer et al. 2011). 
The 
three other major centers in the region, Pusilha, Lubaantun, and Nim li Punit, also are located in hilly terrain between the Maya Mountains and the coastal plain. Uxbenka, Lubaantun, and Nim li Punit are located on highly fertile upland soils of the Toledo Beds, but Pusilha is located on lime­stone bedrock and is associated with the Moho River drainage.

indicate 
that 
Uxbenka 
was 
initially settled during the Late Preclassic (prior to A.D. 100) and its occupation extended into the Late/Terminal Classic period (ca. A.D. 800). Southern Belize reached its demographic peak during the Late Classic period, when all four major inland sites were occupied. Although the region is geographically isolated from other areas of the Maya Lowlands, inland and coastal sites exhibit evidence of trade and interaction with sites in the Petén, Guatemala, Highlands and the Belize Valley (Dunham et al. 1989; 
Hammond 
1975; 
McKillop 
2009; 
Prufer 
et 
al. 
2011). 

The Uxbenka Archaeological Project (UAP) began survey and excavation at Uxbenka in 2005. Excavation strategies focused primarily on building an absolute chronology to under­stand the founding and demise of the Uxbenka polity in relation to ecological variables and climate change (Culleton 2012;Pruferetal. 
2011). 
The 
site 
core 
is 
comprised 
of 
nine 
groups 
of monumental architecture located atop mod­i.ed hilltops. Masonry structures are limited to hilltops and are widely distributed across the landscape; this can be partially attributed to high rainfall levels (often greater than 4 m/year) that make low-lying areas unsuitable for habitation and subsistence milpa farming, which occurs on hillslopes (Prufer et al. 2015). 
Using 
a combination of pedestrian survey and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), the UAP has identi.ed 80 settlement groups of varying sizes and architectural complexity. These structures

are dispersed over approximately 30 km2 and extend as far as 3 km from the site core (Prufer et al. 2015). 
Like 
many 
other 
Lowland 
Maya 
centers, the Uxbenka settlement area is best described in terms of low-density agrarian-based urbanism with a center surrounded by a dispersed settlement, emphasizing the importance of farm­ing in these communities (Fletcher 2009, 
2012; 
McAnany 1993b; 
Robin 
2003). 

To date, 44 settlement groups have been excavated. Type-variety analyses of diagnostic sherds from excavated settlement groups indi­cate that nearly all (n = 37) exhibit evidence of Late Classic occupation. The most repre­sented ceramic groups are Remate Red, Puluacax Unslipped, and Turneffe Unslipped, with limited amounts of Belize Red, Zacatal Cream poly­chromes, and Hondo (see Supplemental Table 1). The Belize Red and Hondo Group ceramics are almost certainly imported, the .rst from western Belize and the second from Nim li Punit. Many of the Late Classic structures are ephemeral (less than 1 m high) and contain few diagnostic artifacts. Small sample sizes are due to the excavation of test pits focused on chronology building rather than the exposure of larger areas. Because settlements are located on hilltops, refuse was probably disposed of off hillsides. As a result, communal household mid­dens did not develop and, unfortunately, were not incorporated into construction .ll. On the posi­tive side, the discrete hilltop placement of each settlement group also increases the likelihood that artifacts recovered nearby were consumed— and even produced—at that location. Although not all of the materials discussed in this paper were recovered from primary contexts (e.g., middens, burials), the ceramic sherds and tools recovered from within settlement groups are probably re.ective of activities performed there. 
We identify households involved in ceramic production based on the presence of manufac­turing tools, the abundance of .nished products, and a focus on particular vessel forms within single 
settlement 
groups 
(Table 
1). 
The 
strongest 
evidence for Late Classic household ceramic production comes from Settlement Groups (SGs) 38, 52, and 54. All three SGs have ceramic and ground stone tools, have greater quantities of .nished products compared to other households, and evince production focused on a particular vessel form. SG 4, SG 36, and SG 62 also show evidence of Late Classic utilitarian ceramic production, although they do not present the full suite of features discussed above. There is evidence of Early Classic ceramic production at 
SG 
60 
(Figure 
2). 
Lastly, 
residents 
of 
SG 
37 
likely participated in the production of incense burners, perhaps as attached specialists. This settlement group is located close to the site core and elite residences, and it contains an unusually large quantity of specialized ceramic forms. 
Our discussion focuses on SG 36, SG 52, and SG 54 because these groups exhibit multiple lines of evidence for Late Classic utilitarian ceramic production. All three settlement groups

Figure 2. Uxbenka site core and location of SGs with evidence of ceramic production. (Map by A. E. Thompson.) 
are low to moderate status households (Types 1–3). Similar to settlement typologies at other Maya sites (Ashmore 1981), 
the 
settlement 
type 
designation at Uxbenka is based on the number, arrangement, and architectural elaboration of structures within a settlement group. Type 1 groups consist of a single structure, Type 2 groups consist of two to three structures with no formal arrangement, and Type 3 groups consist of four to seven structures formally arranged around a plaza. At a larger scale, Type 4 groups consist of seven to nine structures on raised platforms, and Type 5 groups consist of over 10 structures arranged around multiple plazas. The types represent status or functional differences between settlement groups. Artifact assemblages from SG 36, SG 52, and SG 54 are compa­rable and include locally produced ceramics, tools made from locally acquired chert, tabular sandstone abraders, granite grinding-stones, and obsidian blades. We hypothesize that settlement Types 1–3 at Uxbenka represent domestic res­idences of single family units of varying sizes (Figure 
3). 

Lack of Firing Features at Uxbenka 
We did not locate any primary .ring features associated with the .ring process. This is no surprise. At Uxbenka, as elsewhere in the Maya Lowlands, potters likely used the open .ring method. Results from a re.ring experiment show that locally produced Uxbenka ceramics were .red at a temperature of between 700 and 800°C, consistent with open .ring (Rice 1987:156). 
Because Uxbenka household groups are located on hilltops, the extent of the architecture and high winds on hills would have made .ring dif.cult. Ethnographic data indicate that most open .ring is done in the early morning to avoid high winds (Bryant and Brody 1986; 
Deal 
1998; 
Reina 
and 
Hill 
1978;Rice 
1987;

settlements, and perhaps on the leeward side of hills to reduce the effects of wind. Archaeologi­cal and ethnographic evidence indicates not all households were involved in craft production. In the absence of primary .ring locations, the co-occurrence of the tools used in ceramic pro­duction, higher frequencies of .nished products, and focus on a particular functional form are suggestive of individual (household) specializa­tion at Uxbenka. 
Tools of Manufacture 
To create a functional ceramic vessel, potters must collect and process raw materials and form, .nish, and .re the vessel (Rye 1981). 
Many 
of 
the 
tools used throughout the manufacturing process are made from perishable materials, and they can be dif.cult to identify in the archaeological record. Excavations at Uxbenka did not recover evidence of resource acquisition (e.g., lumps of un.red clays, tempers, or pigments). Nonethe­less, we did .nd an abundance of tools that are associated with .nishing treatments such as smoothing, burnishing, and polishing. Usually, this process involved hard tools, such as stone, shell, wood, or ceramic sherds, that are moved over the vessel surface (Rye 1981:89–90). 
The 
identi.cation of portable production tools can be problematic because recovery context does not necessarily equate to production context (Hayashida 1999;Stark 
1985) 
and 
household 
tools are often multipurpose implements. We use a combination of use-wear studies and the presence of multiple tool types within a single settlement group to identify households that engaged in pottery production at Uxbenka. 
Ceramic Tools 
Broken ceramic vessels are used for various purposes including household construction and ritual activities. They also are used in the

Jordan 
analyzed 
all 
non-diagnostic 
ceramic 
fragments collected by the UAP from site core and household contexts. Of the 44 settlement groups excavated at Uxbenka, ceramic sherd tools were found only at SG 38, SG 52, SG 54 (Late Classic), and SG 60 (Early Classic). All tools from Late Classic household contexts (n = 39) were analyzed as part of this study. Use-wear analysis followed the methodology established by 
Lopez-Varela 
et 
al. 
(2002) 
for 
sherd 
tools 
at 
K’axob based on experimental studies. We col­lected data on weight, width, length, thickness, and hardness (using a Mohs Hardness Scale) for each ceramic tool (Supplemental Table 2). Using a 40x VWR dissecting microscope, we also recorded directionality and intensity of use-wear on the concave and convex sides of the tool as well as the edges and tips. The average length 
(42.79 mm) and average width (30.97 mm) of the tools are commensurate with the K’axob data. Of the 39 tools analyzed, 13 exhibited no evidence of use-wear. These may have been prefabricated tools 
(Figure 
4i–j) 
or 
the 
sherds 
were 
too 
soft 
or porous (Mohs hardness of 3–4) to show use-wear. Most of the tools were made from Turneffe Unslipped and Remate Red ceramic groups, and the paste characteristics are consistent with .nished products found in the settlement groups at Uxbenka. Many of the expedient tools were used 
for 
more 
than 
one 
activity 
(Figure 
4f–h). 
A tool not identi.ed in the K’axob sample is a rounded type that likely functioned similar to 
a 
gourd 
scraper 
(Figure

and 
Hill 
1978:23).

likely came from the nearby Rio Blanco, and were transported to habitation areas for use in household activities. In pottery production, such stones are used for smoothing a vessel (when the clay is still wet) or polishing it (when the clay is at the leather-hard stage; Shepard 1980:66). 
Among tools associated with ceramic produc­tion, polishing stones have been documented across the Maya region (Deal 1998;Freter 
1996; 
Halperin and Foais 2010; 
Reina 
and 
Hill 
1978; 
Thompson 1958). 
They 
also 
can 
be 
used 
for 
activities unrelated to ceramic production, such as smoothing plaster, and caution is necessary in assigning pebbles to a potter’s toolkit (Geib and Callahan 1988). 
In 
this 
case, 
use-wear, 
pebble 
size, and association with other pottery pro­duction tools suggest that waterworn pebbles at Uxbenka were used for smoothing and polishing ceramic vessels. 
The material, weight, hardness, length, width, thickness, direction of wear, intensity of wear, and surface coverage were recorded for each stone tool (Supplemental Tables 3 and 4; Supple­mental Figure 1). All analyses were performed by the .rst author to eliminate the effects of intraobserver error. Two types of polishing stones were identi.ed for each household: rounded rectangular stones and rounded pebbles of vary­ing sizes. The rounded rectangular polishing stones 
(Figures 
6a, 
c, 
f) 
had 
an 
average 
length 
of 60.43 mm, average width of 23.67 mm, and average thickness of 16.05 mm. The most intense evidence of use is seen on the distal ends, with some parallel and oblique striations on the long sides. This type of use-wear on ground stone is consistent with ceramic production, particularly vessel smoothing. According to a Highland Maya potter, “only the ends of the stones were used for smoothing while the sides of the .at stones might be used to form the inside of a vessel rim” (Deal 1998:40–41). 
The 
smaller 
pebbles 
exhibit 
use-wear on all facets and were likely used for polishing 
(Figures

g–i;

and

ceramic production locations (e.g., Stark 2007). 
On their own, abundance data are problematic because they can be indicative of increased con­sumption or differential discard behavior rather than production. High sherd densities and con­centrations of particular vessel forms or wares are more reliable indicators of ceramic produc­tion (Stark and Garraty 2004:126). 
Analyses 
of 
sherds from across the Uxbenka settlement area indicate that households with production tools have higher densities of .nished products and an unusually high relative frequency of a particular vessel form type. To determine if households with production tools also had a greater abun­dance of .nished products, we considered the total number and weight of sherds relative to the volume of excavated material. This quantitative measure provides complementary estimates of the number of pots at each settlement group (Rice 2010:261–264). 
All 
settlement 
groups 
with 
pro­
duction tools produced an abundance of ceramics well 
above 
the 
mean 
(Table 
3). 
The 
only 
settle­
ment group with higher-than-average numbers of .nished products without evidence of ceramic production is SG 3, a Type 4 settlement group. It is possible that the high-status residents used greater quantities of vessels, but this hypothesis warrants further investigation. 
It is unlikely that the greater abundances of ceramic sherds at settlement groups with produc­tion tools are due to higher rates of consumption. Relative frequencies of vessel forms indicate higher quantities of particular vessel classes for SGs 38, 52, and 54. For each settlement group, diagnostic ceramics were classi.ed according to primary vessel form based on the classi.cation of vessel forms at Seibal (Sabloff 1975): 
serving 
vessels (bowl/dish), jars, unknown/other (e.g., appendage). Each sherd also was assigned to a ceramic group (de.ned in Hammond 1975) 
based on surface treatment. Both SG 38 and SG 54 focused on the production of jars. SG 38 likely produced unslipped (Turneffe ceramic group) jars while SG 54 produced red-slipped (Remate Red ceramic group) jars. SG 52 was involved in the production of Remate Red

serving 
wares 
(Figure 
7). 
It 
is 
unclear 
if 
each 
settlement group produced all vessel forms for their household, or if they specialized in a single form and traded for others. This issue will be addressed by future petrographic analyses on the Uxbenka assemblage. The data on vessel forms at each group are unlikely to be the result of different consumption practices because each settlement group was of a similar size and status. 
Spatial Distribution of Producing 
Households 

SGs 36, 52, and 54 are clustered in the south­west periphery of Uxbenka (see Figure 
2). 
The 
spatial arrangement of production households is instructive for three reasons. First, the loca­tion of these households on the periphery of the 
site 
is 
consistent 
with 
Fry’s 
(2013:76) 
pro­
posal that “production locations were dispersed in lower-density occupation areas at the edge of major sites,” possibly due to the proximity of resources (e.g., clays and tempers) or the pollution (smoke) associated with open .ring. Households with evidence of ceramic produc­tion at Copán, Honduras, were strategically located near clay sources (Freter 2004:99). 
The 
southwest periphery of the Uxbenka settlement area is situated on chik lu’um soils, which are “poorly-drained oxidized red soils” (Culleton 2012:95) 
with 
a 
very 
high 
clay 
content. 
This 
characterization of chik lu’um clays is consistent with macroscopic observations of ceramic paste properties. Future work will focus on geological sampling to determine if the clay sources near producing households were indeed used for pot­tery production. The nearby Rio Blanco, a major water source, also would have been useful to potters. Second, all potters at Uxbenka belong to lower-status households. In both Chanal and Aguacatenango, domestic potters were of lower to middle socioeconomic status (Deal 1998). 
According to Deal 
(1998:26), 
“for wealthier households there was no economic pressure on the women of the household to learn pottery making.” Third, the presence of an Early Classic potting household in the same spatial location as the Late Classic household suggests conti­nuity in locale and toolkit for this activity at Uxbenka. 
Household Modes of Production and 
Archaeological Correlates 

Most discussions of ceramic production in Mesoamerica use the classi.cation schemas pro­posed 
by 
Van 
der 
Leeuw 
(1977), 
Peacock 
(1982), Rice 
(1987), 
or Santley et al. 
(1989). 
These 
divide production into four (or more) main cat­egories based on the amount of time devoted to craft production (i.e., part-time vs. full-time) and whether production takes place within the household or in a designated, nonresidential workshop. These classes are useful but the distinction between household and workshop industries is not as relevant to utilitarian pottery production in the Maya Lowlands because no evidence of pottery production workshops has been found (Rice 2009). 
Therefore, 
we 
follow 
the 
classi.cation 
proposed 
by 
Costin 
(1991)asa 
means to frame our discussion. 
For our purposes, a specialist is a potter who produces more vessels than he or she consumes, regardless of intensity of production (Costin 2001;Rice 
1991). 
Since 
it 
is 
unlikely 
that 
utilitarian vessel production was sponsored by elites for their own use within the political econ­omy, the distinction between independent and attached production is not germane to this case (Costin 2001:276). 
We 
follow 
Hirth 
(2009:21) and use the term “intermittent crafting,” because the distinction between part-time and full-time activities does not accurately re.ect time alloca­tion of household activities in agrarian societies. Intermittent crafting means that potters produce vessels during only part of the year, dependent on weather conditions and time allocated to other household activities such as subsistence (Arnold 1985). 
The 
following 
is 
a 
review of household production, individual (household) specialization, and community specialization, the modes most relevant to Lowland Maya util­itarian ceramic production. It should be noted that 
McKillop 
(2002) 
documented 
evidence 
of 
nondomestic, specialized production of vessels for salt production at coastal sites in southern Belize. Clearly de.ning the boundaries of the modes of production and assigning archaeolog­ical data to them can be a dif.cult task because all three modes occur within residential contexts and ethnographic data indicate that consider­able variability can exist within each (Arnold

2008). 
Other 
types 
of 
specialization 
(e.g., 
work­
shops and attached specialization) are not described. 
Household production, also called domestic production, occurs when potters produce vessels solely for their own use or that of their house­hold. This mode of production is occasional, not in.uenced by market demand, and leaves few material traces (Rice 1987). 
Although 
this 
type of production undoubtedly occurred in the past, it is dif.cult to identify archaeologically because the ceramic assemblages of producing and nonproducing households are similar in com­position and density (Santley et al. 1989:108). 
Furthermore, household potters often use expe­dient, multipurpose tools, and any evidence of production is intermixed with residential debris (Arnold 1991). 

Individual (household) specialization occurs “when autonomous individuals or households produce for unrestricted local consumption” (Costin 1991:8). 
This 
type 
of 
specialization 
is 
most similar to the household industry cate­gory, in which consumers are often members of the potters’ communities (Rice 1987; 
Santley 
et al. 1989). 
Household 
specialization is still an intermittent activity, but more frequent than domestic production. Among the Tzetzal Maya, Deal 
(1998) 
distinguishes 
between 
part-time, 
elementary specialization and full-time, arti­san specialization. Both produced limited ves­sel forms, but elementary specialists produced vessels more frequently and for people outside the household. Differentiating these types of production based on the archaeological record may not be possible. Household specialization results in higher vessel frequency and more tools than household production; production debris is intermixed with residential debris but more visible in the archaeological record. This is the most common mode of production at Mataca­pan (Santley et al. 1989) 
and 
probably 
also 
at 
Lubaantun (Hammond et al. 1976), 
Colha, 
and 
Kichpanha (Iceland and Goldberg 1999), 
given 
that these sites were self-suf.cient in ceramic production and show evidence of limited distri­bution. Household specialization also may have occurred at Copán (Freter 1996) 
and 
in 
some 
households at Caracol (Chase and Chase 2014). 

Community specialization occurs when “an autonomous individual or house-based produc­tion units, aggregated within a single community, produce for unrestricted regional consumption” (Costin 1991:8). 
Community 
specialization 
is 
common among contemporary Mesoamerican potters (Deal 1998; 
Reina 
and 
Hill 
1978), 
and 
it was probably at least one of the modes of pro­duction at Tikal and Palenque. Ethnographic and archaeological evidence suggest that community specialists often focus their production on a par­ticular vessel form. Homogeneity in paste groups for a particular vessel form is further evidence of this mode of production. Some researchers have suggested that community specialization may occur when a site is close to a high-quality raw material source, as has been documented among lithic producers at the site of Colha (Shafer and Hester 1991). 
Community 
specialization 
may also arise in response to growing population and a greater demand for utilitarian vessels. 
Ethnographic documentation indicates that the intensity and scale of domestic production is based on the economic needs of community residents. Household specialization is most com­mon among potters in Mesoamerica, although production solely for household consumption and community specialization for regional con­sumption are also present (Arnold 1985; 
Arnold 
1991; 
Deal 
1998; 
Reina 
and 
Hill 
1978;Stark 
1985). 
Due 
to 
the 
abundance 
and 
availability 
of natural resources used for producing pottery in the Maya Lowlands, ceramic production was possible at every ancient Maya site (Foias and Bishop 2007;Freter 
1996, 
2004; 
Hammond 
et 
al. 
1976;Howie 
2012; 
Iceland 
and 
Goldberg 
1999). 
Although each polity could have been self-suf.cient, community specialization did occur (Fry 1979; 
Rands 
and 
Bishop 
1980; 
Scarborough 
and Valdez 2003; 
Schafer 
and 
Hester 
1991). 
Like 
ceramic production in modern villages across Mesoamerica, modes of domestic production among the ancient Maya probably varied spa­tially and temporally and may have even occurred simultaneously, particularly at larger sites. 
Discussion 
Archaeological interpretations of the organiza­tion of pottery production often rely on less-than-ideal datasets, particularly in the Maya Lowlands (Rice 1987). 
In 
the 
absence 
of 
pri­
mary .ring features, archaeologists must rely on

tools and .nished products to make inferences about the organization of craft production. At Uxbenka, households participating in ceramic production were clustered near one another, used a similar repertoire of production tools, and focused production on a particular vessel class. The location of production households may have been determined by the presence of natural resources (e.g., clays or water) or the pollution of the open .ring process. The clustering of production households and shared production toolkits could also be indicative of workgroups (Deal 1998). 
The 
current 
data 
indi­
cate that three (and potentially eight) households were involved in utilitarian pottery production. Nonetheless, the absence of evidence in other settlement groups at Uxbenka does not neces­sarily indicate absence of production, due to the often ephemeral nature of domestic ceramic production. 
In studies of residential production, it is important “not to con.ate scale and intensity” (Feinman 1999:85) 
when 
assessing 
production 
organization. The intensity of production refers to the amount of time potters spend on their craft. The scale of production is characterized by the size and composition of the production unit (Costin 1991). 
More 
recent 
discussions 
of 
production stress the importance of decoupling these two aspects of scale (Arnold 2015:4–5; 
Costin 2001). 
We 
have no way of knowing how many potters participated in production at Uxbenka; nonetheless, given that production occurred within the household we can infer that the production units were composed of kin-based groups consistent with ethnographic reports from across Mesoamerica. Residents of lower-status households, such as those at Uxbenka, tend to learn craft production within the family context, while higher-status households interact with a broader range of personnel (Hayden and Cannon 1984). 

Following 
Hirth’s 
(2009) 
characterization 
of 
household craft production, potters at Uxbenka were intermittent crafters who also farmed the surrounding landscape. There is no evidence of signi.cant multi-crafting, and the high-quality agricultural land surrounding Uxbenka (Culleton 2012) 
suggests 
that 
pottery 
production 
was 
not 
a risk-management strategy to subsidize house­hold subsistence (Hirth 2009). 
Given 
that 
it 
is 
impossible to reconstruct time allocation in the past, it is perhaps more useful to consider craft production in terms of product specialization rather than economic specialization. According to 
Rice 
(2010:357), 
this 
approach 
“distinguishes 
specialists, or individuals having an occupational (or task, or process) specialty or special skill, from the existence of economic specialization in the context of the ‘self-sustenance’ of a domestic unit (group or community).” Taken together, the data indicate that at Uxbenka during the Late Classic period, some level of residential-based product specialization took place in which the producing household focused on particular functional classes. 
The data we have presented, together with information on ceramics from other polities, allow us to better understand the regional economy of southern Belize during the Late Classic. 
Leventhal 
(1992) 
proposed 
the 
exis­tence of a southern Belize tradition based on the absence of vaulted architecture and lim­ited masonry superstructures, the use of natu­ral topography in construction (modi.ed hills), ballcourts enclosed by walls, numerous carved monuments, and inconsistent lunar series content on carved monuments. More recent evaluations, based primarily on epigraphic evidence, indicate that the four major centers in southern Belize were largely independent (Braswell and Prufer 2009:52). 
Pusilha, 
Uxbenka, 
and 
Nim 
li 
Punit 
all have emblem glyphs suggesting some level of political independence; inscriptions on over 60 carved monuments never mention the other polities in the region (Braswell and Prufer 2009). 
The epigraphy is instructive but only provides insight on elite interactions. Given that all four major polities in southern Belize are located less than 47 km from one another, it is pos­sible that nonelite residents of these polities interacted with one another independent of their elite rulers, either through direct interaction or marketplace exchange (Masson and Freidel 2012). 

The pottery of Pusilha is signi.cantly dif­ferent stylistically and technologically from the other major centers, suggesting interaction with sites outside of southern Belize, most likely the southwestern Petén (Bill and Braswell 2005).

As a result, Pusilha is not considered in our discussion of regional production and distri­bution. Uxbenka, Nim li Punit, and Lubaan­tun share the same ceramic groups originally identi.ed 
by 
Hammond 
(1975), 
although 
differ­
ences exist in abundance of types, vessel form, and technology (Fauvelle et al. 2012:Figure 
6; Hammond 1975; 
Jordan 
and 
Prufer 
2014). 
For 
example, Hondo group ceramic materials that were likely produced at Nim li Punit (based on abundance) are virtually absent at Lubaantun and Uxbenka, while sherds of the coarse-tempered Puluacax group—a southern Belize tradition— are abundant at Uxbenka and Lubaantun but less common at Nim li Punit (Supplemental Table 1). Turneffe Unslipped jars, the most abundant ceramic and form group, display different forms in different polities. The most abundant jar form at Lubaantun is the vertical-neck jar, a form rarely found at Uxbenka, where jars have little or no neck. The majority of sherds at Lubaantun are tempered with limestone (60 percent), while very few sherds at Nim li Punit (6 percent) contain limestone (Fauvelle et al. 2012:56). 
The 
ceramic pastes at Lubaantun and Uxbenka are most similar, although Uxbenka sherds are also tempered with crystalline calcite; the different vessel forms suggest to us that different social units were involved in their production. INAA analysis of Lubaantun ceramic materials indi­cate utilitarian and polychrome vessels were produced using similar raw materials recovered within 6 km of the site core (Hammond et al. 1976). 

If potters residing in southern Belizean Maya sites participated in community specialization, the .nished products should be widespread across southern Belize, re.ecting unrestricted regional distribution of goods. The exact oppo­site appears to be the case, indicative of house­hold specialization and intrapolity distribution of .nished products. The general lack of economic

interaction between Lubaantun and Nim li Punit is further supported by differential access to and proportions of obsidian at the two sites (Daniels and Braswell 2014). 
Nonetheless, 
some 
exchange certainly existed, as evidenced by the small number of Hondo group ceramic sherds from Nim li Punit that are found at Uxbenka and Lubaantun. Further, ceramic vessels and salt were likely traded between inland and coastal sites (McKillop 2002). 
Nevertheless, 
the 
data 
suggest that a vibrant, intraregional market sys­tem, in which ceramic vessels were exchanged on a regular basis in large quantities, did not exist in Late Classic southern Belize. At the same time, mechanisms were in place for the acquisition of nonlocal items, as evidenced by the presence of obsidian and granite in the assemblages of all three polities (Nazaroff and Prufer 2011). 
There 
is 
not 
enough 
evidence 
to 
characterize the organization of production at Lubaantun and Nim li Punit, although indica­tions exist that they were also self-suf.cient in terms of domestic pottery production. Our work at Uxbenka supports Hammond et al.’s (1976:166–167) 
assertion 
that 
both 
polychrome 
and utilitarian vessels were produced locally using similar raw material sources. All available data indicate that the polities of southern Belize had independent domestic economies during the Late Classic period despite their proximity to one another and relative isolation from other polities. 
We used ethnographic data from Mesoamer­ica to contextualize this discussion and provide some explanation for the patterns of ceramic production and consumption observed in Late Classic southern Belize. Self-suf.ciency and household specialization are potentially related to three factors: widely available natural resources, high-quality agricultural lands, and small population sizes. Each major polity used different clays and tempers, presumably located within close proximity (Arnold 1985). 
Pottery 
is 
no longer commonly produced in southern Belize today, but in the 1920s villages produced their own pottery using locally available materials (Thompson 1930). 
This 
tradition 
continued 
until 
at least the 1960s (Hughes-Hallett 1972, 
1974). 
Ancient Maya potters accessed the same lands as groups today and would not have had to travel far for clays and tempers. In Highland Guatemala, community specialization is often linked to a lack of high-quality agricultural lands. Ceramic production is a means for potters to supplement household income and trade for comestibles. Uxbenka, Lubaantun, and Nim li Punit are all located on well-drained, high-relief features on the Toledo Bed, composed of interbedded sand­stones and mudstones (Culleton 2012; 
Prufer 
et al. 2015). 
The 
geology 
of 
this 
region, 
combined 
with high annual rainfall rates, makes southern Belize an extremely fertile region of the Maya Lowlands. Today, nearly every household in

Santa Cruz village participates in subsistence farming (Baines 2015). 
Community 
specializa­
tion and subsequent exchange with other polities as a risk management strategy may not have been necessary in regions with abundant and fertile farmland. The polities of southern Belize are much smaller than those where community specialization has been inferred from the archae­ological record (e.g., Tikal and Palenque) or doc­umented ethnographically (e.g., Amatenango). Hammond 
(1975) 
suggested 
that 
Lubaantun 
had 
no more than 3,000 inhabitants and probably many fewer. Uxbenka has been estimated to have a Late Classic population of 3,427 based on an estimate of 5.5 persons per household, which stands in stark contrast to polities such as Tikal with population estimates of 49,000 inhabitants (Haviland 1969:429). 
The 
conditions 
of 
self-suf.ciency and household specialization are the likely result of a combination of widespread suit­able clays for pottery production, an abundance of suitable agricultural land that did not require community specialization as a risk management strategy, and small population sizes that kept demand low. 
Conclusion 
The data from Uxbenka demonstrate the utility of investigating domestic pottery production in the absence of primary production locales. This has signi.cant implications for the study of household economic organization in low-density urban settings. It is necessary to use multiple lines of evidence, including spatial data, use-wear on production tools, and analysis of .n­ished products to identify households engaging in ceramic production. If archaeologists can identify more than one household participating in ceramic production, then some inference can be made about the organization of production. This case study highlights the importance of considering craft production within the social, political, and environmental context of the potter (Costin 1991). 
Utilitarian 
vessel 
production 
in 
southern Belize occurred somewhere on a contin­uum between household production and house­hold specialization. Although the evidence from Uxbenka cannot be directly applied to Lubaantun or Nim li Punit, it is unlikely that community specialization existed in southern Belize during the Late Classic period. The lack of larger-scale community specialization could be due to the widespread availability of high-quality clays and tempers, low population densities resulting in less demand, or very productive agricultural lands that did not require residents to turn to craft production to subsidize the household.
