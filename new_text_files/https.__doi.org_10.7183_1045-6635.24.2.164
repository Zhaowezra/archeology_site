WATER, RITUAL, AND POWER IN THE INCA EMPIRE 
Tamara L. Bray 
Archaeological, ethnohistoric, and ethnographic evidence provides ample indication that water was a key symbol inAndean thought. During the late precolumbian era, the attention lavished on waterworks and features by the Inca emphasizes a clear concern with control over water and its movement. This paper examines the way in which specific relations of power and identity were constructed through Inca management of water. To this end, I offer a comparative analysis of water-related features from different sectors of the Empire, representing different 
moments in its historical development. The intent is to further our understanding of how the manipulation of water figured in the imperializing process and how its use and mean­ing may have evolved over time. The architectural evidence from the sites included in the study suggests that conspicuous exercise of control over the movement and flow of water may have been more critical to the establishment of Inca hegem­ony than to its subsequent maintenance.

ater is one of the fundamentals of human existence. As a substance liter­ally essential to all living organisms, 
water is both embodied and extracorporeal-a con­
nective element that links living things to the cos­mos via the cyclical processes of respiration, transp'1rat10n,and prec'1p'1tat10n. lJ1ven 'its

As demonstrated ethno­graphicall y and historically, it is a substance densely encoded with meaning (Illich 1986; Kamash 2008; Strang 2004; Worster 1985). Across a wide spectrum of cultures, water has frequently been tapped as a source of imagery and metaphor for communicating complex ideas about move­ment, transformation, and identity (Strang 2004). Given its unique properties of fluidity, trans­mutability, and reflectivity, the symbolic capacity of water for conveying different aspects of human experience is immense and arguably unrivaled.

engagement with and control over this vital element (Dean 20 11). This is evident in the attention lav­ished on the various types of waterworks and fea­tures found throughout Tawantinsuyu (see, e.g., Hyslop 1990: 129-145; MacLean 1987; Wright 2006; Wright and Valencia 2000). Such an invest­ment goes beyond economic and agricultural con­cerns. Rather, it is more readily understandable in light of the density of meaning surrounding water in the Andes, which carried connotations oforigins, identity, community, and connectedness (Sher­bondy 1982b, 1992). This paper will examine the way in which specific relations of power and iden­tity were constructed through Inca management and control of water. To this end, I offer a com­parative analysis of water-related features from dif­ferent sectors of the Empire that represent different moments in its historical development. Following the early leads of Sherbondy (1982a, 1982b) and Gose (1993), the intent is to further our under­standing of how the manipulation of water figured in the imperializingprocess, as well as how its use and meaning evolved with the needs of the state. 
Water-related features comprise a significant subset of imperial Inca architecture. Like the Romans, the Cuzqueiios displayed a clear enthusi­asm for waterworks and the physical management of water. Examples of such features as fountains, baths, and elaborate channels are prevalent in the imperial heartland, particularly in the Urubamba River valley. But they are also important elements of Inca sites in the provinces (Brown 1998; Hys­lop 1990). A comparison of the different types of hydraulic features found at sites in the heartland versus the provinces is presented here as a method of gauging whether the role of water may have changed from the earlier to later phases of imper­ial Inca rule. While various authors have suggested that water-related features were specifically asso­ciated with sacred sites (e.g., Carrion 2005 [ 1955] :32) or the "religious sectors" of larger sites (e.g.,Alcina 1976; Gibaja 1984, 2004; Kaulicke et al. 2003; Morris and Thompson 1985), the fact that the imperial Inca state was essentially a theocracy, with the Inca ruler claiming divine descent from the sun, must be borne in mind. For this reason, the analytic approach followed here rejects the pre­sumed "separation of church and state," focusing instead on how religion, ritual, and ideology informed Inca political practice, and vice versa. 
The ultimate goal is to determine whether changes in imperial ideology can be detected through the archaeological investigation of Inca hydraulic architecture. 
Water in Andean Ideology and Cosmology 
Andean people have venerated springs, lakes, and snow-capped peaks since ancient times (Carrion 2005 [1955]). Such features were understood as sacred places, the origin sites of specific lineages, and the dwelling places of protective deities. Many water-related landscape features were construed as paccariscca-a term relating to notions of"dawn," "birth," and "place of origin" -by corporate groups throughout the Andes (Gonzalez 2007 [1608]: 182; Maccormack 1991:97). Such locales were recog­nized as the places from which the founding ances­tors of each lineage had originally emerged (Arguedas 1956; Sherbondy 1982a:124). Their per­manent presence on the landscape represented a physical link between the descendant population and the territory they claimed (Albornoz 1967 [1585]:20; Arriaga 1968 [1621]:219-220). The ongoing relationships between the living and the dead that legitimized a community's land and water rights were regularly expressed through offering of gifts, sacrifices, and supplications made at these sites (Arriaga 1968 [1621); Cobo 1990 [1653)). 
The origin stories of Andean peoples and their paccariscca are intimately associated with Wira­cocha, the supreme deity in Andean cosmology and creator of humankind. The name of this being, which translates literally from Quechua as "fat or greasy" [wira] "lake" [cocha], references indige­nous concepts regarding body fat and water as orig­inary substances of life, energy, and power (Du viols 1977; Harrison 1989:94-95). Indeed, many of the actions and events associated with Wiracocha are close! y linked to water. Lake Titicaca, for instance, the most sacred body of water in the Andes, fig­ures prominently in Andean origin stories, as it is from this locale that Wiracocha purportedly ordered humanity into existence (Betanzos 1996 [1551-1557] :7-11; Sarmiento 2007 [1572): 49-55). The creator deity subsequently dispersed the human race by having them emerge from lakes and springs (as well as mountains and caves) throughout the Andes (Molina 1943 [157 1]:9; Sarmiento 2007 [1572):49-55). Once humans were

established on earth, he disappeared into the sea ­the trajectory of his journey from the Altiplano to the Pacific Ocean replicating the flow of water from above to below that connects the cosmos (Zuidema 1989:392). 
Many members of the Inca royal dynasty were also specifically associated with and remembered for their deeds relating to water. Manco Capac, the first Inca king, and his consort Mama Huaco are said to have usurped the waters and lands of the pre-Incaic inhabitants of the Cuzco Valley (Sarmiento 2007 [1572):71-73). SinchiRoca, their son and heir, purportedly drained the marshy cen­ter of the newly founded Cuzco in order to enable further construction in the emerging urban core (Cieza de Leon 1943 [1551):172). Several gener­ations later, the ruler Inca Roca is credited with the discovery of a new water source for Cuzco (Cieza de Leon 1943 [1551]:111; Sarmiento 2007 [1572]:88). Later rulers-like Pachacuti-are attributed with undertaking repairs of hydraulic works critical to the capital city (Betanzos 1996 [155 1-1557):55-56). 
Numerous water sources and features in the cir­cum-Cuzco region were recognized as sacred sites, or huacas, and incorporated into the complex arrangement known as the ceque system (Bauer 1998; Sherbondy 1982a; Zuidema 1964, 1977). The ceques linked local peoples and places in an intricate geospatial network that framed and ordered time, space, and social relations/obliga­tions in the Cuzco basin (Zuidema 1964, 1983). Interestingly, nearly one-third of the designated shrines on the ceque lines surrounding Cuzco (96/328) were water-related features such as springs, fountains, baths, and canals (Sherbondy 1982a:74). This indicates the considerable impor­tance of aqueous sources within the sacred geog­raphy of Cuzco-an imperial concern arguably inherited from the Wari (see Glowacki and Mal­pass 2003). 
The ceque system also had an important calen­drical function that was closely linked to the cere­monial cycle of the Inca state (Zuidema 1977, 1981, 1983). Many of the annual rituals performed by the Inca involved the movement and flow of water as an integral part of the ceremony. For instance, the most significant ceremony of the year in the Inca ritual calendar was the initiation of the children of the imperial elite into adulthood-a month-long affair that culminated with the bathing of initiates in a specific spring (Betanzos 1996 [1551-1557]: 59-64; Cobo 1990 [1653): 126--134). There were also a number of rituals in the ceremonial calendar corresponding to critical points in the natural hydro­logical cycle of the highlands and the timing and distribution of irrigation waters (Sherbondy 1982a: 103-120). These and other annual rites sug­gest that politics, water, and ritual were closely intertwined in the Inca state. 
Water and Organization 
Based on a detailed study of irrigation systems in the circum-Cuzco region, Sherbondy (I 982a) argued that hydraulic networks provided a funda­mental schema for the organization of territorial, social, and political units in the Andes. By con­ducting water from distant lakes and springs, irri­gation canals served to integrate the vertically distributed ecological zones and their human inhab­itants into a single economic system. Just as irri­gation canal systems physically unified a territory, so the human labor involved in their construction, use, and maintenance served to define the social group itself as a corporate body (Sherbondy 1982a:22-23). It was participation in the commu­nal labor parties and rituals associated with the upkeep of local irrigation chanuels that confirmed one's membership in the corporate body and ensured access to water for the coming agricultural cycle (Guillet 1992; Isbell 1978:138-144; Ossio 1978). In an apt metaphor, Sherbondy (1982a:23) noted that "[i]n a very real sense, the irrigation sys­tem of the ayllu function[ ed] as the backbone of the socio-political unit." 
Traditional rights to water and canal systems were based on assertions that these had been dis­tributed by the original lineage founders, who had themselves emerged from the paccariscca that materialized these claims on the landscape (Arguedas 1956; Sherbondy 1982a, 1982b, 1987). Gose (1993:492-495; also Duviols 1986) has argued that smaller scale features, such as springs and caves, functioned as the paccariscca of small local corporate units, while larger features such as lakes and snow-capped peaks (linked through water), could be claimed as the paccariscca of multiple groups at the regional level. This was pos­sible because within Andean cosmology, bodies of

water were hierarchically ordered by size and inter­
connected as component parts of a great hydraulic 
circulatory system (Earls and Silverblatt 1978; 
Sherbondy 1982b: 11). In this system, water-the 
connective substance of the universe -flowed 
(upward) from the largest sources through sub­
terranean channels to charge smaller ones, and 
then returned back (downward) via surface rivers 
and rain to the point of beginning in an unbroken 
cycle (Bastien 1978; Earls and Silverblatt 1978; 
Urton 1981). 
The cosmological notion of local water sources being physically linked to larger regional sources, which ultimately connect to the ocean (Mama­cocha) and Lake Titicaca-the two most signifi­cant bodies of water in the Andean cosmos ­provides a mechanism for conceptualizing social and political affiliation at different levels. This type of political structure is what Gose ( 1993:480) refers to as a "nested, segmentary hierarchy" in which phenomena of the same order grade into one another and can "nest" into units of a higher order or subdivide into smaller groupings. It also pro­vided an ideological basis for claiming that all social groups in the Andes ultimately shared a common origin by virtue of parallel ties to the originary sources of water-the maximal pac­cariscca of Lake Titicaca and Mamacocha. The use of such a hydro-centric model of the cosmos to express concepts of political unity beyond the ayllu likely has deep roots in Andean prehistory. Based 
on the archaeological and ethnographic evidence, it appears that Andean peoples not only possessed a sophisticated practical knowledge of hydrology linked to irrigation from very early on, but also co­evolved an elaborate cosmology centered on the circulation of fluids that served to express group identity and political unity on various levels. Within this model, water was understood as a unique and vital force conceptually associated with fertility, semen, blood, and ancestors (Arguedas 1964; Isbell 1978: 137-165; Ossio 1978). 
Given the density of meaning surrounding water in the Andes, it is little surprise that the con­trol of its movement and distribution would be a key concern for the Inca. Sherbondy (1982a) first developed the argument that the Inca consciously relied upon deep-seated beliefs about water, ori­gins, and cosmological order to further their own imperial ends. By manipulating water, the Inca 
could manipulate notions of identity, social order, and shared interests-in this way "naturalizing" an independent polity's incorporation into the imperial fold. The cultural connotations of water thus provided the Inca with a powerful ideologi­cal basis for subjecting and uniting Andean peo­ples under imperial rule. In a provocative treatise along these same lines, Gose (1993) took some of these notions and worked them into a complex metaphysical model of Andean agriculture involv­ing the binary oppositions of wet-dry, living-dead, inside-outside, and highlands-coast that he sug­gests underpinned imperial state formation. He concludes that "[u]nder the Incas, the administra­tion of water was probably more developed as rit­ual than it was at a purely utilitarian level" (Gose 1993:509). The analysis of Inca waterworks pre­sented below argues against the partitioning of rit­ual and utilitarian concerns insofar as these appear 
to have been mutually constitutive of one another in the context of the imperial Inca state.1 
The meanings and associations of water in the Andes outlined above form the conceptual frame­work for the comparative analysis of water-related features found at Inca sites dating to the earlier and later phases of the imperial project. The architec­tural evidence from these sites suggests that the conspicuous exercise of control over the move­ment and flow of water may have been more crit­ical to the establishment of Inca hegemony than to its subsequent maintenance. The architectural evi­dence also highlights in a material way the intimate nature of the association the Inca claimed with this vital element and, by extension, the communities 
that fundamentally identified with these resources. 
Imperial Inca Sites and Water Features 
The heartland of the Inca Empire was the large and fertile Cuzco Valley located in the south-central highlands of Peru. Prior to their emergence as the dominant local players circa AD. 1400, the Inca were but one of several ethnic groups jockeying for power in the region (Bauer and Covey 2002). Once control of the area had been achieved, the Inca embarked upon an ambitious program of monu­mental construction at what was to become the imperial capital of Cuzco. Members of the Inca elite also quickly claimed lands in the lower-lying Urubamba River valley, where they wasted little

time making their architectural mark. Impressive building projects were thereafter undertaken in the greater Cuzco region by each successive Inca ruler throughout the approximately 100-year period of imperial consolidation and growth. 
The heartland sites included in the present study are Tipon, Pisac, Chinchero, and Quispiguanca (Figure l). These sites were selected on the basis of availability of relevant published data and for their association with specific Inca rulers who reigned during successive historic periods. Clearly there are several other well-known settlements from the Inca heartland, such as Machu Picchu and Ollantaytambo, that could have been incorporated into the comparative analysis offered here. Given limitations of space, however, only one attributed site per ruler could be discussed and, when possi­ble, I chose to present data on sites with less expo­sure in the literature. Even though not systematically treated, I would argue that the water-related architecture found at Machu Picchu and other sites in the lower Urubamba Valley attributed to Pachacuti is broadly similar in intent and scope to what is observed at Pisac, as will be discussed below. With respect to Cuzco proper and the sites within its immediate orbit, they were excluded from the present study due to both the unique status of the capital city and the temporally composite nature of the architectural elements that comprise it. 
Sometime during the early fifteenth century, the Inca turned their attention beyond the Cuzco Val­ley and began a campaign of conquest that rapidly led to the coalescence of Tawantinsuyu. By most accounts, they moved first to annex the peoples and lands of the Titicaca basin to the south. This was followed by the subjugation of the central and northern highlands and the Peruvian coast. Subse­quent advances incorporated northwest Argentina and the northern half of Chile, followed by Huayna Capac's conquest ofnorthemmost Ecuador (D' Al­troy 2002:65-76; Parssinen 1992; Rowe 1946:206-209). Based on the broad outline of the history of imperial expansion, it is possible to derive a general idea of the sequence of construction of provincial Inca centers. Given that the overall dura­tion of the imperial phase of Inca hegemony was probably less than a century, radiocarbon dates are of little help in trying to determine the precise order of building episodes. The historical outline of impe­rial expansion, together with geographic distance from Cuzco, therefore, offers the best method of approximating the general sequence of construc­tion of Inca sites in the provinces. 
The provincial sites included in the present study are Pumpu, Huanuco Pampa, Tomebamba, and

The focus is primarily upon the northern realm of the Empire because the sites in this sector gener­ally have the best site maps and architectural data available.

dedicated exclusively to the lineage of each ruler (Niles 1987, 1999). Tipon, situated approximately 20 km east of Cuzco (Figure 1), contains an array of monumental agricultural terraces and impressive waterworks covering an area of approximately 2.5 km2. The site had a significant pre-Inca occupation dating perhaps to the Middle Horizon (Bauer and Covey 2002). It subsequently came under Inca con­trol ca. 1200 AD. and was later purportedly con­verted into the royal estate of the Inca emperor Wiracocha (Bauer 2004:87; LaLone 1985). Given the presumed reign of Inca Wiracocha, the imper­ial component of the site likely dates to the early fifteenth century. Tipon has been described as an "Inca water garden" owing to its impressive dis­play of hydraulic engineering and associated fea­tures (Wright 2006:73). As in the case of Machu Picchu, Inca Tipon appears to have been specifi­cally sited to take advantage of a natural spring that provided consistent flow year-round (Wright 2006). 
The central feature of Tipon is a magnificent series of 13 enormous stone-faced terraces irrigated by a sophisticated set of canals and hydraulic drop structures (Figure 3). The principal water source for the terraces is the spring that issues from the base of the volcanic slope on which the site is built. The flow of this spring was concentrated and enhanced by Inca hydraulic specialists through the use of stone conduits (Wright 2006:45-48). From the head works, the spring was channeled into three canal systems that distributed water to the central terraces, as well as to the residential zones below (Figure 4). The middle of the three canals drops immediately into an elaborate fountain that bifur­cates twice to create four separate jets of water (Figure 5). The western channel feeds the west side of the monumental terraces and likely continued on to a residential complex in the southwestern sector of the site. The eastern channel flowed directly to the elite house group situated on the east side of the upper terrace. Approximately 50 m beyond the principal fountain along the central canal, the water is diverted into a small (2 m2) enclosure with interior wall niches interpreted as a bath (Wright 2006:69). The location of this feature midway between the elite house group and the prin­cipal stairway lends support to the idea that it func­tioned as a facility for ritual cleansing.

The main spring at Tipon was supplemented by a stone-lined canal and a 4.5 m tall aqueduct that carried water over 3 km from a river located to the north. The canal supplied another zone of elite architecture at the site located to the west of the ter­races (Wright 2006). Two structures in this zone have significant water-related features. The first is a building complex referred to as the lntiwatana (Wright 2006:76-77). Water from the river-sup­plied canal was routed to an interior fountain in a room on the north side of this complex. The water then flowed through the compound via a sub-floor channel, exiting the south side through a drop chute (Wright 2006:76). The other structure was a walled, U-shaped plaza, approximately 35 x 23 min size, located near the southern terminus of the aqueduct (Wright 2006:76). Though the walls of this enclo­sure were built of field stone, the interior was faced with a veneer of fine cut stone blocks and contained a series of large trapezoidal niches. A short canal carried water from the aqueduct to a small interior room at the north end of the U-shaped enclosure (Wright 2006:77-78). The function of this struc­ture, which is unique within Tawantinsuyu, is unclear, though most certainly the ingress of water played some key role. 
The totality of the hydraulic evidence at Tipon suggests a colossal concern with control over, as well as admiration for, the movement of water and its incorporation into the built environment created by the Inca. From the siting of the monumental ter­races in relation to the hillside spring, to the her­culean effort expended in diverting the flow of a distant river, to the number of features lavishly designed with and around water, the intent to osten­tatiously demonstrate an intimate relationship with this elemental substance seems obvious, if not exaggerated. A hierarchy of social relations may also be read into the channeling of the flows from both the river and the spring as they wended their way down from the uppermost elite residences and structures to the occupants of the lower residential zones and valley floor below via the canals that linked them into a single social unit.

to the northeast of Cuzco, approximately 3 ,300 m asl (Figure 1). Its construction is generally attrib­uted to Pachacuti, a son of the Inca emperor Wira­cocha, following the former's defeat of the local Cuyos ethnic group-an event dated to the mid­fifteenth century (Kaulicke et al. 2003; Niles 1999:76). That the site was a sacred locale prior to the Inca occupation is evidenced by the presence of an earlier funerary complex containing several hundred burials built into the cliffs opposite the Inca component (Kaulicke et al. 2003). While Inca-Pisac is perhaps best known for its impressive and exten­sive flights of stone-faced terraces, it in fact com­prises a number of spatially segregated and archi­tecturally distinct units dispersed across an area of approximately 2 km2. The uppermost sector, which contains the finest architecture, occupies a north­south trending ridge situated between two rivers. 
The ridge top zone oflnca architecture is delim­ited by several stone-lined canals that feed a num­ber of baths and fountains (Figure 6). The longest (Canal 2), approximately l km in length, runs along the west side of the ridge (Kaulicke et al. 2003:34).

Intiwatana sector. The latter zone contains the highest quality Inca architecture at the site. Imme­diately prior to entering this sector, the long canal joins with a shorter one (Canal 4) emanating from a probable spring associated with a set of build­ings located just above the Intiwatana. The merged waters of the two canals then enter an elegantly carved channel that directs the flow in a 90-degree tum to the east, passing through a series of seven fountains and small pools in front of what is clearly the most important huaca complex at the site (Kaulicke et al. 2003:46) (Figure 7). 
Returning to the north end of the ridge, there is another canal that taps into the east side of the Kita­mayu River several hundred meters above the funerary complex. This channel (Canal 1) feeds a set of four small baths, each approximately 2 m2 in size, situated below the Qallaq'asa sector that also contains an important carved stone huaca on its uppermost level. After providing for the baths, this canal curves east, directing water toward a number of fountains and spouts still visible in the northeastern sector of the site, which consists of a residential zone of pirca and adobe constructions (Kaulicke et al. 2003). 
The role of water at Pisac as an element that both delineated and connected the different sec­tors of the site is clearly indicated. The emphasis here again seems to be on the movement of water, as well as its integration into the cultural land­scape created by the Inca. In this case, the chan­nelized flows connect the ancestral sector of the site to the sacred sector constructed by the Inca, perhaps with the intent of animating the stone hua­cas of the Inca through their physical connection and continuous flow. The harnessing of ancestrally significant waters in service to the imperial state seems a clear expression of dominance over the defeated local group. The larger number of baths at Pisac may also represent an increased empha­sis on ritual purification or cleansing as an evolv­ing concern of the state. 
Numerous other sites in the lower Urubamba Valley associated with the emperor Pachacuti, such as Machu Picchu, Phuyu Pata Marca, Chacha­bamba, Wifiay Wayna, and Choquesuysuy, display similar characteristics to Pisac with respect to waterworks. Each of these sites contains a series of small fountain rooms or baths of similar size to those observed in the Qallaq'asa sector, arrayed either side-by-side (as at Pisac) or vertically and connected by a continuous flow of water through open stone-lined or carved stone canals (see Fejos 1944; Maclean 1987; Wright and Zegarra 2000). At Machu Picchu, Chachabamba, and Phuyu Pata Marca, the baths and canals are physically asso­ciated with major carved and enclosed stone hua­cas that constitute important focal points of each site in similar fashion to Pisac. At Machu Picchu, the central chain of elegantly constructed fountains and canals unites the principal huaca at the site­encompassed by a circular masonry wall-with the niched cave room that likely housed ancestral remains situated directly below it. This suggests a further analogy with Pisac and underscores the relation between water, huacas, and ancestors seemingly being asserted in a highly visible way at these sites. 
Chinchero. The site of Chinchero is located approximately 20 km northwest of Cuzco at an ele­vation of 3,760 m asl (Figure 1 ). Prior to Inca set­tlement, Chinchero had an important Killke occupation (Alcina 1976:142; Rivera 1976). Inca construction at the site is attributed to the ruler Topa Inca and is believed to have been undertaken dur­ing the later years of his reign, which would sug­gest sometime during the third quarter of the fifteenth century (Betanzos 1996 [1551-1557]: 159-162; Nair 2003:61; Sarmiento 2007 [1572]:153-154). Jose Alcina, who conducted large-scale excavations here in the 1970s, describes the site as a planned urban center comprising three principal parts: a zone of impressive agricultural terraces, a ceremonial sector centered on a large plaza, and an administrative-residential sector orga­nized around a smaller plaza (Alcina 1976:41). The urban core of the site incorporates a variety of large rectangular structures, niched walls, staircases, and carved stone outcrops and boulders. 
Excavations at the site revealed a sophisticated drainage system involving a complex network of open-air and subterranean channels (Alcina 1976:44). Investigators marveled over the intricacy and precision of the system, describing it as a remarkable feat of hydraulic engineering (Alcina 1976:46). A later study at Chinchero suggests that the core area may have been built upon a series of natural underground springs that were integrated into the architectural layout of the site (Nair 2003:116). Beyond the elaborate system of drains

and canals, the only other documented water fea­ture at the site is a single fountain associated with a niched wall above the terrace zone (Nair 2003:67). 
The general lack of more elaborate water fea­tures, such as fountains, pools, or baths, at Topa Inca's estate of Chinchero is noteworthy when con­sidered in light of the architectural and hydraulic proclivities of his predecessors. It is possible that the success of imperial rule by this point no longer depended on the conspicuous display of control over water resources. Though mastery over the flow of water is still clearly evident in the hydraulic works uncovered at the site, the control is decid­edly less visible and more occluded, occurring mostly below the surface of the built environment rather than above and visibly intertwined with it. 
Quispiguanca. The royal estate of Huayna Capac, son of Topa Inca and last ruler of a unified empire, was situated in a reclaimed segment of the Urubamba Valley north of Cuzco (Figure 1). The estate was likely developed during the early years of Huayna Capac's reign near the end of the fif­teenth or beginning of the sixteenth century. The principal architectural complex on the estate was the palatial compound of Quispiguanca, situated at 2,900 m asl (Farrington 1995; Niles 1999). The palace complex was constructed upon a massive stone-faced platform measuring approximately 200 x 400 m in size and elevated at least several meters above the original ground surface (Niles 1999:156---157). The top of the platform was seg­regated into three distinct spaces: a massive open plaza in the southern sector containing a sacred rock and probable ushnu; a slightly elevated cen­tral sector containing a number of rectangular struc­tures; and a zone of large agricultural terraces in the northern half (Niles 1999: 156---176). 
Though the central sector is poorly preserved, it was likely the elite residential zone. Remnant canal segments and wall stubs observed in this sec­tor led Niles (1999: 168) to suggest that it may have contained an "elaborated water control structure" or some type of "water shrine." Based on geomor­phology and sediments, investigators at the site also posit that there was a large artificial lake located immediately below the south wall of the stone-faced platform (Farrington 1995; Niles 
1999:173-176). Excavations conducted near the center of this area revealed the presence of a semi-subterranean structure measuring 14 x 25 x 2 m deep, constructed of well-fitted masonry and described as an "L-shaped reservoir" (Farrington 1995:63). Niles (1999:175-176) suggests this structure may have been related to the manage­ment of the waters impounded within the larger arti­ficial lake, though no feeder canals or drains were discovered. She posits that the larger lake may have been created for aesthetic purposes to serve as a reflecting pond (Niles 1999:176). 
Another smaller component of Huayna Capac's royal estate known as Cocha Sontor is located approximately 5 km north of the palatial compound (Niles 1999:176-188). This sector, though also rather poorly preserved, was found to contain sev­eral unusual structures, including a niched wall, a small square room (6 x 6 m) with multiple door­ways, and a large semi-subterranean rectangular structure. The latter feature measures approxi­mately 38 x 14 x 1 m deep and is constructed of well-fitted masonry. Niles (1999:185-187) inter­prets the semi-sunken structure as a pool or reser­voir and suggests that it, too, may have been intended as a reflecting pond. 
With respect to the sites associated with Huayna Capac in the imperial heartland, there still seems to be a clear intent to incorporate water fea­tures. But at these later imperial sites, the empha­sis is on the larger-scale containment or impoundment of water, rather than on delighting in its flow. The large reservoirs and artificial lakes possibly reflect a new emphasis on conspicuous consumption and a lack of concern with even a metaphorical allusion to a connection between the Inca and his subjects. 
The four imperial Inca sites discussed to this point are explicitly associated with the last four rulers of Tawantinsuyu and are located within 25 km of the capital city of Cuzco. The role of water as reflected in the different types of features found at these sites clearly seems to vary-arguably as a consequence of the changing political imperatives of the imperial regime. Though the archaeological record is never a perfect reflection of the past, it nonetheless often does suggest patterned change. The posited evolving role of water at Inca sites in the imperial heartland, from hierarchically-ordered fluid connector to conspicuously impounded wealth, will be compared to evidence for its manip­ulation in the provinces as the Empire expanded.

Provincial Sites 
Pumpu. Pumpu was the principal administrative center for the Inca province of Chinchaycocha in the central highlands of Peru (Figure 2). It is located approximately 600 km northwest of Cuzco. According to early sources, Pumpu was established by order of Topa Inca during the 14 70s (Arellano and Matos 2007; Matos 1994). The site is situated on the right bank of the Man­taro River, several kilometers west of Lake Junin at an elevation of 4,100 m asl. Though covering approximately a square kilometer and containing at least 1,700 structures, Pumpu does not display the fine masonry associated with the classic Inca style (Brown 1992; Matos 1994). Rather, all structures at the site, even those situated around the perimeter of the central plaza, are of pirca construction involving the use of rough field stones set in clay mortar. 
With respect to water-related features at the site, there is one element identified as an "Inca bath," a I-km-long open canal that passes through the center of the large central plaza, and a sizable depression west of the plaza interpreted as a water holding tank (Figure 8). All three of these fea­tures were connected. The purported bath is sit­uated inside the most important house compound in Pumpu (AD-11), which is located on the east side of the central plaza (Matos 1994:152). It is small (2.35 x 1.9 x I m deep) and was fed by a single grooved-stone water channel (Matos 1994: 154). This feature is connected to the water­holding tank located 550 m west of the plaza via the I-km-long canal (Matos 1994:209). This reservoir feature consists of a rectangular-shaped depression measuring 32 x 15 x l m deep; it has a central division but no evidence of formal retaining walls or fitted-stone masonry (Matos 
1994:210). It was filled via another open canal that brought water from springs located some 3 .5 km from the site (Matos 1994:210). The only extant hydraulic features found at Pumpu thus seem to be exclusively and conspicuously directed to the elite residential unit situated on the east side of the central plaza.

Figure 9. The "Casa del Inca" sector on the east side of Hminuco Pampa's central plaza, indicating location of bath, pools, and canals (adapted from Morris and Thompson 1985:54-55). 
Hudnuco Pampa. Huanuco Pampa is probably the best known of Inca provincial sites. It lies 100 km northwest of Pumpu and is also thought to have been constructed by order ofTopa Inca slightly later in time, circa A.D.1475 (Harth-Terre 1964; Morris and Thompson 1970, 1985). Covering an area of 2 km2, the site is situated on a broad, windswept plain nearly 4,000 m asl (Morris and Thompson 1985:56). Archaeological investigations indicate that the impe­rial settlement once contained at least 3,500 build­ings of widely varying quality and construction (Morris and Thompson 1985:56). As in the case of many Inca centers, Huanuco Pampa was organized around a large, central plaza. The perimeter of this space was defined by numerous Jong, narrow build­ings, behind which were located various residential and workshop blocks arrayed in four broad sectors. 
The finest architecture at Huanuco Pampa, as at Pumpu, was located on the east side of the central plaza. This sector, referred to as the "Casa del Inca," comprised a series of nested, individual kancha, or walled compounds (Figure 9). The innermost of these units enclosed a small bath, situated in the center of what had formerly been a segregated architectural space aligned with the central, east­west axis of this architectural group (Morris and Thompson 1985:125). The bath is constructed of fine cut-stone masonry and measures 4 x 5 x 1 m deep. It was fed by two grooved water channels in the west wall, while entry to it was gained through a trapezoidal opening and steps on the east side; the north and south interior walls are niched. 
The bath's feeder channels connected to a large (17 x 19 m), rectangular, walled depression located immediately to the west that was interpreted as a "pool" (Morris and Thompson 1970:349). This pool was in turn fed by a covered canal connect­ing to the Huachac drainage. Another larger rec­tangular depression (65 x 35 m) lay to the east of the residential kancha-beyond the palace sector but still within the wall enclosing the architectural unit. This feature was interpreted as a large pool or a sunken garden (Morris and Thompson 1970:350, 1985:83). It appears to have been fed

by one of the longest canals at the site, which chan­neled water from a spring-fed drainage to it exclu­sively (Harth-Terre 1964:22-23; Morris and Thompson 1985:54-55, 83). 
The administrative center of Hminuco Pampa clearly did not lack for water (Harth-Terre 1964:22). There were various springs, drainages, and conduits that routed water throughout the site. But waterusage at Hminuco, while seemingly more dispersed, was nonetheless segregated-the flows dividing different sectors from one another and apparently serving distinct social units. In addi­tion, as seen at Pumpu, the elite residential sector contained a bath-like feature fed by its own exclu­sive water source, and the site displayed no other elaborate fountains or waterworks. 
Provincial Sites in Collasuyu and Pacific Coast. 
The Collasuyu sector of the Inca Empire, com­prising highland Bolivia, northwest Argentina and the northern half of Chile, was also purportedly incorporated by Topa Inca in the latter half of the fifteenth century, as was much of the desert coast to the west pertaining to Cuntisuyu.Among the bet­ter known imperial centers in Collasuyu are Incallacta (Coben 20 12; Nordenskiold 19 17), Potrero de Payogasta (D' Altroy et al. 2000), Shin­cal de Quimivfl (Raffino 2004), Tamberia del Inca de Chilecito (Hyslop 1990), and Cortaderas (Acuto 2004). While these sites contain many of the fea­tures associated with imperial Inca centers­including large central plazas, ushnus, rectangular buildings, and kancha units-none to date exhibit the type of elaborated waterworks, baths, or foun­tains commonly observed elsewhere in the Empire. This is an interesting variation in imperial practice from which a number of possible implications might be drawn, but discussion lies beyond the scope of the present paper. 
The story is somewhat similar for imperial sites on the coast, which are also associated with the con­quests and reign of Topa Inca. Of the better known sites, including Farfan (Mackey 2006, 20 10), Chiq­uitoy Viejo (Conrad 1977), Inkawasi (Hyslop 1985), and Tambo Colorado (Protzen 2006, 2008), only the last reportedly contains any type of water­related architectural features. At Tambo Colorado, two interior features found in rooms on the west side of the architectural unit called the North Palace were identified as baths (see Protzen 2006:Figure 13). The first is in Room 24, located in the center of the central architectural unit on the west side. This room measures approximately 3.5 x 4.5 m, while the stone-lined "bath" in the middle is some­what smaller and approximately a meter deeper than the surrounding floor. It is fed by a short stone­lined channel that enters through the east wall of the room. The second bath feature is in Room 57, which is located in the southeast comer of the north­west room block-the area interpreted as the liv­ing quarters of the Inca (Protzen 2006). This stone-lined bath is slightly larger than the first, measuring 3 x 2 x 1.5 m deep; two interior wall niches are extant, as is a stone drain, and poly­chrome paint residue on the walls (see Cyark and Partners, 2010; Protzen 2008). There is no infor­mation available on the water delivery systems for these features, suggesting, through their lack of identification, that subterranean rather than surface channels were likely utilized to carry water to these extremely private interior spaces. 
Tomebamba. According to various chroniclers, Tomebamba was conceived as a second Cuzco and intentionally built to replicate the layout and grandeur of the Inca capital (Cabello 1951 [1586]:340-345; Guaman Poma 1936 [1615]: 185). The site was originally constructed by Topa Inca and later embellished by his son Huayna Capac, who was reportedly born there. Both Uhle (1923), who excavated therein the early 1920s,and Idrovo (2000), who performed more extensive investigations in the 1980s, reported evidence of two distinct construction phases at the site. Uhle ( 1923:5) also remarked upon several features, such as the specific sty le of masonry and building types, which he linked to other sites built by Topa Inca. 
The modem town of Cuenca, Ecuador, overlies much of the Inca settlement and, as a consequence, relatively little of the site remains. The best pre­served sector, where both Uhle and Idrovo focused their attention, is the area known as Pumapungo. Situated on a terrace above the Tomebamba River, this sector likely corresponded both conceptually and physically to its toponymic twin in Cuzco. The architectural elements identified in this zone include a number of large kancha, various rectan­gular buildings identified as acllawasi and kallanka, the remnants of a circular enclosure inter­preted as a sun temple, a paved causeway, an exten­sive network of canals and drainages, two baths, a series of terraces, a tunnel, and a carved stone huaca

(1923:8) referred to as the Exterior Palace. Mea­suring at least 81 min length, the canal was stone­lined, approximately 15 cm wide, and sloped downward from west to east. The western portion was capped by elongated stones to the point at which it crossed under a paved causeway; the east­ern half appears to have been uncovered. This canal originated in a small (2 x 1.25 x .5 m deep), stone­lined feature interpreted as a bath situated just north and outside of the Exterior Palace (Uhle 1923). The bath, which had a paved floor of cut and fit­ted stones, was supplied by a spout that entered the west wall; the feeder canal is no longer extant. 
Separating the upper portion of Pumapungo, with its imperial edifices, from the floodplain of the Tomebamba River below were a series of stone­faced terraces. The lower zone was directly con­nected to the upper by both a staircase and a tunnel. The floodplain was found to contain a number of monumental hydraulic works associated with the Inca occupation (Idrovo 2000: 189-206). These include a large artificial lake or water impoundment sector, a major stone-lined canal that paralleled the river, and a fairly elaborate set of baths or catch­ment pools. The artificial lake was situated at the base of the terraced slope, defined on its eastern (and possibly western) side by a low earthen wall, and measuring approximately 125 x 75 m. It was located directly below the structure interpreted as the sun temple (Idrovo 2000:192-193). 
At the southeastern end of this former lagoon is the off-take for the stone-lined canal. This water­way follows a straight course on a southeasterly ori­entation for a distance of 350 m, emptying at its other terminus into the river (Figure 11). It is approximately 70 cm wide and defined by two stone walls that vary in height from 40 cm to more than a meter at opposite ends (Idrovo 2000: 201-202). The canal evidences two structures inter­preted as ritual baths and/or water collection points (Idrovo 2000:202-204). The first is located at the northwest end of the canal and is associated with the off-take point from the lake. It consists of a poorly preserved semicircular alignment of cut stones. Sixty-seven meters to the southeast along the canal is another stone structure that is bisected by the waterway and cruciform in shape. Idrovo (2000:202) referred to the central portion of this feature, which measures 5.3 x 6.1 m, as a "pool" (estanque). Adjacent to either side of the central component are smaller chambers measuring approximately 4 x 2 m. The two lateral chambers have floors of large worked sandstone blocks slightly higher in elevation than the center pool.

Idrovo (2000:205) postulates that the entire struc­ture may have functioned as a filtration system designed to provide purified water. 
Both the flow and the impoundment of water were clear concerns in the architectural design of Inca-Tomebamba. The elaborate system of drainages and canals in the Pumapungo sector recall the arrangement seen at Topa Inca's estate at Chinchero, while the large artificial lake situated immediately below and outside the main ceremo­nial sector parallels the layout observed at Huayna Capac's estate at Quispiguanca. The small, private bath associated with the elite residential compound in Pumapungo, fed by an exclusive water source and exiting via a long canal to a separate residen­tial sector of the site, is analogous to the bath arrangements observed at both Pumpu and Huanuco Pampa. The hydraulic features observed at Tomebamba thus seem to represent a mix of interests both in the large-scale impoundment and control of water and in the hierarchy and exclusion expressed by the flows and stoppages of water through the site. These are the same concerns evi­denced in later imperial architecture in the heart ­land associated with both Topa Inca and his son Huayna Capac. 
Caranqui. The final provincial site to be dis­cussed is that oflnca-Caranqui, located at the north­ernmost edge of the Empire in northern highland Ecuador (Figure 12). This site likely represents the last major imperial building event the Inca under­took prior to the Spanish invasion (Bray and Eche­verria 2009). The Inca installation was constructed adjacent to the principal settlement of the local Caranqui population, who, together with kinsmen from the greater Imbabura region, put up a long and fierce resistance to the Inca invasion of their terri­tory (Cabello 1951 [1586]:361-386). When Huayna Capac finally prevailed sometime in the early sixteenth century,2 he exacted retribution in the form of a massacre of the entire adult male pop­ulation (Cabello 1951 [1586]:361-386). The bod­ies of the dead were dumped in a nearby lake, which came to be known as Yaguarcocha ("Blood Lake") (Cieza de Le6n 1986 [ 1553]: 125-126; Montesinos 1957 [1644]:109-111). The site oflnca-Caranqui is situated approximately 4 km south of Yaguar­cocha on the lower northern slopes of Mount Imbabura. 
The ethnohistoric data suggest at least two pos­sibilities regarding the origins and history oflnca­Caranqui. One chronicler who seems to have had considerable knowledge of the circum-Quito region states that Huayna Capac, within a year of his vic­tory, "ordered that a settlement based on the design of Cuzco be built [at Caranqui] for his court" and that "a sumptuous palace to his father the sun be re-built" there (Montesinos ( 1957 [ 1644]: 111). An

earlier source, however, attributes imperial con­structions at Caranqui to Atahualpa, who is said to have ordered new edifices both to commemorate the death of his father (Huayna Capac) and to serve as the focal point of his upcoming wedding and installation as successor (Betanzos 1996 [1551-1557]: 214--217). These two possibilities are not mutually exclusive, and archaeological evi­dence at the site actually suggests two separate con­struction episodes (Bray and Echeverria 2009). Regardless of precise attribution, we can confi­dently assign construction at Inca-Caranqui to the last stage of imperial expansion, probably during the second decade of the sixteenth century. 
Excavations conducted at Inca-Caranqui over the past several years have revealed the presence of a residential zone with several large rectangu­lar edifices; a kallanka of pirca construction; a semi-subterranean structure with associated water­works; a network of canals and drainage features; and a possible settling tank (Bray and Echeverria 2009, 2010, 2011) (Figure 12). As at many impe­rial sites, the elite core oflnca-Caranqui was fur­nished with a sophisticated hydraulic system that orchestrated the flow of water through it. Though the system is only partially intact, it appears that at least one source of water entered from the south­eastern sector of the site and transited through its center via a large, stone-lined, covered canal. This feature, the extant central segment of which mea­sures 12 m long x 20 cm wide x 34 cm deep, ran N!S in between the residential zone and the semi­subterranean structure. It and another canal run­ning along the northeast edge of the site converged upon a square, stone-lined receptacle, 85 x 85 x 85 cm in size, with entry and exit spouts on the east and west sides, respectively. This feature is interpreted as a canal access point and/or settling tank. Also found at the site are two distinct styles of canals, possibly relating to functional differ­ences or distinct construction episodes. The first type is lined and capped with minimally modified cobbles, while the second consists of individual segments of cut stone 50-70 cm long with pecked and grooved channels arranged end to end to form a single course. In one instance, the two different styles are found side by side paralleling one another, suggesting the possibility that they car­ried different fluids or that one style constituted a replacement system for the other (Figure 13). 
The most impressive feature discovered to date at Inca-Caranqui is the large semi-subterranean structure of fine cut-stone masonry (Figure 14). This structure, which measures 16 x 10 x 1 m deep, incorporates a number of different water delivery and drainage devices. Clearly the flow of water both into and out of this feature was key to whatever activities were performed here, as was the human movement into and out of the architectural space via the stepped entrances located at each of the four comers. Water was directed into the structure through a series of spouts along the south wall and a major carved stone canal running along the southeast side. Any water retained on the floor was apparently evac­uated to the east via two carved drain holes fitted with stone plugs that connected to a subterranean canal. Remote-sensing data indicate that the Inca purposefully leveled and prepared the excavated cavity of the semi-subterranean temple to receive the first of the two stone floors present; the drain holes passed through both. 
This semi-subterranean structure, interpreted as a water temple, is almost surely the pool ("estanque") commented upon by Cieza de Leon (1986 [1553]:Ch.37) when he passed through the region in the mid-sixteenth century. The feature accords well with the design of other sites associ­ated with Huayna Capac, which appear to have incorporated large bodies of standing water, per­haps functioning, as suggested by Niles (1999), as reflecting ponds. But the specific types of hydraulic devices seen in the water temple at Caranqui, e.g., the canals, spouts, and drains, sug­gest more of a concern with the falling and flow­ing movement of water through this semi-subterranean space than a concern with its impoundment. The structure, in fact, calls to mind the notion of paccha, a Quechua term that refers to the falling or gushing of water into a basin (Brundage 1967:379). The size of the water fea­ture at Caranqui suggests ritual performances of a more public nature, possibly involving larger num­bers of people than the presumed activities asso­ciated with the smaller baths seen at the other provincial sites. Similarly, the provisions made for the entry of both people and water into the enclosed space of the structure would seem to indicate a con­cern with physical interaction between this ele­mental substance and the Inca body.

While the principal water feature at Caranqui shares some resemblance with those documented at Huayna Capac's royal estate in the Urubamba Valley, it is nonetheless quite distinct in terms of dimensions, manipulation of flows (both human and liquid), and the seeming performative intent of the space. These innovations might relate to new architectural directives and ideological con­cerns emanating later from Huayna Capac's son, Atahualpa. Unfortunately, we have no other extant buildings or sites associated with the latter ruler to help support or refute this proposition. More important than associating specific features with individual rulers, however, is the issue of how these may inform upon local circumstances and evolving imperial needs. In other words, we might better view the physical and conceptual innova­tions displayed in the water temple at Caranqui as a response to specific conditions and new chal­lenges to imperial consolidation, rather than as reflecting the stylistic inclinations of individual rulers, though such may, of course, have factored into the architectural equation. 
The waters that supplied Inca-Caranqui ulti­mately derived from and formed a physical bond with Mount lmbabura, the preeminent apu (lord) of the Caranqui polity (Espinosa 1988:189). The diversion, capture, and ritual usage of these waters within the elaborate semi-subterranean temple at Inca-Caranqui suggest a return to the conspicuous, and perhaps more public, flaunting of control over a vital resource of a defiant but ultimately defeated local people. No other provincial Inca site mani­fests such an elaborate architectural statement regarding imperial prerogatives vis-a-vis water. The unique water-related architecture seen at Caranqui may reflect a new, more overt way of expressing dominance over conquered peoples and/or new emphases on the physical and ritual manipulation of this vital substance near the outer limits of Inca hegemony during the later phases of imperial rule.

Discussion and Conclusions 
The Inca, like their ancestors, were clearly masters of hydraulic engineering. Their virtuosity in the harnessing and manipulation of natural flows was built upon the technical savoir faire of generations of Andean peoples. What they may have surpassed their predecessors in was the co-optation of the symbolic significance of water for their own impe­rial ends. In the Andes, as in many parts of the world, water is laden with multiple layers of mean­ing. Here, in particular, water carried connotations of origins, identity, community, and connectedness. The archaeological and architectural evidence pre­sented in this paper suggests that the Inca exploited the symbolic potency of water to express politically based notions of inclusion, exclusion, hierarchy, and dominance throughout Tawantinsuyu. 
The survey of imperial Inca sites indicates that the Cuzqueiios expended considerable effort on the construction of water-related features, carefully orchestrating and integrating natural flows into the architecture of the empire. In so doing, they trans­formed a vital natural substance into a cultural arti­fact of the state. Given the emphasis placed on the manipulation of water, it seems reasonable to assume that the Inca viewed its control as a key component of the imperializing process. The close association with water architecturally proclaimed by the Inca suggests that the material expression of this relationship served specific legitimating and/or ideological functions. The intent of the con­textual and comparative study presented here was to ascertain how water-related architecture may have furthered the imperial agenda, and whether the manipulation of water as an aspect of the impe­rializing process may have evolved as the Empire expanded and solidified.

At the outset of their hegemonic project, the Inca invested heavily in the conspicuous display of their intimate association with aqueous flows. The water-related architecture noted at both Tipon and Pisac (as well as other sites attributed to the Inca ruler Pachacuti, such as Machu Picchu, Chachabamba, and Choquesuysuy) emphasized this relationship on a monumental scale in highly visible ways .At Tipon, water flows were integrated into a variety of architectural spaces, ranging from small enclosures to elaborate multi-chambered structures to agricultural terraces. Power was mate­rially expressed through the capture and diversion of distant waters channeled directly into the impe­rial center. Identity and hierarchy were established through the sharing and sequencing of water usage. At Pisac, the above-ground channeling of flows seemed to integrate both space and time, connect­ing the sacred sectors of the Inca and the original (conquered) inhabitants into a unified if hierarchi­cally organized whole. 
At Chinchero, the estate of Topa Inca, there is noticeably less visual emphasis on the manipula­tion of water, comparatively speaking. Rather, while control is still maintained, it literally goes underground with the water management system essentially hidden from view. It is possible that the degree to which the Inca chose to materially express their intimate association with water may have related to the original cultural substrate of the site. Both Tipon and Pisac had to be wrested from non­compliant local populations, while it is not clear that this was the case for Chinchero. The subse­quent emphasis on the impoundment of water at the late imperial site of Quispiguanca speaks to possibly evolving ideological concerns of the state. Rather than employing water to materially express a shared connection across a continuous, if hierar­chically-ordered, corporate body, the new empha­sis on containment of aqueous resources and the segregation of flows may reflect new views of social discontinuity and the discreteness of differ­ent classes and categories of people. In other words, the changes noted in the water-related architecture found at earlier and later sites in the imperial heart­land may reflect the evolving political ideology of the ruling elite. 
In the provinces, hydraulic architecture is gen­erally less prevalent and less elaborated than in the heartland. Nonetheless, the presence and placement of such features in the overall configuration of provincial sites indicate an obvious concern with the material expression of specific ideological prin­ciples. At Pumpu and Huanuco Pampa, waters and flows were clearly captured and segregated. Both sites contained small, private baths within the elite residential sectors that were fed by exclusive sources via very long and conspicuously routed canals. The coastal center ofTambo Colorado offers similar evi­dence of highly private bathing rituals within the inner-most sanctum of the elite residential quarters. While the ablutions performed in these features were almost certainly not intended for public view­ing, the general populace would have nonetheless been aware, in the case of Pumpu and Huanuco, of the exclusive dedication of once communally shared resources to foreign bodies and occupiers. The restriction of access to this elemental substance, as well as the method of its delivery via canals and spouts, would have also likely been important in shaping local understandings of new political and social configurations, relationships, and identities. 
Further north and somewhat later in time, the imperial site of Tomebamba exhibits water-related features similar to those found in the central high­lands, as well as certain new elements. These var­ious features likely reflect evolving strategies of statecraft and the distinctive material expressions of these by Topa Inca and his successor, Huayna Capac. As at the administrative centers of Huanuco and Pumpu, the elite residential sector of Tome­bamba contained a small stone-lined feature inter­preted as a bath that was fed by a presumed exclusive water source. In this case, however, the bath appears to have been situated in an open area rather than enclosed within a building. As in the case of Chinchero, the elite sector of Tomebamba was also underlain by a sophisticated infrastructural system of drains and canals. In addition to these hydraulic elements, Tomebamba contained a large artificial lake, probably comparable to that associ­ated with the royal estate of Huayna Capac at Quispiguanca, and an enormous canal connecting it to the river that flowed along the southwest side of the site. The elaborate tank structure identified along the route of this canal and interpreted as a water filtration system speaks to the emerging seg­regation of the once shared elemental substance of water into different categories of quality and lev­els of access.

Finally, at the site of Caranqui, constructed on the northern frontier during the final decades of the Empire's existence, we again see what appears to be an evolving imperial approach to engagement with the essential substance of water. The unique semi-subterranean temple documented here speaks to state interests in the large-scale capture of water and its movement into and through an elaborate architectural space. The unusual size and config­uration of this structure points to its ritual usage by potentially larger numbers of people. The archi­tectural elements suggest the performance of rit­uals that emphasized the movement of both (Inca) bodies and aqueous fluids, and the interaction and entwining of these at various points within the enclosed space. The location of this structure in the heart of Inca-Caranqui speaks to the ongoing entanglement of politics, ritual and water even dur­ing the later phases of imperial expansion. The elaborate orchestration of flows through the cen­ter of the site, together with the use of stone-lined versus carved and covered versus uncovered canals, also suggests a continued concern with the transformation of this once natural resource into an artifact of the state that communicated social difference and hierarchy. 
Throughout the imperial realm, the Inca intro­duced new ways of delivering and interacting with water. The infrastructural systems put in place by the state would have altered local relationships with this elemental substance. Rather than com­munity members fetching water directly from their ancestral spring or flow and carrying it back to their homes, access would have become more restricted and potentially limited to channelized off-takes and spouts installed by the imperial masters. Rather than going to the source to bathe or be cleansed, flows were directed to the architectural spaces of the Empire, where Inca bodies asserted privileged access to the purifying properties of water. Through the physical and ritual manipula­tion of water, the Inca transformed this vital ele­mental substance into an artifact of the state. In colonizing the ancestral resources of local com­munities, the Inca also colonized historical mem­ories of origins and identity. The new technologies of water management and control would likely have both generated and reflected changes in sociopolitical organization. As suggested by Strang (2004:24), the characteristics of water provide a crucial metaphorical language for conceptualizing social being, knowledge, and identity. The hydraulic architecture associated with the imper­ial Inca state indicates that the Cuzquefios clearly understood the significance of this elemental sub­stance. The archaeological analysis of water fea­tures from different sectors of the Empire suggests that the material expression of the state's rela­tionship with water evolved over time in con­junction with the evolution of imperial Inca ideology and in relation to specific local and his­toric conditions.

Notes 
I. An instructive comparative case is found in the analy­sis of Balinese wet rice agriculture, water management, and political and ritual organization (Geertz 1959, 1973, 1980; Lansing 1991). 
2. Based on several lines of evidence detailed elsewhere (Bray 20 13), it is suggested that the final Inca victory over the Caranqui, led by Huayna Capac and culminating in Yaguarcocha, likely occurred sometime between 1515 and 1520. The time frame for this event is slightly later than what other scholars have proposed (e.g., Espinosa 1988; Salomon 1986:146).
