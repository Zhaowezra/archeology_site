PRECLA SSIC OBSIDIAN PROCUREMENT AND UTILIZATION AT THE 
MAYA SITE OF COLHA, BELIZE 
David 0. Brown, Meredith L. Dreiss, and Richard E. Hughes 
This study explores the early use of obsidian at the Maya site of Colha in northern Belize and the implications that varia­tions in source distribution have for the site and its regional connections. Energy dispersive x-ray fluorescence ( EDXRF) analysis of 104 specimens of obsidian from Preclassic contexts at the site identified El Chaya/ obsidian as the most com­mon overall followed closely by that from San Martin Jilotepeque. Ixtepeque obsidian, not common in many Preclassic assemblages, was also strongly represented. The results revealed a Middle Preclassic dependence on San Martin obsidian gradually diminishing through the Preclassic to the Classic period, when San Martin all but disappears from the site. A cor­responding increase in El Chaya/ obsidian use through time at Colha coincides with the rise of Kaminaljuyu in the Guatemalan highlands. Analysis of the obsidian by context indicated that El Chaya/ obsidian dominated in architectural and ritual deposits while Ixtepeque obsidian was the most common in workshops. San Martin accounted for a slightly greater percentage than El Chaya/ obsidian in middens, with Ixtepeque materials notably less common. The data indicate that Colha was connected to a broad distribution network from the Middle Preclassic onward, and that obsidian source variability was greater during the Preclassic than the subsequent Classic period. 
Este estudio explora el uso temprano de obsidiana en Colha en el norte del Belice y las implicaciones de las variaciones en la distribucion de las varias fuentes conocidas para el sitio y sus conexiones dentro de la region. El analisis de 104 e.1pec­imenes de contextos Preclasicos por espectrometriajluorescente de rayos-x tipo energia dispersiva (EDXRF) se ha identifi­cado Lafuente de El Chaya/ como la mas comun, seguido estrechamente por San Martin Jilotepeque y tambien por lxtepeque, unafuente escasa en muchas colecciones Preclasicas. Los resultados revelaron una dependencia de la obsidiana de San Martin durante el Preclasico Medio que disminuia hasta el periodo Clasico, cuando casi se desaparecio. Un contemporaneo aumento de la obsidiana de El Chaya/ coincide con el crecimiento del Kaminaljuyu. El analisis por contextos indico que la obsidiana de El Chaya/ domino en capas arquitectonicos y rituales, mientras que la de lxtepeque en talleres. La obsidiana de San Martin se mostro un porcentaje ligeramente mas grande que la de El Chaya! en basurales, mientras que la de lxtepeque Jue mucho menos comun. Colhafue conectado a una red distributiva desde el Preclasico Medio, y la variabilidad en lasfuentesfue mas amplia durante el Preclasico que el Clasico. 
T
he chemical characterization and source analysis of obsidian artifacts have enabled Mesoamerican archaeologists to investigate various socioeconomic and logistical mechanisms influencing the movement of geologically distinct obsidian from the volcanic highlands into the Maya Lowlands. Previous studies have shown that three main source areas in the Guatemalan highlands (Figure 1 ), Ixtepeque, El Chayal, and San Martfn Jilotepeque (Rio Pixcaya), were exploited by the Maya during their long history of settlement (Asaro et al. 1978; Hammond 1972, 1976; McKillop and Jackson 1988; MacKinnon 1989; Nelson 1985; Nelson and Clark 1998; Sidrys and Kimberlin 1979). Ixtepeque obsidian was heavily used in the Postclassic, El Chayal was the principal source in the Protoclassic and Classic periods, and San Martin Jilotepeque obsidian was traded into the eastern lowlands during the Middle Preclassic but declined abruptly at most sites by the Early Clas­sic period (Awe et al. I 996; Nelson and Clark 1998).

Having established that these obsidian sources were exploited in varying frequencies during dif­ferent time periods (and possibly via different net­works: see Clark and Salcedo Romero 1989; Dreiss and Brown 1989; McKillop et al. 1988), researchers turned to the examination of the interplay among logistical, chronological, functional, and contextual differences at the regional and local levels using larger data sets (Dreiss et al. 1993; Haines 2000; Jackson and Love 199 1; McKillop 1989; Rice 1984 ). With some notable exceptions (e.g., Awe and Healy 1994; Awe et al. 1996; Haines 2000; Ham­mond 199 1), relatively few obsidian studies have been undertaken at Preclassic period sites in Belize.

Awe and Healy (1994) suggest that this may be because Formative occupation levels are often inac­cessible to excavators. Given the paucity of avail­able data, the present study of the distribution of obsidian from different sources during the Pre­classic period at Colha should shed new light on the early development of trade and external rela­tions in the eastern Maya Lowlands. 
Colha in the Preclassic Period 
Strategically located in a chert-rich zone in north­ern Belize, Colha is connected by a waterway to the Caribbean coast and to the Northern River Lagoon site, a salt production and trading locale 17 km to the east (Valdez and Mock 1991). Data from more than ten field seasons of excavation, survey, and laboratory analyses suggest that Late Preclassic Colha served as a center for the fabri­cation and exportation of utilitarian chert tools (Hester and Shafer 1984, 1987, 1989, 1992; McAnany 1989; Santone 1997; Shafer and Hester 1983, 1991; Tobey et al. 1994). 
Based on fieldwork carried out by the Colha Preceramic Project from 1993 to 1995, Iceland (1997) identified two preceramic occupations at Operation 4046 (dated at 3400-1900 B.C. and 1500-900 B. C. ), concluding that the Archaic period inhabitants may have participated in a regional exchange network related to the distribution of locally produced constricted chert unifaces as early as 1500-900 B.C. Iceland also suggests continuity between the preceramic and Middle Preclassic peri­ods, noting no chronological break between the lat­est preceramic and earliest Middle Preclassic dates in the ninth century B.C. 
The long Middle Preclassic period (900-300 B.C.) at Colha is poorly documented. Although there are no large lithic workshops at this time, spe­cialized chert tool forms (macroblades) may have been produced at a cottage-industry level for local consumption and distribution to other hamlets in northern Belize (Hester and Shafer 1989). The remains of public and private structures and asso­ciated middens, burials, and caches contain an array of luxury and utilitarian items. Exotic items asso­ciated with Middle Preclassic burials found beneath the site's monumental center may indicate status differentiation (Buttles 1992). By the end of the Middle Preclassic (250 B.C.), there was a transi­tion to a more stratified community with increased population and a more complex social structure (Eaton 1980a). 
Late Preclassic Colha (250 B.C. to A.D. 250) is dominated by the mass production of stone tools. The vast quantities of primary debitage and aborted tool forms are unparalleled in the Maya lowlands; over 4,000,000 implements have been recovered from 36 Late Preclassic workshops in the core of the site (Hester and Shafer 1984; Shafer 1994). Chert workers at Colha specialized in the manu­facture of standardized tools for export to Maya consumers throughout the region (Hester and Shafer 1989). 
The Late Preclassic was a period of dramatic population increase; Eaton (1980a) estimated that a minimum of 600 persons lived within the 1 km2 central area of Colha. Expansion of the ceremonial center; construction of paved plazas, a ball court, and various public buildings; and widespread clear­ing for agriculture and surrounding settlement all suggest a degree of sociopolitical complexity. 
The Terminal Preclassic period at Colha, A.D. 100-A.D. 250, as defined by Valdez (1994 ), is char ­acterized by Blossom Bank ceramics with a few scattered Floral Park (Barton Ramie) Protoclassic materials. In this late facet of the Late Preclassic, mass production of stone tools continued, and new construction episodes are documented throughout the site. These workshops may have continued into the Early Classic although earlier assessments iden­tified a manufacturing hiatus at that time (Hester and Shafer 1989). Growing ideological complex­ity at Colha is suggested with a vast array of exotic materials found in termination and dedicatory caches and burials (Anthony 1987; Buttles 1992; Potter 1992; Sullivan 1991). 
Previous Obsidian Studies at Colha 
Geologic sources identified by preliminary trace element studies at Colha indicated changing pro­curement patterns spanning the entire occupation of the site (Dreiss 1988; Hester and Michel 1980). These findings prompted investigation of the rela­tionship between the obsidian distribution at Co Iha and broader regional trends (Dreiss 1989). Our obsidian distribution models for the Belize periph­ery (Dreiss and Brown 1989) were influenced by the work of Hammond (1972, 1976), by Nelson's

( 1985) synthesis of then-current trace element data from the Maya Lowlands, and, more recently, by an updated version of Nelson's original model (Nel­son and Clark 1998). 
A 1993 neutron activation analysis of 199 obsid­ian prismatic blades from Late Classic contexts provided important data on functional, chronolog­ical, and status differences during that period at Colha (Dreiss et al. 1993). Surprisingly, obsidian from Ixtepeque, not a significant Classic period source in the smaller sample size of the earlier analyses (Dreiss 1989), proved to be slightly more abundant than material from the El Chayal source. 
Because the 1993 findings suggested that it was possible to identify socioeconomic trends from the distribution of obsidian, we decided to undertake chemical analysis of a larger sample of specimens from Preclassic deposits at Colha. We hoped that investigations of the chronological and contextual distribution of obsidian during this early period would lead to a better understanding of the emer­gence of obsidian trade at Colha and within the region, and the possible relationship of that trade to sociopolitical developments in the lowland Maya region as a whole. 
Obsidian from Preclassic 
Operations at Colha 

Our original strategy was to source the entire Pre­classic sample currently available from Colha, but due to poor provenience for a few specimens and the miniscule size of others, only 82 specimens out of 126 were analyzed (22 samples had been previ­ously sourced [Dreiss 1988]). The 148-piece total of Preclassic obsidian reflects the relatively small Preclassic occupation at the site, as well as the lim­ited number of excavated proveniences containing obsidian. The samples discussed here came from a complex series of stratified Preclassic deposits (in many cases with Classic and Postclassic deposits in the upper levels) identified in 33 different sub­operations within nine operations located in the "2000 sector" of the site as shown in Figure 2. The operations which yielded Preclassic obsidian are briefly summarized below. 
Operation 2001 ( 1 San Martin Jilotepeque specimen, 1 from El Chaya!). 
This operation sampled a Preclassic house mound with an adjoining lithic workshop. The obsidian was recovered from a residential area with Late Pre­classic ceramics and lithic debitage (Shafer 1979). 
Operation 2002 ( 4 Ixtepeque specimens). 
Operation 2002 tested a Late Preclassic lithic work­shop and plazuela complex 50 m north of Opera­tion 2003 (Escobedo 1979). Chicane! ceramics are associated with the vast amount of lithic debitage recovered from Suboperation 1. 
Operation 2003 (2 El Chaya! specimens, 10 
from lxtepeque ). 
Investigations at Operation 2003, located in the southern part of the monumental center, exposed a series of superimposed Late Preclassic through Early Postclassic structures and features. A Late Preclassic stepped pyramid with a flat-top platform revealed a series of layers of construction fill, liv­ing surfaces, and other architectural features. Chi­cane! complex ceramics with a trace of Mamom were recovered (Day and Laurens 1980; Eaton 1979). 
Operation 2006 (2 Ixtepeque specimens). 
Operation 2006, 250 m west of Operation 2001, sampled a Late Preclassic chert workshop on an artificial terrace adjacent to a plazuela group south­west of the main ceremonial center. Beneath the workshop midden with Chicanel complex ceram­ics are two limestone floor layers, and beneath these a midden with Mamom pottery (Roemer 1979; Shafer 1979). 
Operation 2011 (8 San Martin Jilotepeque specimens, 2from El Chaya!). 
This operation within the main plaza revealed superimposed Middle and Late Preclassic domes­tic middens and house remnants, associated with Early Chicane! complex ceramics, found beneath Late Classic plaza flooring. Underlying the Late Preclassic structures and middens is a 50-cm-deep Middle Preclassic midden (Eaton 1980b). 
Operation 2012(4 El Chaya! specimens, 4 from Ixtepeque ). 
Colha's ceremonial hub, investigated in Operation 2012, is a stepped pyramid and platform located on the western edge of the monumental center (Pot­ter 1982, 1992 ). The structure was utilized from the

Middle Preclassic through the Late Classic with a trace of Postcla<>sic ceramic censer fragments found on top of the pyramid. Ritual and ceremonial activ­ity is implied by the use of the pyramid and plat­form as an extensive, layered mortuary area. A . Middle Preclassic midden with Bolay complex, Chicago Orange, Ramgoat, and Tiger Buff ceram­ics was found beneath numerous layers of Late Preclassic superimposed plaster floors. The Late Preclassic burials, caches, deposits and architec­tural features are associated with Chicane! complex pottery. 
Operation 2024 (2 San Martin Jilotepeque 
specimens, I from Ixtepeque ). 
This operation featured two separate, mounded chert workshop deposits sharing a raised landform near an aguada or low-lying marshy area. Lithic affiliation and diagnostic sherds (Chicane! with a trace of Mamom) date Suboperation 11-3 to the Late Preclassic period (Roemer 1982). As with sev­eral other Preclassic workshops, these were located away from residences rather than directly adjacent to the house mounds as in later periods (King 2000; Santone 1997). 
Operation 203 I (I Source X specimen, 23 from 
San Martin Jilotepeque, 29 from El Chaya!, 2 
from lxtepeque ). 
Operation 2031 uncovered part of a large enclosed plaza area within the monumental center. The unit consisted of stratified midden deposits dating from the early Middle Preclassic through the Terminal Preclassic (Anthony 1987; Anthony and Black 1994; Sullivan 1991 ). This primary Preclassic set­tlement, beneath a partially preserved Late Classic plaza floor, consisted of a complex series of floors, structures, and domestic middens. Basal deposits 
,associated with Bolay complex ceramics were overlain by Chicane! complex domestic and archi­tectural features. More than half ( 5 3 percent) of the Preclassic obsidian was recovered from this oper­
ation. 
Operation 2050 (I San Martin Jilotepeque 
specimen, 5 from El Chaya!, 2 from Ixtepeque ). 
Operation 2050 sampled a midden situated in the main plaza north of Operations 2031 and 2011. Obsidian was collected from Middle and Terminal Preclassic deposits. 
X-Ray Fluorescence Analysis and Results 
Eighty-two obsidian samples from Preclassic con­texts at Colha were analyzed by one of us (REH) using energy dispersive x-ray fluorescence (EDXRF) spectrometry.1 In two previous analyses, 19 samples were sourced by XRF at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory (LBL; see Dreiss 1988:120-123) and three others were analyzed at MOHLAB (Michels Obsidian Hydration Lab). Details of the EDXRF technique employed here have been published elsewhere (e.g. Hughes 1988, 1994). We chose to employ EDXRF because this technique is rapid, completely nondestructive, and is capable of generating quantitative composition data. Table 1 compares results of analyses of the same sample between the EDXRF system used here and instrumental neutron activation analysis (see also Hughes 1988:Table II). The remarkably close agreement allowed us to be quite confident that the concentration values generated nonde­structively for artifacts by EDXRF would be directly comparable to published values for Mesoamerican geologic obsidians (e.g. Asaro et al. 1978; Cobean et al. 1991; Glascock 2002; Glas­cock and Cobean 2002; Stross et al. 1976, 1983). Further comparisons and data (e.g., Fe/Mn ratios; see Figure 3) were generated using in-house geo­logic Mesoamerican obsidian samples. 
EDXRF data show that four obsidian sources (i.e., chemical types; see Hughes 1998:104) were used at Colha during the Preclassic period. These artifact-to-source attributions are most clearly con­veyed using bivariate plots of Zr vs. Rb (Figure 4) and Zr vs. Sr concentration (Figure 5). Ti, Mn, and total iron concentrations also provide separation between otherwise similar geologic obsidians, and simple Fe/Mn ratios also discriminate among the three principal source types (El Chaya!, lxtepeque, and San Martin Jilotepeque) identified in this Colha sample. We did not attempt finer scale partitioning of glasses within the San Martin Jilotepeque source area as Braswell and Glascock ( 1998) recently have done. 
Of 104 Preclassic obsidian samples analyzed, 41 percent (n = 42) match the trace and minor ele­ment signature of El Chaya!, 34 percent (n = 35) derive from obsidians of the San Martin Jilote­peque source area, and 25 percent (n = 26) were fashioned from Ixtepeque obsidian. The fourth
