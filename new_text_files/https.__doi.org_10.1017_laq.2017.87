L
ittle is known of the prehistoric environ­ment of northwestern Guyana as it relates to the unique shell mound culture of the area. Although we presume a degree of constancy in Holocene contexts, few area studies address environmental change (Van der Hammen 1982; 
Van der Hammen and Wijmstra 1964). 
Williams 
(2003) 
argues 
that 
environmental 
conditions 
of 
the Late Pleistocene/Early Holocene resulted in instability, leading to diet breadth shifts. To date, no studies have attempted to assess the diet breadth shifts of hunter-gatherers using the shell­.sh resources of the Guyana littoral. This study uses the results of isotopic analyses of human and other faunal remains from shell mounds to assess environmental changes in northwestern Guyana during the Archaic period. Owing to highly degraded samples that failed to produce suf.cient levels of collagen for nitrogen analysis, we used stable carbon d13C and oxygen d18O isotope compositions data to assess the degree of dietary constancy during the past several thousand years as a proxy for determining the likelihood of there being any signi.cant changes in the Archaic/Holocene environment that would have in.uenced the use of shell.sh resources in the northwest.

and as places for burials. The landscape is cov­ered by primary, secondary, and marsh forests. Archaeological discoveries of mounds within this area have reported assemblages of chipped and groundstone artifacts that form the basis of 
Evans 
and 
Meggers’ 
(1960) 
description 
of 
the so-called Alaka phase, which they originally dated between 1950 and 1450 BP. Radiocarbon dates of a number of shell midden deposits nevertheless indicate pre-ceramic occupations as early as ca. 7500 BP (Plew and Daggers 2016). 
Some mounds, including Barabina (Williams 1981) 
and 
Kabakaburi 
(Plew 
et 
al. 
2007), 
contain 
early ceramic remains—the former being the focus of a debate regarding the earliest presence of pottery in northwestern Guyana (Roosevelt 1997; 
Williams 
1996). 
Although 
shell 
mounds 
are not found in adjacent Suriname and French Guiana, they are common in the south Caribbean, where beginning around 6000 BP the Banwari Trace and El Conchero shell midden occupations represent a regional Archaic pattern similar to that of Alaka phase sites but different in assem­blage variation (Boomert 2000:54–56). 
In 
gen­
eral, Banwary Trace assemblages contain many more specialized tools. To the east, at Taperinha and Pedra Pintada, Mina phase pottery has been dated at 7090 BP and 7580 BP, respectively. Early and Middle Holocene Age non-ceramic­bearing shell mounds have recently been iden­ti.ed in lowland Bolivia (Lombardo et al. 2013). 

The Holocene shell deposits examined in this study are located on the coastal plain within the Northwestern district of Guyana. The area is believed to have been occupied by the prehistoric Warrau people, who exploited marine resources and left behind an extensive shell midden com­plex with ages ranging between 7500 BP and 260 BP. The coastal littoral is characterized by vast rivers, creeks and tributaries, swamps and marsh forests. Coastal pollen data analysis shows that the vegetation of the period consisted predomi­nantly of mangroves, palms, and open grass vege­tation (Van der Hammen 1982). 
Williams 
(2003) argues that .uctuating environmental condi­tions of the Late Pleistocene-Early Holocene resulted in periods of instability and shifting resource emphases. Different species associated with marine and brackish waters were exploited with sea level rises that occurred between 7200 and 6000 BP. Additional diet breadth shifts were associated with the emergence of mangrove swamps between 6000 and 4000 BP. Although Early Holocene sea levels would have varied due to differences in precipitation and temperature, Van der 
Hammen 
(1963) 
suggests that Late Alleröd interstadial sea levels rose as much as 36 m above the modern land surface in the Demerara River 
Valley. 
Rull 
(1999) 
nonetheless 
suggests 
that post-glacial/Holocene sea levels vary greatly from one location to another. It appears that sea level oscillations during the past 6,000 years may have varied little more than 3 m in many locations (Fairbridge 1976). 
In 
this 
regard, 
Early 
Holocene sea levels along the Guyana coast most probably varied according to local terrain fea­tures, which in turn would have in.uenced settle­ment and resource availability. Acknowledging these .uctuations and their in.uence upon local patterns, 
Plew 
(2010:35) 
argues 
that 
periods 
of 
environmental change should not be seen as re.ecting instability but rather as events resulting in an ever-increasing range of potential adaptive responses. 
The stratigraphy of shell mounds demon­strates alternating layers of shell refuse from different species of mollusks, including the small striped snail, clams, and oysters; and crab and .sh remains, intermixed with clayey lateritic soil. The remains of peccary, agouti, turtle, large birds, and cayman have also been reported (Plew 2016; 
Plew and Daggers 2016; 
Williams 
2003). 
Subsis­
tence appears to have relied heavily upon mollusk exploitation associated with relatively brackish environs (Jansma 1981; 
Williams 
1981:16, 
30– 
32). 
Williams’s 
(1981, 
2003) 
excavations 
have 
produced evidence of features including hearths, postmolds, and several storage pits measuring 30–40 cm in diameter and extending to 40–50 cm in depth. Similar features have also been noted at Kabakaburi (Plew et al. 2007) 
and 
Siriki (Plew and Daggers 2016; 
Plew 
et al. 2012). 

Radiocarbon dates have been obtained for nine shell mounds. The dates establish a general temporal range of between 7500 BP and 2600 BP—the more recent dates from the upper lev­els of Hosororo Creek (2660 ± 45 BP, SI-6636, Williams 2003)

(7545 BP, Beta-449110) together with the earliest ones occurring at Barabina, where a radiocarbon date of 6885 ± 85 BP has been reported. An additional early date was obtained from carbon collected from the Wyva Creek shell mound near the Barima River. Wyva Creek returned a conventional radiocarbon age of 6340 ± 50 BP (Beta-264970, Plew and Willson 2009). 
A 
recently obtained date for Little Kaniballi dates its occupation to 6340 ± 30 BP (7320-7245 cal BP; Beta-449111; Daggers and Plew 2017). 
Other Middle Holocene dates in the range of 5965 ± 50 BP (Barabina) to 5710 ± 80 BP (Kori­abo) are not common, suggesting that there may be a more limited shell mound occupation in this time frame, although the sample size is too small to provide a level of con.dence. In contrast, some mounds were occupied between c. 4000 and c. 2600 BP. The most recent dates are from Hobodiah at 139 ± 60 (Beta-109244) and Siriki at 270 ± 30 BP. 



Isotope Analyses as a Source of Assessing 
Dietary and Environmental Change 

Bone and tooth enamel are composed of hydrox­yapatite (Ca5 (PO4)3OH) with a carbonate (CO3) substitution in either the PO4 and OH sites (Elliot 2002). 
In 
this 
study, 
we analyzed the (CO3) component in human bone and tooth enamel samples for d13C and d18O values. The carbon isotopic compositions of d13C of mammalian bones and teeth record dietary d13C values, with a .xed fractionation factor of ~13‰ in primates (Cerling et al. 2004; 
Sandberg 
et 
al. 
2012). 
In 
enamel, 
there 
is 
limited 
fractionation 
in d13C composition with increasing trophic level (i.e., through carnivores and omnivores higher in the food chain, see Lee-Thorp and Sponheimer [2006]). 
Therefore, 
the 
d13C of animal tissue preserves the d13C value of the vegetation at the base of the food chain (Janssen et al. 2016). 
The 
majority of global vegetation (>90%) uses the C3 photosynthetic pathway, whereas the remainder is split between the C4 and CAM (Crassulacean acid metabolism) pathways—both adaptations to hot, arid environments through increased water use ef.ciency and reduced photorespira­tion (Ehleringer and Monson 1993; 
Ehleringer 
et al. 1992; 
Kohn 
2010). 
C3 plants have a mean d13C value of -27‰ (range -22‰ to -35‰; Kohn 2010), 
whereas 
C4 plants have a mean d13C value of -13‰ (range -9‰ to -19‰). CAM plants have a range of value but typically fall closer to the C4 range; nevertheless, CAM plants (e.g., succulents, orchids) rarely contribute to human diets and therefore are not considered as a food source in this study. The d13C values of C3 plants can be further in.uenced by environmental factors; water stress results in higher d13C values, and a closed canopy environment shifts d13C to very low values (Janssen et al. 2016; 
Kohn 
2010; 
Van 
der 
Merwe 
and 
Medina 
1991). 
More 
positive d13C values in vegetation and animal tissues may indicate a habitat with more open vegetation. Thus, differences in the d13C value recorded in animal bone and tooth enamel allow detection of changing vegetation patterns (C3 vs C4 plants; closed vs. open canopy structure) that can be interpreted as paleodietary and pale­oenvironmental proxies in archeological speci­mens. Furthermore, paleoclimate inferences can be made by applying a mean annual precipitation model to d13C values (Kohn 2010); 
nevertheless, 
these calculations have mainly been done on herbivore tooth specimens—omnivory and any component of arti.cial irrigation incorporated into the dietary d13C would potentially under­mine model output. It remains important to note that fossil fuel combustion since the late 19th century has decreased the d13C value of atmospheric CO2 by ~ 1.5‰ (Indermühle et al. 1999). 

The oxygen isotope composition of mam­malian tooth enamel and bone hydroxyapatite carbonate is directly linked to the d18O values of body water, re.ecting food and drinking water, which are in turn a complex function of habitat, climate, and diet (Clementz and Koch 2001; 
Janssen 
et 
al. 
2016; 
Kohn 
et 
al. 
1996; 
Lüdecke et al. 2016). 
The 
d18O value of rainwater decreases with increasing distance from moisture source, increasing altitude, decreasing tempera­ture, and intensity of precipitation (Dansgaard 1964). 
In 
arid 
environments, 
surface 
waters 
and 
leaf water d18O values increase with evaporation (Gon.antini et al. 1965), 
and 
under 
similar 
con­
ditions, C4 plants have higher d18O values than C3 vegetation (Helliker and Ehleringer 2000; 
Sternberg 1989).

d18O values represent the interplay of environ­mental parameters and diet composition in.u­ence on body water composition. For mammals, there is a constant offset (~26‰) between the d18O of body water and the CO3 component of bioapatite (Bryant et al. 1996; 
Kohn 
and 
Cerling 
2002; 
Lüdecke 
et 
al. 
2016). 



Methods 
Geographical and dietary baseline data for this project used both animal proxies and contem­porary plant materials. Oxygen and carbon sta­ble isotope compositions were collected from tooth enamel and bone samples from seven sites. Baseline data were collected for Barabina, Kabakaburi, Piraka, and Waramuri mounds from the excavations of Denis Williams during the 1980s, and from more recent samples from the excavations of Little Kaniballi (Daggers 2017), 
Siriki (Plew et al. 2012) 
and Wyva Creek (Plew and Wilson 2009). 
All 
collections 
were stored at the Walter Roth Museum of Anthropology. 
Sur.cial material was removed manually from specimens with a carbide burr followed by an ethanol rinse prior to sampling. Bioa­patite samples were then hand-milled using a Dremel® rotary tool equipped with a 0.5-mm carbide dental drill bit. Approximately 8 mg of enamel or bone powder were pretreated using the approach 
of 
Koch 
et 
al. 
(1997). 
Residual 
organics 
were oxidized overnight using 30% hydrogen peroxide. Twelve hours later, the hydrogen per­oxide was decanted, and powders were rinsed twice with deionized water. Powders were then treated with a 1.0 M Ca-acetate/acetic acid buffer overnight to remove labile carbonates. Following this pretreatment procedure, samples were rinsed three times with deionized water and dried in a vacuum oven at 40 °C. 
The CO3 component of powdered enamel and bone samples was analyzed by digestion in phosphoric acid using a Thermo Delta V Plus continuous-.ow isotope ratio mass spectrometer coupled with a Thermo GasBench II. All car­bonate isotopic compositions were standardized to Pee Dee Belemnite (PDB), using NBS-18 and NBS-19 calcite standards; oxygen isotopic com­positions were then normalized to Vienna Stan­dard Mean Ocean Water (VSMOW). Analytical reproducibility for the dataset was ± 0.20‰ and ± 0.25‰ for d13C and d18O respectively, based on NBS 18 and 19 (n = 14). All isotope data are reported in standard delta (d) notation. Statistical analyses were completed using R -v. 
3.3.2. One-way ANOVA was used to compare pooled bone and tooth data between localities. Post hoc students’ T-tests corrected for multiple comparisons isolated signi.cant differences at the p< 0.05 level. 


Sample Selection 
Differences in the quantity and condition of bone from the mound sites served to de.ne sample size. During the selection process, bones displaying evidence of pathologies were avoided (Olsen et al. 2014). 
Eighty-one 
samples 
of 
human 
bone and teeth were analyzed in this study, although four lacked exact stratigraphic prove­nance 
(Table 
1). 
Owing 
to 
considerable 
differ­
ences in past recovery processes, many collec­tions are incomplete. Given this, we used remains that were available from early excavations. In the case of Barabina, we used rib fragments that had been retained in the collection. In other assemblages, long bone fragments were sampled. A signi.cant percent of the collections analyzed was degraded, which resulted in poor collagen preservation. As a result, we were not able to conduct nitrogen analysis. Only a few samples were taken from stratigraphic units that had been radiocarbon dated. In this regard, we were cognizant of the problem of sampling elements from the same individuals. Although we cannot say with certainty that all samples come from separate individuals, we believe that most are. For better control of this problem, we relied on detailed descriptions of stratigraphic positioning of skeletal remains (Williams 1981) 
and 
distinct 
locations of burials within mounds (Plew et al. 2012). 
The 
samples 
document 
an 
age 
range 
from 
infants 
to 
30 
years 
of 
age 
(Figure 
2). 

In addition to bone and teeth samples from the midden sites, contemporary samples (C3, C4 and cam, n = 27) were collected for d13C analysis. Carbon isotope compositions were used as a primary proxy of diet and of the Archaic shell mound populations, whereas oxygen

of 
Guehl 
and 
colleagues 
(1998) 
for 
regional 
vegetation 
in 
Guyana 
(Figure

A 
diet correction, incorporating the fractionation from diet to bioapatite, and an offset to account for modern decreases in atmospheric d13C(13‰ 
+ 1.5‰), were applied to the plant d13C com­positions 
(Table 
3). 
Diet-corrected 
d13C values based on the local plant isotopic compositions are consistent with the bone and tooth enamel sample compositions shown, supporting the conclusion that the diet of the populations sampled was dominated by C3 vegetation (Guehl et al. 1998; 
Supplemental Table 1). 
Locations with 14C dates are shown by age in Figure 
4. 
The 
uniformity 
over 
time 
and 
between 
locations in bone and tooth enamel d18O compo­sitions suggests that isotopically similar drinking water sources were accessed at all sites, and that other variables known to in.uence oxygen isotopic compositions in surface water (precipi­tation sources, temperature, evaporative enrich­ment) were similar across all sites through time. The time span represented by the majority of the dated material from these locations falls within a period referred to as the Holocene climatic optimum (HCO), which is characterized by a climatic warming spanning 8000–5000 years BP. Temperature increases of up to 4°Catthe poles and decreases to 1°C at the equator have been inferred from ice-core datasets and global climate models (Dahl-Jensen et al. 1998; 
Gagan 
et al. 1998; 
Koshkarova 
and 
Koshkarov 
2004; 
Mayle et al. 2004). 
This 
warm 
period 
may 
have 
in.uenced the carbon isotopic values recorded in bone and tooth enamel. 
Mayle 
and 
others 
(2004) 
extend 
the 
period 
of warming in Amazonia to 8000–3600 years BP, spanning the full chronology potentially represented by the present study. Areas of the northern Amazon may have had reduced precip­itation during this time period, leading to shifts toward more drought-tolerant dry forest taxa and savannahs in ecotonal areas (Mayle et al. 2004). 
The Barabina site is the recent dated location falling at the end of the HCO. It had signi.cantly higher d13C compositions in comparison with the older Little Kaniballi, Siriki, and Piraka sites. The 1–2‰ increase in d13C values at Barabina does not seem signi.cant enough to represent a shift toward C4 diet inputs; it may be the result of a drier environment under water stress after prolonged warming. 
In this regard, d18O fails to identify climate change unless all factors are known, but it is useful in re.ecting the state of climate and surface temperature. Pooled bone and teeth data shown in Figure 
5 
show no statistical differences (ANOVA, p= 0.2274). 
Fricke 
and 
others 
(1995) 
posit that the d18O composition of the body water is a re.ection of the water consumed, as a result of which climate and surface water temperature can be deduced. The d18O samples from Barabina suggest variations in temper­atures that may indicate intense rainfall and warming during this period. A warmer trend is evident in samples for the early Holocene, including Little Kaniballi, Wyva, Piraka, and Siriki 
(Figure 
5). 




Diet Breadth 
The apatite-collagen model suggests that pop­ulations in the Northwest became increasingly reliant on C3-based resources and C3-fed fauna. In

regard,

resources, including those of niche resources, speci.cally starchy plants (Plew et al. 2012). 
This is further supported by the appearance of mangrove fringes and forest along the coast during the Holocene, which provided favorable habitat for both marine resources and terrestrial fauna (Van der Hammen and Wijmstra 1964). 
The d13C values are consistent with an open landscape such as palm forest in the Amazon region. The population who are believed to be small, highly mobile groups would have adopted a coastal hunter-gatherer strategy, in which res­idential base camps were established with the seasonal use of shell midden sites, which to an 
extent 
supports 
William’s 
(2003) 
arguments 
regarding shifting resource use. 
The d13C values of the sediments transported and accumulated on four sites—Wyva, Siriki, Piraka, and Barabina— show varying levels of depletion and enrichment by depth and age. These values, which range between -24.3 and 
27.3 ‰ (Figure 
6), 
suggest 
that 
sediments 
moved 

to these locations were taken from an environ­ment dominated by C3 plants. This indicates the depletion of d13C approaching the Mid-Holocene; within our data set this is evident at Siriki 5490 ± 30 BP and at the Barabina site 4470 ± 30 BP. This is further supported by Hammond 
and 
colleagues’

study 
of

charcoal in the wet tropical forest of Guyana, where data indicates a series of forest .res during the Holocene with d13C values ranging between -29.4 and -25.4 ‰; this suggests charcoal forma­tion from C3 plants, typifying modern tropical forest habitat. 
The d13C range of the human samples, while implying the consumption of C3 plants, also indicates that these populations used resources from an open canopy environment. This is sup­ported

The data suggest a period of greater warming in the early Holocene, re.ected in the d18O values from Piraka range of 28–26 ‰, the Wyva sample range between 26–27 ‰, and the Siriki sample range 26–28 ‰, though d18O is observed at Little Kanaballi, and a steady depletion in d18O as seen at Barabina in the Mid-Holocene. This may indicate climate .uctuation and possible stabilization resulting in more favorable temperatures. 


Conclusion 
This study has used the results of isotopic analyses of human and other faunal remains to assess environmental changes in northwestern Guyana during the Early to Late Archaic period. Using d13C and d18O data, we have demonstrated some degree of constancy in the availability of C3 plants during the past several thousand years, though we note an increasing reliance on such plants beginning in the Early Holocene. We also document warming intervals during the Early Holocene (Early Archaic), which appear to correlate with dry periods known elsewhere in the central Amazon during this period. Although our data support long-term perpetuation of what may be thought of as relatively modern forest conditions, we conclude that in at least the Early Holocene there may have been more open canopy—a condition that may well have seen prehistoric peoples moving to a range of season­ally available resources. In sum, we believe that over time, what we know as the modern environ­ment may have remained relatively unchanged, with the minor exception of drying conditions of the Early Holocene, which may have seen increased residential mobility.
