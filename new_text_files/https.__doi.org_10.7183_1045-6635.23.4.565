GEOMETRIC EARTHWORKS IN THE STATE OF ACRE, BRAZIL: 
EXCAVATIONS AT THE FAZENDA ATLANTICA AND QUINAUA SITES 

Sanna Saunaluoma 
Geometric earthworks located in the interfluvial zone of the Upper Purus and Madeira river tributaries in the southwest­ern Amazon are formed by ditches of varying shapes and sizes along with contiguous exterior embankments and roads ter­raced with low backfill banks. The earthworks in the Brazilian state of Acre were used from 1200 B .C. to the fourteenth century A.D., indicating a continuous, collective cultural institution, a generalized regional phenomenon characterized by local variants and alterations and probably not exclusively restricted to a specified ethnic group. The carefully planned position of the earthworks in the landscape and the recurring geometric forms represented in this earthwork architecture suggest functions that were part of a tradition of shared ideology related to rituals and/or the sociopolitical activities of ancient Amazonian peoples. Recent archaeological fieldwork on two composite earthwork sites, Fazenda Atldntica and Quinaud, situated in the core location of the geometric earthworks, provides further evidence for the predominantly cere­monial use of these constructions.

Rfo Madeira en el suroeste de la Amazonia estdn formadas par zanjas de formas y tamaiios diver sos junta con terraplenes exteriores y caminos con bajos bancales de relleno. Las obras de tierra en el estado brasileiio de Acrefueron utilizadas a partir de 1200 a.C. hasta el sif(lo catorce A.D., lo qe indica una instituci6n cultural colectiva, unfen6meno generalizado regional caracterizado por las variantes locales y probablemente no exclusivamente restringido a un grupo etnico especifico. La ubicaci6n cuidadosa­mente planificada de las obras de tierra en el paisaje y [asformas geometricas recurrentes representadas en esta arquitectura de construcciones de tierra sugieren funciones que formaban parte de una tradici6n ideol6gica compartida relacionada con rituales ylo las actividades sociopolfticas llevadas a cabo par las poblaciones prehist6ricas amaz6nicas. Las investigaciones arqueol6gicas realizadas recientemente en Los sitios de Fazenda Atldntica y Quinaud, compuestos de obras de tierra circu­lares y cuadradas y situados en la area central de las estructuras geometricas de tierra, proporcionan mas evidencia para el uso predominantemente ceremonial de estas construcciones. 
eometric earthworks in the Brazilian state Gof Acre have recently aroused the curios­ity of scholars studying the Amazonian past. These monumental earthwork complexes are located in the interfluvial zone of the Upper Purus and Madeira river tributaries in the southwestern Amazon and are formed by ditches of different geo­metric shapes and varying sizes in association with contiguous exterior embankments (Dias 2006; Plirssinen et al. 2003; Plirssinen et al. 2009; Saunalu­oma and Schaan 2012; Schaan et al. 2010; Schaan et al. 2012). The individual enclosures vary in diam­eter from dozens of meters to almost 400 m. The best-preserved ditches are still several meters deep .1 In most cases, ancient roads terraced with low back­
fill banks function as entrances to the enclosures and connect the distinct geometric structures. Ondemar Dias carried out the first archaeological studies and investigations on earthwork sites in Acre under the auspices of the Programa Nacional de Pesquisas Arqueol6gicas na Bacia Amaz6nica project in the late 1970s .2 Since then, ca. 300 individual geomet­ric earthworks have been registered in eastern Acre, the westernmost division of the state of Rond6nia, and the southern part of the state of Amazonas (Schaan et al. 2010). Comparable earthworks have also been recorded in the Bolivian Amazon in the departments of Pando and Beni (Arellano 2002; Arnold and Prettol 1988; Erickson 2010; Priimers et al. 2006; Saunaluoma 2010; Walker 2008a).

of the Geoglifos da Amazonia Ocidental project). 
The earthworks were used in Acre for a sur­prisingly long time, from 1200 B.C. to the four­teenth century AD. (Dias 2006; Saunaluoma and Schaan 2012; Schaan et al. 2012; see also the dates discussed below), suggesting a continuous, col­lective regional tradition. Examples of similar pre­columbian regionality are seen in the central Llanos de Mojos of the Bolivian Amazon, where exten­sive raised fields, canals, and ditches are linked to adjacent mound and forest island settlement sites by the wide-ranging routes of causeways (Denevan 1966; Erickson 2001, 2006, 2010; Lombardo and Priimers 2010; Walker 2008b), and in the Upper Xingu region, where well-designed road networks connect clusters of late precolonial plaza villages across the terrain (Heckenberger 2005; Hecken­berger et al. 2008). The regionally connected soci­eties that once occupied these monumental domesticated landscapes were characterized by cul­tural diversity and dynamism, advanced political organization, and ritual and elite exchange (Heck­enberger and Neves 2009). 
The recent archaeological data presented here concern two composite earthwork sites situated in the core area of the Acrean geometric earthworks and provide further evidence of the predominantly ceremonial use of these constructions. The struc­tural features and layout of the sites and the distri­bution and characteristics of the cultural deposit5 within the enclosed areas point more toward thei1 initial function as centers of public ritual and polit­ical affairs than toward permanent residential 01 economic utilization. 
The Fazenda Atlantica and Quinaua Sites 

In recent decades, drastic alterations in the Acrean landscape have transformed the former terrafirml rain forest ecozone into open grasslands for cattle ranching and agriculture in many parts of the state Paradoxically, the current devastation of the fores1 has contributed to the study of ancient Amazonian societies. The earthworks have become more exposed in deforested areas, particularly when seen 
. from the air. Aerial photographs and satellite images have become effective tools for discover­ing and registering earthwork sites in Acre (Ranzi et al. 2007; Schaan et al. 2010). The earthworks are

situated on the terra firme plateaus of the Acre, Iquiri, andAbuna rivers, at approximately 180-230 m as! (Schaan et al. 20 10) near rivulets. The dis­tance between the separate earthwork sites varies, but generally other sites are located within a radius of 2-10 km. 
The investigated sites Fazenda AtJantica (I0°04'42"S 67°34'27"W) and Quinaua (I 0°03'24"S 67°37'0 l ''W) are situated 5 km apart in the municipality of Senador Guiomard some 35 km to the southeast of the city of Rio Branco, on nonflooded ground (ca. 200 m as!) of the drainage divide of the Acre and Iquiri rivers (Figure I). The distance to the floodplain of the Acre River is ca. 15 km. The interfluvial plateau, pertaining to the western sedimentary upland (Sombroek 2000:Fig­ure I), which varies from undulating to flat and is marked by a web of numerous small headwater streams, represents the main landscape element in the research area. The soils in the region are mostly clayey tropical acrisols, with occasional layers of ferruginous laterite (Oliveira and Noquiera Alvarenga I 985). In Acre, the mean annual tem­perature is 24°C, and the mean annual rainfall is 2,100 mm, with a drier season extending from June to September (Teixeira 2008:70-73). 
In 2007 mapping and measuring of the earth­works were conducted on-site using total station documentation. 3 During the fieldwork period in 2008 ceramic and radiocarbon samples were col­lected from trial excavations carried out at the sites. 
Fazenda Atlantica 
The most prominent earthwork of the Fazenda At!antica site (Figure 2A) is a 250-x-250-m square-shaped ditch with shallow semicircular ditches inscribed within the western and eastern comers. Ditch construction backfill forms the 50-cm-high external embankment of the square. Bulldozing has partially altered the northern segment of the earthwork, but the preserved part of the ditch is cur­rently approximately 3 m deep and 20 m wide. An eroded, 40-cm-high, roughly quadrangular embankment is located in the middle of the square­shaped ditched enclosure. A small artificial mound structure, 1.2 m high, 15 m in diameter, and attached to the internal embankment structure, is situated adjacent to the eastern semicircular ditch. A grid of auger units 50 cm in depth and 3 m apart from one other confirmed that the mound is formed by dark brown cultural soil limited to an area cov­ering 15 x 15 m and therefore making up a sepa­rate feature. The main entrance of the earthwork, defined by a 100-m-wide road, is located on the southeast part of the square-shaped ditch. Minor roads, delineated by 40-to 50-cm-high earthen walls, begin at the northeast and southwest sides of the square-shaped ditch and disappear into the terrain approximately 100 m from the ditch. On the northwest side, two simple embankments parallel to the ditch in a northeast-southwest direction join and form a road leading to a circular ditch situated 150 m to the northwest of the square-shaped ditch. The circular ditch has a diameter of 125 m, its depth is approximately I m, and its width is 12 m. A 70­cm-high embankment surrounds the exterior of the circle (Figure 3). 
In 2007, a test unit of 1 x 2 m was excavated in a north-south direction on the crest of the external embankment on the southwest side of the square-

shaped earthwork. Some scattered fragments of undecorated ceramics, charcoal, and carbonized palm seeds were found at a depth of 10-80 cm (Table 1), but the soil did not have any prominent coloring or stratigraphy. A small, simple, polished stone axe was collected from the outer slope of the ditch near the excavation. 
In 2008, 10 l-x-1-m test units were excavated to artificial 10-cm levels. Units 1 and 2, placed inside the area marked by the semicircular ditch in the eastern comer of the earthwork, and Unit 3, roughly in the center of the square-shaped ditch inside the quadrangular embankment, revealed hardly any signs of cultural activities. Unit 4 was excavated near the western semicircular ditch on top of the embankment inside the square. A con­centration of ceramics was found at the 10-40 cm level. The cultural layer also contained fragments of charcoal and burned clay. In spite of the con­siderable amount of archaeological material, the soil had the reddish tone typical of tropical latosols. 
Unit 5 was placed on the small mound structure within the square-shaped ditch (Figure 4). Pottery, including carefully decorated sherds, was found in the dark brown soil immediately under the humus layer. Furthermore, the structure of the soil was looser, and its texture was sandier, than in other areas of the site. Only the 10-20 cm level had a minor quantity and quality of ceramics; all of the other levels, until a depth of 130 cm, yielded a con­siderable amount of sherds. The major accumula­tion of pottery (1,060 sherds, 6.0 kg) was found in the 70-120 cm levels. The dark brown soil in these levels was mixed with charcoal. The 110-120 cm level revealed a feature that was approximately 20 x 60 cm in size and 2 cm thick (Figure 5). This fea­ture was composed of a vessel broken in situ, frag­ments of charcoal and burned clay, chunks of calcium carbonate (1.1 kg), and tiny fragments of unburned bone.4 A clayey, reddish, culturally ster­ile soil was reached at a depth of 140 cm. 
Units 6-8 were excavated adjacent to the cir­cular ditch. Unit 6, placed inside the circle, sug­gested an extremely compact soil without any cultural remains. Unit 7 was placed on the crest of the external embankment on the northwest side of the earthwork. This unit exhibited a compacted soil mixed with fragments of ferruginous laterite and

occasional accumulations of eroded potsherds. Unit 8, excavated at the base of the circular ditch, had a recent fire layer in the 10-20 cm level but did not contain any archaeological material. 
Unit 9, placed in the juncture of the embank­ments on the northwest side of the square-shaped ditch, yielded only a handful of potsherds. Unit 10 was excavated at the beginning of the road struc­ture on the northeast side of the square-shaped ditch, on the crest of the elevated embankment some 30 m from the ditch.

Quinaua 
The Quinaua earthwork site consists of a slightly inclined square-shaped ditch and a small circular ditch situated some 250 m to the south (Figure 2B). Both ditches have 70-cm-high external embank-men ts. The sides of the square have a length of 100 m, and the diameter of the circular ditch is about 25 m. At present, the depth of the ditches is mod­erate (ca. 1.3 m), and the width is 8-10 m. The two earthworks are connected by a 20-m-wide road that

continues on the opposite side of the square toward a stream to the north. This road and elevated, I­m-high parts on the external embankment mark the northern entrance of the square. On the eastern side of the square-shaped ditch we observed the remains of a 40-cm-high trapezoid-shaped embankment and a simple linear embankment in a north-south direction, situated 100 m from the ditch. A roughly square-shaped walled enclosure is connected to the southeast section of the circu­lar ditch. The enclosure is approximately the same size as the circle and continues as a walled road some 200 m to the southeast in the direction of a stream (Figure 6). 

In 2008, 22 units with dimensions of I x I m were excavated at the Quinaua site. Units 1-6 were placed near the circular ditch in the southern sec­tor of the site. Inside the walled enclosure on the southeast side of the circle, Unit I yielded a few weathered fragments of pottery, but otherwise the compacted soil did not suggest any signs of cul­tural deposits. Unit 2, on the crest of the external embankment framing the circular ditch, had a mod­erate amount of potsherds at a depth of 70-130 cm. The structure of the soil in the first 50 cm of the excavation was loose with occasional fragments of charcoal. Unit 3, located at the base of the ditch, contained abundant pottery and some fragments of burned clay and charcoal. The major accumulation of cultural material was found in the 160-170 cm level. Unit 4, inside the circular earthwork, and Unit 5, on the inner margin of the circular ditch, did not suggest any archaeological deposits. 
Unit 6 was excavated on the northern side of the circle, near the entrance where the road toward the square-shaped ditch begins. The sandy texture and reddish brown color of the soil observed in this sec­tor differed considerably from those in other parts of the site. Robust utilitarian sherds were recovered from the cultural layer at a depth of I 0-70 cm (Fig­ure 7). At the level below where the last potsherds were found, the soil became compact, reddish, and culturally sterile. 

Units 7 and 8 were placed halfway between the two earthworks, with Unit 7 some 20 m to the east of the road and Unit 8 in the middle of the road. Both units were culturally sterile, as was Unit 9, which was situated approximately 15 m south of the circular ditch. Unit 10, on the crest of the road wall on the southeast side of the circle, did not show any indication of archaeological deposits either, excluding four small sherds. 
Units 11-22 were placed close to the square­shaped earthwork. Unit 11 was excavated on an ele­vation of the external embankment on the north side of the site where the road structure enters the square. Most of the sherds collected from this unit were concentrated in the 30-70 cm levels. Unit 12, in the middle of the road 10 m to the north of the ditch, and Units 13, 15, 18, and 19, all placed within and between the earthen structures, did not contain any archaeological material. Unit 14, on top of the trapezoid-shaped embankment, and Unit 17, on the crest of the simple linear embankment, had small amounts of sherds. In addition to pottery, Unit 14 yielded some fragments of burned clay in the 60-70 cm level. Unit 16, at the base of the square-shaped ditch, had a small amount of sherds in the 30-40 cm and 50-70 cm levels, but a major accumulation of pottery and charcoal was found at a depth of 100-140 cm. Another smaller cluster of sherds was noted at a depth of 170-180 cm. Units 20-22, located on the exterior embankment and on the inner margins of the square-shaped ditch, contained a small amount of ceramics from immediately under the humus layer to a depth of 30 cm but no other signs of cultural activities. 

Dating of the Sites 
A basic issue with the geometric earthworks is their chronology, which is of the utmost importance for understanding the regional typology, the compre­hensive extent of the occurrence of the earthwork sites, and their relationship to the cultural sequence of the Amazonian area in general. At the Fazenda Atlantica site we dated three different contexts (Table 2). The earliest date, 177 cal B.C--cal A.D. 48, associated with the occurrence of ceramics, was obtained from the base of the cultural layer, roughly at the current ground level in the external embankment of the circular ditch. The embankment structure inside the square-shaped ditch is some­what later, dating to cal A .D. 71-251. However, the existence of the road structure connecting the two earthworks suggests that they were probably used at the same time. The third date,calA.D.127-335, is from the feature in Unit 5, which included a shat­tered vessel, fragments of compacted calcium car­bonate, and unburned bones (Figure 5). This suggests that the small mound of dark anthropic soil

coal recovered from cultural layers in the external embankment and at the base of the square-shaped ditch yielded dates of cal A.D. 426-592 and cal 
A.D. 429-594, respectively. The date cal A.D. 424-564 was obtained from the sooty surface of a sherd collected from the 160-170 cm level in Unit 3, placed at the base of the circular ditch. The dates indicate that the site was occupied before the con­struction and use of the earthworks and that both ditch structures were contemporaneous. Concur­rent use of earthworks within the same site has also been noted at the Jaco Sa site. Two charcoal sam­ples recovered from cultural layers at Jaco Sa, at the base of a simple square-shaped ditch and in the external embankment of another earthwork, a dou­ble-ditch structure, yielded dates of cal A.D. 
780-977 and cal A.D. 782-984, respectively (Saunaluoma and Schaan 2012). 
Thennoluminescence dates are available from Alto Alegre, a site, partly damaged by the BR-364 Highway, composed of a variety of road structures connected to a semicircular ditch attached to a cir­cular ditch and situated only 2 km southwest of Fazenda Atliintica. These dates, obtained from Quinari-tradition ceramics, indicate a period of use at the site from about 200 B.C. to AD. 200 (Nicoli 2000), contemporaneous with Fazenda Atliintica. The dates of the Fazenda Atliintica and Quinaua sites also coincide with the long utilization of the Fazenda Colorada earthwork complex. Charcoal recovered from the diverse cultural layers of the site yielded radiocarbon dates that place the occu-

Ceramics 
The Quinari ceramic tradition, as defined by Dias (2006; Dias and Carvalho 1988), is divided into four phases that can be related to the earthwork sites in the Upper Purus Basin. The Quinari tradition is characterized by a fusion of cylindrical and glob­ular vessel forms with direct or everted rims, red slip as the primary surface-finishing technique, painted red and black lines on white slip and incised lines as the principal decorative elements, and the use of caraipe as the predominant temper, although charcoal, hematite, and grog tempers are also found (Dias 2006) .5 Anthropomorphic vessels in the form of a cylinder on a globe representing a human face, executed using the applique technique, are, accord­ing to Dias (2006: 190-191 ), a distinctive feature of the Quinari tradition. 
The archaeological material excavated from the Fazenda Atlantica site during the 2007 field sea­son consists of 278 potsherds (1.2 kg), of which 3 percent are diagnostic of the Quinari tradition. The sherds are fragmented and eroded to the extent that the incised lines on the few decorated pieces are almost indistinguishable. In 2008, 2,529 sherds 
(13.4 kg), of which 7 percent are categorized indis­putably as Quinari ceramics, were recovered from the excavations. The pottery is fragmented, and the surfaces of the sherds are eroded, making it diffi­cult to define the surface-finishing techniques and vessel body forms. The material excavated from Unit 5, placed on the small mound structure, is an exception, not only in quantity (making up 66 per­cent of all of the pottery recovered from Fazenda Atlantica) but also in the conservation state of the pottery,which is better.Altogether 82 percent (159 sherds) of finer decorated ware collected from the site was obtained from Unit 5. 
In addition to potsherds, 18 fragments of laterite slabs were collected from Units 4, 5, and JO. Some of these laterite fragments have use-wear traces indicating their use as grinding stones (Figure 8). Ferruginous laterite is a raw material commonly found in the Acre region. 
The nondecorated bulk ceramics of the Fazenda At!antica site are generally poorly fired and have cores that are darker than the surfaces, as well as some air bubbles. Decorated pottery is of a better quality, harder, and even in color. The coloring of the sherds varies considerably, ranging from pale gray to dark brown. The temper is predominantly organic, caraipe and charcoal, but occasional sand and hematite tempers were also observed. The sur­faces are largely eroded, but some better-conserved sherds show brown,red, and creamy white slip, and some potsherds display brushed surfaces. The thickness of the vessel walls varies between 3 and 12 mm. The bases are mainly flattened, but one example of a rounded base was recovered. The rims are direct or slightly everted and sometimes thickened. Unit 5 also yielded some outward-folded rims. The predominate decorative technique is inci­sion, but some painted sherds-red on white and red-and-black on white (Figure 9A)-and one fin­gernail-incised sherd with a flattened lip (Figure 9B) were recovered from Unit 5. 
The design elements are geometric and curvi­linear, and the design field is located on the upper part of the vessels. Parallel lines, incised on the inner side of the rim (Figure JOA), appear on many decorated sherds. In some cases, the lips of the rims are notched. Two molded pieces, that is, fragments of possible supports or lugs, and a spindle whorl fragment (Figure 9C) were found in the dark cul­tural layer in Unit 5. Several fragments (.8 kg in total) of a carinated bowl were recovered from Unit 
5. When this vessel was reconstructed, a curious combination of incised linear, spiral, and meander designs, executed on the collar of the vessel and on the slightly rounded lip, was revealed (Figure JOB). 
The archaeological material excavated from the Quinaua site consists of 1,813 potsherds (22.9 kg) and eight laterite slab fragments. Six of these lithic artifacts were found in Unit 6, in deposits sug­gesting an earlier settlement phase at the site. Only 4 percent of the pottery corresponds readily to the Quinari tradition, including mainly undecorated rims, although some incised body fragments and bases are also present. All recovered rims are direct with rounded lips. The bases are mostly slightly rounded and robust and are most likely fragments of large containers. Some of them are sooty inside. The pottery is tempered with charcoal and hematite particles, but caraipe and grog were also used. The surfaces of the ceramics are heavily eroded, but some sherds still have traces of brown and red slip. An example of finer ware-a fragment of a slightly

Globular anthropomorphic vessels were not noted in the ceramic collections of the sites exca­vated during the present study, but the remaining type attributes of the Quinari tradition are present in the ceramic material of the FazendaAtlantica and Quinaua sites. However, the fingernail incision and the carinated vessel form with a labial flange, pre­sent in the Fazenda Atlantica collection, are uncom­mon in the Quinari tradition. Carinated vessels are rather frequent in certain Amazonian ceramic com­plexes, such as the Incised Rim Tradition in the cen­tral Amazon (Lima 2008:273) and the Late Tutishcainyo (Lathrap 1970:90) and Yasuni pottery (Evans and Meggers 1968:11) in the Upper Ama­zon. The existence of different types of ceramics in the distinct mound context indicates a specific social relationship between diverse communities and may represent a sign of regional exchange focused on prestige building (Heckenberger 2005). 
Archaeological Deposits and Structures 

Unit 6, placed on the northern side of the Quinaua circular earthwork, at the juncture of the road con­necting the ditch structures, exhibited a darkish sand-textured cultural soil with abundant utilitar­ian pottery that mainly consisted of sooty robust fragments of larger vessels with some fragments of grinding stones and burned clay, suggesting, along with the radiocarbon dates, a settlement site preceding the construction of the earthworks at the location. The distribution of the archeological material related to the earthworks was similar at both sites investigated during the present study, although landscape smoothing and depositional processes altered the earthworks more at Quin­aua. At Fazenda Atlantica, the archaeological deposits were concentrated on the embankments and the small mound, while the flat surfaces enclosed by the ditches were practically empty of cultural layers and finds (Table 1). At Quinaua, in addition to those in the embankments, cultural deposits were concentrated in the ditches, while units excavated in areas inside and between the earthworks yielded scarce archaeological mater­ial. Unit 3, at the base of the circular ditch, sug­gested an accumulation of ceramics in the 160-170 cm level, perhaps indicating a more intensive phase of use at the site. The excavations proved that the ditches were originally much deeper than they are today. Although no test units were placed at the base of the square-shaped ditch of the Fazenda Atlantica site, ceramics are likely to be

found in this context also, as frequent superficial finds were observed on the slopes of the ditch. 
The fieldwork of Dias (2006) provided results simi Jar to ours: The centers of the earthwork enclo­sures had few finds, and the cultural layers were found in the ditches and on the external embank­ments. Dias interprets the deposits of archaeolog­ical material in the ditches as a case of resilience, meaning that the ditches were inhabited sporadi­cally during moments of crisis, both social and nat­ural. However, it is likely that it would be impractical to dwell in a ditch several meters deep, primarily due to precipitation, which might cause water to accumulate in the ditch. Naturally, the pos­sibility of occasional camping in the ditches can­not be excluded, but then the question becomes whether the site was already abandoned and later reoccupied only for the short term, possibly by another group that had a conception of the signif­icance, and perhaps the sacredness, of the earth­works different from that of the original builders of the site. 
The geometric ditches were primarily signs of, and perhaps provided restricted access to, exclu­sive activity areas, such as spaces for ritual and/or political practices. As a secondary function, they

entrances. The ditch base of the main entrance at the JK site was a place for elaborately decorated pot­tery (Saunaluoma and Schaan 2012), implying that this context had a special, possibly a votive, func­tion in the same manner as the small mound struc­ture at FazendaAtliintica. This mound of dark brown anthropic soil mixed with occasional fragments of charcoal is an especially interesting structure.6 The cultural layer in the mound contains a considerable quantity of pottery decorated with incision and painting, a pottery completely different from the utilitarian ceramics recovered from the other con­texts of the Fazenda Atlantica and Quinaua sites. The feature in the 110-120 cm level consisting of a broken vessel, fragments of burned clay, cemented calcium carbonate nodules, and a few unburned bones is even more surprising. The explanation for this feature remains open, as does the function of the mound itself. If the process of the creation of the mound was semi-intentional, that is, a by-prod­uct of other activities, such as the accumulation of refuse, why were finer ware, calcium carbonate, and animal bones placed intentionally at the base of the mound?7 In any case, the small mound was a place to deposit special materials and not just con­ventional everyday commodities or debris. 
Some of the mounds associated with ancient occupations in Amazonia contain burials (Machado 2005; Neves and Petersen 2006; Schaan 2007: 51-5 3), but due to the reduced size of the trial excavation on the Fazenda Atlantica mound, the presence, or absence, of human remains and bur­ial urns cannot be confirmed. In the central Ama­zon, artificial mounds bordering the plazas of certain precolonial villages and frequently includ­ing purposely destroyed vessels have been inter­preted as habitation units initially constructed on elevated platforms (Moraes 2010) or as middens possibly associated with special activities linked to communal ritual and public occasions (Hecken­berger et al. 1999; Machado 2005). The presence of the finer ware in the Fazenda Atlantica mound argues for the existence of prestige ceramics reserved for ceremonial use. The mound context could have functioned as an offering structure, exclusively utilized for certain public services that took place at the site. 
The arrangement of semicircular ditches in the inner comers of a square is an attribute found so far only at the Fazenda Atlantica site, but some other earthwork sites in Acre, such as California, Estrada Velha, Fazenda Nictheroy IV, Fazenda Vitoria, Nascentes do Quinaua, Nova Aldeia, Ramal dos Batalhas, and Rapira, present a combi­nation of a circular and a square-shaped ditch. Another shared structural feature observed at the Bela Vista, Chinesio, Dois Cfrculos, Fazenda Col­orada, Guaranta, and Xanadu I sites is a road lead­ing to a walled enclosure connected to a circular ditch, such as at Quinaua.8 These sites are situated within a 50-km radius of the FazendaAtiantica and

Quinaua sites (Figure I). The similarity of the struc­tural patterns implies a close connection between the distinct sites, but without comprehensive chronological data it is still uncertain if they all were occupied roughly at the same time or consecutively, if the archaeological material related to these sites shares common characteristics, if there was any development in the layout or structural features of the sites, or if phases of reoccupation took place in the course of the cultural sequence of the geomet­ric earthworks. 
Earthworks Embedded in Landscape 
Ditched earthworks related to prehistoric villages in the southern Amazon, in the Upper Xingu region (Heckenberger 2005; Hee ken berger et al. 1999; Heckenberger et al. 2008), and in the eastern Boli­vian Llanos de Mojos (Erickson 2010; Prtimers et al. 2006) are interpreted as having a predominantly defensive function, although the earthen structures could have some symbolic, economic, and/or visual importance too. Heckenberger (2005:90) mentions that in the prehistoric defensive earthworks of the Xingu region the ditch construction overburden was always mounded on the interior edge of the ditch. At the Acrean sites the situation is the oppo­site. Generally the ditches have clearly marked exterior embankments, which casts doubt on the sole protective function of these structures .9 Walker (2008a) explains the ring-ditches of the central Llanos de Mojos as hydraulic systems, which were useful in the seasonally flooded savanna, and as boundary markers for the occupational zones. The former explanation is not applicable in the case of the Acre earthworks, as these are located on non­flooding ground. Throughout the period of their construction and use, when the ditches were deeper than they are today, they may have held water dur-

ing the rainy season, although it appears that they were not typically constructed to connect, change, or remove water flows.10 Walker's second inter­pretation is more likely regarding the earthen struc­tures of Acre, and I propose that the geometric earthworks were markers of special places reserved for public sociopolitical and ritual practices. 
The circular enclosure forms seem to predom­inate in the southern part of the area with geomet­ric earthworks, while quadrangular forms are more common in the north (Schaan et al. 2007 :Figure 4). In addition, the Acrean earthworks manifest them­selves in other outline variants, such as ellipses, octagons, and U-and D-shapes. Nevertheless, I believe that for the ancient builders of the geo­metric earthworks, the circle, the square, and the straight line were the most important forms, and the other figures had a lesser significance in the earthwork architecture. The remains of material culture related to the earthworks are scarce and limited to imperfectly preserved pottery. However, the same symbols used in earthwork architecture may have also had a focal significance in other contexts, constructions, and objects. 
If they were indeed constructed as public mon­uments, central spaces for varied gatherings and ceremonies, how do the geometric earthworks relate to ancient political and religious ideology? Staller (2008:2) asserts that "the landscape was cul­turally defined by ruling political and/or religious specialists from a certain place, usually major cul­tural centers that also had important symbolic sig­nificance to ethnic identity and social order." In the course of human history, it has often been impor­tant to transform new land into a given group's proper territory through the creation of a percepti­ble representation of the ideological values of the populace, as is done among the contemporary northern Arawakan groups in the South American tropical lowlands (Zucchi 2002), and to mark con­secrated places physically in the landscape, as the construction of central monuments by Neolithic small-scale societies of the British Isles exempli­fies (Tilley 1996). In many ritual and administra­tive centers of central Andean precolumbian societies, certain architectural elements, particu­larly the symmetry and balance of rectangular plazas and enclosures with (sunken) circular plazas, persisted throughout the centuries (e.g., Pozorski and Pozorski 2008; Shady 2006). The circle and square forms probably also had a specific mean­ing in the cosmology of the ancient occupants of the Upper Purus Basin, which was reflected in the geometric earthwork architecture. In addition to the symbolic significance of the earthwork forms, the ditch structures functioned to delimit and restrict access to the special sections of the sites, while the enclosures and roads directed and regulated entry to and exit from the principal earthworks. As Tilley states (1996: 168), "Circles imply motion within and around, lines motion along. Both types of mon­ument demarcated spaces to cross, to go beyond, spaces to move into and out of, move between, look at and look beyond." 
The consistency of the positioning and orienta­tion of the earthworks in the landscape, the repeti­tive regularity of distinct earthen structures, and the layout of the sites argues for a certain cultural prin­ciple. Ethnohistoric sources contain some exam­ples of the importance of circular and square forms for Amazonian peoples. Architectural monumen­tality, demonstrated in the circular plaza village sys­tem interconnected by extensive road networks, is considered typical of Arawakan groups (Hecken­berger 2002, 2005). A circular village plan linked with socioceremonial organization is also common among the contemporary Ge of central Brazil (Wiist and Barreto 1999). During the initiation ceremonies of Apinaye warriors, a circular open area was cleaned at a distance of 200 m from the village and connected by a straight path to the easternmost point of the circle of houses (Nimuendajti 1983).11 Alter­natively, ethnographic literature refers to the rec­tangular communal huts and the octagonal ground plan of the male clubhouses among the Pano of the eastern Bolivian lowlands (Metraux 1942:42). However, spreading out in an area of diverse eco­logical and cultural settings in the southwestern Amazon, the geometric earthwork architecture may even have been shared beyond ethnic boundaries (Schaan et al. 2012). The geometric earthwork tra­dition can be regarded as a cultural tendency that was not necessarily restricted to a certain ethnic or linguistic group. It can be seen as a globalized regional phenomenon that was characterized by local variants and alterations. 
The geometric earthworks were constructed on carefully selected elevated, yet level surfaces. Their location on interfluvial plateaus provided good vis­ible control over the surrounding terrain, assuming

that vegetation was more or less as it is today, after a few decades of intensive logging of the forest, that is, more open and similar to a savanna.12 Ethnoar­chaeological study among the modem Kuikuru in the Upper Xingu region demonstrates that the vil­lages and adjacent areas, located initially on forested terra firme, are swiftly converted to an environment of anthropogenically created savannas, parklands, low secondary forests, and cleared areas with recent gardens and occupation sites (Schmidt 2010). It is to be expected that the ancient societies inhabiting the terra firme plains in Acre also altered the envi­ronment by modifying and managing the natural world surrounding their occupational areas. 

What distinguishes the geometric earthwork sites from many occupational sites in Amazonia is the lack of extensive anthropogenic terra preta (Amazonian dark earth) deposits. Amazonian dark earth is considered an indication of a continuing, fully sedentary agricultural way of life (Woods et al. 2009). Earthwork architecture conforms to the idea of a densely populated region with fixed long­lasting occupations, although not necessarily within the earthen structures or in their immediate vicin­ity. This means that the purpose of the geometric earthworks probably was not initially related to dwelling or agriculture. In any case, Acrean mon­umental earthwork architecture clearly contradicts the deep-rooted but presently withdrawing terra firme (upland)-vdrzea (floodplain) dichotomy, which made the Amazonian interfluvial zone inca­pable of sustaining widespread sedentary popula­tions (e.g., Lathrap 1970; Meggers 1971). The distribution of the geometric earthworks roughly overlaps that of the natural stands of the Brazil nut (Bertho lletia excelsa [Mori and Prance 1990: 137]). Given the high nutritional value of the Brazil nut, it is likely that this is not a mere coincidence. Instead, it suggests that Brazil nut arboriculture may have been one of the sustaining resources of the earthwork builders. 
Discussion 

Earthwork engineering was a common practice throughout the Amazonian lowlands during the precolumbian period. The earthworks were built for different purposes, some more practical, some more symbolic, which is reflected in the diverse typo­logical, functional, and structural categories that present different cultural, regional, and temporal affiliations. Based on fieldwork carried out at the Fazenda AtHintica and Quinaua sites in Acre, the two geometric earthwork sites share common traits in their layout and features, the distribution of cul­tural deposits, and the attributes of the archaeo­logical finds. The cultural material is concentrated mainly on the slopes and at the bases of the ditches and on the embankment structures, as if the frag­ments of pottery and burned clay were part of the construction fill for the embankments. For the most part, ceramic materials seem to be associated with. the initial construction period or postprimary use of the sites. The amount of cultural activity rem­nants and the density of artifacts are low inside the area demarcated by the earthworks. It seems that these sections of the sites were kept clear of cul­tural debris and undergrowth. This was also the case for the roads. The test units excavated within these structures contained a scarcity of archaeological deposits. The ditch structures apparently protected but also controlled access to the special areas, while the roads guided passage in the direction of the cen­tral sectors of the sites. 
Considering the distribution of archaeological material, the center of the earthworks was most probably a public area, that is, a plaza reserved for communal gatherings and socioceremonial activi­ties, which is a cultural institution still in existence among some contemporary indigenous groups of the southern Amazon and central Brazil (Hecken­berger 2005; Heckenberger et al. 2008; Nimuendaju 
1983; Turner 2002; Wtist and Barreto 1999). The absence of dwelling deposits in the immediate vicin­ity of the earthworks is a distinction of the Acrean sites. The documented settlement layers at the Quin­aua site seem to predate the construction and initial use of the earthworks. However, the Acre region still lacks systematic survey of habitation sites. One of the aims for future research is to identify the loca­tion, features, and intensity of the village sites related to the geometric earthworks and also to study the population's means of subsistence. 
The carefully planned position of the earthworks in the landscape and the recurring geometric fom1s represented in earthwork architecture suggest func­tions that were part of a tradition of shared collec­tive ideology related to the cosmology and/or sociopolitical concerns of the ancient peoples. The small mound structure located inside the square-

shaped ditch at Fazenda Atlantica implies a ritual use for the site. The carinated vessel recovered from the mound differs from the typical Quinari-tradition pottery, which could imply the existence and impor­tance of an elite ware related to the exchange of sym­bolic prestige goods in a larger interlinked regional system (Heckenberger 2005): "Ritual performance in highly structured public ceremonial spaces and material culture were primary mechanisms of social communication within multiethnic and, in some cases, multilingual regional sociopolitical systems" (Heckenberger and Neves 2009:259, citing Barreto 2008 and Lathrap 1985). 
The monumental earthworks in Acre were dis­covered only fairly recently, but the ditches and embankments are already filling in and eroding, pri­marily due to present-day land use. The meaning and magnitude of a precolumbian earthwork phe­nomenon of a genuine Amazonian origin are just beginning to be understood, but the possible dis­appearance of these sites may be only decades away. In addition to studying them, we should also find a way to protect these unique testimonials of the Amazonian past.

Notes 

I. Soil creep and slope wash processes that transport the fine-grained sediments will fill up, widen, and flatten the earthworks noticeably over time (O'Neal et al. 2005). Today, the forms and dimensions of the earthworks, as well as the distribution of materials, may be quite different from the orig­inal ones. 
2. Programa Nacional de Pesquisas Arqueol6gicas na Bacia Amaz6nica was a research project coordinated by Betty Meggers and Clifford Evans of the Smithsonian Institution. For a more comprehensive general description of the archae­ological research realized in Acre, see Schaan 2008. 


3. 
The total station measurements were taken with a 600­series Geodimeter. On average, 1,320 measurements were made on each site. Given the considerable area of the sites and the available time per site, the parts with flat or simple topography were mapped sparsely, while the earthworks were measured in more detail. This means that structures that were not noticed in the field are unlikely to be visible in the surface models. The maps are based on our perception of the sites, and there might be more structures and features waiting to be found. 

4. 
Some of the unburned bones were identified as frag­ments of the upper jaw and teeth of agouti (family Dasyproctidae), a rodent with widespread distribution in the Amazonian area. The rest of the bones were of unidentified species and may have been from larger mammals and birds. 


5. Caraipe is siliceous tree bark (Licania sp.) ash. 

6. 
Mounds are found at some earthwork sites in Acre, for example, at Coqueiral, Sol de Maio (Schaan and Bueno 2008), Fazenda Iquiri II (Schaan and Bueno 2009), and Campo Esperarn,;a (Schaan and Saunaluoma 2010), but in these cases several mounds form a circular enclosure, and therefore their function is probably different from that of the individual structure documented at the Fazenda Atlantica site. 

7. 
Excavations at the Las Palmeras earthwork site in the Bolivian Amazon (Saunaluoma 2010) revealed that the small depression features located inside a circular ditch were filled with abundant sherds and midden debris. In addition, we observed a calcite feature in one of the depressions at a depth of 70-80 cm, but the implication of this feature remains uncertain. Today, calcite has more uses than almost any other mineral as a construction material, a pigment for paint, a field dressing, and a medication. 

8. 
At the Fazenda Colorada site the structure linked to the enclosure is a U-shaped double ditch instead of a circle. 

9. 
The defensive function of small circular earthworks of the Adena culture in the North American Eastern Woodlands has been discarded precisely due to external piling of ditch construction backfill (Clay 1987). 

10. 
The JK site, consisting of two concentric square­shaped ditches, was constructed in the margin of a stream so that the watercourse actually forms part of the outer ditch. However, this type of solution is uncommon in the earthwork architecture of Acre. 


11. This pertains to the Macro-Ge linguistic family. 

12. One of the objectives of the ongoing studies on the Acrean earthworks is to investigate the vegetation history of the region.
