During the Formative period (ca. 1000 B.C.-A.D. 250) at the site ofYarumela in central Honduras, un indigenous society developed that was constructing monumental architecture well before 400 B.C. Experimentation with new building materials and techniques reached a peak ca. A.D. 200 just prior to the site's abandonment, by which time religious temples and elite residences had undergone a transition from simple pole-and-thatch structures to more complex adobe and stone constructions. Overall labor investment in monumental architecture may, on the other hand, actually have declined during this same period. 
Durante el periodo Formativo (ca. 1000 A.C.-250 D.C.) en el sitio de Yarumela en el centro de Honduras, una sociedad indfgena se desaroll6 con la construcci6n de arquitectura monumental antes de 400 A. C. Se experiment6 con nuevos metodos y materia/es de construcci6n hacia aproximadamente 200 D.C., antes de abandonar el sitio, cuando /os temp/as y residencias de la elite pasaron par una transici6n desde estructuras simples con materiales organicas hasta construcciones mas complejas de adobe y piedra. En cambio, la cantidad de mano de obra relacionada con esta arquitectura monumental parece haber bajado durante esta misma epoca. 
Between 1988 and 1990, we conducted excavations of Formative-period monumental architecture at the site of Yarumela in central Honduras (Figure 1) as part of a broader study focused on early site planning on the southeast mesoamerican periphery. We have identified a tentative sequence of construction techniques and materials in the archaeological record, which roughly parallels the rise of ranked society in the Comayagua Valley between approximately 600 B.C. and A.D. 250. 
During the Middle Formative period large, stone-faced earthen pyramids were constructed as platforms to support both elite and public architecture. The tallest example at the site, at least 20 m in height, was found to have the remains of a pole-and-thatch superstructure occupying some 448 square meters. Earthen cores up to 4 m tall, floored with lime plaster, were also found inside three other structures at Yarumela that date to this construction epoch. 
During the following Late Formative period platform design remained relatively stable while superstructure building techniques and materials underwent considerable innovation. Builders aban­doned pole and thatch in favor of wattle and daub, which was eventually replaced by adobe and stone in several cases. New structures were erected around a central plaza area east of the main mound, while earlier structures were rebuilt several times over this period. 
Earlier filling episodes within platforms depended on relatively sterile soils presumably quarried nearby, whereas later fill appears to have originated in Middle to Late Formative structures dis­mantled within the village itself. Because the initial stages of the majority of monumental-scale structures were constructed in the Middle Formative period, the volume of fill employed in Late Formative platform construction was considerably less, a fact that suggests an overall decrease in communal labor investment through time. 
An increase in the diameter and depth of postholes supporting superstructures from the Middle to the Late Formative seems to parallel a decrease in overall size of these buildings. This suggests

that the implementation of new techniques and materials did not produce an inherently more stable structure without considerable experimentation. A decrease in overall labor invested in more com­plex construction efforts may have been one indication of societal stress immediately prior to the site's abandonment. 
BACKGROUND 
Environment 
The site ofYarumela (LP-1 in the National Register of Sites in Honduras) is located at an elevation of 600 m in the Comayagua Valley of central Honduras. It is situated on the west bank of the

Humuya River, which flows into the Ulua drainage system and the Caribbean to form the north half of the Central Honduran Corridor (Hirth 1988). The climate in the immediate vicinity of Yarumela is divided between a dry season from January to April and a wet season from May to December. Average annual rainfall in the valley is 1,0 16 mm, and yearly average temperature is 25°C (Dixon l 989a:5-7). The site ofYarumela itself is somewhat hotter and drier, however, owing to a partial rainshadow effect from nearby mountains, which reach elevations of greater than 1,000 m. Vegetation on the site today consists of a semi-xerophytic scrub forest with several varieties of 
large cactus, weeds, and grasses. A semitropical broadleaf forest along the banks of the Humuya 
River creates a highly productive ecotone of flora and fauna locally. A seasonally inundated flood 
plain between these two zones in places supports up to three crops of traditional mesoamerican 
staples a year, whereas the table land on which Yarumela sits can only produce one crop dependably 
without irrigation. 
Previous Archaeology 
During the mid-nineteenth century, the pioneer observer Ephraim G. Squier (1855: 123) visited the site ofYarumela while in the Comayagua Valley surveying a possible transcontinental railway route. His description of the site, which was named after the nearest small village several kilometers upstream, indicates a state of preservation much better than that of a mere century later. The architecture was 
of regular forms, rectangular, and placed with scrupulous reference to the cardinal points .. . having been terraced ... [with] flights of steps at the middle of each side .. . [and] fragments of walls of cut stones still standing [Squier 1859:608]. 
Two archaeological expeditions to Central America briefly mention Yarumela in the early twen­
tieth century in describing their passage through Honduras. Samuel K. Lothrop (1927: 1 14-220) 
passed the site in 1926 while en route to Tenampua, as did Jens Yde (1938:14) of the Tulane­
Danish Museum group in 1935. Neither investigator conducted any research at the site during his 
visit, and neither appears to have suspected its antiquity. 
A decade later the site of Yarumela sparked the interest of Monsefior Federico Lunardi, then 
bishop of the Diocese of Comayagua. His recognition of the significance of the site, which he 
mistakenly identified as Maya, is to be commended, as are the first published photos of Str. 101 
(Lunardi 1948:Plano XI) and of a fragment of sculpture reportedly uncovered nearby (Lunardi 1941: 
23). Lunardi also noted the presence of a lagoon on the southern oxbow of the Humuya River below 
Str. 103, a feature found to be associated with at least two other Formative-period sites located on 
ancient river channels in the valley. 
It was not until the mid-twentieth century that the true antiquity of the site of Yarumela was 
realized within the scientific community. Joel Canby ( 1949, 19 51) conducted test excavations around 
the edges of the site in a study of its early ceramic sequence, and correctly identified the remains 
with "Archaic" or Formative-period levels at the site of Copan (Longyear 1940). This link established 
the first relative chronological scale for occupation of the valley. 
Doris Stone (1957, 1972) is to be credited with bringing the site ofYarumela to the attention of 
the broader public in her exhaustive works on the Comayagua Valley and Central America as a 
whole. Her detailed description of the site and illustration of diagnostic artifacts from surface 
collections firmly placed Yarumela in the context of Formative-period developments across the 
southeast mesoamerican periphery. Partly owing to Canby's and Stone's reporting, Claude Baudez 
(1966) visited the site and made surface collections while he was conducting test excavations at the 
nearby site of Lo De Vaca. Baudez confirmed the Formative assessment of Canby and Stone and 
documented Yarumela's place in a larger valley-wide settlement system with ties to northern Hon­
duran ceramic complexes such as those at Los Naranjos (Baudez and Becquelin 1973) and Playa 
de los Muertos (Kennedy 1986; Popenoe 1934; Strong et al. 1938). 
Excavations on a larger scale were begun at Yarumela in 1980 by L. R. V. Joesink-Mandeville 
(1987a) as part of a project investigating the links between Formative-period ceramic complexes of 
Mesoamerica and South America. Efforts during the first three seasons focused on areas of nonmound

occupation near Canby's previous excavations; the results of the work have been presented elsewhere (Colby 1988; Elder 1983; Joesink-Mandeville 1986). 
More recently, three field seasons between 1988 and 1990 have focused on early site planning at Yarumela (Dixon and Joesink-Mandeville 1989; Joesink-Mandeville and Dixon 1988). Excavations have concentrated on documenting the specific architectural histories of individual monumental structures on the site in order to compile a record of elite construction activities and the initial appearance of social ranking. In conjunction with these two research designs, but on a regional and more diachronic scale, Dixon conducted a 10 percent random survey of the entire 550-sq-km Comayagua Valley between 1985 and 1987 (Dixon 1987, 1989a, 1989b, 1992). The study was concerned with the role of the highland valley as a cultural corridor through time, beginning with the emergence of the Formative polity at Yarumela. 
The Site 
The above-ground architecture on the site of Yarumela covers approximately 30 ha on a Pleis­tocene terrace some 10 m above the present course of the Humuya River (Figure 1). The western and southern boundaries are created by an ancient channel of the Humuya, which at some point in the distant past isolated the location as an island, a process that had presumably ended before the initial occupation of the site (Joesink-Mandeville et al. 1990:5). This remnant feature of an earlier landscape nevertheless retains water during the wet season and may have served as a defensive moat (Dixon 1989b:26 1) and/or borrow pit for construction fill. 
Ceramics found stratigraphically beneath the earliest dated radiocarbon sample from the site (UCR-2110, Table l) indicate that a small egalitarian hamlet had appeared on two oxbows opposite one of the broader expanses of flood plain on the Humuya River by approximately 1000 B.C. Initially there was more than enough seasonally inundated farmland available to support a mixed agricultural economy based upon maize and manioc (Joesink-Mandeville l 987a:207). The climate of many tropical highland basins can be far from predictable or homogeneous, however, and the Comayagua Valley is no exception (Dixon 1989a:5-7). Rainfall varies considerably from the wetter and hotter northern end of the valley to the drier and cooler southern end, and Y arumela falls in a partial rainshadow much of the year. The cyclical nature of the wet season is also locally unpre­dictable. For example, only one rainfall-dependent crop has been produced between May and September during the past seven years. 
The early farmers here may well have lamented their choice of settlement (as many still do today), but their location at the geographical center of a valley that experiences such climatic instability proved to be their strongest asset. Sanders and Webster (1988:253) and Braun and Plog (1982:508) have postulated a subsistence model for this region that emphasizes risk minimization in drier climes to explain events during the Middle Formative period (Dixon 1989b:261). It was probably at this time that Yarumela's more entrepreneurial individuals began to mediate the exchange of local agricultural surplus from the north end of the valley for resources and labor offered from the other end. Their role was facilitated by the location ofYarumela roughly a half day's walk from all corners of the valley, a suggested limit to many early chiefdoms (Spencer 1987:375). 
The rise of ranked society in the Comayagua Valley can consequently be viewed as the result of 
interaction between the "functionalist" and "political" models of development (Hayden and Gargett 
1990:4). Certain members of society may have been able to create an elevated niche for themselves 
based upon their management skills, but they soon reified their position in society, probably by 
manipulating religious symbolism, ancestor worship, kinship ties, and the exchange of exotic re­
sources (Hirth 1989:302). The initiation and coordination of the construction of monumental ar­
chitecture to elevate themselves above the populace was surely another symbolic act of elite self­
promotion. 
There is no direct evidence that Yarumela was subject to any substantial immigration or colo­
nization from more Olmec inspired cultures to the north (Healy 1974) and west (Baudez and 
Becquelin 1973) during the Formative. Broad similarities between Yarumela and these cultures 
have been noted in figurine styles and ceramics (Joesink-Mandeville l 987a), and possible fragments

of deliberately broken "boulder sculpture" related to northern and western occurrences have been recovered within Late Formative construction fill and underneath a cupulate monument of that period on the Main Plaza (Joesink-Mandeville l 987b). The relatively low frequencies of obsidian and jade artifacts compared to later periods indicates, however, an essentially indigenous origin to this first ranked society in the Comayagua Valley. 
It is not until the Late Formative period that contact with the broader southeast mesoamerican world becomes evident at Yarumela. The increased presence of jade, obsidian, marble, and seashells indicates stronger involvement of the local elite in an interregional interaction sphere. Prestige-good exchange (Spencer 1987:376) was, in fact, probably one of the primary mechanisms for maintaining alliances between the polity at Yarumela and its secondary centers around the valley (Figure 2), as well as with similar ranked societies across the southeast mesoamerican periphery. A fragment of possibly Izapan-style sculpture similar to that recorded in the 1940s (Lunardi 194 1 :23; Stone 1957: Figure 41), recovered in 1990 (Joesink-Mandeville 199 1:98), emphasizes the sharing of an ideology with highland Guatemala and El Salvador (Henderson 1981: 122). 
The Late Formative site plan at Yarumela is dominated by 20-m-tall Str. IOI, which forms the western element of a "C" shape with 6-m-tall Strs. 103 and 104 at the south and north respectively

(Figure 3). A central plaza is framed within this area by 9-m-tall Str. I 02 on the banks of the Humuya and four mounds under 3 m in height. An additional I0 mounds and several heavily damaged platforms are scattered across the site in less obvious clusters. 
The 4-m-tall Str. 20 I lies southwest of the main site across the ancient river channel and is the only mound of monumental scale in the vicinity. The fact that Late Formative period cultural material covers the surface on this side of the channel for a distance of I km in some directions suggests, however, the existence of a substantial supporting population that occupied flat, non­mounded areas. Layers of ashy soil with cultural material can also be observed along the north oxbow of the Humuya River just beyond Str. 104, and their depth of almost 2 m gives the impression of considerable antiquity.

ARCHITECTURE 
The Formative-period archaeological data presented here are offered as documentation of a trend 
from simple to more complex architectural construction at the same time that total labor investment 
in these works appears to have declined. In order to be as concise as possible, we have selected 
structures that best portray this sequence, which we describe following the widely accepted chro­
nology of Early (pre-1000 B.C.), Middle (1000-400 B.C.), and Late (400 B.C.-A.D. 250) Formative. 
For ease of comparison with earlier works on the site (Baudez 1966; Canby 1949, 195 1), the phases Y arumela I through III are also used. 
Early Formative/Yarumela I 
Excavations by Canby ( 1949) south of the Main Plaza located Early Formative material at the bottom of almost 2 m of cultural deposits. Subsequent testing by Joesink-Mandeville (l 987a:206) in the same vicinity revealed the remains of a pole-and-thatch house with hard-packed floor, interior fire pits, postholes, and pieces of burnt daub. The radiocarbon date of 1125-800 cal B.C. (UCR­2110) for Firepit #2 places this feature at the transition from the Early to Middle Formative periods, and there are ceramic elements present from both periods. A similarly early date of 1160-780 cal 
B.C. (UCR-24 12) was also recovered from the base of Mound 104 on the north oxbow. Yarumela I ceramics appear stylistically similar to Early Formative complexes such as Tronadora

in highland Costa Rica (Hoopes 1985) and Ocos on the Pacific coast of Guatemala (Coe 196 1). Diagnostic vessel forms and decorative techniques include highly burnished plain or occasionally red-rimmed shallow plates, bowls, and jars, sometimes occurring with applique fillets, hollow-reed punctations, and heavy incisions (see photos in Joesink-Mandeville [1987a:202-205]). Some ex­amples of solid and hollow figurines also occur, as do fragments of undecorated stone bowls. 
Middle Formative/Yarumela II 
Middle Formative domestic residential remains were encountered by Canby and Joesink-Man­deville in the same locale as the earlier material. Excavations in 1983 revealed portions of "a large oblong-shaped baked-clay hearth or stove" (Joesink-Mandeville 1987a:206), radiocarbon dated to 
1430-190 cal B.C. (UCR-2 11 1). This feature is remarkably similar in design to one found at Chalchuapa in northern El Salvador (Sharer 1985: 16) from the same period. Two other radiocarbon dates of 1000-770 cal B.C. (Beta-6226) and 520-170 cal B.C. (Beta-6227) were recovered in 198 1 from strata accumulated during the same period above the south oxbow. 
Yarumela II ceramics consist of a continuation of most previous Early Formative vessel forms and decorative techniques plus the addition of various handles and appendages that include stirrup spouts. Pattern burnishing became a diagnostic trait for this period (see photos in J oesink-Mandeville [1987a: 199]) while thin-walled fine-paste "napkin-ring" ear spools occurred with increasing fre­quency. 
It was also at this time that monumental architecture first appeared at the site of Yarumela (monumental scale in northern Honduras is defined archaeologically as > 2 m in height [Hasemann 1987:90]). Excavations between 1988 and 1990 at Strs. 102-104 revealed 2-to-4-m-high Middle Formative earthen cores capped with lime plaster beneath the 6-to-9-m-high platform mounds along the Humuya River terrace. The radiocarbon assay for a burnt and collapsed wall found above the lowest stratum of Str. 104 had two age ranges of 800-360 cal B.C. and 290-25 1 cal B.C. (calibrated at two sigma) (UCR-24 1 1). Another earlier radiocarbon sample with a date of 840-390 cal B.C. (UCR-2419) was found at the base of Str. 103, associated with a "pot-bellied" ceramic effigy vessel similar in style to Middle Formative sculpture across southern Mesoamerica (Joesink-Mandeville 
1987b). 
Testing of 3-m-high Str. 106 just outside the southwest corner of the Main Plaza showed that the 
entire mound dates from the same period. Unlike all other monumental structures at the site, it 
was apparently never added to in the subsequent Late Formative. No radiocarbon samples have 
been recovered from this structure, but its age may be indicated by the fact that not a sherd of 
Yarumela III Usulutan ceramics was found on its occupation surface or in the structural fill. Ex­
cavations in 1989 revealed a series of pits excavated into the substructural clays, which suggests 
the possible existence of a buried household cluster that predates the entire mound construction. 
Str. 101. The single most impressive architectural achievement attributed to the Middle For­mative period at Yarumela is the construction of 20-m-high Str. 10 1, which measures approximately 110 m long by 70 m wide at its base. Excavations during 1990 showed that the mound was even taller prior to disturbance by ground-leveling activities related to the construction of a series of ranch houses during the past few decades. Up to 60 cm of disturbed fill containing artifacts that span Late Formative, Classic, and historic to modern eras caps the surface today. Directly beneath the mixed deposit, however, a very clear record of an elite residential/ceremonial superstructure was prserved, perhaps the earliest such evidence on the southeast mesoamerican periphery. The pole-and-thatch building measured approximately 32 m north-south by 14 m east-west, with its long axis facing the Main Plaza to the east (Figure 4). A 3.5-m-wide patio or veranda outside the front of the structure was finished with a lime plaster similar to that described for Strs. 102-104 (Figure 5, Layer III). A narrower 1.5-m walkway provided access around the sides and back of this structure; it paralleled the remains of a flagstone drain (Figure 4) that presumably channeled runoff from the massive thatch roof in a manner similar to Formative drains at Abaj Takalik in Guatemala (Brian Dillon, personal communication 199 1 ). 
The inside of the structure was floored with hard-packed clay and thin lenses of fine sand, with 
evidence of several noncontinuous reflooring episodes above the original level (Figure 5, Layer II).

Postholes measuring an average of 30 cm in diameter and up to 2 m in depth were spaced every 3-4 m along the central axis of the house (Figure 5). A second set of similar-sized posts was located approximately 8 m to the north and south of this axis along the front of the structure (Figure 4), but time constraints prevented exposure of the interior sides or back walls. Limited testing failed to reveal any internal room divisions or domestic features, but the vast majority of the structure remains unexcavated. 
No evidence of a central staircase providing access to the summit was found in 1990, but this feature may well have been dismantled in historic times, as apparently happened to the two terraces exposed along the southern flank ofStr. 102. These retaining walls, 1.2-1.6 m thick and up to 1.6 m high, were divided by narrow floors of sand and hard-packed clay (Figure 6, Layers III, VI, IX, and XI) that were probably capped with lime plaster during their daily use. A fragment of a stone drain presumably connected to a sump hole located in the southwest comer of the superstructure above (Figure 4) was found beneath one such terrace floor, dipping toward the east to facilitate runoff (Figure 7). 
Further clearing and trenching downslope and on the north side of the mound failed to reveal any additional intact terraces, although cobbles and partial floor sections suggest that most of the

sides ofStr. 101 were faced with stones. Test trenching of the eastern surface of the platform mound in 1988 also indicated that this lower level was floored with plaster, and probably supported at least two smaller superstructures facing each other perpendicular to the main building above (Figure 3). 
Late Formative/Yarumela III 
During the previous period we see considerable effort invested in monumental architecture at various locations in Yarumela, but the range in variability seems to have been one of scale rather than construction techniques. Earthen cores capped with plaster surfaces are present in Strs. 101­104, and it can be assumed that all were faced with river cobbles to retain the easily eroded fill. These construction materials have the advantage of being locally available with the exception of limestone, which was used sparingly. 
In this period it is also obvious that whereas the total volume of construction could not have surpassed that of the Middle Formative period, the degree of inventiveness and experimentation rose considerably, quite apart from that required merely to maintain or build upon an already successful architectural tradition. Strs. 108 and 109 were built using wattle-and-daub superstructures, while Str. 105 employed cobbles with adobe and Str. 110 used large, fiat limestone slabs as terrace facing. The two radiocarbon dates associated with the burning ofStr. 108 place this event between 489-180 cal B.C. (UCR-2417) and 400-100 cal B.C. (UCR-2418). 
Yarumela III ceramics associated with this building epoch are easily identified by the introduction of fine-paste Usulutan ware (see photos in Joesink-Mandeville [1987a: 199]). These serving vessels are decorated by a negative resist technique found across much of southern Mesoamerica during the Late Formative period (Demarest and Sharer 1982, 1986:303). Other cruder utilitarian wares continue earlier decorative modes and vessel forms.

activity (Figure 1). In the subsequent period the 4-m-tall Middle Formative earthen core (Figure 8,

Layer XXV) saw at least four additions that raised the mound's summit to 9 m above the plaza by approximately A.O. 250 (Figure 9). Builders extended plaster-surfaced cobbled terraces and a central staircase beyond the original construction, and employed a variety of new techniques on a succession of superstructures. Structural fill now consisted of materials redeposited from Late Formative mounds, including some burial contents and midden debris. This suggests a rise in local population and an increasing disregard for nonelite ancestry by those in charge. 
During the first phase of this construction epoch a large pole-and-thatch superstructure was abandoned in favor of a somewhat smaller wattle-and-daub building. A cobblestone door jamb 2.3 m wide, 6.5 m long, and at least 1.5 m high was built in a doorway 3.3 m wide (Figure 10, foreground). This led out to a 1-m-wide veranda above the new staircase and terraces that faced Str. 10 1 to the west. An empty burial chamber with ceramic offerings, perhaps that of a retainer or occupant later removed, was encountered directly beneath this doorway in 1990. Interior floors consisted of fine sands on compacted clay (Figure 8, Layer XX), whereas the exterior veranda and surrounding walkways were plaster. A stone footing for the rear wall indicated a room approximately 6 m wide with the long axis oriented roughly north-south, although its exact size was not determinable during the 1988 season. 
The second phase of construction on Str. 102 consisted of a rebuilding of the earlier-phase superstructure an additional 2.4 m eastward toward the river. The rear wall base was retained as an interior bench 20 cm high (Figure 10, background) and the Phase 2 exterior plaster floor was covered to support the extended sand floor. Abandoning the previous wattle-and-daub technique, the builders then raised an adobe-filled wall with interior mud plastering to a height of at least 1.3 m, with an approximate width of 1.1 m (Figure 8, Layers XIV-XVI). A second exterior plaster floor was also raised 20 cm to meet this new back wall. The early use of adobe during the Formative period in Honduras has also been observed in the El Cajon region (George Hasemann, personal communication 1984), and it continued to be employed during the Classic period in El Salvador (Sheets et al. 1990:86). 
The third construction phase on Str. 102 was probably as labor intensive as the first, including 
the addition of a new cobble staircase and the extension of a series of terraces (Figure 8, Layers 
XVIII-XIX) out onto the Main Plaza with a change in overall orientation to some 35° to the south. 
The initiation of this phase may have coincided with the burning of the earlier adobe superstructure,

as a layer of ash and burnt thatch (Figure 8, Layer XI), radiocarbon dated to 170 cal B.C.-cal A.D. 140 (UCR-2414), was found lying directly on the sand floor. This debris was deliberately capped by a new type of mortar made of crushed lime with a high content of straw or thatch as a binding agent. The entire Phase 2 superstructure was then filled with redeposited mound fill and midden between the cobble door jamb and rear adobe wall to a height of 1.8 m above the earlier floor to provide the base for a new superstructure (Figure 8, Layers VIII-XIII). 
The remains of the fourth-phase building have long since eroded away, but the last superstructure must have also been of considerable size judging by a partially hollow posthole 3.5 m deep and 60 cm wide with cobble shoring at its base (Figure 8, Layers II-VII) that was excavated into the middle of the Phase 3 fill. Similar-sized postholes have been found on Formative-period structures at various sites in the Maya Lowlands, and have been interpreted as possible evidence of carved sculpture as well as roof supports (Freidel and Schele 1988:560). An unacceptably early radiocarbon date of 380 B.C.-A.D. 20 (UCR-2413) associated with the posthole fill suggests that mound fill was either excavated from within the structure or transported from elsewhere. 
CONCLUSIONS 
The obvious temptation after reviewing the transformation of Formative-period construction styles at Yarumela is to assume a direct correlation between the rise of sociopolitical stratification and architectural complexity. The apparent advent of social ranking during the Middle Formative period does in fact coincide with the largest investment of labor in monumental architecture at the site. As the gap between elite and nonelite members of society became increasingly pronounced in the Late Formative period, however, the actual amount of labor involved in construction events appears to have declined while at the same time there was an increase in nonarchitectural indicators of rank such as imported prestige goods.

If the function of the monumental structures shifted from public ritual loci to private residences through time as a result of increasing elite alienation from the masses, then perhaps the general populace also became less committed to their construction. Experimentation with new building materials and construction styles might have been one way of offsetting labor losses. Alternatively, public works projects coordinated by the elite at this time might have been of such a nature as to be less visible in the archaeological record, as for example would be true of large-scale agricultural production to feed growing populations and to provide for the defense or expansion of territorial boundaries. The proliferation of Late Formative sites throughout the Comayagua Valley prior to the collapse ofYarumela ca. A.D. 250 may also help explain the possible loss of available labor at the regional center. Although no archaeological excavations have been conducted at these sites, looting and partial destruction of several monumental structures recorded between 1985 and 1987 (Dixon l 989b) have revealed a similar variety of construction styles and building materials that may indicate that sociopolitical events at Yarumela were part of a broader regional trend at this time.
