EDITOR'S CORNER 
heart, however, for with this issue the society has made the critical quantum leap into the ethereal realm of desktop publishing, a step that may eventually help to eliminate many of the time-thieving facets of the past operation. Somewhere in the combination of this change with Gary's advance editing of issues for the next volume and the emergence of the dual editorship lie all the keys, I am convinced, to improve the punctuality of the journal in order to match the quality of its contents. 
Pen a Missive to Your Local Librarian 
I have written a good deal about means of extending the subscription list for LAA, and I hope that by now some of you have adopted a Latin American individual or institution as the recipient of a sub­scription for which you have undertaken to pay. Beyond the audiences reached by this and other efforts, however, lies a vast and largely untapped field of potential subscribers: North American institutional libraries. I know that we are not in the best of economic times, and that many librarians are actively seeking to reduce their journal lists. I also know, though, that the cost of LAA is minuscule alongside those of journals in the sciences; when my institution's library puts out a request for list cuts, my department's attempts to pare back a bit are always met with the gentle message that those sorts of amounts don't really count on the budgetary battlefield. If they do not count as cuts, then they should not count as additions. Take up your pens (well, all right, PCs; I am just stuck on a pen theme as a result of the first section of this editorial) and write your institution's librarian today; sometimes it can be absolutely salutary to be told that you do not count. 
Out of the Penumbra and into the Light 
Before you receive this issue you will have seen the new membership arrangements, which allow a choice between American Antiquity and Latin American Antiquity. This shift should, I think, dispel the notion common in Latin America, which is that the SAA's original journal is the flagship, and LAA nothing more than a dinghy wallowing in the great vessel's wake. I hope this will mean that we-or Gary and Linda, I mean-receive many more manuscripts from Latin American authors, and especial­ly manuscripts in Spanish. The flow from Latin American sources continues to be encouraging, but too many of the papers are in English, presumably because the authors see that language as the better medi­um for full communication within our field. That perception is not, and cannot be allowed to appear to be, correct. If LAA is truly to serve as a bridge among all of us whose focus is Latin America, and if it is not to convey the unacceptable message that Spanish is somehow a secondary language for the reporting of work done in a Spanish-speaking world, it must be a truly bilingual journal. I hope that as one concomitant of the journal's new status we shall see acceptance by all of our contributors and read­ers of the two languages as absolutely at par-and that we shall begin to see work by Brazilian authors in the pages of LAA as well.
