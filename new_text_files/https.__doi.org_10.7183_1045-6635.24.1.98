
THE DEEP PREHISTORY OF INDIAN GAMING: 
POSSIBLE LATE ARCHAIC PERIOD GAME BOARDS AT THE 
TLACUACHERO SHELLMOUND, CHIAPAS, MEXICO 

Barbara Voorhies 
Ten or more features, each consisting originally of an open circle formed by a series of small holes, are present on two Late Archaic superimposed prepared floors at a shellmound on the outer coast ofChiapas, Mexico. These puzzling features bear a strong resemblance to ethnographic and ethnohistoric scoreboards used in indigenous dice games .Accordingly, the approx­imately 5,000 year-old features also were most likely game boards. Archaeologists have traced other Mesoamerican games into deep prehistory, including rubber ball games and another dice game known in Aztec times as patolli. These data pro­vide evidence for the cultural importance and longevity of gaming in Mesoamerica. 
Los diez o mas elementos arqueol6gicos encontrados en dos pisos preparados y superpuestos en un conchal del Arcaico Tardio en la costa de Chiapas, Mexico, consistfan originalmente de anillos abiertosformados par una serie de pequefios agujeros. Dichos elementos se parecen mucho a tableros etnograficos y etnohist6ricos de juegos de dados utilizados par sociedades indfgenas. Par lo tanto, es probable que estos tableros de hace casi 5,000 afios hayan usado tambien para juegos de dados. Los arque6logos han detectado evidencia de otros juegos en la antigiiedad, incluyendo juegos de pelota de hule y un juego de dados conocido par las aztecas coma patolli. Estos datos indican la importancia cultural y la longevidad de las juegos en Mesoamerica .

n this article I describe archaeological features Iimprinted on two deeply buried floors within a Late Archaic period (ca. 3500-2000/1500 B .C.)1 shellmound in southern Mexico and demon­strate their striking resemblance to ethnographic and ethnohistoric game boards used in dice games. Based on these analogies, I propose that these ancient features provide archaeological documen­tation for the deep prehistory of a game that most likely involved the use of dice. The prepared floors that bear these singular fea­tures are positioned in a restricted area under the summit of Tlacuachero (Figure 1), a shellmound located on the outer coast of Chiapas, Mexico (Voorhies 2004). The floors are deeply buried, with the upper floor approximately 4.50 m below the site summit (Figure 2) and the lower one only a few centimeters below it. The features under con­sideration consist of curved alignments of evenly spaced small holes imprinted on the floors. These cavities are each about 5 cm deep and have con­cave bottoms (see Voorhies 2004:Figure 2.16). The size and shape of each hole suggest that they might have been made by poking an index finger into the wet, clay-like substance from which the floors were constructed.2 For this reason !refer to these cavi­ties as finger-holes, in order to distinguish them from other types of features also present on the floors. For example, the finger-holes differ from postholes, which are larger in diameter than the fin­ger-holes and completely penetrate the floors, whereas the finger-holes do not. 
The only surviving fully intact feature is an open oval formed by 24 fairly evenly spaced holes (Fig­ure 3; see also Voorhies 2012:48), whereas the other alignments of holes have been partially obliterated and only remnant arcs remain. The intact, undis­turbed finger-hole feature is on Floor 1, the upper­most floor, near the center of the excavation exposure. This intact figure also has an imprint in its center where a rock was once located, but like other rocks originally present on Floor 1, it had been

removed before the floor was abandoned and sub­sequently buried. These finger-hole features are not randomly distributed across the floor areas that have been exposed by excavation, but rather are centrally located within the exposure and are to some degree spatially apart from other kinds of floor features, such as concentrations of postholes and rock emplacements. Moreover, on both floors, several of the finger-hole features partially overlap (Figure 4), suggesting that people remade these features in the same approximate locations pre­sumably at different times while the floors were still in use. It is also significant that the few finger-hole features on the surface of Floor 2 are positioned nearly directly under a similar feature in the floor above. This raises the possibility that the spatial

organization of activities was similar on both floors, a suggestion also raised by the patterns of postholes. However, because the exposure of Floor 2 is so much smaller than that of Floor 1, it is not possi­ble to assess fully the degree to which the two floors exhibit similar spatial patterns. 
This is the only location at Tlacuachero or other investigated Late Archaic period shellmounds on the Chiapas coast where prepared floors of this nature have been found (Voorhies 2004). Elsewhere at that site, and in the other excavated neighboring Late Archaic period shellmounds, the deposits con­sist only of bedded shell layers. Since the super­imposed floors at Tlacuachero are so deeply buried 
(4.50 m), it is difficult to determine their extent, but a program of auger probes suggests that the total area of all these floor constructions is approxi­mately 900 square meters (Figure 1). Recent work at the site makes it clear that these successive floors are not perfectly congruent, and that there are at least three of them in this same general area at the center of the island. However, relatively large areas of the surfaces have been exposed in only the two uppermost floors. 
The Tlacuachero shellmound is one of six sim­ilar archaeological sites on the Chiapas coast that formed in the middle and late Holocene, that is, between 7 ,500 and 3,500 years ago (Voorhies 2004:l 4ff) and have been investigated by archae­ologists (Clark 1994; Drucker 1948; Lorenzo 1955; Voorhies 2004). All of these mounds formed as islands within the coastal wetlands and some are still islands, but the oldest one is now landlocked (Clark 1994; Voorhies 2004). The shellmounds are locations where ancient people, whom I named the Chantuto people (Voorhies 1976, 2004), repeat­edly cooked and probably sun-dried aquatic resources such as fish, clams, and shrimp that they procured from nearby lagoons. The huge accumu­lations of clamshells result from cooking the clams on these sites and then leaving behind the shells after the clam meat had been removed. It seems

Iikely that the cooked clam meat was then dried and taken to the residential bases for trade or auto-con­sumption. Additionally, I suspect that shrimp and fish were sun-dried, but we also lack direct evi­dence for this. What is absolutely clear, however, is that the Chantuto people visited the shellmounds often, but they did not live on them permanently. In other words, these locations were similar to fish camps, a special-use settlement type well docu­mented both ethnographically and prehistorically, for example, among some native peoples of the Northwest Coast (e.g., Ames and Maschner 1999; Knudson et al. 2004). Analogous, short term logis­tical encampments that enabled a focus on the pro­curement and processing of aquatic resources were also part of the settlement pattern of people living recently in the same wetlands where some of the Archaic shellmounds are located. There, the focal resource is also sharply seasonal, but in that case it is shrimp, rather than anadromous fish of the Northwest Coast. Accordingly, I interpret these shellmounds as short-term logistical sites (see Voorhies 2004), but recently this view has been challenged (Clark and Hodgson 2009). 
Ethnographic Comparisons 
The finger-hole features at Tlacuachero resemble improvised dice game scoreboards made on the surface of the ground by several recent, historic eth­nic groups of native peoples in the Greater South­west. Some groups, such as the Western Apache, Havasupai, and Walapai (Hualupai) of Arizona, the Keres of New Mexico, and the Tigua of Texas, arrange rocks in a pattern on the ground surface that then serve as scoreboards for expedient dice games (Culin 1907). The shape of these scoreboards varies: some are circular or semi-circular, and oth­ers rectangular. Often they have a central striking stone onto which the dice are tossed (Figure 5). One group, the Seri of Sonora, Mexico, lay out impro­vised scoreboards using slices of organ pipe cac­tus (Felger and Moser 1985:160, Figure 13.1), or rocks if organ pipe stems were unavailable. Other Southwest groups, such as the Pima and Papago of Arizona, and the Tarahumara and Tepehuan of Chi­huahua, Mexico (Figure 6), construct scoreboards for improvised dice games by poking a pattern of small holes on a patch of cleared ground (Culin 1907). In all these ethnographically known cases,

the players move counters around the scoreboards according to the value of each throw of dice. When rocks are used to construct the game boards, the counters are placed in the spaces between the rocks, and where holes are used, tokens are dropped into the holes. These are all race games in that the win­ner of the game is the player whose token first reaches a specified goal, or position on the game board. In most cases the diameter or width of the game board is between 1.0 and 1.5 m, a size that allows the players to easily move their tokens around the entire circuit without having to get up off the ground. Typically, larger game boards are used when there are many players. 
The resemblance between the archaeological features at Tlacuachero and some of the ethno­graphic examples from the Greater Southwest is very striking. This is especially the case for the Walapai game board reported by Culin ( 1907 :208), which is nearly identical in size and shape to the complete feature that I discovered at Tlacuachero (Figure 7). Both are open circles with a central stone placed in the center. The Walapai game board measures about 1.23 m in diameter, whereas the one from Tlacuachero is 1.40 m. One difference is that the Walapai game board is made with rocks, whereas the scoreboards from Tlacuachero are made by poking holes in the prepared floor. This is not surprising, because rocks are not naturally available on the soft outer coast of Chiapas. 
For dice (Culin 1907:207), Walapai women use wooden billets that are approximately 10 cm (4 in) long and 2.5 cm (1 in) or less in width with one side rounded and the other flat with painted deco­rations. These would be very unlikely to survive in the archeological record except under very unusual circumstances. As expected, I have not found any objects in the Archaic period deposits at Tlacuachero that might have served as dice and are contemporary with the scoreboards. It is notewor­thy, however, that three small ceramic disks that come from later deposits at the site might have been used as dice by successors to the Chantuto people (Figure 8) since their size, shape, and dee-

oration on only one side compare favorably with worked ceramic dice in the ethnographic record, as documented by Culin ( 1907). 
The ethnographic record compiled by Culin (1907) makes it abundantly clear that dice games were played widely in indigenous North America. Of all the types of games he recorded in his mon­umental study of indigenous games ofNorthAmer­ica, the most common and geographically widespread are dice games, which were played by groups distributed across the continent from the Atlantic coast to the Pacific coast, and from the sub­Arctic to northern Mexico, where his survey ended. In many instances, the only information available to Culin about the presence of dice games in a par­ticular society was the mere presence of dice curated in a museum, but in a few other cases he found details about score keeping, and even more rarely, how and by whom the game was played. 
Women were the primary, but not sole, players 

of dice games in traditional indigenous North American societies. In a crosscultural sample of dice games in 131 societies, De Boer (2001) found that in 81 percent of these societies, dice games were played by women only, in 12 percent the games were played by both men and women, and dice games were played exclusively by men in only 7 percent of the sampled societies. Invariably, how­ever, women played against other women and men against men. Frequently, dice games were played during festivals when large numbers of people con­gregated. Often the games were raucous events with heavy gambling on the part of both the play­ers and onlookers. Even when the players were women, male onlookers often engaged in spirited gambling (DeBoer 2001 :245). For example, Black­foot women dice game players were "surrounded by men and women who bet robes, parfleches, travois, weapons, horses and other valuables on their favorite" (Ewers 1958: 155).

For dice, native North Americans used two­

sided objects with faces that are distinguished by 
markings, each side being attributed to some 
numerical value (Culin 1907).According to Culin's 
survey, split reeds were relatively frequent. In such 
cases, the value of the throw of dice was determined 
by how many dice were convex or concave 
upwards. Very often, wooden sticks or tablets, 
which were painted or incised on one side, were 
employed as dice. Other two-sided objects used for 
dice were beaver teeth, nuts, seeds, shells, worked 
bone, and worked pottery sherds. 
Native North Americans kept track of the play­ers' scores in one of two ways depending where they lived (Culin 1907). Tallies were used through­out the mid continent and farther east (Figure 9). 
These were usually sticks of some sort, or some­times long, thin animal bones. The tallies were assigned numerical values and passed from hand to hand depending on each player's score. Native peoples in the western part of the continent and southward into Mesoamerica typically used some form of scoreboard. In addition to the makeshift scoreboards mentioned above, more permanent 
scoreboards were incised or pecked into rocks, or 
in the case of peoples with substantial architecture, 
on floors or on top of masonry benches. 
Some groups of native North Americans employ scoreboards in dice games that are much less durable and perhaps can be considered ephemeral in the sense that the expectation of their survival in the archaeological record is extremely low. For example, the modern Mopan Maya of southern Belize play a dice game that uses an expediently constructed scoreboard consisting of a line of dried maize kernels (Verbeeck 1998). This is a men's rit­ual game that is associated with planting com and played on the evening before the planting occurs. It is played in an atmosphere of joy and is very loud, the objective appearing to be the foreshadowing of the joy occasioned by a bountiful harvest of corn (Verbeeck 1998:87). For counters, each player selects similar twigs, leaf stems, or grass, with each player choosing a type of object different from that of other players. The counters are moved in the spaces between the kernels. The Mopan Maya dice are corn kernels that are marked only on one side. 
The counters and dice are discarded after the game
