
EATING FISH IN THE DRIEST DESERT IN THE WORLD: 
OSTEOLOGICAL AND BIOGEOCHEMICAL ANALYSES OF HUMAN 
SKELETAL REMAINS FROM THE SAN SALVADOR CEMETERY, 
NORTH CHILE 

Christina Torres-Rouff, William J. Pestle, and Francisco Gallardo 
The San Salvador River in northern Chile is a tributary of the Loa, the only river that traverses the Atacama Desert from the mountains to the Pacific. Recent investigations along the San Salvador River revealed the presence of a Formative period village site and associated cemetery approximately 110 km inland from the Pacific Ocean. Bioarchaeological and biogeo­chemical analyses conducted on human skeletal remains recovered from the San Salvador Cemetery allowed us to better understand the site's role as an intermediary for coast/interior relations during the Middle Formative ( 500 B. C.-A.D. I 00 ). Evidence from material culture and human remains at San Salvador suggests that this population was involved in exchange networks that united the oases of the Atacama Desert with the Pacific Ocean. Isotopic data support this notion, as the pop­ulation demonstrates great variability in both the protein (marine and terrestrial) and carbohydrate components of their diet. During this period, communal economies produced surpluses used in a network of exchange for foods, prestige goods, and ideas. These ties were not coincidental but, rather; part of a regional economic structure that remains only partly explored. 
El Rfo San Salvador del norte de Chile es un ajluente de! Rfo Loa, el unico curso de agua dulce que atraviesa el desierto de Atacama desde las montafias has ta el Pacifico. Recientes investigaciones en San Salvador revelaron la presencia de una aldea y un cementerio de/ periodo Formativo emp/azados a unos 110 km. de la costa de/ Pacifico.

La evi­dencia de la cultura material y de las restos humanos en San Salvador indica que esta poblaci6n estuvo involucrada en las redes de intercambio que ligaban las oasis def desierto de Atacama y el Oceano Pacifico. Los datos isot6picos apoyan esto, pues la poblaci6n muestra una gran variabilidad tanto en el consumo de protefna (marina y terrestre) como en los compo­nentes de carbohidratos en su dieta. Durante este perfodo las econom{as comunales produjeron excedentes utilizados en una red de intercambio de alimentos, bienes de prestigio e ideas. Estos Lazos no fueron circunstanciales, sino parte de una estruc­tura econ6mica regional que hasta ahora ha sido parcialmente explorada.

between population centers that, while not princi­pal nodes, may have served as loci for different forms of relationships between groups (e.g., Cases et al. 2008; Nielsen 2004; Upham 1992). Lazzari has argued that for Formative period northwest Argentina, scholars need "to think of circulation networks ... as more flexible and complicated and as a reflection of the constitution and preproduction of different social bonds" (2005a:202). Considera­tion of varied mobility strategies may provide one means of approaching this flexibility. Nielsen (2004:33) stresses the value of intemodal spaces for helping understand the negotiation of social rela­tions by considering the role of individual actors and argues that this type of study requires the use of mul­tiple lines of evidence. Here, by focusing on skele­tal remains from a small cemetery associated with a settlement that likely facilitated some movements of peoples, goods, and ideas across the Atacama Desert during the Formative period ( 1500 B.C.-A.D. 500), we complement archaeological research in the region by providing bioarchaeolog­ical and biogeochemical perspectives on movement and exchange between northern Chile's coast and interior. In doing so, we explore the idea that these varied movements between population groups and across the open desert included individuals in trade outposts located in otherwise unpopulated areas. The individuals and settlements found therein can help to shed light on the way that prehistoric peo­ples used these spaces and the dynamic created when groups interacted. Pimentel and colleagues (20 10) posit that in northern Chile's Formative period there were at least two forms of mobility, one being a small-scale pedestrian movement instigated by coastal populations in search of resources and the other encompassing the highland caravan modality. Evidence from this series of excavations

suggests that the sites along the San Salvador were logistically situated occupations resulting from increasing social complexity and increasingly com­plex patterns of interaction between the coast and highlands, processes that had already begun at the end of the Archaic period (Ballester and Gallardo 2011 ; de Souza et al. 2010; Gallardo 2009). As such, the San Salvador sites served as stable and strate­gic outposts for the travelers who connected the Middle Loa with the coast. This small sample pro­vides us with an interesting view on mobility in the Formative period. 
San Salvador 
The San Salvador is a tributary of the Loa River (Figure I), the only river that traverses the breadth of the hyperarid Atacama Desert of northern Chile from the mountains to the Pacific. During the For­mative period in this region we see burgeoning numbers of permanent and semipermanent settle­ments in combination with plant and animal domes­tication, as well as intensified camelid pastoralism (Gallardo 2009; Lumbreras 2006; Nunez, Carta­jena, Carrasco, de Souza, and Grosjean 2006). Pas­toralism and plant collecting form the basis of this period's economy, despite the beginnings of small­scale agriculture and the intensification of hunting (Aguero 2005; Nunez, Cartajena, Carrasco, and de Souza 2006; Sinclaire 2004). Archaeological evi­dence from the Formative period has demonstrated a flow of goods through this region between more consolidated centers, or nodes, such as Tarapaca in the north and the San Pedro de Atacama oases in the interior (Aguero et al. 2004). By the Middle For­mative (500 B.C.-A.D. 100), there is evidence of exchange throughout the region, from the Pacific coast to northwest Argentina. This accumulation of social and economic changes is likely tied to the rise of surplus economies, not only among settled agriculturalists but also for the marine hunter-gath­erers of the coast (Gallardo 2009). Both of these patterns are evident in sites such as those discussed here, sites that occupy "empty" spaces between populations and foment interregional interaction. 
During archaeological survey along the San Sal­vador River, the remains of a small village and cemetery were documented approximately 110 km inland along the river at 1,370 m asl (Figure 1 ). Other than a brief note on a looted tomb (Spahni 1964 ), this survey provided the first evidence of pre­historic human occupation along the San Salvador. The San Salvador sites are found 40 km west of Calama in empty desert close to a prehispanic route that linked the Calama oasis west to the coast at Cobija (1 10 km) and northwest to the Quillagua oasis (93 km). Their size, specialized production, and material culture suggest their logistical char­acter in service to the population of Calama. This is particularly true if one considers that the archae­ological localities mentioned above have Forma­tive period cemeteries that have yielded hundreds of human remains. These suggest increasing pop­ulation resulting from sedentism and the intensifi­cation of production during the Formative (e.g., Gallardo et al. 1993; Moragas 1982). 
Excavation and surface collection were con­ducted at the San Salvador Village and Cemetery in 2008. Radiocarbon dates place both sites squarely in the Middle Formative period (cemetery: 2080 ± 40 B.P. [Beta-247417], 164 cal B.C.-cal

6.0 using the SHCal04 curve [McCormac et al. 2004; Stuiver et al. 2005]). The village was dated using a roof tie found in one of the rooms, offer­ing evidence for the earliest portion of the Salvador occupations. This suggests that the two dates are consistent, given that the cemetery, which is spa­tially and culturally associated with the village, should postdate the original construction of the habitations. 
The San Salvador Village (Aldea San Salvador), located on a terrace above the river west of the cemetery, comprises approximately 15-20 circu­lar pits with poles sustaining thatched roofs. This style of construction is consistent with the struc­ture of other habitation sites along the Middle Loa River (Pollard 1970). Excavation of a trash mid­den confirmed the presence of camelids and an unusual abundance of algarrobo seeds (Prosopis flexuosa), a local fruit, as well as the remains of marine fish, likely transported to the site as a dried good. Multiple species of marine fish (Trachurus simetricus, Cilus gilberti, and Graus nigra) and shells, including some carved into small beads that could have been used as adornments (Turritela cin­gulata, Oliva peruviana, Loxechinus albu, and

Choromytilus chorus), were found at the site, sug­gesting a tie to coastal populations. Our excavations revealed no remains of freshwater fish. Finds at the village site also included vegetable and wool cordage, leather, feathers, a projectile point, carved wooden instruments, cactus spines, and gourds. It is probable that the settlement was placed at this part of the river's course because of its proximity to grazing lands and to a small forest of algarrobo trees (de Ugarte and Gallardo 2010). The incredi­ble preponderance of algarrobo among the botan­ical remains in concert with the presence of grinding stones suggests the site's role as a pro­duction site for algarrobo flour, which could then be used as an exchange good as well as serving as a dietary staple. Foreshadowing the isotopic results discussed below, no evidence of maize (Zea mays) was recovered in the cemetery or residential exca­vations (de Ugarte and Gallardo 2010) despite 5-mm mesh screening and its archaeological visi­bility at other sites in the region, where it is fre­quently included as a grave offering. 
The San Salvador Cemetery (Cementerio San Salvador) is located just upriver from the village site. Found on an elevated ridge above the river itself, the cemetery likely comprises some 20-25 interments in small ovoid pits demarcated by wooden posts. Some portion of the cemetery was looted during the nitrate boom of the 1930s, as determined through glass bottles found at the site. As a result, many human remains were exposed and commingled on the surface. We recovered all human remains and remaining artifacts from eight of these tombs as well as the surrounding areas. Tombs appear to have included, among other things, pottery, baskets, lithics, beads, and textiles in the form of clothing and bags. Also providing evidence for a coastal tie, loco (Concholepas con­cholepas) shells filled with pigment were among the grave goods. In line with the finds at the village site, we found a small bundle of algarrobo seed­pods tied together with cord among the offerings in one tomb but no evidence of maize, a common inclusion in other regional graves. Contemporary burials from sites in Calama have produced mate­rial culture (including textiles, ceramics., and bas­ketry) that parallels that seen in the mortuary contexts at San Salvador (Gonzalez and Westfall 2006; Thomas et al. 1995). However, reflecting the Formative period's patterns of increasing interre­gional interaction, goods found at the San Salvador Cemetery come from diverse areas. 
Considered together, these excavations yielded evidence of interaction not just with the coast as detailed above but also with northwest Argentina. Among the trans-Andean finds were the leg of a ceramic figurine, a tubular black polished pipe frag­ment, and black polished ceramic fragments in shapes similar to those found in the CalchaqufVal­ley (e.g., Baldini 2007). In concert with the coastal material, these archaeological details support the idea that the San Salvador sites were logistical out­posts that facilitated movement between the coast and the interior. Evidence from the site indicates intensive exploitation of the valley's plant resources, maintenance of camelid herds, regular access to coastal products, and a close relationship with contemporary populations from the coastal areas of Cobija and the mouth of the Loa River as well as with other oases, such as Quillagua, Calama, and Chiu-Chiu (Aguero et al. 2004; Moragas 1982; Pollard 1970; Spahni 1964, 1967; Thomas et al. 1995). Below we present the results of skeletal analyses of the 17 fragmented human remains recovered from the San Salvador Cemetery to explore the inhabitants of this area in more detail. We follow this with a detailed analysis of paleodiet as determined through stable isotope analyses of carbon and nitrogen. 
Skeletal Analyses 
The remains of 17 individuals were recovered from eight tombs and surrounding areas at the San Sal­vador Cemetery (Table 1 ). All human skeletal remains were assessed using standard bioarchaeo­logical protocols (Buikstra and Ubelaker 1994; Buzon et al. 2005). Minimum number of individu­als was calculated for each of the tombs and sur­rounding areas. Sex was determined based on the sexually dimorphic features of the os coxae and the skull. Similarly, broad age assessments were made based on pelvic morphology, epiphyseal fusion, and cranial suture closure. Remains were also analyzed and scored for visible pathology and trauma. All observable pathology was documented using stan­dard methods and terminology (Buikstra and Ube­laker 1994). Finally, each skull was examined visually for the presence and type (annular vs. tab­ular) of deliberate cranial shaping using adjustments

to the broad classification system that originates with Dembo and Imbelloni (1938). In all cases, preservation differentially affected the sample. 

The San Salvador skeletal material is primarily postcranial, likely the result of the aforementioned looting. The 17 individuals recovered from San Salvador Cemetery ranged in completeness from individual 5.1, represented by very nearly an entire skeleton, part of which was naturally mummified, to several individuals represented by minimal frag­ments (i.e., individuals 6.1 and 7.1). While a num­ber of remains could not be sexed or aged (or could only be determined to be adults), analysis of the sample revealed a number of juveniles (n = 6) as well as members of both sexes (Table 1 ). 

Pathology in the sample appears to have been limited to degenerative processes (osteoarthritis) and traumatic injury. There is no evidence of infec­tious disease in any of the skeletal remains. Nev­ertheless, the remains seem to show effects from living in a harsh environment. Qualitative appraisal of muscle insertion sites and musculoskeletal stress markers on available adult long bone fragments suggests pronounced robusticity and perhaps sub­stantial muscle use for two of the three adult males in this population (Hawkey and Merbs 1995). 1 Given that these results may be a reflection of long­term body use, they might be considered a product of frequent activities in difficult terrain as opposed to a sign of significant labor intensity (e.g., Niin­imiiki 2011). Osteoarthritis is visible on most adult remains; however, vertebrae were the only affected elements. This takes the form of coalescing poros­ity and lipping on vertebral bodies and articular sur­faces, except in the case of individual 5.1, where this is augmented with the formation of osteophytes and the fusion of the articular surfaces of the first and second cervical vertebra. 
Other pathological changes noted in this sam­ple result from traumatic injury. All three adult male individuals whose remains were more com­plete showed evidence of fractures. Some injuries were quite significant, including a healed mandibu­lar fracture below individual 5.1 's left mental fora­men (Figure 2). Individual 3.1 suffered a series of complete fractures to the ribs ultimately resulting in misalignment of the ends during healing, pro­ducing substantial overlap medially (Figure 3). Individual 1.1 also showed healed rib fractures as well as injuries of his left distal ulna and radius, resulting in what appears to be a nonunion fracture of the distal metaphysis of the ulna. While this could be a parry fracture, a defensive injury (Buik­stra and Ubelaker 1994; Judd 2008), the involve­ment of the radius suggests otherwise. It has been argued that cranial injuries are more indicative of intentional injury or violence, but there is no clear evidence of interpersonal violence among these individuals. It is possible that these injuries are products of the rocky landscape at San Salvador or similar areas. Unsurprisingly, analyses of cranial vault modification were hampered by the lack of crania. No cranial fragments could be definitively assessed for alterations to head shape. However, the one complete cranium (individual 5.1) demon­strated tabular erect cranial modification with a small degree of pressure resulting in a slight flat­tening of the anterior and posterior aspects of the skull (Figure 4 ). This form of head shaping is not unusual in north Chile's interior (Torres-Rouff 2007). Given that cranial modification results from the inscription of cultural signifiers on the bodies of infants, it reflects strong, and likely less ephemeral, associations and as such may be sug­gestive of long-standing familial ties to a particu­lar place or group in the interior. 

While the skeletal remains do not provide direct evidence of origin or exchange, a few salient pieces of information can be derived from them. As men­tioned above, our demographic data reveal the pres­ence of potential family groups at the cemetery, suggesting a degree of permanence and stability for this settlement. This is bolstered somewhat by pat­terns of osteoarthritis and traumatic injury, both of which intimate a long-standing relationship with the landscape of the San Salvador Valley. The one complete cranium showed evidence of tabular erect modification, which is also suggestive of inland ties. During the Formative period, tabular forms are the most common shape seen among populations in the interior, and they stand in sharp contrast to the annu­lar (circumferential) forms that are typical of con­temporary coastal sites (Torres-Rouff 2003, 2007).

Carbon isotope signatures also dif­fer significantly between organisms from marine and terrestrial ecosystems as a result of dramatic dif­ferences in their carbon sources (Chisholm et al. 1982; Schoeninger and DeNiro 1984). 
Stable nitrogen isotopes vary in a fairly pre­dictable manner according to trophic level and are particularly useful for identifying marine food con­sumption given the clear differences in marine and terrestrial organisms' nitrogen isotope signatures (Minagawa and Wada 1984; Schoeninger and DeNiro 1984; Schoeninger et al. 1983), although there are also climatic factors, aridity being most pertinent here, that can affect nitrogen isotope val­ues (Ambrose 1991; Ambrose and DeNiro 1987). Since both plants and animals vary from region to region in their carbon and nitrogen signatures as a result of a number of environmental factors, local isotopic signatures are a necessary part of pale­odietary reconstructions. 
Turning to the human consumers, different frac­tions of skeletal or dental tissues reflect different portions and/or different temporal dimensions of an individual's diet. Carbon isotope signatures in bone apatite (813Cap) reflect carbon sources in the whole diet (these are predominantly carbohydrate­based in humans).2 Carbon and nitrogen isotopes of bone collagen (o13Cco and o15Nc0) overwhelm­ingly reflect dietary protein sources (Ambrose and Norr 1993; Kellner and Schoeninger 2007). While the chemical makeup of bone collagen and hydrox­yapatite reflects average diet over the last 10-30 years of an individual's lifetime, the isotopic sig­nature of tooth root (dentine) collagen and enamel apatite reflects diet at the time of a particular tooth's formation. Therefore, chemical analyses of differ­ent body tissues and biomolecules provide insights into diet and mobility data over different portions of an individual life. 
For this study, bone collagen, tooth root (den­tine) collagen, and bone, tooth root (dentine), and enamel hydroxyapatite were extracted and purified in the National Science Foundation Stable Isotope Preparation Lab at the Field Museum of Natural
