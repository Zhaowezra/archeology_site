his comment is in response to “When Wasthe Sun Pyramid Built? Maintaining the Status Quo at Teotihuacan, Mex­ico” (Sload 2015), which argues that traditional models of Teotihuacan chronology must be maintained despite new radiocarbon dates from primarycontexts (Sugiyamaetal. 2013).Herewe evaluatethe datingoftwocontestedfeatures:the Sun Pyramid and thesubterranean tunnel located below it. 
In our original article (Sugiyamaetal. 2013), we discussed two kinds of chronological data: relative dates based on ceramic classi.cations of 37,746 sherds analyzed at that time and absolute dates of seven radiocarbon samples obtained from primary contexts.Sload(2015:224–225) introduces a “conundrum” posed by these two datasets.Themajority (94.7%)ofsherdsfromthe pyramid .ll are classi.ed as Tzacualli types tra­ditionally dated to AD 1–150 (Rattray 2001:53– 57), but the radiocarbon dates indicate that the construction of the pyramid took place later, between AD 170 and 310. 
We have already considered this seeming conundrum (Sugiyama et al. 2013:429). First, we note that older ceramics could have been incorporated from distinct .llsources.Our sec­ondhypothesisis that “the chronological ranges that canbe de.ned with radiocarbon datingspan much longer periods than the ceramic phases themselves....Thisisthe result of therel­atively few radiocarbon dates available from secure primary contexts in comparison to the ceramic chronology based on a robust sample” (Sugiyama et al. 2013:429). Sload does not discussthissecond possibility. 
Here is the bottom line: radiocarbon dating is absolute while ceramic chronologies are rela­tive.Arelative ceramic chronology is anchored to and calibrated by its correspondence with absolute dates. This is why robust Bayesian statistical models utilizing radiocarbon samples fromprimary contextsare necessaryto re.nethe datingofceramic phases.Wedonot questionthe validity of the ceramic phases themselves, but instead callforareevaluationof the traditional

absolute dates to which they are tethered by incorporating new absolute dates from primary contexts. 
WepresentaBayesianstatistical model using primary contexts from the subterranean tunnel (Sugiyamaetal. 2013:Figure 14b).Weexcluded allsamples from .lllayers added duringtermi­nation activities because they are notorious for the “old wood” problem, “biasing archaeolog­ical chronologies towards excessive antiquity” (Schiffer 1986:19). We argue that ordering the samples based on the radiocarbon results and labelingthem arbitrarily as re.ecting “creation,” “use,” and “termination” (Sload 2015:Table1), withoutexplanationofhowthiswasdetermined, is problematic.Standardarchaeological practice places the context of the sample itself, not the radiocarbon result, as the principal criterion determining whetherthesamplere.ectscreation, use, or termination. 
Here we highlight only a couple of exam­ples to demonstrate the hazardous and circular consequences of disregarding stratigraphic and contextual data(see SupplementalTable1). In several cases, samples are classi.ed by Sload differently yet come fromsimilar contexts.Even worse,samplesfromlowerlayersare classi.edas coming from “termination” contexts while more super.cial layers are classi.ed as “creation” simply becausetheyhaveolder radiocarbon dates (e.g., Beta 220743, 220744, and 220745). It is tellingthatthemajorityofthe dates(n = 11) are considered to re.ect “termination” events, but only four samples, exclusively from .ll layers, coincide with “creation” dates. Such con.icting radiocarbon results from .ll layers are precisely why such tertiary .ll contexts (as opposed to primary or even secondary contexts) should be excluded from consideration. 
Sload(2015) recognizes that the dates she associates with “termination” events overlap signi.cantly with the Sun Pyramid dates. She hypothesizes that these “late” dates correspond toamid-third-centurytunneling operationrather than pyramid construction. This hypothetical tunnel scenario is inconsistent with rigorous stratigraphic documentation and context-driven interpretation of the primary radiocarbon dates. The Sun Pyramid radiocarbon samples come from primary contexts up to 110 m inside the pyramid including bones from burials, organic material in offerings, and a hearth placed on top of an intact .oor that was burned in situ (Sugiyamaet al. 2013:423–425).Despite these secure contexts, it is argued that our “scant” data from Noguera’s 1.2 m wide tunnel was too narrow to capture the distinction between a third-century tunnel and the original Sun Pyramid .ll(Sload 2015:236). 
The Sun Pyramid has been explored exten­sively for over a century (see summary in Sugiyamaetal. 2013).Intrusivetunnelsare read­ily recognizedbyproperly trained archaeologists (e.g., Sugiyama 1998). We described multiple undisturbed pre-Sun Pyramid structures. These were encased in a compact and homogeneous matrix consistent with original .llsampled from 60 pits and three tunnels: an exploration that extended both north–south and east–west.This article does not recognize thatexcavationswould have breached theextentof Noguera’stunnel on multiple occasions. 
Yetthe conundrum persists despite an attempt to explain it away. The .ll of this hypothetical third-century tunnel continues to hold exclu­sively Tzacualli ceramics. Similarly, despite describing many “termination” walls and .oors, Miccaotli and Early Tlamimilolpa sherds have not been found in the subterranean tunnel.
