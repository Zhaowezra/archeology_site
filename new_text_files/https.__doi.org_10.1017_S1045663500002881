SURVIVAL AND REVIVAL OF TERMINAL CLASSIC TRADITIONS 
AT POS T CLASSIC MAYAPAN 

Susan Milbrath and Carlos Peraza Lope 
Recent INAH excavations and reanalysis of data from the Carnegie Institution archaeological project document the sur­
vival and revival of Classic and Terminal Classic traditions at Postclassic Mayapan, the last Maya capital in Mexico. The 
survival of some Terminal Classic ceramic types and architectural forms at Mayapan around A.D. II 00-1200 reflects a 
pattern of continuity. A revival of earlier traditions is notable in the erection of stelae marking the katun endings and in 
Postclassic architecture that incorporates iconographic elements from Terminal Classic Puuc sites and the city of Chichen 
ltzd. The rulers and priests of Mayapdn displayed their connection with the Terminal Classic Maya heritage to assert polit­
ical power. The Puuc revival at Mayapdn is linked with the Xiu priests, whereas the revival of the Jtza heritage ofChichen 
Jtzd is affiliated with the Cocom rulers. Between A.D. 1250 and 1400, revival-style architecture at Mayapan was inspired 
hy local traditions in the area of Yucatan. After A.D. 1400, trade contact with the East Coast inspired new art forms linked 
with the international style associated with Mixteca-Puebla art.

Yucatan near the end of the Terminal Classic period 
(ca. A.D. 900-950). 
Regional control shifted from Chichen Itza to Mayapan at the beginning of the Postclassic period (Milbrath and Peraza 2003:24). Chichen Itza con­tinued perhaps as late as the twelfth century, over­lapping with Mayapan's early occupation sometime between A.D. 1100 and 1150. Early archaeological deposits at Mayapan indicate that 
Terminal Classic ceramic types survived in low fre­quencies, found mixed with much larger compo­nents of early Postclassic types (Hocaba), indicating a process of cultural transformation rather than a sharp break with past traditions. 
Study ofMayapan's ceramic types and the pat­tern of superimposed architectural construction help establish a chronological distinction between the early and late periods at the site. As will be seen, the earliest architecture is characterized by some 
Terminal Classic forms, such as the stela platform and dance platforms, but their construction follows Postclassic stylistic patterns. These early structures are linked to early plaza floors with sealed deposits of early Postclassic Hocaba ceramics and a small amount of Terminal Classic types (Puuc/Cehpech and Sotuta). Between A.D. 1250 and 1300, these ceramics were gradually replaced by late Post­classic (Tases) ceramics that include new ceramic types, such as large effigy censers and specific trade wares linked with the East Coast (Milbrath and Peraza 2003:6--7; Smith 1971:255). During this later period, when links with past traditions were fading, Mayapan's rulers commissioned revival­style architecture in a conscious effort to reassert ties with Terminal Classic cities that were now largely abandoned. 
The revival of earlier architectural forms and "antique" iconography has a long tradition in Mesoamerica, as evidenced in Late Classic Maya revivals of Early Classic Teotihuacan symbols and Postclassic Aztec revivals ofToltec sculptural forms (Coggins 2002; Stone 1989; Umberger 1987). Regional styles in the art of Mesoamerica, defin­ing the cultural traditions of different areas, can also allude to ethnic identity in the use of symbols that encode the prestige of antiquity and earlier mod­els of political authority (Pasztory 1989). A spe­cific iconographic complex can be used to convey a connection with antiquity, as a form of ancestor recall or "validation through history" (Kowalski and Kristan-Graham 2007 :56--57). To evoke a con­nection with the glorious past, Mayapan's revival­sty le architecture combines anachronistic iconography and specific architectural forms inspired by revered Terminal Classic sites in north­ern Yucatan. 
Mayapan has been described as a monarchy dominated by two paramount families, the Cocoms and Xius, who may have ruled sequentially (Ringle and Bey 2001 :274). A political rivalry between the Xius and Cocoms, the two most important "princely houses" at Mayapan, is documented by Friar Diego de Landa (Tozzer 1941:36--37, 40). Landa tells us that the Xiu priests were powerful but the Cocoms were the rulers of Mayapan until they were ousted in a revolt led by the Xi us around 
A.D. 1450(Tozzer1941:30-31,36--37, 40). 
The Xius and Cocoms probably lived side by side in the initial period ofMayapan's occupation, but it may be impossible to determine which group arrived first. The Cocoms were a faction of ltzas from Chichen Itza, located in the Cupul province to the east (Ringle et al. 1998:190-191, 225). The Xius may have already been in the area, residing at a nearby Puuc site. The Xius have been inter­preted as late arrivals to Yucatan who attempted to enhance their status by claiming links with the ancient city of U xmal (Kowalski 1987), but it now seems more likely that they ruled Uxmal during the 
Terminal Classic period (Kowalski 2003, 2007). Even though the Xi us had Nahuatl names and prob­ably migrated to northern Yucatan from Tabasco. they were no longer really foreigners (Milbrath and Peraza 2003:33). The Xius spoke Maya and had resided in the Puuc area for centuries, where they developed a distinctive architectural style and a short-lived regional state (Kowalski 2003). 
The Xius may have come to Mayapan from Uxmal, which was abandoned or in complete decline by A.D. 1150 (Milbrath and Peraza 2003:24 ). One Spanish chronicler says the Cocom invited the Xius to live at Mayapan because the architecture they had built in the Puuc hills wa much admired (Tozzer 1941 :215). This would seem to make the Cocoms the first inhabitants of Mayapan, an interpretation that finds support in the Chilam Balam texts that speak of early Itza "founding" events at the city (Milbrath and Peraza 2003:36, Table I; Roys 1967:140-141). Nonethe­less, Cehpech (Puuc) ceramics were used abun-

dantly in construction fill at Mayapan, suggesting some fonn of Puuc occupation preceded the found­ing of the Postclassic city (Peraza 2005). Given the quantity of Puuc-style mosaic stones reused in con­struction at Mayapan, there must have been an ear­lier Puuc city very nearby (Shook l 954c:90). Located near Puuc cities such as Uxmal, Sayil, and Kabah, Mayapan developed in part out of a Puuc tradition (Ball 1979:34 ). 
Revival-style structures were not the earliest buildings at Mayapan. They seem to postdate a period of earlier building activity. These should be considered part of a "second wave" of architecture that may be linked with two rival families or fac­tions that came from different areas in northern Yucatan. Revival styles atMayapan seem to express elite concerns reflecting the interests of specialized cults linked with these two factions. These revival­style constructions are characterized by antique iconographic references and architectural forms, incorporated in a style of architecture that is dis­tinctly Postclassic. We will argue that the motiva­tion for creating revival-style architecture using Terminal Classic forms was both political and reli­gious. William Ringle and George Bey (2001 :286) link the Hall of Chaac Masks (Structure Q 151) and the entire architectural complex alongside the Cenote Ch' en Mui to the Xius, whereas the Cocoms are linked to the Serpent Temple Assemblages, such as the one featuring Structure Q143 (Figures 1-3). Puuc revival-style architecture at Mayapan seems to have been inspired by worship of Chaac, the rain god closely connected with a conservative faction ofXiu priests who were known as "rain-bringers." Architectural forms inspired by Chichen Itza can be related to the messianic cult of Quetzalcoatl­Kukulcan spread by traders from Central Mexico in the Postclassic, echoing an earlier manifestation

of the cult in Terminal Classic Yucatan (Ringle et al. 1998). The politically powerful Cocom faction at Mayapan claimed an Itza heritage and a link with the cult of Quetzalcoatl-Kukulcan. Their revival-style serpent temples served both as a reli­gious symbols and a reminder of the ltza political legacy. 
Stylistic Analysis in Studies of 
Art and Archaeology 

Discussion of revival-style architecture invariably involves stylistic analysis, a methodology drawn from the field of art history. The prominence of sci­entific methods and statistical analysis in current archaeological studies has overshadowed the fact that some forms of archaeological inquiry require other methodologies. This is true in studies involv­ing art and architecture, and ceramic analysis based on visual appraisal. The heritage of the discipline of archaeology lies in Classical archaeology, a field still dominated by art-historical analysis. In the case of New World studies, art history and archae­ology are often seen as separate fields, but there is much to be learned from an interdisciplinary approach. The monograph of style, coupled with data drawn from the archaeological record, is cen­tral to research on Mesoamerican architecture, mural painting, and monumental sculpture (Clancy 1983; Coggins 1975; Guernsey 2006; Kowalski 1987, 1998, 2003; Milbrath 1979). Gordon Willey (1962) long ago recognized the importance of sty!­

istic analysis in the field of precolumbian archae­ology, and archaeologists continue to employ art­historical analysis in the study of chronology and cultural "horizons," although sometimes blurring the distinction between style and iconography (see for example, Marcus 2007). 
Recent studies of precolumbian art and archi­tecture emphasize that it is important to distinguish between style and iconography (Guernsey 2006:44; Kowalski and Kristan-Graham 2007:56). This is especially true in studies focusing on chronology, such as Tatiana Proskouriakoff's (1950) compre­hensive monograph on the chronology of Maya sculpture. She demonstrated that iconographic motifs, such as serpent bars and other symbolic regalia, have a long time span, and chronological change is more accurately reflected by studying for­mal stylistic elements. 
Art historians often refer back to an important study by Meyer Shapiro (1953:304), who defined style as a set of rules that are essentially the gram­mar of stylistic codes. Shapiro noted that style is a system of forms that not only expresses the broad outlook of individual artists but also reflects a cohe­sive expression of a group. The historian of art seeks to match variations of style with historical events and other cultural variants; therefore the "historical study of individual and group styles also discloses typical stages and processes in the devel­opment of forms" (Shapiro 1953:287). Style is bound by the framework of time, providing a "holistic quality and formal integrity to all the art produced within a society at a particular time" (Kowalski and Kristan-Graham 2007:57). 
The "cohesive expression of a group" is clearly seen in Mayapan's architecture, which employs Postclassic building techniques that are part of the grammar of the style (Proskouriakoff 1962a:92-96). This architectural style generally involved the reuse of well-carved Puuc stones along with crude limestone blocks laid in irregular courses, usually concealed beneath a thick layer of stucco and sometimes decorated with painted designs and modeling (Figure 4). The walls are either vertical or sloping, and the balustrades gen­erally end in a vertical element. Simple moldings are most common, but there are some more com­plex forms, such as moldings with the guilloche or bead-and-pleat motif inspired by Puuc forms (Proskouriakoff 1962a:95, Figure 5). Mayapan­style architecture also involves a preference forcer­tain architectural forms, most notably flat roofs.

Vaulted roofs are very rare, and the only two clear examples (Q80, Ql52) have exceptionally thick walls to support the vault (Figures 5-7; Delgado 2004: 150). Columns of stacked circular stones are prevalent throughout Mayapan 's occupation. Usu­ally lacking bases or capitals, they are paired at the entry of oratories or arrayed in double rows in rec­tangular, open-fronted halls (Figure 3). 
Mayapan revival-style architecture employs antique iconography and forms in architecture con­structed in a Postclassic style. The idea of revival-, style serpent temples is an innovation developed at Mayapan, although there are at least two other examples known in northeastern Yucatan (El Meco, San Angel). The use of Terminal Classic Chaac masks in Postclassic style colonnaded halls is apparently unique to Mayapan, and represents another variant of revival-sty le architecture inspired by Terminal Classic architecture (Figure 3; R86 in Smith 1962: Figure 6). 
The cohesive expression of architectural style at Mayapan also is reflected in the plaza rurnnge­ments. During the Postclassic period, Mayapan developed formal patterns for buildings arranged around the plazas. Proskouriakoff ( l 962a:9 l) defined two major types of complexes: the Basic

Ceremonial Group (a colonnaded hall, a shrine, and an oratory) and the Temple Assemblage, which is similar to the ceremonial group but also has an added pyramid temple at right angles to the hall, and a shrine facing the temple. 
Of the ten temples in Proskouriakoff's (1962a) study, five are defined as serpent-column temples (Q58, Ql43, Q159, Ql62, Q218; Figures 1, 7). The execution and the architectural context of the ser­pent temples reflect Mayapan's architectural style. The columns in the serpent temples are often made of a single limestone block with an added block (a carved serpent rattle) forming a capital to support the lintel; at the base of the column a serpent head is either carved of stone or modeled in stucco (Del­gado 2004: 152). Pedro Delgado (2004: 143) notes that all the serpent temples are built on pyramid bases, distinguishing them from temples built on platform bases, such as Structures Q80 and Q95 (Figure 5). Affiliations with "Maya-Toltec" archi­tecture are most clearly seen in the temples, orato­ries, and platforms, whereas the formal patterns of colonnaded halls and small shrines are more closely related to the East Coast (Delgado 2004: 154, 157). 
The systematic analysis of style is also impor­tant in identifying ceramic types and varieties, an essential component in studies of Maya ceramics that use the type-variety system. Robert E. Smith (1971 :68) defined the types and varieties of pot­tery from northern Yucatan by using a series of modes that represent selected attributes or clusters of attributes. The form of decorative design is one such mode (Smith 1971:48-67). Most of the designs illustrated are abstract and cannot be iden­tified as true iconographic symbols, with the excep­tion of some recognizable forms, such as crossed bones and serpents. Many decorative designs are found in multiple ceramic types that are widely distributed over time and space; therefore the designs alone are not useful in defining a specific ceramic complex. Other ceramic modes analyzed by Smith include vessel form, paste composition, surface finish, and decorative techniques, such as painting, modeling, and molding. The patterning of these modes is a main component in defining the ceramic types and varieties that characterize a specific complex. 1

loosely, as when he tells us that the "Sotuta style" influenced Peto Cream Ware in both the vessel forms and painted designs, while the paste and sur­face finish remains Hocaba in execution (Smith 1971:254). He also refers to Peto Cream Ware as a "new style of pottery," reinforcing this idea when he assigns Peto Cream Ware to a relatively short time period, even though elsewhere he says that wares "are not limited in time" (Smith 1971:135, 253). He describes wares as "a ceramic assemblage in which all attributes of paste composition, with the possible exception of temper and surface fin­ish, remain constant" (Smith 1971: 13 ). Although wares themselves are not limited in time, types and varieties of specific wares are chronological indi­cators (Figures 8-11; Smith 1971:133-136). Some researchers have applied the Postclasssic type­variety designations too loosely, masking some clear regional differences. For example, effigy censers at the sites of Champot6n and Calakmul have been incorrectly described as Chen Mul Mod­eled, a type and variety diagnostic of the Tases phase at Mayapan (Dominguez Carrasco 1996:517, Figure 12; Forsyth and Jordan 2003:57).2 
Mayapan's Ceramic Complexes 
Hocaba ceramics found in early contexts at 
Mayapan are associated with a small component of Terminal Classic ceramic types (Milbrath and Peraza 2003:3-7; Smith 1971 :22-24, 26). Mayapan has some types of Sotuta ceramics char­acteristic of Terminal Classic Chichen Itza (Smith 197l:Figure 27, a, b, d-k). An early deposit with Sotuta ceramics in Mayapan's Central Plaza sug­gests some form of contact with Chichen Itza (Fig­ure 8; Milbrath and Peraza 2003:7-8, 38). Although Smith ( 1971: 134) dated Sotuta later than Cehpech, the Sotuta complex is now dated A.D. 750/800--1000/1050 at Chichen Itza, chronologi­cally overlapping Cehpech (Puuc) ceramics, and Cehpech also persists into the Postclassic period at sites like Mayapan and Ek Balam (Figure 9; Bey et al. 1997; Bey et al. 1998; Cobos 2001, 2004; Ringle et al. 1998:Figure 5). Problems with the ceramic chronology of Yucatan are also evident in the fact that calibrated radiocarbon dates for Sotuta ceramics in monumental contexts date to the thir­teenth century at Kabah, overlapping with the intro­duction ofTases ceramics at Mayapan (Stanton and Bey 2006). 
Smith (1971: 135) dates Peto Cream Ware, and its diagnostic Hocaba phase types at Mayapan to 
A.D. 1200--1300, but this ware actually appears to be earlier and is often found in mixed deposits (Fig­ure 10). This mixture ofHocaba with other ceramic

components leads some to suggest that Hocaba is not really a chronologically distinct complex or phase (Ringle et al 1998; Robles 1986). At Chichen Itza's trading port, Isla Cerritos, Peto Cream Ware is dated by four radiocarbon samples to ca. A.D. 950--1200 (Andrews et al. 1988; Cobos 2001:186; Ringle et al 1998:189-192, Table I; Robles 1987: 105-106). At Balankanche cave the radio­carbon dates indicate a span of A.D. I 000-1150/1200 for mixed deposits (Hocaba­Sotuta phase in Ringle et al. 1998:189, 216, Fig­ure 29a, Table 1; Cobos 2004:519). 
If Hocaba ceramics and the diagnostic Peto Cream ware are seen as the marker for the early Postclassic period, we have a "soft" boundary between the Terminal Classic and Postclassic because Hocaba is mixed with Sotuta, and Peto Cream Ware "clings to most of the vessel shapes and decorative devices ofthe Sotuta Ceramic Com­plex while using a new crude method of manufac­ture" (Smith 1971 :254). Nonetheless, a noteworthy 
change between Sotuta and Hocaba ceramics is the disappearance of volcanic temper, which accounts for the crude paste and probably also indicates that trade routes with highland sources were disrupted as Chichen ltza began to decline (Milbrath and Per­aza 2003:6). 
Peto Cream, generally found at sites that have an earlier component of Sotuta ceramics, is seen as a sign of the persistence ofltza economic and polit­ical activities in the transition between Terminal Classic and Postclassic (Bey et al. 1998: 117; Ringle et al 1998: 191; Robles 1987). The presence of small Sotuta and Hocaba components mixed with the predominantly Cehpech ceramics at Uxmal has been interpreted as evidence of an Itza connection (Kowalski 2003). Similarly, these ceramic compo­nents at Mayapan probably reflect some form of 
ltza presence. 
At Mayapan, Sotuta ceramics represent a much smaller component than Terminal Classic ceram­ics, and together these "pre-Hocaba" ceramics rep­resent a very minor portion (two percent) of the Carnegie project sherds (Adams 1953:149; Smith 1971:164-169, Table 3, Charts 2, 3). More recent 
excavations produced similarly low percentages of 
Terminal Classic ceramics, but much higher fre­quencies (>50 percent) were found in the area of the two largest cenotes at the site (Itzmal Ch' en and X-Coton; Peraza et al. 2006:155). A round struc­ture (HIS) alongside the Cenote ltzmal Ch'en has significant proportion of Puuc (Cehpech) ceram­ics in construction fill and another relatively large deposit (as much as 20 percent Puuc) was found

in the lowest level of the passageway fill between Structure Q151 and Ql52 (Figure 1; Milbrath and Peraza 2003:7, 14). Even though there are some whole vessels from Mayapan that are Cehpech types (Smith 1971:134, 164-165, Figure 60c, d), the predominance of sherds in Mayapan' s Cehpech component suggests that the material is largely con­struction fill from an earlier Cehpech occupation (Figure 9; Peraza et al. 2006: 169). The relatively high percentage of Puuc/Cehpech ceramics found in some contexts in the Central Plaza could be due to mixing of sherds from earlier domestic occupa­tions near the center of the site. 
Overlaps between ceramic complexes and revi­sions in the chronology of Chichen ltza have led some to suggest that the term "Early Postclassic" should be retired in favor of a single Postclassic phase (Andrews et al. 2003: 152). Others see suffi­cient change in architecture to support a distinct Early Postclassic period, but caution that ceramics may not be the best indicator of the transitional points (Stanton and Bey 2006). Smith's two phase Postclassic sequence (Hocaba and Tases) for Mayapan ceramics has been combined into a sin­gle horizon (Hocaba-Tases) dated ca. A.D. 1050/1100-1450 (Delgado 2004:155; Peraza and Delgado 2006:218). Others propose a chronologi­cal sequence beginning with a mixed Hocaba-Tases complex and followed by a "pure" Tases compo­nent (Ringle et al. 1998:Figure 5). 
The evidence of pure Hocaba deposits at Mayapan rests largely on the Carnegie excavations ofsealed architectural deposits with relatively high

percentages of Peto Cream Ware and no Chen Mui Modeled effigy censers, one of the the diagnostic types of Smith's Tases phase. These sealed deposits and early Plaza Floors are our best indication of what constitutes Mayapan's earliest architecture and ceramics (Milbrath and Peraza 2003:6-8). 
The introduction of Tases phase effigy censers (Chen Mui Modeled type) reflects a major change in ritual practice, because the large censers seemed to have functioned as idols positioned in groups in front of altars in colonnades and perhaps individ­ually in temples (Milbrath et al. 2008). Effigy censers generally depict deities represented in the Postclassic codices (Milbrath et al. 2008), but some allude to earlier Maya traditions, as seen in a censer from a revival-style serpent temple (Structure Q58) that represents the Classic Maya monkey scribe, holding up a brush, his hand emerging from the jaws of a knotted serpent (Figure 11). 
Early Architecture at Mayapan 
Mayapan's architectural style seems to represent a cohesive style but there are some changes that can be noted through the site's history. For example,

changes in ceremonial architecture, such as the late introduction of plinths, parallel stylistic changes seen in an important residential compound associ­ated with Structure R86 (Proskouriakoff and Tem­ple 1955; Smith 1962:215). It is not entirely clear whether the early residential structures correlate directly with the early period of ceremonial archi­tecture because the residences are removed from the central plaza and do not seem to have sealed Hocaba ceramic deposits. Constructions built on bedrock, and all those sealed beneath the early plaza floors are representative of the early cere­monial architecture in the central area of the site. 
Architectural remains excavated at Mayapan date as early as the eleventh or twelfth centuries (Milbrath and Peraza 2003:Table 1; Peraza et al. 2006: 158 ). The substructure of the Pyramid of Kukulcan (Ql62a), early floors near Structure Q82, and the fill within another pyramid (Q58) all had high percentages of Peto Cream Ware, typical of the Hocaba complex (Peraza et al. 2006: 169-170). One early colonnade underlying Structure Ql51 had a large component of Hocaba ceramics (Shook and Irving I 955:151). Colonnades atMayapan may be inspired architecture at Chichen Itza (Masson et al. 2006a: 190), but the specific designs of the colon­naded halls seems more closely linked with the East Coast (Delgado 2004:154). 
Early structures on the northwest side of the Cenote Ch'en Mui Group apparently follow the pattern of an overlying complex. This group, cen­tered on Structure Q 151, has been identified as a Basic Ceremonial Group linked with the Xius (Fig­ure 2; Proskouriakoff 1962a:91, 113; Ringle and Bey 2001 :286). Cehpech and Hocaba ceramics were sealed between bedrock and earliest con­struction under Ql51 (Shook and Irving 1955:151-152). Since archaeologists found only 

the lowest part of this early colonnaded hall intact, they could not determine whether it was decorated with Terminal Classic Chaac masks like the over­lying colonnade (Figure 3; Milbrath and Peraza 2003:10-11). The structures underneath an oratory (Ql53) and an adjacent platform (Q153a), both positioned alongside the cenote at right angles to the colonnade beneath Ql51, form an early archi­tectural complex that predates the first plaza floor (Milbrath and Peraza 2003:38; Smith 1955:112-115, Figure la). With an oratory and a raised shrine facing an open colonnade, the layout of these structures forms an early example of the Basic Ceremonial Group, if the substructure of the terraced shrine (Q148) is also early, as now appears to be the case. Carnegie excavators suggested that all three phases of Structure Q148 were late, because of the scarcity of Peto Cream Ware (Smith 1955:118-121). More thorough excavations by INAH confirmed three construction phases, but their stratigraphic trench had a relatively high per­centage of Peto Cream Ware types (8.26 percent Xcanchakan and 7.44 percent Kukula in level VI) near the bottom and no Chen Mul Modeled effigy censers, which suggests that this level and the two

underlying levels are relatively early (Peraza et al. 2005:38-40, Figure 11, Table 201). The ceramic types encountered are similar to early lots, such as Lot C64 sealed under Plaza Floor 3 in the Central Plaza (Smith 1971:Table 3). 
A stela platform (Q84) is one of the earliest structures in the Central Plaza at Mayapan (Figures 1, 5; Adams 1953; Milbrath and Peraza 2003:33; Proskouriakoff 1962a: 106, 132-133). The platform was built on bedrock in the middle of the Central Plaza and enlarged over time in a series of con­centric additions. The associated ceramics were predominantly Hocaba, but also included Cehpech pottery (Adams 1953:159). Although the ceramic deposits were not entirely sealed, it was clear that the structure had been had been covered over by later plaza floors by the time Tases effigy censers were introduced (Adams 1953:158-161; Milbrath and Peraza 2003:12). Structure Q84 served as a stela platform, which suggests an affiliation with Puuc traditions and a possible connection with the Xius, who came to Mayapiin from a Puuc site, per­haps as refugees from the declining Puuc capital at U xmal. The concept of a stela platform is also seen at Uxmal, although this example is rectangular in shape. Stela platforms are unknown from Chichen ltza, and stelae are very rare at the site, with only two recorded examples and one of these is actually a panel (Garcia Campillo 2000:Figure 2. 7; Schmidt 2007). 
Another early structure (Structure Q 162a), a ter­raced pyramid constructed on a layer of topsoil just over bedrock, is linked to Q77 and Q77 a by Plaza Floor 1 (Figure 4; Shook 1954c:9 J-93, Figure 2a). It represents the largest early construction and has unusual detailing that may represent innovations developed at Mayapan. No evidence of a north­facing stair was found, indicating it was not a radial pyramid like the overlying Structure Q 162. The radiocarbon sample found beneath Structure Q 162a, dating A.D. 1020-1 170, was probably asso­ciated with a small temple or shrine that was destroyed while constructing the early pyramid (Figure 4a; Peraza et al. 2006: 157-1 58, 172). The terraced pyramid, completed by the time Plaza Floor 3 sealed the lowest stage, has niches that con­tained human skulls and modeled stucco reliefs depicting skeletal figures and vultures that are styl­istically similar to figures in the Dresden Codex, a screenfold with that seems to record dates in the Venus table that are contemporary with the use of the table in the early thirteenth century (Figure 4b;

Milbrath 1999: 163-179; Milbrath and Peraza 2003:18-19, Figure 16--17). Recent analysis sug­gests that the current run of the table would extend from the early thirteen to early fourteenth century (Victoria Bricker, personal communication 2008). Newly discovered Classic period reliefs represent­ing skeletal figures with a box or hole where the face should be have been found in the Puuc area (Pollack 1980:362, Figure 609; Ringle, personal communication 2008). This suggests a possible earlier Puuc precedent for the skeletal figures on Structure Q l 62a. 
Connections with Chichen Itza are evident in a square platform (Q77) that originally had stairways with balustrades on all four sides, resembling dance platforms at Chichen ltza (Figures 5-6). Although square platforms at Puuc sites occasionally have 

; stairs on all four sides, Structure Q77 seems more closely modeled on forms seen at Chichen ltza (Adams 1953: 156, Figure 4; Proskouriakoff l 962a: 104). Despite the apparent comparisons with dance platforms at Chichen Itza, the style of Q77 is crude and austere, reflecting the Postclassic build­ing style typical of Mayapan architecture. Like the stela platform, it was built on a thin layer of top­soil overlying bedrock, a characteristic of the ear­liest structures in the Central Plaza. The dance platform was originally 2 m. high, but its base was buried under a later series of plaza floors. Struc­ture Q77 is dated in relation to 13 sequential plaza floors on the south side of the Central Plaza (Mil­brath and Peraza 2003:Table 1; Shook 1954c:91-92, 99). The first plaza floor, laid down on fill over bedrock, connects two platforms built on bedrock (Structures Q77 and Q77a). Cere­monies involving non-effigy censers were per­formed on Structure Q77a, and thereafter it was partially razed and an offering (Lot C64) was made that included a grater bowl, a vessel form that first appears in Yucatan in the Sotuta complex at Chichen ltza (Smith 1971:72, Figure 46a). This offering was sealed by Plaza Floor 3 and clearly dates prior to the introduction of Chen Mui Mod­eled effigy censers of the Tases complex. 
Mayapan's Structure Q77 could represent a late survival of the dance platforms seen at Chichen ltza or an early revival of this form. This uncertainty is largely due to conflicting evidence about the latest date for Chichen ltza's monumental construction. Peter Schmidt (2007: 157) suggests that construc­tion continued as late as A.D. 1100 or even 1150, which could overlap with Mayapan 's earliest occu­pation, while other scholars suggest major con­struction ceased aroundA.D. 1000/1050 (Bey and Ringle 2007:389; Cobos 2001, 2004; Ringle et al. 1998: 189-192).

platform as a survival of an earlier form because it 
seems to be one of the earliest structures in the 
Central Plaza, and the associated ceramics include 
Hocaba ceramics and some Sotuta ceramics, rein­
forcing the connection with Chichen Itza (Figure 
8; Milbrath and Peraza 2003:18; Shook 1954c:91, 
99). 
In the Cenote ltzmal Ch' en group, underlying 
Structure HIS, archaeologists found evidence of a 
platform (Hl8sub) that is presumed to be a square 
platform having stairways with balustrades on all 
four sides, like Structure Q77 (Chowning 1956:444, 
Figure 1 ). These platforms may both represent sur­
vivals inspired by Terminal Classic dance plat­forms, but they were constructed in a Postclassic style. The associated ceramics (Lot Cl 32) sealed inside Structure HI 8sub are classified as a middle lot by Smith (1971:Appendix B), but the excava­tors note that the ceramics indicate that the Struc­ture H18sub may be "fairly early" (Chowing 1956:450). 
Structure HIS is a round structure on a square platform with four stairways that have balustrades (Figure 12; Chowning I956:448-450, Figure l; 
Milbrath and Peraza 2003:13-I4, Proskouriakoff 
1962a:Figure I). It was originally described as a 
temple, but Proskouriakoff (l 962a: I 28) notes that 
"considering its size and its relationship to other structures of the group, the term 'shrine' seems more appropriate." The round shrine has four doors aligned to the cardinal directions, resembling Chichen Itza's Caracol, but without the vaulted ceiling and second story. This may be one of Mayapan 's earliest architectural constructions ded­icated to Quetzalcoatl-Kukulcan, a cult that was highly developed at Chichen Itza (Ringle et al. 1998). Ceramics associated with the construction of Hl8 (Lot C13I) are classified as a middle lot by Smith (197l:Appendix B), making it the earliest of the round temples at Mayapan. It might repre­sent a late survival, essentially an extension of the latest construction at Chichen Itza. The Casa Redonda at Chichen ltza, associated with Sotuta ceramics and a small amount of Hocaba pottery, employs late construction techniques like those at Mayapan (Pollock 1936:108). Round temples are not characteristic of Puuc sties, and one excavated at Uxmal, associated with Terminal Classic Ceh­pech ceramics, is seen as an attempt to emulate Chichen Itza (Kowalski and Dunning 1998:290). 
The early architectural style ofMayapan is char­acterized by innovative designs, such as the Q l 62a pyramid, colonnaded halls, and an early form of the Postclassic Basic Ceremonial Group (Q 151

group). A stela platform (Q84 ), dating to the twelfth century may represent an early revival of tenth­century Puuc traditions. Other early constructions could represent survivals of Terminal Classic forms inspired by late architecture at Chichen Itza, such as the dance platforms ( Q77, H 18sub ?) and a round shrine (H 18 ). A similar blend of innovation and Ter­minal Classic survivals is seen in Mayapan's early ceramics, which include Sotuta and Cehpech com­ponents mixed with Hocaba ceramics of the Early Postclassic period. The Sotuta and Cehpech ceramic types are actually the same types found at Chichen Itza and the Puuc sites in the Terminal Classic, representing a true survival of an earlier component, whereas the architectural forms iden­tified as survivals are modeled on Terminal Clas­sic forms but constructed in a Postclassic style. 
Architectural Transformation in Mayapan's Revival Styles 
There may two major building surges associated with "power drives" of Mayapan's most influen­tial regimes, dated ca. A.D. 1150-1300 and 1300-1400 (Peraza et al. 2006:173). The earlier span of dates would be associated with the mixed Hocaba-Tases components, postdating the rare examples of sealed Hocaba deposits mixed with a small amount of Terminal Classic ceramics, which may date as early as A.D. 1100. The second build­ing surge is more clearly associated with the epoch of Tases ceramics and the revival of Terminal Clas­sic architectural forms seen at sites that were now largely abandoned, but retained a legendary mys­tique. 
Using Mayapan-style construction techniques, the Cocoros built serpent-column temples modeled on architectural forms dating centuries earlier at Chichen ltza. A self-conscious effort to evoke the past is especially evident in revival-style architec­ture built over buildings of a different design. Mayapan's pyramid of Kukulcan (Q 162), the largest of a group of five serpent temples located in the central area of the site, is a radial pyramid constructed over a pyramid of a different design (Figure 4a). Another pyramid temple (Structure Q58) was apparently remodeled to transform it into a serpent temple, while preserving its earlier func­tion as a shaft tomb (Proskouriakoff 1962a: 100; Shook 1954a:256). 
Dating the earliest true revival style architecture at Mayapan is somewhat problematical. The earli­est revival-sty le structures are associated with effigy censers of the Tases complex, dated to A.D. 1300-1450 by Smith (1971: 136), although an ear-
