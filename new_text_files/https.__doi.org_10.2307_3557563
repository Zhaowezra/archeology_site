FIRST REPORT OF A NEWLY DISCOVERED PALEOINDIAN QUARRY 


SITE ON THE ISTHMUS OF PANAMA 
Georges A. Pearson 
An archaeological survey on the Azuero Peninsula in Panama has recently discovered a Paleoindian quarry/workshop at the base of a quartz outcrop. The Nieto site contains seldom-seen preforms and flake blanks that provide new information on early-stage reduction strategies used by Clovis-like point makers in the Neotropics. Finished tools recovered at the site include gravers, side scrapers, and large scraper planes. The production of flake blanks followed a core reduction and reju­venation strategy already observed at other Paleoindian sites in Costa Rica and Florida. Although the quartz outcrop is located only a few kilometers away from better-quality sources of jasper and chert, Paleoindians appear to have preferred this translucent stone for their weaponry. This new information, when combined with late-stage production strategies pre­viously recorded from other Panamanian sites, brings us closer to tracing a complete manufacturing trajectory for Clovis­like points on the Isthmus. It is hoped that data from the Nieto quarry/workshop will eventually help archaeologists determine if the presence of the fluting technique in Central and South America is attributable to a migration of Clovis-related peo­ple or a technological diffusion 
among pre-established southerly populations. 
lnvestigaciones arqueol6gicas llevadas a cabo recientemente en la Peninsula Azuero, Panama, ha dado como resultado el des­cubrimiento de una cantera/taller perteneciente al Horizonte Paleoindio, localizada en la base de un afioramiento de cuarzo. Sitio Nieto contiene preformas poco comunes, y lascas nodulares que proporcionan nuevos datos en relaci6n a las estrategias tempranas de reducci6n empleadas en el Neotr6pico. Entre las herramientas recuperadas en el sitio se incluyen picos, ras­padores laterales, y grandes raspadores pianos. Las lascas obtenidas como resultado del proceso de reducci6n de talla y estrategias de rejuvenecimiento son similares a las observadas previamente en otros sitios paleoindios de Costa Rica y Florida. Existen algunos afioramientos de jaspes y pedernal pr6ximos a la cantera/taller de cuarzo de Sitio Nieto, por lo que pensamos que los pobladores paleoindios parecen haber tenido una clara preferencia por el cuarzo con el objeto de elaborar su utillaje de piedra. Los nuevos datos obtenidos sobre tecnicas de manufactura tempranas conectan con las estrategias tardias regis­tradas en otros sitios de Panama, gracias a lo cual hemos podido realizar un trazado aproximado de la trayectoria de pro­ducci6n de las puntas Clovis en el ltsmo. Esperamos que Los datos de la cantera/taller de Sitio Nieto tarde o temprano ayuden a Los arque6logos a determinar si la presencia de la tecnica de acanalado paleoindia, en America Central y America del Sur, es atribuible a una migraci6n de poblaciones Clovis, o bien si esta relacionada con una difusi6n tecnol6gica entre poblaciones pre-establecidas del sur.

between the North American ice sheets and even the existence of such a corridor have been ques­tioned. This challenge has given rise to alternative entryways and migration routes to account for sub­Laurentidian populations (Anderson and Gillam 2000; Fladmark 1979, 1983; Mandryk 2001). For example, to explain the presence of pre-Clovis sites in South America in the absence of similar occupa­tions further north, a popular scenario proposes a late Pleistocene coastal migration along the Pacific seaboard that brought people to South America while bypassing the interior regions (Carvalho Gorn;alves et al. 2003; Dixon 1999; Gruhn 1988, 1994). 
Another topic of contention has focused on the origin and dispersion of the fluting technique in South America (Ardila 1991; Ardila and Politis 1989; Bell 1965; Bird 1938; Gnecco 1994; Mayer­Oakes 1986a; Jackson 1995; Jaimes 1999). Attempts to explain this phenomenon have centered around three hypotheses. The first suggests that the fluting technique was carried south by migrating humans who were bioculturally related to North American Clovis groups (Lynch 1983; Morrow and Morrow 1999; Ranere and Cooke 1991; S11arskis 1979). The second argues that this manufacturing trait was diffused and adopted south by pre-estab­lished populations who came into contact with expanding Clovis bands (Bryan 1973, 1983). Lastly, Mayer-Oakes ( 1986b) proposed that fluting was independently invented in South America and may or may not have diffused north. 
One strategy that can help untangle these ideas is to carry out technological comparisons between fluted point assemblages from North, Central, and South America. The degree of affinity between northern and southern fluted point industries would help archaeologists determine if Clovis groups encountered and influenced, replaced or were assimilated, or simply lived alongside pre-estab­lished groups possibly related to Monte Verdeans. Coupled with a solid chronological framework, technological differences and similarities would allow us to distinguish between a migration or a passing of ideas through pre-Clovis populations. 
To help shed light on this problem, an ongoing survey has attempted to locate additional Paleoin-

dian occupations in Panama (Pearson 1999, 2000; Pearson and Cooke 2002). This area was chosen because of its key geographic location and its role as a narrow land bridge that has concentrated human movements between the continents. Regardless of the route(s) taken by early migrants during the colonization process, the Isthmus of Panama would have been an unavoidable stopping place while moving to or from South America. This report presents preliminary data from a newly dis­covered Paleoindian quarry/workshop site on the Pacific side of Panama. 
The Nieto Paleoindian 
Quarry and Workshop 

Site Location and Description 
The Nieto site (124 m a.s.l.) is located on theAzuero Peninsula approximately 10 km northwest of the town of Pese (Figure 1). The quarry consists of an exposed vein of gray-white, translucent cryp­tocrystalline quartz that juts from the summit of a small hill (Figure 2). This outcrop forms a pillar­like wall ( 1 m by 10 m) that is flanked on both sides by steep colluvial slopes containing a large amount of cultural and natural lithic debris (Figure 3). Test excavations were carried out on the northern sec­tion of the quarry where a Clovis-like projectile point preform was discovered on the surface (Fig­ure 4a). 
Although the majority of artifacts found at Nieto consist of unidirectional and multi-directional blocky cores, core fragments, flakes, and shatter, some bro­ken tool preforms, flake blanks, and finished imple­ments were also encountered. With the exception of a few bladelets and small blade cores, none of the recovered material could be ascribed to possible later preceramic or ceramic cultures. Bifacial reduction of cryptocrystalline stone has not been observed in Panamanian lithic assemblage post-dating 7000 14C yr B.P. (Ranere and Cooke 1995, 1996, 2002). This peculiarity of the Isthmian archaeological record has, in fact, helped researchers identify early sites by the simple presence of bifacial thinning flakes of fine-grained lithic material. 

Deposits and Stratigraphy 
Lithic artifacts were discovered lying above and within colluvial deposits around the outcrop. Hakes and other manufacturing detritus were strewn on the surface of the north-facing slope, which dropped at an angle of approximately 40 degrees. Although the rise is vegetated with trees and shrubs (Curate/la americana), evidence of ongoing ero­sion and denudation due to heavy rain is visible today. The thickness of the deposits varied from a few centimeters closest to the exposed vein to more than 40 cm at the base of the hill. Sediments were homogeneous, and did not show any evidence of weathering horizons.

Lithic Assemblage 
The first diagnostic artifacts discovered at the 
quarry were bifacial thinning flakes and a Clovis­
like point preform fragment that alerted us to a pos­
sible late Pleistocene exploitation of the outcrop. 
Thus far, cores, large flake blanks, bifacial pre­
forms, various scraping and graving tools, and over 
50 bifacial thinning flakes have been discovered at 
Nieto (Figure 4). Technological analysis of the 
material is still ongoing, and only preliminary data (Table 1) and descriptions are presented below. 
The point preform (Figure 4a) has a sinuous edge due to uncorrected deep concavities left by the initial lateral thinning removals. This preform is different both stylistically and technologically from stemmed fishtail and Archaic projectile points found on the Isthmus. It was manufactured from a large flake, which was progressively reduced on both sides, giving it a distinctive bi-convex cross­section. Initial thinning and shaping has completely removed all traces of the original flake blank's sur­face. Significantly, several isolated and ground plat­form lobes are still visible on the blade's edge. On one side, the distal end of what could be a flute or large end-thinning scar is visible just above the break (Figure 5). Although the edge of the fracture is square and was not the result of a "languette" scar (Roche and Tixier 1982)-which could be mistaken for a flute-the distinction between inten­tional removals, secondary fractures, and exfoliated breaks has been made difficult due to the unpre­dictability of this raw material. Nevertheless, flut­ing of early stage preforms would not be out of

place here since it has already been observed at other lower Central American sites such as La Mula-West in Panama (Ranere 2000; Ranere and Cooke 1995, 1996) and Guardiria in Costa Rica (Pearson 1998, 2004; Snarskis 1979). 
The Nieto preform could be described as a stage 4 biface following Callahan (1979), or more pre­cisely a stage 4.1 according to Morrow's (1996) reduction scheme. Overshooting thinning flakes, commonly encountered in other Clovis-related workshops (Pearson 2002), have not yet been dis­covered among the manufacturing debris at Nieto. A possible explanation for this could be the low quality of the lithic raw material that caused many thinning flakes to terminate prematurely or break. The flaking pattern indicates that flintknappers attempted to drive long flakes past the preform's midline but were rarely successful. Although the crystalline qualities of the lithic raw material at Nieto are aesthetically pleasing to the eye, its struc­ture makes it highly unpredictable and an inferior stone for ftintknapping purposes. Many of the shat­ter pieces and discarded tool preforms display breaks along linear impurities and larger quartz inclusions. Most intriguing is that the area around Nieto contains many sources of high-quality cherts and jaspers where bifacial material is absent. It appears that the beauty of translucent crystals over less-attractive stones may have overridden more practical factors in the decision-making process leading to the manufacture of points. Simi­
some

lar observations were made at the La Mula-West workshop, where Paleoindians manufactured many Clovis-like points from brittle, translucent agate cobbles (Ranere 2000) found among better-qual­ity cryptocrystalline jaspers. This pattern goes against popular notions of a focused exploitation of high-quality stones by North American Clovis groups (Goodyear 1979) and may be indicative of ideological aspects of Paleoindian life. 
The base of a second unfinished projectile point was discovered less than a meter from the preform (Figure 4b). This unground segment displays sev­eral longitudinal thinning scars or possible guid­ing flakes, and a slight nipple indicating that it was possibly being prepared for fluting. Evidence for the manufacture of a third point was provided by the discovery of a differently colored broken chan­nel flake (Figure 2h). The fragment is straight (i.e., no curvature), parallel-sided, has a slight bi-con­vex cross-section, and broke just below its platform or nipple (Figure 6). Its dorsal surface is charac-

terized by a series of small, unidirectional scars sug­gesting that it was removed following several basal thinning attempts and/or some of the removals may have served as guiding channels. Especially inter­esting was a tool with a broken, bifacially worked distal end made on a blue-green chert flake (Fig­ure 4c). No debitage of this material was found at the site and it may have been left behind after retool­ing (cf., Gramly 1980). 
Also found among the debris were early stage preforms and large flake blanks used for the pro­duction of bifacial tools or projectile points (Fig­ure 4f, g, i). Finished tools included gravers, keeled (snubbed-nosed) end scrapers, side scrapers, and scraper planes (Figure 2j-n, r-u). Several large blade-like flakes (Figure 2p, q) and ridge spalls were also recovered. These elongated pieces do not display small, prepared platforms or pronounced curvature characteristic of many Clovis blades (Collins 1999). Other important finds consisted of large flake cores and platform rejuvenation seg­ments (Figure 2x, y) displaying identical reduction steps as those from the Guardiria Paleoindian quarry/workshop in Costa Rica (Pearson 1998, 2004), and the Fossil Hole quarry site in Florida (Hemmings 1999). Large scraper planes were fash­ioned on blade-like flakes and sometimes shaped by a trihedral flaking technique. Great efforts were 
made to flatten the ventral surfaces of these large scraping tools. Irregularities, such as the bulb of force, and excessive curvature were corrected by striking the blank's edges "head on" to detach large flakes that would terminate in hinge or step frac­tures. This tactic ensured that the retouch itself did not plunge or compound the initial problem and is comparable to core platform rejuvenation removals. Significantly, this same manufacturing technique was also observed on the planes from Guardiria and lakes La Yeguada and Alajuela (Pearson 1998, 2002). 
Overall, the Nieto assemblage mirrors many of the artifact styles, manufacturing techniques, and even lithic raw materials choices observed at other Paleoindian sites. Most importantly, it links with the late-stage rejects and broken preforms discov­ered at La Mula-West to trace a more complete manufacturing trajectory for fluted lanceolate points in Panama. 
Discussion 
Several avenues of research, such as detailed tech­nological analyses and comparisons of lithic assem­blages, can offer significant clues to the origins of the fluting technique in South America. However, similarities and differences between North and South American Paleoindian lithic tools are mean-

ingless without factoring in contextual data. That 
is to say, without a clear picture of the culture-adap­
tive milieu, resemblance among artifacts will not 
necessarily support a migration scenario nor will 
discrepancies imply a diffusion of ideas. Lithic 
assemblages must be compared in relation to the 
economic systems and environments in which they 
were used. Moreover, analyses must examine entire 
tool kits and not concentrate solely on projectile 
points. Other clues, such as those related to group 
ideologies, although difficult to interpret, would 
also be useful, since these abstract elements are less 
likely to have been borrowed (Storck 1991). Even 
then, analytical results might still be subjective and 
open to numerous personal interpretations. For 
example, when trying to understand the cause(s) 
for the similarities and differences between a North 
American Clovis point and a South American fish­
tail projectile point, how can archaeologists dis­
tinguish between factors such as: (1) changing 
adaptive strategies, when groups face new envi­
ronmental selective pressures; (2) cultural distor­
tion and selective borrowing, when an idea is passed 
from one group to another; or (3) simple stochas­
tic and historical events that may have affected 
styles, when groups become isolated and the flow 
of information is cut off (O'Brien and Lyman 
2000)? 
When faced with questions of biocultural affin­

ity, there is no escaping the fact that although 
humans can modify and borrow technologies, they 
cannot change their genes. Consequently, the most 
robust analyses and perhaps the final arbiter of the 
debates may come from future ancient DNA tests. 
But until more late Pleistocene skeletons are dis­
covered, archaeologists must rely on variables such 
as tool form and manufacturing techniques to make 
sense of the variability. Unfortunately, the major­
. ity of Paleoindian sites discovered so far in Cen­tral America contain finished points or preforms in late stages of production (Garcia-Barcena 1979; Gruhn and Bryan 1977; Santamaria 1981; Snarskis 1979). In most cases, early stage reduction strate­gies are obscured if not completely invisible when analyzing finished or resharpened tools. The key difference, and thus the importance, of the Nieto site resides in the fact that the first half of the man­ufacturing techniques, including raw material extraction, are represented here. Coupled with data from other Panamanian sites (Bird and Cooke 1978; Pearson 2000, 2002; Ranere 2000; Ranere and Cooke 1991, 2001), this latest information brings us closer to tracing a complete chafne operatoire for Clovis-like points on the Isthmus. 
Conclusion 

Current knowledge on how the first human inhab­itants of North and South America related to each other not only has been impeded by geographic dis­tance but also by an information void. To this day, the Paleoindian archaeological records of North and South America remain isolated from each other. Ongoing archaeological research on the Azuero Peninsula in Panama represents an effort to close this gap. One of the principal objectives of the Isth­mian survey is to find clues that will help us under­stand the origins of the fluting technique in South America. 
The newly discovered Nieto quarry/workshop provides new information on early stage reduction strategies used by Clovis-like point makers. Pre­liminary results indicate that the lanceolate fluted points at Nieto were made on large flake blanks. Secondary retouch was invasive and did not leave pseudo flutes on the recovered bifaces. Preforms appear to have been fluted in the early stages of pro­duction by isolating and striking a basal nipple. Large Clovis-like macroblades and blade cores were not observed at Nieto. Finally, large flake cores, top and bottom platform rejuvenation seg­ments, and keeled end scrapers, similar to those found at the Guardiria site in Costa Rica and Fos­sil Hole in Florida, attest to a Paleoindian cultural homogeneity across lower Central America and perhaps around the Gulf of Mexico (Faught and Dunbar 1997; Pearson and Bostrom 1998). Ongo­ing fieldwork in Central America and additional pan-continental comparative analyses among Pale­oindian lithic assemblages should help us deter­mine if southern fluted point makers were distant cousins of Clovis groups or contemporary neigh­bors who imitated their technology.
