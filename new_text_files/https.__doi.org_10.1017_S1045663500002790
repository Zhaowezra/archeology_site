Chiconautla , 
situated on the northeastern shore of Lake Texcoco and the southern edge of the Teotihuacan Valley, 
lay at an important juncture for east-west exchange in the Basin of Mexico with connections to as far away as the Gulf Coast. Recently, we completed an INAA study on ceramics from Chiconautla to examine marketing and exchange patterns from A.D. 950 to 1521. We present these data and contextualize them in light of contexts excavated at the site by George C. Vaillant, in par­ticular materials from an Aztec noble residence he called "Casa Rea/es." We also examine historical information regard­
' 
ing Chiconautla s role in Aztec society as it existed at the eve of Spanish conquest. We evaluate the site's particular position at the crossroads of important trade routes in light of recent models of Aztec markets and exchange and what these patterns say about shifting political affiliations 
in this critical region.

argue that commerce intensified during the era of political decentralization that followed the collapse of Classic period regional state systems (such as Teotihuacan) as specialists and entrepreneurs relied on markets to trade across political boundaries. Trigger (2003:403) also links the development of markets with city-state organization. Even under the political consolidation of the Triple Alliance, Trigger argues that the integration of Aztec city­states was as much, if not more, economic, than political. Aztec imperial rulers promoted trade and fostered markets while separating them from the control of rival local elites. For Berdan and Smith (1996:210), the "complex interlocking market sys­tem" that developed in the Aztec heartland in the Late Postclassic exemplifies a larger goal of all empires: to encourage economic growth while con­trolling resources. 
Several scholars including Blanton (1996), Brumfiel and Earle (1987), and Hodge and Mine (1990; Hodge et al. 1992, 1993; Mine 1994, 2006) emphasize politics in the development of markets as a means of financing emerging state economies. 
They point to how Aztec city-state rulers (includ­ing Chiconautla) taxed sales on vendors and how it was in their interest to foster local-level com­mercial production and exchange. Rulers of city­states competed, fought, and allied with each other prompting the creation of an interconnected elite class in the Basin of Mexico that crosscut political boundaries. Conspicuous consumption of prestige goods and ritual paraphernalia, along with a dra­matic rise in regional population, helped fuel trade. Garraty (2006) sees a close connection between the development and structure of Aztec market net­works and elite interests. 
Our goal was to examine Chiconautla's growth as a trading hub and its relationships with the Triple Alliance capitals of Tenochtitlan and Texcoco and with Otumba, the largest city-state in the Teoti­huacan Valley and an important regional craft pro­duction center (e.g., Charlton et al. 2000; Nichols 1994; Otis Charlton et al. 1993).

named "Casas Reales") excavated in the 1930s (see Vaillant 1962; Elson 1999; Sanders and Evans 2001 :983-988; Smith 2008:45), allows us to eval­uate how ceramic exchange changed over time and what this says about shifting economic relations and political affiliations in this critical region. 
To begin, we present an overview of current Basin-wide political models derived from studies of the Postclassic period economy. We use these data to hypothesize what patterns we might expect to see at Chiconautla during the Postclassic period. In the second part of the article, we examine archi­tecture and artifacts from Chiconautla's palace including the results of INAA on serving and rit­ual ceramics. In the final section we discuss our results in light of regional economic models. 
Ceramic Studies and Models of the 
Postclassic Political Economy 

Recent stylistic and compositional studies of ceramics designed to examine systems of market exchange emerging after the decline of the Classic period state of Teotihuacan have greatly advanced our understanding of the Aztec economy in the Basin of Mexico. 
Early Postclassic 
During the Early Postclassic (A.D. 950-1 150) ceramic exchange networks, particularly the exchange of decorated vessels with prestige value, expanded between urban centers (Nichols et al. 2002). Rural villagers in the Teotihuacan Valley mostly consumed locally made pottery (Crider et al. 2007). The influence that Tula (north of the Basin) and Cholula (south of the Basin) had in the Basin is unclear. 
Internal political boundaries did impose some limitations on exchange as ceramics fall into two major production and stylistic zones: (1) Maza­pantrollan found in the eastern and northern Basin; and (2) Black-on-Orange Aztec I present in the southern Chalco-Xochimilco area, at Xaltocan in the north-central Basin, and farther east at Cholula and southwestern Puebla. Except at some sites in the southern Basin, these complexes generally have non-overlapping spatial distributions, suggesting the distributions can be tied to ethnic/political divi­sions among Early Postclassic city-state confeder­ations (Brumfiel 2005;Brumfiel and Hodge 1996; Garcia Chavez 2004: 353; Nichols et al. 2008; Par­sons and Gorenflo 2009). 
Middle Postclassic 
Settlement pattern and documentary data led researchers to propose that Aztec city-states of the Middle Postclassic (A.D. 1150-1350) were asso­ciated with highly localized solar market systems­a system lacking a central place hierarchy where political control limits consumer choice (Charlton and Nichols 1997:199-202; Hassig 1985:73; Hicks 1978:93; Smith 1979). Recent composition and stylistic studies, however, indicate that Early Aztec (Aztec II) decorated wares (Red wares and Orange wares) were exchanged more commonly than expected from the solar market model. 
In addition to expanded exchange between adjoining market zones, exports of ceramics from production z9nes that included politically power­ful city-states (e.g., Texcoco in eastern Basin, and Tenochtitlan and Azcapotzalco in the southwest­ern Basin) increased (Garcia 2004; Garraty 2006; Ma 2003; Mine 1994, 2006; Mine et al. 1994; Nichols et al. 2002; Nichols et al. 2008). For exam­ple, during this time period Black-on-Orange Aztec II ceramics from the Texcoco region appear at Cerro Portezuelo and Black-on-Orange Aztec II ceram­ics produced in the Tenochtitlan region were exported to Chalco and Xaltocan. In both cases, ceramic data echo historical data suggesting Tex­coco and Tenochtitlan and Azcapotzalco (both fall in the Tenochtitlan production zone) were expand­ing their spheres of political influence. From her data on Aztec Red wares, Mine (2006) posits a model of noncentralized overlapping market net­works. In contrast Blanton ( 1996), Garraty (2006), and Nichols et al. (2002) see indications of Aztec market hierarchies beginning in the Middle Post­classic. 
Late Postclassic 
In the Late Postclassic (A.D. 1350-1521), exchange through both market and tribute systems intensified and the organization of market networks became more centralized in the core of the Basin of Mexico. The Texcoco and Tenochtitlan compo­sition zones exported increasing amounts ofBlack­on-OrangeAztec IIIpottery (now the most common type of decorated service ware), and these imper­ial capitals also became the largest markets and

craft production centers in the Basin. Exports from the Chalco composition group to other regions of the Basin decreased sharply, possibly with the onset of nearly a century of hostility between Chalco and Tenochtitlan that culminated in Tenochtitlan's con­quest of Chalco in 1465 (Hodge et al. 1992, 1993; Neff and Hodge 2009; Nichols et al. 2002:69-70). 
While exports of Aztec III Black-on-Orange pottery from the southwestern Basin expanded to the eastern Basin and beyond, ceramics made in the eastern Basin mostly circulated within the Texcoco-headed Acolhua domain (Garraty 2007; Hodge and Neff 2005; Mine 2006; Nichols and Charlton 2001; Nichols et al. 2002; Skoglund et al. 2006). The northeastern Basin in particular, although politically incorporated into the Acolhua confederation, may not have been as fully inte­grated into the regional system of interlocking mar­kets (Blanton 1996; Charlton 1994; Charlton et al. 2000). In short, by the Late Postclassic, although the Tenochtitlan and Texcoco regions produced substantial amounts of Black-on-Orange Aztec III ceramics, those from the Tenochtitlan composition group appear across the Basin at a scale suggest­ing to some scholars that Tenochtitlan intervened to promote the growth of its own production sys­tem at the expense of others (Blanton 1996). 
The production and distribution of Aztec Red ware, primarily used as serving ware, may not mir­ror that of Black-on-Orange ware. Brumfiel (2004:251) suggests Red ware "bowls" were drink­ing containers and notes some of the painted designs on Red wares evoke Omacatl, the Aztec god of hospitality. In both the Middle and Late Postclassic, the production of low-fired Red ware appears more localized than Black-on-Orange wares (Charlton et al. 2008; Neff et al. 2000; Nichols et al. 2002). Minc's (2006: 108) recent analysis of Aztec Red ware from the eastern and southeastern Basin argues for a dual market sys­tem in the Late Postclassic Basin that was spatially congruent with the two major confederations of the empire, Tenochtitlan and Texcoco, as antici­pated by Hassig (1985). 
Chiconautla and Models of the 
Postclassic Political Economy 

The current understanding of marketing and exchange patterns for the A.D. 650-1521 time 
period indicates that ceramic production was mul­ticentric throughout and suggests a shift from ( 1) a highly localized, solar marketing model to (2) increased movement of decorated vessels though a network of overlapping markets, perhaps also influenced by kinship, marriage, and political alliances, to (3) a hierarchical market system increasingly influenced by the Triple Alliance cap­itals ofTexcoco and especially Tenochtitlan (Brum­fiel 1987; Charlton et al. 2000; Nichols et al. 2002; Smith 1979, 1980, 2003a, 2003b, 2003c). Points of debate concern how much political control rulers exerted over the economy and the degree to which such control reduced or inhibited horizontal or lat­eral integration between subregional market zones (Garraty 2007; Mine 2006). 
How do data describing Chiconautla's political history fit with this emerging pattern of market exchange? Sanders ( 1986:525) proposes that in the Early Postclassic the entire Teotihuacan Valley, including Chiconautla, formed a small state cen­tered at Teotihuacan that was incorporated into the Toltec Tula sphere. In the Middle Postclassic (ca. 
A.D. 1150-1350/1400), Chiconautla grew into a large town with its own ruling family, although it is not clear if it was politically independent or was dominated by Xaltocan, one of eight large regional centers in the Basin (Sanders et al. 1979: 137-149). 
By ca. 1430-1434 Chiconautla had a tlatoani (ruler) appointed during the reorganization of the Acolhua state under Nezahualcoyotl. As part of its tribute, Chiconautla provided labor and services to the palace at Tex coco (Alva Ixtlilx6chitl 1975-77. 
2: 89-90; Hodge and Blanton 1996:230). While Chiconautla's rulers intermarried with Texcoco's royal family, in the Late Postclassic they also may have had kinship ties to Tenochtitlan (Berdan and Anawalt 1992:2:222; Evans 2001; Gibson 1964: 43; Hodge 1991:134-135; Sanders and Evans 2001:948-949). Elson (1999:153) notes that the gloss on the depiction ofMotecuhzoma's palace in the Codex Mendoza lists Chiconautla as one of three polities called "friends of Motecuhzoma" (Berdan and Anawalt l 992:3:f69r). 
Following Sanders, for the Early Postclassic we expect that Chiconautla primarily consumed ceramics produced in the Teotihuacan region. At the same time, trace element analysis may tell us something about how Chiconautla's economic rela­tions expanded beyond the Teotihuacan Valley. For

the Middle and Late Postclassic, if economic data mirror historical evidence, then we would expect that developing kinship, marriage, and political alliances with the Triple Alliance capitals of Tex­coco and Tenochtitlan increased the city-state's par­ticipation with these production zones. We also anticipate seeing patterns in the forms and types of ceramics from the palace that suggest shared ritual behavior (Berdan and Smith 1996:214-215) and regional or intra-elite competitive displays and con­sumption to mark status among elites (Brumfiel 
1987, 2004). At the same time, increasing com­merce and Chiconautla's growth as a trade center should have expanded the local availability of goods (Blanton 1996). 
Inthe following sections we present an overview of the archaeology of Chiconautla. We examine data on architecture and on local and imported non­ceramic materials recovered during excavations. We describe the results of INAA on 200 ceramic materials, including decorated pottery (bowls and tripod bowls); fancy serving vessels (copas,pulque vessels); common decorated serving vessels (dishes, bowls, and molcajetes); ritual objects (fig­urines, temple models, incense burners, flutes, and pipes); and artifacts used in production (spindle whorls for weaving both cotton and maguey cloth). Our goal is to determine the origin of a wide array of goods and then examine how these goods might have flowed through trade networks. 
Chiconautla as a Postclassic Center 
Ethnohistoric and previous INAA data suggest Chiconautla's primary economic ties would have been with pottery-producing places on the eastern side of the Basin. Yet, the town's location allowed it access to the Basin's most important transporta­tion artery: Lake Texcoco. This is the primary rea­son that George Vaillant chose to excavate the site in 1935, and while he did not publish a detailed analysis of the work, he employed careful field methods and his data are useful today. 
Early Postclassic 
Data on Chiconautla's Early Postclassic occupation were recovered during the excavation of a midden. Vaillant's field notes document an absence of archi­tecture but an abundance of sherds, animal bones, and broken tools (Table I). Animal bone was not

analyzed by Vaillant in the field and was inconsis­tently collected so we cannot present those data. The context contained five complete human skele­tons, but the date of the interments is not clear (Table 2). One individual was placed with a Graphite Black-on-Red bowl; the others were interred without offerings. 

The midden produced seven sherd disks, six Teotihuacan/Early Classic figurines, 97 Mazapan­Tollan figurines, and 14,696 sherds. A small por­tion of the sample (6.59 percent) consists of Coyotlatelco ceramics (dated to AD. 650-850), indicating some settlement in this area during the Epiclassic. The most abundant pottery types are domestic utilitarian vessels, lending support to the suggestion that the feature is a midden. Although jar body sherds were not uniformly counted in these proveniences, over 26 percent of the total number of ceramics in the trench is undecorated sherds from jars (necks, rims, and bodies). Other utilitar­ian ceramics recorded in the trench are comals ( 5 .32 percent), undecorated bowls (5.68 percent), and undecorated basins (12.25 percent). Decorated Early Postclassic Mazapanffollan pottery, primar­ily Red-on-Buff wares in the form of tripod ves­sels, jars, and bowls, account for just over 30 percent of all ceramics. 
Middle and Late Postclassic 
Elsewhere Elson has argued that the structure dug by Vaillant at Chiconautla is best interpreted as a palace occupied in the Middle and Late Postclas­sic (Elson 1999; Elson and Smith 2001; see also Smith 1992, 2008:chapters 2, 4; Sanders and Evans 2001 :983-988; Vaillant and Sanders 2000).

walls and platform surfaces were plastered. Struc­ture walls had stone foundations finished with adobe bricks and then plastered both inside and out. Many rooms contained internal pillars made of solid stone cobbles or stone rings (into which wooden beams could have been inserted). 
During the Late Postclassic the palace was mod­ified as rooms and room blocks were leveled and rebuilt. At times (such as in the zone north of the East Platform rooms and in the zone between the Central Traverse rooms and South Platform rooms) clear plans could not be drawn out. The recon­struction of the Central Traverse rooms is based on Vaillant' s interpretation of fragmentary architecture atop the platform. The South Platform rooms were demolished, filled in with trash including ceram­ics and ash, and covered with a platform. Else­where, the archaeological deposit recovered from this provenience has been evaluated as a ritual dump made during the celebration of an event taking place every 52 years called the New Fire Ceremony (Elson and Smith 2001). It is unclear if rooms or an open platform surface were built here when the rooms were demolished. 
While some details of the palace's ongoing remodeling and renovations are fuzzy, it is clear that by the Late Postclassic it encompassed both ritual and residential areas. The western end of the com­plex was a platform accessed via a wide stairway. This platform was expanded sometime in the Late Postclassic, at which point several room blocks (the West Platform rooms) were knocked down and buried under its surface. A trench excavated off the northwest comer of the platform discovered char­coal, obsidian blades, incense burners, and frag­ments of large baked ceramic tiles that may be a kind of crenellation adorning the roof. Three elon­gated cones of stone and baked clay--0bjects called tenones or clavos-were embedded in one of the platform's stone-faced walls. In codices like Sahagun (1950-82 Bk 11:271, figs. 889, 890) houses described as elite residences (tlatocacalli and tecpilcalli) have stone facing can have circu­lar elements embedded in rows above the door frame, and can have a mosaic pattern of circular elements in panels above and on both sides of the door. The presence of decorative crenellations and clavos in this zone suggests to us that the North Plat­form was part of the palace and probably a center of ritual activity. 
Evans (2004:33) (and recently Smith [2008:45]) have suggested that the building was a noble resi­dence but perhaps not a tecpan-a building that functioned as an administrative palace and the home of a hereditary lord-because it had "small" rooms and lacked a dais or reception room (Evans 2004:8-9). Our interpretation of the Chiconautla residence is that it has a sunken patio surrounded on at least three sides by elevated blocks of rooms. Any of these rooms could have served as a "recep­tion" room while other rooms could have served as residential quarters providing semiprivate living spaces for extended families (see also Smith 2008: Chapters 2, 4). 
The palace contained several key residential fea­tures. The North Platform rooms housed a shallow circular construction of plastered cobbles, proba­bly a sweatbath or temazcalli, and a beehive-shaped structure constructed of rings of straw liberally coated with mud, probably a storage structure or cuexcomatl. Many rooms contained square-shaped hearths or tlacuilli (made of stone slabs projecting into the plaster floor), and at least one was filled with fine white ash. 
In the central sunken patio Vaillant uncovered a small stone construction that he interpreted to be an altar, and it may be that private rites were con­ducted here while more public events incorporat­ing larger groups of people were carried out on the nearby platform. 
Vaillant did uncover some architecture that might date to the Middle Postclassic such as the West Traverse rooms, later buried under the plat­form. In addition, pits placed into the floors of the North Platform rooms show that this area had at least five levels of plaster floors. We do not know the plan of the Middle Postclassic building, but one hypothesis is that it was a smaller structure cen­tering on the North Platform rooms. 
Ceramic Selection and INAA Procedures 
While in Mexico, Vaillant carefully analyzed all the ceramics from excavation (over 100,000 sherds) and tabulated the number of each ceramic type for each provenience unit. He brought a large sample collection (several thousand) of these sherds to New York. Because he coded and described a num­ber of previously unknown or poorly defined ceramic types now recognized as having particu-

lar temporal or cultural significance, Chiconautla' s ceramics are a valuable data set that can be applied to current research questions. 
Some ceramic vessels brought to New York as part of the site's type collection were marked with specific provenience information but we cannot exactly correlate all ceramics we sampled for INAA with particular excavation units. Elson and Nichols selected a sample of 200 ceramics from Vaillant's original types and correlated these with types and variants in the current ceramic typology for the Teotihuacan Valley and eastern Basin of Mexico (Charlton 1968; Cyphers 2000; Garcia Chavez 2004; Hodge and Mine 1991; Lopez 2003; Nichols and McCullough 1986; Nicolas 2003; Parsons 1966, 1971; M. Parsons 1972a, 1972b, 1975; Rat­tray 1966, 1996; Sanders 1986, 1994-96; Sanders and Evans 2001; Whalen and Parsons 1982). We decided to examine excavated data from the palace to look for general patterns of ceramic consump­tion over time and then see how these patterns com­pared with data on the loci of production for the 200 ceramics we sampled with INAA. The com­positional affiliations of all ceramics are listed in Table 3 (Cecil and Glascock 2005). Tables 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 show different distributions (by form and by type) of ceramic types tested (Figure 3). 
Pottery samples were prepared for INAA using procedures standard at MURR. Neutron activation analysis of ceramics at MURR, which consists of two irradiations and a total of three gamma counts, constitutes a superset of the procedures used at most other NAA laboratories (Glascock 1992; Neff 1992, 2000). The pottery samples from Chiconautla were compared to previously established compo­sitional reference groups for the Basin of Mexico and Yautepec (Neff and Glascock 1998; Nichols et al 2002, among others). 
Canonical discriminant analysis (CDA) was employed instead of the traditional principal com­ponents analysis (PCA) because the clays (and tem­pers) used to manufacture the pottery came from volcanic sediments within the interior drainage of the Basin of Mexico. These sediments show sub­tle differences in elemental composition that are dif­ficult to detect with traditional principal components analysis (PCA). Canonical discrimi­nant analysis is a pattern recognition technique that provides maximal separation by creating a ratio of between-group variation to within-group variation based on previously assigned compositional groups (Davis 1986). For the Chiconautla project. we are using previously defined compositional groups established by Neff using CDA. 
Canonical discriminant analysis is the best method by which to illustrate the compositional dif­ferences between Basin of Mexico groups (Neff and Glascock 2000). In order to firmly establish the veracity of the compositional groups detected in the Chiconautla sample, each group was statis­tically verified by calculating Mahalanobis dis­tances. Additional explanations of the interpretation of compositional data obtained from the analysis of archaeological materials are discussed in detail elsewhere (e.g., Baxter I 992, l 994a, l 994b, 2000; Baxter and Buck 2000; Bieber et al I 976; Bishop and Neff 1989; Bishop et al. 1982; Glascock 1992; Harbottle 1976; Neff2000). 
The Tenochtitlan and Cuauhtitlan reference groups include archaeological materials from the western Basin of Mexico. Ceramics from this group have a high hafnium (Hf) to iron (Fe) ratios. The Tenochtitlan reference group consists of ceramics produced in the southwestern Basin that includes the archaeological site of Tenochtitlan and the sur­rounding area. The Cuauhtitlan reference group consists of ceramics produced in the northwestern Basin that includes the archaeological site of Cuauhtitlan and the surrounding area. In bivariate plots, the Tenochtitlan and Cuauhtitlan groups tend to intersect on all elements; however, slight, but still overlapping, separation occurs with bivariate plots of hafnium (Hf) and iron (Fe) and chromium (Cr) and hafnium (Hf). 

The Otumba Macro reference group is com­prised of materials from the northeast Basin of Mexico with a probable source between Chico­nautla and Otumba in the Teotihuacan Valley (Neff et al. 2000:Figure 6). Pottery and clay from this ref­erence group tend to have lower concentrations of chromium (Cr) and higher concentrations of bar­ium (Ba) and calcium (Ca) than the Cuauhtitlan and Tenochtitlan reference groups. Although there are differences, bivariate plots show that the Otumba Macro reference group intersects with the Cuauhti­tlan and Tenochtitlan reference groups. 
In addition to these groups, six samples plot within the Yautepec reference group located south of the Basin of Mexico, in the state of Morelos (Neff and Glascock 1998). This reference group has

Chronology and Ceramic INAA Results from the Aztec Palace 

Context of INAA Samples 
We examined three distinct excavated proveniences from the palace to provide a point of comparison for the INAA data (Table 10). All three areas con­tain food production and storage vessels, decorated serving wares, and incense burners (artifacts used 
4 .62 0 .00 643 100.00 727 100.00 
to bum incense in households and temples). All three areas probably are chronologically distinct and tell us something about ceramic consumption over time. 
The first provenience is a sample of ceramics incorporated into the fill of the West Traverse Rooms upon their demolition and burial beneath a platform. These rooms should belong to the earli­est phase of palace construction. We examined 2,386 sherds from the West Traverse Rooms and found the context contained just over 30 percent decorated Mazapan!follan ceramics, almost 9 per­cent Early (Aztec II) and Late (Aztec III and Aztec III/IV) Black-on-Orange, and almost 9 percent Early Red wares (Black-on-Red and White/Black­on-Red). Thus, these rooms may well have been built during the Middle Postclassic and demolished

during the Late Postclassic, at which time a sub­
stantial amount of Early Postclassic (Mazapan) 
rubbish was used as construction fill. 

Another sample that may date to early in the . palace's history comes from a pit placed under the 
' floor of a corridor ("NT 3") in the North Platform 
Rooms. A total of 643 sherds were sealed below 
five plaster floors. Here Mazapan sherds account 
for just over 13 percent of the fill. Most of the 
ceramics are utilitarian vessels Gar rims and han­
dles, plain bowls, and comals). Surprisingly, Aztec 
Red wares and polychromes (18.04 percent) are 
twice as frequent as Black-on-Orange wares (9.02 
percent). 
Aztec Red wares and polychromes also pre­
dominated in a sample of 727 sherds of fill exca-

vated inside the North Rooms. This context dates to the Late Postclassic. About 30 percent of these sherds are from utilitarian vessels Gar rims and handles, plain bowls, and comals), Black-on­Orange were just over 20 percent of the sample, and Red wares and Polychromes accounted for almost 23 percent of the sample. 
If these contexts contain vessels indicative of types used in the palace, the data suggest a sub­stantial occupation in this zone in the Early Post­classic and that Middle Postclassic people had access to networks supplying Red wares and they preferred these ceramics over more commonly available Black-on-Orange wares. Additionally, the presence of domestic (undecorated bowl, comals, jars, etc.) and ritual pottery (braziers and

censers) further substantiates architectural evi­dence that residential and ritual activities took place in the building. 
INAA Results on Serving Vessels 
Our INAA selection focused on decorated serving 
vessels dating to the Aztec period. The 148 Aztec 
period vessels we sampled include plates, bowls, 
bowls with tri-or tetra-pod supports (some with 
scored interiors called molcajetes), hourglass­
shaped cups, and cups with pedestals. Four of the 
bowls-miniature Black-on-Orange bowls were 
used in spinning thread-not as serving vessels 
(two of these grouped with Tenochtitlan, one with 
Cuauhtitlan, and one was unassigned). 
We sampled 12 Early Postclassic serving ves­
sels. We do not know if the Mazapan pottery we 
analyzed came from Trench Z or the fill of the 
palace. The INAA sample included several types 
of decorated serving bowls and jars: one incised 
Black-on-Brown jar, one Joroba Orange-on-Cream 
bowl, one Red & Black-on-Buff jar, a Red-on­
Cream (white) slipped flat bottom bowl with nub­
bin supports, two Toltec Red-on-Buff bowls, a 
stamped cream-slipped bowl, and five Mazapan 
Wavy-Line bowls. The only import, a Mazapan 
Wavy-Line bowl, was assigned to the nearby 
Cuauhtitlan composition group. The majority of the 
Mazapan ceramics (57.1 percent) were assigned to 
the local Teotihuacan Valley, Otumba-Macro group. 
Four sherds, including one Incised Black-on­
Brown jar, one Red and Black-on-Buff jar, one 
stamped cream slipped bowl, and one Mazapan 
Wavy-Line Red-on-Buff bowl are unassigned. 
The Middle Postclassic sample of Early Aztec pottery includes both decorated Orange wares and Red wares. About one-third (30.8 percent) of the Aztec II Black-on-Orange bowls and molcajetes were made in the Teotihuacan Valley and assigned to the Otumba-Macro group. Black-on-Orange bowls and molcajetes from the Cuauhtitlan com­position group are nearly as common (26.9 per­cent). This is the first time that ceramic imports from the Tenochtitlan composition group are rep­resented in the INAA sample from Chiconautla, and all are Black-on-Orange, both bowls and molca­
jetes. Overall, Black-on-Orange vessels made out­side the Teotihuacan Valley are more common than those from the local composition group. The INAA sample included only three Early Aztec Red wares: a Black-on-Red bowl imported from Morelos, one Black-and-White-on-Red bowl assigned to the Otumba-Macro group, and one Black & White-on­Red bowl that is unassigned. 
The Aztec II-III Black-on-Orange (Parsons 1966:90) specimens show a similar distribution to Aztec II with both bowls and molcajetes assigned to the Cuauhtitlan ( 40 percent) and Otumba Macro (20 percent) groups and one Black-on-Orange bowl imported from the Tenochtitlan group. Black-on­Red bowls defined as "Early-Late transitional" (see'. Mine 1994, 2006) include one import from the Tenochtitlan group, one bowl imported from More­los, and one bowl that is unassigned, along with an incised Black-on-Red bowl from Otumba Macro and one incised bowl that is unassigned. The only "Early-Late transitional" Aztec Black & White-on­Red bowl is not assigned to a composition group. 
Imports of Aztec III Black-on-Orange serving wares from the Tenochtitlan composition group jump to 42. 1 percent in the Late Postclassic, more than double the frequency of Black-on-Orange serving wares from the local Otumba-Macro group 
(17.5 percent) or the Cuauhtitlan group (15 per­cent). Both Aztec III Black-on-Orange basins in the INAA sample come from the Cuauhtitlan group. Imports from Morelos continue in low frequencies 
(1.8 percent). Four miniature Aztec III bowls for spinning cotton were included in the INAA sam­ple: one from the Cuauhtitlan group, two from the Tenochtitlan group, and one spinning bowl is unas­signed. Five Aztec III Black on-Orange molcajetes and two bowls are unassigned. 
Occupants of Chiconautla 's palace used a wide variety of Late Aztec Red wares. Black-on-Red serving wares show a similar distribution pattern to decorated Orange wares with the Tenochtitlan composition group representing the source of 40 percent of the vessels. Otumba Macro and Cuauhti­tlan each account for 10 percent of the Black-on­Red. Four Black-on-Red bowls are unassigned. 
Of Black & White-on-Red bowls, four (or 50 percent) are assigned to the Otumba-Macro group, one bowl is from the Cuauhtitlan group, and three Black & White-on-Red bowls are unassigned. Interestingly, most of the remaining fancy Red wares consisting of bowls of various color combi­nations were made in the Teotihuacan Valley and assigned to the Otumba-Macro group. Four elab­orately decorated Black & White & Orange-on-Red

bowls came from the Cuauhtitlan group and one Black & Brown & Yellow-on-Red bowl was imported from Morelos. Four miscellaneous Red ware bowls are unassigned. 
Unassigned 
Most of the 58 unassigned ceramic samples show a greater than l percent probability of belonging to more than one group; most ambiguities of this type are the result of affinities with the Otumba Macro and Tenochtitlan groups or with the Otumba Macro and Texcoco and Chalco reference groups. Such ambiguities are expected given that there is no clear division of the reference groups in canonical or ele­mental space. Although the unassigned samples cannot be assigned to a reference group with sta­tistical certainty, all but nine of the samples plot within the Cuauhtitlan, Tenochtitlan, and Otumba Macro reference groups. Additionally, when the unassigned samples are compared with all other samples from the Basin of Mexico through Euclid­ean distances, they have membership within the established reference groups where they plot. What we can say with certainty is that the unassigned samples represent local production of the different Basin of Mexico groups and are not imports. 
INAA Results on Drinking Vessels 
Vaillant included hourglass-shaped pulque vessels and copas, pedastaled cups or goblets, in the field as part of the total ceramic count. Fortunately, he separately coded Red ware pulque vessels because of their form, and we can provide additional data on their frequency as a portion of Red ware, on their decoration, and on the INAA results of the vessels sampled. Unfortunately, Vaillant did not code copas (most of these also are Aztec Polychromes) sepa­rately by form (in other words Polychrome copas were coded with Aztec Red wares), so we only have information on their decoration and on the INAA results of the vessels sampled. 
Hourglass vessels are depicted in ethnohistoric sources as containers for pulque, a fermented bev­erage made from maguey that was consumed at cer­emonial events. Officially, pulque drinking was 
restricted to the elderly and nobles, although in 
actuality it was more widely consumed (Berdan 2005 :24; Smith et al. 2003:245). The pulque vessels coded at Chiconautla are Red ware (either Black-on-Red or White/black-on-
Red). Most have either "sun" (Figure 4A) motifs 
or "spiral/step-fret" motifs (Figure 4B), but some 
have more elaborate designs (see Brumfiel 
2004:251-252 for a discussion of the iconography 
of pulque vessels). In the three contexts we ana­
lyzed from the palace excavations, pulque vessels 
appeared as a significant portion of all Red ware 
ceramics coded: 8 percent of the vessels coded 
from the WT excavation, 5 percent of the vessels 
coded from the NT 3 excavation, and 25 percent of 
the vessels coded from the NT 6, 7, and 10 exca­
vations. 
For INAA, we sampled three beautifully deco­
rated pulque vessels with flower and skull motifs 
(Figure 4C) and all three grouped with Cuauhtit­
lan. Two vessels with spiral-step motifs also 
grouped with Cuauhtitlan. The production area for 
two vessels with sun motifs could not be pin­
pointed. Excavation and INAA data allow us to 
suggest that Chiconautla's elites used pulque cups 
in palace rituals and obtained them from the 
Cuauhtitlan area. 
Copas were used to consume cacao-based 
drinks (Coe 1994; Smith et al. 2003:249). The 
copas we sampled cover the range of decoration 
we observed in the sample collection. Most are 
polychrome Aztec Red ware with black, white, 
orange, yellow, and brown designs on a red back­
ground. Seven of the nine sherds sampled were 
made in the Teotihuacan Valley (Otumba-Macro 
group) (Figure 4D). One Black-on-Red copa and 
one Black-on-Orange copa (Figure 4E) grouped 
with Tenochtitlan production zone. 
INAA results on Ritual and Other Ceramics 
Ritual ceramics found in the Chiconautla collec­tion include long-handled incense burners, bra­ziers, flutes, rattles, rasps, bells, and figurines. Data on these artifacts drawn from excavations and INAA support our suggestion that the palace was the center of domestic rituals involving just a few family members and public "popular" rituals involving extended families or the community (see Smith 2002). 

Incense Burners and Braziers 
Palace excavations recovered three types of ceram­ics used to burn incense: long-handled "frying pan" incense burners, braziers that would have sat on the floor, and lobed braziers (that also could have been

used as lamps). As Smith (2002:98) points out, arti­facts like long-handled incense burners were used in both domestic and public "state" ceremonies. Taube (2001) suggests that both domestic and state rituals often were constructed around an Aztec notion regarding the conceptual importance of cen­tering space by moving, sweeping, lighting incense to the directions, and through circumambulation. For example, Motolinia (1996:443) describes a daily ceremony preformed by Aztec women who raised a long-handled incense burner of coals to the four directions thereby making a general offering to the sun, fire, earth, and gods. We might expect

Ceramics for consuming liquids: (A) Black-on Re-hourglass-shaped cup with a sun motif used to con­sume pulque (30.2/2507 A02), (B) a Black-on-Red pulque cup with a spiral motif (30.2/2506A02), (C) a Black on White pulque cup with skull and flower motirs (30.2/2564A02), (D) a Black-on-Red pedestal cup used to consume cacao-based drinks (30.2/2540A01), (E) a Black· on-Orange pedestal cup used to consume cacao-based drinks (30.2/2762).

daily rites in the Chiconautla palace required the use of incense burners. 
We sampled three handles of long-handled incense burners that were made in the shape of a serpent that were not notably different to the eye in manufacture (Figure 5A). Workshops at Otumba made such censers (Charlton et al. 1991 ), but of three handles sampled, one grouped with the Cuauhtitlan production zones, one with the Tenochtitlan zone, and the third was unassigned. A handle with a folded paper fan motif also grouped with Cuauhtitlan (another was unassigned). 
Floor censers or braziers are larger vessels more

commonly described in documents as used in tem­
ple contexts to bum fires or incense (Lopez Lujan 
2005). Brazier fragments in the Chiconautla col­
lection come from vessels of different sizes and fin­
ishes, some of them decorated with appliques in 
the form of flowers, circles, and spirals (Figure 
SB). Al I six of the floor censer fragments we sam­
pled fell into the local Otumba group. 
Lobed braziers could have been suspended by 
cords tied around the vessel's body or through its 
handles and could have been used to bum incense 
or to light rooms (Figure SC). We sampled two 
black carved lobed braziers that appeared similar 
in manufacture and one grouped with Cuauhtitlan; 
the other was unassigned. 
Spindle Whorls 
Spinning cotton and maguey cloth was a task Aztec women worked at regularly and it is not surprising noble ladies may have imported their spinning bowls. Three of the six spindle whorls (small weights used to spin thread) we sampled also were imports (one grouped with Cuauhtitlan, two with Morelos and three were unassigned). 
Flutes, Rattles, Rasps, and Bells 
Chiconautla excavations recovered ceramic flutes with cylindrical stems, often with decorations attached to the sound-producing ends. One such flute is painted with red and black spirals, designs interpreted as symbolizing the role of music and breath to conjure wind and rain (Both 2002, 2007; Taube 2001). Another flute has a probable depic­tion of the Aztec sun symbol and a third has a red­painted circle and cross pattern that may represent the cardinal directions and conceptual shape of the world. Most ceramic fragments in the collection are carved with patterns or have decorations such as ; spirals and flowers. We tested two flute pieces for : INAA and one (a flower) grouped with Cuauhtit­lan and one (a circular design) grouped with 
Tenochtitlan. 
Whistle fragments generally are not complete 
enough for a detailed analysis. One of the two whis­
tles we tested, a human effigy, grouped with 
Tenochtitlan. The second whistle was not assigned 
to a production zone. 
Palace excavations also uncovered fragments of 
rattles often decorated with incised concentric cir­
cles and ceramic bells. We did not include these

unassigned. The Chiconautla collection also con­tains six polished bones made into hollow tubes. Some of the tubes are burnt at one end and may have been used as smoking tubes. Sahagun's infor­mants (I 950-82 Bk 4: 117) describe "bowls with smoking tubes" as one amenity offered to guests during feasts. In their description of the markets, Sahagun's informants (1950-82 Bk 8:69) state that vendors sold "smoking tubes, pipes, and cigars (some) quite resinous and aromatic." 
Figurines 
Aztec figurines are commonly small, mass­produced objects that one could hold in one's hand. Scholars suggest a wide range of interpretations for figurines stemming from ideas about whether clay figures of humans represent mortals or gods (see Millian 198 1; Parsons 1972; Pastory 1983; Smith 2002). In general, figurines might have been employed in domestic rituals such as fertility rites, healing rites, and in acts propitiating divine beings (gods or ancestors). Figurines also represent ani­mals and temple buildings. Many documents also describe larger wood or stone "idols" as objects used primarily in temples (see Smith 1992:331). Vaillant's palace excavations produced the head of such a stone idol that is carved in soft stone and covered in stucco (Figure 6). 
Most figurine fragments in the Chiconautla col­lection date to the Aztec period and are females whose dress and hairstyles evoke motifs associ­ated with deities including Coatlicue (a goddess of spring), Cihuacoatl (invoked in childbirth), and Xochiquetzal (patroness of love, flowers, and embroidery). The collection also contains solid temple models, animals, and male figures dressed like warriors. Fourteen figurines (two dating to the Early Postclassic) were sampled for INAA. Eight of these were unassigned, four assigned to the Otumba Macro group are similar to those mass produced in workshops at Otumba (Charlton J 994 ), one grouped with Cuauhtitlan, and one grouped with Tenochtitlan. 
Nonceramic Imported Goods 
Our data show that Chiconautla's nobles were inter­ested in acquiring nonlocal goods for personal con­sumption and for use in community ritual activities. The use of imported ceramic goods in feasting and public rituals also was a way for nobles to reinforce their position vis-a-vis commoners and Jower­ranking local elites. Exotics like copper, shell, and turquoise probably were in great demand. For example, several copper bells-artifacts often asso­ciated with the gods Tlaloc, Xipe Totec, Quetzal-

coat!, and Coyolxauqui-were recovered in the 
palace (Hosler 1994; Marti 1968; Vargas 
2001:197). 
Items of personal adornment manufactured from jadeite, turquoise, copper, and obsidian are recov­erable in archaeological contexts. These items exemplify luxury goods found at marketplaces or obtained by rulers from incorporated regions as tribute sent to the capital annually, semi-annually, or quarterly (Berdan 1983: 161; Smith and Smith­Heath 1994:360). At Chiconautla, the presence or absence of these goods offers another line of evi­dence for trade and exchange. 
Copper 
Copper bells were produced in the Mixtec area 
from sources in Oaxaca. Copper also came from more far-flung sources in western/northwestern Mexico and the southwest U.S. (Berdan 1983: 168; Hosler 1994; Weigand and Weigand 2001). Two bells of the three bells recovered at Chiconautla are elongated and decorated with simulated wirework while a third has an ovoid or flattened globular shape; both are similar to objects illustrated in the Codex Mendoza (Berdan and Anawalt 1997; Var­gas 2001:198). 
Turquoise 
Turquoise was imported to the Basin of Mexico through long-distance trade and marketplace exchange from northern Mexico and New Mex­ico/Arizona (Berdan 1983:169; Weignad 1977; Weigand and Weigand 2001: 190). Excavations at Chiconautla produced six turquoise disks (five with holes drilled through he center) and one turquoise bead. 
Shell 

pne of us, Mikkelsen, identified that the palace 
shell was imported from the Gulf Coast, and included both freshwater and marine (and in one case terrestrial) species, primarily from groups commonly called mussel, olive, and arks (Table 11 ). A marine conch shell and a marine cockle came from palace excavations. Eight worked shells are fragments of decorative objects meant to be strung onto jewelry or sewn onto clothing. 
Obsidian 
The nearest obsidian source to Chiconautla, Otumba (at the eastern end of the Teotihuacan val­ley), produces primarily gray obsidian. Collections from sites including Xico, Huexotla, and Otumba show that over the course of the Postclassic green obsidian, and in particular green prismatic blades and cores made from Pachuca (state of Hidalgo) 
obsidian, predominate the obsidian assemblage even though gray obsidian was considerably closer (Brumfiel 1986; Milhauser 2005; Parry 1990; Spence 1985). We have not yet chemically sourced obsidian artifacts from Chiconautla. 
Both grey and green obsidian were collected at Chiconautla and the assemblage shows the same predominance of green obsidian detected at other sites-about 80 percent green vs. 20 percent gray 

obsidian. In general, green obsidian is used to make blades and gray obsidian is used to make scraper­like tools (green prismatic blades account for just over 60 percent of the green obsidian assemblage while blades account for only 16 percent of the gray obsidian assemblage). 
A number of finely worked personal adornments came from the palace including an earspool; a rod­shaped lip plug, a style worn by Otomi and others in Central Mexico (Brumfiel et al. 1994; Smith 2006); a button-shaped lip plug, similar to a type produced in workshops at Otumba (Charlton 1994 ); and three small E-shaped eccentrics, possibly made at the Otumba workshops. 
Discussion 

Our analysis has allowed us to develop ideas about exchange and consumption at Chiconautla, a site historically noted as a tlatoani center and an impor­tant Aztec trade node. We consider its patterns of trade and exchange over time with the Triple Alliance capitals of Tenochtitlan and Texcoco and with other city-states, including Otumba, the largest city-state in the Teotihuacan Valley and a regional craft production center. We will describe major pat­terns we see for each time period in light of cur­rent models. 
Early Postclassic 
Sanders (1986) suggested that the Mazapan Wavy­Line Red-on-Buff style perhaps originated at Teoti­huacan, the largest Early Postclassic settlement in the Teotihuacan Valley. For Sanders (1986), the appearance of Orange and cream slipped wares that

have strong parallels to pottery at Tula (and belong to a late subphase of the Early Postclassic called Atlatongo) mark the incorporation of the Teoti­huacan Valley into the Early Postclassic Toltec state centered at Tula in Hidalgo (cf. Smith and Montiel 2001 ). As Sanders anticipated, a majority ofMaza­pan Wavy-line Red-on-Buff bowls originated in the Teotihuacan Valley; however, Teotihuacan did not have a monopoly on this production. 


No imports of Early Postclassic Orange or cream-slipped pottery from a composition group outside the Teotihuacan Valley were identified in our Chiconautla INAA sample; however, the sam­ple size was small and we will consider expanding our sample of this type in future studies. Ongoing analyses of Mazapanffollan ceramics from Cerro Portezuelo in the eastern Basin show that the Teoti­huacan Valley exported this Early Postclassic pot­tery to urban centers elsewhere in the eastern Basin (Nichols et al. 2008). 
Mazapanffollan ceramics were found in a mid­den and in an early structure (West House Rooms) sealed under Late Postclassic construction. It is not clear if the association ofMazapanffollan and Early Aztec (Aztec II) pottery in palace fill was caused by intermixing or indicates chronological overlap. (See Nichols and Charlton [1996] ; Parsons and Gorenflo [2009] fora discussion ofrelated chronol­ogy issues.) The presence of Mazapan/Tollan ceramics suggests continuity of occupation at Chiconautla from the Early to Middle Postclassic. Mazapan buildings might have been razed as newer structures were put up. 
Studies of Early Postclassic ceramics from urban centers show a marked increase in exchange between centers compared to the Epiclassic (Gar­cia 2004; Nichols et al. 2002, 2008). Chiconautla, which was a village and possibly a local ceremo­nial center at this time, however, has only minor amounts of imported pottery (from the Cuauhtit-

Ian composition group). Overall, this is consistent with patterns at rural sites in the Teotihuacan Val­ley where people mostly consumed ceramics made locally (Crider et al. 2007). Perhaps as expected, the pattern suggests limited market exchange of pottery and figurines between Chiconautla and other subregions of the Basin of Mexico during the Epiclassic. 
Middle Postclassic 

Prior to Hodge and Minc's studies, most scholars associated Middle Postclassic city-states with solar markets (Charlton and Nichols 1997: 199-202; Hassig 1985:73; Hicks 1987:93; Smith 1979). Hodge and Mine suggest that the presence of mul­tiple subregional market systems in the Middle Postclassic coincides with the boundaries of city­state confederations (Hodge 1992; Hodge and Mine 1990; Hodge et al. 1993; Mine et al. 1994 ). Nichols et al. (2002:70) see evidence that an overlapping marketing pattern was emerging in the Early Post­classic. They found that although subregional mar­ket systems might have coincided with city-state confederations, pottery also moved across politi­cal boundaries at least along the southern and west­ern margins of the Basin. They, along with Blanton (1996) and Garraty (2006), date the beginnings of Aztec market hierarchies to this time. Middle Postclassic Chiconautla does not fit either the solar market or confederation market model. The palace received imports from almost all the Aztec pottery-making areas in the Basin described in documentary sources-Texcoco, Cuauhtitlan, and Tenochtitlan (this composition group actually includes the pottery-making centers of Culhuacan, Tenochtitlan, and Azcapotzalco [Nichols et al. 2002:31]). The only major excep­tion is Chalco, but our INAA sample included no ,Aztec I or early Chalco-Cholula polychrome­pottery types made at Chalco. 

The Cuauhtitlan and Tenochtitlan production zones were important suppliers of Aztec II Black­on-Orange pottery to Chiconautla; together these two account for 46 percent of the vessels sampled (vs. 31 percent of locally made vessels). Inland sites in the Teotihuacan Valley, including rural vil­lages, also received imports of Aztec II Black-on­Orange pottery from the Cuauhtitlan, Tenochtitlan, Texcoco, and Chalco production zones (Nichols and Charlton 2001 ). Some, ifnot most, of these ves­sels probably moved through Chiconautla. The island center of Xaltocan also saw an increase in imports from the Cuauhtitlan area, along with imports from the southern and southwestern Basin (Nichols et al. 2002:40, Table 5). At the same time, Early Aztec Red ware from 
the Tenochtitlan composition group began to make its way to Chiconautla. Chiconautla also obtained locally manufactured Early Aztec Red ware, per­haps from workshops at Otumba (Charlton et al. 1991, 2000; Nichols 1994). For the first time the palace's occupants acquired Black-on-Red bowls from Morelos. Palace occupants consumed a rela­tively high percentage of Red ware in comparison to more commonly made Orange ware. 
Chiconautla's trade networks expanded in the midst of a volatile political environment of com­petition, shifting alliances, and conflicts among city-states in the Basin. Notwithstanding the polit­ical environment, substantial amounts of pottery moved across confederation boundaries to reach Chiconautla (about 44 percent of the decorated Early Aztec pottery in our sample came from out­side the Teotihuacan Valley). Garraty (2006:136) reports that about half of the Early Aztec Plain Orange pottery he analyzed from Chiconautla was imported from the Texcoco composition group. 
To us, these findings signal several interrelated developments: ( 1) increased pottery manufacturing for export; (2) market expansion in the Middle Post­classic that was linked to the growth of lake trans­portation and trade, with Chiconautla becoming an important hub; and (3) in the case of Chiconautla, dual economic ties with the western Basin and its ethnically Tepaneca (Atzcalpotzalco-headed) con­federation and with the eastern Basin and its eth­nically Acolhua (Texcoco-headed) confederation. Our findings provide further evidence for the pat­tern of overlapping markets and increased subre­gional exchange documented by Nichols et al. (2002:72) during the Middle Postclassic and per­haps also exchange via networks of marriage and kinship and political alliances. 
Late Postclassic 
For the Late Postclassic, Hodge and Mine (Hodge 1992; Hodge and Mine 1990; Hodge et al. 1993; Mine et al. 1994) argue that the political bound­aries of confederations continued to constrain mar­ket exchanges of decorated pottery. Mine (2006)

concludes that the Basin was divided into two hier­archical dendritic networks that conformed to the boundaries between the Acolhua and Mexica ter­ritories (who took over the Tepenaca region by defeating Atzcalpotzalco). 
Hassig ( 1985: 130-144) sees greater regional market integration in the Late Postclassic and attrib­utes it to Tenochtitlan's restructuring of the econ­omy in a core-periphery relationship. The increased reliance on canoe transport and growth in trade with Tenochtitlan as the major production center "had the effect of shifting the secondarymarket cen­ters toward the lakeshore" (Hassig 1985: 135). Rather than a dendritic model, Hassig interprets centers such as Chiconautla as gateways, located at one end of their hinterlands at nodes where the shift from canoes to porters were both a major transportation break and break of bulk point (Has­sig 1985: 136). Tex coco's continuing importance as a market and production, despite its inland loca­tion, Hassig argues, was not so much due to its polit­ical position as caused by the seasonal lowering of lake levels that reduced canoe traffic and segmented the regional market system (Hassig 1985: 142-144 ). 
Other archaeologists see less political control over the economy and argue that by the Late Post­el as sic a complex interlocking market system had developed in the Basin (Blanton et al. 1993; Smith 2003). Still others recognize increasing commer­cialism and greater market integration, but also point to persisting regionalism, especially on the Basin's peripheries, along with increased exchange between imperial capitals and hinter­lands (Charlton et al. 2000; Nichols et al. 2002). Given the increasing complexity of the Postclas­sic economy, perhaps it is not surprising that scholars working with different data sets and look­ing at the production and exchange of different classes of goods draw different conclusions about market organization. 
We expected that the Texcoco composition group would be well represented in our INAA sam­ple of decorated ceramics from Chiconautla. Mine 
(2006) had found that Aztec Red ware in the east­ern and southern Basin tended to circulate within confederation boundaries. Additionally, in Nichols and Charlton's (2001) regional INAA sample, one­fifth of the Aztec II Black-on-Orange and about one-quarter of the Aztec III Black-on-Orange pot­tery from sites in the Teotihuacan valley came from the Texcoco composition group. Garraty's (2006) study of Aztec plainwares determined that Chico­nautla's palace elites used Aztec Plain Orange ware from the Texcoco composition group during both the Middle and Late Postclassic (Garraty 2006). Moreover, we know that in the 1430s Chiconautla had a tlatoani linked to Texcoco's through marriage (Alva Ixtlilx6chitl 1975-77: 2:89-90; Hodge and Blanton 1966:230). 
Yet, despite Chiconautla's incorporation into the Acolhua confederation, palace occupants : 
obtained relatively little decorated pottery from Texcoco area workshops. Over 40 percent of the Aztec III Black-on-Orange pottery in the palace came from the Tenochtitlan composition group. By comparison, Nichols and Charlton (200 I)in their regional INAA sample from the Teotihuacan Val­ley found that imports from the Tenochtitlan com­position group accounted for about 20 percent of the Aztec III Black-on-Orange for the Teotihuacan Valley as whole and about 15 percent at the urban center of Otumba. Our data show that the palace's residents continued to import ceramics, and now they drank pulque in Black & White-on-Red ves­sels from the Cuauhtitlan region and used elabo­rately decorated Red ware bowls that were manufactured in the Teotihuacan Valley, Cuauhti­tlan, and Tenochtitlan production zones, and even in Morelos. Chiconautla obtained incense burners, braziers, and figurines from Cuauhtitlan, the Teoti­huacan Valley, and Tenochtitlan. We attribute the large volume of Tenochtitlan production zone imports to several factors: ( 1) increased production and marketing of pottery, especially Black-on­Orange, made in the southwest Basin; (2) Chico­nautla's lakeshore location and growth as a trade center; and (3) preferences of Chiconautla's palace elites. Our findings support some aspects of Has­sig' s core-periphery model, but not others. Although imports of ceramics from the Tenochti­tlan production zone increased dramatically, Chico­nau tla continued to obtain pottery from other production zones in the Basin. 
We do not know the consumption patterns of commoners at the site. Unfortunately, the only com­parative information from outside Chiconautla's palace come from surface collections at the site made in the 1960s. Nichols and Charlton's (2001) analysis of 23 specimens of decorated pottery (using INAA) from surface collections at Chico-

nautla found two (two Black-on-Orange dishes 
typed as Aztec III and Aztec IV) of 23 samples came 
from the Texcoco composition group. Thus, Chico­
nautla imported some decorated as well as Plain 
Orange ware pottery from the Texcoco area. The 
high proportion of Tenochtitlan imports in the 
palace sample may reflect preferences of Chico­
nautla's elites, as well as production factors. 
Our interpretation of these data is that the expan­
sion of a regional market system, combined with 
Chiconautla's strategic location in the lake trans­
portation system and growth as a trading hub, meant 
that Chiconautla had broad access to imports from 
the western Basin and from the far reaches of the 
empire. At the same time, the Late Postclassic saw 
an especially dramatic increase in the volume of 
pottery exported from the Tenochtitlan composi­
tion group. Charlton et al. (2008:265) argue that in 
the Late Postclassic, full-time professional potters 
made Black-on-Orange Aztec III pottery. The 
expansion of production in the Tenochtitlan area 
coupled with overall growth in the market system 
allowed ceramic exports from the Tenochtitlan 
composition group and to a lesser extent the 
Cuauhtitlan composition group to penetrate mar­
ket areas in the eastern Basin. However, further 
inland in the Teotihuacan Valley import levels were 
lower and regionalism persisted (Charlton et al. 
2008). 
Chiconautla's elites probably used their wealth (some derived from taxing the local market and some derived from tribute [Mine 2006:93]) to fund architectural expansions of the palace and to engage in elite activities. We have marshaled excavation data on the palace's architecture and ritual objects to show that by the Late Postclassic, this building included domestic and public ritual spaces. Public rituals used incense burners, braziers, and obsid­;ian blades, and elsewhere Elson and Smith (2001) have suggested that one public ritual taking place in the palace was the celebration of an event called the New Fire ceremony that took place every 52 years. Other more regularly celebrated rituals incor­porated copas, pulque vessels, pipes, and bone smoking tubes (possibly used in elite feasts). Rasps, bells, and flutes produced music to accompany feasts as well as religious celebrations. Private domestic ceremonies employed long-handled censers and figurines. Thus, palace elites carried out private events and sponsored events for others. 

INAA indicates that some objects needed to con­duct these activities came from the Tenochtitlan and Cuauhtitlan production zones. 
Chiconautla fits a model suggesting that as the Trip le Alliance took shape, an important factor fuel­ing market growth was the demand for status-linked goods that, in tum, increased and intensified link­ages between elites across city-state boundaries. INAA data (especially data from Black-on-Orange pottery) may support historical documentation indi­cating direct political and perhaps social ties to Tenochtitlan, but we also can make a good case that Chiconautla's elites, even if not related, were strongly influenced by the likes and desires of cap­ital elites. Simply put, as Tenochtitlan solidified its position as the capital of the Aztec empire, ceramic production expanded in the southwest Basin. This idea is outlined in the work of prior scholars who have found that decorated Aztec pot­tery in the Late Postclassic flowed west to east and that little pottery made in the Acolhua domain (Tex­coco region and Teotihuacan Valley) was consumed in significant amounts in the western Basin (Gar­raty 2006; Hodge 1992; Hodge and Mine 1990; Hodge et al. 1993; Ma 2003; Mine 2006; Mine et al. 1994; Nichols and Charlton 2001; Nichols et al. 2002). At the same time, products made near the center of political power became more popular in the Basin, including among provincial elites like those occupying Chiconautla's palace. 
Conclusions 
An analysis of excavated data and INAA on pot­tery from Chiconautla detects a shift from a pat­tern of exchange through restricted subregional markets for ceramics in the Early Postclassic; to continuing expansion of market exchange with sub­stantial amounts of decorated serving wares being traded beginning in the Middle Postclassic through overlapping exchange networks that became more hierarchical; to a continuation of these trends in the Late Postclassic in conjunction with the emergence of Tenochtitlan and to a lesser degree Texcoco as dominant markets, craft producers, and political centers. 
Based on Chiconautla's political history and previous studies of Aztec ceramics in the eastern Basin, we expected to find significant imports of decorated wares from the Texcoco region, mirror-

ing data produced from recent INAA studies of plain orange ware (Garraty 2006). That we did not indicates that the flow of pottery and choices of con­sumers also were influenced by the manufacturing power and political status of urban centers and by geography. The persistent regionalism seen in the Otumba city-state and elsewhere in the northeast­ern periphery of the Basin (Charlton and Nichols 1991, 2001) is not evident at Chiconautla because of its lakeshore location and importance as a trad­ing center. 
We suspect that the predominance of fancy dec­orated vessels, including bowls, copas, andpulque vessels from producers other than Texcoco reflects Chiconautla's strategic location, expanded pottery manufacturing in the southwestern Basin ( espe­cially in and around Tenochtitlan), and the fact the nobles were very keen to acquire nonlocal items for use in their feasts and other activities that demonstrated status to members of their own social stratum. Chiconautla elites were well-integrated into Basin-wide modes of elite ritual behavior. We propose that they probably were less constrained by the political and physical landscape than com­moners and elites in other area of the eastern Basin. 
Our research also adds to a growing base of compositional and stylistic studies showing that different types of ceramics had different market spheres and patterns of production and consump­tion. Much research has focused on comparing changes from the Middle to the Late Postclassic, an era associated with the development of the Aztec empire. Although the sample of Early Postclassic pottery analyzed from Chiconautla is small, the findings are consistent with other studies indicat­ing that equally substantial economic changes took place from the Early to the Middle Postclassic and that such changes can be explored and explained in future studies.
