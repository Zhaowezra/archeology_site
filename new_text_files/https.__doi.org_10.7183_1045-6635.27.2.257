
LOW­INTENSITY INVESTIGATIONS AT THREE SMALL SITES ALONG 
LAKE XALTOCAN IN THE NORTHERN BASIN OF MEXICO 

Christopher T. Morehart and Destiny L. Crider 
This report describes recent low­intensity archaeological investigations conducted at three small sites in the northern Basinof Mexico. The sites are represented by surface artifact scatters and are located on the former shoreline of the now­drainedLake Xaltocan, originally one of the principal lakes in this region. Fieldwork included mapping surface concentrations andsite dimensions, conducting test excavations, and recovering surface collections. The analysis of surface artifacts focusedon determining site function and chronology. Based on fieldwork and analysis, we propose that Michpilco likely was a habi­tation site with a substantial occupation during the Classic period. The smaller Non­Grid 5 site was occupied during theEpiclassic period, and site Non­Grid 6 was occupied during the Late Postclassic to colonial periods. These sites reflectoccupations in a lacustrine landscape throughout different periods. They also exemplify the rapid disappearance and threatof destruction that looting, infrastructural development, and agriculture pose to archaeological sites in the region.

El sitio No­Cuadrícula 6 representa a unaaldea lacustre ocupada durante los periodos posclásico tardío y colonial. Estos tres sitios demuestran la ocupación de unpaisaje lacustre durante períodos diferentes. Los sitios pequeños como estos están desapareciendo rápidamente debido a lossaqueos, el desarrollo de infraestructura y la agricultura.

Michpilco 
Michpilco is a small site on the former lake mar­gin northof modern Xaltocan(Figure2).Surfaceartifacts at Michpilco cover an area of approxi­mately 4ha.The site is extensively looted. Field­work directed by Elizabeth Brumfiel in 1997 in­cluded mapping, surface collection, and two testexcavations (Brumfiel 1998). Two radiocarbonassays date the site to the Classic period (A.D.135–380; Brumfiel 1998:2). Brumfiel character­izedMichpilcoasa “Classic/Epiclassicsite,prob­ably a daughter community of Teotihuacan, spe­cializing in the exploitation of lacustrineresources” (2005:351).The central lakes, includ­ing Xaltocan, provided key resources for Teoti­huacan (e.g., fish, birds, reeds, insects, and salt),which is located 20 km to the east (Cowgill2015:167). Excavations at Michpilco did not un­cover intact archaeological features (Millhauser1998; Rodríguez Alegría 1998), leading Mill­hauser (1998) to suggest that the site was builtfrom perishable materials, and perhaps repre­sented a lacustrine port. 
In 2012, the authors conducted additional re­search at the site. It has three concentrations of surface artifacts, all which areseverely disturbed(Supplemental Figure 2). We conducted test ex­cavations at two of these concentrations: Mich­1 and Mich­2 (Figure 3; Sanchez et al. 2015). Weexcavated two 2 x 2 m units in Mich­1 and three in Mich­2.The stratigraphy for each unit reflectscommondepositionalprocesses:a10–20cmlayerofwindblownsediment drapedoverstrata ofwa­ter­deposited sedimenton topof culturally sterilelacustrine sediment (Supplemental Figure 3).Wedid not identify any archaeological features. Theexposed stratigraphy of 10 looters’ pits, withdepthsbetween29 and 94 cm, also did not revealthe presence of any features.
The excavated ceramics were associated with a range of domestic and ritual activities (Supple­mental Table 1; Supplemental Figure 4; Crider2015). Vessel types associated with food prepa­ration, serving, and storage included comales,bowls,jars,basins,three­prongburners,andollas.Ritual ceramic objects include incense burners,Tlaloc jars, and figurines. Occupants exploitedlacustrine resources, probably fish or birds. Werecovered 151 net weights, sherds shaped intodisks and side­notched to hold nets. Eighty­one

net weights were made from sherds of Thin Or­angepottery,awarecommonatTeotihuacanfromtheMiccaotli/EarlyTlamimilolpaphase (ca.A.D.100–300) to the Metepec phase (ca. A.D. 550–600/650;Rattray2001:311).ThinOrange potteryis widespread at Classic sites the northern Basinof Mexico (Parsons et al. 2008:367). Since netweights are re­used sherds, assigning usage to aspecific period of time is difficult, but they mayreflect Classic period activities.
The distribution of chronologically diagnosticelements in the ceramic assemblage points to aprominentClassicperiodoccupationatMichpilco,particularlyduringtheMetepecphase(A.D.550–600/650). Eighty­six monochrome brown bowlsherds had annular supports and a streaky finish,characteristic of Metepec phase ceramic vessels(Rattray2001:279,283)(SupplementalFigure3).We recovered 146 sherds of Thin Orange bowls,includinghemisphericalbowlswithannularbases.Wealsocollectedstampedandincisedbowlsherdsthat exhibit Classic period characteristics (Crider2015:104).Elevensherdsfrompolishedblackjarswererecovered,whichoccuratTeotihuacanfromthe Miccaotli phase to the Early Xolalpan phase
(A.D. 100–400) (Rattray 2001:115). The jar as­semblage includes Classic period Tlaloc and in­cised globular jars. Five Classic period floreros were documented; two had annular bases similarto those at Cerro Portezuelo (Crider 2011:109).AClassic period two­chambered candelero with mattesurface,typicaloftheXolalpanandMetepecphases, was found. We found 10 prongs of three­prong burners, a common vessel type during theClassic period that possibly served as stoves(Sanders 1966:129). One prong had a moldedface,common during theMetepecphaseatTeoti­huacan (Rattray 2001:111). Finally, many of thefigurines found at Michpilco were characteristicof the Classic period (Supplemental Figure 4; seeBarbour 1998).
EpiclassicandPostclassicceramicsarepresentin low frequencies. Coyotlatleco Red­on­Buffbowls, diagnostic of the Epiclassic period (A.D.650–900; Rattray1966),were documented.Post­classic Orange ware is more frequent than Coy­otlatelcoat Michpilco, with133sherds,includingbowls, dishes, and molcajetes. They include anEarly Postclassic, Black­on­Orange bowl (AztecI), and a Late Postclassic Black­on­Orange dish(Aztec III). Epiclassic to Colonial period comal forms were found. We recovered 77 rim sherds of thick, high­walled comales, characteristics ofthe Epiclassic period (Parsons 1971:284). Earlyand Middle Postclassic comales are typicallythick, flat to flaring, and we classified 77 sherdswiththese attributesas Postclassic,although theylikely date to the Early to Middle Postclassic.Comales become much thinner and flatter from the Late Postclassic to Colonial period, with rimtips more beveled, squared, or grooved (Garraty2006:79–81; Parsons 1966:206). There were 31low, thin­walled comales with beveled rims indi­cating a Late Postclassic to Colonial occupation.We classified 20 additional thin­walled comales with square and grooved rims as Colonial.

The Non­Grid 5 Site 
The Non­Grid 5 site has a moderate surface den­sity of artifacts scattered uniformly over approx­imately 2 ha (Figure 2). The site is located on aformer beach ridge visible only in older aerialphotographs. Today the area is used for farming(Figure 2b). We did not find evidence of lootingbecause local residents control and monitor the farmland. Nonetheless, agriculture, in particularmechanical plowing, poses a significant threat tothesite.Wecollecteddiagnosticsurface ceramicsand other artifacts to assess the chronology andfunction of the site. 
The artifact assemblage indicates that Non­Grid 5 was an Epiclassic residential site. Vesselforms include ollas, hemispherical brown bowls,basins, incense burners, decorated pottery, andfigurines(SupplementalTable2).Grindingstonesinclude one metate, six manos, and one pestle(Supplemental Figure 5). Thirty lithic flakes, 37blades, six points, five biface fragments, and onecore are made from gray obsidian. We docu­mented only 14 blades and four flakes of greenobsidian,distinctiveofthePachuca sourceinpre­sent­dayHidalgo.Wealsorecoveredadeerantlerlikely used for blade production.
OurchronologyoftheNon­Grid5siteisbasedonceramicmaterials(Morehart2009).MostsherdsarefromvesselsdiagnosticoftheEpiclassicperiod(Supplemental Figure 6). Stamped and incisedsherds resembled those found at other EpiclassicsitesintheBasin(Crider2011).Twenty­fivesherdshaveexteriorreddesigns(e.g.,volutes,undulatinglines,andsteps)diagnosticofCoyoylatelcopottery.Other Epiclassic ceramics include brown bowlfragments with streaky red paint (n=41). Mosthave exterior red paint that extends to the interiorrim, a common characteristic of Epiclassic andEarly Postclassic pottery (Cobean 1990; Parsons1971:284).WealsorecoveredafewMacanaRed­on­Buff sherds dating to the terminal Epiclassicto Early Postclassic (Cobean 1990:289).
The utilitarian pottery is also characteristic ofthe Epiclassic period.The sample includes seventhick,high­walled comal rimsherdscharacteristic of the Epiclassic (see above).AdditionalEpiclas­sic vessel forms include nine rolled olla rims, 12double­loopedollahandles,11 triangular cazuela rims, and 23 ladle rims. Some bowl sherds have annularbases,andtwohaveremnantsofredpaintsimilar to Coyotlatelco pottery. We also foundfour sherds ofcomposite silhouette bowls, whichare common at Epiclassic sites (Crider 2011:96).
Ritual artifacts from Non­Grid 5 support theEpiclassic period dating of the site. Three ladleincense burner handles (sahumadores) were col­lected. They were thick and made from tan to or­ange pastes, common characteristics of the Epi­classic and Early Postclassicperiodinthisregion(Cobean 1990; Crider 2011; Rattray 1966). Fif­teenfragments of figurines were recovered (Sup­plemental Figure 7), including two flat anthro­pomorphic figurines that were mold­made andthree that were hand­molded. One of the mold­made figurines was made from an orange pastewithaheaddressandmodifiedincisors.Theother depicts a woman with ear spools, huipil, and a V­shaped quechquemitl across thechest, featurescommonly seen during the Epiclassic (Rattray1966).The chronological placement of the hand­molded figurines is less clear. One has a two­tiered headdress with curled lips and modifiedincisors. Another has remnants of a headdress and disk­shaped eyes, but undefined facial fea­tures. The third figurine represents an individualcarrying (and possibly breastfeeding) a child. 


The Non­Grid 6 Site 
The Non­Grid 6 site is located on the western border of farmlands belonging to the moderntown of Xaltocan. It extends 500 m north­to­south and 150 m east­to­west on a former beach ridgeon the ancientshoreof Lake Xaltocan(Fig­ure 2). The site had been disturbed by lootingand by condominium construction immediatelyto the west (Figure 2a; Supplemental Figure 8).Morehart (2009) undertook surface collectionsaspart ofthelakebedsurvey.Two10­mdiametercircular collection units were placed in an un­looted area with high artifact density. All lithicmaterial, rim sherds, and decorated body sherdswere collected and tabulated. 
The nature of the artifact assemblage suggeststhat Non­Grid6 was a habitation site datingto theLate Postclassic period and colonial times.Vesselforms include decorated and undecorated bowls,dishes, molcajetes, comales, and ollas (Supple­mental Table 3). Incense burners are present but

not abundant. We found one large spindle whorl,likely used for spinning maguey fibers. The lithicassemblage includes one white chert flake, 121blades, 22 flakes, and 1 core of green obsidian,and one blade and 12 flakes of gray obsidian.
The ceramic materials date to the Late Post­classicand Colonialperiod (Supplemental Figure9), particularly Orange and Red wares commonduring this time. Late Postclassic Aztec III andLate Postclassic to ColonialAztec IV pottery arecommon.Late Postclassic and colonial RedWare also is represented, including Plain Red, Black­on­Red, and Black­and­White­on­Red. Twosherds are Colonial period Majolica. Fabric­markedpottery,usedinsaltproduction,ispresentbut not abundant. Most comales are thin­walled with incurved and beveled rims. 


Conclusions 
The investigation of three sites presented in thisreportcontributes toour understandingofthe set­tlement history of Lake Xaltocan. Given the sizeof these sites and the surface density of artifacts,they likely would be classified as hamlets or vil­lages according to the settlement hierarchy cate­goriesestablished by the Basin ofMexicoSurvey(Sanders et al. 1979; SupplementalTable 4).Thesite of Michpilco had the longest­lasting occupa­tion. It has materials attributable from the Epi­classic to Colonial period, but the occupation ofthe site was most substantial during the Classicperiod(Metepecphase).Itispossibletheresidentsof Michpilco specialized in exploiting lake re­sources for Teotihuacan, and that they gainedconsiderable autonomy fromTeotihuacan duringthe political decline of that state during the laterMetepec phase (Cowgill 2015:233).
Non­Grid 5 dates to the Epiclassic period andlikely was a habitation site. During this time ofgeopolitical competition following the decline ofTeotihuacan, most of the regional population wasnucleated in larger settlements (Mastache et al.2002:45, 62; Parsons 2008:72). Many small Epi­classic sites in the northern Basin of Mexico lack decorated pottery, unlike other areas decoratedpotteryiscommonatbothcentersandnoncenters(Parsons2008:371).Giventheprevalenceofdec­orated pottery at Non­Grid 5, residents possiblyhadconnectionselsewhereintheBasinofMexico. 
Non­Grid 6 represents the remains of a LatePostclassic to colonial site on the western shore of Lake Xaltocan.At that time, the polity of Xal­tocan had lost its independence, and local resi­dentswereincorporatedinto theAztec andSpan­ish empires (Brumfiel 2005). The site resemblestwo hamlets (Zu­Az­274, Zu­Az­275) located tothenorth(Parsons2008:326–328;(Figure2).Thepresence of small settlements along the edge ofthe former lake might indicate local populationdispersal when the Aztec empire expanded intotheregion.Afterthe Spanishconquest, haciendasabsorbed land, and residents congregated at thecolonial town of Xaltocan (Gibson 1964).
The archaeological sites presented in this re­port are located in a rapidly transforming area.Looting, mechanized agriculture, and condo­minium development pose major threats to theirpreservation. These activities endanger archaeo­logical resources(particularlysmall sites), agrar­ian economies, and local ecosystems.The condi­tion of these sites illustrates how economic change in Mexico not only affects not only his­torical resources but, as Parsons (2008:104)warns, reshapes entire landscapes.
