
TIWANAKU INFLUENCE IN THE SOUTH CENTRAL ANDES: STRONTIUM ISOTOPE ANALYSIS AND MIDDLE HO RIZON MIGRATI ON 
Kelly J. Knudson 
Although the presence ofTiwanaku-style material culture throughout southern Peru, northern Chile, and western Bolivia is well documented, the nature ofTiwanaku influence during the Middle horizon (A.D. 500-1100) is variously attributed to imperial expansion or economic and/or religious relationships. Strontium isotope data from archaeological human remains from Tiwanaku-affiliated sites identified first-generation immigrants from the Lake Titicaca basin outside of the Tiwanaku heartland at the Peruvian site of Chen Chen. These data provide an important component to studies that demonstrated close biological relationships during the Middle horizon but could not demonstrate the direction of population movement. How­ever, no immigrants from the Lake Titicaca basin were identified at the San Pedro de Atacama cemeteries of Coyo Orien­tal, Coyo-3, and Solcor-3. At the sites ofTiwanaku, Tilata, lwawe, and Kirawi, strontium isotope ratios were also variable, and demonstrate movement within the Lake Titicaca basin. This demonstrates that Tiwanaku influence involved direct col­onization in the Moquegua Valley but that in other regions, like San Pedro de Atacama, local inhabitants adopted Tiwanaku­style material culture. This elucidates the complex and highly variable relationships between the Tiwanaku heartland and peripheral sites during the Middle horizon.

I conclude with a discussion of Tiwanaku residential mobility, and the nature of Tiwanaku influence. 
The Tiwanaku Polity: Models and Mobility 
The widespread distribution ofTiwanaku-style arti­facts in the South Central Andes and the relation­ship between the Tiwanaku polity and Tiwanaku­affiliated peripheral sites have been explained in a number of ways. Tiwanaku may have been an expansionist state or centralized bureaucracy that established colonies throughout the South Central Andes (Kolata 1982; Kolata 1992, 1993a, 1993b; Ponce Sangines 1972; Stanish 2003). If ruling elites at the site ofTiwanaku established colonies to gain access to valuable resources, first-generation migrants at Tiwanaku-affiliated sites were colonists sent by the Tiwanaku polity. This would imply that the Tiwanaku polity was an expansionist state or

empire, although the establishment of state-directed colonies is certainly not the only attribute of empires (e.g., Alcock et al. 2001; Doyle 1986; Sinopoli 1994; Smith and Montiel 2001; Smith and Schreiber 2005). 
The establishment of colonies and imperial expansion is, of course, only one of myriad ways in which groups interact (e.g., Alcock et al. 2001; Given 2004; Gosden 2004; Lightfoot 1995; Light­foot and Martinez 1995; Renfrew and Cherry 1986; Stein 1999, 2005). Some scholars have argued that the spread of Tiwanaku material culture is best explained by economic and/or religious influence (Browman 1980, 1984; Dillehay and Nunez A. 1988). Here, the movement of material culture did not involve the settlement of distant zones by indi­viduals from the Tiwanaku heartland. 
In models ofTiwanaku political integration that emphasize the role of the ayllu, a self-defined kin group that is a basic political and social unit in the Andes, residential mobility and movement outside of the Lake Titicaca basin would have not been con­trolled by the Tiwanaku polity. For example, Juan Albarracin-Jordan (1992, 1996, 2003) argues that the Tiwanaku polity was a loosely centralized seg­mentary state or integrated nested hierarchy that relied upon ayllu organization, reciprocity, and ide­ology rather than direct control of local elites. Other scholars have similarly emphasized the role of local communities while deemphasizing the role of Tiwanaku state control, particularly in the vast agri­cultural systems of the Lake Titicaca basin (e.g., Erickson 1988, 1998; Graffam 1990, 1992). If the Tiwanaku polity did not utilize direct control by local elites, Tiwanaku influence outside of the Lake Titicaca basin may have been characterized by the establishment of a "vertical archipelago" of multi­ethnic productive colonies (Mujica et al. 1983) based on John Murra's (1972, 1985a, 1985b) sem­inal work. 

More recently, some scholars have continued to move away from globalist or "top-down" perspec­tives of the expansion of the Tiwanaku polity to agency-oriented or "bottom-up" perspectives (e.g., Goldstein 2000a, 2005; J anusek 1999, 2002, 2003a, 2004a, 2004b, 2005a, 2005b ). For example, exca­vations at majorTiwanaku-affiliated site complexes in the Moquegua Valley of southern Peru led Paul Goldstein ( 1989, 1992, 1993) to conclude that these sites were part of a centrally governed provincial 
system that provided maize to Lake Titicaca basin inhabitants. More recently, extensive regional sur­veys and new data on the development of Moquegua Valley Tiwanaku enclaves have led to the use of a diasporic archipelago model to explain the heterarchical and segmentary nature of the Tiwanaku state and the development ofTiwanaku­affiliated sites outside of the Lake Titicaca basin (Goldstein 2000a, 2005). Owen (2005) has also used a two-stage diasporic model to elucidate Tiwanaku expansion in the Moquegua and Ilo Val­leys. According to these models, first-generation migrants from the Lake Titicaca basin were pre­sent in the Moquegua Valley, but were not sent by 
the Tiwanaku ruling elites to colonize the area. 
Strontium isotope analysis has great potential to test the various hypotheses regarding the nature of Tiwanaku influence by identifying first­generation migrants from the Tiwanaku heartland in the southeastern Lake Titicaca basin who were buried in Tiwanaku-affiliated sites. I used strontium isotope analysis to test the hypotheses that indi­viduals buried in the Tiwanaku-affiliated sites of Chen Chen, Coyo-Oriental, Coyo-3, and Solcor-3 lived in the southeastern Lake Titicaca basin dur­ing enamel formation in the first years of life. The presence of first-generation migrants from the Lake Titicaca basin in Tiwanaku-affiliated sites would support the models of Tiwanaku as an expansion­ist state with colonies, a vertical archipelago, or a diasporic archipelago. Only when combined with other lines of evidence can the strontium isotope evidence help to distinguish these models of the nature of Tiwanaku influence. Finally, strontium isotope analysis of individuals buried at Tiwanaku and Tiwanaku-affiliated sites within the Lake Tit­icaca basin is used to test the hypothesis that diver­sity in geographic origins was an important aspect of Tiwanaku ritual activity at Tiwanaku. 
Previous Research on 
Tiwanaku Residential Mobility 

Multiple lines of evidence have been used to test models ofTiwanaku influence. For example, in the mid-altitude Moquegua Valley, domestic and pub­lic architecture as well as residential and mortuary artifact assemblages suggest that the inhabitants of Chen Chen were from or affiliated with the Tiwanaku heartland in the Lake Titicaca basin

(Goldstein 1989, 1990, 1992, 1993, 2000a, 2000b, 2003, 2005; Goldstein and Owen 2001; Moseley et al. 1991; Owen 2005; Owen and Goldstein 2001 ). This diaspora community specialized in pro­ducing maize for export to the Lake Titicaca basin (Goldstein 2000a, 2005). Similarly, genetic analy­ses, including biodistance analysis using cranial nonmetric traits and aDNA of human skeletal remains from Chen Chen, shows that the genetic distance between the inhabitants of Chen Chen and Tiwanaku was smallest during the Middle horizon (Blom 1999, 2005; Blom et al. 1998; Lewis 2005; Lewis et al. 2007; Lewis et al. 2005; Lewis and Stone 2005). 
However, the direction of population movement has not been determined. In other words, decreased genetic distance between Ti wanaku and Chen Chen may be the result of individuals from Tiwanaku moving to Chen Chen. This would support a model of Chen Chen as either a colony or diaspora com­munity of the Tiwanaku polity. However, as analy­sis of the cranial modification styles suggests (Blom 1999, 2005; Blom et al. 1998), decreased genetic distance could also be the result of individuals mov­ing from Chen Chen to Tiwanaku. 
There is also evidence for Tiwanaku influence in other regions that could have provided mid­altitude crops to Lake Titicaca basin populations. For example, the Cochabamba region of eastern Bolivia may have been colonized by Tiwanaku, although a cultural, but not biological, relationship may have existed between the two areas (Caballero 1984; Higueras-Hare 1996, 2001; Ibarra Grasso and Querejazu Lewis 1986; Kolata 1993a; O'Brien 2003; Stanish 2003). In addition, there are at least three cemeteries in the Azapa Valley of northern Chile that contain individuals buried with exclu­sively Tiwanaku-style artifacts, and scholars are using various lines to evidence to examine the 
Tiwanaku presence, or lack thereof, in this region (Goldstein 1996, 2005; Rothhammer et al. 2006; Rothhammer and Santoro 2001; Sutter 2000, 2005, 2006; Sutter and Mertz 2003). Current and future research in these regions will undoubtedly eluci­date Tiwanaku influence in these regions. 
When compared to the archaeological and bioar­chaeological evidence from the Moquegua, Azapa, and Cochabamba Valleys, the evidence for Tiwanaku influence in the San Pedro de Atacama oasis of northern Chile is very different. There is 
much more evidence that a substantial local popu­lation coexisted with individuals buried with Tiwanaku material culture in San Pedro de Ata­cama. At cemeteries such as Coyo Oriental, Coyo­3, and Solcor-3, there is evidence ofTiwanaku-style material culture such as snuff tablets, ceramics, and textiles as well as local artifacts and foreign goods from northern Chile and northwestern Argentina (Berenguer 1978; Berenguer et al. 1980; Costa Jun­queira and Llagostera 1994; Llagostera 1996; Llagostera et al. 1988; Oakland 1986; Oakland Rodman 1992, 1994; Oakland Rodman and Fer­nandez 2000; Stovel 2001, 2002; Torres 1985, 1987, 2001, 2005; Torres and Conklin 1995). The types of Tiwanaku-style artifacts found in San Pedro de Atacama cemeteries mainly consist of small, portable, and ritually important artifacts. Given the long caravan trip between the Lake Tit­icaca basin and San Pedro de Atacama, it is unlikely that the San Pedro de Atacama region ever con­tained agricultural colonies affiliated with the Tiwanaku polity. Instead, it is more likely that the important mineral resources near the oasis, such as turquoise, lapis lazuli, and metal ores, were traded, and that the oasis was an important source for water and food on long caravan trips (Stanish 2003; Tor­res and Conklin 1995). 
Interpretations of the relationship between San Pedro and Tiwanaku are highly variable. Based on biodistance analysis of cranial nonmetric traits, which showed the greatest genetic variability in the oasis during the Middle horizon, a Tiwanaku population may have been physically present at the oasis (Varela 1997; Varela and Cocilovo 2000), while Amy Oakland Rodman (1992) came to the same conclusion based on her excellent analysis of mortuary textiles. However, based on mortuary ceramics and cranial modification styles, other researchers have argued that there was not a Tiwanaku population at the oasis (Stovel 2002; 
Torres-Rouff 2002). It is possible that the increased genetic variability at the site resulted from increased caravan traffic and contacts with other regions, not Tiwanaku colonization. 
In conclusion, previous research on Tiwanaku residential mobility has demonstrated close bio­logical and cultural ties between the Tiwanaku heartland and other regions in the South Central Andes. However, Tiwanaku-style artifacts could be adopted by local populations and genetic analy-

ses cannot detennine the direction of population movement. In contrast, strontium isotope analysis provides complementary information by identify­ing first-generation migrants from the Lake Titicaca basin. 
Strontium Isotope Analysis: An Introduction 

Strontium isotope analysis can elucidate the nature ofTiwanaku influence in the South Central Andes by identifying individuals who lived in or near the site ofTiwanaku during childhood and then moved to and/or were buried in Tiwanaku-affiliated sites outside of the Lake Titicaca basin. While archae­ologists and bioarchaeologists have traditionally used proxy measures for migration such as artifact or biodistance analyses, strontium isotope analy­sis is increasingly used to identify migration within the human skeleton (e.g., Knudson et al. 2005; Montgomery et al. 2005; Price et al. 2006; Wright 2005a). 
Although strontium concentrations in bone and tooth enamel vary according to trophic level, the strontium isotope ratios in an individual's teeth and bones will reflect the strontium isotope ratios of the geologic region or regions that provided that indi­vidual's diet. The strontium isotope ratios in a given geologic region are dependent on the age and com­position of the bedrock as 87Sr is formed from radioactive decay of rubidium (87Rb, t112 = 4.88 X 1010 years) (Faure 1986a). Because the relative mass differences between the four isotopes of stron­tium (86Sr, 87Sr, 88Sr, and 90Sr) are small, the iso­topic composition of strontium is not appreciably fractionated during transport through the ecosys­tem (Aberg 1995; Blum et al. 2000; Faure 1986b ). 
During the development of teeth and bones, strontium substitutes for calcium in hydroxyapatite (Carr et al. 1962; Hodges et al. 1950; Kulp and Schulert 1962). Because strontium is continuously incorporated into bone as it remodels, bone stron­tium isotope ratios reflect where that individual lived during bone fonnation. Cortical bone turnover rates vary widely and are dependent on the skele­tal element involved as well as the age, sex, health, and activity levels on an individual (e.g., Branca and Robins 1992; Mulhern 2000; Mulhern and Van Gerven 1997). For femora and ribs, the skeletal elements most commonly used in this study, cor­tical bone turnover rates are approximately 2 per­cent per year and 3.5-4 percent per year, respec­tively (Carr et al. 1962; Kulp and Schulert 1962; Parfitt 1983 ). On the other hand, tooth enamel does not incorporate strontium after formation. For example, strontium isotope ratios in first molar tooth enamel reflect the geologic region or regions that supplied an individual's strontium for the first 3-4 years of life (Hillson 1986, 1996). Therefore, differences in strontium isotope ratios in human tooth enamel and bone can be used to identify migration and the geologic origins of immigrants (Ericson 1985, 1989; Price et al. 1994; Sealy et al. 1991; Sillen et al. 1989). 

Strontium isotope ratios in human tooth enamel and bone reflect place of residence during enamel and bone formation only if the geologic region in which an individual's high-strontium food was grown or raised was also the region in which they lived. Therefore, understanding the food sources of the individuals analyzed is imperative. Nonlocal food sources can have a variable effect on an indi­vidual's isotopic signature (Bentley 2006). For example, relatively small quantities of high­strontium products imported from a region with a dramatically different strontium isotope ratio may change the strontium isotope signature in an indi­vidual's tooth enamel and bone substantially. Alter­natively, large quantities of high-strontium foods from a region with a very similar strontium isotope signature will not substantially change her or his strontium isotope signature. 
Finally, it is necessary to ensure that the bone or tooth enamel was not changed by post­depositional contamination. While bone is suscep­tible to diagenetic contamination from the burial environment, tooth enamel is remarkably resistant to contamination (e.g., Budd et al. 2000; Chiara­dia et al. 2003; Ericson 1993; Hedges 2002; Lee­Thorp 2002; Montgomery et al. 1999; Shellis and Dibdin 2000; Sillen 1989). Mechanical and chem­ical cleaning of archaeological tooth enamel and bone can eliminate some of the diagenetic conta­mination that occurs (Hoppe et al. 2003; Lambert et al. 1991; Nielsen-Marsh and Hedges 2000; Price et al. 1992; Price et al. 1994; Sillen and LeGros 1991; Sillen and Sealy 1995). In addition, several different techniques, including monitoring uranium concentrations and the ratio of calcium to phos­phorus (Ca/P), can identify contaminated samples (Edward and Benfer 1993; Knudson 2004; Kohn

Strontium Isotope Analysis: Field 
Methodology and Sampling Strategy 

For each individual included in this study, at least one tooth enamel sample, preferably a first molar, was collected. When available, a rib or femoral fragment was also collected. At each site, 10--15 percent of the individuals who were included in pre­vious biodistance and cranial modification studies were included in this study (Blom 1999; Cocilovo and Zavattieri 1994; Costa Junqueira and Llagostera 1994; Neves et al. 1999; Varela 1997; Varela and Cocilovo 2000). Individuals were cho­sen for inclusion in this study through a random sampling strategy designed to reflect the cemeter­ies' age and sex compositions. Although this strat­egy was designed to accurately reflect the mortuary population at each site, it is expected that first­generation migrants will be underrepresented in this study. This study can identify only individuals who migrated from a geologic zone with a differ­ent strontium isotope signature than the zone in which they were buried during enamel formation. In addition, individuals whose ancestors migrated from the Lake Titicaca basin may have self­identified as Tiwanaku-affiliated but will not be identified as first-generation migrants according to their strontium isotope signatures. 
Modem and archaeological small mammal sam­ples, mostly guinea pigs, from the study regions were also analyzed to provide the biological.ly avail­able strontium isotope signatures from each region (Table 1). The animals' owners provided informa­tion about the animals' life histories and food sources. When possible, animals raised on foods grown in the same or similar agricultural field sys­tems that were used in the Middle horizon were col­lected. When modern guinea pigs were not available, archaeological small mammals were ana­lyzed. 
Strontium Isotope Analysis: 
Laboratory Methods 

Tooth and bone samples were mechanically and chemically cleaned and prepared for analysis in the Laboratory for Archaeological Chemistry at the University of Wisconsin at Madison by K.J. Knud­son, as described elsewhere (Knudson and Price 2007; Knudson et al. 2004; Knudson et al. 2005). 
K.J. Knudson and P.D. Fullagar obtained the stron­tium isotope ratios using a VG Sector 54 thermal ionization mass spectrometer (TIMS) at the Isotope Geochemistry Laboratory in the Department of Geological Sciences at the University of North Car­olina at Chapel Hill. 1 Diagenetic contamination was monitored through uranium concentrations and Ca/P ratios obtained by K.J. Knudson and J.H. Bur­ton using a Finnegan Element inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometer (ICP-MS) and an Applied Research Labs Model 3520 inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometer (ICP-AES) in the Laboratory for Archaeological Chemistry at the University of Wisconsin at Madi­son.2The tooth enamel data presented here did not

exhibit evidence of diagenetic contamination, although some bone samples did, as will be dis­cussed below. 
Baseline Strontium Isotope Data from the South Central Andes 
Geologic Data from the South Central Andes 
The South Central Andes exhibit broad patterns of geologic variability that make strontium isotope analysis feasible. The Tiwanaku heartland is located in the southeastern Lake Titicaca basin and is bor­dered by the Cordillera Blanca and the Cordillera Real, which are composed of Paleozoic andesites, sandstones, and red mudstones (Argollo et al. 1996; Binford and Kolata 1996; Lavenu 1991; Rodrigo andWirrmann 1991). The bedrock in theTiwanaku River basin, where the sites ofTiwanaku and Tilata are located, is composed of igneous basalts and andesites and is overlain by up to 10-20 m of Qua­ternary flu vial and lacustrine sediments (Argollo et al. 1996; Binford and Kolata 1996; Lavenu 1991; Rodrigo and Wirrmann 1991 ). Surface water from Lake Titicaca exhibited 87Sr/86Sr = .7082-.7085 (Grove et al. 2003). Similarly, 20 samples from four sediment cores taken from Lake Titicaca were characterized by 87Srl86Sr . 7083-. 7087 (Grove et 
= 
al. 2003). 
In contrast, the Cenozoic volcanic rocks, pre­dominately andesites, where Chen Chen and San Pedro de Atacama are located, exhibit strontium isotope signatures that are lower than those found in the alluvial deposits of the Lake Titicaca basin (Figure 2) (Argollo et al. 1996; Grove et al. 2003; Hawkesworthetal. 1982; James 1982; Rogers and Hawkesworth 1989). Samples of exposed bedrock samples from the San Pedro de Atacama region are s1srf86Sr = . 7062-. 7068 (Rogers and Hawkes worth 1989). Farther north in the Moquegua Valley of southern Peru, exposed bedrock range exhibits 87Srf86Sr = . 7055-. 7068 (Hawkesworth et al. 1982; James 1982; Rogers and Hawkesworth 1989). 
Finally, the strontium isotope signature in sea­water is 87Sr/86Sr = .7092 (Veizer 1989). There­fore, populations consuming large quantities of marine products will have strontium isotope ratios that reflect this value instead of or in com­bination with a terrestrial strontium isotope sig­nature. 
Fauna[ Data from the South Central Andes 
The strontium isotope values found in geologic analyses of exposed bedrock and groundwater resemble the strontium isotope ratios in modem fauna from the regions included in this study (Price et al. 2002). Analysis of modem and archaeologi­cal small mammal bones from the southeastern Lake Titicaca basin, the Moquegua Valley and the San Pedro de Atacama oasis support the strontium isotope ratios from the geologic literature (Figure 2, Table 1) (Knudson 2004; Knudson et al. 2004). By taking the mean of the guinea pig bone stron­tium isotope data and adding and subtracting two standard deviations (Price et al. 2002), the local ranges of the strontium isotope isotopes signatures for the regions included in this study are as follows: s1srf86Sr = .7087-.7105 for the southeastern Lake Titicaca basin, 87Sr/86Sr = .7074-.7079 for the San Pedro de Atacama region, and 87Sr/86Sr = .7059­. 7066 for the Moquegua Valley. The strontium iso­tope signatures for the southeastern Lake Titicaca basin, the San Pedro de Atacama region, and the Moquegua Valley are distinct and non-overlapping, and are similar to the published geologic values. 
The comparison of archaeological and modem faunal strontium isotope data with data from the geologic literature is the most common way to iden­tify immigrants in the strontium isotope archaeo­logical literature. However, one of the key questions in strontium isotope analysis involves the determi­nation of local signatures (Bentley 2006; Price et al. 2002; Wright 2005b ). Although mean archaeo­logical human bone values have been used, the prevalence of diagenetic contamination could cause an artificially narrow "local" signature (Bentley et al. 2004). When available, archaeological tooth enamel from small mammals will provide an aver­age of the biologically available strontium isotope ratios in their diet catchment area (Bentley et al. 2004). In the Andes, the lack of a large number of mammals with large teeth and relatively small ranges, like the sheep and pigs used in studies of German Neolithic sites, make this more difficult. In general, the determination of local signatures for a given population is complex and requires several independent lines of evidence. Although the mean of the modem and archaeological faunal values are predominately used in this study, alternative defi­nitions of local will be discussed for each popula­tion in the sections that follow.

marine subsistence base (Sandness 1992; Tomczak 2001, 2003). In addition, the botanical remains excavated from Chen Chen are predominately maize with smaller amounts of high-altitude crops such as tubers, while faunal remains are predomi­nately terrestrial with little evidence of marine food sources (Goldstein 1995). Therefore, it is unlikely that high strontium isotope ratios at Chen Chen would be the result of high amounts of marine food consumption. In addition, because the mid-valley region contains prime agricultural land for rnid­altitude crops such as maize, it is highly unlikely that maize was imported. Maize kernels are rela­tively low in calcium, and hence strontium, so it is most likely that the majority of strontium in the diet of individuals at Chen Chen came from locally grown plants other than maize. It is unlikely, there­fore, that significant amounts of strontium came from foods traded in from regions outside the Moquegua Valley. 
In San Pedro de Atacama, the long distance from San Pedro to otherTiwanaku-affiliated sites and the ideal agricultural conditions in the oasis make it highly unlikely that significant amounts of food were being traded into the oasis. Paleodiet recon­structions can test this hypothesis. Botanical macroremains found in San Pedro de Atacama tombs show the presence of maize and algarroba, which were most likely locally grown, as well as camelid bones and freshwater shells from the east­ern slopes of the Andes or the Pacific (Costa Jun­queira and Llagostera 1994; Oakland Rodman 1992). Although the animal products could intro­duce nonlocal strontium isotope signatures, it is most likely that the majority of the strontium came from local food sources. 
Finally, in the Lake Titicaca basin there is evi­dence for the consumption of both lower altitude crops, including maize and far-ranging camelids as well as local plant foods such.as tubers and quinoa (Berryman et al. 2006; Webster 1993; Webster and Janusek 2003; Wright et al. 2003). Because the camelids consumed at Basin sites were typically young (Webster 1993; Webster and Janusek 2003), they are unlikely to have been specialized caravan llamas from the eastern or western slopes of the Andes. As previously discussed, although maize is present, its kernels have little strontium. Therefore, the most likely sources for strontium in the Lake Titicaca basin are locally grown foods. 
Archaeological Strontium Isotope 
Data from the South Central Andes 

Strontium isotope analysis was performed on archaeological human tooth enamel from individ­uals buried at the Moquegua Valley site of Chen Chen and from the San Pedro de Atacama ceme­teries of Coyo Oriental, Coyo-3, and Solcor-3 to test the hypothesis that these sites were inhabited in part by individuals who immigrated from the Lake Titicaca basin. As previously discussed, 10-15 percent of the individuals included in pre­vious biodistance and cranial modification studies were included in this study (Blom 1999; Cocilovo and Zavattieri 1994; Costa Junqueira and Llagostera 1994; Neves et al. 1999; Varela 1997; Varela and Cocilovo 2000). 
Strontium Results of Archaeological Human Remains from Chen Chen 
As defined through modem fauna, the local range is 87Sr/86Sr = .7059-.7066 for the Moquegua Val­ley. Strontium isotope ratios in archaeological human tooth enamel from the Tiwanaku-affiliated site of Chen Chen show four individuals, all females, of the 25 individuals analyzed with stron­tium isotope ratios that are clearly outside of this local range (Ml-3840 [87Sr/86Sr = .708843], Ml­S/NB092 [87Sr!86Sr = .709995], Ml-0036 [87Sr/86Sr = .714404], and Ml-2947, [87Sr!86Sr = .719211]) (Figure 3, Table 2). 
A subset of 10 archaeological bone samples were analyzed in order to test the hypothesis that the individuals buried at Chen Chen lived there during the last years of their lives (Figure 4 ). Only one of the 10 individuals sampled had a bone stron­tium isotope signature that was clearly outside of the local range as defined by modern fauna (87Sr/86Sr = .7059-.7066). This male had a bone strontium isotope signature higher than the local Moquegua Valley signature (Ml -1600 (87Sr/86Sr= . 708850). Given the excellent preservation at Chen Chen, it is not surprising that these bone samples did not exhibit the high uranium concentrations or anomalous Ca/P ratios indicative of diagenetic con­tamination.

Pedro de Atacama cemeteries of Coyo Oriental, Coyo-3 and Solcor-3 were more homogenous than those found at Chen Chen. Four of the 27 analyzed individuals exhibit enamel strontium isotope sig­natures clearly outside of the local range in San Pedro de Atacama, which is 87 Sr!86Sr . 707 4-.7079

Because of the homogeneity of the enamel strontium isotope ratios at the San Pedro de Atacama cemeteries and the lack of postcranial skeletal elements at some cemeteries, bone sam­ples have not yet been analyzed. 
Strontium Results of Archaeological Human Remains from the Lake Titicaca basin 
At Tiwanaku, three of the 10 individuals exhibited enamel strontium isotope signatures outside the local southeastern Lake Titicaca basin range, which is 87Sr!86Sr .7087-.7105 as defined by modem

fauna. One 17-30-year-old individual was buried on the Akapana pyramid in the center of the site (AK-4931 [87Sr!86Sr =.716256]), while one female and one male were buried in the Putuni sector, located adjacent to the Akapana (PUT-25785-1 [87Sr!86Sr = .711758] and PUT-24106 [87Sr!86Sr = . 711303 ]). Finally, one individual buried in the Aka­pana East residential sector (AKE-8908 [87Sr!86Sr 
= 
.710907]) also had an enamel strontium isotope ratio above the local range as determined by mod­em fauna (87Sr/86Sr = .7087-.7105). 
For three of the individuals with nonlocal enamel strontium isotope values at the site of Tiwanaku, the bone strontium isotope values were within the local southeastern Lake Titicaca basin signature (AK-4931 [87Sr/86Sr .709595], PUT­

25785-l [87Sr/86Sr = .709731], and PUT-24106 [87Sr!86Sr = .711303]) (Figure 4). Two of the three samples exhibited Ca/P ratios and uranium con­centrations that may indicate diagenetic contami­nation; bone generally has Ca/P = 2.1 and uranium concentrations below the detection limit of the ICP­MS (AK-4931 [Ca/P 2.32, U 5.1 ppm], and

PUT-24106 [Ca/P = 2.28, U 8.38 ppm]). There­

fore, it is possible that the biogenic strontium iso­tope signature in these bone samples was higher or lower than the diagenetic strontium isotope signa­ture that was measured.
