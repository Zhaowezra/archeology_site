THE COLOR OF INFLUENCE: A PROVENANCE STUDY OF 
HEMATITE-BASED PAINTS ON EARLY OLMEC CARVED POTTERY

Recent research and debates regarding the origin and spread of Olmec iconography during the Early Formative have cen­tered on provenance and stylistic analyses of carved and incised pottery. Studies by instrumental neutron activation analy­sis (INAA) have indicated that Gulf Coast-style carved-incised pots were exported extensively from the area of the first Olmec capital, San Lorenzo, to several other regions of Mesoamerica. More recently, excavations at the Pacific Coast site of Canton Corralito have shown that carved-incised pottery and other Olmec-style artifacts dominate strata contemporary with Early Olmec, suggesting the site may represent a settlement enclave of Gulf Olmec peoples. In this study we provide additional evidence of exchange between the Gulf Olmec and the Pacific Coast region by using laser ablation time-of-flight inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-TOF-ICP-MS) to characterize hematite-based paints on Olmec-style pottery from Canton Corralito, and to compare these paints to raw hematite recovered from Canton Corralito and San Lorenzo. When examined in combination with sherd provenance data, the LA-TOF-!CP-MS data demonstrate that Olmec vessels were decorated in the San Lorenza region before being exported to the Pacific Coast, and that Gulf Coast hematite was exported to Canton Corralito, where it was used to enhance Olmec-style symbolism on locally produced vessels. 
Recientes investigaciones y debates sabre el origen y la extension de la iconografia olmeca durante el Formativo Temprano se han centrado en los andlisis estiUsticos y de procedencia de la cerdmica tallada y cincelada. Estudios utilizando andlisis de activacion de neutrones ( INAA) han indicado que vasijas talladas-cinceladas en el estilo de la Costa del Golfo fueron expor­tadas extensivamente desde el area de la primera capital olmeca de San Lorenzo a otras regiones de Mesoamerica. Reciente­mente, excavaciones en el sitio de Canton Corralito, ubicado en la costa de/ Pacifico, han mostrado que la cerdmica tallada-cincelada y otros artefactos de estilo olmeca dominan Los estratos contempordneos con o olmeca temprano, lo que sugiere que el sitio puede representar un posible asentamiento de una poblacion olmeca del Golfo. En este estudio, presenta­mos evidencia adicional acerca del intercambio entre los olmecas de! Golfo y la region de la costa del Pacifico, usando e.1pec­troscopia de masas acoplada inductivamente con ablacion laser de tiempo de vuelo (Laser Ablation Time-Of-F light Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry -LA-TOF-ICP-MS), para caracterizar colorantes a base de hematita en la cerdmica de estilo olmeca de Canton Corralito, y para comparar estos colorantes con hematita sin procesar recuperada de Canton Co­rralito y San Lorenzo. Cuando los datos de LA-TOF·ICP-MS son examinados }unto con informacidn de procedencia de Los fragmentos, demuestran que las vasijas olmecas fueron decoradas en la regidn de San Lorenzo antes de ser exportadas a la costa del Pacifico, y que la hematita de la costa de! Golfo Jue exportada a Canton Corralito, donde se usd para acentuar el simbolismo de estilo olmeca en los recipientes localmente producidos.

tion and statistical methods, and the debate that ensued in this journal and elsewhere focused as much on the degree to which the Olmec influenced cultural development throughout the Mesoameri­can region as it did on the methods and theory of ceramic provenance investigation (Flannery et al. 2005; Neff, Blomster, Glascock, Bishop, Black­man, Coe, Cowgill, Cyphers, Diehl, Houston, Joyce, Lipo, and Winter 2006; Neff, Blomster, Glascock, Bishop, Blackman, Coe, Cowgill, Diehl, Houston, Joyce, Lipo, Stark, and Winter 2006; Sharer et al. 2006). 
Blomster et al.'s (2005) claims are controversial because they have direct implications for ongoing debates regarding the importance of the Olmec in the development of complex society in Mesoamer­ica. The symbolism present on these pots arguably represents the first widespread artistic style and ideology known for Mesoamerica, eventually appearing on ceramics, portable art objects, and monumental art throughout the region (Dicastro and Cyphers 2006:33). Blomsteret al. (2005: 1068) contend that "because this iconography has been linked with the dissemination of the social, politi­cal, and religious institutions of the Olmec, ana­lyzing its origin and spread is central to understanding the development of complex soci­ety in Mesoamerica." But while questioning the INAA study, Flannery et al. (2005) maintained that no such link has ever been demonstrated, and argued that the motifs seen in Olmec carved and incised pottery were so widespread during the early Formative that it is impossible to trace their origin to a single ethnic group or to associate them with a specific set of institutions. 
Another, more recent study has uncovered addi­tional evidence related to the export of Olmec-style pottery and its associated iconography from the San Lorenzo area. During his excavations of Can­ton Corralito, an Early Formative (c. 1600-1000 B.C.1) site near the Pacific coast in the Soconusco region of Chiapas, Cheetham found that strata con­temporary with Early Olmec were dominated by Gulf Coast-style carved and incised pottery, clay figurines, and other Olmec-style artifacts, and that these ceramics are stylistically and technically equivalent to ceramics recovered from contempo­raneous San Lorenzo (Cheetham 2006a, 2009, 201 Oa, 20 I Ob; see also Di Castro and Cyphers [2009) for a discussion of common ceramic motifs from San Lorenzo contexts). Furthermore, INAA analysis of the clay pastes comprising these ceram­ics showed that many of these vessels had their ori­gins in the San Lorenzo area. These findings have led Cheetham (2010b) to conclude that Canton Corralito functioned as an Olmec colony, perhaps facilitating trade between the Olmec heartland and the Pacific Coast. 

In this paper we describe our efforts to chemi­cally characterize hematite, the mineral form of iron oxide (Fe203), in order to provide additional evi­dence of exchange between the Gulf Olmec and the Pacific Coast region and to examine the role that hematite played in the spread of Olmec-style iconography during the Early Formative. Indeed, a link clearly exists between hematite and early Olmec symbolism, although that link is currently poorly understood. During their excavations at San Lorenzo, Coe and Diehl ( 1980: 166) noted that sherds showing Olmec-style carved and incised motifs often had hematite rubbed into their excised areas after firing, and many of the San Lorenzo-style incised and carved ceramics recovered from Can­ton Corralito retain traces of their hematite-based paint (Cheetham 201 Oa). Fragments of raw hematite have also been recovered from archaeological con­texts in both Canton Corralito and San Lorenzo. This study uses laser ablation time-of-flight inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (TOF-LA-ICP­MS) analysis in combination with recently acquired INAA data to determine whether hematite was (1) applied to Gulf Coast vessels before export to Can­ton Corralito, (2) imported to Canton Corralito in raw form and applied to locally produced vessels, or (3) quarried in the Canton Corralito region and applied to either imported or locally produced 
vessels-in short, how hematite was used on Olmec-style ceramics, and how the origins of hematite vary among local and imported pottery found in this Pacific Coast site. 
The appearance of chemically identical raw pig­ments in both San Lorenzo and Canton Corralito could be taken as evidence of Gulf Olmec trade, although it would require a correlation between a geologic hematite sample and a pigment recovered from an archaeological context to determine the place of origin or direction of transport. Several hematite outcrops that may have been exploited prehistorically occur in the Gulf Coast region (Coe and Diehl 1980: 16; Ortiz and Rodriguez 2000), but

so far no sources showing evidence of prehistoric use have been documented in southeastern coastal Chiapas. This suggests that pigments found in Can­ton Corralito, whether raw or used as the main ingredient in paints that decorate Olmec-style pot­tery, may have originated in the San Lorenzo area. This notion will be supported if the hematites on Olmec-style Canton Corralito pottery are found to match raw pigments from the San Lorenzo region. However, if some or all of the paint on the Olmec­style pottery shows compositional similarity with raw pigment found at Canton Corralito, and this pigment is distinct from raw pigments from San Lorenzo, then the nature of the pottery trade may be more complex than previously thought: Olmec­style vessels, including those manufactured at Can­ton Corralito and those exported to Canton Corralito from the Gulf Coast, may have been dec­orated with hematite derived from sources outside the San Lorenzo area. 
Hematite 
Hematite is rarely found in a pure form archaeo­logically. The pigment generally found in archae­ological contexts and used prehistorically as a coloring agent is red ocher, which consists of hematite mixed with other minerals. Because nat­urally occurring iron oxide pigments are found in a wide variety of geologic settings, typical Fez03 content of ocher can range from approximately 20 percent to 85 percent, depending on the source (Fuller l 988:Table I). The remaining portion of ocher is made up of silicates and clays that act as diluents to the hematite, as well as minor and trace elements which may give the hematite a charac­teristic chemical pattern. Despite the tendency for this widely variable range of accompanying min­erals to introduce "noise" that may obscure its com­positional profile, hematite is well suited for provenance analysis. Recent studies (e.g., Erland­son et al. 1999; Popelka-Filcoff et al. 2007) demon­strate that the composition of raw hematite shows the kind of variation described by Weigand et al.'s (1977:24) "Provenience Postulate," which states the identification of a mineral source location is possible if "there exist differences in chemical com­position between different natural sources that exceed, in some recognizable way, the differences observed within a given source." Although it is a common component of soils and sediments, hematite often occurs on the landscape in discrete outcrops, or sources. As with obsidian and other raw materials, hematite from specific sources may have been regularly utilized and traded. In addition, paints containing hematite as their main ingredient are known to have been prepared and applied according to specific recipes (Clottes 1993; Fiore et al. 2008; Goodall et al. 2009; Gorden 1996). Given these assumptions, chemical characteriza­tion of hematite-based paints has the potential to provide important indications of trade, cultural transmission of technology, and other types of inter­regional interaction. 
The Gulf Olmec made extensive use of hematite-based paint to decorate their ceramics, architecture, and portable art objects (DiCastro and Cyphers 2099:33; Pool 2007: 103), and it is likely that the majority of carved and incised ves­sels produced during the San Lorenzo phase had hematite rubbed into their carved areas after fir­ing (Cheetham 2006b; Coe and Diehl 1980:166; DiCastro and Cyphers 2009:33). Because hematite is common in the Cenozoic sediments and salt domes of the Gulf Coast region (Martinez-Hernan­dez et al. 2005), we believe it is reasonable to assume that most, if not all, of the hematite used by the Gulf Olmec was locally mined. Coe and Diehl (1980: 16) describe several prehistorically exploited hematite sources in the San Lorenzo area, including red beds and outcrops near Alma­gres northwest of San Lorenzo, at El Palotal to the southwest of Almagres, at San Antonio, located between Almagres and the Rio Tatagapa, and on the Cerro Colorado and the Cerro de la Encantada, both southwest of San Lorenzo. The iron content of hematite, limonite, and specularite from these sources averages about 30 percent, and in some cases is as high as 50 percent (Coe and Diehl 1980: 16). 
Hematite was also readily available from out­crops atop the El Manatf hill, located in the Coatza­coalcos River Basin approximately 10 km east of San Lorenzo. The site of El Manatf consists of a small hill rising from the swampy terrain, with a natural spring at its base where recent excavations provide evidence of extensive Early Olmec era rit­ual: artifacts recovered from the mud deposits at El Manatf include ceramics, jade axes, beads, rubber balls, anthropomorphic wood busts, and burials

(Ortiz and Rodriguez 2000). Ortiz and Rodriguez (1999:250) describe El Manatf as a source of red pigment for the surrounding communities. They believe that the El Manatf hematite symbolized blood and was an important resource for local and regional exchange. 
In contrast, there are no known prehistorically exploited sources of hematite in the coastal plain of the Soconusco region, although hematite is known to occur in Chiapas. Red beds corre­sponding to the Todos Santos Formation are exposed in a long, narrow band bordering the northeastern edge of the Chiapas massif (Mene­ses-Rocha 2001: 192), but these deposits are located in the highlands approximately 250 km north of Canton Corralito. Additionally, a 1923 report published by the Geological Institute of Mexico (Salinas 1923:215) briefly refers to a his­torical hematite mine located in the Acacoyahua municipality of Chiapas, approximately 60 km northwest of Canton Corralito. However, the report does not provide any information about the mine other than its name, Mina El Porvenir, so it is unclear whether hematite outcropped in that area or was reached through excavation. 
Beaudry ( 1989) reviewed site reports and ceramic collections to investigate the use of spec­ular hematite pigment along the Pacific Coast of Chiapas and Guatemala from the Early Formative through the Late Postclassic. Specular hematite is rarely seen on Pacific Coast vessels until the Mid­dle and Late Classic periods, when it appears on several different types of ceramics (e.g., Patulul and Tiquisate) that were widely distributed through­out the region (Beaudry 1989:206). Although Beaudry describes occurrences of specular hematite paint on Early Formative Barra and Ocos phase pottery from Pacific Coastal Chiapas, Clark and Cheetham (2005) argued that these vessels were actually decorated with a thin slip of levigated red clay; although the clay probably received its color through an iron oxide component, they deter­mined that the slip was made specular by the addi­tion of mica prior to firing. Whether or not specular hematite was used during the Barra, Locona, and Ocos phases, Beaudry is correct in her argument that the alluvial nature of the Pacific coastal plain made the natural occurrence of specular hematite unlikely, and therefore the appearance of this pig­ment on any ceramics found in the region is an indi­cation that either the pigment or the ceramics them­selves were imported. Although all of the paints analyzed in the present study are composed of the non-specular variety of hematite, we assume that it was as scarce as the specular variety along the Pacific Coast during the Early Formative, and also came to the region through exchange. 
In Situ Paint Characterization 
While several recent studies have succeeded in chemically characterizing raw or geological hematites (e.g., Erlandson et al. 1999; Iriarte et al. 2009; Popelka-Filcoff et al. 2007; Popelka-Filcoff et al. 2008), in situ provenance analysis of hematite on ceramics and other artifacts poses a unique set of challenges. Foremost of these is the need to dis­tinguish the compositional patterns associated with the hematite under study from those of surround­ing materials, whether they were introduced natu­rally or added during the paint manufacturing process. As mentioned above, iron oxide in geo­
logic settings is almost always diluted to some degree by clays or other surrounding minerals. Fur­thermore, prehistoric paints designed to provide permanent decoration of fired pottery, stone, bone, wood, and other materials were often composed of a number of components in addition to the pigment itself. These could include a binder, consisting of clay or an organic material such as vegetable oil, animal fat, blood, or egg yolk, which acted as a fix­ative to hold the color to the painted surface; and a vehicle, either water or another fluid element in the paint that allowed it to be handled and applied eas­ily (Chalmin et al. 2003; Clottes 1993; Gorden 1996). It is almost certain that these kinds of addi­tives are components of the paints analyzed in this study. During exploratory analyses involving the application of raw hematite to ceramic test tiles, we found that hematite alone adheres poorly to fired clay, and must be combined with a binder and vehi­cle if is to remain in place for any period of time. Therefore any study, including this one, that seeks to use patterning of major, minor, and trace element concentrations to discriminate hematite sources must consider the presence of surrounding miner­als not associated with the iron oxide as well as materials in1roduced during paint preparation. 
Chemical analysis of paint on potsherds, par­ticularly those excavated from acidic soils, is also

made difficult by the fact that paint may have weathered to the point where it remains only as a thin film on the smface of the sherd, or as minute amounts trapped in cracks or depressions in aves­sel's surface. This is often the case with sherds that have been painted after firing, such as the carved and incised sherds recovered from both San Lorenzo and Canton Corralito. Paints that have been applied after firing are generally more chal­lenging to analyze than paints applied prior to fir­ing. Heat bonds the paint firmly to the vessel's surface, and may cause hardening through sinter­ing if the hematite is mixed with clay, but post-fire paints are held to the ceramic only by the binder and therefore tend to be relatively friable and prone to deterioration. This is especially evident in San Lorenzo phase ceramics, which are often so eroded that even the slightest trace of paint is absent. For­tunately the pottery at Canton Corralito has fared somewhat better in the less-acidic soil of the Pacific Coast, and several specimens were recovered that retained enough paint for analysis. Nevertheless, the surficial and often fugitive nature of post-fire paints precludes the use of bulk characterization techniques such as INAA (instrumental neutron activation analysis), and necessitates the use of a microprobe technique, such as energy-dispersive and wavelength-dispersive spectrometers on a scan­ning electron microscope, or mass spectrometry coupled with laser sampling, for analysis of paint independent of the underlying ceramic. 
Archaeological Background 
The Mazatan region is a mosaic of forests, swamps, and coastal vegetation located along the Pacific coast of Chiapas, approximately 300 miles south of the Olmec heartland (Figure 1 ). Throughout the Initial Early Formative period the Mazatan zone was inhabited by the "Mokaya," a group, like the Olmecs, that is thought to have spoken an ances­tral Mixe-Zoquean language (Campbell and Kauf­man 1976; Clark and Blake 1989; Pool 2007:183). The Mokaya created some of Mesoamerica's ear­liest ceramics, which appear during the Barra phase (1600-1425 B.C.) and are notable for their high quality of manufacture and elaborate decoration (Blake et al. 1995: 167). During the subsequent Locona phase (1425-1350 B.C.) the earliest rank society known in Mesoamerica appeared in the Mazatan area, along with formal ceremonial archi­tecture (Pool 2007: 186). During this period local populations appear to have become organized into an interlocked network of simple chiefdoms, each based in a central village holding at least one elite residence on an elevated platform. The largest of these villages appears to have been Paso de la Amada, which contained an 80-meter long ball­court, the earliest known in Mesoamerica (Clark and Pye 2000:231; Hill et al. 1998). The Ocos phase (1350-1250 B.C.) saw the refinement of a two­tiered settlement hierarchy as populations contin­ued to aggregate into large villages (Blake et al. 1995:173; Clark and Pye 2000:232). 
The Cheda phase (1250 -1150 B.C.) marks the beginning of Gulf Olmec influence in the Mazatan region. Probably not coincidentally, changes in arti­fact distribution and architecture at Paso de la Amada provide evidence of increasing economic inequality triggered by "a new ideological synthe­sis [that] effectively legitimized economic control by an emergent elite class" (Lesure and Blake 2002:20). Clear evidence of significant trade con­tacts between the Gulf Coast and Mazatan regions can be seen: imports from the Gulf Coast include fine-paste ceramic vessels and clay figurines (Cheetham 2010b), while exotic goods from Guatemala, including obsidian from the highlands and jade from the Motagua Valley, apparently passed through Mazatan on the way back to the Gulf. Clark and Pye (2000:234) hypothesize that Mazatan began to export cacao during this period, and cacao residues have been detected on slightly earlier vessels from both El Manatf and Paso de la Amada (Powis et al. 2008). The Mokaya made copies of black-and-white Olmec style pottery locally, but with the imports generally distinguish­able by their relatively thin wall thickness and finer, ash-tempered paste. Chemical analysis indicates that significant quantities of these pots were imported from San Lorenzo during the Cheda phase (see Cheetham 2010b). 
The Cuadros phase corresponds with the peak of Early Olmec influence on the Pacific Coast, and is visible in the archaeological record as "a nearly full conversion of local artifacts to Olmec norms" (Clark and Pye 2000:234 ). The Cuadros phase saw the abandonment of Paso de la Amada and other key villages, and Clark (2007:21) has suggested that during this period independent chiefdoms in

the region integrated under a new center, Canton Corralito. Located along the Coatan River in the Mazaran zone, Canton Corralito was initially occu­pied during the Late Archaic period (ca. 2300-1600 B.C.). At its peak during the Cuadros phase, Can­ton Corralito was at least 25 ha in size and had a population of perhaps 750-1,000 persons. Cheetham has found that a marked increase in Early Olmec-sty le artifacts occurred during this period. His excavations in 2004 yielded over 5,000 Olmec­style items, including vessels, figurines, roller stamps, ceramic spatulas/spoons, and objects of

personal adornment such as earspools (Cheetham 201 Oa). The ceramic assemblage includes common utilitarian pottery as well as decorated types con­sidered diagnostic of the San Lorenzo phase (1150-900 B.C.) at San Lorenzo; in all, over 1,000 Calzadas Carved sherds and over 3,700 Limon Incised sherds were found. Over 1,250 figurine fragments were also recovered, the majority of which are nearly identical to Olmec examples from the Gulf Coast (Cheetham 2009). The strong sim­ilarities between Olmec-style pottery from Canton Corralito and San Lorenzo, along with the clear transition from indigenous Mokaya assemblages to Olmec assemblages, have led Cheetham to suggest that Canton Corralito was colonized by the Gulf Olmec during the Cuadros phase (Cheetham 2006a, 2010a, 2010b).

Ceramic Types 
Calzadas Carved (Figure 2) and Limon Incised (Figure 3) are the ceramic marker types defined by Coe and Diehl ( 1980) for the San Lorenzo phase, which corresponds to the period of greatest cultural elaboration at San Lorenzo. These types are also prevalent in Cuadros phase contexts at Canton Cor­ralito, where Cheetham (Cheetham 2010a) has found them to be indistinguishable from their San Lorenzo counterparts in terms of form, technical style of manufacture (i.e., metric parameters such as wall thickness, rim diameter, vessel height, and so on), and decoration. Both types are composed largely of bolstered or direct rim serving vessels that were slipped in black, white, or black-and­white, although some are unslipped. All have exte­rior designs that were carved before firing, when

the clay was in the leather-hard stage of drying. These carved and incised design elements, which include a number of distinctive abstract motifs that may represent supernatural creatures or parts of creatures, are hallmarks of Early Olmec iconogra­phy -Coe and Diehl ( 1980: 159) describe Calzadas Carved as "JOO percent Olmec, in the sense that it has been decorated with motifs and in a style long identified as Olmec." Although the surfaces of carved and incised vessels recovered from San Lorenzo were particularly eroded (Coe and Diehl 1980: 162), it is apparent that the majority of ves­sels of this type from both coasts had hematite rubbed into their excised areas. 
Other Early Olmec ceramic types recovered from Canton Corralito and analyzed during the pre­sent study include Tatagapa Red and La Mina White. Tatagapa Red vessels have an exterior weakly slipped in red, and were incised through the slip or sometimes decorated with false rocker stamping before firing. La Mina White vessels were made of orange to tan paste and were thinly slipped in white, and were otherwise generally undeco­rated. La Mina White "paint dishes" often con­tained traces of hematite in their interiors, and may have been used to hold paint (Coe and Diehl 1980). 
Recent INAA analysis of clays from San Lorenzo-style carved and incised vessels, figurines, and other ceramics recovered from Canton Co­rralito has demonstrated that many of these artifacts originated in the Gulf Coast area, thus bolstering both Cheetham's (2006a, 2009, 2010a, 2010b; see also Pool 2007:192) hypothesis of Gulf Olmec colonialism and Blomster et al.'s (2005) assertions of one-way trade of ceramics out of San Lorenzo (Neff and Glascock 2007).

study, the ceramic pastes of 565 Cherla and Cuadros phase ceramic fragments, which include the sherds decorated with the paint that we describe here, were chemically characterized and compared to the over 1, 100 Early Formative sherds and raw clay sam­ples previously analyzed in conjunction with Blom­ster et al.'s (2005) study. While the pastes of 79 percent of the Canton Corralito specimens were 

unambiguously assigned to cC>mpositional groups that had been previously defined by INAA analy­ses of raw clays from the Mazatan and Gulf Coast regions, almost 10 percent showed membership in the Gulf Coast-derived San Lorenzo Gray and San Lorenzo White paste groups. Less than two percent of the Canton Corralito assemblage was assigned to an additional compositional group, Paste Group 1, which had not been recognized in the previous INAA analysis. The origin of Paste Group 1 remains a point of contention, even among the authors of this article. Neff and Glascock (2007) note that this group shows some compositional similarity to ceramics recovered from El Cerrito, a site located in the Acapetahua Estuary zone approx­imately 25 km from Canton Corralito, and suggest it may be composed of imports from neighboring areas to the northwest of Mazatan. However, a recent petrographic analysis of several San Lorenzo and Canton Corralito sherds that included a Group 1 specimen showed that while Group 1 is miner­alogically distinct, it shares specific minerals with the San Lorenzo paste groups, and Cheetham et al. (2009) believe it may originate from the Gulf Ccast. Finally, approximately 10 percent (n = 57) of the Canton Corralito specimens were labeled as "unas­signed" but are considered likely members of either Mazatan or San Lorenzo. Generally these samples showed strong compositional similarity to one of the two groups, yet fell slightly outside the proba­bility cutoff necessary for unambiguous group membership. In some cases, ceramics were unas­signed because they showed high probabilities of membership in both the San Lorenzo Gray and San Lorenzo White compositional groups. Despite their unassigned status, these specimens are clearly derived from the San Lorenzo area.

David Cheetham recovered the 82 painted sherds analyzed for this study from Canton Corralito dur­ing his 2004 field season (Table 1 ). These sherds, all from vessels, utensils, figurines, or other ceramic objects manufactured in a Gulf Olmec technolog­ical style or decorated with Olmec iconography, were chosen for TOF-LA-ICP-MS analysis because they contained visible traces of red paint on their exteriors. In some cases the paint formed a thick, intact coating on the surface of the artifact. However, on most of the sherds the paint had almost completely weathered away, and was visible only in pores and depressions of the sherd's surface when examined with a lOx hand lens. 
Most of the paints analyzed for this study were on Cuadros phase carved-incised bolstered or direct rim serving vessels, including 34 Calzadas Carved and 27 Limon Incised specimens. Other Cuadros phase paints include 11 on zone-decorated Tatagapa Red, one on fine-paste La Mina White, one on a ceramic spatula handle, and one on a figurine frag­ment. Cherla phase paint samples include one from a gray-black fine paste sherd, four from direct rim vessels, and two from earspool fragments. 
INAA analysis had previously been performed on the ceramic paste of all of the artifacts whose paint was analyzed in this study. Of the 82 painted sherds, 68 were unambiguously assigned to com­positional groups, including 60 to the Mazatan group, seven to the San Lorenzo Gray group, and one to Paste Group I.' Thirteen specimens were unassigned, but of these 11 were likely derived from Mazatan and two were likely derived from San Lorenzo. INAA data were unavailable for one specimen. 
Twenty-two raw pigment samples were also analyzed by TOF-LA-ICP-MS (Table 2). Eight specimens were found by Cheetham during exca­vations at Canton Corralito: three from Cherla phase contexts and five from Cuadros phase con­texts. Thirteen 13 pigment specimens are from San Lorenzo; these were excavated by Coe and Diehl in the 1960s and are currently curated at the Peabody Museum of Natural History, Yale Uni­versity. The San Lorenzo raw pigments include one Ojochi phase (1500-1350 B.C.), two Chicha­rras phase (1250-1150 B.C.), and 10 San Lorenzo phase (1150-900 B.C.). The raw pigments from both Canton Corralito and San Lorenzo had been found in a variety of forms: as powder or chunks in soil, as loose fragments, or adhering to the bot­tom of vessels. Two specimens, one from Canton

Corralito (DCPO 1) and one from San Lorenzo (DCPl 9), appeared to' have been prepared and pressed into small blocks. One sample of raw hematite is a geological specimen taken from an outcrop atop the El Manatf hill, courtesy of Pon­ciano Ortiz. As described above, El Manatf has a history of use as a ritual location and source of raw hematite that extends back to the Early For­mative period. 
Analytical Methods 
The 82 painted sherds and the 22 raw pigment sam­ples were analyzed on the GBC Optimass 8000 Time of Flight ICP-MS with NewWave UP-213 laser ablation system at the Institute for Integrated Research in Materials, Environments and Society (IIRMES) at California State University, Long Beach. The time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrome­ter used in this study is particularly well suited for analyzing the highly transient signals associated with microscopic pigment samples. While other ICP-MS configurations scan the mass range over

a period of time, and thus require a relatively lengthy ablation and data acquisition period, TOF instruments accelerate and separate entire groups of ions (an ion "packet") by the different times ions of different masses require to reach the detector. This allows accurate results to be obtained from a minimal amount of sample material; the GBC Opti­mass used in this study collects 30,000 readings of the entire mass spectrum per second with greater than 1-amu resolution. Detection limits are in the sub-ppm range for most analytes. 
Preparation of the painted ceramic and raw hematite samples, which were typically between . 3 cm and 1 cm in diameter, consisted only of mounting them to glass microscope slides with museum wax. To avoid removing the trace amounts of paint, the sherds were not cleaned before analysis. Instead, pre-ablation consisting of an initial, low-power pass of the laser across the sample removed surface contamination before data were collected. 
Paint on the majority of the ceramic samples was clearly visible only under the high-magnification video camera of the laser ablation system, so abla­tion required programming the laser to steer through pigmented areas and between areas of exposed ceramic matrix. Isolating trace amounts of paint from the underlying ceramic was also made easier by acquiring data in time-resolved mode, so that data were collected continually as the laser scanned over a series of samples and reference stan­dards, and the raw count data peaks corresponding to the times when the laser was ablating the areas of highest paint density were manually extracted from the resulting data set. Five replicate analyses, or five distinct ablation runs on separate but adja­cent areas of paint, were performed on each sam­ple, and the signal intensities resulting from the five replicates were averaged for each specimen. We found that this process of individually inspecting and extracting peaks from the data set provided a measure of quality control over the laser ablation process-in some cases one or more replicates in a five-replicate run resulted in clearly anomalous data, which could usually be seen as a low iron sig­nal accompanied by high silicon and aluminum signals. This was an indication that the laser had ablated through the pigment to the underlying ceramic, so these replicates were excluded from raw count averages. 
We analyzed the painted ceramic and raw hematite samples for a total of 44 major and minor elements. Five certified and/or characterized refer­ence materials (SRM 610, SRM 612, SRM 614, Glass Buttes obsidian and Ohio Red clay) were ablated during the same runs and under the same conditions as those applied to the painted sherds and pigment samples. We then calibrated the raw count data from pigments to those of the five standards using the approach suggested by Gratuze (1999; Gratuze et al. 2001 )This method involves stan­

dardizing blank-subtracted raw counts of each ele­ment to the counts of a single element, in this case aluminum, which functions as an internal standard . Following calibration we calculated individual ele­ment concentrations, which yielded parts-per-mil­lion (ppm) data for all 44 elements measured. 
Quantitative Methods 
Prior to the identification of compositional sub­groups it was necessary to address the possibility that minerals other than the hematite under study had inadve1tently been analyzed by the LA-ICP­MS. The initial step involved an exploratory analy­sis of the data to determine which elements appeared to be associated with iron-we assumed that these were related to the origin of the iron oxide under study, and therefore part of the hematite's chemical signature (Popelka-Filcoff et al. 2007). Likewise, we assumed that elements not associated with iron were related to diluents to the iron oxide, such as minerals that were naturally mixed with hematite in geologic contexts or clays used as pigment binders. A preliminary principal components analysis and a two-tailed Pearson's correlation test applied to the ppm data for all 44 measured elements showed that ten elements, including Na, Al, Si, K, Ca, Zn, Rb, Nb, Cs, and Ba, occurred in varying concentrations from sam­ple to sample but were all negatively correlated with iron within the 95 percent confidence inter­val. Because these 10 elements were assumed not to be components of the hematite's chemical sig­natures, they were not used during subsequent data analyses. Iron and the remaining 33 elements were considered potential contributors to the chemical signatures that are related to the geological origins of the various iron oxides, and therefore were used to determine possible source-related subgroups.
