pretation. On the one hand, a number of authors critique the reliability of sixteenth-century sources for under­standing the prehispanic past. Batalla Rosado argues that Sahagun's Primeros Memoriales "contains serious mis­takes" (54) and proposes scribal "misinterpretation" (48) in some of the Magilabechiano Group manuscripts. Umberger also argues that depictions of deity costumes in works by Sahagun "are very inaccurate" (92); prehis­panic historical change means that Central Mexican div­inatory almanacs are "questionable as sources for the analysis of the assemblages of these costume parts on sculptures" (89). Lind reveals parallel issues with entries in Cordova's 1578 Castilian-Zapotec dictionary. Some of the epithets for the deity Cozaana, for example-like "eternal king" and "sacred judge" -may reflect imported concepts of the new, Christian god (18). Similarly, it is sometimes unclear whether C6rdova's terms for priests are indigenous and prehispanic, or innovations used for new Christian ecclesiastics (76). 
If sources present a certain opacity, the interpretations made by scholars are often also limited in their clarity. One goal of Smith's analysis of Aztec platforms "was to propose an archaeological identification of the momoztli shrine. Unfortunately, the data did not cooperate, and I have not been able to further subdivide this category or to suggest any potential momoztlis at Aztec urban sites" (25). Lind, too, is often cautious about his historical reconstructions, such as those for Mitla and Yagul: "Although based on available data, this evolutionary sce­nario is hypothetical and requires additional data to ver­ify, or more likely modify it" (160, 209). Or, from Lind's concluding chapter: "It is likely, but uncertain, that the huia tao and the copa pitao performed the same types of rituals for the coqui and nobles that the colanf performed for the commoners" (345). 
Tezcatlipoca's obsidian mirror was a device in which (as Saunders and Baquedano point out) he "knows every­thing" (3). But scholarly visions of the Mesoamerican past are perhaps more like the mirror-vision that suppos­edly foretold the conquest of Tenochtitlan, as recorded in Book 8 of Sahagun 's Florentine Codex: "What is this? What has appeared to me here, what does it mean?"

Aztec Archaeology and Ethnohistory is, to my knowl­edge, the best synthesis of scholarship on the Aztecs available today. Frances Berdan has dedicated her entire career to research on the Aztecs, combining knowledge from ethnohistory, archaeology, art history, and ethnography. In this volume, she brings together insights from these varied fields to summarize the state of our knowledge of the Aztecs and to point to the many directions that future research on this civilization might take. And she does all of this with clear, lucid, and often humorous writing. Students and scholars wishing to learn about the Aztecs for the first time as well as scholars who are well familiar with the Aztecs will benefit from this volume. 
The first chapter introduces some of the main sources of information about the Aztecs, including historical doc­uments, archaeological remains, and ethnography. Berdan presents an appraisal of the strengths and weak­nesses of different sources, focusing on how scholars have combined these sources to learn about the Aztecs. The chapter introduces a feature used throughout the book to add to the main points of each chapter: the use of case studies, clearly separated from the main text in boxes that enhance the text by developing specific exam­ples. The case studies in this chapter focus on the survival of historical documents, as exemplified by the Codex Mendoza, the survival of archaeological material as exemplified by the Aztec Calendar Stone, and the use­fulness of ethnographic evidence, as seen in the case of the continued use of the backstrap loom until today. Every chapter in the book includes a number of case studies that readers could skip and still understand the main text but that enhance the main text in important and useful ways. Berdan carefully chose the case studies not only to provide important information, but also to enter­tain and amuse readers with the content of the different cases and the wit and humor of her writing. Chapter I also introduces some of the themes developed in the rest of the book, including "complexity," referring to the vari­ation in political conditions within the empire; cultural "diversity and variation" among the people that formed part of the empire; "interaction" between different seg­ments of the empire in economic, social, political, and symbolic ways; and the "dynamics and causality" of change in the Aztec world. 
Chapter 2 places the Aztecs in the broader context of Mesoamerica as a cultural region. It first gives a brief perspective on the definitions that scholars have provided for Mesoamerica. Then, it provides cursory summaries of the civilizations that the Aztecs themselves considered to be their direct predecessors, including Teotihuacan and Tula. The chapter then develops ideas about how the Aztecs made references to these past civilizations and how they manipulated ethnic terms and identities to bol­ster claims to power, create solidarity, stereotype ene­mies, and otherwise manage conflicts and alliances in the "mosaic of cultures, languages, and self-interested polities" (p. 46) that made up the Aztec world.

Chapters 3 and 4 focus mostly on the Aztec economy. Chapter 3 provides a summary of the ecology of central Mexico, Aztec demography, agricultural techniques, irrigation, and household provisioning. Chapter 4 focuses on craft production, trade, marketplaces, and merchants. Unless I underestimate undergraduate stu­dents' interest in the details of ancient economies and craft production, Chapter 4 is the only chapter that might be too heavy for many undergraduate students. In this chapter, the level of detail reflects long-standing debates on Aztec craft production and all of the dimensions and abstractions of those debates. The discussion is long and in-depth, and scholars who are interested may find information on many aspects of production, including its context, intensity, diversity, concentration, and orga­nization, as well as aspects of the production process, exchange of goods, types of marketplaces, and different kinds of merchants. 
Chapter 5 directs attention to Aztec imperial politics, from the city-state to the empire, touching upon rulers, the duties of rulers, the bases of power, conquest warfare, and the strategies of both the empire and the provinces in the empire. This chapter excels at showing two patterns at once: historical change in the way power was exercised in the Aztec empire, and regional variation in terms of power and political organization. Even though Berdan takes the time to show both synchronic and diachronic variation, she manages to convey the political strategies and organization of the empire with clarity. In addition, the chapter includes perhaps the most amusing case study in the book, dealing with how the Aztecs moved (or did not move) a giant boulder to create a monument for Motecuhzoma. 
Chapters 6 and 7 focus on society and culture, with Chapter 6 dealing with social status and daily life, and Chapter 7 dealing with religion, science, and the arts. Readers may learn about social classes and social mobil­ity in the Aztec world, family life, life trajectories, mar­riage, gender, and even how Aztec society dealt with criminals. The chapter on religion, science, and the arts provides a discussion of how these three aspects of Aztec culture were interconnected in many ways. Particularly interesting is the discussion on Aztec science, in which Berdan explains that science and medicine had ritual/reli­gious aspects but were also based on empirical observa­tion. The efficacy of many Aztec cures has been verified by modem science, as Berdan explains in an interesting passage. 
The final chapter develops three case studies at length to highlight how different aspects of the Aztec world, from cosmology to trade to politics, were interconnected in all aspects of Aztec life. The case studies are: military regalia, the Aztec world system, and the Spanish con­quest. In these case studies, Berdan ties together the main themes discussed in the first chapter with empirical cases. 
The goal of the Cambridge World Archaeology series is to provide surveys of archaeological cases that will be useful to students as well as academics and professional archaeologists. In this excellent volume, Berdan has met those goals by providing an up-to-date synthesis of the Aztecs, as well as glimpses of new frontiers in Aztec studies. The volume is highly recommended for use in the classroom or as a first stop when learning about the Aztecs. It is a real contribution to Aztec studies.

This volume represents the most important advance in decades in our understanding of what is known in the West as "religion" among precolumbian societies of the Andes. The 11 chapters of The Archaeology ofWak'as, each written by an eminent Andean specialist, plus the cogent introductory chapter by the editor, Tamara L. Bray, move the study of the "sacred" to a new and higher plane than has been realized previously. 
From the title, it is obvious that what is at issue is the term, concept, and body of objects referred to as wak' a (also spelled huaca, and guaca). For anyone who is familiar with recent Andean studies, the term wak' a will be recognized as having a long pedigree, going back to the middle of the twentieth century, especially in the works of the ethnohistorian R. Tom Zuidema. In his study of the social, political, and ritual organization of the Inka capital, Cusco, Zuidema focused on the ceque (or ziki) system, an arrangement of 41 conceptual, or imaginary, lines extending from Cusco to the horizon in as many different directions. Each (imaginary) line was an alignment of 3 to 15 sacred places in the landscape, each termed a wak'a. Each wak'a was named, was offered sacrifices, and had its day in the Inka ritual cal­endar. By the time the ceque system was recorded in a written document, it had become an artifact. The written text was a description of an arrangement of what, before the conquest, was a dynamic organization of places in the landscape, each wak' a of which was linked to myths, ceremonial actions, and other rituals. By virtue of the persecution of indigenous religious practices by the Spanish Catholic conquerors, the system became frozen in time. 
In addition to references to wak'as in the ceque sys­tem of Cusco, the term appeared innumerable times in other documents on Andean religion, such as in what is known as The Huarochir{ Manuscript, the most impor-
