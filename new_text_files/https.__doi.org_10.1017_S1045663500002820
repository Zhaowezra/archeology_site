Previous studies of the Nasca culture of south coastal Peru (A.D. 1-750) have concentrated on its cemeteries, ceremonial centers, trophy heads, beautiful polychrome pottery, and the famous geoglyphs better known as the Nasca Lines. In this groundbreaking volume, Kevin Vaughn presents the first analysis of a Nasca habitation site, providing what he calls a "village perspective" of Nasca society. Reminiscent of Kent Flannery' s seminal household analysis in his edited volume The Early Mesoamerican Village, Vaughn concentrates on the political economy and agency in a small village named Marca ya in the upper reaches of the Nasca (Tierras Blan­cas) tributary of the Rio Grande de Nasca drainage. His stated focus was (1) the investigation of power and inequality in the village, (2) economic organization, especially subsistence and political economies, and (3) ideology seen through ritual (p. 7). Marca ya dates to the Early Nasca Period (A.D. 1-450) when the ceremonial center of Cahuachi was at its peak of influence, a period before larger aggregated villages appear along with political secularization, and before a more stratified sociopolitical organization appears. This is the context in which Vaughn's view of Nasca society must be seen. 
The book is divided into nine sections. Chapter 1 introduces the reader to the Nasca culture and the changes in its sociopolitical organization over time, emphasizing the Early Nasca people as a middle range society consisting of independent villages sharing a common cultural tradition with the ceremonial center of Cahuachi serving as a cult center. Chapter 2 intro­duces Vaughn's theoretical perspective, which focuses on "power and inequality, subsistence and political economies, and ideology as seen through ritual activi-: ties" (p. 8). The importance of analyzing agency and power differences at residential sites rather then revert­ing to the debate over whether the society is a chief­dom or state is argued. Chapter 3 presents the archaeological background to the research including the geographic and environmental context, a summary of the prehistory of the region, and the need for village studies. In Chapter 4 Vaughn describes the methodol­ogy used in his study of Marcaya. This "village approach" concentrates on the relationship among the 
individuals within the settlement to obtain a better understanding of agency, power, and political econ­omy. The excavations at Marcaya are detailed in Chap­ter 5. Households were found to be arranged into "patio groups," eight of which were sampled. Status differ­ences were detected by variation in the size of these patio groups and the associated artifacts. "Households were the primary economic unit at Marcaya and each was economically independent, as each patio group was functionally redundant and had the components to sustain a domestic unit. All households contained evi­dence for food storage and processing, cooking and consumption ... No evidence of communal storage, food processing or other activities were revealed" (p. 91 ), leading the author to argue for a very simple social­political organization at the site. A notable discovery was that there is no evidence for pottery manufacture at the site. This theme is expanded in Chapter 6, which presents an analysis of the pottery found at Marcaya. Both fineware (fancy polychrome painted vessels) and utilitarian pottery were present in all the household groups. Geochemical sourcing of the paints and clay from the fineware vessels (details published elsewhere) and the lack of signs of pottery production at the site led the author to argue for a specialized production of polychromes, most likely at the ceremonial site of Cahuachi. Non-ceramic artifacts are described in Chap­ter 7, especially spindle whorls found in most house­hold groups, indicating local textile production and the

REVIEWS AND BOOK NOTES 
self-sufficiency of each household group rather than it 
being a communal activity. Abundant lithic artif acts 
were uncovered including projectile points, drills, and 
knives made from obsidian, chalcedony, and basalt 
respectively. A particular patio group (V) appears to 
have been the locus oflithic production, seeming to con­
tradict the author's argument for total household self­
sufficiency. In Chapter 8 the author summarizes 
Marcaya as an early Nasca village with a mixed agro­
pastoral economy and an emerging political structure 
characterized by status differences in the form oflarger 
households and the restricted use of certain artifact 
classes (p. 10). The concluding chapter (9) places Mar­
ca ya in the context of the ceremonial center of 
Cahuachi, which is seen as the seat of a permanent elite 
class of ritual specialists who control ideology partly 
through the distribution of fineware pottery, all of which 
Vaughn claims was produced at that site. The impor­
tance of a village approach to early complex societies 
is again reiterated. 
Vaughn's book is an important contribution to our ever -changing know ledge of the development of Nasca society. Aside from site descriptions made in conjunc­tion with a number of recent surface surveys in the Nasca drainage, no complete excavation and analysis has yet been made of a Nasca habitation site prior to this study, making this a vital first step toward a bal­anced reconstruction of this important complex soci-. ety. In calling it a first step, and fully acknowledging the value of the insights produced by this study, there are a number of precautions that need to be stated. Mar­ca ya is one small village in the SNR (southern Nasca region), a somewhat marginal part of the territory occu­pied by the Nasca culture. The site was chosen for study because it was relatively undisturbed and was a single occupational unit dating to the Early Nasca period. There are larger and more complex villages dating to this time period, not only in the SNR but also, more importantly, in the northern tributaries of the drainage where water and agricultural land are more abundant. For example, the site of Los Molinas in the Rfo Grande valley has been characterized by its excavators (rightly ·1or wrongly) as a "civic ceremonial center," an admin ­istrative center of an early Nasca state. Statements characterizing Early Nasca villages as being socio­economically independent of one another and house­holds within those villages as being self-sufficient with little or no communal interaction should be considered tentative at best, pending the excavation of a much larger sample of such villages. Although Vaughn's study 

shows no evidence of ayllus, dual organization, or local and regional political leaders, evidence from Cahuachi and elsewhere suggests the picture for the society as a whole may be much more complex. Nasca must be viewed in the context of an Andean society, one which more likely than not exhibited features shared with later societies in the region such as reciprocity, prestige hier­archies, ancestor worship, and the like. The true nature of the sociopolitical organization of Early Nasca soci­ety probably lies somewhere between Vaughn's self­sufficient villages and Reindel and Isla's primitive state. Vaughn's analysis of agency and power at the village level, however, provides a fresh perspective toward answering this question. 
Another of Vaughn's major assumptions might also be challenged. A key argument in his scenario for the locus of power and the spread of religious ideology is that all the fine polychrome pottery found at Marcaya (and similar sites) was produced at and distributed from Cahuachi. This assumption seems improbable for the following reasons. The Rio Grande de Nasca Drainage covers 10,700 square kilometers, and Early Nasca pot­tery is found throughout that entire region plus many sites in the lea Valley and outlying areas as well. Could all of these pieces have been made at a single site?Vari­ation in iconography and quality is present in this pot­tery, suggesting multiple points of manufacture by multiple artisans with diverse skills. The fact that fire pits and manufacturing debris were not found at the only excavated Nasca village cannot be used to imply that other villages were not producing fineware. The iden­tical clay composition found in the pottery from Mar­caya and several other sites in the SNR with that of pottery from Cahuachi could alternatively be explained by potters from these regional sites getting their clay from the same general source. The questions raised here beg for the excavation of additional Nasca habi­tation sites in a variety of locations and chronological periods. 
Despite the qualifications just outlined, this is an extremely valuable book, providing the first overview of an allegedly typical Early Nasca village, the identi­fication of patio groups as an integral part of the set­tlement, an analysis of the political economy, and productive insights into the role of ideology in the power structure at this point in Nasca prehistory. It is the hope of this reviewer that Vaughn and others will continue to study additional habitation sites and press forward with the "village perspective" so cogently presented in this book.
