LABOR, POPULATION MOVEMENT, AND FOO D 
IN SIXTEENTH-CENTURY EK BALAM, YUCATAN 

Susan D. deFrance and Craig A. Hanson 
Spanish colonization of the Yucatan Peninsula altered traditional patterns of subsistence after Spaniards imposed labor demands and controlled the movement of indigenous Maya. Spaniards established an encomienda and Franciscan visita at Ek Balam in the northern lowlands of the peninsula during the mid-sixteenth century. Complementary forces of doctrina and encomiendafostered the religious, political, and economic subjugation of the Maya. An analysis of zooarchaeological mate­rial from an Early Hispanic period feature at the archaeological site of Ek Balam indicates that Spanish restrictions of pop­ulation movement and restructuring of indigenous labor altered pre-Hispanic patterns of fauna{ use. Under Spanish hegemony, Maya residents raised small-sized animals of Eurasian origin, especially pigs and chickens, while maintaining the indigenous dog as a primary food source. The animals used at Ek Balam could have been either raised or hunted locally; there is no indication that animals were obtained through either trade or exchange. The pattern offaunal use by indigenous people at Ek Balam differs 
from Early Hispanic sites in the southern Maya lowlands and elsewhere in the circum-Caribbean. This contrast demonstrates that tropical environmental variability, population density, and Spanish control tactics affected subsistence behavior and the incorporation of introduced fauna in the indigenous diet.

If the colonists were suc­cessful in restricting population movement and con­trolling production (i.e., altering economic output to fulfill colonist demands) as we hypothesize, the faunal record would indicate a reliance on animals that could be raised or hunted locally; this pattern would contrast with pre-Hispanic patterns of ani­mal use elsewhere in the northern lowlands. 
While the Maya diet was predominantly agri­cultural, animals were significant nutritional and economic components. Despite a mosaic of envi­ronmental settings, similarities in faunal assem­blages from archaeological sites across Maya sites and regions indicate that many similarities existed in the pre-Hispanic use of animals (see Emery 2004, ed.; Fedick 1996; Hamblin 1984; Masson 2004). Although the Maya had access to the domestic dog and turkey, hunted terrestrial game animals (e.g., deer, tapir, peccaries, agouti, rabbits, opossums, armadillo, small carnivores, monkeys) are significant components of Maya diet. Second, aquatic resource use varied significantly by site location; however, freshwater turtles and various marine fishes are common in faunal assemblages (see Emery 2004, ed.). If Spanish policies had lit­tle effect on traditional animal use, we would expect the faunal assemblage to contain a variety of hunted animals included animals from aquatic habitats. 
In the sections that follow we present docu­mentary evidence pertaining to colonial policies on labor, population movement, and the acquisition of fauna. We briefly discuss Ek Balam during the sixteenth-century, describe the history of Postclas­sic and Early Hispanic period archaeological field-

work at the site, outline field methods, and briefly summarize results. Next, we describe the excava­tion of a feature unique to northern Maya lowlands archaeology and the deposit located within it. The analysis and interpretation of fauna! remains from the feature are followed by a discussion of their sig­nificance and comparisons with fauna! assemblages from elsewhere in the region. 
We infer from the archaeological data presented here that Hispanic policies restricting population movements and regulating the deployment of labor reduced the variety of native, nondomesticated fauna consumed by the Maya as compared to the pattern of pre-Hispanic animal use in the northern 
·lowlands and to both pre-Hispanic and Early His­panic contexts in the southern lowlands. Con­comitant with a decline in the use of wild fauna, Ek Balam inhabitants had access to a limited num­ber of recently introduced small-sized animals of Eurasian origin, particularly pigs and chickens, which could adapt to the tropical climate and be reared in the confines of the community. 
The pattern of fauna! use presented here is of interest to researchers of the sixteenth and seven­teenth centuries in the Maya lowlands as well as elsewhere in the Americas and Circum-Caribbean. 
Although extensive research into the effects of His­panic colonization on Maya communities has been conducted in Belize (Cohen et al. 1997; Emery 1990, 1999; Graham 1991; Graham et al. 1989; Pendergast 1986a, 1986b, 1991, 1993), the Ek Balam study provides new data on northern Yucatan, a region for which no other sixteenth­century colonial zooarchaeological data are avail­able. This study complements previous research on the pre-Hispanic patterns of diet and subsis­tence for Yucatan in general (Carr 1986; Clutton­Brock and Hammond 1994; Hamblin 1984; Hopkins 1992; Masson 1999; Olsen 1972, 1978; Pohl 1985; Pohl and Feldman 1982; Pollock and Ray 1957; Wing 1981; Wing and Scudder 1991; Wing and Steadman 1980). 
Beyond the Yucatan Peninsula this report com­plements studies of faunal use in Spanish colonies in North America (deFrance 1999; Pavao­Zuckerman and Reitz 2006; Reitz 1990, 1993; Reitz and Scarry 1985), Hispaniola (Deagan and Reitz 1995; Reitz and McEwan 1995), and the Cen­tral Andes (deFrance 1993, 1996, 2003). Across the geographic spectrum of Hispanic hegemony food habits were an area of significant innovation depen­dent on an array of local conditions.

The Northern Maya Lowlands in the Late Sixteenth Century 
Maya communities (republicas de indios) in the northern low lands of the Yucatan Peninsula under­went the historical process of incorporation into the early-modem world economy during the late six­teenth century (Hopkins and Wallerstein 1987). Pre-Hispanic political centers provided the infra­structure for colonial economic enterprises and the demographic concentration of indigenous popula­tions for Christian indoctrination. Two primary Spanish institutions structured colonial economic and evangelical activities on the peninsula. First, the encomienda, a royal grant of tribute goods and personal service from a Maya community (or com­munities) to a Spaniard, determined economic enterprise (Chamberlain 1951). Colonial adminis­trations specified the type, quantity, and schedule of tribute payment. Second, the doctrina, a Fran­ciscan center or school, provided missionaries with a means for converting indigenous souls according to strict ritual routine (McAlister 1984 ). Francis­can friars permanently resided at monastic foun­dations in larger settlements and conducted visitas, or periodic visits to smaller community chapels to catechize, hold mass, and collect tithes (Hanson l 995c ). Although encomendero and friar were often at odds, the church and the encomienda worked in tandem to usurp traditional Yucatecan communi­ties (and their resources) and transform them into Spanish municipalities (municipios) that consisted of individual nuclear households, which consti­tuted both the core of a "primitive" capitalist econ­omy and the nucleus for Christian conversion (Hanson 1997). 1 
The early colonial economy focused on the accumulation of capital through the acquisition of exportable wealth that could be sent back to Spain (see MacLeod 1973). In order for encomenderos to accumulate capital they required production of materials that could be sold for profit. The most common commodities Spaniards acquired through tasaci6n (taxation) in the northern lowlands were essentially the same as those proffered to Maya lords prior to colonization: com, cotton cloth (man­tas), pottery, wax, honey, and fowl (turkeys or intro­duced chickens) (Chamberlain 1951; Paso y Troncoso 1939[1549]; Roys 1943:62-63). "Exportable wealth," however, was accumulated through the compulsory manufacture and market­ing of indigo, cochineal, salt, sugar, and lime (for construction) (Hanson 2002b; Quezada 2001 ). The combination of compulsory production with com­mercial enterprise in sixteenth-century Yucatan was known as the repartimiento (Farriss 1984:43; Fer­nandez Tejedo 1990: 144-145; Thompson 1999: 16). Both the repartimiento and the encomienda required a sedentary population as a labor force. 
A sedentary population was essential also to the. doctrina. Bushnell (1990:476) has documented the importance of the "sacramental imperative," the link between sedentism and the sacraments, in the Spanish colonies of the circum-Caribbean: "the obligation to be present in church on set days to observe set rituals, and the related obligation to stay within the beat of an itinerant priest. These two unyielding, enforceable obligations prescribed fixed settlement to the [Maya] convert." 
The colonial administration in the northern low­lands recognized early in the colonization process that restricting indigenous population movement was essential to the labor requirements of the encomienda and the repartimiento, and the sacra­mental imperative of the doctrina (Farriss 1978, 1984; Ryder 1977). This policy is demonstrated in Oidor Tomas Lopez Medel ordenanzas for the Yucatan, the sixth ordenanza mandated sedentism among Maya: 
because, as experience has demonstrated, by the permission that has been given to the [Maya] of this said province to move from town to town, they are not able to be instructed easily, to go from one town to another makes vagrants, fleeing from the doctrina. Therefore, I order that neither indio nor india of this said province, native and resident of some town of it, is able to move and leave their nativity and town, in order to go to live in another, without the permission of the council of the Spanish town Uusticia def pueblo de espafioles] in whose boundaries is the town of such [Maya] [Ancona 1889:540-541; translation by Han­son]. 
The mobility of the Maya, according to this arti­cle, made them difficult to "indoctrinate" and reduced them to "vagrants." The forty-second orde­nanza enforced sedentism for a more blatant eco-

nomic reason. "Because the indios on occasion of the hunt use bow and arrows, they go about dis­tracted in the forest for a long time, and they for­get their obligatory tasks and other dangers occur, it is ordered that they bum the bows and arrows that they had" (Ancona 1889:555-556; translation by Hanson). In this case, the Maya were forbidden from leaving their communities to go hunting because they are "gone for a long time and forget their 'work."' 
Subsequent chroniclers noted that the impact of Lopez Medel's ordenanzas, and other Spanish colo­nial policies, was to restrict mobility and force the Maya to remain in their communities (Edmonson 1982:164; Pech 1969(1562]). When mobility was restricted, the amount of food contributed to the diet by hunting declined, and the shortage had to be ful­filled through other means. At Ek Balam , the change was in the types of animals acquired and their use during the early colonial period. 
Sixteenth-Century Tiquibalon and 
Archaeological Investigations at Ek Balam 

The Late Postclassic community at Ek Balam was a cuchcabal ("burden-carrying-community") according to oral histories of Maya principales (principals, town leaders) recorded in the Relacion of Tiqu ibal6n (1898-1900 [1579]: 153-163; Quezada 1993) that collected tribute from depen­dent towns. The community was granted encomienda in 1545 and approximately eight years later a Franciscan cleric oversaw the construction of a visita chapel at the site (Hanson 1995c ). Aban­donment of the settlement in the early seventeenth century and the relative isolation of the region sub­sequently provided excellent conditions for the preservation of archaeological deposits (Deal 1998; Hanson 2001, 2002a; Hayden and Cannon 1983). 
William M. Ringle and George J. Bey III directed the Ek Balam Archaeological Project (EKBAP) from 1984 to 1996 (Bey et al. 1997). Ringle identified the remains of sixteenth-century chapel architecture at the site in 1991. Subse­quently, Hanson ( 1992, 1995a, 1995b, 1996) inves­tigated the Late Postclassic/Early Hispanic component in this area of the site. The research design consisted of EDM mapping limited sys­tematic surface collections of the approximately 130 structures in the survey area and systematic sur­
face collections and test excavations of 19 of these 
structures. Shallow trenches, horizontal exposures, 
and stratigraphic excavation further explored these 
and other structures and features. 
The sixteenth-century settlement at Ek Balam centered on the friary-and-chapel complex, and the adjacent dwellings (the Chapel Group). The dis­tinctive plan and size of two structures (HT03 and HT21) of the Chapel Group, in conjunction with their associated artifact complexes (e.g., iron knife blades and architectural hardware; olive jar, majolica, and porcelain) led Hanson (1997, 2001, 2002a) to hypothesize that these residences housed ranking members of the Early Hispanic settlement. Each of these two dwellings has a distinctive set of two architectonic features spatially associated with it. These features are a circular wall (HT02, HT15A) and, a short distance away, a square shaft (HTNORIAl AND HTNORIA2) penetrating the limestone bedrock. The proximity of these features in each set, and their repeated pattern, indicates the features are a functional unit. The feature sets are situated near the rim of the shallow, but wide rejol­lada ( doline, sinkhole) south of the chapel. Each feature is discussed in tum in the paragraphs that follow. 
The circular walls (HT02, HT15A) are built with reutilized Puuc-veneer stones set in red mor­tar (kankab). The stones show evidence of being subjected to heat intense enough to "fry" the stone. Excavation of one-half of the circular-wall con­struction (HT15A) associated with one residence (HT21) uncovered an updraft kiln of Moorish ori­gin approximately 3 min diameter similar to Early Hispanic kilns reported elsewhere (Hernandez Aranda 1989:232-236; Lister and Lister 1982:82; Rice 1994). A deposit of construction lime was uncovered on the excavated interior floor and a lens of ash was exposed at the mouth of the firebox. 
The second feature of each set consists of a square shaft cut through the bedrock surface and the softer deposits below it (Figures 3 and 4). The ground surface area surrounding the 2.1-x-2-m aperture of each shaft is inclined toward the open­ing and is reminiscent of the captation area of an indigenous chultun (underground storage bin/tank). The feature differs from a chultun, however, in two respects. First, the aperture is square and therefore contrasts sharply with the universally circular aper­ture of pre-Hispanic chultunob (pl.). Second, chul-
