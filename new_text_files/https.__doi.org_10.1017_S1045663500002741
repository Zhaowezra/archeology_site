LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 20, No. 2, 2009) 
opinions that come from widely accepted ideas. He bor­rows the concept of chaos from physics and mathemat­ics to discuss the problems that archaeology faces by applying specific models in a rigid way, expecting there­fore rigid outcomes, and to explain the complexity of culture and, more so, the interaction between cultures. 
Keegan analyzes the interaction process between two completely different societies that all of a sudden came into contact. Both were characterized by their own beliefs and behaviors, which led the two parties to interpret the same events according to their own ideol­ogy. Columbus was welcomed because of a complex ideological, political, and mythical cosmos that per­meated the Taino society, the same features that led the mythical Caonab6 to become king. This chief, in fact, according to the narratives (which often report myths and legends as if they were real), was not a native of Hispaniola (nowadays the Caribbean island in the Greater Antilles that encompasses Santo Domingo and Haiti), being born in the Lucayan islands in the Bahamas archipelago. 
This is the starting point of Keegan's work: he argues that Caonab6 was indeed a real person who was not born in the island, and not just the product of myths and tales; he aims at unveiling from the archaeological and eth­nohistorical evidence the geographical, ethnic, and social origins of this important cacique and the ideo­logical and mythical reasons that brought his crowning into "practice." What was the Taino's social structure and ideological fabric, and how could a foreign chief become king? 
In order to accomplish his goal, Keegan structures this book into seven chapters, which allow him to put into context the whole frame of reference. He starts by providing a detailed analysis of the mythology of the Tai nos and how it was misinterpreted by the Europeans and turned into narratives. By putting together legends, myths, ideology, and chronicles, he demystifies, for example, the figure of the "cannibal" Caribs. Their human flesh-eating habits were a Taino's mythological perception that was enhanced by historians and anthro­pologists who missed the dichotomy between myth and reality. 
From legends back to archaeology, he reconstructs the archaeological contexts from detailed analyses and interpretation of various sites in Hispaniola and in the Lucayan islands, highlighting the economic relation­ships between these two regions (the Lucayan islands were a Taino outpost in the Bahamas), to eventually point to what he thinks can be the place of origin of Caonab6. Unfortunately no skeletal remains of Caon­ab6 exist, otherwise chemical analyses could corrobo­rate Keegan's hypothesis. What I consider the most important part of this book (without degrading the other chapters) is the careful analysis of the Taino's social structure and patterns of kinship and matrilocality, with­out which it would have been impossible to make infer­ences of any sort on Caonabo's place of birth. 
This book is a very interesting example of an open­minded combination of archaeology, ethnohistory, and cultural anthropology. It is also easy to read, because it is "seasoned" with the author's personal experiences through years of excavation of the sites as well as anec­dotes. At first glance, some might not have been nec­essary (like the extensive chapter on Sullivan's excavation), but in reality they contribute to give shape to an appealing work that can be useful for professional scholars as well as for amateur archaeologists regard­less of their region of interest.

Piedras Negras Archaeology, 193/-1939. JOHN M. WEEKS, JANE A. HILL, and CHARLES GOLDEN, editors. University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archae­ology and Anthropology, Philadelphia, 2005. xiii+ 425 pp., figures, appendices, bibliography, index. $75.00 (cloth).

For nearly a decade, the Classic Maya center of Piedras Negras, Guatemala, was subject to extensive excavations by archaeologists associated with the University Museum of the University of Pennsylvania (now the University of Pennsylvania Museum). Yet, as noted by the editors, John M. Weeks, Jane A. Hill, and Charles Golden, few official publications resulted from this pro­ject. Those that did emerge circulated little or remained hidden in the private libraries of researchers. In a worth­while effort to remedy the lack of published data, the editors have compiled most of these original papers and 
reports in a single volume. 
Divided into two parts, this book reproduces the individual fascicles that together composed the Piedras Negras Preliminary Papers (Part I) and Piedras Negras Archaeology: Architecture (Part II). Included in chap­ters are original figures, tables, and charts, which for the first time provide numerical designations for easy reference, as well as photographs converted to digital format in an effort to improve quality. The editors have amended portions of the original documents to follow contemporary conventions of archaeological publication, to promote accuracy, and to correct occa­sional omissions. These alterations appear as endnotes to each chapter, offering the dual benefit of retaining the original authors' writing and ensuring updated information for those who will use these data in their own work.

REVIEWS AND BOOK NOTES 
The import and utility of this volume should not be underestimated, especially as pressures increase to disseminate primary excavation data to a wider audi­ence. The information contained in these fascicles should interest Mayanists researching Piedras Negras or those conducting comparative studies. In addition, as the editors point out, the papers and the site they discuss represent an important stage in the history of Americanist archaeology. The architecture of Piedras Negras enabled archaeologists to develop revolution­ary ideas about building function and stylistic evolu­tion, while its monuments allowed Tatiana Proskouriakoff to reveal the historical nature of hiero­glyphic inscriptions. The value of this book mirrors the significance of Piedras Negras as an ancient Maya kingdom.
