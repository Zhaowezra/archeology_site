This article examines changes in ritual practices during the Epiclassic period in central Mexico. It presents data recovered from recent excavations of a shrine discovered in Lake Xaltocan in the northern Basin of Mexico. Pottery and AMS dates place the construction and use of the shrine in the Epiclassic period. The shrine was first built during or soon after the col­lapse of the Teotihuacan state. With the decline of Teotihuacan and the emergence of competing centers, ritual practition­ers began human sacrifice: the remains of over 30 individuals were documented, including 13 complete severed crania. This practice suggests conflict as the political landscape became decentralized. Despite how broader processes may have affected behavior, the shrine, ritual practice was fundamentally local. We present archaeobotanical evidence r1f offerings of food, incense, and flowers that elucidates the microlevel nature o.t ritual at the shrine.

burned incense and the resinous wood of pine. They scattered or deposited flowers. These data suggest that ritual practices were complex choreographed events. This structured aspect of the ritual process also extended to human sacrifice. Male adults were killed and decapitated, their heads lined up facing east as offerings. 
Below we first offer an overview of the time period archaeologists designated as the Epiclassic period. We then provide a picture of the environ­ment and settlement during the Epiclassic period in the study region. This background is followed by a presentation of our excavations at the shrine, which is designated Non-Grid 4. These excava­tions uncovered extensive evidence of human sac­rifice, and we describe the anatomical, pathological, and depositional characteristics of the human remains. To pinpoint the chronology of the shrine and the sacrifices , we present AMS dates and ceramic data that indicate an Epiclassic period time frame . Finally, we interpret the significance of the shrine and the human sacrifices as part of broader dynamics in the political and social landscape. Sit­uating the site in terms of widespread processes, however, does not distract from the necessity of understanding more microlevel aspects of religious behavior. We , thus, present archaeobotanical data that shed light on the nature of offerings and ritual practice. 
The Epiclassic Period 
The term "Epiclassic" denotes the period of time between the Classic and Early Postclassic periods in central Mexico, roughly A.D. 600 to A.D. 900. Following (or during) the collapse of the Teoti­huacan state, inhabitants in the Basin of Mexico either adopted or introduced new forms of mater­ial culture (e.g.,Berlo 1989; Crider 20 11; Dumond and Muller 1971 ; Manzanilla 2005; Rattray 1966; Solar Valverde 2006; Sugiura Yamamoto 1996). The rapid decline ofTeotihuacan's regional influ­ence created a political vacuum, fostering the emer­gence of new communities and centers, competition and conflict, and a more decentralized geopolitical situation (Cervantes Rosado and Fournier 1994; Blanton 1973; Crider 2011; Diehl and Berlo 1989; Garcfa Chavez 2004; Healan et al. 1998; Hirth 1989, 1995; Marcus 1989; Parsons 2006; Sugiura Yamamoto 1993). Garcfa Chavez (2004; Garcfa Chavez and Martinez Yrizar 2006; Garcfa Chavez et al. 2006) argues that at least four regional political economic spheres developed and influenced the Basin of Mexico, one of which emanated from Tula to the north (see also Crider 2011; Rattray 1996). 
The relationship between immigration and local development and the timing of the Epiclassic period continue to generate productive study. Much of the

material culture, particularly the ceramics, share similarities to wares outside the Basin of Mexico, particularly to the north (Cobean 1990; Lopez Perez and Nicolas Careta 2005; Mastache and Cobean 1989, 1990; Nelson and Crider 2005; Pina Chan 1967; Rattray 1966). These similarities might sug­gest immigration into the Basin of Mexico, perhaps initiating the histories recounted in later annals (Beekman and Christensen 2003). Other researchers stress demographic and ethnic conti­nuity despite dramatic political shifts (e.g., Sanders 
1986, 1989, 2006). Groups using Epiclassic style material culture (i.e., Coyotlatelco Red-on-Buff) were certainly present in the Basin of Mexico after the fall of Teotihuacan. Some see the Epiclassic period settlement at Teotihuacan itself as postcol­lapse, representing new immigrant communities (e.g., Gomez Chavez and Cabrera Castro 2006; Rattray 1996, 2006). For others, populations began emigrating from the city before its final downfall as the center's market began to diminish in signif­icance (e.g., Sanders 2006). 
These dichotomous perspectives are simplified; supporters of either view recognize multiple processes. Nevertheless, archaeologists have taken a prevalent "macro-scalar" approach in under­standing this time period. Without discounting the influence of broader processes, we note that less research has focused on the social and behavioral dynamics of more local level phenomena (see, for exception,Bonfil Olivera [2005]; Foumierand Var­gas Sanders [2002]). In this regard, the data pre­sented below on ritual offer a unique opportunity to consider more "microscalar" aspects of social behavior and practice. 
The Ecological and Archaeological Setting

tory is difficult because of intensive human activ­ities during the Postclassic period, particularly the construction of a large-scale chinampa system that greatly modified previous deposits (Frederick et al . 2005; Morehart 2010, 2012a). With Lake Zumpango, Lake Xaltocan is commonly consid­ered more saline than lakes Chalco and Xochim­ilco but less so than Lake Texcoco. Yet the lake shifted from a more saline environment about 2,000 years ago to a more brackish to freshwater lagoon during the period of Postclassic chinampa farming (Frederick et al. 2005:107). Today it is drained. The nature of the local environment during the Epi­classic period, however, is poorly understood. 
Paleoclimatological records from neighboring areas suggest increasing aridity and reduced lake levels during the Epiclassic period, which corre­sponds to a macroregional dry period (e.g., Almeida-Lefiero et al. 2005; Caballero et al. 2002; Hodell et al. 1995; Lozano Garcia et al. 2009; Lozano Garcia et al. 2005; Ludlow-Wiechers et al. 2005; Metcalfe et al. 2010; Stahle et al. 2011). At least in the Toluca Valley, people responded to lower lake levels by building artificial islands in the swampy environments and developing an econ­omy focused on aquatic resources (Lozano Garcia et al. 2005; Sugiura Yamamoto 2009). 
Most communities previously identified in the northern Basin of Mexico during the Epiclassic period were small hamlets or villages along the lake and lakeshore (Gorenflo and Sanders 2007; Parsonsetal.2008; Sandersetal.1979)(Figure 1). Some of these communities line the lakeshore plain and have been classified as local centers (Goren­flo and Sanders 2007). The presence of key cen­ters in hilltop locations, however, suggests a degree of conflict (Parsons et al. 2008:72), and this pat­tern may have been more widespread (see Mas­tache et al. 2002:62-69). 
During the later Postclassic period (ca. A.D. 900-1400) the polity of Xaltocan emerged in the middle of Lake Xaltocan and influenced much of the northern Basin of Mexico (Brumfiel 2005a; Carrasco Pizana 1950; Morehart 20 12b) . The growth of Xaltocan as a Postclassic kingdom pos­sibly was the result of strategies and alliances that community leaders forged during the Epiclassic period (Brumfiel 2005b). Small Epiclassic com­munities are located in the lake bed and lake shore plain surrounding Xaltocan, but centuries of over­burden have made it difficult to identify an intact Epiclassic component at the site. Nonetheless, Xal­tocan may have existed as another small commu­nity during this time. Frederick et al. (2005), in fact, found no evidence for a natural island on which Postclassic Xaltocan was founded and instead pro­posed that the site developed over an anthropogenic island similar to a tell. Given the paucity ofresearch on the Epiclassic period in this immediate area, the relationship between local sites and emerging polit­ical spheres is unknown. However, Garcia Chavez (2004; Garcia Chavez and Martinez Yrizar 2006; Garcia Chavez et al. 2006) positions the northern basin lake region between these spheres, which might suggest that local communities had to nav­igate influences from competing political systems. 
Location and Excavations of Non-Grid 4 
The shrine was discovered during an intensive archaeological project on chinampa agriculture sur­rounding the Postclassic period community ofXal­tocan (Morehart 2009, 2010, 2012a). Project members surveyed an area of prehispanic chinam­pas identified in satellite imagery. After establish­ing a survey grid over the area, surveyors made collections at each grid point. To maximize cover­age surveyors also walked between grid points and lines. Any dense concentration not falling on a point received a Non-Grid number. The shrine, desig­nated Non-Grid 4, was one such concentration. Non-Grid 4 lies in the southern portion of the sur­vey area about 2 km south of the modem commu­nity of Xaltocan and a similar distance from other documented Epiclassic habitation sites (Figure 1 ). It is located at the southern limit of Lake Xaltocan near a series of springs that later inhabitants chan­nelized to feed the Postclassic chinampas (Freder­ick et al. 2005; Morehart 2009, 2010). 
The area was looted, and the ground was lit­tered with artifacts and bones. After laying out a 2 x 2 m grid, we selected specific grid units for controlled excavations (Figure 2). Before excava­tions, however, the back dirt from looters' pits was screened. This work yielded a considerable vari­ety of artifacts and human remains, including per­forated seashell pendants; greenstone artifacts, mostly beads; figurines, many in the form of the rain deity Tlaloc; and figured elements represent­ing maize cobs and chile peppers, some of which

were parts of larger incense burners (Figure 3). (Some of these items were also recovered during excavations.) 
Excavations were carried out using a combina­tion of both metric, I 0-cm levels and natural or cul­tural levels. To standardize artifact frequencies, all soil was collected for screening using 7-liter metal buckets , and bucket counts were tabulated for each level. This method for measuring excavated soil volume is likely more accurate than simply calcu­lating volume by multiplying measurements for width, length, and depth. 
The shrine was a simple platform or mound con­structed to create an elevated surface in the lacus­trine environment by building up finely textured, highly calcareous material to almost a meter in depth.2The origin and parent material of this matrix is not known, but it is not naturally occurring in the local lake soils (see Frederick et al. 2005; Morehart 2009). It was likely brought in to use as construc­tion material in the form of caliche, marl, or crushed and processed limestone. Although we refer to the shrine as a platform, it lacks stone alignments, adobe bricks, or facing stones common for platforms else­where in Mesoamerica. By mounding calcareous material as fill, however, a functional platform was built above the lagoon (at least seasonally). Most of the platform was constructed over a relatively

short time span. If not, then additions were made in a way that blurred stratigraphic distinctions between depositional events (Figure 4). At the lowest exca­vation levels, the fill was intermixed with charcoal and lacustrine soil. No comers were detected, but the stratigraphy of two excavation units (E18N12 and E22N8) displayed the platform's edges. In both units, a transition existed between the fill and more compact, water-laid deposits. 
It is necessary to briefly justify our use of the term "shrine." We employ this term to designate a site or an area within a site used exclusively for ritual activity. The term "shrine" is used in the lit­erature to label natural or anthropogenic features in the landscape, locales constructed in a commu­nity or city for group rituals, or features built in a household and used for domestic rites (e.g., Becker 1999; Bierhorst 1992:60; Brady and Prufer 2005; Bradley 2000; Broda 1991; Brown 2004; Duran 1971: 160-165; Ek 2006; Plunket and Urufiuela 2002; Renfrew 1994; Sahagun 1951; Winter et al. 2007). Thus, shrines do not require extensive human modification. In the Basin of Mexico, shrines often were natural phenomena, such as the whirlpool of Pantitlan, where the Aztecs conducted rituals (including child sacrifices) (B ierhorst 1992:60; Broda 1991; Duran 1971:160-165; Sahagun 1951) or were very simple circular align­ments of posts (Parsons and Morett 2004:42-43). Despite this variability, the use of a site exclu­sively for ritual practices for an extended period (even if no longer than a generation or two) sug­gests focused worship in time and space and the creation of a place that differs qualitatively and functionally from other sites. We recognize the generality of our application of the term "shrine" but feel it permits flexibility in form while main­taining less flexibility in function. 
Non-Grid 4 appears to have been a specialized site dedicated to ritual activities and meets our def­inition as a shrine. Those activities included, but were not confined to, human sacrifice, as described below. No in situ deposits or features were found to suggest that the site had a previous domestic function. The platform was in use before the lake dried and prior to the deposition of soil around it. Several artifacts were found relatively intact at the base of the water-laid deposits just beyond the plat-

form's edges. At the lowest levels of E22N8, for example, smashed ladle incense burners and small, incised jars were intermixed with disarticulated human remains (Figure 5). These remains likely reflect ritual practices after the platform was con­structed in which objects (and perhaps body parts) were ritually disposed in or offered to the sur­rounding waters. As with most of the items from Non-Grid 4, these artifacts ' preservation indicates intentional deposition. Many sherds are large , are not worn, and are either nearly complete vessels or 
can be reconstructed into partially whole vessels. This condition would be unlikely if these items were refuse collected elsewhere and redeposited here. Although Elson and Smith (2001) described the deliberate ritual disposal of household refuse as part of New Fire ceremonies conducted at the end of a 52-year cycle, Non-Grid 4 lacks the fre­quency of domestic artifacts they describe. 
Other rituals at Non-Grid 4 have a dedicatory nature. In particular, we documented evidence that rituals were undertaken to venerate its initial con-

struction. At the base of the construction material in E8Nl2, in a level directly over lacustrine soil, we recovered a smashed, studded brazier associ­ated with a concentration of pine charcoal, which also yielded the earliest AMS date for the platform (see below). 
Human Sacrifice 
Excavations in EION4 uncovered evidence of human sacrifices. This unit was located just to the southeast of looters ' pit 3 (Figure 2), which con­tained many human remains, mostly cranial frag­ments. Soon after we began excavations, we uncovered the tops of several crania between 20 and 30 cm below the surface. The skulls were located in spaces of loosely compacted soil surrounded by a harder, more compacted layer. This compacted area represents the remnants of a surface eroded away or removed. As excavation proceeded , sev­eral more crania were exposed. Many crania were intact, although several were fragmented because of disturbance given the shallow depth. 
The human interments were designated Burial 1 (Figure 6). This burial contained mainly crania and cranial fragments (including mandible and maxilla fragments), although two Jong bone frag­ments and a fibula epiphysis were present in the loose soil directly over the crania (Meza Penaloza 20 10). Eleven complete crania were discovered, seven of which existed in a line extending from the northwest comer of the unit to the south edge of the unit. The remaining three followed the same lin­ear arrangement but to the east. Two of these three were intact but in poor condition; they were exca­vated in bulk to insure that they would be recov­ered and analyzed completely (Meza Penaloza and Serrano Sanchez 2009). 
Most of the crania face east, although some likely shifted after deposition. In addition to these crania, eight isolated cranial fragments were doc­umented. Many of these were likely intact skulls that were disturbed by animal burrowing. Four indi­vidual mandibles, one maxilla, and small concen­trations of human bone and teeth were documented. Some of the cranial fragments followed the same linear arrangement as the others and might repre­sent an additional line of skulls. 
The condition of the burials provides strong evi­dence that the individuals were decapitated and

deliberately buried as human sacrifices. With the 
exception of sporadic phalanges and the isolated long bone fragments, the skulls were not directly associated with any bones from the body. Most of the skulls had a few articulated vertebrae , which indicates primary deposition. They probably were deposited while muscles or tendons were still con­nected to the heads, otherwise the discovery of associated cervical vertebrae would be unlikely. In 
some specimens, the heads were severed between the first and second cervical vertebra, given the presence of cut marks on these bones, but most were cut between the third and the fourth (Meza Penaloza 2010). No clear grave goods were found . 
Additional evidence for human sacrifices came from the same excavation unit. A layer ofloosely compacted, brown to black silt lay under Burial I. Beneath this lens of dark soil, intermixed with remnant fill, two additional skulls were uncov­ered, designated Burial 2 (Figure 7). The skulls 
rested in the northeast comer of the unit and also faced east and had prominent cranial deforma­tions. Large sherds from two smashed incense burners lay to the west. A dense concentration of pine charcoal surrounded the area, likely kindling for the incense . A single human, distal phalanx rested on the top of the southern cranium. Several bird bones surrounded both crania, and a single, green, prismatic obsidian blade lay just to the west of and behind the southern cranium. Fragmented 
human remains were also exposed on top of the 
concentration of brazier fragments. 
Directly over the face of the cranium in the northeast corner, ritual practitioners placed the face of a broken figure. This figure appears to have been an effigy from a larger brazier, although it was not possible to refit it onto the associated bra­zier sherds from Burial 2 (Figures 7 and 8). The figure seems to depict an individual wearing a flayed skin. The mouth was figured to show

another mouth inside, an indication of flayed skin and an attribute of Xipe Totec, the later Postclas­sic deity of fertility and rebirth, who wore human skin (Duran 1971: 173; Gonzalez Gonzalez 20 11; Sahagun 1950:16-17, 1951:213). 
Meza Penaloza and Serrano Sanchez (2009; Meza Penaloza 2010) analyzed the skeletal assem­blage from Non-Grid 4, including the remains from burials as well as the disarticulated bones from units and looters pits. They calculate that at least 31 individuals are represented in the skeletal assemblage. Of the disarticulated remains, 15 were male adults or young adults. Only one adult female individual and two subadults were identified.3 It is, of course, impossible to stratigraphically asso­ciate the disarticulated remains from surface lev­els and looters' pits with the intact burials. However, their association is likely. First, as with the burials, virtually all the remains are cranial materials. Second, the depth and placement of pits with large numbers of cranial remains suggest they were dug into and disturbed the intact burials. All 13 crania from both intact burials were male adults (Table 1). Most individuals, nine, had cranial deformations, especially tabular erect deforma­tions, and four had incised teeth. 
Cranial bones are not restricted to the area sam­pled by E 1 ON4. Some were collected from looters' pits, and others were recovered as isolated frag­ments in other excavation units. Thus, the deposit of crania likely extends beyond the area excavated, suggesting more individuals are interred. For exam­ple, an additional cranium was documented at the base of looter's pit 13 (Figure 2), which increases the MNI to 32 individuals. The skull faced the east and was at the same depth and followed the same line as the western line of skulls in Burial I . This northern extension, however, ended at least by the area excavated with unit E8N12 as no intact cra­nia were uncovered there. Nevertheless, it is likely that the MNI is an underestimation. 
The actual causes of death are not certain. lt is possible that the heads were removed following death (rather than being the cause), which was a common sacrificial practice in central Mexico (Duran 1971; Fournier and Vargas Sanders 2002; Matos Moctezuma 2010; Mendoza 2007; Motolinfa 1903:72-74; Olivier and Lopez Lujan 2010; Pijoan Aguade and Mansilla Lory 1997; Sahagun 1951; Serrano Sanchez 1972).

lated fingers and toes and a few isolated long bone fragments were recovered with Burials 1 and 2. It was not possible to associate them biologically with any of the individuals interred, however. More postcranial materials were found disarticulated in deposits excavated in other units, including in the heavily compacted, water-laid soil that surrounded the platform fill, which elucidates the practices that led to their deposition. It is possible that individu­als were first sacrificed and dismembered. The heads were interred. The bodies were thrown into the surrounding lake as offerings, or the dismem­bered parts were distributed deliberately in differ­ent areas. 
Forty-four obsidian artifacts were recovered from both excavation units and looters' pits. Most are green obsidian blades from Pachuca, Hidalgo. Gray obsidian is more common following the breakdown of Classic period exchange networks centered at Teotihuacan, but green obsidian is rep­resented throughout central Mexico during the Epi­classic period and increases in distribution during the Postclassic period (Charlton and Spence 1983; Elam et al. 2008; Garcfa Chavez et al. 1990; Mil­hauser 2005; Morehart 2009:225; Sidrys 1977). Most blades exhibited medium to heavy wear, although any relationship between these wear pat­terns and the cutting of bone, tendons, and flesh has not yet been demonstrated. Although one was found directly behind a cranium in Burial 2, most are dispersed in the fill material. Contextually, therefore, it is difficult to associate them with the sacrifices. In fact, they may have been deposited later in the Postclassic period (see below). 
The blades were inadequate tools to slay vic­tims. One medial fragment of a gray obsidian bi face

knife was recovered. Such a tool was more effi­cient for killing victims, although cranial trauma suggests some victims suffered blows to the head. TheAztecs used similar bifacial knives to sacrifice victims and extract the heart (Matos Moctezuma 2010:47; Sahagun 1951).Additional support for the use of knives for sacrifice was recovered from the lower levels of unit E22N8, the same context that yielded the reconstructed vessels displayed above. We recovered fragments from a gray-ware effigy censer with a modeled individual. Only the arm of the individual was found, but she or he was depicted holding a large knife or cutting implement, similar in form to sacrificial knives used by the later Aztecs (Figure 8b). 
Dating the Sacrifices 
AMS dates on pine charcoal and maize cobs pro­vide the firmest chronological evidence on the con­struction of the platform and the sacrifices (Table 2). The earliest date (MA-121) has arange between 
A.D. 
550 and A.D. 660 (2a). The context for this date is secme. It was obtained from a sample of pine charcoal directly under the smashed studded brazier at the base of E8Nl 2, a deposit that dates the platform's initial construction (see above). The remaining dates were obtained from pine charcoal and maize cobs from Burials 1 and 2. All four fall within the Epiclassic period, between A.D. 640 and 

A.D. 
890 (2a), with most intercept dates in the sev­enth century AD.As with MA-121, these samples were also selected from secure contexts. FL-79a and FL-79b were recovered from a concentration of charred material under the smashed brazier next to Burial 2. The other samples were collected from

carbon concentrations under crania. The two buri­als, thus, fall within the same general time. Despite the overlap, they seem to postdate the platform's original construction and initial use, which occurred earlier according to the earlier date range and inter­cept from MA-121. 
Despite radiometric data, the most typical Epi­classic pottery types are absent from the shrine's assemblage. Unlike other Epiclassic sites in cen­tral Mexico, including some close to Xaltocan, no clear examples of Coyotlatelco Red-on-Buff pot­tery, a widespread, diagnostic Epiclassic type, were found. Considering all identified rim sherds recov­ered from the site, the three most commonly recur­ring types at Non-Grid 4 consist of (1) highly burnished gray-brown bowls (n = 216); (2) matte finish, gray-ware, ladle censers (n = 136); and (3) small, incised.polished, black-brown jars (n = 75). On the basis of comparisons with data from other sites, we assign these ceramic remains to the Epi­classic period. These types are more abundant than the most common Postclassic diagnostics found, notably Aztec Black-on-Orange (n = 19), Texcoco Molded (n 43),Black-on-Red (n 4), and Black­
= = 
and-White-on-Red (n = 15). Tables 3 and 4 display rim sherd frequencies and densities (frequency divided by the volume measure) of two excavation units (EION4 and E18Nl2) that exemplify the gen­eral spatial trend of pottery types at Non-Grid 4. Postclassic diagnostics are more common in super­ficial levels, which may suggest the reinitiation of ritual at the site after the landscape had been con­verted into a system of canals and chinampas (Morehart 2010, 2012a). In contrast, the three Epi­classic types were the most frequent and, unlike Postclassic materials, occur also in lower levels of the site (Tables 3 and 4). 
Highly burnished, gray-brown bowls were very common from both excavation units and looters' pits. Some specimens only have interior burnish­ing, while others exhibit wide burnish marks on both interiors and exteriors. Many bowls have sim­ilar paste and burnishing, but the interiors exhibit geometric, thick lined decorations rendered in either white or yellow (Figure 9). One of these specimens is a ring base bowl, a Classic period form that continues into the Epiclassic (Rattray 1966). This type of decoration, however, is uncom­mon in both Classic and Epiclassic assemblages in central Mexico, although Brumfiel and Rodriguez-Alegria (1 998) documented similar vessels from Michpilco (also called the ET Site) just north of Xaltocan. Crider (2011) found that the Michpilco vessels were produced from clays native to both the Xaltocan and the Teotihuacan areas and classi­fies them as Coyotlatelco. Highly burnished bowls without this decorative treatment, however, are common at Epiclassic sites in central Mexico (e.g., Cobean 1990; Garcfa Chavez 1995; Parsons 1971). 
Matte finish, gray ladle censers compose another group of vessels that we attribute to the Epi­classic. Figure 5c presents one from the bottom of E22N8. Ladle censers are uncommon in Classic period pottery assemblages in central Mexico (Rat­tray 2001 ). They occur in the Postclassic, as in the Texcoco Molded type (Parsons 1966:253-256), but the Epiclassic censers differ. The specimens from Non-Grid 4 have a uniform gray paste with square rims and have a matte surface finish, although some specimens have handle burnishing that extends to the base. Many sherds from the censers' bowls have small holes to allow smoke to exit. The absence of these types from Classic period assemblages and their technological and stylistic difference from Postclassic censers reinforce their temporal placement in the Epiclassic period. In paste, surface finish, and fonn, these censers are highly similar to Epiclassic period Xoo phase ceramics found in highland Oaxaca, although also documented in central Mexico (Martinez Lopez et al. 2000; Smith and Lind 2005; Michael Smith, per­sonal communication, 2012). 
A final distinctive type consists of highly pol­ished, incised, black-brown pottery. All are small mouth jars. Figure 5d displays an example from E22N8. These small jars have geometric incisions surrounding the exterior under the narrow neck. The most common decoration consists of incised triangles, although other styles occur. Incised wares are common in the Epiclassic assemblages at Teotihuacan, but small jar forms seem to be rare (Lopez Perez and Nicolas Careta 2005). Incised­Punctate pottery is common at Cerro Portezuelo (Crider 2011). Pina Chan (1967:142, 146) also reported Epiclassic incised wares from Pedregal de San Angel in Coyoacan. The Non-Grid 4 spec­imens share some similarities in paste and surface finish with Prado Phase materials from Tula, espe­cially Clara Luz Negro Esgrafiado (Cobean 1990: 104-118). Co bean ( 1990:91, 116) discusses

the relationship between these vessels and exam­ples farther to the north in the Bajfo region, as does Lopez Perez and Nicolas Careta (2005) for incised wares from Teotihuacan. In this regard, the small incised jars from Non-Grid 4 are highly similar to Epiclassic types from sites farther to the north in the Bajfo,particularly Garita Black-Brown (Pomedio 2009; Saint-Charles and Enriquez 2006; Snarkis 1985), as well as other nearby types (see Braniff 1998). 
Discussion: Macro and 
Microlevel Dimensions of Ritual 

If the earliest AMS range (A.D. 550--660, intercept 
A.D. 610) dates the platform's construction and the initial ceremonial practices at the site, the first rit­uals at Non-Grid 4 apparently did not involve human sacrifice. Communities during this time probably began exploiting the marshland setting for aquatic resources and, perhaps, agriculture. The shrine was located near freshwater springs that fed the lagoon. Residents likely began ritual practices for a more basic reason than politics: to supplicate, petition, and repay deities associated with rain, water, and fertil­ity. This interpretation is reinforced by the presence of effigies of Tlaloc, god of rain, a deity who appeared in the cosmological repertoire for both earlier and later peoples in central Mexico (e.g., Arnold 1999; Broda 1971; Duran 1971; Motolinfa 1903; Pasztory 1974; Sahagun 195 1). 
This time span overlaps with the late Metepec phase (Classic period) at Teotihuacan, a site only 15 km away. The Metepec phase is the final period before Teotihuacan's collapse between A.D. 600 andA.D.650 (Cowgill 1996; Manzanilla2001). Yet the ceramics are notably distinct from Metepec pot­tery. Stylistically, we associate these ceramics with Epiclassic period types, although the shrine lacks typical Coyotlatelco Red-on-Buff pottery. It is pos­sible that the shrine's construction occurred during an earlier facet of the Epiclassic period. Cobean (1 990) for example, divides the Epiclassic at Tula between the Prado Phase (ca. A.D. 700-800) and the Corral Phase (ca. A.D. 800-900). The Prado phase has no Coyotlatelco types but has incised wares, whereas Coyotlatelco is common during the Corral Phase. Pina Chan (1967: 147) proposed two Epiclassic phases, "one that is directly associated with the final years of Teotihuacan (ca. A.D. 
650-800), and another derived from the earlier period dating A.D. 800-1000." Sanders (1986, 1989, 2006) also argued for the separation of the Epiclassic period into earlier (Oxtoticpac) and later (Xometla) facets (see also God and Obermayer 1986; Hicks and Nicholson 1964). Using data at a regional scale, Crider (20 I I) documented earlier and later facets of the Epiclassic period in the Basin of Mexico. 
This shrine possibly was constructed during or soon after the collapse of Teotihuacan's political
; economy, when the city was the site of mass­destruction and burning (Cowgill I997; Pina Chan 1967). However, the human sacrifices postdate Teotihuacan's decline, which suggests conflict and ritual violence after the urban center's demise. The possible position of the northern lakes region between developing political spheres (see Garcia Chavez 2004; Garcia Chavez and Martinez Y rizar 2006; Garcia Chavez et al. 2006) and the richness of the local wetland environment during a time of resource stress may have increased the area's attrac­tiveness to emerging leaders and their followers. Conflict, immigration, the establishment of new settlements, and the political economy intercon­nected during the Epiclassic (e.g., Beekman and Christensen 2003; Blanton 1973; Crider et al . 2007 ; Manzanilla 2005; Parsons et al . 2008). Even though human sacrifice was already practiced in central Mexico, especially at Classic period Teotihuacan , it is possible that new arrivals to the basin main­tained similar cultural practices. Classic period sites in the north suggest that warfare and sacrifice were components of political relations (e.g., Fournier and Vargas Sanders 2002; Hers 2010; Kelly 1978; Pickering 1985; Pijoan Aguade and Mansilla Lory 1997). A fascinating mythological episode in the Anales de Cuauhtitlan links conflict and sacrifice in the region of Xaltocan with the immigration of people from the north, specifically from Tollan. This source describes the breakdown of political authority at Tollan, especially surrounding the god­king Quetzalcoatl, and the movement of political competitors to the northern basin (see also Fournier and Vargas Sanders 2002:49). Significantly these mythological events occurred near Nextlalpan, a town north of Xaltocan:

lan. At this time, too, was the beginning of the 
war that the devil Yaotl started. The Toltecs

were engaged [in battle] at a place called Next­lalpan. And when they had taken captives, human sacrifice also got started, as Toltecs sacrificed their prisoners. Among them and in their midst the devil Yaotl followed along. Right on the spot he kept inciting them to make human sacrifices.And then, too, he started and began the practice of flaying humans [Bier­horst 1992:40]. 
Locating Tollan itself has plagued archaeolo­gists, and both Tula and Teotihuacan have been considered possible candidates (e.g., Kowalski and Kristan-Graham 2007). Indeed , determining who the sacrificial victims were and who specifically undertook the sacrifices is difficult, requiring addi­tional isotopic and genetic studies. Nevertheless, it is possible that the practice of human sacrifice here was connected to broader patterns of politics and ritual practice during the Epiclassic in central Mex­ico . Fournier and Vargas Sanders (2002:49-50), for instance, describe remarkably similar sacrifi­cial deposits that date to the Epiclassic period at Chapantongo in the Tula region, north of the Xal­tocan lake zone. The crania of 12 individuals were recovered from an irregularly constructed altar at the site. Similar to the materials from Non-Grid 4, these crania were associated with cervical vertebra and finger bones (as well as foot bones). The inte­gration of human sacrifice into the rituals at Non­Grid 4 might represent the active reworking of ritual practices and symbolic acts from traditions of multiple groups, including both relatively new immigrants and groups with historical connections to Teotihuacan. 
These interpretations focus on macrolevel con­ditions in the political and social landscape. Archaeobotanical data elucidate more microlevel dimensions of ritual practice. They suggest that rit­ual practitioners burned wood and left offerings of food and flowers . Fifty-two archaeobotanical sam-

cobs, cupules, or grain fragments (Morehart 2009). Although the lagoon was converted into a system of chinampas during the Postclassic period, no relict or buried fields were found in excavations at Non­Grid 4, although they were common elsewhere (Morehart 2010). Moreover, unlike swidden farm­ing, chinamperos do not bum fields between plant­ings (see Sanders 1957). Thus, these maize remains likely do not represent intrusive burned maize from later chinampa farming. Lastly, no evidence for domestic or storage activities was documented. The maize remains are likely the result of the ritual burn­ing and offering of food to deities, a common prac­tice in Mesoamerica (Morehart and Butler 2010.) 
Twenty pollen samples were processed from the shrine, including samples from almost every exca­vation level ofElON4, the unit containing the buri­als. Many pollen remains reflect regional environmental conditions, particularly pine. How­ever, some pollen remains appear to reflect the in ten­tional deposition of flowers. One hundred percent of the samples contained Cheno-Am pollen, attrib­utable either to Chenopodiaceae or Amaranthaceae. Cheno-Am pollen is usually evidence of local or regional vegetation. Seventy percent of samples (n 

= 
14), however, contained Cheno-Am pollen in aggregate clusters, which suggests they are rem­nants of anthers. An even greater concentration of Compositae pollen was identified to the genus Tagetes (Figure I 0). Tagetes sp. pollen was docu­mented in 80 percent of the samples (n 16),includ­

ing in all but the shallowest and deepest levels of ElON4. Despite the high ubiquity of Tagetes pollen in El ON4, its concentration is highest in levels asso­ciated with Burial I (Level 4: 2.91 ; Level 5: 4.2) and, especially, Burial 2 (Level 8: 28.5) compared to other levels (e.g., Level 3: O; Level 6: .77; Level 7: 3; Level

dard component of ritual practices for every month of the annual cycle (see Sahagun's [1951] descrip­tions of monthly feasts). They were used as offer­ings and as ornaments that adorned priests, idols, and sacrificial victims. In Mesoamerica, flowers were part of a symbolic complex associated with life, death, the soul, the heart, food, and fire (e.g., Heydan 1985; Hill I 992; Morehart 2011). Hill ( 1992: 127) writes that "the Flower World is the place where the spiritual aspects of living things are found." 
Flowers were not only offerings but also con­tributed significantly to the experience of ritual by enhancing sight, smell, and touch. These phenom­enal aspects of flowers made them effective as arti­facts of the ritual process: 
f offer flowers ... I thread a flower ... I form them to be extending, uneven, rounded, round bouquets of flowers. I make a flowernecklace, a flower garland, a paper of flowers, a bouquet, a flower shield ... I smell them . I cause one to smell something ... I offer flowers to one ... I clothe him in flowers ... I continue to cover him with flowers . I destroy one with flowers [Sahagun 1963:214-215]. 
The burning of incense also contributed to rit­ual experience. Incense burners were one of the most common artifacts, both ladle censers and standing braziers. No actual incense was found, but large amounts of pine charcoal were associated with smashed censers. Ninety-six percent of all the archaeobotanical samples contained pine charcoal (Morehart 2009). Pine was one of the most cere­monially significant woods in ancient Mesoamer­ica (Morehart et al. 2005). An important deity of the Otomf, said to be present at Xaltocan at least by the Postclassic, was uniquely associated with pine. This deity, Otonteuctli, was a god of fire and was associated with dead warriors (Carrasco Pizana 1950:138-141; Sahagun 1961:181). During the feast in his honor, ritual practitioners raised a pole made of pine and gave offerings to the four cardi­nal directions, using the pole as a center reference. As with incense and flowers, burning pine was a standard component of ritual practices undertaken in diverse rites and social contexts (Morehart et al. 2005; Sahagun 1951). Ritual practitioners burned pine as torches, as kindling in incense burners , and as actual incense. The resin bums rapidly, but the 

abundant smoke is highly fragrant, contributing to rituals' corporeal experience. 
Considering the archaeobotanical evidence for food and floral offerings enriches our understand­ing of the range of activities undertaken at the shrine. The death rites of sacrificial victims were likely structured and choreographed performances (see Boone 2007). Victims were killed. They were decapitated. Their body parts may have been deposited into the surrounding waters. Finally, their heads were lined up facing east, toward the rising sun, and buried. Throughout this ordeal, incense and wood burned. Food was offered. Flowers were deposited. In many areas ofMesoamerica, incense, smoke, maize, and flowers were bound in a sym­bolic complex to both feed and communicate with spiritual entities (e.g., Arnold 1999; Hill 1992; Houston and Taube 2000; Morehart et al. 2005). Through this process, the dead may have been rit­ually integrated into this complex, thereby becom­ing offerings and, perhaps, food for deities. 
Conclusion 

This article sheds light on the dynamism of the Epiclassic period at both macro and micro scales. The data from Non-Grid 4 indicate rituals either during or after the collapse of the Teotihuacan state. Following Teotihuacan's decline, ritual practition­ers in Lake Xaltocan integrated human sacrifice into their repertoire of practices. At least 31 indi­viduals were sacrificed. The heads of I 3 were lined up facing east. The remaining individuals are also represented by cranial bones and were likely deposited in a similar fashion. Both AMS and ceramic data point to an Epiclassic chronology for these practices at the shrine. Rituals were tied to regional processes, but they were fundamentally local phenomena. Ritual experience had both cor­poreal and spiritual dimensions. In addition to humans, ritual practitioners made offerings of food, flowers , and incense. 
During periods of political and social transfor­mation, ritual can offer a means by which people make sense of their world and can provide a resource for those seeking political power. Not long after the beginning of human sacrifice at the shrine, however, ritual here ended until the Postclassic period when chinampa farmers may have returned to the site to undertake agricultural rites (Morehart

20 I 0). The significance of this termination is unclear, but it likely involved both regional and local processes. Regionally, the political landscape transformed by the late Epiclassic and Early Post­classic, and city-states became well established (Crider 20 11 :470; Diehl and Berlo 1989; Healan 
1989; Hirth 1995). Rituals may have been redi­rected toward these new political entities. Many small Epiclassic communities in the area were abandoned and do not have subsequent Postclas­sic occupations (Brumfiel 2005b; Morehart 2009; Parsons et al. 2008). The cessation of ritual at the shrine possibly was connected to systemic sociopo­litical transformations, reinforcing the fact that local practices were connected to broader conditions in the fabric of society.

Notes 

I. Throughout this article, we employ Coyotlatelco to refer specifically to the Red-on-Buff, decorated pottery type by which it was originally defined , and we use the "Epiclassic" to refer to the period of time during which Coyotlatelco pottery came into use. 
2. 
John Milhauser conducted X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis of a sample of the fill. Although it has some "noise," the sample shared several peaks in common with pure cal­cium carbonate (see Morehart 2009: 144-145). 

3. 
lt was possible to identify additional remains as female and juvenile. They are not included in the MN! estimate given the fragmented nature of the assemblage (Meza Penaloza 2010). 

4. 
Lycopodium tablets with standard spore concentrations were added to each sample. Grains were counted until 200 were counted for each sample. Pollen data are expressed as the ratio of pollen grains counts to Lycopodium spore counts in a slide.
