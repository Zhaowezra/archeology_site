ECKIXIL: UNDERSTANDING THE CLASSIC TO POSTCLASSIC 
SURVIVA L AND TR ANSFORMATION OF A PETEN MAYA VILLAGE 

Kevin R. Schwarz 
This study uses architectural and activity area analyses to examine the Classic-Postclassic transition and the resulting Postclassic-Early Historic (A.D. i000-i697) Maya society in the Peten Lakes region of Guatemala. The research combines a detailed temporal comparison of architectural styles and an analysis of changing architecture as the restructuring of everyday social action. The methods have significance beyond Maya studies in addressing questions of cultural continuity or in-migration. Archaeological data from recent excavations, including new radiocarbon dates, document the intensive settlement of the Quexil islands in the Terminal Classic period (A.D. 800-1000) and its occupation thereafter. Architectural evidence from the Quexil islands and other Pe ten Lakes sites indicates a mosaic pattern of change, reflecting to varying extents Classic-Postclassic continuity and external contacts, with differences 
among sites rather than the complete replace­ment ofpopulations. Evidence of the later incorporation of this small village, known ethnohistorically as "Eckixil," in the Late Postclassic-Early Historic itza polity, demonstrates a strong linkage with the political core, illustrating the political complexity of this hinterland region. 
Este estudio utiliza Los andlisis arquitectonicos y de dreas de actividad para examinar la transicion entre el Clasico y el Post­cldsico y la resultante sociedad Maya def Postclasico Tard(o-Historico Temprano ( iOOO-i 697 d.

La investigacion combina una comparacion temporal detallada de los estilos arquiteclonicos y un andlisis de la arquitectura cambiante como accion social diaria de la reestructuracion. La metodolog(a ha signijicado mds alld de estudios Mayas en el tratamiento de las cuestiones de la continuidad cultural o en la in-migracion. Los datos arqueologicos de excavaciones recientes, incluyendo nuevas fechas del radiocarbono, documentan el asentamiento intensivo de las Islas Quexiles en el perfodo Cldsico Terminal (800-1000 d.

La evidencia arquitec16nica de las Islas def Lago Quexil y otros sitios de la region de las lagos de Peten indica un patron mosaico de cam­bio, reflejando hasta cierto punto la continuidad y contactos externos durante la transici6n def Cldsico al Postcldsico, con diferencias entres sitios. La incorporacion de esta aldea pequefia, conocida etnohistoricamente como "Eckixil", en la unidad sociopo/£tica ltzd Postcldsico-Historico Temprano, demuestra la integraci6n fuerte con la base poUtica, ilustrando la com­plejidad polftica de esta region rural.

he Spanish clerics and soldiers who chron­icled the conquest of the Peten ltza in A.D. 1697 also visited the island settlement known as "Eckixil" (Villagutierre 1983 [1701]:272) and brief accounts of the village exist, including its abandonment. The historian Grant Jones (1998: 17) locates this settlement in the Lake Quexil Basin, Guatemala, and archaeological evidence indicates that two islands there were primarily occupied from the Terminal Classic (A.D 800-1000) to Early His­toric periods (AD. 1525-1697) (Chase 1983; Rice and Rice 1990: 141 ). Recent research in the Peten Lakes region (Figures I and 2) has used archaeol­ogy and the direct historical method to investigate the Postclassic society that emerged in lacustrine island and peninsular settings, following the demise of the Classic Maya (Pugh 2003; Rice and Rice 2005; Rice et al. 1998; Schwarz 2003, 2004). This paper builds on that research and addresses the ques­tion of the local continuity of occupation and inter­nal cultural transformation versus hypotheses of in-migration of Epiclassic populations, into El Peten in the late Late and Terminal Classic periods (ca. 
A.D. 750-1000) and the resulting societies of the Postclassic (A.D. 1000-1525) and Early Historic periods.

ulations appear to have been relatively stable while some aspects of elite culture were reconfigured after the Terminal Classic period. Also, changes occurred on regional scales and differences existed in the timing of change in different regions (Demarest et al. 2004:547-550). 
For example, the Petexbatun region experienced an early, rapid, and more pronounced political and population decline during the late Late Classic period (post-A.D. 750), in places leading to near abandonment. Demarest (2004: 104-110) attributes the Petexbatun collapse to interpolity warfare, events that resulted in very limited Terminal Clas­sic and Postclassic populations. In the nearby Peten Lakes region, however, Rice and Rice (2004: 125-127) posit that political change, mod­erate population declines, shifts of settlement loca­tion, and in-and out-migration during the Terminal Classic period are symptomatic of the decline of Classic society, but these changes also are impli­cated in the beginnings of Postclassic developments in polity and society. This paper presents a fine­grained analysis that focuses on the Quexil Islands and other transitional sites in the western Lake Peten Itza Basin, and indicates even more localized community-level responses to change than previ­ously had been known. 
I use architecture to examine the question of local continuity or in-migration, because of the shrines, bench structures, and altars that charac­terize the post-A.D. 750 period in Peten archaeol­ogy. Widespread adoption of certain architectural forms, particularly C-shaped benches (Figure 3), has been hypothesized to be evidence of in­migration of Epiclassic groups (Fox 1987:62-86; Rice 1986, 1988; Rice and Rice 2004; Tourtellot l 988a; Webster 2002). 
Architectural evidence collected from the Quexil Islands and compared with other Peten Lakes sites, however, suggests a localized mosaic pattern of change, reflecting to varying extents, Classic to Postclassic continuity and external con­tacts, with differences among sites. This paper begins by discussing various scholars' approaches toward analyzing the roles of architecture in soci­ety to identify those useful for investigating the research problem. 
Archaeologists and other scholars have approached domestic and public architecture from multiple theoretical perspectives, including struc­turalism (Glassie 1975; Kent 1984), structuration and practice theory (Bourdieu 1977; Giddens 1984; Robin 1999; Schwarz 2004 ), functional approaches (Flannery 1976; McGuire and Schiffer 1983), and

interpretive approaches, such as phenomenology (Andres 2005:171-239;Buchli 1999;Moore 1996, 2004). 
For example, many Mesoamerican archaeolo­gists have used domestic architecture to explore social organization, usually by assessing structure function(Hendon 1987, 199l ;Inomata 1995;John­ston and Gonlin 1998:150-154; Manzanilla 1996) and by ethnographic analogy (Fox and Cook 1996; Joyce and Gillespie 2000; Plunket and Urufiuela 2002:31; Tourtellot 1988b ). It has been difficult to firmly identify families or kin groups in the archae­ological record though (Johnston and Gonlin 1998: 152-154; Wilk and Rathje 1982), so the iden­tification of co-resident households often has been the goal instead (Gonlin 1994; Santley and Hirth 1993; Wilk and Ashmore 1988). Gonlin (1993:9) advises that archaeologists should "isolate repeti: tive architectural and artifactual assemblages repeated over a settlement that represent the min­imal cooperative and co-residential unit" to iden­tify remains of households. She provides specific material indicators of households, which were used to infer the presence and characteristics of house­holds at the Quexil Islands (Schwarz 2004:52-53, 557-561). 
Another approach uses architecture to investi­gate demographic (Culbert and Rice 1990), eco­nomic (Abrams 1994; Adams and Jones 1981; McAnany and Isaac 1989; Manzanilla and Barba 1990; Perez 2006), and political processes in soci­ety (Andres 2005:240-248; Christie 2003; de Montmollin 1989; Freter 1994; Harrison 2001; Marcus 1993). Domestic architecture often is con­ceived of as a proxy useful to address abstract soci­etal processes. Archaeologists have utilized architecture to address rural political and economic complexity (Iannone and Connell 2003; Schwartz and Falconer 1994) and the position of common­ers in society (Lohse and Valdez 2004). Recent studies, for example among the Late Classic Maya 
(Connell 2003), have found greater complexity in rural regions of early state societies, including more varied linkages between core settlements, minor centers, and hinterlands, than previously thought. In this vein, the Quexil Islands should not be con­sidered to be a commoner or rural community in an unproblematic fashion, despite its small size (only 23 structures exist on the two islands) and unimposing architecture. The former presence of 
a stela and close integration with the Late Post­
classic capital, Tajltza, demonstrate connections 
with elite culture, as discussed below. 
A third approach deals with how the forms and arrangements of structures in civic-ceremonial and residential architecture reflects ideological and cul­tural precepts (Ashmore 1991, 1992; Ashmore and Sabloff 2002; Freidel et al. 1993; Miller 1998; Noble 1999; Plank 2004; Tate 1992). For the Clas­sic Maya, the above described approach includes the identification of Plaza Plans (Becker 1982, 1999; Jones 1969), "group patterns" of buildings at Tikal (Becker 2003:253), some of which predict locations of burials. Archaeologists also used ethno­graphic analogy to infer that benches, altars (Gille­spie 1999:234-240; Welsh 1988: 186-197), and shrines (Chase and Chase 1994; McAnany 1995: 100-103) were utilized for ancestor venera­tion in Classic domestic settings. Comparison of Classic and Postclassic architectural groups, includ­ing the placement and characteristics of burials and offerings, provides information on how ritual activ­ity was maintained or changed through time 
(Andres and Pyburn 2004:406-415). Evidence for ritual behavior is compared against historic accounts. 
Cross-culturally, architectural forms mark cul­tural identity and ethnicity (Aldenderfer 1993; Bur­ley et al. 1992; Glassie 1975; Jones 1997; Shennan 1989). Archaeological analyses of households are able to "define the range of variability that charac­terizes architectural patterns." Patterning that likely corresponded to cultural or ethnic difference includes the numbers and sizes of structures, their form and composition, and use of space and arti­facts associated with house structures and facilities (Aldenderfer and Stanish 1993:5-6). Evaluating the overall architectural style or patterning is also advantageous because these houses are non­portable. Architectural style more likely reflects the cultural identity of residential populations, as opposed, for example, to ceramic style, which can reflect trade. 
Architecture creates marked divisions of social space (Hillier and Hanson 1984; Kent 1990), which influence human behavior and interaction, some­times subtly. Built forms of architecture are also part of the structuring of everyday social action (Bourdieu 1977; Giddens 1984:118-131). Giddens identifies zoning of social space as an important

mediator of interaction: i.e., the division of the house into a front region, a facade-oriented zone where household members engage in social display of statuses and receive visitors, and the back region, where tasks of household subsistence are per­formed. When society changes we can expect the stage on which much social interaction occurs, the houses themselves (Giddens 1984:119-125; Kent 
l 984 ), to be modified by their builders and occu­pants to adjust to the new social order (Berman J 994: 238-245). 
Connecting Theory and Methods 
I use a multifaceted architectural analysis because the complexity of architecture requires a holistic examination that grapples with architecture's mul­tiple roles in society. Application of multiple the­oretical approaches and methods in a single study mirrors trends present in recent archaeological stud­ies of architecture (Andres 2005; Moore 2004; Noble 1999). The theoretical approaches that I have found to be relevant to my work involve examin­ing the use of architecture to, alternatively, mark ethnic identity (Aldenderfer 1993; Burley et al. 1992; Glassie 1975), and/or to create marked divi­sions of social spaces (Giddens 1984; Kent 1984). 
The examination of architecture as a marker for ethnicity and in-migration involves detailed com­paiisons of architectural form, which were origi­nally carried out as an architectural grammar analysis (Glassie 1975; Schwarz 2004:337-550) for an architectural corpus of 124 structures from 25 structure groups at six Peten Lakes sites and at Tikal and Seibal. In the interest of limited space, I cannot fully describe this formal comparison in this article; instead, I present an informal compar­ison of architectural variability, particularly as it applies to structure grouping and bench morphol­ogy. A complete description of architectural vari­ability and comparison of both Classic and Postclassic architecture provides the basis for the assessment of local continuity or the use of a new architectural style as the result of the arrival of immigrants. That is, the detailed comparison iden­tifies whether Classic and Postclassic architectural patterning displays temporal continuity between the study sites, which would suggest cultural con­tinuity, or disjunction, which would suggest in­migration of new groups with new architectural styles. 
It is expected that when immigrants establish a settlement or house in a new region, they would, if possible, reestablish their former pattern of archi­tecture (Glassie 1975:57-77), in this case sup­planting the existing style. A close analytical comparison of architecture in the destination region and at the putative origin site can identify the degree of similarity or difference of architectural pattern­ing, and thus the likelihood of the migration sce­nario. 
The excavation of 14 structures on the two Quexil Islands (Schwarz 2004) provides a much needed comparison of a small site with previous Terminal Classic and Postclassic investigations that have mostly concentrated on larger sites with more monumental architecture (Chase 1983; Pugh 2001; Tourtellot 1988a; Wiirster 2000). As described below, the field methods of broad-area clearance of structures and surrounding spaces and limited test pitting provide information on the arrangement of architectural forms (walls, benches, and altars) and on primary (e.g., in situ) artifact deposits, which are useful for inferring the uses to which individ­ual architecture spaces were put and the overall organization of space. 
This study of activity areas has been paired with Giddens's (1984) and Kent's (1984) methods for analyzing segmentation in the zoning of front and back regions. That is, within a cultural context, architecture and cues provided by architecture are important mediators of human behavior and social interaction. The research thus combines a detailed temporal analysis of architectural styles and an analysis of changing architecture as restructuring everyday social action via its role in mediating behavior. The methods have significance beyond Maya studies in addressing questions of cultural continuity or in-migration. 
Additionally, this paper necessarily includes strands of other approaches reviewed above. I dis­cuss Late Classic to Postclassic shifts in signatures of households, and continuity and change in the form, arrangement, and use of shrines, benches, and altars. I also discuss the effects of political change on Postclassic communities. What follows is the cultural background, methodology, description of excavations, architectural and activity area analy­ses of the Quexil Islands, and comparisons with nearby Peten Lakes sites.

Architectural History of Central Peten from the Late Classic to Late Postclassic Periods 
Various investigators hypothesize that during the late Late Classic period (ca. A.D. 750-800) settle­ment change and warfare occurred as the cause or result of in-migration (Demarest et al. 1997; Web­ster 2002). Some scenarios posit that immigrant populations arrived from Seibal (Thompson 1970; Tourtellot 1988a), the Petexbarun (Rice and Rice 2004; Webster 2002) or the Guatemala Highlands (Fox 1980, 1987; Ichon et al. 1980). In the Peten Lakes region, evidence of a population surge may coincide with the appearance of Postclassic archi­tectural forms (Rice et al. 1998:244). Late Classic period (AD. 600-800) houses typically are located in formal plaza-centered quadrangular groups with 4+ structures per group (Rice and Puleston 1981: 131 ). Often, structures face one another across a single plaza, and are aligned with the car­dinal directions (Rice 1988:230-237). Plaza groups may stand alone, though multiple plazas occa­sionally form larger complexes. Late Classic set­tlement is distributed broadly across the landscape. 
Becker (1971, 1982) identified formal Plaza 
Plans at Tikal. Plaza Plan 2 is characterized by a burial shrine located on the eastern side of the plaza (Figure 4 ). Some eastern shrines stand on a high terraced platform that is relatively tall and square in comparison to other buildings in the group 
(Becker 2004: 128). Or the shrine may be a low plat­form, which is small and close to square in plan. Plaza Plan 2 shrines have width/length ratios of greater than .70 (Becker 2003:259). Their floors often have evidence of ritual burning. Burials are placed, usually on axis, in front of the shrine, within the plaza beneath a stairway, or underneath the shrine. Non-axial burials may be found associated with rectangular residential structures on non-east sides of the plaza. 
A related tenn, east structure focused group, is adopted here for groups in which building arrange­ments and morphologies are similar (although not always identical) indicating eastern shrines were probably present, but burial evidence was not sought or the east structure was looted. East struc­ture focused groups exist at sites in Peten and beyond, including at Caracol, Belize (Chase and Chase 1994:53-54). At Caracol, 60 percent of structure groups between two causeways are east

structure focused. East structure focused groups are also found in palace settings (Chase and Chase 2001:108). Plaza Plan 4 at Tikal comprises residential groups formed by the placement of rectilinear res­. idential structures around a plaza with a small plat­

form in the center. Excavation of several such central platforms located human skulls interred in cache vessels, which Becker (2003:263-264) describes as "trophy heads." 
Many east structure focused groups exist around Lake Peten Itza (Figures 1-2), including at Tayasal, Cenote, Michoacan, Motul de San Jose (MSJ), and at secondary sites near MSJ (Moriarty 2004:7-12 ). MSJ and Tayasal have east structure focused groups that demonstrate Classic to Postclassic continuity of use. For example, Foias et al. (2000:40) describe Group D at MSJ as a Plaza Plan 2 (Figure 5). The eastern structure is an elevated shrine that was looted, although a tomb with fragmentary bones was documented in the trench. An L-shaped range structure occupies the southern and western sides of the plaza group. Excavations in the southern part of the L-shaped structure (Figure 5) demonstrate that it was occupied during the Late Classic period and Terminal Classic and Early Postclassic ceram­ics were discovered in the humus layer (Foias and Sanchez 1999:47). Also, two masonry column bases front the partially excavated building. A C­shaped bench, adorned by armrests at the comers, is at the back of the building (Figure 6a). The col­umn bases suggest to Alvarez et al. (2001:49-50) construction in a typically Postclassic style and that possibly the structure served an administrative

rather than residential function. 
Late Classic benches in Peten are generally straight-line forms (but notice the discussion below), higherthan later benches, and placed at the rear of the building, such as the examples from Tikal illustrated in this article (Figure 3a and 6b). In more substantial buildings, benches often are screened from the plaza by a masonry wall and have frontal patios. Smith (1962:228) and Adams (1974:287) wrote that benches were sleeping plat­forms, whileWauchope (1938:126-127)suggested them to be seats. Harrison (1970:172-173) inferred that some benches in palace rooms at Tikal's Cen­tral Acropolis were beds and some were thrones, based on their forms and dimensions. 
By the late Late Classic period, what was described as "non-Classic" or "non-Peten" Maya influence entered the Pasion region (Sabloff 1973:125) and Guatemalan Highlands (Fox 1980, 1987; Ichon et al. 1980). Rectangular, presumably open-fronted structures with low, broad C-shaped benches, suggested to be residential, first appear during the Tepejilote phase (A.D. 600/650-770) at Seibal (Tourtellot and Gonzalez 2004:73) (Figure 3b). 
However, open-fronted bench structures known as presentation palaces also occur in civic­ceremonial settings, including in the Petexbatun region. At Dos Pilas, one sits on the edge of an open plaza (near a pyramidal temple). N5-3/3A has a hieroglyphic throne and C-shaped bench, and prob­ably had a perishable roof but lacked walls (Demarest et al. 2003:132) (Figure 3c).The above described arrangement would have allowed for reception of visitors, royal viewing of ceremonies (Valdes 2001: 151-152), and, possibly, public view­ing from the nearby plaza. 
Some Maya elite structures, with examples at Tikal, Uxmal, Copan, and elsewhere, have a tri­partite design. A central room often has a bench (at Copan U-shaped or L-shaped benches are noted) and two flanking rooms used for storage, sleeping, and food preparation, among other uses. Christie (2003:310-3 11) cites archaeological and epi-

graphic evidence that the commanding position of authority (such as the head of household or lineage) was represented in the central room, which in royal contexts was epitomized as a throne (see below). At Copan, Noble (1999: 1-29) indicates that benches in subroyal residences also projected sociopolitical authority, although she interprets them to be salient in factional competition rather than as a direct challenge to royal authority. Har­rison ( 1970: 158) identifies U-shaped and L-shaped benches in palaces at the Tikal Central Acropolis, a do Chase and Chase (2001: 109) at Caracol. 
Thrones, which are elaborate masonry benches, are found at civic-ceremonial centers in the South­ern Maya Lowlands. Some sit atop temple pyra­mids or in palaces, which generally have masonry walls and central doorways that partly shielded the interiors while others are in more visible plaza­level locations. Some are painted in polychrome iconography and/or are carved. Masonry benches that have C-shaped backs with armrests are found at Tikal that date as early as the Late Preclassic (Harrison 2003:86-94; Valdes 2001:154-156). 
C-shaped bench structures (Figure 3d and 6c) increase in frequency from the Tepejilote phase to the Tepejilote/Bayal transition at Seibal. Tourtellot ( l 988a:258-260) suggested that C-shaped archi­tectural forms demonstrate "Putun or ltza ethnic ties between the Usumacinta-Pasi6n Valley and both Northern Yucatan .... and Highland Guatemala," presumably including the Peten Lakes region. Rice (1986:333-337; 1988:234-243) states that Seibal or the Guatemala Highlands were likely origin points for the migrants into the Peten Lakes region, and he ties C-shaped and L-shaped bench forms to these migrants. Webster (2002:264) and Rice and Rice (2004: I 32) infer that following the Petex­batun Wars certain people migrated from that region to the Peten Lakes region. At Michoacan (Figure 2), east of Lake Quexil, late Late Classic or Terminal Classic structures have benches (Fig­ure 3e) similar to Postclassic forms but in large quadrangular plaza groups 
Burial patterns also shift. Tepejilote burials occur mainly in range structures that enclose the plaza (often in eastern locations) while in the tran­sition to and during the Bayal phase, most burials occur in or around low, square "Class C" shrines, in the centers of plazas (Tourtellot l 988a:256-260). Gonzalez (1998:402-404) and Tourtellot and Gonzalez (2004) inferred that changes in house design at Seibal resulted from internal develop­ment and innovation rather than from a hypothet­ical migratory group. Ringle et al. (1998) hypothesize that Seibal, Chichen Itza, and other sites participated in an Epiclassic elite cult network that featured trade, pilgrimages, common symbol systems, and material culture styles, but not wide­spread immigration. They associate the spread of C-shaped building plans, other architectural forms, certain iconography, and Fine Orange and Plumbate ceramics with this cult network. 
By the Postclassic period, smaller, compact set­tlements emerged on islands, peninsulas, or other defensible points, which are restricted settings. Inland sites suffered reductions in numbers of occu­pied structures or abandonment. The Quexil Islands are a smaller version of the island settlements, or petenes, all of which were religiously powerful places where censer ritual was carried out, as dis­cussed below. Larger Postclassic settlements include Tajltza, also known as Nojpeten (modem Flores Island) (Jones et al. I 981), Topoxte (Bullard 1970; Wtirster 2000), and the peninsular site of Zacpeten (Pugh 2001, 2002, 2003). Postclassic island sites are also present in lakes in Belize (Mas­son 1997) and Mexico (Alexander 2005). 
Houses at islands or in other restricted settings in the Peten Lakes region generally consist of rec­tangular masonry substructures of 10-60 cm in height with unwalled fronts. The rear portions are enclosed by C-shaped, I-shaped, or L-shaped benches, often backed by a masonry wall. The benches are not as wide as those at Seibal but often are a little taller. Also characteristic of islands and other restricted settings is that larger houses, thought to have been inhabited by higher status people, are found on elevated areas and are flanked by smaller houses (Rice 1988:233-237). 
Recent Field Investigations and 
Regional Comparisons 

Excavations in the Quexil-Petenxil Basins in 2001 and regional comparisons allow for interpretations of household and community change. The chronol­ogy of the Quexil Islands was established by sur­vey (Chase 1983) and test pitting (Rice and Rice 1980, 1982; Rice and Rice 1990). Occupation occurred mainly during the Terminal Classic, Post-

classic, and Early Historic periods, with scattered evidence of inhabitancy earlier. All of the exca­vated structures had Terminal Classic and/or Post­classic ceramics on occupation floors and/or in building fill, as detailed in Schwarz (2004 ). 
The eastern and western Quexil Islands have a total of 23 structures (Figures 7 and 8). Fourteen of these structures were partially excavated, and three Late Classic structures were excavated in the Petenxil Basin (a total of 859 m2). The investiga­tion strategy involved broad, clearing excavations through humus (level 1) and collapse debris (level 2) to expose living surfaces (floors), architectural remnants (benches and wall footings) (level 3), and to search out evidence of activity areas. Excavation occurred within 1-m grid units until the final occu­pation floor and architectural units were exposed. Because Peten Postclassic structures are limited in size and scale and usually lack deep stratigraphy associated with multiple rebuilding episodes, the above-mentioned excavation techniques capture most Postclassic activity associated with a partic­ular locale. 
Artifacts recovered on floor, bench, and off­structure locations were analyzed as three major classes of finds: in situ artifacts, provisional dis­cards, and secondary discards. In situ artifacts found in floor contexts are primarily censers and other ritual artifacts, although some artifacts were likely in situ on floors at Q20 and in front of Q2 l (as described below). Provisional discards (Hay­den and Cannon 1984:131-134) were found next to walls, in comers of structures (e.g., Q2), and around structures (Killion 1990: 127; Robin 1999:99-135). Secondary discards were deposited in middens (e.g., Operation Q19A) and as de facto refuse on or near structures after abandonment (Q5, Ql l, parts of Q21) (Joyce and Johannessen 1993: 142-150).

The investigations of the Quexil Islands (Fig­ures 7 and 8) are described elsewhere (Schwarz 2004). Analyses included ethnohistoric and ethno­

; graphic comparisons, an architectural grammar, access analysis, metrical analysis, and a structural­functional analysis, all aimed at understanding the regional architectural transition. Here I highlight the chronology and affiliation of the Quexil Islands occupation, and discuss the regional architectural transformation and political context in the Termi­nal Classic and thereafter. Ceramics identified below are types described in regional ceramic stud­ies (e.g., Cecil 2001; Chase and Chase 1983; Rice 1987). 
Site Chronology and Context 
The excavations demonstrate that the Quexil Islands were intensively settled in the Terminal Classic period. The inference is supported by analy­sis of a stratified midden and burial (Figure 9) on the eastern island and abundant Terminal Classic ceramics, recovered from both islands. 
The midden demonstrates the accumulation of early Terminal Classic through Early Historic period debris downslope of structures Q 18-Q 19 on the eastern island, including fragmentary domes­tic ceramics, censer sherds, animal bone, broken lithic tools, and debitage (Schwarz 2004:240-248). The basal cultural level also consisted of an adult female burial with grave goods, including a Jato Black-on-Gray tripod plate placed over the cra­nium. Prudence Rice dates the plate to the early Ter­minal Classic period (A.D. 800-900) (personal communication, 2002). A perinate was buried in a

Chilo Unslipped olla within the midden. Its femur has a radiocarbon age of 1088 ± 51, with a cali­brated 2a date range of A.D. 800-1030 (Table 1 ), the Terminal Classic or early Early Postclassic. 
On the western island, wood charcoal was AMS dated that originated from a hearth on the bench of structure Q2 (Feature 2) (Table 1). The charcoal sample has a radiocarbon age of 985 ± 50, with a calibrated 2a date range of A.D. 960-1180, or the Terminal Classic or Early Postclassic. Re­measurement of the sample resulted in a radiocar­bon age of 1041 ± 33, with calibrated 2a date ranges of A.D. 940-1040 (p =.859) and A.D. 890-930 (p = .095). 
The island location likely was settled during political instability brought about by the Terminal Classic decline of nearby states and urban areas. The restricted setting and defensive walls identi­fied at nearby sites, such as Zacpeten (Pugh 2001; Rice et al. 1998) and Muralla de Leon (Rice 1986) (Figure 1) and elsewhere in the Maya Lowlands, demonstrate barricaded characteristics (Demarest 2004; Demarest et al. 1997; Golden 2003; Golden et al. 2008:265-266; Webster 2002:262-283). While no defensive walls are present at the Quexil Islands, the island location and 40 chert and obsid­ian arrow points recovered there are suggestive of an era of conflict (although hunting is a possibility as well). Villagutierre (1983[ 170 l] :295-296) describes the Peten ltza use of islands as points of refuge, which often were defended by canoe-borne archers. 
The laboratory analysis demonstrates the local nature of the ceramics recovered at Late!ferminal Classic shoreline settlements in the Petenxil Basin and at the Quexil Islands during the Terminal Clas­sic and Postclassic period. Almost no Fine Orange, Fine Gray, or Plumbate ceramics were found dur­ing the investigation (Schwarz 2004:262). Fine Orange, Plumbate, and Fine Gray are thought to be representative of, alternatively, influence from the Chontalpa (Thompson 1970:26, 38), migrants entering the Seibal region (Sabloff: 1975: 189, 238-239), and/or Epiclassic groups from the Petex­batun region (Rice and Rice 2004:128; Webster 2002:277-278), including migrants intruding into Central Peten. 
The funerary ware noted above, Jato Black-on­Gray, is also present at Macanche, Uaxactun, and in the Tayasal-Paxcaman region (Chase and Chase 1983:Figure 18a; Rice 1987:83; Smith and Gifford 1966: 158), not at Seibal. Pakoc phase (A.O. 600-700) and local Hobo phase (A.D. 700-900) ceramics were noted in excavations of Petenxil Groups 1 and 3 (Figure 2), near the shoreline (Schwarz 2004: 145-151 ).

dence for in-migration of outsiders and instead demonstrate continuity; they support the likelihood that local people established the Terminal Classic period settlement on the Quexil Islands. 
Stelae and altars were erected at Ixhi and Zacpeten from AD. 829-849. These two sites were minor centers in the Classic period hierarchy that previously had not erected stelae. The monuments reference certain titles previously associated with nobility at Tikal (Rice et al.1998:234-238; Schele et al. 1995: 12). The Quexil Islands had a stela, prob­ably Terminal Classic in date, but looters removed it before it was studied (Chase 1983:1151-1152). The locations of these monuments and the appro­priation of titles (at the frrst two sites mentioned) suggest to some epigraphers the increased assertion of political autonomy by previously secondary cen­ters as the core polity declined (Martin and Grube 2000:53; Schele et al. 1995: 12). The Terminal Clas­sic Quexil Islands community probably operated in a period when smaller communities experienced increased autonomy. 
Architecture at the Quexil Islands and other Peten Lakes Settlements 
The community organization of the Quexil Islands differs from nearby Late Classic rural settlements in the Petenxil Basin (Groups 1 and 3), and larger centers, including Michoacan, Cenote, MSJ, and Tayasal (Chase 1983; Moriarty 2004; Schwarz 2004:143-153) (Figures 1 and 2). 
Each island rises to a summit several meters above the current waterline. The eastern island has a concentric series of terraces that support struc­tures, giving the impression of three nested rings (Figure 7). Cut-and-fill techniques expanded the surfaces of natural terraces. The summit area and the terraces each support compact groups of two or more structures. These compact groups are taller, more substantial structures, some of which feature benches and masonry walls. The outermost ring consists of small domestic and ancillary structures clinging to the hillsides 1-2 m above the waterline. Their constructional terraces are limited in size and formality and have lone structures or structure pairs. 
The western island's six structures form a lin­ear grouping oriented slightly east of north (Figure 8), facilitated by the construction of terraces over the natural ridgeline. 

Certain changes in structure grouping appear to be adaptations of Classic period patterning to steeper terrain and limited space. Domestic struc­tures are often crowded against hillsides (Figure 7, Q13 and Ql6). Structure groupings are sometimes truncated so that only parts of structural arrange­ments prevalent in the Classic period are present in the Postclassic period. At the Quexil Islands, no structures have outset stairs; all are inset. At other Postclassic sites, such as Zacpeten, outset stairs are present only on monumental temples, and, at Topoxte, the largest residential buildings (Hermes et al. 2000:34). 
Civic-ceremonial architecture at the eastern Quexil Island includes a single larger complex group, the acropolis group (Ql4-Q18; Figure 10). An elevated structure, Q 14, is in the easternmost position. Q 14 has a width/length ratio of .65, below Becker's (2003:259) minimum width/length ratio (.70) for Plaza Plan 2 shrines. The difference may relate to the lack of an outset staircase at Q 14 (cf. Figure 4, the form of Tikal 5G-8 without its stair­way). This building has not been excavated due to extensive looting damage. 
The greatest departure of Q 14-Q 18 from Late Classic period plaza design is the division of the structure group into two small plazas on separate architectural terraces. The bi-level plaza pattern allows for enough space to locate Q 14, Q 18A, and

Q 18 along the east-west axis. The division of space breaks up what would otherwise be continuous open space, as is usual in Classic plaza patterns. Movement and gathering of people would be more difficult since the plaza space is subdivided. Thus, although one aspect of the architectural front region (Giddens 1984:124-126), the plaza space, was modified and diminished in comparison to Late Classic examples, the presence of two central shrines (Ql5 and Ql8A) and a presumably open­fronted C-shaped range structure (Ql8) created three architectural forms on which ritual activities were staged, as discussed below. 
Uses of Shrines 
Excavations of shrines uncovered deposits of effigy and non-effigy censers, other ceremonial artifacts, and one partial human interment (Table 2). On the east side of Q 1, portions of at least five Late Post­classic or Early Historic Patojo Modeled censers (Figure 11) were recovered that were fragmented, possibly smashed. Nearby, concentrations of 122 fragments of turtle shell, some burned, and chert flakes were found. At Zacpeten, fragmented turtle shells, which Pugh (2001 :254) interprets as offer­ing bowls, were recovered from two shrines. 
A disarticulated interment was in a test pit exca­vated on axis at the base of the west side of struc­ture Q 1. Above was a fill layer with ceramics that Rice (personal communication, 2002) dates to the late Early Postclassic period (AD. 1100-1200). 
Zacpeten structure 602, an eastern temple with Terminal Classic through Late Postclassic building episodes, featured disarticulated burials of an adult and juvenile. The burials were in a pit below the southwest part of the temple floor, above which Postclassic Patajo Modeled censer fragments, spiked censer fragments, a Saca Polychrome ves­sel, and incense were intruded (Pugh 2001:241-242). 
Two central shrines, Ql5 and Q18A, were exca­vated at the acropolis group of the eastern Quexil Island (Figure 10). Excavations at Q l 8A yielded a quartz crystal and four fragmentary censers near the surface which date to the Late Postclassic or Early Historic period (Table 2). Interiors of censer fragments were sooted, presumably indicating the burning of incense. At Ql5, three to six partial censers were recovered at the base of the west wall. 
Late shrines occur elsewhere in the region. At Tayasal, Tl 00 is a 1.4-m high square central shrine in one of the plazas. A Middle Postclassic Cocah­mut phase (ca. A.D. 1200-1450) or later burial was within a cist in the structure. The shrine construc­tion appears to be Early Postclassic Chilcob phase, although remnants of earlier construction (possi­bly Late Classic) were discovered within it (Chase 1983:369-984). In 1996, Tim Pugh and Kevin Schwarz cleared a portion of T99, just northwest ofTIOO, and found a Postclassic C-shaped bench structure. A civic-ceremonial group at Tayasal, Tl l 7-T l25, was apparently a Plaza Plan 2 that was converted into a Plaza Plan 4, as described by Chase ( 1983 :468-4 78) (Figure 12). An eastern ele-

vated shrine (T124) has not been fully excavated, but the irregularly shaped central shrine (T l 23) was fully excavated, has burials, and dates to the Late or Terminal Classic Hobo phase. Tl 25 is a Postclassic open hall. 
At Ixhi, a large square-form central shrine, struc­ture 2023, was excavated during 1998. It is within a civic-ceremonial group that featured three C­shaped benches. Multiple human interments were found: three skull pairs, two rows of skulls, and four postcranial skeletons (Duncan 2005: 198-202). The construction of structure 2023 was during the Early Postclassic, although interment of the skulls and postcrania may be later. 
Use of Benches and Altars 
Evidence of ritual activity was recovered from altars and benches at open halls; at a domestic struc­ture, a burial was found within a bench. Debris scatters across several benches (Q5, Ql 1, and Q21) may reflect utilitarian activity at structures or post­abandonment secondary discard. 
On the western island, Q2 is a low open hall that preserved evidence of the use of censers (Schwarz 2004:178-179) (Figure 13). Untyped censer frag­ments were recovered along the side wall of the structure, and are interpreted as provisional dis­card, while another scatter was found around the central altar. Fragmented turtle shell also was in close association with another central altar and may have been used in a ritual (and was recovered at structure Ql nearby). 
Q 18 (Figure 10) is a raised open hall on the east­ern island, with an inset stairway and masonry bench, but without masonry supports for a colon­nade. A scattering of censer sherds were found on the floor of the building, near the altar and bench. The presence of quadruped long bones (likely deer) and deer metapodials both on the floor and on the central altar suggests the placement of animal parts as offerings (Figure 14). 
It is difficult to identify a firm ethnographic analogy for what ritual(s) involved these animal offerings. However, Landa ( 1941 [ 1579]: 114-115) describes that Yucatecan women frequently made offerings of entire (or parts of) "birds of the sky, animals of the earth, fish of the sea" at altars in the courts of the temples. Offerings were made raw or they could be cooked (several fragments of turtle shell at Ql and Q2 were burnt). The altars were located "near the staircase of the temple ... [where] .. . there was a round, broad pedestal, and in the center of it, was a rather slender stone and four or five palms high, set up on the top of the staircase

of the temple there was a similar stone." The description of the upper altar is analogous to the altar on Q 18, at the top of the stairway, on which the quadruped long bone epiphysis was found (except the Q18 altar is approximately square; Fig­ure 14 ). Pohl (1983 :62-63) cites ethnographic and archaeological evidence indicating that deer parts, including skulls, teeth, and hind limbs were used as offerings in cuch (year renewal) rites among the Maya. 
At Q5, a residential structure with an L-shaped bench (Figure 8), a disarticulated human burial (# 1) was excavated from a 20-cm deep sascab cist that was below the stuccoed surface of the bench, which was littered with hundreds of chert flakes and domestic ceramic sherds (Figure 15). Q4, across the plaza, had fewer artifacts although two nearly complete Maskall Unslipped jars and large frag­ments of a Fulano Unslipped jar were on the occu­pation floor. 
Q 12 is the most elevated bench structure on the islands and is paired in a small plaza with Q 11 (Figure 7). It had the most Late Postclassic poly­chrome ceramics of any structure excavated. Next to the straight-line bench a small circular altar that was centered on the long axis of the structure was excavated. Within the altar (Feature 3) were a sin­gle obsidian arrow point, worked jadeite, and tur­tle shell fragments (Table 2). 
The evidence of ritual activity uncovered at benches on the Quexil Islands does not mean that they were thrones or seats of authority. Rather the evidence indicates that ritual practice is associated with benches at hinterland sites, which has impor-

tant implications for social organization, as dis­cussed below. 
Domestic Groups 
Larger Classic period groups, as compared with groups of the Postclassic period, are prevalent throughout the Peten Lakes region (e.g., Tayasal, Cenote, Michoacan, and MSJ), and at Classic period Tikal and Seibal. Haviland ( 1988), Rice ( 1988), and Tourtellot (1988b) infer that larger households, thought to have been extended families, inhabited the fonnal plaza groups of the Classic period. Typ­ically, within these groups only one structure is iden­tified as a kitchen. Often the kitchens are small, located in plaza comers or other unobtrusive places in the !:,>roup and display evidence of food prepara­tion and consumption, including faunal remains and fire-affected utilitarian ceramics. 
Tenninal Classic and later domestic settlement at the Quexil Islands and nearby sites (e.g., Zacpeten) was organized as smaller, looser groups of structures of two types: structure pairs, in which the formal and domestic zones of the house are sep­arated, and lone structures in which formal and domestic functions are shared (Pugh 2002: 362-363; Schwarz 2004: 359-452, 561-573 ). In this first type, one structure opposes a partner (Q4-Q5, Q9-QIO, and Q13-Ql6), or is laterally aligned to a partner (Q20-Q21; Figures 7 and 8) without a fully enclosed plaza. The second type is lone structures with their own platform, but with­out frontal visibility of other opposing structures (Q3 and Ql9). 
Structures Q20-Q2 l appear to have functioned as a main house building and kitchen/workshop facility for a household group (Figure 16). Q21 is a C-shaped bench structure at which considerable debris scatters were found, including chert deb­itage and obsidian debitage and blades, although some material may reflect post-abandonment refuse. A whole Chilo Unslipped jar and a dish on the front patio were probably in situ artifacts. Q21 was likely a center of domestic life, a front region of social interaction (Giddens 1984) for household members, in which everyday living activities, vis­iting with relatives and community members and certain economic activities took place. 
Structure Q20 lacks a masonry bench. On the floor, fragments of Chilo and Pozo unslipped bro­ken jars (alias), Chilo incurving bowl fragment, two fragmentary tecomates, Paxcaman dish fragments, a mano, and fragmentary groundstone were found. An in situ anvil stone and burned animal bones (n

A sin­gle household, such as a nuclear family, could have inhabited Q20-Q2 l. Q5 and Q4 are another bench structure paired with a non-bench structure that may have functioned as a main house building and kitchen facility for a household group. 
Postclassic Political Integration 
Political changes occurred after the Terminal Clas­sic reorganization of settlement in the Quexil­Petenxil Basins. The Quexil Islands became a well-integrated village within the Itza state, most likely by the Late Postclassic period (A.D. 1250-1525). Its inhabitants were tied politically, economically, and religiously to Tajltza. For the 1690s, Villagutierre (1983[1701]:343) describes the Quexil Islands, "Equexil," as two inhabited islands within the eastern sub-province of the ltza kingdom, without its own chief and governed directly by the king, AjKan Ek'. A seventeenth­century map (Jones 1998:93) made by the Spanish friar, Avendano, depicts the zone to the southeast of Tajltza as a bread basket region that supplied maize to the capital and AjKan Ek'. Don Rice ( 1996) provides evidence that two prehispanic canals linked Lake Quexil, Lake Petenxil, and Lake Peten ltza (Figure 2). The canals together exceed 1 km in distance, cut in relatively straight lengths

through low terrain. People and goods likely moved between the Quexil Islands and Tajltza, a distance of about 8 km, via the canal. Surlace collection and excavation reveal use of the canal and occupation of canalside domestic groups in the Postclassic period (Schwarz 2004:144-145, 151). 
Censer use was a Postclassic politico-religious practice, linking Maya peoples to their gods and/or ancestors, as a legitimation of their world view and political order (Pugh 2002:311-31 7). For a small settlement, the Quexil Islands preserves much evi­dence of ritual involving the use of censers at shrines and open halls. Recovery of censers also recalls Spanish accusations of "idolatry," or what the Spaniards described as the worship of the censers and other statuary, which they referred to as "idols" (Lopez de Cogolludo 1971 :258-259; P. Rice 1996). For the 1690s, Villagutierre (1983[1701):343) also records that "Equexil" had a single "house of idolatry." Thus, censer ritual was carried out in polity centers and major towns, as well as in smaller settlements.
