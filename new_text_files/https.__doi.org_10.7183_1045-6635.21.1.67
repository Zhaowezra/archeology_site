CONTINUITY AND TRANSFORMATION DURING THE TERMINAL 
MIDDLE HORIZON (A.D. 950-1150): A BIOARCHAEOLOGICAL 
ASSESSMENT OF TUMILACA ORIGINS WITHIN THE MIDDLE 
MOQUEGUA VALLEY, PERU 

Richard C. Sutter and Nicola Sharratt 
Previous archaeological studies suggest that terminal Middle Horizon Tumilaca populations (cal A.D. 950-1150) of the middle Moquegua Valley represent direct descendants of earlier Chen Chen-style Tiwankau colonists of the region. This study tesls this idea by comparing dentally derived biodistance analyses ofTumilaca, Chen Chen-style, Tiwanaku, and other regional samples. The results indicate that the Tumilaca and Chen Chen-style mortuary samples are similar to one another suggesting that these populations might share an ancestral-descendant relationship. The phenetic relations of the Tumilaca and Chen Chen to other regional samples are also discussed.

die Moquegua Valley as Tiwanaku's direct politi­cal and economic control over the region waned (Goldstein 1985, 2005; Owen 1993, 2005; Sutter 2000, 2009a), while others argue that these poli­ties represent indigenous populations unrelated to the Tiwanaku whose biological origins can be found among Formative Period (800 B.C.-A.D. 500) populations of the region (Buikstra et al. 2005; Lozada 1998; Loazada and Buikstra 2002; Tom­czak 2001). 
Within the context of this paper we examine the bioarchaeological relationships among the Tumi­laca and other Middle Horizon populations of the South Central Andes by testing these competing hypotheses using genetically influenced tooth trait data. The Tumilaca provide us with a unique oppor­tunity to consider the process of political change and emerging social identity in the middle Moquegua Valley at a time when Tiwanaku's influ­ence diminished. 
Culture History of the Moquegua Valley 
So as to contextualize the biodistance results we report in this study, we provide a brief summary of the culture history for the Moquegua Valley. Sites identified by archaeological surveys and excava­tions indicate that during the Archaic Period (8000-1000 B.C), sites in the Moquegua region were located adjacent to coastal spring-fed que­bradas to the north and along the pampa to the south coast of Ilo, while there is an absence of sites iden­tified for this period in the middle Moquegua Val­ley. Sites consisted of large shell mounds, Iithic debris and fishing tackle, residential terraces, and Chinchorro group burials. This population con­centration along the coast contrasts with the appar­ent lack of Archaic sites for the middle Moquegua Valley.

sent the earliest agricultural settlements of the region and date as early as 800 B.C. and may be as recent as A.D. 800 (Costion 2008; Goldstein 2005; Green 2008). Huaracane settlements, relative to the Wari and Tiwanaku settlements, are small and largely confined to the lower portions of the mid­dle Moquegua Valley (Goldstein 2005 ; Owen and Goldstein 200 1 ). While our current understanding of Huaracane settlements is largely based upon sur­vey and limited excavations of tumulos and boot tombs, it appears that users of the Huaracane-style ceramics had some degree of cultural contact with the Wari as evidenced by Wari sherds and obsidian from the Wari site Cerro Baul (Owen and Gold­stein 2001) and recently reported sherds from exca­vated domestic contexts at Trapiche exhibiting Huaracane motifs on one side and Wari chevrons on the other side (Green 2008). Blom's ( 1998) com­parison of a Huaracane mortuary sample with both Formative and Middle Horizon mortuary samples from the Lake Titicaca Basin as well as Omo-and Chen Chen-style mortuary samples fro m the Moquegua Valley reveals that the Huaracane are dissimilar from all of the other samples reported by Blom. The assumption is that Huaracane peo­ple were descended from pre-existing Formative Period inhabitants of the valley that may have had their origins among earlier indigenous peoples of the valley (Goldstein and Owen 200 1 ; Owen 1993 ). However, the relationship between users of the 
Huaracane-style ceramics and Moquegua valley Wari colonists awaits further clarification through excavation of mortuary contexts and biodistance comparisons of their mortuary populations. 
The Middle Horizon (AD. 500-1 150) is defined by the spread of Tiwanaku IV and V ceramics throughout the South Central Andes. In the middle Moquegua Valley there is substantial evidence for numerous contemporaneous sites affiliated with both the southern highland Wari (Moseley et al. 2005; Owen and Goldstein 200 I ; Williams 200 I) and altiplano Tiwanaku states (Blom et al. 1998; Goldstein 2005), which are located at altitudes ranging between 1,000 and 2,000 mas!. Goldstein (2005) argues that the sunken court at Omo MIO and the presence of Tiwanaku IV and V serving wares and domestic wares from ceremonial, funer­ary, and domestic contexts attest to permanent Tiwanaku colonies in the middle Moquegua Val­ley. Based upon ceramics, mortuary features, and 
settlement patterns, he identifies two contempora­neous ethnically Tiwanaku traditions in the middle Moquegua Valley that he refers to as the Omo and Chen Chen styles. Goldstein (2005: 158) reports radiocarbon dates that range between cal AD. 785 to cal AD. IOOOfortheChen Chen style, while the Omo style ranges from AD. 538-1030 (Goldstein 2005: 152). While it is thought that the settlements associated with Chen Chen-style ceramics repre­sent Tiwanaku agricultural colonists who shared social identities with Tiwanaku peoples of the southern Lake Titicaca region (Goldstein 2005:223), the blackware ceramics from Omo-style settlements are nearly indistinguishable from those from the Copacabana Peninsula and eastern slopes of Bolivia (Goldstein 2005:316). Omo-style set­tlements are located on bluffs farther from agri­cultural fields than contemporaneous Chen Chen-style settlements. Further, Omo-style settle­ments are characterized by relatively fewer and smaller grinding stones, ephemeral cane domestic structures, and paths radiating from them, leading Goldstein (2005: 153-4) to suggest that the Omo­style Tiwanaku colonists represent camelid herders and traders who shared complementary economic relations with associated Chen Chen-style peoples. Among other important distinctions with Chen Chen-style settlements is the preponderance of tex­tile implements in both Omo-style domestic struc­tures and female grave offerings (Goldstein 2005:200, 254). 
Both mitochondrial DNA (Lewis et al. 2007) and epigenetic cranial trait comparisons (Blom et al. 1998) of a Chen Chen mortuary sample with remains from Tiwanaku and other Lake Titicaca sites support Goldstein's assertion that Tiwanaku colonists resided in the middle valley. Similarly, strontium isotope analyses by Knudson and Price (2007) provide evidence that at least some of those interred at Chen Chen sites were raised in the south­ern Lake Titicaca region. 
During the terminal Middle Horizon (ca. AD. 950), archaeologists have documented the aban­donment of Tiwanaku settlements at both Omo-and Chen Chen-style sites concurrent with an apparent dispersal of the colonists who previously resided there (Goldstein 2005; Owen 2005). Williams (2002) proposes that this dispersal was largely due to the progressive abandonment of Tiwanaku agri­cultural fields and settlements due to pressures

imposed by Wari irrigation works built upstream from the vast majority ofTiwanaku Omo-style and Chen Chen-style colonies. Eventually, Wari colonists on and around Cerro Baul abandoned their settlements and left the region, too. The aban­donment of the Wari embassy at Cerro Baul is evi­denced by ubiquitous burning in excavated structures and the ritual breaking of Wari-style ceramics on those structures (Moseley et al. 2005). 
At Chen Chen-style sites, tombs were prehis­torically looted and the temple at Omo Ml 0 was destroyed (Goldstein 2005:225-226). Pitted rock piles from the destruction of domestic structures is evident at Chen Chen-style sites, and the inhabi­tants dispersed (from settlements such as Omo M 10 and Ml 2) to fortified or naturally protected settle­ments of the lower middle valley (La Yaral M8 and Maria Cupine M9, Cerro Chamos M44), middle valley (Omo Mll, Echenique M4 ), and previously uninhabited regions of the upper tributaries of the Moquegua Valley (Tumilaca-La Chimba U4, PorobayaP5, Site 171) (Bawden 1989, 1993; Gold­stein 2005; Owen and Goldstein 200 1; Stanish 
1992) and began producing a closely related 
ceramic style referred to as Tumilaca (Goldstein 2005; Owen 2005; Owen and Goldstein 200 1). 
Available radiocarbon dates point to approxi­mately fifty years of temporal overlap between the Chen Chen and Tumilaca styles (Goldstein 2005:128-131; Owen 2005:52, 60); however, apparent stylistic similarities and community-based storage features associated with Chen Chen Phase settlements are no longer archaeologically detectable after A.D. 1000 (Goldstein 2005:158), while Tumilaca Phase settlements-which are characterized by rectangular household storage bins as opposed to centralized circular storage silos, relatively lower frequencies of camelids, higher frequencies of cuy remains, and an increased fre­quency in higher status collared tombs-persist until A.D. 1250. Some sites, such as Cerro Trapiche M7, Chen Chen Ml, Echenique M2-5, and Omo Ml2 have both spatially discrete Chen Chen-and Tumilaca-style occupations, while others, includ­ing Omo Ml O (Goldstein 2005:226), provide strati­graphic evidence for a Chen Chen followed by Tumilaca Phase occupation. 
Most scholars concur that a large degree of cul­tural continuity exists between the users of Chen Chen-and Tumilaca-style peoples (Bawden 1989, 1993; Bermann et al. 1989; Goldstein 1985, 2005; Owen 1993, 2005). Middle valley Tumilaca finewares share similar forms and designs with pre­vious Chen Chen-style ceramics, but are more vari­able in their slips and forms, have coarser temper, and lack the Gateway God iconography that is com­monly found on earlier Tiwanaku ceramics from both the Adjacent altiplano and middle valley ceramics (Bermann et al. 1989:282; Goldstein 2005:233). Textiles also suggest cultural continu­ity between Chen Chen and Tumilaca styles in weaving techniques and designs (Goldstein 2005:235). Current interpretations suggest that Chen Chen-style users shared social identities with Tiwanaku peoples of the altiplano, while produc­ers of Tumilaca-style ceramics represent direct descendants of the Tiwanaku Chen Chen-style colonists whose overt expressions of social iden­tity began to diverge from the altiplano Tiwanaku stylistic canons and became more localized and variable. 
Based upon his extensive survey and excavation of stratified habitation sites, Owen (1993, 2005) asserts that the culture history for the lower Moquegua Valley region is markedly different than that for the middle valley during the Middle Hori ­zon. Unlike for the middle valley, Owen (1993:58; 2005:58) reports a lack of evidence for Tiwanaku sites on the coast. Instead, early Middle Horizon lower valley sites continue to be characterized by the Algodonal Early Ceramic tradition, which exhibits no stylistic or technical similarities with contemporaneous Tiwanaku ceramics (Owen 2005:66). Instead, there are striking similarities among the Early Ceramic tradition of the lower val­ley and the Huaracane traditions of the middle val­ley (Owen 1993 :412, 2005 :51 ). Calibrated radiocarbon dates for the Early Ceramic tradition range between 100 B.C. and A.D. 610 (Owen 2005:72), but may persist until -A.D. 900. There are relatively few, small Early Ceramic sites, lead ­ing Owen to conclude that the lower valley was sparsely populated by fisher-agriculturalists during most of the Middle Horizon until A.D. 900 when, Owen (1993:60, 91, 2005:72) hypothesizes, this population was absorbed or replaced by an over­whelming immigration of terminal Middle Hori­zon people from inland regions. The first were probably of the Chiribaya tradition, with people from the Moquegua area following shortly after and

developing the Ilo-Tumilaca/Cabuza tradition. Set­tlements associated with the Chiribaya and ITC traditions clearly postdate the Algodonal Early Ceramic tradition as evidenced by both radiocar­bon dates and their stratigraphic placement above Early Ceramic settlements. 
The emergence of both the coastal Ilo­Tumilaca/Cabuza and Chiribaya traditions has been referred to as part of a two-stage diaspora of Tiwanaku peoples (Goldstein 2005:323; Owen 2005). It is argued that the collapse and dispersal of Tiwanaku's colonists from the middle valley also led to a massive population movement into the lower Moquegua Valley (Owen 1993:91-98, 2005:65-67; Umire and Miranda 2001). Owen has established that the coeval ITC and Chiribaya traditions are distinct from one another on the basis of ceramics, mortuary practices, textiles, spoons, diet, and domestic architecture, yet these two cultural traditions peacefully coexisted for centuries with both ITC and Chiribaya settlements sharing the same irrigation canal and being located next to one another throughout the lower Moquegua Valley (Owen I 993:94-98, 2005; Umire and Miranda 200 1). Ilo-Tumilaca-style ceramics are clearly similar to their middle val­ley Tumilaca counterparts (Owen 1993: 17, 
190-191, 2005:66), and over time became Ilo­Cabuza, which are simpler in design and poorer in execution than the earlier Ilo-Tumilaca ceram­ics. Owen claims that following their arrival dur­ing the terminal Middle Horizon there is a progressive decrease in both site number and size of ITC sites while the number and size of Chirib­aya sites increases at the beginning of the Late Intermediate period (A.D. 1150-1476), and that ITC-style ceramics and settlements are abandoned by A.D. I 250, thereby leaving the Chiribaya as the only cultural presence in the coastal Moquegua Valley (Owen I 993: 18-19). 
While the terminal Middle Horizon and Late Intermediate period Chiribaya become the pre­dominant polity along the coastal region of the South Central Andes, some Chiribaya sites have been identified in the middle valley (Buikstra 1995; Goldstein 2005; Rice 1993) and upper tributaries (Stanish 1992) of Moquegua. Jessup (l 990a, l 990b) developed a three phase relative chronol­ogy for Chiribaya ceramics based upon his sys­tematic examination of ceramics he excavated from both tombs and stratified deposits at sites within the lower Moquegua Valley. Others (Garcia 1988; Rey craft 2000; U mire and Miranda 2001) have also reported similar sequences for Chiribaya ceramics using diagnostic sherds from stratigraphically exca­vated deposits. More recently, an additional "ter­minal Chiribaya" or "Chiriquifia" style has been defined that exhibits continuity with previous Chiribaya-San Geronimo ceramics and the subse­quent Estuquifia style (Reycraft 2000; Zaro and Umire 2005), but postdates the collapse of the Chiribaya polity sometime aroundA.D. 1350 when an El Nino event destroyed the Chiribaya's irriga­tion canal, and damaged their reservoirs and agri­cultural terraces (Owen 1993, 2005; Rey craft 2000; 
Saterlee et al. 200 1; Zaro and Umire 2005). Using epigenetic dental traits, one of us has argued else­where (Sutter 1997, 2000, 2005, 2008, 2009a, 2009b) that the Chiribaya may be descended from middle valley Omo-style Tiwanaku colonists, and that Ilo-Tumilaca/Cabuza peoples gradually shifted their identity to become Chiribaya of the Moquegua valley (Sutter 2008, 2009a). 
Importantly, based upon biodistance results from nonmetric cranial trait comparisons of Early Ceramic, Chiribaya, Ilo-Tumilaca/Cabuza mortu­ary samples with those collected by Blom (1998) for Tiwanaku, Huaracane, and Chen Chen, mortu­ary samples, others (Buikstra et al. 2005; Lozada 1998; Lozada and Buikstra 2002; Tomczak 2001) argue for an indigenous coastal origin for both the Tumilaca and Chiribaya. These scholars have pro­posed an alternative culture history for the coastal Moquegua Valley based upon 37 human bone col­lagen radiocarbon dates (Buikstra et al. 2005:73; Lozada 1998:52; Lozada and Buikstra 2002:54-57) that chronologically places the Chiribaya between 
A.D. 680 and 1250. Accordingly, these scholars claim that the early Middle Horizon emergence for the Chiribaya would mean that the coastal Chirib­aya could not be descended from Tiwanaku colonists in the middle Moquegua Valley. Addi­tionally, all three of the traditionally recognized Chiribaya ceramic phases are coeval according to their alternative chronology. 
However, the human bone collagen dates pre­sented by Lozada ( 1998) and her colleagues (Buik­stra et al. 2005; Lozada and Buikstra 2002) contradict both the relative and absolute chronolo­gies derived from ceramic seriation and excavated

stratified sequences for the Chiribaya (Garcia 1988; Jessup l990a; Owen 1993, 2002; Stanish and Rice 1989; Zaro and Umire 2005). Further, Owen (2002) has established that the marine reservoir effect is greater for coastal Moquegua region than for other regions of the world. The large marine dietary com­ponent documented for the Chiribaya (Buikstra et al. 2005; Sandness 1992; Tomczak 200 1, 2003) points to a dramatic carbon reservoir effect for the human bone collagen dates. Therefore, until the bone collagen dates for the coastal Chiribaya pre­sented by Lozada (1998; Lozada and Buikstra 2002) and Buikstra et al. (2005) are independently validated by non-collagen dates from stratified sequences, we will rely upon the absolute chronol­
ogy established by Owen (1993, 2005) for the coastal Moquegua Valley. 
During the terminal Late Intermediate period 
(A.D. 1250-1475), the Estuquifia 
replaced the Tumilaca 's cultural presence in the upper tribu­taries of the Moquegua Valley (Stanish 1992), with the Estuquifia sometimes placing their houses directly on previous Tumilaca houses (Bawden 
1989). While the biological origins of the Estuquifia remains unclear, archaeologists have posited that they were unrelated to the Tumilaca (Bawden 1989) and were likely affiliated with the Colla polity of the northwestern Lake Titicaca region. The Estuquifia's 
influence is also detected within the coastal Moquegua region at terminal Chiribaya occupations in the form of both Estuquifia 
and Estuquifia-influenced terminal Chiribaya (also known as "Chiriquifia") ceramics. The end of the Late Intermediate period in the Moquegua region is defined by the lnka intrusion into the region dated to around A.D. 1450.

For the purposes of this study, we analyze the non­metric tooth trait frequencies for 14 mortuary sam­ples from the South Central Andes (Table l ), including both a mortuary sample representing Chen Chen-style Tiwanaku colonists and a Tumi­laca sample that are reported here for the first time. The Chen Chen Ml type site is located approxi­mately 1,500 m.a.s.l. on a pampa adjacent to the modem day city ofMoquegua. The site consists of a number of spatially discrete Chen Chen-style habitational and mortuary sectors. Centralized stor-

age silos, the ubiquity of grindings stones, and the site's placement adjacent to an irrigation canal and associated agricultural fields all attest to the site being occupied by an agrarian Tiwanaku colony (Goldstein 2005). Nonmetric dental trait data for 46 individuals from the Chen Chen Ml cemetery Sectors 28 and 29 were inspected for the purposes of this study (Owen 1997; Palacios 2005). While individuals interred at both sectors were associated with Chen Chen-style ceramics, remains from the two spatially discrete cemeteries exhibited distinct mortuary treatment. Those from Sector 28 were typically adults and adolescents interred in a seated position in either collared or simply stone-lined tombs and accompanied by Chen Chen-style ceramics. Burials uncovered during the excavation of Sector 29 were atypical of other Chen Chen-style cemeteries, and largely consisted of adolescents and children placed in shallow fossas in a semi­flexed position on their sides. Sector 29 burials were often accompanied by undecorated ceramics, and had an atypically high number of metal offer­ings relative to other Chen Chen-style burials. Tooth and cusp root trait frequencies for sectors 28 and 29 did not exhibit significant differences, and were therefore combined for biodistance analyses. 
The site of Tumilaca-La Chimba is located on a high bluff above the Tumilaca Valley-a tribu­tary of the Moquegua-at an altitude of 1900 m and approximately 15 km up valley from the city ofMoquegua. Steep dry gullies demarcate the east­ern and western limits of the bluff the settlement sits on. while the Cerro La Chimba is found on the northern end of the site. Three discrete architectural sectors have been identified (Bawden 1989), with the Tumilaca Phase occupation being character­ized by linear two to four roomed structures. The other two architectural sectors and northern wall are associated with the subsequent Estuquifia Phase occupation. Four discrete cemeteries have been identified with the largest of the four being located on the western slope of the ridge, while there are three spatially discrete cemeteries located on the eastern slope. There are an estimated 400-500 buri­als located at the site, of which the Proyecto Arque­ol6gico Cerro Baul project excavated 64 (Sharratt 2008; Sharratt et al. 2006; Sutter and Sharratt 2008). Of those 64 burials from the Tumilaca-La Chimba site, only 33 Tumilaca Phase individuals had score­able dentitions. 
Twelve of the 14 mortuary samples analyzed by this study have been reported in detail elsewhere (Sutter 1997, 2000, 2005, 2006, 2009a); therefore, what follows is only a cursory discussion of these mortuary samples. An Andean Paleoindian sample (n = 28) consists of the dental trait frequencies for human remains from the Andes that predate 8,000 years before present, while the Tiwanaku mortu­ary sample consists of individuals excavated by Adolf Bandelier from the sites Titia-Uayani (n = 28), Tiwanaku (n = 3), and Kea Kolla Chico (n = 26) who were primarily associated with Tiwanaku III (Qeya) grave goods (Stanish and Bauer 2004, Sutter 2009b). 1 
Six mortuary samples from the Moquegua Val­ley are also evaluated. The Ilo Preceramic sample (n = 16) consists of remains from two terminal Archaic period (3000-1000 B.C.) coastal sites­Yara and Kilometer 4-which are located approx­imately 10 km north ofllo, Peru (Sutter 1997, 2000, 2005). Three additional Moquegua Valley mortu­ary samples represent post-Tiwanaku influence Chiribaya (A.D. 950-1350) samples from lower middle and coastal valley. The La Yaral2 sample (n 
= 52) consists of remains from two discrete ceme­teries at a Chiribaya middle Moquegua Valley site characterized by a mixed agro-pastoralist econ­omy, while Chiribaya Alta mortuary sample (n = 185) consists of human remains from nine spatially discrete cemeteries from what is widely recognized as the administrative, ceremonial, and economic center of the Chiribaya polity (Buikstra 1995; Buik­stra et al. 2005; Jessup 1990a; Lozada 1998; Owen 1993, 2005; Sutter 1997, 2000, 2005). Chiribaya Alta is located 6 km from the coast and covers 36 hectares, containing 13 habitational terraces, a dry moat, and concentric high berms that enclose much of the site. The mortuary sample from San Geron­imo (n = 57) represents a contemporaneous Chirib­aya fishing community located at the mouth of the Moquegua River in the town of Ilo (Jessup 1990b ). 
In order to put the Tumilaca and other Moquegua Valley samples into a broader context within the South Central Andes, six additional mor­tuary samples from the Azapa Valley, which has a broadly similar culture history to the Moquegua Valley, are also analyzed here. The following sam­ples are described in greater detail in Sutter ( 1997, 2000, 2005, 2006, 2009b). The Chinchorro sam­ple (n = 84) represents a coastal Archaic Period pop-

ulation, while the Formative Period for the Azapa Valley is represented by two samples. The Alto Ramirez sample (n= 72) includes remains from sites providing the earliest evidence for both lower Azapa Valley village life and incipient agriculture, while Playa Miller-7 sample (n= 62) is a contem­poraneous Formative Period fishing community of the El Laucho cultural tradition where the earliest pottery of the region was also found. The terminal Middle Horizon and early Late Intermediate Period is represented by an agropastoral Cabuza sample from the adjacent cemeteries Azapa-6 and Azapa-71 (n= 109), while the sample from Azapa­140 (n = 82) is from a mixed agro-pastoral Maitas­Chiribaya cemetery. Importantly, burials from the Cabuza sample were interred with grave offerings 
and ceramics that are strikingly similar to Tumi­laca cultural objects described for the Moquegua Valley (Goldstein 2005; Owen 1993, 2005). The Playa Miller-4 mortuary sample (n= 43) is from a Late Intermediate Period coastal fishing com­munity's cemetery. 
Methods 
Nonmetric Tooth Cusp and Root Traits 
All specimens' dentitions were scored for the full battery of tooth cusp and root traits (Table 2) using the standardized plaques and descriptions of the ASU Dental Anthropology System (Turner et al. 1991 ). Non metric dental traits are highly heritable

among living populations (Berry 1978; Biggerstaff 1970, 1973; Escobar et al. 1976; Harris and Bailit 1980; Hassanali 1982; Nichol 1989; Portin and Alvesalo 1974; Scott 1980; Sofaer, MacLean, and Bailet 1972) have the advantage of being scoreable for fragmented skeletal materials, and are often used to reconstruct genetic relations among both prehistoric and living populations (Brewer-Carias et al. 1976; Green 1982; Haydenblit 1996; Sofaer, Niswander, and Mac Lean 1972; Sofaer et al. 1986; Turner 1983; Wijsman and Neves 1986). All tooth cusp and root traits were scored by the primary author of this paper. A previous study demonstrated that intra-observer error for the traits used by this study are well within acceptable ranges (Sutter 
1997: 162-167). 
Nonmetric Trait Frequencies 
Standard data analysis procedures are used to make results presented here comparable to those pre­sented by other nonmetric dental trait studies. Den­tal trait frequencies for each mortuary sample are calculated using the "individual count" method (Turner and Scott 1977). In cases where an indi­vidual exhibits asymmetry in the expression of a given trait, the greatest level of expression is used. This scoring procedure assumes that a single geno­type is responsible for any given trait's expression, and that when asymmetry exists among bilateral traits, the side exhibiting the maximum expression is closest to the true underlying genotype for the trait. The procedure also maximizes sample sizes; in cases where a given trait is observable for only one antimere but not the other, the observable side is counted as the maximum expression for that trait. This scoring procedure counts individuals for the calculation of trait frequencies. While many non­metric dental traits are scored on a graded scale, scores are collapsed into present or absence for the purposes biodistance studies. For purposes of com­parability, this study follows trait dichotomization procedures employed by Turner (1985:67-74, 
1987:312-3 15). 
Among the 14 mortuary samples examined here, Chi-square analysis revealed that none of the trait frequencies exhibited sexual dimorphism, there­fore both males and females were pooled. Inade­quate sample sizes (i .e., <10 for at least 25 percent of the mortuary samples) resulted in the retention of nine traits for subsequent biodistance analyses. 
Biodistance Analyses 
We calculated the Mahalanobis generalized dis­tance (d2) for binary epigenetic traits as a biodis­tance measure between two mortuary sites i andj. This distance is determined using the following equation: 
dJ= (Z;k -Zjk)'r1(z;k -zjk), 
where, as Konigsberg (1990:60) explains, "z;krep­resents the threshold value corresponding to a trait frequency of P;k for trait kin site i, Z;k 
is the thresh­old value for trait kin site}, and Tis a pooled tetra­choric correlation matrix between the k traits." The Mahalanobis generalized distance has been demon­strated to represent the minimum genetic distance between two groups being compared (Williams­Blangero and Blangero 1989). 
The Mahalanobis d2 matrix was then analyzed using nonmetric multidimensional scaling (MDS) analysis. Nonmetric MDS is a useful procedure for producing interpretable graphical representations of complex distance matrices using the number of dimensions specified by the investigator (Kruskal and Wish 1984). For this study, we chose three dimensions. 
Hypothetical Design Matrices 
While Mahalanobis d2 values provide an indica­tion as to the relative biological distance among the mortuary populations being compared, their inter­pretation is often equivocal and may not necessar­ily indicate which among a number of competing explanations is best supported by the resulting biodistances. Therefore, we also employ the matrix method-a technique that is widely employed in the biological sciences (Gonzalez-Jose et al. 2001; Konigsberg 1990; Mantel 1967; Sokal et al. 1997; Waddle 1994). The construction of hypothetical matrix models is described in detail by Sokal et al. (1997). The design matrices employed by this study are discussed further below; however, each reflects intersample distances based on spatial and tempo­ral variables. In other words, the design matrices represent both spatial and temporal lag distances between samples such that a very recent and a very ancient sample that are spatially discrete will have a large value in the design matrix. 
For this study, we test two hypothetical design matrices that reflect alternative hypotheses for the
