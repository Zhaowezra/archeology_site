
SPINDLE WHORLS FROM EL PALMILLO: 
ECONOMIC IMPLICATIONS 

Lacey B. Carpenter, Gary M. Feinman, and Linda M. Nicholas 
We analyze household inventories from eight excavated residences at El Palmillo (Oaxaca, Mexico) with a focus on a large sample of spindle whorls . Measurement of the whorls provides a basis to suggest that a variety of fibers were spun in these Classic period households; however, the particular mix of fibers varied in each residence. The distribution of whorls by size and production technique was compared with the spatial patterning of other tool classes related to cloth production to illus­trate that each household participated with differing intensity in the various steps of the cloth-making process while also being involved in other economic pursuits. The domestic multicrafting, along with the clear procurement of domestic goods through intra-and extracommunity transfers. is indicative of economic practices that incorporate both interdependence and 
flexibility to operate in a socioeconomic setting prone to fluctuations in both demand and climatic conditions such as those jiJUnd in the Valley of Oaxaca. Mexico. The model generatedfrom this bottom-up analysis illustrates the limitation of the command-oriented models of the prehispanic Mesoamerican economy and sheds new light on craji specialization and eco­nomic strategies that vary not only between elite and none lite families but among commoner households as well.

Flannery 1976; Flannery and Marcus 2005; Hirth, ed. 2009; Santley and Hirth 1993; Wilk and Rathje 1982), is leading to alternative interpretations. The house is now seen as the key unit for craft produc­tion and one of the hallmarks of the Mesoameri­can economy (Feinman 1999; Feinman and Nicholas 2005; Feinman et al. 2007; Folan et al. 1979; Hirth 1998; Hirth, ed. 2009; Parsons 2009) . 
In this article, we focus on craft activities evi­denced through horizontal excavations of eight Classic period (A.D. 200-850) houses at the site of El Palmillo, located in the Tlacolula arm of the Oaxaca Valley. We examine spindle whorl and bone tool distributions to look at cloth and fiber pro­duction and present evidence for household-scale production in the Mesoamerican economy. We aim to address questions regarding the nature of eco­nomic production and its location and relation to distribution and status. We argue that the diversi­fied domestic production strategies at El Palmillo, when placed in a larger regional context, imply active networks of both intrasettlement and inter­site exchange. Based on these findings, we propose an expanded view of the relationship between agri­cultural and craft production and question the pre­sumption of domestic self-sufficiency. 
Changing Models of 
Mesoamerican Economies 

Over the years, scholars have endeavored to under­stand production, distribution, and consumption and the mechanisms that link these economic processes to broader social and political contexts (Brumfiel and Earle 1987; Costin 1991 ; Hirth 1996; Schortman and Urban 2004; Smith 2004). For pre­hispanic Mesoamerica, traditional models drew heavily on Marx, Polanyi, and Wittfogel and focused primarily on the Aztec, for whom descrip­tions (textual) of economic behaviors were more robust than for other Mesoamerican societies (Berdan 1983;Carrasco 1978, 1983;Sanders 1968; Sanders and Price 1968). These models have sev­eral central elements, including tribute; centralized management of land, water, or other means of pro­duction; and corvee labor (Carrasco 1978; Sanders 1968). Because the Tlatelolco market was such a prominent feature of the Aztec world, views of the Aztec economy included marketplace exchange. But such exchanges were often thought to have been controlled by political authorities (Smith 2004:76) and were not necessarily envisioned for other Mesoamerican economies (e.g., Kurtz 1974; Sanders et al. 1979:404--405). 
One of the more explicit traditional models clas­sified the ancient Mesoamerican economy as a redistributive system where a powerful ruling class was able to control production and regulate distri­bution by demanding large amounts of tribute (usu­ally in the form of "wealth" goods) to be redistributed at the discretion of the state (Carrasco 1978:45). Additionally, this central authority reg­ulated market prices, even buying unsold products (generally food, both fresh and cooked, and pot­tery) to ensure that participants maintained acer­tain standard of living (Carrasco 1983:77). These distributional interventions allowed the state to use the "directed" or "controlled" marketplace along with tribute as redistributive mechanisms. This model postulates that the governing body had exceptional power that was used both to control the kinds of goods sold in the market and to regulate their prices and distribution. 
In spite of the top-down focus of these early works, households are mentioned as possible locales for production by both proponents and opponents of the redistributive or command model (Carrasco 1978, 1983; Offner 1981); however, it was not until the 1970s and 1980s that highland households became a major focus for concerted archaeological investigation (Flannery 1976; Flan­nery and Marcus 2005 ; Manzanilla 1986; Santley and Hirth 1993; Wilk and Ashmore 1988; Wilk and Rathje 1982). These excavations have highlighted the importance of households as basic economic and social units and often the locus of production and consumption (Hirth, ed. 2009). The current stream of domestic-scale research has reaffirmed notions of the importance of production/resource diversity in the Mesoamerican economy (e.g., Sanders 1968:93) having a human as well as an environmental basis (see Fisher et al. 2009). 
Recent perspectives, drawn heavily from the empirical record of house excavations, emphasize the importance of domestic craft production and multicrafting in the ancient Mesoamerican economy (Balkansky and Croissier 2009; Feinman 1999; Feinman and Nicholas 2007; Hirth, ed. 2009). With a diverse suite of craft activities situated in dis­persed household contexts, the ability of rulers to

intervene or regulate such production seems nearly impossible, given the transport and communication technologies available, particularly where craft­working depends on widely available resources such as plants or clay. We do not expectthat all com­modities had identical production and distribution patterns; there may have been more restricted mate­rials that had greater potential for control. We argue that production as a whole was not tightly controlled and there is little evidence that any one commod­ity, whether as a raw material or as a finished good, so greatly influenced the economy that control over it constituted economic domination. 
Ongoing studies have found that individual households were involved simultaneously in sev­eral craft activities, producing a number of goods for immediate household consumption as well as wider exchange (Feinman and Nicholas 2007; Ino­mata 2007b). This perspective on multicrafting envisions households as "primarily concerned with their own success and thus striving to minimize risk and maximize productivity resulting in a diver­sified production strategy" (Hirth 2009:23; Shi­mada 2007). 
Few scholars have drawn on ethnographic stud­ies of the Oaxaca Valley from the early to mid-twentieth century that indicate that such diver­sified production strategies and mechanisms of dis­tribution and integration were vital to the functioning of the economy (Beals 1970, 1975; Cook 1970; Cook and Diskin 1975; Parsons 1936). The nature of the Oaxaca Valley environment would seem to be compatible with flexible strate­gies of production (Beals 1975:20-21, 56--57) and a range of integrative mechanisms to meet the sub­sistence needs of its inhabitants in the face of highly variable and unpredictable conditions (e.g., Cohen and Browning 2007:233). This variation manifests itself spatially, seasonally, and annually (e.g., Kirkby 1973; Kowalewski 1982; Nicholas 1989). 
These ethnographic studies of Oaxaca and else­where in highland Mexico provide a resource for future considerations of the prehispanic economy, in that both the past and present economic strate­gies in these regions have featured production and exchange under variable and fluctuating conditions (e.g., Cook 1970; Kirkby 1973). 
Our analysis of spindle whorls conceptualizes the implications of household activities at multiple scales, from local units to the region. We examine the ramifications of these data for ideas regarding economic distribution as well as to challenge the role traditionally ascribed to craft activities and the exploitation of xerophytic plants in prehispanic Mesoamerican economies. 
The examination and division of whorls into 
fiber-specific categories serve to illustrate that a 
range of materials, both local and imported, were 
spun at El Palmillo. Variation in whorl frequencies 
and sizes across different household contexts pro­
vides a basis for examining the relationship of sta­
tus to production, distribution, and consumption. 
In regard to access and economic status, the dif­
ferences at El Palmillo are continuous rather than 
marked by a stark dichotomy between distinct eco­
nomic classes. These findings challenge a central 
tenet of the redistributive model that postulates a 
sharply divided socioeconomic structure with a 
large producer group and a small administrative 
elite. 
Eastern Tlacolula and the 
Importance of Xerophytic Plants 

El Palmillo lies at the eastern edge of the Tlacolula arm of the Valley of Oaxaca, Mexico (Figure 1). Although Tlacolula is the driest arm in the valley, this area was one of the most densely inhabited dur­ing the Classic and Postclassic (Feinman and Nicholas 2004b; Kowalewski et al. 1989). The cen­trally situated city of Monte Alban retained degrees of political hegemony over this part of the valley during the first half of the Classic period. But coin­cident with (ca. AD. 700-1000) and then follow­ing Monte Alban's decline, some of the region's most important prehispanic settlements were situ­ated in the eastern arm . 
Low and irregular rainfall in eastern Tlacolula makes conditions too dry to sustain consistently ample maize harvests today, and irrigation oppor­tunities are spatially restricted and generally small in scale (Druijven and Kruithof 1992; Kirkby 1973; Nicholas 1989). Such conditions likely pre­vailed during most of the Classic and Postclassic, and one sixteenth-century account states that the people in the vicinity of Mitla did not consume much maize (Horcasitas and George 1955). In lieu of maize, the Classic and Postclassic populations of eastern Tlacolula depended on diverse drought­resistant plants (Feinman and Nicholas 2004b;

Prehispanic demographic expansion may have been fostered in this dry area only when val­ley-wide political integration and modes of ade­quate distribution were established under Monte Alban's hegemony during the Classic period. East­ern Tlacolula, which had been relatively sparsely settled before the Classic period, experienced more rapid demographic growth thereafter (Feinman and Nicholas 2005). 
Archaeologists have viewed the triad of maize, squash, and beans as the foundation of Mesoamer­ican civilization. And while we do not dispute the critical importance of these crops, we join a grow­ing number of researchers who recognize the sig­nificance of xerophytic (drought-resistant) plants, particularly maguey, as having been a key to the ancient Mesoamerican economy, serving as much more than a starvation food (Evans 1992; Feinman and Nicholas 2005; Feinman et al. 2007; Hernan­dez 1959 [1577]). Xerophytic plants yield many important subsistence products, and maguey meets a variety of human needs, from calories to housing to fiber (Hough 1908; Parsons 2009). More specif­ically, the many species of maguey can be used as a source of liquid (aguamiel), caloric sustenance (pulque and roasted maguey hearts), fuel (dried leaves serve as firewood), shelter (dried leaves can provide roofing and windbreaks), cords and con­tainers (fibers can be used for rope and netting), and clothing (from fibers extracted from the leaves). 
Of the many maguey products, cloth was one of particular utilitarian, economic, and sociopolit­ical importance during the Classic period and later (Berdan 1987; Stark et al. 1998). For the Aztec, varieties of cloth, a good that was both labor inten­sive to craft and portable, served as a medium of exchange. Given this function, indicative of widely recognized value, producers potentially were con­nected to exchange networks extending beyond the community. Woven goods of maguey were traded for items with greater caloric value than the plant had itself (Evans 1992). In Mesoamerica, rope and cloth production most often took place in house-

El Palmillo 
El Palmillo (Feinman and Nicholas 2004b; Fein­man et al. 2002) is situated on a steep ridge (ele­vation 1,760-2,010 m) overlooking the modem town of Santiago Matatlan (Figure 2). The site was occupied for centuries but most densely settled dur­ing the Classic period, when it was one of the largest sites in the valley. The location is rocky and ele­vated above the valley floor. Xerophytic plants sur­vive and thrive on the promontory today, growing particularly well on abandoned prehispanic walls. The diversity of economically useful plants on the site is much greater than found on neighboring ridges where prehispanic occupation was sparse or absent. During a botanical survey, eight species of maguey were identified at El Palmillo; in contrast, only two species were recorded for a neighboring hill (Middleton et al. 2001), indicating that some of the maguey species likely were brought to El Palmillo from elsewhere in the region and planted at the site during its occupation. The prehispanic occupants of El Palmillo appear to have actively tended xerophytic plants, cultivating a diverse array of useful species at the site. They could have been grown on terrace walls, on uninhabited slopes, and as living fences that provided privacy and a hedge against sediment erosion. 
Although El Palmillo was mostly abandoned by the Postclassic period, its people and craft legacy did not move far. The name of the surrounding modem town, Matatlan, means "Place of the nets" in Nahuatl, indicating that fiber working persisted in the area. Furthermore, even today xerophytic plants play an important role in the local economy. Matatlan is currently known as the world capital of mezcal, an alcoholic beverage made from dis­tilled juices extracted from the maguey plant.

LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 23, No. 4, 2012 
To explore household production, eight resi­dential terraces were completely excavated over 10 seasons of fieldwork (1999-2008) at El Palmillo. The excavated terraces were selected from a cross section of the site ranging from near the base to the partially flattened top. Generally, status followed the gradient of the hill (Feinman and Nicholas 2009; Feinman et al. 2008), with three high-status residences near the top (Platform 11, Structure 35, Terrace 335) and five commoner residences below (Terraces 507 and 925 on the middle slope of the hill and Terraces 1162, 1163, and 1147 /48 situated near the base). The three upper residences not only were larger and more elaborate (with larger patios, masonry tombs, and greater numbers of rooms) but had higher frequencies of obsidian, bone orna­ments, greenstone, and shell.Access to these items as well as quantities of animal bone decreased in a clinal pattern from the houses at the top to those near the bottom (Feinman et al. 2008). All eight households were involved in craft activities, most notably cloth/fiber work and chipped-stone tool manufacture. The nature and intensity of such pro­duction varied from house to house (Feinman and Nicholas 2007:109), with one domestic unit also engaged in low-intensity pottery manufacture and others engaged in lapidary work. 
Mesoamerican Spindle Whorls and the El Palmillo Collection 
Prehispanic fibers and cloth from the Oaxaca Val­ley rarely preserve; however, ceramic spindle whorls and bone tools are more durable and serve as the most abundant evidence of ancient spinning and cloth production activities. A series of studies have examined the relationship between tools related to cloth production, illuminating aspects of the process and organization of production (Brew­ington 2000; Fauman-Fichman 1999; McCafferty and McCafferty 2000; Parsons 1972; Smith and Hirth 1988). 
In a pioneering study, Mary Parsons (1972) iso­lated particular characteristics of spindle whorls (weight, diameter, hole diameter) as a means of determining the nature of whorl rotation and the kind offiber spun.Additionally, she created a typol­ogy based on both stylistic attributes and physical characteristics and compared the relationship between such physical attributes and stylistic traits (form and decoration). She found that the whorls had a bimodal distribution, falling roughly into two categories. These categories corresponded to cer­tain stylistic types. Parsons (1 972) concluded that this statistical pattern represented two distinct groupings linked to use: one for cotton and another for maguey. She and others have noted the social distinction between these two fibers, with cotton tied to higher status and maguey tied to lower sta­tus (Berdan 1987; Stark et al. 1998). Parsons's work has provided the basis for many subsequent stud­ies, and our current investigation builds on her gen­eral approach by comparing quantitative and qualitative whorl characteristics to assess possible whorl function. At El Palmillo, the physical char­acteristics of the whorls (weight vs. hole diameter) reveal a broad distribution of whorl sizes indica­tive of their use for spinning a variety of fibers (Figure 3). 
Although all whorl attributes shed light on whorl function, weight is a key factor in limiting the type of fibers a spinner is able to use and the quality of thread produced. Parsons ( 1972) noted the poten­tial for variation within the defined whorl groups, and subsequent studies have explored this varia­tion as well as refined our understanding of how whorls work and what we can learn from them (Brewington 2000; Fauman-Fichman 1999; Halperin 2008; King 2008; McCafferty and Mccafferty 2000; Parsons and Parsons 1990; Smith and Hirth 1988; Tiedemann and Jakes 2006). The fibers themselves hold some clues. Cotton is called a short-staple fiber, making it more fragile and thus slightly more difficult to spin (Smith and Hirth 1988). As a result, cotton is spun using a lighter whorl and a technique called support spin­ning. The lighter whorl prevents the fibers from breaking, and support spinning provides the spin­ner with more control over the whorl. Conversely, maguey is a long-staple fiber, and it requires a heav­ier whorl to maintain rotation in the spinning process. Maguey can be spun using two techniques: support spinning and drop spinning. Even fine maguey spun using support spinning requires a heavier whorl than cotton (McCafferty and Mccaf­ferty 2000; Parsons and Parsons 1990; Smith and Hirth 1988). Given the importance of whorl weight in spinning, we employ it as the dimension most indicative of the specific fiber that was spun with a particular whorl.

Figure 3. Spindle whorls at El Palmillo have a fairly continuous distribution (weight vs. hole diameter) and were used for a range of fibers including cotton and maguey. 
In an ethnographic study of maguey spinners in central Mexico, Parsons and Parsons (1990) defined a clear relationship among whorl size, vari­ation, and spinner preference. Informants were able to spin a range of maguey thread thicknesses on prehispanic whorls, but most expressed a prefer­ence for whorls of the same weight when asked to spin a particular thread weight. The whorls that most women refused to use were on the two extremes of the weight range. To refine our under­standing of whorl use requires a balance between acknowledging whorl functional flexibility and drawing conclusions about how a whorl was likely used. Parsons and Parsons (1990) provide a start­ing point for defining groups that accommodate a wider variety of fibers and offer expectations for significant trends within a sample. 
A total of 188 spindle whorls were collected during the excavations of the residential complexes at El Palmillo (180 are from the eight excavated houses, and eight are from surface or other con­texts). Every excavated terrace contained multiple spindle whorls. Generally, the spindle whorls have a flat disk shape (Brewington 2000); however, despite this fairly ubiquitous shape, the whorls were produced using two different methods. Group 1 whorls were made by abrading a broken sherd and drilling a hole (usually biconical) in the center. This type of whorl is often referred to as a centrally per­forated sherd disk (Halperin 2008:115; Figure 4). Group 2 whorls are modeled and perforated while the clay is still wet (Figure 5), identified by a lip of clay around the center hole. These physical and qualitative properties have implications for the nature of spinning and cloth production at El Palmillo and provide the basis for our analysis. 
Spindle Whorl Analysis 
In our analysis of the spindle whorl collection from El Palmillo, we explore whorl variability and note several spatial and temporal trends. We consider these data in the context of status, access to resources, the diversity of household activities, and exchange, factors that are central to current mod­els of prehispanic economies. Beyond the general distribution of tools across all households, tool characteristics should simultaneously reflect the exploitation of a range of resources as well as the nature of status differentiation and its role in pro-
