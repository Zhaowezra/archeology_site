REASSESSING SAN ESTEVAN'S ROLE IN THE LATE FORMATIVE 
POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY OF NORTHERN BELIZE 

Robert M. Rosenswig and Douglas J. Kennett 
We reassess San Estevan's role within the Late Formative period political geography of northern Belize. This medium-sied site has been interpreted as a subsidiary center to Nohmul that ruled the area along with Cerros, Lamanai, and Col ha (Scar­borough 1991 ). It has also been suggested that scores of autonomous polities existed in the region at this time ( McAnany 1995). We examine these contrasting models in light of our recent excavations in the central precinct <f San Estevan. These excavations reveal a stratigraphic sequence of Middle through Late Formative period deposits. Excavations document that the central part of the site was plastered over after 50 cal. B. C.-at roughly the same time as monumental construction pro­
jects were also started at Cerros, Nohmul, and Lamanai. San Estevan's central Mound XV was built on these plaster sur­faces during the Late Formative period as was the adjacent ballcourt. Based on our new excavation data we suggest that San Estevan was an independent polity during the Late Formative period. Further, we propose that San Estevan competed, and engaged in warfare, with other medium and large regional centers and was one of -I2 independent polities forming a political patchwork across northern Belize.

2002) expanding the number of documented cen­ters from the better-known Late Formative occu­pations at Calakmul (Folan et al. 1995) and Becan (Webster 1976). To the south, sites such as Homul and Ci val (Estrata-Belli 2006), San Bartolo (Satumo et al. 2006), and more recently at ChaakAk' al (John­ston 2006), add to the long-known Late Formative period occupation of Uaxactun (Smith 1950) and Tikal (Laporte and Fialko 1995; Laporte and Valdes 
1993). An increasingly complex picture of Late For­mative Maya political geography is coming more clearly into focus (Johnston 2006: 177). 
The subject of this paper is the Late Formative occupation of northern Belize, to the east of the Mirador Basin. This region was intensively stud­ied during the 1970s and 1980s, and publications from such sites as Cerros, Colha, K' axob, Lamanai, and Nohmul are voluminous compared to other parts of the Maya lowlands (see references below). We recently began investigating the Formative­period occupation of San Estevan, located in the very center of these sites in northern Belize. Below, 
we present some preliminary results and evaluate three models that describe the local Late Forma­tive political geography. 
San Estevan and Northern Belize during the 
Late Formative Period 

The San Estevan site is located on the New River 30 km south of the Bay of Chetumal (Figure 2)'. William Bullard (1965) mapped its civic­ceremonial center in the 1960s and restored two Early Classic structures. Norman Hammond (1975) then excavated at San Estevan and expanded Bullard's map with several additional plaza groups around the site core. It was the ceramic collections from these excavations at San Estevan along with initial testing at Nohmul, Santa Rita, Colha, and Cuello that Duncan Pring used to first establish the Swazey, Bladen, Lopez Mamom, and Cocos Chi­cannel phases (Kosakowsky 1987:9). Hammond (1975:42) classified San Estevan as a Level 8 "medium major ceremonial center" larger than Colha and smaller than Nohmul. Next, Laura Levi ( 1993, 1996, 2002) mapped outlying house groups at San Estevan and excavated several domestic structures. Based on her analysis of the architec­tural layout of these groups, Levi (2003) argued that San Estevan, along with the southern portion of Pulltrouser swamp (i.e., K' axob and Kokeal),

formed one political unit by the Classic period, and that Nohmul, along with the northern part of Pull­trouser swamp (i.e., Tibaat), formed another polity. Based on the wide distribution of Late Formative pottery across the site and civic ceremonial archi­tecture of the same age, Scarborough ( 1991: 181-190) suggested that this was a second­order center within the Late Formative Nohmul polity, subsequently an independent first-order cen­ter during the Early Classic period. 
San Estevan is located close to midway between the two largest Late Formative sites on the New River: Lamanai -40 km to the southwest (Penderc gast 1981) and Cerros -30 km to the northwest (Robertson and Freidel 1986). The site is also -15 km overland from Nohmul (Hammond et al. 1988; Pyburn 1989, 1990) to the northwest, and Colha is -20 km to the southeast (Shafer and Hester 1983, 1991; Valdez 1988). San Estevan is thus located between the four largest Late Formative sites in northern Belize and is also close to Cuello (Ham­mond 1991a; Kosakowsky 1987; Kosakowsky and Pring 1991, 1998), Kichpanha (Reese and Valdez 1987), and sites within Pull trouser Swamp (Turner and Harrison 1981, 1983), including K'axob only 4 km from San Estevan's core (Lopez 1996, 2005; McAnany 2004; McAnany and Lopez 1999). 
During the late 1990s, much of the monumen­tal architecture in San Estevan's core was bulldozed and a large crater was excavated for the underly­ing limestone marl (Figure 3). Mound XV, at 15 m, is the highest remaining structure. The damage is unfortunate but provides remarkable access to the earliest occupation at the site's center. In 1999, we noted an orange soil horizon below stratified occu­pation levels. Such orange soils are associated with Archaic deposits elsewhere in northern Belize (Rosenswig and Masson 200 I). Taking advantage of the easy access to the earliest occupation levels, Rosenswig and three workmen drew profiles pro­duced by the bulldozer cuts and excavated two test pits in 2002 (Figure 4). These excavations con­firmed the existence of orange soil as well as intact Middle and Late Formative period deposits (Rosenswig 2004).

Albany field school, in collaboration with Douglas Kennett and students from the University of Ore­gon, spent six weeks excavating Middle and Late Formative period deposits in the center of San Este­van (Rosenswig 2007a). Substantial Middle For­mative period domestic deposits were documented including a 70-cm-deep midden and a cobble sur­face with an intact stone wall alignment (Rosenswig 2008). We also discovered that part of the west ballcourt bench remained intact despite the bull­dozing, and further, established that this architec­tural feature had been built during the Late Formative period. During excavations in the mid­dle of the Mound XV's east side we discovered a Chicanel period cache (Cache 1), associated with the Mound XV's earliest documented monumen­tal construction episode. 
We describe the contents and arrangement of Cache 1, present its stratigraphic context, and explore the relationship of Mound XV to the ball­court and repeated Late Formative period plaster­ing episodes of the site center. We also present the associated ceramic cross-dating assessments and AMS dates to help define these events temporally. 
Elsewhere, Rosenswig (2008) discusses evidence of the early and late Middle Formative (see Figure 5) domestic occupation recovered from dark mid­den soils below the recently bulldozed civic­ceremonial architecture. 
The second half of this paper assesses San Este­van's place in the Late Formative political geogra­phy of northern Belize and outlines three hypotheses that describe its political organization. Our intention is twofold: to present recently recov­ered data from San Estevan, and to establish a framework for future research. Ultimately, it will be necessary to determine how Late Formative political centers in northern Belize articulated with the rise of the much larger polities in the Mirador Basin. However, for the purpose of this paper we assume that Late Formative period polities in north­ern Belize were operating independently of direct external interference and focus on local political organization. To bolster this contention of non­interference from distant polities, we point to the case Pyburn et al. (1998:53) make that it was only during the Early Classic period that settlement changes in the region (e.g., ruralisation at Nohmul

San Estevan 2005-Mound XV and Cache 1 
A 1.5-x-6 m trench, designated Suboperation 8, was excavated axially at the east base of Mound 
XV. At the bottom of this trench, a dark midden soil containing Middle Formative period pottery was documented between bedrock (2.3 m below the current ground surface) and two thin plaster floors. Above this, a series of four monumental construction episodes were documented. Each episode consists of limestone cobbles, earthen fill, and copious amounts of plaster. Distinct construc­tion episodes were divided by even surfaces with evidence of dark organic soil on white plaster, which suggests occupied surfaces. Middle and Late Formative pottery sherds within the construction fill of the first two building episodes date these to the establishment of Mound XV in the Late For­mative period. Cache I is consistent with those at Cuello as "dedicatory offerings for the successive raisings and enlargements of buildings" (Hammond 1999:60). That caches were interred at the time of monumental building episodes indicates that these construction events were imbued with ritual and/or political significance. 
We discovered Cache I in the center of Mound XV's east edge, within the top of the first monu­mental construction episode (Figure 6). This fea­ture allows for the temporal assignment of Mound XV, by ceramic cross-dating, to the Late Forma­tive period. It is possible that smaller, Middle, and/or earlier Late Formative period structures are buried within the core of this mound and predate the building episodes we have documented. How­ever, the construction level that buried Cache 1 marks the first time that Mound XV reached its cur­rent horizontal dimensions. 

Cache I Contents 
Cache 1 consisted of five ceramic vessels and three ceramic disks. Two "bucket" vessels (Figure 7 a-b) were originally placed lip to lip and are identical in size, form, and finish to Society Hall Red dishes reported from Cuello (Kosakowsky 1987:Figures 
6.12and6.13). Three "amphora" jars (Figure7c--e) also recovered from Cache 1 are virtually identi­cal in shape to one found in Early Facet Chicane! Mass Burial I at Cuello (Kosakowsky 1987:Fig­ure 29a). These vessels are all approximately the same size-the one from Cuello is 20 cm high whereas the San Estevan vessels are 17.5 cm (Ves­sel #3), 18.5 cm (Vessel #4), and 13.5 cm (Vessel #5) in height (see Figure 7). These Sierra Red amphora vessels are rare, and, in her ceramic mono­graph Kosakowsky (1987:83) commented on the one from Cuello that: "I know of no other vessel of this shape from the Maya Lowlands." 
Three ceramic disks were also recovered from Cache 1 (Figure 7f-h). Two were stacked, placed slip-side down within the lower bucket vessel and leaning against its east side. The third was placed outside the bucket vessel and 10 cm to the east. The disks measure 8, 9, and 9 cm in diameter and fall within the range of the 123 disks from Cerros recov­ered from nondomestic contexts (Garber l 989:Fig­ure 26). Ninety percent of the sherd disks larger than 5 cm in diameter documented at Cerros were recov­ered from Late Formative contexts (Garber 1989:

Table 17). These ceramic disks could have served as lids for narrow-mouthed vessels (Garber 1984:83). The amphora jars deposited in Cache 1 have rim diameters of 8, 9, and 9 cm-precisely the same as the disks. The disks would therefore have provided perfect covers for the amphora ves­sels. It is plausible to suggest that these vessels contained a liquid employed in the ritual enacted after the construction episode that enlarged Mound XV to its current horizontal extents, and then, that the empty vessels and their lids were interred as part of a dedication ceremony. The disks were not directly associated with the amphora vessels, so that their use as lids is inferred based on size and shape. The fact that the disks were not found next to the amphora vessels means that their placement in the cache was purposeful. In contrast, Cache 1 at Cer ­ros's Structure 6B contained five ceramic vessels, three of which had sherd lids directly associated with vessels (see Freidel et al. 2002:Figure 3.16). 
Arrangement and Orientation of Cache 1 Contents 
The three amphoras were equally spaced around 
. the bucket vessels and their openings all faced west, while the three disks were placed in the east side of the cache (Figure 6). The eastward orientation of the disks and westward-facing direction of the amphora vessel openings represent some aspect of the ideological system of the people who interred Cache I. Chase and Chase (1998:3 14) note that the Late Formative caches associated with monumen­tal architecture are the most elaborate excavated at Caracol and "have contents that are layered, and/or ordered in such a way as to suggest an intentional plan or design reflecting both directional order and placement." Freidel and Schele ( 1988 :557) further discuss the importance of east and west orientation of Late Formative Maya caches. East is the direc­tion of the rising sun and the direction that later Mesoamerican peoples oriented their maps. The ris­ing sun is associated with the emergence of life (Schele and Freidel 1990:66, 426), and so, could 
also have been metaphorically linked to the birth of a new (political) age at San Estevan when mon­umental architecture (and the political power that commissioned it) was first constructed.

around the two buckets and could be interpreted as the "Three Hearthstones" of creation represented celestially in Orion (Freidel et al. 1993:Figures 2:14, 2:15, 2:16, and 2:17). As Freidel et al. (1993:67) note: "As the hearthstones surround the cooking fir and establish the center of the house, so the three stone throne of creation centered the cosmos and allowed the sky to be lifted from the Primordial sea." This, they recount, is still relevant today among Yucatec farmers who pile stones to mark the center of their fields before clearing and planting them (Freidel et al. 1993: 130). Regardless of the specific emic interpretation, Cache 1 was interred as part of the earliest monumental con­struction episode we have documented at San Este­van's Mound XV. 

Dating San Estevan Cache 1 and Ballcourt 
We argue that Cache 1 dates tQ the middle of the Late Formative period based on four lines of evi­dence .. First, the three amphora vessels within Cache 1 are unusual; the only other vessel known of this type was recovered from the Chicanel Mass Burial 1 at Cuello. This amphora vessel was recov­ered at the feet of one of the two principle individ­uals interred in Mass Burial 1 (Robin and Hammond 1991:Figures 10.4 and 10.5). Cuello's Mass Burial 1 also contained a bucket vessel sim­ilar to those from Cache 1 at San Estevan (Kosakowsky and Pring 199l:Figure 3.39e). 
Second, in addition to similarities in both ves­sel forms, the mass burial at Cuello "marked the construction of Platform 34 and a change in archi­tectural layout from the Middle Preclassic patio group to the broad open platform of the Late For­mative" (Robin and Hammond 1991 :211). The same vessel types mark the transition to Late For­mative period public architecture at both sites. At Cuello, another mass burial within a later Chicanel platform occurs above the location of Mass Burial 1 and was later marked with a stone monument (Robin and Hammond 1991 :211 ). This suggests rit­ual continuity at this location starting at the end of the Middle Formative period. 
The third and forth lines of evidence dating Cache 1 are stratigraphic. Cache 1 was found within the first Late Formative construction episodes of Mound XV (see Figure 6). This indicates that the cache predates at least one Late Formative period construction episode undertaken to enlarge Mound XV. The final line of evidence is that the construc­tion episode that Cache 1 is associated with occurs directly on top of two widely occurring thin plas­ter surfaces in the site center that seal Middle For­mative (900-300 B.C.) middens. The second plaster surface itself dates to cal. 50 B.C.-A.D. 40 (see below). 
Suboperations 4 and 5, southeast of Mound XV, document three distinct plaster surfaces on top of a dark midden containing Middle Formative period pottery (Figure 8). The most complex Middle to Late Formative stratigraphy we documented was at Suboperation 3 (Figure 9). In these units, two thin plaster surfaces seal a dark midden containing a cobble surface and a stone wall alignment dating to the Middle Formative (Rosenswig 2008). On top of the second plaster surface are the remains of San Estevan's ballcourt and the first construction episode documented at Mound XV. 
The stratigraphic sections exposed across San Estevan in 2005 indicate that a substantial portion (i.e., over 250 sq m) of what became the site center was plastered multiple times after the Middle For­mative period, thus defining the center of the site (Rosenswig 2007a). This is similar to what occurred at Cuello beginning in the Late Formative period (Hammond and Gerhart 1990). At Suboperation 8, there was no evidence of occupation on the final plaster surface prior to the first monumental con­struction episode (Figure 6). At Suboperations 3 and 8, two plastering events are documented below Cache 1 and the ballcourt. At other areas, such as Suboperation 4 and 5, we documented three plas­tering episodes above a Middle Formative period dark midden (Figure 8). Architectural construction and large-scale plastering (and replastering) at the center of San Estevan thus occurred periodically. Both construction and maintenance would have required substantial labor expenditures. 
AMS Radiocarbon Dates 
Four AMS dates were run on wood charcoal recov­ered from flotation samples collected during the 2002 season (Rosenswig 2004). Three samples were taken from a 1-x-2-m test unit (# 17900, 17901, and 17902) and a fourth (#17903) from soil collected from the profile at the edge of the bull­dozed crater (Figure 4 ). Two of the samples con­tained modern carbon. These modern samples were from levels selected before we realized how exten-

sively disturbance was. Of the two good samples, one dates to the Middle Formative period and the other to the Late Formative period (Table 1). 
The Middle Formative date came from Stratum D, a 10-15 cm dark brown midden on which the cobble surface was built (see location in Figure 9). The age range for this date is 800-760 cal. B.C. (2­sigma). In uncalibrated radiocarbon years (in which Formative phase limits are often discussed) this 2­sigma date range is 640-580 B.C. This date fits with the established regional ceramic chronology at the end of the early Middle Formative period. Stratum D contains diagnostic early Middle Formative pot­tery types with square rims, short, vertical-necked jars with exterior thickened rims, double cylinder strap handles (Copetilla U nslipped), as well as dec­oration executed using post-slip incisions (Back­landing Incised) (Rosenswig 2008). The cobble surface was laid down after this, and so, dates to the late Middle Formative Mamom period. 
The charcoal that produced the Late Formative radiocarbon date was collected from a light gray fill beneath a plaster surface documented in the quarry wall on the west edge of Suboperation 2 and 3 (see location in Figure 4). This 5-10 cm thick level did not contain diagnostic ceramics and was designated Stratum C. It is located above the cob­ble surface and directly below the plaster floor that underlies San Estevan's ballcourt. The 2-sigma cor­rected age of 50 B.C.-A.D. 40 thus dates the ball­court to the Late Formative Chicane! period. The date of 50 B.C. also corresponds to the major con­struction phase at Cerros (Scarborough 1983:736) and when the Late Formative Structure Nl0-43 was built at Lamanai (Pendergast 1981 ). This tem­poral correspondence in the initiation of monu­mental construction projects at the three largest sites on the New River suggests that inhabitants of this waterway were responding to similar local events by building the first monumental mounds at each site. 
San Estevan and the 
Late Formative Political Geography 

Major political changes occurred in northern Belize during the Late Formative compared to the pre­ceding Middle Formative period. Scarborough (1983 :720) described this "as a time of coalescence which culminated in the technological and socio-

logical achievements of the Classic Maya." Cerros, with its elaborate stuccoed masks at Structure SC-2nd, emerged as a center at this time (Schele and Freidel 1990). Freidel and Schele (1988:49) proposed that it was during the first century B.C. that the concept of lordship (Ahaw) was instituted to explain the contradiction between an ethos of egalitarianism and the obvious social hierarchy established by the elite in the area. This resulted in a significant increase in mound construction at many southern lowland Maya centers. As noted above, this is precisely when monumental archi­tecture was first built at Lamanai, Cerros, and San Estevan. It is also when the large central platform was built at Nohmul (Hammond et al. 1987, 1988; Pyburn 1990) and the more modest architecture erected at Cuello (Hammond and Gerhardt 1990). During the Late Formative, residents of the nearby community of K' ax ob also constructed a modest platform (Aizpunia and McAnany 1999:122) and changed their burial tradition from isolated extended burials to pit burials containing multiple individuals (McAnany 1995:55). Two mass buri­als at Cuello also date to the Late Formative (Ham­
mond 1999; Robin and Hammond 1991). Stone crypts were also first used to bury select individu­als at Cuello at this time (Robin 1989:22). The "eye-catching" differences in Chicane! ceramics (e.g., vessel size, form, and surface finish) from K'axob, Cuello, Colha, and Cerros are interpreted as creating distinct identities (Bartlett and McAnany 2000: 108-114 ). Further, INAA suggest that ceramics from these same sites were less chem­ically diverse during the Late Formative compared to the earlier Middle Formative vessels sampled (Bartlett et al. 2000), suggesting increasingly for­malized ceramic production occurred at this time. The first monumental architecture coupled with changing mortuary patterns and increased identity of elites at individual polities through the region indicates the changing social and political prac­tices in northern Belize. 
It is within this dynamic political and ideolog­ical environment that a large portion of San Este­van's central precinct was established by laying down a series of plaster floors and erecting a cen­tral mound and a ballcourt. We now review how scholars have interpreted the political geography
