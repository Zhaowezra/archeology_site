But once this rather ambiguous defin­ition has been stated, no effort is made to see what this“premodern variant” of market economy might be, oreveniftheterm“marketeconomy”isvalidatall(whichIactuallyreallydoubt),afterwhichmanychaptersseemto consider that a market exchange implies a marketeconomy.I am not certain that prices were regulated bysupply and demand mechanisms. There was probablysome competition between the agents of exchange, butwe cannot postulate that there was any kind of freeexchange (i.e., no state intervention) with prices beingauto­regulatedbysupplyanddemandthatwouldimpactthe volume of production. We simply do not knowenough about all those aspects of the economy to takethat for granted!The more so since many authors stressthefactthatothermodesofexchangeprobablyprevailed(Eppich and Freidel; King), that we have no way ofknowing whether prices were fixed or not (King), andthat the supervision of the elite was, in certain cases,very probable (Becker; Jones).

JoanM. Gero is oneof the best­knowntheorists incon­temporary U.S. archaeology. Recipient of the LifetimeAchievement Award from the World ArchaeologicalCongress, her contributions to critical archaeology andthe archaeology of gender are widely recognized, andher articles are required reading in university seminarsfocusing on post­processual archaeology. Unlike sometheorists, Gero also has maintained an active career inthe field, carrying out investigations in diverse areasincludingBritain,Labrador,Peru,andArgentina,aswellasSouthCarolina.Nonetheless,hertheoreticalwritingshave been more influential (and frequent) than her sub­stantive contributions to world prehistory.

AsIanticipated,Gerohasproducedafascinatingandhighlyoriginalvolumethatdiffersfromtraditionalmono­graphs as much in its organization and style as in theideas that it presents. The book is divided into ten sec­tions, each of which is broken into short “bits” two tosix pages in length. The 100 bits that make up the bookaresubdividedinto10categories:Framework,Narrative,Socio­politics, Backstory, Argument, Episode, AndeanWays, Data (Raw or Descriptive), Exclamation Point,and Wrap­Up. These classes of bits are intermixed andtheir sequence and number vary from one section toanother. Gero emphasizes the importance of the bits asanorganizingprinciplebyidentifyingeachbitclasswithan emoji­like icon that appears atthe top of every page.For example, theArgument bits are emblazoned with awoman shouting through a bullhorn, Socio­politics bitsare represented by an inverted depiction of the SouthAmerican continent, and the Andean Ways are markedbya standingllama.

itative narrative. Instead, the reader is offered a crazyquiltof information andinsights and then challenged todraw from it her or his own set of impressions. Thisstructural innovation resonates with Gero’s main theo­reticalfocus,theinevitableambiguitythatexistsindoingarchaeologyandthedifficultyofproducingarchaeolog­ical knowledge about the past.
TheuseofbitsmakesitpossibleforGerotovarythestyle of writing in ways that would be inconceivable ina standard monograph. Some sections adopt a literarystyle bordering on the poetic that evokes the beauty oftheAndeanlandscape,theexcitementofarchaeologicaldiscovery, and the complexities of social interactionsbetweenarchaeologistsandlocalresidents.Inothersec­tions, Gero adopts a descriptive style resembling thatusedbyethnographerstodescribelocalAndeanlifewayssuchastheritualsmadebyworkmentothePachamamaat the initiation and conclusion of excavations. In still other sections, Geroemploys the academicstyle oflan­guageemployedincriticalarchaeologyinordertoarguethat all archaeological fieldwork carried out in LatinAmericabyforeignersfrom“richandpowerfulnations”suchastheUnitedStatesandEuropeancountriesisinher­entlyimperialistic,regardlessoftheirmotivationsorthewaytheytreatthelocalpopulation.Instillotherbits,drydetailed descriptions of excavations are offered in thestyle typical of field reports.
Yutopian isbasedonextensivefieldworkcarriedout attwoEarlyFormativesitesin1994,1996,1998,1999,and 2004 within the District of Catamarca in northwest Argentina.Theculturesfromthisperiodoftime(approx­imately 200 B.C.–A.D. 500) were poorly understoodwhenGerobeganherresearchbutwereusuallyconcep­tualized as small­scale societies lacking in state organi­zation and surviving on a mixed economy of maize,herding, and hunting. The populations were thought tohave been organized into dispersed homesteads. At3,200 m above sea level, the site ofYutopian is locatedin a high arid valley with barely enough water for sub­sistenceagriculture.Todaythisremoteareaisonlylightlyinhabited,butthearchaeologicalinvestigationsreportedhere suggest a larger population in the prehistoric past.
The archaeological efforts by the binational U.S.­Argentine team directed by Gero and Cristina Scattolinwere largely devoted to the excavation of householdunitsandpublicspacesatYutopian;forpurposesofcom­parison,fieldworkwasextendedtothecoevalandnearbysite of Cardonal.

In this book special attention is paid to the sequenceofinvestigationandthelogicbehindtheseriesofstrategicdecisions that were made. The end product is a muchmore realistic depiction offield research than is usuallypresented. Gero takes this one step further by showinghow what we know about the past at Yutopian is ulti­mately a product of the decisions that were made, con­sciously and unconsciously, and therefore that thisknowledge is contingent upon the frameworks andassumptions that shaped those decisions.
Despite Gero’s caveats about the difficulty of pro­ducing knowledge, I emerged from reading her volumewithamuchricherunderstandingoftheEarlyFormativeinnorthwestArgentina.Atthesametime,thebookholdsthe practice of archaeology up to the light in a way thatis rare in archaeological monographs. This heighteneddegreeofself­revelationandself­awarenessissometimesdisturbing and often messy. Gero never fully reconcilesherharshcondemnationofcolonialistarchaeologywithher repeated field seasons in Argentina. Similarly, herdiscussionofthesouringofherfriendshipswithArgen­tine colleagues fails to fully explore the difficulty ofnegotiating collaborative relationships within the con­temporary socio­politics ofArgentina. Yet perhaps thisiswhatismostnoteworthyaboutthisbook:noeasysolu­tions are proposed and no absolute interpretations areadvanced. The ambiguity and uncertainty of doingarchaeology and producing archaeological knowledgearefacedsquarelyandhonestly.Perhapsforthisreason,one of the best audiences for this volume will be those archaeology students whose ideas about the disciplineare still in the process of being formed.
