ital of Cusco. Tipon is identified within an area of2 km2, half of which is ancient agricultural terracing. 
The book is highly accessible and well-organized. With over 170 illustrations, the sometimes spare text is significantly enhanced. The volume consists of 12 chap­ters, the penultimate a useful distillation of aspects of Peruvian prehistory authored by established archaeol­ogist Gordon Mc Ewan. The chapters generally build on one another inclusive of a less-effective segment exam­ining ancient climate.* The focus of the volume is the monumental engineering feats associated with the con­struction, maintenance, and use of the Central Terraces; 13 "high-status" terraces bifurcating the major concen­tration of elite architecture, though covering less than 3 ha. The author emphasizes the aesthetics of the entire water management system including a careful assess­ment of canalized sources led by cut and carved andesite construction. The impressive terraces were constructed by major cut-and-fill operations complemented by altered access to both groundwater spring activity and riverine canalization. A well-defined aqueduct over 60 m in length aided in carrying water from the nearby Rio Pukara source 1.35 km away. In addition to the highly crafted stone masonry identifying the 2-4.5 m high ter­race walls, elaborately inset, non-splash drop structures as well as formally constructed fountains were built. The last third of the book reexamines several other public works including a 4.5-6 m high outer wall of uncut andesite stone work nearly 6 km long-likely erected by an earlier Wari settlement but circumscribing ancient Tipon as well. The volume ends with a chapter by Ruth Wright describing a walking tour of the site. 
The book is a highly descriptive assessment of the visible landscape at Tipon. The strength of the volume is its attempt to unify the known structures and features around the obvious import of water to the ancient Inka elite living at Tipon for at least a portion of the year. The book achieves its goal of identifying the water man­agement system drawing on previously excavated and/or reconstructed features. Those sections of the book (Chapters 4-7) that carefully measure and review water yields, quality, and control using Western hydraulic tenets provide new information and ways of examining the system. Because the author is frequently dependent on information gleaned from reconstructed surfaces, some caveat is probably necessary. Nevertheless, the interpretations provided appear reasonable and justi­fied. 
Although the volume emphasizes surface survey, it neglects the role of systematic and controlled surface finds and recordation. Given the manageable size of Tipon, surface inspection and control is likely to reveal considerable complementary information about com­munity function and organization even with the derang­ing effects of tourist traffic and farming activities. Wright makes reference to the abundance of pottery on the sur­face (p. 82), and distributional patterns are likely to iden­tify less visible features indicative of the many hidden activities not mentioned in this volume. The modest population densities conjectured for the community are not elucidated by the author, though I am assuming these figures are calculated from architectural floor spaces. But what if perishable structures were part of the mix, might artifact concentrations aid in the assessment? Based on careful archeological survey, future excavations beyond the highly visible masonry architecture could reveal a fuller inventory of cultural activities at a contained site like Tipon-activities that include hidden households as well as less-visible water courses, diversion features, and holding tanks. Archaeological surface survey, too, would aid in separating the chronology of the site given the pre-Inca legacy for the area. 
Much is made of climatic shifts through time in the Andean literature; and rightly so, given the impact of ENSO activity. Nevertheless, considerable debate revolves around the degree of resilience pre-Inca states had in the face of drought intervals. Chapter 3 ties the major benchmarks in social and technical advancement as well as societal-wide collapse to major climatic shifts-primarily drought. Although the climate trigger has replaced the population one, either remains overly simplistic. At Tipon specifically, Wright also mentions the role of microclimatic controls on several occasions throughout the book; the author states that the exposed andesite masonry absorbed the heat of the day and radi­ated warmth over the terraced fields during frigid Andean nights preventing field plots from freezing. He attrib­utes the innovation to the Tiwanaku raised field systems of Lake Titicaca several centuries before the Inca reign, but both the connective linkages for the kind of micro­climatic warming alleged for Tipon terracing warming AND the empirical testing of the specific hypothesis are lacking. Clark Erickson's uncited work has indeed shown how canals and their waters inverted warm and cold air on a diurnal basis to prevent frosts on raised field plots, but no such additional work involving ter­race masonry is reported of which I am aware. 
Although the book is not an anthropological approach to the engineered landscape and the implica­tions that an Inca estate might have for a substantive understanding of statecraft or empire building, it does provides useful information about a circumscribed water management system in antiquity. The book's accessi­bility will allow a wide readership a clearer under­standing of the complexities associated with early statecraft.
