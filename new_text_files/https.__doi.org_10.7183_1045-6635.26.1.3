A NEW ARCHAEOLOGICAL CHRONOLOGY FOR AZTEC-PERIOD 
CALIXTLAHUACA, MEXICO 

Angela C. Huster and Michael E. Smith 
We describe the development of a new chronology for the Postclassic site of Calixtlahuaca, Toluca, Mexico. We identify three ceramic phases using discriminant analysis of decorated and plainware types. These phases are consistent with exca­vated stratigraphy, as well as a series of 54 radiocarbon dates. We then assign absolute dates to the phases using Bayesian analysis of radiocarbon dates and historical information on the date of site abandonment. The resulting chronology identifies three phases at the site: Dongu (A.D.1130-1380), Ninupi (A.D. 1380-1450), and Yata (A.D.1450-1530). We then discuss the local and regional implications of the chronology. More broadly, our results demonstrate the utility of using multiple, complementary methods for developing more precise chronologies. 
Describimos el desarrollo de una cronologfa nueva para el sitio Poscldsico de Calixtlahuaca, Toluca, Mexico. ldentificamos tres grupos cerdmicos por media de la clasificaci6n automdtica tipo k-means y del andlisis discriminante de tipos sencillos y decorados. Los grupos se definieron con base en la semejanza de los tipos cerdmicos. Jnvestigamos las relaciones estratigrdficas entre los grupos, y nuestro andlisis confirm6 que hay una secuencia cronol6gica entre ellos; es decir, los grupos sonfases cro­nol6gicas. Luego presentamos 54 fechas de radiocarbono procedentes de nuestras excavaciones que tambien confirman las relaciones estratigrdficas entre las fases. Proponemos fechas absolutas para cada Jase con base en el andlisis bayesiano de las fechas de radiocarbono y datos hist6ricos sabre la fecha de abandono del sitio. La cronologia resultante identifica tres 
fases para el sitio: Dongu (1130-1380d.C.), Ninupi ( 1380-1450d.C.) e Yata ( 1450-1530d.C.). Comparamos esta cronologfa arqueol6gica con la cronologfa hist6rica de Calixtlahuaca y el Valle de Toluca. Finalmente, analizamos las implicaciones locales y regionales de la nueva cronologfa . Los resultados iluminan el desarrollo cultural en el Valle de Toluca en la epoca Postcldsica. Mds ampliamente, nuestros resultados demuestran la utilidad def uso de varios metodos complementarios para el desarrollo de cronologfas mas precisas. 
he questions archaeologists ask are in­Tcreasingly outstripping the level of detail provided by traditional chronologies. In the case of the Aztec Empire, researchers inter­ested in the process of imperial growth, or its in­fluence on trade, immigration, or quality of life, must be able to differentiate between the periods before and after the Aztec conquest of a study region. The Aztec Empire is a difficult target to identify archaeologically; the Triple Alliance formed in A.D. 1428 and fell to the Spanish in A.D. 1521.As one moves closer to the boundaries of the empire, the interval between the Aztec and Spanish conquests becomes increasingly shorter, falling below the 100-to 200-year span of most archaeological chronologies used in the region. In this paper we describe a new archaeological chronology for the Late Postclassic provincial site of Calixtlahuaca, aimed at investigating the effects of Aztec conquest. The resulting chronol­ogy identifies three phases at the site: Dongu 
(A.D. 1130-1380), Ninupi (A.D. 1380-1450), and Yata (A.D. 1450-1530). 
Calixtlahuaca 
Calixtlahuaca is a Postclassic site in the Toluca Valley of central highland Mexico (Figure 1). Ethnohistorical data from native historical tradi­tions and early colonial lawsuits indicate that the site was the dominant political center within the Toluca Valley prior to the conquest of the region

by the Triple Alliance (Mexica or Aztec Empire) in A.D. 14 76. The region remained under Mexica rule until the Spanish conquest inA.D. 1521. Cal­ixtlahuaca is located on a hill known today as Cerro Tenismo and at its maximum size covered approximately 264 hectares. The site lacks the single monumental core characteristic of many Postclassic sites; instead, it features multiple clus­ters of monumental architecture, scattered from the base to the summit of Cerro Tenismo. 
The Calixtlahuaca Archaeological Project, based at Arizona State University (ASU), con­ducted two seasons of fieldwork at the site. An intensive surface survey in 2006 documented the extent of occupation, and excavations in 2007 targeted a combination of domestic structures and terraces. This focus complemented earlier work on the monumental architecture by Jose Garcfa Pay6n in the 1930s (Garcia 1936, 1979). The 
ASU project excavated a total of 27 locations

Chronological Background 
Our work at Calixtlahuaca faced two difficulties in establishing chronological phases. The first was the relative rarity of superimposed construc­tion phases or deeply stratified middens. The ex­cavations revealed a high degree of residential mobility within the site; these patterns are dis­cussed in more detail below. 
The second chronological problem was the limited nature of previous chronological work in the Toluca Valley. Based on his excavations in the 1930s, Garcia Pay6n proposed that Calixt­lahuaca had been occupied from the Formative period through the Spanish conquest. He de­scribed a scheme of four chronological periods based on ceramic types and architectural stages, but subsequent scholars (including us) have been unable to replicate or verify this sequence. For later excavations at Teotenango directed by Roman Pifia Chan, Tommasi de Magrelli (1978) and Vargas (1975) proposed a three-phase divi­sion of the Postclassic ceramics from that site. They failed to provide any evidence (e.g., stratig­raphy, ceramic counts, radiocarbon dates) sup­porting their sequence, and it has not been repli­cated or verified by us or by others. All previous attempts at establishing ceramic chronologies in the region include a high degree of type continuity throughout the Postclassic, suggesting that rela­tive type frequencies would be more useful than phases based on their presence or absence. 
Based on Smith's 2002 study of the whole ce­ramic vessels excavated at Calixtlahuaca by Gar­cia Pay6n (Smith et al. 2003), it seemed clear that the major occupation of Calixtlahuaca dated to the Middle and Late Postclassic periods. The site lacks Early Postclassic tradewares such as 
Mazapan red-on-buff, which is found widely 
across the Toluca Valley (Sugiura 1998). In addi­
tion, it lacks the distinctive orange-on-white poly-

chromes found at the Early Postclassic site of Huamango north of the Toluca Valley (Piiia 1981), or the types assigned to the Late Classic and Epiclassic phases of the Teotenango chronol­ogy (Vargas 1975). The imported ceramics at the site are primarily Late Postclassic or Middle-and­Late Postclassic types from the Basin of Mexico, including Aztec III and III/IV black-on-orange, the Late Aztec variants of Guinda (polished red­ware) black-on-red, and Texcoco molded sahu­madores (frying-pan incense burners) (Hodge and Mine 1991). The only indication of a non-Post­classic occupation at the site was the recovery of a few Classic-period Teotihuaciin-style vessels and a group of Xoo-phase (Epiclassic) Oaxacan vessels from monumental contexts (Smith and Lind 2005). 
Gonzalez and colleagues published two ther­moluminescence dates of ceramics from unknown proveniences within the site (Gonzalez et al. 1999). These dates are A.D. 870 ± 80 and 1520 ± 
90. The description of sherd selection suggests that the researchers tried to use sherds dating from different time periods, thereby increasing the probability that their samples do not represent the mean date of occupation or the date of highest population density at the site. 
Our approach to chronology building em­ployed two steps. First, we generated a sequence of ceramic phases using quantitative ceramic se­riation supplemented by stratigraphic data and ceramic cross-ties. Then we used Bayesian mod­eling of calibrated radiocarbon dates to assign calendar dates to the ceramic phases. 
Ceramic Seriation 
Seriation is the process of chronologically order­ing archaeological contexts based on the frequen­cies of artifact types or attributes. In most cases, the technique is applied to pottery, although other types of artifacts, such as jewelry and grave lots, have also been seriated successfully. When ap­plied to ceramics, seriation may use types, vari­eties, motifs, or attributes, depending on which units are the most chronologically sensitive. Con­texts may be grouped and ordered using a variety of quantitative methods, including simple statis­tics, principal component analyses and k-means clustering, and specially written seriation alga­rithms. These methods are used to create either a continuous sequence of units or a series of groups corresponding to archaeological phases. The se­quence is then oriented chronologically based on independent information, such as stratigraphy, chronometric dates, or ceramic cross-ties with other regions. 
For Postclassic central Mexico, successful ce­ramic seriations have been carried out with both types and attributes. Smith (1983) seriated Post­classic ceramics from Xochicalco and Coatetelco in Morelos using 25 type counts and 7 ratios of ordinal-scale attributes. Then Smith and Doershuk (1991) applied the resulting ceramic phases to domestic deposits at Cuexcomate and Capilco using discriminant analysis based on 27 ceramic types. At Yautepec, Hare and Smith (1996) se­lected 14 types that seemed to have chronological significance and used them to seriate domestic deposits, identifying four phases (Middle Post­classic, Late Postclassic A, Late Postclassic B, and Early Colonial). At Chalco, Hodge (2008) employed 60 types and variants to distinguish three phases (Early, Middle, and Late Postclassic). For surface collections from the Basin of Mexico, Garraty (2009) used three attribute categories, each with three to five possible states, to identify five phases (Middle Postclassic through Early Colonial). Because of the lack of prior work in the Toluca Valley, we did not know which types were likely to be chronologically significant. We therefore began with a large number of variables. Only three classes of types were excluded from the seriation: eroded types, non-eroded types with 10 or fewer sherds in the core seriation sample (described in more detail below), and types oc­curring only in a single context. This resulted in the inclusion of 62 types in the seriation. Table 1 shows mean type frequencies for all types ac­counting for more than .01 percent of the ceramics of any phase, including some types excluded from the seriation. A few types included separately in the seriation are combined into single entries in the table. 
The ceramic classification we have devised for Calixtlahuaca defines types based on vessel form, decoration, and paste, generally in that or­der. The general approach to classification is based on Smith's work at Aztec-period sites in Morelos. The nature of ceramic categories is

with house architecture, middens, or near-house refuse scatters. These lots contain an average of 721 sherds each, and the sample as a whole con­tains over 121,000 sherds. These contexts include most of the cases of directly superimposed strata. For the remainder of this article, this sample is referred to as the Core Seriation Sample (CSS). Ceramic type counts for the CSS can be found in Supplemental Table 2. 
K-Means Cluster Analysis 
The first method applied to the CSS to form groups was k-means clustering. K-means is a non-hierarchical clustering procedure that at­tempts to minimize the distance among cases within clusters and to maximize the distance be­tween clusters. Based on other central Mexican Postclassic chronologies, we hypothesized that the Calixtlahuaca ceramics would conform to two, three, or four chronological phases. We therefore ran three cluster analyses, one for each of these hypotheses. Unfortunately, these clusters were not supported contextually. Excavation lots from the clusters were not consistently ordered stratigraphically, and lots within the same strati­graphic layer would frequently be assigned to several different clusters. While chronology is often the single most distinctive dimension of variation in archaeological ceramic assemblages, it seems that temporal order was too obscured by statistical noise in this dataset. This may be a re­sult of the large number of types included in the analysis, many of which were evidently not chronologically sensitive. Because we view stratigraphy as the most fundamental chronolog­ical marker, we abandoned this approach. 
Discriminant Function Analysis 
We next used imported ceramic types with known chronological associations to divide the ceramics into groups or phases, which we tested against the stratigraphy. Of the imported types present at the site, the Aztec black-on-orange types are the most securely dated. In Morelos, Smith (1983) found that the presence of imported Aztec III black-on-orange is the most consistent marker of the transition from the Middle to Late Postclassic period. The Aztec black-on-orange found at Cal­ixtlahuaca consists almost exclusively of tripod grater bowls (molcajetes). We distinguished Hodge and Minc's (1991) molcajete variants D and E as Aztec III; variants H, Ml, and M2 as Aztec III/IV; and variant M4 as Aztec IV (Figure 4). Aztec orangeware sherds without enough dec­oration for a secure assignment were coded as Aztec III. This is a conservative division, placing only those cases with specific motifs in the Aztec III/IV category and only those with clear natu­ralistic (and likely Spanish-derived) designs into the Aztec IV category. As a ceramic type, Aztec III appeared in the Basin of Mexico and in More­los in the mid-1300s and remained in use until the Spanish conquest (Hare and Smith 1996; Nichols and Charlton 1996). The situation for Aztec IV is less clear. The type has traditionally been considered to post-date the Spanish con­quest, and this category has often included most of the variants that we separate out as III/IV, as well as those that we coded as Aztec IV. With in­creasing research, it has become clear that at least some variants of what has traditionally been called Aztec IV were first produced several decades prior to the Spanish conquest and con­tinued to be produced after it as well (Charlton et al. 2005). This transitional group has become known as Aztec III/IV, although researchers do not agree on exactly which variants fall into this category. Based on current knowledge, production of Aztec III/IV probably began around A.D. 1500 (Hodge 1998). Overholtzer (2014) also uses the Aztec black-on-orange types as the basis for her seriation of deposits at Xaltocan. 
Based on these considerations, we used the distribution of Aztec orangeware types to partition the excavated lots. We divided the CSS into two initial groups based on the presence and absence of Aztec orangewares in each stratigraphic layer. Given the near absence of the Middle Postclassic orangeware types at Calixtlahuaca -Aztec I and Aztec II black-on-orange-we assumed that all Aztec orangeware sherds dated to the Late Post­classic, or possibly early colonial, periods. For purposes of chronology building, we made the heuristic assumption that each identifiable strati­graphic layer-which we called capas (see dis­cussion below)-pertained to one and only one chronological phase. We therefore assigned all of the lots from a single stratigraphic layer to the same group. The two original groups (with and without Aztec orangeware sherds) were tested

for internal coherence by running the discriminant analysis and checking for lots that were switched by the functions (based on overall type composi­tion) from their original group (based on orange­wares) to the other group. If most of the lots from a single stratigraphic layer were switched to the opposite group, the lots were either reassigned or removed from the sample. 
Once the two groups were "corrected" in this manner, all other excavated lots with more than 50 sherds were added to the analysis, but not as­signed to an a priori group. When used in this manner, discriminant analysis will produce a probability of that lot being a member of each previously defined group. We then hand-exam­ined the results and assigned all of the lots from a single stratigraphic context to the most common discriminant analysis phase assignment. In a few cases, this resulted in the division of what had been identified as a single stratum during exca­vation into two components. Strata with highly ambivalent results (e.g., lots were assigned to two or more phases in approximately even quan­tities, or a majority of lots showed approximately even probabilities of belonging to two or more phases) were coded as chronologically mixed. The discriminant analysis and subsequent phase assignment procedures produced stratigraphically coherent and consistent results for two groups, signaling the success of this approach. Based on the presence and absence of Aztec orangewares, the two groups could be interpreted as pertaining to the Middle and Late Postclassic periods. 
We next attempted to subdivide each group into two finer phases. To do this, we returned to the CSS. We first divided the CSS group con­taining Aztec orangeware into two subgroups: one based on lots containing only Aztec III and one based on lots containing Aztec III/IV (with or without Aztec III). This produced a total of three base groups. The procedure described above was repeated using these three groups, and it again produced stratigraphically logical results for the three groups. No distinctions were made between variants of Aztec black-on-orange sus­pected to have been imported from the Basin of Mexico and those suspected to have been pro­duced locally. Out of six households with material dating to the last phase, three have very low fre­quencies of Aztec orangewares and other imports,

meaning that the discriminant analysis is not sim­ply dividing lots based on the types that we used to create the base groups. We then attempted to divide the Middle Postclassic group into two phases, using the presence of various local types via further k-means clustering. Although we tried many combinations of variables, we could not produce stratigraphically coherent results, so we gave up trying to subdivide that group. The dis­criminant analysis probabilities for all analyzed lots can be found in Supplemental Table 3. The three phases resembled the Postclassic chronol­ogy at Yautepec (Hare and Smith 1996) in having a single Middle Postclassic phase and two Late Postclassic phases. 
At this point, we were satisfied that we had created a reasonable three-phase sequence for the ceramics at Calixtlahuaca. We named the phases Dongu, Ninupi, and Yata, from oldest to youngest. The names of ceramic phases are drawn from the three major non-Nahuatl languages traditionally spoken in the Toluca Valley (Garcia I 999). Dongu is an Otomi term meaning "old house" or "aban­doned house" (Hernandez and Torquemada 2010:49; Lastra de Suarez 1989:218, 2008:312), an appropriate name for the earliest phase at the site. Ninupi is a Matlatzinca term meaning "wind" or "air" (Basalenque 1975 [1642]:19; Escalante and Hernandez 1999: 175), a nod to the well-known Ehecatl temple at the site. The third phase name, Yata, is taken from Mazahua and means "to divide" or "to let fall," often referring to houses (Kiemole 1975:350; Rodriguez 2010). We also identified a small number of contexts with approximately even probabilities of belonging to two adjacent phases, and some contexts representing chronologically mixed deposits. An attempt to include smaller lots, with 30 to 50 sherds, produced inconsistent results, demonstrating that this method of phase assign­ment is dependent on adequate sample size. 
Stratigraphy 
Stratigraphy is the backbone of our chronology. We manipulated the ceramic data in various ways, as described above, to produce clusters of types that have a clear stratigraphic ordering. Once we had defined the three phases, we undertook a de­tailed analysis of the stratigraphic reiationships of the phased ceramic lots. We recorded the phase assignments on schematic depictions of the stratigraphy for each excavated unit. We call our basic unit of cultural stratigraphy the "capa": this is a soil zone that pertains to a particular type of depositional activity. Most capas appear to have chronological integrity. For each capa, we tallied the number of lots assigned to each of the three phases. For most capas at the site, all constituent lots phased to only one ceramic phase. For other capas, we assigned the entire capa to the phase of the greatest number of individual lots, in line with our heuristic assumption that all capas per­tained to a single phase. 
This procedure is illustrated in Figure 5, a Harris matrix of the stratigraphy in Unit 316, an excavation of a house and surrounding area. Each box is a capa or an architectural unit (floors and walls). Capa labels are written in Times font to the right (or below) each box. Architectural fea­tures are in boxes drawn with a heavier line. The numbers inside the capa boxes indicate the num­ber of excavated lots in that capa assigned to each of the Dongu, Ninupi, and Yata phases (in that order). The tally for the numerically dominant phase for each capa is indicated in bold typeface. Although this is our most complex and "messiest" stratigraphic excavation, the results show strong-but not perfect-stratigraphic support for the seriation results. 
Of the 17 capas in Unit 316 with at least one lot included in the seriation, nine have lots from a single phase. For five capas, one phase contains at least twice as many lots as any other, and for one capa the dominant phase has only one more lot than a second phase. Two capas-the plow zone and a stone floor deposit-produced incon­clusive results; their two seriated lots were split between two phases. When all of the capas were assigned to their dominant ceramic phase, every single case of a stratigraphic relationship between capas of different ceramic phases (there are eight such cases in Unit 316; see Figure 5) was in the correct relative order. This result, which is repli­cated in other excavation units with stratigraphy and multiple phases, provides strong confirmation for the chronological integrity of the phases, which were defined from ceramic data only. One capa without stratigraphic relationship to any other unit (Capa 7) is shown floating in the figure; it is placed between the Dongu and Ninupi phases based on its seriated lots.

There are very few single-phase ceramic types (Table 1). Instead, the phases are characterized by differences in the relative frequencies of types. There is a cluster of Basin of Mexico-style types-late Aztec Guinda redwares, Texcoco fab­ric-impressed salt vessels, and comals-that in­crease sharply over time, from almost complete absence in the Dongu phase to low but consistent presence in the Ninupi phase and rapid increase in the Yata phase. Among the non-Aztec types, the D-group (red-on-white), and G-group (nega­tive-on-natural), are low-frequency types that al­most completely disappear after the Dongu phase. Although we considered these types to be of local origin for purposes of seriation, the provisional results of our INAA sourcing suggest that some of these earlier types may in fact be imported from the southern or western portions of the Toluca Valley (Stoner and Glascock 2013). The C-group (polychromes-on-white) is one of the few types to peak in Phase 4, although the group is present in all phases. There is a general trend toward a higher bowl-to-jar ratio and an increased diversity of vessel forms over time. 
Radiocarbon Dating 
We obtained 54 radiocarbon dates from our ex­cavations at Calixtlahuaca. This operation had two goals: first, to test the integrity of the phases based on ceramic seriation and attach them to absolute dates; and second, to date terrace de­posits that contained insufficient numbers of sherds to include in the seriation or to otherwise date with ceramics. All samples were processed by the University of Arizona Accelerator Mass Spectrometry Lab. The first 20 dates were processed in 2006 as sample numbers AA 78218­AA 78237, and the latter 34 dates were processed in 2011 as sample numbers AA98717-AA98749. The samples included 21 high-precision dates. All of the samples consisted of carbonized or partially carbonized wood or other plant matter. The samples used in the chronology research de­scribed here were selected from household con­texts with good ceramic seriation phase assign­ments (Table 2). A preliminary discussion of the site chronology, based on the first set of 20 dates, was published in Smith et al. 2013. The present

Nearly all of the calibrated radiocarbon dates fall into the Middle and Late Postclassic periods (Figure 6). All dates were calibrated using OxCal 
4.2.2 (Bronk Ramsey 2009) with atmospheric data from Reimer et al. (2009). Excluding one conta­minated modem date (R-28), the ranges on the latest dates extend only a short distance into the Early Colonial period. Four dates (R-33, 37, 42, and 45) have a Formative-or Classic-period age. All of these were from layers underlying cultural strata or from gully fill. These dates most likely reflect naturally occurring, rather than culturally produced, charcoal. Alternatively, they may rep­resent a very limited, and now deeply buried or eroded, Classic-period occupation of the site.

The dates associated with the three ceramic phases do pattern chronologically, with a limited degree of overlap near the phase boundaries. Is­sues of overlap between phases are complicated by fluctuations in the calibration curve during the Postclassic period, which produce multiple intercepts or plateaus of approximately even prob­ability for many of the dates.

ordered chronologically by their single highest­probability intercept, they show a clear associa­tion with the groupings created by ceramic seri­ation. Of the 54 total radiocarbon dates, 39 are from contexts that could be securely placed into a ceramic phase. Of these 39 dates, 34 cases have matching ceramic and radiocarbon phases; three

radiocarbon dates predate their ceramic associa­tions (likely "old wood"); and two post-date their ceramic associations (likely contaminated con­texts; see Table 3). In order to clarify the rela­tionship between the ceramic seriation groups and absolute dates, we next turned to Bayesian methods. 
Bayesian Modeling 
Bayesian methods have been rapidly gaining pop­ularity in archaeological chronology building across a wide range of regions and time periods (Beramendi-Orosco et al. 2009; Higham and Higham 2009; Overholtzer 2014; Zeidler et al. 1998). The methods are uniquely well suited to archaeological dating, which usually includes a mix of absolutely known facfors (such as histor­ical dates), relative contextual information, and probability curves (such as radiocarbon or ob­sidian hydration calibrations). Bayesian methods allow for the incorporation of all of these types of data into a single model under controllable pa­rameters. The model combines these multiple fac­tors into a single probability curve. Curves may be generated for either the length of a phase or its beginning and end dates. In the case of Cal­ixtlahuaca, they allow for the incorporation of ceramic seriation data, radiocarbon dates, and ethnohistoric information about the abandonment of the site into the prediction of the absolute be­ginning and end dates for each phase. The first two types of data have been discussed above. The third, ethnohistoric documents, provides two potentially relevant dates-the Aztec conquest of Calixtlahuaca in A.D.1476 and the abandonment of the site by Spanish decree in A.D. 1530. The source of the latter date is discussed in more detail in the next section of the paper. All Bayesian

analyses were performed using BCal, a publicly available Bayesian program for archaeological chronology (Buck et al. 1999). 
We ran four sets of Bayesian analyses to pre­dict the beginning and end dates for each phase, referred to as Models 1-4. All four runs included three ceramic-based groups of radiocarbon dates, using only those dates that corresponded to ce­ramic assignments for their context (described in the previous section). This resulted in 34 initial dates, some of which were excluded from later runs due to their probability of being outliers. The date of A.D. 1476 for Aztec conquest was not included in the models after preliminary runs demonstrated that it was highly unlikely to cor­respond to the transition between the two Late Postclassic phases. This was not unexpected, be­cause in other regions in central Mexico there is often significant economic and cultural interaction with the Basin of Mexico prior to actual mili­tary-political conquest (Hare and Smith 1996). The 1530 historic date for the abandonment of the site was consistent with the preliminary dates independently generated by the radiocarbon dates, so we decided to include this date in the models. It is modeled as a minimum end date for occupa­tion at the site, on the premise that there must have been some population remaining at the site until at least 1530 to be moved by royal order. 
Models 1 and 2 used all 34 radiocarbon dates and assumed that the phases were independent and abutting, respectively. Models 3 and 4 re­moved the earliest two radiocarbon dates as out­liers and, again, assumed that the phases were independent (model 3) and abutting (model 4). When the phases are independent, as in models 1 and 3, the model treats the end date of one phase as independent of the beginning of the next. This produces the six curves seen in the graphs for these models, showing the independently gener­ated beginning and end of each of the three phases. This allowed us to check for overlaps or gaps in the time periods represented by the phases. When the phases are assumed to abut, as in models 2 and 4, the end of one phase must correspond with the beginning of the subsequent phase, and the radiocarbon dates from both peri­ods are factored into determining the transition date. This produces a set of only four curves­the beginning of the Dongu phase, the Dongu/Ninupi transition, the Ninupi/Yata transi­tion, and the end of the Yata phase. Each analysis was run a minimum of three times to check for the effects of random noise resulting from re­sampling. None of the analyses produced varia­tion of more than a few years between runs. The dates presented here are from the median run for each case, with the single highest probability years noted at the top of the figure (Figure 7). 
Outlier dates are a potential problem in Bayesian models. In order to test the effect of in­dividual dates on the phase ranges, we excluded one or two dates from the ends of each phase when the distribution of dates suggested that this would be appropriate. The only case in which this produced a significant shift in phase begin­ning or end dates is the beginning of the Dongu phase. The exclusion of one date, R-44, results in shift of about 110 years in the start date for the occupation of the site, as can be seen by compar­ing runs 1 and 3 or 2 and 4 (Figure 7). 
Comparisons of the paired independent and abutting runs show consistent results. The highest probability beginning and end dates for the se­quence as a whole remain constant. In the inde­pendent models, the maximum probability inter­cepts for the dates for the end of the Dongu phase and the beginning of the Ninupi phase have an approximately 50-year gap between them. De­spite this, the two independent probabilities do show a large area of overlap. In the abutting model, the phase transition falls at the recent end of the date spectrum in the independent results. The independent transition between the Ninupi and Yata phases shows an opposite pattern, with an approximately 30-year zone of overlap be­tween the end of the Ninupi phase and the begin­ning of the Yata phase. The abutting versions of the model place the Ninupi/Yata transition evenly between the relevant independent variables. The consistency between the independent and abutting transitions supports the validity of the date group­ings used in each phase. 
We concluded that model 4 is the most rea­sonable. We chose abutting, rather than indepen­dent, phase dates for two reasons.

Relationship to the Historical Chronology 
The central Mexican native historical chronicles contain very little information about events and processes in the Toluca Valley prior to the Spanish conquest. Tomaszewsi and Smith (201 1) review mentions of Toluca Valley places in the standard Basin of Mexico sources and create a six-period chronology from the thirteenth century through the Spanish colonial period. We have followed Smith's (1987) methodological precept of keeping the archaeological and historical chronologies separate until both have been analyzed on their own. With the partial exception of the date for the final abandonment of Calixtlahuaca (A.D. 1530), the historical chronology has played no part in the derivation of our archaeological chronology. In this section, we compare the out­lines of the two chronologies (Figure 8); the full implications of correlating the two records cannot be drawn until more analyses of the excavation

grations in order to support Mexica claims of ter­ritory and dominance in the Toluca Valley. This was the view of Jose Garcia Pay6n (1941:19), who identified this practice as an example of the biased nature of Mexica political history. Post­classic material culture in the Toluca Valley shows more similarities with preexisting local Late Clas­sic and Epiclassic traditions than it does with most contemporaneous Nahuatl-speaking areas. If correct, this interpretation suggests that Nahuatl speakers may not have moved into the Toluca Valley in appreciable numbers until after the Mex­ica conquest in AD. 1476. 
The Tepanec empire (Santamarina 2006) strad­dles the Dongu and Ninupi archaeological phases. The historical record contains little of note during Period B, the early Tepanec empire. During the reign of the Tepanec emperor Tezozomoc (Period C,AD. 1370-1428), several documents suggest Tepanec conquests in the Toluca Valley, as well as Tepanec ownership of some lands (Carrasco 1984; Santamarina 2006). Unfortunately, these records say little about the city of Calixtlahuaca or Matlatzinco. Period C lines up well with the Ninupi phase. 
Period D, corresponding to the early decades of the Mexica empire, begins with the formation of the Triple Alliance in A.D. 1428. The native historical chronicles have little to say about the Toluca Valley at this time. The next period (Period E) begins with the conquest of Calixtlahuaca and the Toluca Valley by the Mexica emperor Axay­acatl in 1476. This event loomed large in the his­torical memory of the early colonial period, and a number of lawsuits over colonial land and labor turned on the question of political structure prior to and after Axayacatl's conquest (Garcia 1999; Garcia and J arqufn 2006; Hernandez 2011). These documents provide information on Calixt­lahuaca 's role as capital of the Toluca Valley. They confirm that Calixtlahuaca is the same place as the city called Matlatzinco in many sources, and they provide the names of kings and dynas­ties, as well as other information about political dynamics at the time.After A.D. 1476,Axayacatl divided the Valley among his close relatives and political allies, and many immigrants then moved in from the Basin of Mexico. Period Eis entirely contained within the Yata archaeological phase, which also includes several decades of Period D, 
prior to Mexica conquest. Period E ends with the Spanish conquest of 
A.D. 
1521. Our initial reconstructions of the Spanish colonial period suggested-from the ar­chaeological remains alone -that the Yata phase probably continued for a decade or two after AD. 1521. Some ceramic figurines from the uppermost levels of Yata deposits show clear European themes, yet the standard archaeological markers of early colonial central Mexican occupations at urban sites-iron artifacts, glazed pottery, bones from horse and cow-are lacking at the site. This is not a definitive argument for an absence of sixteenth century occupation, since Spanish traits did not show up at some rural Aztec sites in the Teotihuacan Valley until a century after the Span­ish conquest (Charlton et al. 2005). But these new features were present at Spanish urban cen­ters such as Yautepec and Mexico City, and Cal­ixtlahuaca was part of the Spanish town of Toluca, included in the land grant to the conqueror Cortes (the "Marquesado del Valle"). Thus we expected to find the new material culture if there had been significant early colonial deposits at Calixt­lahuaca. In addition, the Bayesian models all showed that the probability of an end date after 

A.D. 
1530 drops very quickly. 


In 2013, prior to the Bayesian modeling de­scribed above, we learned of documentary evi­dence that the occupation of Calixtlahuaca ended around A.D. 1530 or shortly thereafter. Dr. Rene Garcia Castro provided Smith with a microfilm copy of a colonial lawsuit from AD. 1598, and Dr. Raymundo Martinez kindly arranged for the paleography of key passages. One such passage reads : 
The Indians who were in the lands of the capital city Calixtlahuaca later populated and built the church and monastery of San Francisco in the city of Toluca. After the Marquis had taken possession, the friars of that monastery forced the Indians who were in Calixtlahuaca to move to the city of Toluca [Marquesado 1598:f482v; translation by Smith]. 
The Marquis was Heman Cortes, who received the title "Marquis del Valle de Oaxaca" in Spain in A.D. 1529 and arrived to take possession in Toluca (one of the cities included in the Marque­sado, the territory associated with the title) be-

tween A.D. 1530 and 1532.Armed with this his­torical date that confirmed our initial archaeo­logical supposition, we used A.D. 1530 as the minimum end date for the Yata phase in the Bayesian modeling. 
Discussion 
The chronology described in this paper has sig­nificance for continuing research at Calixtlahuaca, for central Mexican chronologies, and for the general issue of chronological refinement in Mesoamerican archaeology. 
Local Significance 
Our new ceramic phases and their placement in time will permit a variety of inferences about the development and demise of the city and polity of Calixtlahuaca. Many of these analyses are still ongoing, and it would be premature to discuss them here. One finding that does stand out, how­ever, is the relatively high level of apparent resi­dential mobility within the site. As shown in Fig­ure 9, many houses and terraces were abandoned at the end of each phase, and others were newly, 
occupied. Although we cannot trace the move­ments of individual households, the most likely explanation is that households moved periodically within the urban center. This pattern presents a strong contrast to houses at contemporaneous sites in Morelos, where Smith found a very high level of continuity in house occupation across phases (Smith 1992; Smith et al. 1999). The sig­nificance of the low level of residential continuity at Calixtlahuaca is still unclear. 
Broadly, material culture at Calixtlahuaca be­came increasingly similar to that of the Basin of Mexico over time . Imported and local variants of Aztec-style ceramics increased. Ceramics in­dicators related to food preparation practices , such as comales and bowl-to-jar ratios, shifted toward Basin frequencies. The frequency of green obsidian increased. Nonetheless, for all of these markers, the basic domestic assemblages are still far more similar to earlier phases at the site than they are to Aztec-period domestic assemblages in the Basin of Mexico.

rigorous chronology for the Middle and Late Post­classic time periods in the Toluca Valley. This advance not only improves archaeological knowl­edge of the Toluca area, but also helps resolve other chronological issues in central and west­central Mexico. One of the major contributions focuses on the well-known Aztec black-on-orange typology. The dating and degree of chronological overlap among Aztec orangeware types is a long-

standing topic of investigation within central 
Mexican archaeology (Charlton 1996; Hodge et 
al. 1993; Overholtzer 2014; Parsons 1966; Vail­
lant 1938). Because the presence or absence of 
these types is often used to mark chronological 
change , shifts in the dating of the types have 
larger implications for the dating of central Mex­
ican sites. 

With ongoing investigation, it has become clear that there is a temporal overlap between many of the types in the sequence, as well as some geographic variation in the periods of use. Our results provide new chronometric dates for the Aztec III and Aztec III/IV black-on-orange ceramic types and , thus , additional support for their chronological usefulness in central Mexico. The appearance of Aztec III in the Ninupi phase is slightly later than in the Basin of Mexico and in Morelos , as might be expected from a provin­cial region that did not participate in the devel­opment of the type. The continued use of Aztec III during the Yata Phase is consistent with sites in the Basin of Mexico. 
The widespread use of Aztec III/IV during the Yata phase pushes back the likely dates for the development of the type a full half-century before the date of A.D. 1500 proposed by Hodge. The earlier date is consistent with excavations in Yautepec, Morelos, where the type is present in Molotla-phase (A.D. 1440-1540) deposits (Hare and Smith 1996). This may have implications for the relative dating of material from the Basin of Mexico , where Aztec III/IV has been identified in survey (Parsons 2008) and in reconstructed historical excavations (Garraty 2013) that lack associated absolute dates. The Aztec orangeware at Calixtlahuaca firmly supports the hypothesis that the cluster of motifs characterized as Aztec III/IV is a chronologically distinctive and sensi­tive variant within the central Mexican Aztec or­
angewares. 
In addition to the refinement of the Aztec black-on-orange type sequence, this chronology also offers the first absolute dates for most Post­classic Toluca Valley ceramic types. While addi­tional work will be necessary to determine re­gional (e.g., Sugiura 2005) or urban/rural variation in the periods of use of particular types , the general patterns presented here will allow more accurate dating of surveyed sites in the Toluca Valley and other areas where the types appear as tradewares. One particular case where this chronology may be of interest is in the dating of the Cumbres phase , a group of site unit intru­sions at the Ucareo obsidian source (Hernandez and Healan 2008). 
Methodological Implications 
Our methods of chronology building are not in­novative. Seriation, stratigraphic analysis, and ra­diocarbon dating are all time-honored methods, and Bayesian analysis of calibrated radiocarbon dates is fast becoming a standard archaeological approach. Yet for Postclassic sites in northern Mesoamerica such methods are rarely honored in practice. Lisa Overholtzer 's (2014) radiocar­bon-based sequence for Xaltocan is the first new and strongly supported chronological advance for the Aztec-period Basin of Mexico in many decades. We need many more cases of targeted chronology building that incorporate radiocarbon dates, seriation, and other methods. 
Our results demonstrate the importance of us­ing multiple lines of evidence to create a rigorous excavation-based chronological sequence. We at­tribute our success to several analytical decisions , including a focus on ceramic types rather than attributes and the use of a wide range of types in ceramic seriation, rather than one or two marker types. Furthermore , our research shows the utility of Bayesian methods in the development of re­fined archaeological chronologies and the poten­tial to apply such methods outside of deeply strat­ified sites.
