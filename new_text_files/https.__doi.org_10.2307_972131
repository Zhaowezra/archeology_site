LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 9, No. 1, 1998) 
The first volume, in 1995, contained 10 relatively short (under 10 pages) articles, and the second, in 1996, published five generally longer (7-18 pages) articles. The articles cover themes of primary interest in Andean studies: chronology, elite culture, religion, and ideol­ogy. There is a rough balance between archaeological and ethnohistorical papers, with several combining archaeological and textual data to address specific questions. The archaeological papers tended to be descriptive site reports, devoted to ritual places, or state facilities such as roads, production loci, palaces, and estates (among them, the metal-working center of Quillay in northeast Argentina and Inka storage facili­ties in Acarf). The ethnohistorical articles varied more widely in the relative scope of their subjects, from "La mujer en el Peni prehispanico" (Rostworowskf) and "Sefiores del Imperio Perdido. Mobles y curacas en el Peni Colonial" (Lorandi), to detailed interpretation of documents pertaining to a specific group of state work­ers residing in Cuzco (Cahill) and an analysis of the Andean concept of ataw or ')ust war" (Ziolkowski). The articles that combine archaeological and textual data do so primarily to link specific geographic loca­tions with places documented in the ethnohistoric record, such as an article on the hiding place of the mummy of Huayna Capac at Quispeguanca (Farrington) or that on Argentinean toponyms (Gentile). 
The journal is geared toward a limited audience of Andeanists. Two characteristics of the articles in the first two volumes make this clear. First, only two of the 15 articles include a general map showing the location of the research area within the empire and/or modem western South America (although all the articles have detailed maps of the research areas). Second, the arti­
cles are largely directed at highly specific questions relating to the lnka: fixing the southernmost frontier of the empire, precisely locating the route of a Spanish conquistador; and so on. Articles on themes that might be of interest to non-Andeanists-the operation of royal estates, the organization of state laborers, and the incorporation of conquered territories into the empire-are discussed purely in their Andean, even Inkaic, context, and not within a broader theoretical or cross-cultural framework. While on the one hand, I applaud the editors' efforts to consolidate materials on the Inka, I also worry that this journal will be read only by lnka scholars and, therefore, those who write about the Inka for a broader audience will be reluctant to pub­lish in such a narrowly focused journal. 
The great strength of this journal is the exposure it will bring to the work of scholars residing outside the United States and western Europe, especially those in Latin America. Most (13 of 15) of the articles are by such scholars. The research of many scholars (primar­ily Latin American) working in the Andes is not easily accessible in the United States. If Tawantinsuyu can gamer sufficient circulation, it will increase the visibil­ity and availability of these scholars' work, which will enhance Inka scholarship enormously. The section on recent discoveries and pressing research and preserva­tion issues facing lnka localities will also serve the scholarly community well. Another useful feature of the journal will be its publication of chronometric dates associated with the lnka empire, which should greatly enhance our ability to deal with issues such as the development and spread of imperial control. All in all, the journal will be an important addition to the holdings of large research libraries and, perhaps, the personal libraries of Inka and Andean scholars.
