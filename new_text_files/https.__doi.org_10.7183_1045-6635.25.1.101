RECENT ARCHAEOBOTANICAL FINDINGS OF THE 

HALLUCINOGENIC SNUFF COJOBA (ANADENANTHERA PEREGRINA (L.) SPEG.) IN PRECOLONIAL PUERTO RICO 
Jaime R. Pagan-Jimenez and Lisabeth A. Carlson 
Archaeolog,ical starch grains consistent with those produced and stored in modern cojoba (Anadenanthera peregrina) seeds were identified.for the first time in the West Indies, in a coral milling base recovered in a small precolonial habitation site of Eastern Puerto Rico, in a context dated to A.D. l/50-I250. Ethnohistoric, ethnographic, and previous archaeological data on cojoba from the West Indies and South America were surveyed in order to form plausible sociocultural interpreta­tions of the findings. After experimentally assessing some ethnographic protocols that possibly replicate various ancient ways of processing cojoba seeds for producing hallucinogenic powders related to the so-called ritual de la cojoba, this report proposes that cojoba seeds were processed and used here mainly as an hallucinogenic complement to the healer for the divination of illness.

Parafigurar inter­pretaciones socioculturales plausibles de estos hallazagos, exploramos datos etnohist6ricos, etnogrdficos y arqueol6gicos pre­vios acerca de la cojoba en las Antillas yen Suramerica.

mong the precolonial inhabitants of the AWest Indies, the use of the hallucino­genic snuff called cojoba (Anadenan­thera peregrina (L.) Speg.), known as yopo or ce­bil in South America) was documented by early chroniclers who described in a general way the plant's importance and variable uses, though they mainly discussed its role in what they called the ritual de la cojoba (Roman 2007). Archaeologi­cally speaking, paraphernalia presumably associ­ated with this important ritual are fairly common, with the Greater Antilles region having the great­est number and diversity of related artifacts , in­cluding inhaling tubes , vomiting sticks , snuff bowls and platters, and canopied idol tables (Kaye 1999). Although there is an abundance of ritual ar­
tifacts, the true identity of the hallucinogenic sub­stance used in the West Indian cojoba ritual has not been firmly established, nor have traces of this plant or other hallucinogenic substances been identified in objects traditionally associated with this rite. Furthermore, historiographic analysis on the use of cojoba has been sometimes confus­ing and two different plants (tobacco [Nicotiana tabacum] and cojoba) have been postulated sep­arately as the ones directly involved in the ritual (Boomert 200 1; Loven 1935; Ortiz 1987). 
The lack of adequate archaeobotanical data for the presence and use of cojoba in the West In­dies is not surprising , considering the perishable nature of the botanical remains (e.g., seeds, chem­ical substances within the seeds) that can be used

to establish direct links between this plant and the different human groups that were thought to use it. With this scenario in mind, this report de­scribes the identification of archaeological starches highly consistent with those stored in modern cojoba seeds. 
Archaeological starches were directly recov­ered in a coral grinding artifact within a small habitation site (Playa Blanca 6 or CE-11) in east­ern Puerto Rico chronologically situated between 
A.D. 1150 and 1270 (Figure 1). In order to un­derstand the nature of the finding, we will first present an overview of cojoba and its purported uses and functions in the precolonial and post­columbian West Indies and South America with the aim of creating an ethnographic base that sup­ports the interpretation of the archaeobotanical data. Following is a description of the archaeo­logical context of the findings. Next, we present the archaeobotanical data recovered and microb­otanical information that was gathered through an experiment processing modem cojoba starches using protocols described ethnographically. It is by these various means that we ultimately propose that in the household where the cojoba was iden­tified, the plant was not necessarily used as part of the formal cojoba ritual, as has been widely de­scribed by chroniclers and ethnographers. Based on the quality of the preserved starch grains and their morphometric characteristics, these particu­lar cojoba seeds appear to have been ground dur­ing their mature state without being subjected to heating or parching. This characteristic, in addi­tion to the context of the find, suggests that this cojoba may have been used in the context of heal­ing treatments (divination of illness) or as a stim­ulant possibly associated with other types of reli­gious activities, rather than being part of the formal ritual de la cojoba.

American origin that was humanly introduced to the Antilles during the precolonial era (Figure 2). There are two recognized species of the genus Anadenanthera in the Americas (A. peregrina and A. colubrina) that have been historically used by indigenous peoples in ritual ceremonies and magical-religious activities due to the chemical components, or tryptamines (alkaloids),1 con­tained in its seeds, leaves, and bark (Reis Altschul 1972; Torres and Repke 2006). The current nat­ural distribution of these species is restricted to South America, generally north of the southern limit of the Tropic of Capricorn. As an exotic plant, Anadenanthera peregrina is known today in Puerto Rico, Hispaniola, and some of the Lesser Antilles (e.g., Trinidad). Interestingly, its presence has never been clearly demonstrated in Cuba or Jamaica (Roman 2007), where important paraphernalia associated with the cojoba ritual have been identified in precolonial contexts. In Puerto Rico, discrete populations of cojoba trees are currently known for the lowland semi-arid south of the island-from Salinas to Cabo Rojo­but also for middle elevation landscapes where rainfall is relatively abundant (e.g., moist sub­tropical forests in Carolina, Utuado, and Pefiuelas municipalities). On the South American conti­nent, cojoba trees generally grow in partially cleared, !owe to mid-elevation forests and are commonly associated with transitional zones be­tween the cerrado (savannah) and the semi-de­ciduous forests (Brito da Costa et al. 2003; Mal­hado and Petrere 2004). 

In the precolonial Americas, hallucinogenic substances were considered intermediaries between the human and supernatural realms and, as such, participated in the interpretation and creation of cultural elements (Torres 1998). It has been pro­posed that cojoba was so important for precolonial indigenous people of the Andean Highlands and Pacific coast regions, where the plant does not grow, that people there acquired it through trade with people of the lowlands (Schultes 1998; Schultes and Hofmann 2000). Schultes and Hof­mann (2000) suggest that cojoba, and the ritual as­sociated with the cojoba snuff, originated in the Orinoco region of Venezuela. The wide distribution of this species, including its presence in the An­tilles, is a direct consequence of the human dis­persion of the plant (Reis Altschul 1972). 
According to Torres (1998), smoking pipes as­sociated with the use of cojoba (cebil) have been

found in northwestern Argentina at the sites of Inca Cueva and Huachichocana, with the oldest ar­chaeological examples dating to ca. 2100-1200 
B.C. There are also several archaeological contexts in Peruvian, Chilean, and Argentinean sites that have yielded abundant paraphernalia and botani­cal remains (seeds and preserved snuff identified as Anadenanthera peregrina) directly associated with the inhalation of cojoba that date to ca. 1000-800 B.C. (e.g., Chavfn de Huantar, Huaca Prieta, Asia, and Solcor 3 [Torres 1998]). Argen­tinean sites have revealed artifacts and botanical remains associated with the use of hallucinogenic cojoba in contexts dated from A.D. 500 to 1500, such as the case of the Alero I-La Matanza site in northwestern Argentina, where powdered material recovered in archaeological snuffing tubes was confidently identified as Anadenanthera colub­rina (Pochettino et al. 1999). These are the only examples where direct archaeobotanical remains of cojoba seeds or snuff in South America have been clearly identified. In the West Indies, mac­robotanical remains (charred wood) of Anadenan­thera spp. have been identified to the genus level in the ceremonial archaeological site of Tibes in southern Puerto Rico (ca. A.D. 500-900) (New­som 20 10; Newsom and Wing 2004). This finding establishes the presence of the genus Anadenan­thera in the precolonial Antilles at least by the Sal­adoid/Ostionoid transitional period. Prior to the current study, no evidence of processed cojoba snuff had been identified in this region. 
The Use of Hallucinogenic Substances in the West Indies: Archaeological Evidence 
The oldest archaeological evidence in the West In­dies for the use of hallucinogenic snuffs (presum­ably cojoba, though other unknown hallucino­genic or medicinal snuffs are possible) come from early Saladoid and Huecoid sites (ca. 500-100 B.C.) in Puerto Rico and some of the Lesser An­tilles (Chanlatte and Narganes 1983), although this practice continued through European contact (Fitzpatrick et al. 2009). The use of cojoba has been commonly ascribed to the inhalation of hal­lucinogenic powders through the nose with two types of instruments : nasal snuff bowls and inhal­ing tubes. Snuff bowls are crafted from ceramic or wood and are small globular or spherical contain­ers with flattened bases and one or two inhaling spouts on one side. In the case of the early Sal­adoid/Huecoid materials, the snuffing vessels are usually finely decorated with geometric incisions or applications of white or red paint (Figure 3a). In the Antilles, this artifact type is restricted to Puerto Rico and Montserrat during the early Sal­adoid/Huecoid period (Fitzpatrick et al. 2009; Kaye 1999), but during the later Saladoid/Huecoid period (ca. 100 B.C.-A.D. 400), inhaling bowls were more dispersed, documented in Trinidad, Carriacou, and eight other islands (Fitzpatrick et al. 2009). Interestingly, a similar artifact type is documented in Costa Rica during the same time period. Snarskis (1982) relates the Costa Rican ce­ramic inhaling bowls to the snuffing of tobacco and for inhaling cojoba snuff, at least for the El Bosque complex during the first century B.C. However, no clear direct evidence for the function of this artifact type, or for the hallucinogenic sub­stances used in the bowls, has been documented for this region of Lower Central America, which is an area where other hallucinogenic substances derived from mushrooms (liquids?) appear to have been common in precolonial times (Jones 1991). 
In addition to being used in snuff bowls, cojoba could be inhaled through tubes that were typi­cally made from the hollow long bones of large birds; some of these tubes were polished and finely decorated. The apparatus could be simple or so­phisticated, with the tubes occasionally embedded into a central piece carved of ceramic, wood, shell, or bone. The resulting compound Y-shaped artifact could be quite complex (Figure 3b and c). Other artifacts traditionally ascribed to the cojoba ritual in the Caribbean islands include intricate vomiting sticks made of manatee bone, wood, or shell (Fig­ure 3c); small wood platters with detailed decora­tions; and elaborate wooden idol tables (Conrad et al. 200 I ; see also Rouse I 992: 120, Figure 30). Ad­ditionally, special artifacts have been identified that relate to the processing and preparation of co­joba and include small-to medium-size stone mor­tars and manos that are finely decorated and some­times carved as effigies (Cassa 1995: 117).

and Bartolome de Las Casas ( 1909), among others, documented the use of cojoba in late fifteenth­and early sixteenth-century rituals across Hispan­iola (present-day Haiti and the Dominican Repub­lic). Those chroniclers made detailed descriptions of the social contexts (e.g., divine communication, divination, healing rituals) in which the hallucino­genic snuff was used (see Kaye 1999; Oliver 2009; Oliver et al. 2008; Roman 2007; Sanchez 2005). Even so, only vague descriptions were made con­cerning the formulation of the hallucinogenic pow­der. In the following discussion, ethnohistorical descriptions are provided for the Antilles on the ways of processing the cojoba seeds into the hal­lucinogenic snuff. This information is compared with some ethnohistoric and ethnographic data from other regions where cojoba has been histori­cally used in multiple ways-as a daily stimulant, in rituals, as medicine, and in magical-religious contexts. For additional information regarding the ritual de la cojoba in the Antilles from an ethno­historic and anthropological perspective, see Cassa (1995), Loven (1935), Ortfz (1987), Safford (1916), and Torres and Repke (2006). 
Regarding the processing of cojoba and the re­sulting hallucinogenic powder, the only allusion that de Las Casas made ( 1909:469) is to leaves that "had made certain powders of certain very dry and well ground herbs, with a color like ground cinnamon or alhefia; thus, they were of a leonada [golden] color." Lopez de G6mara (1999:ch. XXVII) also referred to a powder, writ­ing that "when they need to make divinations on what they are asked, then they eat an herb that they call cojoba, ground or in the process of grind­ing, or they take the smoke by their noses." Other important chroniclers, such as Fray Ramon Pane (1999 [1571], 2004), Fernando Colon ( 1892, son of Cristobal Colon), Gonzalo Fernandez de Oviedo (1959 [1535]), and Diego Alvarez Chanca (see Tio 1966), made mention of the consumption, physiological effects, and ritual or ceremonial use of a plant that the indigenous people called co­joba. To the best of our understanding, none of 
these chroniclers ever explained clearly the true source of the hallucinogenic powder, with the probable exception of Fernandez de Oviedo (see Kaye 1999), or the way in which this snuff was made. This confusing situation led important re­searchers such as Sven Loven (1935) and Fer­nando Ortfz (1987) to postulate that tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) was the only correct identity for the cojoba (see Boomert 2001 for a discussion of this issue).
