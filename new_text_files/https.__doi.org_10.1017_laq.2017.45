Buford makes a related point. In a lengthy and devas­tating critique of the scholarship on the subject, they home in on the inaccuracies of previous drawings and resulting misinterpretations of what used to be called the “birdman” motif on the Mississippian Eastern Woodlands Rogan plates. Four pages of tabulated data show exactly who has said what regarding the sex and gender of what is now better referred to as the “bird­human” because, as the authors convincingly argue, drawing on earlier works by Catherine Brown and several others, at least some of the winged .gures featured on the plates are actually female. 
Follensbee, in another strong chapter, applies simi­larly careful observation to human .gures in Preclassic Olmec art. From her analysis she concludes not only that typically male clothing could be appropriated by women and vice versa, but that some Olmec garments were clearly “gender neutral.” Nonetheless, in the end it was lineage rather than sex or gender that determined which garments an Olmec elite chose to wear to re.ect his or her power. This contrasts with Sarahh Scher’s study of the dress of the so-called High Priestess in Moche art, which shows that the Priestess often appears wearing male ornaments, whereas Moche men are never depicted in female dress. Power among the Moche people seems to have been exclusively expressed via male attributes. Kim Richter, on the other hand, demonstrates that many Huastec sculptures long thought to be male actually represent powerful women whose elaborate headdresses relate them to an international ideology and network. Richter also notes two sculptures of ambiguous gender. Clearly, evidence is mounting that precontact cultures had diverse and multiple under­standings of gender and gender roles. 
The only essay in the volume to deal with West Mexico is Melissa Logan’s study of Late Formative capes seen on .gural ceramics from the region. Although Logan’s analysis is impressively thorough, including six tables (four of which appear as an appendix), she cannot draw many conclusions beyond showing that capes were worn by both men and women of elite status and mature age. Logan’s chapter therefore highlights the dif.culty we face in under­standing the relation of dress to gender in early and/or largely undocumented societies. As a result, some readers may .nd much of Dressing the Part rather dry, descriptive, and even arcane in places, and others may complain that some of the authors indulge in a little too much “cloud reading.” Nonetheless, the volume overall proves that painstaking looking, combined with careful comparison and contrasting of art forms— the “grunt work” that iconographers, who are all too often denigrated for their trouble, contribute to our common knowledge—can indeed shed light on the interrelationships of gender, power, and change in undocumented and previously misunderstood pasts. And that is good news for all of us.

The essays in this volume are prime examples of a novel direction in colonial Latin American his­tory, archaeology, and art history: a broad rethinking of convergences and multidirectional links between classical antiquity and indigenous cultures of the Americas. These essays, based on papers presented at a symposium held at the J. Paul Getty Museum, feature an exemplary and thoughtful dialogue among spe­cialists in history, archaeology and classical studies, and art history. Common strands regarding imperial dominance and its representations are .rst laid out in an introduction by John M. D. Pohl and Claire 
L. Lyons, while an initial chapter by Walter Scheidel reviews methodological issues about the comparative analysis of empires. 
Two chapters address imperial iconographies. Eulogio Guzmán scrutinizes “the image” of Mexico­Tenochtitlan’s Templo Mayor, which anchored col­lective memories about the consolidation of Mexica might; ingeniously, he compares Mexica objects and architecture to the iconography of the sovereign in Hobbes’s Leviathan. Jonathan Edmonson chronicles the imperial architecture of the mighty Augusta Emerita (Mérida). After citing Mérida’s memorializa­tion by Antonio de Nebrija (as lofty ruins) and by Francisco de Montejo the Younger (who bestowed its name on colonial Yucatan’s administrative cen­ter), Edmonson explores how the victorious Romans erected this city to memorialize their victory over Asturian and Cantabrian forces. 
Although interspersed, chapters 4, 5, 8, and 9 carry out a lively art historical dialogue. Emily Umberger deftly reviews Mexica monuments that represent imperial might. Moving swiftly between well-known sculptures, such as the Teocalli of Sacred Warfare and the Tizoc stone, and other works in subject Nahua polities, Umberger locates a narrative of environmen­tal disaster and renewal in the iconographic record, beginning with the disastrous .ooding of the Mexica capital in 1499, and ending with renewed fertility at the

LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 28, No. 4, 2017] 
Basin of Mexico on 2-Reed (ca. 1507). John M. D. Pohl compares the received narrative of Hernando Cortés as Quetzalcoatl to the deployment of deities from classi­cal antiquity in the Renaissance, focusing on Alfonso V of Aragón, conqueror of Naples—a city whose foundational myth features the siren Parthenope. 
Moving across a broader canvas, Thomas B. F. Cummins highlights how “one might think of com­parisons” in terms of classical and Mexica sculp­ture. Cummins notes the inclusion of Huitzilopochtli (Sahagún’s “another Hercules”) and Hercules (de­ployed to celebrate Charles V’s triumphs) in a funeral sculpture for Charles V in Mexico City, and then notes a key distinction in the Spanish reception of Mexica and Andean imagery. While the former was an anthro­pocentric tradition comparable to Classic aesthetics, the latter was multifarious and resisted reduction. He then chronicles potential comparisons between Mexica and classical art. In addition to highlighting the uncanny resemblance between an Ehecatl sculpture holding a snake and depictions of the unfortunate Trojan priest Laocoön, Cummins analyzes a headless .gurine in a depiction of the Templo Mayor in the 1524 edition of Cortés’s second letter to Charles V, which may echo an illustration in one of the Aeneid’s oldest surviving sources—a Laocoön with arms stretched out. The chapter ends with an exemplary repurposing: the rebirth of Bramante’s circular stairway design for a Vatican theater, never built, as a staircase in Quito’s Plaza de San Francisco. 
Cecelia F. Klein rethinks European depictions of what she calls “the slash”: the opening of the chest of sacri.cial victims by Mexica priests. Klein departs from a rethinking of “simultaneous illustration,” the term Kubler and Gibson coined for Mesoamerican pictorial scenes that portray several events in the same space but not chronologically. After propos­ing that this convention derived from early modern European engravings, Klein surveys the European imagining of Mexica human sacri.ce. This is an enticing journey that comments on the staging of sacri.cial scenes by Diego Valadés, Theodore de Bry, Bernard Picart, Jean Frédéric Prévost, and Désiré Charnay, and ends with the European fascination with depicting the roasting of small children, along with a note on the potential role of blood libel narratives. 
Chapters 6 and 7 dissect Sahagún’s classical models. Andrew Laird presents an erudite compari­son between Greco-Roman deities and Nahua ones, intending to locate classical models that informed the work of Sahagún and other missionaries. Laird argues that a list of 12 important Roman gods, recorded by Livy and others, were in Sahagún’s mind as he discussed Nahua deities. Departing from the work of Lluís Nicolau i d’Olwer, he notes similarities in the recounting of an omen of conquest, a weeping woman associated with Cihuacoatl, with Plutarch’s story of a crying oracle that foretold the death of the god Pan and the end of human sacri.ces. Laird then argues that Sahagún merged Pan’s omen and Cihuacoatl’s weeping because he identi.ed Cihuacoatl as an echo of Eve, “our mother.” In any case, Laird judiciously concludes that analogies between Mexica and Greco-Roman deities would “hardly contribute” to missionary understandings about the nature of Nahua deities. Along a parallel trajectory, Guilhem Olivier goes beyond d’Olwer in arguing that Sahagún’s footnotes were essential, not incidental, and discusses changes in comparisons also discussed by Laird, such as Huitzilopochtli (from Mars to Hercules) and Chalchihuitl Icue (from Neptune to Juno). Olivier turns to euhemerism (the thesis that Greek gods originated as historical .gures, later dei.ed), here as a basis for Sahagún’s ideas about cihuapipiltin, women who died in .rst childbirth and later became goddesses. Olivier, like Laird, asserts that Sahagún’s ranked listings of Nahua deities evinces a European order; in addition, he astutely observes how little we know yet about reasons for Sahagún’s demotion or erasure of important deities, such as Xiuhteuctli (god of time) or Mictlanteuctli (lord of the Underworld). Wisely, Olivier cites La.tau, who contended that the “customs of the savages” could help him better understand classical antiquity. 
As a .tting coda, Leonardo López Luján reviews fascinating links among New Spain, Italy, and Spain. Beginning with a 1747 pamphlet on excavations at Herculaneum, perhaps the .rst publication on archae­ology in New Spain (but based in part on apocryphal letters), López Luján discusses the signi.cance of these explorations. He also discusses other early observers of Mesoamerican archaeology who were .rmly rooted in classical antiquity as they commented on eighteenth-century investigations of Mesoamerican sites such as El Tajín and Xochicalco. 
In the end, if Mexico-Tenochtitlan was “another Rome” and its deities “other” Jupiters or Junos, this impressive volume deftly addresses why these similes mattered, and how they established both foundational conceptions and misunderstandings about Mesoamer­ica in European minds.
