
DISEASE, DEMOGRAPHY, AND DIET IN EARLY COLONIAL NEW 
SPAIN: INVESTIGATION OF A SIXTEENTH-CENTURY MIXTEC 
CEMETERY AT TEPOSCOLULA YUCUNDAA 

Christina Warinner, Nelly Robles Garcia, Ronald Spores, and Noreen Tuross 
A mid-sixteenth-century cemetery was investigated at the colonial Mixtec site of Teposcolula Yucundaa and is shown to be related to the cocoliztli pandemic of I 544-1550. This is the earliest colonial epidemic cemetery to be identified in Mexico. Through archaeogenetic and oxygen stable isotope analysis it is demonstrated that the interred individuals were local Mix­tecs, and mortuary analysis sheds light on both Christian and traditional religious practices at the site. Mitochondrial hap­logroup frequencies support long-term genetic continuity in the region, and carbon stable isotopes of bone collagen and enamel carbonates suggest no decrease in maize consumption during the early colonial period, despite historical evidence fin a changing agricultural economy and increased wheat production at the site. The Teposcolula cemetery provides a rich and complex perspective on early colonial life in the Mixteca Alta and reaffirms the importance of archaeological and bioar­chaeological evidence in investigating complex social and biological processes of the past.

In the Mixteca Alta, historians have theorized that epidemic disease and depopulation facilitated Spanish land seizure and paved the way for inten­sive pastoralism by inducing labor shortfalls and creating vast stretches of fallow land. The shortage of peasant labor needed to maintain agricultural ter­races and to work the rich fields of the valleys facil­itated the relocation of towns to the valleys under congregaci6n,a new colonial policy of forced reset­tlement. This in tum freed up formerly occupied mountain slopes for grazing and led to erosion, soil infertility, and the eventual agricultural collapse of what had once been described by the Spanish as the land of milk and honey (de Burgoa 1934 [ 167 4]; Perez Rodriguez 2006; Terraciano 200 1). 
The roots of this process can be traced to the sixteenth century, when Spanish missionaries and colonists first established themselves in the Mix­teca; however, direct evidence of the key factors in this process is wanting. For example, although it has long been recognized that Spanish control of colonial territories greatly expanded following cat­astrophic population loss from introduced epidemic disease (Cook 1998; Cook and Borah 1968; Dia­mond 1997; Humboldt 1811; Prem 1992; Zinsser 
1934), little physical evidence of the epidemics has been found. Many towns in the Mixteca were suc­cessfully relocated under congregaci6n, but the proximate causes of these moves have not been established. Spanish missionaries and colonists were present in the Mixteca, but their numbers and influence within local communities are poorly understood. Historical records of taxation and tithing document a changing economy and the cul­tivation of European crops, but no archaeological studies have confirmed this fact. Direct archaeo­logical investigation is needed in order to better understand these issues and test the conclusions drawn from the historical record. 
In this article, we describe the discovery of a unique colonial cemetery at the Mixtec site of Teposcolula Yucundaa. Using mortuary and pale­odemographic analysis, we draw a connection between the cemetery and the 1544-1550 cocol­iztli epidemic and determine through oxygen sta­ble isotope and ancient DNA analysis that the cemetery contains local Mixtecs, finding no evi­dence for long-distance migrants ornonindigenous 
individuals. We then use carbon and nitrogen sta­ble isotope analysis to test the hypothesis that the changing colonial economy affected local cultiva­tion and food consumption patterns and find that continuity, rather than change, characterizes the early colonial subsistence economy. Taken together, the bioarchaeological analyses performed in this study provide some of the earliest physical evidence of epidemic disease in the Spanish-con­trolled territories of the New World and yield new insights into early colonial indigenous culture and . 
economy in the Mixteca. 
Site Background 
The archaeological site of Teposcolula Yucundaa is located in southern Mexico on a mountain ridge in the highland Mixteca Alta region of Oaxaca (Fig­ure 1).2 At its prehispanic height, Teposcolula Yucundaa controlled a territory of approximately 500 km2 with an estimated population of up to 60 ,000 (Balkansky et al. 2000; Stiver 2001). Its urban core, with an estimated population of 7,000-8,000, covered 250 ha and was ringed by a 2-km-long raised road that enclosed numerous structures and features, including a royal com­pound, elaborate stone masonry civic-ceremonial buildings, multiple paved plazas, more than 30 "palaces," a ball court, and more than 1,000 resi­dential terraces (Balkansky et al. 2000; Spores and Robles Garcia 2007; Stiver 200 1). 
The late Postclassic and early colonial chronol­ogy ofTeposcolula is now well established (Spores and Robles Garcia 2007). Teposcolula was a sub­ject of the Aztec Triple Alliance from 1458 to 1520 (Berdan andAnawalt 1997; Chimalpahin 1997 [ca. 1621]) and was later incorporated into the Spanish crown following the conquest of Tenochtitlan in 152 1. At least six parties of early Spanish explor­ers and conquistadores passed through the region from 1520 to 1525 (Oudijk and Restall 2007), and after being briefly held in private trust (encomienda), Teposcolula was reclassified as a public corregimiento in 1531 (Chance 1978). An epidemic of smallpox struck the Mixtec Alta region in the early 1530s (Acuna 1984), and in 1538 Dominican friars successfully founded a mission (vicaria) at the site and constructed a large stone church and monastery complex (Spores and Ro­bles Garcia 2007).

Following the failure of a mission at the neigh­boring site of Yanhuitlan in 1542, Teposcolula Yucundaa became the focal point of Dominican missionary efforts in the Mixteca Alta, hosting a high-profile Inquisition trial from 1544 to 1546 (Jimenez Moreno and Mateos Higuera 1940; Perez Ortiz 2003) and serving as the primary res­idence for at least 15 different Dominican friars between 1538 and 1552 (Mullen 1975; Vences Vidal 2000). Spanish-style features began appear­ing in high-status Mixtec architecture at this time in the form of arched doorways, pivoting doors, and exterior wall friezes depicting European motifs (Spores and Robles Garcia 2007). At the same time, Spanish colonists began settling in the Mixteca Alta, where they established burgeoning sericulture and livestock-herding industries. By 1544, Teposcolula was one of the largest produc­ers of silk in the entire Mixteca, producing approx­imately 2,000 Spanish pounds (libras) of silk annually (Borah 1963). 
Forced resettlement under congregaci6n was introduced in the 1540s, and the Dominicans began 
planning the relocation of Teposcolula to a new Spanish-style town in the valley below. In 1545 or 1546 another major epidemic struck the Mixteca Alta region, and in 1552, the town was formally moved to the valley by direct order of the viceroy (Gerhard 1977; Zavala 1982). The new town, later christened San Pedro y San Pablo Teposcolula, was elevated to the status of a regional capital (alcaldfa mayor),and recordsfrom the 1560s and 1570s doc­ument numerous Spanish residents (Calderon Galvan 1988; Romero Prizzi 1990). The former mountaintop urban core of Teposcolula Yucundaa, known locally as Pueblo Viejo,has remained unoc­cupied to the present. 
Excavation of the Grand Plaza and Churchyard 
Excavations began at the site ofTeposcolula Yucun­daa in 2004 under the direction of Dr. Ronald Spores and Dr. Nelly Robles Garcia. To date, many areas of the site have been explored (Figure 2), including the Dominican church and monastery, the

churchyard, administrative buildings and plazas, the royal palace, elite residences, commoner resi­dences, and agricultural terraces (Robles Garcia and Spores 2004, 2005, 2006; Spores and Robles Garcia 2007). Numerous simple pit burials were found cut into the plaster floor of the Grand Plaza, the administrative center of the site. After addi­tional excavation, it became clear that the Grand Plaza had functioned as a massive cemetery shortly before the site's abandonment in 1552 (Spores and Robles Garcia 2007). Given the number of grave cuts observed per excavated square meter and the average number of individuals per excavated grave, the Grand Plaza cemetery may contain more than 800 individuals. Excavation of the walled church­yard revealed that it too contained burials. Given the location and treatment of the burials, the church­yard assemblage was initially assumed to also date to the colonial period (Warinner 2010); however, subsequent raciiocarbon 
dating revealed that the interments predate the colonial period by a century (Table 1). Two additional Postclassic infant buri­als were recovered from residential features in out­lying terraces. From 2004 to 2006, 30 burials containing 56 individuals were recovered from five areas of the Grand Plaza (Figure 2a), three areas of the churchyard (Figure 2b), and two outlying res­idential terraces.

Methods 
Collection of Mortuary and 
Paleodemographic Data 
Mortuary data including body orientation, place­ment, and position were recorded for 30 burials in the Grand Plaza and churchyard, as well as two burials in outlying residential terraces, and 56 indi­
viduals were examined for age, sex, and trauma/pathology indicators. Although several studies have commented on the poor quality of bone preservation in parts of Mexico (e.g., Dun­can et al. 2008; Hodges 1987; Mansell et al. 2006; Tiesler et al. 2004), the gross preservation of skele­tal remains at Teposcolula was excellent, in part owing to the cool and mild climate of the high-ele­vation Mixteca Alta region, which is situated at the intersection of the Sierra Madre Occidental and Sierra Madre de! Sur mountain ranges (Perez Rodriguez et al. 20 1 1). 
Forty-two individuals could be assigned sex on the basis of pelvic and cranial features (Buikstra and Ubelaker 1994; Salas 1982). Age was esti­mated on the basis of dental development, epi­physeal union, and degeneration of the pubic symphysis and auricular surface (Buikstra and Ube­laker 1994; Krogman and !scan 1986; Lovejoy et al. 1985; Ubelaker 1989). Fifty individuals were fully examined for age indicators, and six individ­uals were assigned to basic age categories on the basis of field examination. Incisor shoveling, a fre­quent dental trait among indigenous American and Asian populations (Scott and Turner 1997), was common. No evidence of recent trauma was observed among the skeletons, although healed limb fractures were observed in at least three indi­viduals. In general, the individuals exhibited a low incidence of skeletal pathologies, with arthritis and dental caries being the most common pathologies observed. Only one subadult presented evidence of a life-threatening illness, an advanced infection of the cervical vertebrae and kyphosis. 
Ancient DNA Extraction, Amplification, and Sequencing 
All ancient DNA extraction and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) setup was performed in a dedicated ancient DNA laboratory at Harvard University. Standard ancient DNA laboratory procedures were followed throughout the extraction procedure to prevent contamination and to verify results (Warin­ner 2010). DNA was extracted from 48 human bone samples, and ancient DNA extracts were PCR amplified with newly developed primer sets (Table 2) designed to detect mitochondrial coding-region polymorphisms that define macrohaplogroups N and M and haplogroups A, B, C, and D (Kolman and Tuross 2000; Torroni et al. 1993). 
All 48 individuals tested in this study yielded amplifiable DNA. A minimum of four mitochon­drial target regions were successfully amplified for each individual, and 33 individuals amplified all five target regions in this study. Of the 227 suc­cessful amplifications, only five exhibited an ambiguous base at a single nucleotide polymor­phism position of interest. These samples were reamplified and in all cases yielded a clear and unambiguous base identification. An additional 22 individuals were further subjected to reamplifica-

tion for at least one target and in all cases yielded consistent results. 
Stable Isotope Analysis (C, N, 0) 
Bone collagen was isolated from tibia or femur shaft samples and analyzed for o 13C, o15N, and 8180 according to the methods described in Warin­ner and Tuross (2009, 2010), omitting the chloro­form:methanol step, which is unnecessary for ancient samples. For comparative purposes, addi­tional bone samples were collected from five pre­hispanic sites in the Valley of Oaxaca and analyzed for o13C and o 15N (Table 3; Warinner 2010). C/N for all bone collagen samples fell within the com­monly accepted range for intact, biological colla­gen (DeNiro 1985). 
Enamel apatite was collected from third molars and analyzed for carbonate o13C and 8180 accord­ing to the methods described in Warinner and Tur­oss 2009. The third molar (M3) is the last tooth of the dentition to form, with crown formation pri­marily occurring between ages 10and 12and erup­tion between ages 15 and 21 (Ubelaker 1989). Heavy dental wear and antemortem tooth loss among older adults reduced the number of third molars available for analysis. Carbonate samples from the Grand Plaza plaster floors were also sam­pled and analyzed to determine the o13C of local environmental carbonate sources. Because adsorbed carbonates can affect the isotopic ratios of archaeological apatites (Koch et al. 1997; True­man et al. 2004), a duplicate aliquot of each sam­ple was soaked for 50 minutes in a .lM acetic acid solution to remove loosely bound carbonates. Com­parison of the untreated and treated apatite aliquots yielded no significant difference in either o13C or 8180 (p > .1, ANOVA), and minimal pairwise dif­ferences between the two aliquots ( .1 ± .6%0 in o13C and .3±1.3%o in 8180)suggest that the archae­ological enamel has undergone little exchange with carbonate sources in the immediate environment. 
Mortuary and Demographic Analysis of the Teposcolula Skeletal Assemblages 
Grand Plaza Skeletal Assemblage 
A total of 21 simple pit burials containing 46 indi­viduals were excavated from the Grand Plaza ceme­tery (Table 4). The bodies were laid supine in an east or west orientation with arms generally folded across the chest or abdomen, and some individu­als had their legs crossed at the ankles. Bone beads were found in one burial, but no other clearly asso­ciated grave goods were encountered in the Grand Plaza burials (but see note for burials 21 and 26 in Table 4). Fourteen of the 21 burials contained more than one individual, with a maximum of five indi­viduals in a single grave. In seven graves (3, 5, 6, 9, 18, 19, 31), the bodies were stacked in an alter­nating head-to-foot orientation. Stratigraphic analy­sis indicates that each grave represents a single burial deposit. 
Amorphous calcium carbonate deposits (pos­sibly precipitated from calcium hydroxide or slaked lime) were observed in several burials, most notably in burial 2 J, in which a thick layer was observed directly above a hollow cavity contain-

ing the skeletal remains. The use of lime, possibly to reduce putrefaction odors, has also been observed in burials at the colonial mission of St. Augustine in La Florida (Koch 1983). A fragment of leather and thin scales of textile impressions were preserved underneath some of these deposits. It is unknown if the textile impressions indicate the use of burial shrouds (mortajas), which were used during the sixteenth century to wrap the bod­ies of the dead in both Spain (Eire 1995; Foster 
1960) and New Spain. Preliminary analysis iden­tified at least two weave patterns among the frag­ments: a basket weave associated with individual 39 and a twill weave associated with individual 40 (Warinner 2010). 
The burials within the Grand Plaza were laid out in an orderly fashion according to what appears to be a gridded plan. The burials were cut directly into the plaster surface of the plaza, which was not repaired or replastered after interment. Unlike at other early colonial cemeteries where old graves were frequently partially disinterred to make room for the new (e.g., at Huexotla, Tipu, and Santa Catalina de Guale; see references in Table 5),there is little evidence for grave disturbance in the Grand Plaza, and only two neighboring graves (burials 1 and 2) in the center of the plaza display evidence of human disturbance subsequent to burial. 
Thirty-seven individuals could be assigned sex on the basis of pelvic and cranial features. The sex distribution is slightly biased toward females, who make up 59 percent of the adults whose sex could be determined. The number of infants (0),children under 12 ( 1), and adults 45 and older ( 6) is notice­ably low, and there is a relatively large number of adolescents and young adults with partially or recently erupted third molars (26) compared with middle-aged adults between the ages of 25-34 (6) and 35-44 (7). 
Churchyard Skeletal Assemblage 
Seven burials containing eight individuals were excavated from three small test pits in the church­yard (Table 4). As in the Grand Plaza cemetery, individuals were buried in an extended supine posi­tion with the arms folded across the chest or abdomen or lying at the sides. Unlike in the Grand Plaza cemetery, however, the burials were oriented to the north or south along the same axis as the colo­nial church and contained only one individual each. The only exception was the burial of an adult male and an approximately two-year-old child. 
Five individuals from the churchyard could be assigned sex on the basis of pelvic and cranial fea­tures: four females and one male. Notably, three of the eight individuals excavated from the church-

yard were age five or younger. Six of the seven graves contained no grave goods. One grave , bur­ial 27, located in the center of the churchyard, con­tained an exceptional number of grave goods (figurines, pendants, and beads numbering in the tens of thousands) and is presumed to be a Post­classic royal burial (Warinner 20 10). 
Residential Terrace Skeletal Assemblage 
Two infants under the age of three were recovered from two simple pit burials in outlying commoner residential terraces. The infants were placed in a flexed , seated position, and each was accompanied by a shallow ceramic dish (cajete) of the Postclas­sic Yanhuitlan Fine Cream type. 
Teposcolula Grand Plaza and Churchyard Skeletal Assemblages in Context 
Prior to the arrival of Spanish missionaries, Mix­tecs typically buried their dead in simple pit buri­als , stone-lined crypts, or family tombs located in residential compounds. Grave goods such as ceramic vessels were frequently, but not always , included. The bodies of adults were usually laid out in an extended supine position, with anns placed at the sides (Acosta 1992; Blomster 2004; Gaxiola Gonzalez 1984; Robles Garcia 1988); however , Postclassic carved stone figurines at Teposcolula also depict the dead with arms folded across the body (Warinner 20 10). 

Both Postclassic and colonial burials at Teposcolula Yucundaa are characterized by a gen­eral absence of grave goods, a high incidence of extended supine body positioning (76percent), and a predominance of arm-folding across the chest or abdomen (81 percent)-a mortuary pattern that overlaps with contemporary Spanish Catholic prac­tices (Eire 1995; Koch 1983; Rush 194 l). In the Grand Plaza , the lack of a consistent body orien­tation and the mass burial of individuals within an extramural cemetery, however, differ from con­temporary colonial Spanish practices.

In sixteenth-century Spain,most Catholics were buried within churches or chapels, or, at the very least, within consecrated walled churchyard ceme­teries (Eire 1995:94; Foster I 960). Excavated early colonial cemeteries in New Spain (Table 5) con­form to this pattern, with a high density of burials within and immediately surrounding the church (Malvido 1997). By contrast, colonial burials at Teposcolula Yucundaa were found exclusively in the Grand Plaza, an area otherwise associated with Mixtec civic-ceremonial functions (Spores and Robles Garcia 2007). No burials or evidence of repaired rompimientos (burial cuts) were encoun­tered within the Teposcolula Yucundaa church,and graves encountered within the walled churchyard were found by direct radiocarbon dating to predate the colonial period (Table I). The unusual mortu­ary features encountered in the Teposcolula Yucun­daa Grand Plaza offer few clear insights into the biological or cultural affiliations of the interred individuals, thus necessitating alternative lines of evidence, such as ancient DNA mitochondrial hap­logroup testing and stable isotope-based paleomi­gration and paleodietary analysis. 
Oxygen Isotopic and Genetic Analysis of the Teposcolula Skeletal Assemblages 
Stable isotope analysis and mitochondrial hap­logroup testing were employed to determine genetic affinity, assess population homogeneity, and characterize the geographic origin of individ­uals within the Teposcolula burial assemblages. Recent investigations in Campeche have revealed the presence of multiple ethnic groups buried within a single early colonial cemetery (Tiesler and Zabala 20 I0), raising the possibility that a similar pattern might be found in the rapidly developing colonial town of Teposcolula Yucundaa. 

During the early colonial period, there is his­torical evidence for the presence of several differ­ent groups in the Mixteca Alta region that may have been present at Teposcolula in the sixteenth century, including local Mixtecs, central Mexicans, slaves of West African or Caribbean descent, and Spanish missionaries, officials, and settlers. Slaves were first brought to the region in the 1520s by Teposcolula 's second encomendero, Juan Pelaez de Berrio, to pan for gold (Chance 1978). Through­out the 1540s at least one and as many as six Dominican friars lived in residence at Teposcolula at any given time (Vences Vidal 2000), and exca­vations of the Teposcolula monastery in 2005 iden­tified at least seven small rooms that may have served as cells for resident or traveling friars (Ro­bles Garcia and Spores 2005; Spores and Robles Garcia 2007). Historical records indicate that nonecclesiastical Spanish settlers also began mov­ing to the Mixteca Alta in the late 1530s and early 1540s (Romero Frizzi 1990), but it is not known if any of these Spaniards lived at Teposcolula. 
Oxygen Stable Isotopes of the 
Teposcolula Burials 
Oxygen isotopic values of mineralized tissues have been shown to correlate with precipitation and tem­perature gradients (Longinelli 1984; Luz and Kolodny 1989), and thus oxygen isotopic analysis can be used to investigate archaeological histories of human migration across diverse ecological zones (e.g., Price et al. 2010; Quinn etal. 2008; Schroeder et al. 2009). Oxygen isotopes in both organic and inorganic substrates (collagen and enamel carbon­ate) were measured in order to assess whether the Teposcolula Grand Plaza cemetery represents a local Mixtec population or if there is evidence for nonlocal migrants at the site (Table 4). 
The average o180bonecollagenin the colonial Grand Plaza cemetery (8 .4 ± .7%o) compares closely with that in the Postclassic churchyard burials (8.2 ± 1.4%0), as well as with two Postclassic low-status infant burials recovered from outlying residential terraces at Teposcolula (7.8%o, 8.4%0), suggesting that the individuals interred in the Grand Plaza are of local origin (Table 4). A comparison of Grand Plaza cemetery o180enamel carbonate with that mea­sured for individuals from a variety of other sites also supports the interpretation that the cemetery does not contain long-distance migrants from Spain, Africa, the Caribbean, or other parts of Mesoamerica (Figure 3; comparative data from Bell et al. 2006; Price et al. 20 10; Schroeder et al. 2009; White et al. 2000; and Wright and Schwarcz 1998). The relatively depleted 0180enamel carbonate observed for all three Teposco1u1a burial assem­blages is consistent with the relatively cool and wet climate characteristic of the Mixteca Alta, espe­cially compared with that of southern Spain and the other Mesoamerican and Caribbean regions that have been analyzed.

Genetic Analysis 
Ancient DNA Analysis of the Teposcolula Burial Assemblages. Forty-one individuals from the Teposcolula Grand Plaza cemetery were tested for mitochondrial ancestry informative markers char­acteristic of the two major macrohaplogroups 

found outside of Africa, M and N, and the four major indigenous American haplogroups,A, B, C, and D (Table 4). Seven additional Postclassic skeletons from the churchyard and outlying resi­dential terraces were also analyzed for compari­son. All 48 individuals could be assigned to both macrohaplogroup and haplogroup, and no indi­viduals exhibited ancestry informative markers consistent with more than one haplogroup. All individuals were found to belong to macrohap­logroups M or N, thus indicating that there are no individuals of maternal African descent in the skeletal assemblage. Further haplogroup testing of the assemblage demonstrated that all individu­als exhibit markers consistent with haplogroups A, B, C, or D, indicating that there are no Europeans in the assemblage and confirming that all tested individuals are of indigenous American ancestry. This agrees with the results of the oxygen stable isotope analysis, which found no evidence for for­eign-raised individuals in the cemeteries. 
Ancient and Modern Mitochondrial Haplogroup Frequencies of Indigenous Populations. 
Genetic studies of modem indigenous American populations have revealed continental and regional patterning in mitochondrial haplogroup frequency distributions (Malhi et al. 2002; Schurr 200 4; Tor­roni et al. 199 2; Torroni et al. 1993). The hap­logroup frequency distribution of the Grand Plaza skeletal assemblage (Table 6) is typical of a Mesoamerican population, which is generally char­acterized by a high frequency ofhaplogroup A, and is distinct from the dominant C and D haplogroup pattern observed among the ancient Taino and 
2
Carib populations of the Caribbean (p < .00 1, x test for homogeneity). Within Mesoamerica, the haplogroup frequency distribution of the colonial Teposcolula Grand Plaza assemblage compares 
2
closely with that of modem Mixtecs (p > .1, x test for homogeneity; Table 6). The haplogroup fre­quency profile of the Grand Plaza assemblage indi­cates long-term genetic continuity in the Mixteca Alta and further supports the characterization of the Grand Plaza cemetery as containing a local, Mix­tec population.
