WITHIN THE AZTEC MARKET SYSTEM 

Leah D. Mine 
The emergence of the Triple Alliance empire and the consolidation of political power in the Basin of Mexico is tradition­ally associated with a high level of economic integration achieved through regional market exchange. Although researchers debate whether the market system was dominated by commercial factors or political forces, the assumption that the pax azteca led to a single, basin-wide exchange system is not generally challenged. Yet an increasing number of stylistic and compositional analyses indicate that significant regional subdivisions existed within the Aztec core, although the spatial scale, nature, and significance of these systems remains poorly understood. This study contributes to the body of evidence suggesting that economic divisions existed under the Triple Alliance, by presenting spatial patterning in Aztec Red Wares (guinda or rojo pulido) ceramics. By combining both stylistic and compositional analyses of this ceramic ware, it is possi­ble to demonstrate both the strength of economic divisions as well as map their boundaries for a significant portion of the Basin. The regional patterns in artifact distribution highlighted in this and prior studies underscore the complexity of exchange interactions that evolved under Aztec rule and which must be explained by future models of the Aztec market system.

Aztec ceramics, indicate that subregional exchange systems persisted in the Aztec core (Garraty 2007; Hodge 1990, 1992; Hodge and Mine 1990; Hodge eta!. 1992, 1993; Mine 1994, 2006b; Nichols et al. 2002; M. Parsons 1972, 1975). The purpose of this paper is to step back from considerations of mar­ket system structure and organization, to address a more basic assumption about the nature of the Aztec market system under imperial rule-that of regional integration-and to highlight regional pat­terns in artifact distribution that must be explained by future examinations of the Aztec market system. 
The Political Context: 
Formation and Integration of the Triple 
Alliance Empire 

The Late Aztec period (ca. A.D. 1350--1520) in the Basin of Mexico (Figure 1) represents a time of rapid centralization of political authority, as inde­pendent polities and tribal confederations were incorporated into larger conquest states, first under the Tepanec and later under the Aztec. 1 Prior to these developments, the Basin had been divided among a number of small city-state polities (sing. altepetl), each representing the seat of a petty king (tlatoani), and comprising an urban administrative center and a discrete territory containing dependent villages and hamlets (Bray 1972; Hodge 1984, 1996; Lockhart 1992:14--28; Smith2000).Approx­imately 50 of these conflicting city-states com­peted for local prominence; in addition, groups of city-states formed alliances or confederations for mutual defense, typically along ethnic or tribal lines (Anales de Cuauhtitlan 1938, 1945; Chimalpahin 1965; Duran 1967; Hodge 1984:139-140). 
By the end of the fourteenth century, two dom­inant confederations had emerged: the Tepaneca, headed by Azcapotzalco, along the western side of the Basin, and the Acolhua on the eastern side (Brumfiel 1983; Davies 1980:118-247). Begin­ning in 1371, Azcapotzalco initiated an aggressive campaign of expansion against the Acolhua, with the aid of its client-state the Mexica of Tenochtit­lan. Through strategic intermarriage, political manipulation, and outright conquest, the Azcapotzalcans incorporated most of the major Acolhua cities into their realm by the early 1400s. With the final defeat of an isolated Texcoco in 1418, Azcapotzalco came to control most of the Basin, with the exception of the Chalco region in the south­
east (Brumfiel 1983; Calnek 1982; Carrasco 1984a; Davies 1980: 11 8-247). 
Tepanec dominance was short-lived, however. When a crisis in dynastic succession temporarily weakened Azcapotzalco, three of its city-state dependencies-the now-famous Triple Alliance of Tenochtitlan, Texcoco, and Tlacopan-joined forces to overthrow the Tepanec capital in 1428 (Alva-Ixtlilxochitl 1985:117-121). The Triple Alliance coalition then embarked on their own path , to empire, quickly consolidating their control over polities in the northern, central, and southwestern Basin. The Triple Alliance attempted to incorpo­rate the still-independent Chalca into this imperial core, but polities in the southeastern Basin suc­cessfully resisted, and the Chalco region was not brought into the empire until 1465 (Chimalpahin 1965:199-207). Meanwhile, the Triple Alliance capitals initiated wide-ranging military campaigns outside the Basin of Mexico that would extend their tribute networks from the central highlands to the Gulf Coast (Barlow 1949; Berdan 1996; Hassig 1988; Smith 1996). 
Initially, the internal organization of the Triple Alliance empire followed a three-fold division based on preexisting ethnic boundaries. The three rulers formally agreed in 1431 that Tlacopan should reign over the remnants ofTepanec realm along the western side of the Basin, while Texcoco contin­ued as head of the Acolhua domain along the east­ern side of the Basin, and Tenochtitlan administered territories acquired in the south. Each division was considered politically autonomous, and each ruler was considered king and head of his domain with administrative and judiciary control over dependent kingdoms and territories (Alva Ixtlilxochitl 1985:121-123; Berdan 1975:71; Carrasco 1991, 1999). 
Although equal powers at the onset, the king of Tenochtitlan soon emerged as the supreme com­mander of the alliance armies, and had the decid­ing vote in planning military actions and in the establishment of garrisons and military colonists in strategic locations. Tribute from external con­quests was taken first to Tenochtitlan and from there divided among the three powers (Carrasco 1999:4-9; Davies 1987; Gibson 1971 :383). Tenochtitlan also encroached on the administra­tive powers of its confederates within the Basin,

particularly Tlacopan. Tenochtitlan assumed the right to appoint the highest level rulers in Tlaco­pan 's territory, and the lords of city-states subject to Tlacopan were confirmed at Tenochtitlan. Sim­ilarly, the rulers of Tenochtitlan eroded Texcoco's tribute base, gaining lands within the Acolhua domain at the expense of Texcoco (Gibson 1971 :384-385) and, late in the prehispanic era, cut­ting off Texcoco's long-standing rights to tribute from the fertile chinampa zone (Alva Ixtlilxochitl 1985:215-218). Unlike Tlacopan, however, Tex­coco remained a powerful and independent mem­ber of the Triple Alliance (Carrasco 1991; Evans 2001; Gibson 1956, 1964; Hicks 1982, 1992; Hodge 1996:45; Offner 1983). Texcoco continued to appoint rulers to Acolhua city-states (Hodge 1984: 141) and mounted a strong military resistance when Motecuhzoma II attempted to intervene in the Texcocan dynastic succession (Alva Ixtlilxochitl 1985:215-218; Gibson 1964:18-19). 
The degree of integration achieved under this 3­in-1 structure continues to be debated, however. Recent scholars tend to emphasize the dominance of Tenochtitlan and the effective union of alliance members through political, social, and economic means (Berdan and Smith 1996; Hodge 1996:42-43). For example, Triple Alliance admin­istrative divisions were cross-cut by elite inter­marriage, gift exchange, feasting, and a system of acquired statuses based on military prowess, that served to link the highest levels of Aztec society to each other and to the goals of empire (Brumfiel 1983, 1987b; Calnek 1982; Carrasco 1984b, 1999; Hicks 1992; Hodge 1996:42-43). Further, the inter­mingling of tribute territories provided a strong measure of economic integration within and across alliance borders (Hicks 1984; Nielsen 1996); that is, in addition to its own subject communities nearby that supplied revenue to it exclusively, each of the three capitals held tributary lands in the domains of the other two alliance members.2 In a similar manner, meritorious nobles were rewarded with the rights to produce from parcels far removed from their traditional seat of power. Royal stewards supervised the complex collection of tribute, and receipt of revenues from widely dispersed fields depended on participation in the imperial system (Berdan and Anawalt 1992:48; Carrasco 1999:429-430; Hodge 1996:40). Under this com­plex arrangement, the divisions within the Triple 
Alliance appear more as historical tradition than political reality. 
The successful integration and expansion of the Triple Alliance empire, however, should not over­shadow the fact that the centralization of authority was incomplete. While Triple Alliance capitals were strongly allied for purposes of extending military conquest and enforcing tribute payments from over a wide extractive network, each stood at the head of its own territorial domain of dependent city-states and its own military units; within this domain, the , relationship between ruler and his subject peoples was considered inviolable (Alva Ixtlilxochitl 1985:122; Evans 2001; Gibson 1956,1971; Motolinfa 1971:353; Parsons 1971:209; Smith 2000; Torquemada 1975-83:1:242). Moreover, tribal affiliation and city-state allegiance were enduring political forces (Brumfiel 1994:94; Gib­son 1964:20-23; Lockhart 1992: 14; Smith 2000:585), as well as sources of tension, that rein­forced territorial divisions within the coalition. Hos­tilities between Triple Alliance members, particularly between the Mexica and Acolhua, per­sisted up to the time of the Spanish Conquest (Alva Ixtlilxochitl 1985:215-218; Gillespie 1998:235-236). Indeed, Cortes readily obtained the assistance ofTexcocan forces in the final overthrow of Tenochtitlan (Diaz 1956:391-401), in a move revealing major fault lines in Aztec political orga­nization. 
Economic Organization of the Imperial Core 
To the extent that Triple Alliance territories per­sisted as distinct administrative entities, we know relatively little about the impact of these internal political boundaries on economic activities within the Aztec core, particularly on the movement of goods through exchange. During the period imme­diately preceding the Triple Alliance, political bor­ders between groups of confederated polities limited exchange to some extent, creating distinct boundaries in the distribution of basic goods such as ceramics (Hodge and Mine 1990; Mine et al. 1994 ). With the end of overt hostilities, many Aztec scholars have argued that the pax azteca removed political barriers to trade, permitting widespread economic interaction and the emergence of a regional market system in the Basin (Bray 1972; Blanton et al. 1993: 152; Hicks 1987; Smith 1979).

Initially, the rapid spread and near ubiquitous dis­tribution of Aztec Black-on-Orange ceramics-the hallmark of Aztec influence-suggested partici­pation in Basin-wide exchange systems. Further, the rise of ( 1) large, urban populations at Tenochti­tlan, Texcoco, and other centers, and (2) a diverse and specialized economy in both subsistence and craft goods, would appear to require a high degree of regional integration and market exchange to bring producers and consumers together (Berdan 2005 :50; Calnek 1978; Hicks 1987; Sanders et al. 1979). 
For example, Tenochtitlan was clearly not self­sufficient in agricultural production and relied heav­ily on the market system to feed its urban population (Calnek 1972; Rojas 1986, 2001); Parsons (1976) suggests that up to 40-50 percent of the foodstuffs needed to feed ca. 150,000-200,000 persons were obtained through the market on a daily basis. Con­versely, the intensive agricultural regime of the chi­nampas of southern Lakes Chalco-Xochimilco (Calnek 1975; Parsons et al. 1982; Rojas Rabiela 
1985), the specialized production of maguey and nopal in the more arid piedmont (Parsons 1971 :252; Evans 1990; Nichols et al. 2000), the intensive pro­duction of salt and the harvest of fish, birds, and aquatic insects along the shores of ancient Lake Texcoco (Parsons 1994, 1996, 2001, 2006; Parsons and Morett 2005), as well as the concentrated man­ufacture of basic goods such as obsidian blades (Parry 2001; Spence 1985) and ceramic figurines in the Teotihuacan subvalley (Charlton et al. 1991, 1993; Nichols 1994; Otis Charlton 1994) all point to a level of specialization in both primary and sec­ondary production that could best develop in the context of a regionally integrated economy (Berdan 2005:40-41, 50; Smith 2003a:132-133).3 
Yet attempts to demonstrate the extent of 
_ 
regional integration attained by market exchange 
' have yielded mixed results. On one hand, some support for a regional system is provided by archae­ological and ethnohistoric studies that report the increased availability of nonlocal utilitarian goods at Basin communities, indicating the functioning of a regional exchange network (Brumfiel 1976: 198, 1980, 1991 ), and the presence of exotic goods in both commoner and elite households, sug­gesting the widespread use of market networks (Berdan and Smith 2003; Smith 1994; Smith and Hodge 1994:24). 
Further, detailed historic accounts clearly indi­cate that a hierarchy of market centers, defined on the basis on periodicity and range of goods offered, existed, and played a major role in integrating the diverse Aztec economy. The highest level of this hierarchy consisted of the large, urban markets held daily in the centers of Tenochtitlan-Tlatelolco and Texcoco, which offered a broad array of both elite and utilitarian goods and served tens of thousands of market participants on a typical day (Cortes 1963:72-73; Diaz 1956:215-17; Las Casas 1967:Vol. I:367; Sahagun 1950-1982:8:67-69). Below these urban markets, a series of smaller, periodic markets served outlying communities at intervals of 5, 13 and 20 days. In the pioneering application of Central Place Theory (CPT) to the Basin of Mexico, Smith ( 1979) argued that these markets were well-integrated into a single, Basin­wide exchange system centered on Tenochtitlan­Tlatelolco. Based on market periodicity, size, and the regular geographic distribution of economic central places, Smith further concluded that this regional system was governed by the commercial principal (K = 3), in which market locations opti­mize access to consumers. Such a model assumes the unrestricted movement of goods, people, and information within the region and implies a high degree of connectivity among centers in which all sectors of the population had access to multiple mar­ketplaces (King 1984; C. Smith 1974:168-169).4 
On the other hand, there is a parallel body of evidence that suggests that significant economic divisions persisted in the Basin under imperial Aztec rule. Three separate lines of evidence point to subregional systems of exchange that appear at odds with the concept of Basin-wide economic integration. 
Analyses of Market System Infrastructure 
Initial CPT analyses of the Basin of Mexico iden­tified a commercial market system for the Late Aztec period in large part from the regular loca­tional patterning of Aztec settlements and on the apparent coordination of market days among adja­cent centers (Smith 1979; cf Evans 1980). How­ever, most of these central places were established during the preceding Early Aztec period, a time of considerable conflict and shifting alliances between city-state polities. Given the extent to which this political instability appears to have limited

exchange (Hodge and Mine 1990; Mine et al. 1994), it now seems probable that the geographic spacing of Aztec settlements had more to do with reducing conflict in the Early Aztec period than maximizing access to consumers during the Late Aztec period. 
In a more recent CPT analysis, Blanton (1996) focused instead on historical change in market loca­tions under imperial Aztec rule. Based on devia­tions from an idealized commercial arrangement of market centers, Blanton argues against an inte­grated market network in the Basin. Rather, he sug­gests that the Aztec elite intentionally meddled in the market system (by granting or removing the right to hold a market) in order to disconnect eco­nomic growth from local political systems and reduce potential competitors' influence by limiting their access to wealth finance through market taxes (1996:70). These imperial actions effectively pre­cluded the development of a truly commercial sys­tem. The result was a strongly, although not entirely, dichotomous regional system (consisting of a dual hierarchy of linearly interlocked market centers focused on Tenochtitlan and Texcoco) that was largely a holdover from Early Aztec times (Blan­tonl 996:72). 
The apparent east-west division observed in settlement location is supported by network analy­ses of major transportation routes (canals, cause­ways, and roads), which also suggest that regional economic divisions persisted under imperial rule (Blantonl996:56, 79-80; Santley 1986, 1991). Based on early historical maps of the Basin, these analyses found that routes typically connected lin­ear strings of settlements, generating relatively poor connectivity among Aztec communities, except in the area immediately around Tenochtit­lan. Santley (1 986) argues for a dual dendritic structure in the transportation network (more closely adhering to the K = 4 or transport princi­pal for central places) reflecting imperial concerns for channeling bulk foodstuffs into the largest urban centers of Tenochtitlan and Texcoco, but only poorly supported increased economic inte­gration among other communities.5 Blanton (1996:80) sees more lateral connections between centers than would be expected if the transporta­tion network primarily served as an urban feeder system, but acknowledges the persistence of two subregional systems. 
Ceramic Stylistic Analyses 
The widespread distribution and standardized appearance of Aztec III Black-on-Orange ceram­ics was offered early on as evidence of regional eco­nomic integration (Sanders et al.1979; Parsons et al. 1982:373-374). However, this picture of uni­form distribution has been challenged on several fronts. Through an examination of serving vessel assemblages from sites along the eastern side of the Basin, Hodge and Mine ( 1990) found that the city­states in the southeast quarter of the Basin (lxta­paluca, Chalco, Tenango, and Amecameca) had significantly lower proportions of Late Aztec Black-on-Orange than those further north. This sharp decline in the rate of consumption of "imperial-style" ceramics with distance from Tenochtitlan Jed us to conclude that participation in the basin-wide exchange system of Tenochtitlan Black-on-Orange ceramics was not uniform, nor was it coterminous with the extent of imperial con­trol (Hodge and Mine 1990:43 1 ). Rather, we sug­gest that Chalco's relatively impoverished ceramic assemblage was a direct result of political factors: its late (and unwilling) entry into the empire, and the demotion (if not destruction) of its market cen­ter as a major port of trade. 
Further, a more detailed stylistic analysis of Black-on-Orange ceramics revealed these ceram­ics to be less uniform than previously thought. Hodge (1 990, 1992) found a significant percent­age of these vessels bear, in addition to their stan­dardized wall decoration, a variety of distinct wall motifs or decorative elements. Spatial analyses indicated that while some motifs were universally distributed throughout the Basin, others were con­centrated in the northern, central, or southern parts of the Basin, indicating that localized or subre­gional distribution systems were in operation (Hodge 1992:440; Hodge et al. 1993). Hodge con­cluded that these localized motif distributions cor­respond better to the major political divisions within the Basin than they did to hypothetical market regions based on CPT analyses. Most notably, the distribution of Black-on-Orange motifs highlights significant assemblage differences between Acol­hua territory controlled by Texcoco and more southerly portions of the Basin controlled by Tenochtitlan, again suggesting a marked decline in exchange across that border. For example, the hor­izontal bar motif accounts for 60 percent of motifs

on the top face (Type IIA,B,D) were primarily found within the Acolhua zone, centered on Tex­coco and extending south to the Ixtapalapa penin­sula (Fig 2B). Further afield, however, the agreement between whorl style and political affil­iation apparently declines. The Teotihuacan sub­valley, incorporated into the empire under Acolhua control, shows a predominance of the "Mexica" Type I whorls, whereas Chalco, ultimately under Tenocha rule, maintained a distinctive whorl style of its own (Type IIC-CC). 
Compositional Analyses of Aztec Decorated Ceramics 
Over the past two decades, a suite of compositional studies of Aztec ceramics have identified multiple centers of ceramic production and have begun to trace the exchange of pottery within and outside the Basin (Hodge et al. 1992, 1993; Skoglund et al.2006; Mine 1994; Mine et al. 1994; Mine 2006a; Neff et al. 2000; Nichols et al. 2002; Smith et al. 2006). Analyses of "imperial style" Late Aztec Black-on-Orange vessels from the eastern and southern Basin initially identified three chemically distinct "clay groups," which were associated with ceramic production in Texcoco, Chalco, and Culhuacan-lxtapalapa (Hodge et al. 1992, 1993). These clays groups represent a direct continuation of Early Aztec ceramic production at these sites and, like the Early Aztec case (Mine 1994; Mine et al. 1994), the samples from each production source tended to concentrate geographically. That is, the majority of pottery samples in the Texcoco paste group come from Acolhua territory, while ceramic samples assigned to the Chalco and Ixta­palapa clay groups were recovered from the south­ern part of the Basin in areas under Mexica control. Further, 93 percent of the Late Aztec sample could be assigned to one of these three composition groups. The fact that so few of these ceramics did not match the local compositional profiles was sur­prising and suggested a lower level of exchange with other regions than expected (Hodge et al. 1993:15 1). 
In the most detailed analysis of Aztec decorated ceramics to date,6 Nichols et al. (2002) compared wares from three wide-spread Basin sites: Chalco in the southern Basin, Cerro Portezuelo (near Aztec Chimalhuacan) east of Lake Texcoco, and Xalto­can in the northern Basin. While each of the Basin sites illustrated a unique developmental history, two trends appear to accompany the imposition of imperial rule: (1) a sharp reduction in the number of more distant trading partners and an increased reliance on local and nearby ceramic producers; and 
(2) an influx of pottery from Tenochtitlan and Tex­coco at these outlying sites (Nichols et al. 2002:72-73). At Xaltocan, for example, the pre­imperial Aztec community enjoyed a diverse range of ceramic imports, with roughly half of the deco­rated ceramics coming from nonlocal sources, including those in the far southern Basin. Follow­ing Xaltocan's incorporation into Mexica territory, however, the sources of ceramics shifted radically: Red Ware pottery (accounting for almost 70 per­cent of the decorated assemblage) became largely a local product, whereas Black-on-Orange ceram­ics were imported primarily from Tenochtitlan. Overall, the study suggests that, rather than a gen­eral expansion of trade as expected under a com­mercial model, the pax azteca was marked by increasing regionalization of trade networks in which direct economic ties between the imperial capitals and the hinterlands predominated (Nichols et al. 2002:72-73). 
In sum, the accumulated evidence presented above suggests that while imperial rule increased exchange among some communities within the Basin, localized or subregional distribution sys­tems operated within the Aztec core. However, the spatial scale, nature, and significance of these sys­tems remains poorly understood. Do they, for exam­ple, represent the persistence of local traditions within an over-arching framework of regionally integrated market exchange, or do they reflect major economic divisions within the Basin? What is the geographic scale and patterning of these sub­regional systems? Do they correspond to major political units within the Basin, or do they reflect underlying differences in the economic focus or productive capacity of a region?

analyses of this ceramic ware, it is possible to demonstrate both the strength of economic divi­sions as well as map their boundaries for a signif­icant portion of the Basin. 
Stylistic similarities in ceramic assemblages have long been employed as a general measure of the degree of economic interaction among com­munities, in that similarities may arise from direct access to the same producers and goods, indirect access through redistribution and exchange (Fry 1979, 1980; Plog 1976, 1978; Riley 1984; Shep­hard 1980:348-352), or through imitation or par­ticipation in the same set of learned technical practices and decorative traditions (Hegmon 1992:526-527; Rice 1987:252-258). Within the context of a market economy, Hirth (1998) argued that market participation results in an increase in the homogeneity of material culture assemblages at the community and regional level, because the market system makes the same types of resources available to all households, regardless of their social status or ethnicity. Ceramic stylistic analyses thus have the advantage of providing a readily imple­mented, cost-effective measure of economic inter­action and the widespread coverage to reveal regional patterns (Mine 2006b). A distinct disad­vantage of these analyses, however, is that the degree of contact or interaction is implied, not demonstrated, based on subjective evaluations of stylistic, formal, or typological similarities. 
Compositional studies of ceramic clays, in con­trast, provide a more direct measure of economic interaction and enable archaeologists to reconstruct key aspects of ceramic exchange systems (Arnold et al. 1991; Bishop and Blackman 2002; Bishop and Neff 1989; Glascock and Neff 2003; Mine 2008; Neff 1992; Neff and Glascock 1995). Natural clay sources carry a unique "signature" of trace­elements, reflecting the distinctive geochemistry of their parent material and history of clay formation processes. Based on their trace-element composi­tion, ceramic vessels can be linked to a given clay source, allowing us to map the movement of goods from production areas to consumers. The analysis of regional exchange systems, however, requires that we analyze a large number of samples to dis­tinguish the products of various local producers and to map patterns of distribution with a sufficient level of spatial detail, making this approach a sig­nificantly more costly option. To the extent that both approaches can be combined, we gain in both spa­tial cover and increased scientific rigor. 
Drawing on the Basin of Mexico survey col­lections, this study utilizes both stylistic analyses and compositional analyses of Red Ware ceramics to illustrate regional variation in exchange interac­tions over a significant portion of the imperial core. The study area represents a large (ca. 1500 km2) contiguous block from the eastern and southern portions of the Basin of Mexico containing core ter­ritories of the two dominant Triple Alliance mem­bers, Tenochtitlan and Texcoco. The northeastern portion of the study area (east of Lake Texcoco) represents areas underTexcocan control, including the subject city-states of Tepetlaoztoc, Chiautla, Huexotla, Coatlinchan, Chimalhuacan, Coatepec, and Ixtapaluca, as well as the capital Texcoco. The more northerly polities had formed the core of the Acolhua confederation since their migration into the Basin in the 12th century. Chimalhuacan, Coatepec, and Ixtapaluca were more peripheral buffer states in pre-imperial times (Alden 1979; Parsons 1971:229-230), but were firmly part of the Acolhua territory under the Triple Alliance. 
In contrast, much of the southern and south­western portions (i.e. western Ixtapalapa peninsula and Lakes Chalco-Xochimilco) came under Mex­ica control. Seven of the nine kingdoms initially constituting the territory of Tenochtitlan under the Tepanec are represented here, including Culhuacan, Ixtapalapa, Mexicaltzingo, Huizilopochco, Xochimilco, Cuitlahuac, and Mixquic. To these were added the southeastern Basin polities of Chalco, Tenango, Tlalmanalco, and Amecamea, after their defeat in 1465. The great capital of Tenochtitlan falls just outside and west of the study area. 
The maximum extent of Mexica and Acolhua jurisdiction in the Basin can be closely approxi­mated from documentary evidence (Gerhard 1993; Gibson 1956, 1971;Hodge 1994, 1996;Hodgeand Blanton 1996). Based on the distribution of city­state centers owing allegiance to the Triple Alliance capitals, Texcocan control clearly extended as far south as Coatepec and Ixtapaluca and their depen­dent communities (Alva lxtlilxochitl 1985:129-132; Gibson 1971:384; Hodge 1996: Figures 2.4 and 2.5), whereas Cortes' comment that Tlalmanalco was on the Acolhua frontier can be taken to indicate the maximum northern extent

ofMexica control (Gibson 1964: 15). Communities north of this line were dependencies of Texcoco; communities south and west of this line owed alle­giance to Tenochtitlan. 
Late Aztec Red Wares 
Although the Aztec empire is generally associated with the distinctive Black-on-Orange ceramic types, Red Wares were an important and prevalent component of the serving vessel assemblage throughout Aztec times (Branstetter-Hardesty 1978; Garraty 2000, 2006; Mine 1994; O'Neill 1956-57, 1962;Parsons 1966;Sejourne 1983;Tol­stoy 1958; Whalen and Parsons 1982). Red wares were especially popular during the Late Aztec period, and accounted for more than half of the dec­orated assemblage in some areas of the Basin (Hodge and Mine 1990, 1991; Nichols et al. 2002:67). Based on their range of vessel forms and decoration, Red Wares may have been a somewhat higher status ceramic than the more familiar Black­on-Orange types. Red Ware forms are almost exclu­sively serving vessels, including bowls, goblets (copas), pitchers, and plates, whereas Black-on­Orange types also feature food preparation vessels such as grater bowls (molcajetes). Red Wares also demonstrate a greater range in the amount of energy invested in decoration, from relatively simple to elaborate multicolor designs representing a true polychrome tradition. 
As a ware, Aztec guinda ceramics are identified by their well-slipped and polished surfaces rang­ing in color from terra cotta to deep red. Types are traditionally defined within this ware based on the number and choice of paint colors applied over the basal red slip (hence Black-on-Red, Black-and­White-on-Red, Yellow-on-Red, etc.), while within each type, stylistic variants denote distinct ways of organizing or dividing up the design field (e.g. ver­tical, horizontal, or diagonal panels) as established by the dominant paint color (see Hodge and Mine 1991; Mine 1994; Noguera 1930; Parsons 1966; Tolstoy 1958). During the Late Aztec period, how­ever, this stylistic variation in Red Ware pottery was cross-cut by two distinctive paste types, each with associated differences in vessel form and decora­tion (Mine 1994). Both types are found in associ­ation with Aztec III and III/IV Black-on-Orange pottery in excavated contexts and surface collec­

tions from the Basin of Mexico (Gonzalez Rul 1988; Mine l 994:Il:531-581; O'Neill 1962; Par­sons 1966; Sejourne 1983; Solis and Morales 1991), indicating that they represent two distinc­tive, but contemporaneous, ceramic traditions. 
The first Red Ware type represents a direct con­tinuation of Early Aztec or pre-imperial technical and stylistic traditions. The dominant form is the simple, hemispherical bowl with rounded walls of fairly even thickness, and a simple, direct lip. Dur­ing the Late Aztec, painted decoration on these bowls is quite simple, and generally consists of sets of vertical-to-oblique black lines spaced around the vessel, which Parsons (1966:217) termed the comb motif (Figure 3). Pastes for this "Comb Vari­ant" are typically of medium texture and well­oxidized, ranging from buff to red-brown in color. 
In addition, however, Late Aztec potters began to produce new vessel forms, using a distinctive new "Late Paste." The predominant form is the small bowl with thin, out-sloping walls and sharp basal angles. Many of these bowls have rims with a characteristic exterior thickening or bulge below

a thinned lip. Decoration can be quite elaborate, and ranges from complex curvilinear designs executed in fine black or graphite paint, to the multiple lay­ering of paint colors needed to create intricate Black-and-White-on-Red designs (Figure 4 ). Rarely, these out-sloping bowls bear the simple comb motif, but differences in vessel form and paste clearly distinguish these vessels as belong­ing to the Late Paste group. Equally distinctive but far less common are the barrel-shaped bowls asso­ciated with Yellow-on-Red or Black-and-Red-on­Tan decoration, and a series of finely made and very thin-walled bowls with out-sloping walls and elab­orate, polychrome decoration. For all these new forms, pastes are very fine in texture and typically poorly oxidized, at times showing only a thin veneer of buff paste over a grey or black core in cross­section. 
Textural and petrographic analyses suggest that these new Red Ware pastes were accompanied by a significant change in ceramic technology and possibly in clay resources, as well. Although both paste types contain the same general suite of min­eral inclusions, the Late Paste bowls consistently show a more refined ceramic body with signifi­cantly less as well as smaller aplastic inclusions. Conversely, these ceramics reveal a much higher incidence of fiber temper, probably from the intro­duction of cattail fiber known locally as plumilla.7 Overall, these changes in ceramic pastes suggest a shift away from the naturally "tempered" and some­what coarser, upland clays, and an increasing uti­lization of finer, naturally levigated (refined) clays of the lake bed (Branstetter-Hardesty 1978: 136) that presumably required the addition of plumilla to be workable.

Spatial and Stylistic Analyses of Aztec Red Wares 
Regional data on the distribution of these two Late Aztec guinda paste types and their variants are drawn from the Basin of Mexico settlement survey collections. The focus here is on the Texcoco, Ixta­palapa, Chalco, and Xochimilco survey regions, within which ceramic data were collected using a consistent field methodology and for which the basic information on site location, size, and chronology have been published (Blanton 1972; Parsons 1971; Parsons et al. 1982; Parsons et al. 1983; Sanders et al. 1979). In an intensive field­by-field survey effort, these early surveys located, mapped, and described settlements over much of the upland portions of the Basin. The surveys also generated surface collections, consisting of a 100 percent pick-up of diagnostic sherds (defined as all rims and chronologically significant body sherds) from one or more collection areas designated witbin the mapped surface scatter of a site. The number of collection areas and the total sherd count from any one site vary depending on site size and com­plexity, with the number of decorated sherds col­lected ranging from 10 to more than 3,000 per site. 
Although these surface collections were initially designed to monitor the temporal placement of each site, tbey provide a uniquely broad-based perspec­tive on ceramic distribution patterns for studies on a regional scale (Hodge and Mine 1991; Mine 1994; Mine et al. 1994; Mine 2006b). 
Within the study area, field teams originally located and mapped 541 sites witb Late Aztec occu­pation (Parsons et al. 1983) and made surface col­lections at 372 of these sites.8 From the available collections, a subset of 229 sites ( 42 percent of all Late Aztec sites mapped in the study region) was examined for typological and stylistic analyses. Site selection was based on collection size and con­dition, and was stratified to obtain both a balanced geographic coverage and adequate representation for tbe full range of the settlement hierarchy, from small hamlets to regional centers. Geographically, site representation varies by survey region; a lower percent of mapped sites were analyzed from the Ixtapalapa (32 percent) and Xochimilco (36 per­cent) regions, than from the Texcoco (57 percent) and Chalco (43 percent) regions, owing to the reduced availability of collections. The sample also tends to under-represent smaller sites; over 75 per­cent of known villages and centers are represented in the study, whereas only 35 percent of hamlets and small hamlets were examined. 
All decorated ceramics were tabulated by type, variant, and subvariant; type counts were then stan­dardized as density of sherds per hectare of col­lection area at a given site. Sherd density is interpreted here as primarily reflecting differences in the availability of a ceramic type as a function of distance from its center of distribution, although differences in surface survey conditions or settle­ment density can also affect this measure (Mine 2006b:88-89). Regionally, however, ceramic types are most available and abundant near their pro­duction source, and decline in availability with dis­tance from that source. Distribution maps illustrating variability in the densities of the two main types-the Comb Variant and Late Paste bowls-are presented in Figures 5a and 6a. 
In addition, density contour maps were gener­ated to illustrate geographic patterns of ceramic distribution within the study area. These contour maps even-out extremely local perturbations in type density through a process of spatial averaging (Mine 2006b:88), and clarify regional trends in type distribution. The geographic trends in the dis­tribution of Comb Variant and Late Paste bowls are then contrasted with Triple Alliance borders in Fig­ures Sb and 6b. 
The density distributions of these dominant Late Aztec Red Ware types present a very compelling picture: this portion of the Basin was sharply divided into two subregions with very distinctive Red Ware assemblages. The relatively simple Comb Variant bowls clearly dominate east of Lake Texcoco and occur throughout the Tex coco survey region (Figure 5a). The heaviest densities occur in the core of the Acolhua domain centered on Tex­coco proper. Beyond the study area to the north, this variant predominates in the Teotihuacan sub­valley, where it is a phase-marker for Late Aztec occupation (Parsons 1966:225). To the south of Texcoco, however, Comb Variant densities decline sharply. Only scattered occurrences of the type are found in Chalco-Tenango piedmont, and the Comb Variant is almost non-existent in lakebed settle­ments of the Lakes Chalco-Xochimilco chinampa district. 
In contrast, Late Paste bowls with out-sloping

walls, although less abundant overall, display a complementary distribution (Figure 6a). These ves­sels are clearly concentrated in the south and south­west around Lakes Chalco-Xochimilco, with the greatest densities found in the western end of Lake Xochimilco, in the environs of the capital Tenochti­tlan just outside our study area. This vessel type appears to dominate assemblages at Tenochtitlan proper, as well. For example, within the assem­blage of 73 polished red ware bowls illustrated from the El Volador collection, all but one display the characteristic vessel form of the Late Profile bowls (Solis and Morales 1991). Other, lower fre­quency Late Paste forms duplicate this NE-SW division. Thus, the barrel-shapedbowlswithBlack­and-Red-on-Tan decoration were found primarily in the Texcoco survey region between Chimalhua­can and Tepetlaoztoc, while barrel-shaped bowls with Yellow-on-Red decoration are largely restricted to the southern lake bed. 
The strong spatial patterning observed in these type distributions suggests the presence of two dis­tinct market spheres circulating different Red Ware types. These data are thus consistent with previous studies (discussed above) indicating that subre­gional exchange systems operated within the Basin under imperial rule. In addition, however, the regional perspective provided by the survey col­lections permits further insights into the scale and organization of these systems. 
Three main observations on the regional orga­nization of ceramic exchange are offered here. First, the subregional market systems conform spatially to Late Aztec political territories. Red Ware ves­sels bearing the simple comb motif are associated with the region controlled by Texcoco under the Triple Alliance, while Late Profile vessels are largely associated with thatportion of the study area controlled directly by Tenochtitlan. The boundary between these two spheres closely follows the polit­ical boundary dividing the territories of Texcoco from Tenochtitlan, in a line extending southeast from Chalco to Tlalmanalco. Second, the assem­blage differences between subregions are clearly

quite strong, indicating that minimal ceramic exchange occurred between the market spheres. Relative to the political borders mapped here, over 95 percent of Comb Mofif vessels fall within the Texcocan sphere (Figure Sb), while 95 percent of the Late Profile vessels occur in the Tenochtitlan­controlled sphere (Figure 6b ). Finally, the Chalco area emerges as a zone of overlap, in which both ceramic traditions are represented, but in fairly low densities. 
Compositional Analyses of 
Late Aztec Red Wares 

In order to verify that these restricted distributions reflect subregional exchange systems, a subset of the Red Ware ceramics were analyzed for their trace-element composition using Instrumental Neu­tron Activation Analysis (INAA). Such chemical analyses enable us to determine vessel provenance based on the trace-element signature of their clays and to monitor the distribution of vessels from their production source. 
A total of 255 Late Aztec Red Ware bowls were analyzed as part of this study. Drawing primarily from the Basin of Mexico survey collections, sam­ples of both guinda paste types were selected from across their geographic range within the Texcoco, Ixtapalapa, Chalco, and Xochimilco survey zones. This geographic coverage was supplemented with a small collection of surface materials from sites located on the western shore of ancient Lake Tex­coco (Mayer-Oakes 1959), in order to include sites in the immediate environs of Tenochtitlan.9 
The Comb Variant is represented here by 122 rounded bowls, all clearly bearing the characteris­tic Black-on-Red decoration and simple comb motif. This sample comes primarily from the north­eastern portion of the study area (from Tepetlaoz­toc south to Chimalhuacan), although examples from as far south as Chalco and Tenango were included. The second paste type is represented by

133 Late Paste bowls, and includes examples of both out-sloping and barrel-shaped bowls and their most common variants. The majority of these sam­ples originate from the Lake Chalco-Xochimilco area, although approximately 15 percent of the samples come from the Texcoco survey region. 
All samples of Red Ware pottery were prepared and analyzed by the author, following now stan­dard INAA procedures for archaeological ceram­ics.10 Following irradiation, the trace-element composition of guinda pottery was characterized along a profile of 25 elements representing the stan­dard suite of the more precise intermediate and long half-life elements consistently employed in the analysis of archaeological ceramics. 
Multivariate statistics were employed to iden­tify groups of samples with similar elemental com­position, distinct from other such groups, with each group representing a distinct clay or production source. The analysis proceeded through three phases: (1) preliminary group formation utilizing a combination of bivariate and multivariate tech­niques (including scatter plots and principal com­ponents analysis) to gain initial insight into possible groups within the data set; (2) group refinement to create statistically homogeneous core groups dis­tinct from other such groups based on the multi­variate probability of group membership (usually calculated from the Mahalanobis D2 statistic); and 
(3) classification of noncore members into their most likely compositional group based on dis­criminant function analysis or other statistical mea­sures of group membership (Bishop and Neff 1989; Glascock 1992; GlascockandNeff2003). Because the final classification is based on the statistical certainty of group membership in multivariate space, the result is the identification of robust "com­position groups" reflecting distinct clay sources or production areas. 
For the Basin of Mexico, the identification of distinctive clay sources is generally facilitated by regional differences in bedrock geology that gen­erate strong spatial patterns in the trace-element composition of ceramic clays weathered from dif­ferent parent materials. Magmas of primarily andesitic and dacitic composition form the Sierra Madre east of the Basin, and contrast with a province of largely basalts and basaltic andesites south of ancient Lake Chalco-Xochimilco (Garcia­Palomo et al. 2002; G6mez-Tuena et al. 2007; INEGI 1994; Schlaepfer 1968). These bedrock types create predictable differences in element con­centrations, particularly for the transition metals characteristic of mafic minerals. We therefore see along the eastern side of the Basin a clear increase from north to south in the chromium and iron con­tent relative to aluminum in ceramic pastes, which makes recognition of upland clay sources relatively straightforward (Figure 7). 
In contrast, the utilization of lacustrine clays for fine paste Late Aztec Red Wares presents a chal­lenge in recognizing the products of different sources. At lower elevations, the effects of erosion and redeposition have reworked and blurred geo­chemical distinctions, while the relative degree of weathering has introduced new dimensions of vari­ation reflecting differences in topography. As a result, within the lakebed environment, element concentrations generally represent a continuum of variation, within which clay groups are recognized, not by hard breaks, but by trends and modalities in multidimensional space. 
Once composition groups have been defined, provenance is established by matching these groups to production debris from a known source or to nat­ural clays based on trace-element and mineralogi­cal characteristics. According to historic records, at least six cities in the Basin of Mexico were major producers of ceramics in early colonial times: Tenochtitlan-Tlatelolco, Texcoco, Cuauhtitlan, Azcapotzalco, Huitzilopochco, and Xochimilco (Barlow 1951; Branstetter-Hardesty 1978:26; Gib­son 1964:350). It is likely that these centers repre­sent the continuation of a late prehispanic tradition. 11 Previous compositional analyses of Aztec ceramics have successfully identified the trace-element signature for the first three of these centers, and have added Chalco, Chimalhuacan (Cerro Portezuelo), Xaltocan, and Otumba­Teotihuacan to the list of active ceramic-producing regions for the Late Aztec period (Hodge et al. 1992, 1993; Mine 1994; Mine et al. 1994; Nichols et al. 2002; Rodriguez-Alegria et al. 2003). 
For this study, the determination of provenance linking observed composition groups with historic centers of ceramic production draws on a body of nearly 900 Postclassic ceramic samples from the Basin and adjacent regions, including a large num­ber of wasters representing lacustrine clays sur­rounding Lakes Texcoco, Xaltocan, and

times, it is possible to suggest a more specific source within this geographic spread based on his­toric records. In general, however, provenance labels are given for a source area with the under­standing that these reflect general and not site­specific production locales. 
Late Aztec Centers of Red Ware Production 
The trace-element data indicate that multiple regions were producing the Late Aztec Red Ware bowls recovered within the study area. East of Lake Texcoco, clay sources distinctively low and high in the transition metals characterize the northern and southern reaches of the study area, respectively. In the mid-latitudes of the study area, variation in some of the incompatible elements (Ba, Rb, Hf, Th, and Ta) mark east-west differences across Lake Tex coco. 
Overall, seven distinctive source regions were identified, provisionally associated with the sites of Tepetlaoztoc, Texcoco, the Texcocan piedmont, Chalco, Xochimilco, Tenochtitlan, and Cuauhtit­lan (Tables I and 2). Three of these (Tepetlaoztoc, Chalco, and Cuauhtitlan) are represented by rela­tively small groups that are distinctive in bivariate element space. The Tepetlaoztoc group is charac­terized by extremely low concentrations of chromium and scandium, while Chalco group members are clearly recognized by their high chrom ium content. The recognized north-south trend in these elements provides a strong basis for assigning provenance. In contrast, the Cuauhtitlan group is distinguished by high hafnium:iron ratios characteristic of lacustrine clays and plain wares from that region. 
The four remaining composition groups were sufficiently large to evaluate for internal coherency using the Mahalanobis distance statistic.13 Multi­variate probabilities of group membership con­firmed the separation of these main groups, and demonstrated that samples assigned to the three smaller groups were clearly distinct in multivari­ate space. Group separation is illustrated along dis­criminant function axes in Figure 8. Of the total sample of 255 vessels, 247 (97 percent) could be classified to one of these seven sources. Samples that could not be securely assigned to one of these sources are not geographically restricted and may well be outliers of the groups already identified. 
Range of Ceramic Products 
An examination of the range of Red Wares pro­duced by each source reveals clear regional patterns (Table 3). Producers located in the Texcocan region focused production primarily on the Comb Variant (Black-on-Red Variant C); 100 percent of ceram­ics associated with the northeastern Tepetlaoztoc and Piedmont sources bear the comb motif. This percentage declines to the south and west: 62 per­cent of vessels associated with the Texcoco source bear the comb motif, but only 43 percent of ves­sels originating from the Chalcan source were dec­orated in this manner. Along the western side of Lake Texcoco within the Mexica domain, only Tenochtitlan appears to have produced comb motif vessels in any volume (20 percent). 
In contrast, western sources (Xochimilco, Tenochtitlan, and Cuauhtitlan) clearly dominate in the production of the Late Paste vessels, with over 80 percent of their respective assemblages com­prised of Late Profile Black-on-Red, Black-and­White-on-Red, and/or Yellow-on-Red bowls. Along the eastern shore of Lake Texcoco, only the Texcocan source appears to have engaged in the production of these more elaborate vessels (38 per­cent Late Paste). Even here, however, regional dif­ferences are apparent, as this source shows a clear preference for the Black-and-Red-on-Tan and fine Black-and-White-on-Red Variant G vessels not abundant elsewhere. Chalco, lying along the bor­der between Acolhua and Mexica provinces, pro­duced vessels in both ceramic traditions and in the most even ratio (43 percent Comb Variant/Early Paste vs. 57 percent Late Paste). 
Overall, then, the composition groups confirm the existence of two distinctive ceramic traditions associated with different, but somewhat overlap­ping, sectors of the imperial core. Although there is not a exact match-up between ceramic type and locus of production, the compositional data link the Comb Variant bowls primarily with the Acolhua region, and the Late Paste Red Ware bowls with territories under Mexica control. 
Geographic Distribution of Ceramics

Table I. Definition and Provenance of Red Ware Composition Groups. 
Ceramic Producers Associated with Areas under Acolhua Control Tepetlaoztoc (N = 12): a small, but distinctive group characterized by very low values of most transition metals 
(e.g. Cr '.". 60 ppm), but high thorium (Th :S 7.3 ppm). The low concentrations of transition metals indicate a north­
ern Basin source, but the group does not match other known northern producers such as Xaltocan and Teotihuacan/Otumba, and has distinctly lower scandium values. The concentrated distribution around Tepetlaoztoc, however, suggests an origin at or near that Late Aztec center. 
Texcoco (N = 61): generally characterized by higher barium, rubidium, and tantalum concentrations associated with the eastern shore of Lake Texcoco, but distinguished from other eastern groups by higher values of thorium (6.4-7 .6 ppm) and several rare earth elements (La, Lu, Sm). Compositionally, this group strongly overlaps Early Aztec Red Wares from Texcoco, as well as modern potters' clays from upland sources near Texcoco (Santa Cruz de Arriba). There is also a clear compositional over-lap (but not complete agreement) with Black-on-Orange ceramics attributed to the Texcoco area. This group appears to be centered on Texcoco and was almost certainly produced in that center. 
Texcocan Piedmont (N = 46): closely related to the Texcoco group, but with distinctly lower concentrations of cesium, rubidium, and thorium. A significant number of samples assigned to this group show some affiliation with 
the preceding Texcoco group as well, indicating the close geographic proximity of the two sources. This group is 
broadly distributed throughout the piedmont region east of Texcoco and Huexotla; no more specific source can be suggested at this time. 
Ceramic Producers Associated with Areas under Mexica Control Chalco area (N = 14): a small and variable group, distinctly high in chromium relative to iron and scandium, asso­ciated with the southern basin. Although the group is distinct from Early Aztec Red Wares produced in the Chalco­Tenango area, it is generally similar to Early Aztec Black/Orange from Chalco and Mixquic. This clay group almost certainly represents the limited continuation of the formerly productive ceramic industry in the Chalco region. 
Xochimilco (N = 28): a distinctive group characterized by very low levels of iron (2.5-3.1 %) and scandium. The 
low iron content superficially suggests a northern basin source; however, this group is distinguished from plain 
wares and lacustrine clays from Xaltocan and environs by higher Co:Fe and Cr: Fe ratios. Members of this group 
are concentrated within Lakes Chalco-Xochimilco, and share a general similarity with clays and orange wares from 
the Culhuacan-Ixtapalapa area. Provenance is uncertain, but one of the historically known pottery-production cen­
ters in the southwestern portion of the Basin, such as Xochimilco, is considered the most likely. 
Tenochtitlan-Ixtapalapa (N = 77): a large group with lower barium, thorium, and tantalum content, associated with the western side of Lake Texcoco. This group shows good agreement with Early Aztec Black-on-Orange from the site of Culhuacan (including both Culhuacan Black/Orange and Calligraphic Tenayuca), and overlaps lacustrine clays from Culhuacan-Ixtapalapa, as well as wasters from El Risco. These affiliations suggest a provenance extend­ing from the western tip of the Ixtapalapa peninsula north to El Risco, with a probable origin at the geographically intermediate site of Tenochtitlan proper. 
Cuauhtitlan (N = 9): a small but distinctive group among Red Wares distinguished from other western sources by high Hf:Fe ratios characteristic of lacustrine clays from the Cuauhtitlan region. Cluster analyses and discriminant function posterior classification assign both plain wares and fabric-marked wasters from the vicinity of Cuauhtitlan to this group, suggesting that these samples represent the ceramic industry of that well-known pottery center. 
majority of Red Ware bowls produced within the directly across Lake Texcoco (Table 4 ). Within the Texcocan region remained withinAcolhua territory Acolhua region, however, the products of different (Figure 9a). If we assume that Cortes' statement producers are broadly distributed in largely over­naming Tlalmanalco as the southern extent of Acol­lapping supply zones. Communities clearly had hua control is correct, only 4 out of 119 (3 percent) access to multiple sources of Red Ware ceramics, Acolhua-made bowls crossed over into Mexica ter­indicating a high-level of market choice and eco­ritory, either into the adjacent Chalco region or nomic integration at the local level.

Figure 8. Discriminant axes plots showing separation of major composition groups for Late Aztec Red Wares: (a) dif­ferences in trace-metal content between the northern Tepetlaoztoc and southern Chalco-area groups define the major dimension of variation among all Red Ware composition groups; Cr:Fe ratios clearly separate the Xochimilco and Cuauhtitlan sources; (b) separation of major Red Ware groups from the central Basin.
