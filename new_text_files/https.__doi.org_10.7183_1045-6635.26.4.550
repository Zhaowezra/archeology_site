The most archaeologically visible dimension of the Classic Maya Collapse is the abandonment of monumental royal courts. Yet, in some cases, non-elite populations lived for centuries in and around Classic Maya centers without rulers. Processes of abandonment among Classic Maya commoners are detectable and reflect their own ritual and social practices divorced from the ritual performances undertaken by the ruling elite. We study the abandonment context and chronology of three domestic groups from the Contreras Valley, an agricultural community located on the outskirts of the Classic Maya center of Minanha, Belize. There, several artifact assemblages were deposited at the time of abandonment, representing termination rituals. This study goes beyond the ideological dimension of termination rituals to examine how these ceremonies helped reshape the identity of social groups who were about to abandon their home. We explore how the last inhabitants of a mostly abandoned landscape lived through this process of gradual depopulation. Moreover, we evaluate potential explanations.for the archaeological processes behind the occurrence or non-occurrence of termination rituals in different domestic groups.

Lamoureux-St-Hilaire et al.] THE LAST GROUPS STANDING 
and on recognizing various types of abandonment (Cameron and Tomka 1993). Recent abandon­ment studies have tended to shift away from low­level inquiry to study broader social phenomena such as resilience or migration among both small­scale and complex societies (Cameron 2013; Glowacki 2015; McAnany et al. 2015). Settle­ment abandonment has garnered particular inter­est in several archaeological regions , including the lowland Maya area, where exceptional finds from rapidly abandoned sites such as Aguateca, Guatemala, and Ceren, El Salvador, have attracted particular attention (Inomata and Triadan 2010; McKee and Sheets 2003). Beyond these two rapidly abandoned sites, settlement abandonment studies have focused on the elite segment of so­ciety (Aimers 2003; Chase and Chase 2000; Ino­mata and Triadan 2010; Pagliaro et al. 2003; Stan­ton et al . 2008; Suhler and Freidel 2003). Lowland Maya abandonment research has tended to focus on abandonment ceremonies (i.e., ter­mination rituals), on the squatting and reuse of elite architecture, and on post-abandonment ven­eration and pilgrimages to monumental buildings (Inomata and Webb 2003; Mock 1998a; Navarro­Farr et al. 2008; Stanton and Magnoni, eds. 2008). 
The topics of intrasite differential abandon­ment, gradual abandonment by commoners , and social transformations during abandonment have rarely been discussed (Palka 2003: 123). Processes of abandonment among ancient Maya commoners are generally assumed to be directly related to the fate of elite groups. In other words, the col­lapse of the Classic Maya royal courts has over­shadowed the dynamics of abandonment among ancient Maya commoners. 
In this article, we argue that the processes of abandonment among Classic Maya commoners reflected their own ritual practices divorced from the ci vie-ceremonial performances undertaken by the ruling elite. Further, we also address the ques­tion of why certain domestic groups and structures were ritually terminated while others were not. We explore these questions through the study of the ancient Maya center of Minanha, Belize (Figure I), which underwent differential and gradual aban­donment of its elite and non-elite components over a period of a few centuries (ca. A.D. 810-1200). 
We first review the concepts of on-floor as­semblages and ritual termination, which have been critical components of Maya abandonment studies. We then summarize the research led by the Social Archaeology Research Program (SARP) at Mi­nanha, focusing on its settlement sampling strategy and the broader chronology of the site. During this process, we examine the Contreras Valley­a peripheral agricultural community-where six termination offerings were recovered from three commoner domestic groups. We then interpret these assemblages and explore the implications for the social groups that lived through most of the abandonment of the Contreras Valley before finally departing themselves. Finally, we examine three potential explanations for the occurrence and non-occurrence of termination offerings among the households of the Contreras Valley. 
Background: Abandonment-Related 
On-Floor Assemblages 

The abandonment of settlements can leave several different types of artifactual assemblages on the floor of architectural structures. The last inhabi­tants of these structures and their behaviors are responsible for the deposition of these on-floor assemblages and directly influence these assem­blage types (Schiffer 1972). While thinking about on-floor assemblages, we must also consider the processes that affected them after they reached the archaeological record-processes such as bio­turbation, erosion, and scavenging (Schiffer 1972, 1985). 
What probably constitutes the most common abandonment-related on-floor assemblage is pri­mary or secondary refuse left in unexpected or peripheral sections of buildings (Cameron 1993:3; LaMotta and Schiffer 1999:21; Pagliaro et al. 2003:79; Palka 2003:126-127; Schiffer 1975:56, 1976:33-34; Stanton et al. 2008; Suhler and Frei­del 2003:137). These artifacts typically consist of discarded items or small amounts of material not worth bringing away. In other instances, aban­doned structures may have been reoccupied by so-called "squatters ," who discarded a consider­able amount of trash in post-abandonment context inside or around buildings (Aimers 2003:157; Chase and Chase 2000:69; Child and Golden 2008:82; Schiffer 1985:211; Stanton and Magnoni 2008:14). Some usable items might be left behind in a storage context (see discussion below) or, in

lated termination rituals (Chase and Chase 1998, 2000, 2004; Child and Golden 2008; Demarest 2006; Freidel et al. 1998; Navarro-Farr et al. 2008; Palka 2003; Suhler and Freidel 2003; Yaeger 2010). 
Termination Rituals as Exposed Offerings 
It has been over 30 years since abandonment-re­lated termination rituals were defined for the an­cient Maya (Garber 1983:117), and they have since been related to the "Maya philosophy of the regeneration of life," also referred to as jaloj­k'exoj1(Carlsen 1997:56--58; Carlsen and Prechtel 1991; McAnany 2014; Mock l 998b). This ritual system, associated with ancestor veneration and architecture, involves dedication and rededication rituals that preclude the placement of ancestral burials and caches within buildings (Freidel et al. 1998:135; Garber 1983; Mock 1998b). 
According to thejaloj-k'exoj, dedication and rededication rituals occurring inside the buildings during their different construction phases con­ferred ch 'ulel, or life energy, to the newly con­structed building (Mock l 998b: 10; Stuart 1998:395-396). Termination rituals, upon aban­donment, served to release the ch'ulel accumu­lated by architectural structures, for the purpose of either symbolically killing the buildings (des­ecratory termination rituals) or appeasing the an­cestors (reverential termination rituals) (Chase and Chase 1998:301; Lamoureux-St-Hilaire 2011; Mock 1998a; Stanton et al. 2008:237). 
We do not adopt the concept of termination ritual uncritically. Instead, we propose a behav­ioral-contextual approach that prescribes a series of factors for recognizing abandonment-related on-floor assemblages as exposed reverential of ferings (Iannone 2000; Lamoureux-St-Hilaire 2011). An exposed reverential offering corre­sponds to a ritual-oriented artifactual assemblage found on the floor of a structure in a ceremonial context dissociated from any violent episode. By "ritual-oriented," we mean that an exposed of­fering consists of an accumulation of broken ce­ramic vessels comprising a high proportion of serving vessels and censers, as well as other fine artifacts (Lamoureux-St-Hilaire 2011). By "dis­
sociated," we mean that the assemblage was placed along the central axis of an abandoned domestic structure and was not associated with acts of destruction or scattered human remains (Lamoureux-St-Hilaire 2011). This central place­ment inside or in front of doorways symbolically hindered access to the terminated structure (Lam­oureux-St-Hilaire 2011 :34-38). In contrast, scat­tered human remains appear to be a marker of desecratory termination rituals, a type of ritual associated with military conquest recognized at several Lowland Maya sites (Harrison-Buck et al. 2007; Inomata and Ponciano 2010; Mock 1998a; Palka 2003; Suhler and Freidel 2003; Yaeger 2010). Finally, we argue that exposed rev­erential offerings should be associated with struc­tural votive features (i.e., dedication and rededi­cation caches or burials), thus associating them with a broader architectural ritual program per­taining to thejaloj-k'exoj. 
These offerings are understood to be the result of abandonment-related ceremonies that would have taken place in the structures and adjoining patios and that would have ended with the depo­sition or breaking of vessels in these contexts. We believe that, beyond playing a religious role, these ceremonies were related to the social effects of detachment from place during abandonment (Lamoureux-St-Hilaire and Iannone 2012:216; McAnany and Lamoureux-St-Hilaire 2013). 
The Social Role of Termination Rituals 
Ancient Maya elite and commoners were eco­nomically and ideologically attached to their con­structed landscape. Commoners and agricultur­alists were tied to their homeland, including their houses, surrounding fields, and orchards, which represented their belongings and sources of sus­tenance. Detachment from these resources during abandonment would have dramatically impacted the lives of commoners. Additionally, the ancient Maya buried their ancestors within this con­structed landscape (Knapp and Ashmore 1999). According to the jaloj-kexoj, these interred an­cestors ensouled houses and shrines and conferred ideological importance to the architecture. This ideational landscape (Knapp and Ashmore 1999) was erected over ancestral living spaces and en­larged with every new construction episode, building on their ancestors' legacy and creating a "genealogy of space" (McAnany 2014:100). This detachment of social groups from their eco­nomic, prestigious, and ancestral heritage must

have represented a critical process in reshaping their identity (Lamoureux-St-Hilaire and Iannone 2012:216-217). 
We suggest that termination rituals served as easing mechanisms for abandoning groups, mark­ing the passage of this social landscape from its systemic context into social memory. The serving and ceremonial vessels found in the exposed of­ferings discussed below suggest that incense burn­ing and food consumption were at the center of these ceremonies (Lamoureux-St-Hilaire 2011). These communal events, along with the symbolic closure of buildings, may have helped inhabitants to cope with the grief associated with abandon­ment and to reshape their new social identity as abandoners, or migrants (Palmer and Jankowiak 1996:240-244, 252). Taking place in a period of liminality, such a rite of passage signified a tran­sitory, defining moment for the abandoning social groups who were about to begin a new cycle of occupation elsewhere (Bloch and Parry 1982; Mock l 998b:9-l 1; Van Gennep 1909). This ritual process redefined houses by removing them from the living world and abolishing their raison d'etre: "a house without people in it is not a proper house" (Carsten and Hugh-Jones 1995:44). This animistic concept is particularly compelling given the aforementioned ritual program aimed at en­souling Maya architecture with ch 'ulel and then releasing it through termination, thus providing a parallel between mortuary and termination rit­uals (Mock 1998b:9-ll). 
Our approach to termination rituals is an at­tempt to model them in light of their social and historical context. We recognize the limits of our inferences, which are clearly rooted in our own modem understanding of religion and are there­fore inherently biased (Asad 1993). This is re­flected, for example, in our adoption of the dis­tinction between categories of termination rituals (reverential vs. desecratory). We realize that for the ancient Maya the concept of religion was likely malleable and tolerant of a variety of atti­tudes towards spirituality (Asad 1993; Turner 1995). Hence, we understand that different par­ticipants must have had their own interpretation of the values and symbols brought forth during the ceremonies that led to the deposition of ex­posed offerings (Humphrey and Laidlaw 1994; Turner 1995). In other words, while our interpre­tations of the exposed offerings presented in this paper attempt to leave room for nuances and con­tingencies, they remain interpretations. 

In summary, we suggest that the performance of termination rituals not only symbolized the re­leasing of ch'ulel from architecture in a moment of transition, but also played an important role in fashioning the social fabric of abandoning groups, thus easing detachment from place. After the per­formance of these liminal rituals, the identity of social groups probably shifted from inhabitants to abandoners. This, in tum, entailed the physical and symbolic detachment from both the con­structed and ideational landscape. These cere­monies were not necessarily dogmatic, and both their performance and interpretation may have yielded various interpretations on the part of its participants (Turner 1995). We argue that the ex­posed offerings found at Minanha and discussed in this article were deposited during such trans­formational ceremonies. 
Background: Minanha and the Social 
Archaeology Research Program 

Investigations at the Lowland Maya site of Mi­nanha were conducted by SARP under the direc­tion of Iannone from 1999 to 2010. Research was designed to address the structure, development, apogee, and abandonment of this ancient com­munity (Iannone 2009). Minanha is situated in the North Vaca Plateau of west-central Belize, between the two major sites of Caracol to the south and Naranjo to the northwest (Figure 1). After initial occupation in the Late Preclassic pe­riod (400 B.C.-A.D. 250), the Minanha commu­nity became a medium-sized polity during the Classic period (A.D. 250-810) and was progres­sively depopulated during the Terminal Classic and Early Postclassic periods (two periods span­ning A.D. 810-1200; Iannone 2005). 
The research program was designed to inves­tigate Minanha in three phases (Iannone 2009). The first phase of the program focused its exca­vations on key groups of the monumental epi­center of the site (Iannone 2009). The second phase, through a 20 percent (Site-Core) and 15 percent (Contreras Valley) random stratified sam­pling strategy adopted from the Xunantunich Ar­chaeological Project,2 excavated eight architec-

tural groups out of 39 in the Site-Core Zone (Fig­ure 2), as well as 15 groups out of 98 in the 1 km2 Contreras Valley zone (Figure 3; Iannone 
2006:2). This random stratified excavation strat­egy crosscut all settlement types, from small iso­
lated mounds to larger groups exhibiting multiple 
structures (Iannone 2006). The goal of this re­flexive sampling method was to develop a repre­sentative dataset of the whole ancient community, allowing for a fuller understanding of its devel­opmental history and its social processes, includ­ing its abandonment. The most notable advantage of this method is the possibility of extending con­clusions from the excavated sample to the wider Minanha community. Finally, the third phase of the research program focused on the broader po­litical integration and paleo-environmental dy­namics of the Nmth Vaca Plateau (Iannone 2009).

nanha were those of the royal court complex and those of the most recently settled commoner res­idential groups. These two gr-:mps-representing the top and bottom of the socio-political hierar­chy-abandoned the site at the onset of the Ter­minal Classic period (ca. A.D. 810-900). Other groups-especially the first occupants of the Con­treras Valley-continued living in the region for centuries after the polity had collapsed. 
The Abandonment of the Epicenter and Site-Core of Minanha 
The royal court of Minanha, centered at Group J, was built during the Late Classic period (A.D. 675-810; Iannone 2005:29). The royal acropolis was constructed north of Plaza A and consisted of a succession of courtyards, including Group J and functionally related groups (such as Group L; Ian­none 2005:29). Plaza A, the main public space of the site, included a ball court to the east, a few temples to the south, and a large range structure to the west, Structure l 2A, which led into an elite courtyard, Group F (Iannone 2005:29). 
At the onset of the ninth century, the vaulted structures of Group J were in-filled with stones, the frieze of the temple-pyramid was defaced, and the whole courtyard was buried under 5 m of carefully laid construction material, thus ter­minating its royal-administrative functions (Ian­none 2005:34; 2010:363). Soon after, two archi­tectural groups placed in close relation with the royal court, Groups L and F, were terminated. First, three buildings from Group L were filled with a sizable amount of artifacts, including many chipped stone tools, whole and partial ceramic vessels of all kinds, and apparently random sherds, and then purposefully collapsed (Lam­oureux-St-Hilaire 2011 :82-89; further informa­tion on the contents of all discussed on-floor as­semblages may be found in Supplemental Documents 1 and 2). Meanwhile, the Passage­Structure 12A leading to Group F was symboli­cally blocked with partial ceramic vessels, in­cluding eight jars, three bowls, a dish, and a ground stone disc, and then collapsed (Lam­oureux-St-Hilaire 2011 :55-61). These epicentral termination rituals were apparently aimed at de­activating the royal-related functions of those prominent buildings and are dated to the begin­ning of the Terminal Classic on the basis of diag­nostic ceramics, such as Platon Punctated-Incised dishes (Lamoureux-St-Hilaire 2011:89-90). Fol­lowing the abandonment of the Epicenter, the surrounding areas of the site remained occupied, with their population living without the gover­nance of a royal court (Lamoureux-St-Hilaire and Iannone 2012). 
During the Terminal Classic, Groups R and S, located in the Site-Core Zone, were aban­doned in a manner that left on-floor assemblages in one structure. Group R, located a few hundred meters east of the epicenter, consisted of a large raised platform that supported four buildings (Prince 2000). Structure 91R, the smallest of the group, revealed a small ceramic on-floor as­semblage dated to the Terminal Classic (Prince 2000:58). This on-floor assemblage, consisting of four partial vessels-a bowl, a dish, and two jars-was not centrally aligned, was devoid of ritual paraphernalia, and thus does not appear to have been deposited during a termination rit­ual (Lamoureux-St-Hilaire 2011 :62-64). This assemblage likely represents refuse left behind at the time of abandonment (Lamoureux-St-Hi­laire 2011:95). 
Group S (Figure 4), located roughly 100 m south of Group R, consisted of a large raised courtyard that supported nine residential struc­tures and a tripartite eastern temple (Schwake 2008; Zehrt 2006). At some point during the Ter­minal Classic, a large amount of refuse was dumped inside the northern wing of the temple, Structure 76S , including thousands of ceramic sherds and many other artifacts, such as fauna! and lithic materials (Lamoureux-St-Hilaire 2011:98). Some of the ceramic material was dated to the Middle Classic, thus suggesting that the refuse was gathered from a nearby deep midden (Lamoureux-St-Hilaire 2011:98). A masonry cache was then built inside the doorway of the room, thus physically blocking access to that room (Zehrt 2006). The cache was devoid of any non-perishable material except for a greenstone adze (Zehrt 2006). The ceramic data from this assemblage may be combined with a set of ra­diocarbon dates (Table 1) associated with an in­trusive burial from the adjacent Structure 77S, which indicates a Terminal Classic date: [1200 ± 40 B.P.
