MATERIALIZING POWER THROUGH PRACTICE IN THE LATE POSTCLASSIC NACO VALLEY, NORTHWESTERN HONDURAS 
Edward M. Schortman and Patricia A. Urban 
We contend that political structures emerge in the course of interpersonal dealings conducted by people organized within overlapping social networks. It is through these webs that resources needed to define and achieve goals and exert control over others are mobilized. Elites seeking to construct hierarchies and concentrate power must restructure the preexisting matrix of networks to redirect the flow of assets to their benefit. In doing so, they seek to create an affiliation that transcends loyalties to extant social groups while securing for themselves positions of preeminence within the overarching affiliation. Such social engineering involves manipulating the material symbols by which interpersonal ties are made tangible and imbued with emotional significance. The resulting political structures are less nested sets of stable territorial groups than dynamic networks of networks through which assets are deployed in the practices by which power is exercised. This perspective is used to describe Late Postclassic (A.D. I 300-1532) political processes in the Naco Valley, northwestern Hon­duras, calling attention to how power of various sorts took shape through complex relations among diverse people and varied things orchestrated within overlapping social networks. The implications of a network approach for studying political processes generally are also considered. 
Argumentamos que las estructuras de poder emergen en el curso de relaciones interpersonales, llevadas a cabo por personas organizadas dentro de redes sociales. Es a traves de estas redes que las personas movilizan los recur sos utilizados para definir y alcanzar objetivos y ejercer control sobre sus subordinados. Las elites que buscan construir jerarqu(as y concentrar el poder 
deben reestructurar esta matriz de redes mediante [a creaci6n de una afi[iaci6n que trasciende las lealtades preexistentes y 
que al mismo tiempo se pone en el centro de esta nueva afiliaci6n. Tales innovaciones sociales son avanzadas mediante la manipulaci6n de simbolos materiales a traves de Los cuales Los lazos interpersonales se hacen tangibles. La estructura politica resultante es una dindmica red de redes a traves de la cual se ejerce el poder. Los procesos politicos durante el Postcldsico Tardio (1300-1532 d.C.) en el Valle de Naco en el noroeste de Honduras ejemplifican c6mo las relaciones entre redes sociales, s(mbolos y poder pueden examinarse desde esta perspectiva. Nos enfocamos en c6mo las elites sintetizaron sfmbolos y prdcticas de varios tipos para crear estructuras jerdrquicas. La conclusion de/ art(culo considera las implicaciones de un enfoque en Los procesos politicos centrado en las redes sociales.

ocial scientists have long argued that peo­ple's capacities to define and achieve goals and exert control over others depend on the interpersonal interactions in which they reg­ularly engage (Saitta 1994; Wolf 1990). It is through such dealings that the conceptual and tangible resources needed to exert power in all its forms are acquired and deployed. These trans­actions are frequently organized within social networks composed of people who regularly co­operate in pursuing political projects. There are several approaches to understanding relations among social nets, assets, and power. One models interpersonal transactions as occurring in formal structures composed of bounded sets of nodes (individuals, groups, or sites) and the information and goods moving among them. A node's position within a network determines the resources to which it has access and, hence, what political ini­tiatives can be funded with those assets (Brugh­mans 2010; Jenkins 2001; Munson and Macri 2009). Alternatively, social networks are cast as open-ended , constituted by their members' agency in securing and using those resources needed to exercise power (Campbell 2009; Schortman 2014).

Emphasizing how human agency shapes po­litical networks highlights the ways in which power arises in the course of daily interactions. One way of addressing these issues is to attend less to how hierarchically structured polities func­tion and more to how they are created (Schortman and Urban 2011, 2012a, 2012b; Schortman et al. 2001). A crucial step in this process, we hypoth­esize, involves forging a social network and as­sociated identity that includes all members of the emergent realm (Robin et al. 2010; Schortman et al. 2001; Sheets 2000; Yaeger 2000). Contests for power and wealth often divide complexly structured societies . Reproducing these entities across generations requires that their members participate in a social net that unites them despite these proliferating differences . Those seeking to lead that net have to find emotionally compelling ways of expressing web membership; promote large-scale projects through which feelings of commonality underlying the net are publically enacted; and ensure that these performances em­phasize the preeminence of rulers (Brumfiel 1992, 1994, 2000:133; Van Buren and Richards 2000). Failure to achieve the first two objectives results in a fragmented polity. Inability to accomplish the last aim frustrates political centralization and hierarchy formation. 
Elites face significant difficulties in rewriting social landscapes. Those seeking prominence work within a framework of preexisting social webs through which individuals maintain some independence as they acquire resources necessary for survival and self-definition (Giddens 1984:38, 258-261; Robin et al. 2010; Schortman and Ash­more 2012; Schortman and Urban 2011, 2012a). Such networks can range in scale from people oc­cupying a domicile and associated outbuildings, to households composed of several such units, to communities that incorporate multiple domestic groups (Canuto and Yaeger 2000; Hendon 2010; Sheets 1992, 2000). Cross-cutting these spatially localized units are nets that differentially link their members with people residing at varying dis­tances. Occupants of the same residence, house­hold, or community may thus belong to different religious sodalities or secure sundry goods from assorted trade partners (Robin et al. 2010; Sheets 2000, 2002; Yaeger 2000). The assets obtained through these connections variably enable agents to articulate and meet their own needs and influ­ence the actions of others. One way of building hierarchies and concentrating power involves un­dermining such autonomy by reorganizing extant webs so that their operation and reproduction rely on elite intervention. Such dependency advances efforts to redefine social equals into ranked cate­gories of people who rely on their "social betters" for assets formerly obtained without elite inter­vention (Schortman and Urban 2011). 
Material culture figures prominently in the op­eration of social webs and in elite assertions of eminence within them (Campbell 2009; Gell 1998; Hodder 2012; Knappett 2011; Latour 2005; Strathern 1988; Wright 2002:161,165). Goods are frequently among the resources used to achieve goals and to exert power over others. Displaying, exchanging, and using materials also often instantiate the interpersonal relations and connections to potent supernatural forces through which assets essential to the exercise of power are acquired and put to use (Campbell 2009; Gell 1998: 83,123; Gosden 2004:33-36; Hutson 2010:35, 38, 131-132; Latour 2005:74--75; Strathern 1988:164; Wright 2002: 157 ,160). If elites want to reconfigure such associations to their benefits, they must find convincing ways of expressing novel intercon­nections by manipulating the symbols through which these relations are materialized. Reconsti­tuting social networks thus partly depends on gaining widespread acceptance of the hallmarks by which interpersonal ties are made tangible and ensuring that these expressions of web unity are infused with meanings that serve elite purposes. Those meanings derive to a great extent from how objects and symbols are employed in specific practices. The latter are inferred from patterning in the contexts from which materials are recov­ered (Hodder 1992:110-111; Hodder and Cess­ford 2004) . 
Achieving prominence, therefore, partly de­pends on the ability of a few to reorder social networks by securing general acceptance of the symbols that materialize these affiliations and by defining the meanings of those symbols by de­termining how they are used by members of the reconfigured webs (Hamilakis 2013:117-118). Leaders often draw on their connections with dis­tant allies for the aforementioned symbols and practices to which they alone within a society

have access. Such monopolies enable a fortunate few to establish the meanings of symbols that lack local antecedents and to use them in defining unprecedented hierarchically structured social webs. In this way, foreign concepts are integrated within daily enactments of unity and distinction. Gaining general acceptance of these innovations is far from certain. 
Our conceptual framework is an instrumental approach to people and things. Empowerment is treated as a universal goal, an objective that makes sense of human actions. This "cold" view of interpersonal dealings, as one anonymous re­viewer of an earlier draft of this paper aptly calls it, ignores some aspects of past lives while high­lighting the social networks that comprised an­cient political structures; the conceptual and phys­ical resources that moved through them; how these varied assets were used in power competi­tions; what the outcomes of those contests were for all involved; and how these structures took shape and changed as actors redirected resource flows across a matrix of social networks. The re­sults of such efforts are descriptions, not expla­nations, of past political relations. They are useful insofar as they capture the complexity of those dealings among people and things out of which political structures take shape, are perpetuated, and change. That is what we are attempting to do in the following pages, where we offer several hypotheses about how architectural and ceramic styles were strategically used to restructure po­litical relations as a network of overlapping social webs within the Late Postclassic (A.D. 1300­1532) Naco Valley in northwestern Honduras. 
The Naco Valley 
The 100-km2 Naco Valley floor, at 100-200 m asl, is bounded by the Sierra de Omoa range, which rises to 3000 m asl (Figure 1). Watered by the Chamelecon River, valley soils are generally fertile (Anderson 1994; Douglass 2002). The 1,300 mm of rainfall that the basin receives each year support at least one annual crop, and two harvests are pos­sible in particularly wet years (Zuniga 1990). 
Archaeological investigations in the basin be­gan in 1936 (Strong et al. 1938), with systematic

research being conducted for 10 field seasons, from 1975-1996 (Henderson et al. 1979; Schort­man and Urban 2011; Urban l 986a, 1986b; Urban and Schortman 2012; Wonderley 1981). A near­total ground survey recorded 464 sites, of which 64 were excavated. The eight phases identified in the course of this work stretch from 1200 B .C. to the Late Postclassic Roble phase. 
The Roble phase witnessed considerable de­mographic and political change. During the Early Postclassic (A.D. 1000-1300), site numbers and sizes declined drastically from those seen during the Terminal Classic (A .D. 800-1000). The 13 po­litical centers that dominated the valley during the ninth through tenth centuries were also abandoned, replaced by two capitals the small sizes of which (19 or fewer platforms , none more than 2.5 m tall) imply their residents' limited capacities to attract clients and command their labor (Schortman and Urban 2004; Urban 1986a). Comparable processes of population decline and political decentralization characterize many portions of southeast Mesoamerica during the Early Postclassic (Dixon 1989; Fash 2001; Hirth et al. 1989; Joyce 1991; Looper 2003; Schortman et al. 1986; Sharer 1978, 1990; Webster et al. 2000). Most of those neigh­boring zones did not experience the demographic and political resurgence seen in the Roble phase. 
Three sizable Naco Valley settlements date to this span (Figure 2). The Naco site covers ap­proximately 160 ha and was reported in early Spanish chronicles as a major population center and commercial entrepot through which goods originating in lower Central America and Mesoamerica were exchanged (Figure 3; Gasco and Berdan 2003; Smith and Berdan 2003; Won­derley 1981). Wonderley mapped the entire site and dug 14 structures along with five artifact con­centrations ( 1981, 1985, 1986). Located 2 km northeast of the valley on the Rio Chamelecon 's north bank, Site PVN306's approximately 35 ha contain 120 constructions and 223 artifact scatters dating to the Roble phase (Figure 4; Schortman and Urban 2011 ). In addition to mapping the en­tire site, 647 m' were excavated in the course of investigating 34 buildings and nine artifact con­centrations (Neff 1993; Schortman and Urban 2011). The architectural cores of Naco and Site PVN306 consist of earthen platforms that define two adjoining plazas. Sizable elite residences de­
limit the eastern patios, while the western plazas were venues for public gatherings. 
Lying 2 km northeast of the Naco site and 5 .2 km southwest of Site PVN306 is Site PVN144 (Figure 5). This settlement's 4.1 ha encompass 19 surface-visible structures and, minimally, 12 artifact scatters. Site PVN144 is dominated by a patio bordered by nine sizable constructions. Dig­ging here in 1996 cleared large portions of seven buildings, exposing 553 m', and 10 artifact con­centrations were tested. 
Components of an additional nine sites were assigned to the Late Postclassic based on surface collections or diagnostic artifacts retrieved during excavations. Roble phase settlements are difficult to locate during survey because their relatively insubstantial remains are easily lost to plowing or hidden by even modest ground cover. The three major Roble phase sites have also been heavily damaged by modem construction and plowing (Schortman and Urban 2011; Wonderley 1981). Consequently, we have certainly underestimated the number and sizes of Late Postclassic Naco Valley sites. Though the basin's population may neverhave reached the highest estimates provided in early Spanish accounts (Sherman 1978:49; Strong et al. 1938:27; Wonderley 1981), the area was experiencing a demographic rebound from Early Postclassic levels when the conquistadores arrived. 
This burgeoning population was likely orga­nized in at least two overlapping domestic social networks instantiated through practices conducted within houses and households (Schortman and Urban 2011). Houses were composed of people who occupied a distinct dwelling and used its as­sociated outbuildings and features. These domi­ciles often stood alone, although in each of the investigated sites there was one household, or a cluster of residences, surrounding a patio (Ash­moreand Wilk 1988; Sheets 1992, 2002). Network membership in both units was enacted through regular cooperation in food preparation and shar­ing, employing the same suite of chipped and ground stone tools, as well as ceramic bowls and jars. Rituals, employing closely comparable ladle incense burners, provided another context for per­forming affiliations within these domestic webs. 
Though house and household members at all three settlements pursued nearly identical tasks

earth-filled, stone-faced platforms that stand .­
1.5 m high, cover 63-204 m2, and are generally decorated with stone or plaster surfaces. Two cat­egories of domestic architecture are intermediate in size and elaboration between these examples. The larger consists of isolated residences at Site PVN306 that are built atop platforms .27-.48 m tall, encompass 71-400 m2, and lack stone or plaster surfaces . The next tier includes sizable constructions raised directly on ground surface but with stone foundations . The two most exten­sively investigated examples (Structures 144-1 and 144-2) cover 60-87 m2 and contain stone-faced benches (Figure 6). 
The most impressive domiciles at each settle­ment were consistently used by the only house­holds identified at those centers. This pattern sug­gests that political preeminence depended in part on forging alliances among people who belonged to multiple house groups living around a patio . It was, we argue, through these social nets that members of the two largest households (one each at Naco and Site PVN 306) drew on the skilled and unskilled labor of people residing outside their domestic complexes to raise their relatively sizable residences.

habitants called on more restricted labor pools to erect and maintain their humbler domiciles. 
All domestic groups centered on houses and households comprised social networks enacted through their members' cooperation in oft-re­peated tasks that minimally included food prepa­ration, storage, exchange, and consumption; rit­ual; and house construction and maintenance. The consistent use of the same materials in the first two sets of activities across the three settle­ments may have fostered a sense of "mechanical solidarity" among all people, regardless of rank (Durkheim 1984). 
Such nebulous feelings of commonality would not serve the purposes of magnates seeking to create a unified set of adherents whose labor could be harnessed for elite projects. Forging such con­nections required promoting affiliations that linked

members of different domestic groups; providing opportunities to perform membership in those nets in emotionally compelling ways; and ensuring that elites played crucial roles in such enactments of unity. The first two aims were arguably ad­dressed by insinuating symbols central to novel, expansive webs on ceramic bowls used in prac­tices of food sharing that were essential to instan­tiating domestic affiliations. Achieving the third objective involved using locally unusual archi­tectural forms as settings for performances of elite preeminence within these newly constituted nets. 
Symbols of Unity 

The vessels that we believe were central to in­culcating a sense of commonality among domes­tic groups are classed as Nolasco and La Victoria Bichromes (Urban 1993; Wonderley 1981, 1986). They stand out in the Roble phase assemblage for their forms, open bowls with tripod supports, and decoration. Whereas most containers dating to this span in the basin are slipped red or undec­orated, Nolasco and La Victoria examples are white-slipped, their exteriors painted red (Figure 7). These motifs generally consist of sinuous el-

ements that have been interpreted as feathered serpents and which are associated with Xs, step­frets, dots, and guilloches (Urban 1993:58; Won­derley 1981, 1986). Given their forms, these bichromes were likely used to serve food. Their elevation of .03-.08 m atop tripod supports sug­gests that the comestibles they contained were meant to be displayed. These bichromes were widely used, comprising 1-21 percent of analyzed domestic assemblages. Their prevalence within the Naco Valley suggests that all of the basin's residents needed and had regular access to white­slipped, red-painted bowls. Coupled with the paucity of similar bichromes in immediately sur­rounding areas, this pattern suggests that Nolasco and La Victoria vessels were manufactured in the valley (Wonderley 1985). 
The general form of Nolasco and La Victoria bowls, along with many of their decorations, re­semble contemporary examples from the Maya Highlands and Peten Lakes (Rice 1983:868, 871, 875-876; 1987:101, 238; Wonderley 1981, 1985). The feathered serpent elements, in particular, were possibly inspired by the "Quetzalcoatl cult" that originated in northern Yucatan and spread throughout southern Mesoamerica beginning in the Terminal Classic (Ringle et al. 1998) . These distinct design elements appear in the Naco Valley fused with local motifs (Figure 8). The curvilinear figures that comprise and border the serpents, for example, resemble the rope-and-braid designs painted in red on the unslipped surfaces of high­necked jars dating to the valley's Terminal Classic (Ausec 2001; Schortman and Urban 2011; Urban 1993; Wonderley 1986). The Xs, step-frets, and use of dots as fillers recall designs painted on those same jars. The Nolasco and La Victoria symbol set, therefore, couched the foreign in the familiar, combining ideas derived from external and autochthonous sources (Wonderley 1986; see also Rice and Cecil 2009). 
It is hard to say what the valley's Roble phase inhabitants thought of these older ceramic deco­rations. Significant continuities in the forms and styles of chipped and ground stone tools, ceramics (aside from the bichromes), and incensarios link the Roble and Terminal Classic phases. Such ties hint at cultural connections that provided contexts for recalling select aspects of the Terminal Classic in Roble phase contexts. The erection of Sites

PVN306, PVN144, and Naco adjoining Terminal Classic political foci also points to conscious ef­forts at conjuring the past in the present. In each case, steps were taken to preserve the integrity of the earlier architecture and to avoid reoccupy­ing these buildings or depositing trash on them. This association with earlier political capitals is particularly pronounced at Site PVN 306, where the Roble phase elite household is a scant 3 m west of comparably substantial Terminal Classic constructions. The latter were also used as places for burying some members of the site's Late Post­classic population. 
Who instigated these efforts? While commis­sioning large-scale architecture was likely an elite prerogative, without firing facilities it is hard to say which faction(s) fashioned bichromes and promoted their symbolic associations. Unfortu-

nately, the heat and smoke generated by firing ceramic vessels likely relegated pottery work­shops to settlement margins, where our excava­tions were limited (Santley and Kneebone 1993). Surface investigations of the three sites yielded no signs of firing facilities in these sparsely settled zones. Our experience studying earlier ceramic production loci indicates, however, that even large pottery workshops can be hard to identify in the basin without excavation (Connell 2002; Urban et al. 1997).

uses, and they had the most to gain from promot­ing a design program that encouraged feelings of commonality among people otherwise divided by loyalties to diverse houses and households (see also Pugh and Rice 2009: 142). 
Whether or not rulers dictated the choice of motifs found on Roble phase bichromes, the widespread use of these bowls suggests that all of the basin's late prehistoric residents were par­ticipating in a meaningful structure that tied cel­ebrations of domestic unity through food sharing with an extensive net expressed by common sym­bols. It was through this association that intima­tions of solidarity within the expansive web drew emotional power from feelings of unity generated by activities conducted in houses and households (Bartlett and McAnany 2000; Dietler 1996; Di­etler and Hayden 2001; LeCount 2001; Hamilak:is 2013; Vaughn 2004; Yaeger 2000). The prominent place of foreign motifs, such as the feathered ser­pent, within this symbolic repertoire facilitated feelings of fellowship as they were untethered from preexisting local affiliations. Synthesizing these designs with those of local origin might have imbued the exotic precepts with sentiments of persistence born of enduring connections to a selectively recalled past. Juxtaposing Roble phase and Terminal Classic centers possibly reinforced this connection. 
Individual responses to these painted motifs were likely diverse. Nonetheless, the insinuation of a widespread set of designs within perfor­mances of domestic tasks could have contributed to routinizing enactments of membership in a novel, expansive network. By themselves, how­ever, strategies that promote unity do not establish the eminence of any one faction within a social web. Accomplishing this objective required ma­nipulating architectural forms that were not widely replicated within the basin. 
Building Power 

The appearances of Structures 306-17, 306-19, and 4F-l (the last at the Naco site) are unique among Roble phase constructions (Schortman and Urban 2011; Wonderley 1981). The first is on the south side of an open plaza that encompasses 1,650 m2 and borders Site PVN306's principal household on the west. During its final version, Structure 306-17 was a 1.03-m-tall, round plat­form with a diameter of 8 m, ascended by three terraces. The basal riser consists of a stone-sur­faced, plaster-coated sloping zone that cants back at a 30-degree angle. Three steps on the building's northeast side provided access to an apparently open summit atop which a carved stone monument was found lying face down (Figure 9). 
Structure 306-19 lies 12 m northeast of Struc­ture 306-17, near the western plaza's center. Three major periods of renovation here resulted in a roughly oval construction that stood .8 m high and covered 6.9 by 9.9 m (Figure 10). A rock­lined pit in the platform's summit measures .25 by .51 m by .46 m deep and may have supported a stone monument comparable to that recovered on Structure 306-17. No sculpture was found here, however. By the final occupation, four stone­faced, plaster-covered spokes standing .6-.76 m high projected from the platform in each of the cardinal directions and were abutted by a plaster­covered earthen apron that sloped up toward them. Thirty-six re-plastering episodes were noted in one portion of the structure. A stone staircase as­cends Structure 306-19's southeastern side. 
Structure 4F-l resembles Structure 306-19 (Figure 11; Wonderley 1981). Both are located in sizable open plazas lying immediately west of their settlement's principal households (the Naco site's western plaza covers 1,020 m2). Structure 4F-l also has at least five stone arms that radiate out from its core (much of the building's west side was destroyed prior to Wonderley's investi­gations). Like Structure 306-19, the building is surrounded by a plaster-covered apron that slopes up and back toward the edifice. Steps ascend Structure 4F-l 's northern and, possibly, western sides. At 2 m high and 11.3 min diameter, Struc­ture 4F-l is larger than Structure 306-19. Unlike the latter, Structure 4F-l's summit supported a .6-m-high plaster-coated bench and parts of the superstructure were painted red, yellow, tan, and blue (Wonderley 1981). 
Excavations at all three buildings yielded few artifacts. Lying near these edifices, however, are extensive trash deposits. Forty meters southwest of Structure 4F-l and 30 m west of Structure 306-19 are collections of debris (glossed as Struc­tures 4F-14 and 306-182) composed mostly of fragments from ceramic vessels and ladle incen-

sarios. Contemporary with these deposits and sit­uated on the southwestern comers of the Naco and Site PVN306 western plazas are extensive trash deposits in which faunal remains, especially Pachychilus sp. snail shells, are common (Struc­tures 306-83 and 4F-16). Although fragments of ceramic food-serving vessels are prominent in the Structure 306-83 deposit (85 percent of the 128 form-classified rims are bowls), incense burn­ers are not as common as they are in the Structure 306-182 sample (comparable form and function information is not available for Structure 4F-l 6) . 
Structures 4F-1, 306-17, and 306-19 were likely foci of public gatherings at which consid­erable quantities of food were consumed. These feasts were apparently associated with rites in which ladle incense burners were used. The bowls, stone tools, and incensarios employed in these assemblies are identical to those that figured in similar activities conducted on smaller scales

in domestic settings. Such replication implies that the western plazas hosted celebrations that drew on domestic practices to infuse inter-house and ­household affiliations with a sense of solidarity. These gatherings, we infer, were among the joint projects through which were enacted feelings of unity underlying the expansive social networks symbolized by designs rendered on red-painted bowls. After the celebrations, debris resulting from meat processing was largely segregated from that employed in burning incense. All de­tritus from these gatherings was jettisoned on the plazas' western edges. The shallowness of these deposits (.1-.5 m thick) and their lack of clear internal stratigraphy suggest that their contents were likely removed before the next major gath­ering. Repeatedly aggregating and jettisoning trash generated during public celebrations would likely keep the memories of those reunions rela­tively fresh in participants' minds. 
That the occupants of the Naco and Site PVN306 principal households played significant roles in the inferred events is suggested by the lo­cation of ritual and feasting loci immediately west of, and adjoining, their residences. In addition, it would have been these leaders who most likely commanded the skilled and unskilled labor needed to raise the celebrations' foci, Structures 4F-1, 306-17, and 306-19. The relatively modest effort invested in erecting these buildings implies that elite control over subordinates' labor was limited.

totypes. Instead, they were probably inspired by models associated with the Quetzalcoatl religion in which elites throughout Late Postclassic south­ern Mesoamerica participated (Ringle et al. 1998). Round constructions underwent a late florescence in the Maya lowlands associated with this reli­gion's spread (Demarest et al. 2004:552; Freidel and Sabloff 1984:33; Milbrath and Peraza 2003:23; Pollock 1936; Pugh 2001:251; Ringle et al.1998:186, 203, 222; Rosenswig and Masson 
2002:217; Sidrys and Andersen 1978:648). Why this distinctive building form was adopted in the late prehistoric Naco Valley has, we think, a lot to do with its place in elite domination strategies. 
The inter-elite ties instantiated through such prominent expressions of the Quetzalcoatl reli­gion likely helped build bonds of trust and mutual understanding among leaders from whom could be obtained support against local usurpers and access to imports, such as obsidian, which was

widely used for basic tools in the valley (Boone and Smith 2003; Freidel and Sabloff 1984: 192; Masson 200I:164; Pohl 2003; Renfrew 1982; Renfrew and Cherry 1986; Rice 1983:876; Smith 2003). Those capable of initiating and sustaining such interactions could also partake of any charisma associated with foreign potentates and distant realms (Helms 1979, 1988, 1992). Such ties might underwrite the development of hierar­chy at home to the extent that only those within a society who were conversant with the rites of the Quetzalcoatl faith, and who could commission venues for their performance, enjoyed exclusive access to the goods, ideas, alliances, and prestige secured through this network (Helms 1993). At least local leaders of the religion who monopo­lized access to certain imported ideas and symbols could use these elements to set themselves apart from the majority within their societies (Brumfiel 2000: 133; Preucel 2000:73). 
Insinuating architectural symbols that expressed elite distinctiveness in spaces where large numbers of people performed membership in an expansive social web also allowed rulers to be, simultane­ously, both part of and above other participants in that net. By mixing rites of network membership with symbols of an exclusive elite affiliation tied to distant realms, residents of the principal house­holds put themselves dramatically at the center of those celebrations. To the degree that the actions they performed atop and near round and cog­wheeled structures were essential to rituals of net­work membership conducted with food, painted pottery bowls, and incense burners, elites ensured that they played indispensable roles in those per­formances and the affiliations they instantiated. The presence of roughly comparable architectural manifestations of the same religion at Naco and Site PVN306 implies that both elite households were competing for adherents using the same sym­bolic assets and that neither had gained ascendancy over the other. That the core monuments at each site evinced multiple renovations suggests that this stalemate endured for a considerable period. 
There is some doubt concerning who these elites were. Ethnohistoric accounts point to the basin's importance within long-distance trade net­works (Chamberlain 1966; Roys 1972:55; Sc­holes and Roys 1948:84; Wonderley 1981). That at least some of the valley's residents could con­verse with the Spaniards' Nahua-speaking auxil­iaries confirms that the basin was home to a fairly cosmopolitan population on the eve of the Con­quest (Chamberlain 1966; Cortes 1971 [1485­1547]:607; Henderson 1979:369). Some have ar­gued, in fact, that foreign traders exercised suzerainty over the local populace and introduced the alien symbols discussed here (Henderson 1979:369; Wonderley 1981, 1985). While ac­knowledging the reasonableness of this argument, we see continuities in just about all aspects of Naco Valley material culture as indicating an au­tochthonous origin of the basin's Roble phase population, elites, and their followers. The com­bining of foreign and parochial themes on No­lasco and La Victoria bichromes supports this supposition if only because it demonstrates de­tailed knowledge of the local design grammar. 

Whatever their origins, those seeking to rule faced the challenge of restructuring social nets to their advantage. They also had to develop means for mediating relations among contesting factions. Site PVN144 might have been a venue for accomplishing this aim. 
Forging a Valley-Wide Network 
Site PVN144's principal plaza differs from those found at Naco and Site PVN306 in that it pro­vided facilities for residence (Structures 144-1 and 144-2), large-scale food preparation (Struc­tures 144-5 and 144-11), gatherings of influential community members (Structures 144-8 and 144­18), and feasting. Though substantial by the stan­dards of the settlement, the two excavated domi­ciles are modest in size and degree of elaboration when compared with residences found within the Site PVN306 and Naco principal households. Structures 144-1 and 144-2 were probably homes to people of lower social status than those who lived in the latter compounds. The relatively small size of Site PVN144 and the middling rank of its most prominent residents do not seem to warrant the relatively elaborate venues for meetings and feasts provided here. That there is no evidence of similar facilities at the much larger Naco site and Site PVN306 suggests that Site PVN144 hosted gatherings that differed in size, composi­tion, and intent from those convened in the west­ern plazas of its more impressive contemporaries. 

Downloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core. YBP Library Services, on 22 Aug 2018 at 17:20:55, subject to the Cambridge Core terms of use, available at https://www.cambridge.org/core/terms. https://doi.org/10.7183/1045-6635.25.3.344 
We suggest that these convocations were oppor­tunities to enact membership in a basin-wide af­filiation and to mediate relations among people of different ranks within that web. 
If such performances of solidarity involved the same practices of food sharing through which other known Roble phase networks were materi­alized, then a sizable space and considerable quantities of comestibles would have been needed. The Site PVN144 plaza measures 4,047 m2, exceeding by 1,377 m2 the combined areas of the western plazas at Naco and Site PVN306. Site PVN144's plaza could, therefore, have easily accommodated all the people who gathered in the western plazas of those settlements, plus its own residents. 
Individuals convening in the patio were likely fed from comestibles prepared and stored at Structures 144-11 and 144-5. Structure 144-11, on the patio's east side, is a .2-m-high earthen platform with a stone-paved summit covering 1.6 by 8.5 m and unencumbered by built-in construc­tions such as benches. That surface was probably exposed on the west and north, the remaining sides being bounded by stone foundations for perishable upper walls. A plaster-coated surface covering 1.25 by 2.1 m set against the summit's western, plaza-facing side likely marked Structure 144-11 's formal entrance. 
Immediately south of that entryway is a dense concentration of shell (remains of 2,054 individ­ual organisms) that covers .8 by 1.1 m and is .15 m thick. Remains of the freshwater snail Pachychilus sp. dominate the collection, which is delimited by low stone walls. This concentra­tion, coupled with the general absence of domes­tic architecture, points to the building's special­ized use as a locale where meat from freshwater snails was prepared for consumption. Pachychilus sp. shells are common components of Roble phase middens, suggesting that this creature was a consistent part of meals served in all houses and households and at public gatherings. What sets Structure 144-11 apart is the evidence it pro­vides for the large-scale processing of these ani­mals. Presumably, the resulting meat was eaten by a sizable number of people, more than those residing at Site PVN144. 
The earliest version of Structure 144-5 on the patio's north edge was a .59-m-tall earthen plat­form into the summit of which were dug two flat­bottomed, circular basins set in a north-south line. These declivities have fired earth walls and mea­sure 2-2.5 m across and .42-.45 m deep. The better preserved southern example has a niche set in its east wall. This feature is .22 m wide by .25 m high, and it projects .36 m eastward into platform fill (Figure 12). Beginning 1 m east of these features, Structure 144-5's summit was in­tensively burned over roughly 43 m2• Structure 144-5's basins may have been used for storing comestibles, some of which might have been cooked on the adjoining earth surface. Subsequent modifications to Structure 144-5 saw the southern basin turned into a trash receptacle, while its northern counterpart was filled with .2 m of earth. That fill supported a .12-m-high stone wall, which extended 1.35 m south from the basin's northern edge (Figure 12). These modifications were as­sociated with high heat, as the newly introduced soil was burnt to a thickness of .06 m. It may be that this basin was now used as an oven, with some of the debris from food preparation being tossed in the southern feature. Though Structure 144-5's final form is unclear, artifacts associated with it tentatively suggest that the edifice contin­ued to serve as a place where food was prepared. 
The food curated and prepared in these locales was almost certainly consumed by people gath­ered in the plaza. Evidence for this claim is seen in a dense deposit of artifacts (200 items/exca­vated m3) that covers roughly I 05 m2 on the plaza's western side (Structure 144-19). This de­bris is primarily composed of items used in food processing (chipped stone tools employed in cut­ting and scraping), serving comestibles (ceramic bowls), and ritual (43 percent of the incense burn­ers found in and around the main plaza come from here). As was the case for the Naco and Site PVN306 western plazas, Site PVN144's patio apparently hosted feasts and rites employing the same suite of bichrome bowls and incensarios used in numerous domestic and public contexts. Once again, networks operating at various spatial scales were materialized through comparable practices of food sharing and religious obser­vances employing identical materials. At least some of these items were emblazoned with sym­bols of a social net that linked members of mul­tiple domestic groups.

As at Naco and Site PVN306, trash generated by celebrations in Site PVN144's patio accumu­lated on its western edge and was largely devoid of snail shells. Most likely the meat from these animals was consumed in the plaza, while the carapaces were jettisoned at Structure 144-11. This consistency in the disposal of debris from meals shared by large gatherings reinforces the argument that practices of network intensification were performed and remembered in similar ways at all three investigated centers. 
As was the case for Sites PVN306 and Naco, elites were likely concerned that instantiations of web membership reinforced distinctions in the statuses of those involved. At Site PVN144, these performances of difference did not involve obvi­ous architectural evocations of the Quetzalcoatl religion, nor were they closely tied to the two principal households. Instead, we suggest that they were conducted under the aegis of a different set of symbols that were prominently displayed on Structures 144-8 and 144-18, ranged along the plaza's western side (Figure 13).

that encompasses 87 .5 m2• The substructure is bounded by a sloping zone composed of plaster­coated stone slabs canted back at an angle of 30 degrees. The superstructure consists of a 51-m2 room surfaced with white plaster but lacking in­ternal divisions and built-in furniture. This en­closure, which was roofed and likely bounded by perishable wattle-and-daub walls, was ac­cessed from its western, non-plaza-facing side. Here, two plaster-coated steps were flanked by a pair of poorly preserved stucco masks that had been damaged by modem digging (Figure 14). Despite this disruption, it was still possible to determine that the masks consisted of a head with a bulbous nose, two goggle-shaped eyes, bulging cheeks, and earflares. These features slope back toward the platform at an angle of 33 degrees, measure 1.6 by 2.4 m, and were refurbished an estimated 50 times (Douglass and Mooney 2001). 
Structure 144-18, immediately north of Struc­ture 144-8, stood an estimated 2.5 m high, cov­ered 82 m2, and was bounded by a sloping zone composed of plaster-covered stones. Heavily damaged before excavation, most of the edifice's

summit and core had been eradicated. Fragments of plaster, some painted red, recovered from the edifice imply that at least parts of the superstruc­ture were surfaced with this material. A stone staircase on Structure 144-18's west flank was bounded on the north by a stucco mask that covers 
1.2 by 2.6 m. This feature closely resembles the Structure 144-8 examples. It is unclear whether a comparable mask delimited the staircase's southern side. 
Structures 144-8's ample summit room, elab­orate adornments, and lack of domestic features and debris suggest that it was not a residence but a venue for hosting small gatherings. That the meetings were convened in an elevated locale as­sociated with potent architectural symbols (the stucco masks) implies that those who attended them were set apart from, and above, other valley residents. Structure 144-18 may have served a comparable purpose.

modious than would be required to host repre­sentatives of the house groups living at the set­tlement. Site PVN 144's patio may, therefore, have served as an arena for interactions in which people of different ranks drawn from throughout the basin participated. The feasts and rites conducted here probably resembled examples hosted in the western plazas of Site PVN306 and Naco , even down to patterns of trash segregation and dis­posal. The use of Nolasco and La Victoria bichrome ceramics in these gatherings implies that the expansive social network symbolized by their designs was also celebrated here . 
The absence of architectural forms invoking the Quetzalcoatl religion at Site PVN 144 suggests that overt references to power struggles waged through deployment of such symbols were banned from the settlement. This decision may have been intended to create an atmosphere con­ducive to forging consensus. Such agreements could have been integral to practices of corporate leadership, like the system of multepal rule seen throughout the Late Postclassic Maya Lowlands in which power was vested in a council of mag­nates (Freidel and Sabloff 1984: 182; Kepecs and Masson 2003; Masson 2003; Pugh 2003; see also Blanton et al. 1996; Renfrew 1974). 
Site PVN144's principal plaza and surrounding buildings were, we argue, venues for enacting a valley-wide affiliation materialized in the same sorts of rites and food sharing through which loy­alties to domestic groups and principal households were enacted. Even as such connections were commemorated, those gathering in the plaza would have been keenly aware of the social and physical distance separating them from the nota­bles who met atop platforms on the patio's west­ern flank. 
Different strategies of rule may, therefore, have coexisted in an uneasy tension. Competition for followers between at least two elite factions was countered by promotion of a basin-wide affiliation performed under the aegis of supernatural forces not associated with the Quetzalcoatl faith. The inferred tensions between contests for prominence and efforts at collaboration likely contributed to a dynamic situation, which could easily be upset should any one faction redirect assets to their ad­vantage within this mosaic of overlapping net­works. The arrival of Spanish interlopers in the early sixteenth century overwhelmed the ongoing rivalry.

Conclusions 
We suggest that political centralization and hier­archy building can be profitably thought of as occurring within a matrix of networks through which assets crucial to these projects move. Elites must find ways to encourage people with local loyalties to recognize ties that link them in an expansive social web centered on certain leaders (Robin et al. 2010; Yaeger 2000). This overarch­ing affiliation comes alive emotionally through the projects in which its members participate on a regular basis. Without such shared activities, the network has little social significance. We hy­pothesize that these objectives were accomplished in two ways during the Roble phase. 
First, symbols of a belief system unassociated with particular places in the Naco Valley, but em­blematic of novel extensive webs, were insinuated within daily enactments of domestic unity that included food sharing and ritual. Feelings of sol­idarity arising from these domestic performances, therefore, contributed to intimations of fellowship among all who used similar implements embla­zoned with comparable motifs. Second, the per­formance of rites and feasts in open plazas, using much the same items decorated with identical symbols, reinforced inclusive feelings of com­monality among house and household members. The meanings of those symbols emerged in the course of their patterned use in performances of cohesion conducted among members of houses, households, and larger communities. 

Rulers gained preeminence within these nets by monopolizing crucial roles in enacting the sol­idarity of the web they led. This, we argue, is what Roble phase elites did at the distinctive con­structions they commissioned as foci for cele­brations of network unity. Insofar as members of Naco's and Site PVN306's principal households, alone within their networks, commanded the knowledge and labor needed to raise round and cog-wheeled platforms, the activities conducted on and around them were the exclusive purviews of local magnates. By performing essential as­pects of rites crucial to instantiating network co­hesion, elites put themselves at the very center of their expansive nets . 
Such strategies need not yield clear winners. In the Naco Valley, the leaders of two political webs focused on as many households apparently competed for supporters by employing the same symbolic assets. The potentially debilitating con­sequences of this standoff were seemingly ame­liorated through events conducted at Site PVN144 in which the interests of contesting factions were at least temporarily submerged and their followers periodically united. That settlement's plaza pro­vided an ample venue in which all or most of the basin's occupants could have gathered to affirm their solidarity through the same sorts of rituals and feasts by which they enacted house mem­bership and loyalty to elite households. Simulta­neously, the most influential participants in the web , presumably members of those households, gathered on platforms overlooking the plaza un­der the patronage of supernatural forces invoked through symbols unrelated to those used in their political competitions. It was in these meetings of notables, we hypothesize, that decisions af­fecting the entire valley were made and through which contests among leading figures were me­diated. Once again, performances of network unity accentuated commonality among all par­ticipants, while maintaining elite preeminence. 
The account offered here is less an explanation of political structures than a description of the dynamic and fluid processes out of which those formations might arise and through which they can change. What it lacks in explanatory power is compensated, we hope, by the approach's abil­ity to highlight how power was contested by di­verse people using sundry things within overlap­ping social nets extending over varied distances (Hodder 2012; Knappett 2011; Robb 2013). There are no marginal people or insignificant objects in these processes. All actors together, if not in unison, created, through their mutual interactions with and through various items, the networks of networks in which they defined goals and sought to reach them. 
The network perspective we advocate also seeks to balance an emphasis on competition with attention to cooperation in studying political processes (Ortner 1995). Power is not necessarily contested by clear factions organized within mu­tually exclusive groups. Instead, people occupy­ing different structural positions variably coop­erate in pursuit of, and compete over, the materials, meanings, and rules through which

preeminence is secured and legitimized (Levine 20 1 1:23, 34-35). Oppression and cooperation co­exist in complex societies. Thus, those who rose to prominence in the Roble phase did so by com­bining strategies of exclusion and inclusion. Out of transactions conducted within this matrix of intersecting networks emerged a political struc­ture characterized by conflicting tendencies fa­voring the preeminence of specific households and their submergence within a basin-wide sys­tem of joint rule. Concepts of domination and re­sistance are blunt instruments with which to cap­ture the complexity and dynamism of such arrangements. 
The utility of these portrayals of political processes is assessed based on the extent to which they alert us to possible connections among the data in hand that were not otherwise apparent; lead us to ask questions that generate novel in­sights about power contests; and contribute to in­vestigations that either confirm or deny the mul­tifarious relations among power, people, and things proposed in the original description. This account of Roble phase developments is but a suggestion of one way we can go about studying the exercise of power close to the ground. By concentrating on interconnections among people, ideas, and objects, it is hoped we can see the var­ied ways in which political structures emerged and were sustained through dealings conducted among members of diverse social nets. 
Acknowledgments. We are very grateful to the many people and agencies that made this research possible. The National Science Foundation, National Endowment for the Humanities, Fulbright Foundation. and Kenyon College generously funded the investigations at Sites PVN 144 and PVN306. The Instituto Hondurefio de Antropologfa e Historia (IHAH) supported and encouraged our Naco Valley studies. and we are fortunate to have worked closely and fruitfully with the IHAH's directors (Lie. Victor Cruz, Arq. Jose Marfa Casco, and Dra. Olga Hoya over the period covered here), with Juan Alberto Duran, IHAH's supervisor of the northern zone, and with Ildefonso Orellano, who collaborated with us as the IHAH's in-field representative. The fieldwork on which our analyses are based was conducted by many talented scholars of whom we single out for special thanks Laura Aldrete , Marne Ausec, Peggy Caldwell, Victoria Clarke, Sam Connell, John Douglass, Helen Henderson, Sonya Kane, Michael Kneppler, Jamie and Suzanne Mooney, Mary Morrison, Ted Neff, Neil Ross, David Schafer, Colleen Siders, Sylvia Smith, and Matthew Turek. Of the many people who provided valuable advice and insights concerning the ideas expressed here, we are especially grateful to George Hasmeann, Gloria Lara Pinto, Christopher Pool, three anonymous reviewers, Geoffrey Braswell, and Anthony Wonderley, with whom we shared a house and the pleasures of the 1977-1979 N aco Valley field seasons. The people of the Naco Valley worked indefatigably and with great skill in a wide array of tasks to make this research possible. We cannot list all our valued Honduran collaborators and so must be content to single out our foreman, Sr. Luis Nolasco, and our chief of household staff, Sra. Margarita Posas, for special thanks. Local landowners generally helped with our work, the members of the Brisas de! Valle Agricultural Cooperative being especially energetic in their support of the project. Whatever errors of omission or commission that this article contains are solely our responsibility.
