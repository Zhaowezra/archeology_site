PRISMATIC BLADE PRODUCTION IN THE LOWER CACAULAPA 
VALLEY, HONDURAS: IMPLICATIONS FOR A LATE CLASSIC 
POLITICAL ECONOMY 

William J. McFarlane and Edward M. Schortman 
Investigations of ancient political economies frequently focus on craft production. How manufacturing is organized can provide critical insights on more than the economy because social interactions and political processes are also involved. Here we consider how the acquisition, fabrication, and distribution of obsidian blades .gured in the political strategies of craftworkers and elites within the Late Classic (AD 600–800) lower Cacaulapa Valley, northwestern Honduras. This evidence provides insights into the organization of craft manufacture across southeastern Mesoamerica and suggests that current models do not capture the varied production strategies that may be pursued within the same polity. 
Las investigaciones sobre las economías políticas de los antiguos Mayas se enfocan frecuentemente en la producción artesanal. El modo de organización del proceso de manufactura nos puede proporcionar una visión crítica que va más allá de la economía, debido a que involucra múltiples interacciones sociales y políticas. En este trabajo consideramos cómo la adquisición, fabricación y distribución de navajas de obsidiana formó parte de las estrategias políticas de los artesanos y las élites del Clásico tardío (600–800 dC) en el valle inferior de Cacaulapa, en el noroeste de Honduras. Esta evidencia arroja una imagen de la organización de la manufactura artesanal en el sureste de Mesoamérica y sugiere que los modelos actuales no encapsulan las múltiples estrategias de producción que pueden perseguirse dentro de una entidad política. 
A
rchaeological analyses of political economies tend to highlight how elites manipulate production, distribution, and consumption processes to enhance their power over the actions of others. Efforts to counter such top-down pretensions attribute more agency to commoners, modeling the ways in which they employed these economic processes in efforts to exercise the power to de.ne and achieve their own aims (Saitta 1994;Wolf 
1990). 

Craft production (fashioning goods for exchange with those outside an artisan’s house­hold) has .gured prominently in these discus­sions (Clark and Parry 1990; 
Costin 
1991, 
2001; 
Schortman and Urban 2004a). 
For 
example, some have contended that efforts to concentrate power may be enabled by exclusive elite control over the manufacture and exchange of gener­ally needed resources (Brum.el 1994; 
Brum.el 
and Earle 1987; 
Hirth 
1996). 
The 
monopolists 
thereby create a hierarchically structured social net in which subordinates are bound to leaders by enduring debt relations (Brum.el and Earle 1987; 
Ekholm 
1972; 
Friedman 
and 
Rowlands 
1978). 

People may frustrate these strategies by acting to secure essential items and knowledge on their own terms, by their own efforts (Brum.el and Earle 1987; 
Dietler 
2010; 
Gosden 
2004). 
Crafts 
and the skills and materials needed to pursue them are acquired and put to work through social connections that are not captured and controlled by a few magnates. 
The former perspective presupposes highly centralized economies in which attached arti­sans fashion some items that distinguish rulers from subjects as well as other objects that are redistributed in displays of elite largesse intended

Parry 
1990; 
Costin 
1991, 
2001; 
Feinman 
1995; 
Peregrine 
1991). 
The latter formulation posits the existence of independent craftworkers who exchange their output largely free of elite intervention, often through markets (Bernier 2010; 
Costin 
1991; 
Garraty 2009, 
2010; 
Hirth 
1998, 
2008, 
2010, 
2013; 
Masson 
and 
Freidel 
2002). 

These arrangements comprise two points within a matrix of socioeconomic possibilities de.ned by how people realize goals as they make, exchange, and use goods within and across social nets. As many have noted (e.g., Feinman 2013; 
Hirth 
1996, 
1998;Rice 
2009), 
the 
result­
ing socioeconomic con.gurations often combine varying means of accomplishing all three high­lighted tasks (Stark 1992; 
Stark 
and 
Garraty 
2010). 
Grasping 
how 
craft 
production 
.gured 
in these complex structures requires specifying who made particular items and at what scales and levels of intensity. Further, it is important to know which techniques were employed to transform the raw materials and how the goods were used and distributed. Questions of what economic and political bene.ts accrued to the craftworkers and under what political constraints, if any, they operated must also be answered (Costin 1991, 
2001). 
We 
will 
address 
these 
queries 
for 
the 
Late 
Classic (AD 600–800) lower Cacaulapa Valley in northwestern 
Honduras 
(Figure 
1), 
where 
survey 
and excavation at a wide range of settlements have revealed a complex political economy that de.es easy categorization. 
The Lower Cacaulapa Valley 
The Cacaulapa River, a perennial southern trib­utary of the Rio Chamelecon, cuts a narrow de.le through steeply sloping hills. The 14 km2 lower valley is characterized by small expanses of arable land situated on narrow river terraces and in diminutive upland valleys. Survey of the basin revealed 7 km2 of agriculturally productive tracts, the largest extent of suitable farmland being less than 1 km wide. The archaeological resources of the area are known through six seasons of research beginning in 1999 during which 57 sites in the basin were recorded, 10 sites were excavated, and roughly 170,000 artifacts were analyzed (McFarlane 2005; 
Urban 
2007; 
Urban et al. 1997; 
Urban 
et 
al. 
2013; 
Wells 
2003). 
The primary focus of these investigations has been the site of El Coyote. With 415 buildings, this center was more than 14 times the size of the next largest contemporary. Indeed, the 21 coeval settlements found beyond El Coyote consist of artifact scatters and small households of no more than 
28 
constructions 
(Figure 
2). 

Occupation began at El Coyote by the Middle Preclassic (1200–400 BC), the site becoming a regional capital in the Late Classic. During the latter interval, El Coyote was dominated by a monumental 
core 
(Figure 
3) 
organized 
according 
to principles identi.ed in the Maya Lowlands; that is, a transition from sacred public spaces to secluded, elite domestic ones moving north to south (Ashmore 1987, 
1991; 
Ashmore 
and 
Sabloff 2002; 
cf. 
Joyce 
et 
al. 
2009). 
The 
recti­
linear, plaster-.oored main plaza covers 5,000 m2 and is entered on the northeast by a causeway that extends 250 m to the north. Lying to the south are two ball courts, constricted plazas, and densely nucleated sizable platforms, likely elite residences, access to which was restricted. Smaller domestic platforms that housed people of lower ranks are concentrated south of the monumental core. 
This settlement hierarchy strongly indicates that power during the Late Classic was con­centrated at El Coyote, speci.cally within its epicenter. How economic processes .gured in these political developments is complicated. 
Crafting at El Coyote 
Production at El Coyote appears in two forms: pottery production and work-party feasts. 
Pottery Production 
Though no .ring facilities have been identi.ed at the center, several lines of evidence indicate that pottery vessels were fabricated in southern El Coyote. First, Late Classic ceramics found throughout the lower Cacaulapa Valley are made from pastes that are macroscopically distinct from those characterizing vessels made in the coeval Naco and middle Chamelecon Valleys immediately to the northeast. Second, excava­tions on El Coyote’s southeast edge recovered

a dense deposit of sherds, ash, and ceramic fragments modi.ed for use in shaping pots (3,526 pieces/m3). Finally, a historical period oven for .ring ceramic roof tiles was found nearby, sug­gesting that pottery production using local clays was feasible at the center. 
Though not de.nitive, these observations suggest that pottery vessels were made at El Coyote during the Late Classic. Most likely, the containers were manufactured on a relatively small scale by artisans residing in southeastern El Coyote, their outputs exchanged with consumers in the center and its hinterland. There is no evidence that these processes of production and distribution were under elite control, nor do they seem to have resulted in elevated status or power for the artisans. 
Work-Party Feasts 
Political centralization at El Coyote was appar­ently initiated, in part, through activities con­ducted in the site core. The very form of the epicenter reinforced status distinctions in that passage, through its various components, became

increasingly restricted as people moved south from the main plaza into secluded areas of elite residence and ritual (the latter conducted in the ball courts located here; Moore 1996; 
Stockett 
2005). 
The 
extensive 
plaza 
likely 
hosted 
public 
rites performed by the rulers of El Coyote. 
Wells’s 
investigations 
in 
the 
main 
plaza 
(2003, 
2004, 
2007, 
2010) 
strongly 
indicate 
that 
these 
observances were associated with feasts where food and chicha were prepared and consumed by participants. Those producers were not craft-workers, as they were engaged in common domestic tasks, albeit at large scales, the sur­pluses being used and consumed by fellow partic­ipants in public gatherings. Nonetheless, work-party feasts required the coordinated, if episodic, labor of numerous people presumably directed by rulers. The latter probably bene.ted from these celebrations as they placed themselves at the center of rites and feasts that instantiated a social af.liation uniting the entire populace (Schortman and Urban 2011; 
Wells 
2006). 

Summary 
Evidence from El Coyote suggests that the Late Classic political economy of the lower Cacaulapa Valley consisted primarily of a domestic mode of production. The economy functioned to meet the basic physical needs of households and periodically to produce large quantities of food and drink to support public gatherings directed by elites in the central plaza. These feasts were coupled with religious rites through which a valley-wide identity, and the prominence of the rulers who led it, were reproduced and celebrated. 
Pottery vessels and obsidian blades were essential to the tasks by which households and hierarchies were sustained. The former were seemingly fabricated for local consumption at the center by artisans who may have operated independently of elite control. Obsidian blades were equally ubiquitous parts of assemblages associated with buildings of all sizes and loca­tions within the lower Cacaulapa Valley. Unlike pottery, however, through 2004 there was no evidence that blades were fashioned in the basin. It seemed that these implements were imported, some measure of elite power possibly deriving from control over their acquisition and local distribution. This interpretation was de.ni­tively disproven during investigations at Site PVC162. 
Site PVC162 
Site 
PVC162 
(Figure

consists 
of 
four 
modest 
structures arranged around a patio with three low terraces trailing off downhill to the northeast. It was .rst recorded during the initial valley survey and excavated in 2004 (McFarlane et al. 2005; 
Urban 2007). 
Located 
1.5 
km 
southwest 
of 
El 
Coyote, Site PVC162 was singled out for inves­tigation because of its locally unusual placement atop a hill some 75 m above and overlooking the terrace occupied by that center. The ground here slopes down southwest to northeast, dropping

precipitously into steep-sided ravines immedi­ately northwest and southeast of the settlement. 
Aside from a commanding view, the location of Site PVC162’s location holds few obvious advantages. There is no easy passage to the only perennial water source, the Rio Cacaulapa, 1.25 km to the east. Today, soils in the immediate vicinity of the site are thin, and there is no evi­dence to suggest that farming conditions would have been more favorable during the Late Clas­sic. 
As 
Urban 
(2007:48) 
noted, 
“Site 
PVC162 
seemed admirably located to make meeting the needs of daily life as dif.cult for its inhabitants as possible.” 
The two largest structures were investigated through excavations exposing 73.5 m2 of archi­tecture and surrounding ground surface, which unearthed a combined volume of 22.9 m3 (11.6 m3 from Structure 1 and 11.3 m3 from Structure 2). Analyses of recovered artifacts indicate that occupation of Site PVC162 was largely limited to the Late Classic, the settlement being aban­doned early in the Terminal Classic (AD 800– 1000). Throughout this period, the investigated structures underwent multiple episodes of sig­ni.cant 
architectural 
alteration 
(Figure 
5). 
The 
widespread use of shaped limestone masonry in both buildings is notable as this practice is rarely recorded outside the main plaza of El Coyote. 
Structure 1 was remodeled at least four times. An early circular or semi circular limestone surface was succeeded by a 0.35–0.58 m tall, stone-faced and -.lled platform that covered 
7.1 m2 and was aligned 128° (i.e., roughly NW-SE; Figure 
6). 
This 
construction 
supported 
two rooms and faced to the southwest. Subse­quent modi.cations made to Structure 1 likely correspond to the construction of Structure 2. The addition of a 0.1 m high cobble terrace doubled the basal dimensions of this building and reoriented Structure 1 to the plaza on the northeast. Finally, rooms were erected on the ancient ground surface along all sides of the building save the northeast. 
The earliest version of Structure 2 was a 0.50– 
0.86 m high basal platform that encompassed

23.4 m2 and was aligned 130°. Three of the four rooms are set in a line overlooking the patio and are backed on the northeast by the narrow 
(0.5 m wide) 
fourth 
compartment 
(Figure 
7). 
A step that projects into the patio provided entry to the central room of Structure 2. This enclosure was surfaced with earth as was the back, northeast compartment to which it leads. The northwest and southeast rooms were .oored with a white crushed limestone plaster. Burned patches on the plaster surfaces in both cubicles suggest the intermittent use of a hearth or incense burners. Plaster-.oored rooms are unknown in the lower Cacaulapa Valley beyond El Coyote’s monumental core. 
Subsequently, the basal platform of Structure 2 was expanded to cover 49.1 m2 by the con­struction of a 0.26–0.45 m tall cobble terrace that was raised on all sides of the edi.ce. The .nal construction efforts sealed the summit rooms. The northwest and southeast compartments were .lled with a very soft clay brought in from off-site, then the whole summit was raised using a mix of rocks and earth. This .ll episode thus erased earlier divisions and possibly created one large room atop the platform. 
Building Functions 
The architecture and associated material assem­blage indicate that Site PVC162 housed a year-round occupation. Structure sizes and forms are comparable to those identi.ed as residences and outbuildings in Late Classic lower Cacaulapa Valley households. Artifacts were collected from various contexts, including terminal debris, .ll, and a large midden lying between the northwest­ern faces of both buildings and the steep drop to the river. Artifact densities (177/m3 overall) generally match those seen at other Late and Terminal Classic domiciles recorded in this and adjacent valleys. 
There are slight discrepancies between the assemblages of Structures 1 and 2. The larger

Structure 2 has the more typical domestic col­lection. For example, it has marginally more incense burners (three) than does Structure 1 (one) and possesses paraphernalia related to daily activities, such as grinding stones and .gurines, which are absent from Structure 1. The midden associated with Structure 2 also yielded far more freshwater snails (Pachychilus sp.) than did any context on and around Structure 1, possibly hinting that food processing was more common here than at its southwestern neighbor. 
The ceramic assemblage from Structure 2 is also richer in elaborately decorated or imported ceramics (EDICs) than is the case for materials associated with Structure 1. Of the 891 analyzed sherds from terminal debris contexts at Structure 2, 9% are from these presumably high-value items. Their frequency increases if we take into account the building’s midden where 19% of the 489 analyzed sherds were EDICs. Only 1% of ceramics from terminal debris contexts of Structure 1 and 3% from its midden are EDICs (N = 326 and 117). 
There are also marked differences in the relative amounts of jars and bowls between the investigated constructions. Of the 79 ana­lyzed rims from the terminal debris deposits of Structure 2, 70% are from bowls, whereas at Structure 1, jars predominate (52% of 29 studied rims). The midden collections follow the same pattern; 74% of 53 analyzed rims from trash at Structure 2 are bowls, whereas jars make up 53% of the analyzed rims (N = 13) from the Structure 1 midden. The proportion of bowls and jars at Structure 1 conforms to patterns seen in Late and Terminal Classic domestic buildings in the lower Cacaulapa and neighboring valleys where evidence for food storing and serving are more or less equally represented (Schortman and Urban 2004b). 
The 
relatively 
small 
sample 
sizes 
urge caution in their interpretation. Nonetheless, differences in vessel forms could point to a concentration of food serving and preparation in and around Structure 2, while the storage of comestibles was centered in Structure 1. 
Summary 
Analyses of architecture and artifacts from Site PVC162 suggest that the settlement was occu­pied year-round and underwent signi.cant reno­vations during the Late and very early Terminal Classic. Although the investigated buildings are contemporaries, there is variation in the activi­ties conducted in each. Structure 1 served as a residence in which curating food and drink were signi.cant activities. Structure 2 may have been a relatively exalted venue where select domestic tasks were pursued, such as food preparation and serving. The small sizes of the rooms of Structure 2 (2.0–4.8 m2) and lack of built-in furniture implies that some residential activities, including sleeping, were relegated to other locales includ­ing Structure 1, where benches are attested. The social signi.cance of sharing comestibles at Structure 2 was possibly enhanced by the relatively imposing appearance of the structure and the elaborate paraphernalia employed in these tasks. Structure 2, therefore, may have been a focal point for dramatic episodes of food sharing that united the residents of Site PVC162 but that might not have privileged the occupants of any one domicile. Feasting may thus have helped constitute social identities at El Coyote and Site PVC162, albeit at distinct scales and with divergent political consequences. 
The occupants of Site PVC162 were people of relatively high status who exercised considerable control over skilled and unskilled labor. The selective application of plaster and extensive use of cut blocks, materials not commonly seen outside the Late Classic core of El Coyote, are striking indicators of social preeminence (Wells 2006). 
The 
high 
frequencies 
of 
EDICs 
found 
here, unmatched elsewhere in the Late Classic lower Cacaulapa Valley even at El Coyote, is suggestive of signi.cant prosperity. We argue that the prominence of these hilltop dwellers throughout the Late Classic is associated with their roles as producers of obsidian blades. 
Blade Production and Site PVC162 
The recovery at Site PVC162 of 82 exhausted prismatic blade cores along with numerous pris­matic blades and debris related to their produc­tion raised questions about how the settlement’s residents .t within the Late Classic political economy of the lower Cacaulapa Valley and how their roles in that structure changed over time. To address these queries, we consider

Second, how was the workshop integrated within local and regional production and exchange relations? Finally, how did these practices of manufacture, consumption, and dis­tribution shift over time in relation to political processes operating at multiple spatial scales? 
Methods 
Fully 876 chipped obsidian artifacts (55 chert artifacts are excluded from this analysis) were recovered 
from 
Site 
PVC162 
(Table 
1). 
All 
of 
the material was classi.ed using a behavioral or technological typology (Clark 1997; 
Clark 
and 
Bryant 1997; 
Sheets 
1975). 
This 
scheme 
classi­
.es artifacts by their method of manufacture and is well suited for revealing the structure of lithic industries. More importantly, each artifact can be assigned to a speci.c segment of a reductive sequence, thereby facilitating inferences con­cerning where and at what scales and intensi­ties stone tool manufacture was pursued. The popularity of this approach across Mesoamerica is due partly to its facility in designating each chipped stone specimen by its use-life trajectory, behavioral stage, and place in a chaîne opéra­toire (Braswell 2004; 
Hirth 
2003:5; 
Moholy-Nagy 2011; 
Schiffer 
1972; 
Sheets 
2003). 
This 
approach also reveals much about how these technological systems articulated with the polit­ical economy. 
In addition to classifying each artifact, key attributes were recorded to place the specimens within the reductive sequence of the industry. Noted attributes include the presence or absence of cortex, platform treatment, segment of the artifact, presence or absence of retouch, macro­scopic assessment of use-wear or edge damage, and weight. With the exception of indeterminate shatter, maximal length, width, and thickness were also recorded. 
Geological sources were determined visually (Braswell et al. 2000). 
Because 
the 
exhausted 
blade cores were too thick for con.dent applica­tion of this method, 50 nuclei were submitted to the Archaeometry Laboratory at the University of Missouri Research Reactor. The cores were sub­jected to energy dispersive X-ray .uorescence and neutron activation analysis. Nodules of per-lite, volcanic ejecta with a thoroughly hydrated cortex, were also noted. Having virtually the same properties as obsidian, these nodules could have been collected along the Cacaulapa River

Organization of Blade Production at Site PVC162 
The evidence from Site PVC162 reveals much about the organization of blade production at this workshop. Raw material was acquired through long-distance exchanges as well as from local outcrops. Although blades were produced at the workshop, very few of these goods were consumed or discarded here. Techniques for knapping blades varied over time and also by obsidian source. These patterns of variation sug­gest that, prior to the abandonment of the house­hold, regional obsidian exchange networks had destabilized, necessitating the implementation of an alternative production technique. 
Prismatic blade segments and blade produc­tion debris were scattered throughout the exca­vations. Blade production was a consistent activ­ity throughout the occupation of Site PVC162, and the assemblage does not represent a single episode of craft production activity. Concentra­tions of debris were noted within the southeastern rooms of both excavated structures and along the northwestern 
base 
of 
each 
platform 
(Table 
2). 
This pattern suggests that production activities may have been conducted indoors, while waste material was commonly disposed in middens along the edges of the buildings, presumably to wash down the steep decline. It is important to note that these midden deposits also include non-production waste such as pottery and other paraphernalia discarded through the course of daily activities. Apparently, materials associated with blade production were not conceptualized as distinct from household detritus. 
The results of sourcing analysis demonstrate that obsidian from the Ixtepeque .ows was the most frequently imported material at Site PVC162. Based on its extensive complex of quarries and workshops extending over 30 km2, Ixtepeque was potentially the most inten­sively exploited source of obsidian in southeast Mesoamerica (Graham and Heizer 1968; 
Sheets 
1983:91; 
Sidrys 
et al. 1976; 
Williams 
et 
al. 
1964:38). 

Eight of the cores submitted for elemental analysis were attributed to sources in close prox­imity to the lower Cacaulapa Valley. Two distinct sources were identi.ed, Source Y and San Luis. To date, Source Y has only been identi.ed chem­ically, and no physical outcropping or quarry has been located. Given its chemical composition and visual characteristics, Source Y is probably quite close to the San Luis source, which is 20 km south of Site PVC162 (Aoyama et al. 1999). 

More recently, Steven Shackley (Joyce et al. 2004) 
documented 
yet 
another 
outcropping 
on 
the eastern edge of the San Luis source area consisting of a large series of tuff domes. This outcropping, which Shackley designated as La Union after a nearby village, is situated above a tributary to the Quebrada Agua Helada from which Aoyama’s group collected their San Luis sample. As the La Union and San Luis materials are chemically indistinguishable and physically adjacent, 
we, 
along 
with 
Hendon 
(2004:7), 
con­
sider both to be part of the same extensive source and will refer to all of these outcroppings as San Luis. Currently, the presence of large nodules has yet to be noted in any of the descriptions of the San Luis source area. 
The vast majority of the obsidian artifacts in the assemblage were identi.ed as by-products of prismatic blade manufacture or the products

themselves. The remainder is made up of the output from expedient .ake-core technologies. In the entire assemblage, only eight artifacts were reshaped or modi.ed by retouch. All of these were prismatic blades altered to form a haft or into pointed drill bits. No bifacially worked tools or bifacial thinning .akes were identi.ed. 
Prismatic blade segments were the most com­mon type of chipped stone artifact recovered from this site 
(Table

Among 
other 
mea­sures, calculation of cutting edge-to-mass ratios (CE/M) suggests that the ef.cient use of obsidian was a limited concern for the artisans of Site PVC162. 
Sheets 
and 
Muto 
(1972) 
.rst 
proposed 
this measure as a re.ection of the ef.ciency with which 
blades 
were 
used, 
and 
Sidrys 
(1979) 
later 
applied this concept to indirectly assess ease of access to obsidian. 
CE/M calculations for prismatic blades of Site PVC162 were computed by doubling the lengths of all blades in the assemblage and dividing this .gure by the total mass of blades. The higher the ratio, the harder it was to acquire blades and the more effort was devoted to conserving them. For 
our 
calculation 
(Table 
4), 
we 
excluded 
speci­
mens whose extremely small sizes resulted from postdepositional fracture or crushing. Included in this .gure are 105 early termination prismatic blades. Although typically classi.ed as blade production debris, they maintain the same mor­phology as blade segments. Therefore, we view early termination blades as potentially equivalent to blade segments in terms of their utility. 
The CE/M ratios for Site PVC162 blades fall within the range of 5 to 7 for sites beyond 300 km from 
the 
source 
posited 
by 
Sidrys 
(1979:595).

Ixtepeque is somewhat closer (257 km). Blade producers at Site PVC162 were less conservative with material from Ixtepeque. CE/M ratios for blades reduced from local sources (20 km) are much higher than anticipated. This discrepancy may result from the small sample size, although, as noted below, it probably has more to do with changing conditions of obsidian working and use. 
Two other lines of evidence support the impression that ef.cient use of obsidian was not a pressing concern for inhabitants of Site PVC162. First, only .ve expedient percussion .akes show signs of moderate or heavy use-wear. Locally available chert was also relatively rare at the settlement. Limited use of obsidian and chert .akes tentatively implies that the available pris­matic blades adequately met the needs of those engaged in tasks requiring stone tools. Second, of the blade segments recovered from this site, 60 had moderate or heavy use-wear. The low propor­tions of tools showing signi.cant damage sug­gest that inhabitants were able to discard blade segments before use signi.cantly altered their cutting edges. 
Relative to other households in the lower Cacaulapa Valley, the volume of obsidian recov­ered from these structures is quite high. The quantity of blades recovered from Site PVC162, however, is low considering the number of exhausted cores at this site. The number of complete blades that can be reduced from a single core varies, but most estimates suggest a range of 100 to 180 blades produced per core (Clark 1986:36, 
1997:154).

potential yield from the 82 cores suggests that, although manufactured at Site PVC162, very few blades were consumed or discarded there. This demonstrates that blades were not being produced in conjunction with another craft at this locale (Clark 1986:26). 
Moreover, 
it 
reinforces 
the notion that the goods manufactured by these artisans were distributed elsewhere. 
The most outstanding feature of the assem­blage is the quantity of exhausted prismatic blade cores retrieved from excavated contexts (Sup­plemental Table 1). Although some are partial fragments, many are complete or nearly so and retain well-preserved platforms, blade removal scars, and, in some cases, evidence for attempts at error removal. Of this assemblage, 21 prismatic cores were reused as expedient cores. 
A growing body of literature (Clark 1982; 
Hirth 2003; 
Hirth 
and 
Andrews 
2002; 
Hruby 
et 
al. 
2011) 
has 
demonstrated 
that 
techniques 
used 
in 
manufacturing prismatic blades were not uni­form across Mesoamerica. Nevertheless, there are a few common procedures that addressed recurring problems in reducing prismatic cores (Clark 1997; 
Clark 
and 
Bryant 
1997; 
Crabtree 
1968). 
These 
steps 
include 
platform 
rejuvena­
tion, correction of blade removal errors, removal of inclusions, and platform preparation, all of which were identi.ed in the Site PVC162 assem­blage. 
Platform treatment was a characteristic noted on most cores, complete artifacts, and proximal fragments. It took the form of grinding the entire surface or striating the edge of the platform; very rarely platforms were untreated (see Table 
5; 
treatments of cores that did not retain a platform were recorded as Indeterminate). 
Although striation or scratching was the most common preparation technique in the assem­blage, ground platforms on cores are well repre­sented 
(Figure 
8). 
A 
similar 
pattern 
is 
recorded 
on complete and proximal blade fragments. Of those sourced to Ixtepeque, nearly two-thirds (64%) retain evidence of striation. For those arti­facts obtained from local sources, the platform treatment is equally divided between ground and striated techniques. 
Sheets 
(1983:95) 
noted 
for 
El 
Salvadoran 
assemblages that striation is the most common preparation technique during the Late Classic, with ground platforms increasing in frequency from the Terminal Classic into the Postclassic (AD 1100–1530). A similar chronological pat­tern is noted in central Mexico and western Mesoamerica (Healan 2009:104). 
Platform 
treat­
ments, therefore, suggest that the occupation of Site PVC162 spans the Late Classic into the early part of the Terminal Classic. Given that excavated deposits in and around the site are relatively shal­low, discerning the chronological relationships of contexts has been dif.cult. The absence of diag­nostics that de.ne the full Terminal Classic in the lower Cacaulapa Valley, especially Pachuca obsidian and Plumbate pottery, indicates that the occupation of Site PVC162 did not extend very far into this period (Urban 2016). 

Aside from the chronological implications, it is clear that the initial treatment of raw materials and macro-cores varied by source. Cortex is noted with high frequency on cores, blades, and debris reduced from locally sourced obsidian. Among the 50 sourced cores, the only ones retaining cortex are from nearby .ows. For all of the remaining unsourced cores, there are two fragments that retain cortex, and both have the same visual characteristics as the local San Luis or Source Y obsidian. 
Analysis of the non-core chipped stone assemblage reinforces this pattern 
(Table 
6).

Ixtepeque material were classi.ed as expedient percussion .akes, an initial series prismatic blade, or indeterminate shatter. In contrast, arti­facts retaining cortex that were reduced from local sources include blade production debris as well as .rst and second series blades. A signi.cant portion of the locally sourced obsid­ian includes blade production debris related to macro-core preparation. 
Therefore, we can argue with some con.­dence that prismatic blade cores reduced from local sources were brought as nodules to the Site PVC162 workshop and then reduced to macro-cores. It is striking that none of the cores or blade production debris sourced to Ixtepeque bear evidence of cortex. Put simply, materials orig­inating from Ixtepeque and local sources were treated differently. This variation underscores the importance of recognizing heterogeneity in blade production technologies. 
Regional Segmentation of Blade Production 
Blade-core technologies were often regionally organized, with specialists coordinating their expertise to conduct speci.c stages of reduc­tion (Braswell 2011:12; 
Hirth 
and 
Flenniken 
2002:125). 
Our 
evidence 
supports 
a 
model 
in 
which blade production was regionally seg­mented for some but not all sources. Nearly all of the obsidian from Ixtepeque was imported to the Site PVC162 workshop as preformed macro-cores. Presumably, specialists working in close proximity to the quarry at Ixtepeque undertook the initial stage of the blade production sequence. For obsidian obtained from local sources, prepa­ration of macro-cores was undertaken at the workshop. 
Thinking about how each step in this pro­duction sequence may vary spatially helps to explain why cores were, initially at least, being utilized from sources that are not geographically nearest to the workshop. Others describe the preferential importation of obsidian from Ixte­peque in terms of maintaining ties to the Copan polity or via other exchange networks (Aoyama et al. 1999; 
Hendon 
2004). 
Although 
this 
may 
be the case, it fails to account for variation in the regional organization of prismatic blade technology. By extracting the raw materials and forming macro-cores, specialists at Ixtepeque would have enhanced the desirability of their products to blade producers during the Late Classic. The absence of specialists knapping macro-cores at local sources may well have made obsidian from these .ows less preferable as it would have shifted the burden of initial core shaping 
to 
blade 
producers. 
Clark 
(1997:156) 
makes a similar argument about the preference for obsidian from the El Chayal source at Ojo de Agua despite its proximity to the San Martin Jilotepeque .ows. 
Few systematic investigations address how raw materials were quarried and macro-cores produced (Braswell 2004:182), 
and 
the 
precise 
nature of how commodities were exchanged

across Late Classic southern and southeastern Mesoamerica is not clear. Most likely, Ixtepeque obsidian moved by various means, including direct exchanges between producers and con­sumers, the intervention of such middlemen as itinerant traders, and elite-funded trading expedi­tions (Feinman and Garraty 2010; 
Garraty 
2010; 
Hirth 2008). 

Whatever the mechanisms of exchange, there is good reason to believe that access to Ixtepeque macro-cores in the case of Site PVC162 relied at least indirectly on enduring inter-elite alliances that would have created the relatively peaceful conditions on which long-distance exchanges of all sorts depended. The relatively high volume of Ixtepeque obsidian at Site PVC162 and through­out the lower Cacaulapa Valley correlates with the Late Classic apogee of the El Coyote polity. Taken together with the CE/M ratios of Ixtepeque blades, it appears that the seventh through ninth centuries marked a period of relatively easy and reliable access by knappers at Site PVC162 to Ixtepeque macro-cores. 
The ready availability of macro-cores from high-quality obsidian .ows meant that the arti­sans at Site PVC162 did not rely on alterna­tive sources of tool stone. Chert, for example, was not commonly used at Site PVC162 nor well represented in Late Classic assemblages throughout the lower Cacaulapa Valley. This regional economic structure was vulnerable to any perturbations that upset the .ow of macro-cores from quarries to knappers. Given the ubiquity of obsidian blades throughout the Late Classic lower Cacaulapa Valley, such disruptions would pose serious challenges to reproducing households and af.liations instantiated through work-party feasts. 
Shifting Patterns of Exchange and Production 
The abandonment of Site PVC162 apparently occurred during the Late to Terminal Classic transition in the ninth century. Among the lines of evidence suggesting this date are the ways in which the platforms of polyhedral cores were modi.ed. 
The high frequency of ground platforms on cores originating from sources near Site PVC162 may indicate that these outcrops were being exploited late in the history of the settlement possibly because its residents were struggling to acquire suitable material from distant Ixtepeque. The Late to Terminal Classic transition is marked throughout southern Mesoamerica by political fragmentation, population declines, and ruptures in long-distance trade (Demarest et al. 2005). 
The ninth-century abandonment of El Coyote’s Late Classic monumental epicenter suggests that the polity was not immune to these processes (McFarlane 2005). 

Obsidian from Ixtepeque may have no longer been reliably available due to these disruptions. In order to meet continuing demands for blades, knappers had to draw on sources and use skills they had not been called on to employ previously. Now, in addition to producing the blades, they .rst had to produce macro-cores. This interpre­tation accounts for the prevalence of both ground platforms and cortex on San Luis and Source Y cores, blades, and blade production debris from Site PVC162 (see Tables 
5 
and 6). 
It 
also 
explains 
why a signi.cant portion of the locally sourced obsidian includes debris from macro-core preparation. 
Variations in the frequencies of cortex and different platform treatments across materials from distinct sources highlight the importance of recognizing heterogeneity in blade production technologies even within one workshop. Such patterning may point to the shifting ways people engaged over time with suppliers of different raw materials. 
In sum, residents of Site PVC162 demon­strated considerable skill as they innovatively employed new manufacturing procedures on materials they had previously deemed inferior to Ixtepeque obsidian. Given the apparent decline in elite power at El Coyote and elsewhere in southeast Mesoamerica during the ninth century, it seems reasonable to infer that artisans were now largely securing, working, and distributing obsidian tools within the lower Cacaulapa Val­ley on their own. Unable to acquire Ixtepeque obsidian, they participated in a more territo­rially restricted economic structure. Tasks that had been spatially segregated, such as macro-core preparation, were now conducted in the same workshop where blades were knapped. The anomalously high CE/M ratio for local blades hints at the tenuousness of the new framework

as even assets from nearby .ows were being carefully conserved. 
Sequestered Craft Production and Shifting Political Economies 
We return to what .rst attracted us to Site PVC162: its isolated location. Sequestered blade workshops are rarely reported in Mesoamerica (cf. Burton 1987; 
Sheets 
1972). 
Why 
would 
the 
occupants opt for such an unusual setting despite shifts in production technologies, sources of raw materials, and the decline of elite power at El Coyote? This locational strategy is especially puzzling as it set these artisans apart from poten­tial consumers and high-ranking patrons. 
The choice may have been part of a strategy to monopolize prismatic blade production. As the sole known suppliers of obsidian blades within the Late Classic lower Cacaulapa Valley, the inhabitants of Site PVC162 were in an excel­lent position to make themselves indispensable to elites and commoners. Their isolation from consumers, competitors, and notables would help guarantee such a monopoly over the knowledge needed to knap blades and, eventually, shape macro-cores. This putative exclusive control over the local distribution of a valued good may well have translated into the artisans’ relative promi­nence as measured by the substantial architecture they could raise and valuables they could obtain. 
Hiding from prying eyes came at a cost. Given the poor soils and dif.culty accessing water that their location entailed, the inhabitants of Site PVC162 would have been dependent on others for basic resources. Whether or not they chose to live and work in such austere surroundings, this locale ensured the integrity of their monopoly while simultaneously undercutting their eco­nomic autonomy. As such, the power over others exercised by the residents of Site PVC162 was limited by their reliance on those same people for essential goods. 
This relationship might have created a cycle in which survival and preeminence was dependent on their continued success in fashioning blades. When the changes that transpired during the Terminal Classic threatened their capacity to acquire raw materials, people improvised. They began using skills they had never employed before on materials they had previously rejected. 
Although it did not prevent the abandonment of this household, these artisans’ efforts emphasize the importance of blade-making to their contin­ued survival as a distinct faction within lower Cacaulapa Valley society. 
How, if at all, did the workshop relate to the political aspirations of the local rulers? These potentates, together with their ilk through­out southern and southeastern Mesoamerica, likely created the conditions for successful long-distance interactions in which the knappers thrived. That said, there is little evidence that these elites directly controlled the acquisition, production, and use of obsidian. If distances of workshops from elite residences and administra­tive facilities correlate with degrees of central­ized control over these processes, the location of Site PVC162 was apparently an ostentatious expression of political independence. Work-party feasts were far more directly implicated in elite domination strategies, while the place of pottery production in these efforts remains unclear. 
If artisans were relatively independent of elite control in the Late Classic, this was even more the case during the ninth century when the potentates of El Coyote seem to have experienced a sharp decline in their power. By this point, the artisans likely operated as autonomous agents, creatively, if ultimately unsuccessfully, maneu­vering to maintain their specialized niche in a volatile lower Cacaulapa political economy. By the time a new political center emerged at El Coyote in the tenth century, there were no signs of obsidian blade manufacture at the center or in its environs (McFarlane 2005). 
However 
they 
came 
to live atop that hill, the residents of Site PVC162 for several centuries appear to have played an important economic role in supplying the lower Cacaulapa Valley with essential blades. Their place in the local power structure was, however, far more ambiguous. 
Conclusions 
There are several points following from this discussion that we think bear reiteration. First, this relatively small society exhibits considerable variability in how its component economic and political processes were related. The domestic

economy pursued by numerous valley house­holds contributed to their economic autonomy. Household independence was apparently coun­terbalanced by reliance on craft workshops for pottery and obsidian blades. 
Manufacturing ceramic vessels might have been centered at the capital and could have been supervised by the rulers of El Coyote. There is, however, no clear evidence that this was the case. Obsidian blades, on the other hand, were fash­ioned well away from the center by craftworkers who probably monopolized the local manufac­ture and distribution of these tools. Exclusive local control over the industry provided these artisans with some power over those who used their products. While that dominion may have contributed to their material well-being, it was balanced by the artisans’ dependence on their clients for basic subsistence. 
Households, therefore, met most of their essential needs with the help of obsidian tools obtained from producers who were seemingly hard-pressed to feed themselves without the aid of those who relied on them for blades. At the same time, hierarchical relations were likely sustained by means of occasional over­production of comestibles to support the work-party feasts through which expansive social iden­tities were materialized. Enacting these gath­erings, in turn, required access to obsidian blades. 
Second, this complex political economy does not conform easily to models based on dichotomies between attached and independent specialists. These taxa de.ne points within a matrix of possible relations among the produc­tion, exchange, and use of goods and the exercise of power. The Site PVC162 case reminds us that we should not get too comfortable with familiar models whose application may obscure more of past political economies than they illumine. Instead, we might pro.tably attend to questions of who was producing what goods, at what scales, and with what political and economic consequences. 
Third, political economies are rarely static. Paying attention to variability within even this small lithic assemblage emphasizes the sub­tle but signi.cant ways in which relations of power, production, exchange, and consumption can shift. Moreover, recognizing how processes of obsidian blade manufacture varied spatially reveals the ways in which technological systems can be regionally organized. 
Fourth, the lower Cacaulapa Valley is hardly typical of Late Classic political economies in this region. For example, political centralization and hierarchy were apparently underwritten in the Naco Valley, 9 km to the northeast, by centralized control over several crafts, including blade manufacture (Schortman and Urban 1994; 
Schortman et al. 2001). 
The 
dispersal 
of 
power 
together with craft-working from that center dur­ing the Terminal Classic suggests that producing essential goods was both a means of exercising power over others and for resisting such preten­sions (Ross 1997; 
Schortman 
and 
Urban 
2004b, 
2012). 

In contrast, there is scant evidence of craft manufacture in the Late Classic middle Ulua drainage about 35 km south of the lower Cacaulapa Valley. Most probably, control over public rites by notables residing at the regional capital of Gualjoquito was one means by which they sought to overcome the relative economic autonomy of households under their command (Ashmore 1987; 
Schortman 
et 
al. 
1986). 
This 
variation does not preclude a search for general statements concerning relations among political and economic processes. It does urge caution in advancing those claims, especially of adopting models derived from better-known areas, such as the Late Classic Maya Lowlands. 
Fifth, unraveling ancient political economies requires investigating behavioral variation across entire polities. Pursuing extensive programs of survey and excavation is the only way we can hope to recognize the varied forms and histo­ries of ancient political economies (Hirth 2013; 
Montmollin 1989; 
Smith 
2004). 
That 
said, 
even 
ambitious .eld programs can easily miss those rare sites that hold the key to understanding political and economic forms. We came very close to not excavating Site PVC162, and there are other equally unprepossessing settlements on other hills that could yield .nds challenging the interpretations presented here.
