explains why the study of women and gender should be included in New World prehistory. 
Chapter 2 is an overview of Paleoindian culture. Instead of highlighting kill sites, fluted points, and megafauna, Bruhns and Stothert examine a broader range of data: habi­tation sites with their full tool kits and varied food sources. They then try to imagine the full range of activities that would have been necessary to support Paleoindian camps: hunting; gathering; and the production of food, clothing, and shelter. Organizing these tasks, Bruhns and Stothert suggest, may have given rise to the norms of gender com­plementarity and interdependence which characterized many later Native American societies. Chapter 3 deals with women during the Archaic. Here, Bruhns and Stothert rely on skeletal material, a highly informative source of data for the study of gender in prehistory. Burials from Chile, Peru, Ecuador, California, and the southeastern United States reveal few differences in health status or grave goods by sex. The authors suggest that gender iden­tities and roles may not have been salient at this point in time. Bruhns and Stothert reject the notion that women's work was always more or less the same prior to industri­alization because they note considerable variation in the activities that women and men pursued from one region of the New World to another. 
Chapter 4 examines the transition to food production in the Americas. Because Bruhns and Stothert lack firm data concerning who first domesticated plants and why, they discuss the issues that incipient agriculturalists might have considered in making this transition. The advantages of food production-increased carrying capacity, reduced seasonal food shortages, increased storable food sur­pluses-permitted larger groups and promoted seden­tarism. Burial data highlight the disadvantages of food production: increased workloads, less adequate diets, and more disease. Bruhns and Stothert's consideration of the variety of actors and motives involved in the transition to agriculture and the costs and benefits that accrued to dif­ferent groups making this change supplies an interesting new approach to the problem. 
Chapters 5 through 9 examine various aspects of women's lives under conditions of increased social com­plexity. Chapter 5 focuses on family and household struc­ture. Topics here include archaeological efforts to reconstruct gendered labor within households and marriage patterns between them. Also considered are the causes and consequences of living in extended family groups. Chap­ter 6discusses women's roles in craft production. The tran­sition from hide-working to textiles is highlighted and problematized. The evidence for women's participation in household-based craft specialization is reviewed. Ethno­historic documents provide information about women's professional roles as merchants, marketers, sex workers, curers, midwives, and scribes. Chapter 7 explores ideolo­gies of gender and the roles of women and men in cere­monial practice. Here, Bruhns and Stothert rely on another important source of information for gender in prehistory: depictions of women and men in prehistoric art, particu­larly ceramic figurines. Although the uses of figurines are rarely known, their relative sizes, poses, and the com­plexity of their dress and hairstyles help to define gender roles and gender politics in specific prehistoric societies. Both representative art and ethnohistoric records help to identify the burials of women who were religious spe­cialists, including shamans, priests, ancestors, and oracles. 
Chapter 8 discusses women and political power. Bruhns and Stothert argue that women lost power relative to men as men cultivated sources of power outside the domestic sphere (e.g., warfare, trade, and religious practice). Nev­ertheless, women were sometimes power holders in the complex societies of the Americas. Female leaders can be identified in burials, and women rulers are mentioned in carved stelae and native historical narratives. Chapter 9 reviews the evidence for women's participation in warfare, as depicted in art and ethnohistory. This discussion seems intended to counter New Age feminist views that violence is a guy thing and that women are inherently nurturing. In their concluding chapter, Bruhns and Stothert assert their claims: Women were significant players in the develop­ment of prehistoric cultures and their experiences varied dramatically across time and space. Bruhns and Stothert also argue that a properly gendered prehistory plays an important role in contemporary society by showing that both women and men have always actively shaped their societies. Women in Ancient America demonstrates that an engendered archaeology is a better archaeology. Engen­dered archaeology is likely to consider a fuller range of archaeological evidence. It provides richer models of pre­historic societies and more complex analyses of the costs and benefits of major social changes. It defines new prob­lems for archaeological analysis (why did textiles replace worked hides? why did extended families replace nuclear families?), and it challenges archaeologists to acknowledge and account for women's participation in craft production, trade, medicine, politics, and religion. Archaeologists can benefit from this innovative view of New World prehis­tory by reading Women in Ancient America themselves and by assigning it as a required text in their classes.

Castedo's A History of Latin American Art and Architec­ture. Given the enormous interest in Latin America that has developed in the United States during the intervening decades, it is remarkable that no single volume in English has superseded Castedo's useful introductory book. The appearance, then, of John F. Scott's Latin American Art: Ancient to Modern is particularly welcome. Aimed at the level of college humanities courses, it will also be of inter­est to the Latin Americanist scholar or lay reader seeking a short, general overview of Latin American art. 
It is always difficult to cover a vast geographical area over several thousand years, particularly one whose his­tory was abruptly transformed by European conquest and colonization. Nevertheless, Scott has done an admirable job of introducing the art of this region, from Paleoindian incised bones to Nicaraguan painting of the 1980s. Over 80 percent of the book is devoted to Precolumbian cul­tures, addressing not only the art of familiar cultures like the Maya, Aztec, and Inca, but also that produced by more obscure groups, particularly of northern South America, lower Central America, and the Caribbean. It could be argued that in a volume of this scope, the author should have expanded more on the better-known cultures, exclud­ing the numerous but poorly documented groups of the Intermediate Area which are difficult to integrate into courses focused on either the Andean area or Mesoamer­ica. But Scott has done extensive research in these areas which have largely been neglected by other art historians. So for those who would like to include the Intermediate Area in a survey course, the material is here, and is not covered in any of the other current survey books of Pre­columbian art. 
The book is organized by time periods, each of the four 
Precolumbian chapters shifting between the Andes, the 
Intermediate Area, and Mesoamerica. To avoid the prob­
lems inherent in discussing several regions, all with dif­
ferent chronological sequences, Scott subsumes all 
chronologies between 100 B.C. and A.D. 800 under the 
traditional Mesoamerican heading of "Classic" civiliza­
tions, while adopting the term "Integration period" to 
describe the last centuries before the Spanish conquest. For 
the colonial and modem periods, however, the author shifts 
to a purely diachronic scheme, discussing developments 
throughout the region under such broad, traditional Euro­
pean rubrics as "Mannerism" and "Romanticism." Excep­
tions are made for the tum-of-century Hispanic literary and 
artistic movement known as Modemismo as well as for 
Mexican muralism. In both the colonial and modem chap­
ters, an attempt has been made to incorporate what Scott 
calls "Non-Hispanic artistic survivals" such as santeria, 
masks, weaving, and ex-votos. Even the colorful cloth 
applique arpilleras, first created by Chilean women in 
protest of the military government that followed the over­
throw of Allende, are discussed briefly. These so-called 
folk arts deserve a serious book-length study of their own, but these pages at least provide a short introduction to the subject. 
Inevitably, in a volume of this scope, factual errors and outdated information crop up. For example, recent exca­vations at Olmec La Venta have demonstrated that the main pyramid there was not originally built in its current shape of a volcano-like fluted cone, as long believed. Rather, it was a stepped pyramid with inset comers and although largely made of earth, its construction materials also included some clay and stone. The Tikal building illustrated (Figure 3.31), mistakenly labeled as SD-34 instead of SD-43, is indeed Teotihuacan in style, but is dated to the Late, not the Early Classic period. Surpris­ingly, although he refers to Ecuadorian long-distance sea trade, Scott does not mention that the famous engraved gourds found at Huaca Prieta in Peru may have been imported from Ecuador. The famous Gate of the Sun at Tiwanaku is described as being in situ but no reference is made to its almost certainly having been moved to its pre­sent position in antiquity. Furthermore, Scott seems to accept unquestioningly the identification of the deity rep­resented on the monument as a sun god and the whole relief as a solar calendar, despite the fact that considerable con­troversy surrounds the identity of the important central fig­ure and the meaning of the entire frieze. While it would be impractical to offer the reader all possible interpreta­tions of every object discussed in a general book of this type, some, like this major monument, deserve more detailed analysis. 
Issues of emphasis also could be debated. The prob­lems inherent in including the Intermediate Area have already been discussed. Colonial and modem specialists obviously will lament the superficial coverage given to those periods. In his introduction, Scott includes a some­what complex discussion of radiocarbon dating that would be more appropriate in an archaeology textbook. But he does not address the more relevant topic of the historiog­raphy of Latin American art, a subject deserving of at least a paragraph or two. More on technology, particularly in reference to metallurgy and textiles, would have enhanced the otherwise excellent stylistic analyses of Precolumbian objects and buildings in a wide range of media. Nazca repousse work, for example, is described as simpler tech­nologically than goldworking of the preceding Early Hori­zon, but the earlier technology is not discussed, beyond the fact that it also involved hammering. Although a use­ful chronology and maps of Latin America for each period have been provided, a glossary of terms would have been an appropriate addition to a book intended for student use. The bibliography also might have been expanded to include more works of interest to the general reader. This is par­ticularly true for the colonial period, for which the refer­ences are rather dated.

The quality of the illustrations, particularly the black­and-white photographs, is at best mixed: a few are out-of­focus, others lack contrast, and some are simply not the best examples available. Coverage also is uneven: for example, although modem urban planning and architec­ture are discussed in the text, only a few images, mostly of twentieth-century Brazilian architecture, are repro­duced. Scott's otherwise interesting discussion of assimi­lated Precolumbian traditions in the early colonial period demands more illustrations, particularly of unusual art forms such as mosaic featherwork. Additionally, the non­specialist may find such esoteric terms as alfiz (a Moorish architectural feature introduced to the New World by Span­ish builders) difficult to visualize without an illustration. Particularly considering the small number of the illustra­tions and their quality, the price of the book is prohibitive. A paperback edition would at least make it more accessi­ble to the students to whom the book is targeted. 
Scott's writing is nicely balanced between discussions of style and meaning. Difficult issues, such as the rela­tionship between Tula and ChicMn Itza, are handled grace­fully and succinctly. Despite the general nature of the book, there are new facts to be learned throughout. For example, this reviewer was unaware that sixteenth-century Taino pot­ters were asked by their Spanish overlords to make pot­tery combining Mixtec-style geometric decoration with Spanish vessel forms because the local style featured mod­eled spirit faces that the Catholic conquerors found offen­sive. Latin American Art: Ancient to Modern is the kind of book that all historians of Latin American art want to have at hand, but few want to write. Such a project requires not only a broad knowledge of Latin American art, but also firm editorial restraint and a clear and accessible writing style. Scott is to be commended for his success in this ambi­tious undertaking.

The 1980s and 1990s witnessed an explosion in research along the Pacific coast of Latin America, an area whose potential to elucidate transitions from fishing to farming has been evident since the appearance of the first radio­carbon chronologies for early coastal occupations in the late l 950s. The 17 chapters in this volume, which origi­nated as papers presented at the 1989 Centennial Circum­Pacific Prehistory Conference at Washington State University, provide an excellent summation of a half cen­tury of data relevant to the evolution of complex societies. 
Chapters address Mesoamerica (6), Central America (2), and South America (8). The chronological scope is from about 11,000 to 1000 B.C., with special emphasis on the period from about 2500 to 1500 B.C. (uncorrected). Blake's introduction emphasizes two central themes: the emergence of agriculture and social complexity. The approach is strongly ecological, concentrating on adapta­tions in food procurement and production. One example of this is a provocative analysis by Alfred Siemens of the early use of wetland ecosystems in southern Ecuador. 
Sedentism based on fishing and shellfish collecting is a pervasive theme. George Michaels and Barbara Voorhies review data for the preceramic Chantuto culture of Soconusco. Richard Cooke and Anthony Ranere interpret a detailed inventory of fish in estuarine and offshore envi­ronments of central Panama. Both Michael Moseley and Karen Wise provide synthetic updates on preceramic coastal adaptations in the central Andes, where maritime resources underwrote significant social complexity prior to widespread reliance on agriculture. 
Three chapters discuss early plant domestication. Bruce Benz focuses on phylogenetic divisions in early races of maize. He draws particular attention to the paucity of evi­dence for the genetic origins of maize, but suggests that its speciation from teosinte long predates the earliest mac­robotanical specimens. Deborah Pearsall discusses micro­botanical data from Las Vegas and Valdivia period sites in coastal Ecuador, where maize use dates to 6000 B.C. (some 2,500 years earlier than the earliest tiny cobs from the Tehuacan Valley). This raises questions about the mecha­nisms and motivations for its dispersal southward by humans from a locus of origin in Mexico. However, the "why" of maize's early Archaic dispersal remains without a satisfactory explanation. Dolores Pipemo's update on the origins and development of horticulture in Panama indi­cates maize was just one part of a complex spectrum of utilized plants. 
Scott Raymond describes archaeological surveys in the Valdivia Valley that have revealed complex webs of inter­action among inland and coastal communities. Lautaro Nufiez addresses coastal societies of southern Peru and northern Chile, presenting a cultural sequence based pri­marily upon data from coastal shellmounds and offering a discussion of the remarkably well-preserved Chinchorro mummies. MarkAldenderfer details changing subsistence strategies at pre-pottery sites along the South American coast, suggesting increasing diversification until about 5000 B.P., at which time subsistence specialization (both maritime and inland) resulted in highly aggregated settle­ments. 
Several chapters address the emergence of rank and centralized authority. Blake and John Clark offer a model for inherited status based on data from coastal Chiapas and
