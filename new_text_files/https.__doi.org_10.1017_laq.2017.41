
IMPERIAL-STYLE CERAMIC PRODUCTION ON A ROYAL ESTATE IN 
THE INKA HEARTLAND (CUZCO, PERU) 

Kylie E. Quave 
Horizontal excavations at the large Inka heartland village of Cheqoq (Maras, Cuzco, Peru) revealed the remains of a ceramic workshop where imperial-style vessels were produced (AD 1400–1530s). Cheqoq was a multiethnic settlement of forcibly migrated retainer laborers working for the noble lineage of the Inka ruler, Wayna Qhapaq. Production of imperial-style pottery in a small workshop associated with a royal lineage indicates that the heartland craft economy was not centralized in the urban Cuzco capital. The material remains of in situ production—raw materials, manufacturing facilities, tools, and by-products—provide a baseline for comparing other Inka pottery assemblages to this production locus. 
Excavaciones horizontales en el sitio de Cheqoq (Maras, Cuzco, Perú) —un pueblo grande en el centro del territorio imperial Inka— revelaron los restos arqueológicos de un taller alfarero donde se producían vasijas del estilo imperial Cuzco-Inka (datado entre 1400 y la década de 1530 dC). Cheqoq era un asentamiento de yanakuna, obreros de varias etnias quienes fueron re-asentados obligatoriamente por el Sapa Inka, y allí se ubicaban grandes depósitos de productos agrícolas del Inka. Según las fuentes etnohistóricas, el pueblo estaba asociado con el linaje del Inka Wayna Qhapaq. La producción de alfarería de estilo imperial en un pequeño taller asociado con un linaje real indica que la economía alfarera no estaba centralizada en la capital urbana del Cuzco. El análisis de los restos de producción —incluyendo materias primas, instalaciones de fábrica, herramientas y derivados—provee una base de comparación con otros conjuntos de cerámica Inka.

nka imperial-style (“Cuzco-Inka”) pottery is a highly visible material correlate for the colonizing power of the Inka and an essentialtool for communicatingthe generosity of imperial institutions to provide for subjects (Costin 2016). It is a standardized style fol­lowing canons of paste composition, surface .nish, decoration, morphological forms, and .r­ing techniques (Bray 2000; Pardo 1939;Rowe 1944:47–49;Valcárcel 1934, 1935; Figure1). Whatisnotyet understood,however,ishowstate controloverproduction actually operated. Who produced these goods and how? 
This report summarizes archaeological data con.rming thepresenceofaworkshop produc­ing imperial-style pottery at Cheqoq, a royal estatesite northwestofCuzcoontheMarasPlain (Figure2). Cheqoq is thelargest(22 ha) Inka­eravillage identi.ed outside Cuzco city.It was the residence of an ethnically pluralistic com­munity of retainers forcibly resettled on behalf of theInka rulerWayna Qhapaq’s noble lineage (Quave 2012). Excavations (252 m2)in 2009– 2010 revealed large, well-preservedstorehouses, 14 ha of households (Quave et al. 2013), and a ceramic workshop(Figure3;Table1). 
Inthe absenceofextantevidenceintheCuzco region, researchers previously suggested that Cuzco-Inka pottery was produced under close state supervision within the municipal bound­ariesofCuzco orin other elite-controlled areas of the heartland (Covey 2009:251). Potters lived in themodernCuzco districts of San Sebastián and San Gerónimo in the early colonial period (Bauer 2004:91),wheretheymayhavefabricated Cuzco-Inka wares, but no archaeological evi­dence has yet been identi.ed there or elsewhere in the Cuzco basin. Beyond the Cuzco basin,

imperial pottery production has been reported archaeologically in two heartland locales with sparse detail (Farrington 2013:232): an area of densely distributed wasters decorated in the imperialstyleand remainsofpossibleopen.ring areas atTambokancha-Tumibamba, andalarge waster pile at Quispiwanka. At Cheqoq, never­theless, there are facilities, by-products, tools, and raw materials, which together lend greater con.dence to its identi.cation as a production locus forimperial goods. 
Imperial pottery produced and consumed in Cuzco—including Cheqoq—was crafted from a recognizable fabric characterized by a clean orange-to salmon-colored body with nonplastic inclusionsof consistent sizes(~0.4 mm),shapes, and densities, including basalt-andesite, mica, and granitic types(Ixeretal. 2014).Vesselforms include consistently proportionate jars, pots, cups, and plates (Bray 2008;Rowe 1944:48). Thesebroad functional categorieswereusedin ceramic analysis at Cheqoq, with rim sherds classi.ed into .ner categoriesbyproportions of neck and body length, neck length and mouth width, shape of neck and/or mouth, angle of neck and mouth, and thicknessofthe body/neck/

Evidence for Inka Ceramic Production 

Theproduction ofimperial-style orCuzco-Inka ceramics at Cheqoq occurred in a nucleated, restricted terrace (48 m2) located between the domestic sector and camelid corrals.The terrace was separated from other areas by double-sided 1m wide .eldstone and mortar(pirca)walls on three sides(Figure4). The context was identi­.ed due to extremely high densities of surface materials coupled with thepresenceofabundant super.cial ash and waster sherds (over.red or mis.red vessel fragments with visible signs of bloating, slumping, crazing, and fusion with othervessels).Atestexcavationof2m2 initially revealed remains fromaprimaryproduction con­text, and theareaexposedwasextendedto31m2 (64.4% of the horizontal space of the 48 m2 terrace withevidence forprimary production) to sample features within the area. The extent of the workshop was established by assessing the presence of ashysediment and the dense pottery scatter on the surface, and con.rmed through a series of 2 m2 test pits around and beyond the ashyarea. The depthoftheworkshop area below themodernsurfacewas70 cmonthe southeast side (.ring area south of the east-west dividing wall), 110 cm on the northeast side (forming and .nishingarea northofthe east-westdividing wall), and 30 cm on the west side. Located behind the rear walls of the domestic terraces, theworkshopwas upwindfrom households and adjacenttoalarge groupof corralsthat probably supplied camelid dung as .ringfuel. 
The very high density of pottery fragments and production debris on the surface contin­ued into the subsurface strata. When quanti­fying excavated “diagnostic” sherds (decorated or slipped body sherds, and any rim, base, or handle sherd), the production locus yielded 558 sherds/m2, while the site overall yielded 29 sherds/m2 (subsurface depths were relatively consistent across Cheqoq’s excavation units). All diagnostic pottery was analyzed by coding forsurface decoration and .nishes,morphology, andfabric characteristics(color,texture,inclu­sions, porosity, heterogeneity, .ring evidence), with use of an optical microscope and/or hand loupe. Diagnostic pottery other than Cuzco-Inka/imperialInkawares (identi.ed following Meyers 1975; Pardo 1939;Rowe 1944:47– 49; Valcárcel 1934, 1935) was categorized as “Killke” (Bauer and Stanish 1990;Rowe

At Cheqoq, 71.2%(n = 3,683)of thediagnos­tic pottery assemblage in domestic contexts was categorized as Cuzco-Inka, along with a small quantityof Killkesherds(n = 12).Atotherexca­vatedInka heartland villages,wefoundarange of 18%–24% Cuzco-Inka pottery in domestic contexts(QuaveandCovey 2015).Inthe ceramic workshop area at Cheqoq, 88.7%(n = 15,362) wasidenti.ed as Cuzco-Inka sherds, and we also found a single sherd of Urcosuyo pottery with a distinctive paste (a ware produced near Lake Titicaca)(Table2). Much of the pottery recov­eredin theworkshop area appearstohave been produced on site,asevidencedby thepresence of waster sherds in the same strata as well-.red vessel remnants. 
The most commonly identi.ed Cuzco-Inka vessel form in the Cheqoq workshop was the narrow-mouthjar (also called an aríbalo). Narrow-mouthjarsare associated withdrystor­age, but also with the secondary fermentation, storage, and serving of aqha (Bray 2008). It is also the most commonly found imperial-style form within the bounds of the empire. Classic

formsofplates and shallowbowls were thenext most commonformatCheqoq, followedbypots withevertedrims(Meyers’sForm10[1975:14]); these were typically used for food preparation and serving. There was a minority of neckless potsatCheqoq, whilecupsor keros were theleast commonlyfound form(Table3). 
Throughexcavations,wefound that thework­shop terracewassubdividedbya1mwide pirca wall liketheexteriorwalls,withahigher .oor elevation on the southern side. On the northern side, excavations produced evidence for vessel forming and .nishing as well as an ash dump. Southofthedividingwall,we identi.edastone­enclosed .ring area just east of another ash midden and possibledrying patio. 
The material correlates for a ceramic work­shop include raw materials, manufacturing facilities and tools, and by-products (Arnold 1993; Chávez 1984–1985; Hayashida 1999; Sillar 1996). At least two out of the three of these categoriesmustbepresent to argue forin situ production. Thereisstrongevidence forall three at Cheqoq. Evidence for forming pottery includes raw clay caches; clay scraps; un.red coils; molds; sherds and stones for smoothing, polishing, andburnishing; and/or bone or stone scraping tools. Direct evidence for painting pot­teryis foundin .nishedvesselsandthetoolsand rawmaterials associated with paint manufacture, including crushed or ground pigment, unworked nodules, and grinding stones.European updraft kilnswereintroduced after colonization, so there is no expectation of a formal kiln structure. Thereshouldbeevidenceof an open pit: the co-occurrence of ash, .ring furniture, burnt earth, and burnt clay, surrounded by a stone lining. Firing features shouldbe accompaniedby .ring by-products such as vitri.ed clay and waster sherds. All of the above material expectations were metinthe Cheqoqworkshopexcept molds; vessels were coil-built. 
It is unclear whether paste preparation took place at Cheqoq. There are no large stone slabs or block supports for rocker grinders or other evidence,butalargeclodofprepared clay(7kg) recoveredinsidethe eastexteriorwallindicates curationofprepared paste.Thevessels produced at Cheqoq were made with the same andesite­temperedfabric foundat other Cuzcoregion sites with Cuzco-Inka pottery. 
Pigment crushingand preparationare inferred in production contextsby thepresenceof hand-held andesite mortars and pestles. On the north side of the workshop, we recovered hammer-stones (n = 4) of granite, andesite, and lime­stone, as well as smaller netherstones (n = 4), and handstones(n = 6)of granite, andesite,feld­spathic quartzite, and quartzitic sandstone. Addi­tionally,fragmentsof specular iron ore(n = 3), an exceptionally heavy rock, were found with red pigment on them, as if used for crushing. Possible red and white pigment nodules were recovered throughout the workshop, as well as a concentration ofdried self-slip clay the color of Cuzco Buff. 
Evidence for forming activities including coiling, shaping, cutting, and smoothing were mostly found on the north side of the work­shop(Figure5).Expedient scrapersand informal

tools were fashioned from fragments of bone and Cuzco-Inka and utilitarian sherds, includ­ing wasters. Bones for scraping and forming green vessels included worked artiodactyl ribs and scapulae(n = 8).Twenty-eight highlyworn polishers or burnishers were made of andesite, quartz, quartzite, quartzitic sandstone, basalt, and diorite, and weighed between 1.2g and 90.6g, representing a wide variety of sizes and shapes.

Asemicircular,burned, stone-lined, ashyarea of 4 by 2.5 meters was clearly used for .ring and is comparable to Andean open-air .ring areas (Hayashida 1999:343; Sillar 1996:261). High-temperatureburninginaprimary context in the Cheqoq workshop is evidenced by red scorched earth in and around the pit (Munsell 2.5YR 3/3 dark reddish brown), dense carbon, ash lenses (Munsell 10YR 7/1 light gray), and sooty, .re-affected stones within thepit.. Strati-graphically, the .ring pit contained a series of compacted, .at ash lenses and the results of multiple cleaning events around its periphery (Supplemental Figure 1). Firing by-products— .red clay,burnt clay,vitri.ed clay, and hardened ash—were dispersedthroughout and were espe­cially dense around the .ring pit and middens. The total mass of the lightweight vitri.ed clay (recoveredwith ¼” screen) was 13.65 kg. Other by-productsofceramic productionincluded dis­carded fragments of prepared clay formed into small coils (raw and .red).Wastersherds were abundant(n = 606), as were sherds fused with lumps of slag. Dried dung, grasses, and straw fueled this type of .ring set-up, while wood wasaless preferred option(Chávez1984–1985). Organic fuel remains were recovered in and around the .ring pit and middens, including grasses, cacti, sedges, and .owering plants. The most abundant plant remains in the .ring area were coca seeds(n = 67), perhaps resultingfrom ceremonial .rings. 
The Cuzco-Inka ceramic remains in the Cheqoq workshop reveal a stylistically and technologically standardized product consis­tent with Cuzco-Inka pottery from heartland and major provincial administrative centers. WithintheCheqoqworkshop,just42of 17,316 diagnostic sherds (0.2%) approximated the

AllCuzco-Inka sherds were composed of the imperial style andesite-tempered fabric. Most Cuzco-Inka sherds were .nished with a highexterior polish(n = 15,327 or 99.8%), and all polychrome sherds were painted with some combination of well-de.ned red, black, and white.Rim morphologies indicated consistency within subcategoriesofjars, pots,bowls, plates, and cups.

Conclusions 

Workshop remainsatCheqoq signal that imperial ceramic production in the heartland probably occurredatmultiple,small-scalespecialistwork­shops. Reconstructing the production process here helps Inka researchers establish a baseline forevaluatingaf.nitiestothe Cheqoq production styleinother archaeological casesof production to determine how homogeneous crafting was under imperialism. Furthermore,the presenceof thisworkshopatalarge storagefacilitystaffedby royal estate retainer laborersindicates that Inka noble lineages individually controlledaspectsof imperialcraft production, whichhas implications formodelingthe heartland economyinrelation to royal estates. Continued analysis of domestic and production contexts at Cheqoq will pro­vide further insight into theInka ceramic econ­omy and the roles played by forcibly migrated subjects.
