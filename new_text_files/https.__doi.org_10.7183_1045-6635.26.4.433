HOUSES, RESIDENTIAL BURIALS, D IDENTITY IN THE RAPAY AN 
VALLEY AND THE UPPER MARANON DRAINAGE, PERU, DURING 
LATE ANDEAN PREHISTORY 

Alexis Mantha 
The impressive multi-story funerary monuments found in the Upper Maraii6n Drainage of the northern Central Andes of Peru have long fascinated people. Archaeologists and historians have studied their spatial distribution to define the identity of the populations occupying the region during the Late Intermediate period (AD. !000-1450). Rather than focus on mon­umental architecture, in this paper I explore group identity in the Upper Maraii6n by analyzing the shape and layout of houses and evidence of residential funerary practices. Based on a regional comparative approach, I argue that diversity in domestic architecture and mortuary customs reflects a constellation of distinct collective identities . 
Los impresionantes edificios de varios pisos en la region del alto Maraii6n, en Peru, han cautivado la atenci6n de la gente desde hace tiempo. Arque6logos e historiadores utilizaron su distribuci6n espacial para definir la identidad cultural de las poblaciones def alto Maraii6n durante el periodo del lntermedio tardfo (1000-1450 d.C). En este articulo, en lugar de enfocurme sabre la arquitectura monumental, analizo mas bien la morfologia y la organizaci6n espacial de las viviendas, asi coma las evidencias de prdcticas funerarias residenciales, para explorar cuestiones de identidad cultural en el alto Maraii6n, en los Andes centrales del Peru. A partir de una perspectiva comparativa regional, mantengo que la diversidad morfol6gica de las viviendas y las distintas prdcticasfunerarias residenciales reflejaban una constelaci6n de identidades colectivas durante los periodos tardios de la prehistoria andina en el alto Maranan . 
he usefulness of studying ethnic identity Tin the Andes using household archaeology has been advocated primarily by Stanish in a series of influential papers (Stanish 1989, 1992; Stanish et al. 1993; see Aldenderfer and Stanish 1993). Stanish argues that, because arti­facts found in burial contexts result mainly from interregional exchange ensuing from ritual, eco­nomic, and political ties among groups, they are not good indicators of local ethnic identity. He maintains that domestic architecture, of which the household represents the basic component, is a better marker of ethnicity. House structures and the materials found in association with them result mainly from the production and consumption pat­terns of local residents. Thus, they reflect the cul­tural particularities and identities of these indi­viduals (Stanish 1989: 12-13). After reviewing social, ecological, and economic factors that may influence the particular form of a dwelling, Stan­ish further argues that the overall shape of houses, their spatial arrangement in a settlement, and the layout of distinct functional rooms and activity areas are determined primarily by conservative cultural preferences (Aldenderfer and Stanish 1993: 8; Stanish 1989, 2005: 228-229; Stanish et al. 1993). 
The claim that the shapes and layouts of houses represent a fairly conservative dimension of culture-thus communicating a form of cultural affiliation -is well documented in anthropology and archaeology (e.g., Bawden 1993; Blanton 1994; Kent 1990; Van Gijseghem and Vaughn 2008: 113). Nonetheless, the proposal that domes­tic contexts are more indicative of ethnic identity than funerary contexts is far more tentative. In­deed, several Andean ethnographic and archaeo­logical studies have shown that houses are the lo-

cus not only of everyday activities, but also of di­verse and rich rituals (e.g., Candeler 1997; Cutright 2013; Ramirez 2005:141; Salazar 2012; Vaughn 2004:80). Furthermore, many archaeo­logical studies have documented that burials are often found within house structures and that the latter may also contain a high proportion of foreign exotic items, both in the Andes (e.g., Millaire 2004; Nash 2009: 242; Vaughn 2005) and else­where (Adams and King 2011; Gillespie 2000; McAnany 1995; Hodder and Cessford 2004; Kuijt 2001; Laneri 2007). The distinction between do­mestic and funerary contexts, although useful in some circumstances (e.g., Aldenderfer 1993), nev­ertheless obscures the fact that these two social contexts are often interrelated and inseparable. 
In this article, I examine the relationship be­tween group identity, household architecture, and residential burials within the Rapayan Valley, and more broadly within the Upper Marafi6n Drainage of Peru (Supplemental Figure 1) during the Late Intermediate (A.D. 1000-1450; LIP) and Late Horizon (A.D. 1450-1532; LH) periods. I begin by discussing some theoretical and method­ological problems related to the concept of an­cestor veneration. I proceed by outlining previous archaeological hypotheses concerning identity in the Upper Marafi6n, after which I discuss data on residential burials and house architecture in the Rapayan Valley and the Upper Marafi6n. I conclude with a discussion outlining a new per­spective regarding identity in the Upper Marafi6n Drainage during the latter periods of Andean pre­history. 
Residential Mortuary Practices, Ancestor 
Veneration, and Identity 

Several recent archaeological studies have em­phasized the close relationship between burials found in or near house structures, social memory, and identity (Adams and Kusumawati 2011; Hod­der and Cessford 2004; King 2011; Kuijt 2001, 2008; Joyce 2011).According to this perspective, similarities in residential burial practices promote shared experiences surrounding death and thus the transmission of common norms, values, and identity. Furthermore, several authors have con­sidered the presence of residential burials as good material indicators of "house societies" (Adams and King 20 I I ; Adams and Kumsumawati 201 I ; Gillespie 2000, 2011; King 2011; Joyce 2011). In this conceptual framework, it is assumed that res­idential burials materialize the efforts of the living to maintain a strong connection to the past by venerating, remembering, or commemorating im­portant ancestors (Adams and King 2011 :4-5). By the same token, the connection between the living and the dead through residential burial is assumed to reflect one of the fundamental values of "house societies" -that is, a desire for perpe­tuity or an active effort to maintain continuity with the past (Gillespie 2000: 12-14). 
Evidence of continuity with the past is best seen through the degree of interactions the living maintain with the dead (Thompson 2014). In many societies, the most intense contact between the living and the dead occurs through ancestor veneration. These practices are based on the belief that specific and unique deceased kin possess su­pernatural powers that can directly affect, either positively or negatively, their living descendants (DeLeonardis and Lau 2004:78; Townsend 1969:23). Ancestor veneration should thus be dis­tinguished from other funerary programs (e.g., Sheils 197 5; Thompson 2014) such as the cult of the dead (Morris 1991). For example, Christians honor the dead. Nonetheless, unlike in the case of ancestor veneration, the deceased are generally not believed to be endowed with the power of interfering in the affairs of the living (Aries 1975; Krauskopff 1991: 66). To obtain the goodwill of ancestors, the living must propitiate them peri­odically or intermittently through rituals, offer­ings, feasts, and prayers. Ancestor veneration thus 
entails ceremonies that extend well beyond the formal disposal of the dead (Fortes I 965; Lau 2002: 281; Morris 1991). Repeated rituals focus­ing on the veneration of a common ancestor are particularly important events during which indi­vidual and collective identities are asserted be­cause the communicative performance of these rituals is centered on the common genealogy of participants. As a result, ancestor veneration pro­motes a shared sense of origin and memory, and hence of common identity (Dillehay 1990:226­27, 235; Fortes 1965; Hastorf 2003:308; Kuijt 2001:81 ). It is noteworthy, however, that not all the dead become ancestors (Thompson 2014; Whitley 2002: 122). A deceased person can reach

the status of ancestor initially because of excep­tional qualities shown during his or her lifetime (e.g., being the original founder of a group, a leader, conqueror, possessor of wealth or knowl­edge, etc.), and later by the conscious collective acts of remembrance undertaken by his or her living descendants (DeLeonardis and Lau 2004: 80; Helms 1998:35; Krauskopff 1991:65). 
Researchers are often faced with a challenge when attempting to recognize ancestor veneration in the archaeological record. Proposed material correlates include grave reopenings, delayed buri­als, more elaborate shrines located within lived spaces, evidence of feasting near mortuary struc­tures, secondary offerings and caching, and, most compellingly, the postmortem manipulation of the deceased. The latter includes, for example, artificial mummification as well as the removal, cleansing, and keeping of skulls and long bones (DeLeonardis and Lau 2004:80-82; Helms 1998:50; Isbell 1997; Millaire 2004; Parker 1999:158-161; Thompson 2014). 
In the absence of clear evidence, some re­searchers have circumvented the problem of iden­tifying ancestors by arguing that individuals buried in residential contexts, and sometimes the objects buried with or without them, were memo­rialized, remembered, or commemorated by the living (Gillespie 2011; Joyce 2011; King 2011). In doing so, these archaeologists have, on the one hand, inferred conscious efforts on the part of the living to maintain a continuity with the past, and, on the other, they have suggested that the connection between the living and the dead re­flected a supposed desire for perpetuity typical of "house societies." This line of thinking is prob­lematic for several reasons. First, as Elizabeth Arkush (2011 :205) notes, just like ancestor ven­eration, the concepts of social memory and, by extension, remembrance and commemoration are so broadly inferred that they have become ex­tremely vague both in terms of meaning and in terms of the procedure required for archaeologists to recognize them materially. Second, using an­cestor veneration (or remembrance and commem­oration of the dead) as the sole criterion to identify "house societies" is troublesome because other kinds of corporate organizations, such as lineages, ramages, and conical clans, are known to practice ancestor veneration (Hageman 2004:65). Further­
more, ancestor veneration practices have been documented within a wide range of political sys­tems, from mid-range societies to empires (Lau 2002:281; McAnany 1995). Finally, and probably most importantly, inferring the same memorial­izing effect for diverse mortuary and funerary practices within and between societies is likely to result in oversimplified and homogeneous in­terpretations of the social practices of the past. 
In the following sections, I review previous archaeological hypotheses regarding cultural identity in the Upper Marnfi6n during the LIP, after which I present the diversity of house mor­phology and residential burial practices in the Rapayan Valley. 
Previous Archaeological Hypotheses Regarding Late Prehispanic Group Identity in the Upper Maraii6n 

The Upper Maraii6n region, located in the central eastern Andes of Peru, encompasses both banks of the Maraii6n River in the modem departments of Huanuco, Ancash, and La Libertad, between the Cordillera Blanca to the west and the Amazon drainage to the east (Figure 1). The Upper Maraii6n Drainage extends over 500 km on its north-south axis and 250 km from east to west. Ethnohistorical studies (Le6n 2003; Mantha 2004; Vallaranos 1959) suggest that this region was oc­cupied by at least a dozen ethnic groups in early colonial times (Figure 2). 
Following early archaeological explorations (e.g., Cardich 1958; Ribero 1841), the French scholar Bertrand Flomoy became the first to con­duct more systematic archaeological investiga­tions in the Upper Maraii6n in the 1940s and 1950s. Flomoy (1955-1956, 1957) carried out an archaeological reconnaissance over a vast area, from the headwaters of the Maraii6n River in the modem province of Dos de Mayo to the south, up to Tantamayo to the north (Figure 1). Im­pressed by tall and well-preserved multi-story buildings at several LIP sites in the region (Sup­plemental Figure 2), he suggested that the settle­ments around Tantamayo were the center of a culture that spread over a vast and unspecified zone (Flomoy 1957: 207).

Rozenberg carried out a survey of the Tantamayo Valley in 1980 (Bonnier 1981; Bonnier and Rozenberg 1981; Bonnier et al. 1983). Within a radius of 61 km around the modern village of Tantamayo (Figure 1), they identified 81 sites with well-preserved stone architecture that they attributed to the LIP and the LH. Based on the 
spatial distribution of tall multi-story buildings and village architectural layouts, they suggested that the "Tantamayo Culture" likely extended south of Tantamayo on the western bank of the Marafi6n River into the modern department of Ancash, where the Rapayan Valley is located (Bonnier et al. 1983:106, Note 8; Bonnier and Rozenberg 1981 : 15-16). 
By the end of the 1970s, Hernan Amat had con­ducted several archaeological explorations in the department of Ancash and Huanuco, with a focus on the site of Rapayan (Figure 1). Amat places the development of surface stone architecture at Ra­payan and many other sites in the LIP. He suggests the name "Alto Marafi6n Culture" for the settle­ments bordering the Marafi6n River that shared such attributes as multi-story buildings, defensive walls, above-ground mortuary structures, a partic­ular construction technique (pachilla), ridge-top locations, and LIP ceramics called estampado. The "Alto Marafi6n Culture" would have covered a large territory spanning from the department of Amazonas in the north to the department of Huanuco in the south. Amat singles out sites like Kuelap in Chachapoya, Pajaten in San Martin, Ra­payan, Tantamayo, and Ichu as part of the "Alto Marafi6n Culture" (Amat 1971:50-51). 
In a later publication, Amat substantially mod­ifies his interpretations, as well as the chrono­logical sequence identified at Rapayan (Amat 1980). Notably, he divides the LIP into two sub­periods. In the first half of the LIP he places the emergence, development, and fall of the Yaro Empire (AD. 1000--1200), followed in the second half of the LIP by the development of the "Alto Marafi6n Culture" (AD. 1200-1450). Because of lack of evidence, subsequent archaeological investigations in the region have either rejected (Ibarra 1999; Mantha 2004; Matos 1994) or ig­nored (Bonnier et al. 1983; Salcedo 2012) Amat's arguments for the existence of the Yaro Empire.

The Rapayan Valley 
The Rapayan Valley is located on both banks of the Upper Marafi6n River at the eastern border of the department of Ancash and the western limit of the department of Huanuco, in the provinces of Huari, Huamalfs, and Marafi6n (Figure 1). In crossing the Andes from west to east, the steep mountains of the Rapayan area are one of the last physical barriers one faces before reaching the tropical forests of the Amazon drainage. The Marafi6n and the numerous small streams that feed it have carved spectacular depressions in the mountains through time. As a result, valleys in the Upper Marafi6n such as Rapayan are largely devoid of flat space. Altitude changes substan­tially over short distances, varying thousands of meters over the course of a few kilometers. In this extremely rugged topography, agriculturally productive lands are limited and tend to be con­centrated on smoother hillsides. 
The late prehispanic stone architectural re­mains of the Rapayan Valley are among the best preserved in the Andes. During three field seasons held in 200I, 2002, and 2007, my team and I sur­veyed a territory of 500 km2 and identified and closely studied the surface architecture of 81 sites (Figure 3). Based on excavations carried out at the site of Rapayan in 2005 and surface ceramics collected at the other sites, most of the settlements with visible architecture were originally con­structed during the LIP (A.D. 1000-1450) and continued to be occupied during the LH (A.D. 
1450-1532). 

LIP/LH lntrasite Settlement Pattern 
Without considering hilltop forts (indicated as DCC in Figure 3), residential sites are the most abundant type represented in the survey data set, making up 58 of the 81 total sites recorded (Figure 3). They are located on top of hillsides between 2,400 m and 3,700 m of altitude in the quechua

ecological niche. Their placement in the agricul­turally favorable quechua zone, their association with countless agricultural terraces, and the ab­sence of corrals in the region before the arrival of the Inkas suggest that the population of Ra­payan had an economy based on farming. 
The vast majority of residential sites displays the same architectural pattern and can be divided into three parts according to different types of mortuary structures (Figure 4). They exhibit small above­ground sepulchers (chullpas) in the lower end, houses and residential burials in the middle, and one or more multi-story buildings in the upper part. 
House Structures of the Rapaydn Valley 
Before conducting excavations at the settlement of Rapayan at the time of the first two surveys, I had inferred the presence of house structures from two of the three criteria defined by Stanish (1989)-that is, segregated structures that repeat themselves in each residential site. Despite the fact that residential settlements include a variety of stone constructions, house structures are by far the most widely distributed architectural units at these sites. 
Since house structures are relatively homoge­neous from one residential site to the other, I will designate them from now on as the Rapayan House Type. They have a roughly rectangular shape and are built beside one another on long horizontal terraces (Figure 4). They are usually so densely constructed that, on occasion, the back wall of a house also functioned as a retaining wall for the dwelling constructed above it.

Based on measurements taken from a sample of well-preserved constructions at the Rapayan settlement, on average, house structures cover 33 m2 and measure 6 m in length by 5 m in width (Table 1). Their plan and construction technique are very homogeneous. Walls are invariably con­structed of superimposed flat and finely polished stones held together by a fine layer of mortar-a construction technique commonly known as pachilla (Figures 5 and 6; Supplemental Figure 3). Internal walls also possess many small niches. Their number and spatial disposition within the walls do not appear to follow any pre-established pattern. Door frames are rectangular or slightly trapezoidal (Figure 5 and 6; Supplemental Figure 3). They are built by superimposing alternating horizontal and vertical flat stone blocks on each external side of the frame. The voids left in the middle of the frame are filled with small flat stones (Figure 5; Supplemental Figure 3). 

Some houses comprise up to four rooms, but the great majority have only two. The wall that divides the first and second (i.e., "front" and "back") rooms is very distinctive. On either side of the door frame, there is a wide cavity in the wall (Figures 5 and 6). These two spaces in the wall are completely sealed, with the exception of a small window above a vertically oriented flat, circular piece of limestone. The openings face the frontal room (Figure 6). A sample of 43 well­preserved wall cavities from Rapayan averages 100 cm in width, 97 cm in height, and 101 cm in length. 
What function did those cavities serve? Father Barnabe Cobo's work, written around 1653, is very instructive in this regard. While discussing the mummification of the dead in different regions of the Andes, Cobo informs us that "The embalmed bodies were greatly venerated and sacrifices were made to each one according to their resources. Some kept the bodies of their relatives in their own houses" (Cobo 1990:40 [1653], emphasis added; see also p. 247 for a similar statement).

As these observations from Cobo suggest, I believe that the wall cavities served as mortuary chambers used to keep the embalmed bodies of the dead in the houses. It is interesting to note that the primary school at the village of Rapayan keeps a collection of a dozen mummies. They are all placed in the fetal position, with their hands and feet tied. Given their size, each of the cavities could easily have held a mummy. The small window giving access into the cavity would also have allowed household members to make offerings to the deceased (Ramirez 2005:30, 202). The fact that most of the flat, vertical stones seal­ing the cavities appear to have been deliberately ripped out also suggests that these cavities once contained important objects usually encountered in tombs-such as mummies, ceramics, and metals-which would have attracted looters from the past and present. In fact, some of the best­preserved household cavities still contain human bones. Direct evidence comes from an amateur video filmed in Huaraz in the 1990s to encourage tourism in the Callej6n de Conchuco. In a scene set in the ruins of Rapayan, a group of looters take a mummy out of a wall cavity, piece by piece. Additionally, in a documentary film about Rapayan (Delfour 2008), an elder of the present­day village, Delia Achic Picon, reveals that her cousin, an expatriate from the same village who now lives in Huaraz, keeps a mummy in his sec­ond house in Rapayan in order to protect it while he is away. In the same documentary film, several elders confess to having discovered mummies in the ruins during their youth. 
One of the objectives of our 2005 excavations at Rapayan was to test the hypothesis that rec­tangular constructions were indeed house struc­tures. To this end, we systematically excavated two presumed house structures (Houses 15 and 30; see Figure 4). Ceramic stratigraphy indicates that the two structures were originally built during the LIP and continued to be occupied during the LH. Indeed, the occupational floor levels con-

tained several sherds of Inka-style ceramics, whereas the subfloor levels, which correspond to the original construction of the houses, displayed typical LIP ceramics and no Inka-style fragments. In addition to this chronological data, the exca­vations also revealed the presence of hearths, car­bonized corncobs, llama and guinea pig bones, a great quantity of ceramic fragments with carbon residues, hoes, mace heads, mortars, pestles, grinding stones, and a variety of other lithic and bone tools at the floor level in both structures (Figure 7, Supplemental Figure 4). This evidence of domestic activities, the third criterion defined by Stanish ( 1989), confirms that the rectangular constructions were indeed residential. 
In addition to domestic activities, our investi­gations also brought to light evidence of ritual practices. The two large niches within the back wall of the front room of each house structure were most likely used to keep human remains and would have been related to rituals in honor of the dead. However, as opposed to other mor­tuary structures such as the chullpas and the tall multi-story buildings (see Mantha 2009 for a more complete discussion on these mortuary structures) found within residential sites, the large household niches reflect a ritual practice that was much more exclusive and private in nature. The fact that the cavities are sealed except for small windows suggests that the mummified bodies or bones were not meant to be moved. The deceased kept in the household were thus venerated by a limited number of people, most probably mem­bers of the same family. The bodies held in the wall cavities might thus have been the ancestors from whom each family traced its most direct origin. Since this pattern is repeated in every dwelling, each house structure most likely hosted co-residents composed of socially and biologi­cally related family members. 
The two excavated house structures displayed further data indicating that they were the locus of rituals. In House 30, we unearthed in the north­west comer of the main room a small L-shaped feature measuring 58 cm in height, 170 cm in length, and 80 cm in width (Figure 7). It had four openings near the floor level and a top covering of stone slabs. Despite the fact that it had been partially destroyed by looters, we recovered on the inside floor human remains (three molars and a humerus) and several undecorated typical LIP ceramic fragments. 
We also recovered important data in one of the two rooms located behind the wall containing the two large niches. In Room A, still on floor level, we unearthed two stone polishers, a claw from a bird of prey, a dozen shell beads, and a silver jewel (tupu), as well as human bones, including a femur, an ulna, three vertebrae, and a sacrum (Fig­ure 7). The association of what appear to have been offerings with human bones-both in the small L-shaped feature and in Room A-seems to imply that they had a funerary function and that funerary rituals took place inside House 30. 
In House 15, among the several small niches decorating the interior walls, we unearthed a small, sealed niche in the north side wall (Sup­plemental Figure 5). Located 2 cm above the oc­cupational floor, it was buried under a meter and a half of debris. The opening of the niche in the interior wall measured only I 0 cm wide and 15 cm high, but within the wall it extended 3.40 m on its east-west axis and 40 cm north to south. Inside we discovered a great quantity of car­bonized maize grains associated with a polished circular stone tool with a perforation in the mid­dle. I believe the latter to be a mace head, but others would argue that it was a farming imple­ment. Some archaeological studies conducted elsewhere in the Andes have established a close relationship between niches and offerings made in the context of ancestor veneration practices (e.g., Hastorf 2003; McEwan 1998). In addition, historical documents clearly mention that rituals involved the burning of food, especially maize, as a way to feed ancestors or mythical beings in order to obtain their goodwill (Doyle 1988; Isbell 1997; Ramirez 2005). It is thus highly probable that the Rapayan household niche offering was related to an ancestor veneration practice. It can be tentatively proposed that if the lithic tool was a mace head, the household ritual involved pleas for success in warfare or defense. On the other hand, if it was a farming tool, it can be hypothe­sized that the offerings were linked to an agricul­tural fertility ritual. Finally, it is important to mention that these offerings were discovered in the only sealed niche context found to date at Rapayan. When we consider the great number of niches decorating the inside walls of households,

it can be postulated that they were also used dur­ing the course of specific rituals. In fact, people today still make offerings in the form of coca leaves, cigarettes, alcohol, squashes, sodas, and flowers in house niches and near chullpas (Delfour 2008). Houses were clearly the locus of various rituals. 
In sum, the people of the Rapayan Valley lived in relatively homogeneous house structures that hosted kin members. People also co-resided with their own deceased kin, as demonstrated by a va­riety of evidence for intra-household funerary practices. Evidence of such household ritual prac­tices at Rapayan includes bones found in house niches, carbonized maize grains associated with a lithic artifact in a small niche of House 15, and several offerings associated with human bones in House 30. Indirect evidence of ritual interac­tions with the dead includes the conservation of prehispanic mummies at the Rapayan elementary

school, testimonies made by present-day Rapayan elders about the existence of mummies in local ruins, the ongoing practice of placing offerings in the niches of ruined houses, and abundant eth­nohistorical evidence about late prehispanic an­cestor veneration for the region under considera­tion (e.g., Ramirez 2005). When considering the crucial importance of the deceased in the con­struction of group identity in the Andes (Ramirez 2005), the widespread pattern of families sharing their living space with their mummified ancestors suggests that the people of the Rapayan Valley shared common practices of memory, origin, and identity. Did the people of other neighboring val­leys also share this pattern? 
The Rapayan House Structures in Wider 
Regional Context 


The Southern Edge of the Survey Area: Pampan I, Pampan II, San Jose, and Huata 
Within the southern edge of the surveyed territory (Figure 3), the residential settlements of Pampan I, Pampan II, and San Jose share very similar ar­chitectural features that differ substantially from those of Rapayan. These three sites represent the highest residential settlements of the survey area, located at an altitude above 4,100 min the puna ecological zone. Their high elevation makes agri­cultural production of certain crops such as maize unsuitable. On the other hand, they represent the only settlements associated with large corrals. For example, Pampan I, the largest site of the en­tire surveyed region with dense architectural con­structions spreading over 15 ha, has a large corral measuring up to 70 m long and 50 m wide at the 
western edge of the settlement (Mantha 2004: 197). The economy at these sites thus ap­pears to have been largely based on agro­pastoralism, as opposed to simply farming for the Rapayan Valley as a whole. 
The shape and spatial organization of the house structures at San Jose, Pampan I, and Pam­pan II also present clear differences compared to those of Rapayan. I will refer to them as the Pam­pan House Type. While a rectangular plan and minimally two rooms characterize the Rapayan House Type, the Pampan House Type has a D­shaped or oval outline and no internal subdivi­sions. Moreover, many of Pampan house struc­tures are organized in groups around an enclosed patio (Figure 8), a type of spatial arrangement not found at Rapayan, where house structures are individually aligned on parallel terraces. Short walls separate one group of houses from another at Pampan. 
Despite differences in form and arrangement, the Pampan and Rapayan house structures nev­ertheless share the large wall cavities or niches presumably built to host the mummified bodies or bones of deceased family members. Nonethe­less, the wall cavities of the Pampan sites have a different morphology. As opposed to Rapayan house niches, constructed within the interior di­viding wall, those of Pampan surround the upper part of the single house wall (Figure 8; Supple­mental Figure 6). As a result, they tend to follow the oval contour of the structures. Most of the Pampan dwellings have at least four large wall cavities. 
The ruins of Huata extend on 6 ha and occupy a long ridge crest at an elevation of 3 ,800 m (Fig­ure 3). Large agricultural terraces are located to the south of the site, whereas a steep cliff forms the northern border of the settlement. The pres­ence of terraces and the absence of corrals in the vicinity ofHuata suggest that farming, as opposed to herding, was the main economic activity. The layout of Huata is typical of other Rapayan resi­dential settlements: multi-story buildings in the upper part, house structures in the middle, and small above-ground sepulchers in the lower part (see Mantha 2013:173, Figure 10.6). 
Huata displays the most morphologically di­verse house structures of the survey area. Two house types coexist in relatively equal proportion: the Rapayan and Pampan house types. Both of them exhibit their own respective architectural features and typical large wall niches. Yet, none of the Pampan house types at Huata are organized in groups around a common patio, as observed at Pampan I, Pampan II, and San Jose. Rather, they are individually aligned on long parallel terraces like those of other Rapayan residential settle­ments.

gitude as the settlements of Pampan I and II, Hu­ata and San Jose, and only 20 km south of the Rapayan village (Figure 3). At the conclusion of their survey, Elisabeth Bonnier and Catherine Rozenberg identified 81 sites with surface archi­tecture. Based on radiocarbon dating and detailed ceramic stratigraphy, these sites were all occupied during the LIP and LH. Among these, 42 settle­ments are classified as residential sites exhibiting house structures and tall multi-story structures (Supplemental Figure 2; Bonnier 1981; Bonnier and Rozenberg 1981; Bonnier et al. 1983; Rozen­berg 1982). 
Bonnier and Rozenberg describe fairly homo­geneous dwellings inside the enclosing walls of the residential settlements. Tantamayo house structures have no internal subdivisions and are rectangular or square in plan, measuring on av­erage5 m long by 4 m wide (Supplemental Figure 7). Their roofs were likely gabled because the opposing sustaining walls display a triangular shape. Finally, these structures do not contain any large niches within their walls. 
The Areas South of Rapayd.n and Tantamayo: Allauca Hud.nuco and Huama[{ 
To facilitate the description of areas located out­side of the Rapayan and Tantamayo regions, I will refer to the names of early historical ethnic groups (Figure 2) to designate the geographical zones under consideration. Nonetheless, the use of these names implies nothing about ethnicity, especially beyond the early colonial period. 
Daniel Morales describes a dozen sites mainly from the Huamalf area (Morales 1984). He pro­vides several beautiful illustrations of the LIP sur­face architectural features found in most settle­ments, including house structures and multi-story buildings. Houses are consistently described as circular with various circumferences. They were built mainly using the unworked stone pirka tech­nique. Most of them are also linked to a corral (or patio?) made with the pirka construction technique. 
Luis Salcedo (2012) has studied nearly 70 set­tlements both in the Huamalf and Allauca Huanuco areas, with a specific focus on the site of Garu (Figure 1). Most of the LIP and LH set­tlements he reports are residential sites con­structed on top of ridges between 3 ,400 and 4,300 m of altitude. Residential surface architecture also includes circular house structures varying from 4 to 9 m in diameter, as well as tall multi­story buildings (see also Bruhns 1994:323; Thompson 1968: 180-181). The roofs were like! y conical in shape and made of thatched material held by beams and a central pole (see also Morales 1984:88). Internal walls display several small niches, but no large wall cavities are re­ported. House structures also possess a patio de­limited by low walls. The former is either indi-

victual or shared with other house structures. Fi­nally, Thompson (1983:120-123) also briefly de­scribes a few residential sites constructed on the tops of ridges that consistently feature circular or oval house structures as well as multi-story buildings elsewhere in the Allauca Huanuco area. 
Southeast of Rapaydn and Tantamayo: Yacha, 
Quero, and Chupachu 
Northeast of Huamalf, Donald Thompson (1968:179, 1977:19; Morris and Thompson 1985:154-158) and Matos (1972) describe two settlements in Yacha territory (Figure 2): Wakan and Wagrin. They report rectangular house struc­tures roofed with flat stone slabs and grouped around a common patio. Most rectangular struc­tures were single-roomed, but a small number displayed more than one room. According to Matos, a few of them also exhibited large wall niches in which he recovered human skulls and long bones (Matos 1972:372). 
The Chupachu territory is also located southeast of Rapayan between the Maraii6n and Huallaga rivers in the surroundings of the city of Huanuco (Figure 2). Thompson investigated five Chupachu sites located east of Huanuco in the Pachitea province (lchu, Watuna, Quero, Paco, Warpo). House structures at these sites were organized around a common patio and displayed a square or rectangular plan. They measured on average 4.7 m wide by 5 m long and were surmounted by gabled roofs, presumably made of poles and grass. The unworked stone pirka technique was used (Morris and Thompson 1985:119-142; Thompson 1967, 1968:181, 1977:17, 1983:124--125). No large wall cavities inside houses are reported. 
Sue Grosboll conducted a survey immediately south and west of Huanuco in Chapachu and Quero territories, where she identified some 30 sites of fairly small size with surface architecture (Grosboll 1993). These settlements invariably ex­hibit single-roomed circular house structures or­ganized in patio groups and built with the pirka technique. The shape of these house structures conforms to those reported by Thompson (1967) at the Chupachu site of Aukimarka, east of the area surveyed by Grosboll. 
Finally, Matos visited another Quero site con­fusingly called Wamalli (1972:373-376). He de­scribes quadrangular house structures containing between two and six rooms, as well as circular house structures grouped around large corrals. Both types were constructed with the pirka method. They were not connected to patios and had no large funerary niches. 
Other Areas of the Upper Marafi6n 
The data available for assumed LIP and LH set­tlements in other Upper Marafi6n valleys are usu­ally vague and tentative, but some summary ar­chitectural descriptions are available. 
West of Rapayan: Pineo. Bebel Ibarra (2001, 2003) conducted a systematic survey in the Pineo area (Figures 1 and 2) on both sides of the Puchca River. He identified 44 LIP settlements in this area. As in many other regions during the LIP, the residential sites were constructed at high alti­tude, above 3,800 m. The dwellings are described as being circular structures varying from 4 to 5 min diameter and built with the pirka technique. It is not clear, however, whether they were erected individually or in patio groups. Noemi Castillo (2003) describes similar circular house structures at the site of Cerro Castillo near the municipality of Uco in the Puchca drainage (Figure 1 ), which represents the last stop to the west before reaching Rapayan. 
Northwest of Rapayan: Guari. With the ex­ception of Thompson's (1972:364-365, 1973: 119-120) description of three LIP/LH hill­top sites near the modern village of Llamellfn, little is known archaeologically about the area of the Guari (Figure 2). The settlements Thompson describes possess defensive walls, rectangular house structures built with the pirka technique, and gabled roofs. However, it is unclear whether the dwellings were built individually or grouped around a common patio. Orsini, who studied sev­eral LIP sites west of Llamellin, states that LIP house structures are best described as patio groups organized around large corrals (Orsini 2006: 158). 
Northeast of Rapayan: Huacrachuco. The Huacrachuco area is located about 20 km north of Rapayan on the eastern edge of the Marafi6n (Figure 2). Even though Huacrachuco covers a vast territory, it remains poorly studied. The best­known site in the area is Tinyash (Falcon and Dfaz 1998; Thompson and Ravines 1973), found near the modern village of Huacaybamba and no more than 25 km downstream from Rapayan (Fig-

ure I). The settlement occupies the puna at an altitude of 4,160 m. It contains several groups of house structures enclosed by high walls. The houses are rectangular in plan, have gabled roofs, and, like at Rapayan, they were built with the pachilla construction technique. Some of them have more than one room and several display in­ternal dividing walls. Many also possess rectan­gular small niches in their interior walls, but ap­parently no large wall cavities. 
Discussion: Houses, Funerary Practices, and Identity in the Upper Maraii6n 
As outlined at the beginning of this paper, ar­chaeological hypotheses regarding the cultural affiliation of the populations inhabiting the Upper Marafi6n during the LIP-be they Flornoy's and Bonnier and Rozenberg's "Tantamayo Culture" or Amat's "Alto Marafi6n Culture" -do not im­ply a political system of a given level of com­plexity. Rather, they involve shared archaeologi­cal traits, mainly the distribution of multi-story buildings, which would entail a common cultural identity among some populations of the Upper Marafi6n. 
While it is true that several collectivities of the Upper Marafi6n used multi-story buildings, these groups nevertheless differed significantly when house plans and construction techniques are compared. Houses in the Rapayan Valley are rectangular, multi-roomed, constructed with finely polished stones in the pachilla technique, and individually aligned on narrow terraces. They also have large wall niches to host the bones or the mummified bodies of the dead. Houses in Pineo, Allauca Huanuco/Humalf, and some areas of Chupachu are described as being single­roomed circular structures built with unworked natural stones in the pirka technique. In Yacha, the Chupachu of the Pachitea province, and Guari, most houses appear to be rectangular or square single-roomed structures organized in patio groups. At the Quero site of Wamalli, some dwellings are multi-roomed and rectangular, while others are circular. In both cases, they are constructed with the pirka technique. In Tanta­mayo, houses have a square plan and are orga­nized individually. Nonetheless, they possess only a single room. In Huacrachuco, dwellings are 
very similar to Rapayan. They are rectangular, built with the pachilla construction technique, and have more than one room with internal di­viding walls. Nonetheless, as opposed to Ra­payan, they do not contain large niches built to host the mummies or bones of deceased family members. In fact, none of the house structures of the Upper Marafi6n, except those in the Rapayan Valley, the area south of Rapayan (Pampan and Huata), and the Yacha sites of Wakan and Wagrin, display large funerary niches. Consequently, household members in most regions of the Upper Marafi6n do not appear to have shared their living space with their mummified dead. I believe that the observed differences in house morphology and funerary practices between the areas of the Upper Marafi6n reflect a constellation of different local identities. If this scenario is accurate, then a host of cultural groups would have occupied the Upper Marafi6n Drainage during the LIP and LH. In fact, cultural diversity during late prehis­panic times appears to have been even more im­portant than what early colonial documents imply. 
Despite similarities among Rapayan, Huata, San Jose, and Papam I and II in terms of house funerary practices (house wall niches), they differ considerably when house morphology is consid­ered (Figure 3). Significant differences exist be­tween houses at Rapayan and those at Pampan I, Pampan II, and San Jose to the south. Pampan and Rapayan house structures share the large wall cavities or niches presumably built to host the mummified bodies or bones of the deceased. But, the wall cavities at the Pampan sites have a dif­ferent morphology. In contrast to Rapayan, where house niches were constructed within the interior dividing wall, those at Pampan followed the upper part of the single oval house wall. The Pampan and the Rapayan people, despite their close geo­graphical proximity, clearly had different con­ceptions of what a house should be like. The ideal house at Rapayan was rectangular with minimally two rooms; the Pampan dwelling was D-shaped or oval and possessed a single room. The spatial organization of houses also differed in the two areas. The Rapayan dwellings were individually aligned on long and narrow horizontal terraces, whereas those at Pampan were organized in groups around a common patio. In sum, I believe that the form and organizational differences ob-

served between Rapayan and Pampan house structures reflected different cultural preferences and hence different regional collective identities. Nonetheless, future surveys to be held south of Pampan should clarify whether these regional differences were related to additional factors aside from identity. For example, the fact that the two groups occupied different ecological niches (quechua vs. puna) may suggest that they had distinct but complementary economies, such as those seen with the historically documented groups of Huari (cultivators) and Llacuaz (herders) (Duviols 1973; Orsini 2006; Parsons et al. 1997). 
The site of Huata (Figure 3), near Pampan, contained both Rapayan and Pampan house types. Nonetheless, the Pampan houses at Huata were not organized in groups around a common patio, as observed at Pampan I, Pampan II, and San Jose. Instead, they were constructed individually, aligned on long terraces like those of other Ra­payan residential settlements. The presence of Rapayan and Pampan house types may suggest that Huata was a bi-ethnic community, including families of both Rapayan and Pampan, and that close social and economic ties bound the two groups together at some point in time. Whether the bi-ethnic configuration at Huata is best ex­plained by the vertical archipelago model (Stanish 1992:43-45, 2005:229), by the particular social interactions between cultivators and herders (Du­viols 1973; Orsini 2006), by Inka governing strategies (Julien 1993:203-211), or by early Spanish administrative imperatives will require extensive excavations at Huata and Pampan in order to obtain a fine-grained chronology through radiocarbon dating. 
Conclusion 
In this paper, I have argued (following Stanish 1989) that house morphology, construction tech­nique, and the spatial distribution of dwellings in a settlement are a rather conservative dimension of culture and a good material indicator of identity. We have seen that the groups of the Upper Marafi6n are characterized by distinct ways of conceiving and building their houses. Nonetheless, the idea that domestic contexts are better material indicators of identity than funerary or ritual ones (contra Stanish) is contradicted by the evidence I have presented from the Rapayan Valley as well from the Pampan and Huata areas during the LIP and LH. In these regions, house structures were the locus not only of domestic activities but also of important rituals and unique funerary practices. In this context, the dwellings in the Rapayan and Pampan areas represent cases in which the as­sumption of a clear distinction between both do­mestic/ritual and household/funerary spaces can be misleading in the exploration of group identity. When considering simultaneously the ritual and domestic dimensions of house structures in the Upper Marafi6n during LIP/LH, it becomes ap­parent that identity varied tremendously from one area to the other. The Upper Marafi6n appears to have been peopled by a myriad of ethnic groups during the LIP/LH. I also suggest that archaeolo­gists should attempt to demonstrate the existence of ancestors and memorizing practices rather than simply assuming them a priori. Finally, archaeo­logical investigations in the Upper Marafi6n Drainage are extremely scarce and in their infancy. Future surveys and excavations will certainly be 
needed in order to better understand the domestic economy, political ties, ideology, and household organization of the groups living in this remote zone of the Andes during the latter periods of An­dean prehistory.
