LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 24, No. 2, 2013] 
and Randall have not fully reconciled Marx with Dar­win. They define monumentality as "historical practice," a definition in code, and write of monument building as "the social construction of memory" (p. 56). Action, intentions, past meanings, agents, and practice all met in dynamic balance on the Floridian shell heaps. With agen­tive possibilities ubiquitous as old shells, one reads dis­believingly that "triggering" events "necessitated" the action of mound-building (p. 57). In the end, Mother Nature overrode motivated, perspicacious Archaic agents in determining the timing of mound and plaza building and refurbishment. 
The major void in North America coverage is the absence of a chapter on Poverty Point, but David Ander­son glosses data for this monument and for the subse­quent Woodland earthworks in his chapter on Mississippian mounds. His chapter hardly fits the bill of "early monumentality," but he chronicles moundbuild­ing activities from Middle Archaic times through the Mississippian period. Also significant, Anderson deals with "monumentality" as appearance. Mississippian mounds draped with colored clays were a far cry from their current green golf-course grooming; the sites' ancient denizens would have experienced these places very differently than we do. 
Three Mesoamerica chapters deal with the early Olmec period (1500-850 B .C .) and another chapter with the Maya (ca. 900-200 B.C.). Francisco Estrada-Helli's chapter on Maya monument building at Holmul and Ci val in northern Guatemala contributes significantly to the early Maya story. He begins by divorcing Maya mat­ters from their broader historic context. Maya monu­ment building, he argues, should be understood as local practices of place-making rather than as inspired from elsewhere. The earliest building project at Cival was the most massive and lends support to his place-making argument, but not to his history. Estrada-Belli wants to restrict action and prevailing meanings to the local scene and not mess with six centuries of earlier moundbuild­ing in the neighboring Gulf Coast lowlands or three cen­turies of older buildings in adjacent Belize. 
The Olmec era chapters all disappoint in useful ways. Ann Cyphers and Judith Zurita-Noguera's chapter will become a classic, but not on monument building. Rather than confront the millions of cubic meters of dirt heaped up on the San Lorenzo plateau in fashioning the epony­mous city, or on the numerous stone sculptures, they attend instead to low earthen platforms (islotes) built in the seasonally inundated lowlands north of the site. These pre-city developments, they argue, led to private prop­erty (sensu John Locke) and established the economic foundation for spectacular achievements at San Lorenzo in the following centuries. Nothing less than a new expla­nation for the origins of Olmec civilization is proposed. The other two Olmec chapters appear in ENWM more as political reward than new case material. Louise Paradis summarizes data collected in western Mexico decades ago, with minor upgrades. Rosenswig's chapter on the Soconusco (coast of Chiapas, Mexico), in tum, demon­strates a penchant for subverting truth to preconception. Moundbuilding in the Soconusco, he avers, ramped up with maize agriculture about 1000 B.C. This becomes nominally true by redefining "agriculture" and "monu­mental architecture" narrowly to fit the specifics of his case. He categorically disqualifies moundbuilding dur­ing the preceding Archaic and Early Formative periods because "the platforms ... did not permanently transform the local landscape" (p.l 15). Nonsense. Archaic shell mounds are not even considered. The Mesoamerican story is that the famous Soconusco "shell middens" were delib­erately constructed platforms; they share critical con­struction features with shell platforms described by Sassaman, Randall, and others for the eastern USA. 
The non-Mesoamerica portion of Central America is represented by Jeffrey Frost and Jeffrey Quilter's descrip­tion of buildings and causeways at Guayabo de Turri­alba and Rivas-Pante6n de la Reina in Costa Rica, sites dating to about A.D. 700. Inclusion of this chapter in ENWM drives home the uneven advent of mound build­ing in the Americas, and within each region. ENWM focuses on early mounds but not on the related question of why some peoples did not take up moundbuilding. The critical distinction in evolutionary theory between analogous and homologous developments is not raised; ENWM privileges analogy. The editors note (p. 3) that cultural historians of yesteryear pursued diffusion (i.e., homology, common history), hoary questions now passe. Ignoring continental history in a professed attempt to understand its individual manifestations seems unwise. How can one understand moundbuilding as cultural prac­tice while ignoring possible cultural transmissions? 
ENWM cleaves South America along the continen­tal divide, with Anna Roosevelt and four co-authors inheriting everything east of the Andes and another eight authors vying for chunks of the Andes or Peruvian coast. Roosevelt et al. provide a macro-regional summary akin toAnderson's for North America. They canvas the vast territory of Amazonia from the earliest monumental activity up to the Classic period. Construction of shell mounds began with non-hierarchical societies over 7 ,000 years ago. Using data to test theory, the evidence coun­ters expectations: "If grand cultural achievements usu­ally attributed to state societies can indeed be made by societies organized in such nonstate ways, then evidence of the achievements should not be used as proxy evidence for prehistoric state organizations" (p. 259). A larger message from the same evidence is that "monuments" have served as surrogate indicators of other phenomena, such as complex society and full-time agriculture, rather than being studied in their own right.

Peru. The exception is Sergio Chavez's chapter on agri­cultural terraces in the Titicaca Basin, Bolivia. The ter­races and associated temples and stone sculptures there are relatively late in the sequence (800 B.C. toA.D. 300) and do not fit the theme of the book, even analogously. The chapter repeats the claim that people without cen­tralized leadership can build monumental things. The cases for South America cover four historically-linked developments from coastal Peru. The salient missing case is Real Alto (Valdivia culture) to the north in Ecuador. Preservation in coastal Peru is excellent, so the information for its early monuments is unusually rich. Haas and Creamer ruffle feathers by asserting in their opening line "that all monumental architecture requires leadership and centralized decision-making" (p. 289). That this is not dim-wittedness writ large is clear through­out their engaging essay, which they close with the dramatis personae: "the question of why people build monuments can only be understood from the perspec­tive of the motivations of leaders directing the building and the people doing the building" (p. 308). In-between these statements Haas and Creamer discuss the large stone cities in the Norte Chico region (which include Cara! Supe) built of quarried stone and faced with dressed stone blocks. Remarkably, the more than 30 large coeval sites (3000-1800 B .C.) appear as scattered singularities rather than as centers of regional polities with satellite sites. These earliest "cities" in Peru are mirror images of each other and remind one of Durkheim's postulated mechanical, segmented societies. Little wonder that sociopolitical implications of this earliest millennium of monumental architecture in Peru are contested. 
Thomas and Sheila Pozorski describe sites in the Casma Valley north of the Norte Chico region. Unlike earlier cities, the Casma Valley sites constituted a set­tlement hierarchy. Different buildings within sites served different functions indicative of a "polity that was united because of the diverse and vital functions of its compo­nent parts" (p. 373). SechfnAlto at 1800-1400 B.C. had the largest mound in the Americas, calculated attwo mil­lion cubic meters of fill. Specialized architecture at Sechfn Alto also included a royal residence with 118 columns, administrative buildings of multiple, stan­dardized small square rooms, and several large plazas. This massive and elaborate architecture was both a means of exercising power and a blatant symbol of it. The build­ings were "tangible evidence of the political power and conspicuous labor consumption that gave the Sechfn Alto polity elite elevated social status both within and outside the Casma Valley area" (p. 392). 
The chapter by Burger and Lucy Salazar on large U­shaped centers in the Lurin Valley (1800-800 B.C.) puts a different spin on estimates of construction fill and labor time. Relying on detailed stratigraphy first revealed in looters' pits, they document the incremental growth of a large structure and demonstrate that its labor increments were within the wherewithal of uncoerced local peoples. They argue that this theoretic possibility was the actual­ity and that the large structures are thus not evidence of centralized leadership or construction management. Cyphers and Zurita-Noguera make a similar argument for San Lorenzo: the "1,300 ,000 m3 of earthen fill" at this site was "well within work capacity of the early pop­ulation and thus a task that did not require centralized coordination" (pp. 138-139). The editors cite this argu­ment in the opening chapter and thereby make the min­imizing-the-monumental theme an underlying drumbeat throughout ENWM. Given their goal of exposing dubi­ous thinking, it is worth identifying such arguments as leaky logic. Occam's Razor aside, just because a monu­ment could have been constructed with few hands does not mean it was. Actual histories of construction as detected archaeologically should count more than hypo­thetical possibilities. 
Robert Benfer's essay on the early astronomical com­plex at Buena Vista in the Chill6n Valley (2200-1750 B.C.) is a monograph masquerading as an essay. Details on successive constructions of the Temple of the Fox, its orientations to the visible horizon, horizon markers, pari­etal art and iconography, and ethnohistoric and ethno­graphic information on constellations merit careful reading. Benfer's chapter comes closest to dealing with the metaphysical aspects of a building's monumentality. Postulated past and present perceptions of the Fox Tem­ple and its associated complex support his argument that the shrine was designed by astronomer-priests. Most authors in ENWM portray mounds more as congealed sweat than as cosmological apparatuses, so Benfer's chapter provides a welcome respite. 
As befitting his status, Hole gets the last chapter to muse about early and ostentatious monuments from the OldWorld and to calibrate American grandeur on a global scale. His inter-hemispherical comparisons presage the promise that there may well be an American pattern of early mound building after all.
