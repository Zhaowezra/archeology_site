Chapter5examinesde roleof saltintheexpansion of the Tarascan Empire. The author uses archae­ological, ethnohistorical, and ethnographic data to document the role of salt and other goods in trade and tribute.More than salt as anindividual product, it was the trade network controlled by the Tarascan Empire that contributedtoitsexpansion. This included the control of goods such as obsidian, metals, and turquoise, which were part of the strategic structure of thestate.Williamsoffers an estimate of saltcon­sumption in the core area of the Tarascan territory, demonstrating the need to import this product from remote areas. He argues that controlling this trade was fundamental for the expansion of the empire, more likely in combination with other goods. The last chapter offers conclusions and brie.y refers to comparative examples in China, Africa, and other areas in Mesoamerica. 
The subject of this book is interdisciplinary, integrating archaeological data, ethnographic work, andethnohistorical sources.Saltisa productofgreat importanceinancient times,asitwas usedto preserve foods to last for some time. Salt is found in speci.c locations andis notavailable everywhere, makingit an important tradeproductthroughout Mesoamerica.

Since the discovery of rich graves at Sipán on the north coast ofPeru inthe 1980s,the Moche(A.D. 100–800) have been the subject of ever-increasing attention. Although thisfascinatingstate societydevel­oped innovative forms of urban settlements, irriga­tion technologies,and political economies,itis most famousforits vibrantartistictradition,vividnarrative iconographies,and spectacularformsof ritual killing. SteveBourget’slatest book pursues this elite-centered tradition, building on the author’s long-term study of mortuary contexts and provocative re.ections on Moche artworks. 
Althoughits titlemayseemfamiliar,thisisalong­awaited book that weaves together many previously unpublished claims and arguments. Focusing on the central role of human sacri.ce in Moche religion and its close relation to warfare and the capture of prisoners, it offers a detailed account of Bourget’s .eldwork at Huaca de la Luna in the mid-1990s combinedwitha skillful analysisof Mocheimagery. Theiconographicinquiry zeroesinonthemesrelated to human sacri.ce and death as well as animals and plants that, according to Bourget, are indicative of El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) conditions. Expanding on arguments .rstdevelopedinhis Ph.D. dissertation on Moche “sacred bestiary and magical .ora,” Bourget views the north coast environment as a dynamic element in shaping sacred geographies, cosmologies,and rituals.He audaciously suggeststhat “ENSO provided an important template for Moche ideology and that the totality of the iconographical representations relating to the sea and most of those relatingtothe land couldbedirectly associated with El Niñoevents”(p. 196).Buildingona chronological (re)assessmentofkey scenes associated with Moche liturgical practices,the book concludesby offeringa working modelfor theevolutionofMoche rulership. 
Methodologically, the presentation bridges art history,semiotics, mortuaryarchaeology,zoology,and botany. Bourget’sdemonstration approaches animals and plants depicted in Moche iconography from anatomical, biological, and ethological standpoints. Borrowing from one of Isaac Newton’s famous quotes,Bourgetentersintodialogue with the “giants” of Moche scholarship, especially Christopher Donnan.As such,the bookis decidedlytailoredfor a specialized audience, with most ofits bibliography drawn fromMoche studies.Itis wellillustrated,and summary tables help the reader follow Bourget’s masterfulbut oftencircuitous tourde force.A useful index aids navigation, but a glossary would have helped non-Andeanist readers. 
After providing a review of relevant literature on north coastlandscape(chapter1),Bourgetsummarizes Moche political organization, ritual life, and asso­ciated imageries(chapter2). Theremainder ofthe book can be dividedintothree sections:(1) reporting excavation resultsat Plaza3AandPlatformII(Huaca dela Luna)(chapters 3–4);(2)analyzingiconographic evidence forENSOand its relationtosacri.cialprac­tices,death, diseases (chapter 5),and thededicatory offering of children(chapter6); and(3) synthesizing

chronological, mortuary, and iconographic data to delineatea modeloftheevolutionof ritual leadership in eliteMoche society(chapters 6–8). 
A large part of the excavation results have already been published, but Bourget provides more information on procedures and contexts, especially the stratigraphy at Plaza 3A. Photographs are plentiful and the stellar drawings by Jorge Sachún areparticularly helpful.In brief, morethan75 adult male warriors were ritually killed inside Plaza 3A during Phase IV (A.D. 400–700). Older men— hypothesized to be ritual executioners—were buried with adolescent retainers in the contiguous Platform II alongside liturgical tools, including a wooden club soaked in human blood. The sacred precinct was built over an ancient cemetery and children were buried as dedicatory offerings beneath it. Data from stratigraphic deposits are interpreted as indicative of alternate events of killing during rainy and dry episodesrelatedtowaxing andwaningENSOevents. 
Bourget’sfertile mind andexpert graspofMoche iconography areonfulldisplayin hisanalysisofthe plants andanimals disturbed, attracted,orhelpedby ENSOevents.Beyond theidenti.cation ofdifferent faunal taxa depicted in Moche art, Bourget remarks that ENSO creates deleterious conditions triggering infectious disease, especially leishmaniasis. Illustra­tionsvividlybridgethephysicaleffectsofthe parasitic infections and their depictions. Although Bourget’s demonstrationisconvincing,itis unclearwhyMoche artisansandritualists wereapparentlyso obsessedwith ENSO.Perhapsby Moche times coastal populations had become so entangled in irrigation farming and maritime activities that political and spiritual leaders found it useful to build legitimacy around growing concerns about theeffectsofENSO. 
The last two chapters will perhaps be the most provocativeand stimulatingfor Mochescholars. Bour­get, in an attempt to connect his iconographic anal­ysis with a model of political history, reviews elite mortuarycontexts.HesuggeststhatifMoche rulers were associated with the killing of human captives, changes in political structures must have triggered concomitant shifts in ritual practices and their repre­sentations.Throughthedatingand (re)assignmentof decorated objects and elite burial contexts to differ­entstylistic phases, Bourgetproposes three “stages” corresponding to (A) Phase III (Early Moche, A.D. 250–450);(B) PhaseIV(MiddleMoche,A.D. 400– 700);and(C)PhaseV(Late Moche).DuringStageA, images relatedtoWrinkleFace, MountainSacri.ce, and the Coca Ceremony were dominant, while the Sacri.ce Ceremony, including theWarrior Narrative andthe Battle of Animated Objects, appeared during Stage B. For Bourget the widespread depiction of images relatedtothe Sacri.ce Ceremonyatteststothe unity of “Moche stateideology” duringStage B. The iconographyof StageC,meanwhile,appears limited to theBurialTheme. 
While Bourget’s book will undoubtedly become a staple of Moche literature, it ultimately leaves the questions of why ritual violence and why ritual combatsomewhat unanswered.For instance, changes in Moche iconography are interpreted as indicative of transformations in political structures and a con­comitant need to re.neideological discourses. Bour­get points out the changing popularity and inferred authorityofcocatakers,warriors, ritual killers, temple attendants, andother actorsinincreasingly complex ritual narrativesand violentpractices.Still, onewon­ders why warriors and their ritual killing were at all of political importance in Moche times. Indeed, it remains unclearhowMoche structuresofgovernance developedorhow an ideologyof violence and human sacri.ce becamesodeeply entangled with rulership. Was warriorhood institutionalized during periods of real armedcon.ict? Couldthe ritual combatsbeways to commemoratethese ancient times?Was thespread of Mochereligious ideology relatedtothe capacityof elitesto nurture emotionalresponsestotheperceived omnipresence of violent acts and ritual combats akin to real armed con.icts? How were governance and legitimacy linked to shifts in political economies on the north coast? Bourget valiantly leads the way and positions himself in the debates about the nature of Moche warfare and the origins of prisoners, but Andeanists might have to look beyond elite burials and visual arts to reach more de.nitive answers. In any case, Bourget has to be praised for a very insightfulandmost welcome additiontoMocheartand archaeology.
