The discovery of the fully developed Formative sites of Cotocallao (ca. 3750-2350 cal. B.P.) in the Quito Basin and La Chimba (ca. 2650-1700 cal. B .P.) in the northern highlands of Ecuador has raised questions about their cultural antecedents, which have not been resolved despite decades of archaeological work in the region. Paleoenvironmental coring investigations were conducted at Lake San Pablo in northern highland Ecuador to determine the date for the onset of prehistoric maize 
farming in the temperate highland valleys of this region. The investigations included analysis of lake sediments for pollen, phytoliths, diatoms, and tephra. Maize pollen was identified as early as 4900 cal. B.P., while maize phytoliths dated even earlier, to 6200 or 6600 cal. B.P. These results demonstrate a long history of maize farming in valleys around Lake San Pablo, but in the context of a punctuated record of major and minor volcanic eruptions. It is concluded that early horticultural sites predating Cotocallao and La Chimba must exist, but to find such sites, archaeologists will have to locate and study deeply buried A-horizon soils. 
El descubrimiento en la sierra de! Ecuador de sitios completamente desarrollados del periodo Formativo coma Cotocollao (aproximadamente 3750 a 2350 cal. a.P.) y La Chimba (aproximadamente 2650 a 1700 cal. a.P.) en el valle de Quito yen la sierra norte, respectivamente, ha generado preguntas acerca de sus antecedentes culturales. Estas no han sido sin resueltas, aun con decadas de trabajos arqueologicos efectuados en la region. Se realizaron, por lo tanto, investigaciones paleoambientales en el Lago San Pablo de la sierra norte de! Ecuador, mediante la extraccion de nucleos de sedimentos, para determinar en qur! fechas se inicio el cultivo prehistorico del ma(z en los temp/ados val/es de esta region. Las investigaciones de sedimentos incluyeron el ancilisis de polen, de fitolitos, de diatomeas y de tefra. Se pudo identificar polen antiguo de ma{z en contextos 
fechados en 4900 cal. a.P., mientras que losfitolitos de la misma planta se ubican enfechas mas antiguas cercanas al 6200 o 6600 cal. a.P. Estos resultados demuestran una larga historia del cultivo de mafz en los valles que rodean al Lago San Pablo , aunque en el contexto de un registro esporcidico de erupciones volccinicas de mayor y menor escala . Se concluye que deben existir sitios hort(colas que preceden a Cotocollao ya La Chimba. Para hallar tales sitios, los arqueologos tendrcin que buscar e investigar horizontes A profundamente enterrados . 
he primary goal of the Lake San Pablo sistence base of indigenous societies in north­Tcoring study was to determine when agri­western South America, including the temperate culture, in particular maize (Zea mays L.) highland regions (Reichel-Dolmatoff 1961; Sa­cultivation, began in the inter-Andean valleys of lomon 1986). In the northern highlands of northern highland Ecuador (Figure 1).

stable isotope studies of human bones from ar­chaeological sites (Tykot et al. 2006: 193-194; Ubelaker et al. 1995), as well as the abundance of charred maize remains in archaeological mid­dens. Understanding the history of this cultigen, therefore, can potentially provide fundamental insight into northern Andean cultures, including the trajectory of population growth and culture change. Also of interest are the environmental and climatic contexts for early horticulture, es­pecially the frequency and intensity of volcanic eruptions and their effect on human settlement and horticulture. 
Recent genetic, molecular, and morphological data demonstrate that maize was domesticated from the wild grass Balsas teosinte (Zea mays ssp. parviglumis; Doebley 2004; Matsuoka et al. 2002; van Heerwaarden et al. 2011), which has a narrow distribution in southwestern Mexico cen­tering on the Balsas River Valley. Molecular dat­ing indicates that the transformation (i.e., domes­tication) of teosinte into Zea mays L. occurred

about 9,000 years ago (Doebley 2004:41; Mat­suoka et al. 2002:6083). The determination that maize derived from Balsas teosinte poses the dif­ficult question as to why a seemingly unproduc­tive plant with impenetrable seed cases that non­synchronously ripen and shed themselves from a minute ear, would have been subjected to human selective pressure. The details of the domestica­tion process are fascinating, although not yet completely understood (see especially Iltis 2006; Piperno et al. 2009; Piperno et al. 2015). 
Archaeological remains, along with starch grain and phytolith microfossil evidence, indicate that domesticated maize was present in the Balsas River Valley by 8990-8610 cal. B.P. (Piperno et al. 2009:5021; Ranere et al. 2009:5017). Follow-· ing domestication, maize spread from Mexico to Panama by about 7800-7900 cal. B.P., and to coastal Ecuador by about 8000 cal. B .P. (details of dating summarized in Piperno 2011 :S458­S459). Maize also reached the Colombian Andes by the eighth millennium (Piperno 201l:S458­S459). Even though the productivity of early maize would have been quite low, it was clearly an important resource for hunter-gatherers tran­sitioning to horticulture. Maize eventually became a dietary staple, or at least an important food re­source, for prehistoric peoples inhabiting a variety of environments throughout the New World. In­deed, maize has been called "the grain that civi­lized the New World" (Culotta 1991: 1792). 
Much progress has been made during the past several decades in tracing the early geographical spread of Zea mays along with the investigation of related issues (Staller et al. 2006). In the same vein, the present study aims to determine the chronology for the onset of maize cultivation in the fertile inter-Andean valleys of northern high­land Ecuador, using paleoenvironmental coring at Lake San Pablo in northern highland Ecuador (Figure 1). Located 3 km southeast of the small city of Otavalo at an elevation of 2,670 m asl, this 6.2 km2 lake has a catchment area of roughly I 45 km2• Most of this catchment lies below the elevation limit for agriculture (roughly 3,400 m as!) and is used for indigenous fixed-plot horti­culture on small land holdings with maize as the dominant crop. The lake reaches a maximum depth of 32 mas determined by a bottom depth transect across the lake (Athens et al. 2015:25). 
This region receives an average of 950 mm of rainfall each year, most of it falling between Oc­tober and April, which is the planting-growing season. As a result of the location of Lake San Pablo only 23 km north of the equator, there is little variation in mean monthly temperatures throughout the year, which range between a low of 13.2°C in June and July and a high of 14.3°C in May (Wernstedt 1961). Frost and freezes dur­ing the rainy season are infrequent except at higher elevations (Knapp 1988). Considering these characteristics, Lake San Pablo provided an ideal opportunity to investigate the history of horticulture in this highland area. 
An Archaeological Conundrum 
One of the underlying motivations for this study was the disconnect between the horticultural his­tories of the Ecuadorian coastal lowlands and the western Amazon region, on the one hand, and the highlands, on the other hand. For coastal Ecuador, especially as represented by the Las Ve­gas sites (Piperno and Pearsall 1998:183-199), the beginning of agriculture dates back to the end of the Pleistocene with domesticated squash (Cu­curbita ecuadorensis) dating to 11,750-10,220 cal. B.P., gourd and leren (Lagenaria siceraria and C alathea allouia) appearing between 11,060 and 10,220 cal. B.P., and maize by 8015-7945 cal. B.P. (Piperno 2011:S458; Piperno and Pearsall 1998:186, 197). Maize is also associated with the earliest phase of the subsequent Valdivia culture between about 6500 and 4000 cal. B.P., which is the earliest Early Formative cultural manifestation showing clear evidence for settled village life, a primarily agricultural subsistence base, and the use of pottery. As Pearsall (2002:51) observes, "maize is documented from the begin­ning of the Valdivia period ... and with root crop cultivation, supported the florescence and expan­sion of Valdivia culture" (see also Piperno and Pearsall 1998:244-256; Zarrillo et al. 2008)1• 
The evidence for maize in the above-cited studies is based on the identification of maize microfossils, including phytoliths, starch grains, and pollen, in well-dated deposits. Although some investigators have been reluctant to accept mi­crofossil data, advances in microfossil identifi­cation procedures leave no doubt about the effi-

cacy of such an approach (Holst et al. 2007; Pearsall 2000; Pearsall et al. 2003; Piperno et al. 2007; Piperno et al. 2009:5019-5022). The recent discovery of a 3 .1-cm maize husk with partially charred shank dating to 6775-6504 cal. B.P. from the Paredones site of northern coastal Peru now dispels any doubt about the very early presence of maize in northwestern South America (Grob­man et al. 2012:1756). 
Besides records from the coast, there is also evidence for early farming from the Lake Ayauch1 core in the Amazon lowlands of eastern Ecuador. Phytoliths indicate that maize was present "min­imally" as early as about 6000 cal. B .P. (Piperno 1990:672-673). Because sediments were not available for analysis for 29 cm below the deepest analyzed core samples that produced maize phy­toliths, maize may date even earlier. 
In contrast to lowland evidence for early agri­culture in Ecuador, the earliest archaeological site in the northern highlands is La Chimba, which dates to 2783-2517 (md median 2650) cal. 
= 
B.P., 2a, in its basal deposit (Zarrillo 2012:250; recalibrated with CALIB 7 .0.4 and SHCa113 data set). At 3,180 m asl, La Chimba contained abun­dant evidence of agriculture (Athens 1990, 1995; Pearsall 2003:234). Mention should also be made of limited early archaeological remains at the Im­11 site in Otavalo. Here a small number of ob­sidian flakes with scattered pieces of charcoal were found in a deeply buried A-horizon soil be­neath a thick volcanic ash deposit. The charcoal­dated to 3826-3410 cal. B.P., 2a, (CALIB 7.0.4 and SHCal13 data set); There was no evidence for agriculture or pottery (Athens 1999: 180-183). Although not part of what is generally referred to as the northern highlands, it is of interest that farther south in the Quito basin, substantial For­mative-period village deposits and features were documented at the Cotocollao site between about 3750 and 2350 cal. B.P. Like La Chimba, it in­cluded a suite of cultivars, such as maize and root crops (Zarrillo 2012:294-295, 310), attesting to horticultural village life by this time in the central highlands. 
Given the absence of archaeological evidence to the contrary, it appears that the central and northern highlands were largely ignored by agri­culturalists for some 3,000 years or more, despite a flourishing Early Formative culture on the Ecuadorian coast, and slightly later evidence for horticulture in the western Amazon region. Given the highly fertile inter-Andean valleys in this area, and to some extent an abundance of wild game as indicated by the La Chimba site (Stahl and Athens 2001), this apparent oversight by early horticulturalists is puzzling. Could environmental or adaptive factors have delayed the adoption of agriculture in the central and northern highlands? 
Concerning the environment, Hall and Mothes (1999:30, 2008:353-354; also Sauer 1965:269­27 4) note the presence of hardened cangagua de­posits throughout the highlands, which formed from volcanic ash during the dry, windy condi­tions of the Late Pleistocene. The nutrient-poor cangagua would have prevented the adoption of agriculture until A-horizon soils, a product of the gradual revegetation of the area, could form sometime after the onset of wetter and warmer conditions of the Holocene. These earliest A-hori­zon soils would have been repeatedly buried by periodic volcanic ash falls during the Holocene (Hall and Mothes 1994, 2008). 
This raises the question: Do buried A-horizon soils exist in the northern Andes of Ecuador that predate present archaeological evidence for agri­culture? The previously noted finding of early archaeological remains at the Im-11 site indicates the affirmative, and certainly there are other buried A-horizon soils (Hall and Mothes 1994). It is a question, however, that archaeologists have not explored in this area (but see examples dis­cussed by Isaacson and Zeidler 1999 for the mon­tafia region to the west). Given the amount of Holocene volcanism in the central and northern highlands, and the often massive accumulations of sediments in the valleys due to repeated tephra falls and hill-slope erosion, most early sites, if they exist, would be deeply buried. 
As to the botanical issue of whether it took time for tropical maize to become adapted to the cooler highland conditions before it could be grown productively, it may be noted that early domesticated maize was documented in a mid­elevation zone (964 m asl) in the Balsas River valley of Mexico (Piperno et al. 2009; Ranere et al. 2009:5015, 5017). Also, maize cobs dating to 6250 cal. B .P. were recovered from Guila Naquitz Cave in Oaxaca, Mexico, at 1,926 m asl (Piperno and Flannery 2001). Thus, maize was capable of

growing in highland areas from an early time. The temperate inter-Andean valleys of northern highland Ecuador should not have posed any cli­matic challenge to its cultivation. 
Lake San Pablo Core 
Two relatively short cores (Cores I and 2) were recovered from a near-shore location at Lake San Pablo in 1989, and two additional cores (Cores 3 and 4) were recovered in 1994 (Figure 1). The earlier cores were limited to depths of 4.99 and 
6.15 m below the lake bottom due to the restricted penetrating capability of the Livingston corer that was used. In 1994, a GeoCore was employed (Colinvaux et al. 1999), permitting 11.49 m of penetration below the lake bottom for the later two cores. Deeper penetration, despite vigorous hammering, was not possible due to an abrupt blockage of an undetermined nature. The block­age was perhaps caused by deposits of dome breccias from Huarmi lmbabura on the northeast side of the lake as a result of an eruption about 9250-8420 cal. B.P., 2o (Le Pennec et al. 2011: 126, 131). This event ejected more than 2.8 km3 of volcanic material, which presumably would have provided enough volume to cover the bottom of the lake.2 
The upper ca. 1 m of all of the cores consisted of soft, unconsolidated lake muck. Below the muck were lightly banded dark brown humic silt and silt loam sediments interspersed with tephra deposits. The tephras, which are labeled in the Core 4 profile (Figure 2), have a combined thick­ness of 2.55 m. Two archaeologically important tephra deposits were identified. These are the Pu­lulahua tephra (Tephra C), which is 47 cm thick, and the Cuicocha tephra (Tephra G), which is 15 cm thick. 
Age of the Lake San Pablo Core 
Fifteen radiocarbon determinations provide the basis for dating the core sequence (Table 1). Based on these determinations, both linear re­gression and linear interpolation models were used to determine the ages of all sampling inter­vals.3 Error ranges at two standard deviations were also calculated for each regression age sam­ple interval using clam software (Blaauw 2010) with the SHCal04 (southern hemisphere) calibra­tion curve. A depth-age graph shows the close correspondence between the regression and in­terpolation models, which is supported by a co­efficient of determination of r2 = .9816,p < .001 (Figure 3). The greatest divergence between the models is at the base of the core, with the regres­sion model suggesting a date of 6392-6138 (md 6266) cal. B.P, 2o, while the interpolation model indicates a date of 6772 cal. B .P. Although it is important to eventually resolve the discrepancy between the two models, especially at the base of the core, it is of minor concern for present purposes. 
To check the validity of the core date sequence, the ages of the Pululahua and Cuicocha tephras in the cores (Tephras C and G, respectively, in Figure 2) were compared with ages of these same tephra deposits obtained from geological expo­sures and archaeological sites. The core dates for the Pululahua tephra are 2290-2196 (md 2244), 2o, and 2299 cal. B.P. (regression and interpola­tion models, respectively). This compares to a geological date of 2305 ± 65 B .P. (Hall and Mothes 1994:51-53), which calibrates to 2432­2090 (md 2261) cal. B.P., 2o (CALIB 7.0.4 with SHCal13 data set). Based on a consideration of evidence from several studies, Isaacson and Zei­dler (1999:50) accept this as the most reliable of several dates for the Pululahua eruption. Both San Pablo dating models fit this independent dat­ing result well. 
As for the Cuicocha tephra, the core dates are 3527-3386 (md 3457), 2o, and 3345 cal. B.P. (re­gression and interpolation models, respectively), while the independently determined geological dates for this tephra deposit are 3819-2209, 3583­2856, and 3981-3411 cal. B.P., 2o (CALIB 7.0.4 with SHCal13 data set), which have median ranges of 3014, 3220, and 3696 years, respectively (Athens 1999:178; Hall and Mothes 1994:48-50). In addition, the previously noted buried A-horizon at the Im-11 site, which directly underlies a .75 to 
1.0 m thick layer of Cuicocha tephra, produced a date of 3826-3410 (md 3618) cal. B.P., 2o. This date suggests that the early part of the 3981-3411 cal. B .P. range of the geological date can be dis­counted. While the median ranges of the two other geological dates appear reasonable for dating the Cuicocha ash, the 3819-2209 (md 3014) cal. B.P.

determination should be discounted due to its ex­cessively broad probability range. This leaves the 3583-2856 (md 3220) and 3981-3411 (md 3696) dates as the most reasonable geological estimates for the Cuicocha ash, but with the early part of the 3981-3411 date range discounted, the median for this date drops to about 3600 cal B .P. In sum, the San Pablo Cuicocha dates align fairly well with the geological and archaeological dates, and could well be more accurate. The independent dating of both tephra deposits indicates that the San Pablo core chronology can be used with confidence.4
