The intellectual, artistic, and architectural accomplishments of Maya elites during the Classic period were extraordinary, and evidence of elite activities has preserved well in the archaeological record. A centuries-long research focus on elites has understandably fostered the view that they controlled the economy, politics, and religion of Maya civilization. While there has been significant progress in household archaeology, unfortunately the activities, decisions, and interactions of commoners generally preserve poorly in the archaeological record. Therefore, it has been challenging to understand the sociopolitical economy of commoners, and how it related-or did not relate-to elite authority. The exceptional volcanic preservation of the site ofCeren, El Salvador, provides a unique opportunity to explore the degree to which elites controlled or influenced commoner life. Was society organized in a top-down hierarchy in which elites controlled everything? Or did commoners have autonomy, and thus the authority to decide quotidian, seasonal, and annual issues within the village? Or was there a mixture of different loci of authority within the village and the region? Research at Ceren is beginning to shed some light on the sociopolitical economy within the community and in relation to elites in the Zapotitan valley. A domain in which there was considerable commoner-elite interaction in the Ceren area was the marketplace. Elites and their attached specialists provided products, and commoners decided which marketplace they would attend to exchange their items. Evidence from Ceren also suggests that there were numerous other domains of authority within the community that had no detectable control or influence from outside. For instance, people in the village decided what crafts or specialized agricultural products to produce as surplus to be exchanged within the community for different products from other households. Ceren 
community members acted independently as individuals, as households, or in other domains within the community. Under­standing the multiple layers of authority at Ceren sheds light on the sociopolitical organization in one non-elite Classic­period Maya community.

H
ow much did Maya elites control com­moner life in the Classic period? Some archaeologists believe in a purely top­down system in which elites controlled politics, religion, and the economy (Henderson 1997: 145). From this elite-centric perspective, subalterns were passive components of political and eco­nomic systems that provided the food and labor to keep society functioning. Until recently the focus of research has overwhelmingly been on elites and their impressive accomplishments in 
architecture, art, hieroglyphics, calendrics, and other domains, in part because traces of elite ac­tivities have preserved relatively well. Given the cosmological belief that elites were primarily re­sponsible for the overall fortunes of society, it is easy to envision authority in Maya society as a firm top-down command-and-control hierarchy. Nonetheless, as advances in household archaeol­ogy have shown, this model oversimplifies the complexities of ancient life (e.g., Lohse and Valdez 2004). The factors that made society func­tion on an everyday basis emerged from the de­cisions, activities, disputes, negotiations, and in­teractions of all levels of society. The preservation of the ancient Maya community of Ceren in El Salvador (Figure 1) affords the opportunity to in­vestigate domains typically obscured in the ar­chaeological record. The data from Ceren (Joya de Ceren in Spanish) allow for consideration of public and domestic structures, a variety of arti­facts found in situ, the organization of the built environment, activity areas, and a detailed ex­amination of agricultural production through well­preserved manioc (Manihot esculenta Crantz) and maize (Zea mays L.) fields (Dixon 2013). The locus of one key authority for this community was the non-royal governing body, probably con-

sisting of elders, which presumably met in an of­ficial capacity in Structure 3, a large council house located at the center of the village. The unusual preservation provided by the late-seventh-century eruption of the Loma Caldera volcano allows for more detailed understanding of decision-making in agriculture , the construction of a sac be (cause­way) , and other aspects of daily life. 
A key objective of recent research at Ceren is to explore to what degree , at what level , and from what source political control was asserted over households . Wilk and Rathje's (1982) conception of the household as the domestic co-residential group sharing the functions of production , shar­ing , redistribution , reproduction, and transmission works well when applied to evidence from Ceren. Were the domains of authority within and around the Ceren village and how were they interrelated with the economics of production, distribution, and consumption within the social matrix of the functioning community? The traditional binary model of political economy-elites vs . commoners-is applied , often usefully so , in many contexts of research and publication. Nonetheless, research at Ceren indicates that this model is normative and overly simplistic when compared to actual ancient life. Others have sug­gested that the binary model may mask multiple domains of authority (Chase and Chase 1996; Dixon 20 13; Joyce 2000 , 2004; McAnany 2010; Robin 2012). Dixon (2013:82) felicitously de­velops the concept of "sociopolitical economy." Following the work of Yaeger and Robin (2004), he argues that it would be wrong to artificially separate political from economic and social fac­tors at the community level. Issues and decisions at all levels were negotiated, and we believe that those negotiations occurred in multiple dis­cernible domains in and around the ancient vil­lage, and often in quite different manners. 
This article explores the archaeological evi­dence for the authority to make and act upon de­cisions in and around Ceren . We outline six dif­ferent domains of decision making and authority that existed within the community and other set­tlements in the Zapotitan valley. The domains range from the individual and the household to the community and the elites living in various large sites distributed throughout the valley. In recent years , research at the site has examined 
sociopolitical authority within the agricultural 
system of the community (Dixon 2013; Sheets , 
ed 2009; Sheets and Dixon 2011, 2013). 
This article presents an overview of research at the volcanically preserved site of Ceren and explores the six domains of authority in deci­sion-making by individuals , households , village elders , and elites. The recent discovery of a sacbe and associated canals provides a case study in which decisions were made at two levels of au­thority for construction and maintenance . Re­search at Ceren since 2007 has focused on agri­culture and on the sacbe, and both are highlighted here. Both agriculture and the sacbe with canals are examples of commoners operating within their own domains of authority, exercising considerable autonomy, and being capable of significant coor­dinated efforts at different scales without elite in­terference. 
The Natural and Cultural Contexts 
The southeastern ancient Maya region was densely populated in the centuries prior to the cataclysmic eruption of the Ilopango volcano. The eruption has been difficult to date accurately due to a long plateau in the radiocarbon calibra­tion curve. A reassessment of the dating has re­sulted in a two-sigma range of A.D. 410-535 (Dull et al. 2001). The eruption actually may have occurred in A.D. 535, triggering the vast climatic crisis that began in A.D. 536 that was so thor­oughly documented in historic records around the world (Gunn 2000) . Central El Salvador, in­cluding the Zapotitan valley where Ceren is lo­cated, was depopulated for a few decades after this event. As soils, flora, and fauna recovered, people repopulated uncontested vacant territory. The site of Ceren was founded by largely Maya immigrants colonizing the recovering landscape (Sheets 2009). The village was inhabited for a few decades before being buried by volcanic ash (tephra) from the nearby Loma Caldera volcanic vent, likely as late as cal A.D. 648-683 (one­sigma range; McKee 2007:83). The tephra was sufficiently moist and fine-grained to preserve structures , activity areas , artifacts , and the culti­vated landscape extraordinarily well. Although the agricultural plants of Ceren decomposed, the tephra preserved the impressions of individual

plants as voids, making it possible to create dental plaster casts so detailed as to record individual maize kernels. 
Earlier research at the site focused on exca­vating structures (Figure 2) that included the buildings of four households (Sheets 2002, 2006). A variety of public buildings also were excavated, including two overtly religious structures, one dedicated to village ceremonialism and feasting and the other to divination. Additionally, a large, domed sweat bath was excavated that also appears 
to have served as a communal building. The 
largest building excavated at the site, Structure 
3, had imposing architecture and very large 
benches in the front room that are interpreted as 
having had a political function. Community elders or a council would likely have gathered in this building to resolve disputes and to make major decisions affecting the community. These public structures would have worked to integrate the community in various domains of religious belief, economic activity, political governance, and so­cial functioning. Each public structure was found in association with particular households at the site, indicating a service relationship whereby specific households evidently were responsible 
for the upkeep of different public buildings. 
Because of the challenges in conserving and preserving earthen architecture in such a humid environment, research at Ceren has shifted away

from excavating structures and focused instead on agricultural production within the site center and south of the village (Sheets and Dixon 2011 , 2013; Sheets et al. 2012). A zone of sophisticated, intensive manioc cultivation was discovered some 200 m south of the village. Between that and the village was a zone of quite variable agricultural practices. 
Mayanists are often frustrated with under­standing ancient agricultural practices, including the plots of individual farmers and their various crops, methods of harvesting and distribution , and relationships with elites . The extraordinary agricultural data at Ceren provide insight into larger questions of sociopolitical organization and production in the Maya area. Webster (2002: 175) argued that the "greatest ignorance about Maya farmers concerns the ancient political economy," referring to how labor was organized , production distributed, decisions made, and relationships with higher authorities negotiated. Houston and Inomata (2009:240-249) wrestle with issues of agricultural authority and ownership and note that elite control over agriculture results in highly standardized and large-scale features , while household-controlled fields vary considerably. Regarding land tenure, they state that "landown­ership does not leave any clearly recognizable archaeological signature" (Houston and Inomata 2009:242). 
Research efforts directed at understanding the ancient agricultural political economy have gen­erally assumed a binary framework of elites and commoners. Many scholars view top-down power as permeating agricultural production and distri­bution (e.g., Adams and Jones 1981; Chase and Chase 1996; Henderson 1997; Marcus 1993; Scarborough et al. 2003) . Henderson (1997:145) states that "the direction of political and religious activity was firmly in the hands of the aristocracy" and that "the aristocracy dominated the entire economy." Other scholars view agriculture from the opposite direction by beginning with the farm­ers and emphasizing degrees of autonomy and self-sufficiency (e.g., Dixon 2013; Masson and Freidel 2002; Rice 1987; Robin 2012; Yaeger 2000) . The emergence of household archaeology has helped to dispel the exclusively top-down ap­proach , because scholars have focused on recon­structing and understanding the varied lives of people who occupied the basic level of sociopo­litical hierarchies (Lohse and Valdez 2004; Net­ting et al. 1984; Wilk and Ashmore 1988). Re­search in recent years at Ceren has focused on these issues and discovered that other significant domains of authority existed between the binary poles of elites and commoners. Social, political, and economic domains are inherently intercon­nected, yet often difficult to identify in the ar­chaeological record. The preservation at Ceren affords an opportunity to examine the interplay of these domains within one community and to provide insight into non-royal governance . 
The Domains of Sociopolitical Economy 
With careful analysis of architecture, artifacts, activity areas, gardens, fields, and the sacbe, we believe we have identified six domains of so­ciopolitical economy in and around Ceren.1 (1) The individual person is exemplified by specific activities . (2) Households constitute the second smallest unit discernible. They likely made in­tramural decisions that involved all economically active members. (3) Part-time craft specialists in a network of economic heterarchy (Crumley 1995) decided when and where to exchange their surplus items for the surplus items of another household, and then negotiated such exchanges. 
(4) Special-function public buildings required service relationships for their maintenance and functioning, and those were provided by nearby households . Negotiations surely ensued regularly with community members desiring the use of the buildings and the support of the household. (5) Political authority by village elders resolving dis­putes and establishing community projects em­anated from Structure 3. (6) Elites at an estimated dozen large centers in the Zapotitan valley made decisions regarding imported and specialist-pro­duced commodities, particularly which goods to make available for commoners in marketplaces. Villagers entering the marketplace with their goods or labor decided which market to attend, and negotiated specific exchanges within it. 
Each domain is explored below, with the evi­dence encountered from excavations and analyses. After discussing each domain of authority at the site and related evidence, the sacbe is then pre­sented as a case study illuminating how different

domains of authority influenced and participated in its construction, maintenance, and use. 
The Individual 
People made myriad decisions throughout their daily lives. While a variety of decisions were made in consultation with household members, family, and the community, many decisions were operationalized at the level of individual choices and actions. These included the overnight soaking of dry, stored maize for grinding, when to carry out that grinding with the metate on the floor of the kitchen, when to replace the obsidian pris­matic blade into its safe storage in the thatch roof over the doorway, when to plant and harvest, and when to wash the dirty dishes after the evening meal (Sheets 2006) . Such individual decisions and actions cannot be removed from their larger social, political, or economic contexts. For ex­ample, individuals at the site placed obsidian blades into the thatch to protect the edges of the blades, but also likely to keep them out of the reach of children. Ceren also affords evidence for small-scale production at an individual level . Painted gourds recovered from Household 2 were likely produced by a single person, given the seeming infrequency with which gourds were painted at the site and the fact that the painting materials, forms, and style were quite idiosyn­cratic within the village context. An additional example of the visibility of individual practices at Ceren is an unfired lump of clay with temper and the fingerprints of a mature person, along with a fired miniature pot with identical paste that had the diminutive fingerprints of its young maker (Zier 1983). Such evidence suggests that an adult had decided to instruct a child in ceramic manufacture. Typical archaeological preservation rarely allows for documentation of detailed evi­dence from everyday decisions and actions. 
Although much evidence might reflect indi­vidual actions and decisions in the archaeological record, it is difficult to discern whether individu­als or groups were responsible for the variation seen in agricultural production and decision-mak­ing in specific fields . These data are discussed as part of the household domain below, with an un­derstanding that many of these decisions and ac­tions were likely undertaken by individuals. 
The Household 
The second level of decision-making authority was the household, where communal activities were required. At this level, decisions were pre­sumably made by recognition of various issues concerning the household, with discussion, argu­mentation, dissension, conflict, and often con­sensus . Construction of each of the household buildings, the domicile, storehouse, and kitchen, would have probably engaged all able-bodied household members . The size of the sleeping benches in the interior rooms of domiciles, suffi­cient for only two adults, with children presum­ably sleeping on the adjacent floor, indicate that nuclear families were likely the norm (Sheets 2002). Priority for household authority rested with the parents, but was also likely complicated as children became economically productive and socially active. 
Aspects of agriculture may exemplify indi­vidual decision-making, but cannot be divorced from influences of household members or other aspects of their society. Deciding what to grow in a garden and how much time to devote to its upkeep would have involved consideration of the needs, activities, and commitments of other household members . Aspects of agricultural pro­duction likely engaged the entire household, with household members contributing to planting, har­vesting, and food processing. Additionally, evi­dence of variation in household decisions and agricultural practices was visible in gardens as well as agricultural fields . 
Ceren farmers exhibited considerable author­ity within their various agricultural fields, clas­sified into three zones. The first zone includes kitchen gardens, orchards, and fields adjacent to their residences. Farmers meticulously main­tained their kitchen gardens and maize fields sur­rounding households (Figure 3) in the village by aligning their well-constructed ridges with the dominant architectural orientation of the village, 30° east of north, or perpendicular to that (Sheets and Woodward 2002). It is likely that farmers were responding to social expectations of main­tenance and presentation of farming standards adjacent to households. Within this regional zone, farmers and their household members decided the variety of crops to plant near the house, as

well as whether and when to plant a second maize crop. 
Inside this near-household zone, kitchen gar­dens and orchards displayed significant diversity in taxonomic composition, spatial extent, level of organization, and intensity of investment (Lamb 2012). The variation of gardens and or­chards of different households at Ceren demon­strates the variety of decisions and strategies em­ployed by each household in the community. For example, Household 1 had five species grown in a highly organized kitchen garden, while House­hold 4 had nine species grown in a less intensively maintained garden. The majority of species grown by Household 4 were plants used for purposes other than consumption; a part-time agronomic specialization. The evidence for variation in agri­cultural production within the near-household zone suggests that individual household groups held the authority of decision-making concerning gardens, orchards, and adjacent milpas. 
The second area, called the Intermediate Agri­cultural Zone (Figure 2), is beyond the known Ceren households along the southern end of the central settlement area (Sheets and Dixon 201 1). 
This zone had a patchwork organization of fields with a variety of crops at different stages and with different styles of production. Variations in the styles and stages of fields, combined with clear field divisions, indicate different landowners or farmers, probably associated with different house­holds. In this region, farmers exhibited consider­able freedom to farm their maize plots in a manner of their own choosing (Dixon 2013). Some chose to use carefully constructed field ridges, as was done near households, while others chose to use simple mounds around individual maize clusters. One farmer performed no micro-topographic mod­ification at all (Lamb and Heindel 2011), and maize productivity suffered somewhat as a result. The distance between these fields and the households of individual farmers might have influenced deci­sions about field maintenance. Additionally, no formal harvest processing platforms have been identified in this zone, likely because of the close proximity of the fields to the central household area. 
The third zone, some 200 m south of the vil­lage, was dedicated primarily to intensive manioc cultivation (Figure 4; Dixon 2013; Sheets et al.

Figure 4. Elevated manioc planting beds sonth of Ceren. They are IO times the volume of maize ridges. Manioc had been re-planted here just before the Loma Caldera eruption. 
2012). Ceren is the first Maya site where intensive manioc production has been documented. The region has an average precipitation of 1,700 ± 300 mm (Sheets 2006:3), which is toward the wetter end of the edaphic range preferred by man­ioc (Rehm and Espig 1991). Here farmers decided to plant on slopes of 6-10°, presumably to en­hance drainage and thus facilitate manioc growth. Additionally, farmers constructed elevated plant­ing beds, loosening soil to facilitate tuber growth. Farmers selected different styles of manioc bed morphology, as some had curving profiles and others had flat sides and tops (Dixon 2011, 2013). Platforms on both sides of the manioc fields were cut-and-fill operations, making flat earthen sur­faces about 2-m wide, presumably for harvest processing. Dixon (2013) documented evidence of farmers deciding to shift from manioc to maize cultivation in some fields, and from manioc to fallowing in other extensive areas. The impor­tance of this zone, and the magnitude of product harvested at over 10 tons, is indicated by the labor investment of farmers to create and maintain formal planting beds. 
Preservation at Ceren is sufficient to conserve 
moderate-to large-sized weeds, yet none have been found in any of the excavated agricultural fields, indicating that weeding was performed regularly. Weeding is an arduous endeavor, par­ticularly for multiple fields, and was thus likely achieved through the coordinated efforts of many household members. A recent intensive flotation recovery program revealed the presence of nu­merous species of smaller weeds in some agri­cultural fields (Lentz and Slotten 2013). 
Evidence for household decision-making and authority in agricultural production can be inferred from the manioc fields. Entire households would have been involved in and affected by decisions of when and how to harvest manioc, as well as the processing required for manioc tubers once harvested. Manioc harvesting and tuber processing are arduous, labor-intensive activities that likely were undertaken by all able-bodied household members (Dixon 2013).The manioc fields discov­ered south of the site center (Dixon 2011) were harvested almost entirely at once, within about a week before the Loma Caldera eruption, judging from the freshness of the surfaces harvested during the rainy season. Manioc tubers spoil within a

few days of harvesting, thus a harvest of this scale would have necessitated organized labor to quickly exchange or process tubers into food, dried powder, glue, or a fermented beverage (Sheets et al. 2012). Planting the next crop in the re-shaped elevated beds and weeding also would have required considerable labor. The fields and gardens of Ceren , contextualized within the broader site layout and findings , indicate that farmers both maintained choice and autonomy in farming but also were embedded in broader com­munity-based social and political dynamics. The latter is evidenced by the coordination of harvest and the organization of field boundaries at the site (Dixon 2013), as well as intra-and inter-commu­nity exchanges of goods (Sheets 2000, 2002). 
Part-Time Craft Specialists and Economic Heterarchy within the Village 
Households chose to engage in part-time occupa­tional specialization to produce handcrafted goods in amounts beyond what they consumed, allowing them to negotiate exchanges with other house­holds. Decisions in this domain created a socio­economic network relating and interconnecting Ceren households , benefitting societal functioning but surely with tensions or conflicts. All of the households at Ceren that we have identified, and for which excavations have been sufficient, show evidence of economic specialization . 
Household 1 maintained the stone tools nec­essary for mano, metate, and donut-stone manu­facture (Sheets 2002, 2006) . Abundant cotton seeds (Gossypium hirsutum L.) have been dis­covered in many households , indicating that cot­ton was commonly grown (Lentz et al . 1996). Household I also had the largest collection of spindle whorls discovered at the site to date . They were likely used in cotton thread production . Ev­idently this household made more cotton thread than any other household, likely using surplus thread in inter-household trade. 
Household 2 painted hemispherical gourd bowls using a sophisticated paint inventory of varying hues of cinnabar stored in five miniature ceramic vessels (Beaubien and Beaudry-Corbett 2002: 172). Powdered limonite and a hematite cylinder provided yellow and red pigment, re­spectively. 
Household 4 was engaged in specialty crop 
production . Four plant species not found else­where at the site were identified in this household (Sheets 2006:78-88) . Of the four specialty species identified, agave (maguey) probably required the greatest effort (Figure 5), given that approxi­mately 70 agave plants grew in a swath to the south of the storage structure of the house . The species , Agave americana L., is useful mostly for fiber, and such a large number of plants could have supplied the entire village with cordage. Agave fibers were used to make two-ply twine and rope for internal use and exchange (remains of these were recovered at Ceren). The household also grew a thick plot of a fast-growing sturdy cane, to the northwest of the household, which was used for the vertical reinforcements in the wattle-and-daub walls of all household structures. There was enough of this cane growing to satisfy the needs of multiple households within the com­munity. Additionally, the large chili bushes (Cap­sicum annum L.), a perennial in the tropics, could have supplied chilies for most households . Fi­nally, cacao (Theobroma cacao L.) was found 
growing south of the building, and cacao seeds were stored in ceramic vessels in the building. An unusual amount of cotton seeds was stored in the household, and cotton seeds were ground on the metate. Both seeds and the oil from grinding could have been used for exchange . 
Clearly the specialization of each household demonstrates an active and interconnected ex­change system within the socioeconomic fabric of Ceren. The seasonality of production of many commodities must have created temporalities in exchanges. As some crafts may have been pro­duced more in the dry season, when less attention was paid to the agricultural fields , there would have been more of them to exchange . During the harvesting season , especially August through No­vember, surplus foodstuffs also would have been available for exchange. Thus there was a potential for creating debts , obligations , and webs of reci­procity that could have been sources of tension, as well as strategies for household and community relationships and adaptive efficiencies . 
Service Relationships 
The fourth domain of authority integrates service relationships of particular households within the social fabric of the community. Here decision-
