CONVERSION AND PERSISTENCE: 
ANALYSIS OF FAUNAL REMAINS FROM AN EARLY SPANISH 
COLONIAL DOCTRINAL SETTLEMENT IN HIGHLAND PERU 

Susan D. deFrance, Steven A. Wernke, and Ashley E. Sharpe 
Initial Spanishcolonization ofthe CentralAndesandeffortsto transform indigenous society werehighly dependent on localsocial and geographic conditions. In the Colca Valley of southern Peru, Franciscan friars established a series of doctrinas (settlements for the conversion and doctrinal instruction of the indigenous population) at former Inka imperial outpostsduring the mid­1540s. The inhabitants of one of these doctrinas—the site today known as Malata (ca. A.D. 1545–1573)—were subject to one of the earliest mendicant evangelical campaigns in the Central Andean highlands. In addition toreligious indoctrination and significant spatial reconfiguration of the village, Spaniards attempted to alter systems ofdomestic production related to the rearing and consumption of animals. They also imposed new tribute demands. Despiteconsiderable transformations of the architecture and attendant changes in daily life at Malata, zooarchaeological analysisof faunal remains from a variety of contexts provides no indication of the introduction of Eurasian animals to Malata northe alteration of either indigenous husbandry practices or the consumption of food animals. Ceramic iconography and theabundance of weaving tools suggest that Spaniards built on the local system of camelid husbandry to extract textiles andmetallurgical goods as tribute during the first generation of colonial occupation.

En el Valle del Colca, al sur de Perú, los frailesfranciscanos fundaron una serie de doctrinas (aldeas para la conversión e instrucción doctrinal de la población indígena) encentros imperiales incaicos durante mediados de la década de 1540.

entationincludedtheintroductionoffoodwaysfa­miliartothecolonistsandfacilitatedtheextraction of goods of value to Spaniards. These colonizingimpulses,however,encounteredtheexigenciesoflocal implementation and required significant re­sourcesandpersonnel.ImplementationofSpanishpolicies was also constrained by the diverse andchallenging geography of the CentralAndean re­gion. Similar to other areas of the SpanishAmer­icas(Deagan2003;Graham2011;seealsoThomas1991),theidealofconversionwasinevitablycom­promised through pastoral engagement with An­dean communities, as clergy variably sought toalignlocaltraditionswithCatholicism(Estenssoro2001; MacCormack 1991; Mills 1997).
ThispaperpresentsachronologicallycontrolledcasestudyfromthefirstgenerationaftertheSpan­ish invasion, when such processes were just be­ginning. We report on the faunal remains from anearlyhighlandFranciscan doctrina (settlementforthe conversion and instruction of the indigenouspopulation and administration of the sacra­ments)—a context in which Spanish attempts toalterlocal systemsofdomesticproduction relatedto the rearing of animals and their use are unde­tectable in the archaeological record.
The doctrina of Malata, established in the lo­cation of a small village and minor Inka imperialoutpost in the upper reaches of the Colca ValleyofsouthernhighlandPeru(Figure1),isanexampleof an early effort to establish a Spanish presencein the highlands in the early years of theViceroy­alty of Peru. The doctrina was likely establishedinthe1540s.Itwasoccupiedonlyuntiltheforcedresettlement of the population into a reducción (reduction) above the modern village of Tuti in1573 as part of the visita general (general tourand inspection) of the Viceroy Francisco deToledo. During its brief use life of about 30 yearsas a doctrina (ca.A.D. 1545–1573), its domestic,public, and ritual architecture, and the pathwayslinking the settlement together, weresignificantlyexpanded and altered (Wernke 2011, 2012). Newdomesticcompoundswereaddedtothedoctrina—apparently for those resettled from surroundingsettlements—sometime during this three­decadeperiod. These domestic compounds are readilydistinguishable from those established during theLate Horizon (A.D. 1450–1532). The former arecomposedofquadrangularprimarystructureswith architectural details diagnostic of colonial originand are generally placed either singly or with asingle outbuilding. They are concentrated in theeastern and western extremes of the site: to the east, they arearranged in rowsfacing one anotherin the manner of streets; to the west near thechapel, they are arranged singly next to walledpatios. Houses of Late Horizon origin at Malataare circular in floor plan and are arranged in mul­tiplesaroundcentralpatioareas(seeWernke2012,2013a).Theyare concentrated in the center ofthesite,nearthekallanka(greathall)anditsassociated plaza.
Together with the growth and spatial reconfig­urationofMalatathroughitsbriefoccupationdur­ing the early Spanish colonial era, its inhabitantsexperienced one of the first waves of religiousand political transformation in the CentralAndesalongwiththeimpositionofextractiveenterprises.Domestic spaceand materialculture were keyfo­rumsandmediainthemergingofSpanishcolonialpractices and preexisting indigenous forms of so­ciality (see Wernke 2012, 2013a).
Despite these considerable transformations inthe built environment and attendant changes indaily life, the zooarchaeological evidence from avariety of contexts in this doctrina is unambigu­ouslyconsistentwiththepersistenceofprehispanicindigenous domestic productive practices similartothosereportedforothermid­elevationandhigh­land sites dating to the Middle Horizon and laterperiods(e.g.,deFrance2014;Moseleyetal.2005;Rosenfeld2011;Vallières2012;Wing1988).Fau­nal assemblages from both domestic and admin­istrativecentersaredominatedbyindigenouslargemammals, particularly camelids. Typically, a di­versity of animal taxa is rare, although some highstatus sites contain evidence for the use of exotic,imported,orhuntedanimals(seedeFrance2014).The faunal assemblage from Malata contains noindicationoftheintroductionofEurasiananimals or alteration to indigenous husbandry practices oranimal food. Food animals and systems of hus­bandry do not appear to have changed during thisfirst generation after the Spanish invasion of theAndes,butanabundanceofweavingparaphernaliaincolonialdomesticcontextssuggeststhatSpanishdemandsforitemsofvalueresultedinanincrease in textile production during the colonial occupa­tion.

Analysis of the Malatafaunal assemblage provides some of the first evi­denceofthedifferentialdegreeofinfluenceSpan­ish colonization had over the traditional Andean animalmanagementpracticesinruralsettlements. 

Historical andArchaeological Context 
Malata is located at 3,850 m asl in the modernDistrict of Tuti in the Colca Valley of SouthernPeru (see Figure 1). The site is situated in the ter­ritoryoftheCollaguaethnicpolity.TheCollaguas,an Aymara­speaking people estimated to havenumberedbetween62,000and71,000individualsontheeveoftheSpanishinvasion(Cook1982:84–88), were internally divided between two large,ranked clan­like groups: the lower­ranking Lari­collaguasofthecentralColcaValleyandthehigherrankingYanquecollaguas of the central and upperreaches of the valley (Ulloa 1965 [1586]). MalatalaywithinYanquecollaguas,in atransitionalzonebetweenvalleyagricultureandthegrazinghabitatsthat support camelid (llama and alpaca) pastoral­ism.Thisareaofthevalley,whichroughlydividesthe upper section of the valley from the middleandloweragriculturalzonesofthevalley,ischar­acterizedbyirregulartopographyformedbyQua­ternary lava flows. The site occupies a shallowdraw in this hilly terrain, which is incised by thedeepgorgeoftheColcaRiver.Acanalthatcarrieswater from glacial sources high above the valleyfeeds a reservoir to the south of the settlement. Feeder canals exit this reservoir to irrigate sur­rounding valley bottom fields and small clustersof terraces on the steep slopes of the river gorge.
The climate of the Colca Valley, located in thewestern range of the southern Peruvian Andes, issemiarid, with marked wet and dry seasons. Sea­sonalrainfalloccursbetweenDecemberandMarch. Duringtheaustralwinter,thehabitatisarid,windy,andcold,withfrostspossibleanynight.Localwildfauna include mammals typical of the high­eleva­tion western slopes of the Andean mountains, in­cluding white­tailed deer, taruca deer, pumas, viz­cachas, and small rodents. The avifauna consistsof tinamous, parrots, and a variety of raptors (e.g., 
hawks, eagles, caracaras, falcons), including theAndeancondor.Alsopresentintheregionaresmallcolorfulbirdssuchastyrant­flycatchers,gianthum­mingbirds, buntings, and tanagers. Flamingos,ibises, and spoonbills occur near highland water­ways (see Meyer de Schauensee 1970). 
Inkaic Precursors 
Earlier investigations of local settlement patterns(Doutriaux 2004; Wernke 2003, 2006) revealedthat during the Late Horizon (A.D. 1450–1532)Inkaimperialoccupationwascharacterizedbytheconstructionofcentralceremonialprecinctsatex­tant settlements from the preceding Late Interme­diate period, and by the construction of at leastthree top tier administrative centers in a locallycentralized, but regionally decentralized, settle­mentpattern.Asinotherprovinces,Inkaimperialadministration was mediated by local elites andthrough commensal ritual, as evidenced by theubiquitouspresenceofgreathall(kallanka)struc­tures and associated plazas at former centers ofautonomousrule.SuchisthecaseatMalata,whereasmall,rusticallyexecutedkallankaandassociatedplaza are located in a prominent location over­looking the village from its western edge. Exca­vations in the kallanka produced significantlyhigher proportions of fine imperial serving waresthan domestic contexts (Wernke 2013b:121). Im­perial serving wares were likely used for hostingstate­sponsored commensal rituals (Coben 2006;Gasparini and Margolies 1980; Moore 1996;Wernke 2006). 
Text­Based Evidence of the Early FranciscanPresence among the Collaguas

sion among the Collaguas written in about 1585placethefirstFranciscansintheprovince40yearspreviously (ca. 1545).According to these memo­rials, the first small group of friars to enter theCollaguas Province was headed by Fray Juan deMonzónandaccompaniedbyFrayJuandeChávez(Tibesar 1953:65).
Franciscan ministrations in the CollaguasProvince expanded and formalized in the 1560s,as the friar Pedro de los Ríos was assigned to thevalley with four additional friars in 1560 (Tibesar1953:65–67).Newdoctrinaswereestablished,oldones were expanded, and convents were built inYanque in the central part of the valley, and inCallalliintheupperpartofthevalley(Cook2002,2007). The friars are also documented as havingbegun congregating households to their doctrinas(Echeverría y Morales 1952 [1804]). Given itssmall size relative to other Inka­era settlements andtheirsucceedingdoctrinas,itishighlyunlikelythat a friar actually resided at Malata. Instead, itwould have been periodically visited by one ortwoFranciscansforliturgicalservice,catecheticalinstruction,andsacramentation(Wernke2011:83–87). The friars apparently evangelized in an itin­erant fashion until after the establishment of the conventsinthe1560s,afterwhichtimethevisitingfriarsto Malatamost likely residedin theconventof Callalli in the upper part of the Colca Valley(Cook 2002; Tibesar 1953:65–67). 
Archaeological Indices of the EarlySpanish Presence 
Archaeologically,smallchapelsatsettlementswithInka installations are the earliest indices of the SpanishpresenceintheColcaValley(seeWernke2007a). During early evangelical encounters, thefriars took advantage of local Inka administrativearrangements,situatingtheirchapelsneartheInkaceremonial precincts discussed above (Wernke2007a, 2007b).At Malata, a small chapel was sit­uated near the kallanka and plaza on the higher,westernendofthevillage,affordingvisualpromi­nencerelative to the main residential area downs­lopetotheeast.Thechapelwasatfirstconstructedaloneonthenaturalhillslopewithfourstepslead­ingintoitsentry.Excavationsoftheentryrevealedthat the atrium surrounding the chapel was builtduring a subsequent episode, which buried thebottomtwostepsunderlevelingfillfortheatrium. 
The retaining wall for this atrium fill also formsone of the walls for an adjacent plaza. This plazais accessed through a single entry opposite thechapelentry.Acircularplatformforacentralcrossinthisplazaalignswiththeplazaentry,thechapelentry,andthedoorwayofalargestructurecenteredonthesouthsideoftheplaza.Thus,amoreformal,if rustically executed, atrium and central plazatypical of Spanish colonial urban plans was elab­orated during a discrete remodeling episode afterthe initial construction of the chapel (Wernke2011). GIS­based spatial network analysis deter­mined that movement through the doctrina wasalsoreorganizedduringthebriefperiodofMalataas a Spanish doctrina between the 1540s and1570s, as traffic was directed toward the chapeland associated plaza and away from the kallankaand its plaza (Wernke 2012).The remodeling andreorientation of the site, as well as the evidenceforthecongregationofhouseholdstoMalatadur­ingitsdoctrina­eraoccupation,areconsistentwiththehistoricallydocumentedscenarioofexpansionandformalizationofFranciscanevangelizationef­forts in the 1560s. 
In the mid­1570s, this mendicant­led doctrinasystemwassupersededbytheforcedresettlementprogram. These doctrinas were either convertedtoreduccióntownsorabandonedintheforcedre­settlement program known as the Reducción Ge­neraldeIndios (General ResettlementofIndians)of the viceroy Francisco deToledo. Under the au­thority of the visitador Lope de Suazo, the localpopulace was relocated to one of the reducciónvillages of the valley (Málaga 1974). Some doc­trinas became reducciones, while others, such asMalataandallnon­doctrinasettlementsintheagri­cultural zone of the valley, were forcibly aban­doned as their populations were relocated to re­ducción towns. The nearest and most likelyreducción to which the people of Malata resettledis Santa Cruz de Tuti, located 6 aerial km to thenorth. That reducción, today known as MawchuLlacta, lies in ruins above the modern village ofTuti and is the subject of ongoing research by thesecond author. 
Malata thus provides a chronologically con­trolled case for investigating daily and ritual lifeduring the transition from Inka to Spanish rule,through the first 30 years of Spanish colonial ad­ministration and religious indoctrination.

Materials and Methods 
Following mapping, survey, and test pit excava­tions in 2006, a two­season extensive excavationproject began in 2007. The primary intent of theproject was to understand the two­way process ofhowtheeverydaypracticesoftheSpanishcolonialdoctrina affected and were affected by existingInka administrative strategies and domestic prac­tices. Excavations focused on three contexts of interest:thechapel,primarilytounderstandchangeand continuity in the burial practices and demo­graphic makeup of the population; the Inka andSpanish public and ceremonial spaces, includingthe kallanka, plazas, and Spanish administrativestructures; and domestic patio groups.
Zooarchaeological analysis of faunal remainsrecovered from these contexts provides pertinentinformation regarding change and continuity be­tweenAndean and Spanish lifeways during earlycolonial interactions. Faunal remains recovered fromthechapelandcentralInkaandSpanishpub­licspacesareusedtodeterminetheextenttowhichnative animals continued to play a role in public,ceremonial practices, or were instead replaced byOldWorlddomesticates.Similarly,analysisofthecontents of domestic structures can examine how status­based variations in consumptive patternswere affected as Old World species were intro­duced intothelocaleconomy.Thefaunalremainsare also used to determine whether economic re­organization related to animal resources or prod­ucts occurred in conjunction with Spanish colo­nization.Thezooarchaeologicalanalysisindicatesthat animal use was very conservative, with noindicationoftheintroduction of Eurasiananimals totheregion,despitetheestablishmentofthedoc­trina. Products from camelid husbandry and localsystems of production continued through time.The faunal assemblage, which is dominated bycamelid remains, and the quantity of textile para­phernalia are interpreted as supporting evidencefor the Spanish­implemented intensification oftextile production to provide cloth as a form oftaxation. 
Faunal remains reported here are from 10 ex­cavated contexts, with a total of 300 m2 exposed,including public administrative buildings and space, domestic structures and associated kitchen/work areas, one tomb context, the likely quarters of the friar, and the Spanish colonialchapel and its approach (Figure 2). The quantityof animal remains varied significantly among thestructures. 
The excellent architectural preservation atMalata allowed researchers to address specificquestions about different building functions, ac­tivity areas, and domestic practices. Among do­mestic contexts, excavations were conducted in adomestic compound hypothesized to have func­tioned as the quarters of the visiting friar basedonitssize,location,andfeatures.Thefriary(Struc­ture 4) is the main building in this compound andis the largest domestic structure of the village. Itislocatedtotheimmediatenorthwestofthechapel,segregated from the main residential area of thesite. The structure has several diagnostic colonialarchitecturaldetails,includinganarchedwallnicheand an internal room at the south end. It is the only rectilinear domestic structure documentedwith an interior room division at Malata. 
Structure 8 is a chullpa (burial tower). A pre­hispaniccemeteryofsubterraneancollaredtombsis dispersed over the steep colluvial slope to thenorth of the main residential area. Structure 8 is one of a pair of circular chullpas situated on aterrace adjacent to the chapel at the western endof this cemetery. It was highly disturbed fromlooting and contained only a small quantity offaunal remains. 
The colonial chapel (Structure 10) is locatedin the higher, western end of the site, overlookingthe main residential sector. Excavations included nearlyalloftheinteriorandtheentranceway.Find­ingssuggestthatearlierarchitecturalfeatureswerenot present in this area. The plaza entry oppositethe chapel, and the doorway of a large building(Structure 15), are centered on its southern side.Given this configuration, Structure 15 was hy­pothesizedtohaveapublic,administrative,orcer­emonialfunctionakintoasimple cabildo building(townhall).ConsistentwiththefunctionofStruc­ture 15 as a public, administrative, or ceremonialbuilding,excavationsencompassingnearlyitsen­tire interior area revealed an extremely clean andhomogeneous packed­earth floor with very lowfaunalremainsandartifactdensities,althoughcol­lections included a small piece of silver filigree.

and its long fronting plaza, is located to the southof the plaza/atrium, which constitutes the publicand ritual core of the doctrina occupation of thesite. The kallanka continued to be used throughthe colonial occupation, as evidenced by the re­covery of caret head nails (diagnostic of the firsthalfofthesixteenthcentury)fromfloor­levelcon­texts (Wernke2013b:182). In the south endof thebuilding and surrounding a natural rock outcropis extensive evidence of burning events that tookplace through the use life of the structure.
Behindthekallankaisamedium­sizedbuilding(Structure21)ofrectangular­to­ovoidform,whichwas excavated to investigate its possible relation­ship with the kallanka. This relationship remainsambiguous, as intermixed Late Horizon and earlycolonial­era lead­glazed ceramic sherds were re­covered from a higher, colonial floor, which wassuperimposedonanearlierfloorofuncertaindate.Structure 21 is built on a high terrace that is intru­sive in relation to a circular house in front of it thatisprobablyLateHorizoninorigin.Thisterracewall blocks access to the original doorway of thehouse below; that doorway was closed off, and anewdoorwaywasbuiltontheoppositesideofthehouse.Therefore,Structure21postdatesthathouse,but its precise time frame of construction (prehis­panic or colonial) is unclear. The context presum­ably represents domestic residue and refuse. 
Immediately adjacent to the only entrance tothe colonial plaza is the second largest domesticstructure at the site: the large­sized, well­con­structed stone masonry house (Structure 26). It isfronted by the largest domestic patio space of thevillage.Access to the compound was restricted toasingleentranceoffthemainpathintothecolonialplaza,suchthatalltrafficgoingtotheplazawouldconverge in front of it.

Both structures, however,revealedcircularslabstonefeaturesontheirfloors. In the kuraka house, this table­like feature is lo­cated against the back wall, directly opposite thenarrowdoorway.Intheoutbuilding(Structure28),it was located in the southwest corner. Both were apparently used at least in part for weaving activ­ities, as discussed in the following section.
The eastern end of the residential area of the village constitutes a distinct neighborhood.

Zooarchaeological Methods 
The faunal analysis included material from boththe2007and2008excavations.Allmatriceswere field­sieved with both 1/4” (6.35 mm) and 1/16”
(1.8 mm) dry­screen meshes to recover small­sized remains.The majority ofthe faunalremainswere recovered from within structures and are in an excellent state of preservation.Analysis of thefaunal material was completed by the first authorat the Museo Contisuyo in Moquegua, using thevertebratefaunacomparativecollectionofthemu­seum. All faunal remains were identified to the most specific taxonomic level possible. Informa­tionregardingbutchering,burning,andothermod­ifications was recorded, as well as estimated ageat death (fusion). Dimensional measurements ofcomplete elements were taken to aid in distin­guishing llamas from alpacas.
The stratigraphy in all cases except for thechapel was very shallow. In cases without wallfall,floorsurfaceswerelessthanafewcentimetersbelow present surface, often in the center of thebuildings and slightly more along edges and cor­ners. In all but one case (Structure 21, the date ofconstructionofwhichisambiguous),thedomesticstructuresexcavatedwerebuiltduringthecolonialoccupationofMalata.Structure15,thelargenon­domestic building on the plaza, is clearly of colo­nialoriginaswell.Thestratigraphyinthekallankawas also shallow, with Inka and doctrina­era ma­terials intermixed. Therefore, due to the shallownatureofthedeposits,faunalmaterialwasanalyt­ically combined by structure.

Camelid remains dominate all of the assem­blages(SupplementalTable1).Dimensionalmea­surements of the first phalanx indicate that mostof the measurable first phalanges fall in the size­range of modern alpacas (n = 7) versus llamas (n = 3) (Figure 3). Many other elements comparedfavorably with a modern llama in terms of sizeand are identified as Lama sp., although some ofthese remains could be from alpacas (Vicugna pacos).All age classes of camelids are present atthe site ranging from newborns to aged adults(Figure 4). The presence of many specimens (42percent)fromadultorolderadultanimalssuggeststhatcamelidswererearedforrenewableproducts,such as fiber or dung, or for utilitarian purposes,such as for use as pack animals.
Ingeneral,speciesdiversitywasuniformlylowfor all contexts. Greater quantities of faunal re­mainswererecoveredfromstructuresthatspannedbothPrehispanicandHispanicperiods,asopposedtobuildingsconstructedandoccupiedonlyduringthe brief Spanish occupation. The kuraka kitchen/service house (Structure 28), the mediumhouse in the eastern neighborhood (Structure 55),and its associated workshop (Structure 57) hadsignificantly more faunal material than the otherstructures in terms of NISPand weight (seeTable2,SupplementalTable1).Inallcontexts,camelidsand large unidentified mammals represented themajority of material recovered. Additionally, themajority of modified bone (worked, polished, orcut) (Supplemental Table 2) was either camelidor large mammal. Non­camelid remains includeguineapiganda singleworkedantler fragmentofwhite­tailed deer. 
The kallanka (Structure 20) and the structurebehind it (Structure 21), which are believed tohave functioned as a meeting location during theInkaoccupationandlaterduringthebriefSpanishsettlement, had relatively few faunal remains(NISP= 31 and 20,respectively).The majorityofthesewerecamelidsandlargemammals,althoughremains from one guinea pig were found in thekallanka.

The large kuraka house (Structure 26) had fewremains (NISP = 48), nearly all of which werecamelidsandlargemammals.Itskitchen(Structure28)hadthelargestamountoffaunalmaterial(NISP =503)incomparisontotheotherexcavatedstruc­tures.Althoughthemajorityoftheseremains(98.6percent)camefromcamelidsand largemammals,two bird wing bones (coracoid and scapula) werefound, presumably from the same individual, aswellasanulnafragmentfromanunidentifiedcar­nivore and white­tailed deer remains.Almost half

The medium­sized house (Structure 55) andits workshop (Structure 57) were part of a singlepatiogroup.Althoughbothhadconsiderablymorefaunal remains than most of the other structures at the site, their assemblages consisted mainly ofcamelids and large mammals (94.6 percent and
95.1 percent of total NISP, respectively). Bothstructures contained the remains of at least one guinea pig and, in the case of the workshop, awhite­taileddeer.Theworkshophadahigherpro­portion of burned bones than did the house (35.6percentasopposedto13.5percent).Themedium­sized house had comparable proportions ofworked or polished bones and wichuñas with theworkshop, including two wichuñas and theworked antler tine (see Supplemental Table 2).Structure 55 also contained the only pathologicalcamelid specimens found at the site. The pairedfirst, second, and third hindfoot phalanges from asingle Lama sp. individual contained evidence ofosteophytes and pathological bony growth, par­ticularly on thelateral bone surfaces of one ofthefirst phalanges and one second phalanx (Supple­mentalTable4).Thecontextalsocontainsacom­plete right metatarsal with periostitis on the ante­rior and medial surfaces of the proximal quarterof the element.

Only camelid and unidentified mam­mal remains (mostly from large­boned, presum­ably camelids as well) were recovered from thechapel and atrium. Remains recovered from thelattercameexclusivelyfromthestairsandentranceto the chapel. Only the friary had evidence ofburned remains, most originating from a layer ofash (see Supplemental Table 3). 


Discussion and Conclusion 
The findings from Malata are significant for pro­viding the first view of daily life in an early doct­rinainthecentralAndeanhighlands.Itsbriefcolo­nialoccupation,truncatedbyabandonmentduringthe Reducción General de Indios, provides achronologically controlled window into domesticpracticesthroughInkaictimesandduringthefirstgenerationaftertheSpanishinvasionoftheAndes.

Theemergingpictureisoneofbothtransformationand persistence. On the one hand, it is apparentthat the friars sought to spatially reorient the vil­lage. Considerable evangelical resources werebrought to indoctrinate, through the constructionof a chapel, and to inculcate a Christian lifestylethrough manipulation of the built environment.Thechapelwasenclosedbyanatriumandfrontedby a plaza with central cross and administrativebuilding. A new neighborhood and new kinds ofdomestic compounds were constructed for newlycongregated families around an older, Inka­eraresidential core. Considering the early and rela­tively remote context of this small village, theseareextensiveandsignificantchangesdemonstrat­ing considerable mobilizations of labor.
Ontheotherhand,theanalysisofarchaeofaunaldata presented here clearly point to persistence ofindigenous domestic practices within the intimateinterior spaces of domestic structures, away fromthe prying eyes of the friar. Household productiveactivitiescontinuedtobecenteredoncamelidpas­toralism and weaving.The reasons for this persis­tence arelikelymultiple.First,Malatawasalmostcertainlyasecondarydoctrinainanetworkofdoc­trinas establishedbya small group of friarsatfor­mer centers of Inka administration throughout theColca Valley. It would have been visited only oc­casionally by a friar for doctrinal instruction andsacramentation.Second,duringthisearliestperiodof Spanish colonization, Eurasian domesticateswere still maladapted to the high elevation envi­ronment, especially by contrast with the ongoingoperation of the highly productive agro­pastoralsystems in place since before the Inka era.
Morebroadly,Malataprovidesaninitialsound­ing into the long process of adapting—in a sense,redomesticating—Eurasian domesticates to theverydifferentenvironmentalconditionsofthehighAndes.Very little is known about how, by whom,and over what time scales this occurred. Far from neo­European environmental regimes (sensuCrosby 1986) of more temperate areas of theAmericas, the high­elevation conditions of thecentral Andes posed significant challenges toplants and animals adapted to the conditions andpractices of the Old World. Malata is far fromunique in this regard; its remoteness, relative toprimarycentersofevangelizationandadministra­tion, and environmental setting are common to a largeswathofthepeasantpopulationofthecentralAndean highlands. In these areas, persistence ofmany aspects of domestic economic organizationmay be expected, relative to those regions moreamenable to initial colonization by Eurasian do­mesticates and nearer to Spanish centers, particu­larly those at lower elevations such as is found atSpanish colonial wineries (see deFrance 1993,1996) and at the sierra elevation reducción ofTorata Alta in southern Peru and the coastal re­ducción of Carrizales in the lower Zaña Valley(see deFrance 1993; Kennedy and Van Valken­burgh 2016).The low sierra colonial winery sitesshow the greatest range of Eurasian animals, in­cluding abundant remains of cow, pig, caprines(sheeporgoats),andchickens.The faunalassem­blagesatbothoftheselower­elevationreducciones(TorataAlta and Carrizales) show the adoption ofa much more limited range of Old World animalsof which pig and chicken are most common.
A distinctive pattern of animal use occurs attheextremehigh­elevationsettingsneartheminingcenterofPotosí(4,050masl)intheformerUpperPeru(modernBolivia).ThePotosíareaisauniquecase, since the massive silver mining operationstherecreatedhugedemandsforgoodsofallkinds.Sites associated with Spanish colonial residentsthere exhibited an ability to acquire meat fromEurasian animals (see deFrance 2003), indicatingtheeconomicabilitytoovercomegeographiccon­straints. Particularly abundant were remains ofcaprine and chickens. It is not known whetherthese animals were reared in high­elevation set­tingsoratlowerelevationsandacquiredinmarketsorthroughothermeans.RemainsoflocalcamelidswerealsofoundatSpanishcolonialsites,althoughmeat from nativeAndean animals may have beenconsumed by indigenous individuals (e.g., ser­vants, laborers) who also inhabited these sites.Seventeenth­centuryColonial­erasettlementsout­side of Potosí near the modern town of Porco in­habitedalmostexclusivelybyindigenousresidentsexhibitthemaintenanceoftraditionalAndeando­mesticpatternswithminorevidenceforintroducedfauna. Over 90 percent of the NISP of the faunalassemblage there is from local animals. Remainsof Eurasian animals include cow, caprines, equid(horse or burro), and chickens (see deFrance2012:15). Potosí and its environs were the eco­nomic hub of Spanish colonization in the Central

Andes,andtheminingcenterexertedmuchcontroloverexchangenetworks.EmulatingSpanishprac­tices presumably brought greater economic gainsfor indigenous peoples.
In contrast to other regions of Spanish colo­nizationintheCentralAndes,therangeofanimalsused at Malata is very conservative. There existsno evidence to suggest that either the indigenousinhabitants or the visiting friars consumed meatfrom introduced animals, or that non­native ani­malswereemployedforindustrialuses.Addition­ally,therearenosignificantdifferencesinthepor­tionsof camelidmeat thatwereconsumedamongthe different structures (Supplemental Table 5).The Friary context (Structure 4), presumably in­habitedbytheFranciscans,containedseveralnon­meaty head and foot portions with no evidencefor higher status or select meat cuts. Despite theconservativisminanimaluse,aspectsoftheartifactassemblage suggest that Spanish colonization ofMalata altered aspects of domestic production inregard to animal resources, and possibly animalhusbandry.
The abundance and distribution of weavingtools acrossthesitesuggestthat the productionoftextiles or cloth may have been mandated as atribute item during Inka times and continued as acolonial form of taxation. This interpretation isbasedontheoccurrenceofloompicks(wichuñas)(n = 8) and a probable carding tool (Table 3).Weaving implements occur in four of the struc­tures,includingthekurakakitchen,theworkshop, andboththemediumandlargehouses (Figures5,6, and 7). The majority of these are made fromthestraightandstronglowerlegbonesofcamelids(e.g., the metatarsal, metapodial, or tibia). Thisform of the loom pick has endured through time,and modern examples are identical to those fromthe past (see Figure 6 inset). This high­elevationsetting is highly conducive to camelid rearing.Camelid fiber transformed into cloth would have beenbothalocalnecessityduetothecoldclimateand a highly valued commodity.Although the as­semblage does not show a significant increase inweavingartifactsduringthecolonialera,thequan­tityofweavingimplementsisgreaterthanreportedforotherLateHorizon(Inka)sitesandearlycolo­nial contexts (e.g., Van Buren 1993). In additiontoweaving,thepresenceofabundantmineralpig­ments in Structure 57 suggests that ceramic pro­duction was possibly one of the activities carriedout in the workshop.
Besides fiber and cloth, camelids may haveplayed a significant economic role as a source ofdung for fuel, an interpretation supported by ce­ramic iconography. In high­elevation settings thescarcityoffuelwoodmakescameliddungahighlyvalued resource. In the precolonial past, duringthe Spanish colonial period, and in the present,dried camelid dung was used for ceramic produc­tion as well as for smelting and refining silver inthe mining region southwest of Potosí, Bolivia(seeSillar2000;VanBurenandCohen2010;Win­terhalder et al. 1974).

Dried camelid dung would have beenan ideal form of fuel for either of these. And be­cause domesticated camelids defecate in commu­nal piles, their dung is relatively easy to harvestand store for future use. 
Supportfor theinterpretationthatdungwasanimportant fuel source comes from five different ceramicvesselsrecoveredinthekallankathateach display painted images depicting defecatingcamelids (Figure 8). One of the vessels is a platewith an outer band of five defecating camelidsand an inner band of five flamingos. A secondplate contains a sole defecating camelid in thecenterofthevesselsurroundedbyabandofbirds.The motif is also present on the rim fragmentsfrom two other vessels and on a body sherd of afifthvessel.Defecatingcamelidsarenotanicono­graphic motif previously identified on either Inkaorcolonialceramics.Theselectionofthisbehavior

as a design element very strongly suggests thatthis activity was important for local economicends. If metallurgy and ceramic production werecommonduringtheInkaperiod,theproductsfromthese activities may also have become sources ofcolonialtaxation.Futureexcavationsatthereduc­ción of Santa Cruz de Tuti (Mawchu Llacta) willhelpelucidatethepossiblerangeofcolonialtributethat was exacted from the local community. Thefaunal remains, weaving artifacts, and unique ce­ramic motifs all found at Malata indicate that camelid pastoralism and their products continuedto be important for domestic and political eco­nomic activities. 
High in the Colca Valley, the Inka and earlySpanishcolonialsiteofMalataprovidesawindowon lifeways of an indigenous population at a crit­icalpointinAndeanhistory.AlthoughMalatawasneverasignificantnodeineitherInkaicorSpanishadministrative enterprises, archaeological inves­tigations and analysis of faunal remains indicatethat the economic and food habits of the inhabi­tants were focused on highland camelid herding,weaving, and possibly either ceramic productionor metallurgy. The establishment of the doctrinaand mandates by Franciscan friars significantlyalteredthephysicallandscapeofthesite;yetdailypractice, particularly the types of animals used,appearsnottohavechangedsignificantly.Incom­parisonto otherearly colonial centers, Malata ex­hibitsthemostconservativepatternofanimaluse.
Despite the fact that local indigenous animalscontinued to be used for food and other purposes,withnoevidencefortheestablishmentofEurasian animals at the site or in the region, nor any indica­tionthatthefriarsdemandedorwereprovidedwithhigherqualityportionsofthelocalanimals,thear­tifact assemblages related to both weaving andotheractivitiessuggestthatthecolonialerausheredin changes in economic organization. The inhabi­tants may have been required to provide camelidfiberandclothastribute.Theymayalsohaveuseddried camelid dung for the production of goodsthatrequiredheatingathightemperatures.DespitetheupheavaloftheSpanishconquestandthesocialturmoilthatensued,thehabitualaspectofdomesticpracticeandthegeographicconstraintsofthehigh­Andean environment likely worked in tandem toenablethepersistenceof themost intimateaspectsof daily life in this and many other places like it in earlycolonialtimes,evenifthescaleofproductionwas altered. The short­term occupation of Malatathus provides a first sounding into daily life that israrely available in archaeological settings. Thisstudy adds to our understanding of indigenous re­sponse to Spanish colonization.
