LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 7, No. 3, 1996] 
Principle No. 3: Commercialization 
The Society for American Archaeology has long recognized that the buying and selling of objects out of archaeological context is contributing to the destruction of the archaeological record on the American continents and around the world. The commercialization of archaeological objects­their use as commodities to be exploited for per­sonal enjoyment or profit-results in the destruction of archaeological sites and of contex­tual information that is essential to understanding the archaeological record. Archaeologists should therefore carefully weigh the benefits to scholar­ship of a project against the costs of potentially enhancing the commercial value of archaeologi­cal objects. Wherever possible, they should dis­courage, and should themselves avoid, activities that enhance the commercial value of archaeolog­ical objects, especially objects that are not curated in public institutions, or readily available for sci­entific study, public interpretation, and display. 
Principle No. 4: 
Public Education and Outreach 

Archaeologists should reach out to and participate in cooperative efforts with others interested in the archaeological record with the aim of improving the preservation, protection, and interpretation of the record. In particular, archaeologists should undertake to: (I) enlist public support for the stewardship of the archaeological record; (2) explain and promote the use of archaeological methods and techniques in understanding human behavior and culture; and (3) communicate archaeological interpretations of the past. Many publics exist for archaeology including students and teachers; Native Americans and other ethnic, religious, and cultural groups who find in the archaeological record important aspects of their cultural heritage; lawmakers and government offi­cials; reporters, journalists, and others involved in the media; and the general public. Archaeologists who are unable to undertake public education and outreach directly should encourage and support the efforts of others in these activities. 
Principle No. 5: Intellectual Property 
Intellectual property, as contained in the knowl­edge and documents created through the study of archaeological resources, is part of the archaeo­logical record. As such it should be treated in accord with the principles of stewardship rather than as a matter of personal possession. If there is a compelling reason, and no legal restrictions or strong countervailing interests, a researcher may have primary access to original materials and doc­uments for a limited and reasonable time, after which these materials and documents must be made available to others. 
Principle No. 6: 
Public Reporting and Publication 

Within a reasonable time, the knowledge archae­ologists gain from investigation of the archaeo­logical record must be presented in accessible form (through publication or other means) to as wide a range of interested publics as possible. The documents and materials on which publication and other forms of public reporting are based should be deposited in a suitable place for perma­nent safekeeping. An interest in preserving and protecting in situ archaeological sites must be taken into account when publishing and distribut­ing information about their nature and location. 
Principle No. 7: Records and Preservation 
Archaeologists should work actively for the preservation of, and long term access to, archaeo­logical collections, records, and reports. To this end, they should encourage colleagues, students, and others to make responsible use of collections, records, and reports in their research as one means of preserving the in situ archaeological record, and of increasing the care and attention given to that portion of the archaeological record that has been removed and incorporated into archaeological collections, records, and reports. 
Principle No. 8: Training and Resources 
Given the destructive nature of most archaeologi­cal investigations, archaeologists must ensure that they have adequate training, experience, facilities, and other support necessary to conduct any pro­gram of research they initiate in a manner consis­tent with the foregoing principles and contemporary standards of professional practice.
