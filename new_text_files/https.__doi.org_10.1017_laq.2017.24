LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 28, No. 3, 2017] 
Thetwo chaptersofpart4provide greaterregional perspective on the developmental sequence of ChetumalBay. HeatherMcKillop (chapter15) situates theregionwithin broaderpatternsofwaterborne trade along the Belizean coast, .nding that coastal trade in Chetumal Bay has a much longer history than in the Classic period ports of southern Belize. Finally, David Freidel eloquently synthesizes the work of all contributors in the context of his pioneering investigation of Cerro Maya in the 1970s. Looking at the broader region, Freidel argues that Chetumal Bay was always a crossroads, a cosmopolitan region heavily in.uencedby sociopoliticaldevelopmentsin centers outsidetheregion, whichledto dynamicshifts through time. From the beginning, settlers brought outside in.uences to the region, and although the sources of in.uence ebbed and .owed, the overall pattern is of a diverse, cosmopolitan population that was boundby coastaltransport. 
The volume will appeal to Mayanists working in otherregions andservesasan outstandingexampleof what can be gained by revisiting old data with new methodological and theoretical perspectives. It also shines light on an often overlooked region, detailing signi.cant and diverse life histories of the ancient Mayafar fromthe dominant centers.

In this volume, Alicia Perea, Ana Verde Casanova, and Andrés Gutiérrez present the results of a three-year project (2010–2013) focused on a detailed study of theQuimbayaTreasure, an impressive assemblage of 135 precolumbian goldartifactskeptinthe Museo de América in Madrid. These artifacts are part of a largegroupof pottery,textiles,gold,and lithicgrave goods looted in 1890 from two Quimbaya burials in the Department ofQuindío, Colombia; they were donatedtothe Kingdomof Spainby the Colombian Government in 1893. 
The aim of the project was to produce a holistic archaeological and archaeometric study, considering both the history and materiality of the assemblage to contribute to our understanding of the society that producedit.The materials, amongthe.nestexamples of Quimbaya goldwork, were studied by an inter­national team whose comprehensive work included technical, iconographic, and contextual aspects of the gold objects. Dating, bioanthropological studies, acoustic studies of musical instruments, and a broad discussionoftheQuimbaya cultureare also included in this volume. 
The book, written in Spanish, comprises three sectionsdividedintosixteen chapters,ending witha catalog of the assemblage and nicely illustrated with high-quality images.The .rst sectionisthe main body ofthebook.Itcoversfourdifferenttopics:abiography of theassemblage; manufacturingtechniques; archae­ological contextsandiconography;and analysisofthe musical instruments. Missingin this sectionisa good mapoftheregionwiththeplaces mentionedinthetext. 
The volume starts with a thorough biography of theassemblagebyAnaVerdeCasanova: the.rstnews of its looting, the acquisition of the materialsby the Colombian Government, and their donation to the Kingdom of Spain. The vicissitudes suffered during WWI and the connection with the rest of the grave goods from both burials are also documented. This chaptermakes clearthecomplexityof studying looted objects, which are usually encountered in museum collections,anddiscussesthe problemsoflostcontexts and contradictoryinformation. 
In the second chapter, Alicia Perea and Salvador Rovira present the manufacturing techniques iden­ti.ed in the assemblage. Using a range of analyti­cal methods—such asOM, XRF, PIXE,SEM-EDX, metallography, and X-ray radiography—the authors identifythe useof alluvial goldand goldalloysin the manufacture of the artifacts; different techniques of lost wax casting; and the application of hammering and depletion gilding for certain type of artifacts, among othertechniques.

In thefourth chapter, Mónica Gudemos analyzes the acoustics, materiality, and iconography of musi­cal instruments. Interestingly, the author identi.es common patterns in the typology of musical instru­ments from other areas, the Middle Cauca and Ecuador. The acoustic quality of the Quimbaya instruments appears to be superior, mainly due to their shapes, the alloys used, and manufacturing techniques. 
The second section of the book consists of eight succinctchapters, with thedetailsof each analytical technique applied and its results; these chapters are relevantforexpertsinthe analysisof metallic objects. Using a Bayesian model, radiocarbon and TL dates from bones and ceramic cores are given as well, suggesting that the grave goods were produced and deposited between AD 400 and 600. I particularly likedthelastchapter,where BeatrizRobledoandGon­zaloTrancho analyzesmall fragmentsofbone.They conclude that the cremation remains were human, determinethe temperature rangeofthecremation,and propose adietpro.le. 
The third section, composed of three chapters, gives a general view of the Quimbaya culture based on the study of Quimbaya metalwork and pottery.

In the book’sconclusion, bothtechnical andicono­graphic studies suggest that the treasure was most likelymadeina singleworkshop, probablyinvolving twoveryskillful artisans. Radiocarbon datesindicate that the interval between the manufacture and the depositionofthese gravegoodswasshort, perhaps one ortwogenerations,although thepresenceorabsence of usemarkson some objectssuggeststhatpartofthe assemblagewas made especially fortheburial. 
Inabookso focusedonthestudyofgold objects,it wouldhavebeen easytofallintoa largelydescriptive and technical routine. Nonetheless, Perea and col­leagues achieveacompletevolume that includesbroad aspectsof the backgroundof theQuimbaya culture andplaces thetreasurewithinaspeci.c context.How theQuimbaya goldwork.ts within othermetallurgical traditions in the same area is not, however, clear, especially when we take into account thedistribution oftheCalimaorYotocotraditions,whichoverlapinthe same regions (see Cardale, Calima and Malagana: Art and Archaeology in Southwestern Colombia, 2005). Onthis subject,itwouldbeinterestingfor futureworks to compare this assemblagewith othermaterials,such as the many studies of Colombian gold done at the Museodel OroinBogotá. 
As a whole, the volume is a great example of archaeological and archaeometric research, one that integrates various .elds within and beyond archaeology. The different disciplinary languages of thechaptersre.ect thisdiversity.Some chapters are easiertoread than others;some usecomplex concepts (for example, chapter 3) that may be dif.cult for a nonspecialist public to understand. Nevertheless, the topics coveredinthisworkallowreaderstofocus on theirown interests. Thebeautiful images will surely captivate the public, making it a prime example of archaeological research that re.ectsthe authors’ years of experience.
