SHIFTING STRATEGIES OF POLITICAL AUTHORITY IN THE 
MIDDLE THROUGH TERMINAL FORMATIVE POLITY OF 
CHIAPA DE CORZO, CHIAPAS, MEXICO 

Timothy D. Sullivan 
This study investigates changes in strategies of rulership at the early Zoque polity ofChiapa de Corzo, Chiapas, Mexico, from its inception in the Middle Formative period through its peak of political power during the Terminal Formative period. Incorporating data from my survey of Chiapa de Corzo and its hinterland with excavation data from the center, I contrast changes in the organization of ceremonial activity and in the establishment of status differences at the site with strategies employed in the governance of the polity at large. The initial rulers of Chiapa de Corzo adopted civic-ceremonial conventions shared with the Olmec site of La Venta, including the E-Group architectural pattern repeated at a number of sites in Chiapas. In the Late Formative, rulers integrated the E-Group into an architectural template adopted from contemporary capitals in the Maya Lowlands. This new space was less accessible than the earlier Middle Formative ceremonial zone. The adoption of these new traditions was accompanied by increased status differentiation between rulers and subjects. At the same time, 
there was a reduction in the elaboration of the regional political hierarchy and a decrease in the practice of forced resettlement. The results of this study indicate that the novel ceremonial practices and changes in status differentiation at the capital were accompanied unevenly by interference of rulers in the daily life of the hinterland. 
Este estudio investiga Los cambios en las estrategias de gobierno de la antigua sociedad zoque de Chiapa de Corzo, desde su formacion como capital en el periodo Formativo Medio hasta el auge mdximo de su poder durante el Formativo Tardfo. Para ello, se comparan los cambios evidentes en la organizacion de ceremonias y las divisiones sociales dentro de la capital, con las estrategias utilizadas para el gobierno de la sociedad en la region, a partir de los datos procedentes de la larga historia de excavaciones en Chiapa de Corzo y sus alrededores, as{ como de la informacion obtenida por medio de mi propio recono­
cimiento del area de sustento del sitio. Una estrategia central en el gobierno de Chiapa de Corzo, en todo lo largo de su ocupacion,fue el manejo de ceremonias agran escala. Sin embargo, la organizacion de estas ceremonias cambio con el tiempo; Los primeros gobernantes adoptaron la planificacion de/ Complejo de Conmemoracion Astronomica, un patron arquitectonico compartido con el centro olmeca de La Venta, Tabasco y con varios otros sitios de Chiapas. Por su parte, Los gobernantes de/ Formativo Tardfo incorporaron el Complejo de Conmemoracion Astronomica dentro de un patron que se adecuaba a las normas arquitectonicas importadas de las tierras bajas mayas. Las actividades desarrolladas dentro de este nuevo recinto ceremonial fueron menos visibles y menos accesibles al pueblo comun, que las realizadas en el viejo recinto. A su vez, la evidencia de la arquitectura residencial y Los entierros indica un aumento en la distancia entre rangos sociales. Con respecto a las estrategias de gobierno del pueblo de/ area de sustento, se presenta aqu{ la evidencia para la utilizacion de principalmente dos estrategias: el grado de imposicion de una jerarqu{a polftica y el grado de reubicacion forzada de la poblacion. La evidencia demuestra que los cambios en el grado de control sobre la poblacion de/ area de sustento no se corresponden ade­cuadamente con los cambios en la estructura del ritual y la separacion de los rangos sociales en la capital.

to provide ideological legitimization of leadership roles, but also helped to ensure cosmic balance and the survival of the community (Inomata and Tsukamoto 2014: 11-12). 
Ceremonies also facilitated the emergence of social inequality and the expansion of the power of rulers in other areas of social and economic life (Clark 2004; Hill and Clark 200 I :342; Inomata 2014:20; Inomata and Tsukamoto 2014:5). From the Middle to the Terminal Formative periods, ceremonies at Chiapa de Corzo shifted from rituals that were open to the public, and likely involved the participation of large numbers of commoners, to more exclusive rituals that were performed out­side of the view of the general population. This shift was accompanied by an increase in social inequality. Other strategies of governance waxed and waned, often in ways that are not immediately apparent from analyzing changes in the structure of ceremony at the center. 
In this paper, I explore changes in political strategies employed by rulers over the develop­ment of Chiapa de Corzo, from its foundation in the Middle Formative Dili phase (1000-750 B.C.) to what was arguably its peak of political power in the Terminal Formative Horcones phase (100 B.C.-A.D. 100). Within the capital I examine the following types of evidence: (1) changes in how rulers controlled ritual, religion, and ideology, as manifested in changing configurations of civic­ceremonial space; (2) status differences between rulers, lower tier elites, and commoners, as man­ifested in burials; and (3) the mobilization of labor into civic-ceremonial and elite residential architecture. These data are paired with the fol­lowing lines of evidence from the hinterlands: 
(1) 
strategies of governance employed by rulers; 

(2) 
the establishment of a political hierarchy, re­flected in architectural investment at hinterland sites; (3) the ability of hinterland leaders to attract

people into their settlements, reflected in the set­tlement hierarchy; and (4) the extent to which rulers at Chiapa de Corzo influenced the political structure of the hinterland, reflected in the degree of stability in the location and size of lower-tier political centers. 
To these ends, I employ data from the long history of excavations at Chiapa de Corzo (Agrinier 1964, 1975; Bachand et al. 2008; Bac­hand and Lowe 2011, 2012; Hicks and Rozaire 1960; Lee and Clark ca. 2015; Lowe 2013; Lowe 1962, 1964; Lowe and Agrinier 1960; Martinez and Lowe ca. 1989; Mason 1960a, 1960b; Tucker 1970), as well as my own survey data (Sullivan 2009, 2012, 2013) and data from previous surveys and excavations around the region (Lowe 1959; Navarrete 1959, 1960). 
The changing configurations of civic-ceremo­nial space at Chiapa de Corzo suggest that, during the Late and Terminal Formative occupation of the site, new ceremonial practices were added to those that carried over from the Middle Formative. A prominent feature of the ceremonial complex at Chiapa de Corzo throughout its existence as a major population center was an E-Group. E­Groups consist of an arrangement of a mound or radial pyramid facing across a plaza onto a roughly north-south oriented long mound to its east. The Middle Formative E-Group at Chiapa de Corzo formed the southern end of an extensive ceremo­nial complex in a template that John Clark and Richard Hansen (2004:4) have termed the Middle Formative Chiapas (MFC) pattern, discussed fur­ther below. During the Late Formative the Chiapa de Corzo E-Group was incorporated into a very distinct template that conforms closely to con­temporary E-Groups from the Maya Lowlands. Accompanying these new practices, burial data and the adoption of new architectural techniques suggest an increase in status distinctions between the elite and commoners, as well as changes in the relationship of rulers to their subjects (Sullivan 2009:254-281). Moreover, at the same time that status distinctions within the settlement were in­creasing, data suggest that the projection of polit­ical power into the hinterland declined, at least temporarily.

Methods 
The settlement data I incorporate in this study derive from my own controlled surface collec­tions from the 2005 survey of Chiapa de Corzo and its hinterland (Supplemental Text 1), with relative population estimates calculated from a slightly modified version of Drennan et al.'s (2003) Density Area Index (DAI), with estimates adjusted by phase length (DAI/C). A variety of baselines amenable to calculating relative popu­lation, along with population estimates for each phase, are presented in Table 1 (see Supplemental Text 2 for additional information). 
Following Sanders et al. (1979:55-56), vil­lages in this study are defined as settlements with populations estimated at 100 or more, and hamlets as settlements with populations of less than 100. Because collections from areas with ceramic den­sities that did not meet the threshold of .05 sherds

Volumetric and Labor Estimates 
From the Chiapa de Corzo excavation data cited above, I advance estimates for the volume of con­struction for each phase for structures within the ceremonial zone. Labor costs for construction ac­tivities are estimated primarily following the eth­noarchaeologically derived data provided by El­liot M. Abrams (Abrams 1994, 1998; Abrams and Bolland 1999). The specifics of this method­ology are discussed in Supplemental Text 3. The estimates of person-day costs for individual tasks are presented in Supplemental Table 1. Labor in­vestment estimates at Chiapa de Corzo by phase are presented in Table 2. 
Excavation data are lacking for all but one site in the part of the hinterland surveyed in 2005 (the latter a mound that had been bisected by a bulldozer cut). Correspondingly, at multi-com­ponent hinterland sites with architecture, I con­sider mounds as complete constructions for each phase represented in collections taken from the surface of mounds. Future excavations at hin­terland sites may consequently change the view presented below of the evolution of the political hierarchy. 
The Dili Phase (ca. 1000-750 B.C.) 
Current evidence suggests that the establishment of Chiapa de Corzo as a substantial village at the beginning of the Middle Formative Dili phase was quickly followed by the construction of the first stage of an extensive civic-ceremonial com­plex within the site (Figure 2; Bachand 2013:20; Bachand and Lowe 2011:76, 2012:Figure 7; Sul­livan 2009:97, 2012:36). This complex, consisting of the first stages of Mounds 11, 12, 13, and 36, measures approximately 570 m (from the south­ern face of Mound 36 to the southern end of Mound 12) by 95 m (from the eastern face of Mound 11 to the western face of Mound 13), with a total estimated area of around 54,000 m2 (Sullivan 2009:100; 2012:42). The Dili phase mounds were all relatively modest in size. Nonetheless, the dimensions of the space outlined by these structures are impressive. With these di­mensions, the plaza area could have contained a crowd of about 36,000.2 This area is larger than any contemporary plaza in the Chiapas Central Depression and almost double the size of the largest plaza documented in the Classic Maya lowlands by Takeshi Inomata (2006:811-818). It is worth considering that the Dili phase settlement of Chiapa de Corzo had an estimated population of just under 1, 100 people and was the capital of

a polity with an estimated 16,800 people (see Table l; Supplemental Text 3). These figures make it unlikely that this plaza was ever filled to capacity with spectators observing performances on the northern Mound 36. It is more likely that this space was used in processional rituals in­volving the participation of rulers and the active participation of subjects from the community or the polity at large. 
As Clark and Hansen (2001 :4) have pointed out, there are striking similarities between the di­mensions and layout of the civic-ceremonial precinct of Chiapa de Corzo and those of Com­plexes B, C, and D at the Olmec site of La Venta (see Supplemental Text 4 for a discussion of the role of La Venta as the progenitor of this pattern) and a number of other sites in the Chiapas Central Depression. Clark and Hansen (2001) refer to this as the Middle Formative Chiapas (MFC) pattern (Supplemental Text 5; Supplemental Figure I). 
The space to the southeast of the E-Group was an artificially modified swampy area or pond dur­ing the Dili and Escalera phases (Bachand et al. 2008:56, 77; Lowe 1962:56). In addition to util-

itarian functions of water storage, this feature may have served a symbolic role equivalent to that proposed for Group A at La Venta by F. Kent Reilly (1999). 
Based on evidence from other MFC com­plexes, Clark and Hansen (2001: 14) interpret the Mound 13 platform at Chiapa de Corzo (see Fig­ure 2) as an acropolis with elite residential func­tions. The location of elite residential structures on a platform adjacent to the civic-ceremonial zone would have created a precedent of setting the residents of this acropolis apart from com­moners. The proximity of this acropolis also would have established a close physical associa­tion of a group of elites with the ceremonies that took place in the plaza. 
Control over Labor and the Expression of Status Differentiation 
Dili phase civic-ceremonial buildings at Chiapa de Corzo have a total estimated volume of 13 ,450 m3, which results in an estimated labor investment of approximately 28,060 person-days for Mounds 11, 12, 13, and 36. This would have required 129 days with the labor of 20 percent of the estimated Dili phase population of the settlement. Given the seasonality of agricultural labor demands and the incremental construction sequences present in these mounds, it is likely that the labor de­mands involved in these constructions would not have imposed a great burden on the local popu­lation. Nonetheless, the construction of this civic­ceremonial zone would have established a new precedent of rulers commanding and coordinating the labor of greater numbers of people than had previously been seen in this part of the Central Depression. The expanse of the civic-ceremonial zone and its outlining structures would also have required a substantial amount of upkeep, creating a tradition of commoners providing labor to the political-religious authorities on a regular basis (McAnany 2004: I 57). 
Beyond the residential platform of Mound I 3, there is little in the Dili phase archaeological record that suggests a strong divide between rulers and commoners. Burials from the Dili phase are still rare; as of this writing, only five Dili phase burials have been recovered. Four of these burials show no evidence of elevated status (Agrinier 1964:9; Lowe and Agrinier 1960:54). One recently discovered late Dili/early Escalera phase burial at the base of Mound I 1 (Bachand et al. 2008: 113,118,140) was richly furnished but rela­tively modest compared to subsequent elite burials (Supplemental Text 6; Supplemental Tables 2-6). 
Political Organization in the Hinterland 
Survey data from Chiapa de Corzo and its hin­terland suggest that political organization in the hinterland changed in several ways. First, in spite of a 52 percent growth in population within the study area, all of the preexisting Jobo phase vil­lages that survived into the Dili phase decreased in population and site area. Outside of Chiapa de Corzo, none of the villages were as large or as populous as those of the previous phase (Figures 3a and 3b). Only three of the 14 Jobo phase set­tlements retained populations of over 100 into the Dili phase, but only one settlement was fully abandoned. This is a relatively high degree of continuity in settlement location compared to the transitions in subsequent phases discussed below. This relative stability in settlement suggests that the early rulers of Chiapa de Corzo did not inter­fere coercively in the preexisting political orga­nization of the hinterland, at least in the sense that these settlements were not completely de­populated or destroyed (Sullivan 2009: 104,121; 2012:38-40). 
Despite the growth of Chiapa de Corzo into a settlement with over four times the population of the next largest settlement, settlement within the survey area was on the whole more dispersed than in the previous Jobo phase; in the Dili phase, 49 percent of the total study area population was located in hamlets compared to 20 percent in the preceding Jobo phase. The change in the esti­mated number of people located in hamlets rela­tive to small villages is both significant Cx2

The decrease in village size and the dispersal of the hinterland population implies a reduction in the ability of leaders in hinterland villagers to attract or maintain supporters. The six second­tier Dili phase political centers (settlements with mounds) identified in the Chiapa de Corzo survey

area are all very modest in terms of architectural investment. The largest is estimated at 185 per­son-days of labor, or about 11.5 days with 20 percent of the mean estimated population of the local community. The scale of the architecture at these sites would be considered unremarkable elsewhere in Mesoamerica, and they are consid­ered second-tier political centers in this study only because of the scarcity of evidence for Dili phase architecture in the hinterland. The humble scale of these structures suggests that hinterland leaders had a very limited ability (or motivation) to mobilize labor into impressive residential or civic constructions. 
The Escalera Phase (750-500 B.C.) 
In the subsequent Escalera phase, the most no­table change in the organization of the civic-cer­emonial zone at Chiapa de Corzo was the con­struction of a 3.7-m-tall platform at Mound 17 (Figure 4; Lee and Clark ca. 2015). This platform has been interpreted by David Cheetham and Thomas Lee (2004:291) as an elite residential

structure. If Cheetham and Lee are correct in their interpretation, this development marks the move­ment of the residence of the ruler from the side­lines of the civic-ceremonial zone on Mound 13 into the direct center of the zone. The central po­sition of this structure within the civic-ceremonial zone suggests the association of its residents with the axis mundi, a position that in shamanic cos­mology served as a link between the celestial, terrestrial, and underworld realms (Reilly 1995:30). 
In Middle Formative Olmec iconography, rulers are frequently depicted as manifestations of the axis mundi, a position interpreted as a link between different levels of the cosmos (Reilly 1995:35; Reilly et al. 1994:7; Taube 1998:454). Although the layout of the Escalera phase civic ceremonial zone of Chiapa de Corzo does not explicitly represent the quincunx design common in Middle Formative iconography (but uncom­mon in architectural layouts), I suggest that the central placement of a royal residence and even­tually a royal tomb in Mound 17 was a spatial representation of the privileged position of rulers as intermediaries with the otherworld, a position that elevated their importance relative to other elites as well as to non-elite shamans who likely continued to practice in the hinterland. 
The twin 100-m-long platforms that extend to the south of Mound 17, also built in the Escalera phase (Lowe 1962:56), may have enclosed a ball court or an open-ended courtyard (Clark and Hansen 2001:7). In either case, the construction of these platforms created a more enclosed and intimate space than the earlier civic-ceremonial precinct. This space measures approximately 3,200 m2 and could have contained over 2,100 people, which is more than the entire Escalera phase population of Chiapa de Corzo, estimated at 1,450 (Sullivan 2009:143, 187). The flanking platforms appear to have been less than a meter tall above the surrounding plaza area (Lowe 1962:56), rendering whatever performances that took place within this space open to view from the outside. 
The first stage of Mound 7 was also con­structed during the Escalera phase, and this stage of the mound is notable in that it is oriented 7° east of north, deviating significantly from the predominant Chiapa de Corzo orientation of 28° east of true north (Lowe 1962:46) (see Figure 4). Clark and Hansen (2001 :24) suggest that Mound 7 was built as a royal acropolis, after the con­struction of the pyramid on Mound 13, but the evidence is still equivocal. No definitive super­structures have been identified in the Escalera phase stages of Mound 7, nor has a stairway fac­ing to the northern or eastern sides of the mound been documented yet in this phase. One stairway facing east onto the swampy area/reservoir was documented in the construction of Escalera phase Mound 7 (Lowe 1962:46). 
If the plaza defined by Mounds 7, 12, and 13 served as a seat of political and ceremonial ac­tivity at the settlement during the Escalera phase, then there may have been at least two concurrent seats of power at the site during the Escalera and Francesa phases: the Mound 17 residence and the Mound 13 acropolis. The latter would have shifted to Mound 7 with the Escalera phase con­struction of the Mound 13 pyramid (Clark and Hansen 2001:8). In any case, the unusual orien­tation of Escalera phase Mound 7, combined with its stairway facing onto the reservoir/swampy area, suggests that this structure had a different significance from other mounds in the civic­ceremonial zone. 
The reason for the unusual orientation of Mound 7 (see Figure 4) is not clear. It does not appear to correspond to the solar orientations of the E-Group (Blake 2013:Figure 8). Mound 7 may also have been constructed to create a visual and physical barrier between the main body of the settlement and the reservoir/swampy area to its southwest, thereby fortifying elite control over this resource. 
Control over Labor and the Expression of Status Differentiation 
Escalera phase leaders at Chiapa de Corzo appear to have been able to mobilize roughly an equiva­lent amount of labor into the construction of elite residential and civic-ceremonial buildings as their Dili phase predecessors. The total estimated vol­ume of Escalera phase constructions in the cere­monial zone is 13,954 m3. Labor investment in Escalera phase architecture at Chiapa de Corzo is estimated at 14,560 person-days. With a labor force of 20 percent of the estimated population, all of the new construction and expansion of

buildings in the civic-ceremonial zone could have been undertaken in SO days. 
Burial evidence for increasing social differ­entiation between subjects and rulers becomes more pronounced in the Escalera phase than in the Dili phase. To date, three of the 27 known Escalera phase burials are from tombs located in pyramids, and the principal individuals in these burials were richly furnished with burial goods (see Supplemental Text 6; Bachand and Lowe 20 11:81-82, 2012:S0-64; Clark 2000:SO; Lee and Clark ca. 201S). In contrast, members of the general population were buried in simple inter­ments with a more modest array of goods, gener­ally restricted to ceramic vessels (Supplemental Table 3; Supplemental Text 6). 
Political Organization in the Hinterland 
There is much greater evidence for a restructuring of political organization in the hinterland in the transition between the Dili and Escalera phases than the previous transition from Jobo to Dili. All of the Dili phase hinterland villages were ei­ther abandoned or reduced to hamlets in the Es­calera phase (Figure Sa). Chiapa de Corzo con­tinued to draw people in from the hinterland, growing 33 percent in population to an estimated 1,448 people, while the total population of the study area declined by 10 percent. The total num­ber of settlements in the study area decreased from 83 to 48. Outside of Chiapa de Corzo, the hinterland population became more clustered, with 76 percent of the Escalera phase population located in villages, compared to S 1 percent in the Dili phase. This change is both significant and strong Cx2 = 621; p < .001; V .2S), suggesting

that leaders at hinterland villages were more suc­cessful in attracting followers than their prede­cessors in the Dili phase. 
Given the current absence of information on building sequences in the hinterland, evidence more strongly suggests a three-tiered settlement hierarchy than a multi-tiered one in the Escalera phase. The population ofRibera Amatal, the largest Escalera phase hinterland settlement in the survey area, was just under half that of Chiapa de Corzo, and almost twice that of the next largest settlement (see Figure Sa). This contrasts with what was es­sentially a two-tiered settlement pattern during the Dili phase, where the largest hinterland settlement had approximately 2S percent the population of the capital (Supplemental Figure 2). 
The fact that none of the Escalera phase lower­tier political centers were occupied during the Dili phase also suggests a relatively high degree of political restructuring in the hinterland. Two of the four Escalera phase second-tier centers have architecture with an orientation that corre­sponds closely to the alignment of 28° east of north that is characteristic of architecture at Chi­apa de Corzo. This may represent stronger ties between hinterland leaders and the Chiapa de Corzo rulership during this phase (Sullivan 2007; 2009:1SO). 
Four of the five sites identified as Escalera phase second-tier centers on the basis of the as­sociation of ceramics with mounded architecture also have later occupations, making the attribution of these constructions to this phase tentative. If we attribute labor investment in architecture at Escalera phase hinterland sites entirely to this phase, then we have evidence for a three-tiered political hierarchy in the Chiapa de Corzo hin­terland. Labor investment into the three mounds at the site of Ribera Amata! totaled about 3 ,812 person-days (or 30 days with 20 percent of the local population), which is about 26 percent of the total estimated labor investment at Chiapa de Corzo. The next largest hinterland labor invest­ment is about l ,2S7 days, or 33 percent that of Ribera Amatal, and the three other lower-tier sites hover at slightly lower levels of labor investment. As with the Dili phase, per-capita labor demands for architecture would have been minimal, but probably regular, both in the hinterland and at the capital. 
The Francesa Phase (500-300 B.C.) 
During the Francesa phase, Chiapa de Corzo reached its peak Formative period population, es­timated at around 1,700 people. One significant development in the Francesa phase civic-cere­monial zone at Chiapa de Corzo was the conver­sion of the swampy area or reservoir to the south of the E-Group into a cemetery, in what would later become the Mound S plaza (Lowe 1964:68). The burials in this cemetery ranged from indi­viduals unaccompanied by burial goods to lav­ishly furnished burials with abundant marine
