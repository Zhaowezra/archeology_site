
FURTHER MATTERS OF GREAT MOMENT 
Barely able to tear yourself away from my last ramblings and actually have a look at the journal's scholarly content, were you? Even less able to contain your agitation at not being able to move directly to the next two-page effort, eh? Think how lucky you are, therefore, that events have allowed us to send the two sequent issues so close together! Now you have before your entranced eyes the remainder of my comments about the process of making Latin American Antiquity a fully going concern. 
SCOUTING 
When I formed an editorial committee for LAA, I intentionally selected scholars who represented a wide range both in interests and in area of residence. This was not because I wanted people who could provide solidly based manuscript reviews, but rather because I was attempting to distribute representatives of the journal as widely as possible. The committee members' principal services are intended to consist of finding suitable manuscripts and convincing colleagues that the journal is the best-some of us would say the onlyplace for their work. I thought I could at least extend the 
-
committee's work by covering the society's annual meeting and buttonholing prospective authors, but it turns out that other concerns make this impossible. At Anaheim, for example, Executive Board and other meetings gave me a total of just over two and one-half free hours between Wednesday and Sunday. Hence it is obvious that if we mean to make Latin American Antiquity fully represen­tative of Latin America, you, the readers, need to think of yourselves as extensions of the editorial committee. All of you who have published articles in the journal, or simply have its best interests at heart, need to keep your eyes peeled for good work by your colleagues, and to try to ensure that the work makes its way onto LAA's pages. You won't receive any merit badges for the effort, but you will have the reward of seeing the best writing on Latin American archaeology every time you open the journal's covers-and get past the editorial. 
PASSING IN REVIEW 
Academics are well known for taking on tasks that eat tremendous amounts of time and net them nothing tangible at all. We all take this sort of altruism for granted, but at least in most cases we see a small reward when such burden-bearing ends up as a line in a c. v. The absence of even so small a reward as this makes the willingness of reviewers to peruse manuscripts submitted to Latin American Antiquity all the more admirable. What I have come to admire, however, is not just that willingness, but the dedication that almost all reviewers bring to what is undeniably an onerous task. I have yet to see a truly mean-spirited attack on anyone's writing, and in virtually every case I am able to say with clear conscience to an author that the reviews will be of very considerable help in making revisions. Perhaps the fact that so many of our colleagues devote so much time and intellectual energy to reviewing does not surprise you, but I confess to having been very pleasantly surprised on countless occasions. We routinely receive the reviews and communicate their contents to authors, but I cannot find time to write letters of thanks to the reviewers. This paragraph is my way of saying how much we appreciate the work you have done, and clearly are willing to continue to do, to make LAA the best journal it can be.

LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. s, No. 4, 1994) 
ON THE EPIGRAPH 
-No, not a terse, witty statement, and not a paean of praise on a headstone, either. The subject of this section is "a motto or quotation at the beginning of a book, chapter, etc." (Oxford English Dictionary, 1st ed., 1888). Most North Americans think of epigraphs as particularly British; witness Eric Thompson's chapter headings in The Rise and Fall of Maya Civilization (2nd ed., 1967). A member of the LAA editorial committee-see if you can identify the individual in the list on the inside cover-has asked, however, that journal contributors (whose British heritage, if any, is gen­erally several generations removed) consider introducing their work with appropriate quotations from sources that meet two main criteria: first, they must not be archaeological or anthropological; second, they must be more than 75 years old. If you want to try enhancing your manuscript with an epigraph, I suggest that you begin your search in the literature of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, where an abundance of wonderful bits of prose applicable to archaeology can be found. This is one of my favorites: "instead of Old and Laudable Methods, there hath been introduced Novel and Troublesome Inventions, which have, and do nothing, but make a dust and smoak about business and perturb, disquiet, and cloy the Affair, and perplex all that serve in it." -a strikingly appropriate comment on various innovations in our discipline and in life in general, I think you'll agree. The citation is, however, even more striking; the words are from the preface to Naval Speculations and Maritime Politicks; Being A Modest and Brief Discourse of the Royal Navy of 
England: Of Its Oeconomy and Government, and A Projection for an everlasting Seminary of Seamen, by a Royal Maritime Hospital. With A Project for a Royal Fishery. Also Necessary Measures in the present War with France, &c, by H. Maydman. William Bonny, London, 1691. 
BIBLIOLATRY 
As you can undoubtedly judge from the heading's Greek roots, this section deals with book worship, a very common phenomenon in our discipline and in academe in general. I mention this not because I believe that the importance of books is diminishing, as some argue, and hence am readying myself for the time when we shall be casting our eyes upward to the last mouldering examples in some hermetically sealed container. My concern is, instead, that the focus on The Book as the goal of every symposium (indeed, almost every paper at times) often robs journals of work for which they would serve as an ideal outlet. Sometimes the striving for the SOB (no, Significantly Overwhelming Book) causes symposium organizer/editors to hold onto potential chapters long past the end of their shelf lives. But, more often, even when the book itself makes a reasonably timely appearance, it then turns out to have a long life on the shelf because its cost limits distribution, and hence its recognition and use. Journals, in contrast, offer wide distribution, sometimes timelier appearance, and the potential of continued recognition and use. I guess it's the hard covers that make books so appealing, when journal publication is often as desirable, if not more so. The next time you are faced with the choice between a book chapter and a journal article I urge you to think of Latin American Antiquity, and also to consider the true story of a recent promotion proceeding in which books and book chapters were disallowed, and only peer-reviewed journal articles were considered proof of scholarly achievement. That's an unbelievable academic aberration, I know, but perhaps there's a message in it nonetheless.
