
AN ETHNOARCHAEOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVE ON GROUND STONE 
PRODUCTION AT THE SANTIAGO QUARRY IN THE CASAS 
GRANDES REGION OF CHIHUAHUA, MEXICO 

Michael T. Searcy and Todd Pitezel 
Researchers have noted and studied the .nely formed manos and metates of the Casas Grandes region of northern Mexico, but little is known about how and where they were produced. During a survey project in 2013, we located a quarry, the .rst discovered in this region, where grinding stones were manufactured using a suite of stone tools. We report the morphology of the site, the tool kit of the metateros (metate makers), and ethnoarchaeological implications resulting from the study of modern metateros that can aid in the interpretation of prehistoric ground stone quarries. 
Las manos y metates .namente trabajados de la región de Casas Grandes en el norte de México han sido observados y estudiados, pero poco se sabe sobre su manera y lugar de producción. Durante un proyecto de reconocimiento en 2013 localizamos una cantera, la primera descubierta en esta región, donde las piedras de moler de basalto vesicular fueron fabricadas usando un conjunto de herramientas de piedra. Reportamos la morfología del lugar, las herramientas de los metateros y las implicaciones etnoarqueológicas resultantes del estudio de metateros modernos que pueden auxiliar la interpretación de las canteras prehispánicas para piedras de moler.

rinding stones, and more speci.cally manos and metates, are ubiquitous tools found at archaeological sites throughout the Americas. These tools were important, even to foragers, and grew in importance with the spread of agriculture, especially maize cultiva­tion. Analyses of grinding stones recovered from archaeological sites are a common aspect of site reports, but these tend to generate data that emphasize the middle and end of the use-lives of these tools (Searcy 2011:8). 

The prehistoric manufacture of ground stone tools has received scant attention, and we sug­gest this may be due to two primary factors. First, the quarries where much of the production of grinding stones occurred are often remotely located from the primary habitation sites at which archaeologists tend to focus their research. Settlement surveys are most often intended to locate sites of occupation where people spent much of their time engaged in domestic activities. 
Second, quarry sites may be dif.cult to identify due to their lack of visible architecture and lim­ited artifact distribution on the ground surface. Quarry sites are principally composed of stone tools and debitage that tend to blend with the natural environment. 
Despite these circumstances, several ground stone quarries have been identi.ed and docu­mented in the Americas. These include quarries in California (Conlee 2000; 
Schneider 
1996; 
Schneider et al. 1995), 
Arizona

1993; 
Huck-ell 1986; 
Schneider 
1996), 
Mexico 
(Cook 
1973), 
and Belize (Ward 2013). 
These 
quarries 
were 
exploited by prehistoric stoneworkers for their sandstone, andesite, rhyolite, granite, and basalt for the production of grinding stones. 
Several studies on ground stone production at modern quarries have also been conducted and provide rich ethnographic data that serve as analogies for the manufacture of manos

These 
studies 
document the manufacturing process by mod­ern metateros (metate stoneworkers) at over 10 active quarries in Guatemala and Mexico. They address stone selection, quarry morphology, the chaîne opératoire of manufacture, prehistoric and modern tools, ground stone economies, and several other aspects of modern produc­tion. Importantly, they provide analogical clues as to how prehistoric ground stone tools were produced. 
In 2013, during a pedestrian survey in the Casas Grandes River valley in northwest Chi­huahua, Mexico, we identi.ed a stone quarry on a terrace above the Casas Grandes River (Figure 
1). 
We 
call 
this 
site 
the 
Santiago 
Quarry 
(CH2013-006), and its discovery is signi.cant, not only because it is the .rst of its kind found in the Casas Grandes region, but also because of its relation to the site of Paquime, one of the largest city centers ever built in the prehistoric US Southwest/Northwest Mexico. This primate ceremonial and economic center reached its zenith sometime during the thirteenth and four­teenth centuries AD, and many artifacts made of volcanic stone have been found at Paquime (Di Peso et al. 1974,vol.7). 

Two of the most notable artifact types made of this material are manos and metates. VanPool and Leonard 
(2002:725–726) 
have 
explored stan­dardization in metate manufacturing at Paquime, in an excellent study using data from the original analyses 
by 
Di 
Peso 
and 
colleagues. 
(1974,vol. 
7). Their use of the coef.cient of variation (CV) statistically showed that both Type 1A (square­cornered) and 1B (smooth-cornered) metates evi­denced morphological standardization (VanPool and Leonard 2002:723). 

The 
well-formed 
Type 
1A 
metates 
(Figure 
2) 
had much less variation than the Type 1B metates. Most square-cornered (Type 1A) metates from modern excavations in the region have been found at the site of Paquime as opposed to smaller sites in areas outside of this primate center (see Whalen and Minnis 2009:207–208). 
Di 
Peso 
(1974:2:395–396) 
notes 
that 
both 
metate 
types were found in the House of the Pillars at Paquime, which he suggests is evidence for a “metate manufactory” in one of the upper rooms. In 
addition, 
VanPool 
and 
Leonard 
(2002:717) 
illustrate one of the “storerooms” at Paquime that included several Type 1A metates stacked on top of one another, a possible indication that they were cached by the inhabitants of the site. 
Although manos and metates are the most commonly recovered artifacts made of volcanic rock, various other items have been found in the Casas Grandes region, including macaw cage stones, altar stones, and anthropomorphic statues. This suggests that quarries such as the Santiago Quarry were important sources of raw material for the production of a range of goods (Di Peso et al. 1974, 
vol. 
7; 
Searcy 
and 
Pitezel 
2016; 
Whalen 
and 
Minnis 
2001, 
2009). 

The primary goal of this research is to provide a detailed description of the Santiago Quarry, with the purpose of contributing to a better understanding of the prehistoric manufacture of ground stone tools at similar quarry sites. We describe important characteristics of the quarry and items found there, which can aid in the identi.cation and interpretation of other quarry sites. In particular, we describe the metatero’s tool kit resulting from the analysis of artifacts found at the Santiago Quarry. We also examine ethnographic and ethnoarchaeological research associated with ground stone manufacture, to inform our interpretations of the organization of ground stone production in the Casas Grandes region. 

Paquime and the Casas Grandes Region 

The terrain of northern Chihuahua can be characterized as a basin-and-range landscape with a few well-watered valleys. One of the most verdant valleys in this desert region is marked by the Casas Grandes River that .ows north from the con.uence of two major drainages out of the Sierra Madre Occidental mountain range to the west. Although the heat of the Chihuahuan desert can be formidable, the perennial waters of the Casas Grandes River have provided a source of livelihood for people in this region for millennia.

At least since 1500 BC, prehistoric people had made this valley their home, and by AD 700, pithouse-dwelling people began to build small communities where they hunted and gath­ered wild resources, and developed a more widespread tradition of maize agriculture (Kelley and Searcy 2015). 
By 
about 
AD 
1200, 
the 
Casas 
Grandes region experienced increasing popula­tion growth that coincided with the aggregation of people into numerous sites along drainages with access to arable land and water (Lekson et al. 2004).

and construction of Paquime, which Lekson and colleagues 
(2004:60) 
consider 
to 
be 
“the 
largest 
settlement in the Pueblo IV Southwest” and “almost certainly the most cosmopolitan, most spectacular city in the long history of the South­west.” Its multistoried buildings, built of mas­sive, meter-thick walls, enclosed approximately 1,100 rooms. These were constructed adjacent to monumental architecture that included platform mounds, Mesoamerican-style ball courts, large roasting ovens, communal plazas, and ef.gy mounds. 

The Santiago Quarry 

The quarry is about 1 km east of the Casas Grandes River, immediately west of a road between the modern towns of Nuevo Casas Grandes and Madero, and about 200 m south of Arroyo Seco. We named the site Cantera Santi­ago (Santiago Quarry) for a historic inscription with the name “Santiago” pecked into the surface of a large boulder at the site. Santiago Quarry is on a narrow, low hill where an outcrop of mostly vesicular igneous stone, dark gray in color, is exposed at the top of the hill. Geologic maps of this area indicate Tertiary formations that include deposits of rhyolite, andesite, and basalt (SGM 2002). 
Trace 
elemental 
analyses 
performed 
using 
XRF spectrometry characterize the stone at this quarry as basaltic trachyandesite, an extrusive igneous rock. The surrounding geology includes other volcanic formations, including remnants of basaltic and rhyolitic .ows. These are evident in the exposed rock faces that manifest as cliffs and eroded bedrock along the east-facing slopes of Cerro Montezuma, located directly west of the Santiago Quarry (Pitezel 2011). 

The Santiago Quarry is de.ned by the dis­tribution of large, worked boulders, mano and metate preforms and fragments, chipped stone debitage, and stone tools on the surface, the majority of which are located on the north-northwest slope facing the Casas Grandes River and Arroyo Seco. The site is approximately 272 m × 154 m, covering a total of 3.56 hectares 
(8.8 acres; Figure 
3). 
As 
mentioned 
above, 
it 
is 
the .rst igneous stone quarry of its type recorded in the Casas Grandes region, and likely was one of several that were exploited for production of manos, metates, and other tools found at sites in this area. 
Once identi.ed, we considered a systematic survey of the entire 3.56 hectares, collecting each tool identi.ed. This would have required several transects with a distance between people

of approximately 5 m. We soon realized that the density of artifacts would not warrant such a survey, so we decided to identify the boundaries of the quarry and chose six sample areas to systematically survey. 
We selected sample areas de.ned by high concentrations of basalt debitage and quarry tools, and these we identi.ed as possible work areas. We documented artifacts from the six work areas, each averaging approximately 90 m2 in area. Table 
1 
includes counts for artifact types identi.ed in each of the work areas. Due to the high number of large, stone artifacts identi.ed during the survey, and the signi.cant amount of effort required to transport such heavy loads to our vehicle, systematic surface collection of artifacts was performed in only Work Areas 1– 
3. In addition to collecting artifacts in the six work areas described above, we also conducted a general site-wide surface collection of artifacts that were characteristic of those found across the site, to increase the sample size of tools that were later analyzed. Debitage was not collected for the reason of weight mentioned above, but measurements were taken on site. On average, debitage found on the surface included small basalt .akes that ranged from 1 to 7 cm in diameter and were 2 mm–2 cm thick. Larger .akes ranged from 7 to 20 cm in diameter and were 3–7 cm thick. 
To de.ne subsurface contexts, we excavated eight shovel test pits (25 × 25 cm each),

randomly placed throughout the quarry. These revealed that at depths varying from 3 to 30 cm, the vesicular basaltic trachyandesite and what appeared to be a lighter-colored igneous bedrock, perhaps volcanic tuff, lay in rather shallow deposits. The soil matrix included .akes and deb­itage similar in size to that found on the ground surface. This suggests that buried deposits include some accretional layers of debitage cre­ated during the quarrying and manufacturing process. 
Most artifacts identi.ed were the tools and byproducts of quarrying, but other artifacts iden­ti.ed and collected were nine Casas Grandes plainware ceramic fragments, one red-on-brown painted sherd, two bifaces made of gray chert, one uniface made of white chert, and several chert .akes. These are common at sites in the Casas Grandes region, which date between AD 700 and 1450. Unfortunately, the lack of multiple ceramic types, especially painted vari­eties, and the absence of organic materials that could be radiocarbon dated, prevented us from being able to further re.ne the chronological use of the Santiago Quarry. We recognize the issues this poses but submit that only further excavation at the quarry site will resolve this problem. 
Other characteristics of the quarry include a concentration of mano preforms and a concen­tration of hammerstones (ca. 12). A depression or pit at the western edge may be the result of basalt extraction. It is approximately 5 m wide in diameter and has inward tapering sides to a depth of about 1–2 m. Several bedrock mortars that range in size from 7 to 18 cm wide and 3 to 20 cm deep are just to the east of the depression. There is no evidence of above-ground architecture and no evidence of looting. 
Metateros Tool Kit The majority of artifacts found at the Santiago Quarry appear to be associated with quarrying activities, and we assume that these represent the suite of tools used by prehistoric craftsmen to extract and shape basalt. Evidence for this interpretation can be gleaned from ethnoarchae­ological studies described below, but the most prominent lines of evidence for quarrying activ­ities derives from the extensive distribution of chipped basalt debitage associated with un.n­ished and broken manos and metates at the site. In addition, we identi.ed several large boulders on the surface, which were altered. These worked boulders included cut lines and large voids where pieces had been removed, likely through direct percussion using large hammerstones or mauls. 
Hammerstones and mauls make up the major­ity of the tools 
(Tables 
2 
and 3). 
Hammer-stones appear to be river-worn cobbles of .ne-grained 
basalt, 
rhyolite, 
or 
quartzite 
(Figure 
4), 
likely collected by prehistoric metateros from the Casas Grandes River or Arroyo Seco. We collected and analyzed 27 hammerstones (9 complete; 18 fragments), which vary in shape and size (see Table 
2). 
Many 
are uni­faces or bifaces, but several also showed signs of use on several facets of the surface (i.e., multifaces). 
We also collected 22 grooved mauls made of .ne-grained 
basalt 
and

179) 
(Figure 
5). 
For 
specimens 
that 
are 
complete 
or nearly complete, we identi.ed fully grooved and ¾-grooved mauls. Mauls also appear to have been made on river cobbles, possibly selected for their lenticular or cylindrical shapes, which also made them more conducive to hafting to a stick or handle. 
Adams 
(2014:157) 
has 
noted 
that 
“there 
is 
a fuzzy boundary between hammerstones and mauls. Both have the same general percussion function and incur the same use-wear damage.” She goes on to indicate that the groove is what sets mauls apart from hammerstones, so if a frag­mented object is found without a groove, there is a chance it will be erroneously characterized as a hammerstone. We identi.ed 14 percussion tools as indeterminate maul or hammerstone fragments due to their incompleteness. 
In addition to tools, we identi.ed mano and metate preforms. These are the only artifacts of production found at the site, although it is possible other types (e.g. altar stones, macaw cage stones, etc.) were not identi.ed due to their incomplete stage of manufacture.

Identifying manos and metates is important, because doing so indicates not only the type of tools manufactured at this quarry, but also the stage at which the tools were produced. All the tools at this quarry were rough preforms that

Ethnoarchaeology of Ground Stone Quarries 
In this section we review ethnographic and ethnoarchaeological literature regarding modern ground stone production. Drawing from some of the most comprehensive studies, we note characteristics of modern quarries comparable to the Santiago Quarry. Primarily, we discuss patterns in quarry morphology (work areas), tool kits, and work.ows (what is done where) related to the manufacturing process. 
In 
the 
late 
1970s, 
Brian 
Hayden 
(1987) 
stud­
ied among metateros of Malacatancito in the Guatemalan Highlands. His work is signi.cant because he located a metatero who still knew the craft of metate and mano production using stone tools. Ramón Ramos Rosario, one of the only full-time stone workers in the area, demon­strated the process of producing a metate using primarily hammerstones (or pics) found along the riverbed where basalt was also extracted (Figure 
8). 
Although 
metal 
chisels 
were 
used 
to initially procure a block of basalt in this recorded exercise, the remainder of production was performed using only stone tools made of either .ne-grained basalt or gabbro. Hayden documented this process in detail, including the collection and use of a suite of hammerstones described as two-handed pics (1.8–3.0 kg), one-handed pics (0.8–1.8 kg), or abraders (0.3–0.7 kg) (Hayden 1987:53). 

Tools ranged in size and shape and could be held using one or two hands, depending on the size of the implement. Most were made of the abundant .ne-grained basalt available along the Malacatancito riverbed quarry. According to Ramos, there were several criteria he used in

choosing suitable pics, including material that would effectively indent the vesicular basalt, stone that could properly maintain a cutting edge, material that could be resharpened through the removal of .akes, tools that would not fracture or break upon impact, material with shapes that were easy to grip, and material that was of a manageable size (generally less than 5 kg; Hay­den 1987:18–20). 
Hayden 
(1987:52–53) notes that while a trihedral (acutely angled) pointed implement is ideal for making indentations and removing .akes of vesicular basalt, pics and abraders vary in shape, and their morphological features evolve over their use-lives as they are resharpened or break during use. He also notes that there is no preference for either unifacial or bifacial resharpening, and that any pointed surface can be used to perform the same tasks (Hayden 1987:55). 

For the most part, Ramos used direct percus­sion with the one-and two-handed pics to remove .akes from the basalt block and to shape it into a rough form in the quarry. These .akes ranged in size from 2 × 2cmto20 × 10 cm and ended

up in piles of debitage surrounding his work area (Hayden 1987:26). 
This 
roughing-out 
stage 
of 
manufacture resulted in a preform that was then transported to his home workshop to be .nished. Similar stages of production seem to correlate with location (quarry vs. workshop) at several other modern metate communities where the roughing-out of preforms occurs in the quarry, and the thinning and .nishing of the product takes place in a workshop, usually at or close to the metatero’s home (Cook 1982;Diaz 
2010; 
Searcy 2011). 
At 
Ramos’s 
home 
workshop, 
he 
used abraders to “regularize” the surfaces and make them “as .at or smooth as possible” (Hay­den 1987:72). 
Using 
a 
swiping 
motion, 
Ramos 
smoothed the raised surfaces of the metate, which resulted in tools that exhibited extremely abraded surfaces (Hayden 1987:38). 
In 
the 
end, 
he 
was 
able to successfully produce a tripodal metate using the one-and two-handed pics and the abraders made of .ne-grained basalt and gabbro. 
Searcy (2011) 
also spent time among metateros at two other active basalt quarries in Guatemala in 2004 and 2005. The Nahuala quarry is located southeast of Malacatancito in the department of Sololá, and the other is in San

Luís Jilotepeque, located west of Guatemala City in the department of Jalapa. Searcy notes that distinct patterns in the morphology of quarries correlates with several behaviors. As at the Mala­catancito 
quarries, 
Searcy 
(2011:52–53) 
found 
that metateros would extract basalt from other areas in the quarry and haul the blocks of stone to work stations, many of which were covered by trees or champas (grass-covered ramadas) to shade them from the scorching sun (see also Dary and Esquivel 1991:8). 
These 
areas are where metateros stored their tools and worked stone into rough shapes. The debitage in these work areas was somewhat smaller than in places where the stone had been extracted, although Searcy 
(2011:53) 
noted 
that 
some 
large 
pieces 
of stone removed at work stations were cleared to the perimeter so they were not in the way as metateros re.ned their blocks of stone (see also Nelson 1987b:133). 


Discussion 

The purpose of reviewing the ethnographic literature on ground stone production is to pro­vide possible contextual clues for our inter­pretation of the ground stone economy in the Casas Grandes region. The ethnographic stud­ies described above provide rich details and serve as formal analogies for the interpretation of prehistoric ground stone quarries and the manufacturing process. We do not suggest that ethnographic analogies take the place of data, nor do we suggest that data from this single quarry site provide conclusive evidence for our interpre­tations. We simply propose that the ethnographic record provides suggestions for the interpretation of ground stone production at these quarry sites. While the metateros studied 
by 
Searcy 
(2011) 
and 
Cook 
(1982) 
used 
metal 
tools 
in 
the 
reduction 
process required to produce manos and metates, Hayden’s 
(1987) 
research 
with 
Ramón 
Ramos 
provides important clues regarding stone tool selection. 
One of the .rst correlations we address are the similarities between stone tools used by modern metateros and those found at the Santiago Quarry. Hayden’s (1987) 
work 
with 
Ramón Ramos is the only available record of a modern metatero using stone tools to produce a mano and metate, and therefore is unique. Ramos’s use of three different types of stone tools (two-handed pics, one-handed pics, and abraders) correlated with steps in the

manufacture process. We observed that only one-and two-handed hammerstones, equivalent to ethnographic examples, were identi.ed at the Santiago Quarry. Abraders, according to Ramos, were typically used at his home workshop where the process of re.ning took place. In addition, other ethnographic accounts also record this step as occurring primarily at a home workshop. For these reasons, we suggest that tools (i.e., abraders) associated with this .nal step in ground stone production at the Santiago Quarry were not found because re.ning of manos and metates likely occurred at home workshops prehistorically. In addition, many of the stone tools identi.ed were grooved mauls used to quarry large blocks of vesicular basalt, which were then roughly shaped at quarry workstations. 
The morphology of the hammerstones can also be interpreted using the information Hay­den 
(1987) 
recorded 
when 
working 
with 
Ramos 
during his selection of stone tools. Most of the hammerstones we collected were either unifacial or multifacial. As Ramos indicated, selection criteria for stone pics included sizes small enough

to hold, shapes that were ergonomically effective, and surfaces that included pointed angles that would effectively indent vesicular basalt in order to remove .akes and to break large blocks from the bedrock. There were no unique pat­terns among our assemblage of hammerstones, although we could possibly categorize them as one-or two-handed, according to the weights and sizes 
of 
those 
identi.ed 
by 
Hayden 
(1987). 
Once 
again, we hesitate to pigeonhole these artifacts based only on Hayden’s work with Ramos. Nev­ertheless, we suggest that the size and shape of the hammerstones used for prehistoric quarrying are likely closely linked to their speci.c task (i.e., removal of large blanks from bedrock or for shaping boulders, removal of large .akes,

and removal of small .akes) because of their association with the quarry site itself. 
Additionally, we collected 22 whole and fragmented grooved mauls, which could have accommodated a wooden handle. The complete specimens averaged 1.3 kg in mass, and tended to be larger than most hammerstones. The sizes of the mauls from the Santiago Quarry are closely related to the two-handed pics used by Ramos (Hayden 1987:53). 
We 
suggest 
that 
these 
were 
primarily used to quarry stone due to their size and the ability to enact more force with less impact to the hands and arms because of the attached wooden handle (see Searcy 2011:41– 
42). We further suggest that smaller mauls were also used in the reduction of stone products into their roughed-out forms. 
Stone tool material was also selected based on certain qualities. Although hard gabbro was preferred by Ramos for stone pics, .ne-grained basalt was just as effective when working to remove .akes of vesicular basalt. Most of the hammerstones and mauls at Santiago Quarry were made of .ne-grained basalt, while oth­ers were made of other locally available stone types, such as quartzite. All of these were water smoothed and were likely obtained and carried from the nearby river or arroyo. We observed that nearly all water-worn river cobbles picked up from the surface of the quarry site showed signs of battering, suggesting that these were carried to the site speci.cally for quarrying activities. 
Another similar comparison that can be made between modern quarries and the Santiago Quarry is that debitage is consistent in size and shape; most .akes range between 10 and 30 cm in length and width. These sizes are consistent with the reduction and shaping phase of metate and mano blanks among contemporary metateros who carry out this task primarily at the quarry location (Hayden 1987:26; 
Searcy 
2011:53). 
The 
presence 
of 
only 
preforms 
at the Santiago Quarry could be explained by the fact that the metateros studied 
by 
Cook 
(1982), 
Searcy (2011), 
Hayden 
(1987), and Nelson (1987b) 
at 
various 
metate 
quarries 
in 
Mexico 
and Guatemala only roughed out their product at the quarry site. Further re.ning was carried out at household workshops where the surfaces of these tools were smoothed and re.ned. The whole and fragmented preforms we found at the Santiago Quarry were rough in shape, and surface smoothing was minimal or absent. 
Work areas at the Santiago Quarry were de.ned by the presence of both .aked deb­itage and stone tools; a few included mano and 
metate 
preforms. 
Applying 
Nelson’s 
(1987b) 
observations on quarry types, some work areas at Santiago Quarry are large, reoccupied areas, while others are single-use areas due to the small scatter of vesicular basalt .akes and no tools or 
preforms. 
Nelson 
(1987b:126) 
suggests 
that 
it is often dif.cult to identify the boundaries of individual work spaces in bedrock quarries, whereas the streambed quarries were more dis­tinct. The bleeding together of boundaries often is the result of many metateros working in close contact at the quarry core, and their resulting debitage piles easily blend at the peripheries. We found that well-de.ned work areas at the Santiago Quarry were few (see Figure 
3). 
Most 
of the site is a scatter of .akes, hammerstones, and mauls. We would surmise that the Santiago Quarry, a bedrock quarry, may have been used by many metateros whose work stations overlapped. In addition, we consider the long duration of time that this quarry may have been used by metateros, whose workstations not only overlapped, but also could have covered one another as debitage accumulated. Further excavation of work stations may provide more evidence regarding successive use of the quarry. 

Conclusions 

The analysis of the Santiago Quarry, coupled with ethnoarchaeology, provides some interest­ing archaeological patterns that can help bet­ter de.ne ground stone quarries. Ethnographic sources provide excellent analogs for the produc­tion of manos and metates from vesicular basalt at extraction points and quarry workshops. They are signi.cant resources that provide unique clues to the behaviors associated with ground stone production, and they represent the valuable preservation of prehistoric traditions that soon will not be observable. Some of the important information that aided in our interpretation of the Santiago Quarry includes the nature and common characteristics of stone tools used for

quarrying and manufacture and site formation and morphology. 
The .nely crafted manos and metates from the Casas Grandes area stand out as examples of the incredible skill possessed by a group of stoneworkers. The discovery of this quarry and its analysis allow us to better describe the nature of the ancient metateros’ craft. This study also serves as a resource for comparable prehistoric quarry sites and the interpretation of their arti­facts and features.
