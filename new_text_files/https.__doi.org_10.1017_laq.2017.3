This hybrid approach was applied to a small sample of salvage-excavated pottery from modern, heavily populated Flores Island, Guatemala. During the Postclassic(ca. 
A.D. 1000–1525) and contact (ca. A.D. 1525– 1700) periods,FloreswasTayza, capitalof the Itza Maya in a con.ict-ridden lacustrine land­scape.

Pottery Stylistic Analysis 
The study of pottery decorative styles has long basked in the Americanist archaeological and ethnoarchaeological limelight, from the rise of processualism in the 1960s through the early 1990s (see, e.g., Conkey and Hastorf 1990; Hegmon 1992;Rice 2015:392–410).Numerous theories were advanced about styles and their components: what they are, how they are trans­mitted, and their social meanings. Since then, similar analysesof decorativestyleshavelargely falleninto desuetude, replacedbyother concerns (e.g., agency). I propose that certain enduring contributions of the earlier positions can be combined with newer approaches to cultivate a hybrid analytical vigor. 
Here,Iconsider styletobea systemof visual expression and communication, distinctive to a particular time, place, group, or individual. Styles are culturally speci.c combinations of resources,processes, themes,media, and forms. Theyareatleast partly technological—and tech­nology is partly stylistic. Far from being .xed or static, styles are open and dynamic, and theychange as relevant newinformation—social, religious, political,orother—entersthe cultural system. 
EarlyApproaches:DesignStructure and InformationExchange 
Hierarchical design-structure analysis (HDSA), as applied ethnographically to pottery decora­tion, focuses on the potter’ssequential decisions involved in embellishing a vessel (Friedrich 1970). It begins with identifying the distinct spacesof the decoratedvessel’ssurface: thelay­outthat establishesthedesign .eld(s),whichmay be formally demarcated by boundary markers or framing lines.Analysis then focuses on decisions that determined thelocationofdecorations.The smallest component in HDSA is a design ele­ment,which maybea singlestrokeof a paint­brush or an incising/impressing tool. Elements are combined into more complex patterns or arrangements called motifs or con.gurations, placed within the de.ned .elds.Thisstep-wise sequence, with early decisions affecting later ones, establishes the hierarchy of the design structure, that is, its rules or logic. In this approach,adialectic canbe seen between agency (choice of design components) and structure (overall style;Hegmon andKulow 2005). 
In 1977 Marvin Wobst published an in.u­ential essay about how styles communicate in what has cometobe known as stylistic messag­ingorinformation-exchange theory.Heoffered numerous propositions about the information incorporated into styles and symbols and its communication, basedon visibilityandthesocial and physical distance between the sender and receiver.Forexample,he suggestedthat(1)the intensity of stylistic behavior should correlate positivelywiththesizeofsocial networks(Wobst 1977:326). It follows, then, that (2) a positive relationshipexistsamong thevisibility or easeof recognition of a style or symbol, the size of the geographic area of its distribution, and the size of thegroup being identi.ed(Wobst 1977:330, 335). Similarly, (3) artifacts are more likely to carry stylistic messages if they are potentially visible to large numbers of people, rather than onlywithina household(Wobst 1977:328–329). 
(4) Objects with a relatively restricted distri­bution and low visibility will express themes of local speci.city(Wobst 1977:335).And (5), in times of social, demographic, or economic stress and competition, information exchange through stylistic messaging will manifest as group-speci.c or regionalized styles. Variabil­ity within these styles signals group af.liation, highlights elites, and enhances boundary main­tenance (Wobst 1977:329, 332–333; see also Hodder 1979:447–450; Plog 1980:129–139). 
Along-standing argument about pottery dec­orative styles concerned whether their commu­nicativerolewas activeor passive.One position viewed decoration as consciously and actively chosen to convey messages of identity and boundaryidenti.cation and maintenance (e.g., Bowser 2000;Hegmon 1992; Hodder 1977; Weissner1983).Alternatively,styles can be seen as passive, unconscious repetitions of customary behaviors and designs: “isochrestic” (Sackett 1985)likePierre Bourdieu’s(1977)habitus. 
With respect to Petén Postclassic pottery, it is dif.cult to know if the motifs had the same meanings throughout the lakes region or how they survived disjunctions over time and space (see Kubler 1961), given that some can

be found in Classic times (A.D. 200–900/1000). Moreover, meanings are constructed from expe­rience, and to communicate effectively these meanings should be decodable by both sender (artisan) and vessel viewer/user through shared experience. The absence of intersubjectivity— sharedexperiences among PostclassicMaya and twenty-.rst-century academicians—obliges us toexploreother approachesto interpretingmean­inginvisual culture. 
SomeNewer Approaches:Investigating Meaning 
More recent approaches to style continue to focus on its communicativerole,butwith greater emphasis on how its messages or meanings are constructed by an audience of viewers. The communicativefunctionof objects, motifs, and symbols is semasiographic: meanings are con­veyed visually by signs and images rather than by written or spoken words and their semantic values. 
Onesubsetoftherelativelynew.eldofvisual culture studies(orvisual studies) concerns visual rhetoric as an analogue toverbal rhetoric:how “visual elements are used to in.uence people’s attitudes, opinions, and beliefs”(Helmers and Hill 2004:2).With referenceto pottery,the inter­estisinhow images and symbols, such as forms and decoration, communicate meaning to an audience andhowthe audience formulates these meanings (Foss 2004:306). Analysis addresses the “nature” of an artifact and its distinguishing features,which maybepresented or suggested. Presented features or elements include overt visual characteristics such as medium, color, texture, and so on. Suggested elements are the “concepts, ideas, themes, and allusions that a vieweris likelytoinfer fromthe presented ele­ments,”thatis,theirmessagesor meanings(Foss 2004:307). Much like Bruno Latour’s (2005) concept of object agency in constructing the social,visual studies engageadialecticinvolv­ing “the social construction of the visual .eld [and] thevisual constructionofthe social .eld” (Mitchell 2002:170–171). For archaeologists, the rhetorical focus subsumes the objects and symbolsthataffected pastlivesinabroad range of humanexperiences, echoing habitus(seeFoss 2004:303). 
Anotherwayto consider meaningis through the concept of an interpretive community. The meaning of a work of art, or a text, or a set of icons, symbols, or motifs, is partly that intended by the creator/artist but also that of the viewer or reader. With reference to texts, the reader­responseschoolof literary theoryis concerned with thereader’s reactionto, and creationof, the meaning of a literary work as distinct from that of the author.Similarly, visual rhetoric scholars do not see the intentions of an artifact’s creator as determining its correct interpretation (Foss 2004:308).Literary theoristStanleyFish(1976, 1980:171),throughacritical readingofthe Vari­orum Commentary on Milton’s poems, invented the conceptofan interpretivecommunity,whose members share the same epistemology or set of “interpretive strategies . . . for constituting [a text’s] properties and assigning their inten­tions.” Much as with the shared “doing” or praxis through interactions in communities of practice(Lave andWenger 1991), theseinter­pretive strategies are culturally constructed and learned (in part through language sharing and also through academic training), based on gen­erally subjective assumptions about what things (words, texts, icons, motifs) mean and how they shouldbeinterpreted. Elsewhere, Fish has explained these communitiesintermsof mem­berssharing“apointofvieworwayoforganizing experience ...[and] distinctions, categories of understanding, and stipulations of relevance and irrelevance” (Fish 1989:141, quoted in Houston et al. 2006:98). 
Still another way of approaching meaning comes from the concept of semiotechnology, employed in recent studies of systems of communication through modern social media. The term refers to analyses of technocultural assemblages that combine theideasof semiotics (the science of signi.cation—how signs convey meaning; seeBauer 2002)with studiesof modern communications technology.Manystudiesbuild on debates concerning how the meanings of signs—written words and .xed signi.cations— canbe distortedinthesemediain comparisonto face-to-faceverbal communication, wheremuch of the message is conveyed not only by words themselves but by body language.1 A recent exploration of semiotechnology by Ganaele

Langlois(2011,2014)confrontsthis debatefrom theviewpointof meaningand “making sense”of theworld.Meaningsof thingsandeventsareboth individually and collectively (culturally) con­structed paths by which we decipher the known and unknown and situate ourselves within.These pathways are constructedbyoften unseen“power formations that mobilizelanguage, signi.cation, [and] representational and informational technologies”(Langlois 2011:2). Themakingof meaningsisaneveryday task,but alsoacomplex exercisethat simultaneously empowers,emanci­pates, and subjugates (Langlois 2014). Meaning is not simply signi.cation per se but instead, with respect to technology, can be thought of as a liminal space where “the transition from signi.cationtomaking sense” unfolds (Langlois 2014).Semiotechnologies “can servetoorganize a reality, or a set of common expectations, and therefore maintain, or challenge, relations of power” (Langlois 2011:11). 
The semiotechnologies of the early twenty-.rst century—online communications technolo­gies, participatory media, Facebook, Google, various proprietary software,Wikipedia, and so on—are generally commercialized, and areoften manipulative or invasive, mechanical ways of producing signs and meanings from datathat can be collected and used in targeted advertisements, or in surveillance or other ethically question­able platforms (Langlois 2014). Traditional or “older mediaforms,”bycontrast,wereprimarily designedto communicatemeanings through con­struction of both signs and practices of making senseoftheworld.Thefocusofsemiotechnology studies, then, should be less on signi.cation and more on the “regimes of production and circulation of meaning” (Langlois 2011:1). 
What do these new pathways to the study of objects and symbols—visual rhetoric, interpre­tive communities, and semiotechnology—add to older ones (information exchange, design-structure analysis)? How can they contribute to understandingthemeaningsof Petén Postclassic pottery decoration? First, Postclassicsettlements canbe considered interpretivecommunitieswith shared categories of understanding concerning thevisual objectsand symbolsinthedailylives of people. Second, the pottery forms, layouts, colors, and motifs constitute power-laden rhetor­icaldevicesandavocabularyfor communication. Third, Postclassic pottery style and decoration canbe consideredakindof“older mediaform” of semiotechnology: potteryisatechnology,and its decoration consists of signs or icons (motifs). Pottery as a semiotechnology can be studied from the viewpoint of material culture having agency,àla actor-network theory(Latour 2005), in constructingthe social.Thus decorated pottery helped the Postclassic-and contact-periodItzas, and their rivals the Kowojs, make sense of their world and its changing power relations, becausethedecoration had meanings (sometimes semantic)and agentialforce.Thekey,then,isto decode thevisual rhetoric—the “concepts, ideas, themes, and allusions”—mobilized and deployed in the styles, layouts, and motifs. 


Background: The Central Petén Postclassic 
The lakes region of the Department of Petén, northernGuatemala,is de.nedby an east-west lineoflakes formed alongafault lineatapproxi­mately 17° north latitude. These bodiesofwater, from west to east, are Sacpuy, Petén Itzá (the largest), with tiny Petenxil and Quexil to the south, Salpetén, Macanché,Yaxhá, and Sacnab (Figure1). 
Itzas,Kowojs, and TheirFactions 
My nearly 40-year interest in the Postclassic­and contact-period ceramics of this area began with perplexity at the pronounced differences, particularlyinpastesand decoration, betweenthe pottery from theTopoxté Islandsin LakeYaxhá in the east(Bullard 1970;Rice 1979)and that around Lake Petén Itzáin thewest(Chase 1983; Cowgill 1963). The sites of these lake basins were further differentiated by the presence of distinctivetempleassemblage architectureinthe east, whichwas absentin thewest(Rice 1986). Grant Jones’s(1998)archivalstudies partly clar­i.ed thesituation.Twofeuding “ethnopolities” occupied opposite ends of the lake chain—the powerful Itza confederacyinthe Lake Petén Itzá basin and theKowojsintheYaxhá basin,with settlementsontheTopoxtéIslands.The reality was, of course, more complex, with factional divisions within each polity.

Archaeological research on the Topoxté Islands indicated they were largely abandoned around A.D. 1450–1475 (Wurster and Her­mes 2000:249). It is likely that the inhabitants departedintwofactions.One apparently settled oneday’stravelnorthofLakePeténItzá (Atranet al. 2004:6;Jones 1998:280), perhaps at theTikal ruins. Anotherfaction, better known historically and archaeologically,began aggressivelymoving westward, usurpingformerItza territory, estab­lishingacenterat ZacpeteninLakeSalpeténand constructing two of their signature architectural temple assemblages there (Pugh 2001, 2003, 2009). By the late seventeenth century, this expansionist group had taken over the Itza port town of Ixlu on the narrow isthmus separating Lakes Salpetén and Petén Itzá, wheretheybuilt another temple assemblage (Rice and Rice 2016) and established settlements over much of the northernshoreofthe latter. 
Among the late seventeenth-century Itzas, the ruling group was led by the Ajaw Kan Ek', who lived, along with his relatives, in the capital known variously as Tayza or Nojpeten (modernFlores Island),inthe southern basin of Lake Petén Itzá. But the Ajaw’s leadership was strongly contested by the Chak'an Itza faction, who occupiedthewestern mainland areaofLake Petén Itzá and LakeSacpuy,and who had entered into alliance with theKowojsagainst KanEk'. 
Postconquest, boththe Itzas andKowojs told the Spaniards of ties to the northern Yucatán Peninsula(Jones 1998). The Petén Itzas claimed family and lands at Chichen Itza, in eastern Itza territory.TheKowojstoldthe Spaniardsthatthey had recently left Mayapan, andIconsider them to bealineageinvolvedinthewesternXiwalliance (Rice and Rice 2009). Although the northern Itzas and Xiws had jointly governed Mayapan, their relationship was strained. Political disrup­tions prompted repeated southward migrations of members of both groups to join kin in the heavily forested and isolated lakes region. In Petén, Late Postclassic con.icts, perhaps related to thoseplaguing the north, acceleratedfactional­ism.By the endof theseventeenth centurythese hostilities—exacerbatedby sharpdisagreements about how to respond to the Spanish invaders’

demands for capitulation to the Spanish crown and conversion to Christianity—had escalated to civilwar,withtheKowojsburningapartofTayza (Jones 1998:326, 444n33, 497n12). 
Forarchaeologistsinvestigating communities or factions within them that are embroiled in such contested circumstances, it is dif.cult to materially distinguish the participants, their col­lective identities, their physical locations, their strategies for asserting power and instituting resistance, and more. I wondered if decorated pottery styles might shed light on these complex ethnopolitical identitiesatTayza. 
Pottery Styles and Components 
AlthoughKowojpottery has been widelystudied (Bullard 1970;Cecil 2001;Hermes 2000;Rice 1979; Rice and Cecil 2009), that of the Itzas has received far less attention; the scholarship that exists is generally old, super.cial, unpub­lished,orinvenueswith limitedcirculation(e.g., Berlin 1955; Chase and Chase 1983; Cowgill 1963;Forsyth 1996;Gámez2007;Hansen1997; Romero et al. 1999;Soto2006).Recent .eldwork in Itza territory indicates that the Kowoj and Itza polities deployed similarbut distinct pottery decorative styles. The most useful criteria for differentiatingthem arethe “presented” compo­nents of their rhetoric (Foss 2004:307): design structure or layout, colors, and motifs. Thus, although the decorated pottery of both was red­slipped,thetwocanbe distinguishedon multiple criteria,beginning with pasteware.Itza potters produced tan-gray, silty, Snail-Inclusion Paste (hereafter SIP) ware; the Kowojs made marly ClemenciaCreamPaste(CCP) ware(seeCecil 2001, 2009a). 
With respect to layout, potters and pottery decorators in both Itza and Kowoj settlements shared a template for how and where to apply decoration:in bands.Thisisevidenceofasingle community of interpretation and practice. The decorative .eld, framed by two lines above and one or two below, encircled the interior wall of shallowbowls and tripod dishes, and theexterior of formswith restricted ori.ces(Figure2a,2b). The band might be quadripartitioned, formally by vertical lines or informally by the position­ing of isolated motifs. This simple structure was widespread, typically painted (Itzas black; Kowojs red), and less commonlyincised. 
In the Late Postclassic the Kowojs initiated a new, ethno-speci.c, non-banded “distributive” layout on their CCP ware (Figure2c).This arrangement featured two circumferential lines abovecurvilinear,dotted, red-painted decoration covering the entireinterioroftripod dishes (Her­mes 2000;Rice 1979). The Itzas later adopted this horror vacui style on their SIP dishes, primarily Macanché Red-on-paste: Macanché variety,but also Sacá Polychrome. 
Color“wasacentralelementof ancientMaya experience, crucial to the making of meaning and identity”(Houstonet al. 2009:69), and thus it likely established some of the “themes and allusions”(Foss 2004:307)of thevisual rhetoric of the pottery.The Maya observeddeep and long­standing cosmological color senses, particularly directional associations tracking the path of the sun and the order of ritual circuits (Houston et al. 2009:27–40).Red(chak)is associated with east and sunrise; extensional meanings include hot and great.White(sak), associated with north andup(sunat zenith),has secondarymeaningsof pale, arti.cial, and beautiful.Black(ek'),aligned with west (setting sun), has generally negative extensions to darkness and restricted vision. Yellow(k'an)representssouthordown, thenight suntraversing theUnderworldfromwesttoeast; secondary meanings include ripe, mature, and precious.A.fth direction, center,was yax,blue, green, or blue-green; senses include fresh, new, .rst, and precious. 
With respect to Maya pottery, various shades of red and black were the most common paint colors. These, plus a light, creamy background, represent a “high-contrast triad” having lasting associations with function and meaning (Hous­tonet al. 2009:72).Colorsusedto decorate pot­terymayalso correspondtobody painting(Cecil 2009b:244). In 1696, the allied Kowojs and Chak'an Itzas reportedly cametoTayza wearing redbody paintand blackface paint.Thefacesof Itza men also were scari.ed (“incised”; Aven­daño 1987:38, 48, 51 [1696]). Compositional analyses revealed that Kowojs and Itzas used different sources forthe red and black pigments painted on different pottery types (Cecil and Neff 2006;see also Pugh and Cecil 2012).

Pottery and body paint colors and directional symbolism might be ethnopolitically speci.c. Kowojterritorywasinthe eastern lakes,expand­ing north and westward in theLate Postclassic; their pottery was red (east) on white (north). Itza territorywasinthe west (black) and south (yellow) of the lakes region and their pottery was painted black.Yellow colorswere not used by either group. The background color of some Itza black-painted banded decoration was occa­sionally a pale yellow-orange, but this was not used consistently. Incense burners and slipped vessels among bothKowojs and Itzas sometimes featureda post-.re coatingofMaya Blue.2 This yax pigment signi.ed some aspect or function of thevesselasfresh or precious, and conferred sacrality. 


Tayza, the Island Capital of the Itza 
Although Tayza was also known as noj peten, “big island,” Flores is actually small, covering only9.6ha(23.7 acres),itselevated centerrising ~17mabovetheever-.uctuatinglakelevel.The premodern occupations of the island are com­pletely entombed by densely packed residences, commercialbuildings,and touristfacilitiesalong paved streets. Consequently, space for sys­tematic archaeological excavation is extremely scarce. 
We willnevergeta detailedpictureof what Tayza looked like before conquest, but some hints come from the writings of Spanish mis­sionaries and military men. Thetownwas noted for its white appearance—stuccoed limestone structures—and its elevated center was, then as now, its politico-religious core. Three “tem­ples” stood there, one of which had nine tiers resembling the Kukulcan temples of Chichen Itza and Mayapan. The Spaniards were told that the island had four named barrios (Jones 1998:84, 99–100) and indeed, Flores’s major streets, descending from the plaza, divide the island into unequal quadrantsthat maybeves­tiges of theItza settlement (Figure3). At the same time, two circumferential thoroughfares, inner and outer,supportthe notionofconcentric patterning.Akeyquestion concerns thelocation oftheresidenceand templeoftheAjawKanEk', reportedlyashortdistancefrom oneofthemany canoe landing places on theisland. 
Pottery atTayza: General Observations 
Between 2004 and 2014, during brief visits to Flores for other purposes, I was occasion­ally able to examine bags of pottery recovered in excavations associated with various public­worksprojects; thesewere accessibleinlocal lab facilities and private pottery collections. I was interested in the relations between pottery and ethnopolitical identities. I began with Spanish observations that membersofthe Itzagoverning council—leaders ofthe four cardinally oriented provinces of Itza territory and other nobility, including the ruler Ajaw Kan Ek' himself— residedin theirrespectivequadrantsofthe island (Jones1998:60–61,71).Wasthesocial pluralism of Late Postclassic-and contact-period Petén

re.ectedintheabundant decorated pottery recov­eredatTayza/Flores—forexample,in thespatial disposition of motifs? 
Attempting to answer that question proved exceedingly—indeed, laughably—ambitious for severalreasons.Although decorated potterywas common on the noj peten, it was unclear how thetownwas organized spatially.Representative spatial sampling and excavation controls (other than coarse-grained horizontal provenience data) were absent in the recovery of much of the Flores rescate material.3 Moreover, research at Late Postclassic Mayapan in northern Yucatán failedtoidentifyany “clear distinctions among household pottery assemblages”that might relate to the ethnopolitical identities of resident mem­bers of the League confederacy (Masson and Peraza 2014:6). There, decorated serving wares occurredinlow frequencies and were not con­centratedinelite contexts. 
Given these circumstances, I reoriented my focus to a more open-ended inquiry exploring differences in spatial disposition of decorated Postclassic pottery types, varieties, forms, lay­outs, styles, and motifs over the island (Rice 2017a).Ialso comparedthesewithevidencefrom mainland sites. I was interested in the visual culture aspects of the pottery: what styles did and “said,”andhowtheyheldmeaningsforthe makers and users. 
In general, I found that vessels of almost all forms and types recovered on Flores Island were larger than those from other lacustrine sites and showed a greater range in sizes, fromverylarge to miniatures.Unslipped pottery and incensario fragments, particularly compos­ite types, occurred in virtually all excavations. Comal rims were occasionally noted. Globular ollas were used for urn burials of infants and children. Most of the slipped and decorated

pottery was SIP ware, primarily types in the Paxcamán ceramic group. Trapeche group pot­tery was present, mostly in the north and west sectors,butgenerally uncommon. AugustineRed fragments occurred unevenly, found primarily around the perimeter roads. The most com­mon forms were large monochrome jars and grater bowls, suggesting utilitarian (rather than serving) functions, perhaps in kitchens; drums were also common. Only two polychrome-decorated Augustine group sherds were noted (Figure5d).Imports included small quantities of Yucatán types (Mama Red, Chichen Red, TacopateTrickle, and slatewares)onthe island and also at mainland sites, plus scarce Fine Orange and rare Plumbate. Spanish imports are extremelyrarethroughout thelakes district, and tin-enameledwares(majolica) atTayasal were primarily products ofcolonial Antigua. 
DecoratedPottery atTayza 
Ipursued spatial analysisofthe decorated pottery fragments of Flores Island by sector or quad­rant. Regardless of whether the claim that the Itzas’ noj peten was organized around four bar­rios is empirically true, intercardinal quadrants can be distinguished by modern streets: north­east, northwest, southwest, and southeast, plus the center,thecivic-ceremonial core(Figure3). Sometimes, becauseofunclearproveniencedata, Icategorized locations simply as north, center,or south. 
Forms and Types. Decorated vessels were pri­marily for food or beverage service and were categorized by form as bowl (simple, collared, other), tripod dish or plate, jar, tecomate (neck­less globular jar), or miniature. Tripod dishes were the most common decorated form every­where on the island (37 percent), especially in thesoutheastern quadrant,followedbybowlsand collaredbowls (31.7 percent), thelatter particu­larly notedin the centerof theisland. Themajor types and varieties of decorated wares are tab­ulatedin Table1.Mostsherds werePaxcamán­group types,including Ixpop (black-painted dec­oration), Sacá (red-and-black),Tachisvarietyof Macanché Red-on-paste (geometricmotifs), and .ne-linePicúIncised. 
Motifs and Icons. Technically, the terms motif and icon have different senses: a motif is a decorative or ornamental design or the pattern created by that design; an icon is an image of something(oftenreligious)that has meaning(s), whichare frequently semantic.Icons aremotifs with signi.cant symbolic loading. Both may be symbols or pictograms—that is, exhibiting similarity between form and meaning (iconicity). Complexdecorativearrangements(of motifs and layouts) maybe considered symbolic codes. 
PostclassicMaya decorated pottery displayed numerous motifs and icons, some of which are localized and regionalized expressions of the Postclassic International style and symbol set, also seen in murals (Boone and Smith 2003). Othersare drawn froma durablelowland repertoire and some also appeared on earlier Classic polychromes. The motifs on the Tayza pottery aregrouped into four categories: glyphs, geometric, naturalistic, and abstract-cursive (see Rice 2017a). 
Glyphs include glyph-likeelements,and com­prise day signs (e.g., Ajaw), solar and lunar disks,Venus/starsymbols, and curls, hooks, and volutes that may relate to .owers or feathers (Figure4a).Theytypically appearin bandedand paneled layouts. The “supernatural eye” icon, also known as theGodM(god of trade) name glyph, consistsofascrolledU-shape withacircle (the pupil)intheinteriorloop.Widelydistributed in Mesoamerica and resemblingZapotec Glyph C,it pertainstodeities, serpents,andVenus/stars. The RE or reptile-eye glyph is a left-facing pro.led head showing an eye and topped with a curledfeather or crest (Figure4c).A well­knowndaysignin highlandMexico,theREicon typically appears onIxpop Polychrome vessels on Flores and elsewhere. Thewovenmat(pop), a distinctive icon of Maya royal regalia since Classictimes (Robiscek 1975),isalsoa“month” name and symbol of the seat of power. Rare in theInternational/Mixteca-Puebla symbol set, mats and relatedtwists and knotstypically occur in quadripartite banded decoration, painted or incised,and frequentlyas separatorsorboundary markers(Figure4d–f). 
Geometricmotifsmaybe angularor rounded. Angular motifs typically but not invariably occur in bands; they may be painted red

or black or incised. Rounded motifs—circles, ovoids,U-shapes—may be plain, concentric, or embellished with dots(Figure5a, b), and may representwater,eyes,jade, orvegetal elements. 
Naturalistic motifs include snakes, reptiles, birds, humans, and vegetation(Figure6a, b). Snakes and reptiles, oftenindistinguishable and frequently part of composite creatures that includeavianelements,suchasbeaksor feathers, arerelatively common. They are likelylocal or regional variants of the supernatural feathered serpent from the International painting style. Birdsare shownaspro.le heads with largecurv­ing beaks, suggesting raptors, parrots, macaws, or the curassow.4 Featheryelementsfrequently accompany all these creatures. Humans, body parts, and varied animals are well-known in the International stylebut rare on Petén pottery. 
Abstract-cursivemotifs, dif.culttocharacter­ize, are primarily ornate, curvilinear elements similar to those of the distributive style but occurring in isolation or as embellishments of rectangular “plaques”(Figures5c,6c). Some maybefeathersorvegetation. Generally uncom­mon, they tend to appear in Sacá Polychrome-type pottery. 
SpatialDistributions. Itis herethat the .ndings of this project becomemosttenuous becauseof small and non-probabilistic samples(see note3), making statistical analysis inappropriate. Most motifs were distributed throughout the island, albeit in low frequencies, but some gross gen­eralizations about quadrants can be put forward, especially in concert with other information (Rice 2017a, 2017b). 
The ceremonial core of the island, its ele­vated center,yielded commonIxpop Polychrome and Picú Incised types. Incising often features feathers as primary or secondary motifs, or trianglesand twistsin encircling bands(Table2; Figure4f).Twoexamplesofan unusual,heavily decorated Picú chaliceformwitha pedestal base camefromthe center,along with commonef.gy censer fragments. 
In the north, pottery decoration seemed to emphasizeblack-painted Ixpop Polychromewith reptile motifs, including the RE glyph. Sacá Polychrome and Macanché Red-on-paste were rare.Two moldsfor formingef.gy censerfaces were found in the northwest quadrant, which also yielded more pottery and more elaborate decorationthan the northeast(e.g., Figure5e), althoughthismightbeaconsequenceof minimal sampling of the latter. An excavation at the extreme northern edge of the island recovered abundantfauna, several chert points, andabro­kengrinding stone fragment used asa pounder, suggestingthe areawasinvolvedin cooking or butchering. 
Beautifully painted Sacá Polychrome and its varieties are common in the southern part of theisland, with unusual formsincluding dome-shaped lids(Figure6c) and .aring-sided basins (Figure6b),often decorated on bothinterior and exterior surfaces. Some Sacá vessels displayed thedistributivestyleof decoration characteristic of theKowoj CCPware,but with motifs painted redrather than black. Mats and twists areslightly more evident in the south.

What Do Itza Pottery Styles and Motifs 
Mean? 

Despite the limitations of the sample, this overview of spatial variability in slipped and decorated Postclassic pottery on Flores Island provides hints of the social and functional dif­ferentiation ofthe poorly understood Petén Itza capital. I suggest that the southeast was occu­piedby royal elites, thesouthwestprobablyby non-royal nobles, and the north by persons of lesser status. The center was primarily civic­ceremonial.The most elaborate decoration, such as variants ofSacá Polychrome with innovative layoutsand color useorMacanché Red-on-paste, wasprimarily seenin thesouth,but nospeci.c motifspredominated.

The SIP types and decoration seen in the northern part of Tayza are similar to those of the pottery recovered at mainland sites in the Lake Petén Itzá basin(Table3). The dearth of decorated potteryat mainland sites, .rst notedby GeorgeCowgill(1963:43,Tables5and6),was also observedinmorerecentexcavationsat Ixlu in the east(Rice and Rice 2016:81),atNixtun­Ch'ich’in thewest(Chak'an Itza territory), and on the islands in Lake Quexil (see Shiratori et al. 2011). Throughout this area, decoration on black-painted Ixpop Polychrome and the rare Pek Polychrome(Augustinegroup)favored symbolically loaded reptilianicons (Chase and Chase 1983:Figure 25b; Rice 1987:Figures 43, 44a–c) or more neutral motifs such as glyph­likeelements.The complexdesignstructuresand motifs ofSacá Polychrome variants seen on the island, forexample, arelacking. This differential occurrence may be explained by Wobst’s pro­posals about stylistic messaging; thewidespread reptile imagery illustrates his proposition that easily recognized symbols carry informationthat identi.es largegroupsoverlarge areas. 
Butwhatexplains thedifferential occurrence of decorativetypes and motifs between northern and southernsectorsofTayza? One easy answer is economic:Ixpop Polychrome and Augustine Red monochrome vessels might have been less “costly” (in resources or producer time) than multicolor painted or .ne-incised pots. Thelatter would have been less accessible to the lower-status populations in the north of the island (and thoseonthe mainland,whomay alsohave been of lower status). Or, perhaps the highly decorated ware was speci.cally denied to non-nobles. Or, the producers of the fancy vessels used by elites and in temple ritual may have been so-calledattached specialists, enjoyingthe patronage of the Itza royals. Again, Wobst’s propositions arerelevant:intense stylistic mes­saging correlates with larger social networks among the elite and broad visibility outside the household(particularly around theAjaw’s residence). 
Further insights come from the “visual rhetoric”of this pottery.If wetakethe position that styles are modes of expression and com­munication, we must address questions about the content of the messages and the identi­ties of senders and recipients. Who formatted the meaning, selecting the signs and images—

the inferred elements of rhetoric—and deter­mined theirlocationon Petén Postclassicvessel surfaces? The differential spatial distributions of the decorated pottery suggest not only that variable information or messages were being sentbut alsothat theintended audiencesvaried, raisingissuesof power. 
Following semiotechnological concerns with “regimes of the production and circulation of meaning” (Langlois 2011:1), we can investigate thepower formations that mobilized thesymbols and styles. Postclassic Petén potters and deco­rators were probably male, as potters were in colonial northern Yucatán (Clark and Houston 1998:34, 37), among the Lacandon (McGee 1990:51; Soustelle 1937:39), and in theClassic period (Reents-Budet 1994;Rice 2009).They were membersofaninterpretivecommunity that possessed a powerful visual rhetoric of shared beliefs—Sonja Foss’s (2004:307) underlying “concepts, ideas, themes, allusions,” or mean-ings,inotherwords—that theyactivated through motifsand layouts.This rhetoric includedvocab­ularies of design structures and icons with his­tories dating back into theClassic period, such as quadripartite bands, red and black colors, mats, and certain glyphs;othersdrawn fromthe Quetzalcoatl cult, such as reptile heads and RE glyphs; and still others fromthe Late Postclassic International paintingstyle.Decoratorsmayhave also possessed a degree of hieroglyphic literacy that would have informed use of some of the motifs. 
If we consider Petén Postclassic decorated potterytobea “meaning-full” semiotechnology, what were the power relations underlying the production and circulationofits meanings?Itza potters may have produced elaborately deco­rated pots and unusual forms speci.cally for elite patrons at the island capital. Circulation of these items may have been restricted, given that such highly decorated wares are rare at mainland sites. Patrons may have encouraged stylistic innovation and the potters mayhavefelt freetoinnovate, perhaps competitively,creating the numerous decorativevariantsofSIP pottery recoveredatTayzabut absent elsewhere. These innovations, which potters creatively negotiated by combining them with traditional, timeless vesselforms, colors, layouts, and icons, can be construed as elites asserting new af.liations and sources of political power. 
Themostdramatic innovationin Petén Post-classic pottery was the Kowoj’s creation of the red-painted, swirly, distributive style (Rice 1979). The circumstances of this style’s origins are unclear,but theLate Postclassicwasatimeof expansion, in-migration,factionalism, and grow­ing hostilities between Kowojs and Itzas. This highlights anotherofWobst’sproposals:in times of competition and social stress, group-speci.c styles will be mobilized to signal af.liations, statuses, and boundaries. I consider the later adoption of this style in the Itzas’ SIP ware (Macanché Red-on-paste:Macanchévariety) to re.ect theKowoj–Chak'an Itzafactional alliance. 
One avenue to understanding the circulation of meaning—and the semiotechnological and rhetorical meaning of the decoration itself, as well as its active agency within sociopolitical networks—relatestocontexts.Contexthere con­cerns both the spaces on the vessel surfaces on which the embellishment appears and the sociopolitical contingenciesin whichthese con­tainers were mobilized. Decoration on serving vessels’interiors transmits messages that canbe decoded by members of the interpretive com­munity who are using or are physically close to the vessel, manipulating or consuming the contents. Butsuch informationwouldhave been obscured by those contents(unless they were clear liquid)andlargelyinvisible untilthevessels were emptied. Exterior decoration, particularly its structure, displays information not only to persons nearby but also to those viewing the pottery from a greater distance, which might include those outside theinterpretivecommunity. Onvessels with restricted ori.ces,forexample, decorationis onthe exterior. 
On the large bowls and basins in the south­east quadrant, this decorative rhetoric appeared on both interior and exterior, suggesting more forcefuland simultaneous proclamationofvaried identities,af.liations,andpowertoan audience. These vessels might have been used in the kinds of “diacritical feasts” described among the ClassicMaya(Tokovinine 2016:25; seeLeCount 2001), or possibly larger inclusionary affairs. Similarly, theintricate .ne-lineincising of Picú Incised may appear on both interior and exte-

rior,making themessages especially complex to decode. This may re.ect the visually restricted and privileged use of the vessels in the cere­monial center of the capital, with locally (i.e., priestly)speci.c themes, perWobst. 


Conclusions 
This essay has examined the styles—design structures, colors, motifs, and icons—and mean­ings of decorated Postclassic pottery made and usedby the Postclassic-and contact-periodItzas of central Petén, Guatemala. Tayza was the island capitalofthepowerful and pluralistic Itza kingdom, its residents interacting with immi­grants, trading partners, and neighboring—often antagonistic—ethno-linguistic-political groups. Theislandwassaidtobeoccupiedby provincial governors(and theirfamilies and retinues), and large pottery vessels played conspicuous rhetor­ical roles in civic-ceremonial activity. These objects, prominent in serving sizeable groups, visually communicatedpowerbytheirsheer size and elaborate decorations. 
Style has been de.ned as practice, as “a way of doing”(Hegmon 1992:517–518),butI seeit also asa “way of meaning.”Thevaried spatial distributions of pottery styles on the noj peten, as brought to light through this unsatisfactory— but nonetheless unique and culture-historically signi.cant—sample, provideapreliminary basis forinterpretingmeanings.The central and south­ernsectorsyielded greater quantitiesofboth pot­tery in general and pottery with more elaborate decoration, particularly in the southeast. Such decoration—onvesselinteriors andexteriors— wasraretononexistentatItza mainlandsites.The stylisticcomplexitylikelyrelatesto multilayered identitiesofresidentsof(and visitorsto)the Itza capital, and probably helped theItzas andKowojs confront the complexitiesoftheirworld. 
The southeast quadrant is particularly inter­esting as the proposed location ofthe residence of AjawKanEk'.Throughout thesouth,butespe­cially in the southeast, the colors, layouts, and motifsonSIP pottery were singularly emblem­atic of Itza supremeleadership.Meanings were conveyed internally to users and externally to a viewing audience of visiting elite “others.” Rhetorically, the pottery communicated mes­sages of elite or royal status, wealth, power, legitimacy, and singularity. 
The northern part of the island displayed fewer but locally and regionally signi.cant motifs (primarily reptilian—signifying some identi.cation with the feathered serpent cult— and mats) and more traditional colors and design structures,suchas Ixpop Polychrome. Moreover, Ixpop is the most common decorated type at Itza mainland sites. This traditional, conserva­tive, banded layout and associated motifs pro­claimed a collective Itza ethnopolitical sense of “us” throughout the Lake Petén Itzá basin. Rhetorically,Ixpop’s “meaning”wasintegrative, reinforcingthe enduring politico-religiouspower of the regionally feared Itza confederacyand its leadership.Itcommunicated Itza identity. 
The pottery and related materials on which this preliminary study is based were, unfor­tunately, recovered under less than ideal cir­cumstances and thus the conclusions that can be con.dently drawn are limited. Nonetheless, the multipronged theoretical and methodolog­ical approach to interpreting decorative style developed here is applicable to a variety of circumstances whereintenseurban construction precludes extensive, systematic archaeological investigations.Minimally,this approach and sim­ilar attention to serendipitous .nds can be used to develop hypotheses that can later be tested, should such opportunities appear, whether at Tayza or at other, similar urban sites. In the case of Tayza, to ignore this material because of lackof proper provenience controlswouldbe to disregard a signi.cant complement to sparse Spanish documentary sources on the contact-period Itzas, and to ignore a rare glimpse into the material and visual culture of the capital of thelastMaya kingdom tofall to the Spaniards.

Notes 
1. 
On the other hand, a physical sign is a permanent record, “whereas the phonetic form of an utterance is only rememberedforashorttime;inmost casesthestructureofthe sign itselfisforgottenas soonasthemessageis understood” (Wildgen 2004:145n8). 

2. 
Maya Blue pigmentisa combinationofpalygorskite (formerly attapulgite) clay with indigo(Indigofera tinctoria) dye.Although palygorskiteisknownfrom northernYucatán, asource alsoexistsinthe LakeYaxhá basin(Cecil 2010). 

3. 
Horizontal andvertical provenience data were incon­sistently recorded becauseexcavations were primarily carried out by heavy machinery, monitored by local professional and student archaeologists. Horizontal proveniences were recordedby street nameandsometimesby houselot number or telephone pole number. Vertical provenience data are largely nonexistent,even where.oorswereencountered,and Imade no attempt to incorporate such information. The lack of stratigraphy and dating means that the more than 700 years of the Postclassic and contact periods are collapsed into a single moment. My priority was maximizing number of contexts reviewed,rather than analytical depth, andIdid not consistently count sherds, types, or varieties, since my primary interest was in decorative motifs and layouts. My sample,in otherwords,isa haphazardconvenience sample of whateverwas accessibleatthe timesI wasin Flores. 

4. 
Theappearanceofbirdsmayrelatetothe titlesofthree Itza lords, which incorporated the word tz’o, “male turkey.” 

5. 
“Serpent temples” at Chichen Itza and Mayapan had sculpted serpent heads at the top or base of stairway balustrades. The Flores head suggests that either Kan Ek' had a serpent temple near his residence or the sculpture had fallen(orwas pushed)downthesteepslopefromtheelevated plaza.
