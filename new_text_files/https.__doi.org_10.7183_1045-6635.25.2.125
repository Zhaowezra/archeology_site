Ceremonial architecture of late precontact (AD. 600-1500) societies of Puerto Rico consists of stone-lined plazas and ball courts (bateys). Archaeologists use these structures to signify the onset of hierarchical "chiefly" polities and to interpret their regional organization. Problematically, little consideration is given to the costs of their physical construction and the associated organizational implications at local and regional scales. In this paper, we use data gathered through geoarchae­ological field investigations to develop labor estimates for the plaza and bateys at the site ofTibes-one of the largest pre­columbian ceremonial centers in Puerto Rico. The estimates provide a basis for addressing how these features were constructed at the site and are considered within the broader organizational contexts of incipient polities in the island's south-central region between AD. 600 and AD. 1200.

Los resultados son considerados dentro de las contextos amplios organizacionales de estas entidades poUticas en la region sur-central de la Isla entre los aiios del 600 y 1200 d.C.

hen the Spanish arrived in the Greater WAntilles at the end of the fifteenth cen­tury, they documented the political or­ganization of the indigenous Amerindians as a series of cacicazgos (or chiefdoms) under the centralized leadership of caciques (or chiefs) (de Las Casas 1951 [1527-1565];0viedo1975;Pane 1999 [1505]). In Puerto Rico, the material mani­festation of these chiefly polities is considered evident in the remains of public ceremonial ar­chitecture, represented by stone-lined plazas and ball courts (or bateys). These structures are central to archaeological interpretation of the cacicazgo 
because they are thought to represent centralized political authority, both in terms of the power necessary to appropriate the labor for their con­struction, as well as the control over access and use for ritual activities (Alegria 1983; Rouse 1992; Siegel 1999, 2011). 
Researchers often link the construction of plazas and bateys to the motives and actions of self-aggrandizing individuals who sought to pro­mote their status and power over other commu­nity members (Siegel 1999). By extension, ar­chaeologists use the spatial distribution of plazas and bateys to envisage a hierarchical political

landscape based on variation in the number, size, and structural complexity of these features be­tween coeval sites (Oliver 1998; Siegel 1999; 2011; Torres 2005). However, questions persist regarding the full range of activities associated with these features, as well as the social contexts and consequences of their development, espe­cially in the centuries prior to colonial Spanish written records where they are first documented (Curet and Torres 2010; Rodriguez 2007). Criti­cally, the primary measure of power and authority attributed to these features-the labor utilized to construct them -is generally assumed and has never been sufficiently quantified and discussed within the relational contexts of the social com­munities who built and used them. 
To redress this issue, we calculate the primary labor investment, the hand transport of stone, for the construction of the plaza and batey features at the Ceremonial Center of Tibes (PRPOOI) in Ponce, Puerto Rico (Figure 1). Tibes is one of the largest and architecturally complex multi­plaza and batey sites on the island-and in the Greater Antilles in general . During its heyday (ca. A.D. 600-1 200) Tibes was at the heart of a burgeoning political landscape in the south-cen­tral portion of the island (Curet and Stringer 2010; Torres 2010, 2012). By focusing our attention on Tibes, we provide a basis for explaining how these structures were built and a context for con­sidering how the ceremonial features at Tibes, and other coeval sites in the region, functioned at different social scales. 
In the first portion of this paper, we provide an archaeological and historical overview of plazas and bateys in Puerto Rico. This is followed by a cultural-historical overview and a discussion of the social dimensions of public architecture in terms of labor, scale, and use to situate this study within broader research perspectives. We then give a summary of Tibes and the relevant histor­ical developments for its immediate region be­tween A.D. 600 and A.D. 1200. Details of the lithological study constituting the sample of data, and the methods used for calculating labor for plaza and batey construction at the site, are then

presented. The final section of this paper explores the implications of our findings as relevant to Tibes and its contemporaneous settlement region. 
Our study indicates that the structures at Tibes were built using readily available resources with no specialized or full-time labor force. The struc­tural features at Tibes were likely constructed through a series of discrete building episodes with labor donated from households occupying coeval settlements within the surrounding settle­ment region. We also suggest that Tibes was a high-level integrative facility (Adler and Wilshusen 1990) constructed within the contexts of "festive" communal labor relations (Kolb and Snead 1997), rather than under coercive or forced conditions. Situated in relation to other proximally related plaza and batey sites in the region, a more fluid system of social and political relations emerges than heretofore conceived during a cru ­cial phase of the island's precolonial history. 
Plazas and Bateys: 
Archaeological and Historic Contexts 

Since the early twentieth century, plazas and bateys have served as focal points of scholarly inquiry and continue to form the basis for ar­chaeological interpretation of political evolution in Puerto Rico and the Greater Antilles generally. The following discussion offers a brief overview of these features as evident in Puerto Rico. For a comprehensive review, the reader is directed to Barnes and colleagues (1999), Curet and Stringer (20 IO), Curet and Torres (20 IO), Gonzalez (1984), Oliver (1998, 2007), Rodriguez (2007), Siegel (1996, 1999, 20IO, 20 11), and Alegrfa's classic study Ballcourts and Ceremonial Plazas in the West Indies (Alegria 1983).' 
Archaeologically, plazas and bateys in Puerto Rico primarily consist of stone-lined enclosures typically square or rectangular in shape.2 They are generally composed of two single, parallel stone rows-appearing as partially buried cob­bles/boulders or upright slabs, or as alignments lying flat like a pavement (calazadas)-that en­close a cleared open space (Figure 2). While these different forms are documented throughout the sequence of their construction (ca. A.D. 600­
1500), upright tabular slabs appear to be more common after A.D. 1200. The spatial distribution of these stone-lined plazas and bateys in the Greater Antilles predominately ranges from east­ern Hispaniola to the Virgin Islands, with the highest frequency of structures documented in Puerto Rico. 
The historical basis for our knowledge of stone-lined plazas and bateys in the Greater An­tilles primarily comes from documents written by Spanish chroniclers at the time of European contact in reference to the Antillean ball game (de Las Casas 1967; de Oviedo y Valdes 1959 [1526]). Sixteenth-century chroniclers describe the ball courts and the game, both called batey, as central architectural and social features of in­digenous settlements. Oviedo notes the ubiquity of these features, remarking that "in every village there was a place set aside ... for a ball game (de Oviedo y Valdes 1975:104). De Las Casas also documented these features within settlements, stating: 
there was a large clearing, better swept and smoother, longer than wide, which in the tongue of these islands they called batey.... There were other houses too very near to this clearing, and if the town was very large, there were other clearings or courts for the ball game which were of lesser size than the main one .... [cited in Alegria 1983 :8]. 
De Las Casas provided one of the best physical descriptions for bateys, noting their dimensions as approximately three times longer in length than width (1967:350). Based on this description, stone-lined features are generally considered bateys if they are rectangular in shape, and those of other shapes (e.g., square or circular) are often categorized as plazas, since they are considered to be better suited for different types of communal activities not necessarily associated with the An­tillean ball game (Curet and Torres 20 10:262). 
Recent research has further highlighted varia­tion in structural form of these features throughout the island (Curet and Torres 2010:262-264; Ro­driguez 2007). For instance, some structures con­sist of a simple, single row of stones with one or more sides bounded by natural rock formations. Other shapes of plazas are also noted, consisting of square and (a limited number of) circular struc­tures. Considerable variability is also present in the documented number and size of structures

within a given site, ranging from small, single stone enclosures under 100 m2 to large multi­structure complexes like Tibes and Caguana (Ale­gria 1983; Oliver 1998, 2007; Oliver et al. 1999; Rodriguez 2007; Siegel 1999, 2011). 
Regardless of variation in shape and size, re­cent research underscores the potential functional variability in the use of these structures and has scrutinized the overreliance of ethnohistoric analogs dependent upon the ball game for inter­pretation (Rodriguez 2007). Archaeological re­search, in conjunction with ethnohistoric and ethnographic documentation, presents strong ev­idence that, in addition to the ball game, if not more so, plazas and bateys were utilized for a variety of performance-based ritual activities, also known as areytos (or are{tos). The areytos are communal song and dance performances linked to ritual practices of ancestor veneration that entailed the retelling of myths and the dis­semination of social memories (Oliver 2009; Siegel 1999; Stevens Arroyo 2006). 
In this research, we are guided by perspectives of these features provided in recent research by Rodriguez, according to whom 
a batey can be taken as an open space delin­eated by stones or earthen embankments, used to conduct ball games or related various activ­ities subsumed under the term arefto. Bateyes, by virtue of activity and the type of activities described to have been conducted within them, can be interpreted as spaces for action [Rodriguez 2007: 2]. 
Hence, for the purposes of this study, we use the term "batey" to refer broadly to all stone-lined enclosures, generally referred to collectively as plazas and ball courts. The term "plaza" is, to a lesser extent, also used in this study with partic­ular reference to stone-lined features that do not conform to a rectangular shape and to specific structures that have been previously documented and referred to as "plazas." These spaces are here assumed to have served a variety of functions as­sociated with communal socio-ritual activities in­dependent of the Antillean ball game. 
The first scholarly research on plazas and bateys was conducted by Augustin Stahl in the late 1880s. Stahl identified several stone-lined structures and provided an interpretation of their function based on Spanish ethnohistoric accounts (Stahl 1889). Later, Jesse Walter Fewkes (1907), also relying heavily on Spanish accounts, supplied some of the earliest anthropological research re­garding the existence and function of these fea­tures on the island. Many of the ideas and obser­vations noted by Stahl and Fewkes were later substantiated by J. Alden Mason's (1941) work at Caguana (PRUAlO) in 1915. Caguana, located in the modem municipality of Utuado, in the is­land's central mountainous region, was the first complex. multi-structure site intensively studied in the Greater Antilles. Mason documented sev­eral stone-lined enclosures at the site, many with elaborate petroglyphs (see Oliver 1998 for overview). Mason's excavations also revealed a series of landscape modifications indicating sev­eral construction episodes of building and re­building features.' 

During the 1930s and 1940s, Froelich Rainey (1940) and Irving Rouse (1952) documented plazas and bateys at several sites; however, no effort was made at that time to study these sites within broader regional contexts. Based on the early findings of Mason, Rainey and Rouse as­sociated these features with the late precontact era (ca. AD. 1200-AD. 1500) (Curet 2010). This was in part due to the fact that the majority of the sites initially documented with these features pos­sessed Chican Ostionoid style pottery. However, this observation was likely more a result of im­balances in the frequency of sites from this later period possessing such features and their archae­ological visibility. It was not until archaeological investigations at Tibes that the existence of stone­lined features predating A.D. 1200 was formally recognized (Curet 2010; Gonzalez 1984). 
The existence of sites predating AD. 1200 with plazas and bateys was later supported by excava­tion at other sites in the region surrounding Tibes. Specifically, radiocarbon dates were recovered from the site of El Bronce (PRPO 11), suggesting construction of a single batey at the site sometime around AD. 800 (Robinson et al. 1985:33), and at the site of Las Flores (PRCOOl) indicating con­struction of a plaza/batey there as early as AD. 600 (Wilson 1991). Over the past 25 years addi­tional sites possessing these features have been documented in the region that appear to predate AD. 1200 (e.g., Garrow et al. 1995; Robinson

2004; Rodriguez 1985; Torres 2012). While precise dating of the construction of plazas and bateys generally remains elusive, due to the complexity of associated midden deposits and formation process associated with construction, use, and mod­ification (Siegel 2011), there is little doubt that so­cial groups in southern Puerto Rico were actively building these structures by at least A .D. 800. 
Alegria's study was the first modern synthesis of plazas and bateys in the Caribbean (1983). Since Alegria's publication, several others have studied the distribution of these features throughout the island, including Gonzalez (1984), Rodriguez (1 985), Siegel (1999), and, most recently, Ro­driguez (2007). Currently, there are approximately 150 documented sites with these features on the island (see Rodriguez 2007 for comprehensive list), largely as a result of cultural resource man­agement actions since the 1980s. Recent discov­eries include the highly politicized finds of Jacana (PRP029) in Ponce (Espenshade and Young 2012), and it is anticipated that more sites with these fea­tures will be identified in the future. 
The cultural origin of plazas and bateys in Puerto Rico is currently a matter of speculation. Alegria (1983) suggests that they were likely the result of Mesoamerican influences that diffused through lower Central America to northeastern South America, eventually reaching the Greater Antilles. Recent research alludes to morphologi­cal and structural similarities between Puerto Ri­can plazas and bateys and stone pavements doc­umented in Costa Rica (Rodriguez 2010, 2011; Rodriguez and Pagan 2006; Wilson 2007). In conjunction with similarities between large, plaza­like, stone-lined features from the two regions, other congruencies in stylistic attributes amongst contemporaneous artifact assemblages support a potential historical connection between Puerto Rico and the Isthmo-Colombian region (Ro­driguez 2010). However, the nature of these re­lationships, the development of Puerto Rican stone-lined structures, and the reasons for the in­ception of socio-religious practices associated with them remain unknown. 
In addition to function and origin, there is also an ongoing debate as to whether or not these fea­tures are vacant or a part of occupied settlements (Curet and Torres 2010:270-276). While evidence exists to support both arguments (e.g., Espen­shade and Young 2012; Garrow et al. 1995; Oliver 1998, 2007; Rivera 1992, 1999; Rodriguez 2007), for the purpose of this research it is assumed that sites possessing these structures, at least for the era between AD. 600 and A.D. 1200 in the south­central region, were coterminous with domestic occupations -minimally, a few nuclear domestic units composing a small residential population. This assumption is based on recent in-depth analysis of settlement data from across the south­central region (Torres 20 12), where the majority of examples of sites with plazas/bateys are in di­rect association with domestic midden deposits (e.g., Krause 1989; Ortiz 1975; Robinson 2004; Robinson et al. 1985; Torres 2012). 
In many instances, petroglyph carvings are found on a number of stones composing these structures and tend to be more elaborate on those dating to the final period immediately preceding European contact (e.g., Caguana [Oliver 1998]; Jacana [Espenshade and Young 20 12]). In many cases, these features also demarcate public burial grounds of earlier Saladoid (ca. 400 B.C.-A.D. 500) populations. It has been posited that the de­
velopment of stone-lined bateys overlying these earlier burial grounds represents a continuation in the use of community spaces for ancestor wor­ship, the creation of communal histories, and the solidification of regionally diverse social identi­ties that ultimately became vehicles for political consolidation after A.D. 600 (Curet and Oliver 1998; Keegan 2009; Morsink 20 11; Rodriguez 2010; Siegel 1999, 2004, 2011; Torres 2012). 
Public Architecture: 
Labor, Function, and Scale 

Archaeological studies related to the construction of public architecture generally emphasize labor organization within the context of specialized economies in highly stratified or emerging state level societies (e.g.,Abrams 1987, 2010; Abrams and Bolland 1999; Blitz and Livingood 2004; Carmean 1991; Moseley 1975). Elliot Abrams has been the major contributor to this body of literature and to interpretations of the sociopolit­ical implications of architectural construction based on labor estimates. Abrams' work focuses on the detailed quantification of labor expendi­tures, including raw material acquisition, trans-

port, physical construction costs, and the roles of skilled laborers in architectural projects­primarily in Mesoamerica. His research empha­sizes the correlations between the scale of archi­tectural construction and sociopolitical and economic complexity, as well as the systemic di­mensions of status and power relative to labor organization (Abrams 1987, 2010; Abrams and Bolland 1999; Arco and Abrams 2006). For Abrams, labor associated with building construc­tion is fundamentally quantified in terms of cost, "with cost serving as the analytic unit of mea­surement upon which comparative assessments of power or status within and among archaeo­logical societies are based" (Abrams and Bolland 
1999:264). This perspective also has been well­presented for emerging chiefdoms in Chiapas, Mexico, by Blake (1991), based on communal labor donations for the construction of elite do­mestic structures. 
In the Caribbean, the hierarchical organization of regional settlements is generally assumed based on cursory examination of the distribution of sites and their associated plaza/batey sizes, with little research to quantify labor, use duration, or other underlying historical, social, and organizational factors beyond those directly connected with tra­ditional evolutionary models of societal devel­opment. For instance, a rank-size analysis based on the sizes of plaza/batey features from late pre­contact sites (ca. A.D. 1200-A.D. 1500) across the island shows a primate curve indicating a log­normal trend used to support a vertically hierar­chical system of regional power relations during this time (Siegel 1999: 20 11 ). However, the sam­ple used for the analysis is composed of a limited dataset and executed at temporal and spatial scales that arguably hide a more dynamic picture of local and regional sociopolitical relationships. 
From this vantage point, archaeological inter­pretation of plaza and batey features in ancient Puerto Rico is more about temporally fixed central places or locations from which power and author­ity are centralized and delegated outward to spa­tially related settlements, rather than identifying nodes in a historical network of social interaction. Lacking here is a concern for the dynamic and in­novative nature of social groups at finer scales and how they may have resisted drastic changes in authority, actively engaging in forms of self-governance. These are important factors for con­sidering the genesis of regional polities, where the composition and articulation of social com­munities, domestic and economic corporate groups, and ideological structures are interwoven and constantly emerging, rather than static societal conditions (as noted in Pauketat 2007). 
The primary truss upon which strict vertical political hierarchy in the region is based lies in interpretations that focus on actions of elite social actors and their desire for power (see Earle 1997 and Helms 1979 for overview of chiefdoms). Here, plazas and bateys are viewed as the direct result of the actions of powerful social actors who were able to mobilize substantive amounts oflabor under coercive or controlling circumstances for their own advantage (Alegria 1983; Ortiz 2009). From this perspective, elite members of individual settlements are, as Saitta (1994:204) cogently notes, "usurping, co-opting, preempting, or more frequently, controlling the surplus labor of depen­dent producers." This view is explicit in the work of Alegria, who states that the "labor force needed for the excavation of the courts, the construction of earth embankments, and alignment of stones required a powerful chief, as well as a society with a food surplus to sustain the laborers who were constructing the courts" (Alegria 1983:6). 

Problematically, the majority of documented plazas and batey features in Puerto Rico are quite modest (generally under 500 m2) and do not ap­pear to have required inordinate amounts of time and labor to construct. Further, small, public cer­emonial features are evident throughout the entire sequence of plaza and batey construction on the island and are ubiquitous during the late precon­tact era in the island's mountainous interior (Oliver 2007). Finally, many coeval sites pos­sessing these features are located in close prox­imity to one another, indicating that people may have had access to multiple structures at various sites and that these may have served different segments of broader social and settlement com­munities (Altes 2012; Torres 2012). 
Scale and Function 
Due to their conspicuous position within the land­scape and their role in communal ritual perfor­mances, plazas and bateys are indelible markers of public architecture. Like other forms of public

architecture in ancient societies, they form arenas for the negotiations of social and political life 
(e.g., Hegmon 1989) and are socially constructed places for the communication of communal his­tories and memories (e.g., Inomata and Coben 2006) that are intentionally and unintentionally created through their construction and use (Joyce 2004). These features also spatially structure the social landscape and regional interaction and re­flect scalar properties of social and political or­ganization through historically contingent patterns of routinized action (e.g., Heckenberger 2005; Tambiah 1979). Hence, examination of the scale of construction of public architectural features provides clues to their intended use and offers insight into the organization of the community that constructed them. 
Research by Kolb (1997) and Kolb and Snead ( 1997) defines three types of public architectural features based on several examples from mid­range societies. These examples help contextual­ize differences in public architectural projects: family, festive, and corvee. Each category implies differences in scale in terms of domestic labor relations and input, functional context, and use­group access. Family architectural features are the most frequent type encountered in the archae­ological record and include domestic structures and associated outbuildings, small agricultural works, and other features used for essential do­mestic activities. An important aspect of family­oriented labor works is that they generally lack bureaucratic involvement and are small-scale pro­jects in which labor is obtained from within the domestic kinship group (Kolb 1994; Kolb and Snead 1997). 
At the opposite end of the spectrum are corvee architectural projects, which are common in so­cieties where differences in status and privilege are ingrained. Corvee architectural features nec­essarily involve supra-family social groups that represent "monumental" labor investments (Kolb and Snead 1997). These projects often include large-scale agricultural works (e.g., canals and terraces), elite residences (e.g., Abrams 1987; Abrams and Bolland 1999; Carmean 199 1), de­fense systems, and monumental ceremonial ar­chitecture. Corvee labor is characterized by labor relations where organization is highly centralized and participation obligatory. In many cases, the labor force consists of a full-time specialized work force and/or craft specialists for their con­struction and maintenance (e.g., Abrams 1987, 1995, 2010; Moseley 1975). 
Between these two extremes are festive archi­tectural features. These are defined as larger than family or individual household labor projects but "not truly monumental in terms of overall labor input" (Kolb 1997:268). Here labor is organized between members of supra-village corporate groups and exchanged for things such as food, prestige, security, or rights of use or access (Kolb and Snead 1997; also see Wolf 1957). These ar­chitectural features may consist of local-level ritual facilities or other public works used at the level of the supra-village settlement social community. 
Identifying types of architectural features in­herently involves quantifying the amount of labor invested in their construction in relation to the or­ganizational scale of local populations . This pro­vides a context for determining function of the features and their relative communal labor invest­ment. While not all of the labor involved in the construction of such features may be readily ap­parent in the archaeological record (e.g., earth­moving activities, wooden elements in structures), such calculations provide a heuristic for contextu­alizing scales of labor mobilization (Kolb I 997) and organization of the local settlement community (Craig et al. 1998). "Fortunately, perfect knowledge of the construction process is not necessary to con­duct such an analysis. What is required is (1) a general knowledge of the elements of the building itself and (2) an identification of the major (i.e., most costly) activities responsible for those ele­ments" (Abrams and Bolland 1999:266-267). 
Scale also is contextualized through an exam­ination of structure size and the implied size of the use-groups associated with them. A key aspect related to the function of ritual structures in this regard relates to the types of public messages conveyed as part of their use, a point elaborated by Moore (I 996) in his study of public commu­nication in plaza ritual contexts in Peru. While Moore's study focuses on how the size of these features affects communication, it presents a thought-provoking case for considering variability in types of communal social interactions and use­group size based on the size of public architectural features.

The links between use-group size and function are also noted in a cross-cultural ethnographic study of middle-range societies in the Americas conducted by Adler and Wilshusen (1990). In their study, they note functional differences in public ceremonial architectural features, or "social integrative facilities" (Adler and Wilshusen 1990), whereby some facilities are meant to be used by an entire community, while others serve smaller portions of it. They identified two types of integrative facilities: "low-level" and "high­level." Implicit in their identification of scalar differences in the use of these public spaces are the differential labor relations associated with their construction based on the size and compo­sition of the groups using them. 
Low-level facilities describe those spaces and structures that serve to integrate only a segment of a community (Adler and Wilshusen 1990). These features are generally associated with small­scale architectural features constructed and used by households within a given residential settle­ment. They also note that these spaces tend to be more functionally generalized, serving a range of uses for both quotidian and ritual purposes. 
In contrast, high-level facilities are typically ritually specialized and utilized by relatively large use-groups that often include the members of several interacting, but separate, social and/or settlement communities (Adler and Wilshusen 1990). The formalization of these specialized fa­cilities does not necessarily imply an increase in the number of activities associated with them, but, rather, a decrease in their generalized function and overall quotidian usage (also noted by Ren­frew 200 1). In many cases, high-level ritual fa­cilities, in the form of ceremonial centers, are va­cant or inhabited by a small population that maintains the facilities and coordinates periodic communal gatherings (e.g., Adler 1989; DeBoer and Blitz 1991 ). Based upon the amount of labor required, the number of people involved in the construction, and specialized uses of the facilities in a single location, large-scale (or "monumen­tal") public works generally fall into this high­level category. Finally, using cross-cultural data, Adler and Wilshusen (1990: 143) were able to show a correlation between use-group size and facility size, with small low-level facilities typi­cally being used by fewer than 180 people and large high-level facilities being used by over 250 individuals. 
In the case of bateys in Puerto Rico, differ­ences in function and use-group size are readily apparent in the number of people they are physi­cally able to accommodate, based on the size of the site and the available space of associated plazas and bateys. As discussed below, the varia­tion in size and potential function associated with these public ceremonial features is the outcome of historically contingent process of settlement, interaction, and the organizational needs of local and regional social groups. 
The Ceremonial Center of Tibes 
Tibes is approximately eight kilometers from the southern coast of Puerto Rico, north of the mod­em city of Ponce. The site is on an alluvial terrace of the Portugues River in an area of physiographic transition between the coastal plains and dry in­termediate foothills. Ti bes was discovered in 197 5 in the aftermath of Hurricane Elofza, which flooded the Rio Portugues and removed surface deposition at the site, partially exposing several of the stone plaza/ball court structures. The So­ciedad Guaynia de Arqueologia e Historia exca­vated the site in the years following the discovery resulting in one of the first detailed studies of Tibes (Gonzalez 1984). 

The site is composed of several middens and nine plazas/batey structures that are discernible today (Figure 3, Table 1). Based on pottery and an associated suite of radiocarbon dates (Curet and Stringer 2010; Pestle 2010:440-455), it ap­pears that the features belong to the late phase of the site's occupation between A.D. 900 and A.D. 1200. It is possible, however, that some of the features were constructed prior to this time. 
Field investigations since 1995 at Tibes have produced a substantive dataset that is helping to advance understanding of site-and regional-level social and cultural change (Curet and Stringer 2010). Shovel testing at the site during initial phases of research identified at least eight large subsurface deposits. Subsequent excavations in­dicate that six of the deposits are domestic in ori­gin, with two apparently representing overburden and disturbed fill from batey construction. Exca­vations since 2003 , combined with several geo-

physical studies (Welch 2010), have helped to identify and delineate potentially distinct domestic and ritual activity areas. Specifically, investigation of anomalies identified in the geophysical survey revealed three loci associated with domestic dwellings that contained post molds of structures, a cooking area, and a domestic trash midden. 
It appears that Tibes was occupied as a resi­dential settlement throughout its history. How­ever, during its later phase of occupation it ap­pears to have been inhabited by a small number of households that likely maintained the site and facilitated and/or organized periodic events. While archaeological data from the site is cur­rently being processed and the size of the resi­dential population is under consideration, this supposition is supported by the size of domestic deposits and corroborated by recent research by Oliver (2007) on late precontact period settle­ments in Utuado, as well as several archaeological and ethnographic research projects from other re­gions (e.g., Adler 2002; De Boer and Blitz 1991). 
Due to the complexity of the site, the tempo­rality of construction activities at Tibes is still un­clear. It is possible that the structures were built simultaneously or as separate, discrete building events. Currently, it appears that some construction activities started sometime between A.D. 800 and 
A.D. 1 000 and that a major rearrangement of space occurred around A.D. llOO (Curet 2010; Curet et al. 2006). It is at this time that old trash middens were moved, some areas of the sites likely leveled, old stone alignments potentially removed, and new ones built. Recent studies also indicate that the early occupation began on the north side of the site near Batey 9. Subsequently, the density of de­posits gradually shifted south with time. Despite these changes, it appears that the area occupied by Plazas 6 and 7 remained the focus of the site's oc­cupants throughout its history. 
In addition to the batey features, earlier exca­vations yielded two clusters of burials (Gonzalez 1984): the first one is located under Plaza 6, the central, quadrangular plaza of the site, with the second one under Batey 3 (Figure 2). Both burial clusters primarily date prior to A.D. 900 (Pestle 2010) and thus appear older than the overlying stone structures. Other burials belonging to the Elenan Ostionoid subseries were found dispersed over the site, in most cases in domestic contexts (i.e., refuse middens and/or possible house floors), which is fairly typical of Ostionoid (ca. A.D. 600-A.D. 1200) mortuary patterns in Puerto Rico (Curet and Oliver 1998). 
Tibes and Regional Historical Setting 

Concomitant with the rise ofTibes, and the con­struction of its multiple plaza/batey features, were many changes in settlement and material culture throughout the surrounding region after A.D. 600 (and particularly after AD. 900) that point to ma­jor transformations in the organization of local and regional social groups. These changes in­cluded the rapid expansion of small residential settlements, the reduction in the size of domestic structures, regional diversification of pottery, in­tensification of ritual activity, and the proliferation of batey features at sites throughout the region 
(Curet 2005, Curet et al. 2004; Siegel 2004; Ro­driguez 1985; Torres 2005). 
Recent research posits that the explosion in the number ofregional settlements after A.D. 900 is linked to a dramatic increase in population that caused the emergence of new social networks (Altes 2012; Curet 2005; Rodriguez Ramos 2010; Siegel 2004; Torres 2001, 2012). One of the most important observations for this period is a settle­ment pattern characterized by distinct settlement clusters that aggregated within particular geo­graphic localities, often following drainage basins. Regional changes in population and set­tlement likely caused ambiguities in social rela­tionships that exacerbated differences between local community clusters (Torres 2005, 2010, 2012), stimulating territoriality which set the stage

for social and political tensions in the post-A.D. 600 landscape (Siegel 2004, 2011). 
At the same time, archaeological research from the region has observed a reduction in the size of households (Curet 1992; Kaplan 2009). While the reduction in size of the domestic unit and the establishment of persistently occupied settlements may have reduced some of the ambiguity related to persons and property in an increasingly popu­lous landscape (Torres 2012), maintaining social cohesion and order would have become extremely important. The resolution of this problem required the creation of new mechanisms to structure the engagements within and between communities and contribute to concretizing the position of in­dividuals and groups within broader regional so­cial networks. Material evidence for the partial resolution of this issue is considered evident in the construction of ritual integrative facilities in the form of bateys. 

Based on a late radiocarbon date and relative absence of pottery from later periods, Tibes ap­pears to have been abandoned or to have fallen into disuse shortly after A.D. 1300 (Curet 2010:56), although it is possible that small groups of people visited the site sporadically after this time. Bateys subsequently flourished in other parts of the island, particularly in the mountainous interior. Caguana (Oliver 1998) and Jacana (Es­penshade and Young 2012) are two examples of such sites that rose in importance during this later time. While the reasons for the abandonment of Tibes and the rise of other sites with public cere­monial architecture are unclear, it is apparent that this was not an isolated event, as many sites with these features in the southern foothills of Puerto Rico fell into disuse around the same time (Curet et al. 2004; Torres 2001, 2005). 
The Sample and Data Collection 
In 2001, two of the authors (M.J. Castor andA.K. Castor) completed a detailed survey of the boul­ders and large cobbles that were used in the con­struction of the plazas and bateys at Tibes. The objective of the original study was a statistical evaluation of the representation of different lithologies in the Tibes plazas and bateys, as com­pared to those in the present-day adjacent Por­tugues River bed and banks (the most convenient source of construction material). Results of the study indicated that there are statistically signif­icant differences in percent representation of lithologies between the structures and the river bed, and among the various plaza and batey struc­tures (Rice-Snow et al. 2010). 
The surveyed boulders compose the bulk of material making up the stone-lined structures at Tibes. However, some areas could not be sur­veyed because they were so overgrown with lichen that nondestructive evaluation of lithology was impossible. As a result, the census entirely excluded small stone-lined features 1 and 4, but included 50 percent of Plaza 7, 95 percent of Bateys 2 and 3, and I 00 percent of Plaza 6 and Bateys 5, 8, and 9. 
Individual boulder locations within the Tibes structures were documented with tape and com­pass from baselines running parallel to each of the long axes of each stone-alignment. The census included 5,548 boulders, individually recorded for size and lithology, resulting in an extensive dataset for the labor calculations used in this study. The detailed location information supports depiction of the survey results in the form of a "bubble graph," a map-view array of circles mark­ing boulder locations with color keyed to lithol­ogy and circle size keyed to boulder intermediate dimension. Figure 4 (see also Supplemental Fig­ure 1) shows survey results for Tibes Plaza 7 (Plaza de Estrella) and Batey 8 (Batey del Mur­cielago). An important observation here is that while in some places (e.g., the southwestern boundary of Batey 8) associations of boulder size seem deliberate, mixed lithologies, in varying proportions, are found throughout the structures. This seems to indicate that the size and shape of the boulders were more important in the structural design of the features than the position of litho­logical types within them. 
Due to the protected status of the plazas and bateys at Tibes, identification of the lithology of each boulder was performed on the basis of non­destructive "hand specimen" methods, mainly close visual examination. Fifteen distinct rock types were identified. Samples of all but one (see below) of these were retrieved from the nearby Portugues River bed. Thin sections were made from the river samples and examined with petro­graphic microscope to refine lithologic identifi-

cations. This work provided background for rapid visual interpretation of stone types during the large-scale census of Ti bes stones. 
Because many of the Tibes site stones are par­tially buried, a full examination of all three di­mensions of size was not possible. Hence, size is based on diameter, measured orthogonally be­tween the longest and shortest dimensions. Vol­umes for individual stones were then approxi­mated by taking the measured dimension values as equivalent spherical diameters. While this method works well for the stream-rounded, spher­ical, or oval-shaped stones present at Tibes, vol­umetri c dimensions for rectangular, slab-like

stones that are common at precontact sites (e.g., Caguana and Jacana) should be obtained using standard measures for volume for tabular solids, provided the buried portions of these slabs are known or estimated. Cobble and boulder sizes in Ti bes structures range from less than 10 cm to more than 90 cm. Mean sizes among the different lithologies range from 22 to 29 cm (Table 2). 
Density values were obtained for the diverse rock types at Tibes to support calculations of in­dividual boulder weights necessary for the labor estimates in this study. These measurements were made from river bed samples with between one and four rock samples tested per lithologic type. Sample dry weights were obtained on a laboratory balance, and volumes were determined by im­mersion of samples in a known volume container with water poured from a graduated cylinder. The volume values are essentially external volume measures, due to rapid reading of results and fairly low permeability of the rock types. Density values for lithologies vary between 1.8 and 2.9 g/cm3 (see Table 2). 
It should be noted that a single rock type found in the structures, calcareous sandstone, was absent in random and directed searches of the river bed and was potentially brought in by hand from more distant sources-potentially 5 km away. However, there is the possibility of a local unidentified source. This stone type was recorded only for struc­tures 2, 3, 6, and 7. The average weight of these stones for each structure was 25 .3 kg for Plaza 6 (n = 24), 21 .7 kg for Batey 7 (n 2), 11.8 kg for

= 
No calcareous sandstone was found in the survey of plazas 5, 8, or 9. The labor for carrying these stones, even if from 5-10 km away, is negligible compared to that for the mass of other boulders; however, their presence yields an important clue to the labor pool involved in the construction of these features that will be discussed shortly. 
Calculating Labor Estimates 
Labor in this study is measured in cost of human energy expressed in person-days (p-d). A "person" represents an individual laborer and "day" repre­sents time as a fraction of a 24-hour day (see Abrams 2010). Our labor estimate calculations are based on the classic work of Charles Erasmus who, in the 1960s, conducted field experiments in Tikul, Mexico, to calculate labor for the con­struction of the ceremonial site of Uxmal (Eras­mus 1965). Erasmus calculated labor by docu­menting the amount of time it took for several individuals to carry cut stone (weighing on aver­age between 23 and 34 kg) over several distance increments (250, 500, 750, and 1000 m). The ex­periment was carried out based on a five-hour work day, as labor parties in tropical climates both start and finish demanding physical activities early to avoid intense afternoon heat (Erasmus 
1965:283). For a five-hour day based on the dis­tance intervals, the amount of stone transported was approximately 950, 500, 517, and 250 kg per person per day (Erasmus 1965:286-287).4

To develop labor estimates in person-days we first calculated the approximate weights (i.e., mass) for each of the stones for each batey. This was done by first calculating the spherical volume for each stone using dimensions for diameter in centimeters: 
(v = 4/3 x Jt x r3) 
The volume of each stone was then multiplied by its specific density, yielding weight to volume (g/cm3), based on its lithology. This resulted in the approximate weight of each stone (g). Using this method, the total mass for all stones for each structure was calculated and converted to kilo­grams for subsequent calculations (Table 3). 
The Portugues River ranges between approx­imately 100 and 250 m from the center ofTibes. While ample material would likely have been available onsite and within the 250-m range, it is plausible that suitable stones for construction (i.e., stones that could be hand-carried from the asso­ciated river beds) would be quickly depleted, forcing the builders to travel farther in order to acquire transportable stone. Because of this, we used Erasmus's estimate for transporting stone .5 kilometers per person-day as a conservative estimate for the acquisition of construction ma­terial. As such, the total mass for the structure was divided by 500 kg to solve for the labor ex­penditures in person-days (p-d). 
Our estimates currently do not take into ac­count any site-leveling or earth-moving activities for the preparation of the plaza/batey surfaces because it is at this point difficult to determine what the original site surface may have been. We hope further excavations at Tibes will yield data to resolve this issue. Nonetheless, these activities are considered to be minimal in relation to the

transp01t and setting of stones for the construction of the structures. Further, it is hoped that the time potentially spent leveling ground surfaces may be somewhat offset by the slightly extended search radius used in estimating labor used to ac­quire building material . 
Results 
Based on our observations, we determine the con­struction of the plaza/batey features at Tibes to consist of ground-surface leveling of some areas, the simple transport of building material to the site, and setting stone by hand. There is no evi­dence to support the idea that specialized labor was required, that is, no masons or other craft specialists were necessary to construct these fea­tures. Further, there is no evidence to support the use of specialized mechanical devices (e.g., pul­leys, rollers, or sleds) in the transport or setting of stone. 
The idea of hand transport and undifferentiated labor is also supported when one considers the weight frequencies of the stones and temporality of building episodes. Examination of the weight frequencies shows that the majority of surveyed stones weigh 30 kg or less (n = 3738) (Figure 5). Of the total sample of surveyed stones, 21 .9 per­cent were between 0 and lO kg, 26.6 percent were between 10 and 20 kg, and 18.9 percent were be­tween 20 and 30 kg. In total, stones 30 kg or less account for 66.7 percent of the 5,548 surveyed stones. This weight has been noted in other stud­ies as ideal for individual hand transport of stone building material (Craig et al . 1998; Erasmus 1965). If we include stones weighing 40 kg or less, they account for 85 percent of the total sur­veyed sample. Stones of larger sizes would likely

have required multiple individuals to transport. However, it also may be likely that some of the larger stones, particularly those exceeding 100 kg (only 6.5 percent of the total sample), were already onsite and rolled or dragged short dis­tances for incorporation in the structures. 
Using the calculated estimates based on the sample of surveyed stones, the total mass for each surveyed structure was projected to 100 percent (see Table 3). Based on this calculation, the sur­veyed bateys at Tibes could have been constructed in approximately 465 p-d (Table 4). The highest calculated labor expenditures were for Plaza 6 (Plaza Principal), which we estimate to have taken approximately 195 p-d, and Plaza 7 (Plaza de Estrella), estimated at 109 p-d. Following these in descending level of effort are Batey 3 (Batey del Cerni), totaling 87 p-d, Batey 2 (Batey Her­radura) at 45 p-d, Batey 8 (Batey Murcielago) at 19 p-d, Batey 9 at 9 p-d (Batey del Cacique), and Batey 5 (Batey de una Hilera) at 1 p-d. 
It must be kept in mind that these estimates represent the total investment of each structure as a single p-d. Assuming that multiple individu­als constructed these features, the time necessary to build them would be inversely proportional to the number of laborers . If we increase the number of personnel, all of the stones for the surveyed structures at Tibes could have been acquired, transported, and set in place in approximately 93 days-slightly over three months-by 5 people or in 47 days by 10 people (see Table 4). 
Ifwe assume, based on these calculations, that all construction activities, including earth moving and building of non-surveyed features at the site, took two years of labor (730 p-d), then all of the batey features at Tibes could have been con­structed in 146 days by 5 people or 73 days by 10 people. If we further assume that the structures were not all built at the same time, but instead were unique construction events with potentially higher numbers of laborers (> 10) at any given point, the information begins to depict a series of brief construction events. This suggests that batey construction at Tibes did not necessitate long­term shifts in the everyday functioning of the local social groups that built them. For instance, food production and distribution is one aspect of social and economic life considered to have fun­damentally changed with the onset of plaza/batey

construction, based on the high level of effort previously assumed necessary for their construc­tion (Alegria 1983; Ortiz 2009). 
It should be noted that, in addition to the phys­ical building of the bateys, labor was also invested in post-construction modifications to a few of the stones in the form of petroglyphs; sixteen have been identified at Tibes. In comparison to petro­glyphs seen at sites like Caguana (Oliver 1998), El Bronce (Robinson et al . 1985), and, more re­cently, Jacana (Espenshade and Young 2012), those at Tibes are relatively modest in form and design. Recent experimental research by Espen­shade (2011) has shown that similar simple design motifs, such as those depicted at Tibes, could be replicated in a few hours using basic stone tools. 
Yet while the tools and skill to produce simple petroglyphs were readily available , not everyone produced them. Otherwise, we would expect many more stones at Tibes and on bateys at other sites to be decorated with petroglyphs. Hence it appears that only some individuals, perhaps those possessing specialized knowledge or authority, were allowed to create them and to modify the stones composing these structures. This generally supports current perspectives that, after A.D. 600 on the island of Puerto Rico, and perhaps other islands in the region, access to sacred symbolism and ideology was becoming restricted to particu­lar individuals and/or groups and limited to par­ticular functional contexts (Curet 1996; Oliver 2009). Pane (1999 [1505]) reported that in Santo Domingo powerful shamans carved ritual cemis. If we consider the petroglyphs to be a form of cemi (as noted by Oliver 2009), then only certain individuals within the community were able to control access to the creation and use of these symbols. Yet even though in this example we see the beginning of some restrictions on sacred knowledge, closer examination reveals that social groups had freedom to engage in their own ritual activities independent of high-level integrative facilities like Ti bes. 
Discussion 
What are the implications of our estimates for understanding the organization of social groups that used the plazas and ball courts at Tibes? How does this relate to the scalar use of these features, and what does this tell us about sociopolitical or­ganization in the region between A.D. 600 and 

A.D. 
1200? To address these questions, we first discuss possibilities for the composition and or­ganization of the labor groups that constructed the features at Tibes. We then contextualize this in relation to nearby coeval sites with plazas/bateys in the region in terms of function and use. Finally, we offer some insight into the organization of supra-village communities and the function of these structures within the political landscape of the south-central region between 

A.D. 
900 and A.D. 1200. 


While it is impossible to determine exactly how many people actually took part in the con­struction of the features at Ti bes, or whether they were constructed as single or multiple events , it is possible to offer some interpretations regarding the labor pool based on the relative scale of the construction and the intended function of the fea­tures. We believe that the batey features at Tibes were used for specialized communal purposes, and, as such, their construction required the do­nation oflabor from members of households from

the surrounding settlement community. 
Communal "donations" of labor to support lo­cal ceremony are quite common in mid-range so­cieties worldwide and are deemed necessary, in many cases, for the participation of households within larger communal collectives (Adler and Wilshusen 1990; Renfrew 2001; Rosman and Rubel 1986). Such access rights are seen in a va­riety of situations in which donations of labor link dispersed local settlements to one another through the construction of shared sacred public spaces (e.g., De Boer and Blitz 1991; Lekson 1999). From this perspective, it is not only the subsequent ritual and performative acts conducted within the spaces defined by these features that bind people in communal solidarity, it is also the construction process itself that fosters community identity and status. This phenomenon has been observed ethnographically (e.g., Tuzin 2001: 104­106) and is evident in a variety of archaeological contexts, including mound construction for late Mississippian societies in the American Bottom and in the structures at Chaco Canyon in the American Southwest (Pauketat 2007). 
Research on settlement patterns indicates that at least six settlements were occupied within 5­km walking distance from Tibes between A.D. 900 and AD. 1200, or during the time of the major building episodes at the site (Torres 2010, 2012). The majority of these settlements were small, likely consisting of two to five contemporaneously oc­cupied nuclear family households (Curet 1992; Espenshade 2000; Kaplan 2009; Torres 2012). Due to the small size of these sites, labor would have been donated from multiple households, perhaps under the leadership of a particular lineage head, social "house" (e.g., Gillespie 2000, 2007; Morsink 2011), or shaman (Oliver 1998, 2009), who may or may not have resided at Tibes. 
While it could be easy to make an argument for the sexual di vision of labor for this process­that is, men doing all of the physical labor while women cook food and watch over children ­there is no evidence to indicate that this was the case. In fact, due to the portable size of many of the stones, it is possible that women and adoles­cents could have contributed to the gathering and setting of stones. While this interpretation is spec­ulative, it offers an image of how such projects may have been executed by various members within the community. 
One piece of evidence supporting the donation of labor from satellite settlements outside of the immediate area of Tibes lies in the presence of the aforementioned non-local calcareous sand­stone present in several of the structures at the site. Examination of the mean weights of cal­careous sandstone cobbles at Tibes (n = 51) re­veals that the majority (74 percent) are under 20 kg, with only three weighing more than 50 kg. Stones of this weight would have been within the capability of human transport of 5 km in a single day by a single individual (Coterell and Kaminga 1990). In this context, these stones may have been special imported objects through which social groups from outside the local settlement community linked themselves to the sacred land­scape and communal identities materialized in the structures at Tibes. 
Returning to the topic of labor donations, our estimates for even a small number of laborers (> 10) indicate that the features at Tibes were con­structed within the normal range of annual non­corvee labor donations (ca. 40 days) noted for mid-range societies (Craig et al.1998; Erasmus 1965; Hogbin 1939). This suggests that construc­tion was not necessarily the result of physical or social coercion (i.e., corvee labor), but perhaps occurred under other social structures of obliga­tion whereby community members donated labor for security, status, identity, or pride. In fact, pre­vious research suggests that people in kin-based societies have the power to resist egregious labor demands of elite or privileged groups (Bender 1990). With this in mind, it seems that the con­struction of these features falls under what has been identified (Kolb 1997; Kolb and Snead 1997) as "festive" labor projects. This notion be­comes increasingly salient when one considers the scalar functions of these features within indi­vidual settlements and broader social and settle­ment communities.

gion, and politics. Significant differences in labor effort and potential function can be inferred through comparison of the larger features at Ti bes with the many small features in the immediate vicinity of the site (Table 5, Figure 6). These smaller structures indicate that they would have taken only a few days to construct with a limited number of individuals (n = 5). 
For example, the site of El Bronce, thought to have been primarily occupied between A.D. 700 and A.D. 1200 (Robinson et al. 1985:29-37), is located approximately 5 km southeast of Tibes. The site is much smaller than Tibes (ca. 50 x 50 m) with a single row of stones demarcating the eastern edge of a batey (Robinson et al. 1985). The batey area measures approximately 20 x 20 m and consists of 36 stones, many of which pos­sess highly elaborated petroglyphs (n 11) 
= 
(Robinson et al. 1985:11-116). The lithologies of the stones and their dimensions were documented during archaeological investigations at the site. These rock types are directly comparable to the stone lithological types documented for Tibes. Based on these data, the specific densities for each of the stones and their overall weights were estimated using the lithological data and methods used for Ti bes (Table 6) . 
Using the same methods to estimate labor, El Bronce clearly indicates that large amounts of la­bor were not required for its construction (2.9 p­d) . This level of effort is significantly different from that for virtually all of the features at Tibes and is more representative of construction effort exhibited for bateys at other sites in the immediate region (based on feature size), including P0-27, P0-42, P0-39, and G-15-01, which all would have taken only a day or two to construct with limited numbers of individuals.

tively minimal amount of energy required to build these smaller facilities indicates construction at the level of the residential settlement that did not necessarily require or use labor from surrounding settlements. Hence, smaller stone-lined structures were likely the product of labor invested by the households within a given settlement, falling within what has been defined as family labor pro­jects (Kolb and Snead 1997). 
Smaller bateys likely had multiple functions for the individual settlements themselves , acting as low-level integrative facilities (Adler and Wilshusen 1990) and serving a variety of quotid­ian and ritual functions. This idea has been pre­viously suggested for batey features in Puerto Rico by Rodriguez (2007) and Garrow (2006). Excavations conducted by Rodriguez Melendez (2007), at two late precontact batey sites in the mountainous interior (Sonadora and Muntaner) found no significant variation in artifact classes to suggest that these features were used for highly specialized ritual practices. Based on comparative analysis of pottery, lithic, and faunal remains from the two sites she concluded that 
the evidence for bateyes as elite installations is slight, and there is no evidence that suggests that either of these two sites was a ceremonial center ... bateys are interpreted not as locations for specialized rituals accessible to only a few, but as community social spaces familiar to the population at large [Rodriguez 2007:4] . 
Garrow also notes for the site of P0-39, lo­cated approximately 5 km northeast ofTibes, that there were probably different levels of ceremonial activity in the region and that not all ceremonies or celebrations required movement to Tibes or other high-level integrative facilities. For exam­ple, marriage, puberty rites, and intra-village con­flict resolution are a few of the possible village­based ritual functions these smaller features may have served (Garrow et al. 1995; Oliver 2009:41). 
Therefore, small batey features would have been constructed by members of individual set­tlements, while the larger, more labor-intensive features, such as those at Tibes, would have been

built by members from surrounding settlements . As the size of these features grew at particular sites, perhaps as a result of long-term use and/or the expansion local settlement communities, ad­ditional sources of labor would have been neces­sary to build them, so that individuals that con­structed low-level facilities may also have been involved in the construction of high-level inte­grative facilities. There are two important infer­ences stemming from these observations. 
First, sites with smaller batey features proxi­mal to Tibes suggest that they fulfilled a variety of functions for the individual settlement, with larger facilities used for broader community or intercommunity functions. Hence, we suggest that the daily regulation of ritual life was con­ducted at the scale of the individual settlement. By extension, the proliferation of low-level inte­grative facilities within smaller settlements after 
A.D. 600 indicates some level of ritual indepen­dence through the availability and access to these features within smaller segments of larger settle­ment communities. In contrast, larger, more elab­orate facilities would have promoted the com­munication of public messages and served larger groups in higher-level social and ritual capacities. 
This brings us to the second point. The pres­ence of so many lower-level facilities at different locations in the landscape demonstrates that in­dividuals within small-scale social groups had access to sacred knowledge , which is to say that these domains were not completely restricted. Hence, we posit that the sociopolitical and ritual system was decentralized, at least for the period between A.D. 600 and A.D. 1200, with little ad­ministrative control over local settlements and their daily activities-a point advocated by Oliver (2007) for Late Ceramic Age communities in the island's central mountainous region surrounding Caguana . 
While there is strong evidence to support the emergence of centralized political and religious authority (Curet 1996; Siegel 1996, 1999, 2010, 2011), this research indicates that small-scale so­cial groups in the south-central region surround­ing Tibes, and likely in other parts of the island during this time, were actively engaged in orga­nizing themselves and in developing institutions of authority, rather than their formation being solely an exclusionary process of elite control. This runs counter to previously conceived notions of political genesis in the region that depict a top­down model of organization and development focused on elite members of the community. 
From an organizational standpoint, the obser­vations presented here coincide with Gregory Johnson's (1982) model of sequential hierarchies. In a sequential hierarchy, lower-level organiza­tional units are grouped together into a higher­level entity, reducing the number of decision­making units and making it easier for multiple equally viable sociopolitical units to achieve con­sensus. From this view, people may arrange them­selves along various dimensions of vertical (hi­erarchical) and horizontal (heterarchical) complexity (Crumley 1995; 2003) that represent differing forms of organization. Here, social groups are able to structure their political alle­giances based on circumstances benefitting the group as variously constituted social, kin, or eco­nomic entities (Dietler and Hayden 2001; Dille­hay 2004; Ehrenreich et al. 1995). 
Hence, local social groups were not only a source of labor, but also a communal source of

power. With increased scarcity of land and abun­dance of available labor, as indicated by the re­gional settlement pattern and organization of do­mestic groups documented in previous research (Curet 1992; Torres 2012), labor was channeled into ideological power through the construction of plaza and batey features that served social and settlement communities at different scales. From this perspective, the construction of both small and large multi-batey complexes served to insti­tutionally codify the power, durability, and posi­tion of variously constructed social groupings at different scales (e.g., household, lineage, settle­ment community) . These need not conform to a strict vertical hierarchy, as depicted in previous research, but rather were likely more organic in nature and coincident with the historically con­tingent processes of settlement, shifting networks of social interaction, and the social construction of communal identities within a burgeoning and increasingly complex social landscape. 
Conclusions 
Plazas/bateys in Puerto Rico, and the Greater An­tilles in general, represent a central paradox in our understanding of the inception of political institu­tions in the region. Their development emphasizes, on the one hand, the formation of communal iden­tities and, on the other, the centralization of the social and political power of a small segment of society. While these processes are not independent, archaeological research in the region has typically treated them as such, with particular focus on emerging elites and an emphasis on traditional top­down models of regional political organization. These perspectives often assume that bateys were constructed as a direct result of the motivations of powerful individuals who usurped the labor of the community for their personal aggrandizement, with large ceremonial sites acting as "centers" of indi­vidual power and control . 
Despite this perspective, it is important to re­member that works of public architecture , and specifically ritual facilities, not only are important markers of regional sociopolitical organization, but also denote communal efforts to solidify so­cial relationships (Adler 1989; Hegmon 1989; Inomata and Coben 2006). Examination of the labor estimates at Tibes, contextualized by coeval structures at nearby sites between A.D. 600 and 
A.D. 1200, indicates a more fluid picture of so­ciopolitical relations than heretofore documented. 
Even though many questions remain unan­swered in this work, we feel that several conclu­sions can be made regarding the construction of the plazas and ball courts at Tibes and the sociopo­litical organization of the surrounding region dur­ing that time. Our research strongly indicates that Tibes was a high-level ritual facility primarily con­structed within the contexts of festive labor projects in which labor was donated from surrounding set­tlements. Based on current evidence, it appears that the site was home to a small residential popu­lation that maintained these features and perhaps organized periodic communal ritual events. 
The labor efforts used to construct the features at Ti bes were minimal . Our estimates indicate that all of the features at Tibes could have been constructed in just a few months with the labor of 10 individuals. Our data also suggest that these features may not have been constructed simulta­neously, but, rather, as discrete , sporadic con­struction episodes perhaps over a short period of time. Importantly, the construction of the features at Tibes was likely as important to the creation of inter-settlement communal identity and soli­darity as the subsequent activities performed in the structures themselves. 
It does not appear that the construction of these features put undue stress on local groups or that these were constructed under coercive or corvee circumstances. There is no evidence to indicate that labor specialists were present or that full­time craftsmen were necessary for the gathering and setting of the stones. Based on the size of the stones, it is possible that various household mem­bers (i.e., women and subadults) could have par­ticipated in the construction of these features. It is likely that some oversight was involved in the construction for placement, coordination of do­nating labor groups, and the post-construction petroglyph modification of some of the stones. It is at this level that particular individuals, lineages, or "houses" (Gillespie 2000 , 2007; Morsink 20 11) promulgated their identities and advanced their position within the broader social and settlement community. Here, communal labor efforts would have served as a vehicle for communal , rather than individual, status, security, and identity.

Most importantly, the presence of so many low-level ritual facilities so close to Tibes and to one another supports the idea that plaza/bateys served multiple functions at different scales within society. Specifically, the spatial distribution indicates that settlements or small residential groups were able to regulate their own daily ritual activities independent of high level facilities (e.g., Tibes). These low-level features were likely fam­ily architectural projects (Kolb 1997; Kolb and Snead 200 1) constructed by members of the res­idential settlement. These small features would have served as spaces for a variety of functions specific to the needs of the individual settlement on a day-to-day basis, with larger features serving as spaces for the periodic aggregation for larger, more inclusive community ritual activities. 
This all suggests that the sociopolitical system during this time was likely decentralized, with limited authoritative control over people's daily activities. This is not to say that powerful leaders were not present within the society at this time, or that they did not engage in strategies to con­solidate their social and political power; however, based on the research presented in this paper, a more heterarchical or horizontal vector of orga­nization is brought to light. This perspective stresses the fluidity of human interaction and so­cial relationships in which interactive elements need not be permanently ranked relative to one another (Crumley 1995, 2003). What this per­spective provides is a fresh lens through which to view the formation of Puerto Rico's cacicazgos and an opportunity to explore a wider range of research questions to develop more nuanced his­torical contexts that can address social and cul­tural processes leading to their development, or­ganization, and change through time. 
Ultimately, we feel that plaza and batey fea­tures at Tibes were constructed for the benefit of promoting community status and identity in re­lation to other similarly organized, albeit perhaps spatially distinct, social and settlement groups. In this sense, labor was turned into prestige and power that emphasized cohesion among small, dispersed residential social groups throughout the region immediately surrounding Tibes. This view of plazas and bateys presents a context of societal development less structured by traditional per­spectives of linear development and organization limited to a small number of individuals within society. This also suggests that plazas/bateys were not centers from which political power radiated outward, but instead dynamic social places in which people engaged and integrated at multiple scales. 
To conclude, while the labor estimates of plaza and batey construction for Tibes and those in sur­rounding settlements are not truly monumental in terms of labor effort, they are indeed monu­ments linking people in shared ideologies, histo­ries, identities, and places. Future comparative research on the construction of these public ar­chitectural features, particularly those considered to be high-level integrative facilities, may yield important temporal and regional variability in la­bor effort that demonstrates differences in the or­ganization of local social groups, as well as his­torical trajectories of regional social development. This future comparative work would be further complemented by considering the distribution of types and abundance of ritual paraphernalia in association with structures of various sizes. Through the methods presented in this paper, it is possible to develop quantifiable measures to begin to make such comparisons, to examine the inception of sociopolitical groupings at finer scales, and to push archaeological research of precontact polities in the region forward.

2. 
Soil is also documented as a construction element for some plazas in Hispaniola and Cuba. Stone enclosures are not documented in Cuba. 

3. 
Recent work by Oliver (1998) and Oliver and colleagues (Oliver et al. 1999) provides an excellent overview and inter­pretation of the site. 

4. 
Similar daily expenditures in effort are documented by Cotterell and Kaminga for eighteenth, nineteenth, and early twentieth century European populations (based on historic documents) under different load bearing situations (Cotterell and Kaminga 1992:194, Table 8.1).
