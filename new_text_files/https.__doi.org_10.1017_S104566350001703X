In the final chapter, Rattray presents her summary of the ceramic and cultural trends by tracing the chronological changes in ceramics phase by phase, describing the ceramics associated with building activity, synthesizing the ceramic trends in valley set­tlemtnts outside the city, and elaborating those ceramics that indicate supra-regional interaction. When she gets to the Late Tlamimilolpa Phase, she adds a section on the urban zone with a description of the ceramics associated with the ethnic barrios. The book ends with a description of the evidence for the collapse of Teotihuacan between A.D. 600 and A.D.

This is an impressive volume that represents a monumental effort. Whether one agrees or disagrees with Rattray, the analysis of such a massive amount of

pottery and a synthesis of previous research on Teotihuacan ceramics, in one place, and in two lan­guages, provides a great service to the profession, par­ticularly to Mesoamerican archaeologists. One does not have to be a Mesoamerican archaeologist to appreciate and benefit from this book, however, because it contains a wealth of other information about ceramics relevant to the significant theoretical and interpretive issues in the field such as the mean­ing of classification, trade in elite wares, the material signature of ceramic workshops, the archaeological signature of transplanted specialists (the ethnic bar­rios), the development of specialized and standardized wares, and the social meaning of forming technolo­gies. For these reasons, I will return to this book many times in the future.
