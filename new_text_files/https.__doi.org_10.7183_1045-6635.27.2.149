
A KING’S APOTHEOSIS: ICONOGRAPHY, TEXT, AND POLITICS
FROM A CLASSIC MAYATEMPLE AT HOLMUL 

Francisco Estrada­Belli and Alexandre Tokovinine 
Excavations at the ancient Maya city of Holmul, Petén, have led to the discovery of a building decorated with an intricatelycarved and painted plaster frieze. The iconography of the frieze portrays seated lords, mountain spirits, feathered serpents,and gods of the underworld engaged in the apparent rebirth of rulers as sun gods. Large emblems carved on the side of thebuilding identify the structure as a shrine for ancestor veneration. A dedicatory text carved along the bottom of the friezecontains a king list and references to the political and familial ties of the ruler who commissioned the temple. Together, theiconography and text of this structure provide evidence of function and meaning. They also shed new light on a centuryduringClassicMayahistoryknownastheTikal “Hiatus,”forwhichalimitednumberoftextsareavailable.Theinformation derivedfromthismonumentalso broadensour understandingofthe natureofhegemonic relationships amongClassicMaya states. 
El desarrollo de excavaciones en la antigua ciudad Maya de Holmul, Petén, llevó al descubrimiento de un edificio decoradocon un friso elaboradamente esculpido y pintado. Su iconografía incluye representaciones de reyes, espíritus de la montaña,serpientes emplumadas y dioses del inframundo asistiendo al renacimiento de los gobernantes como dioses solares. Losemblemas modelados en las fachadas laterales del edificio permiten identificar su función como santuario para la veneraciónde los ancestros. Un texto dedicatorio inciso a lo largo del friso contiene una lista de reyes y referencias a los lazos políticosy familiares del comisionante del templo. Juntos, la iconografía y el texto asociados a esta estructura, nos proporcionan unaseriede datos clave paraentendersu funcióny susignificado.Asimismo,permiten aclararuna parteaún oscura dela historiade los reinos del sur de las tierras bajas mayas para la cual se dispone de muy pocos datos y que es usualmente conocidacomo el “Hiato de Tikal”. La información derivada de este monumento también nos proporciona nuevos indicios sobre lasrelaciones de carácter hegemónico entre los estados mayas del periodo Clásico.

200 was the time of greatest growth and expan­sion in settlement and monumental construction in the northeastern Petén, especially at Cival, theregional capital between 300 B.C. andA.D. 200.Holmulwas the most importantsecondary centerof Cival. Following the sacking of Cival around
A.D. 200, a royal complex—with plazas, a ballcourt, and funerary temples—was built at LaSufricayaneartheurbancenterofHolmul(Figure1, Estrada­Belli 2011; Estrada­Belli et al. 2009).With the exception of Cival, all sites remainedoccupied throughouttheClassicperiod untiltheirfinal abandonment around A.D. 1040 (Estrada­Belli 2001a; Wahl et al. 2013).
ThepoliticalhistoryoftheHolmulregiondur­ing theClassicperiodhas been largely unknown.The inscriptions and imagery at La Sufricaya re­veal a local dynasty of chak tok wayaab rulers as early as A.D. 379. The fortunes of the dynastywere linkedtothenewpolitical order establishedaftertheTeotihucan entrada ofA.D.378(Estrada­Belli et al. 2009; Fash et al. 2009; Grube 2003;Stuart 2005; Tokovinine 2013). The burial of amember of the Holmul dynasty in Room 1 ofBuilding B, Group II at Holmul aroundA.D. 400indicates that Group II retained its importanceduringthisperiod(Estrada­Bellietal.2009;Mer­win and Vaillant 1932:Figure 12, Plate 36e). Bythe end of the sixth century, public buildings atLa Sufricaya had been ritually terminated(Tokovinine and Estrada­Belli 2015:200). Thecarved monuments were broken and scattered around the site. Excavated thrones and artifacts in Groups I and III at Holmul make these two lo­cations the likely seats of the royal court in thesixth and seventh centuries A.D. Nonetheless,untilnow, noreferencestothoserulershavebeenfound(Estrada­Belli2001a; MerwinandVaillant1932; Mongelluzzo 2011).
The next known Late Classic episode in thehistory of Holmul is documented on two monu­ments and a rock carving at Tikal, celebratingthe capture of a chak tok wayaab individual in 
A.D. 748 that concluded a campaign waged byTikal against Naranjo (Beliaev 2004; Estrada­Bellietal.2009;MartinandGrube2008[2000]).This episode can be linked to a direct attack onthesiteof Holmul; thewalls and rampartsaroundthe site epicenter date to the same period.Aplate 
belonging to the Naranjo ruler known as “BatKawiil” found in a burial in Building F in GroupI at Holmul (Figure 2) reveals that the politicalrelationship between Holmul and Naranjo con­tinued after the decline of Tikal at the end of the eighth century and in the early ninth century(Martin and Grube 2008 [2000]:81; Merwin andVaillant 1932:13–14, Plate 2).
The discovery of a well­preserved frieze onBuildingAof Group II at Holmul fills the gap inthehistoryofthesitebetweenthecurrentlyknownEarly and Late Classic episodes. Initially docu­mented by Merwin (Merwin and Vaillant 1932),the LateClassic construction phaseof BuildingAis a highly unusual structure. It encases an earliertempledecoratedwiththeabovementionedfrieze.The south­oriented façade of the latest construc­tion phase features a single doorway on one sideinsteadofthecustomarycentralentrance(Merwinand Vaillant 1932:Figure 8). The doorway wasprobably decorated as an open maw, a portal tothe underworld. An L­shaped hallway leads to avaultedtombinthecenterofthestructure(Figure3a). The south façade also presents carved stonearmatures for stucco reliefs. The eastern side is preservedenoughtosuggestthatitmayhavebeendecorated with the face of the sun god (MerwinandVaillant1932:Plate4).Thereisnovisiblesur­faceevidenceofanaccessstairway.Thisbuildingphaseappearstohaveremaineduncompleted,per­haps in connection with the abovementioned raidby Tikal. The defeat and capture of the Holmulruler also would explain why the tomb at the endof the L­shaped passage was never occupied andwhy no shrine was built above it.Although mon­umental construction at Holmul continued well into the tenth centuryA.D., the work on BuildingAwas never resumed.

The Iconography of the Holmul Frieze 
The painted stucco relief decorates the westernsideoftheroofofthebuilding(Figure4a;Tokovi­nine2015).Themain iconographicprogramdoesnot extend beyond the corners, but the nearbysouthern and northern sides feature two identical emblems. Except for the more damaged north­western and northern sections, most of the friezeiswellpreserved,retaining severalcoatsof paint.Yellow, orange, blue, and green paints highlightvarious details of the imagery and text. A hiero­glyphic inscription runs along the entire lengthof the cornice of the western side of the roof. Its northernmost section has been damaged, but thesouthern section remains relatively intact.
The corners and the central sections of the frieze have a near full­round sculpture qualityand the rest of the frieze is executed in relief of various depths. Traces of incised sketch lines re­vealed by fallenstucco fragments(Figure4b)im­ply some overall planning, but the style of thefinished sculpture is not uniform. The northernhalf of the western wall and the glyph on thenorthern wall are executed in shallower relief compared to the images on the southern half ofthe western wall and the glyph on the southernwall. The northern section also shows greater

The southern half is somewhat cruder in the execution of anatomical details and otherfeatures.It isalso distinguishedbyappliquédecorations and painted elements. The main in­scription does not exhibit such stylistic variationand was probably produced by the more compe­tent artist responsible for the northern section.

The overall style of the texts andimages of the frieze closely resemble those ofAjnumsaaj Chan K’inich’s monuments and pot­tery(Graham1978:69–70, 73, 97, 103; Martinetal.2015)andthemonumentalfriezesofhispalacecompound in the Central Acropolis at Naranjo(Fialko 2008:53–62; Fialko and Schuster 2012:25). 
The center and corners of the Holmul frieze feature three representations of animate moun­tains. Two feathered serpents emerge from themouth ofthecentral mountain towardsthesouth­ern and the northern corners of the scene (Figure4a). Such serpents usually represent breath, themoist aircoming fromcaves,andtheysometimescarryorexhalegodsandancestralspirits(Saturnoet al. 2005:7–25;Taube 2004:79–86).The coiledbodies of the serpents stretch across the entiresurface of the frieze, so that the other two moun­tains appear to emerge from their wide­openmouths.Thesemountainshaveneitherbreathser­pents nor name cartouches.

central and thesouthernindividualsarerelativelywell preserved. Their faces appear to have sus­tained damage during a deactivation ritual. Thepostures of the figures are nearly identical. Thehands of the central individual are placed on hisknees (Figure 4a), whereas the left arm of thesouthern corner individual is flexed and the hand is grasping the chainofhis chest pectoral (Figure4b). Both figures wear pelts, rigid belts withmasksand jadeplaques,bracelets,necklaces,andchest pectorals. They have Principal Bird Deityheaddresses and avian chin masks. The costume details are consistent with the representations ofthe Classic Maya Sun God (Hellmuth 1987:285–293, Figures 635–654), but the bodily attributesofthedeityareabsent.Instead,theHolmulfigureshave the idealized Maize God faces of Classic Maya royalty and nobles. A sky band with starsand “shiners” extends the fulllengthofthe friezeat the level of the shoulders of the seated figures(Figure 4a). The band explicitly places the sceneina celestial setting, consistentwith the Sun Godcostumes of the seated protagonists.
The iconographic program of the Holmulfrieze conforms to a frequent theme in Classic Maya Art that Taube (2004:74–86) and Salazar(2015) have identified as the apotheosis of royalancestorsascelestialbodies.Itcommonlydepictsthe sun for kings and the moon for queens astheyascend,oremergefrom,themythicalFlowerMountain. A caption to a sun­like ancestor onYaxchilánStela3(Figure5b)identifiesthissacredsite as “Five Jan (flower) Mountain.”
The composition of the Holmul frieze resem­bles the imagery of a sixth­century stucco friezeon the roof of Structure 1Aat Balamkú (BoucherandDzul2001).Thisfriezeshowsfourmountainstoppedwith saurian monstersfromwhose gapingmouthsseatedSunGod­likelordsemerge(Figure5a). Inthe spacesbetweenthe mountains,jaguarswith skeletal mandibles are shown sitting on wa­ter bands (Baudez 1996). The iconography ofseverallaterYaxchilánmonumentsoffersanother potential clue. They include representations ofanthropomorphic star deities with feline traits inthesamecelestialrealmasdeifiedroyalancestors(Figure 5c; see Chinchilla 2005:119–205).
Stars play a prominent role in the solar apoth­eosis theme, as well as in the scene on thePalenque sarcophagus. In the latter, the nobles

assume the role of the stars that accompany thedeceased ruler portrayed as the sun (Chinchilla2006). The Balamkú symbolism implies somekind of confrontation between the feline star deities and the sun. On the contrary, the Holmulfrieze highlights the gift of the “first tamales.” The inscription on the altar to Stela 13 at Copánalso mentions “making food” (patlaj uwe’) forthesundeityintheeast(Houstonetal.2006:123),perhaps notunlikethe “great tamales”(nohwah)offered to the gods and spirits in Yukatek­andLacandon­speaking communities (Taube 1989:40). The use of naah (“first”) rather than yax (“original”) means that these are not the pri­mordial tamales, but rather the tamales offered by the star gods to the deified ancestor as he as­cended to the sky for the first time. 
The captions in the headdresses of the deitieson the Holmul frieze (Figures 6b and 6d; Table1)identifythedeitytotheleftofthecentralfigure as Paat Kab Baak (“Back Land Bone”). The lastcharacter is damaged, so an alternative readingWINIK (“person”) cannot be discarded. Thename may be a reference to commoners, as inYukatek ajpach kabwinik “backcountrypeople”(Barrera et al. 1995:617),orto thebones of com­moners.The name of thedeity to the rightbeginswith acharacter that resemblesa syllabic be.The rest of the name consists of the logogramsTZ’AK and AJAW, which probably carry thesame connotations here as in the more common bolontz’ak[buul]ajaw (manygenerationslord[s])name that refers to royal ancestors. Therefore, itis tempting to interpret the two deities as repre­

Thecaption in theheaddressofthelordseatedonthecentralmountain(Figure6c;Table1)iden­tifies him as Tzahb Chan Yopaat Mahcha’ (“Yopaat of bark string/strip is a rattle in thesky”). The first character in the name becomesinterchangeablewiththe OCH logograminsome Late Classic and Postclassic inscriptions. Nonetheless, the u­ergative prefix in the text ona travertine bowl in the Dumbarton Oaks collec­tion (Tokovinine 2012:124–125) implies that thesign in question was not vowel­initial. Kelley’s(1976:154–155) reading of the grapheme asTZAHB “rattle (snake)” was recently strength­ened by a possible tza­ba substitution on Edzná monuments(Pallán2009:155–166).Thelastwordof the name is probably derived from mahch,which means “string, strip of bark” in Ch’orti’(Wisdom 1950:521). The final –a’ is likely anagentivesuffix (Houston et al. 2001:6–7). “Bark­stringperson” couldrefertothe knottedpectoralsand belt ornaments of rain deities (Houston andTaube2012:44;StoneandZender2011:5–6).Thecaption concludes with the chak tok wayaab(“cloud­red dreaming place”) title of the Holmuldynasty (Estrada­Belli et al. 2009). Therefore,thecaptionidentifiesthedeifiedsun­likeancestorfigure as a local ruler named Tzahb Chan Yopaat Mahcha’.

The caption accompanying the figure on thenorthern corner is missing, and the caption forthe southern figure is heavily eroded (Figure 6e;Table 1). The name phrase of the latter seems tobegin with Wak Chan (“Six Sky”). Judging fromthe contours of the glyph blocks, it does not in­clude the chak tok wayaab title and does not ap­pearinthelistofancestorsinthemain inscriptionon thefrieze. Consequently,the figuremightrep­resent a deity. Two known Classic Mayatheonyms begin with the number six. One of theregional Maize Gods is called Wak Chan Nal (winik), “SixSky (corn)Place(person)” (Tokovi­nine 2013:115–120). The court of God D is usu­allyplacedat Wak Chan (Witz), “Six Sky (Moun­tain),” and he may be occasionally referred to as a “Six Sky (Mountain) lord” (Boot 2008).
The glyphic emblems on the northern andsouthern sides of the roof (Figures 4b, 4c) com­bine several elements that spell the name of thebuilding. These include T48 NAAH, T533, halfofT510cdquatrefoil,anda twistedcord.T48:533may be a single grapheme (Hellmuth 1987:85–101,Figures143–153; Stuart 2005:121–122,Fig­ure 90). T510cd quatrefoil represents a cave(Fash 2005:119–122) and is possibly read asPAN “cavity/hollow” (Carterand Houston2010).The same T48 (:533):T510cd compound is pre­sent on the Early Classic building at Placeres(Figure 5d; see Mayer 1988:54–59, Figure 6)and inTomb 23 at RíoAzul(Figure5e;see Hous­ton 1998:351–352). The whole T48:T533:T510cd combination could be a full Early Classic form of the NAAH “house” lo­gogram. The variable graphemes in these threecases are the UUW “moon” logogram at Río Azul, a full­figure MAM “grandfather” with AJAW “lord” at Placeres, and the twisted cordat Holmul. The twisted cord is a common motif in Classic Maya iconography (Figure 5f) and themain element of the TZ’AK logogram (Figure5g). Consequently,thename oftheHolmul build­ing could betz’a(h)k/tz’akab naah, “the house of time/sacredbundles/succession/generations.” 



The Hieroglyphic Text 
The main inscription on the western side of theroof of Building A consists of 40 hieroglyphicblocks(Figure6a).Thefirstsixblocksareheavilydamaged. It is likely that the damaged sectioncontained a Calendar Rounddateand atleast one predicate. The remaining text is relatively wellpreserved and legible (Table 1).
The narrative in Blocks H–N’is composed ofaseriesofrepetitiveclauseswithnon­verbalpred­icates. Similar narrative structures are found on contemporaneous Naranjo monuments such asStela 38 (Graham 1978:79). Each clause beginswith the expression utz’ahka’and its translation merits a discussion. 
Two tz’ak roots and their derivations are at­tested in Classic Maya inscriptions and both arespelled with the same TZ’AK logogram. Kauf­man and Norman (1984:134) reconstruct *tz’äk “complete” as a positional and a transitive verbstem for Proto­Ch’olan. The positional verb —“to take place in a certain order” — is combined with the ­bu suffix and becomes a transitive verb tz’akbu “to succeed/complete.” This verb and its participle (tz’akbuul) occur in Classic Maya ref­erences to dynastic succession (Houston 1998;Martin 2003:38; Stuart 2003:356–357, 2011:3–4; Stuart et al. 1999:32).

tz’ak functions as a numerical classifier in the count of rulers (Smailus 1975:27–34).
The second root—a transitive verb tz’ak— means “toadd,tobringtogether” inCh’orti’(Hull2005:109). Its nominalized form—tz’ahk—sig­nifies “bundle, joint” (Wisdom 1950:734). Theadjective tz’akar may be translated as “bundled,joined” (Wisdom 1950:737). Yukatek tz’akal as “knotted” (Barreraetal. 1995:873)isreminiscentof the basic TZ’AK character that representstwisted cords (Figure 5g). Acalan Chontal usesthe cognate tz’akal in the context of tribute bun­dles (Smailus 1975:87).InClassic Maya inscrip­tions,this verbappears intheexpression “hebun­dles spears/sticks” (utz’akaw te’), referring tocaptives (Stuart and Graham 2003:61–63), trib­ute­givers (Graham 1978:86; Stuart 2006:133–134), and haab months (Houston and Mathews1985:11, Figure 7a). The possessed nominalizedform of this root (utz’ahka’/utz’ahkaj) links se­quential eventswith orwithoutdistance numbers(e.g., Blocks F15, H6, and H9 on Tikal Stela 31; see Jones and Satterthwaite 1982:Figure 52). Itis clear from these contexts that the expressionrefersto the elapsedtime that is bundledtogetherlikeAztec xiuhmolpilli andyear­bundles atTeoti­huacan (Fash et al. 2009:206–209).
The Holmul narrative, therefore, refers to asuccession of individuals who bundled the yearsinreferencetotheirtimeinofficeortheirlifetime. This interpretation is strengthened by the title ofthelastpersoninthesequencewhoiscalled winik tz’ak­tuunil­a’ or winik tuun tz’ahka’—“personwho bundled a score of years.” The expressionmay be compared to a passage on Dos Pilas Hi­eroglyphicStairway1:B2­B3: huliucha’tz’a[h]k uwinikhaab ti ajawlel “it came, the secondbundlingofhisscoreofyearsinkingship” (Hous­ton and Mathews 1985:11, Figure 7c).
The partially damaged clause in Blocks E–Hends with the title “five/fifth to succeed Wiin Te’ Naah lord.” Wiin Te’Naah is the toponym other­wise known as Wite’Naah or Wi’Te’Naah. It is of paramount importance as a location at Teoti­

at the end of the word. The actual gloss in wi­TE’ and T600­TE’ is probably wiin te’ with a long vowel clued by the disharmony principle(Houston et al. 1998).
The translation of wiin te’ is uncertain. The Tzotzil verb win “to appear, be seen” (Laughlin 1975:370)or “toappearinthedistance,beclearlyexposed,bemanifest/public” (Laughlin andHav­iland 1988:328) is probably the same gloss aswin inYukatek winba for “image/statue” (Barrera et al. 1995:923). A corresponding wi­ni­BAAH spelling occurs in Palenque inscriptions (Scheleand Mathews 1979:cat. no. 431), and there maybe even a substitution of wi­ni­BAAH by T600­BAAH onDosPilasStela15(HoustonandStuart1998:82–83, Figure 9d). The iconography ofT600anditsuseinClassicMayaimagerysuggestthat it represents crossed bundles, perhaps usedin New Fire rituals (Fash et al. 2009). A largebonfire on a pyramid or a scaffold would qualify as “wood that appears in the distance.” Given its Teotihuacan associations, however, a possibilityof a foreign gloss cannot be discarded.
There are several “Wiin Te’ Naah lords” in ClassicMayainscriptions.Somecouldbeforeignrulers; others were Maya lords who travelled toand derived legitimacy from Wiin Te’Naah. The “Wiin Te’Naah lord” Tajoom Uk’ab Tuun in the narrative on a wooden box from the Piedras Ne­gras region (Figure 7e) was likelya foreignover­lord (Zender 2007). The founder of the Copándynasty only travelled to Wiin Te’ Naah (Stuart 2004), but was also called “Wiin Te’Naah lord” (Figure 7f). A “Wiin Te’ Naah lord” from Río Azul (Figure 7g) and a “fourth successor of theWiin Te’Naah lord” from the Cancuén royal dy­nasty (Figure 7h) were likely local lords with aconnection to a foreign place.
The presence of this title in the sequence ofHolmul rulers complements the evidence fromtheEarlyClassicpalacecomplexatLaSufricaya,which was occupied by members of the Holmulchak tok wayaab lineage. The palace was deco­rated with Teotihuacan­inspired martial themesincluding warriors, captives, and scaffold sacri­fice, as well as with textual and visual referencesto travel and to the arrival of a foreign overlordat Tikal (Estrada­Belli et al. 2009; Tokovinineand Estrada­Belli 2015). The “fifth to succeed”expression introduces a sequence of five rulers, so it could be a reference to them as those “five to succeed the Wiin Te’ Naah lord.” This would mean that by theA.D. 590s, there were five suc­cessive Holmul rulers after the founder of the La Sufricaya palace who held office around A.D.379–422. 
The name of the first of these five individuals in the Holmul list (Figure 6a; Table 1; Blocks I–K) features a theonym with a structure wa’ ook (“foot stood up”), meaning place, deity name(Tokovinine2013:39). Mak’ “corktree” (Barreraet al. 1995:486) in Block I would be a place andKok Aat would be an otherwise unknown god.The second half of the name in Block K includes a rare ya­K’IN spelling (also found in the nameof a scribe on the K7459 vessel from the regionnorth of Holmul) and an even more unusual i­su or i­ki. 
The beginning of the name of the second in­dividual in Blocks L–M (Figure 6a; Table 1) re­sembles the name phrase of “Animal Skull” ofTikal (Grube and Martin 2000:51–53). The sec­ond half of the name in Blocks N–O follows the template “God X in the sky isY” or “God X isY in the sky.” The reading o for the deity name is preferable in light of the WITZ’ “waterfall” sig­nificance of the initial word of the name phrase.Aj K’ahk’ O’ Chahk is a rain deity venerated atYaxchilán (Stuart 2013). There seems to be aconnection betweenthe O’ bird and rain, making “O’ (bird) in the sky is a waterfall (torrentialrain?)” a suitable interpretation of the name inthe Holmul inscription.
The first half of the name of the third individ­ual in Blocks P–Q (Figure 6a; Table 1) shouldprobably be transliterated as Juun Ch’am[ab] K’uh (“one taking­god”).The missing –ab suffix maybereconstructedfrom grammaticallysimilarnames (TokovinineandZender2012:55).There­maining partofthe name inBlocksR–S containsa combination of two undeciphered characters(T174­T530)andanopaquesequenceofsyllables(ko­?­lo).

4a). The appearance of Tzahb Chan YopaatMahcha’ inthelist confirms that hewasa deified ancestor and that the building was dedicated tocelebratehis spiritualtransformation upon death.
Therestoftheinscription (BlocksV–N’)con­sists of the name and titles of the individual who likely commissioned the building (Figure 6a;Table 1). It begins with the “person who bundleda score of years” title discussed above. The per­sonalnameinBlocksX–Ymaybereadas K’inich Tajal Tuun or K’inich Tajal Chahk. The second option would imply that he was a namesake ofan earlier Naranjo ruler (Figure 8a; see Martinand Grube 2008 [2000]:71).The logogram in theHolmul text, however, lacks several CHAHK features. 
The text inBlock Zinforms that K’inichTajalTuun was a “vassal (y­ajaw) of Kaanul lord(s),” referringtothe “Snake­Head” dynastylaterbased at Calakmul.The term y­ajaw usually indicates astate of subordination of one ruler by another(Houston 1993:139; Houston and Mathews1985:Figure 12; Martin and Grube 1995). Pos­sessed forms of ajaw with an opposite meaningof one’s overlord usually feature an additionalsuffix ­aal as in w­ajwaal “my lord” (Law et al.2013). The name of the overlord is not specified,as if the patronage over K’inich Tajal Tuun ex­tended to all or to consecutive members of the Kaanul dynasty. Holmul rulers did not have anemblem glyph (“lord of place X”), but the state­mentindicates theirroyalrank vis­à­visotherdy­nasties, not unlike the cases of other ruling fam­ilies without emblem glyphs (Houston 1986).
The text continues with a parentage statementthat mentions K’inich Tajal Tuun’s grandfather,mother, and father in Blocks A’–N’ (Figure 6a;Table 1). Similarly structured statements appearon Tikal Stelae 3, 7, 12, 17, a stairway blockfrom La Corona, and all refer to maternal grand­fathers (Beliaev et al. 2013:53, 61, 75–77, 85–88; Martin 2008a, 2008b:5, Figure5;Tokovinineand Fialko 2007:11–12). Some of the Tikal ex­amples also omit the ergative u­prefix before mam for “[his] grandson.”
AccordingtoBlocksA’–E’ofthetext,K’inichTajal Tuun’s grandfather was a ruler of Naranjowho can be identified by the name ofAjnumsaaj[Chan K’inich] (“Aj Wosal”) (Figures 8b–8e),the “white chuwen”titleofNaranjolords(Figures 8b and 8e), and the rare “Seven Yopaat” epithet(Figures 8 band 8e). The paleography of ?NUM (T206) in the frieze text (Block D’) clarifies thereadingofthisroyalnameas “SunGodismaking passage in the sky” (Martin et al. 2015).
K’inich Tajal Tuun’s mother (Blocks F’–I’) isprovided with a royal epithet of “holy lady” andthe dynastic title “white chuwen.” She must have beenAjnumsaajChanK’inich’sdaughter.K’inichTajal Tuun’s father (Blocks J’–N’) is mentionedas a “two k’atun lord” and by another title ofwhich only the second word—ajaw—was pre­served. No name is given, which happens whenthe personisalready mentioned in thetext.Judg­ing from the honors bestowed upon Tzahb ChanYopaatMahcha’,hecouldwellhavebeenK’inichTajal Tuun’s recently deceased father.
The “three­k’atun” title of Ajnumsaaj ChanK’inich in Block B’ permits the reconstructionofthe approximatededicationdate ofthe Holmulfrieze.Ajnumsaaj Chan K’inich acceded toking­ship in A.D. 546 (Martin and Grube 2008[2000]:71–72). Forty­seven years later, when hededicated Stela 38 in A.D. 593, he was a “threek’atun lord.” This implies that he was stillyounger than 60 years. He dedicated Stela 25 in
A.D.615.Stela27,hislastmonument,wascarvedaroundA.D.623. Itstext describes himasa “five k’atun lord” (Grube andMartin2004:30–31).Allretrospective references to Ajnumsaaj ChanK’inich should mention his age at death, so theHolmul frieze was carved when he was older than 40 and younger than 60, and at a time whenhis grandson was at least 20 years old. The dedi­catory date of the frieze, therefore, was close to
A.D. 593. 
Ajnumsaaj Chan K’inich acceded to kingshipas a vassal of the Kaanul lord (Martin and Grube2008 [2000]:71–72). The text on Naranjo Stela47 emphasized his loyalty to four successiveKaanulkings whohadreignedduringhis lifetime(Martin et al. 2015). The inscription on the Hol­mul frieze indicates that Holmul was under the sway of the Kaanul dynasty at least byA.D. 593,that is, well after the defeat of Tikal in A.D. 562(Martin 2005a; Martin and Grube 2008 [2000]:39–40). It seems, however, that the rulersof Holmul chose their new allegiances at least20yearsearlier, whenAjnumsaajChanK’inich’sdaughter was sent to marry Tzahb Chan Yopaat.

During the 2014 excavations, we found a par­tially preserved inscription painted on a wall of asubstructure directly underneath the frieze struc­ture. It included a Calendar Round date of 7 Cib 14 Ch’en, probably corresponding to September13, A.D. 558 (Figure 3d; Estrada­Belli 2014:4,Figure1.7).Withinthesameroomwasaplasteredthrone­benchandunderthefloorofthenextroom was a burial of an individual buried with 28 ves­sels (Figure 3e; Diaz 2012; Estrada­Belli2012:Figures 1.20–21, 2015). Given that thebench and thetombwerepositionedcentrallyun­dertheimageofTzahb ChanYopaatinthe frieze,we think these are associated with the time of his ruleandhisrestingplace.Eventhoughthepaintedinscription is largely illegible, it may in all like­lihood refer to his accession date or to another crucial event of his lifetime. The A.D. 500–560 period coincides with the estimated date for theabandonmentoftheLaSufricayapalace(Estrada­Belli2001b:12–13,Figures 24–30;Estrada­Belliet al. 2009:253). We therefore surmise that theindividualhonored inthe frieze and buried under the A.D. 558 throne room may have come topower during the political turnover. This alonewould probably justify the honor he received bybeing immortalized on the frieze. The A.D. 558date also falls four years before the defeat ofTikal by Kaanul, when the balance of power inthe lowlands markedly shifted in favor of thenorthern kingdom (Martin 2005b). 


Conclusions 
TheimageryandtextsoftheHolmulfriezerevealnew details about how the Classic Maya concep­tualized the transformation of ancestors into revered sun­like entities. The data from Holmul are particularly significant because the same an­cestorisdepictedas asun­likegod andthen men­tioned again in the accompanying genealogy ofthe main inscription. The scene on the Holmulfrieze is also unique in its emphasis on the offer­ingoffoodtothesolarancestorbytwostardeitiesor ancestral spirits, which clarifies the signifi­cance of similar representations. The glyphicnames inscribed on the southern and northern wallsoftheHolmulstructurepointtothefunctionof the building as an ancestral shrine. This ideais given further support by the placement of a tomb buried deeply beneath the building. Thefrieze building was likely preceded by TzahbChan Yopaat’s palace, which was filled at thetime of his death aroundA.D. 593. 
The main inscription of the frieze adds five orsix previously unknown individuals to the list ofHolmul rulers.Although we do not have any his­torical details from their reigns, the names andtitles provide some important information. Thereference to a “Wiin Te’Naah lord” carries High­land Mexican associations consistent with the cultural contact evidenced in the Early Classicimagery from the La Sufricaya palace. The useof Tikal­specific titles suggests connections toTikal, includinga rather rareparentage statementstructure,inwhichamaternalgrandfatherismen­tioned ahead of mother and father. Other parts ofthe names and titles on the Holmul frieze seem to reflect local and otherwise unique conceptsandbeliefsincludingpreviouslyunknowndeities.
The titles and parentage statement of the lastHolmul ruler mentioned in the inscription on thefriezeindicatethat, bythelastquarterof thesixthcentury,the chaktok wayaab ofHolmulhadfam­ilytieswith theNaranjo rulersandthatbothwereunder the sway of the Kaanul dynasty. This newpieceof informationfits the previouslysuggestedshift in the alliances of Holmul from Tikal to Naranjo;italsoindicates a broader pattern of po­litical changes relatingtotheriseofKaanulkingsto overlords at the expense ofTikal. It is possiblethatAjnumsaajChanK’inichbetrothedhisdaugh­ter to a Holmul ruler as a way of controlling thechak tok wayaab, just as Kaanul princesses weresent to marry subordinate lords and oversee theirdomains elsewhere. The close connections be­tween the two sites also explain the incompletefinal building phase of Building A, another fu­nerary shrine that was left unfinished after thedownfall of Naranjo and the attack on Holmulby Tikal inA.D. 748.
The political relationships among Holmul,Naranjo and the Kaanul lords highlighted by theHolmul Frieze reflect broad sociopoliticalprocesses at work in the Maya Lowlands duringthe LateClassicperiod.Wenowknow withsomeconfidence that,on theeve of their attack againstTikal,Kaanulkingssecuredanally,Holmul,only35km fromtheirenemy.

research at the sites of La Corona, El Perú, andEl Zotz, that Kaanul kings had secured vassalson all other routes into Tikal prior to the actualattack in A.D. 562 that is detailed on Caracol Altar 21 (Canuto and Barrientos 2013; Freideland Guenter 2003; Houston 2008; Martin 2005a;Martin and Grube 2008[2000]). The southwardexpansionofKaanullikelybegan by atleastA.D.520, with the first marriage of a Kaanul lady to aLa Corona lord (Canuto and Barrientos 2013;Martin 2008b). The watershed defeat of Tikal in
A.D. 562 may then beseennot as astarting pointina struggle for hegemony between thetwo rivalkingdoms, as hitherto implicitly suggested, butas the final step in the dismantling of the low­land­wide hegemony ofTikal by a process of ex­pansion through conquest and intermarriage car­riedoutbyatleastthreeconsecutiveKaanulkings(Martin and Grube 1995, 2008).
The new textual evidence from La Corona (Martin2008b),ElPerú(Guenter2014),andnowHolmul reaffirms the importance of royal mar­riage in Maya politics (Marcus 1973). In thesethree cases, it appears to have served as an in­strument of geopolitical control when formerlyindependent or otherwise aligned rulers marrieda princessfroma foreignroyal dynasty.This par­ticular strategy may have been a Kaanul innova­tion that quickly became adopted more widelyand was distinct from other forms of politicalmarriage in whichbrides fromequalrank or sub­jugated dynasties married into a foreign dynasty.The Holmul text implies that the marriage of thedaughter ofAjnumsaaj to Tzahb Chan Yopaat ofHolmul was an attempt of the Naranjo king tocreateorconsolidate hisown regional hegemonyin the eastern lowlands, equally satisfying hisown ambitions and the interests of his Kaanul overlords.Ajnumsaaj’sexpansionineasternPeténmay have reached Xultun (Saturno et al. 2012)and certainly Xunantunich and Buena Vista inthe Belize River Valley (LeCount and Yaeger2010:340), while in the south it may have beenlimitedbytheproxykingdomsofCaracol(Martinand Grube 2008:91–92). The Kaanul strategy ofallowing,ifnotencouraging,regionalhegemonieswithin its own broader area of influence may beat the root of the rapid emergence of regionalkingdoms centered on Naranjo, Dos Pilas, Yax­chilán,PiedrasNegras,Palenque,andTonináafter the first major setback suffered by Kaanul in thelate seventh centuryA.D.
The importance of the marriage strategy forKaanul expansionism does not necessarily implya peaceful process of incorporation or alliance.Textualsourcestendtoomitdiscussionofthecir­cumstances preceding the arrival of the bridesfromthedominantpoliticalcenter.Archaeologicaland epigraphic data from La Corona indicate achangeofrulinglineagesandpatrondeities(Baron2013). References to the Kaanul bride at El Perúfollow a century­long hiatus in monument dedi­cation (Guenter 2014:154).Asimilar gap appearsinthetextual recordatNaranjopriortotheacces­sionofateenageAjnumsaajChanK’inich,whichmightnotevenhavetakenplaceatNaranjo(Mar­tin et al. 2015). The abovementioned demise ofLa Sufricaya implies some kind of political shiftor coup at Holmul (Estrada­Belli 2001a, 2001b;Estrada­Belli etal.2009).Thenew rulers atthesesites seemingly lacked any motivation to discussthe details of mid­sixth century troubles. Suchomissions are common in Classic Maya inscrip­tions and the rare exceptions are limited to con­texts of dynastic restoration and subsequent retri­bution(MartinandGrube2008:89–90,164–165).
The absence of a proper emblem glyph (“Xplace lord”) and of the k’uhul ajaw (“hole/divinelord”) epithet in the titles of the Holmul rulers,whowentby chaktokwayaab despitetheirlordlyrank, points to the subordinate status of theserulers. It resembles the position of the lords ofLa Corona vis­à­vis their Kaanul overlords. La Corona rulers acceded to kingship (ajawlel) and yet were called sak wayis, instead of k’uhul ajawwith a dynastic emblem glyph. In contrast, theruling families of El Perú and Naranjo, thoughvassals of Kaanul, retained their emblem glyphsand k’uhul ajaw titles. This difference suggeststhat some dynasties were able to retain greaterautonomyandregionalpoliticalaspirations.Whatdistinguishes them from places like La Coronaor Los Alacranes, for example, is that they weresituated farther afield in the Kaanul hegemony.
Allegiances based on familial ties betweendaughter and father, grandson and grandfather—such as those between Kaanul and La Corona, orNaranjoandHolmulroyals—werelikelystrongerthan those between non­family members. LaCorona remained a loyal ally even after the

demiseof Kaanul kings(Stuart,Canuto, and Bar­rientos 2015; Stuart, Canuto, Barrientos, andLamoureax St­Hillaire 2015). The relationshipof Holmul to the Naranjo dynasty was so closethat Holmul became the target of Tikal in A.D.748,after whichHolmul remained in theNaranjosphere for several decades longer.
During the Late Classic period, military ag­gressionappearstohavebeenused(andrecorded)in a more selective way than previously thought.Inmanycases,itservedasaretributionforpullingout of hegemonic alliances. Often this occurredduring periods of succession at vassal kingdoms(e.g., at Naranjo after Ajnumsaaj’s death; seeMartin and Grube 2008:72), perhaps in responsetoharshtributeobligationsimposedbyoverlords.Even so, the Kanuul hegemony lasted for abouttwo centuries and represents a period of relativestability in the central and southern lowlands. Itsdemise inthe first half of the eighthcenturyA.D.reignited conflicts among regional kings. Thefight for supremacy in the political vacuum leftby Kaanul overlords should be considered a keyfactor in the balkanization and eventual collapseof political regimes in the southern Maya Low­lands in the following century.
