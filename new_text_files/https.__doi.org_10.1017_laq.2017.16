It is accompanied by an appendix with detailed qualitative and quantitative information on all the stations and sediments sampled.

In part 3, which includes chapter 9 and two appendixes, theauthor presents theconclusionsof his research,discussing theabandonment processes and their characteristics in the study area. To do so, he considers the results of past wild.re regimes, their regularity over time, the impact of drought during occupation and .nal depopulation, and its timing and scope,along with socialfactorsrelatedto internal and external tensions.Heconcludesthatwild.res played an important rolebut, basedontheregularityof such episodes, as seen in the history of sediments, it is unlikelythatthese weretheonlyfactorsinvolvedinthe abandonmentofthevalley.He understandsthat natural and sociocultural factors could cause instability or stress in the population and in.uence the subsequent abandonment of the area. 
Thebibliographyis consistentwiththetheoretical­methodological approach and previous regional archaeological studies. It should be noted that some recent publications on the abandonment of the area arenot treatedinthisbook, althoughtheywouldenrich this valuable study even more, by incorporating other perspectives. 
Thearchaeologyof theAmbatoValley constitutes a challenge for the study of abandonment processes. Its archaeological record and the data accumulated by differentresearchersoverthe yearshavegenerated an importantbodyofevidenceandinformation, with severalcontexts interpretedas.nalscenariosofoccu­pation. Although this study does not offer de.nitive conclusionsregardingthetypeof abandonmentofthe sites, theirdestructionandburning, theintentionality or notof thoseevents, or thefactorsthat causedthem, itoffers signi.cantresults that allowustoadvance our understanding of such issues on a .rm basis. Its main strength liesinthe constructionofasolid methodology basedfundamentallyon pedoanthropology,withnovel and consistent analytical methods that are adequate to theproblem anda theoretical approach that moves away from dual nature/culture views. 
In this sense, the work constitutes an important contribution to archaeology, not only advancing the studyof regionalissues relatedtoabandonment and paleoenvironmentsbut alsoin widermethodological and conceptual aspects. It opens alternative lines of study that can be used in other contexts with similar problems, such as weighing theroleof naturalfactors in social decisions andwideningthe discussion about current abandonment hypotheses, an issuethatisalso being approached from other perspectives (Gordillo andVindrola-Padrós, Antiquity 91(355):155–72).

Unfor­tunately, no Belizeans are represented in the list of authors. 
The chapters are organized thematically around landscapes (part1), ChetumalBay ceramics(part 2), stone toolsand shellartifacts(part 3),andabroader regional perspective (part 4). In chapter 1, Walker presents an overview of the volume while providing the reader background information on the geography andhistoryof humanuseofthearea, includingauseful table of archaeological sites in the region. The bay todayisbisectedby an international borderthatalso divides archaeology and archaeologists working on opposite shores of the Rio Hondo. The border is a product of colonial con.icts between distant nations; it divides an area that was united by a focus on waterborne trade fromthe Preclassicthrough theLate Postclassic.

Robertson (chapter 7) presents a detailed reevaluation of the Late Preclassic ceramics fromCerroMayato bettersituatetheirdevelopment in termsofbothchronology andgeographicin.uence.

Theyreportthe startlingand unexpected .nd, through petrographic analysis, that the quartzite tem­perofthese utilitarianvessels,which mayhavebeen used forsaltproduction,was itselfimported. Aimers and colleagues capably argue that the appearance of CoconutWalk Unslippedand relatedtypesmarks the arrival of coastal peoples in the region rather than a devolutionoflocal pottery technology.Chapters9(by LindaHowie,TerryG.Powis, andElizabethGraham) and10(by SusanMillbrath and DebraWalker)revisit previouslyexcavated ceramic material fromLamanai andCerro Maya.Howie andher coauthorsargue that dynamictrading relationshipsexistedbetween people fromLamanai andChetumalBay through time, while Millbrath andWalkerargue that theLatePostclassic censers from Cerro Maya both show long-distance relationships to northern Yucatán, and Mayapán in particular, and local ritual practices based on regional deities.

Similarly, Lisa Duffy(chapter 14) demonstrates that inhabitants of Cerro Maya duringthe Late Preclassicusedground stone to process diverse foodstuffs, while Terminal Classic people switched to primarily processing maize.

LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 28, No. 3, 2017] 
Thetwo chaptersofpart4provide greaterregional perspective on the developmental sequence of ChetumalBay. HeatherMcKillop (chapter15) situates theregionwithin broaderpatternsofwaterborne trade along the Belizean coast, .nding that coastal trade in Chetumal Bay has a much longer history than in the Classic period ports of southern Belize. Finally, David Freidel eloquently synthesizes the work of all contributors in the context of his pioneering investigation of Cerro Maya in the 1970s. Looking at the broader region, Freidel argues that Chetumal Bay was always a crossroads, a cosmopolitan region heavily in.uencedby sociopoliticaldevelopmentsin centers outsidetheregion, whichledto dynamicshifts through time. From the beginning, settlers brought outside in.uences to the region, and although the sources of in.uence ebbed and .owed, the overall pattern is of a diverse, cosmopolitan population that was boundby coastaltransport. 
The volume will appeal to Mayanists working in otherregions andservesasan outstandingexampleof what can be gained by revisiting old data with new methodological and theoretical perspectives. It also shines light on an often overlooked region, detailing signi.cant and diverse life histories of the ancient Mayafar fromthe dominant centers.

In this volume, Alicia Perea, Ana Verde Casanova, and Andrés Gutiérrez present the results of a three-year project (2010–2013) focused on a detailed study of theQuimbayaTreasure, an impressive assemblage of 135 precolumbian goldartifactskeptinthe Museo de América in Madrid. These artifacts are part of a largegroupof pottery,textiles,gold,and lithicgrave goods looted in 1890 from two Quimbaya burials in the Department ofQuindío, Colombia; they were donatedtothe Kingdomof Spainby the Colombian Government in 1893. 
The aim of the project was to produce a holistic archaeological and archaeometric study, considering both the history and materiality of the assemblage to contribute to our understanding of the society that producedit.The materials, amongthe.nestexamples of Quimbaya goldwork, were studied by an inter­national team whose comprehensive work included technical, iconographic, and contextual aspects of the gold objects. Dating, bioanthropological studies, acoustic studies of musical instruments, and a broad discussionoftheQuimbaya cultureare also included in this volume. 
The book, written in Spanish, comprises three sectionsdividedintosixteen chapters,ending witha catalog of the assemblage and nicely illustrated with high-quality images.The .rst sectionisthe main body ofthebook.Itcoversfourdifferenttopics:abiography of theassemblage; manufacturingtechniques; archae­ological contextsandiconography;and analysisofthe musical instruments. Missingin this sectionisa good mapoftheregionwiththeplaces mentionedinthetext. 
The volume starts with a thorough biography of theassemblagebyAnaVerdeCasanova: the.rstnews of its looting, the acquisition of the materialsby the Colombian Government, and their donation to the Kingdom of Spain. The vicissitudes suffered during WWI and the connection with the rest of the grave goods from both burials are also documented. This chaptermakes clearthecomplexityof studying looted objects, which are usually encountered in museum collections,anddiscussesthe problemsoflostcontexts and contradictoryinformation. 
In the second chapter, Alicia Perea and Salvador Rovira present the manufacturing techniques iden­ti.ed in the assemblage. Using a range of analyti­cal methods—such asOM, XRF, PIXE,SEM-EDX, metallography, and X-ray radiography—the authors identifythe useof alluvial goldand goldalloysin the manufacture of the artifacts; different techniques of lost wax casting; and the application of hammering and depletion gilding for certain type of artifacts, among othertechniques.
