LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 8, No. 4, 1997] 
of course, other formats may be used if they accomplish similar goals. First, to orient the reader, the 
research problem should be addressed at the outset, along with the author's intent to increase our 
understanding of this issue by contributing relevant new information from a specific geographic area. 
This serves as a "hook" to draw in readers whose own geographic interests lie outside this area. Next, 
a brief background section describing both the area and any previous investigations carried out there 
should be included, so that readers will become acquainted with the region and will understand the new 
contributions made by the information presented in the paper. Then, all of the relevant data should be 
rallied toward the research issue. Information that does not pertain directly to the problem should not 
be included. There are two reasons for this. First, extraneous data tend to dilute the focus of a problem­
oriented article, and second, space in Latin American Antiquity is severely limited. When the editors 
decide whether to accept a manuscript, they consider its length as well as the scope of its appeal. 
Finally, the article's conclusions should refer back to the introduction and show how the presented new 
data have contributed to the region and to the broader research issue. Papers that meet these criteria 
make important contributions that correspond to Latin American Antiquity's mission. 
Now that we have discussed our policies on manuscript content and organization, we turn to the peer review process. Papers that meet the requirements of broad interest and well-focused organization should fare well in the reviews. However, prospective authors should be aware that almost all manu­scripts submitted to Latin American Antiquity (or any other international journal) require some revi­sions before they are accepted for publication. Most reviewers take their responsibility seriously and offer very constructive comments. Each manuscript is read by four to six qualified researchers, who may offer diverse opinions on how to improve the article. Sometimes different reviewers may even contradict each other. Yet the editors often can define key themes that occur in several or all of the reviews. As a courtesy, all of the reviews are included in the package returned to authors, whether or not their manuscript has been accepted. This package also contains a letter from the editors explaining the manuscript's status; the categories we use include "accepted pending revision," "revise and resub­mit," and "reject." Papers that are accepted pending revision usually are not sent out for a second round of review, although, if revisions are extensive, the editors may decide that this is necessary. Papers in the "revise and resubmit" category are always reviewed again. When manuscripts fall into any category (except those that are rejected), the editors' letter outlines the next steps needed to prepare the manu­script for publication. We hope that authors find many of the reviewers' comments helpful, but we do not expect them to make every recommended change or to pay attention to every piece of advice stated by the reviewers. Instead, directions for revisions are supplied in the editors' letter, which is intended to avoid the problem of following multiple, sometimes contradictory, suggestions. Authors always have the option to explain why they do not think it is reasonable or appropriate to make the changes requested by either the reviewers or the editors. 
The reviews (and the letter from the editors that accompanies them) offer the author the opportunity to polish the manuscript and explain any details that were not clear in the first submission. We have observed, and many authors have acknowledged, that papers generally are enhanced through the review process. The reworked manuscripts also tend to be more accessible and of greater interest to larger, more diverse audiences. In the end, we think this process is the most effective way to achieve our goal of fostering communication, dialogue, and the dissemination of new information among archaeologists across the Americas.
