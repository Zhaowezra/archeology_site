SETTLEMENT, ENVIRONMENT, AND POLITICS IN THE SAN 
BARTOLO-XULTUN TERRITORY, EL PETEN, GUATEM AL A 

Thomas G. Garrison and Nicholas P. Dunning 
This article examines the cultural and ecological history of a single Maya territory from circa JOOO B.C. to A.D. 1 JOO. An ancient Maya territory is defined as an area of land and population under the jurisdiction of a particular capital. In addi­tion to the capital. there are minor centers. household groups. and temporary settlements. which together comprise the pop­ulation of a territory. Here, the San Bartolo-Xultun territory in the northeastern Department of the Peten, Guatemala is used as a case study. During more than two thousand years of occupation the natural landscape and cultural settlement pattern changed dramatically. This study isolates major factors contributing to broad changes in local culture history by employing data from archaeology, geography, remote sensing, epigraphy, and iconography. It is argued that reconstruct­ing regional culture histories using a conjunctive approach should be a major goal of Maya archaeology in the coming years as we strive for a more holistic understanding of the past. 
Este artfculo examina la historia cultural y ecol6gica de un territorio maya desde aproximadamente 1000 aiios a. C hasta I JOO 
d.C. Dentro de la civilizaci6n Maya, un territorio puede ser definido coma un area de tierra y poblaci6n bajo la jurisdicci6n de una capital particular. Adicionalmente a la capital, hay centros menores, grupos residenciales y asentamientos temporales, los cuales unidos conforman la poblaci6n entera de un territorio. En este articulo se emplea el territorio San Bartolo-Xu/tun en el noreste de! Peten, Guatemala, coma un ejemplo primario. Durante mas de dos mil aiios de ocupaci6n, el paisaje natural y el patron de asentamiento cultural fueron cambiando drasticamente. Este estudio pretende aislar las factores predominantes que contribuyeron a que grandes permutaciones se generaran en la historia cultural local, basandose en la investigaci6n arqueol6gica, la geograffa, teledetecci6n (censores remotos), epigrafia, e iconografia. Se sugiere que la reconstrucci6n de his­torias culturales regionales empleando una metodologia conjuntiva debe ser la meta principal de la arqueolog(a maya en Los pr6ximos aiios mientras las investigadores indagan una comprensi6n mas hoUstica del pasado. 
R
ecent research by the San Bartolo Regional Archaeological Project has shed some light on previously uninvestigated Maya settle­ments in the northeast Department of the Peten, Guatemala. Project director William Saturno has brought together an interdisciplinary team of archaeologists, geographers, remote sensing spe­cialists, and environmental scientists that have helped shape our understanding of settlement pat­terns. This paper focuses on investigations carried out in an approximately 430 km2 region, which Garrison (2007) has called the San Bartolo-Xultun territory. We argue that changes in the settlement pattern reflect the waxing and waning fortunes of the two principal sites of San Bartolo and Xultun, which held sway over the territory at different time periods. During the course of the Preclassic and Classic Periods the settlement around these sites was reorganized numerous times in response to both environmental and political factors. 
We begin with a definition of the territory con­cept and a physical description of the San Bartolo­Xultun territory. This is followed by a brief presentation of the research methods used to inves­tigate settlement on the San Bartolo Project. Next, we examine changes in the settlement patterns through time. Finally, we will seek explanations for these changes based on human-environmental interactions and increasingly complex lowland Maya political interactions. Contextualizing our

Definition of Territories and 
Their Components 

Territories and their boundaries have been the sub­ject of much archaeological and anthropological research in the last few decades (Johnson 1977; Lightfoot and Martinez 1995; Prescott 1987). Many of these studies and syntheses focus on intercul­tural territorial boundaries (Donnan and Wilson 2003; Lightfoot and Martinez 1995). In other words, they discuss how groups with different worldviews, belief systems, economic networks, and perhaps ethnicities establish boundaries. Sil­verstein's (2000) study of theAztec-Tarascan bor­derlands is a Mesoamerican example of this trend. There are fewer examples of studies of intra­cultural boundaries. 
Mayanists tend to discuss politics without spec­ifying hard territorial boundaries. Numerous terms have been used to describe the principal units of Maya political organization (Lucero 1999). Among them, provinces (Marcus 1993; Roys 1943), city­states (Mathews 1991:29; Thompson 1954:81), realms (Hammond 1972), regional states (Adams 1986), peer polities (Freidel I986; Sabloff 1986 ), galactic polities (Demarest 1992), superstates (Martin and Grube 1995), and overkingships (Mar­tin and Grube 2000) are the most frequently cited. It is beyond the scope of our arguments here to engage in the centralized versus segmentary state debate (Fox et al. 1996; Houston 1987a), except to say that we agree that there were aspects of both forms of organization at any given time in the Maya lowlands (Demarest 1996) and that any model addressing this issue needs to be dynamic (Marcus 1992, 1993, 1998). 
We will refer to the basic units of Maya politi­cal organization as territories. This term has occa­sionally been used by Marcus (1973, 1993) in a way that refers to the physical component of the state's control. Territories are here defined as an area of land and population under the jurisdiction of a par­ticular capital (Figure I). This is similar to Estrada­Belli 's (2006) description of the political landscape around Holmul. In our system, territories may include two or more capitals if it can be demon­strated that no two were of an equal political rank during the same time period regardless of their comparative sizes. The territory is a political entity

for certain, but it is also a self-contained social and economic entity, which distinguishes it from a hegemonic polity or "superstate" (revised to "overkingship") of the type argued for Tikal and Calakmul (Martin and Grube 1995, 2000). Terri­tories were independently organized bodies com­posed of a capital, minor centers, and numerous household group sites (Garrison 2007). The terri­torial ruler could make or break alliances with other territories at any given time. 
There is also a temporal aspect to consider when defining political structures. The territory is a flex­ible construct designed to incorporate the chang­ing circumstances of its constituent sites (Marcus 1992, 1993, 1998). The size, shape, and make-up of a territory are subject to change based on exter­nal and internal factors that influenced the fortunes of the capital(s) and by extension the royal elites of a territory. Here we will present the San Bartolo­Xultun territory as a case study of the territory con­cept. Garrison (2007) has further elaborated this case. 
The San Bartolo-Xultun territory is one of numerous territories found within the Three Rivers adaptive region (Dunning et al1998; Dunning et 
. 
al. 2003) (Figure 2). Other examples of territories from this adaptive region are the La Honradez, La Milpa, and Rio Azul-Kinal territories (Garrison 2007). The San Bartolo-Xultun territory is in the southern portion of the Azucar Lowlands physio-

graphic province of the Three Rivers region (Dun­ning et al. 2003). Within the Azucar Lowlands the territory occupies the southeast margin of the Bajo de Azucar, an enormous seasonally inundated swamp. The landscape is dissected by bajo tribu­taries (bajos connected by seasonal surface drainage) and isolated smaller bajos as the terrain gradually rises eastward. These bajos are of both palm and scrub varieties (Kunen et al. 2000). A large amount of the 433.24 km2 that make-up the San Bartolo-Xultun territory is the Bajo deAzucar itself and its major tributary, the Bajo ltz'ul, both of which are predominantly scrub bajos (stunted forest vegetation in which Palo de Tinto (Haema­toxylum campechianum), is the dominant species) (Dunning, Chmilar, Blevins, and Jones 2006). 
Determining the boundaries of the territory is a little more difficult. In many of the studies of Maya political organization summarized by Lucero ( 1999), specific boundaries are not even hypothe­sized. Smith's (2000) dissertation on the political relationship between Chichen ltza and Ek Balam is one of the first studies to test multiple intra­cultural boundary models through archaeological and ethnohistoric research. His conclusion is that territories in Late!ferminal Classic Yucatan were noncontinuous, with the political structure being maintained by elite social linkages (Smith 2000:35-88). However, the vast, flat karstic shelf of northern Yucatan does not present a good phys­iographic analogy for the southern Maya lowlands, which are characterized more by low, rolling hills and intermittent seasonal swamp depressions 
(bajos). 
Johnson (1977:491), in a discussion of human mating networks, argued that topographically bounded areas such as mountain valleys would have resulted in closed systems. Topography and physiography probably had a similar influence on political structure, but on a gradient. The greater the landscape relief or frequency of prominent physiographic features, the more closed the polit­ical structure would become. The social linkages proposed by Smith (2000) for northern Yucatan probably existed in the southern lowlands, but they would have been high-level alliances between autonomous local states whose immediate bound­aries were natural. Dennis Puleston (1973: 16) pro­posed that bajos represented natural "buffers" in many areas of the central lowlands. Pules ton (197 4) also used emic (Tikal earthworks) and etic (calcu­lated settlement densities) criteria to estimate the non-bajo boundaries of Tikal. Recently, Golden and Scherer (2006:3) argued that even along the Usumacinta, where the river was critical to all polit­ical entities, boundaries "were marked by dramatic shifts and breaks in the geography of the river chan­nel and its adjacent valleys." Natural boundaries are represented in both the ethnographic and ethno­historic record for Mesoamerica. Among the Chorti Maya in the 1930s, boundaries were marked by "a ; fallen tree, a slight rise in the trail, a large boulder, or the crossing of the trail by a stream" (Wisdom 1940:206). For the sixteenth-century Zapotec, doc­uments such as the Lienza de Guevea demonstrate that boundaries were defined by rivers, named peaks, and other natural features (Marcus 1983:304, 1984:56-58). 
Assuming that natural boundaries would have been significant in the precolumbian periods as well, Garrison (2007) defined the San Bartolo­Xultun territorial boundaries by looking at the most significant natural features surrounding the major settlements (Figure 3). The western boundary of the San Bartolo-Xultun territory runs through the Bajo de Azucar from the source of the Rio Tikal to an area south-southwest where raised patches of ter­rain come out of the bajo. The southern border is defined by medium-sized scrub bajos, one of which begins the drainage of the Ixcanrfo. The Ixcanrfo then flows northward delimiting the eastern bound­ary of the territory, eventually flowing into the Rfo Tikal, which defines the northern limit of the ter­ritory. Analysis of IKONOS satellite imagery indi­cates that a number of channels connect to the south side of the Rio Tikal and run generally southward into the Bajo de Azucar and toward San Bartolo and La Prueba (Dunning, Akpinar, Carr, Griffin, Jones, Lentz, Miller, and Prater 2008; Dunning, Griffin, Sever 2008). While these channels may be largely natural in origin, some human modifications and extensions were made at least in the Late Clas­sic (Dunning and Griffin 2009). 
Within the San Bartolo-Xultun territory Garri­son (2007) isolated seven possible site types, which were clustered into four groups of settlements. These identifications were made by applying Gud­erjan 's (1991) modified site scoring methodology (adapted from Adams and Jones 1981) to the entire Three Rivers Region, including the San Bartolo-

Some site divisions are likely. The four major settlement types were clustered together since distinctions forms discussed here are capitals, minor centers, were made based primarily on survey and recon-household groups, and temporary settlements.

Capitals 
Capitals are the largest sites found in the Maya area and represent the heads of territories. These are sites like Tikal, Calakmul, Copan, Yaxchilan, Naranjo, Piedras Negras, and other famous centers that have attracted scholars and tourists to the Maya area since the nineteenth century. Capitals are iden­tified by the presence of: one or usually more large public plazas, multiple courtyard groups, one or more ball courts, one or more stelae (usually carved), and multiple monumental structures. In addition, every well-investigated capital site that dates to the Classic Period has an Emblem Glyph signifying the presence of a k'uhul ajaw ("holy lord"), or at least an ajaw ("lord"). Capitals were the home to the royal Maya court (Inomata and Houston 2001) and presented the stages for the per­formance of theater state rituals (Demarest 1992). San Bartolo (Figure 4) and Xultun (Von Euw 1978:6-7) were successive capitals, with San Bar­tolo predating Xultun. 
Minor Centers 
In analyzing settlements in the Three Rivers Region, Garrison (2007) identified secondary and tertiary centers, which were clustered into the cat­egory of minor centers. The minor centers defined here are drastically different from those presented in settlement hierarchies that try to cover the entire Maya area (Adams and Jones 1981; Marcus 1976). Under no circumstances would a minor center (as defined here) have an Emblem Glyph. It is possi­ble that there would be toponyms (Stuart and Hous­ton 1994) identifying minor centers, but they would definitely be subsumed under a capital center's Emblem Glyph. Each minor center exhibits some, but not all, of the following attributes: one or more public plazas, one or more courtyard groups, a ball court, one or more stelae (often blank), and one or more monumental structure. From a sociopolitical standpoint, minor centers would have been man­aged by nonroyal elites, probably sajalob in some regions (Jackson 2005: 129-130), although this title

is not common in the northeast Peten. The minor centers would have had a number of household group sites loosely tethered to them in a hierarchi­cal relationship. The site of Chaj K'ek' Cue (Fig­ure 5) in the San Bartolo-Xultun territory is a good example of a minor center. 
Secondary and tertiary centers were lumped together for two reasons. First, the distinction between the two seems to be one of size rather than function. Depending on the geography of the region there may be limited appropriate space for minor centers of any given size. Second, many sites clas­sified as minor centers in the San Bartolo-Xultun territory have not been investigated, with the excep­tion of brief reconnaissance or mapping. Since site scores are derived from counts of features detected during investigations (Adams and Jones 1981; Gud­erjan 1991), it is likely that some features were missed during reconnaissance, which would lead to fluctuations in scores. These fluctuations would blur any perceived division between possible sec­ondary and tertiary centers. 
Minor centers played an important role in the organization of the territorial hinterland, and need to receive more attention in Maya archaeology, especially in the lowlands. Perhaps the most thor­ough investigations of minor centers in relation to a territorial capital have been in the Copan Valley. There the minor centers of Rfo Amarillo (Satumo 2000), El Raizal, and Los Achiotes (Canuto 2002) were all investigated as hinterland centers to the 

Copan capital. 
Household Groups 
Household group sites are the most common site found in the Maya lowlands. These sites are scat­tered throughout the forest, but were probably loosely tethered to a nearby minor center. These sites are very small and sometimes have no plas­tered architecture. The sites can consist of either single (Figure 6) or multiple (Figure 7) courtyard groups, depending on whether there is a nuclear family occupying the former or an extended fam­ily occupying the latter. Richard Wilk (1988:138-142) has provided a convincing review of the ethnohistoric and ethnographic evidence that supports these two types of households. The pres­ence of multiple courtyards indicates a larger fam­ily that has either resided longer in the area or had a particularly great number of children in one gen-

eration that led to an expansion of the settlement. The function of these settlements as agricultural subsistence households appears to have been the same regardless of whether the site is that of a nuclear or an extended family. Wilk (1988:140) notes that there is no consistency in postmarital residence behavior in the available Maya sources. Perhaps careful excavation in which numerous sub­floor burials were found could yield the genetic evi­dence that would be necessary to address ancient Maya kin patterns at the level of the rural house­hold. 
While household group sites occasionally have a single monumental structure, usually a family temple, there are rarely stelae or formal ball courts associated with these settlements. Household group sites should not be confused with courtyard groups that are found within minor centers and capitals. Household group sites are only defined as such when they are located remote from any larger order settlement grouping. 
Temporary Settlements 
Temporary settlements represent the poorest set­tlement remains of the ancient Maya. Remains of sites of this type generally consist of rectangles of rock cobbles that appear to be oriented as structure platforms, as opposed to rock piles produced while testing the quality of raw material for stone tool manufacture (Griffin et al. 2006; Kwoka and Grif­fin 2005). Despite their appearance as architectural features the associated material culture is little to none. Sites of this type are generally found in asso­ciation with probable agricultural features such as terraces or linear rock formations assumed to have been field walls or otherwise related to cultivation (Figure 8). For this reason the sites are considered to be field houses or generally temporary or sea­sonal residences. Such ephemeral residences are known from other parts of the Maya area, includ­ing the Puuc region where these features are found both in rural zones and on the fringes or urban cen­ters and are easier to define because of their lack

As with any settlement typology, the one out­lined above is to some extent an idealization of reality. Distinctions between the upper and lower members of each categories are sometimes blurred and may not have been static (i.e., there was likely movement between categories through time). For example, while household groups as we define them rarely contained formal monumental archi­tecture and ball courts, exceptions are known. The small site of Chawak Bat'o'b near the Rio Bravo in northwestern Belize is clearly more akin to a large household group than it is to a minor center, yet it includes a small ball court (Walling et al. 2007). Similarly the very small site of Quincunx, a household group or cluster of such groups in the hinterland of the large center of Blue Creek in northwestern Belize, included a modest solar obser­vatory complex (Zaro and Lohse 2005). Such fea­tures are not unexpected given that both the rural and urban components of the population were par­ticipants in the same cultural system. 
Settlements of the San Bartolo-Xultun 
Territory 

The two largest sites in the territory are by far San Bartolo and Xultun, especially in terms of volume of architecture. These sites were respectively the Late Preclassic and Classic Period capitals to the extensive hinterland settlements found dispersed across the nearby upland terrain. Xultun has received some attention from archaeologists, but these studies have been for the purposes of monu­ment recording (Morley 1937-1938; Von Euw 1978; Von Euw and Graham 1984) and epigraphic interpretation (Garrison and Stuart 2004; Houston 1986). San Bartolo is the most thoroughly investi­gated site in the territory, having been the subject of a long-term interdisciplinary project (Urquizu

The sites of La Prueba, Chaj K' ek' Cue, Oxtun, Las Minas, and Casas Pintadas (sometimes called K'ak' Quij Kwaribaal) represent minor centers in the territory that would have had a certain number of household groups under their control. La Prueba reached its size probably due to its isolation on a large island within scrub bajo. The three uncarved stelae found at Oxtun may have been eastern boundary markers for the territory, displayed prominently at this site near the Ixcanrio. 
El Noticiero and La Pilita are both examples of household, multiple courtyard groups in the San Bartolo-Xultun territory, while La Pr6xima repre­sents a single family courtyard site. There are numerous other unnamed household sites through­out the territory, particularly in the San Bartolo­Xultun intersite area (Figures 6 and 7) (Garrison 2007). There are also significant, uninvestigated settlements to the west of Xultun, as identified in satellite imagery by Satumo, Garrison, and col­leagues from NASA, and which we surmise are additional minor centers based on their apparent size in the imagery. 
Range structures of significant size were found at Las Minas, La Prueba, and Casas Pintadas, while large, possibly elite, residential groups have been found at Oxtun, Chaj K'ek' Cue, El Noticiero, and La Pilita. Smaller settlements are found through­out the territory on almost every portion of exten­sive upland terrain, or montafia. There is evidence

of agricultural terracing rising out of scrub bajo margins in many areas. Numerous aguadas are also located throughout the territory with many appear­ing to have been modified by the Maya (Akpinar et al. 2008; Dunning, Chmilar, Blevins, and Jones 2006; Dunning, Akpinar, Carr, Griffin, Jones, Lentz, Miller, and Prater 2008; Dunning et al. 2009). There are abundant chert resources in the territory, including some large deposits that show evidence of ancient quarrying activities (Griffin et al. 2006). 
Methods for Investigating Settlement, 
Environment, and Politics in the San 
Bartolo-Xultun Territory 

The interpretations made in this article draw on the work of many members of the San Bartolo Project. In this section we briefly present some of the field methods that were used to interpret the cultural and ecological history of the San Bartolo-Xultun terri­tory. Ancient settlement was investigated through reconnaissance, survey, and excavation. Paleoen­vironmental research at the site employed a vari­ety of field and lab techniques to partially reconstruct the ancient regional ecology and human-environment interactions. Finally, studies of ancient Maya iconography and epigraphy have shaped the interpretation of Maya political inter­actions. Here we have integrated these three lines of study using a conjunctive approach with the goal of presenting a more holistic interpretation of the archaeological record (Fash and Sharer 1991; Wil­ley 1980). 
Reconnaissance, Survey, and Excavation 
Most of our knowledge of smaller settlements within the San Bartolo-Xultun territory comes from numerous reconnaissance trips made between 2003 and 2005. The regional reconnaissance has been under the overall direction of project director William Saturno, with various expeditions also being led by Garrison, Robert Griffin, and Joshua K woka. This aspect of the territorial research has relied heavily on the use of IKONOS satellite imagery, provided to the project by NASA, to detect previously uninvestigated settlements (Garrison 2007: 123-130; Garrison et al. 2004; Saturno et al. 2006; Saturno et al. 2007). High-resolution GPS points were taken for each settlement and we made notes of the major architectural features (i.e., num­ber of plazas, general size of structures), which facilitated the use of site scoring in settlement pat­terns studies (Garrison 2007). 
Garrison conducted systematic survey at San Bartolo, Chaj K'ek' Cue, and in the San Bartolo­Xultun intersite area between 2002 and 2005, with a regional test pitting program accompanying the intersite survey (Garrison 2007:130-151). There are 240 known structures at San Bartolo including four major pyramid complexes and a large palace structure. The minor center of Chaj K'ek' Cue is located in the San Bartolo-Xultun intersite area. There are over 40 known structures at the site and a great number (19) of chultuns (bedrock cisterns) as well. In addition to Chaj K' ek' Cue, the San Bartolo-Xultun intersite area is made up of numer­ous household courtyard groups. Garrison (2007) mapped a stratified random sample of 2.5 km2 in the intersite area, revealing ancient settlement, agri­cultural features, and resource exploitation areas. Eric Von Euw (1978) surveyed the major architec­tural groups at Xultun in the 1970s, building on Morley's (1937-1938) early work in the 1920s. The Xultun map data have been incorporated into the project's regional GIS (Saturno et al. 2007), but it is clear from reconnaissance that Xultun is the largest site in the territory and is in desperate need of systematic survey since it is already one of the most heavily looted sites in the northeastern Peten (Quintana and Wurster 2001). Preliminary sys­tematic mapping and test excavations began at Xul­tun in 2008 under the direction of William Saturno (Urquizu and Satumo 2008). 
Members of the San Bartolo Project have exca­vated in many contexts, including: salvage opera­tions, test-pitting programs, architectural tunneling, and horizontal exposures. The first three of these methods contribute to our understanding of the regional settlement pattern since they have all yielded important chronological data, while hori­zontal exposures have been important in defining final phase architectural characteristics. The details of the San Bartolo excavation data may be found in the edited preliminary reports by Urquizu and Saturno (2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008).

the San Bartolo-Xultun territory have been directed by Nicholas Dunning from 2005 to the present, supported by palynological laboratory analysis by John G. Jones and paleobotanical analysis by David Lentz (Dunning, Chmilar, Blevins, and Jones 2006; Dunning, Akpinar, Carr, Griffin, Jones, Lentz, Miller, and Prater 2008; Dunning et al. 2009). This work has focused on the investigation of aguadas (man-made or anthropogenically modified ponds), bajos, and arroyos. The field methods used include coring and excavations of several aguadas aimed at recovering pollen and the use history of these water sources, and geoarchaeological excavations in several bajos to obtain data for the reconstruc­tion of paleoenvironments and environmental change as reflected in changes in vegetation, ero­sion rates, and hydrology (Dunning et al. 2009). Some of these data have appeared elsewhere in print (Akpinar et al. 2008; Dunning, Chmilar, Blevins, and Jones 2006; Dunning, Beach, and Luzzadder-Beach 2006; Dunning, Akpinar, Carr, Griffin, Jones, Lentz, Miller, and Prater 2008; Dun­ning, Griffin, and Sever 2008; Dunning et al. 2009). 
Iconography and Epigraphy 
The territorial capitals of San Bartolo and Xultun possess abundant iconographic and epigraphic data in the form of murals, pot-bellied monuments, ste­lae, and looted polychrome vessels. The first two categories are found exclusively at San Bartolo, while the latter two are restricted to Xultun with a few exceptions. Saturno, Taube, and Stuart (2005) have studied the iconography of the San Bartolo murals. Additionally, Satumo, Stuart, and Beltran (2006) examined some of the early writing found during tunneling excavations within the Pinturas pyramid. Jessica Craig (2004) excavated the largest pot-bellied monument at the site and analyzed the ritual activity associated with the monument. This monument is located near the Preclassic royal palace that was reopened in the late Classic and likely was used in ancestor cult rituals like similar monuments at other sites (Thompson and Valdez 2008). 
The monuments and polychrome ceramics of Xultun have been known to scholars for much longer than the hieratic art of San Bartolo, but they remain poorly understood. The monuments are dif­ficult to read due to their poor state of preservation while the ceramics come exclusively from illicit excavations destroying important contextual infor­mation. After Morley's pioneering inscription­finding expeditions, further efforts at monument registration were made by Eric Von Euw of the Corpus of Maya Hieroglyphic Inscriptions project. Von Euw's (1978; Von Euw and Graham 1984) publications remain the best source for the study of Xultun's stelae. Stephen Houston (1986) made the first modem epigraphic study of the Xultun texts in which he added to Morley's original work on the Long Count dates from the site and identi­fied the Xultun Emblem Glyph. Garrison and Davicl Stuart (2004) looked at all of the known monuments and ceramic texts from the site and argued that Xul­tun was a significant political entity by the Early Classic. In addition to these investigations, Xultun has often been mentioned in passing in broader epigraphic studies (e.g., Martin and Grube 2000; Mathews 1985). 
A Cultural and Ecological History of the San Bartolo-Xultun Territory 
This section integrates all of the diverse data sets generated by the investigations described above in order to present a comprehensive interpretation of the cultural and ecological history of the San Bartolo-Xultun territory. This follows in the tradi­tion of Gordon Willey's (1980) call for a more holistic Maya archaeology. Long-term projects at Copan (Fash and Sharer 1991 ), in the Petexbatun (Demarest 1997, 2004, 2006; Houston 1993 ), and the Programme for Belize (Scarborough et al. 2003) are among the best examples of the large-scale application of this conjunctive approach to archae­ology in the Maya Lowlands. 
The Archaic and Early Preclassic Periods (6000-1000 B. C.) 
Environmental conditions and resource distribu­tion were likely major deciding factors in the ini­tial settlement of the Maya lowlands. This has been demonstrated through archaeological and pale­oenvironmental research in the Petexbatun region (Dunning et al. 1997; O'Mansky and Dunning 2004 ). The landscape encountered by the first Maya settlers was not the same as the one found today by archaeologists and other explorers of the Peten (Dunning, Beach, and Luzzadder-Beach 2006).

1000 B.C. There is however, limited paleoenvi­ronmental data that sheds some light on what the terrain may have looked like when the first settlers entered the northeast Peten. Buried soil sutfaces have been found in several bajos including the huge Bajo de Azucar (lower: 14,280-13,530 cal B.C. [2 sigma range; upper: 920-800 cal. B.C. [2 sigma range]; Dunning and Griffin 2009), the large Bajo Itz'ul (5240-4960 cal B.C. [2 sigma range]; Dun­ning, Chmilar, Blevins, and Jones 2006), and the smaller, more elevated Bajo Donato (lower: 11,140-10,900 cal B.C. [2 sigma range]; upper: 1000-800 cal B.C. [2 sigma range]) (Dunning, Akpinar, Carr, Griffin, Jones, Lentz, Miller, and Prater 2008) (Figure 9), and the Bajo Majunche (see below). The radiocarbon dates associated with these buried sutfaces are derived from bulk organic matter and are only a rough approximation of sur­face age. Analysis of fossil pollen and carbon iso­topes indicate considerable variability among the bajos with an herbaceous, perennial wetland and shallow lake in the Bajo Majunche, a shrubby grass­land that evolved into a mixed wetland forest in the Bajo Donato, and a swamp forest in the Bajo ltz'ul 
(Dunning, Chmilar, Blevins, and Jones 2006; Dun­ning et al. 2009). 
The Middle Preclassic Period (1000-400 B.C.) 

The first evidence of human activity in the San Bartolo-Xultun territory, comes from a paleosol recovered from the Bajo Majunche, located in the intersite area, 1.5 km southeast of Chaj K' ek' Cue. This buried Ab horizon has been radiocarbon dated to 920-800 cal B.C. (2 sigma) (Dunning, Chmilar, Blevins, and Jones 2006), right at the beginning of the Middle Preclassic (Figure 10). The soil itself is an organic clay derived from compressed organic muck that probably formed within a perennial wet­land (Dunning, Chmilar, Blevins, and Jones 2006). Ancient pollen preserved in the Ab horizon indi­cates a forested environment surrounding a wetland at the time the soil formed. The presence of water lilies (Nymphea) and cattail reeds (Typha) are par­ticularly indicative of standing water and are species that are definitely not present in the Bajo Majunche today. Minimal disturbance taxa (Aster­aceae, Poaceae) suggest that there was limited for­est clearing during this time, but the low number

of charcoal fragments counted suggest that this 
clearing was not taking place too close to the loca­
tion of the buried soil and because a relatively intact 
swamp forest environment was successfully filter­
ing out the charcoal (Dunning, Chmilar, Blevins, 
and Jones 2006). The idea of a pristine landscape 
filled with standing water with cattail reeds and 
water lilies and abundant forest resources is remi­
niscent of the later concept of pu, or Tollan, as the 
"Place of Cattails." In later times the "Place of Cat­
tails" is associated with origin myths and the myth­
ical foundations of major Mesoamerican political 
powers from Central Mexico to Oaxaca to the Maya 
area (Stuart 2000:501-506). 

Amongst these wetlands, early farmers estab­lished small villages on the largest stretches of upland terrain. At San Bartolo some public monu­mental architecture was constructed on a roughly east-west axis toward the end of the Middle Pre­classic. Stone for this construction was quarried from what later became the site's main aguada (Dunning, Chmilar, Blevins, and Jones 2006; Dun­ning et al. 2009). The Ixkik substructure of Pinturas (Beltran 2005) and the Ixtab platform and Bak Na substructure ofVentanas (Urquizu 2003) were most likely contemporary public architectural features at the site. Excavations into the Ixtab platform found a Spondylus shell dating to the Middle Preclassic (Urquizu 2003). This indicates widespread exchange networks were in place during this early period. The Bak Na substructure, in particular, with its tiered architecture has a form more associated with a ritual function rather than any residential use. 
Preliminary evidence also suggests that there may have been a Middle Preclassic occupation at sub­structures beneath the Jabalf Complex (Pellecer Alecio 2004 ). Although there is only direct archae­ological evidence from San Bartolo, we suspect that a similar, small Middle Preclassic community was founded at Xultun during this period as well. There is no evidence for Middle Preclassic occupation in the intersite area, but this may have been due to the presence of perennial wetlands. 
While there is no direct evidence of intersite settlement during the Middle Preclassic, there is evidence for agricultural and other human activity coming from Aguada Tintal located 7 km northeast of San Bartolo. The lowest pollen-bearing stratum in this core yielded a radiocarbon date of780-410 cal B.C. (2 sigma) (Dunning, Chmilar, Blevins, and Jones 2006), covering the latter portion of the Mid­dle Preclassic Period. Pollen from this section of the core indicates that maize, cotton, and manioc were all being cultivated in the area of the aguada (Dunning, Chmilar, Blevins, and Jones 2006) and probably represent territory-wide domesticates. Construction of a clay berm stabilized by a rough wall of cherty boulders around the aguada buried a soil surface radiocarbon dated to 850-780 cal BC [2 sigma range] (Akpinar et al. 2008; Dunning, Akpinar, Carr, Griffin, Jones, Lentz, Miller, anq 
· 
Prater 2008; Dunning et al. 2009). Meanwhile, clay sediments were beginning to accumulate atop the soil surface in the Bajo Donato surrounding Aguada Tintal indicative of forest clearance and erosion on sloping land, a process that would continue into the Late Preclassic. 
The Late Preclassic Period (400 B. C.-A.D. 300) 

The Late Preclassic witnessed a population explo­sion in the San Bartolo-Xultun territory as well as in other parts of the Maya lowlands (Culbert and Rice 1990). San Bartolo grew as a capital with mul­tiple construction phases evident in all of the major architecture at the site dating to this period. Between 300-200 B.C. there is evidence of fully developed hieroglyphic writing in the form of a painted stucco block (Satumo, Stuart, and Beltran 2006). The text from this block contains the glyph AJAW (ajaw, "lord, noble or ruler") (Satumo, Stu­art, and Beltran 2006: 1282), demonstrating the antiquity of this term and suggesting that there was a central figure during this period who was com­missioning the major architectural programs. Other stucco fragments found in a similar context depict an early image of the maize god (Beltran 2005). 
During the latter part of the Late Preclassic the site plan of San Bartolo underwent an axis shift to a north-south orientation (Garrison and Satumo 2008). The large main plaza and causeway to the south effectively changed the alignment of San Bartolo to adhere to emerging site canons estab­lished in the central Peten (Ashmore 1991; Ash­more and Sabloff 2002). The major murals for which San Bartolo is famous were also constructed around this time, between 100 B.C.-A.D. I (Sat­umo et al. 2005). While there is no direct evidence from Xultun or elsewhere, it would appear that San Bartolo emerged as the major center in the terri­tory in the Late Preclassic. Late Preclassic archi-

tecture of the size found at San Bartolo is not found in looter trenches cutting through the major final phase Late Classic (and probably major Early Clas­sic) architecture at Xultun (Garrison and Saturno 2008). This suggests that San Bartolo had larger monumental construction than any contemporary settlement at Xultun. Since San Bartolo and Xul­tun are the only sites within a 10 km radius to con­tain ceremonial temple-pyramids, it is likely that San Bartolo was the territorial capital during this time period. This assumes that monumentality is one of a number of indicators of Maya political power (Guderjan 1991). 
During this period, settlement began to appear in the San Bartolo-Xultun intersite area and also along the northern Xultun periphery. Domestic ceramic types that span the entire Preclassic, such as those from the Achiotes Group (Culbert 1993), are found in numerous contexts, suggesting that this population growth may have begun during the early portion of the period (though this has yet to be proven). The only identifiable ceramics from an excavation near a chert quarry in the intersite area date to the Late Preclassic, suggesting that these sources of raw lithic material were important dur­ing the early periods of settlement. Based on the total contexts in which Late Preclassic ceramics were found (i.e., presence/absence), the Late Pre­classic intersite area had 19 structures/km2 and was home to over 1,500 people (Garrison 2008). 
While no systematic excavations or surface col­lections have been made in other areas, there are indications of Late Preclassic settlements through­out the territory. For example, a few of the ceram­ics collected from the cleaning of four looter trenches at Chaj K'ek' Cue date to the Late Pre­classic (Garrison 2003). Observations during reconnaissance of looter trench backfill indicate a Late Preclassic presence at Oxtun and around La Prueba. Finally, the architectural profile left by a large looter trench at Casas Pintadas suggests that there was a Late Preclassic phase at this site as well. Nevertheless, none of the evidence at the small settlements in these areas indicates that there was any sort of development comparable to what was at San Bartolo during this period. For this reason we argue that the San Bartolo-Xultun territory took its political form during the Late Preclassic, with San Bartolo emerging as the capital. It appears, however, that the increased rural population found throughout the territory began to take a toll on the physical landscape, leading to a serious subsistence crisis at the end of the Preclassic. 
The Late Preclassic to Early Classic transition took place during the third century A.D. and may have begun in the San Bartolo-Xultun territory as early as the mid-second century A.D. At San Bar­tolo, as well as in the San Bartolo-Xultun intersite area, there is a near total abandonment of the rural settlement at the end of the Late Preclassic, as evi­denced by the virtual absence of Early Classic ceramics. Within the region the last centuries of the Late Preclassic were a time of significant land­scape instability. Severe soil erosion is evident on the flanks of the Bajo Donato (Figure 9), though the Maya attempted to respond with the construc­tion of agricultural terraces (Dunning, Akpinar, Carr, Griffin, Jones, Lentz, Miller, and Prater 2008; Dunning et al. 2009). Such landscape instability seems to have been characteristic of many parts of the central and southern Maya Lowlands at this time, with large quantities of soil being lost from sloping land and accumulating as sediment in lakes and bajos (Anselmetti et al. 2007; Beach et al. 2006; Dunning and Beach 2000; Dunning et al. 2002; Gunn et al. 2002). In some instances, such as in the Bajo Majunche (Figure 10), this aggra­dation resulted in permanent changes in the hydrol­ogy of the wetland, transforming it from a perennially to seasonally moist environment. 
Paleoenvironmental, ceramic, and architectural data all support a major change in settlement pat­terns throughout the San Bartolo-Xultun territory during this transition. A period of increased fre­quency and severity of drought between aboutA.D. 150 and 250 has been proposed for some areas of the Maya lowlands (Brenner et al. 2002; Dunning et al. 2002; Haug et al. 2003; Hodell et al. 2001; Rosenmeier et al. 2002; Wahl et al. 2006). This cli­matic stress may have been the final blow in an increasingly deteriorating ecological context, which led to the abandonment of San Bartolo and the intersite area during this time period. A major drying event is observed in the Tintal Aguada, northeast of San Bartolo and, while the dating is insecure, stratigraphy suggests that it may have occurred at the Late Preclassic to Early Classic transition (Dunning et al. 2009). Further environ­mental stress is indicated by the decreasing thick­ness in plaster floors at San Bartolo, which could

have resulted from less firewood availability for the production of lime plaster or from the exhaustion of prime calcite-rich limestone; both defeorestation and excessive quarrying likely contributed to accel­erated soil erosion and hydro logic changes (Hansen 2000; Satumo 2002; Schreiner 2002). 
The consequence of the environmental stress and degradation described above was the aban­donment of San Bartolo as well as the Late Pre­classic settlement in the intersite area. This is indicated by the near nonexistence of Early Clas­sic ceramics in these areas. Early Classic material represents less than 2 percent of the total ceramic assemblage at San Bartolo, and what does exist comes mostly from a ritual context at the Jabali Complex (Rivera Castillo 2005; Rivera Castillo and Sagebiel 2004 ). It has been argued that pro­posed Early Classic gaps in ceramic records do not reflect abandonments, but rather are a result of the fact that the Early Classic is a much shorter time period than the preceding Late Preclassic and that some Chicanel ceramics may have continued to be used into the Early Classic (Rice and Culbert 1990; Sullivan and Sagebiel 2003). Nevertheless, inde­pendent evidence from architectural analysis at San Bartolo confirms that the site was abandoned for an extended period of time. The final substructure in the Tigrillo Complex dates to the Late Preclas­sic, while the final phase represents a Late Classic remodeling. Weathering and damage to the stucco of the final substructure indicate that it was exposed without maintenance for several centuries, con­firming the general abandonment seen in ceramic analysis (Runggaldier 2006). 
The findings at San Bartolo underscore the severity of disruption that accompanied the Preclassic-to-Classic transition in some parts of the Maya Lowlands, at least some of which can be attributed to the necessity of adapting to environ­mental instability (Dunning, Beach, and Luzzadder-Beach 2006; Dunning et al. 2007). This instability included growing scarcity or unreliabil­ity of water sources, likely due to both droughts and anthropogenic hydrologic changes. Thus, it is not surprising that the establishment, re-establishment, or continuity of Maya kingdoms at this juncture was often accompanied by both an investment in water­storage infrastructure and the increased importance of water-related rituals in the definition of royal authority (Dunning et al. 1999; Lucero 2003, 2006; Scarborough 1993, 1998). 
The Early Classic Period (A.D. 300-600) 
Whatever calamity led to the abandonment of San Bartolo and the intersite area at the end of the Late Preclassic, Xultun seems to have maintained a dense population through the Early Classic. One reason for Xultun's survival may have been its more numerous, generally larger, and possibly better managed aguadas (Akpinar et al. 2008; Dunning et al. 2009). It is likely that the surviving hinter­land populations, including the residents of San Bartolo, nucleated around the center of Xultun. It is unclear what role the San Bartolo elites would have had in this situation, whether they simply moved their rule to Xultun or became subservient to an existing elite population. Recent work by Sat­urno and colleagues will hopefully be able to address these issues (Urquizu and Satumo 2008). 
Most of the Early Classic stelae at Xultun are from the northern Group B. Three stelae at the site are securely dated to the Early Classic based on cal­endrical information with an additional three being stylistically dated to the period as well. The earli­est securely dated monument at the site is Stela 20, which celebrates the ninth baktun Period Ending in A.D. 435. While it is possible that Stela 12 pre­dates Stela 20, based on their stylistic similarities they are probably both early fifth century A.D. monuments (Garrison and Stuart 2004 ). If the aban­donment of San Bartolo took place as early as A.D. 150, then it may have taken more than 250 years for the capital to shift to Xultun and for an elite dynasty to emerge. Perturbations in the course of Maya dynasties, some spanning many generations, were not unusual (Martin and Grube 2000). More often than not, kingdoms managed to revitalize rather than disappear, a resilience that likely reflects the deeply rooted nature of ritualized authority in Maya civilization (Lucero 2003, 2006). 
On Stela 18 (Figure 11 ), an important monu­ment dated stylistically to the sixth century A.D., a ruler, Ahknal, is named as the thirty-third in the line of the founder of the Xultun dynasty (Garri­son and Stuart 2004; see Houston 1993 for a sim­ilar reading of WINIK as "20" in a text from Arroyo de Piedra). If this statement is true then the Xultun dynasty certainly predates the fifth century monuments. In terms of Xultun' s relation with the Preclassic capital at San Bartolo, there are two pos-
