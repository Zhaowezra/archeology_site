Cost is a factor, but Routledge could surely manage a CD or a link to online images, if color in the book is prohibitive. Sec­ond, the most interesting chapter in the book is the final one, labeled "Afterword." In this chapter, Quilter draws together the threads of Andean prehistory developed throughout the text and makes many important observa­tions and interpretations. A more descriptive title (e.g., "The Patterns of Andean Prehistory") would help signal to users how important it is. These are minor quibbles, and I highly recommend The Ancient Central Andes for anyone teaching the topic. Based on past history, it will be a while before we see a more advanced text.

In his latest book, Gabriel Ramon Joffre seeks to demon­strate the importance of seasonal migrant potters in the 
Andes and to offer directions to better identify their work 
in the archaeological records. His background in archae­
ology, colonial studies, and history allows him to offer 
a socio-historical and socio-political perspective of the potters' work, and a provocative critique of the state of ceramic data interpretation, the use of ethnographic anal­ogy, and the lack of attention given to utilitarian ware by Andean archaeologists. His criticisms of Andean archae­ology aim to show that the concept of itinerant potters is not considered (enough) in data interpretation. His style is dynamic, direct, and categorical. 
After introducing the book and geographical context, Ramon presents methodological considerations central to his argument: the problem of flawed ethnographic analogies; the necessity of revising the concept of pottery production based on the concept of technical style (which includes technological traits, forms, and decoration, cf. 
p. 45), place of manufacture, and distribution networks; the importance of inter-Andean variability of technical styles; and the danger of using local traits as generalities for a region. 
Ramon's criticism of the bad use of ethnographic analogy by Andean archaeologists is built on a 1938 arti­cle by Julio Tello (pp. 34--38), who used ethnographic accounts of utilitarian ware production to interpret elite data and draw generalities about ceramic production. 
This ongoing practice, says Ramon, leads to the homog­enization of the cultural panorama, instead of acknowl­edging diversity. 
Ramon probably knows the literature too well to ignore that, in 77 years, viewpoints have changed. Inter­est in domestic contexts and advances in the study of material remains with analytical technologies such as petrography, scanning electron microscopy, and chemical analysis, allow us now to look at ceramic production and distribution of utilitarian (and other) wares in a much more convincing manner. These analyses help distin­guish the nonlocal character of many plain wares. 
As for the lack of focus on utilitarian ware, Ramon forgets publications like those of Tellenbach or Ulbert, who analyzed ceramics from the Formative site of Mon­tegrande, which are mostly utilitarian. Also, the ceramic studies edited by Izumi Shimada ( 1994 Tecnolog{a y organizaci6n de la producci6n de cerdmica prehispdnica en las Andes) do not all deal with elite ware, while other studies recognize the difference between elite, ceremo­nial, and utilitarian ware productions (e.g., the works of Chapdelaine and colleagues on Moche ceramic produc­tion, or Stovel in San Pedro de Atacama). 
In addition, local wares are now more regularly dis­tinguished from foreign productions based on character­ization studies and comparison with geological data and comparative materials-ethnographic or not-contrary to what Ramon says (note 26, p. 46). Finally, the chaine operatoire and technical styles might be concepts emerg­ing in Peru but commonly used in Argentina or Chile (e.g., the works of De la Fuente, Drue, Falabella, Ghezzi, Hayashida, Lopez, Makowski, Masucci, Paez, Puente, 
Roddick, Vaughn, Williams, and their colleagues). 
In Chapter 4, Ramon defines golondrinos as migrant workers, delineates their seasonal schedule and travel habits, and presents the useful concepts of village base (pueblo base) and destination village (pueblo destino) 
(p. 52). In Chapter 5, he reviews some notions about exchange of products and circulation of pots, offers a potters' typology, and describes in more detail the routes, destination, work, and categories of itinerant potters, with ad hoc examples. From a pool of case studies, without mentioning prior interviews of some of the potters he investigates or offering a detailed lit­erature review, Ramon extracts recurrences to help iden­tify the presence of itinerant potters and to support his model of local and nonlocal productions of domestic ware. In Chapter 6, Ramon offers a synthesis of the observations and cases previously presented in an analysis of the geography of techniques, dynamic of the chaine operatoire, and itineraries of golondrinos. The tendencies he observes in technical styles, raw materials, and ware production are pointers to help rec­ognize the work of itinerant potters. Ramon also high-

lights the importance of studying exterior (decorative) and interior styles (p. 109). The latter is not defined, but paste studies (mineralogy, granulometry, paste tex­ture, and pigment composition) can distinguish one technical style from another and are particularly good for plain or non-diagnostic fragments. 
Beside these flaws, the synthesis and data theorization on Andean itinerant potters are probably Ramon's most important contribution to the field. His work joins ethno­graphical and ethnoarchaeological studies on ceramic production and distribution conducted in the Andes by Arnold, Bankes, Camino, Drue, Hagstrum, Mohr Chavez, Ravines, Roddick, Sabogal, Sillar, and many others. His conclusions underline the frequency of sea­sonal work and itinerancy as a way of life for many pot­ters (or as it used to be). He also discusses the opacifying 
(p. 119) effects of the concept of a vertical archipelago on recognizing the movement of potters and argues for a rehabilitation of plain ware study. The book ends with six appendices (pp. 137-167) with details about the fieldwork of the author, terminology, the reproduction of two ceramic ethnographic accounts (Briining's 1898 and Espejo 's 1951), and one of the interviews conducted by the author. 
In sum, his synthesis is empowering and highlights the many facets of the pottery trade, in which the golon­drinos play more than a marginal role. This book repre­sents a major contribution to the field and a longitudinal focus on ceramic domestic studies, but suffers from ques­tionable strategies in the use of sources.

In La Gente del Agua, Eduardo Williams attempts to shed light on the prehispanic aquatic life way of the Taras­can culture in western Mexico, undertaking an ethnoar­chaeological study to do so. The aquatic lifeway, as termed by Williams, is the culture system that resulted from a long history of human interaction with the aquatic ecological zones of the highlands lake basins in Western Mexico. This culture is the product of significant eco­logical adaptations; it supplemented an agriculturally based diet, facilitated trade, travel and interaction, and eventually was the foundation for the emergence of com­plex societies. Primarily deriving from the Lake Cuitzeo Basin, but also the Lake Chapala and Lake Patzcuaro basins, Williams's research incorporates ethnographic, ethnohistoric, and archaeological methods and datasets in order to investigate and reconstruct the prehispanic aquatic lifeway. This monograph adds to the literature devoted to lacustrine adaptations, such as research from the Basin of Mexico and the Toluca Valley. However, whereas these basins are constrained in their scope due to cultural change already having occurred by the twen­tieth century, the more modem ethnographic study pro­vided by Williams makes this research applicable throughout Highland Mesoamerica. 
Chapter 1 provides an introduction to the methods utilized in the study. Williams discusses the goals of the research, specifically the use of ethnography to gain a holistic understanding of the cultural and ecological adaptations in the study areas over time. This longitudinal study then incorporates these datasets into the creation of bridging arguments, in which archaeological data may be interpreted as representing dynamic human behavior, as it pertains to the aquatic lifeway. Williams then explains the use of ethnohistory as an ancillary attempt at providing correlates between human behavior and the material culture of the archaeological record. The sources of this data derive from several texts, including the Rela­cion de Michoacdn and the Relaciones geogrdficas, to 
name a few. 
In Chapter 2, Williams first starts by explaining the geography of the study areas. This is critical, as these highland lake systems, in the absence of major river net­works in Mesoamerica, form a unique ecological niche from which the adaptation of humans to these areas cre­ates a unique aquatic culture. Williams then outlines the prehispanic chronology, starting in the Early Formative (ca. 1500-500 B.C.), as informed by archaeological research from the study areas. Focusing on the three lake basins mentioned previously, Williams provides the tra­jectory of the evolution of this aquatic lifeway, first as it is seen in the prehispanic archaeological record, and then as it is transformed in the period of Spanish colonialism. 
This discussion of the tongue duree from Chapter 2 sets up Chapter 3, which details the recent historic and modern day ethnographies derived from Williams's detailed recording and analyses. This chapter discusses, first, the aquatic lifeway recorded in the Lake Cuitzeo Basin, and then the Lake Patzcuaro Basin. The discussion for each begins with the geographic setting of the lake basins, and then provides lists of aquatic plant and animal species, displaying the complex biological composition of the lake zones. The ethnographic section is divided into a discussion of three major aquatic activities: fishing, hunting, and gathering. Each activity is discussed in terms of their role in food procurement and craft produc­tion and is accompanied by photographs of the ethno­graphic subjects, activities, and tools. Williams himself points to the true importance of ethnoarchaeological
