P
ublic architectureisoneofthekeyfeatures of early complex societies, as the mas­sivemobilizationofresources requiredfor these projects prevented smaller-scale societies from undertaking them.IntheAmericasand else­where, public architecture took different forms such as mounds, platforms, ditches, palisades, and causeways (Dillehay 1992a; Iriarte 2006; Lesure and Blake 2002;Spencer and Redmond 1998). In this paper we discuss, from an archae­ological and pedological perspective, a mound­and-platform complex discovered on Mocha Island (southernChile) and compareitwith sim­ilarsitesonmainland southernChile (Dillehay 1986, 2007, ed. 2014). Our aim is to shed light onthe convergentanddivergent characteristicsof theindigenous communitiesinthisregionsince ~AD 1000. This paper also endeavors to estab­lishamethodological frameworkforstudyingthe architectural features of public complexes. First we will introduce the geographical and social contextofsouthernChile and Mocha Island.We then describe Dillehay’s groundbreaking work on mound building in the Purén-Lumaco area. Thisis followedbythe resultsof our research,a discussion of these results, and our conclusions.

SouthernChile and Mocha Island: Its 
Territory andPeople 

Geographical Setting 
Mocha Island is located in the South Paci.c Ocean at 38°22’ S, 30 km off the coast of southern Chile(Figure1a).Itis composed of abrupt escarpments that separate elevated Pleistocene marine abrasion platforms from a Holocene marine abrasion terrace (Figure1c). The Holocene marine terrace surrounds the entireisland and consistsofawave-cut platform directly abraded into the bedrock, which cor­responds mainly to theRanquil(Miocene) and Tubul(Pliocene) formations (Tavera andVeyl 1958), bothofmarineorigin(Figure2).Aseries of 18 strandlines formed by sand, gravel, and shell depositshavedevelopedoverthe last 6,000 years due to tectonic uplift, causing a shoreline retreat of ~38m duringthat period(Nelson and Manley 1992).Duetothe steep terrain and dense forestofthe centralridge, currenthumanactivity

and settlements are located on the Holocene terrace, as are all archeological sites found on theisland to date. 
HumanTrajectories 
Despite the fact that southern Chile has one of the longest records of human occupation in the Americas (Monte Verde, ~14500 cal BP [Dillehay 1997;Dillehay et al. 2008]), the .rst periodofoccupationonMocha Islandis datedto abrief span of time as recently as around 3400 cal BP(~1450 cal BC), after which the island appearstoremain unoccupied forthe next 1,500 years(Campbell 2015a;Quirozetal. 2000). 
By ~1850 cal BP(~100 cal AD), the .rst evidenceof ceramics appearsinsouthernChile (Adán et al. 2016;Campbell and Quiroz2015), although the .rst centuries of this phenomenon (~1850–1550 cal BP[~100–400 cal AD]) are still not fully de.ned.Itis followedbythe Early Ceramic Period(1550–950 cal BP [400–1000 cal AD]), during which the Pitrén Complex is thepredominant culture-historical unitfor allof southernChile (Adán and Mera 2011;Aldunate 1989;Mera 2014). In the mainland, a remark­able shift occurs from the small early Pitrén cemeteries(no more than 10 graves)tolarger onesin thelatePitrén(upto50graves), likely

denoting larger, more sedentary, coresidential groups. These later graves, in contrast to the undifferentiated early burials, present varying quantities of ceramic vessels and have even yielded unusual artifacts such as metallic adorn­ments and alpaca(Vicugna pacos)wool textiles. Thisevidence couldindicateanemergentlevel of social differentiation occurring within this society(Adán and Mera 2011;Mera 2014;Mera et al. 2015;Ocampo et al.2003). 
In the case of Mocha Island, ceramics also appear around 1850 cal BP (~100 cal AD), marking the starting point of its second human occupation. Here the Pitrén Complex is repre­sentedbyisolated .ndings andafewarchaeolog­ical stratigraphic components. An effective and permanent colonizationofMocha Island canbe identi.ed datingtoaround 950 calBP(~1000 cal AD; Campbell 2015a), whichlastedintothe ethnohistorical period. 
The Pitrén Complex was followed, in the northernsectionofsouthernChile (Mocha Island included),bytheElVergel Complexwhichisthe prevailing culture-historical unitfor this region duringtheLate Ceramic Period(950–400calBP [1000–1550calAD]).Itis importantto notethat thePitrén-ElVergel transition does not seem to implyapopulationreplacement,but ratherasig­ni.cant change in the material assemblages that characterize each complex –primarily, ceramic decoration and funerary practices (Adán et al. 2005;Aldunate2005;Bahamondes2010;Dille­hay 1990a;Massone2005).Additionally,thereis adiversi.cationofburial patterns(directburial, dugout trunks,stoneslabcists, urns,andmounds; Aldunate 1989; Bullock 1970; Dillehay 1986), thedevelopmentofawidespread metal-working tradition(Campbell 2005;Campbelletal.2015), and the earliest manifestations of public archi­tecture(earthen mounds and platforms; Dillehay 2007). 
In terms of subsistence, there is a clear and greater reliance on cultivated resources such as quinoa(Chenopodium quinoa), maize (Zea mays), beans(Phaseolus vulgaris), squash (Cucurbita sp.), and cheatgrass (Bromus sp.), combined with wild ones such as straw­berry(Fragaria chiloensis), maqui(Aristotelia chilensis), and berries(Rubus sp.),among others (Bonzani 2014; Delgado 2016; Dillehay et al. 
2007;Godoy2016;Iriarte 2014;Massoneetal. 2012;Roa 2016;Roaetal.2015;Sánchezetal. 2004; Silva 2010, 2014). In addition, there is evidence of hunting and .shing practices and likelyraisingof camelids(Lama sp.).Also, the ElVergel Complexresidentialsitesare themost ubiquitous and discernible in all of southern Chile. On Mocha Island, in particular, these domestic areas range from4to15hainsize and present deep (80 to 150 cm) and rich deposits (Campbell 2011, 2015b; Quiroz and Sánchez 2005;Sánchez1997). 
Taken together, all of the above evidence is indicative of a much more sedentary lifestyle, and a very probable increase in population. In sociopolitical terms, the El Vergel Complex seems to correspond to several small political units or polities, whose descriptions plausibly .t somewhere between transegalitarian societies and simple chiefdoms(Bogucki 1999), marking asigni.cant increaseinsocial complexity from its Pitrén predecessor. The slight evidence of wealth differentiation vis-à-vis the ethnohistor­ical record helps propose a phenomenon of social differentiation based more on ideologi­cal aspects, rather than direct economic control (Campbell 2011;Dillehay2007). 
The southern Chile Late Ceramic Period groups faced the arrival of Europeans around AD 1550; the collective but vague name they used to refer to themselves was “reche”: “the authentic people” (Adán 2014; Boccara 2007; Sauer 2015). After50yearsofoccupationofthis area, Europeans were permanently driven out to the northof theBiobio-Lajarivers.Anindepen­dent indigenous country emerged in 1604 and lasted until 1882, when it was conquered by the Chilean state. The society during the ethnohis­torical period, in contrast to theprehistoric one, is marked by livestock raising, raiding, and a trading economy, as well as the consolidation or reinforcementofa chiefdom structurein certain sectorsofsouthernChile (Bengoa 2003;Boccara 2007;Dillehay2007;Zavala 2008).By themid­eighteenth century, a new ethnic identity had emerged from “reche” and was clearly consol­idated as “Mapuche.” Finally, the integration of the Mapuche people into Chile during the late nineteenth century, although resulting in the dissolution of their political autonomy and

most of their social structure, did not lead to the disappearanceof theirtraditions and ideological world. 
In contrasttothemainland, Mocha Islanddur­ing the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries was never occupied by Europeans. Still, its indige­nous population was intermittently visited by Europeanexplorerswhotradedwiththeislanders and/or raided them (Quiroz and Olivares 1997). This situation continued until Spanish authorities forcibly transferredthe island’spopulationtothe mainland in AD 1685–1687, bringing its second human occupation to an abrupt end (Goicovich and Quiroz 2008;Quiroz 1994). After this, Mocha Island remained unoccupied forthe next 160 years.Inthe 1840s,athird human occupation beganbyChileanfarmers(Pizarro 1990)who are theforebearsof mostof the current population. They implemented an economy based on live­stock and low-scale nonmechanized agriculture. 


Moundsin SouthernChile:The Caseof Purén-Lumaco 
In southern Chile, anthropogenic mounds and platforms have been very recently recognized asafeature ofthe Late Ceramic Period(AD 1000–1550) and Reche-Mapuche groups (AD 1550–present). This has mostly been due to the efforts of Dillehay (1986, 1990b, 1992b, 1992c, 1995a, 1995b, 1999, 2002, 2006, 2007, ed. 2014; Dillehay and Saavedra 2003, 2010; Seguel et al. 2005),although previous indications can be found in ethnohistorical sources (Molina 1795:90;Nu´n˜ezdePineda 2001[1673]:498–502) and archaeological works(Gordon et al. 1972– 1973). In addition, there are also small burial tumuli in southernChile (Dillehay 2007:91–92, 2014:16; Latcham 1916:138–140, 1924:524– 525, 1928:207) that shouldbedistinguished from the abovementioned features; these tumuli did not reach the spatial scale or convey the same ritualand political importanceasthemoundsand platformsdidforprehistoric,ethnohistorical, and ethnographicindigenous groups. 
According to Dillehay (2007:37), mounds arepresent in different areas of southernChile. Purén-Lumacohasthelargest numberof mounds at over 300; it is also where they are still used, constructed, and incorporated in Mapuche life. These mounds range between 5 and 50 m in diameter and 1 and 18 m in height, and most are clustered in 9-to 12-mound complexes or rehuekuel (Dillehay 2007:17, 94, 279–281). Purén-Lumaco has an area of about 250 km2, and based on Dillehay’scalculations (2007:305– 306, 311),itcould holdapopulationof10,000to 30,000 in thelateprehistoric period(AD 1000– 1550) and into AD 1800. 
Dillehay’s ethnographic research has recov­ered a variety of concepts related to the mounds (2007:16–22, 159). First, the name for mound in the Mapudungun language is kuel, which means “a sociallybuilt mound where ancestral spirits reside, important people are occasionally buried, and public rituals are performed,” while ñichi is “the culturallyleveledsurface,or hilltop platform, on which mounds are erected.” An associated term is rehuekuel, which refers to “sacred knolls and hilltops that are arti.cially leveled, where one or several kuel are located and where large scale nguillatun (fertility) and other public ceremonies are sponsored by mul­tiple patrilineages.” These rehuekuel then are “associated with old nguillatun and palín (ball­game) .elds and sacred altars(llangi-llangi).” Finally, reñinmapu are “the arti.cially prepared soil layersthatmakeupthemounds,”and kueltun refers to “the ritual act of capping the kuel with individual soil layers that are offerings to the ancestors and deities.” 
Dillehay proposes that mound building in Purén-Lumaco and elsewhereinsouthernChile “was relatedto populationgrowth, social emula­tion, competitivefeasting, and differentialpower relations between lineagesin highlyfertile,cir­cumscribedvalleys”(Dillehay 2007:34).Inturn, “the absenceof archaeological kuel in some areas suggests that local societies never activated a necessaryandsuf.cientlevelofsocial strati.ca­tionand complexitytodevelopmoundbuilding” (Dillehay2007:312).Forthesamereason, “those populations in the region not having built and worshipped mounds, generally did and do not exhibitthe same kindsof socialorganizationand military success[than mound-building popula­tions]” (Dillehay 2007:22). 
Theareas wheremounds arebuilt correspond to “spurs, crests, or promontories, usually at their highest point or at a unique angle that

visually sets them apart and visibly contrasts them on the horizon in multiple directions (…). Mounds also are cleared of vegetation so they can be seen from various angles and distances.” (Dillehay 2007:322).Also, informants(Dillehay 2007:267) indicatethat thesoilusedforamound is carriedfromdifferent areasinthevalley,which is re.ected in thedifferent colors observablein themound’sstratigraphy, and representsthe par­ticipationofdifferent lineagesinits construction. 
According to Dillehay, mounds and mound-building activitiesare intimatelyintegratedwith ritual and political aspectsofthe prehistoric and historical indigenous communities in southern Chile,virtually becomingtheirideological axis. As such, thefunctions of mounds were diverse (Dillehay 2007:224).Oneof thesewas “toserve asburial plotsfor important leaders,” although not all mounds ful.lled this role (Dillehay 2007:298). Also, Mapuche communities today hold nguillatun ceremonies at some rehuekuel. In these .elds, “participants cook, eat, and reside forseveral days”(Dillehay 2007:61).The .eld is “a semicircle or rectangular U-form with the opening to the east” and it is “sacred, never plowed,andalways locatedina.at area adjacent to oroverlookinga bodyofwater(creek,river, or lagoon)”(Dillehay 2007:183–184). 


TheMocha Island Mounds and Platform 
Our research case study is focused on a recently discovered mound-and-platform complex on Mocha Island (Campbell 2011).Giventhe small scaleofthisisland(50km2)anditsnative popu­lation(estimated at about 1,500; Supplemental Text 4), as well as its marginal geographical position within southern Chile, it serves as an excellent casestudy to contrast and complement theviews already advancedby Dillehay(2007, ed. 2014)in relation to the historical,sociopo­litical, and technical processes behind mound­buildinginsouthernChile and elsewhere. 
This architectural complex (rehuekuel in Mapuche terminology) is located on the north­eastern part of Mocha Island on a Holocene marine terrace(Figure1d).Itisina.at areaat43 msl and about 650m fromthe current shoreline, onalevel thatisabovethehigheststrandlineof theHolocene terrace (Nelson and Manley 1992). 
This area is bracketed by an arm of the central range to the north and an ancient landslide to the south, while to the east it is open, facing the ocean and, across that, the mainland. This positioning createsquitean amphitheatricsetting forthe complex itself(Figure3 and Supplemen­tal Figures 1 and 2). The area is covered with grass and is used for animal husbandry rather than agriculture, which has helped preserve the entire complex and protect its soil integrity. 
The complex consistsofaplatformorexten­sive leveledsurface(ñichi in Mapuche terminol­ogy), which has an elliptical shape and covers ~9.2 ha. Above this there are two side-by-side mounds, or kuel. Although there is no clear­cut distinction between the platform and the mound bases, because they constitute a single anthropogenic continuity, the mounds rise from the present surrounding ground level by about 
2.8 m for the North Mound and 3.1 m for the SouthMound. 
Materials and Methods 
Themounds-and-platform complexwasinvesti­gated using two complementary strategies. The .rst was a trench oriented from the top of the North Mound into the space between the two mounds.Thegoalofthetrenchwasto accessthe mound’s stratigraphy and to reach the original paleosol.The second strategyinvolvedasetof 49 auger cores distributedalloverthe platform, as well as beyond it(Figure4a).The goalwas to estimate the extension and depth of the plat­form and its stratigraphy at different points, in orderto better understandthe constructionefforts entailed. 
Atopographicsurveywas undertakenusinga differentialGPS andatotal stationover45 ha, centered at the mounds. Auger core data were used to create topographic maps of the current surface and the paleosurface before mounds­and-platform construction(Figure4b and 4c). Auger cores that reached a point beyond the platform without paleosol are located on the north-south and east-west axes.The paleosurface grid was created by subtracting the depth of paleosol surface from the current surface altitude (Supplemental Figure3).

used to build the complex, we performed a general survey of the soils on the eastern part of theisland,in additiontostudying thetrench andtwosoilpro.les locatedat opposite endsof the mound trench(Figure5 and Supplemental Figure4). Thepro.lesin thetrench are named mound toppro.le(MP) and mound basepro.le (MB).In our soil survey,we observedthat there were generally two types of soil that could be differentiatedbytheir parent material:thosethat

These twotypesof soil areverydifferentin color and texture and arethereforevery easytodistinguish from each other. We thoroughly described a pro.leforeachofthesesoiltypes nearthearchi­tectural complex,one located at the ancient land­slide(LP pro.le), corresponding to theTertiary parent material, and one located toward the north atthesamelevelasthe complex(CQpro.le),that developed over the Quaternary calcareous sand (Supplemental Figure 5). Soils that developed in theTertiary parent material tend to be loamy textured(LPpro.le),while soilsdevelopedinthe Quaternary parent material have sandy loam or loamysand soil textures (CQpro.le).For each soil horizon, color (MunsellColor chart),texture, and friability were analyzed, while additional samples were taken for micromorphological analysis. Our micromorphological descriptions were based on the terminology proposed by Bullock and colleagues(1985). Soiltexturewas examined for paleosol under the mound at the MP and for the CQ pro.le. Bulk density was measured usingthe clod method.

Charcoal samples for 14C dating were col­lected from the Ab paleosol at the MP and MB pro.les. The dates were calibrated using the software Calib 7.0 (Stuiver et al. 2005) and the calibration curve SHCal13(Hogg et al. 2013). Samples for carpological analysis were taken fromthe paleosol materialof theMP. Soil material wasprocessed with a machine-assisted .otationsystem. Recovered culturalarchaeolog­ical remains were also analyzed. 
Results 
TheMocha Island architectural complexis struc­turedaroundtwomounds locatedatopaplatform that covers an area of about 400 by 300 m, and that hasathicknessof ~2.4m below wherethe mounds arelocated (i.e.,excluding thethickness of the mounds themselves). The .ll materials in the mounds and platform consist of soil from unconsolidated parent material related to sedimentary deposits of fossiliferous clay with mollusk molds and sandstone, which correspond to theTubul and Ranquilformations.Thismate­rial is different from the underlying material (paleosol), whichis composedof sands,gravels, and shell fragment deposits of Quaternary age. As a result, it is easy to separate these two materialsinthe stratigraphic column.Giventhe recordofthe island’srapid upliftinthe last 6,000 years(Nelson and Manley 1992), it is possible to estimate that at the moment of the mound’s construction, the seashore was less than 200 m away. 
Macromorphological Soil Features. For the mound, twopro.les were described at each end of thetrench (SupplementalText1and 2).One (MP)extendedfromthetopofthe mound summit down to a depth of514 cm, and the other pro.le (MB)extended from themound basedowntoa depth of97 cm. 
The MP consisted of two main sections (Figure5 and Supplemental Figure 4): from 0 to 474 cm, corresponding to anthropogenic depositedsoilmaterial, and from 474 to 524 cm, corresponding to paleosolburied afterthe con­structionofthe complex.The .rst sectionofMP comprises eight horizons with one discontinuity at a depth of 225 cm, which clearly segregates two construction phases.The underlying paleo­sol comprises .ve horizons. 
TheMBhas three horizons,coveringaburied sequence of .ve horizons (Figure5 and Sup­plemental Figure 4); at a depth of 45 cm, the Ab1 horizonwasfoundto contain charcoal.The last sequence corresponds to soil development over the mound and platform .lling material, whereas the upper A horizons correspond to eroded material,mostlyfromthemound,thatwas depositedoverthe original sequence. 
Thediscontinuity insidetheMPconsistsofan abrupt boundaryseparatingtwolayersthat differ in color, the amount of coarse fragments they contain, and their consistencies.Both construc­tion phases used similarmaterials,removedfrom Ranquil andTubulformation deposits,which are at different stages of weathering and consistency (Supplemental Figure6 and SupplementalText 3).The clay and sand fragmentsof sedimentary origin are clearly separated from the weath­ered soil .ll material. These materials suffered pedogenic processes indicated by the presence of color and structure development, as well as clay illuviation features and a dark-colored upper horizon, which re.ects the accumulation of organicmatter. This pedogenicdevelopment of the pro.le could be clearly seen at a depth of at least 437 cm. The degree of material mixing, featuresof pedogenicdevelopment prior to the material’s transfer, and the similarity to thepro.le described at the nearby landslide(LP [Figures1cand5and SupplementalFigure2])all indicate that a material of similar origin to that observedatLPwasusedto constructthemound. 
The differences between the upper .lling material and the underlying paleosol are clear (Figure6).

The contact between the two materials appears as a smooth, continuous gray layer with ash and a high amount of charcoal. The parent material of the paleosol corresponds to sand composed of seashell fragments of Holocene age (Nelson and Manley 1992).

well-developed Ap and A2 horizons, with pedogenic development down to at least 37 cm (Supplemental Figures 4 and 5). This pro.le corresponds toasoilwithasimilarinitial exposure age as the paleosol,but with continuous exposure(Figure4 and Supplemental Figure3). Theburied paleosol at theMPhas anAhorizon that is 11 cm thick, revealing that the surface over which the mound was built corresponded to a young and poor soil. 
Platform and Mounds Dimensions. Two topographic surfaces were generated. The .rst surface(Figure4b) corresponds to the paleosur­face thatexisted beforethe mounds and platform were constructed. Its stratigraphic ceiling was the contact between the .ll of theplatform and mounds complex andaburiedAhorizon (equiv­alent to horizon 3Abin Figures5 and6).Forthe auger cores where no paleosol was found, and forthose pointsbeyondthe auger coresurvey,the paleosurfacewasassumedtobeequivalentto the present surface. Thesecond surface(Figure4c) corresponds to the current surface. 
The calculated areaofthecomplexis between

Thedifference between thesevalues results from calculating the area of the platform surveyed with the auger cores (5.5 ha) and the value obtained afterinterpolatingall pointsbeyond that survey (12.8 ha; Figure4). Usingthesevalues, an average volume of 42,996 ± 2,900 m3 was obtained for the material used to construct the platform and mounds.For simplicity’s sake,we will taketheaverages as themostsuitablevalues. Thebulk density of theplatform and mound .ll is an average 1.35 mg/m3, which corresponds to 58,045 tons of .lling material.

transition. Nonetheless, the existence of at least twodiscernible constructioneventsatthe North Mound suggests that much of its construction can be attributed to theLateCeramic ElVergel Complex period. 
Thelater date likely corresponds to the 1840s Mocha Island recolonization. This occupation included clearing the forest with .re to open up areas for agriculture (Cañas Pinochet 1902). In this case, the sediments that eroded from the mound helped to preservethis thin charcoal layer, and this allows us to assume that a thicker A horizoncoveredthemounduntilit erodedduring recolonization. 
Archaeological Remains. Excavation of the mound trench and the auger cores revealed that the.llingmaterialusedtobuild boththe mound and theplatformwas completelydevoidof any cultural material. Instead, the only archaeolog­ical remains wererecoveredfromthe paleosol, and more speci.cally from the Ab horizon (Figure7). 
At the mound trench, the paleosol provided nine undecorated nondiagnostic ceramic sherds, seven bone fragments (two of Spheniscus sp. and.veindeterminate),andtwo lithics(asmall sandstone net-sinker and a schist .ake). Auger cores #12 and #24, directly adjacent to theNorth Mound, yielded a single undecorated ceramic sherd and four indeterminate bone fragments, respectively. Finally,a surveyofthe entirearchi­tectural complex area found two ceramic sherds and six lithics; these were neither chronological nor functionally informative. 
The sediments from the paleosol material of theMPtrench revealed thepresenceofasample of botanical taxa (SupplementalTable2); these remainshavetopredatethe construction of the architectural complex. Both the Chenopodium sp. and Poaceae are part of the Mocha Island archaeobotanical assemblages.The former could be a variety of wild chenopodium or quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa), while the latter proba­bly corresponds to a collected and/or cultivated cheatgrass. 


Discussion 
The constructionofarchitectural complexessuch as the one described hereis one of thefeatures of some late prehistoric and historic indige­nous communities in southern Chile. Dillehay (1986, 2007, 2014)has reported extensively on these complexes, mostly through hisresearch on Purén-Lumaco. Our discussion then, will take a comparative approach, contrasting the Purén-Lumaco sites with the Mocha Island complex described above. 
Dillehay indicates that some of these archi­tectural complexesor rehuekuelconsistofaplat­form or ñichi, and mound(s) on top ofit, called kuel.Thatis the caseonMocha Island as well. However, what is different and surprising is the size andvolumeof theMocha Island complex. Usingthe Purén-Lumaco data(Dillehay 2007; Dillehay and Saavedra 2010, 2014), we have estimated that the mainland platforms measure from0.04ha(Ñachekuel [Dillehay and Saavedra 2010:201])upto3.2ha (Rehueñichikuel [Dille­hay and Saavedra 2010:226]), although most are no more than 0.2 ha. It should, nevertheless, be noted that the Purén-Lumaco area has been subject to forestry, agricultural activities, and public works (e.g., road construction), which have certainly resultedinthe lossof .llmaterial at some of these complexes.

In contrast, the platform at Mocha Island covers~9.2ha.Thisaspectisevenmore striking when one considers that native population esti­matesfor Mocha Island reach onlyup to about 1,500, while population estimates for Purén-Lumaco areinthe rangeof 10,000to 30,000.In termsofper-capita labor,thissingle construction project may have been much more demanding for the people on Mocha Island than at Purén­Lumaco,ifnotforthemanymore rehuekuel that were built at Purén-Lumaco. Therefore, in the long run, the demand on mainland inhabitants might have been much greater than on Mocha Island. 
In fact, in the case of Mocha Island, the nature of the .lling sediments allows them to be more easily and clearly isolated from the paleosol.The parent materialof the paleosolisa Quaternary seashell-rich material, while soils of unconsolidated sedimentsfromthe Ranquil and Tubulformations were used forthe .llmaterial, givingitatexture,color,and consistencythatare distinct fromthe paleosol. 
Another point of comparison is the mounds themselves. On Mocha Island, the .lling sedi­mentwascompletelydevoidofculturalmaterial, andthemostlikelyexplanationfor thisis thatthe sediment came fromthe nearby landslideformed overthe Ranquil andTubulformations,whichis the closest source of material with these charac­teristics. On the other hand, for Purén-Lumaco, Dillehay(2007, ed. 2014)reports thepresence of archaeological features such as different color layers andburningevents, and culturalmaterials such as ceramics andfaunal remains. Also absent on Mocha Island are differentiated “arti.cially prepared soil layers” or reñinmapu like those found at the Purén-Lumaco mounds, added as part of the kueltun rituals. These characteristics imply the following for the latter area: a) the useof sedimentsthat already contained cultural remains from, for example, domestic middens; b) the addition of cultural remains, as well as soil layers, to the .lling sediments as, for instance,offerings;orc)both.Infact,Dillehay and Saavedra(2014)described mounds formed by hundreds of different pockets of poncho-loads—woven blankets used to carry dirt— which correspond to individual loads of soils of different texture and color.Thevarious soils at Purén-Lumaco have been linked with soil series located in different parts of the valley(Seguel

etal. 2005,2014).Thediversityof soilsusedfor mound constructionwas particularly pronounced duringthe prehispanic periodin Purén-Lumaco, while more homogeneous soil materials were used forthe Hispaniclevels(Dillehay and Saave­dra 2014:217–220). The use of diverse soils wasinterpreted as representingthe relationships amongthe lineagesofthemoundbuilders,with different soils sourced from each lineage’shome­land (Dillehay and Saavedra 2014:218). 
In contrast,atMocha Island the homogeneity ofthe.ll materialmadeitextremelydif.cultto isolatedifferent constructionevents.Itwaspossi­bletoidentifyonlyone boundary between stages, which does not presentaburiedAhorizon. The absenceofburied soil inside themound .llmight re.ect a process of rapid construction, perhaps withashortbreak between thetwo construction events.Young soils of known age on theisland show high soil production rates: Bahlburg and Spiske(2012)described5to10 cmthick soils in the shore uplifted after the 1835 earthquake. Because soil production declines exponentially as depth increases (Heimsath et al. 1997), we expect high initialratesof soil formationfor the beginning decades(asshownbythe5to10cm thicksoils after175 years).The absenceofevena verythinsoil insidethemoundallowsustothink in termsof a unique break periodthat might not have exceeded the duration of a century. 
This means that the construction of the mounds was very probably a rapid and contin­uous process. The absence of any datable or chronologically diagnostic material inside the mound .ll prevents us from estimating the precise timing of construction. Nevertheless, the degree of pedogenic development of the soil in the platform and mounds after their construction allows us to interpret a long period of soil formation based on the following facts: thicknessand pedogenicdevelopmentoftheMB soil (52 cm), the amount of eroded material that constitutes the three upper A horizons (55 cm), and the average thickness of 24 cm for theAhorizonof theplatform. Consideringsoil productionvalueson Mocha Island,a24cmthick soil (considering the thickness of the MB’s A horizon) should have been exposed for ~560 years at least. This implies that the mounds and platform had already been therefor at least .ve centuries before the beginning of the cur­rent occupation(AD 1840s), suggestingthat the constructionofthe architectural complex ended aroundAD 1300, withamaximumbuilding time of around 300 years. In that time, the mounds wouldhave been visiblefromthe shoreline. 
As indicated, construction of the complex began around AD 1000. This was a time of signi.cant changein southernChile,asre.ected in the region’s incorporation of new technolo­gies and goods,higher population densities, and almost certainlytheemergenceof morecomplex social organization. Therefore, undertaking a constructionprojectof this scaleisby nomeans unexpected. It is important to indicate that, at that moment,the area selected forthe platform­and-mound complexmust havecontained one of thefew developed soils of theHolocene plains surrounding Mocha Island, sinceitwaslocated on oneofthefew older terracesabovethe38 m strandline(Nelson and Manley 1992). 
Given that an effective and permanent col­onization of Mocha Island can be dated from AD ~1000 onwards, and since the base levels of the eight communities (expansive domestic areas ranging from4to15hathat most closely resemble homesteads) identi.ed in the island (Figure2) date to that moment and/or their middens increasedramatically from that timeon (SupplementalTable1), the commencement of construction on this architectural complex can be interpretedasmarkinga “foundationalevent” forthe Mocha Island community.This datealso coincideswith changesintheisland’svegetation anda declineinforestspecies,recordedin the palynological record of a nearby stratigraphic column(Le-Quesne et al. 1999). This occurred contemporaneously with the presence of char­coal in the record, suggesting forest clearance activitiesthat probablywere undertakentohabil­itate space for camelid(Camelidae sp.) grazing and agricultural activities. In addition, the AD ~1300 date, taken as a milestone for the con­clusion of the complex’s construction, marks a momentin whichtheseeight communitieswere already established, based on the absolute dates obtained forthem. 
These characteristicsare reminiscentof Dille­hay’s ethnographic work in Purén-Lumaco. He indicates that some mound complexes or

rehuekuel served as theplaza whereritual, polit­ical, and/or festive activities were performed. On Mocha Island, the very nature of the .lling sediment used tobuild thearchitectural complex –with its remarkable differentiation from any surrounding materials, in terms of both color andtexture–allowsusto proposethatitwasthe deliberateintentionofthe indigenous inhabitants to set apart this area, creating a unique space that was unequivocally distinguishable by its appearance and where a visible physical bound­arymarkedwhether onewasinsideoroutside this space.Infact,nolessthan 600mseparatethis architectural complex fromthe closest domestic sites(P29-1 and P31-1; Figure1d), and because of its amphitheatre-like location, there is no intervisibility between the complex and these sites.Infact,the soilat site P29-1, whichformed ina parent materialof calcareous sand similarto theCQpro.le,wasnotusedinthe constructionof themounds and platform.These characteristics thus lead us to propose that the complex was a truly public space, not owned by any one particular island community. 
Additionally, fromwithin theplatformareait is possible to distinguish at least two strips of earth.Theseare each about one meterwide and 100to200mlong,extending fromthemoundsto the southern edge (the ancient landslide) of this apparent ceremonial space(Figure8). Initially, we interpretedthesestripsaspossible causeways (Campbell 2011:206–207), but without ruling out that possibility, we are also inclined to think that these may correspond to boundaries of a .eld for the palín game. According to López (2011:147–158), palín .elds are demarcated by diggingaditch and liningthe removeddirtalong the .eld’s edges.The size of palín .elds varies signi.cantly,ranging from50to 500mlong and 5to83mwide. 
The already advanced implications of the Mocha Island complexareevenmoreremarkable if one considers that it is the only such site on the entire island, a point supported by the full coverage survey that we conducted (excluding thesteep centralforest).Therefore, this complex wouldhave been the centralideological hub for the island’s entire indigenous population. This situation is again a clear contrast with Purén­Lumaco,wheremorethan300 moundshavebeen identi.ed.As such,it couldindicatethat Mocha Island did not reach the degree of social com­plexity achieved at Purén-Lumaco, and that the island populationdidnothaveto sustainasimilar level ofconstruction activityoverthe centuries. Still, the Mocha Island architectural complex may denote the occurrence of a much more hierarchical or consolidated political situation compared to Purén-Lumaco, one that prevented the spread of this building practice to other sectorsofthe island. 
It is worth mentioning that Spanish, Dutch, and English ethnohistorical sources (Campbell 2011:298–354) explicitly indicate the existence of individuals of social prestige and political importance on Mocha Island. In addition, one of these explorers(VanNoort 1600 [Ijzerman 1926:54–58; Van Meurs 1993]) arrived at the island when its inhabitants were holdingafes­tival, strikingly analogous to Dillehay’s ethno­graphic reports on ceremonies that occur in thepresent day at the Purén-Lumaco rehuekuel. Still, the contrasting views that emerge from Mocha Island and Purén-Lumaco might also represent different social, political, and ideo­logical approaches to the construction, use, and signi.cance of early public architecture. 
Turningtoadifferent aspectof moundbuild­ing,itisworthmentioning theMapuchemythof thestruggle between thewater and earth snakes, Cai-Cai and Tren-Tren, respectively, in which humankind is saved by escaping to the top of Tren-Tren and then making a human sacri.ce (Foerster1993).Therefore,inaterritoryas prone to earthquakes and tsunamis as southern Chile (Ely et al. 2014;Garretetal. 2015; Huellas Mapuches 2011;Lenz1912),buildinga mound can take on the signi.cance of creating a local protective Tren-Tren,wherethemythisreenacted through successive constructions, rituals, and offerings. In fact, in Purén-Lumaco the largest and most important kuel is TrenTrenkuel(Dille­hay 2007:106). In the case of Mocha Island, it is possible that the .lling material came from the large ancient landslide that demarcates the architecturalcomplextothesouth;that landslide couldevenhavebeenan outcomeofoneofthese catastrophic events.

Island architectural complex (42,996 m3 and 58,045 tons), of the years elapsed between the start and end of its construction (300 years), and of the island’s native population (1,500 people), the next step would be to estimate the labor requirement for a public project such this one. Nevertheless, approximations of this kind are virtually absent in the anthropological literature. 
Oneofthefewsuch attemptswasbyErasmus (1965), using actual ethnographic experiments. Based on his results, with a distance of 200 m between the source material excavation site and the.ll destination,asisthe casewiththe ancient landslide and theMocha Island mounds,a single worker is able to carry 1.1 tons per day. This translatesintoatotalof 52,767worker-daysfor theisland’s complex,implyingthataworkforce of 500 people—one-thirdofthe estimated native populationfor Mocha Island—couldhavebuiltit in106days.Ifweopttouse anotherof Erasmus’ estimations,inwhichhe calculated 5.25worker­days per m3 of .ll, building the Mocha Island complex would then require 225,729 worker-days, translating to 451 days of construction, again with a workforce of 500. 
Giventhat the.rstestimationismuch more optimistic, we prefer the second one. In any case, both show that building the complex was a perfectly feasible endeavor for a small population, and that they would have been able to accomplish it in a rather short time span. Thus we consider this estimationoflabor requirements to be entirely congruent with the gathered geoarchaeological information, which indicates rapid construction. 
Elaborating on estimations by Erasmus (1965), among others, Drennan and colleagues (2010)and Peterson and Drennan(2011)have proposed a “tax rate” index, understood as the per-capitaburden for carrying out publicworks, or as the number of days’ labor per year per availablelaborer thatis requiredfor construction. This kind of index allows for the development ofacomparativeperspectivebeyond the culture-historical peculiarities of each society, helping increase our understanding of the processes of social change worldwide (Smith et al. 2012).

In this fashion, the “tax rate” for the Mocha Island architectural complex can be estimated at 
1.5 days/worker/year.Thisvalue turns outtobe aclose equivalent to the “taxrate” calculated for the construction of an archaeological landmark such as PuebloBonito in Chaco Canyon (Dren­nan et al. 2010:64–70). 


Conclusions 
The research conducted shows that mounds and platforms and the practices related to their construction and usage are a key aspect to understanding the late prehistoric and histori­cal indigenous societies of southern Chile, the southernmost population in the Americas that engaged in the construction of these public spaces.Beyond thisoverarching statement there emergesapictureof remarkablelocal peculiari­ties. On one hand, not all communities engaged in the construction of public architecture, and thosewhobuiltsuch structuresdidnotdosoin a homogeneousfashion. While thelandscape at Purén-Lumacois dottedwith mounds,onMocha Island there are just two mounds in a very cir­cumscribed setting; at theformerthe mound .ll contains artifacts, features, and a variety of soil types,andatthelattertheseare almost absent. 
Both situations mustbe linkedtothe sociopo­litical changes that populationsin southernChile experienced starting in AD ~1000, marked by the emergence and development of much more complex societies, encompassed under thelabel of El Vergel Complex. In this context, it is worth noting that in spite of Mocha Island’s geographicalmarginality,itslowpopulationden­sity in comparison to Purén-Lumaco, and the abrupt and drastic termination ofits occupation in AD 1687, its indigenous inhabitants were not disconnected from the contemporary regional processes occurring on the mainland. Therefore, geographical position need not be equated with sociopolitical preeminence or backwater status. 
It remains to be seen whether the mech­anisms outlined in Purén-Lumaco (population growth, social emulation, competitive feasting, differential power relations between lineages, circumscription) as leading to mound building were the same ones operating across all of southernChile.Inaddition,itis fundamental that we further examine the sociopolitical processes occurringinthoseareas wherethesearchitectural complexesdid not manifest.Inotherwords, we must assess to whatextent theseprocesses and their materials correlate to and can be explained by circumscribed and localfactorsorbybroader and regionalfactors, or both, andhowthis can illuminate our understandingof culturaldiversity at large. Finally, our research also highlights theimportanceof integratingdifferent scienti.c approaches (archaeology and pedology) to pro­duce a richer and more complete knowledge of past social dynamics.
