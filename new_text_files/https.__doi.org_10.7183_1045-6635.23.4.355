
REGROUP ON "E-GROUPS": MONUMENTALIT Y AND EARLY 
CENTERS IN THE MIDDLE PRECLASSIC MAYA LOWLANDS 

James A. Doyle 
For nearly a century, scholars have used astronomical evidence to explain the Lowland Maya architectural type known as 
"£-Groups" as solar observatories and, by extension, as locations for rituals related to solar and agricultural cycles. This article departs from the usual focus on the observational properties of £-Groups and places them in the context of early Maya monumentality during the Middle Preclassic period. Specifically, £-Groups are seen as the earliest monumental social spaces in the Maya Lowlands, with multifaceted functions and placements that indicate a shared social map of the land­scape. Geographic information systems viewshed analysis of Middle Preclassic £-Group sites demonstrates that popula­tions constructed £-Groups in places that maximized visibility of the nearby landscape. Viewsheds conducted at sites with Middle Preclassic £-Groups in the central Maya Lowlands suggest that the large plazas and similar monumental archi­tecture represent the centers of comparable, mutually visible communities. Settlers founding these communities consciously created distance from neighboring monumental centers, perhaps as means of defining and buttressing group identity and undergirding spatial claims to political authority. Recent archaeological evidence affords clues that such spaces were civic, allowing architectural settings for social gatherings and access to resources. 
Por casi cien ailos, diversos estudios se han basado en evidencia arqueoastron6mica para tratar los complejos arquitect6ni­cos del "Grupo Tipo E, " propio de las Tierras Bajas Mayas, coma observatorios so/ares y, por consiguiente, como centros rituales relacionados con las ciclos so/ares y agrfcolas. El presente art{culo parte de las caracter{sticas observacionales de los Grupos Tipo E y los ubica en un contexto de desarrollo temprano de la monumentalidad en el mundo maya, durante el perfodo Precldsico Medio . Espec(ficamente, el art{culo ubica a Los Grupos Tipo E como los primeros espacios sociales-mon­umentales confunciones polifadticas en las Tierras Bajas Mayas. Esto lo realiza tras presentar la localizaci6n de las grupos como evidencia de un mapa social del paisaje compartido entre Los colonos mayas tempranos. El autor usa sistemas de infor­maci6n geogrdfica de sitios con Grupos Tipo E def Precldsico Medio para demostrar que las poblaciones construyeron las Grupos Tipo E en lugares que maximizaron la visibilidad sabre los terrenos aledanos. El andlisis del campo visual /levado a cabo en sitios con Grupos Tipo E def Precldsico Media en las Tierras Bajas Mayas centrales sugiere que las plazas monu­mentales con la arquitectura similar representan los centros de communidades comparables. Los fundadores de estas comu­nidades habrfan creado conscientemente distancia de las centros monumentales vecinos, quizds con el fin de definir o reforzar una identidad grupal o de sustentar autoridad polftica sabre reclamos territoriales. El art{culo presenta evidencia arque­ol6gica reciente sabre el uso civico de dichos espacios monumentales tempranos, espacios que provefan de un marco arqui­tect6nico para concurrencias sociales ya la vezfacilitaban el acceso a distintos recursos. 
iscussions of ancient Maya political Dauthority have largely focused on Classic period (ca.A.D. 250-900) royal courts and the extent of their control over the landscape by means of alliances, diplomacy, and warfare (see Garrison and Dunning 2009; Lucero 1999; Martin and Grube 2008). Yet it is important to emphasize that some of the greatest Classic Maya cities owe their eventual geographic locations to decisions made by settlers as early as the Middle Preclassic period (ca. 1000-300 B.C.). Recent finds have 
emerged from the Preclassic period that indicate a high degree of sociopolitical complexity, along with expressive resources that include mural paint­ing and hieroglyphic writing (Estrada-Belli 2006, 2011; Hurst 2009; Satumo et al. 2005; Taube et al. 2010), elaborate architectural sculpture (Estrada­Belli 2011; Hansen 1998; Laporte and Fialko 1995), and dedicatory caches of greenstone axes (Estrada-Belli 2006, 2011; Inomata et al. 2009). Despite renewed archaeological attention to Pre­classic contexts, however, the nature of Preclassic

Maya political authority and the emergence of mon­umental centers remains opaque. 
During the Middle Preclassic, the Maya built the first monumental architecture, which implies large­scale mobilization oflabor. The current article con­siders this period of incipient monumentality as a foundation for concepts of landscape and author­ity broadly shared and linked to later, known Maya groups. Specifically, the article traces significant shifts in Maya monumentality throughout the Mid­dle Preclassic period that culminated in the con­struction of wide plazas and pyramidal platforms that characterize posterior Lowland Maya settle­ments. A geographic information systems (GIS) examination of a hallmark architectural type, the so-called E-Groups, shows that a regular distribu­tion of settlements, and thus a shared spatial con­sideration of the landscape, may have existed as early as 500 B.C. In such settlements, monumen­tal plaza groups with similar architectural plans formed the civic centers of comparable communi­ties. The discussion explores archaeological data to account for such a social map of the landscape, in relation to the development of political author­ity in the Middle Preclassic Lowlands. 
Building Big 
Archaeologists have long recognized the correla­tion of early complex societies and large settle­ments with monumental architecture (e.g., Childe 1950:12). Monumental architecture, a cross-cul­tural phenomenon, consists of facilities built with scale and architectural elaboration that "exceed the requirements of any practical functions that a build­ing is intended to perform" (Trigger 1990: 119). Still, the nature of the relationship among the ancient landscape, aggregations of populations, and monumental architecture remains unclear (see Joyce 2004; McAnany 2010: 141-157). Materials that archaeologists interpret as monumental are typically located in culturally important places and constructed with significant human energy, by either a practiced specialist or a large amount of people (Trigger 1990:121; Willey 1962:1-2). But why did people settle densely and undertake mas­sive building projects in certain places, and at cer­tain points in history, but not in others? What makes architecture "monumental" is hard to pinpoint, but "the immense scale of these constructions bespeaks a desire to transform the landscape, to engineer a cultural topography that radically altered living space" (McAnany 2010: 145). Thus monumental­ity, or the social impulse to build big things, is defined both by the intent and by the perception of elevated scale and durability. 
Early Maya Monumentality, ca. 1000-700 B.C. 
Maya Lowland communities did not construct monumental structures as defined above until after 700 B.C. (Awe et al. 1990; Garber et al. 2004; Ham­mond 1991; Joyce 2004; Lohse 2010; McAnany and Lopez Varela I 999; Potter et al . I 984). Before this time, there is little evidence of archaic, prece­ramic populations in the Lowlands (see Iceland 2005; Lohse 20 10). Current palynological data show that maize cultivation (and possibly associ­ated forest clearing) may have occurred between 5100 and 4600 cal B .P. (Pohl et al. I 996; Wahl 2005; Wahl et al. 2006, 2007). Maize pollen intru­sion and disturbance taxa indicating forest clear­ance do not appear widely in the geological record until after 1500-1000 B.C. and sharply increase after 400 B.C. (Dunning et al. 2002; Estrada-Belli and Wahl 2010). The early settlers' use of perish­able construction material would explain the intru­sion of maize pollen and the lack of clear archaeological evidence of agriculturalists. The strongest evidence of preceramic occupations comes from northern Belize, namely, near Colha (Iceland 2005; Lohse et al. 2006; Rosenswig and Masson 2001). The data show that there was a sub­stantial population engaged in lithic production and intensive agriculture, with evidence of occupational continuity into the Middle Preclassic (Iceland 2005:16). 
Although the timing is unclear and variable between regions, the first evidence of sedentary vil­lages in the Maya Lowlands with concomitant ceramics comes from the time between I 000 and 700 B.C. (Cheetham 2005; Clark and Cheetham 2003; Forsyth ! 999). Settlement pattern studies have concluded that people at this time lived in small house clusters, often close to permanent water sources, and did not engage in major landscape modification for construction purposes (Fialko 2000; Puleston 1973:311; Rice 1976:435; Ringle 1999:189; Rosenswig and Masson 2001). Early Middle Preclassic villagers also engaged in shared ritual practice and craft specialization , perhaps

reflecting social inequality through the presence of imported items, such as jade, shells, or obsidian (Hammond 1991; Hansen 1998, 2000; Hendon 1999; McAnany and Lopez Varela 1999: 155). The introduction of ceramic production and long-dis­tance trade items signals that the Early Middle Pre­classic settlers began to invest more heavily in places on the landscape. Perhaps several kin groups cooperated as communities, centered on a specific geographic area. Presumably, the communities began cooperating with neighbors through trade networks to obtain long-distance commodities. Such cooperation could be the mechanism to explain shared customs and architectural conven­tions visible in the archaeological record. Most sig­nificantly, the material changes that occur in personal items seem to correspond to a major shift in residential constructions by 700 B.C., "most notabl[y] the partial replacement of small perish­able structures by permanent raised masonry or earthen house platforms" (Ringle 1999: 190). 
Although few settlements from this time have been extensively excavated, the earliest detectable buildings in the Maya Lowlands were built on the ground surface with a perishable superstructure (Gerhardt and Hammond 1991 :99). Subsequent buildings took the form of apsidal, keyhole-shaped, or circular low platforms with or without super­structures (Aimers et al. 2000; Awe et al. 1990; Ger­hardt 1988; Hammond 1991; Hansen 1998; Inomata et al. 2009; Ricketson and Ricketson 
1937). As Gerhardt and Hammond (1991: 101-102) describe at Cuello, the low platforms included a low retaining wall of limestone cobble and a core of small stones, sealed with a layer oflimestone plas­ter. The introduction of stone-lined platforms and plaster floors is the earliest evidence of an emerg­ing Maya Lowland monumentality. 
Buildings of this type exist at several sites in northern Belize (Garber et al. 2004; McAnany and Lopez Varela 1999; Potter et al. 1984). The residents periodically renewed the platforms by covering them with new layers of plaster and building new superstructures. This activity often included the bur­ial of deceased family members below the floor. Over time, both the platforms and the outdoor patios were repaved with plaster, thus sealing the previ­ous occupation levels and raising the relative ele­vation of the building area. In subsequent phases, people invested more labor including steps, mold­ings, and interior thresholds, which eventually led to solid retaining walls (Gerhardt and Hammond 1991:102). This shift to elaborate entrances and durable stone walls of residential platforms signals the gradual development of Middle Preclassic Low­land monumental architecture in the context ofliv­ing space. The monumentality ofliving space, rather than large ceremonial earthen platforms (see Joyce 2004: 10), signifies intent to construct larger, more permanent structures, although the perceived manipulation of scale would have only affected immediate inhabitants or visitors. 
The Rise of Cardinal Rectangularity, ca. 
700-500 B.C. 
As settlements grew, populations constructed large plazas and monumental buildings over the circu­lar or apsidal platforms, especially noted at Uax­actun, Guatemala, and Cahal Pech, Belize. Aimers et al. (2000) provide a synthesis of work on round structures from the Middle Preclassic at Cahal Pech, which often show signs of dismantling and superimposition of rectilinear structures in later time periods. The authors argue that round struc­tures were important platforms for performance and ancestor veneration and touch upon the impli­cations of the architectural transition from round to rectangular building forms, which at Cuello also included the first superstructures with limestone 
walls (Aimers et al. 2000:80-81; Gerhardt and Hammond 1991: 104; Hendon 2000) .At some point thereafter during the Middle Preclassic, round structures were rendered "obsolete" (Aimers et al. 2000:83).Aimers et al. argue (2000:81) that it "does not appear to be the transformation of the formal qualities of a dwelling, but the complete abandon­ment of one building type (the exposed circular platforms) and its replacement with another (the rectilinear building with superstructure)." The appearance of rectangular platforms and pyrami­dal structures perhaps reflects social changes as a result of population growth at a local level. Kent Flannery (1972:39--40, 2002:431) has argued that rectangular houses allow space for entire nuclear families and the easy addition or subtraction of rooms, perhaps related to changes in residential strategies that cut across kinship ties in early Mesoamerica. 
The earliest monumental plazas and buildings in the Middle Preclassic that mimicked the forms

of earlier domestic architecture signal a second dis­tinct shift in the social importance of monumen­tality in the built environment. Lowland Maya architecture developed as a discrete style with strong evidence of planning related to the cardinal directions, with similar building groups and con­struction techniques (Hansen 1998). The direc­tionality of architecture, and possible general patterns of Maya cosmology, is also reflected in dedicatory offerings at Ceibal and Cival (Bauer 2005; Estrada-Belli2006,2011; Willey 1978). The point to emphasize here is that after about 700 B .C., buildings and preexisting social spaces became truly monumental in intent and perception in the Lowlands for the first time. Large plazas and plat­forms , requiring a sizable labor force to construct, signal to archaeologists that populations in the Lowlands aggregated or cooperated at this time. Recent evidence from the central Lowlands shows that Middle Preclassic population nucleation and monumental building very often included the con­struction of a distinct architectural pattern, labeled and now reified as the E-Group type. The follow­ing discussion explores the sociopolitical implica­tions of the distribution of the E-Group pattern, itself an expression of Lowland Maya monumen­tality that transcended residential buildings. 
To "E" or Not to "E" 
"E-Groups" are named after Group Eat Uaxactun, excavated by the Carnegie Institution of Washing­ton in the early twentieth century (Blom 1924; Chase and Chase 1995; Ricketson 1928; Ricket­son and Ricketson 1937; Ruppert 1940). These groups most often contain the earliest cultural mate­rial at their respective sites (Clark and Hansen 200 l ; Fialko 1988; Hansen 1992; Laporte and Fialko 1995; Laporte and Valdes 1993). Various E-Groups exhibit similar features and orientation, all arranged around a rectangular plaza that served as a defined level space. The primary buildings include a large square-based pyramid on the western side of the plaza, usually "radial," or with staircases on each face (see Coggins 1980; Cohodas 1980). East of the pyramid lies a long, narrow platform with the longer axis running north to south, sometimes con­taining three structures. These three structures, usu­ally dating to the Classic period, generally lined up with the locations of the sunrise on the solstices and equinoxes when viewed from the western pyra­mid. Thus, scholars consider that the original con­figuration of E-Groups facilitated observation of solar movement, albeit with some reservation& about their accuracy as actual observatories (Aven i and Hartung 1989; Aveni et al. 2003). The precise social function or meaning of E-Groups eludes archaeologists, although most concur that they are not residential spaces. The main argument about the meaning of E-Groups is that they were used for rituals commemorating agricultural cycles (Aimers 
' 
1993:46; Aimers and Rice 2006; Aveni and Har­tung 1989; Aveni et al. 2003; Aylesworth 2004: Chase and Chase 1995; Stanton and Freidel 2003). 
Origins 
The origins of E-Groups are poorly understood. Some scholars propose E-Groups as part of a larger construction pattern , dubbed the "Middle Formative Chiapas" (MFC) pattern, with archi­tectural groups on a north-south axis found at many different sites (Clark and Hansen 200 1 :4). The MFC pattern also contains residential plat­forms or "compounds" of approximately 80 x 80 m (Clark and Hansen 2001:2; Hendon 1999). 
Some have also posited that the earliest MFC groups exist in the Grijalva Basin of Chiapas or may be similar to a group at the Olmec site of La Venta, Tabasco, Mexico (Clark and Hansen 200 I: 
Lowe l 989:61,Figure4.la). Unfortunately, a lack of precise comparative chronology between the Maya Lowlands and western Mesoamerica impedes an understanding of where and when E­Groups first appeared. The available data from the Maya Lowlands show consistency in construction techniques and dimensions of buildings that dif­fers greatly from similar groups, such as at Chi­apa de Corzo and Mirador, Chiapas (cf. Clark and Hansen 200l :Figures 1.3-1.4). The hypothetical existence of a distinct regional pattern in the cen­tral Maya Lowlands suggests an independent, par­allel development from similar groups in Chiapas and Tabasco , although more data are needed (Hansen 2000:56). Regardless of origin, the fre­quency and distribution of E-Groups at major Lowland population centers during the Preclas­sic imply that the structures and wide plaza formed an integral part of community life (Aimers and Rice 2006:82; Chase and Chase 1995: 100; Clark and Hansen 200 1).

Categorization 
Whereas E-Groups in the past have been treated as a unitary phenomenon, new data necessitate a clear definition of the formal and chronological criteria used here. First, architectural form and scale are of the utmost importance when defining the heuristic category of E-Groups. In the present work, E­Groups have wide rectangular plazas of approxi­mately 50 x 100 m, as bounded by a large western pyramid of approximately 30-60 mat the base and a long eastern platform ranging from approximately 50 to 100 m north-south (Laporte 2001). The cur­rent sample consists of E-Group sites that exhibit similar architectural forms, most importantly the defined level plaza space. Most of the E-Groups that fit these criteria are located in the central Maya Lowlands, ranging from southern Campeche east­ward to the Holmul River Valley and south to the Peten lakes region, as noted by Ruppert ( 1940:224) and others. 
One major obstacle to the application of the E­Group category is that the visible dimensions gen­erally reflect the Late Preclassic configurations of such groups. Chronological history is crucial, as the architectural groups did not develop overnight; nor did they remain fixed in form for centuries. How­ever, as demonstrated through stratigraphic exca­vation, many E-Groups are clearly built upon smaller forms in the same arrangement erected dur­ing the Middle Preclassic (e.g., Doyle et al. 2011; Estrada-Belli 2011; Laporte and Fialko 1995 ; Laporte and Valdes 1993). The limited evidence of Middle Preclassic E-Group architecture shows con­struction on natural bedrock, or masonry and plas­ter platforms, perhaps with superstructures (Doyle eta!. 2011; Estrada-Belli 2006:58, 2011:77; Hansen 
1998; Laporte and Fialko 1995). 
Another challenge with previous E-Group research is a tendency to view the type synchron­icall y over too long a time range. As Laporte (1993:303) and Fialko (1988; Laporte and Fialko 1995) have noted, there is a clear disconnection in the meanings and function of E-Groups between the Preclassic and Classic periods. Although some have argued that the "construction of E-groups in general appears to have spanned most of Preclas­sic and Classic Maya history" (Aimers and Rice 2006:80), the dearth of accurate and contempora­neous site plans impedes a conclusive understand­ing of E-Group chronology in many sites. 
Subtypologies of E-Groups based on Late Pre­classic arrangements (see Chase and Chase 1995), andpossible variant E-Group examples in the Clas­sic period (e.g., Guderjan 2006), are also not included in the current analysis. 
The comparative data utilized here come from three groups of sites: (1) those with certain Middle Preclassic E-Groups, (2) sites with unexcavated E­Groups but nearby evidence of Middle Preclassic occupation, and (3) unexcavated sites with E­Groups that fit the formal criteria (Figure 1). Exam­ples with stratigraphic evidence of Middle Preclassic E-Group construction include Cival (Estrada-Belli 20 11),El Palmar (Doyle et al. 20 11), NakM (Hansen 1992, 1998), Naranjo (Fialko 2004: 180; Gamez 2005:229; Quintana 2008; Quin­tana and Wurster 2004), San Bartolo (Urquizu and Saturno 2008), Tikal (Laporte and Fialko 1995), and Uaxactun (Laporte and Valdes 1993; Ricket­son and Ricketson 1937). Examples of E-Groups as defined above that have not been fully excavated but exist at sites with firm archaeological evidence for Middle Preclassic occupation are Calakmul (Carrasco Vargas 1999, 2003; Delvendahl 2008; Dominguez Carrasco 1994:30 1), Cenote (although as Chase [1983:149] notes, the E-Group may have Middle Preclassic construction), El Mirador (Forsyth 200 6:499-500; Hansen 1990, 1998), 
v
Mucaancah (Sprajc 2012), Nakum (Quintana and Wurster 2002; Zralka 2008:31), Wakna (Hansen 1994:19, 1998), Yaxha (Quintana 2008; Quintana et al. 2000:279), and Yaxnohcah (Sprajc 2012). Finally, many sites exhibit E-Groups with the for­mal criteria but have yet to be excavated thoroughly, such as Balakbal (Ruppert and Denison 1943· Sprajc 2012), El Cedro (Mejia 2009), El Pesquer (Mejia 2009), Las Torres (Mejia 2009), Naachtun (Ruppert and Denison 1943), Uxul (Paap et al. 2010; Ruppert and Denison 1943), and Xulnal (Mejia 2008: 654, Figure 12). The current E-Group model, then, is based on sites with similar archi­tectural patterns, divided into three groups by build­ing chronology ranging from Middle Preclassic certainty, to high probability, to a predicted Mid­dle Preclassic outcome (see Figure 1). Further archaeological investigation in the E-Group plazas ofthe high-probability and predicted groups of sites could recover similar evidence as found in the first group of well-excavated examples. It is also prob­able that other E-Groups exist outside the known

E-Group Distribution, Landscape 
Visibility, and Community 

The distribution of the current sample of known Middle Preclassic E-Groups combined with prob­able and predicted Middle Preclassic E-Groups can provide clues to the earliest community organiza­tion in the Lowlands. The main premise in this study is that the Middle Preclassic Maya con­structed settlements with monumental architecture in very specific locations on the landscape; in other words, although small villages probably existed across the Lowland terrain, only certain places became foci of monumental E-Group construction. Previous studies have concluded that Classic Maya sites generally lie in prominent areas of greater rel­ative height than the average terrain (Podobnikar and Sprajc 2007). Thus during the Middle Pre­classic, the distribution of E-Groups can provide information about the original choices made by settlers when building monumental centers. 
A comparison of two neighboring sites from the well-excavated sample with very similar E-Group construction sequences can perhaps suggest a wider pattern. The first case involves the Mundo Perdido group at Tikal , one of the most thoroughly inves­tigated E-Groups, and El Palmar, approximately 15 km to the west of Tikal , which I recently investi­gated as part of the Proyecto Arqueol6gico El Zotz (Figure 2). The El Palmar E-Group contains very similar evidence of construction over the Preclas­sic period to the Mundo Perdido group at Tikal (Figure 3). The proximity of the two sites raises the question, What factors could have contributed to two similar monumental plaza groups in these spe­cific locations? 
The Mundo Perdido group demonstrates a con­tinual , episodic occupation from the Early Middle Preclassic period to the Terminal Classic period (ca. 1000 B.C.-A.D. 900 [Laporte and Fialko 1995 ]). The El Palmar E-Group exhibits a similar Middle Preclassic beginning but seems to have been com­pletely abandoned during the transition from the Late Preclassic to the Early Classic (Doyle et al. 2011). Tunnel excavations in the western pyramids of each site (El Palmar Structure E4-l and Tikal Structure 5C-54) have revealed at least five to six construction phases throughout the Preclassic, begin­ning with earthen platforms, transitioning to masonry architecture surfaced with stucco, and finally solid block construction with modeled stucco facades (see Figure 3). The architectural fill consists of bajo mud and fine limestone blocks and soils (Doyle et al. 2011 :47-48; Laporte ca. 1983: 1-08-1-25). 
Radiocarbon dates from the fills at El Palmar generally confirm the time line set out by Laporte and Fialko ( 1995) for the Mundo Perdido (Table 1). During the earliest phases of construction, ca. 700-600 B .C., the residents of El Palmar excavated the nearby laguna for architectural fill, with sedi­ment originally deposited around 1800 B .C. (Beta­285473, Beta-285474). This act could also have been motivated by a need to modify the laguna, a hypothesis subject to future investigation. The sub­sequent generations constructed platforms between 600 and 300 B .C., which culminated in a large tiered pyramid with stucco-covered-stone facades, approximately 18-20 min height, dating to the early LatePreclassic,ca.300B.C.-A.D. l (Beta-265817, Beta-285472). The Early Classic population at El Palmar seems to have ceased major constructions by about AD. 300 (Beta-265821), and the E-Group was completely in ruins by the Late Classic period (Beta-285471 ). On the other hand, the Mundo Per­dido shows intense construction episodes and ceramic production in the Early Classic and Late Classic periods (see Laporte and Fialko 1995:Fig­ure 3), conspicuously absent from El Palmar. Pos­sible visitors in the Postclassic period (ca. AD. 950-15 20) utilized the lakeside ruins at El Palmar for hunting or to collect water from the laguna (Beta-285470). Dates from the nearby center of El Zotz demonstrate extensive occupation in the Post­classic (Arredondo Leiva and Houston 2008; Gar­rido Lopez et al. 2010; Roman and Houston 2009). 
The monumental scale of the El Palmar and Tikal groups during the Preclassic is also very sim­ilar (Figure 4). Most notably, the plazas are of com­parable width, a significant fact in light of the construction sequences mentioned above. Excava­tion data show that, as an initial step, the plazas were leveled and paved with plaster, with concurrent construction of the eastern platform and western pyramid. In both cases, the builders of subsequent phases went to great lengths to preserve the foot­print of the plaza: to maintain the size over time, by constructing the bulk of structures away from

the center, sometimes even destroying earlier struc­tures (Doyle et al. 2011:48; Laporte ca. 1983; Laporte and Fialko l 995:Figure 6). A key point to note is that, despite the cessation of construction in many E-Groups during the Early Classic, the res­idents of monumental centers maintained the plaza space throughout generations of later settlement. This pattern of plaza preservation, also noted at many other sites in the area (see Estrada-Belli 2011 :77),could possibly be a defining factor ofE­Groups-that the absolute size of the plaza was cru­cial to those who built the group. One interpretation of the plaza size has been that it created sight lines that allowed for viewing of the sunrise on certain points throughout the year (see Aimers and Rice 2006:Figure 6). Recent research on plazas through­out many time periods in Mesoamerica also pro­poses that these wide level spaces were more than frames creating proper geometric conventions for astronomical alignments but actually gathering spaces for ritual performances (e.g. ,Inomata 2006; Lucero 2003). Thus, the respective E-Group plazas at Tikal and El Palmar were likely the setting of similar social activities for the inhabitants of each community. 
Spatial Analysis 
El Palmar and Tikal are located very close together 
(approximately 15 km), and GIS studies of line-of­

visible, even in Preclassic times (Doy le et al. 2011). Remote sensing and settlement survey near El Pal­mar (Garrido Lopez et al. 2010) and Tikal (Webster 2007) have yet to reveal an E-Group as defined above between or near the two sites. Thus, at least in the area around these two Middle Preclassic mon­umental centers, only two specific places contain a major plaza with a similar inventory of associated major architectural constructions. Therefore, spa­tial analysis of these two sites has the potential to address early geopolitical processes and motiva­tions to build at particular locations across the cen­tral Maya Lowlands. Prior distributional analysis of E-Group sites in the area based on two-dimensional maps (e.g., Aimers 1993) has been inconclusive, in part because it lacked a connection to the topogra­phy of particular local landscapes. For instance, many have noted that there seems to be a minimum

1994; Lock and Harris 1996:225; Madry and Rakos 1996). Spatial research on Classic Maya cities has proposed viewshed or direct line-of-sight observa­tion as a motivation for certain Classic period con­structions (Estrada-Bel1i 2008; Golden 2010; Podobnikar and Sprajc 2007; Quintana 2008:Fig­ure 10). This study builds on such research and seeks to use viewshed analysis as a method to eval­uate visibility as a possible factor in the Middle Pre­classic Maya spatial consideration of the landscape. Several limitations affect the utility of viewshed analysis in the Maya Lowlands, mainly the consid­eration of what a human viewer could have seen in the past or whether visibility was meaningful to inhabitants. (For further critiques of view shed analy­sis in general, see Conolly and Lake 2006:228-231; Wheatley and Gillings 2000:2.) 
Between Tikal and El Palmar, at a distance of 15 km, probably only the largest structures, smoke, and fire would have been visible to the naked eye. Regarding vegetation, viewshed analysis assumes a degree of deforestation, some evidence of which exists in paleoenvironmental investigations (Estrada-Belli and Wahl 2010; Wahl et al. 2006, 2007). Nevertheless, monumental buildings would not have supported vegetation during their use; fur­thermore, despite full forest cover today at sites such as El Palmar, Tikal, and Yaxha, ground-trothed observations still show extensive viewsheds. The current study, which utilized both AIRSAR 5-m resolution and ASTER 30-m resolution digital ele­vation models, obtained results using the standard View shed feature in the Spatial Analyst Toolbox in the commercially available software ArcGIS I 0 by ESRI. In the current analysis, cumulative view­sheds, or the sum of multiple generated viewsheds, display the visible topography from five viewer points on the approximate location of E-Groups at the sample sites, using the standard correction for the earth's curvature. 
From the approximate location of the El Pal­mar and Tikal E-Groups, it is clear that a large ter­ritory around each site is visible, with the majority of the visible areas mutually exclusive and nonoverlapping (Figure 6). The viewshed pattern hints that early E-Groups were constructed to exist on higher ground relative to nearby terrain to allow for a clear view of the nearby geographic area, not solely to view the sun rising on the solstices and equinoxes. Such distribution could perhaps be a consequence of the hydrological processes in the tropical environment, as communities avoided low-lying areas that flood during the intense rainy season. The fact that the viewsheds appear to be at intervals based on visibility of the landscape rel­ative to each other may also speak to the original decisions of the settlers who built the E-Groups at Tikal and El Palmar. In other words, settlers of one area were conscious of how far away they were, or how visible the intervening territory was, from
