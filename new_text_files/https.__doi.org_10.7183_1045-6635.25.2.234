For generations, comparative studies of human economic behavior and practice have been structured by dichoto­mous thinking that has drawn stark divisions between nonindustrial and modem economies, the recent West in contrast to the global rest. In stark contradiction to the individualized utility maximizers often universalized by neoclassical economics, anthropologists and historians have adhered closely to Karl Polanyi's substantivist per­spectives with its "antimarket mentality" (Cook, Amer­ican Anthropologist 68:323-345). Grounded in disciplinary turf battles, Polanyi 's frame generally was translated in anthropology into a basically monolithic categorization of economies as either reciprocal, redis­tributive, or market, with the latter largely applied only to the industrialized world. Economies in the deeper past for the most part were perceived as strictly localized, basically static, and heavily controlled by governing authorities, with zero-sum polarities governing the inter­workings of states and markets. At both poles of the debate, the expectation was that market economies, as in the industrialized West, should basically conform to the notion of a "free market," disembedded from the social, political, and religious. 
Concerted archaeological focus on prehispanic Latin American economies extends back just a bit more than a half-century. From the outset, these efforts have been heavily underpinned by the work of Polanyi as well as Marx's Asiatic mode of production. Logically, the early documentary accounts of the Spanish invaders served as a portal back to deeper pasts, one that implicitly juxta­posed descriptions of administered trade and large-scale storage for the Inca with ample elaboration of Aztec mar­kets for Mesoamerica. Yet framing mattered, and whereas much subsequent Andean archaeology has endeavored to extrapolate and probe the relevance of Inca models (e.g., verticality and centralized redistribu­tion) back in time, traditional scholarship tended to down­play the role of commercialism in the Aztec world, while also emphasizing the distinctiveness of Aztec markets relative to their contemporaries and forebears in prehis­panic Mesoamerica. 
While framing is important, so are data. A growing number of social scientists now recognize that all economies modem or otherwise are embedded in their broader societal contexts (e.g., Granovetter, American Journal of Sociology 33: 119-133). Entirely free markets are no more than a conceptual ideal and so cannot stand as an appropriate metric for the importance of the market in specific economies. Also to this point, an array of seminal interdisciplinary works failed to find a specific 'hinge point' or threshold that definitively divides mod­em economic practices from a qualitatively different past. Ample evidence has been amassed for market exchange and markets long before the advent of Euro­pean capitalism (e.g., Feinman and Garraty, Annual Review of Anthropology 39: 167-191 ). Most significantly, through dedicated research efforts, archaeologists focused on prehispanic Latin America have gained a far greater understanding of distribution systems including markets, while documenting that most Pre-Columbian craft production for exchange was situated in domestic contexts, a scale at which tight top-down oversight would be difficult to maintain. 
In this context, the publication of Merchants, Mar­kets, and Exchange in the Pre-Columbian World comes at a critical moment. Collectively the 18 papers compiled by the editors, following their presentation at Dumbarton Oaks (in Washington, D.C.), do not explicitly outline a unified or even entirely new approach. Yet, published in the wake of a growing corpus of works that challenge old orthodoxies about ancient economies worldwide (e.g., Blanton and Fargher, Collective Action in the For­mation of Pre-Modern States, 2008), this volume, which features provocative papers by an array of accomplished scholars, could indeed mark a tipping point that serves to prod a growing number of archaeologists and ethno-

BOOK REVIEW ESSAY 
historians to reassess key foundational tenets and refine the overarching questions that guide research on prehis­panic economies. 
The volume is ordered geographically with four chap­ters focused on central Mexico (Nichols, Hirth, Carballo, Gutierrez), four on the Maya (Tokovine and Beliaev, Masson and Freidel, McAnany, Kovacevich), and seven that concentrate on the prehispanic Andean world (Dille­hay, Mayer, Burger, Topic, Goldstein, Nielsen, Stanish and Cohen). These illustrative cases establish an empir­ically grounded tone for the collection, bracketed by two introductory discussions (Hirth and Pillsbury, Blanton) and a concluding essay (Isaac). 
In framing the collection, the editors argue that the different ways that resources were produced and dis­persed underpin societal variation, while recognizing that a key to understanding that diversity is to investigate the integrative threads between economic practices and the social and ideological. They see economies as com­plex webs of interactions that link distinct sectors, includ­ing the institutional and the domestic (p. 12); as a consequence, economic change tends to be cumulative, by degree rather than kind (p. 5). Although they do not belabor it, their preferred analytical vantage is clearly multiscalar, cognizant of the frequent, though not nec­essarily uniform, tensions that accrue between top-down efforts to intensify output and bottom-up aims to mini­mize risk (p. 4). The editors also articulate an explicitly comparative agenda, noting that if the highly localized characterization of pre-modem economies did not fit the Pre-Columbian world, with its limited ground transport technologies, then such presumptions would likely be suspect elsewhere as well. 
On a more explicitly conceptual level, the book's second essay (by Blanton) also challenges long-held beliefs regarding economic practice. Rather than seeing interpersonal cooperation and marketplace exchange as essentially antithetical, he makes a clear case that the former is necessary for the establishment and operation of the latter. By so doing, he not only forges a conceptual path between individualistic Homo economicus and anthropology's reluctance to engage markets (p. 37), but he makes a broader point countering the more widespread view that governmental penetration always undermines market efficiency, a perspective clearly not borne out by either his or a subsequent analysis (Gutierrez) of the Aztec economy. 
Spanish accounts of Aztec markets were always too vivid for scholars to ignore, yet the four studies focused on central Mexico point to some of the factors that may have prompted past discounting of Aztec commercialism while also situating these activities in their more specific time-space context. Drawing on her own investigations, Nichols highlights domestic production for marketplace exchange at Otumba, observing that household partici­pation in exchange likely was overlooked in the past based on now discredited notions that domestic produc­tivity generally was low and usually geared toward self­provisioning (p. 76). In his detailed study of merchants, Hirth revisits past energetic models, which may have underestimated the loads that foot porters carried and so undervalued the significance of trade and exchange. He also makes a strong multipronged case that profit was a motivating force for marketplace interactions. Through a detailed focus on the tribute registry from the town of Tlapa, Gutierrez illustrates the complex links between tribute transfers and marketplace exchange that both increased commercial transactions and stimulated regional economic specialization, factors that may help account for the greater commercialization of the Aztec economy relative to those of their neighbors and prede­cessors. Nevertheless, looking at craft production at an earlier central Mexican metropolis, Teotihuacan, Carballo finds no indication of high degrees of direct state control. 
Threads of debate weave through the four papers on the Maya. All of the authors recognize that Maya economies were less commercialized than those of the Aztec. Masson and Freidel are most willing to confront traditional views, laying out a case for the importance of marketplace exchange among the Classic and Postclassic Maya and questioning why Mayanists have searched futilely for indicators of redistribution while only recently looking for market activities (p. 207). Tokovinine and Believ through their focus on linguistics and texts offer support for this perspective. The papers by McAnany (court economies) and Kovacevich (craft production) present new syntheses that are more aligned with entrenched perspectives, although the former entertains and engages ongoing debates that illustrate the multidi­mensionality and cumulative nature of Maya economies. 
The intellectual jousts at the heart of recent scholar­ship concerning pre-modem economies (including this volume) is displayed most clearly across the seven papers that examine prehispanic Andean economies, a region that until recently was thought by most experts to lack comparative parallels. Although Goldstein, and to a lesser degree Topic, retain strong elements of those deep-rooted views in their case studies on Tiwanaku outliers and the northern equatorial frontier, respectively, the other five authors contemplate alternatives (Dillehay) or, in some cases, promote a more prominent role for marketplace exchange in heartland Andean economies, including the Inca. The advancement of a case for markets and non­administered exchange (Mayer, Burger, Nielsen, Stanish and Cohen) represents a key break from previous models of an Andean past in which households were understood to be dependent on hierarchical relations within their ethnic group for the resources necessary for reproduction, making markets a negative force for social connectivity. 
Stanish and Cohen present a model for marketplace exchange (Andean fairs), which they envision as having operated without standardized currencies, a phenomenon

that would not be unique to the prehispanic Andes. Nielsen draws on his analysis of routes or intemodes, passages through the vertical Andean landscape, where he finds a long temporal record of trade with little indi­cation of direct political oversight. Mayer's recollections of Andean scholarship on the topic of markets revisit John Murra 's dissertation in which documentary records were marshaled to illustrate that markets were indeed important in the Inca empire, an empirically based per­spective only rarely integrated into subsequent interpre­tations. Burger (p. 319) builds convincingly on the latter; stating "the real question is the nature, not the existence of markets in the ancient Central Andes." 
Liberated from tired impulses that prehispanic economies were primarily local, politically controlled, unchanging, and monolithic, the authors begin to chart a broad suite of agendas that could productively frame current and future discussions. Burger (p. 320) makes a critical observation that the Andean economy circa 1530, captured in Spanish texts, represents no more than a moment in historical time that reflects strategies of a dis­tinct political institution, the Inca state, that acted to damp down the manufacture and circulation of prestige goods. This perspective reflects on the frequent extrap­olation oflnca models back in time, but it also raises fas­cinating contrasts with Aztec-era political authorities who enhanced market participation and commercializa­tion (Blanton, Gutierrez). The final contribution (Isaac) lays out another comparative angle, contrasting Inca large-scale storage, emphases on labor taxes, low levels of commercialization, and smaller central places with the lack of central storage, a tributary system focused on portable goods, greater commercialization, and more populous urban centers among the Aztec. The evaluation of causal mechanisms and processes that may link these features underlies questions not just for the prehispanic Americas but for a broader comparative analysis of the economic underpinnings of states. 
It is three decades since the polemic surrounding the formalist-substantivist debate was declared over. Yet, even in the face of new theoretical prisms and important empirical findings, conceptual heirlooms and false met­rics remain reflexively entrenched. The authors in this volume outline a forward-looking agenda for the com­parative economic analysis of prehispanic Latin Amer­ican economies (only a few of which are elaborated here). This approach not only promises richer understandings of changes and variation in pre-modem Andean and Mesoamerican economic practices, but also appropri­ately positions our studies more squarely in comparative cross-disciplinary dialogues concerning the history of human economies. If the aforementioned theoretical debate is truly over, then let's take our cues from this volume and also move on from the polarizing and over­simplified legacies that we inherited from that acrimo­nious time.
