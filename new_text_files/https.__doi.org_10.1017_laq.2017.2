PRECLASSIC AND CLASSIC MAYA INTERREGIONAL AND 
LONG-DISTANCE EXCHANGE: A DIACHRONIC ANALYSIS OF 
OBSIDIAN ARTIFACTS FROM CEIBAL, GUATEMALA 

Kazuo Aoyama 
Diachronic analysis of obsidian artifacts collected from Ceibal, Guatemala, can illuminate long-term patterns and changes in the Preclassic and Classic Maya interregional and long-distance exchange systems. For this analysis sources of all obsidian artifacts were identi.ed by a combination of pXRF of a sample of 5,375 obsidian artifacts and visual examination of 7,073 artifacts. The interregional exchange of large polyhedral cores of obsidian from the Maya highlands and local production of pressure blades began after the rise of political complexity at Ceibal, by the early Middle Preclassic Real 3 phase (775–700 B.C.). El Chayal obsidian was heavily used during the early Middle Preclassic period, but San Martín Jilotepeque was the principal source of obsidian in the late Middle Preclassic, Late Preclassic, and Terminal Preclassic periods. Procurement of large polyhedral cores of obsidian from the Maya highlands increased over the same period. Obsidian was also imported in the form of nodules for the production of percussion .akes during the Preclassic period. Throughout the Classic period obsidian was imported mainly in the form of more prepared polyhedral cores that were reduced into pressure blades at Ceibal, and El Chayal resumed its place as the principal source of obsidian. This period also saw long-distance exchange of .nished obsidian artifacts from highland Mexico. Interregional exchange of obsidian from the Maya highlands was of great economic signi.cance for the inhabitants of the community and was more crucial for the development of lowland Maya civilization than was long-distance exchange. 
El presente artículo discute los resultados del análisis diacrónico de los artefactos de obsidiana recolectados en Ceibal, Guatemala, con el .n de clari.car el patrón a largo plazo y los cambios en el sistema de intercambio interregional y a larga distancia entre los mayas del Preclásico y Clásico. Las fuentes de todos los artefactos de obsidiana fueron identi.cadas por medio del análisis de .uorescencia de rayos X portátil (pXRF) de una muestra de 5,375 artefactos de obsidiana y del análisis visual de los 7,073 artefactos restantes. El intercambio interregional de núcleos poliédricos grandes de obsidiana de las tierras altas mayas y la producción local de navajas a presión se iniciaron después del desarrollo sociopolítico de Ceibal durante la fase Real 3 (775–700 a.C.) del período Preclásico Medio temprano. La obsidiana de El Chayal fue usada intensivamente durante el período Preclásico Medio temprano, mientras que San Martín Jilotepeque fue la fuente principal de obsidiana durante los períodos Preclásico Medio tardío, Preclásico Tardío y Preclásico Terminal. Desde la fase Real 3 del Preclásico Medio temprano hasta el período Preclásico Terminal, la obtención de núcleos poliédricos grandes de obsidiana de las tierras altas Mayas se incrementó a través del tiempo, mientras que la obsidiana también fue importada hacia Ceibal en forma de nódulos para la producción de lascas por percusión durante el período Preclásico. En contraste, a lo largo del período Clásico la obsidiana fue importada principalmente en forma de núcleos poliédricos más preparados que fueron transformados en navajas por presión en Ceibal. El Chayal volvió a ser la mayor fuente de obsidiana en Ceibal durante el período Clásico. El intercambio a larga distancia de artefactos terminados de obsidiana de las tierras altas de México fue de importancia social y simbólica, más que económica, durante el período Clásico. El intercambio interregional de obsidiana de las tierras altas mayas tuvo una gran importancia económica para los habitantes de la comunidad. Este tipo de intercambio fue más signi.cativo para el desarrollo de la civilización maya en las tierras bajas comparado al intercambio a larga distancia.

been extremely useful for studying interregional and even long-distance exchange, including the Tehuantepec trans-isthmian exchange. With a large database of geological source samples and many years of studies, laboratories such as the University of Missouri Research Reactor (MURR) have established an outstanding record of success in obsidian provenance research (e.g., Glascock 2002; 
Glascock 
et 
al. 
1998). 
The 
iden­
ti.cation of the sources of artifacts has usually been accomplished through neutron activation analysis (NAA), X-ray .uorescence (XRF), and other technologies, such as inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Although NAA and ICP-MS are more accurate than XRF in detecting elements in very small and thin pieces of obsidian artifacts, both technologies incur relatively high per sample costs, are potentially destructive, and require the export of artifacts for analysis (Feinman et al. 2013). 
Moreover, 
small sample sizes and inappropriate sampling methods often impede efforts to study obsidian distribution patterns (Drennan et al. 1990:180). 
Recently, 
Moholy-Nagy 
and 
coauthors 
(2013) 
used portable X-ray .uorescence (pXRF) to source a large sample of 2,235 obsidian arti­facts from Tikal, Guatemala. Although their total sample of instrumental attributions is much larger than any previous study conducted in the Maya area, it represents much less than 4 percent of the total number of obsidian artifacts recorded from the site by the University of Pennsylvania and other archaeological projects and does not constitute a representative sample of what was brought to Tikal (Moholy-Nagy et al. 2013:74). 
It 
is 
my 
contention 
that 
we 
should 
and can study broader issues of prehistoric Maya economy, such as production, consumption, and exchange, by analyzing a large representative sample of obsidian artifacts from a diachronic perspective. 
I discuss the results of diachronic analy­ses of an entire collection of 12,448 obsidian artifacts from Ceibal in order to shed light on changing long-term patterns in the Preclas­sic and Classic Maya interregional and long-distance exchange 
system 
(Figure 
1). 
Sources 
of all obsidian artifacts from Ceibal were identi.ed by a combination of pXRF of a large sample of 5,375 obsidian artifacts and visual examination of the remaining 7,073 arti­facts 
(Figure 
2; 
Tables 
1 
and 2; 
Supplemental 
Table 1). 
There is a particularly conspicuous lacuna in empirical studies dealing with obsidian produc­tion and exchange during the Middle Preclassic period (1000–350 B.C.) in the Maya Lowlands. This was a critical period, during which many characteristics of social complexity became insti­tutionalized. One principal reason for this gap in our knowledge is that early remains lie under thick layers of later constructions, with the result that large areas of the Middle Preclassic levels at most lowland Maya sites are inaccessible to excavators. Since 2005, however, the mem­bers of the Ceibal-Petexbatun Archaeological Project have uncovered evidence of substantial construction activity in the early stages of human settlement at Ceibal. This was accomplished through deep vertical and extensive horizontal excavations and tunnels into Middle Preclassic contexts, focusing considerable attention on the origins and development of Maya civilization (Inomata et al. 2013, 
2015). 
Our 
excavations 
recovered a total of 6,084 obsidian artifacts from unmixed Middle Preclassic contexts. This is the largest sample and earliest recovered to date from the Maya Lowlands. 


Obsidian Samples 
The lowland Maya city of Ceibal is the largest of all Pasión drainage sites, both in extent and in the total construction volume of its major public structures (Willey 1990). 
Extensive 
strati.ed excavations of the Ceibal-Petexbatun Archaeo­logical Project have been carried out since 2005 in different parts of Ceibal, including two major groups of structures: Group A and Group D, as well as the nearby minor center of Caobal and other peripheral residential group locations. Obsidian artifacts were recovered throughout the city of Ceibal in archaeological contexts ranging from house mounds in the periphery to elite resi­dences, burials, and dedicatory caches in the epi­center.

In this study, I focus on diachronic changes of obsidian artifacts. For this reason, chronological control is of particular importance. Based on stratigraphic excavations, detailed ceramic analysis, and more than 150 radiocarbon dates, Takeshi Inomata re.ned the ceramic chronology of Ceibal (Inomata et al. 2015; 
Figure 
3). 
All 
discussion of absolute chronology in this article is framed in terms of calibrated radiocarbon dates. To ensure temporal control, I eliminated obsidian artifacts that seemed to represent mixed time periods. Because no artifacts were recov­ered from unmixed Postclassic contexts, I do not discuss that time period. A total of 7,182 artifacts were recovered from temporally secure contexts pertaining to the Middle Preclassic through the Terminal Classic periods (1000 B.C.–A.D. 950). These serve as the basis for the diachronic discussions presented below. Temporally mixed samples were nevertheless considered only for the study of spatial distribution patterns of rare artifacts such as exhausted polyhedral cores and Mexican obsidian artifacts. Notably, the Ceibal-Petexbatun Archaeological Project has collected 6,914 obsidian artifacts from unmixed Preclassic contexts alone. The majority of Preclassic artifacts, 6,084 out of the 6,914, are from the Middle Preclassic. Many obsidian artifacts from

Methodology and Results 
pXRF 
I identi.ed sources of obsidian artifacts by com­bining the pXRF analysis of a large sample of 5,375 obsidian artifacts and visual examination of the remaining 7,073 artifacts. The total sample of instrumental attributions is the largest such database published to date for any single site in the Maya area. A selected 43.2 percent sample (N = 5,375) was analyzed using an Olympus Innov-X Delta Premium DP-6000-CC handheld X-ray .uorescence analyzer. This .agship instru­ment combines a large-area, high-performance silicon drift detector (SDD), powerful 4W X-ray rhodium anode tube, and 200µA current (max) plus optimized beam settings, providing faster measurements with accuracy than pre­vious instruments. Prior to artifact analysis, I analyzed obsidian source samples taken from San Martín Jilotepeque, El Chayal, and Ixte­peque in highland Guatemala as well as Pachuca in highland Mexico using pXRF analysis. The obsidian calibration uses a set of very well characterized obsidian source samples in the MURR with data from previous NAA, XRF, and ICP measurements (Glascock and Ferguson 2012).

brought to Ceibal. Obsidian samples were not randomly selected for XRF analysis. Instead, all visually distinct obsidian artifacts were sampled, as were all pieces thought to be from a source other than San Martín Jilotepeque, which was the most common obsidian in the late Middle Preclassic, Late Preclassic, and Terminal Pre­classic samples. This informed, nonrandom sam­pling strategy intentionally skewed the pXRF results toward high percentages of El Chayal and Ixtepeque obsidian; the point was to identify them all. Moreover, a greater proportion of rare artifacts, such as exhausted polyhedral cores and bifacial points, were intentionally selected for XRF analysis. Visual analysis was conducted to correct the sampling bias introduced by the informed, non-random sampling strategy of the pXRF analysis. 
Visual Analysis 
The accuracy of my visual analysis has been con.rmed by a blind test of 100 obsidian artifacts from the La Entrada region of Honduras using NAA developed by Michael D. Glascock at the MURR. The results of the blind test indicated a 98 percent accuracy rate (Aoyama 1999:29). 
More importantly, independent scholars have demonstrated that, at least for certain collections of Maya obsidian artifacts that include the three major obsidian sources in highland Guatemala (El Chayal, San Martín Jilotepeque, and Ixtepeque), visual sourcing is both reproducible and accurate (Braswell et al. 2000). 
Nevertheless, 
visual analysis is not perfect science. I experienced some dif.culty in determining the sources of certain obsidian artifacts from Ceibal. For example, the visual characteristics of some El Chayal obsidian with dusty inclusions are quite similar to San Martín Jilotepeque. Therefore, I .rst submitted a range of optically distinct artifacts to the pXRF for more secure de.nitive identi.cation and thereafter used them as a comparative reference collection of known sources for further visual analysis. The reference collection also included geological specimens exhibiting the full range of optical variability of the precolumbian obsidian sources in Mexico, Guatemala, and Honduras. Future visual analysis will be complemented by petrographic analysis, because the presence and distribution of several compositions of microcrystals are responsible for the color and translucence of the obsidian (e.g., Pastrana 1987). 

The combination of pXRF and visual analysis enabled source attribution of all obsidian artifacts at a high level of accuracy, precision, and reliabil­ity. Random samples have been demonstrated to sometimes underrepresent variation within het­erogeneous populations, especially when there are limited numbers of atypical items, as is the case for Mexican obsidian artifacts (see Braswell 2011:123). 
Prior 
to 
the 
pXRF, 
I 
visually 
iden­
ti.ed all eight Mexican obsidian artifacts from Ceibal; pXRF was not helpful in identifying any more. These extremely scarce artifacts are easily missed in any random sample. Nevertheless, I was not able to identify the sources of two of the eight artifacts through visual analysis alone. I was not familiar with two geological sources (Zacualtipán and Zinapécuaro), and arti­facts from these sources could only be assigned through instrumental attribution. The bottom line is that visual analysis of large, statistically meaningful samples or, if possible, entire col­lections, allows a well-trained lithic analyst to study exchange networks more comprehensively than does chemical source analysis of small samples selected by inappropriate—including purely random—sampling methods. Daniel Pierce 
(2015) 
has 
recently 
demonstrated 
the 
utility of visual sourcing, even in an area of great variability such as West Mexico, where no fewer than 26 obsidian sources have been identi.ed. 
Results 
Prehistoric political economies were a mix of many different resource mobilization strategies that crosscut the production, service, and distri­bution sectors (Hirth 1996). 
I 
reconstructed 
the 
precolumbian interregional and long-distance obsidian exchange system of Ceibal using a com­bination of pXRF, visual analysis, and techno­logical analysis (see Aoyama 1999, 
2009a). 
This 
allowed me to identify the sources of imported raw 
material 
and 
.nished 
products 
(Table 
3; 
Sup­
plemental Tables 2–7). The ancient inhabitants of Ceibal imported obsidian from at least eight geological sources: San Martín Jilotepeque (81.3 percent; N = 10,114), El Chayal (17.3 percent; N = 2,164), and Ixtepeque (1.3 percent; N = 161)

The diachronic changes in obsidian procurement and production are summarized in Figure 
7, 
which compares the percentage of pressure blades in obsidian artifacts with the percentage of artifacts containing remnant cortex over time in Ceibal. Very few obsidian artifacts dated to the early Middle Preclassic pre-Mamom phase have been uncovered in the Maya Lowlands. A total of 290 obsidian artifacts were recovered from unmixed early Middle Preclassic pre-Mamom Real/Xe phase (1000– 700 B.C.) contexts. Pressure blades account for 
39.3 percent (N = 114) of the total assemblage (Table 
3). 
Although 
a 
previous 
model 
suggested 
that highland Guatemalan obsidian exchange commenced with major supplies from the San Martín Jilotepeque source during the Middle Preclassic period (e.g., Nelson 1985; 
Rice 
et 
al. 
1985), 
the 
emerging 
picture 
is 
more 
complex.

The present study clearly indicates that El Chayal was the principal source for Ceibal during the early 
Middle 
Preclassic 
Real 
phase 
(Table 
2; 
Figure 
6). 
By 
way of comparison, nearly all the obsidian from the Early Preclassic through the Early Postclassic period came to Copán, Honduras, from Ixtepeque (Aoyama 2001:348). 
Thus, long-time differences in procurement patterns (east vs. west of the Maya Lowlands) already existed in Pre-Mamom times. 
The Real phase, which has three subphases, was a critical period of sociopolitical develop­ment at Ceibal. At the beginning of the Real 1 phase (1000–850 B.C.), a formal ceremo­nial center with a public plaza was founded at Ceibal (Inomata et al. 2013:467). 
The 
plaza 
was delimited by a square structure (Structure Ajaw) to the west and a long platform (Struc­ture Xa’an) to the east, which constitutes the earliest known example of a so-called E-Group assemblage in the Maya Lowlands. In spite of our extensive strati.ed excavations, only nine obsidian artifacts were recovered from the Real 1 layers 
(Table 
3). 
Obsidian 
is 
quite 
rare 
in 
human 
occupation layers dating to this time period. All artifacts were manufactured from El Chayal obsidian. During the Real 1 phase, El Chayal obsidian was imported to Ceibal in the form of nodules for the production of percussion .akes. This observation is based on the presence of .ake cores and .akes, the high percentage of cortex found on El Chayal obsidian artifacts 
(22.2 percent; N = 2), and the absence of blades. Primary .akes have a remnant cortex on more than 50 percent of the dorsal surfaces, while secondary .akes show less than 50 percent. Tertiary .akes are those showing no remnant cortex. 
Similarly, 
Awe 
and 
Healy 
(1994) 
report 
28 obsidian .akes and note the absence of obsid­ian blades at Cahal Pech, Belize, during the .rst half of the early Middle Preclassic period (1000– 850 B.C.). Small quantities of prismatic blades made from Ixtepeque obsidian were imported to Copán as .nished products, while Ixtepeque obsidian was imported mainly as nodules for the production of percussion .akes during the .rst half of the early Middle Preclassic Gordon phase (1000–850 B.C.; Aoyama 1999:Table 
2). 
During the Early and Middle Preclassic period, the expedient .ake technology also predominated in other regions of Mesoamerica, including the Basin of Mexico (Boksenbaum et al. 1987), 
the 
Oaxaca 
Valley 
(Parry 
1987), 
San 
Lorenzo (Coe and Diehl 1980), 
the central depression and Paci.c coast of Chiapas (Clark and Lee 1984), 
and 
the 
Paci.c 
coast 
of Guatemala (Aoyama 2004; 
Jackson 
and 
Love 
1991). 
El 
Chayal 
obsidian 
was 
transported 
over 
greater distances and in larger quantities than either San Martín Jilotepeque or Ixtepeque obsidian during the Early Preclassic period (e.g., Cobean et al. 1971; 
Golitko 
and 
Feinman 
2015; 
Pires-Ferreira 
1975; 
Zeitlin 
1982). 
While 
Guadalupe Victoria, Puebla, was the primary source of obsidian for the inhabitants of San Lorenzo, El Chayal was the most common source of Guatemalan obsidian at San Lorenzo between the Ojochi phase (1800–1600 B.C.) and the Palangana phase (800–400 B.C.; Cobean et al. 1971, 
1991; 
Hirth 
et 
al. 
2013). 
In 
the 
central 
depression of Chiapas, the inhabitants imported obsidian spalls for the production of percussion .akes from several sources, such as San Martín Jilotepeque, El Chayal, and Tajumulco during the Early Preclassic period (Clark and Lee 2007). 
Prismatic blades of El Chayal obsidian were imported in .nished form at most sites in the Paci.c Chiapas and Guatemala regions during the Middle Preclassic period, although expedient .ake production persisted after the introduction of prismatic blades (Rosenswig 2010). 
As 
in 
Ceibal during the Real phase, El Chayal was the most common source for obsidian at the Paci.c coast center of La Blanca during the Conchas phase (1000–600 B.C.; Jackson and Love 1991). 
In sum, the inhabitants of Ceibal and those of neighboring centers in the Tehuantepec Isthmian region, which included the central depression of Chiapas, the Paci.c Chiapas and Guatemala regions, and the southern Gulf Coast, shared the expedient .ake technology and participated in the El Chayal obsidian exchange networks during the Real 1 phase. 
During the Real 2 phase (850–775 B.C.), the Ceibal E-Group assemblage grew to be the earliest known plaza-pyramid complex in the Maya Lowlands (Inomata et al. 2013:468). 
There 
is no clear evidence of local blade production due to the lack of exhausted polyhedral cores or other 
manufacturing 
debris 
(Table 
3).

blades may have been imported in .nished form to Ceibal during the Real 2 phase. Neverthe­less, many hundreds of pressure blades can be made from a polyhedral core. Given the number of obsidian artifacts related to core-blade pro­duction, including a small percussion blade as well as initial and later series pressure blades, pressure blades may have been manufactured locally during this phase. On the basis of the low percentage of pressure blades (31 percent; N = 18), which include initial pressure and later series pressure blades (prismatic blades) and the high percentage of percussion .akes (67.2 percent; N = 39) and cortex in the obsidian artifacts (20.7 percent; N = 12), it can be hypothesized that expedient .ake production persisted after the introduction of pressure blades. Of the recovered obsidian artifacts from the Real 2 layers (N = 58), El Chayal was the dominant source of obsidian 
(87.9 percent; N = 51), with minor quantities of obsidian from San Martín Jilotepeque (12.1 percent; N = 7). 
In the Real 3 phase (775–700 B.C.) there is unambiguous evidence of local production of pressure blades. The importation of large polyhedral cores of El Chayal and San Martín Jilotepeque obsidian to Ceibal and the local production of pressure blades began after the rise of political complexity at Ceibal. Therefore, we cannot say that blade specialization caused that development. Of the 220 obsidian artifacts dated to the Real 3 phase, El Chayal (69.1 percent, N = 152) continued to be the most common source, followed by San Martín Jilotepeque (29.1 percent, N = 64); for the .rst time, Ixtepeque obsidian appears in the Ceibal obsidian sample 
(1.8 percent, N = 4). The presence of exhausted polyhedral cores and artifacts related to the percussion stage of core-blade production, such as small percussion and crested blades, suggest that large polyhedral cores of El Chayal obsidian were imported to Ceibal and that pressure blades were manufactured locally during the Real 3 phase 
(Table 
3). 
From 
Real 
3 
times 
onward, blade makers in Ceibal created crested ridges to remove crested blades. A portion of the El Chayal obsidian was imported to Ceibal in the form of nodules for the production of percussion .akes. This conclusion is based on the presence of .ake cores, the high percentage of cortex found on El Chayal obsidian artifacts (22.4 percent; N = 34), and a relatively low percentage of pressure blades 
(41.4 percent; N = 63) made from El Chayal obsidian. 
Although no exhausted polyhedral cores of San Martín Jilotepeque obsidian were recovered from Real 3 phase levels, artifacts related to the percussion stage of core-blade production were collected. These include small percussion blades, a crested blade, a platform rejuvenation .ake, and a .ake from a polyhedral core made of San Martín Jilotepeque obsidian. Together, these indicate the local production of pressure blades. Moreover, it is likely that a portion of the San Martín Jilotepeque obsidian was imported to Ceibal in the form of nodules, based on the relatively high percentage of percussion .akes 
(43.8 percent; N = 28) and the high percentage of cortex found on San Martín Jilotepeque obsidian artifacts (18.8 percent; N = 12). 
In sum, the obsidian artifacts from Real 3 phase Ceibal present the earliest known unam­biguous evidence of local production of pris­matic blades made from both sources of obsidian (El Chayal and San Martín Jilotepeque) in the Maya Lowlands. Ceibal society appears to have attained at least the minimal level of sociopolit­ical complexity necessary for the procurement of large polyhedral cores of obsidian and the local production of pressure blades. In con­trast, from the inception of its importation to K’axob, Belize, during the early part of the Mid­dle Preclassic period (800–600 B.C.), obsidian arrived as .nished prismatic blades (McAnany 2004:308). 
At 
Tikal, 
Guatemala, 
Moholy-Nagy 
(2003:Tables 
3.24 
and

identi.ed 
three 
obsidian prismatic blades and two small .akes that dated to the early Middle Preclassic Eb phase (800–600 B.C.), although there is no clear evidence of local blade production. 


Late Middle Preclassic, Late Preclassic, and Terminal Preclassic Periods 
Pyramid building and refurbishing continued, and the local population increased steadily during the late Middle Preclassic Escoba phase (700–350 B.C.) at Ceibal (Inomata et al. 2015:4269; 
Willey 
1990:239).

extensive strati.ed excavations in unmixed late Middle

Preclassic deposits yielded the largest sample of obsidian artifacts (N = 5,794) at Ceibal of any time period of human occupation. The percentage of obsidian artifacts (29.9 percent) among all chipped stone artifacts (N = 19,397) during the late Middle Preclassic period increased substantially from the early Middle Preclassic period (2.9 percent; 290/10,047). Thus, there is a signi.cant increase in the relative quantity of obsidian imported at this time. San Martín Jilotepeque (93.2 percent; N = 5,402) accounted for most of the obsidian brought to Ceibal, while minor quantities were procured from El Chayal (6.5 percent; N = 379) and Ixtepeque (0.2 percent; N = 13). One possible interpretation for this drastic change in obsidian exchange is provided by Geoffrey Braswell (2010:133). 
During 
the 
second 
half 
of 
the 
Middle 
Preclassic period, a bounded network system emerged at the Preclassic center of Kaminaljuyú near El Chayal, resulting in a concomitant decrease in the circulation of the El Chayal obsidian in the Maya Lowlands. In contrast, due to the simpler open network system of the Preclassic eastern Kaqchikel region, where San Martín Jilotepeque is located, obsidian from this source could circulate throughout the Maya area. 
As in the Real 3 phase, obsidian was imported in the form of large polyhedral cores that were modi.ed into percussion and pressure blades during the late Middle Preclassic period. This interpretation is based on the presence of exhausted polyhedral cores and artifacts related to the percussion stage of core-blade production. The latter include macroblades, small percussion blades, crested blades, and a wide variety of core rejuvenation .akes (Supplemental Table 2). Exhausted polyhedral cores from San Martín Jilotepeque and El Chayal that were recovered from late Middle Preclassic unmixed contexts indicate local production of pressure blades. Exhausted polyhedral cores from Ixtepeque from late Middle Preclassic secondary contexts mixed with earlier materials also indicate local blade production. The relatively high percentage of cortex (16.9 percent; N = 978) found on the obsidian artifacts dating to the late Middle Preclassic, a comparatively low percentage of pressure blades (40 percent; N = 2,319), and abundant .ake cores all suggest that obsidian nodules also were brought to the site for the production 
of 
percussion 
.akes 
(Figure 
7). 

The relative frequency of obsidian to all chipped-stone artifacts is signi.cantly greater in central Ceibal than at the nearby minor center of Caobal and other peripheral sites, suggesting that the inhabitants of the epicenter of Ceibal had greater access to obsidian imports than did the peripheral areas (Aoyama and Munson 2012). 
In 
contrast to the high percentage of cortex found on obsidian artifacts from Ceibal, virtually no obsidian artifacts at Caobal have cortex for any time in the precolumbian sequence. It is possible that Ceibal elites distributed .nished blades, as well as already trimmed and partially reduced polyhedral cores, outside of the site center during the Preclassic and Classic periods. 
During the Late Preclassic period (350–75 B.C.) Ceibal became a city, reaching its .rst peak population of about 10,000 people (Willey 1990:241). 
Due 
to 
the 
Maya 
penchant 
for 
build­
ing directly on top of earlier structures, fewer obsidian artifacts from unmixed Late Preclassic deposits were found in Ceibal compared to the late Middle Preclassic deposits (Supplemental Table 3). San Martín Jilotepeque continued to be the most common source for obsidian (91 per­cent; N = 466), followed by El Chayal (9 percent; N = 46). No Ixtepeque obsidian artifacts were found from unmixed Late Preclassic contexts, and only four were recovered from secondary contexts. 
In comparison to the late Middle Preclassic period, pressure blades account for a greater percentage of all obsidian artifacts during the Late Preclassic period (62.7 percent; N = 321). Given this higher percentage as well as the lower frequency of cortex (9.6 percent; N = 49), it appears that obsidian was imported to Ceibal mainly 
as 
large 
polyhedral 
cores 
(Figure 
7). 
A 
small portion of the obsidian was brought to the site in the form of nodules, based on the presence of .ake cores and numerous .akes. 
The relative frequency of pressure blades 
(63.5 percent; N = 202) during the Terminal Preclassic period (75 B.C.–A.D. 200) increased slightly from the Late Preclassic period. The presence of exhausted polyhedral cores and percussion blades, such as small percussion blades and crested blades, suggests that large

polyhedral cores were imported to Ceibal during the Terminal Preclassic period (Supplemental Table 4). Moreover, a .ake core and the relatively high percentage of cortex found on obsidian artifacts (11 percent; N = 35) imply that a portion of the obsidian was imported to Ceibal in the form of nodules in the Terminal Preclassic period. The primary source of obsidian was San Martín Jilotepeque (71.4 percent; N = 227), followed by El Chayal obsidian (28 percent; N = 89). Minor quantities of obsidian were brought from Ixtepeque (0.6 percent; N = 2). 


Classic Period (A.D. 200–950) 
The ruler K’an Mo’ Bahlam (ca. A.D. 415) is mentioned in a retrospective text on the Late Classic Hieroglyphic Stairway of Ceibal, but Ceibal was occupied in only a very minor way during the latter part of the Early Classic period (A.D. 450–600; Inomata 2012; 
Sabloff 
1975). 
Unmixed 
Early 
Classic 

(A.D. 200–600) deposits in Ceibal contained only 64 obsidian artifacts, supporting the con­clusion that population declined during this time. As shown in Figure 
6 
and Supplemental Table 5, during the Early Classic period, El Chayal once more became the major source of obsidian artifacts in Ceibal (79.7 percent; N = 51), followed by Ixtepeque (12.5 percent; N = 8). Only a small amount of obsidian was from San Martín Jilotepeque (7.8 percent; N = 5). In fact, San Martín Jilotepeque obsidian appears in signi.cantly lower quantities in all contexts dating to the Classic period than in Preclassic deposits. In contrast, greater quantities of Ixtepeque obsidian were imported to Ceibal throughout the Classic period than in Preclassic times. 
Previous studies have demonstrated the pre­dominance of El Chayal obsidian in many other parts of the Maya Lowlands during the Clas­sic period (e.g., Braswell 2011; 
Brown 
et 
al. 
2004; 
Healy 
et 
al. 
1984; 
Moholy-Nagy 
et 
al. 
2013;Nelson 
1985;Riceetal. 
1985). 
One 
of 
the reasons for the dramatic increase in the exchange of El Chayal obsidian may have to do with the decline of the Kaminaljuyú polity around A.D. 150 (Inomata et al. 2014:401). 
I 
argue that the bounded network system of the Preclassic Kaminaljuyú broke down, resulting in a concomitant open network system that made it possible for obsidian from El Chayal to be circulated throughout the Maya Lowlands. In fact, from the Xate 2 phase (A.D. 50–125) to the Xate 3 phase (A.D. 125–200) of Terminal Preclassic Ceibal, El Chayal increased from one quarter (43/179) to nearly half (46 percent; 28/61) of the sample, while the percentage of San Martín Jilotepeque decreased from three quarters (134/179) to half (33/61). Moreover, Braswell 
(2010:133) 
argues that very simple hierarchical settlement and extended distribution systems persisted in the eastern Kaqchikel high­land until the beginning of the Early Classic period. These political changes near two major obsidian sources in the Maya highlands during the Preclassic to Classic transition must have greatly affected the circulation of the obsidian in the Maya Lowlands. 
Based on the considerably lower percentage of cortex found on obsidian artifacts from Early Classic contexts (1.6 percent; N = 1) compared to the Terminal Preclassic period (11 percent; N = 35), it can be concluded that obsidian was imported primarily in the form of more prepared polyhedral cores that were transformed into pressure blades at Ceibal. This inference is also supported by the signi.cantly greater percentage of pressure blades (92.2 percent; N = 59) in Early Classic than in the Terminal Preclassic deposits (63.5 percent; N = 202). This pattern, in which El Chayal obsidian was imported in the form of more highly prepared polyhedral cores throughout the Classic period is also evident at the neighboring site of Aguateca (Aoyama 2009a) 
and 
many other Petén sites (e.g., Aoyama and Laporte 2009). 
Macroblades 
and crested blades, which were related to the percussion stage of core-blade production, are notably absent from the Classic contexts of Ceibal, as are small percussion blades (Sup­plemental Tables 5–7). Moreover, virtually no obsidian 
artifacts 
have 
cortex 
(Figure 
7). 
As 
in 
earlier periods, pressure blades were the most common form of obsidian artifact. Microwear and contextual analyses indicate that pressure blades made of highland Guatemalan obsid­ian were mainly valued as utilitarian goods. Both elites and commoners used them for a

wide variety of craft production and domestic tasks. 


Mexican Obsidian Artifacts in Ceibal 
A small number of .nished artifacts (primar­ily prismatic blades, but also small quantities of bifacial points) from highland Mexico were imported to Ceibal during the Classic period. Their restricted spatial distribution indicates that Mexican obsidian tools may have been desig­nated as elite goods. These artifacts are concen­trated in two major groups of structures in the central part of Ceibal, Groups A and D, which consist of public structures and plazas covering an area of about 1 km2. In contrast, Mexican obsidian is completely absent in peripheral areas. The use or display of such small quantities of long-distance exchange goods appears to have been primarily of social and symbolic rather than economic importance. They may have arrived at Ceibal as elite gifts (e.g., Spence 1996). 

A medial fragment of a bifacial point made of green obsidian from the Pachuca, Hidalgo, source was found in an Early Classic secondary deposit in Structure A-2, a large platform. So far, this is the only green obsidian bifacial point found at Ceibal. A proximal segment of a pris­matic blade made of Pachuca obsidian was found in the E-Group of Group A and a fragment of a bifacial point made of Zinapécuaro, Michoacán, obsidian was recovered from the massive A­24 platform. These two artifacts date to the Late Classic period. The paucity of Mexican obsidian—even in the central groups of Ceibal— during the Early and Late Classic periods may be related to the reduced population of this period and the subordinate nature of the elites residing at the site during those centuries. 
A total of .ve Mexican obsidian artifacts were recovered from Terminal Classic contexts. Four artifacts are from Group D: (1) a proximal segment of a prismatic blade from the East Plaza made of obsidian from Zaragoza, Puebla; (2) a fragment of a bifacial point from the West Plaza, also made of Zaragoza obsidian; (3) a medial segment of a prismatic blade made of Zacualtipán, Hidalgo, obsidian; and (4) a medial segment of a prismatic blade made of Ucareo, Michoacán, obsidian. Another medial segment of a prismatic blade made of Ucareo obsidian was excavated in the E-Group plaza of Group A. The notable absence of green obsidian artifacts and the overall scarcity of Mexican obsidian artifacts at Terminal Classic Ceibal indicate that elites may not have participated in developing long-distance obsidian exchange networks during the tenth century (e.g., Braswell 2010:137). 
The 
presence of Mexican obsidian is a sensitive chronological indicator for the Early Classic, Terminal Classic, and Early Postclassic periods in the nearby Punta de Chimino in the Petex­batun region, the southeast and central-western Petén region (Aoyama 2006, 
2009b; 
Aoyama 
and 
Laporte 2009), 
western 
Honduras, 
and 
especially 
the northern Maya Lowlands (Aoyama 2001; 
Braswell 2003). 



Obsidian Exchange and the Fall of the 
Ceibal Dynasty 

Compared to the open network system centered on Classic El Chayal, there was a very sharp delineation of exchange covers 60 km northeast of Copan in the La Entrada region. This region had access to polyhedral cores of Ixtepeque obsidian. Sites in the northern extremity of the La Entrada region, by contrast, received most of their obsidian from the San Luis source, 30 km to the east in Honduras (Aoyama 1999:143). 
This 
sharp decrease in Ixtepeque obsidian suggests a bounded network system in the Classic Copán state. After the demise of centralized authority in Copán during the ninth century, the bounded network system of the Classic Copán state broke down and the Ixtepeque obsidian exchange sphere began to expand, particularly along the Caribbean coast. For example, Ixtepeque obsid­ian was more prevalent than El Chayal at Wild Cane Cay, Belize, during the Postclassic period (McKillop 1996). 

The notable presence of Mexican obsidian artifacts at Chichén Itzá, Uxmal, and other sites in northern Maya Lowlands (Braswell 2010:137), 
as well as smaller coastal sites (McKillop 1996:57), 
implies 
that 
their 
distribution 
became 
more widespread and decentralized during the tenth century. Although Ixtepeque was still the most commonly used obsidian source, even the inhabitants of a small village in Copán imported

.nished prismatic blades from Pachuca and Ucareo sources during the Early Postclassic Ejar phase (A.D. 950–1050; Aoyama 2001:356). 
The 
inhabitants of the Terminal Classic city of Ceibal did not. Moreover, all proximal segments of prismatic blades made of El Chayal obsidian from Terminal Classic Ceibal have scratched platforms, but none of them have pecked-and­ground platforms, which became common after about AD 900 (see Braswell 2011:126). 
In summary, the prevalence of El Chayal obsidian rather than Ixtepeque obsidian, and the scarcity of Mexican obsidian artifacts at Terminal Classic Ceibal, imply that the fall of the Ceibal dynasty may have occurred shortly after A.D. 889, the last date recorded on Ceibal stone monuments. 


Summary and Conclusions 
The results of the present study suggest that El Chayal obsidian was heavily used during the early Middle Preclassic period and that San Martín Jilotepeque was the principal source of obsidian in the late Middle Preclassic, Late Preclassic, and Terminal Preclassic periods. El Chayal once again became the major source for Ceibal during the Classic period. The dramatic decrease in use of El Chayal obsidian during the late Middle Preclassic period, at Ceibal and in many other part of the Maya Lowlands, may have to do with the emergence of a bounded network system at Kaminaljuyú during the late Middle Preclassic. This system broke down during the Terminal Preclassic collapse, resulting in a strik­ing increase in El Chayal during the Early Classic period. 
The interregional exchange of large polyhe­dral cores of obsidian from the Maya highlands, and the local production of pressure blades, began after the rise of political complexity at Ceibal, which occurred by the early Middle Preclassic Real 3 phase. Early leaders of Ceibal may have sponsored the procurement of large polyhedral cores of obsidian along with local production of .ne blades on behalf of their community as a means of consolidating and legitimizing their own political authority. The Ceibal data present the earliest known evidence for the local production of pressure blades made from each source of obsidian (El Chayal and San Martín Jilotepeque). 
The procurement of large polyhedral cores of obsidian from the Maya highlands increased from the Real 3 phase to the Terminal Preclassic period. Obsidian was also imported to Ceibal in the form of nodules for the production of percussion .akes during the Preclassic period. In contrast, material was imported mainly in the form of more prepared polyhedral cores, which were transformed into pressure blades at Ceibal, throughout the Classic period. Ceibal elites may have distributed .nished blades and semi-exhausted polyhedral cores of highland Guatemalan obsidian outside of the site center throughout the Preclassic and Classic periods. Long-distance exchange of very small quantities of .nished obsidian artifacts from highland Mex­ico was primarily of social and symbolic rather than economic importance. In conclusion, inter­regional exchange of obsidian from the Maya highlands was of great economic signi.cance to the inhabitants of the community, and was more crucial to the development of lowland Maya civilization than was long-distance exchange with Mexico.

Funding for my research in Guatemala (2005–2017) has been provided by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology–Japan (Grants-in-Aid for Scienti.c Research No. 21101001, No. 21101003, No. 26101001, and No. 26101003) and the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (Grants-in-Aid for Scienti.c Research No. 17401024, No. 21402008, and No. 26300025). Michael D. Glascock kindly provided me with the database for all obsidian source samples in Guatemala, Honduras, and Mexico analyzed by pXRF at the University of Missouri Research Reactor. Mark Golitko kindly offered me the database for the Tikal obsidian artifacts analyzed by pXRF at the Field Museum of Natural History. Hattula Moholy-Nagy, Hector Neff, and Geoffrey Braswell helped me with solid advice in order for me to start to analyze Ceibal obsidian artifacts by pXRF. This paper bene.ted considerably from thoughtful suggestions of three anonymous reviewers. I thank other members of the Ceibal-Petexbatun Archaeological Project, particularly Takeshi Inomata, Daniela Triadan, Ottó Roman, Víctor Castillo, Juan Manuel Palomo, Flory Pinzón, and Estela Pinto, for their guidance and support during the lithic analysis. Joyce Cunningham kindly helped me to edit the manuscript. I also thank Geoffrey Braswell and Sowparnika Balaswaminathan for their outstanding editorial work. My wife, Vilma Aoyama, helped me with the Spanish abstract. Any errors remain entirely my responsibility.
