or thelack thereof,in our interpretation of sitesand remains—areminderthatwemustbeopento our data being meaningfully ill-behaved or unexpected, even as we analyze them in search of patterns. Perhaps related to the unexpected elements at these sites is the shared interpretive result that these sites exhibit manifestations of the negotiation of change: both volumes do an excellent job of tracing change in material terms and examining some of the lacunae where change is harder to see. 
It is particularly productive to examine these two volumes together because they both squarely inhabit thegenreofsite reportsandrepresent laudablyrespon­sible publicationofexcavationresults.Archaeologists areinagreementthatthe inherently destructivenature ofexcavationnecessitatesthe careful preservationand disseminationofdocumentarydata. Publishing these data makesavailablethe rawinformation upon which proposed interpretations are founded, and thus also provides a means of “undoing” archaeological work forthosewhomaywanttorevisitexcavations withnew questions or perspectives.These idealsofpublication areoften stymied,however,byfactorsincluding the dedicated time needed to analyze, synthesize, and writeupexcavations (which meansthatsuchvolumes maybedelayed until late in archaeologists’ careers, as indicated by the emeritus/a status of the authors of the present volumes); the publishing landscape (whichoftenfavors monographsthatwilldrawalarger audience);and requirementsfor promotionand tenure (which mayprioritizetopical or synthetic books and journal articles). These issues suggest the need for shiftsintheformatandtheperceivedvalue,orpractical utility, of our excavation write-ups. 
The two volumes accomplish publication of detailedexcavationresultsin mainstream—thatis,not gray—literature in somewhat different ways. Their complementary strengths spurusto ask:Howdowe move beyond site reports as an exercise or ritual in documentation?Howcanwepresentand preservedata in meaningful, accessible, and useful ways? Critical priorities include facilitating availability to multiple groups of users, including stakeholders in the country of research and bothprofessionals and nonprofession­als, through language andmediumofpublication, and operationalizing connectivity and comparison across site reports, which would extend the inherent speci­.cityofexcavationsinpowerfulways. Digitalformats forsite reports coupled with digitalforums fortheir disseminationcouldgoa longwaytoward achieving these goals. Impacts would include reduced delays in publication, movement toward global accessibility, andthe harnessingof digitalabilitiestolink,tag,and move between datasets. Putting these tools into the hands of users would encourage ongoing interaction with multiple datasets by archaeologists. The result would be longer use lives and greater relevance for ourexcavationdata, signi.cantlyextending theirreach andimpact.

Archives conceal as much as they reveal, and what they hold and exclude is a re.ection of power—the power to preserve, order, make available. The voices ofthepastlieburied,andittakesapatientandknowing guide to make them heard. 
Christina Bueno is such a guide. Her wonderful newbook, ThePursuitof Ruins:Archaeology,History, and the Making of Modern Mexico, expertly brings a rich and archivally complex story to light, telling the story of Mexico’s Por.riatoera(1876–1911) not through industrial development or other schemes of modernization, as is often the case, but through its deep entanglement withthe indigenous past.Thisis a book about material culture but also about much more.Likethearchaeologistsshe bringstolife, Bueno takesuseverdeeper intothelayered meaningsofthe past, unfoldingtherolesofhighof.cialsandcommon people alike, and in the process weaving a highly readable account of one of the most important eras in Mexican history. 
Itwasduringthisperiod, sheexplains,thatMexico witnessedheightened interest in its rich archaeologi­cal historyamong foreignsavants.AlfredMaudslay, Edward Thompson, DésiréCharnay,Zelia Nuttall, and many others from France, Britain, and the United States came to Mexico to explore, dig, study, and at times pillage. Many priceless objects, such as the Yaxchilan lintels (now at the British Museum) departed from Mexico’s shores and ended up in foreigncollections,attimes,sadly,with thecomplicity of corrupt or greedy Mexican of.cials. Abroad, the prestige of Mexican archaeology rose. At the same time, Mexican of.cials underPresident Por.rioDíaz sought to harness the study of the indigenous past to speci.c nationalnarrativesofMexico’sgreatness.

LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 28, No. 3, 2017] 
digs were launched, at Teotihuacan, for example; vast new bureaucracies, along with newly invented government positions, were put in place; andpartic­ipation in world’s fairs and international exhibitions wasencouraged.Artifacts fromallacrossMexico were collected,transported, stored,inventoried,displayed, andanalyzed.Drivenbythe scienti.c positivismofthe Por.riato,thismassivecoordinationofarchaeological activity represented an unprecedented mobilization of the power of the state to order and control the past.The ensuingfocus on an Aztec-centered vision of theMexican past hadexplicit ideological aims:it “legitimized thepowerof theMexican statebygiving itanexistencethatstretchedbackto Aztectimes,one that re.ected the elites’ perception of the nation and theirplace within it” (p. 42). 
Buenobeginsher analysis of thesedevelopments by surveying the work of foreign archaeologists and savants and analyzing the discipline they helped to establish: Americanism. Driven by a logic of racial superiority,foreign scientistssuchas Maudslayarrived in Mexico with .xed ideas about the hierarchical ordering of peoples. They combined an interest in the aesthetic artifacts of the ancient priestly castes with a studied disdain for the local people liv­ing around the monuments, whom they regarded as degraded.Local people wereusefultotheextent that they could serve as bearers of heavy archaeological equipment or as laborerswho cleared monumentsin preparation for photography. In.uenced by French scienti.c racism, Charnay denied that the Mexican “Indians” had progressed at all over the centuries, whileMaudslayand hiswife, Anne Cary Maudslay, complainedbitterlythatthe local people werefullof superstitions about treasure,evenastheyremovedarti­factsthemselvesunder questionableauspices.Bueno’s treatment of the foreign context, if familiar from the work of other scholars, is crisply done and pro­videsa necessary foundationfor hergreater subject, the uses of archaeological inquiry among Mexican elites. 
Here is where Bueno shines. Rather than retell her story from secondary works on the history of archaeology, Bueno digs into the personal and pro­fessional papers of her subjects, which are in the national archives(Archivo General de la Nación de México), the NationalMuseumofAnthropology,and mostimportantly,thearchivesoftheInstituto Nacional de AntropologíaeHistoria(INAH).Her archivalwork isextensive, rich,and detailed—agranularity that sets thiswork apartinthe .eld. 
The main focus of this close-grained approach is Leopoldo Batres, the Inspector of Monuments, a powerfuland .awed .gureatthe centerofthisentire history. His position, which would eventually evolve into the director of what we now call INAH, gave him enormous power to shape the narrative of the Mexican past that was unfolding in this period. As Bueno formulates it, the speci.cation of a common indigenous past “was thought to endowthe country’s diverse populationwithacommon origin.Italsogave Mexico,a nationmarkedbycenturiesof colonialism, an ‘authentic’and prestigious past, one that challenged its inferiorplacewithintheglobalorder”(p.92).Using his enormous, centralizing power, Batres mapped Mexico’s archaeological sites, directed their cleaning andrestoration, orderedthe removaland relocationof large monuments, and, mostimportantly,bestrode the still-controversial excavation of Teotihuacan, which he promulgated as an essential embodiment of Mexi­can greatness. 
Bueno’s treatment of Batres and other of.cials who vied alongside him for prestige and in.uence is notable for not succumbing to the “great man” theory of history. Sheis unusually sensitive to minor voices—the ordinary peoplewhosestories arestill too infrequently toldinworkssuchasthis one.Again,we owethese poignant storiestoBueno’shardintellectual labors in the archives. To be sure, these are voices that speak from the margins. They could easily be overlooked. Bueno makes them not only accessible butalsoindispensabletothe historyshe tells. 
Writteninanappealingstyle suitablefor readers from the undergraduate level and up, ThePursuit of Ruins is an important andcompelling book.Bymeans of laborious work in the primary materials of the Mexican state, Buenotellsa fresh storyoftheextent to whichthatstate, duringthe Por.riato,employed the indigenous past to craft a vision of itself as a modern nation.
