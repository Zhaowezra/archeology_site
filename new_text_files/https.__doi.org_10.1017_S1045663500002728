LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 20, No. 2, 2009] 
tion of The Human Body and Ideology: Concepts of the Ancient Nahuas, Alfredo Lopez Austin's seminal work on the all-encompassing role of the body among the Nahua, and Mesoamerican peoples in general. It is also this idea of the body as the sustenance and fundamen­tal cosmological bond with the external world that anchors the ambitious effort of Stephen Houston, David Stuart, and Karl Taube to explore ancient Maya mind­sets, feelings, and their expression in everyday life. As they argue, this approach is not only convenient but indeed compulsory, since the body is the only entity that is suitable to grant access to past lived experience and sentiment. 
Apart from the intellectual inspiration of L6pez­Austin' s work, Jill Furst' s research on concepts of the soul in Mesoamerica and-most importantly-a long history of scholarly work conducted by the authors themselves, The Memory of Bones draws from a care­fully designed analytical frame. The theoretical ground­work is applied coherently to interpret a truly impressive volume of iconographic, archaeological, and linguistic evidence. This strategy of data-reliant, balanced inter­disciplinary research, combined with exquisite schol­arship, succeeds in driving home the key points discussed throughout the volume. The well-founded interpretation and the broad scope of the research there­fore separate this study agreeably from many of today's more speculative readings of past body experiences. 
The study is organized into eight well-written and richly illustrated chapters with titles mimicking a psy­chosomatic compendium with anthropological under­currents. The tempo is set from the beginning of Chapter 1, which explores the overall organism, its constituent parts, and their representations in word and picture, relying heavily on polysemy and anatomical parton­omy. From here, the reader is lead through a step-by­step discussion of relevant facets of ancient Maya lived existence and its cultural choreography, ranging from basic physiological functions to the senses and felt emo­tions, mind and personality, identity, and its cultural expression. 
Throughout the volume, the authors are careful to acknowledge the diversity of (bio)cultural body expe­riences within the Classic period. They talk about dif­ferent settings, about gendered social participation and perception, young and old, commoners and elites. Although the authors do use datasets pertaining to dif­ferent epochs, they focus consistently on the Classic period throughout the volume. This consistency allows for coherent coverage of scholarly terrain for an epoch, which is difficult to access from our present, postcolo­nial world and mentality. 
Given the topic, the allusive book title, and myself being a bioarchaeologist, I would have been pleased to see a more in-depth exploration of the physical substrate of the experienced body, namely the skeletal remains and their cultural relevance. Inquiries -like the ones regarding facial physiognomy from the skulls, the cul­tural assimilation of the severe nutritional diseases that show up in the record, or the possible motifs behind the bewildering diversity of artificial head shapes recorded within the Maya realm-appear to be beyond the focus of this study. These facets, along with many other issues that the authors do explore and discuss extensively, trace promising future avenues of scholarly research. Apart from the solid groundwork that the study estab­lishes, it is precisely these new ideas and questions that ; The Memory of Bones inspires, for which my colleagues

Diet, Health and Status among the Pasion Maya. A Reappraisal of the Collapse. LORI E. WRIGHT. Van­derbilt University Press, Nashville, 2006.Vanderbilt Institute of Mesoamerican Archaeology, Arthur Demarest Series Editor, Volume 2. 288 pp., $69.95.

Ecological issues and the biological evidence of social status differences still stand as a stronghold in Maya skeletal studies. Besides broad questions concerning biodiversity, health, nutrition, adaptation, and repro­duction in different sociocultural settings, skeletal research has focused on the role of diet and health in the so-called "collapse" of Maya hegemonic structures at the end of the Classic period. Specifically the question whether the slash-and-burn (milpa) subsistence econ­omy could or could not have sustained over centuries densely settled areas in fragile tropical ecosystems has maintained the attention of the scholarly community. According to this argument, the Maya overexploited the environment, exceeding its carrying capacity, while sus­taining an ever-increasing population and having to meet the growing demands of its ruling elite. Agricultural intensification, mono-cropping, and environmental degradation brought about infections and malnutrition that undermined the inner structure of society and even­tually led to the dramatic social changes and demo­graphic collapse that is documented for large pats of the Maya Lowlands. 
It is this line of reasoning that anchors Lori Wright's monograph. The author sets out to examine systemat­ically the skeletal and contextual evidence for or against the proposed environmental argument, contending that, if the ecological model were true, then a series of changes starting from a qualitative impoverishment in diet and extreme reliance on maize through time should be expected. These detrimental living conditions should

find their expressions in declining health and nutri­
tional statuses in skeletons, coupled with increased mor­
bidity and mortality. To test the model, Wright takes 
into consideration several datasets that are designed to 
shed light on the role of biological factors in the changes 
that once took place in the Pasion region toward the end 
of the Classic period. Specifically, she considers demog­
raphy, dietary chemistry, enamel hypoplasia, and bone 
pathology. To place her information within a social con­
text, the author goes to lengths to characterize the Pasion 
region's cultural history and the social dimensions of 
its burial record. 
Logically organized into ten carefully crafted chap­
ters, Wright's investigation elucidates with each dataset 
that there is no single biological factor or any clear-cut 
pattern accounting for the so-called "Maya collapse," 
at least for the Pasion area. Wright's results demonstrate 
instead that dietary and health profiles were extremely 
heterogeneous on the eve of social disruption. Her 
results therefore contradict the idea that environmen­
tal degradation played a significant role in the sociopo­
litical and demographic changes and at the same time 
point to much more complex scenarios in which polit­
ical and social conflict should have played key roles. 
Without a doubt, the volume benefits from Wright's 
many years of research experience in the Pasion region 
and her longstanding investigation on dietary chemistry 
that have given her a solid understanding of both the potential, limitations, and biases that are inherent in this line of study. Besides the methodological soundness that characterizes Wright's work in general, I consider that the most important strength of this book lies in its explicit effort to interpret skeletal information within broader frames of social and cultural reference. I was especially delighted to see Wright's efforts in exploit­ing the mortuary record to point out (and quantify) the nature and changes of the Pasion sites' social organi­zation and individual standings within the social fab­ric. Her multivariate analyses of burial attributes, interpreted in terms of cautiously formulated proces­sual criteria (derived from role theory), warrant finely grained conclusions on changes in the area's individ­i ual and collective mortuary roles toward the Terminal

Classic. This approach is to be lauded especially in the 
view of the theoretical deficit that still hampers most 
contributions on skeletal information, when intended 
to be integrated with other datasets of the material 
record for broader bio-and sociocultural reconstruc­
tion and explanation. 
On the downside, this meticulously crafted investi­
gation is debilitated by the reduced size and deteriora­
tion of the skeletal series under study, a phenomenon 
that is notoriously known by the Mayanist community. 
The overall sample of 313 individuals, once divided by 
site, sex, status, and chronology, are bound to reduce the relevance and representativeness of the evidence they materialize and its potential for characterizing the living conditions leading to, or accompanying, the social changes in the region. 
In concluding, Lori Wright should be congratulated for having put together an important volume in Maya Pasion research and Maya bioarchaeology in general. This monograph is one of the few that evaluates the human mortuary record on a theoretically informed and regional scale, surely constituting an inspiration for other Maya bioarchaeologists.

Almost every culture has legends that tell of a mythical king coming from far away, a foreigner whose arrival would change the people's destiny. The Tainos were the first population in the New World that Columbus met upon his arrival, so it would be realistic to think that the Italian navigator was the stranger king that gives the title to this book. Much to my surprise, and as the author makes clear from the very beginning, Columbus is just an important character in the whole story. The real stranger king is Caonabo, the most powerful cacique in Hispaniola at the time of the conquest, a legendary and mythical figure also for the Tainos, and whose existence has survived the mist of time thanks to the colorful, and sometimes doubtful, historical narratives conveyed by the European conquerors. But as with all ethnohistori­cal accounts, much of the information has to be inter­preted on the basis of the view, mindset, traditions, and interests of the tellers. 
This book does not require one to be an expert on Taino culture, nor to be particularly well acquainted with Caonabo himself, or any other character or event. 
Taina Indians Myth and Practice: The Arrival of the Stranger King is a book about archaeology and ethno­history. History brings to us written acquaintance with past civilizations; archaeology instead rests upon mate­rial culture. Both aim at the same goal, from different perspectives, with their own intrinsic and extrinsic lim­itations. 
Keegan widens his views and opens up the reader's mind by putting aside the traditional schemes of inves­tigation and trying to objectively analyze and discuss the many different facets of the studies of ancient pop­ulations and even single, isolated events.
