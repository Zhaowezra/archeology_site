IZAPAAND THE SOCONUSCO REGION, MEXICO,
IN THE FIRST MILLENNIUM A.D. 

Robert M. Rosenswig and Rebecca R. Mendelsohn 
We present new regional settlement pattern data from the eastern Soconusco region, Chiapas, Mexico, including a detailedreconstructionofthe firstmillenniumA.D.occupation of thesiteofIzapa. Results from aninitialcampaignoflightdetectionand ranging (lidar) data acquisition and analysis of systematically collected surface remains document the full extent ofthe Classic­period occupation of Izapa. These lidar and pedestrian survey data also illustrate how people were distributedacross the landscape from 100 B.C. to A.D. 1000 (Hato to Remanso phases). Survey results indicate significant populationincrease during the Terminal Formative (A.D. 100–300) and initial Early Classic (A.D. 300–400) periods, followed by avirtual abandonment of both piedmont and low­hills survey zones from A.D. 400 to A.D. 700. The population increased inboth survey zones during the Late and Terminal Classic periods (A.D. 700–1000) coinciding with the presence of a largeregional center in thelow­hills zone and 46 secondary centers recorded within the400­km2area covered bythe lidar survey.These secondary centers consist of numerous small mounds around circular or square plazas. Together, the results of thelidar study and systematic pedestrian survey offer the first glimpse of population dynamics and political organization inthe area around Izapa during the first millennium A.D.

Classic-period Soconusco is best known forthe production of plumbate pottery. This widelytraded ceramic ware is found in elite tombs throughout Mesoamerica (Dutton 1943; Neff andBishop 1988; Shepard 1948:133) and is often as-sociated with Fine Orange and lower CentralAmerican wares (Neff et al. 1999). Shook(1965:190)longagonotedthat “theheaviestcon-centration of sites with this type of pottery typeoccurs on the Pacific coastal plain and foothillsbetween the drainages of the Rio Tilapia inGuatemala and the Rio Coatan in Chiapas. Neff (2002, 2003) has more recently shown that SanJuan andTohil PlumbateWare can be chemicallysourcedtospecificriverdrainageswithinthispartof Chiapas. Nevertheless, we still know virtuallynothing about the political organization of thepeoplesthatproducedplumbateceramics,ortheirfirst millenniumA.D. predecessors.

Ground-truthing of theselidar data confirmed substantialTerminal Forma-tive occupations, small-scale Early and MiddleClassic-period occupation and large-scale occu-pation, with a newly recognized regional capitaland 46 lower-order centers, in operation duringthe Late and Terminal Classic periods. The pat-terns reported in this paper provide a new under-standing of Izapa and the Soconusco. Systematicregionalsettlement pattern data documentchang-ing political organization and changes in popula-tion levels in the Soconusco region for the first millennium A.D. This allows for the possibilityof comparing the inhabitants of Soconusco withthose of neighboring centers such as Cotzumal-guapa in Guatemala (Chinchilla 2012, 2015) andmore distant areas of Mesoamerica, where Clas-sic-period societies are much better understood.The importance of these settlement data is thatthey provide the first glimpse of the organizationof the peoples who produced plumbate wares. 

The Izapa Site 
Previous Work 
Scholars have been aware of the site we now know as Izapa since the 1930s. Not recognizingthefullspatialextentofthesite,Culebro(1939:17,31) presented drawings of two stelae from a sitehecalled “Guillén, aswellasathirdstelathatheattributedtothe “Toltecstyle fromIzapa(Culebro1939:56). All of these came, in fact, from thesame site. In 1941, Izapa was next explored byresearchers from the Smithsonian Institute, whorecorded 30stone sculptures in aweekof workatthe site (Stirling 1941, 1943). Six years later,Drucker (1948:154) excavated 12 trenches andidentified plumbate pottery at the site. Druckerrecognizedthat “sherdlotsfromthenorthwestern group of mounds seemed different from the brown-and-black slipped sherds (that we nowknowdatetotheFormativeperiod)heencounteredin the southern part of Izapa. The NewWorldAr-chaeologicalFoundation(NWAF)undertookfourseasonsof excavationinthe early 1960s and doc-umented that Izapa was a large and complex For-mative-period center (Ekholm 1969; Lowe et al.1982;Loweetal.2013).MembersoftheMexicanInstituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia(INAH)conductedresearchatthesiteinthe1990s(Gómez 1995, 1996).
The Late Formative Guillén phase (300–100B.C.) is considered to be the apogee of the Izapapolity, a dozen plazas in use by this time (Clarkand Lee 2013; Lowe et al. 1982, 2013). The con-structionofplatformmoundsandtemplesatIzaparesulted in the first urban center of the Soconusco region. The plazas at Izapa were lined with stelaeandaltars,manyofwhichdepictcomplexnarrativescenes and legitimize rulership (Guernsey 2006).“Some time before A.D. 100, there was a violent

disruption of Izapa s growth pattern, with centralsections of the community abandoned (Lowe etal. 1982:308). Subsequent occupation shifted toGroup F, north of the Formative-period site core,where a number of earlier stelae were reset. 
The Izapa Regional Settlement Project (IRSP)was initiated by the senior author in 2011 to doc-umentchangingregionalpatterns associated withthe Formative Izapa polity.Three IRSPzones be-tween the Cahuacán and Suchiate Rivers where surveyed(Figure1).TheIRSPconductedsystem-aticsurfacecollectionsineachsurveyzonetode-termine the number of occupied mounds for eachtemporal phase in the piedmont(Rosenswig etal.2013)andlow-hills(Rosenswigetal.2015)zones.Inthe coastalplainzone,theextentof occupationwas recorded in terms of area (Rosenswig 2008).These data provide the basis for reconstructingrelative population changes in the Soconusco re-gion.In2015,IRSPcollectedlidardataforanad-ditional 250 km2 of survey area, followed by theground-truthing of monumental centers to datetheir occupation. In the first half of this paper, wepresent our new understanding of the first mil-lenniumA.D.occupationofIzapaitself.Regionalsettlement patterns are discussed in the secondhalf of this paper. 
Newly Documented Architecture at Group F 
Lidar and pedestrian survey provide new insightsinto the occupation of Group F at Izapa. Lowe etal. (1982:308) had originally identified the lowmoundsthatsurroundedthisgroupasaLateClas-sic house-mound cluster. The NWAF map de-picted a grouping of small mounds around theMound 125 pyramid, a ball court and two plat-forms (Lowe et al. 1982:Inset). They recognizedthat “Group F is a later ceremonial precinct thanthose of the southern and central parts of Izapa,but is no less complex nor was its hegemonyshorter-lived (Lowe et al. 1982:226). The lidardata depict the mounds at Group F as forming asquare courtyard measuring 170 x 200 m (Figure3).As we describe below, this is not a unique ar-chitectural arrangement, and square courtyards,formedbydozensofsmallmounds,werecommonduring the Late and Terminal Classic periods.
The inhabitants of Group F at Izapa were cog-nizantoftheFormative-periodmonumentalcenterto the south. This square courtyard is oriented on the same alignment (18 degrees east of north) asthe Formative-period architecture. The NWAFalso documented dozens of caches interred in the southern part of the site dating to the Classic pe-riod(Loweetal.1982:308).Consistentwithwhatthe NWAF had observed, the IRSPsurvey recov-ered far fewer remains from this southern area that date to the first millenniumA.D.The Forma-tive-periodarchitectureofGroupFinthesouthernpartofthesitethusseemstohaveserveddifferent(possibly ritual) functions after the mounds wereno longer under construction (see further discus-sionintheSupplementalText).OccupantsofIzapaduring the first millenniumA.D. continued to usethe Formative-period monumental center as a lo-cation to inter caches, and we infer that it wouldthen have been considered “Old Izapa.
Results from the analysis of the lidar data re-vealedthepresenceofapreviouslyundocumentedcauseway between Group F and the Formative-period monumental center of Izapa to the south.This newly recognized architectural feature mea-sures250minlengthandextendssouthwardfromthecenterofthesouthernedgeofthesquarecourt-yard that is Group F and terminates at a platformwithasmallmoundontop(Figure3).2TheNWAF designated this small mound as Mound 3 but didnotrecognizetheplatformbelowitortheabuttingcauseway. The Classic-period causeway at Izaparesembles the 3-km long causeway at the site ofCotzumalguapa,whichlinksthenorthernElBaúlsection of the site to the Bilbao component (orig-inally built during the Formative period; Chin-chilla 2011, 2012). Takalik Abaj, on the Guatemalan piedmont 58 km southeast of Izapa,also had a stone-paved caminamiento that linked two structures (Crasborn and Marroquin 2006).The causeway at Izapa likely served as a formalpath for a processional route.
The tentative dating of the causeway is madepossiblebyitsspatialassociationwithaLateClas-sic ritual deposit discovered adjacent to Altar 61on the west side of the causeway (Figure 3).

Izapa Site Size during theFirst Millennium A.D. 
The regional lidar data and pedestrian survey re-sultsdocumentthefullspatialextentofoccupationat Izapa during the first millenniumA.D.As partof the 2011 piedmont survey, all 161 moundsmapped by the NWAF were revisited for surfacecollections.All of the mounds documented by li-dar data collection were also ground-truthed in2011.

Relative changes in site size are re-flected in the number of mounds and in the size of the area occupied by these mounds (Table 1;Supplemental Figure 3). Evidence of occupationwas limited during the Hato phase, when only 12mounds produced evidence of occupation withinan area of 48 ha. Occupation rose again duringthe Itstapa phase (61 mounds within 170 ha) andthen decreased during the following Jaritas phase(38moundswithin102ha).ResultsfromtheEarlyClassic and Middle Classic Kato, Loros, andMetapa phases indicate the virtual absence of oc-cupation in the area of Izapa.

TheIRSP survey results are consistent with previousNWAF interpretations based on excavation data,but present the first investigation of occupation atthe site using systematic surface collections. 


First MillenniumA.D. Occupation of thePiedmont and Low­Hills Survey Zones 
The IRSP documented regional occupation pat-terns within the piedmont and low hills surveyzones. In 2011, project members visited 670 mounds in the IRSP piedmont survey zone(Rosenswig et al. 2013). During the summer of2012, we documented an additional 413 moundswith temporally identifiable remains in the low-hillssurveyzone(Rosenswigetal.2015).Readersarereferredtothedetaileddescriptionofourlidarand pedestrian survey methodologies in Rosenswigetal.(2013:1497–1502).Inbrief,lidardata, projected as a hill-shaded digital elevationmodel (DEM), allowed for visual identificationof mounds higher than 50 cm. All mounds werevisited and ceramic artifacts on the surface were collected,takingadvantageofmoderndisturbanceand erosion where possible.The temporal assess-ment of ceramics was used to determine the min-imum phases of occupation for each mound.
Lidar data and pedestrian survey were used toinfer how the relative population levels in surveyzones changed through time. Although there arelimits to the use of regional survey to estimatepast population levels, especially in lowlandMesoamerica, it is the only way to establish re-gional patterns in a systematic manner (Kanter2008; Kowalewski2008).Theuse oflidardatatodepict the mounds in the survey zone allowed fora much more efficient use of time than would be possible when searching for new mounds in thetraditional manner of lowland Mesoamerican pedestriansurvey(Ashmore1981;Santley1990).Because all lidar data is geo-referenced, everymound could be located in the field using GPS.
The IRSPsurvey of the piedmont and low hillszones is the first regional settlement project in theSoconusco region to investigate prehispanic settle-mentpatterns inthesegeographical areas.As such,there are no direct comparisons to be made withprevious results from other parts of the Soconusco(e.g.,Voorhiesetal.2011).Thenumberofmoundsfrom which temporally diagnostic materials wererecovered is presented in Figure 5 for each of theeight phasesbetween100B.C. andA.D.1000.

During the Late Classic Peistalphase, occupation reached its highest level, fol-lowed by fewer mounds with evidence of occu-pation during the Remanso phase.The virtual ab-

sence of evidence for occupation during the lateEarlyandMiddleClassicoccupationinthesurveyzones is consistent with the rest of the southern Soconusco region (Coe 1961; Love 2007:298;Rosenswig 2012; Shook 1965:186) but contrastswith what Voorhies and colleagues (2011:53–74)report from the Esquintla (Chiapas) area to thenorthwest. Significant Early and Middle Classicperiodoccupationisalsoknownfromfarthernorthin the Tonalá region at the sites of Los Horcones(Garcia-Des Lauriers 2007) and Iglesia Vieja(Kaneko 2011).To thesoutheast,the GuatemalanEscuintla region (and the site of Montana) wasalso occupied during the Early Classic period(Bove et al. 2012; Bove and Medrano 2003). Incontrast, the Cotzumalguapa site on the nearbypiedmont was the location of Late Formative and Late Classic centers (Chinchilla et al. 2009). Thepattern of Early Classic abandonment and subse-quent reoccupation during the Late Classic ob-served in the Cotzumalguapa region resemblessettlement pattern changes around Izapa. In fact,even the construction of the Late Classic El Baúl groupnorthoftheBilbaogroupatCotzumalguapaparallels the construction of Group F to the northof Old Izapa.

Ujuxte and an abandonment of the area in theEarly Classic. Unpublished “Late Classic settle-ment data show dense settlement and a multi-tiered settlement hierarchy capped by the site ofSanta Clara (Love 2007:301). Population peaksduring the Late Formative and Late Classic peri-ods are thus Soconusco-wide patterns.
Although occupation levels were low for theSoconusco region during the Early and MiddleClassic period, the Escuintla area near Los Hor-conessawuninterruptedpopulationincreasewithmore Early Classic occupation than during theprevious Late Formative period (Voorhies et al.2011:75–121). Likewise, Montana was an EarlyClassic capital surrounded by a network of lowerorder centersthat extendthroughthemodern mu­nicipios of La Gomera and Tiquisate (Bove et al.2012).LosHorconesandMontanawerebothcon-nected with Teotihuacan during the Early andMiddle Classic periods (Bove et al 2012; Garcia-Des Lauriers 2007).
Differences between the piedmont and low-hills survey zones are also informative. On thepiedmont around Izapa, relatively few moundsshow evidence of occupation during the Hatophase followed by a significant increase duringItstapa and Jaritas times (Figure 5a). After theLateFormativeGuillén-phaseapogeeoftheIzapacenter, the polity was dramatically reorganizedduring the Hato phase. This is reflected in thelimitedevidenceofoccupationfoundatthesouth-ern site center (Figure 4a). The political turmoilat Izapa had regional repercussions; with one-third as many occupied mounds during the Hatophase as during the previous Guillén phase(Rosenswig et al. 2014) or the subsequent Itstapaand Jaritas phases (Figure 5a). In contrast, therewere similar numbers of occupied mounds in theIRSP low-hills survey zone during the Hato andItstapaphases,andthensignificantlyfewerduringJaritastimes(Figure5b).Hato-phasepoliticaldis-ruption at Izapa and demographic decline weremore dramatic across the surrounding piedmontthaninthelow-hillssurveyzoneonly10kmaway.
Political and demographic disruption on thepiedmont during the Hato phase may have beenrelated to the eruption of the Tacaná volcano,whose lava flow came to within 2 km of Izapa atthistime(Maciasetal.2000).Settlementpatternsdocumented by the IRSP in the low-hills survey zone suggest stable occupation for the four cen-turies of the Hato and Itstapa phases (100 B.C.–
A.D.300).ThenearbypolityofElUjuxte,locatedon the coastal plain 16 km east of the SuchiateRiver (and 45 km from Izapa), collapsed at A.D.100(Love2002b)indicatingthatpoliticaldisrup-tionwasnotalocalizedphenomenonatIzapadur-ing the Terminal Formative period (Love2007:298–299). Neff et al. (2006) identify thetime from 200 B.C.–A.D. 200 as being drier thanthe preceding and following periods.As this tim-ing precedes major changes in any region by acentury or two, the effects of the eruption of theTacaná volcano and the collapse of Izapa likelyseem to be linked.4 
Prehispanic occupation of the Soconusco wasundoubtedlynotlimitedonlytoelevatedmounds.Inthethicklyvegetatedtropicallowlandenviron-menttheseareoftentheonlyevidenceofoccupa-tion accessible without excavation. The mound-counting methodology employed by surveyprojectsacrosstheMesoamericanlowlandsmakeprecise population estimates difficult (Johnston2004;Pyburn1989:1–4).Becauseremainsofear-lierpopulationsareburiedmoredeeplythanthoseof later occupations, earlier periods are often sys-tematically underrepresented. Periods when moundconstructionwaslessfrequentalsoareun-derrepresented when using mound counts as thebasisofpopulationestimates.Despitethis,MiddleFormative through Terminal Classic occupationin the IRSP piedmont and low-hills survey zonesclearly does not indicate that more mounds haveevidenceofoccupationduringmorerecenttimes.Wethereforeassumethatourresultsreflectchang-ing relative numbers of people inhabiting these zones.

A second campaign of lidar data collection wasundertaken by the IRSP in 2015 and added ap-proximately 250 km2 of coverage. This campaigncovered the area between the initial piedmont andlow-hillssurveyzones,extendingcoveragefartherto the south as well as capturing an area west ofthe Cahuacán River to provide a total of almost400 km2 of coverage (Figure 6). A total of 47squareandcircularmoundcenterswereidentified

withlidardatacollection.Surfacecollectionscon-firmed that 26 of these sites contained San Juan and Tohil Plumbate wares and other Late Classic andTerminalClassicceramicwares(Table2).Dueto differences in surface visibility, it was not pos-sible to determine occupation periods for all themounds.Althougheachsquareandcircularmoundcenter that we visited had both Late and Terminal Classic sherds, we could not determine with con-fidencethenumberofmoundsthatwereoccupiedduring each phase. Thus, we tentatively considerthesemoundcenterstohaveallbeensimilarlyoc-cupied during the Peistal and Remanso phases.
Alarge Late andTerminal Classic capital nearFrontera Hidalgo and 46 lower-order centers ofroughly equivalent size (see below) were alsodocumented by the IRSPlidar campaign. The lo-cation of these Late and Terminal Classic centers indicates that proximity to water was a determin-ing factor in site location, because all were builtwithin 300 m of permanent streams. Most sitesare also situated away from the larger Cahuacánand Suchiate Rivers that periodically see cata-strophic flooding. Shook (1965) had previouslyalsonotedthatsitesassociatedwithplumbatepot-tery favored small tributaries.
The largest Peistal and Remanso-phase centeris locatedinthe municipality of Frontera Hidalgonear the Suchiate River (Figure 7). Because themodern community cemetery is situated on thesouth side of the massive 30-m-high centralmound at the site, we call it the Cemetery Site(Supplemental Figure 6). We have been aware ofthis large mound and numerous smaller moundsin the surrounding agricultural fields that are vis-ible from the highway for many years. Lidar dataof the low-hills IRSP zone revealed that this was a formally planned site with dozens of moundsarranged to outline the shape of a cross (Figure7). The long leg of the cross extends 1,340 maligning northwest-southeast and is intersectedperpendicularly by a second 640-m long arm,aligned northeast to southwest. The 30-m-highmound is located in the northern half of the longarm just southeast of the intersection of the twoarms, its long axis aligned northeast-southwestliketheshorterlegofthecross.Thesmallmoundsthat outline the cross delineate an internal spaceof 39 ha. The southeast section of the site was disturbedandnumerousmoundsdestroyedbythe highway that runs from KM12 on the Tapachula-Guatemala highway to Ciudad Hidalgo. Severalmounds also were leveled during the digging ofdrainagecanalsinabananaplantationinthenorth-ern area of the site. Late andTerminal Classic ce-ramics were recovered from most of the mounds at this site (including the northern area wheremoundsweredestroyed),allowingustoinfercon-temporaneous occupations for destroyed parts ofthe site. 
We visited and collected surface materials at the Cemetery Site and at 26 of the 46 proposedLate and Terminal Classic-period secondary cen-ters (Table 2). Five of these centers (Sites 31, 32,33, 34, and 35) were recorded by the low-hills li-dar data and were surface collected in 2012 (Rosenswig et al.2015). FiveClassic-periodcen-ters were documented in the piedmont surveyzone in 2011. As mentioned above, one of theseLateandTerminalClassic-periodcentersisGroupFatIzapa.FourotherClassic-periodcenters(Sites3, 7, 8, and 9) were documented in the piedmontsurvey zone and were dated by pedestrian survey(Rosenswig et al. 2013). Site 2 is located on thewest bank of the Cahuacán River. Sites 4, 5, and6 are located in Guatemala on the east bank of the Suchiate River. These four sites fell outside of the IRSP pedestrian survey zone and have notyet been visited. In the new lidar survey zonesestablished in 2015, an additional 20 square andcircular Classic-period centers were visited andsurface collected (Table 2; Figure 6). To date, theIRSP has therefore visited and confirmed Late and Terminal Classic occupation of 26 of thesesites.Thedatesoftheremaining20sitesthathavenot yet been visited are inferred based on consis-tencyinsize,shape, andlayout ofthesesiteswiththose that have confirmed Late and Terminal-Classic occupations.
WiththislargesampleofnewlyidentifiedLateandTerminalClassic-periodcentersafewgeneralobservations are possible. These sites have eithera square or circular layout with numerous smallmounds circumscribing a central plaza space thatcontainedoneornumerousmounds(Table2).Weexplored the possibility that site shape corre-sponded to different periods of occupation but,because they all contain both San Juan and TohilPlumbate pottery, our conclusion is that they donot.Somesitesclearlyhaveasquareshape(Figure

Initial survey results from a 28-km2 area revealedthatLateClassicremainscoverthegreat-est number of hectares of any period (Rosenswig2008). Subsequent expansion of the coastal plainsurvey zone to a total of 70 km2 confirmed these initialfindings.Nomonumentalcentershavebeenidentified on the coastal plain. Recent work byMarx Navarro-Castillo (2014, 2015) shows thatthe site of MiguelAlemán had extensive occupa-tion but no monumental center.

Discussion 
TheIRSPsettlementdatareveallateEarlytoMid-dle-Classic period abandonment of the region.There was widespread occupation of both thepiedmont and low-hills survey zones during theprecedingItstapaandJaritasphases.Thiswasfol-lowedbyamarkeddecreaseinoccupationduringtheKato,Loros,andMetapaphasesatIzapa(Fig-ure 4d and 4e), when occupation is identified atonly a few mounds across the region (Figure 5).Because the drop in population did not occur ineither of the IRSP survey zones until after A.D.400, we suggest that the Izapa region does not fitthe Terminal Formative-period collapse docu-mented elsewhere, including the Maya lowlands,between A.D. 100–250 (Grube 1995; Love2007:298–299). Popenoe de Hatch et al. (2011)argue that demographic collapse may be relatedto ecological problems, including the desiccationof Guatemalan lakes, which led to a disruption ofthe Miraflores trade network during that earlierperiod.
The paucity of population documented by theIRSPsurveyfortheperiodbetweenA.D.400and
A.D.700coincides witha timeof intense interre-gional interaction (Pasztory 1978). Several re-searchers have highlighted this period as a timeof intense cultural contact between southern Mesoamerica and Teotihuacan in central Mexico (Braswell2003;Pasztory1978).TheNWAFusedthe term Middle Classic to refer to the periodwhenTeotihuacan-styleceramicfeatures, such assquareslabsupportsoncylindricalvessels,appearatIzapa(Loweetal.1982:147).Oneinterpretation 
of the population decline between A.D. 400 and700 in the IRSP survey zone is that the influenceof Teotihuacan on the Pacific Coast resulted in a major shift away from the Soconusco region inanotherwisestableoccupationpattern.Thisisthecasebecausesubsequent LateandTerminalClas-sic occupation increased as architectural centerswere established near the Formative-period sites(see below).
Another explanation for a gap in known occu-pation in the Soconusco region fromA.D. 400 to700 could be our poor understanding of ceramictypologies associated with these phases. The ce-ramics of the Itstapa through Remanso phases atIzapa were defined by the work of Thomas Lee(1978;Loweetal.1982:141–157).Leeestablishedthe ceramic chronology for these phases largelyon the stratigraphic association of a series of ce-ramic offerings in Mound 125a at Group F ofIzapa. This sequence was particularly importantfor the Kato, Loros, and Metapa phases, as theceramic materials associated with these phaseswere never documented outside of Izapa. EarlyandMiddleClassicutilitarianceramicsarepoorlyunderstood,whichmaylimitourabilitytoidentifyoccupation during this time.
DespiteourlimitedunderstandingoftheEarlyand Middle Classic-period ceramic phases, theIRSP survey did identify ceramic remains of theKato (Figure 4d) and Metapa (Figure 4e) phasesin the vicinity of what had been the monumentalcenter of Izapa during the Formative period.Mendelsohn s (2016) also recovered Kato,Metapa,andpossiblyLorosphaseceramicsinherexcavations south of the monumental center of Izapa, thus further expanding our knowledge ofoccupation at this time.
AnintriguingindicatorthattheEarlyandMid-dle Classic periods are not well understood in theIzapa area is thepresence ofsquareslab-feetsup-ports on open dishes with a basal flange. Suchvessels are part of the Tiquisate Ware (Supple-mental Figure 8) from the Metapa phase thatmarks the beginning of the plumbate pottery tra-dition (Lee 1978:290). This distinctive MiddleClassic-period form was thus part of a ceramicware type that evolved into San Juan PlumbateWare. It is possible that eroded and fragmentedTiquisate body and rim sherds collected duringsurveyaremistakenforSanJuanPlumbateWare,

resulting in the underrepresentation of Metapaphase ceramic wares.
The Late Classic period saw another period ofcultural change in the Soconusco region, with anoverall increase in population and the occupationofalocalcapital(Figure7)and46secondarycen-ters (Figure 6). The importance of the Soconuscoregion as the center of both San Juan and TohilPlumbateWareproductionisnotanewdiscovery(see Neff 2002, 2003), but the IRSP results pre-sented in this paper provide initial glimpses ofpoliticalreorganizationandregionaldemographicgrowth during Peistal times.
Analysis of the IRSP lidar data reveals a newsettlement system that was established during theLateClassicperiodandpersistedthroughtheTer-minal Classic (Figure 6). Interestingly, moundcenters were not clustered around the Cahuacán River,wherechemicaldataindicatethatSanJuanPlumbateclaysweremined(Neff2002).Thissug-gests that direct control of ceramic productionwas not a determining factor in site placement.Centers alsodo not appeartoberegularlydistrib-uted across the region, as central place modelswouldpredict,basedontheprincipleofleasteffortand economic rationality. Instead, clusters oflower-ordercentersarediscernibleinthreeorfour distinct areas with no centers close to the local capital, that is, the Cemetery Site (Figure 6). Fis-sioningofagriculturalcommunities experiencingpopulationgrowthcouldaccountfortheclusteringof secondary centers with closely related individ-uals occupying fertile agricultural land nearstreams. 
Athirdissuetouchedonbythepresentationofthese IRSP data is the age of the Remanso phaseand associated Tohil Plumbate Ware. The Re-manso phase was designated Early Postclassicand dated to A.D. 900–1200 with effigy vessels,hollow-foot tripod jars, low bowls, small hemi-spherical bowls and ladle censers being commonceramic forms (Lowe et al. 1982:153–157; Shep-ard 1948:4–16). The Remanso ceramic assem-blage also has shallow utilitarian dishes and deepsub-sphericalformsthatallhaveflat,evertedrims.These utilitarian vessels are, however, difficult todifferentiatefromthoseusedduringtheLateClas-sic Peistal phase. As Lowe and colleagues havepointed out, “[t]here are no radiocarbon determi-nations to help fix the terminal date for the Re-manso-phase occupation of Izapa (Lowe et al.1982:157). In fact, the only acceptable Remanso-phase date has a one-sigma range of A.D. 760–1060 witha median dateofA.D. 910 (Loweet al.1982:Table 7.1).
The dating of Tohil Plumbate Ware (and byassociation the Remanso phase) depends on ce-ramiccrossdatingwiththeoccupationofTulaandChichén Itzá, where it occurs in the Tollan phaseof the former and the Sotuta complex of the latter(Bey1986;BeyandRingle2007:391–395;Smith1971). Shook (1965:190–191) makes this clear: 
theplumbateceramictraditioncontinuedvig-orouslywithanewtype,Tohil,inthefoothillsandupperslopesinsouthwestGuatemaladur-ing Early Postclassic times (fig. 4a-c). Basicchangesweremadeinpasteandstyle(Shepard1948) from Late Classic San Juan Plumbate.EffigystylesarestronglyMexicanized.TradeinTohil Plumbatewares extendedthroughoutandevenbeyondMesoamerica.Thistimesyn-chronizeswith the dominance oftheToltec in highlandMexicoandtheirfar-flunginfluence. 
Tohil Plumbate vessels have been found from NayaritinnorthernMexicotoPanamainthesouth,and at the Maya sites of Chichén Itzá and Copán(Shepard1948:105–112).Shepard(1948:1)calledTohil Plumbate “one of the most outstanding in-dexfossils fortheregion. Thecurrentlyacceptedredating of Chichén Itzá to the Terminal Classicand Tula to the Epiclassic (Kowalski and Krist-ian-Graham 2007) affects the end date for the Re-manso phase. Aimers (2007:331–332) dates theTerminal Classic to A.D. 750–1050, noting itschronological variability across the Maya low-lands. Andrews et al. (2003) date it more restric-tively in the northern lowlands toA.D. 800–1000.Further, Ringle et al. (1998) argue that the con-struction of Chichén Itzá dates primarily to be-tweenA.D. 700–1000. Recent reevaluations con-cludethatTulawaslikelynottheextensiveempireclaimed by Aztec accounts (Smith and Montiel2001) and that significant occupation of the sitewas earlier than traditionally believed (Healan2012:75–85). The lowest excavated levels withTollan-phaseceramicsatTulaarethosethatcontainTohilPlumbatevesselsandhaveassociatedradio-carbon dates of A.D. 700–950 (Smith 2007:583–586).

discussion of the highland Mexican or lowlandMaya chronologies, but we suggest that the endofTohilPlumbateWareproduction,and theoccu-pation of the square and circular centers datedusing this ware type, likely occurred during thelast three centuries of the first millenniumA. D. 


Conclusion 
Much work remains to be done before we under-stand the first millenniumA.D. occupation of theSoconusco region.The regional data presented inthis paper provide an initial step in this processby documenting how populations occupied theregional landscape during eight ceramic phases(Hato to Remanso) from 100 B.C. to A.D. 1000(Figure 2). The IRSP survey results indicate sig-nificant increases in population levels during theTerminal Formative Itstapa (A.D. 100–300) andinitialEarlyClassicJaritas(A.D.300–400)phases,followed by a virtual abandonment of both thepiedmont and low-hills survey zones during laterEarly and Middle Classic times (A.D. 400–700).Asignificantpopulationincreasealsooccurredinboth IRSP survey zones during the Late and Ter-minal Classic periods (A.D. 700–1000), concur-rentwiththeoccupationofalargeregionalcenterand46secondarycenterswithinthe400-km2area coveredbyIRSPlidardata.Thesecondarycentersconsist of numerous small mounds outlining cir-cularorsquareplazasandcontainedSanJuanandTohil Plumbate ceramics. These Late and Termi-nal-Classic period centers and changing demo-graphic patterns provide the first glimpse of po-liticalorganizationintheareaaroundIzapa.Futureexcavations will build on the preliminary resultspresented here and will enable us to understandthe Soconusco region during the first millennium
A.D. in a way that approaches what is known ofthe Maya area, theValleyof Oaxaca, or theBasinof Mexico.

Notes 
1. 
Inomata et al. (2014) have recently proposed a revisedchronology forsouthernMesoamericathat wouldpushanum-ber of Late Formative phases later in time. We will awaitfuture data from Izapa before revising the site chronology. IntheSupplementaltext,weaddressseveralchronological issuesin more detail.

3. 
Recent reanalysis of Mound 61 redates occupation toinclude Hato and Itstapa phases (Clark and Lee 2013). Thisconfirms that excavation provide a more accurate dating thansurface survey. However, as the latter is not feasible on a re-gional scale (at least not in a single lifetime), we must acceptthe error range inherent in settlement survey.

Macias et al. (2000:1244, Table 1) date the eruption ofTacan based on three radiocarbon dates with 1-sigma rangesofA.D. 38-216.
