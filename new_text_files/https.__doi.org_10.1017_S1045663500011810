LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 24, No. 3, 2013] 
He makes a good case for how comparative modal analy­sis can uncover culturally significant type-variety vari­ability within ceramics at the local, regional, and interregional levels. 
Aimers and Graham (Chapter 6) offer an analytical model using type-variety in the study of Postclassic Lamanai. Translating the ceramics from Lamanai into the language of type-variety allows them to make infer­ences at the inter-site and regional level and enables them to examine the political, economic, social, and religious life at the site. Like Bill and several others, they focus on the utility of the ceramic system as it allows them to link their material more easily to other Postclassic com­plexes by including ambiguous sherds that may repre­sent several types or types not easily identified. Finally, they illustrate how type-variety data can be studied using material science and iconographic analysis, creating a typology that integrates all three approaches as a way to address a broader range of questions. 
Aimers' conclusions (Chapter 13) can be considered in tandem with the first chapter. Here he does little more than offer responses to problems typically raised regard­ing type-variety analysis but does make some useful comments about the need for greater reflexivity by ceramicists, which includes the need to state the assump­tions that underlie their conclusions as well as the pre­conceptions, goals, and biases that they bring to the ceramic table. 
The second half of the volume presents case studies that further illustrate the ideas offered in the first six chapters. One theme emerging from the case studies is the importance of visually examining sherds from other collections. The contributions by Sullivan and Awe (Chapter 7), Ball and Taschek (Chapter 9), and Aimers' conclusions all strongly highlight this notion. As some­one who recently viewed collections of early Maya ceramics in Belize and Guatemala with a colleague, I can attest to the value of such an approach. I would add that combining visual examination with a photographic record is very useful, and therefore I also advocate the utility of visual images, something that Ball and Taschek seem to indicate is of minimal value. 
Another emerging theme is that traditional type-vari­ety analysis remains useful. The end result of Sullivan and Awe's type-variety analysis is the presentation of Cahal Pech 's early Middle Preclassic Cunil ceramic com­plex. They provide basic information on the earliest ceramics from Belize through the lens of traditional type­variety description. Ball and Taschek also offer an exam­ple of old-school type-variety analysis, in which the analytical units are accepted uncritically. They use the presence of types and varieties at various sites in con­junction with broadly discussed archaeological contexts to create a narrative of invasion, fleeing refugees, and site reoccupation by said refugees in the Latefferminal Classic period. The authors rely primarily on the strength of their abilities to identify and compare types, and the fundamental truth of these types to develop their inter­pretative model. 
The contribution by Milbraith and Peraza Lope (Chapter I 2) also uses type-variety analysis in a tradi­tional way. They offer a descriptive look at the history and chronology of the Chen Mui Modeled Censer, a pot­tery type commonly associated with Mayapan, explor­ing the origins, use, wider distribution, iconography and deities found on it. While offering an excellent overview, it seems a bit out of place in a volume focused explic­itly on issues related to the type-variety system. 
The most innovative chapters are the ones by Urban et al. (Chapter 10), Callaghan et al. (Chapter 8), and Cecil (Chapter I 1 ). Each is an example of how type-vari­ety analysis can be used to explore complex cultural pat­terns and interactions across time and space. Cecil's contribution looks at distributions of Early and Late Post­classic pottery in the central Peten at the group level. She is able to detect changes in slipping technology through visual and chemical analysis (LA-ICP-MS) of slips and paints and then infers trade patterns by integrating this data with decorative styles. She then combines this data with INAA paste data; her results suggest that the Early Postclassic potters were trying to continue Late Classic traditions and that pottery was similar across the region. This pattern changes in the Late Postclassic with the development of group-specific decorative patterns and pastes, reinforcing archaeological and ethnohistorical information supporting migrations of new groups from the north. 
Callaghan et al. determine that changes in the tech­nological style of Holmul region ceramics from the late Preclassic to Early Classic were more than skin deep; i.e., that shifts in surfaces from red to orange and waxy to glossy were accompanied by changes in paste recipes or firing processes. Technological style once more is considered as a way to identify and understand social identity. To test existing models offered to explain these changes they use a sample of orange and red type-forms (one type within a form) subjecting them to stereomi­croscopic, thin sectioning, and IN AA. They discover the opposite of what they anticipated-there is more, not less, variety in paste recipes and less exclusivity in Early Classic pottery and the Early Classic pastes recipes develop from Late Preclassic. They conclude that the changes may result from changes in social structure or worldview as opposed to the invasion or prestige goods model. Urban et al. offer an example of how type-vari­ety analysis can be used to "see" Early Postclassic occu­pation in three areas of northwest Honduras. The ceramic expression of contemporaneous occupations even within a relatively small region can vary significantly. There­fore, using one set of ceramic criteria may render some of these occupations invisible. The type-variety system permits them to look not only at frequency data, but also

at variation in different modes, such as paste, surface fin­ish, decoration, and form. Higher units such as the group and system provide ways to classify and compare less identifiable pieces. By approaching their sites with a flexible view of how to identify Early Postclassic occu­pations, they can "see" them on the basis of shifts in types in one area; shifts in paste composition and frequencies in a second where earlier types continue; and in the third case, on the basis of shifting frequencies of local and imported ceramics, changes in local decoration and paste composition. 
This is the first comprehensive volume dedicated to the classification system that for better or worse we all use in the study of Maya ceramics. The ideas and exam­ples show how type-variety can address important ques­tions in Maya archaeology beyond just typological/ chronological ones. And it also does a nice job of cov­ering the Maya world, showcasing some of the most important ceramicists and their efforts. The use of the ceramic system and technological style emerge as major methodological contributions, as do the ways contribu­tors integrate other types of ceramic data with traditional type-variety analysis to tease out cultural practices of the ancient Maya. If there is a weakness to the book, it is that several contributions do not seem to fit into the goal of exploring new approaches to type-variety analysis. Another worthy addition to the Maya Studies series, I recommend Ancient Maya Pottery to ceramicists and Maya archaeologists, particularly graduate students studying Maya ceramics.
