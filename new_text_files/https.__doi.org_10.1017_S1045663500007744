MORTUARY PRACTICES AND HUMAN SACRIFICE IN THE MIDDLE 
CHAO VALLE Y OF PERU: THEIR INTERPRETATION IN THE 
CONTEXT OF ANDEAN MORTUARY PATTERNING 

Catherine Gaither, Jonathan Kent, Victor Vasquez Sanchez, Teresa Rosales Tham 
Investigations at several northern Peruvian coastal archaeological sites by archaeologists and physical anthropologists are beginning to provide details on long-term patterning of mortuary behavior. Some of these patterns include retainer sacri­.fice, child sacrifice, and the metaphorical principle we refer to as "like with like." In this paper, we discuss the data relat­ing to these mortuary patterns discovered at the site of Santa Rita B in the middle Chao Valley. Examples of each of the patterns presented are evident at the site. These include at least three child sacrifices and one adult sacrifice. The sacri­fices appear to be retainer sacrifices, defined as sacrifices intended to accompany a deceased principal personage in the afierlife. The inclusion of the child sacrifices with a subadult principal burial is part of the "like with like" pattern seen here and at other Andean sites. Dating to the start of the Late Intermediate period (ca. A.D. 1100-1300), these finds are compared to other north coastal sites, both earlier and later, and the extent of temporal continuity in these patterns is dis­
cussed. 
Basdndose en investigaciones arqueologicas llevadas a cabo en varios sitios de la costa norte def Peru, arqueologos y antropol­ogos ffsicos han mostrado la larga tradicion de los patrones funerarios en la region. Algunos incluyen el sacrificio humano incluso de niiios, }unto con un patron metaforico que denominamos "similar con similar." Presentamos aqu( datos mortuar­ios del sitio arqueologico Santa Rita B, valle medio de Chao, que contiene ejemplos de cada uno de los patrones. Estos incluyen, por lo menos, tres sacrificios de niiios y uno de adulto, que aparecen como acompafiantes, del personaje principal en la vida futura. Los nifios, incluidos con un subadulto principal, son parte de lo que denominamos "similar con similar", y ha sido registrado en otros sitios andinos. Perteneciendo al inicio de! Periodo Intermedio Tard{o (ca. I JOO d.c. a 1300 d.c.), estos des­cubrimientos se comparan con ot10s de la costa norte, tanto tempranos como tardfos, y discutimos su continuidad temporal. 

number of sites in the Andean region have Ayielded sizable samples of human remains from different contexts. These sites offer researchers a unique opportunity to study the mor­tuary practices of various cultures in a specific region through time. Among the most notable cul­tures whose mortuary practices have been exten­sively studied are both the Moche (ca. AD. 200-800) and the Inka (ca. AD. 1450-1532) (Alva l990;Alva andDonnan 1993;Donnan 1986, 1994, 1995, 1997, 2003; Donnan and Mackey 1978; Ver­ano 2003). The dramatic discoveries of numerous Inka child sacrifices, known as the capac hucha, have given researchers insight into the last culture to dominate this region prior to conquest, the Inka (Chamberlain and Pearson 2001; Reinhard 1998; Vreeland 1998). Human sacrifice, however, is not unique to the Inka, and in fact, originated long before they rose to prominence, as did other mor­tuary practices. 
The Moche culture on the north coast of Peru also practiced human sacrifice. Among the recent finds are excavations of a number of burials and sacrifice victims at ritual centers and ceremonial complexes, including Sipan in the Lambayeque Valley, Huaca de la Luna in the Moche Valley, and Huaca Cao Viejo at the El Brujo complex in the Chicama Valley. These vary from elaborate tombs

(e.g., Sipan) to plazas full of sacrificial victims, such as Plazas 3A and 3C at Huaca de la Luna (Bourget and Newman 1998; Verano 1997). 
These contexts bring to light what is lacking in the knowledge base of mortuary practices: archae­ological data from nonritual centers or non-huaca sites. Additionally, there is a question about the extent to which Late horizon mortuary practices represent patterns established in earlier time peri­ods. Recent work at a site on the north coast of Peru, Santa Rita B in the Chao Valley, has uncovered sac­rificial victims apparently interred as offerings along with at least one principal burial. The finds are associated with a post-Moche, pre-Chimu cul­ture, dating to approximately A.D. 1100, and together with the finds from other sites, suggest long-term patterning of certain mortuary behav­iors. The mortuary pattern at Santa Rita B appears to be consistent with the general pattern seen in the earlier Moche culture. The principal individual is buried in a typical extended position and has camelid remains included in the burial offerings. The camelid is a subadult as is the human burial. There are also retainer burials (individuals sacri­ficed to accompany the deceased in the afterlife), some of them children. We suggest that the evi­dence from this site fits the pattern seen not only at well-documented Moche sites, but also some of the mortuary patterns seen in the Andean region in general through time. These include (but are cer­tainly not limited to) retainer sacrifice, child sacri­fice, and a principle we refer to as "like with like," that is, the inclusion of grave offerings that in some way mimic, either literally or metaphorically, char­acteristics of the deceased. Additionally, the finds at Santa Rita B demonstrate that the funerary prac­tices described at ceremonial sites were also prac­ticed on a less-grandiose scale at sites other than ceremonial centers and may represent fundamen­tal mortuary behaviors rather than an attempt at simply mimicking what was going on at the major ritual centers. 
Santa Rita B: 
The Site and Mortuary Patterns 

Santa Rita B is located in the southern part of the department of La Libertad in the Viru district, roughly 86 km south of Trujillo (See Figure 1 ). The site sits in the lower part of the middle valley at 4 20 m above mean sea level. It is at the confluence of two small streams, the Huamanzaiia on the south and the Tutumo on the north, at the point where these streams emerge onto a broader alluvial out­wash plain described by locals as the "garganta del valle." Although there is a central architectural area that probably served as an administrative core (Fig­ure 2), there is little monumental architecture and no real artificially constructed huacas such as might be found in ceremonial centers. This site can be referred to as simply a non-huaca site rather than a common or even peripheral one-in the core­periphery sense (Friedmann 1966), which implies marginalization, an untested bias.1 The site mea­sures approximately 2.2 km north/south and at least 
2.0 km east/west, covering approximately 440 ha., about one-sixth the size of Chan Chan. Most sur­face architecture is made of stacked stone or pirca construction, and there are over 400 enclosures constructed in this way along with various water and debris flow control features, including a greater than 2 km long "great wall" referred to as the Muralla Pircada (Brooks et al. 2001). See Figure 2 for the location of this feature. 
Excavations during the field seasons of 2002 and 2004 focused on a small cluster of pirca enclosures in the west central portion of the site designated architectural complex 3 or CA3 (Figure 3). The mortuary remains discussed in this paper come from room 1 (designated Rl), Units 13 and 2 (shaded boxes in Figure 3). 
Osteological Analysis 
The excavation of CA3, RI, Units 2 and 13 in 2002 and 2004 yielded remains of a minimum of seven individuals. These include at least one principal burial and at least four possible sacrifice victims (see Table 1 for a summary of the osteological analysis). Burial 1 had evidence of blunt force trauma to the skull (Figure 4 ). Only scattered post­cranial bones were recovered. This might indicate a secondary burial and subsequent 'jumbling of bones" as described by Verano (1997) at Sipan. Mackey (personal communication 2004) also reported the possible intentional burial of body parts. This skull and other isolated bones may rep­resent the practice of ritual reinterment as described by Millaire (2004 ). There was no stratigraphic evi­dence of looting around this burial; however, the

old subadult, was in a slightly oblique supine posi­tion with the arms extended in an upward position (above where the head would be located) as indi­cated by the position of the humeral heads (see Fig­ure 5). There was evidence of looting near this body, and some bones of the upper body were miss­ing. Excavation of a nearby looter's pit yielded bones that were consistent with the age of this indi­vidual, but could not be definitely determined to be from this skeleton. 
Burial 3, a 10-to-12-year-old subadult, had no evidence of trauma; however, the body position, prone with the hands drawn up under the shoulders as if breaking the fall, indicates sacrifice (Figure 6). Burial 4, an approximately 7-year-old child, is a principal burial based on the body position, the inclusion of a young camelid offering, and the lack of trauma (Figure 7). The body is oriented north to south in an extended supine position. It is the only body described in this paper that was bmied in a prepared grave in the form of a shallow pit dug into the alluvium. The other skeletons simply lay on top of the alluvial layer. Immediately to the right of the child, and oriented in the same North/South direc­tion, is a complete camel id body, also young (<3 months of age) and also in a supine position. The right arm of the child was underneath the body of the camelid. Intentional cranial modification in the form of symmetrical bilobate occipital flattening (Valdivia V. 1988) is evident on the child's skull. There was no evidence of trauma on this child's skeleton although there were lesions consistent with anemia. 
The partial cranium of an adult (SRB-04-18, PS 50) recovered from a disturbed context also demon­strates intentional cranial modification and may indicate a second principal burial nearby. Some of the sacrificial victims may have been intended as

offerings for this individual rather than for the child. Several Spondylus shells found near this possible second principal burial support this hypothesis. It should be noted that other than the shells, scattered potsherds, the camelid, and the sacrifices, there were no other grave offerings associated with these remains. There was no evidence of any kind of a burial shroud. The burial positions and/or evidence of trauma on the skeletons of Burials 1, 2, 3, and 5 suggest that they represent sacrifice victims.

Dating Implications and Mortuary Patterns 
A further implication of the dating of these skele­tons is that their disposal is consistent with the observations made by Donnan ( 1995) on Moche mortuary behavior. In that work, he describes the basic mortuary behavior of the Moche as involv­ing a standardized burial position (extended) with the corpse placed in a shroud and often wrapped with mats, cane tubes, or coffins. Objects are typ­ically placed in the hands and mouth as well. He described this pattern as a continuum ranging from the simplest shroud-covered body in a shallow pito to the elaborate elite tombs with numerous grave goods, including human and animal sacrifices. 

While Donnan ( 1995) states that retainer burials are rare, they have been reported in elite tombs in at least four valleys. They often appear to have been sacrificed and placed in a somewhat careless man­ner with the burials of high-status individuals. This is the general pattern seen at Santa Rita B and sug­gests a continuation of the earlier Moche pattern. The lack of mats and burial shrouds may relate to preservation. The lack of more extensive grave goods, such as complete ceramic pots, does not necessarily mean that the principal burials lacked status within their own community. The manner in which they were treated is still consistent with broader Andean mortuary patterns regarding elite treatment. 
The finds at Santa Rita B demonstrate at least three general patterns. These include child sacri­fice, retainer sacrifice, and the principle referred to as "like with like." These patterns are also seen at other Andean sites during other time periods, and the argument presented here is that the patterns seen at the site of Santa Rita B are virtually pan-

found, but perhaps the most famous was the child the media dubbed "Juanita," or the ice princess, dis­covered by Johan Reinhard on Mount Nevada de Ampato. There were actually three children dis­covered near the summit of this 20, 700-foot ( 6,270 m) peak. Two of the children were aged 8 and 14, and the other was approximately 10-years-old. One was killed by a blow to the head that resulted in intracranial hemorrhage. 
Child sacrifices found at other sites, however, may have been strangled or drugged and left to _succumb to the elements. Among these sacrifice 
victims, ranging in age from 6-years-old to young adulthood, there is a predominance of teenagers with boys and girls being more or less equally rep­resented, and they are occasionally buried in sym­bolically married pairs (Chamberlain and Pearson 2001; Reinhard 1996, 1997; Vreeland 1998). According to McEwan and Van de Guchte ( 1992), the sacrifice ritual required the children to be beau­
tiful and unblemished. This represented the inno­
\cence and health of youth. The ritual, used to bindsacred space and ancestral time, was performed on momentous occasions including the death of an Inka ruler, at the beginning or end of agricultural cycles and during times of crisis (McEwan and Van de Guchte 1992). 

It is possible that the children found on Mount Ampato were sacrificed to stop the emption of a nearby volcano (Reinhard 1998). The site where the children were found can only be reached when the volcano is empting and has melted the ice that normally covers the summit. That was happening when Reinhard himself discovered the site. Vari­ous chroniclers have stated that numerous adoles­cents were sacrificed upon the death of an lnka mler (V reeland 1998). The account of Fray Joseph de Acosta states that upon the death of the last Inka ruler, Huayna Capac, a thousand humans were sac­rificed, including many children (de Herrera 1944). 
It is clear that the lnka were practicing child sac­rifice in two different ways. In the case of the capachucha, the children were sacrificed as perfect spec­imens to the gods. In the case of the death of a ruler, the sacrifices can be interpreted as retainer burials. The Inka also practiced the principle referred to as "like with like." This pattern involves the inclusion of offerings that in some way mimic or parallel the

human with whom they are included. It can also occur as a substitution of an object, human or ani­mal, whose essence in some way mimics or .is metaphorically connected to the deceased. Exam­ples include animal or human sacrifices of the same age as the deceased or that suffered from a similar disease. It can even be the substitution of one human for another. The chronicler Antonio de Herrera ( 1944) noted that when someone of high status was sick and thought to be dying, the lnka often would sacrifice his son in hopes that the gods would be satisfied with the substitution. It could be argued this is an extension of the principle of like with like in that it is the substitution of like for like. A clear case of this principle can be seen in the Inka deposits at Farfan (Carol Mackey, personal com­munication 2004). Mackey and her team excavat­ing at Farfan found an example of "like buried with like" in a burial platform located on the western por ­ti on of the site. 2 Tomb 1 was a complete multiple burial that included three individuals. One was a 
seated adolescent female. Another was a seated older female (over 40-years-old) holding a neonate. The women were wrapped in a textile bundle with their grave goods inside. On top of the bundle Mackey's team recorded four complete, articulated llamas. Two were adults, one was an adolescent and one was a neonate. The camelids are, therefore, quite literally mimicking the ages of the humans with whom they were interred. Mackey (personal communication 2004) also notes that the higher the status of the individual, the more likely a camelid would be included as part of the grave offerings. Additionally, there was evidence for what appeared to be the deliberate burial of body parts of both humans and camelids.

mediate period. There are, however, a few exam­ples that may demonstrate continuity in mortuary practices, and, of course, the addition of the mate­rials from Santa Rita B adds to the knowledge base available for this time period. The "like with like" pattern is seen in the Lambayeque/Sican period burials excavated from the erosional layer covering the Huaca Cao Viejo (HCV) in the El Brujo Com­plex (A.D. 900-1100). In two human burials at Lambayeque period HCV, analyzed by Kent, Ros­ales, and vasquez and published here for the first time, seeds of Scutia spicata were found. In one bur­ial there were 20 drupes (the stony part of the seed) ofthis type, with deliberately drilled holes as if part of a necklace, while in the other burial were 10 drilled drupes. This plant, of the family Rham­naceae, and known commonly as pial or mulchilco, is common on the Peruvian coast and its leaves are used as an astringent for skin lesions and for draw­ing together the sides of open wounds and reduc­ing the swelling associated with various infections (Ramirez et al. 1987). Interestingly, in the two buri­als with this kind of seed, there are porotic lesions on the basal portions of both human and associated camelid crania. According to Altamirano E. (2000), the infection known as Leischmaniasis ( uta) can be passed to animals and humans by the same mos­quito, and leaves lesions on the skull and boils on the skin. Blemishes from uta are treated with Scu­tia leaves in the jungle. The fact that both the humans and associated camelids demonstrate similar cranial lesions, possibly caused by Leischmaniasis as sug­gested by the presence of Scutia, is another mani-. festation of this "like with like" principle. The camelids included as offerings in these graves mim­icked the humans with whom they were interred in two ways. First, they were of similar age (i.e., adult camelid with adult human, subadult camelid with subadult human), and second, they may have been demonstrating similar symptoms of an illness they shared with the deceased human. 
Donnan and Foote (1978) describe another example of "like with like" from the site of Huan­chaco dating to the latter part of the Late Interme­diate period (ca. A.D. 1400). There were 17 child burials all of which were associated with at least one immature llama. The llamas were positioned 
directly over or beside the human skeletons and exhibited flexed positions as did all but four of the human burials. 
Retainer burials and possible child sacrifice are described by Shimada et al. (2004) in the Middle Sican (A.D. 900-1100) layers of several huaca sites including Huaca Loro and Huaca Las Ven­tanas. In the East Tomb of Huaca Loro, they describe a burial chamber with four retainer buri­als and one principal burial. These retainer burials included two subadults, one 12-15 years of age and one around 5 years of age. Shimada et al. (2004) also describe two sacrificed individuals atop Huaca Las Ventanas and three sacrificed individuals at Huaca Rodillona. Thus, the pattern of child sacri­fice and retainer burials is present here as well. The question becomes how far back does this pattern go? 
Moche Mortuary Patterns 

Mortuary pattern research, focused on the Moche culture (ca. A.D. 200-800), has revealed some spec­tacular aspects (Donnan 200 I; Verano 1997). Many of the finds involve ritual human sacrifice. It has been argued (Uceda and Tufinio 2003) that this was an integral part of the sociopolitical environ­ment of the Moche culture, although the nature and scope of our knowledge of this behavior is some­what restricted to that seen at ritual centers, such as Huaca de la Luna and Huaca de! Sol. Analysis of the activities and burials found at ritual centers has demonstrated that activities depicted in the Moche artwork actually took place. One of the better-known artistic renditions is that of the Pre­sentation Theme, a fine line drawing depicting human sacrifice and the drinking of human blood by an individual interpreted as a priest. A rich bur­ial chamber with a principal personage, dubbed "the Lord of Sipan," and several sacrificial victims confirmed the existence of the priest depicted in the artwork and the reality of the activ\ties seen in the Presentation Theme (Alva and Donnan 1993). 
Three tombs excavated at the Huaca Rajada near the village of Sipan yielded high-status individu­als, among them the priest and two other person­ages depicted in the artwork, along with several retainer burials and grave goods of varying types (Donnan 1995; Verano 1997). Relevant to this paper are what Verano ( 1997) described as several appar­ent human sacrifices included with the principal burials.

the burial positions, particularly that of the child, which was seated and flexed (not a typical Moche burial position), indicate possible sacrifice. In fact, he notes that the seven human skeletons surround­ing the principal burial of Tomb I, the tomb of the Lord of Si pan, appear to be likely sacrifice victims. He also noted a pattern of disarticulation and jum­bling of bones of some of the skeletons and inter­preted this as suggesting that those bodies were in a severe state of decomposition when interred. One hypothesis was that they had been previously sac­rificed and later reburied with the Sipan principal burial (Verano 1997). Excavation and reinterment of human remains during the Early Intermediate period was noted by Millaire (2004 ). 
Similar mortuary patterns have also been seen in other Moche high-status tombs at various sites including the Huaca de la Luna in the Moche Val­ley and Huaca Cao Viejo in the Chicama Valley. At the Huaca de la Luna, sacrifice victims have been excavated in recent years at Plazas 3A and 3C. The victims were mainly young, healthy men with injuries consistent with those of warriors (Bourget and Newman 1998; Verano 200la, 200lb). This includes defensive wound fractures that were in the process of healing at the time of death (Verano 200J a, 2001 b ). They appear to fit a pattern of mor­tuary practice for this site in which Tello et al. (2003) argue human offerings on the huaca are offerings to the temple, whereas human offerings found in burials in the urban zone are retainer buri­als. Thus, they distinguish between the sacrifices on the huaca and those in the urban zone with respect to the purposes behind the behavior. This could be argued as similar to the different reasons for child sacrifice among the Inka. In one case, the sacrifices are made to a deity or for the purpose of religious ritual in a nonfunerary context and in the other case, the sacrifices are made in a funerary con­text for the possible purpose of "helping" or accom­panying a deceased individual of high status. This does not appear to be the same pattern as that seen at Huaca Cao Viejo, where human offerings are fre­quently included in the high-status burials on the huaca and are interpreted as retainer burials (Franco 
J. et al. 2003). To date, no areas of mass sacrifice have been found on Huaca Cao Viejo, such as those of Plazas 3A and 3C at Huaca de la Luna. A bur­ial found on the Huaca Cao Viejo in 2004 con­tained a retainer sacrifice at the feet of the principal individual, who was wrapped and accompanied by other grave offerings. The retainer sacrifice was a subadult who was not wrapped and was positioned carelessly3 at the feet of the principal burial. 
Donnan (2003) also describes tombs that appeared to include retainer burials at Dos Cabezas. Tomb I had two individuals; an approximately 15· year-old adolescent female and an 18-to 20-year­old male. The female appears placed in the tomb in a perfunctory manner and has very few grave offerings associated with her skeleton. While there is no mention of evidence of sacrifice, the body position suggests this possibility. Interestingly, the inclusion of the young female with the principal male burial may also indicate a symbolic pairing, a pattern noted among the Inka (Chamberlain and Pearson 2001). Most interesting about the tombs found at Dos Cabezas, however, is that the princi­pal burials all appear to be what has been termed "giants." These consist of three adult males and one teenaged boy who were all extraordinarily tall for the Moche culture. Moche males range between 4 feet 10 inches and 5 feet 6 inches tall (Cordy­Collins and Merbs 2003). The adult males in these tombs, however, were all between 5 feet 9 inches and 6 feet tall. It is possible they suffered from a congenital condition, which would support the hypothesis that they were all related, as suggested by their contemporaneity and the rarity of their condition. Cordy-Collins and Merbs (2003; Don­nan 2001) noted that the individual in Tomb 2 appears to be the most important and suggested the possibility that the other individuals might even have been sacrificed in order to include "like with like." 
Discussion 
This paper has described at least three patterns of mortuary behavior seen at the site of Santa Rita B and at other Andean sites. These patterns include child sacrifice, retainer sacrifice, and "like with like." Additionally, there is evidence of another pat­tern, ritual reinterment of body parts, at Santa Rita B as well as other sites. We hypothesize that these patterns persist through time and may, therefore, reflect fundamental aspects of Andean ritual behav­ior. Table 2 summarizes the sites in this paper, their time periods, and their mortuary patterns. Equally important is the fact that the site of Santa Rita B

represents a non-huaca site. There is no evidence of the type of ceremonial architecture seen at sites such as Huaca de la Luna or Chan Chan, indicat­ing that the sacrifice behavior and mortuary pat­terns seen at ceremonial centers were also practiced at other sites, specifically non-huaca sites. We argue that such behaviors represent the basic elements that the cultures in question deemed necessary, regardless of the site where they occur. While it might be tempting to view the sacrifices at non­huaca sites as poor imitations of the activities seen at ceremonial complexes, it might be more accu­rate to hypothesize that these non-huaca cere­monies are representative of a fundamental Andean complex of ritual behavior, one that persists through time. It also suggests that social status divisions were replicated in all different types of communi­ties within the various cultures. In other words, at many different types of sites, there were people con­sidered elite and those who were considered expendable. 
This brings to light another question. Who were the people of high status? Were they local elites or representatives of the state from another valley? The question is equally valid for the sacrifice victims. None of the sacrifice victims demonstrated cranial modification. Were they local residents chosen (or

volunteers) for sacrifice? Were they from outside of the community-foreigners or enemies? Sutter and Cortez (2005) argue that biodistances based on epigenetic dental traits indicate the sacrifice victims of Huaca de la Luna, while drawn from nearby populations, are not from the local Moche popula­tion. It would be interesting to see if this is also the case for the sacrifices at Santa Rita B. DNA and trace element analyses may help to answer this question in the future. 
The finds at Santa Rita B offer intriguing evi­dence of similarities in mortuary behavior with the practices seen at large ceremonial centers. This study brings to light, however, the need for more data collected from what could be considered non­huaca sites. This is true for all time periods. Fur­thermore, there is a need for more complete contextual analysis of grave lots including more comprehensive botanical and fauna! analyses. Gumerman and colleagues have done some of this for the site of El Brujo, but more work is needed (Gumerman IV 1994). Another question raised by this research is that of the ability to link the archae­ological patterns of mortuary behavior to the broader belief system. We propose that it may be possible if we can indeed identify patterns in the archaeological record that are consistent with other

cultural elements. The "like with like" principle that we identify here may be explained, for example, as being due to sympathetic magic. Alternatively, it may simply be due to perceptions of what is needed in the afterlife. To test this hypothesis, we must approach the question through careful con­textual analysis of all associated cultural material. It is now well accepted that the major personages in the Moche sacrifice scene actually existed and that the rituals did indeed take place (Alva 1990; Donnan 2001; Donnan and Castillo 1994). Until the archaeological record yielded evidence that supported their hypotheses, iconographers had no way to verify their interpretations of the imagery seen in the pottery and textiles. We argue that it may now be time to begin to address the question of why the rituals took place, and what forms they took at different times and places throughout the Andean world. The identification of the broader patterns is but the first step in the process.

Notes 
I. The core-periphery models have become quite popular over the last two decades. However, as Lau (2005:80) has cor­rectly observed, such models have been criticized because 
their basis in capitalist economics may not be appropriate for 
the Andean archaeological record. We agree and stress in this 
paper that understanding the burial patterns of Santa Rita B 
entails an approach that sees human actors as participating 
differentially, but in no way unequally, in long-term and 
widely disseminated mortuary customs. 
2. The Farfan Archaeological Project is a long term inves­tigation of the multi-occupation administrative center of 
. Farfan co directed by Dr. Carol Mackey and Lie. Cesar 
Jauregui. 
3. The term carelessly implies that the body was not placed in a typical Moche burial position (i.e., extended). Rather it was semiflexed in a seated position and leaning to one side suggesting that the body had been thrown at the feet 
of the principal burial.
