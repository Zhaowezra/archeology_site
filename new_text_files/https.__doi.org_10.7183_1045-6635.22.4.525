DEATH AND RELIGION IN THE SOUTHERN MOCHE PERIPHERY: 
FUNERARY PRACTICES AT HUAMBACHO, NEPENA VALLEY, PERU 

David Chicoine 
This article explores religion, death, and mortuary practices in the Southern Moc he (AD. 1-800)periphery as viewed through the excavation of grave contexts at the site of Huambacho, Nepefia Valley, Peru. Moche influence reached Nepefia as is vis­ible in the construction of religious buildings at the site of Pafiamarca and the presence of Moc he style ceramics at several sites. ln 2003 and 2004, scientific excavations at Huambacho, an Early Horizon center mainly built and occupied during !he first millennium B.C., yielded a series of intrusive graves containing Gallinazo, Virzi, and Moche style objects. This con­tribution contextualize.1· these discoveries and focuses on the analysis of funerary patterns of burial, osteological evidence, and symbolic meanings with the objective of understanding local funerary practices and Moc he religious and cultural expres­sions. Symbolic references to coast-highland interactions, inversions in body positioning, and possible human sacrifices bring insights into the complex and potentially tense sociohistorical cirmcumstances in Nepefia during the Moche phase.

of Ancash, the presence of the southernmost cere­monial center with Moche monumental art and architecture suggests a strong religious influence. Yet little is known of local funerary behaviors dur­ing the Moche phase (Proulx 1982:85). 
Recent excavations at Huambacho, an Early Horizon elite center with multiple reoccupations, have yielded a series of intact grave contexts that provides data on local funerary practices during the Moche period. The corpus presented here includes graves with Gallinazo, Vini, and Moche style grave goods. Analyses of burial contexts, funerary sym­bolism, and osteological remains bring insights into the relationships between Gallinazo, Vini, and Moche phenomena, as well as atypical funerary practices and eventual violent death including tor­ture and strangulation. While some graves contain Moche style grave goods, they also display signif­icant differences that underscore the complexity of religious networks and political organization in the southern part of the Moche world. This article explores the symbolic meanings of local practices and suggests that archaeologists might have overemphasized the homogeneity ofMoche funer­ary behaviors. 
Background 
Funerary practices are one of the most salient expressions of the belief in the non-material aspects of human existence. They are rites of pas­sage that materialize a series of complex relation­ships between funerary actors, including the corpse of the deceased, the soul and the mourners (van Gennep 1965). These actions have the objectives of separating the deceased from the community, treating its corpse and soul so as to avoid poten­tial danger for the collectivity, and reestablishing the social persona of the deceased, often in the form of an ancestor, into collective memory (Bloch and Parry 1982). 
Archaeologists studying death have invested special efforts in trying to unravel the social sig­nificance of funerary practices. One approach has been to consider such practices as reflections of the social organization of a given community, arguing that the variability in grave contexts is a function of the complexity of social relations and hierarchies (Binford 1971; Saxe 1970). Studies of the dynam­ics responsible for mortuary variability and degrees of energy expenditure have been particularly use­ful in understanding the relationships between social ranking and funerary treatment (O 'Shea 1984; Tainter 1978). More recently, scholars have suggested that graves are venues for negotiation and affirmation of social structures. Emphasizing more symbolic and contextual approaches, archaeolo­gists have focused on how grave contexts are his­torically constituted as important social strategies 
(Cannon 1989; DeMarrais 2004; DeMarrais et al. 1996; Pader 1982). From that standpoint, funerary archaeology aims at unraveling the meanings and messages coded into grave contexts (Buikstra 1995:32). Bodies themselves have the potential to become symbolic arenas and spectacles open to manipulation as exemplified in post-and peri­mortem alterations such as torture, delayed burial, grave re-entry and dismemberment (Hill 2005; Mil­laire 2004; Verano 1998). 
In Peru, the discovery in the late 1980s of elab­orate royal burials at the site of Sipan in the Lam­bayeque Valley (Alva 1988) has highlighted the rich symbolic meaning embedded in Moche grave con­texts. Beyond "vertical" differences associated with hierarchical ranking and social inequalities, schol­ars have highlighted a wide range of "horizontal" distinctions within Moche funerary treatment and the significance of this heterogeneity for under­standing status diversity, group membership, and belief systems (Castillo and Rengifo 2008; Chapde­laine et al. 2009; Donnan 2007). Hence, the more symbolic aspects of grave contexts and their asso­ciated variability hold potential to bridge the gap between regional patterns and local funerary prac­tices. Considering that social roles and identities are fluid and open to manipulation, the expression of institutionalized religious behaviors may vary (Parker Pearson 1999:33). 
Moche funerary behaviors are best understood as the outcomes of a rich coastal tradition, but their high degree of elaboration and complexity, unseen before the Early Intermediate Period (Millaire 2002: 168), suggest that funerary practices and reli­gion were closely related to the ways polities extended their membership and, under certain cir­cumstances, became unified (Bawden 2004:125; Donnan 2010:47; Shimada 2010:71). In this per­spective, the adoption of, adaptation of and/or resis­tance to the dominant religious ideology -as materialized in mortuary patterns -must have been

at the core of inter-community interactions and rit­ual identities. 
One way to assess the diversity with which local groups along the North Coast engaged with Moc he religious ideas is to investigate their conception of death and burial treatment: from the preparation and encasing of the corpse to the elaboration and loca­tion of funerary chambers, and the quantity and quality of grave goods (Donnan 1995; Millaire 2002). Funerary variability has to be understood in terms of scale, group membership, and status diver­sity (Millaire 2002: 166). 
Moche deceased were typically buried under­ground1,in a fully extended position2, on their back, with the hands alongside the body or placed on the pelvis. This position is believed to be symbolically associated with concepts of rest and sleep (Rowe 1995:27). Feet are usually found side-by-side, although ankles can be crossed and/or tied together. Corpses were consistently wrapped in textile shrouds and sometimes placed inside a coffin. Some body parts were at times offered special treat­ments. The face could be covered with red pigments and the hair braided or bundled (Donnan 1995:123). 
Burials were located in different contexts includ­ing subfloor pits in residences, cemeteries, and non­residential buildings. Bodies were placed inside chambers that ranged from simple pits to elaborate adobe rooms. The location of the graves could be marked with special objects, such as wooden posts or ceramic vessels, in order to facilitate reopening. More elaborate graves tend to be located inside or near monumental buildings, while less elaborate contexts are typically found outside ceremonial structures, in cemeteries or residential architecture in the periphery of important buildings or centers (Donnan 1995:142, 153; Millaire 2002:169). 
The Moc he buried their dead according to their status and roles during their lifetime and, as such, tools, special insignias and other markers can be used to infer a deceased's biography (e.g., the Priestesses of San Jose de Moro, [Donnan and Castillo 1992; see also Castillo and Rengifo 2008]). For instance, women, who are believed to have been typically involved in spinning and weaving activities, are often buried with spindle-whorls and bundles of yarn (Donnan 1995:150). In contrast, men are often buried with weapons or fishing implements associated with their activities. Gen­der-oriented mortuary practices are not unique to the Moc he and similar patterns have been observed in pre-Moche times (Makowski 2002:115). 
On a more general note, graves usually contain ceramic vessels and gourd containers that were often buried with food and drink. Most burials contained fewer than five ceramic vessels, and those were often paired, materializing concepts of duality (Don­nan 1995: 143). Other common grave goods include metal objects, usually placed in the mouth, the hands, and sometimes beneath the feet, and plant, remains, including maize (Gumerman 1994). 
Recent research has shed new light on the dynamism of Moche funerary practices, in partic­ular delayed burials, grave re-entry, and the manip­ulation of human remains (Hill 2003; Millaire 2004; Verano 1998, 2003). Articulation patterns and insect pupae indicate that some corpses were held for long periods of time before being buried (Nelson 1998; Verano 1997a, 2001), and several graves were reopened and tampered with, indicat­ing that powerful symbolic meanings were attrib­uted to ancestral remains (Hecker and Hecker 1992; Millaire 2004). 
Death rituals, in particular torture, display and sacrifice, were at the core ofMoche religious beliefs (Bourget 2001, 2006). For instance, Hill (2003, 2005) suggests that the bodies of war captives were reassigned into the more symbolically useful cat­egory of prisoners in order to feed the institutional demand for public displays of violence, including sacrifice. Prisoners became arenas for spectacle while body parts eventually became relics open to manipulation. 
The widespread distribution of Moc he religious tenets was linked to their potency, the success of their promoters, and the regional need for ritual insignia and paraphernalia (Bawden 2004: 124; Donnan 2010:68-69). Indeed, funerary practices and rituals of sacrifice might have well served to bridge the gap at the elite level between various communities. 
The Moche culture developed between A.D. 1­800 and current evidence suggests the parallel development of several polities based in the Piura, Lambayeque, Jequetepeque and Chicama-Moche to the south (Castillo and Quilter 2010). This new emphasis on stylistic diversity points towards the specificities of the cultural history of each region and the impossibility to apply a single mode of

development for the Moche world (Shimada 2010). For the Southern Moche world, extending from Chicama in the north to Nepefia in the south, peer polities probably negotiated powers and territories, battled among each other and/or forged alliances with groups in different valleys. Members of these polities produced different styles of fine ceramic wares including Moche painted and sculpted pots in the Chicama and Moche valleys, and Vini Neg­ative and Huancaco vessels in the Viru Valley (Bourget 2003, 2010; Millaire 2009, 2010). Mean­while, Gallinazo Modeled and Gallinazo Incised ceramics are now seen as part of a long-standing tradition of utilitarian and domestic wares wide­spread along the north coast (Donnan 2009:30). 
At its peak, Southern Moche influence encom­passed several regions, including the Chicama, Moche, Viru, Santa, Nepefia, and possibly Casma and Huarmey valleys (Donnan 2010:60-66; Makowski 2010; Pozorski and Pozorski 1996). The mechanisms involved in the coalescence of widely distributed communities are still debated and they are likely linked to unique sets of local historical circumstances. Recent research in Santa, for instance, suggests two major waves ofMoche influ­ence starting during the fourth century A.D. and lasting probably 300 years (Chapdelaine et al. 2005). Stylistically, the Moche presence in Santa is associated with Middle Moche Phases 3 and 43 ceramics, and constructions at the sites of El Castillo and Guadalupito, respectively (Chapde­laine 2010). lt is assumed that the spread ofMoche styles and materials through local settlements and cemeteries materialized the engagement of local groups with Moche religion, but the integration of Moche influence along the north coast was "not a smooth linear progression or one in which the Moche centered at the site of Moche single-hand­edly dictated all major decisions [... ] and the process involved many negotiations, conquests, recon­quests, and rapprochements between the Moche and local populations" (Shimada 2010:72-73). 
In Nepefia, the Moche influence is associated with the construction of the southernmost Moche monumental site at Pafiamarca (Schaedel 1951). Valley wide surface surveys, meanwhile, have revealed the existence of 37 Moche sites (Proulx 1982:83), mostly cemeteries located in the vicin­ity of Pafiamarca. Stylistic evidence from surface ceramics appears to date the Moche presence to the Middle period and the limited distribution of Moc he materials has been used to argue for a short­lived and tenuous occupation limited to the mid­dle and lower sections of the valley (Proulx 1982:83). Meanwhile, the upper valley is believed to have been the realm of groups with close con­tacts with the highlands, possibly with Recuay­related populations. In the lower valley, recent investigations at Huambacho, some 5 km down­stream from Pafiamarca, have yielded the first evi­dence from excavated contexts of a Moche presence outside the monumental complex. Con­sidering that social identities and roles are blurred through practice and open to manipulation, the remainder of this article investigates patterns of Moche religion and funerary practices from the perspective of a small cemetery at Huambacho. 
Investigations at Huambacho 
Huambacho is a multicomponent site of the lower Nepefia Valley situated 8 km from the shoreline and 65 m asl (Figure 2). The site was first reported by Soriano (1941) and revisited by Proulx (1968: 135­137) during his systematic survey of the valley in the 1960s and 1970s. After Soriano, Proulx iden­tified Chimu (ca. AD. 1000-1470) materials, but also suggested an earlier Moche occupation (Proulx 1982: 84). Later work indicates that the initial occu­pation ofHuambacho dates back to the Early Hori­zon (Chicoine 2006), but excavations by the Proyecto Huambacho (2003-2004) allowed the dis­covery of several Moche graves. 
Excavation results and ten radiocarbon dates indicate that most structures were built and used between 800 and 200 cal B.C. (2u) (see Chicoine 2010). At that time, Huambacho was organized around two compounds of wall-enclosures. Field­work focused on the Main Compound and revealed a complex spatial organization dominated by large sunken plazas and complexes of raised platforms (Figure 3). Following the Early Horizon the site witnessed a series of reoccupations by groups pro­ducing Gallinazo Modeled and Gallinazo Incised, Vini Negative, Moche painted and molded, Casma press-molded and Casma incised, and Chimu blackware ceramics. These reoccupations are mainly represented by intrusive grave contexts. 
The Moche presence is mainly documented by the discovery of several graves at Huaca-A, a com-

plex of raised platforms in the northern portion of the Main Compound. Additional evidence for a Moche occupation includes objects found at the surface of looted areas. More than 400 pottery frag­ments came from the clearing of a looter's pit in the North Sector. Moche style ceramics include various forms such as face necked jars, sculpted lateral-handle bottles, and stirrup-spout bottles. The surface ceramics were decorated using three­dimensional techniques complemented by red and white painting, a pattern consistent with the Moche artifacts found in undisturbed grave contexts. A broken jar sculpted in the shape of a toad, very sim­ilar to the one from Grave 11 (see below), was dis­covered (Figure 4A). The toad is represented with similar morphological attributes (e.g., parotid glands), as well as with a growing maize plant on its body. A small necked jar sculpted in the shape of a human figure with supernatural phytomorphic attributes was also collected. The figure is depicted with six com cobs placed on both sides of the body and in the back (Figure 4B). The representation emphasizes fertility and closely resembles similar vessels found to the north on which the main Moche ritual actor, the degollador or throat slaughterer, is associated with maize (Benson 1972:29, Figure 2.4) (Figure A of the Sacrifice Ceremony; see Don­nan 1975). Other anthropomorphic vessels were found at Huambacho (Figure 4C, D, E). 
Non-ceramic grave goods from this area include a wooden staff in the shape of a fist (Figure 4F), several copper objects, Spondylus shell beads, and bone adornments. The fist-shaped scepter is sym­bolically associated with death and authority. It has been suggested that the "half-fist gesture" (Don­nan 1978: 151), which replicates the stepped appearance of sacred mountains and temples, was used among Moche religious elites, perhaps dur­ing special rituals including human sacrifices (Bourget 2006: 123). Similar fist-shaped bone and wooden objects have been documented at Moche sites (Benson 1972: 110, Figure 5.14). Meanwhile, wooden scepters are known to have been found in higher status burials, notably at Huaca de la Cruz in Vini (Strong and Evans 1952). 
The reuse of the Main Compound for the dis­posal of the dead attests to the high symbolic value that the site retained after its abandonment, a wide-

Funerary Contexts at Huambacho 
Excavations at Huambacho allowed the recovery of skeletal remains associated with at least 23 indi­viduals in contexts numbered Grave I to 17 (Fig­ure 3). When multiple skeletons were discovered inside a burial context, a different number was given to each individual (e.g., Grave 11, Individ­ual I) (See Table 1). The grave contexts consist of simple pits excavated directly through Early Hori­zon contexts. They were found at a depth ranging between 30 and175 cm. Data relevant to burial pro­cedures and contexts were recorded in situ while a more detailed analysis of the skeletal remains was realized in laboratory facilities in Casma and Nepefia (Ancash, Peru)4• The objectives of the funerary and osteological analyses were to acquire biographical information about the life of buried individuals and reconstruct funerary events. 
The graves are represented by 10 infants and 13 adults. For the adults, sex could be identified with confidence for two females and four males. Of the total human remains excavated, ten individuals are associated with the Moche phase occupation based on the presence of Moche style grave goods and the consistent placement of the body in a north­south face-down position. Other graves are inter­preted as pre-Moche (Grave 6, 7), post-Moche (Grave 2, 3) or unidentified (Grave 1, 17). Offer­ing contexts were also excavated including sacri­ficed camelids (Grave 4) and dedicatory vessels with foods, and a Vini Negative vessel (Grave 8), further attesting to the sacred importance of the bur­ial ground.

burials with Moche style artifacts (Graves 10, 11 and lS). The cluttered aspect of the burials indi­cates a lack of centralized coordination at Huaca­A, and the simplicity of the pits, the absence of remains of a coffin (e.g., reeds)5, the location away from residential areas, as well as the quality and quantity of grave goods, all suggest an oppor­tunistic cemetery for lower and middle class local folks. Overall, the Huambacho graves compare favorably to lower status burials from Pacatnamu and Huacas de Moche to the north (Chapdelaine 2004; Donnan and McClelland 1997; Tello et al. 2003). 
Graves exhibit similar general patterns and lit­tle variation with respect to basic concepts of funer­ary treatment. Corpses were laid out in an extended position with the head to the southwest, pointing towards the Pacific Ocean. This orientation fol­lows the layout of Early Horizon structures ( N4 I 0E). The extended position of the Moc he phase graves contrast with the contexts of Gallinazo and Vim material (Grave 6 and 7) where bodies were buried in a flexed position. 
Grave 6, excavated in the south portion of the Huaca-A, contained the remains of a 173 cm tall adult female over SO years old6. The woman, buried SO cm below the surface (66.9S m asl), had been placed in a flexed position on her side, with her arms to her face and her head tilted right and tipped forward (Figure SA). The body was wrapped in a plain weave cotton shroud and accompanied by several grave goods. Six vessels surrounded the body, which was laid on a seventh vessel in the form of a disc/plate. Maize cobs were discovered from one of the vessels, which pro­vided a radiocarbon (AMS) date of 1960 ± 40 
B.P. (cal SO B.C.-A.D. 130 (2a); BETA-197084; maize; 013 = -10.7). Five gourd containers were also placed inside the grave, along with four spin­dle-whorls made of copper (n = 1), ceramic (n = 2), and stone (n = I). Copper sheets in the fore­head ( mesofrontal section of the cranium) and the mouth, as well as copper pendant were also recov­ered. The cranium was artificially deformed in a fronto-occipital fashion. 
The vessels are particularly interesting. A large, spherical body, necked jar with a modeled zoomor­phic applique suggests some Gallinazo Modeled stylistic affiliations (Figure SB) 7. Grave goods also included an ovoid shape bowl (Figure SC) and a boat-shaped necked jar (Figure SD). The bowl, fired in a reducing atmosphere, was highly polished and reminiscent of some Early Horizon forms. The grave also contains more utilitarian wares includ­ing three cooking jars (Figure SE, F, G), one of which was a broken tripod jar with lateral strap han­dle showing carbonized residues (Figure SE). The disc/plate on which the person was placed (Figure SH), meanwhile, is reminiscent of the tools used by Andean potters (Ramon 2011 : 163). 
To the south of Grave 6 at the same depth, Grave 7 contained the looted remains (feet and pelvis) of an adult female of undetermined age and stature buried in a flexed position. The corpse was accom­panied by a double-body whistle jar with Vim Neg­ative decoration (resist painting) (Figure 6A). Other grave goods included a wooden spindle and a gourd container. The dating of Grave 7 is uncertain, but the discovery of an offering context (Grave 8) con­taining a similar Vim Negative whistle jar (Figure 6B) elsewhere at Huaca-A has yielded a radiocar­bon date of 18SO ± 60 B.P. (cal A.D. 20-340 (2a); BETA-19708S; maize; 013= -11.6). Several surface sherds in Vim Negative, but also Gallinazo Mod­eled and Gallinazo Incised, have been found at Huambacho. 
Elsewhere in Nepefia, Vim and Gallinazo influ­ences have been identified in the vicinity of Pafia­marca in the middle valley, most notably at Tres Marias (PV3 l-73) some S km to the north ofHuam­bacho. This site is composed of two platform mounds built with cane-marked adobes, as well as an adjacent cemetery area (Gambini 1983-84: 124). More research will be needed to understand the relationship between Gallinazo, Vim, and Moche components in Nepefia, but major stylistic and funerary differences can be observed. More specif­ically, Gallinazo and Vim deceased are placed in a flexed position while Moche ones are consistently extended and placed on their stomach. Currently chronology remains underdeveloped to allow a clear understanding. 
The radiocarbon assays reported above place the Gallinazo and Vim styles at Huambacho between SO B.C. and A.D. 340 (cal 2a), but no dates are available for the Moche component. In Santa to the north, Chapdelaine (2010:260) places the Moche phase between A.D. 300 and 700, which he asso­ciates with the stylistic phases 3 and 4. Based on the traditional hegemonic model according to

which Early Moche styles (phases 1 and 2) origi­nate in the Moche-Chicama core and subsequently spread southward in association with the expansion of the Southern Moche state, the Moche influence in Nepefia should be assumed after AD. 300. This assertion awaits a more thorough revision of the validity of that stylistic sequence and the nature of Early Moche phenomenon in Nepefia. It would suggest, however, that stylistic and funerary dif­ferences resulted from the arrival of Moche influ­ences in the region. Conversely, Gallinazo, Vin1 and Moche distinctive funerary behaviors could have well materialized ethnic, social and/or religious 
differences at a time of particular political frag­mentation. 

At Huambacho, three undisturbed grave con­texts have yielded Moche style artifacts (Grave 10, 11 and 15). Grave 10 was arranged as a simple pit dug some 50 cm deep into the Early Horizon con­struction fill at an elevation of 66.90 m as!. It con­tained the skeletal remains of a 176 cm tall adult male probably aged between 25 and 30 years (lndi­vidual 1). The preservation of the corpse was excel­lent and sections of the body were still covered with soft membranes, most notably the hands and feet, which were naturally mummified (Figure 7A). 
Individual 1 had been wrapped in a plain weave cotton shroud and placed in an extended position (Figure 7B), face down, with his head to the south­west. The left hand was placed along the body while the right hand was covering the pelvis under­neath the body. The deceased was wearing a cylin­drical headdress made of plant fibers. The headdress consists of a band of plant fibers twined using an open cross-warp technique8. The main body of the hat is arranged as a cylinder of four bast rims tied together to the twined body with cot­ton yarns. The headdress has a diameter of 26.7 cm at the base and displays a circular opening of 

11.5 cm beneath which hair was found bundled up (Figure 7C). The headdress from Grave 10 is rem­iniscent of similarly shaped garments made of gilded copper from Dos Cabezas (see Donnan 2007: 134, Figure 5.137).

Individual 1 was buried with grave goods, but no ceramic vessels. Near the head, on the right side, a textile bag was found wrapped in a plain weave cotton cloth (Figure 8A). Coca leaves (Erythroxy­lum coca) were found inside the bag along with a small bone spatula made of a camelid metatarsal (Figure 8B). The bag was decorated with brown, beige, red, and black designs forming steps, frets, and concentric crosses. The bag is composed of four pieces: a bottom, an interior wall, a superimposed exterior wall bearing decoration, and a handle stitched to both walls. The exterior presents the most complex techniques and designs. Warp yams are made of beige cotton, while the weft yarns are made of different materials and colors: brown came lid fibers, beige cotton, and black human hair. Red fibers are only found on the handle. 
The bag was apparently used to carry coca leaves, perhaps for ritual purposes. Similar bags are depicted in Moche iconography in a scene known as the "Coca Ceremony" (Figure 8C) (Benson 1972:61, Figures 3.17-3.18; Donnan and McClelland 
1999:84). As seen in the iconography, coca-chew­ing rituals involve the use of bags, probably to carry coca leaves, as well as special spatulas or applica­tors used to consume lime (calcium hydroxide), a vital agent in the release of coca alkaloids (Bawden 1996:90, 334). The lime is stored in small hand size containers or caleros. Figure 8C illustrates how the bags are carried by the ritual consumers and the way spatulas are brought to the mouth and used to ingest lime. In this scene, it is significant that the bag held by the ritual actor on the right is decorated with designs very similar to those from Grave 10.

In the Andes, coca represents an important com­modity and it is essential to labor and other phys­ical endeavors as it reduces fatigue (Allen 1988). In relation to its use by farmers, it has been sug­gested that the Moche saw a deep symbolic con­nection between coca and maize (Bawden 1996:90), and it is possible that agrarian rituals involved the chewing of coca. It has also been sug­gested that coca was used by warriors in order to boost courage prior to battle (Benson 1972:59). At the Moche site of Dos Cabezas in Jequetepeque, Donnan (2007: 30-31) has reported the presence of fine, sculpted, necked jars depicting individuals chewing coca and absorbing lime. At Huaca de la Luna in Moche, Uceda et al. (1994) have reported graves of high-ranking males with copper caleros in their hands. 
Coca typically grows in mid-valley zones, known as yungas, located on the western slopes of the Andes between approximately 500 and 2,300 m as! (Onuki 1985:340). In Nepefia, coca would have been cultivated in the upper valley, upstream from the Moro area. Interestingly, the Coca Cere­mony scene incorporates elements of coast-high­lands interactions. Specifically, the presence of a feline headdress and a weapon bundle that includes a star-shaped mace compare favorably with depic­tions of highland-based groups, especially Recuay (Lau 2004:167 ,Figure 3). The evidence from Grave 10 attests to some form of contact with groups based in the upper valley where coca was grown. Almost 30 years ago, Proulx ( 1982) suggested that the Nepefia Valley was divided into upper and lower valley territories occupied by the Recuay and Moche, respectively. The access and control of coca production and circulation would have played a major role in inter-community interactions on the north coast and Grave 10 points toward the poten­tial diversity and extent of the geographical con­nections of local Huambacho. 
West of Grave 10, some 40 cm deeper (66.25 m asl), Grave 11 consists of the compound disposal of three individuals: two adults (Individual 1 and 3) and an infant (Individual 2) (Figure 9A). Indi­vidual 1, a 17 4 cm tall male aged between 25 and 30 years at the time of his death, was buried in an
