ThisbookisanEnglishtranslationofthe author’sbook in Spanish, titled La saldela tierra: Etnoarqueología de la producción salinera en el occidente de Méx­ico and published in Mexico in 2003. The English version is an updated edition, so new information is included. The book is divided into six chapters and includes a section of references. The chapters include an introduction with a discussion of the importance of salt for prehispanic western Mexico, aregionwith relevant sitesthathas beenoverlooked by researchers. The author also offers a discussion of the role of salt in human life and its research importance. 
Chapter2containsadiscussionof salt production around the world, focusing speci.cally on various Mexican examples, such as the Basin of Mexico, Oaxaca, Puebla,andtheMayaarea.This chapteroffers ethnoarchaeologicalexamplesof salt productioninthe BasinofMexico. Thethird chapterdiscussesthe gen­eral geographic and cultural background of western Mexico, providing a good synthesis of the region’s occupation fromthe .rst inhabitantsto modern times. Iwas surprisedthattheworkof ChristopherBeekman, an archaeologistwhohasdone .eldworkinthelasttwo decadesin theregion,was not cited(e.g., Beekman, Journal of Archaeological Research 18(1):41–109; BeekmaninNicholsand Pool,eds., OxfordHandbook of Mesoamerican Archaeology). 
The fourth chapter is an excellent data set on the production of salt in the Tarascan area and its hinterland.Itoffers informationonsaltproductionin prehispanic times and ethnographic examples from Lake Cuitzeo Basin, the Michoacán coast, Jalisco, Colima, Nayarit, andGuerrero.The author’s research has documentedtwomainmethodsof salt production: sal cocida (boilingbrineto producecrystallized salt) and sal solar (evaporationofbrinein pans underthe sun).The remainsleftbysaltproductionwhen boiling brine in clay vessels are impressive. These vessels were made to be broken, leaving a large amount of material remains on the ground and providing clues about the specialization of particular sites. Arroyo (Anales de la Academia de Geografía e Historia de Guatemala 74:183–212) andMcKillop(Salt: White Gold of the Ancient Maya, 2002) have documented similartechniquesfor thePaci.c coastofGuatemala as early as the Early Preclassic and for the coast of Belizein theClassicperiod. 
This chapteralsoincludesdescriptionsof ancient and modern salt-making techniques, and discussion of the importance of salt as an exchange product. The author outlines three levels of salt production in ancientMichoacán:(1) places whereenough salt was produced and the surplus was exported, (2) others that produced only enough for consumption, and(3) those where production wasinsuf.cient for local needs and had to be supplemented with salt imported fromother areasof Michoacán.Anextensive inventoryof ethnographicexamples fromthroughout Michoacán arepresented, illustratingwhatthe author callsa “salt-making landscape” becauseof theprints and remains left by this activity on the ground. The ethnographic cases studied by Williams have shed light on the capability of prehispanic and colonial networks involved in the production and exchange of salt in Michoacán, as well as their salt-making techniques. 
Theauthor’s careful documentationof ancient salt making practices helps to explain features found in the archaeological record elsewhere. In particular, it called my attention to the round features made of potteryatthesitesofCerritosColoradoandLa Motita, where he cites the .nding of cylindrical pits with a covering wall made of sherds. During a Vanderbilt University project directed by Arthur A. Demarest, we found similar examples at the Early Preclassic site of El Carmen in El Salvador, over 1,500 km southofMichoacán.His observationsof ethnographic andethnohistorical documentation of saltproduction indicate diverse methodologies for salt exploitation. This chapter documents specializationintheextrac­tion,evaporation, processing, anddistributionof salt. Such specialized activity impacted the development of the Tarascan Empire, as seen in the following

Chapter5examinesde roleof saltintheexpansion of the Tarascan Empire. The author uses archae­ological, ethnohistorical, and ethnographic data to document the role of salt and other goods in trade and tribute.More than salt as anindividual product, it was the trade network controlled by the Tarascan Empire that contributedtoitsexpansion. This included the control of goods such as obsidian, metals, and turquoise, which were part of the strategic structure of thestate.Williamsoffers an estimate of saltcon­sumption in the core area of the Tarascan territory, demonstrating the need to import this product from remote areas. He argues that controlling this trade was fundamental for the expansion of the empire, more likely in combination with other goods. The last chapter offers conclusions and brie.y refers to comparative examples in China, Africa, and other areas in Mesoamerica. 
The subject of this book is interdisciplinary, integrating archaeological data, ethnographic work, andethnohistorical sources.Saltisa productofgreat importanceinancient times,asitwas usedto preserve foods to last for some time. Salt is found in speci.c locations andis notavailable everywhere, makingit an important tradeproductthroughout Mesoamerica.

Since the discovery of rich graves at Sipán on the north coast ofPeru inthe 1980s,the Moche(A.D. 100–800) have been the subject of ever-increasing attention. Although thisfascinatingstate societydevel­oped innovative forms of urban settlements, irriga­tion technologies,and political economies,itis most famousforits vibrantartistictradition,vividnarrative iconographies,and spectacularformsof ritual killing. SteveBourget’slatest book pursues this elite-centered tradition, building on the author’s long-term study of mortuary contexts and provocative re.ections on Moche artworks. 
Althoughits titlemayseemfamiliar,thisisalong­awaited book that weaves together many previously unpublished claims and arguments. Focusing on the central role of human sacri.ce in Moche religion and its close relation to warfare and the capture of prisoners, it offers a detailed account of Bourget’s .eldwork at Huaca de la Luna in the mid-1990s combinedwitha skillful analysisof Mocheimagery. Theiconographicinquiry zeroesinonthemesrelated to human sacri.ce and death as well as animals and plants that, according to Bourget, are indicative of El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) conditions. Expanding on arguments .rstdevelopedinhis Ph.D. dissertation on Moche “sacred bestiary and magical .ora,” Bourget views the north coast environment as a dynamic element in shaping sacred geographies, cosmologies,and rituals.He audaciously suggeststhat “ENSO provided an important template for Moche ideology and that the totality of the iconographical representations relating to the sea and most of those relatingtothe land couldbedirectly associated with El Niñoevents”(p. 196).Buildingona chronological (re)assessmentofkey scenes associated with Moche liturgical practices,the book concludesby offeringa working modelfor theevolutionofMoche rulership. 
Methodologically, the presentation bridges art history,semiotics, mortuaryarchaeology,zoology,and botany. Bourget’sdemonstration approaches animals and plants depicted in Moche iconography from anatomical, biological, and ethological standpoints. Borrowing from one of Isaac Newton’s famous quotes,Bourgetentersintodialogue with the “giants” of Moche scholarship, especially Christopher Donnan.As such,the bookis decidedlytailoredfor a specialized audience, with most ofits bibliography drawn fromMoche studies.Itis wellillustrated,and summary tables help the reader follow Bourget’s masterfulbut oftencircuitous tourde force.A useful index aids navigation, but a glossary would have helped non-Andeanist readers. 
After providing a review of relevant literature on north coastlandscape(chapter1),Bourgetsummarizes Moche political organization, ritual life, and asso­ciated imageries(chapter2). Theremainder ofthe book can be dividedintothree sections:(1) reporting excavation resultsat Plaza3AandPlatformII(Huaca dela Luna)(chapters 3–4);(2)analyzingiconographic evidence forENSOand its relationtosacri.cialprac­tices,death, diseases (chapter 5),and thededicatory offering of children(chapter6); and(3) synthesizing
