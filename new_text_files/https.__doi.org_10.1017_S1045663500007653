A NE W APPROXIMATION

Pottery in contexts that predate the entrance of Arawak societies to the Antilles ( 500 B. C.) by at least one millennium demand a reassessment of the introduction of this technology to the islands. We summarize the available evidence of what we term the Pre-Arawak Pottery horizan and address the social implications of the introduction of such technology to the insular Caribbean, based on the role of pots as tools. We show that this early pottery is more widespread than originally thought, extending from Cuba to Hispanola and perhaps to Puerto Rico and the Lesser Antilles as well. We argue that the paucity of early ceramic contexts discovered thus far could have resulted from the consideration of pottery as intrusive in Pre­Arawak contexts and because of its technological and stylistic overlap with wares associated to the Ostionoid series (A.D. 600-1500) of the Greater Antilles. Based on this evidence, we conclude by suggesting that some of the post-Saladoid man­ifestations that have been identified in the islands could have resulted from a multifocal development of these pre-Arawak cultures rather than simply from the divergent evolution of Salado id societies as has been argued thus far. 
El liallazgo de cerdmica en contextos anteriores a la entrada de sociedades Arahuacas a las Anti/las (500 a.C.) demanda la revision de su introducci6n en las is las. Presentamos la evidencia disponible para lo que denominamos el horizante Ceramista Pre-Arahuaco y analizamos las implicaciones sociales que tuvo esta tecnolog{a en dichas sociedades. Demostramos que la presencia de esta cerdmica temprana es de mayor amplitud espacial que la que se hab{a pensado originalmente, extendien­dose desde Cuba hasta la Espanola y, quizds tambien, hasta Puerto Rico y las Anti/las Menores. Argumentamos que una de lasposibles razones par la cual se han identificado tan pocos contextos cerdmicos tempranos antillanos ha sido el cardcter intrusivo que se le ha sido asignado a su presencia en dep6sitos Pre-A rahuacos;.as{ como a la superposici6n tecnol6gica y esti/(stica que estos complejos tienen con los asociados a la serie Ostioniode (600-1500 d.C.) de las Antillas Mayores. Sabre la base de tales similitudes, proponemos que algunas de las manifestaciones post-Saladoides que han sido identificadas en las islas pudieron haber resultado de un desarrollo multifocal en estas sociedades pre-Arahuacas en vez de la simple divergen­cia evo/utiva de sociedades Saladoides como ha sido argumentado hasta el momento.

LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 19, No. 1, 2008 
by the discovery of a cultural manifestation in Puerto Rico characterized by the presence of unpainted pottery decorated with zone-incised crosshatched designs, named the Huecoide by Chanlatte and Narganes (1980). Upon the discov­ery of this manifestation, the debate centered on whether it represented an earlier migration of pottery-making horticulturalists (Chanlatte and Narganes 1980; Rodriguez Ramos 2001) or a sub­culture within the Saladoid (Roe 1985; Rouse 1992; Siegel1992). Irrespective of the particular positions within this debate, both sides agreed that these migrating societies introduced pottery and agri­culture to the islands, leading either to the devel­opment (Chanlatte and Narganes 1980) or displacement (Rouse 1992) of the previous Archaic groups that inhabited the Antilles who were pri­marily characterized by "the absence of agriculture and pottery" (Alegria 1965:246). 
While these debates were taking place in Puerto Rico and the Lesser Antilles, in Cuba and the Dominican Republic archaeologists were finding ceramics that did not seem to correspond to either of the aforementioned cultural complexes. Fur­thermore, the pottery that was being recovered was rather coarse, thus contrasting with the fine-pasted Huecoid and Saladoid wares, and was found along­side otherwise Archaic assemblages. These find­ings led Greater Antillean archaeologists to postulate the presence of a pottery horizon that pre­ceded the arrival of both Saladoid and Huecoid peoples to the Caribbean. Even though the pres­ence of these early ceramics was first recognized in Cuba more than eight decades ago (Harrington 1921), the repercussions of these discoveries have not been fully absorbed by archaeologists working outside the Greater Antilles. In the few cases in which this issue has been addressed outside Cuba and Hispaniola, it has been treated as an isolated phenomenon (e.g., Rouse 1992) with no major effects for the general sociocultural landscape of the Caribbean. 
As has been customary in Caribbean archaeol­ogy, the analyses conducted thus far on this early pottery have focused on sherds as the basic ana­lytical unit. Fortunately, several studies carried out by Cuban and Dominican archaeologists have paid attention to the technical aspects of the production of this early pottery and have attempted to recre­ate possible vessel morphologies (e.g., Rfmoli and Nadal 1983; Ulloa and Valcarcel 2002; Veloz et al. 1976). By synthesizing such work and combining it with the information that has been generated in other islands, we address the probable reasons for the incorporation of pottery making into the tech­nological repertoire of those pre-Arawak societies. 
These inferences are based on the probable func­tions for which this early pottery was primarily suited, as indicated by the performance character­istics reflected in the technological choices that led to its production (Mills 1989; Schiffer et al. 1994; Skibo 1992). Thus, the approach to the problem is based on the study of these vessels as tools (sensu Braun 1983). This approach considers that culture and sociality are reflected not only in the finished pots but also in the operational sequences involved in their manufacture. In a very similar fashion to the chafne operatoire approach applied to lithics (i.e., Sellet 1993), technofunctional treatments of pottery focus on the whole systemic trajectory of the vessels, from the selection of clays and tem­pering agents to the application of particular form­ing and termination techniques, their use, discard, and recycling. In doing so, technofunctional stud­ies have been able to surpass the strict assignment of variations in pottery production to culture­historical explanations, and have explored other social aspects (although acknowledging that these are conditioned by and condition culture) that might account for such variability. By allowing us to infer the probable primary functions for vessels based on a set of technological and functional dimen­sions, this approach has proven useful for under­standing the reasons for the adoption of pottery in other parts of the world (e.g., Rice 1999; Sassaman 1993; see chapters in Barnet and Hoopes 1995 and Saunders and Hays 2004). This approach departs from previous studies of early pottery in the Antilles, which have focused either on its culture­historical aspects or on the economic impact that ceramic making in its generic sense had on those early societies. 
We refer to these early Antillean ceramic com­plexes as the Pre-Arawak Pottery horizon (PPH). The use of this concept does not imply that the rea­sons for the appearance of this pottery nor its for­mal attributes are homogeneous in the different loci where it has been uncovered. On the contrary, vari­ability seems to characterize these early ceramic assemblages and their contexts. We simply use the

concept to refer to the pottery manifestations that existed on the Antilles prior to the Saladoid and Huecoide migrations, with the hope that further studies will establish the presence of distinct com­plexes within and between the different islands in which early ceramic assemblages are found. 
We start by providing a general background of the discovery of this early pottery. The available information from Cuba and the Dominican Repub­lic is presented, followed by the mention of other probable early pottery contexts from Puerto Rico and the Lesser Antilles, demonstrating that argu­ments about the cultural association of this early pottery have a longer history than previously sup­posed and that it is probably more widespread than what was initially thought. Then we summarize the major technological information that has been pro­vided in the rather patchy available literature to reach the second objective of this work, which is to address the reasons for the adoption of pottery making based primarily on its social role in those early societies. Finally, we explore an aspect that has been almost totally overlooked thus far in early pottery studies in the Antilles, the probable effects that the presence of the Pre-Arawak Pottery hori­zon on the development of the post-Saladoid cul­tural manifestations that have been identified in the islands, especially in the Greater Antilles. 
Previous Research 
The Cuban Evidence 
The documentation of early pottery in association with otherwise pre-Arawak assemblages in the Antilles started early in the twentieth century. The first mention of this phenomenon was by Harring­ton ( l 921) as a result of his extensive work in Cuba, where he noted the presence of pottery in Ciboney (i.e., Archaic) sites. He not only stated the possi­bility of the direct association of ceramics with the Ciboney culture, but also provided the first descrip­tion of the major vessel forms and decorative ele­ments. Harrington (1921 :394-395) explained that: 
Pottery of any kind is very rare on Ciboney sites, except in certain cases where it is found on or near the surface and is obviously Tain­ian and intrusive, but once in a while, as the early village-site at Mesa Buena Vista, near Jauco, may be found sherds, usually plain but sometimes decorated with simple angular pat­terns, or rather crude vessels which seem to have been of flattened globular form .... Now, semi globular and boat-shape forms and angu­lar patterns are by no means unknown to Tain­ian ware, although they are not common; yet it seems significant that such forms and such patterns, and these only, should be found apparently associated to the Ciboney culture. 
Harrington's words fell on deaf ears for at least two decades, as future works on this and other islands assumed the view of the pre-ceramic nature of Archaic cultures that remains prevalent to this day. The view that these early peoples could not know about pottery production was partly based on the evolutionary models that were later incorpo­rated in the culture-historical reconstructions on the islands. For instance, this is evident in Rouse's (1948:499) statement that "So far as artifacts are concerned, certain negative data characterize all Ciboney sites. Pottery is never present, nor are the griddles on which the Arawak used to bake cas­sava." To erase the possibility raised by Harring­ton of pottery in these sites, he added the note that "The few pottery-bearing sites which Harrington ... called Ciboney have since been shown to be Arawak" (Rouse 1948:49). Further work in Cuba has proven conclusively that Harrington was right. 
Interestingly enough, when Rouse excavated Ciboney sites in Cuba he also mentioned the pres­ence of pottery at El Nfspero, which he attributed to the fact that it was "deposited there after the abandonment of that site by the Indians" (Rouse 1942:133). However, a review of the available data by Pichardo (1946) reestablished the presence of pottery in association to Ciboney sites on the south­ern coast of Camagiiey. Pichardo, among others (for a review see Godo 1997), provided a careful eval­uation of this issue and, among other alternatives, argued for the possibility that these non-Taino peo­ple had the ability to produce ceramics, which he described as crude and undecorated (Pichardo 1946:75-76). Not only was his mention of the pres­ence of ceramics in Ciboney contexts an important contribution at the time, but also the ceramics' asso­ciation with ritual contexts such as burial caves and shellmounds (i.e., caneyes) was a vital observa­tion, as will be discussed later. 
Twenty years later, Tabfo and Rey ( 1966: 82-83) revisited these ceramics in association with what

they called the Cayo Redondo aspect of Ciboney culture and indicated that they were most probably intrusive to the sites, although they did not totally discard the possibility of their production by pre­Arawak peoples. In that same year, Tabio and Guarch ( 1966) published the results of their exca­vations at the Mejias and Mayari sites (Figure 1), which showed the presence of a cultural manifes­tation that presented a different pottery assemblage from those found in sub-Tafno and Tafno sites of that island. They labeled this manifestation the Mayari culture and argued that it probably repre­sented a Meillacan migration from Haiti that arrived and lived in Cuba between A.D. 900 and A.D. 1100. 
A different interpretation, however, was pro­vided by Kozlowski (197 4 ), upon his review of the lithics collected by Dacal in his excavations at Can­imar, Aguas Verdes, and Playita. This led him to define the Canimar-Aguas Verdes culture, in which ceramics were found in association with a microlithic blade industry. The purported similar­ity that he observed between this lithic assemblage and that found in association with some Formative cultures, such as those from Poverty Point and Jake­town in the southeastern United States or Momil I in Colombia, led him to postulate that such pottery was indeed produced by early societies that could have migrated to the Caribbean from either of those areas around 1000 B. C. Kozlowski' s work was also important because it provided a thermolumines­cence assay for one of the sherds from the Playita site, which dated to 26 B.C. (Dacal 1986, cited in Tabfo 1995:46). 
The finding of similar sites by Herrera Fritot (1970) and Navarrete (1989), among others, and the fact that the pottery found in excavations at the Mejias and Mayari sites associated with otherwise pre-Arawak assemblages, led Tabfo ( 1991) to revise his original postulation and to consider the Mayarf culture as the final phase of what he then termed the protoagr{cola societies of Cuba. Since Tabfo's work, the detailed analyses carried out by archae­ologists in Cuba (e.g., Godo 1997; Jouravleva 2002; Martinez 1997; Ulloa 2001; Ulloa et al. 2001; Ulloa and Valcarcel 2002; also see Brito and Pereira 2001 for a bibliographical overview of this issue) have definitely raised the bar regarding social implica­tions of early pottery on that island. Their studies have also provided new radiocarbon dates for this manifestation. For instance, Godo (1997 :26) and

Jouravleva (2002:36) cite three early assays from the Cayo Jorajuria site obtained from three differ­ent pottery-bearing artificial levels that reportedly dated to 2160 B.C. (80-90 cm below surface), 1810 
B.C. (60-70 cm below surface), and 1920 B.C. (40-50 cm below surface) (no sample numbers or dated materials are reported), although the contex­tual integrity of those dates has been questioned by Godo (1997). Other dates for this early pottery come from sites such as Corinthia III (2300 ± 60 
B.P. [Beta 133952; charcoal]), San Benito (2020 ± 60 B.P. [Beta 93851; charcoal]), and La Herradura (uncalibrated 2050 ± 70 B.P. [Beta 140075; char­coal]), among others (for a list, see Ulloa and Val­carcel 2002). Finally, they have been able to show the wide distribution of these materials across the whole island and the very diverse array of envi­ronmental settings in which they are found. 
The Dominican Evidence 
The Dominican Republic was the second major focus of study of this early pottery, following Cuba. The first indications about this pottery horizon there were provided by Krieger (1931:118-119), who indicated that: 
Most writers on the Ciboney are not quite sure in their own minds whether these culturally supposedly impoverished aborigines made pottery or not. It fits in well with any scheme of culture sequence or hypothesis regarding the crude pottery forms frequently appearing in village sites and in caves in Santo Domingo and in Cuba to attribute such undecorated pot­tery form to a prepottery or early pottery­making tribe. 
Discussions about the possibility of the associ­ation of pottery with a pre-Arawak culture were not registered again in the Dominican Republic until the 1970s, with Veloz et al's (1974, 1976) work on the Caimito and Musie Pedro sites, which provided dates as early as 2255 ± 80 B.P. (1-8646; shell). Later work by Rfmoli and Nadal (1983) in Hon­duras del Oeste provided dates as early as 2310 ± 90 B.P. (1-6012; charcoal), and their revisions added new sites into the mix (e.g., La Piedra, El Pomier, Cueva de los Limones). Work at the El Barrio and de Pepe sites of Punta Cana has recently docu­mented the presence of another early pottery com­plex dated to as early as 2290 ± 60 B.P. (sample number not reported; shell; Veloz and Ortega 1996; Veloz 2001). Pottery has also been reported in ear­lier sites such as El Curro in Puerto Alejandro, dated to 3400 ± 95 B.P. (sample number and mate­rial dated not reported) (Ortega and Guerrero 1981 :48). More recently, Atiles and Lopez (2005) have also indicated early pottery at the Punta Bayahibe site, with earliest dates between 3530 ± 70 B.P. (Beta 199782; shell; 813C= .5) and 3380 ± 60 B.P. (Beta 199781; shell; 813C= 1.0). 
It should be noted that when faced with the Dominican evidence of early pottery from the El Caimito and Musie Pedro sites, Rouse (1989) argued that the pottery present at those sites was a result of the adoption of this technology by the Casimiroid from Hacienda Grande people by a process of transculturation. In his latest culture­historical flowchart Rouse included El Caimito as a style within the Ceramic Age cultures, although he affiliated it with the Courian Casimiroid sub­series, which paradoxically is_ classified within the Archaic age (Rouse 1992:52). Rouse (1992:92) justifies this by stating that: 
It would seem, then, that the makers of El Caim­ito pottery were El Porvenir people who copied Hacienda Grande-style pottery, thereby creat­ing a dual culture. Because their El Porvenir heritage was dominant and their ceramics was [were] borrowed, I have assigned them to the Courian Casimiroid subseries in figure 14. 
Such an interpretation merits further scrutiny. 
Other Problable Early Pottery Contexts 
Aside from Cuba and the Dominican Republic, no clear evidence for this early pottery horizon has been produced thus far in the Antilles. However, a literature review indicates that this PPH might have extended beyond those two countries. For instance, in Haiti this phenomenon has not been formally documented, although this country clearly is fer­tile ground for this early pottery horizon based pri­marily on its existence in both Cuba and the Dominican Republic. This is made evident by reviewing the work of Rainey ( 1941 : 24) and Rouse (1941:50), who mentioned the presence of pottery at the Couri 1 site. However, Rouse ( 1941 :50) again indicated that "They are probably intrusive in the Couri 1 site, i.e., they must have been dropped on the site after it was abandoned."

LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 19, No.1, 20GI 
Since the work of these two archaeologists, pot­
tery in pre-Arawak contexts has not been docu­
mented, although this might relate to the limited 
work conducted there as well as to the probable 
erroneous association of these sites to Meillacan or Finca occupations. The potential presence of sites with early pottery in Haiti is shown by "small crude sherds" in the Archaic Source Pascade II site, dated to 1090 B.C. (Moore 1998:188). Hopefully, more work will de done there to evaluate the presence of pre-Arawak sites with pottery. 
In Puerto Rico, the available evidence is still ten­tative, although pottery associated with pre-Arawak contexts has been proposed. The first to mention pottery associated with what he later termed the Coroso culture was Rouse (1952a, 1952b) in his island-wide survey. For instance, he mentioned pot­tery in some of the middens at the Playa Blanca (Rouse 1952b:550-551) and Jobos sites (Rouse 1952b:538), where he observed "several Indian sherds on the surface of one heap," but again he considered them to have been deposited post­abandonment. Pottery was also found three decades later at the pre-Arawak Cueva Gemelos site, but it was considered to be intrusive (Davila 1981: 177). It was not until the work of Martinez ( 1994) at the Cueva La Tembladera site in the north-central por­tion of Puerto Rico that "crude" pottery was estab­lished as having been produced by the Archaic inhabitants of the island. Other work in the north­central portion of the Puerto Rico (e.g., Ayes 1989; Rodriguez and Ayes 1997) mentioned pottery in pre-Arawak contexts, although detailed published reports and radiocarbon assays of those contexts are lacking. 
More recently, new work at the Paso del Indio site, also in north-central Puerto Rico (Garcia 1998; Rodriguez Ramos 2005a; Walker 2005), led to the discovery of highly weathered pottery in two strati­graphic units sealed under 2.0 to 2.5 m of sediment (Figure 2). This pottery, originally classified as Ostionoid, was found in two recovery units (8I-D and 81-E), where two distinct pre-Arawak compo­nents were documented, one of which dated between 2520 ± 40 B.P. (Beta-178678; charcoal) and 2330 ±110 B.P. (Beta 178677; charcoal) (lithostratigraphic unit B ), and the other to 1920 ± 80 B.P. (Beta-87611; charcoal) (lithostratigraphic unit C) (Walker 2005). Classic pre-Arawak artifacts such as an edge-grinder and a round bola stone, among others, were uncovered in Jithostratigraphic 
unit B, leading further credence to the association 
of the pottery with a pre-Arawak context (Figure 
3). Two sherds were found in an even earlier com­ponent in unit 8I-C dated to 4110 ± 40 B.P. (Beta 17680; charcoal; B13C= -29.2) and 4060 ± 60 B.P. (Beta-77165; charcoal; B13C= -28.4), which led Garcia ( 1998) to postulate the possibility that these indeed corresponded to an early occupation by pottery-making peoples. Unfortunately, the use of heavy machinery and the small area excavated where these early dates were found limit the reso­lution of the data. 
A brief review of the available literature from Puerto Rico indicates the probable existence of additional Archaic sites at which pottery has been uncovered but has been considered intrusive, mostly because the sites are associated with earlier dates than what were considered acceptable for Ostionoid contexts (ca. A.D. 600). For example, Siegel and Joseph (1993:45) obtained a date of 2080 ± 70 B.P. (Beta-64388; charcoal) from the Pal­mar de Animas site near a pottery fragment described (with the assistance of the late Irving Rouse) as "transitional between Esperanza and Capa, based on the complexity of the incising and paste characteristics." However, after selecting this sample as suitable for dating, Siegel and Joseph (1993:45) considered this date to be too early for this type of pottery and argued that "the best inter­pretation for this anomalous date in connection with an Esperanza deposit is that a fire occurred naturally in the vicinity of VB-27 prior to human occupation of the area." Although that explanation is possible, the fact that only one sample was sub­mitted for dating from the site definitely limits the determination of its temporal placement. Never­theless, this case serves as an example of the com­mon interpretation of the intrusive nature of pottery found in Archaic sites and the definition of early dates for Ostionoid contexts as anomalous. These types of interpretations could partly explain the low number of early ceramic sites on Puerto Rico and the rest of the Antilles. 
In the Lesser Antilles, the possible presence of this PPH has been almost totally overlooked, but a brief review of the available information shows the need to pay more attention to the probable existence of the horizon in those islands as well. This possi­bility should not be surprising based on the inter-
