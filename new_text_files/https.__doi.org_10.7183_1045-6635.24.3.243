
NEW QUESTIONS AND OLD PARADIGMS: 
REEXAMINING CARIBBEAN CULTURE HISTORY 

William J. Pestle, L. Antonio Curet, Reniel Rodriguez Ramos, and Miguel Rodriguez Lopez 
One of the central goals of archaeology is the definition of regional cultural succession. Since at least the 1960s, archae­ology has purported to have moved beyond the strictures of Culture History, and yet the constructs of that paradigm (styles, periods, cultures) continue to be used routinely. This work aims to show that by doing so, one is still implicitly subscribing to that theoretical perspective 's assumptions and biases. In the end, this article is intended to be a self-critical assessment of the shortcomings of Caribbean archaeology vis-a-vis issues inherent in that region's dominant culture-history frame­work. Moreover, it aims to provide an example for Caribbeanists, and archaeologists working in other regions, of the value of moving beyond the products of, and not just beyond the term, Culture History.

Culture History 
Culture History, with its emphasis on culture­chronological sequences, informed the over­whelming majority of American archaeology until at least the middle of the twentieth century, when it was denounced and discarded in favor of first Processual, and eventually Postprocessual, world­views. Here we briefly discuss the central tenets and evident weaknesses of Culture History; we refer the reader to the works of Lyman et al. ( 1997), Wil­ley and Sabloff ( 1993), and Trigger (2009:211-311) for more detailed discussions on the topic. 
The fundamental goal of Culture History, as described by Alfred Kidder (1932:8), was to fully understand the "problems of cultural evolution" at a given place and through time. In working toward this goal, techniques (e.g., typologies, seriation, stratigraphic excavations) were developed to detect variation and patterns in artifact attributes and assemblages in the archaeological record. While most Cultural Historians agreed on the goals of archaeology (classification, culture history, and lifeways), disagreements arose at the level of epis­temology and methodology regarding the inter­pretation of the resultant classifications. One particular point of conflict was whether the typolo­gies being produced were emic or etic (e.g., Ford 1954a, 1954b; Spaulding 1953, 1954). 
Irving Rouse, the principal Culture Historian in the Caribbean region, strongly argued for the emic nature of his approach, arguing that modes (the basis for his system of classification, further explained below) were "attributes which conform to a community's standards, which express its con­cepts, or which reveals its customary ways of man­ufacturing and using artifacts" (Rouse 1960:313). Furthermore, such modes were inherent in artifact assemblages and represented "a natural unit of cul­tural study" (Rouse 1960:318). As such, the Rousean taxonomy was, and remains, a system conceived by its creator as reflecting the shared and inherited mental templates of the people who made and used the materials being classified. 
A corollary of the construction of these cate­gories, by Rouse and other Culture Historians, was a highly normative view of the past. Models such as Rouse's assumed that "the patterning observed in the archaeological record is a result of the shared ideas and values of a group of people" (Binford 1977: 30), norms that become embodied in the pat­terns of the material culture that those people pro­duce (see also Cordell and Plog 1979). The application of this highly normative approach resulted in the construction of charts in which archaeological cultures were boxed in discrete and homogeneous (normative) chronological and geo­graphical categories (Trigger 2009:244), with lit­tle or no explanation of the mechanisms or motivations for the observed changes (Caldwell 1959:304 ). At best, diffusion and migrations were invoked as a means of explaining changes through space and time (Trigger 2009; Willey et al. 1956). 
Recent studies in the Caribbean (e.g., Hofman et al. 2007; Hofman et al. 2010) have echoed the rallying cries of American New Archaeology of the 1960s, heralding a break from Culture History, and have argued that Caribbean archaeology is poised for a new era of discovery, one that is free of the encumbrances of Culture History's worldview. However, as we hope to show in this work, while the paradigm of Culture History may have been rejected, its attendant methodology and products live on, to the great detriment of those working in the Caribbean and their research . 
A Break at What Level? Paradigm, Ontology, Epistemology, and Methodology 
The definitions and meanings of these concepts can vary from scholar to scholar (compare Bate 1998; Clark 1993; Kuhn 1962), but for the sake of simplicity, we follow Clark (1993) by defining paradigm as the totality of beliefs, values, and techniques shared by a scientific community. It is the paradigm that determines the important ques­tions its adherents need to address. Because a par­ticular field ofstudy can include multiple scientific comrrpinities, several paradigms can co-exist in a discipline. Ontology is that aspect of paradigm that tries to answer the question of the nature of "real­ity" or the nature of the "knowable." Epistemol­ogy describes the relationship between the 
observer and the knowable or what he or she wants to know. Finally, methodology is the set oflogical and technical principles and procedures that directs investigations.

From the perspective of Culture History, the important question was: who was where when? The ontology of this approach was realist, whereas its epistemology was empiricist. The Culture His­torical methodology involved grouping traits , types, or traditions into supposedly meaningful, homogeneous, and normative units (e.g., archaeo­logical cultures), then summarizing their distribu­tion through time and space, thereby making a culture history.2 Although multiple methodologies were developed within Culture History, most were based on a series of assumptions that flowed from that theoretical framework. Among their general premises , the following five are most relevant to this discussion (Cordell and Plog 1979; Trigger 2009). For each, we cite exemplar studies from the Caribbean and other archaeological regions; how­ever, as these are assumptions, they are most often implicit in the referenced works and rarely do their authors specifically enumerate them. 
1. 
Patterns of attributes in archaeological assem­blages reflect mostly ethnic identities, archaeolog­ical cultures, or "peoples." Childe's works (1925, 1929:v-vi) are replete with this assumption (see also Rainey [1940: 105-111] and Rouse [1952]), although Ford (l 954a) expresses a more utilitarian take on types. 

2. 
Therefore, local populations can be grouped into homogenous archaeological cultures that then can be bounded temporally and geographically (in the form of culture areas) (Childe 1935; Kidder 1924:163; Rouse 1939, 1951). 

3. 
Both categories, archaeological cultures and culture areas, are empirical categories that are inde­pendent of the researcher and can be summarized in cultural and/or chronological charts (see Brain­erd [1951] for the notion of "objective" types; Krieger [1944:279-280]; and Spaulding [1953] on the idea of "valid" types). This assumption is par­ticularly explicit in the case of Rouse's "modes," and the countless charts he produced (Rouse 1939, 1992) . 

4. 
Major cultural changes were the product of migration or diffusion (Rouse 1986, 1990; Willey et al., 1956:9-23). 

5. 
Changes, as represented in the chronological charts, happened in all aspects of culture at the same time in the totality of its geographic exten­sion; otherwise, the lines representing the divisions in time and space would be revised, as Rouse ( 1990, 


1992) often did. This is particularly true if the change in material culture was a harbinger of a true "revolution" (Childe 1935) . 
In the Caribbean, the shift away from Culture History was considerably different from that expe­rienced in North American archaeology. Culture History remained the dominant theoretical frame­work in the region until the 1990s, and still is the main approach in some of the islands and within some archaeological circles. More important, the supposed shift from Culture History began with­out a healthy critique of its paradigm, let alone a complete disconnection from it. On the contrary, the asking of new types of questions was not seen as a harbinger of a new worldview (or world views), but as a complement, extension, or logical pro­gression of the old Rousean theoretical framework. 
Most critiques of Rouse 's chronology from the 1980s and earlier were made from Culture Histor­ical perspectives, and focused more on differences in interpretation than on the rejection of funda­mental premises (e.g., Chanlatte 1981, 1986; Oliver 1999; Veloz 1991). Theoretical critiques of the epis­temology and methodology of Rouse's approach did not appear until a decade ago (e.g., Curet 2003, 2004, 2005; Gutierrez and Rodriguez 2009; Kee­gan 2001, 2010; Rodriguez 2007, 2010; Ulloa 2005). This lack of a clean break between the new and old theoretical frameworks led Caribbeanists to continue to use the categories of Culture History without adequate questioning of their veracity (see Cordell and Plog [1979] fora similar case in Amer­ican archaeology during the heyday of the New Archaeology) . In fact, a sense of admiration and loyalty toward Rouse, his approach, and its results so permeated Caribbean archaeology that any attack against his position normally encountered strong resistance, even from researchers who con­sidered themselves "Processualists." Examples can be found in Curet (2005), Siegel (1989), and Kee­gan (1994, 1996, 2000), among others. 
In this respect, many archaeological approaches, not only in the Caribbean, but also in other regions, have failed to recognize a potentially serious prob­lem. While most of these new approaches can be considered new paradigms, which have new ontologies and epistemologies and which ask new questions, these approaches still use Culture His­torical methodology and products . By continuing in this vein, they are (1) consciously or uncon-

sciously adopting most or all the premises and 
unfounded assumptions used in their construction 
and (2) are using a methodology or product that is 
not in accord with the supposed new theoretical 
world view. 
By the simple act of using the products of Cul­ture History, one encounters not only method­ological problems but also epistemological problems. When one uses the Cultural Historical categories of periods and cultures-or, as in the case of the Caribbean, styles, subseries, or series­one implicitly accepts that these are natural units that can (or must) be used in any type of study. In doing so, one engenders a disjunction between, on the one hand, the new paradigm and its questions and, on the other hand, the units of observation and analysis. For example, recent studies on issues of 
political economy, agency, and social and political processes (Curet 2005; Hofman et al. 2010; Kee­gan 2009; Oliver 2009; Siegel 2010; Torres 2012) acknowledge that many of these phenomena are shaped by decisions made within meaningful social units such as households, kinship groups, or com­munities. By using the culture history produced by the Culture Historical approach, however, they instead accept Culture Historical units (i.e., peri­ods, series, cultures, styles) as the significant units, whether consciously or unconsciously. This is, of course, not unique to the Caribbean, but the prob­lem is more acute in that region because the chrono­logical, cultural, and social units are considered to be the same. Of course, this discrepancy between what one wants to study and the categories one uses as the basis for analysis limits the explanatory potential of such studies and the validity of their conclusions. 
To advance the cause of Caribbean archaeology, we cannot simply condemn Culture History while continuing to use the methodology to which it gave rise. Instead, we must consciously re-evaluate the appropriateness of the arbitrary categories and pre­cepts of Culture History in our research agenda. To do so requires knowledge of the development and status quo of Caribbean Culture History. 
Culture History in the Caribbean 
In his culture history of the Caribbean, Rouse ( 1960) employed a method that was notably distinct from the familiar typologies of other regions in the New World. Whereas many Culture Historians of his time concentrated on identifying diagnostic attrib­utes with spatial and chronological significance, Rouse was more concerned in identifying the attrib­utes chosen by a community of artisans based on a "conceptual framework within which the artifacts were produced" (Read 2009:46). Thus, the job of the archaeologist was not merely to identify attrib­utes that changed in patterned ways in time and space, but also to identify those attributes chosen by the cultural guidelines of the artisans. He called both the conceptual framework and the chosen attributes modes (Rouse 1960:313), and he termed his method modal analysis. Definitions of some of Rouse's basic terms and concepts follow. 
Mode. "(1) concepts of material, shape, and dec­oration to which the artisans conformed and (2) cus­tomary procedures followed in making and using the artifacts" (Rouse 1960:313). In summary, modes are all the culturally determined (i.e., not intrinsic biological, chemical, or physical) quali­ties that are manifested in artifact attributes, and they represent the smallest and most basic unit of Rousean analysis (Rouse 1939: 11-12; Siegel 1996:675). Examples of modes include red color­ing matter in clay, eversion of rim, loop handle, zoomorphic head lug, line and dot incision, etc . (Rouse 1939). To Rouse (1960:318), each of these modes was "a natural unit of cultural study, whereas the type is an arbitrary one." As Read (2009:48) points out, modes were "conceptual decision points the artisan presumably undergoes in the process of manufacturing an artifact." Modes are additive, as they represent steps in the manufacturing process rather than products and can appear in a variety of configurations stemming from an artisan's adher­ence to a shared mental template. The analogy to phonemes in linguistic analysis is an obvious one, and one that Rouse expressly acknowledged (Siegel 1996:672). The division of an assemblage into classes (styles, subseries, series) can thus proceed on the basis of the common appearance of mater­
ial attributes resulting from modal decisions. 
Style. "Sum total of a people's wares [all or part of a ceramic style (Rouse 1992: 185)] and modes" (Rouse 1992:175). Styles are the smallest classi­ficatory unit (modes being analytical rather than classificatory), and they represent all the ceram­ics found within a temporally and spatially bounded area defined by their modal similarities

(Rouse 1952). Like all of the higher levels of clas­sification (discussion follows), styles are defined by artifact assemblages, and an artifact can only be said to be of a particular style based on its mem­bership in such an assemblage (Siegel 1996). Styles represent local modal manifestations (Rodriguez 2007:36), and the various styles take the name of the site in which they were first dis­covered. Critically, as Rouse construed them, styles represent both the material assemblage of a given place and time (typically ceramics), and, with the addition of information regarding other aspects of a group's lifeways, the people and cul­ture that created them (Curet 2004; Petersen et al. 2004; Rouse 1990, 1992). 
Series. "Cultural complexes or ceramic styles, together with the peoples and cultures they define, that are known to have descended from a common ancestor" (Rouse I 992: 184). The concept of series was devised by Rouse and Jose Cruxent (1963) after a realization that certain ceramic styles they observed in Venezuela were temporally or spatially related to each other. The naming convention of a series involves the addition of "-oid" at the end of the name of a site or region that typifies its ceram­ics (e.g., Punta Ostiones site, Ostionoid series). Series are the broadest time-space category of the Rousean system, as some series last for more than 1,000 years, and, at certain points, almost the entirety of the Caribbean can be subsumed under a single series designation (e.g., the Salado id series, which stretches from the Orinoco River valley to eastern Hispaniola). 
Subseries. "Division of a series consisting of styles or cultures that share a common ancestor" (Rouse 1992: 184). Subseries designations were the final augmentation to the Rousean system, having been added in the 1980s at the suggestion of Gary Vescelius (1985). Subseries represents smaller geo­graphical and chronological groupings of styles than do series groupings and are denoted by the "-an" suffix (e.g., Meillacan Ostionoid subseries). While more restricted in spatial and temporal dis­tribution, the logic guiding subseries groupings is the same as that behind the higher-order division of series . 
Using these concepts, Rouse made a career of devising and refining the cultural and chronologi­cal sequence for the pre-and proto-historic Caribbean (and other regions of the world [Rouse 1986]). Rouse (1990:59) described his process as follows: 
I form styles or complexes of pottery and other artifacts, each of which is indicative of a sin­gle people and culture, and plot their distrib­ution on chronological charts in order to determine their units in time as well as in space. Then I group the styles into series and, fol­lowing the lead of the late Gary Vescelius, have begun to divide the latter into subseries. I plot the series and subseries on my charts in an effort to distinguish the successive waves of peoples that have engulfed the Antilles during the Lithic, Archaic, and Ceramic Ages. 

Rouse conceived of these units and their relation­ships in biological terms, as styles had ancestors and descendants and were linked and grouped on the basis of genetic similarities (Siegel 1996). Rouse's culture history was thus dendritic and tax­onomic, reflecting his training in forestry and botany.As mentioned in this description, one of the salient features of Rouse's many publications has been the construction of elaborate culture-chrono­logical charts that graphically represent the culture history of the Caribbean (Figure 1). From the 1930s through the 1990s, as new findings emerged from projects conducted in the region, Rouse would update and alter his culture history and charts (but not his methodology) accordingly. 
Since its initial development, the system Rouse devised has become ubiquitous in Caribbean archaeology. Indeed, almost every study performed in the region has used the Rousean classification, chronology, or nomenclature to some degree. Notable exceptions include the work of Luis Chan­latte Baik and Ivonne Narganes Storde of the Cen­tro de Investigaciones Arqueol6gicas at the University of Puerto Rico; since the early 1980s, Chanlatte (1981, 1985) and Narganes (l983, 1986) have advanced and revised an alternate culture his­tory for the Antilles. Also in Cuba, the influence of Marxist and Leninist perspectives resulted in the production of culture histories distinct in founda­tion and nomenclature from that of Rouse (Febles 1995; Guarch 1990; Tabio 1978; Tabio and Rey 1966, 1979, 1985; Torres 2008) . 
These few exceptions aside , ceramics, other material culture and the presumptive inhabitants of any given Caribbean archaeological site are almost

uniformly described in the terms Rouse devised. For example, ceramic artifacts from a given exca­vation unit can be called Cuevas (style), Cedrosan (subseries), and Salado id (series); the stratigraphic level at which they were found can be described as Saladoid, as opposed to a later Ostionoid level, and even the people who produced the goods found in that level can be termed Saladoid. 
The Particular Case of Cuevas 
The Cuevas style was originally defined by Rouse (1940) on the basis of ceramics in the Yale Peabody Museum. The Puerto Rican north coast site of Cuevas was chosen over other sites as the eponym for this style because its materials were thought to be more representative of the entire temporal dura­tion of the style (Rouse 1952:336). Cuevas, so defined (Rouse 1952:336-341), encompassed all materials of Period II (the Early Ceramic Age) in Puerto Rico (Rouse 1952:331-332),and its modes, as originally defined, included fine paste, thin walls, bell-shaped bowls, flat bottoms, everted rims, tri­angular rim tops, decoration on parts of vessels (primarily, shoulders), D-shaped and lug handles, peg lugs (some with perforations), red slip, red­painted rims, white-on-red designs, incisions filled with white paint, and cross-hatch incisions, among others. 

From the time of this style's initial definition, however, Rouse did acknowledge some stylistic differences through time. While Cuevas ceramics were meant to represent the entire Early Ceramic Age of Puerto Rico, excavations at some sites revealed that early "Cuevas" materials tended to possess white painting, a mode that was generally absent from later Cuevas ceramics, thereby requir­ing a division of Period II and the Cuevas style into Period Ila (Cuevas with white paint) and Period llb (Cuevas without white paint) (Rouse 1952:332). Other examples of characteristics differentially dis­tributed in time can be found in Rouse (1940:59). Eventually, many characteristics of the early Cuevas manifestations became part of the Hacienda Grande style (see following discussion), and as early as 1952, Rouse (1952:309) writes that find­ings from the Hacienda Grande site might present problems for his nascent classificatory system. Based on deposit depths alone, the first estimate for the duration of Cuevas was A.D. 929-1193 (Rouse 1952:564), a surprisingly precise range, 

given the method by which it was obtained. 
By 1955, after seeing materials excavated from the site of Hacienda Grande in Lofza (both those provided by Ricardo Alegria and those in the col­lections of the Harvard Peabody Museum), Rouse opted to re-arrange his system for the Early Ceramic Age of Puerto Rico (Rouse and Alegria 1990:8). While the Cuevas style would continue to exist, it would thereafter only refer to the later, less heav­ily decorated, and less "complex" materials of the Early Ceramic Age, with the earlier, more deco­rated, and more technologically sophisticated pot­tery belonging to the newly-coined Hacienda Grande style (Rouse and Alegria 1990:39). In terms of ceramics, the Hacienda Grande style is charac­terized by (a) monochrome, bichrome (in particu­lar, white on red), and polychrome designs that normally depict curvilinear and anthropomorphic designs, (b) some use of incisions, especially fine zone-incised crosshatched designs and wider inci­sions filled with white paint on a red background, and (c) particular vessel forms such as outflaring open bowls, bell-shaped vessels, effigy vases, and bottles (Rouse and Alegria 1990). Having lost its earlier, now Hacienda Grande sty le characteristics, the Ceuvas style's characteristic traits were reduced to (a) an infrequent use of polychrome painting, modeling, and incisions, (b) white-on-red painting being retained but in smaller proportions and rep­resenting mostly geometric designs, and ( c) a grad­ual disappearance of the use of paints (including white-on-red decoration), leaving, by the end, only monochrome painting and simple modeled face lugs (Rouse 1964, 1982; Rouse and Alegria 1990). With the addition of Hacienda Grande, Cuevas came to designate the terminal style of the lowland Venezuela-derived Saladoid series in Puerto Rico (recalling that the series concept was first employed by Rouse and Cruxent [1963]). 
From 1963 onward, Rouse and his colleagues made substantial use of the then-novel technique of radiocarbon dating to provide some degree of temporal rigor to the region's culture history (Ale­gria 1965; Rouse and Alegria 1978; Rouse et al. 1963; Rouse and Cruxent 1963). As part of this effort, a single bulk charcoal radiocarbon date of 
A.D. 510 ± 80 (1440 ± 80 B.P.) (Supplemental Table 1) was secured from the Cuevas site and was used to provide the fir&t absolute date for the style, with the standard error of that date serving as the

Finally, after Rouse had added the concept of subseries to his regional classificatory scheme in the mid-l 980s (Vescelius 1985), the Cuevas style became the terminal style of the Cedrosan sub­series of the Saladoid series in Puerto Rico. This final alteration established Cuevas as the last Puerto Rican ceramic manifestation possessing strong roots in the South American continent or adjacent continental islands, location of the type-sites for both the Cedrosan subseries (Cedros, Trinidad) and the Saladoid series (Saladero, Venezuela). By the time of Rouse's last regional publication (Rouse 1992), and on the basis of the first Cuevas date (above) and three more bulk charcoal radiocarbon dates (two from the site of Monserrate and one from Punta Ostiones) (Rouse and Allaire 1978), the Cuevas style was given a final temporal range of AD. 400-600 (uncalibrated) (Figure 1). 
Refining or Rejecting Cuevas 
In recent years, the temporal dimensions of the Cuevas style, and that of most Puerto Rican cul­tural manifestations, have begun to be re-evaluated. While early indications of problems with the tem­poral and stylistic boundaries of Cuevas were found by Oliver (1995) and Lundberg (2007), the clear­est challenge to the sty le' s temporal integrity comes from the large radiocarbon database amassed by Renie! Rodriguez Ramos (2007, 2010). As pre­sented in his dissertation and in other works ,

Rodriguez and colleagues (2010) have shown that the supposedly temporally distinct and discrete styles of the Rousean culture history were instead overlapping in both their temporal and geographic distributions. While we are generally convinced of the veracity of Rodriguez's findings, because his samples are drawn from a variety of published and unpublished works carried out by scholars using different methods of excavation and analysis, and because the cultural attribution of each date is based on each excavator's possibly idiosyncratic analy­sis of the ceramics and other materials, it is possi­ble that some temporal error may be present. To test the accuracy of this temporal rearrangement, we use a series of radiocarbon assays from the site of Punta Candelero as a test case for the temporal­ity of Cuevas. 
Beyond reassessments of the chronology of Rouse's culture history, however, in recent years his entire system has been criticized on the level of its methodological premises and assumptions. Six main charges have been leveled, many of which echo those made by the New Archaeologists against the Culture Historians a generation earlier. The per­ceived points of weakness of the systems include 
(a) 
its focus on only one class of material culture: pottery (Sued-Badillo 1992:603); (b) its normative perspective (Paynter 1989; Rodriguez 2007); ( c) its troublesome correlation of local pottery manifes­tations with distinct notions of group identity and superstructural processes (Petersen et al. 2004:22); 

(
d) its tendency to ignore the social aspects of phe­nomena and processes (Curet 2004; Hofman 1995; 


Rouse 1990); ( e) the inaccuracy of the homogenous groups created (Curet 2003, 2004; Curet et al. 2004; Keegan 2000, 2001, 2004; Petersen et al. 2004; Rodriguez 2007; Wilson 2001); and (f) the unfounded assumption of the presence, at any one time and place, of only one culture (Rodriguez 2007; Rouse 1990; Siegel 1996; Wilson 2001) . Using the temporal reassessment of the Cuevas style as a starting point, we return to many of these criticisms (discussion follows) in a demonstration of the hazards of the continued uncritical use of Cul­ture History constructs such as Cuevas. 
The Test Case: Punta Candelero 
The site of Punta Candelero is located in south­eastern Puerto Rico, on a sandy peninsula that juts into the Vieques Sound (Figure 2). The existence of the site was first documented in 1986, and is on the grounds of the Palmas del Mar, a major tourist resort complex; extensive excavations were made at the site between February 1988 and June 1989 (Rodriguez 1991). These horizontally and verti­cally expansive excavations revealed a more com­plex pattern of habitation than initially expected. The excavators have argued for two periods of habitation at the site-the earlier component being associated with the La Hueca complex; and the later, with the Cuevas style. In this later phase, the site took the form of a semi-circle of domestic spaces and work areas arranged around an open central plaza. Eight charcoal dates for this portion of the site's occupation were obtained from both

refuse deposits and domestic structures (house posts) (Supplemental Table 1). 
In the course of their work at Punta Candelero, excavators also recovered remains from no fewer than 106 human burials, principally from the open space within the semi-circle of dwellings. Based on location, stratigraphy, and grave offerings (including numerous graves with unarguably Cuevas-style whole vessels), the excavators were unequivocal in associating all the burials with the Cuevas phase of the site (Rodriguez 1991: 612). In his dissertation, Pestle (2010) attempted 
AMS (accelerator mass spectrometry) dating of these burials, thereby allowing us to test, in a very localized and controlled instance, the tem­poral bounds of Cuevas. Of the 63 burials that could be located, 50 possessed sufficient unal­tered collagen for AMS dating (Pestle and Colvard 2012). AMS dates for those 50 skeletons, first reported in Pestle (2010), are presented in Supplemental Table 1. 
In Figure 3, we present the calibrated date ranges for the various radiocarbon samples discussed ear­lier and listed in Supplemental Table 1. Calibration for all dates was performed using Calib 6.0 soft­ware (http://calib.qub.ac.uk/calib/) and the Int­Cal09 terrestrial calibration curve (Reimer et al. 2009). The represented dates include (1) the early radiocarbon assay used by Rouse in his initial tem­poral definition of the Cuevas style, (2) the exca­vators' charcoal dates from the Cuevas portion of Punta Candelero, (3) AMS bone dates from osten­sibly Cuevas individuals at Punta Candelero, and 
(4) the series of radiocarbon assays representing Cuevas manifestations from across the island gath­ered by Rodriguez (2007, 2010, Rodriguez et al. 2010). 
Beginning at the left end of Figure 3, we pre­sent the calibrated range (cal A.D. 426-726 at the extremes of the 2a range) of Rouse 's original radio­carbon assay (1440 ± 80 B.P.) for Cuevas (Rouse andAlegrfa 1978; Rouse et al. 1963). To facilitate comparison with the recently obtained radiocarbon dates, the shaded band represents the approximate calibrated equivalent (cal. A.D. 500-700) to the uncalibratedA.D. 400-600 range Rouse proposed for the Cuevas style in his final revision (Rouse 1992) of the region's culture history (an exact cal-

ibration of such a date range being impossible with­out accompanying standard errors). Moving to the right of Rouse's original proposed dates are the eight charcoal assays from the Cuevas component of Punta Candelero obtained during the course of the site's original excavation (Rodriguez 1991). Based on these dates alone, Cuevas appears to be notably more recent and longer-lived. It is only at the oldest extremes of their 2a ranges that these dates even overlap with the calibrated range of Rouse's dates for the style; the average of the median probabilities of the eight dates is an extremely late cal A.D. 834; and the upper extent of the 2a ranges extends into the eleventh century 

A.D. (cal AD. 1022). 
Shown next in Figure 3 are the 50 AMS dates from the demonstrably "Cuevas" skeletons of Punta Candelero. While all 50 of the burials are associ­ated with the excavators' proposed Cuevas com­ponent, on the basis of position, stratigraphy, or grave goods, the eight dates indicated by black arrows are more securely "Cuevas" in that the grave goods each included complete Cuevas-style ves­sels. While the 2a range of dates derived from these 50 skeletons entirely subsumes both Rouse's and Rodriguez's dates for Cuevas, they also substan­tially extend both the upper and lower temporal bounds thereof. At the limits of their 2a ranges, Cuevas at Punta Candelero, based on the dating of short-lived specimens (humans) in clear associa­tion with Cuevas goods, now stretches from cal 

A.D. 
388-1206.3 Even as judged by measures of central tendency, the average of the median prob­ability calibrated dates for these skeletons is cal 

A.D. 
760, well outside of the calibrated range of the temporal boundaries Rouse ( 1992) proposed for Cuevas. 


Finally, at the rightmost extent of Figure 3, we present the 31 additional radiocarbon dates for Cuevas deposits from eleven sites across the island, as gleaned from the radiocarbon database of Rodriguez (2007, 2010; Rodriguez et al. 2010). As judged by these dates, any lingering semblance of the temporal coherence of the Cuevas style as tra­ditionally understood (in terms of discreteness and lack of contemporaneity with other styles) disap­pears. At the limits of their 2a probability ranges, these dates now show that Cuevas (however that ends up being defined, see following discussion) could have lasted as long as 1,400 years, from as early as 41 cal B.C. (P0-39) to as late as cal A.D. 1395 (Lily Caribe). Even without the two late out­lying dates from Lily Caribe, the span of Cuevas (again, at the limits of the 2a ranges) could still be more than 1,200 years. Important in terms of test­ing the coherence and accuracy of Rodriguez's radiocarbon database, the 50 AMS dates from the Punta Candelero burials are statistically indistin­guishable from these dates for Cuevas manifesta­tions at sites across the island. 
Discussion and Conclusion 
In interpreting these results, we (1) assess their implications for Puerto Rican/Caribbean archae­ology and the culture history that archaeologists working in the region followed almost uniformly for the past 70 years, (2) examine what implica­tions such findings have for the broader relation­ship between Culture History (or its lingering assumptions, premises, and biases) and current archaeological endeavor, regardless of region, and 

(3) provide some constructive suggestions about future directions for archaeological research in a post-Culture Historical era. 
Caribbean Culture History 

At the most local scale, these results have serious ramifications for the Rousean culture history of the Caribbean. To begin with, the temporal findings from the Cuevas skeletons of Punta Candelero ver­ify the broader accuracy and integrity of Rodriguez's findings regarding the temporal dimensions of the Cuevas style and serve to wholly invalidate the temporal boundaries of the style pro­posed by Rouse. This observation is not meant to criticize Irving Rouse, nor is it made from a posi­tion of ignorance of the chronometric methods of archaeology in the 1960s and 1970s. Instead,itlays bare our error in assuming, rather than demon­strating, the validity of these earlier culture histor­ical findings. 
Taken together, these new chronometric find­ings, as seen in Figure 3, indicate that Cuevas lasted from sometime around cal AD. 248 through cal A.D. 1318, based on median probabilities (or possibly longer, when the 2a ranges are consid­ered). While this study can only speak to the spe­cific case of Cuevas, by confirming one aspect of Rodriguez's deconstruction of the Rousean

chronology, it lends greater credence to his find­ings as a whole. As noted by Rodriguez and col­leagues (2010:21 ), Rouse's notion of"typological time is inappropriate for addressing issues of vary­ing scales of temporality and ... it blurs the hor­izontal and vertical variability that existed in the island through time." Rouse's thinking, in this account, is emblematic of Culture History 
Assumption Number 2 (temporally and geo­graphically bounded cultural homogeneity), and it is precisely this sort of thinking that the present findings invalidate. By showing that manifesta­tions of the Cuevas style lasted ten centuries longer than Rouse proposed and overlapped temporally with seven of the eight other styles that he proposed for the island (all of which also overrun their sup­posed bounds, see Figures I and 3), the error of this line of Rousean thinking is manifest. 
The natural question that follows from these findings concerns the continuing utility of terms such as "Cuevas" or the other seemingly hollow ele­
ments of the Caribbean 's culture history. If mani­festations of something called "Cuevas" lack any of their supposed temporal coherence, what can or should the term continue to mean, and should it even be retained? Do the supposed natural cate­gories of the Culture Historian (Assumption Num­ber 3, that archaeological cultures are natural and exist independent of the researcher) retain any meaning once they have been invalidated? There are at least three possible answers to these questions. 
One possibility is that Cuevas, as some sort of identity, actually existed to some degree in accor­dance with Rouse's definition, but that the times­pan associated with the style was simply much longer than Rouse estimated it to be. The alteration of the style's temporal boundaries by itself invali­dates the mono-ethnic precept of the Rousean/Cul­ture Historical method that could conceive of only one people existing in one place at one time (a corollary of Cultural History Assumption Number 2). Stylistic overlap, of the sort demonstrated here,

raises the possibility of multiethnic communities or social plurality as Rodriguez (2010) has previ­ously argued. 
Alternatively, the recovery of Cuevas style materials can no longer be seen as reflecting a par­ticular cultural or ethnic identity, much less as an index or marker fossil. Cuevas style ceramics, as presently defined, were produced for over a mil­lennium across the island's width and breadth, and overlapped entirely with the production of numer­ous other styles of ceramic , both within sites (Rodriguez 2007:302-303) and at different con­temporary sites. Thus, there is nothing chronolog­ically unique or exclusive about the cultural manifestations (ceramics) traditionally lumped under the term "Cuevas." From this perspective, referring to Cuevas sites , Cuevas occupation phases, or Cuevas burials (as at Punta Candelero) appears meaningless (as traditionally defined), as there is no such aspect as a discrete "Cuevas." Instead, whatever it is that we call Cuevas would appear to be only a distinct ceramic assemblage, an assemblage ofRousean modes-without a sole accompanying ethnicity, style, culture, or society. This invalidates Culture History Assumption Num­ber 1 (patterns of archaeological attributes reflect ethnicity). Perhaps, as Carlson and Torres (2011:420-421) have observed, Cuevas ceramics represent some sort oflong-surviving fine or serv­ing ware, the production of which remained rela­tively continuous and long-lasting despite changes in the underlying utilitarian wares. If Cuevas is thus reduced to only denoting a set of ceramic­manufacture conventions, the way that other cul­tural phenomena previously lumped under the heading of Cuevas are now understood, undergo­ing a radical revision. 

A third possibility is that the previous two explanations could be combined. Under such a scenario, Cuevas began its existence in associa­tion with a specific cultural identity, but over time was reduced to a set of ceramic-manufacture con­ventions that were used by multiple peoples/cul­tures, following a process of emulation, appropriation, or transculturation. Such a scenario would invalidate Culture History Assumption Number 4 (changes in material culture follow events of migration or diffusion). Regardless of the preferred explanation, this revised temporal under­standing of what Cuevas is changes our under­
standing of actual lifeways and processes in ancient Puerto Rico. Here we present two brief examples of the impact of such revised under­standings, both of which are illustrative of the lack of merit of Culture History Assumption Number 5 (simultaneous change in the totality ofa culture). 
Recent studies (e.g., Curet 2005) have used the traditional Rousean chronology and assumed that the burials from Punta Candelero were a) contem­porary and b) restricted to the periodA.D. 400-600, concluding that the site was a short-lived migrant community. If these assumptions had guided Pes­tle's study of paleodiet at Punta Candelero (Pestle 2010), he would have developed a normative understanding of the nature of the "Cuevas" diet at the site, thereby looking past significant variations in diet among the various individuals buried there. Instead, with dates in hand for every burial in ques­tion, and with the actual broad temporal span of the burials revealed, Pestle was able to see the diver­sity in dietary signature at the site as the result of long-term diachronic shifts from a heavy reliance on reef and seagrass-derived protein to a much heavier reliance on terrestrial protein sources (Fig­ure 4). Such a shift not only belies the sort of nor­mativity that is at the very heart of the Culture Historical approach, but also demonstrates the obvious lack of universality of cultural change, as diet in Punta Candelero changed dramatically while ceramics remained the same. 
On a broader, islandwide scale, the significantly later terminus of Cuevas questions widely held understandings of the development of social inequality and the centralization of political power on the island. As traditionally understood (Curet 1992, 1996, 2005; Siegel 1992), material culture of the Cuevas style was thought to be the product of people possessing an egalitarian political con­figuration. The first indicators of increasing socio­political inequality, so it has been argued, appear in the form of monumentalized ball courts and plazas at civic-ceremonial centers at the begin­ning of the following series (the Ostionoid), around 
A.D. 600. Thus, Cuevas materials in deposits at such sites were believed to precede their monu­mentalization and the amassing of individual polit­ical power. Now, as it has been demonstrated that Cuevas lasted well past cal A .D. 1000, perhaps we need to understand the appearance of Cuevas mate­rials at ceremonial centers not as leftovers from an

earlier phase of occupation or use, but rather as evidence that such sites functioned as multiethnic gathering place, wherein unifying, rather than dif­ferentiating, activities took place (e.g., Torres 2012). This revised temporal understanding thus can have much more important and interesting processual reverberations. 
Paradigmatic Implications 
While the temporal redefinition of the Cuevas style has obvious local implications, it also serves as an object lesson about the nature of Culture Histori­cal products and the problems that result from their continued use. Put more simply, what we propose is not a simple chronological tweak to the system, as the factual inaccuracy of the region's dominant culture history provides entry into an examination of its fallacious underpinnings. As detailed above, even if one rejects Culture History, in using its products, such as the Cuevas style, one is still implicitly subscribing to that paradigm's assump­tions and biases. In instances of gross factual inac­curacy, such as demonstrated here, the harm caused by such continued use is greatly compounded. In this sense, these locally significant findings have ramifications not just for Puerto Rico or the Caribbean; because similar problems exist in other regions of the world, they can inform the process of building culture history in any region. 
By referencing a culture history construct/prod­uct when discussing a site, phase, assemblage, or artifact, one is in effect using reductive shorthand that is meant to rapidly bring others up to speed on the cultural context of one's findings. In saying that object X is Cuevas, one denotes that it is a product of the period AD. 400-600 (or whatever is the con­sensus of the date range for that style at a given moment) , that it was made in a society possessing an egalitarian political configuration, by people who shared a uniform, demonstrable, and emic cul­tural affinity with all the other people who made Cuevas objects. Furthermore, if one reports the dis­covery of a Cuevas deposit overlain by materials of the Ostiones style (Ostionan Ostionoid sub­series), one is implicitly communicating cultural discontinuity, temporal succession, total cultural change along a uniform vector, and the evolution or replacement (absorption, acculturation, eradi­cation) of a less "developed" culture (and people) by a more advanced one. While few contemporary archaeologists, Caribbean orotherwise, would con­fess to believing or subscribing to all of the above, by using any construct of Culture History (e.g., Cuevas), one perpetuates such notions. In either instance, the use of culture historical categories reinforces their supposed reality. 
The problem confronting archaeologists is, in many respects, akin to that seen within physical anthropology during the last century. Physical anthropologists of the nineteenth and early twen­tieth centuries worked primarily within a racialist (and racist) paradigm that reduced the variation of the world's human inhabitants to a handful of sup­posedly meaningful racial types (Cook 2006; Spencer 1982). Since Boas's (1912) seminal work at the tum of the twentieth century, nail after nail has been driven into the coffin of this racialist worldview and the specious products (types such as "Caucasoid" and "Negroid") that it yielded (Gould 1981). Thus, one would be hard-pressed to find a contemporary physical anthropologist (with the possible exception of forensic anthropologists, who necessarily are required to identify a subject's "race") who still uses such groupings, having been shown to be without merit, in the course of their work. To employ such units of analysis would be to subscribe to the flawed theoretical assumptions (in this case, Eurocentrism and racism) that pro­duced them. 

In the present case, where we can demonstrate the factual inaccuracy of the culture historical products, we would state categorically that the time has come to leave these last vestiges of Cul­ture History behind. However, even in regions where the chronology developed by Culture His­torians is secure and accurate, the assumptions that guided their construction of categories/types/cul­tures are still not in concordance with contempo­rary approaches. Thus, the first step in any re-evaluation of a region's culture history must be a critical reassessment or testing of our working assumptions (e.g.: Can more than one people live in one place at one time?). In such a way, a cul­ture history free of Culture History can be made. Only when this step has been taken can other approaches -including, but not limited to, net­work theory, computational modeling, landscape archaeology, gender theory, agency theory, behav­ioral ecology, Marxist archaeology, historical ecol­ogy, etc.-be applied without the invalidating

encumbrance of Culture History's paradigmatic assumptions. 
Future Directions 
Although the prospect of leaving behind the com­fort of the "pillowed squares that form the basis of ( t )his model" (Rodriguez 2007 :3 26) is daunting, in the following pages we provide a few modest sug­gestions on profitable ways forward. 
First, in the absence of reliable time-markers in material culture (e.g., Cuevas style ceramics no longer connote a particular restricted period of time), we suggest the use of multiple approaches to control for chronology in future studies. Our first suggestion is to begin identifying new chronolog­ically diagnostic markers at more localized levels 
(e.g .. sites or river drainages). In choosing these diagnostic markers , we should avoid falling into the conceptual trap of the Culture Historians in assuming that almost any change in material cul­ture was the result of a change in ethnicity or eth­nic makeup (Culture History Assumption Number 1). Rather, we should leave ourselves open to the full range of social, cultural, economic, techno­logical, and environmental forces that might pro­vide the impetus for technological change, all or none of which might have functioned concomi­tantly with ethnic change(s). 

Furthermore, instead of seeking to construct a typology that includes and explains all prehistoric cultural manifestations across a broad region (which was the ultimate goal of the Culture Historical period even if it had more localized beginnings), our work should seek to identify temporal patterning in material culture on a local scale and in accordance with our research problem. Only when this local cul­ture history is well characterized should we seek to broaden our scale of reference (geographically or in terms of research problem)-this time however without the premises of Culture History. To accom­plish this goal, we are free to use the same excel­lent techniques (not methods) developed by the culture historians to detect and identify changes in 
the archaeological record (i.e., stratigraphy, classi­
fication, seriation). Of course, this is a long-term effort, and the next two approaches are more imme­diately available to most researchers. 
Given the ubiquity and relatively low cost of radiocarbon (or other absolute) dating techniques, the second approach is to report archaeological findings by reference to such dates rather than being lumped under a certain culture history construct. While radiocarbon dating has serious limitations and caveats (see Nash 2009), knowing, for instance, that two radiocarbon-dated phenomena were con­temporary (or that one was earlier or later) is more useful than knowing that they both belong to the same temporally incoherent culture history group­ing. Again, the goal of this approach is to build a chronological sequence without the assumptions 
(e.g., homogeneity within cultural categories, exclusivity from other cultures, any notion of tem­poral boundaries, uniformity in cultural change) implicit in the Culture History products. Whereas every archaeologist wants a good chronology, few have been sufficiently willing to pay the price of admission. However, in light of the crumbling validity of the assumptions that have guided our chronology building to date, the possibly heavy price must be paid. We fully acknowledge that the implication of this suggestion will likely be a chronology with ubiquitous temporal overlap, but this muddied culture history will bear a far closer resemblance to actual past events than the stylized version we possess today. 
We do acknowledge that situations exist of which no absolute dates can be obtained. Probably the most familiar of these are regional studies, where most of the information is obtained from sur­face collections, but museum collections and exca­vations without the necessary financial resources also fall into this category. In these cases, we sug­gest an approach that combines both some of the traditional techniques developed by the Culture Historian, particularly classification and seriation, and quantitative and statistical methods adapted to archaeological problems (e.g., cluster analysis, multi-dimensional scaling, and correspondence analysis). This approach has been used throughout the world to order various kinds of archaeological events (e.g., occupation of a site, ceramic types), and while it provides only relative dating, it has been used successfully to interpret large amounts of archaeological data that otherwise would have been undatable (Chou 1994; Curet 1992; Curet et al. 1994; Duff 1996; Halekoh and Yach 2004; Scwaiger and Opitz 2003; Smith and Neiman 2007; Stark and Curet 1994). 
Third, in evaluating "mixed" archaeological deposits, which are the rule rather than the excep-

tion in many sites in Puerto Rico (for a list of such deposits, see Rodriguez 2007:302-303), we ought to free ourselves of the strictures that Culture His­torical thinking placed on us. While these mixed deposits have often been thought to be the result of a Jack of contextual integrity (see, e.g., lengthy discussion in Rodriguez et al. 2008), we now find ourselves free to embrace the fact that they might actually indicate the coeval performance of mul­tiple pottery-making traditions. Notwithstanding the effects of cultural or natural formation processes, perhaps such contemporaneity of cul­tural manifestations indicates the presence of mul­ti ethnic or plural contexts. While differentiating between mixing (which does happen) and true plu­rality may not be straightforward, the widespread coexistence of pottery of supposedly distinct styles (as in the examples presented in Rodriguez et al. 2008) ought to be given serious consideration rather than being dismissed ahistorically as a few "intrusive" sherds. Fourth, in developing local chronologies, we should not make the error of the Culture Histori­ans , who, in the abstract, realized that total cultural change was not the rule, but in practice often assumed the universality of the systems they devised (e.g., Rouse equating changes in ceramic style with evolutions and revolutions in ethnic, political, and social realms). How things are orga­nized across space and time will likely change depending on the sort of research questions being asked. This perspective acknowledges that not everything in a specific region changes at the same time. Thus, some changes in the archaeological record may reflect changes in social organization, whereas others might reflect differences in ideol­ogy, environment, or economy, none of which nec­essarily happened at the same time or produced similar effects (see previous discussion of stylis­tic/technological change related to, and separate from, changes in ethnicity). This is the phenome­non that Braudel (1974:57) referred to as the plu­rality of historical time. In conclusion, work aimed at constructing new culture histories must (a) be carried out with strong reference to absolute chronology, (b) keep an open mind to overlap, hybridism, creolization, and plu­rality, (c) work bottom-up, and (d) be open to alter­ation, depending on the research questions at hand. As such, we must consciously and explicitly reject all of the enumerated assumptions of Culture His­tory, embrace the fuzziness of our bounded cultural groups, and not fetishize the constructs that we develop. We must remember that what we are cat­aloging is nothing more than a shared set of mate­rial cultural manifestations, and that such shared sets of modes or types or styles need not connote com­monality of belief nor heritage. By these means, the construction of our culture histories might finally be free of the shadow of Culture History. Acknowledgments.

Notes 
I. In this paper, when we refer to Culture History (with initial capitals), we are referring to the paradigm (Kuhn 1962) that dominated American archaeology through the first half of the twentieth century. The Culture Historical method refers to the premises, strategies, and methods used by adherents of the Culture History paradigm in developing culture histories. Finally, by culture history/histories (uncapitalized), we refer to the chronological sequence of material manifestations in a particular location/region/site (e.g., the culture history of Alabama). This product (culture history) need not be the

·esult of the Cultural Historical method, as alternative premises, strategies, and methods can be used to develop mch chronological sequences. 
2. 
It is important to note that here we refer solely to nethodology and not to techniques (which, while related to nethodology, are severable from them). We agree that tech­1iques developed by the early Culture Historians to detect md track changes in the archeological record (stratigraphy, ;eriation , classifications) are excellent contributions and andmarks in the history of archaeology (see Trigger W09:309). 

3. 
Although it is possible that the marine reservoir effect :ould be making individuals with higher marine protein con­mmption appear older (radiometrically) and those without 


younger, the magnitude of the temporal difference observed in this skeletal series is far greater than that attributable to such a cause. For example, employing a mixed marine cali­bration curve, a 60 percent shift from marine to terrestrial protein (80-20 versus 20-80, a dramatic shift by any mea­sure) only produces a ca.180 year change in calibrated median probability AMS date. This is dwarfed by the over 600-year range observed in the calibrated median probability AMS dates of the Punta Candelero skeletons.
