mostimportant statementsin the book: thepracticeof trepanationinancient Peruwashighlycircumscribed in time and space. It is clear now that trepanation started in the Paracas Bay (Ica) region during the Early Horizon (900–200 B.C.) and continued into the Early Intermediate Period (200 B.C.–A.D. 600). It reappeared in the central highlands, where it was very popular during the Late Intermediate period 
(A.D. 1000–1470);itwas less popularbutstill present in the northernhighlands duringthe same period. The art of trepanation was mastered by the Incas during the Late Horizon (A.D. 1470–1532) and practiced primarilyinthesouthern highlands.Althoughit seems to havebeen lost or not recorded,itcertainly continued throughout the colonial period and the .rst years of thenineteenth century.Veranomakes this point based on descriptions such as Adolph Bandelier’s account of an Aymara woman who was known to perform trepanations. 
In my view, the most important contribution of Verano’s book from a theoretical point of view is chapter 3. The concept of differential diagnosis of holesintheheadis,inhisownwords,“abasic tool that paleopathologistsuseto distinguishthevarious causes of cranial defects. The process involves considering all possible causes, ruling out the most unlikely candi­dates, andreducing one’soptions until left with one or afew mostlikelydiagnoses”(p.21).Thisapproachis carefully appliedtoall the cases presentedinthe book. Theseanalysesare wellsupportedand complemented by chapter 9, written by David Kushner and Anne 
R.Titelbaum, whichexplains ancienttrepanation from the point of view of modern neurosurgery.Similarly, chapter 10, writtenbyJ.MichaelWilliams,explains in simpleterms andbased on modern medical cases why keeping the patient alive during recovery from traumatic braininjurywas suchachallengein ancient times. Since Verano has demonstrated that the rate of survival fortrepanation wasover40percent,itis impressive that ancientPeruvians accomplishedsuch successwith theirpatientsusing limitedtechnology. 
TheeffortrequiredonVerano’sparttoget access to and analyze skulls stored in various U.S. and Peruvian collections is noteworthy. Most of the human skulls collectedby Muñiz, Hrdli.cka, orTello werein fact found on the surface of looted cemeteries that would have been lost or destroyed if they had not been recoveredbythese scholars. Thevaluableinfor­mationthese skulls providejusti.es collectingthem and storing them in museums for many years. Had they not been collected, all the rich and informative evidence presentedinthis bookwouldhavebeen lost forever. Therefore,thisisagoodexampleofhowsuch collections can be used in modern studies, one that illustrates the important role of museums, no matter where they are, in protecting and preserving these materials. 
This book is not only another .ne piece edited by Dumbarton OaksResearch Libraryand Collection but also an important .eld manual. I predict that it will be found on the tables of bioarchaeologists’ laboratories, rather thanin thestacksoflibraries.The detailedanalysesofdifferent skulls with trepanations, the wonderful illustrations, and close-ups of speci.c detailsmakeitanexcellent reference bookforscholars workingonthe artoftrepanationand physical anthro­pologyin general.

Kenneth Hirth’s agenda is a comprehensive examina­tion of the Aztec market economy, and the book is outstanding in this regard.Topics include commoner producer-sellers, craftsperson-sellers, and retail mer­chants.Hirth approaches the Aztec economy with an ethnographic sensibility and an economic conceptual structure.He breathes lifeintothe colonial documen­tation and carefully dissects key Nahuatl economic terms. 
The bookis stronglyfocused on thetheme refer­enced in the main title, Aztec economy, rather than ancient Mesoamerica. Hirth uses information from other times and places in Mesoamerica sparingly to understandthe Aztec Postclassicsituation better. Most of the documentation related to the Aztecs derives from the central highlands, speci.cally, the Basin of Mexico, the nerve center of the empire and later Spanish administration.

that he is not bringing archaeological data to bear upon thesubject,soitis notfairto wish thathehadcovered earlier and more spatially extensive archaeological information, althoughI do.Asaconsequence ofhis focus, Hirth does not tackle the origins of or changes in Mesoamerican commerce, examining instead the latest and mostcomplexmanifestationofaMesoamer­ican economic system. This is also the only one for which rich documentation exists. 
The book is well written, with a smooth presen­tation and few typographical or grammatical errors (suchas “further” insteadof“farther”).Manydetails, clari.cations, and additional theoretical comments are placed in notes—33 pages of them, providing a substantialscholarly infrastructure.Anumberofkey pointsare reiteratedsuf.cientlyin individualchapters so that manychapters can be used alone as readings for seminarsor courses. Hirthisclearonwayshedisagrees with otherestimates,de.nitions,and interpretationsin the literature,addingtotheusefulnessofthe book. 
The conceptual structure applied to the Aztec economy is the concern of chapter 2, following a chapter introducing the subject and place to orient readers. A fundamental distinction for Hirth is that between the domestic and institutional economies. Theinstitutional economyis further subdividedinto informal and formal components. The latter applies to society as a whole and includes tribute and labor service, forexample. Theinformalinstitutional econ­omy, de.ned as customary rules and expectations, usually without oversight, operates at the scale of lineage or community. Here there is room for some disagreementwith Hirth’sinterpretations,ifostensibly kin-orderedcorporategroups or associations operated with formalized procedures formembership, handling of resources,and decision making. Kinship links may play second .ddle or constitute .ctive or manipu­lated ties. Readers can consider the organizational formality of the long-distance merchants or suspect that urban calpulli as corporateland-holding units may have become more likeresidentialclassi.cations than kinshipgroupings. 
Chapter 3 characterizes Aztec marketplaces, the keyformalinstitutionfor marketexchanges.A con­sideration of market tax notes that it apparently varied across Mesoamerica; in the Aztec core,taxes supported the marketplace but did not result in sig­ni.cant accumulation of wealth by elites. Chapter 4 considersthe generalnatureofmercantile activity and entrepreneurialeffortsfor“pro.t”oradvantage. These concepts require careful dissection and attention to linguistic information, whichHirth provides. 
A noteworthy strength of the book is its atten­tion to the domestic economy and how it inter­faces with the marketplace. Hirth redresses the state-centric and elite-centric perspectives that have col­ored so much of our understanding of Mesoamerican economies. Household producer-sellers operated in considerable numbersin Aztec marketplaces.Chapter 5isdevoted to that subject.Chapter6 addressesthe subjectof professionalretailmerchants,including the articulationofmerchants with craftspersons who were sellers. 
Professional merchants who operated at long distances are scrutinized in chapter 7, which con­siders the confusion surrounding the Nahuatl term pochteca as it applied to professional merchants, not all of whom were vanguard merchants reaching distant lands. Examples of merchant communities and the relationship of long-distance merchants to the state are particularly interesting subjects. Hirth stresses that long-distance merchants faced elevated risks and required special organizational measures. The opportunity to accumulate riches in high-value transportable items became a point of tension with other centers of power and wealth in Aztec society, such as rulers, elite warriors, and landed nobility. Cleavages and competitions within ancient states and empires are a critical dynamic from a comparative perspective. 
Chapter8will prove particularlypivotalfor com­parative work, as it addresses the mechanics of Aztec commerce, starting with the fundamentals of an economy largely reliant on human transport. Bar­gaining, currency, brokers, andotherfactors(agents) are discussed, especially in relation to long-distance commerce. Loans and interest are other features of economic activity, but sales of land and wage labor were not active sectors of the economy, in contrast to marketplace exchanges of items and services. Hirth stresses the vigor and pervasiveness of mar­ketplace exchanges for households—the backbone of Aztec economy—although the marketplace trans­muted mundane andelite luxury items alike,aprocess facilitatedbymediaofexchange suchas cacao beans. 
Theconcluding chapterrepriseskey .ndings and situates the Aztecs within a framework suitable for comparison to other premodern societies. Hirth dis­cusses the use of cross-cultural perspectives; this discussionisbrief,andthe primarycomparisoniswith the well-documented historyofwestern Europe.There is little discussion of the history of Mesoamerican exchange or thevariabilitymentionedoccasionallyin earlierchapters.Nevertheless, the “leads” forfurther investigation are many: the roles of urban centers as loci forcrafts, theindicationthatcommerce beyond theempirewastransformingthe social rolesofMaya elites, the possibility that earlier Nahua migrations and

This beautifully illustratedvolume concernsoneofthe mostremarkable cachedepositsof ancientMesoamer­ica, Offering 4 from La Venta. Discovered in 1955, it features 16 standing human .gures in front of six miniaturestelae, clearly relatedtothenumerous green-stone celtsofLaVenta. All.gurines areexquisitely carved, giving the offering an immediate aura of value and preciousness, one of the central messages conveyed in this ancient and very enigmatic offering. 
Offering4was found duringa.eld project directed by Phillip Drucker and Robert Heizer and supported by a number of institutions in the United States, including theSmithsonian InstitutionofWashington, DC (Drucker et al., Excavations at LaVenta,Tabasco, 1955,1959).Asithappens,Offering4was discovered one afternoon during excavations adjacent to the NortheastPlatformofGroupA atLaVenta. Despite the late hour, it was imperative that the deposit be removed for safekeeping as soon as possible, since there was no security to ensure that they would remaininsituthefollowingday. Throughexcavations performed by the Mexican archaeologist Eduardo Contreras and Robert Heizer, the entire deposit was removed within the next several hours. This work was documented in extensive photos, notes, and .eld drawings.The amount of detail gleaned fromthe few hoursofdocumentationinthe presentvolumeis truly impressive, and re.ects the skill of Contreras and Heizerworking underextreme pressure.In1955, three of the16 statuettes weresentonloantothe National Museumof Natural Historyofthe Smithsonian.They werereturnedtothe Museo NacionaldeAntropología in2012andthe entireoriginalgroupwasputonpublic displayforthe.rsttimeinMexicoasthe “pieceofthe month”in Marchof the same year.This publication celebratesthe reunionof the.gures. 
Thevolume,byfar the mostdevelopeddiscussion of Offering 4, has three sections, dealing with the discoveryofthe cacheandits historysinceexcavation, technical aspects of the statuettes and celts, and detaileddescriptionand discussionofthe16statuettes. Sincethisisaneditedvolume with contributionsby various authors, thereare minor differences among the descriptions, such as whether there were one or two statuettesofjadeite (see pp. 21, 87, 104, 112) or in what way three or more of the miniature stelae celts mayhavebeen recycledfromapreviouslyworkedjade (pp. 21, 71, 86, 120).

The second section of the book begins with Olaf Jaime-Riverón’sdiscussionof thesix celtiform jades serving as “miniature stelae” in Offering 4.
