plots, and planting of annual crops represent only the initial phase of a long-term and highly productive cycle of forest farming. A geographic component of the forest farming system is recognized in the varying intensity of cultivation (the amount of time and labor invested) which decreases with distance from the primary residence. While the authors use the dichotomous terms “in.eld” and “out.eld” to contrast the intensity of management between “homegardens” (in.elds) and out.elds, they also refer to both home-gardens and surrounding management areas as “forest gardens.” While this can be somewhat confusing, the authors are trying to convey the continuous nature of controlled plant succession in both time and space. 
Chapter 3 revisits the paleoclimate record of the Maya Lowlands, highlighting the transition from the relatively stable, warm, and wet climate of the early Archaic period, to a period of “climatic chaos” that lasted from roughly 4,000 to 2,000 years ago, characterized by a .uctuating precipitation pattern that extended into the Maya Formative or Preclassic period. The development and growth of Maya culture during the Formative took place in the context of an unstable climate regime, and it was under these challenging conditions that the Maya developed and adapted a system of resilient forest management that set the stage for expansion and development during the more stable climatic conditions of the Classic period. The authors also explore the ongoing debate over the degree of deforestation versus forest management based on pollen evidence. They demonstrate the need for researchers to recognize that the vast majority of indigenous food plants, particularly hundreds of tree species, are essentially invisible in the pollen record, as they are not wind pollinated. 
Chapters 4 and 5 develop and discuss a speci.c model for Late Classic Maya agriculture, land use, and population levels, using archaeological and environ­mental data from Ford’s study area in the upper Belize River area, associated with the large civic-ceremonial center of El Pilar. They .nd that the suitability of land resources for agricultural production correlates strongly with settlement density. Settlement density is also assumed to correlate with land use intensity. Further modeling for estimated maize yields across the variable landscape, combined with the botanically diverse production of a forest garden system, would sustainably support the average of 137–142 persons per km2 estimated for the study area, while retaining a high degree of forest cover. 
Chapter 6, as a conclusion, returns to an expanded discussion of the degradation and commodi.cation of the milpa system under Colonial and post-Colonial economies. It also presents a hopeful scenario for the future of the Maya forest that recognizes the bene.ts of traditional knowledge applied to forest management, combined with enlightened perspectives on conservation ecology that recognize the human role in creating and maintaining a stable and productive forest for future generations. 
Overall, the book ful.lls a longstanding need to reevaluate the ecological relationship of the Maya people and the forest which they have managed and maintained over millennia. The book will be of interest to archaeologists and anthropologists, as well as conservation biologists, paleoclimatologists, and those concerned with development strategies in the tropics. After .nishing this book, most readers will .nd it dif.cult to maintain the hopefully outdated notion that the political and demographic disruptions of the Maya Terminal Classic period were caused by environmental degradation and agricultural collapse. My only real criticism of the book is that the authors did not attempt to expunge the conquistador-applied term of “milpa” from the modern, more ecologically enlightened perspective on Maya forest farming.

Time and theAncestors:Aztec and Mixtec Ritual Art, is not the sort of general overview of Postclassic period central and southern Mexican artwork that the book’s title might imply. Instead, it is something much more speci.c—it is a deep analysis of the meanings behind the artifacts included in one of the most spectacular .nds in Mesoamerican archaeology, namely Tomb 7 at the site of Monte Alban, Oaxaca. Nevertheless, the authors’ search for the meanings behind these objects leads them to make iconographic and thematic connections between the tomb offerings and a wide swath of prehispanic Mexican artworks, ranging from Preclassic monuments at Chalcatzingo to Aztec stone sculpture, and the Mixtec and Borgia group codices. As such, it makes for a much more interesting and inventive analysis for specialists in the .eld, while at the same time, it provides for more generalist readers detailed studies of a large number of the most famous artworks of Postclassic Mexico. It is an ambitious and highly interdisciplinary study, produced by two of the foremost experts in the subject.

LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 29, No. 2, 2018] 
The introduction provides a basic overview of the book’s subject matter and of the theoretical per­spectives the authors bring to the material. The .rst section offers a useful review of the mechanics of the Mesoamerican calendar. Discussion then moves on to the authors’ engagement with postcolonial theory from cultural studies generally. This theoretical approach is well deployed and articulated; however, the authors would have bene.ted from referencing studies in anthropology, art history, and ethnohistory that have similarly engaged this scholarship. As the chapter stands, the authors risk casting these disciplines as having gone virtually unchanged over the last 50– 100 years. 
The .rst section (Chapters 1–4) focuses largely on Tomb 7 at Monte Alban. The authors .rst discuss the archaeological context and build upon previous studies in demonstrating that the tomb, while .rst constructed and used during the Classic Period, was reused as a site of ancestor veneration during the Postclassic, when the bulk of the offerings and some of the human remains were deposited. It is clear that after its aban­donment, Monte Alban was still viewed as a sacred place corresponding to a previous age of creation, and the tomb was a symbolically powerful context in which rituals involving sacred bundles were carried out. To further contextualize matters, the authors then provide a rich analysis of what is known about Postclassic practices involving ancestor veneration and sacred bundles, primarily from the Mixtec codices and colonial ethnohistorical accounts. The discussion then moves to a detailed iconographic study of many of the artifacts in Tomb 7, with a focus on carved bone objects and gold ornaments, which complements and builds upon previous studies by Alfonso Caso and by Geoffrey McCafferty and Sharisse McCafferty. The authors connect iconographic elements of many ritual objects deposited in the tomb with scenes in the Mixtec codices, and make an intriguing argument that the cer­emonies carried out here were connected to the allied dynasties of Zaachila and Teozacoalco, involving both Zapotec and Mixtec ethnic groups. Further, because the Mixtec codices often depict temples with sacred bundles as containing .re drills as well, they argue that a number of these rituals would have been related to the New Fire ceremony, reenacting primordial creation. In an otherwise robust bibliography, a curious omission is the work of Byron Hammann, who has written extensively about the signi.cances of “pre-sunrise” objects and ruins for Mixtecs and Nahuas during the Postclassic. Engagement with this work would have complemented and bolstered the authors’ arguments. 
The second section (Chapters 5–8) is much wider ranging. Chapter 5 focuses on an important though lesser-known colonial manuscript from Oaxaca known as the Selden Roll. The authors’ analysis illustrates how this document depicts events of initial creation, and then a series of ritual acts which culminate with the establishment of the Coixtlahuaca dynasty, the latter event accompanied by a drilling of the New Fire. The authors thus argue that New Fire ceremonies were critical events that commemorated the establishment of dynasties in both the Coixtlahuaca Valley and at Zaachila/Monte Alban. An interesting parallel, not explicitly noted by the authors, is that in both cases these would have been rituals involving multiple ethnic groups—Mixtecs and Zapotecs in the latter, and Cho­chos, Mixtecs, and Nahuas (and possibly others), in the former. Chapter 6 provides a broader consideration of the signi.cance of the birth of the current sun for Mesoamerican peoples, primarily through an analysis of some of the most famous pieces of Aztec stone sculpture. Included in the authors’ review are the Calendar/Sun Stone, the Tlaltecuhtli sculpture from the Templo Mayor, the Stone of Tizoc, the Teocalli of Sacred War, and various others. In the last chapter, prior to a summary conclusion, the authors more deeply explore Mesoamerican ritual beliefs related to creation and the drilling of the New Fire through a detailed analysis of the enigmatic “temple scenes” found on pages 29–46 of the Codex Borgia.The book’s argument is brought together as the authors interpret these scenes as representing a series of rituals carried out over the course of the solar year, involving sacred bundles, ancestor veneration, and other rites, culminating in the New Fire ceremony, which, they argue, occurred similarly at Tomb 7 of Monte Alban. 
A number of editorial issues unfortunately detract from the book. Apart from myriad typos and spelling errors, other odd things appear in the text: for example, the exact same block quote from Torquemada appears twice within a span of eight pages. A more fundamen­tal issue is that, while the book is lavishly illustrated, none of the illustration numbers are referenced within the text. This often risks leaving readers confused when images are discussed in the text, as to whether they are in fact illustrated in the book, and if so, where. Brill Press would do well to invest more resources in copy editing. 
As in virtually any book of its length and scope, there are a number of arguments and interpreta­tions presented in Time and theAncestors that other scholars will disagree with and have disagreed with previously. The authors avoid a caustic tone in these cases, however, simply presenting their evidence and acknowledging other interpretations in the literature. Yet these debates do not really have impact on

the overarching arguments of the book. Indeed, the most signi.cant contributions of the book might be the very deep and rigorous analyses of practices of ancestor veneration that it provides. While the topic of ancestor veneration is rather well-trodden ground in Mesoamerican studies, it is one that inexorably continues to demand further examination, as it is simply so fundamental to indigenous cosmologies and worldviews and permeates so much of what we see in Mesoamerican religious iconography. The authors provide new and unique insights. As such, Time and the Ancestors will be of interest to a great number of specialists working on prehispanic Mesoamerica, and the wide array of important art objects that the book treats will make it appealing to readers with more general interest in the subject matter.

Golden Kingdoms: Luxury Arts in the Ancient Americas serves as the catalog to accompany a major exhibition of ancient American elite objects from the late second millennium BC to the arrival of the Europeans, and from the Andean region in the south to Mesoamerica in the north, with all areas in between. The catalog is divided into two roughly equal sections: 1) A set of 12 narrative chapters that treat different regions and their histories; 2) A catalog of the exhibition with extensive, well-documented entries for each of 229 objects. The exhibition was undertaken with the help of most major institutions in the origin countries, so that recent archaeological data and even recently excavated objects are incorporated throughout. 
The title highlights gold as the central luxury or prestige material, but the story told here is more complex. The text highlights the relationship of gold with other precious materials (especially feathers, shell, jade, and turquoise), which were combined in distinct permutations to form luxury object systems that transformed over time and across ancient Ameri­can space. Mapping the changes in luxury systems on a grand American scale is one of the more important contributions of this ambitious catalog. 
The move of gold from south to north, from the Andean region in the second millennium BC to Mesoamerica after AD 600, forms one important regional and chronological backbone of the catalog, as elegantly summarized in the introduction by Joanne Pillsbury and carried through in the essays by Blanca Maldonado (Early Andean and general metallurgi­cal techniques), Luis Jaime Castillo (Moche), Pills­bury (Andean Empires), María Alicia Uribe Villegas and Marcos Martinón Torres (Colombia), and John Hoopes (Isthmo-Colombian). 
An attention to the indigenous experience of these objects is maintained throughout the narrative and especially in the catalog section. The intimate scale of most luxury objects encouraged the indigenous viewer’s close relationship with artistry, which the authors regularly and effectively highlight in the catalog text. The modern reader greatly bene.ts from this attention to visual and even tactile experience. 
The essay by Hoopes on the Isthmo-Colombian region serves as a linchpin of the luxury materials narrative. In the north of this region (Costa Rica), the two great luxury materials, jade from the north and gold from the south, meet in the latter half of the .rst millennium AD. Importantly, the local history of jade working is well described before the author turns to the transition to gold as chief luxury material in the eighth century AD, thus giving a more grounded local context for the momentous shift. 
Following the Isthmo-Colombian essay, the nar­rative turns to jade and its central importance in Mesoamerica. For this, the text must return to the late second millennium BC and the Olmec practice of jade and greenstone celt deposition in sacred springs. The blue/green color of these jades and other greenstones was related to fresh growth, water, and fecundity in this region from this point forward. Laura Filloy Nadal gives a superb synthesis of jade’s central place in the region, wielding a large amount of technical data on the nature and source of the material developed over several innovative projects launched by Mexico’s national archaeological research institute. 
Stephen Houston’s essay plumbs Classic Maya thinking on the nature and value of jade and other luxury materials. The author points out that luxury objects were directly associated with the resplendent elite body. Luxury objects set apart the elite body from the common and linked it to forces coaxed from the rare material. Heirloom jewels once worn by important ancestors, real or imagined, were especially prized. 
The exhibition makes clear that jade and gold are critical to understanding luxury object systems, but they never exist in isolation. Adrián Velázquez Castro describes the sources and fabrication processes of high-value shell. The author suggests that the extinction of valuable Spondylus types from the coast of Ecuador and Peru led to trading farther north and
