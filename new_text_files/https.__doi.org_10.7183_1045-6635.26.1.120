NEW INSIGHTS INTO THE TIWANAKU STYLE OF SNUFF TRAYS 
FROM SAN PEDRO DE ATACAMA, NORTHERN CHILE

Snuff trays are conspicuous objects that are found in archaeological contexts throughout Andean South America. At San Pedro de Atacama, in northern Chile, snuff trays that exhibit iconographic motifs similar to those found on Tiwanaku mega­lithic monuments have been assigned to the Tiwanaku style. In the present work, we propose a new definition for this style based on the occurrence of three morphological features: an overall trapezoidal shape, incurving sides, and sharp top corners. This group includes trays with iconography from the previously defined Tiwanaku style, as well as other trays without iconography. Principal component analysis shows that Tiwanaku-style trays with and without iconography make up a single group that is significantly different from plain. largely rectangular San Pedro-style trays. The relative proportion 
of Tiwanaku-style trays with and without iconography does not differ 
between cultural periods and archaeological sites. The results point to shape as an important trait for assigning trays to styles. Furthermore, the results show that during the Middle period four main types of snuff trays were in use: Tiwanaku trays with and without iconography and local San Pedro trays, also with and without iconography. We explore the possible social implications of this co-occurrence of styles. 
Las tab/etas de inhalaci6n son objetos arqueol6gicos conspicuos de San Pedro de Atacama (norte de Chile); aquellas que exhiben motivos iconogrdficos inspirados en los monumentos megaUticos de Tiwanaku han sido adscritas al estilo Tiwanaku. En este trabajo se propone una nueva definici6n de este estilo que incluye la presencia simultanea en las tabletas de tres caracteres morfol6gicos: forma trapezoidal, lados aproximadamente hiperb6licos y esquinas superiores agudas. Este nuevo grupo de tab/etas incluye todas aquellas definidas previamente como de estilo Tiwanaku (con iconograffa) y agrega un conjunto de tab/etas sin iconograffa Tiwanaku. Un analisis de componentes principales mostr6 que las tab/etas de estilo Tiwanaku con y sin iconograffa constituyen un grupo unico, significativamente distinto de! grupo de tab/etas esencialmente rectangulares de estilo San Pedro. La proporci6n de tab/etas Tiwanaku con y sin iconograffa no difiri6 entre distintos perfodos culturales y distintos sitios arqueol6gicos. Los resultados seiialan que laforma es un criterio importante para la asignaci6n de las tab/etas de inhalaci6n a estilos. Adicionalmente, los resultados indican que durante el Perfodo Medio cuatro tipos de tab/etas fueron preferentemente empleados por la poblaci6n local: tab/etas de estilo Tiwanaku con y sin iconograffa y tab/etas de! estilo local San Pedro, tambien con y sin iconograffa. Exploramos posibles implicancias sociales que pueden inferirse a partir de esta coexistencia estilfstica.

between a diverse array of agro-pastoral com­munities. Different models have been proposed to explain the mechanism behind these interac­tions, including the "vertical archipelago" model (Murra 1972), the "altiplano model" (Browman 1980), and the "circuit mobility" model (NUfiez and Dillehay 1979). These models emphasize en­vironmental determinants and the economic need to access resources from different ecozones. Nonetheless, in the Andes, economic exchange was based on social relations and thus trade was part of a wider net of connections that included kin relations and political alliances among fami­lies, groups, and polities that were linked across the landscape. The movement of non-local objects and styles was the result of the operation of this social network, but at the same time it was a means through which the different interacting groups materialized and reproduced their collec­tive identities. In this context, prehistoric styles and their geographical distribution indicate not only interaction, but also changes through time in the social organization of the South-Central Andes. The Middle period is especially relevant because of the influence exerted by the Tiwanaku polity-possibly the first state society of the South-Central Andes-on a wide array of local communities, from Moquegua in the north to San Pedro de Atacama (SPA) in the south (see Figure 1; Stanish 2002). In fact, during this period, re­gionally shared icons occur throughout the area, suggesting some sort of religious integration; Is­bell (2008) refers to these shared icons as the Southern Andean Iconographic Series (SAIS). Tiwanaku influence on SPA has been the subject of much debate in the past (see, for example, Salazar et al. [2014] and references therein). To­day, most scholars agree that this influence was mostly ideological in character, as part of "clien­tist" or "hegemonic" strategies by the highland state, and that it was materialized by the distrib­ution of highly iconic objects, such as ritual para­phernalia decorated with a corporate style, in­cluding the SAIS (e.g., Berenguer 1998; Uribe and Agiiero 2004). Among these objects, wooden snuff trays played a prominent role (Berenguer 1998; Llagostera 2006; Torres 2001a). In this pa­per, we focus on wooden snuff trays from SPA and discuss their stylistic variability. We seek to understand the style to which undecorated trays 
can be attributed and the social significance of the coexistence of local and Tiwanaku styles within burials and cemeteries in SPA. 
San Pedro de Atacama and the Hallucinogenic Complex 
In South-Central Andean prehispanic societies, the consumption of hallucinogenic preparations in religious contexts was a common practice (Schultes et al. 1998). Hallucinogens, principally of plant origin, were mainly consumed by smok­ing, drinking, and taking snuff. The main para­phernalia associated with these respective activ­ities were smoking pipes, a type of drinking vessel called a kero, and snuff trays. Although all these different types of ritual paraphernalia have been found in SPA, they were not coeval. Ceramic pipes were common during the Late Formative period (ca. A.D. 100-400), but during the Middle period (A.D. 400-1000) they were gradually re­placed by wooden snuff trays, which were used until Inka times. Keros made of wood, ceramics, or metal are also associated with the Middle pe­riod, even though they appear during later periods as well. The circulation and use of these ritual objects was part of wider social relations that in­tegrated the local society of SPA with the rest of the South-Central Andes, where they have also been reported in the same time periods. As social fields changed through time in the region (e.g., Stovel 2008), so did this ritual paraphernalia. The appearance, disappearance, and relative abun­dance of pipes, snuff trays, and keros in local graves indicate significant transformations in rit­ual practices, as well as changes in the economic and social networks in which the local community was integrated. Interesting differences occur in the shape and decoration of these artifacts ­especially snuff trays-within each period. The coexistence of different styles suggests that ritual practices using snuff trays had different implica­tions or meanings and, furthermore, that the style of the trays conveyed information about social differences within the local community. There­fore, an analysis of changing patterns of stylistic distribution in snuff trays provides us with an op­portunity to better understand the social organi­zation of local communities in SPA and its rela­tion to the South-Central Andes as a whole. This

is especially the case when considering the re­gional presence of shared iconographic motifs before Tiwanaku influence (e.g., Isbell and Knobloch 2006), as well as the spread during the Middle period of a variable yet recognizable cor­porate style in distant provinces. SPA is a privi­leged place to accomplish such an analysis, since its small cluster of oases located in the hyperarid core of the Atacama Desert (Figures 1 and 2), more than 800 km from the Tiwanaku heartland, played a key role in regional interaction since the Formative period (e.g., Nufiez and Dillehay 1979; Tarrag6 1984, 1989) and developed strong links to the Tiwanaku state during the Middle pe­riod (Berenguer and Dauelsberg 1989; Thomas et al. 1984). Besides, being situated in one of the driest deserts of the world allows for exceptional preservation of archaeological materials, includ­ing wooden objects such as the snuff trays (Berenguer 2004; Blanchette et al. 1990). 
Snuff trays are among the most conspicuous objects found in funerary contexts in SPA, espe­cially during the Middle and Late Intermediate periods (A.D. 1000-1450). Although a few stone and bone snuff trays have been found, the vast majority of them are made of wood. An exami­nation of snuff trays available from SPA shows enormous variability in size, shape, structural complexity, type of decoration, and iconographic motifs (Torres 1987a). Numerous studies have addressed this variability, particularly in trays which contain stylistic elements of the SAIS­which most scholars still refer to as "Tiwanaku style" because of the presence of icons found on the megalithic monuments of the great highland capital (Baron 1984; Berenguer 1985, 1987, 1998, 2001; Latcham 1938; Llagostera 1995, 2001, 2006; Llagostera et al. 1988; Looser 1926; Loza 2007; Mostny 1968-1969; Nufiez 1963; Oyarzun 1931; Serracino 1980; Thomas and Benavente 1984; Thomas et al. 1984, 1985; Torres 1984, 1986, 1987a, 1987b, 1998,200la,2001b,2004; Torres and Conklin 1995; Uhle 1913, 1915; Wassen 1965, 1972). Other trays lacking elements of the SAIS have traditionally been referred to as non-Tiwanaku-style trays and have received much less attention, even though they make up nearly 90 percent of the collection (Llagostera 1995; Torres 1984, 1986; Uhle 1913). Scholars studying these latter trays have mainly proposed 
features characterizing a style different from Ti­wanaku and have described its geographical dis­tribution and chronology (Hermosilla 2001; Krapovickas 1958-1959; Llagostera 1995, 2001; Llagostera et al. 1988; Nufiez 1963; Thomas and Benavente 1984; Torres 1986). Recently, one of us has undertaken a thorough study of trays avail­able at the local SPA museum and several muse­ums worldwide. She has defined the Circum­punefio (Horta 2012) and the San Pedro (Horta 2014) styles for many trays lacking Tiwanaku iconography. The Circumpunefio style includes volumetrically carved anthropomorphic and zoomorphic figures performing ceremonial ac­tivities and has been dated to the Late Intermedi­ate period. In contrast, the San Pedro style may depict volumetrically carved human figures or appear as undecorated, largely rectangular trays dated to the Late Formative, Middle, and Late Intermediate periods. Nearly half of the presently known snuff trays lack iconography and volu­metric carvings (i.e., they are plain snuff trays) and have therefore been difficult to assign to par­ticular styles. The present work builds on pre­liminary observations that some of these plain snuff trays show a close morphological resem­blance to those with Tiwanaku iconography (Fig­ure 3; Berenguer 1987:50-51, note 5; 1993:61, note 11; 1998:31; 2001:80, note 4) and could therefore be considered part of that style. If this turned out to be the case, then the number of Ti­wanaku trays currently known from SPA would increase significantly, suggesting that the highland state played an important role in the introduction of snuff-taking practices and possibly in the dis­appearance of local smoking rituals. 
In this paper, we follow these insights to pro­pose a new and broader definition of the Ti­wanaku style to include undecorated snuff trays with an overall trapezoidal shape, incurving sides, and sharp top corners. A number of statistical tests show that such trays with and without Ti­wanaku iconography indeed correspond to a sin­gle distinct set, and further that Tiwanaku-style trays without iconography are different from the similar largely rectangular trays previously as­signed to the San Pedro style. 
Based on the assumption that styles are ways of doing that should show regular spatial and temporal structures (Davis 1990), we studied the

wanaku-style objects should co-occur within a given cultural period (particularly the Middle pe­riod). At the same time, assuming that Tiwanaku trays with and without iconography may have had different social connotations in the past, we reconstructed contextual associations in burials in order to determine whether social differences, measured as the contextual diversity and relative presence of prestige items in individual tombs, could explain stylistic differences. Finally, we sought to determine possible differences in the origin of raw materials employed in the manu­facture of trays and to assess whether eventual differences correlated to style. 
Materials and Methods 
Objects Studied 
The basis for this study was the set of wooden snuff trays found in cemeteries in the Salar de Atacama area (Catarpe, Coyo, Quitor, Sequitor, Solcor, Solor, Tchecar, Tchilimoya, Toconao, and Yaye; see Figure 2). In all cases, the artifacts come from cemeteries with similar burial patterns that were in use throughout the Late Formative, Middle, and Late Intermediate periods (Le Paige 1964; Torres-Rouff 2008). The chronology of these cemeteries is difficult to assess because most of them were occupied during two or even three consecutive cultural periods. Contextual as­sociations were used to assign single tombs to specific cultural phases. The final set studied con­sisted of 568 snuff trays. While most trays could be directly examined at the Instituto de Investi­gaciones Arqueol6gicas y Museo R.P. Gustavo Le Paige S.J. (IIAM), 28 trays were analyzed through photographs or drawings from the liter­ature. 
The morphological features shared by trays with Tiwanaku (TIW) iconography were first de­termined. Such features were: (1) trapezoidal shape (i.e., trays wider at the top than at the bot­tom), (2) incurving sides, and (3) sharp top cor­ners (Figure 4). Trays without iconography, rang­ing from largely rectangular to trapezoidal in shape, were then examined for the occurrence of the features listed above. Trays exhibiting those three features were assigned to the Tiwanaku style, and those that did not were assigned to the San Pedro style. Figure 5 illustrates some San Pedro-style trays and indicates those features that distinguish them from Tiwanaku-style trays with­out iconography. 
The morphological features described above were then quantitatively assessed as follows, us­ing the measurements labeled in Figure 4: (1) trapezoidal shape as [(a -b) I d]; (2) incurving of sides as (c Id); (3) and sharpness of top corners as (e Id). Morphological data were then analyzed by principal component analysis (PCA) to assess whether Tiwanaku-style trays with and without iconography could be considered a homogeneous set and whether the set of Tiwanaku-style trays without iconography was distinguishable from the set of plain San Pedro-style trays. Maha­lanobis distances, including principal components with eigenvalues larger than one, were used to discriminate between the three sets of trays (Hua and Wiens 2009). Comparisons were performed between the centroids of Tiwanaku-style snuff trays with and without iconography and those of trays assigned to the San Pedro style. In each case, a non-parametric analysis of variance (ANOVA) tested for significance of differences between styles.

Figure 4. Drawing of a Tiwanaku-style snuff tray indicat­ing morphological parameters measured. 
Finally, a second PCA involving additional morphological tray features was performed in or­der to judge the importance of the three morpho­logical features described above in distinguishing between styles. The following parameters were calculated (see Figure 4): (4) curvature of top side, defined as [1 -(j I d)]; (5) length of panel relative to length of receptacle, defined as (g I h); 
(6) thickness of lower border of receptacle relative to length of tray, defined as [(d -g -h) Id]; (7); width of receptacle relative to length of tray, de­fined as (i I d); and (8) thickness of sides of re­ceptacle relative to length of tray, defined as (j I d). The values of parameter h were determined as the mean of three measurements taken on the left side, center, and right side of the receptacle; values of the parameter j were similarly determined as the mean of four measurements taken at the top and bottom of both sides of the receptacle. 
Our analysis allowed for a total of 120 trays (57 with iconography and 63 without) to be as­signed to the Tiwanaku style (Table 1). Measure­ment of all quantitative features was possible in only 102 of these trays (43 with iconography and 59 without); the remaining trays were either poorly preserved or, being physically absent from the collection, could not be properly measured from field notes or graphical representations. The group of San Pedro-style trays consisted of 100 artifacts. The morphological features defined above could be measured for 94 of them. 
Association of Trays with 
Cultural Periods and Funerary Context 
In the absence of direct dates for snuff trays exca­
vated from SPA oases, chronology was inferred from contextual associations in tombs, mostly based on the styles of pottery accompanying the trays (Berenguer et al. 1986; Stovel 2013; Tarrag6 1968, 1989) and a few radiocarbon dates (Llagostera et al. 1988). It was possible to assign 67 Tiwanaku­style trays (29 trays with iconography and 38 with­out) to a cultural period (Table 1). 
The descriptions of funerary offerings associ­ated with the trays were obtained from the original excavation notes of Father Gustavo Le Paige. Such descriptions were found for only 100 Tiwanaku­style trays (Table 1); the tombs corresponded to individual burials in 59 cases and to multiple buri­als (2 to 15 individuals) in 41 cases. The objects accompanying the snuff trays in the tombs were very diverse, including the following: ceramic ob­jects, bowls, vases, textiles, headdresses, spindles, threaders, needles, hole punchers, pigments, bas­kets, boxes, bows, arrow points, arrow shafts, axes, mallets, chisels, tweezers, spoons, vegetable residues, squashes, urns, snails, animal bones, flutes, necklaces, bracelets, rings, metal or gem­stone ornaments, gemstone beads, and comple­mentary snuff-taking paraphernalia (snuff tubes, spatulas, small mortars and pestles, and snuff-pow­der containers). Two quantitative approaches were used to infer the relative status of the burials con­taining wooden snuff trays: a diversity index that considered the number of types of objects found within the burials, and the occurrence in the tomb of metal objects such as axes, mallets, tweezers, bracelets and rings, taken as a proxy for social sta­tus of the individual interred (Llagostera et al. 1988; Salazar et al. 2014; Tamblay 2004). Other prestige items-such as decorated pottery vessels, keros, and imported textiles -were too scarce to be incorporated into quantitative analyses.

Origin of Snuff Tray Wood 
Recent studies have addressed the origin of wood species used in the manufacture of snuff trays from SPA (Niemeyer 2013; Niemeyer et al. 2013; Riquelme 2012; Riquelme and Niemeyer 2014). Two groups of wood species were defined on the basis of density measurements: wood with den­sities between .46 and .73 g/cm3 (the range of native species) and wood with densities beyond this range (corresponding to species found outside SPA) (Niemeyer et al. 2013). 
Further Statistical Analyses 
A multiple proportions test was used to compare the distribution of trays with and without Tiwanaku iconography in terms of sites, cultural periods, type of wood, and presence of metal objects. At­test was used to compare the number of object types in tombs with single individuals containing Tiwanaku trays with and without iconography. 
Results 
In the PCA using three morphological features, one principal component with an eigenvalue larger than one (1.803) captured 60.09 percent of total variance. In the PCA using eight morphological features, three principal components with eigen­values larger than one (2.738, 1.417, and 1. 155) captured 66.38 percent of total variance. The first principal component captured 34.23 percent of total variance, the second 17 .71 percent, and the third 14.44 percent. In the PCA using the complete set of morphological features, the three features used to define the Tiwanaku style contributed the most to the first principal component-that is, that which explains the highest percentage of the variance (see key to Figure 6). This strongly sug­gests that these three variables are necessary and sufficient to define the Tiwanaku style. The Kruskal-Wallis test on Mahalanobis distances (Figure 6) supports the proposal that Tiwanaku-

style trays with and without iconography conform to a single group that differs from the largely rec­tangular San Pedro-style trays. Thus,p-values for the 3-and 8-variable PCAs using the three cen­troids were all less than .001. Tiwanaku-sty le trays with and without iconography did not differ sig­nificantly and San Pedro-style trays differed sig­nificantly from Tiwanaku-style trays in all but one case. This exception occurred when distances to the centroid for the San Pedro style were con­sidered, in which case the three types of trays dif­fered significantly from each other (Figure 6). Nonetheless, p-values for pairwise comparisons were .020, less than .0000, and less than .0000 for Tiwanaku-with iconography vs. Tiwanaku­without iconography, San Pedro vs. Tiwanaku­with iconography, and San Pedro vs. Tiwanaku­without iconography, respectively. This suggests that even in this case there is a trend, albeit non­significant, for Tiwanaku-with iconography trays to resemble the Tiwanaku-without iconography ones, and for both Tiwanaku trays to differ from 
the San Pedro-style trays. 
Sixty-seven Tiwanaku-style trays with and 
without iconography could be assigned to the fol­
lowing cultural periods: Late Formative or Middle

periods (25 trays), Middle period (39 trays), and Late Intermediate period (3 trays). Considering that some pottery styles occur during both the Late Formative and the Middle periods, it was not always possible to separate them. Further­more, even though Tarrag6 (1989) has identified associations between Tiwanaku materials and Rojo Pulido ceramics (considered a Formative ware), recent research by Stovel (2013) using ra­diocarbon dating from tombs containing Rojo Pulido ceramics demonstrates that this type was 
still in use during the Middle period. Therefore, 
it cannot be argued that Tiwanaku-style iconog­
raphy is earlier in SPA that in the heartland, as 
Isbell and Knobloch (2006) contend. On the con­
trary, available radiocarbon dates and cultural as­
sociations indicate that most Tiwanaku-style trays 
were found in tombs from the Middle period, 
when Tiwanaku influence in SPA was at its peak 
(Berenguer and Dauelsberg 1989; Llagostera 
2004; Thomas et al. 1985). A multiple proportions 
test showed that the proportion of Tiwanaku-style 
trays with and without iconography did not differ 
significantly between cultural periods (x2 = .0067; 
df = 2; p = .997), so the two variants seem to be 
coeval.

Figure 6. Principal component analysis: (a-d) using only the three main features used to define the Tiwanaku style, and (e-h) using all eight morphological parameters defined in Materials and Methods. In sections (a) and (e) the following symbols were used: 0 = Tiwanaku trays with iconography; 1::.. = Tiwanaku trays without iconography; • = San Pedro trays. Coordinates for principal component 1 were -.843, -.813, and .657 for section a, and -.730, -.742, .656, .541, -.629, .406, -.250 and .554 for section b, for the morphological features taken in the same order given in Materials and Methods, respectively. Coordinates for principal component 2 were -.221, -.376, and -.750 for section a, and .048, .309, .558, -.674, A30, .205, A99, and -.279 for section b, for the morphological features taken in the same order given in Materials and Methods, respectively. Box plots (b-d) and ( e-h): Mahalanobis distances from centroids of Tiwanaku-style trays with (sec­tions b and f) and without iconography (sections c and g), and plain San Pedro-style trays (sections d and h). Results of Kruskall-Wallis AN OVA are shown with letters above the bars: different letters indicate significant differences (p < .05). The boundary of the box closest to zero indicates the twenty-fifth percentile, the solid line within the box shows the median, the dashed line within the box shows the mean, the boundary of the box farthest from zero indicates the sev­enty-fifth percentile, the whiskers (error bars) above and below the box indicate the ninetieth and tenth percentiles and the black circles are outliers. 
Of the 120 snuff trays identified as Tiwanaku in style, only 111 can be assigned to an archaeo­logical site (54 of the trays with iconography and 57 without; see Table 1). Information on the other 9 trays has disappeared. A multiple proportions test showed that the proportion of trays with and without iconography did not differ significantly between sites (x2 = 18.39; df= l7;p = .365). The co-occurrence of Tiwanaku-style trays with and without iconography could also be shown within tombs belonging to the same period at certain sites (Table 2). Nonetheless, since cultural periods correspond to broad time ranges, a further com­parison was performed within multiple and indi-

victual tombs. In one such case, a Tiwanak:u-style tray with iconography co-occurred with one with­out iconography: trays IIAM 372 and IIAM 214, which were found in Cayo Oriente tombs 4049­4050, containing two individuals (Figure 7). 
Wood density of 53 Tiwanak:u-style trays (20 with iconography and 33 without; see Table 1) was extracted from the literature (Niemeyer 2013; Niemeyer et al. 2013). A multiple proportions test showed that the proportion of trays with and without iconography did not differ significantly

(x2 = .362; df= l;p = .548). 
Trays are often accompanied by other snuff­tak:ing paraphernalia, such as snuff tubes. A study was performed on the style of trays accompanying tubes decorated with Tiwanaku iconography (15 cases). In nine cases, the accompanying trays ex­hibited Tiwanak:u style with iconography; in four cases, the style of the tray was not clearly defin­able; and in two cases a Tiwanak:u-style tray with­out iconography accompanied a tube with Ti­wanaku iconography. In one of these latter cases, a second tray in plain San Pedro style also ac­companied the tube (Figure 8). 
The context of 100 Tiwanak:u-style trays (50 with iconography and 50 without) could be traced, and the diversity index and proxy for wealth status of each funerary offering could be evaluated. The diversity index for tombs in which a single indi­vidual was interred was not affected significantly by presence or absence of iconography in the Ti­wanak:u-style trays found in the tomb (t test: t = ­.203; df = 57; P = .840). Metal objects were sim­ilarly associated with trays with and without iconography (x2 = 1.329; df = 1; p = .249). 
Discussion 

The comparison of data for Tiwanak:u-style snuff trays with and without iconography by PCA, fol­lowed by ANOVA of Mahalanobis distances, shows that the two sets of trays are not distinct in terms of the measured morphological features. Moreover, the analyses showed statistically sig­nificant differences between plain, largely rec-

tangular San Pedro-style trays and Tiwanaku­style trays. Multiple proportions tests and tray counts show that the proportions of both Ti­wanaku subsets did not differ between cultural periods and in several instances they co-occur under comparable spatiotemporal circumstances. Taken together, these results strongly support the original proposal that the trapezoidal-incurving shape (Berenguer 1987:50-51, note 5, 1993:61, note 11) and sharp top comers are key features of the Tiwanaku style and suggest that shape, in addition to iconography and its vast array of sym­bols (Llagostera 2006; Torres 1984, 1986, 1987b, 2001a, 2004), may be an important way of con­veying information on the origin and meaning of the object and its carrier, especially in visual sys­tems not relying on written communication, such as was the case in the Andes. For example, it is well known that during Inka times the trapezoidal shape was emblematic for the Tawantinsuyu, and was systematically used by the state in architec­ture and metal objects. Horta (2008) suggests that trapezoidal and circular metal emblems worn on the forehead of Inka nobles served as symbols of the lower and higher moieties of the Capac Ayllu of Cuzco. Therefore, our results are supported by other archaeological cases in the Andes and indicate that shape was indeed an important vari­able of the style of snuff trays. Through such for­mal variation, social information was conveyed (e.g.,Hegmon 1992; Wobst 1977). This informa­tion was probably of an "iconological" (Sackett 1990) or even an "emblemic" (Wiessner 1983) character, inasmuch as the shape of the snuff trays would have informed social agents in the past if the object was affiliated with Tiwanaku or with a local tradition. 
Tiwanaku-style snuff trays in SPA are more common than previously thought, particularly dur­ing the Middle period, when they make up nearly 50 percent of the total. Therefore, even though snuff-taking practices in SPA may have begun

during the Late Formative period (Llagostera 2004), the ubiquity of Tiwanaku trays suggests that the highland state played an important role in the increase of snuff-taking (Berenguer 1998) and the abandonment of the traditional use of pipes during the Middle period (e.g., Llagostera 2004; Thomas et al. 1984). A similar situation has been observed in the Middle period with the state-sup­ported increased use of keros both in the Tiwanaku heartland (e.g., Bandy 200 1) and in distant provinces such as Arica, in northern Chile (e.g., Berenguer and Dauelsberg 1989). These changes reflect deeper transformations in ritual practices stimulated by Tiwanaku, which affiliated some individuals to the state through the use of ritual objects with a corporate style. The latter included the trapezoidal-incurving shape introduced by Ti­wanaku in the snuff trays of SPA. This shape may have occurred sporadically before the Middle pe­riod, but it is under the Tiwanaku influence that the use of this shape in objects with religious con­notations became particularly frequent, not only in SPA but in many regions under the direct in­fluence of the highland state (Alcalde 1995; Cha­cama 2001; de la Vega et al. 2002; Garcia and Bustamante 1990; Llagostera 2001; Loza 2007; Rendon 2000; Wassen 1972). It is likely that SPA imported trays with this shape from Tiwanaku, but when it came to producing their own trays, either with exogenous or local materials, local craftsmen produced trays with distinct morpho­logical features. These trays were in the plain San Pedro style; some resemble the Tiwanaku-style trays without iconography but exhibit distinctive shape patterns, while others clearly departed from such canon by incorporating human, zoomorphic, and anthropomorphic figures on the panel. Nearly 15 percent of the trays corresponding to the Mid­dle period in SPA do not correspond either to the Tiwanaku or the SPA styles. Nonetheless, most of these trays could be the product of individual agency, errors in reproduction, and technological or temporal variability of the Tiwanaku or the SPA styles. At most five of the total universe of trays currently assigned to the Middle period clearly belong to other, not yet defined, styles, but their precise chronological position within the Middle period remains uncertain. Therefore, we may conclude that during the Middle period al­most all snuff trays deposited in mortuary contexts 
were associated with one of the four different groups mentioned above: Tiwanaku with and with­out iconography and SPA with and without iconography. 
The corporate styles in the SPA trays expressed differences between their bearers in terms of re­lationships and affiliations with Tiwanaku state ideology. The fact that Tiwanaku-style trays co­existed with decorated and undecorated trays in the local style suggests that a complex scenario of social differences operated during the Middle period in SPA. 

A consideration of the historical context in SPA at the time of Tiwanaku influence may clarify the social implications of this pattern of stylistic coexistence. Beginning during the Late Formative period, but especially during the Middle Period, the standardized production of local pottery styles (Stovel 2002, 2005; Tarrag6 1976, 1989), the ho­mogeneity of mortuary ritual and cranial defor­mation (Torres-Rouff 2007, 2008), as well as a characteristic textile decoration and technology (Aguero 2000, 2003), indicate a strong local so­cial identity and group cohesion in SPA (Berenguer and Dauelsberg 1989; Salazar et al. 20 14; Tarrag6 1989; Torres-Rouff 2007). Nonetheless, during the Middle period, SPA so­ciety also showed significant internal social dif­ferences both within and between the different cemeteries, as seen in the differential distribution of prestige objects in individual tombs and dif­ferences in health conditions (Berenguer and Dauelsberg 1989; Llagostera 1995, 2006; Llagostera et al. 1988; Thomas et al. 1984; Tor­res-Rouff 2008, 2011). Previous research has also shown an increase in osteological markers of vi­olence during the Middle period, as compared to previous moments (Torres-Rouff and Costa 2006), as well as significant differences in injury patterns and frequency between cemeteries with more or with less Tiwanaku influence and overall wealth (Torres-Rouff 2011). 
Even thoughthe use of snuff increased during the Middle period, the different styles in which the snuff trays were manufactured could have emphasized the internal divisions and different social affiliations that coexisted within the local community. Accordingly, it could be hypothesized that Tiwanaku-style trays with iconography are more frequent in the funerary offerings of higher-

status individuals in view of the additional artisan skills necessary for their production, which would have enhanced their material value, and also the potentially richer symbolic message they con­veyed through state iconography (Isbell 2008). Nonetheless, the data reported here do not support this hypothesis. The diversity of objects in burials, as well as the frequency of status-related metal objects within them, did not differ between tombs containing Tiwanaku-style trays with iconography and those lacking iconography. 
The question of the relative value of trays with and without iconography may also be examined from the point of view of the provenance of the wood used in their manufacture, under the hy­pothesis that trays with iconography were im­ported from Tiwanaku, whereas trays without iconography could have been produced locally. The data reported herein do not support this. Moreover, a recent study identifying the wood of a small set of snuff trays included two Ti­wanaku-style trays. with iconography and two without (Riquelme and Niemeyer 2013). In both groups, one tray was made with foreign wood, most likely from rain and montane forests close to Tiwanaku, and another with wood that may be of local origin (the two species involved do grow in SPA but show a wide distribution within the southern half of South America). 
Our data thus show that the different styles of snuff trays found in SPA during the Middle period were not associated with political or status differ­ences. On the one hand, the increased frequency of snuff-taking paraphernalia indicates that ritual prac­tices associated with them were accessible to more members of the community during the Middle pe­riod, as compared, for example, with the previous use of smoking pipes (Thomas et al. 1984). The increase in snuff use probably created bonds be­tween individuals of the local community who par­ticipated in them, as well as between these indi­viduals and other polities, including the Tiwanaku state, where similar rituals occurred. On the other hand, Tiwanaku-style trays are not always associ­ated with prestige objects or with graves with abun­dant offerings. Some Tiwanaku trays were even found in graves with no other or with very few other associated objects, while some tombs with metal objects and prestige items lack snuff trays altogether. Nevertheless, we cannot rule out the possibility that, if other proxies for status are con­sidered in the future, a different scenario may emerge. In any case, it is relevant to consider alter­native social implications for the stylistic variability in snuff trays observed during the Middle period. 
Results presented in this paper show that at least two styles, each with two subvarieties, co­existed during the Middle period. These styles were organized according to two sets of binary oppositions: local vs. non-local and with iconog­raphy vs. without it. This of course does not mean that the users of Tiwanaku-style trays were them­selves foreigners. In fact, these trays appear asso­ciated with local offerings, in burials in the local fashion, and usually with individuals with cranial deformation in the "local style" (Salazar et al. 2014). Nonetheless, regardless of the symbolic meaning of these styles, their use must have cre­ated different personal affiliations, with some local individuals being recognized as affiliated with the Tiwanaku state and some others with the local SPA tradition. Additional differences may have been signaled by the presence or absence of iconography. It is interesting to consider the pos­sibility that individual owners of snuff trays could have been recognized as affiliated with one of these four stylistic subgroups, since different styles of trays do not coexist within individual tombs, except for the case of collective burials. 
Even though it is certainly not the only expla­nation, one possible line of interpretation is that these four stylistic sub-varieties were emblemic symbols of four different social groups forming part of the local community. If this interpretation is correct, then we should conclude that social differences signaled by the style of snuff trays were not materialized through the spatial dispo­sition of the burials or oases (Thomas and Mas­sone 1988), because individuals affiliated with each group appear in all cemeteries. On the con­trary, this hypothetical social organization would have linked individual families and lineages of the different oases into a more encompassing so­cial structure that ultimately constituted the "local community." Certainly, further research is re­quired to test these suppositions. But this line of inquiry seems to have potential. The fact that at least two of the social segments of the local com­munity were affiliated with Tiwanaku would in­dicate that Tiwanaku influence in SPA was not

only ideological and religious, as the clientist or hegemonic model would have it (e.g., Berenguer 1998; Uribe and Agilero 2004), nor strictly eco­nomic, as the circuit mobility or the altiplano model would suggest (e.g., Berenguer and Dauelsberg 1989; Browman 1980; Ntifiez and Dillehay 1979), but that it also significantly trans­formed the local social organization as a result of the integration of San Pedro de Atacama com­munities into the political structure of Tiwanaku.
