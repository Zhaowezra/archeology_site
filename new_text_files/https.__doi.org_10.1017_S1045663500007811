
THE TYPE:VARIETY-MODE SYSTEM: DOOMED TO SUCCESS 
Richard E. W. Adams 
This commentary is in response to the critique by Culbert and Rands (2007), and points out that the Type: Variety-Mode ceramic analysis system has been quite successful when used correctly. 
Este comentario es una respuesta al articulo de Culbert y Rands (2007), y documenta el exito de la sistema de ana/isis ceram­ica Tipo: Variedad-Modal, cuando estd aplicada correctamente. 
he following is a selective commentary on Tthe Culbert and Rands (2007) article regard­ing ceramic analysis in the Maya Lowlands. In a brilliant series of coauthored and single­authored articles of the 1950s and 1960s, James C. Gifford outlined and demonstrated the utility of a system that he developed for ceramic analysis in the Maya Lowlands: the Type:Variety-Mode system (hereafterT:V-M; Gifford 1960). The system is ulti­mately derived from extensive and intensive expe­rience in the analysis of the complex pottery of the U.S. Southwest (Wheat et al. 1958). Unfortunately, Gifford died before publishing his masterwork in this effort, Ceramics of Barton Ramie. However, Carol Gifford and a group of dedicated scholars fin­ished and published the work inl976 (Gifford 1976). Recently, Culbert and Rands (2007) criti­cized the T:V-M system as too comprehensive and unfocused and characterize it as a failure in the attempt to produce standardized descriptive group­ings when actually it is not the system but its appli­cation that has fostered discontent. They claim that in many cases, data that might be valuable for com­parisons or other purposes are lost in the descrip­tive format. They propose that the T: V-M system continue to be used, but along with form, paste, and other analyses. They say that such parallel or alter­native analyses would avoid the loss of information. In fact, Gifford, early in his presentation of the Type: Variety-Mode system, advocated the supple­mentary use of modal analyses of various kinds. This advocacy is later and succinctly stated (Gif­ford 1976:41-42). Although the major emphasis in the definition of types and varieties is based on sur­face treatment, it is because that is the attribute that is most culturally defined and influenced. Paste is greatly dependent on the clay and trace elements available locally, and therefore is partially a prod­
uct of natural elements that often were unknown and uncontrolled in prehistory. Paste analysis is also time consuming and therefore the sample sizes are miniscule and spotty in geographic distribution. Form is indeed sensitive to changes in time, but this already had been demonstrated by Robert Smith in his studies of the pottery of Uaxactun (1955). Gif­ford advised that form should therefore be one of the modal analyses always used to supplement Type: Variety analysis. As Gordon R. Willey often said, archaeology is constantly juggling time, space, and data. Form certainly handles the first of these elements readily, but not exclusively. Gif­ford's scheme makes a combination of these observable elements (attributes) possible, and, lest we lose sight of it, more closely reflects our recog­nition that the concept of the potter (or potters) was the manufacture of a whole vessel. 
Gifford and his colleagues intended that the T:­V-M system would produce reasonably standard­ized comparative units (Types and Varieties). The system has produced great success in this effort.

COMMENT 223 

Good examples are those of Sierra Red: Sierra Vari­ety, or Saxche Orange-polychrome: Saxche Vari­ety. These are now well known, well recognized, and useful comparative units. 
Each site, and therefore, each ceramic analysis varies from others, because of differences in preser­vation, sample size, nature of the site (e.g., farm­stead versus urban center), and other factors. It has been informally estimated that a five-season pro­ject working at a medium-sized Maya Low land site will only sample 3 to 5 percent of the theoretical total deposits at the site. From personal experience at Altar de Sacrificios, Rio Azul, Becan, and Colha, this estimate seems about right. 
At Palenque, poor preservation led Rands to a modal study emphasizing shape. At Tikal the enor­mous sample sizes led Culbert to selective analy­ses in which he dealt mainly with whole vessels from tombs. Unfortunately, some scholars have dodged the hard work of sherd by sherd establish­ment of varieties and types by starting at the Group level. In reality, the Ceramic Group is a synthesis that is a product of analysis and comparative stud­ies. In these cases, therefore, the ceramists are really dependent on the previous work of others. This is satisfactory for comparative purposes, but biases the new ceramic study toward that previous work instead of establishing it as an independent sequence. This unwillingness to deal with the tough job of classification of thousands of sherds has also led to the use of sources such as Gifford's Barton Ramie work (1965, 1976) as a sort of encyclope­dia to be used uncritically. This was not Gifford's intention, inasmuch as he meant for the Type:­Variety-Mode system to be one that was ever expanding, self-correcting, and always leading to new insights. 

In sum, a major task for a field archaeologist is to present huge amounts of data in a synthesized and coherent fashion. This is especially the case with an area like the Maya Lowlands, which is one of the world's zones of greatest ceramic complex­ity. A further task that the field archaeologist con­fronts is to produce analytical units that have comparative value. The T:V-M system continues to function admirably for these purposes. Modal studies are essential to expand information, but they are of the most use for eliciting cultural per­ceptions when they are incorporated into and part of a unified comprehensive ceramic analysis like Type: Variety-Mode and not fragmented from it.
