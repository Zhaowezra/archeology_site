Faced with LAA's limited length, I have waited to occupy the first two pages of an issue with a combination of information and rumination until the pile of concerns reached appropriate size. That moment is now upon us. 
PLANTING A SEED 
I begin with what is unquestionably the most important matter in this assemblage. LAA came 
into being to serve as a means of communication among Latin Americanists, and figures (see below) 
show that as regards the number and geographic range of submissions the journal is doing its job 
quite well. Distribution statistics unfortunately reveal a very different picture: our mailing is now 
about 1,050, an impressive number for so young a publication, but only 107 go to Latin America, 
and 40 percent of this figure is represented by Mexico alone. This tells us that although Latin 
American authors see LAA as an attractive outlet for their work, the current special "Group B" rate 
has not been low enough to permit many of them, or even their institutions, to subscribe. A recent 
event has, however, begun a happy solution to this vexatious problem. 
At the end of the business meeting at the 1994 SAA Annual Meeting in Anaheim, California, one of the evening's speakers, Constance Werner Ramirez, responded to my woeful report on LAA's distribution by giving me a check for a subscription for a Peruvian scholar, with a promise to continue the support in years to come. If this seed grows into a plant that comprises just over 10 percent of LAA's North American subscribers, we'll double the list for Latin America and be well on our way to making LAA the full medium of scholarly interchange it is intended to be. Changes in membership categories mean that for 1995 only, subscriptions (which now include the SAA Bulletin) will be available solely for institutions, at $25.00, an investment many of us can surely afford and one that will bear dividends of guaranteed breadth and durability. Checks in U.S. funds drawn on a U.S. bank, payable to the Society for American Archaeology, should be sent to our Wahington office. Those who have special connections with a Latin American institution should ·designate the recipient; otherwise simply designate a country, and I'll ask colleagues who know the situation to select a recipient. The commitment must be ongoing if it is to work, and so we have arranged that the additional amount will simply appear on SAA membership bills in future years. 
Write now, and send money. It will make you feel good to do so. 
PLUS c;A CHANGE, PLUS C'EST MAY A 
-Or, Old Folk Beliefs Never Die, They Just Get In The Way. What was the great outcry before LAA came into being? "All we ever see in American Antiquity is stuff about the Maya, the product of a Mayanist cabal that is clearly plotting to take over control of the SAA itself!!!!" So LAA was created, and the loathsome Mayanist presence was expunged from AQ's pages. And now what do we have? At a recent conference in South America, an Editorial Board member's attempt to drum up trade for LAA was met with the response that the journal is clearly for Mayanists, who dominate its pages! Some statistics are obviously in order. Over the first 14 months of my editorship, the

regional breakdown of the 68 submissions was Maya 17, non-Maya Mesoamerica 8, lower Central America l, Andean area 31, lowland South America 6, Caribbean 2, and Tierra del Fuego 3. Those with higher-level math ability will quickly see that the Maya area weighed in with 25 percent, a rather weak presence alongside a South American aggregate of 59 percent. Nevertheless, the May­aphobic misperception lives on. What is it about us Mayanists that runs a glass rod down the cat's fur? If anyone out there has an explanation, I'd appreciate a letter. 
PLAYING WITH BLOCKS 
Constructing an issue of LAA is like building a wall in a tight space when the factory has managed to send a load of blocks with no two the same size. With LAA's average length of 96 pages and article length around 20 pages, it is obvious that placement of the first few blocks will leave space only for a bit of chinking here and there. In this setting we often find that an article that should go in a particular issue has to wait simply because there isn't enough room for it. Chronology obviously sets the basic decision-making frame, within which the need to maintain a reasonable balance between Spanish and English (currently; we hope that Portuguese will soon make an appearance) combines with a concern for regional equity to determine issue-by-issue makeup. It is for hese reasons that you see such disparate receipt-acceptance-publication spans in each issue. It has, I admit, taken me a while to appreciate fully how hard it is to produce good masonry in good time when one's hands are tied by circumstance. 
ARS GRATIA PJENULJE (ART FOR THE COVER'S SAKE) 
When LAA 's cover changed from uniform art to something extracted from an article, the enlivened appearance came at the cost of an agonized search through artwork of something less than uplifting aesthetic quality. As a result, LAA is shifting to a permanent identifying motif for each of the four issues. Time constraints have forced me to pick a motif for March to start Vol. 6 off (and of course I selected something from my own excavations), but the final choices, which should represent as broad a spectrum of Latin America as we can manage, will be made in the near future by a specially created SAA committee. From Vol. 6 onward you will be able to tell which quarter of the year you're in just by looking at LAA 's cover. 
LET YOUR GUIDE BE YOUR CONSCIENCE 
What you may have believed to be a sacrosanct set of prescriptions and proscriptions enshrined for all time in the Style Guide (American Antiquity 57:749-770 [1992]) is, in fact, a living document that can be expected to evolve as time passes. Evolution has already taken place, as you have probably noticed; the References Cited form has changed, and much for the better, I think you'll agree. I mention this for two reasons: first, to let you know that you should feel free to suggest change in anything you see as a flaw in the guide, and second, to give me an opportunity to note how many authors exhibit either cavalier disregard or cataleptic dyslexia when it comes to following the guide format for references. So take this as a plea: observe the new format in this issue, learn from your observation, and apply your learning to any manuscript you plan to submit. 
This by no means exhausts the matters that warrant mention, but it does exhaust the two pages. I'll be back in the next issue with comments on scouting, reviewing, epigraphs, and perhaps even bibliolatry. With that list of topics, I'm sure you can hardly wait.
