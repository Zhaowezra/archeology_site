HUANCAS AND RITUALS OF FERTILITY IN THE FARMING LANDSCAPE OF THE NORTHERN CALCHAQUI VALLEY (SALTA, ARGENTINA) 
Marfa Cecilia Paez and Gimena Ale Marinangeli 
In this article, we describe the material record associated with the ritual performances of prehispanic farming communities in Las Pailas (Salta Province, Argentina), and how these practices are maintained and resignified by current inhabitants of the area. The archaeological site of Las Pailas located in the northern Calchaqu{ Valley was an enclave composed of a large farming area and a complex hydraulic network that was continuously occupied from the beginning of the Christian era to the Spanish invasion. Las Pai/as features several huancas, elongated stones characterized as menhirs or monoliths, which are located in the center of farming enclosures individually or in pairs. Based on their different 
morphologies and sizes, they were classified into five types. The analysis of the huancasand their locations, together with information obtained from oral histories, suggests that these features were associated with agricultural fertility rituals. Even today, these stones are important in farming contexts, although their meaning has been resignified in a new social and cultural context. 
El objetivo de este trabajo es presentar el registro material que se asocia a las practicas rituales agr{colas de momentos prehis­panicos y que son continuadas y resignificadas en la actualidad por las pobladores de Las Pailas (provincia de Salta, Argentina). El sitio arqueologico delmismo nombre, ubicado en el norte del Valle Calchaquf, es un enclave agrfcola compuesto par una gran extension de campos de cultivo y una red hidraulica compleja, y ha estado ocupado de manera continua desde inicios de la era Cristiana hasta la invasion espaiiola. Las huancas son estructuras de piedra de forma alargada, caracterizadas como menhires o monolitos. Las que se encuentran en Las Pailas, se localizan en medio de los campos agrfcolas, de manera individual ode a pares, presentando diferentes morfologfas y tamaiios, los que motivaron su clasificacion en cinco tipos. El analisis de este registro material, as{ como las menciones obtenidas de relatos orales, permiten asociar este tipo de estructuras a rituales de produccion vinculados a la fertilidad de las campos. Aun hoy estas rocas siguen teniendo un papel importante en las configuraciones agr(colas actuates, aunque resignificadas bajo un nuevo contexto social y cultural.

speak of subjects and objects. This process takes place in non-Western ontologies, which should not be analyzed through our dualistic view of the universe (Descola 1996, 2001). For example, the Achuar people of Amazonia use several classifi­catory categories for the non-human world, in which most entities are endowed with a soul and hold a strong bond with humans. This relation can be further measured in terms of closeness; humans may have a closer relationship with ani­mals than with other people (Descola 20 10). In this sense, the land-and everything on it­presents a structural part of life based on human representations and symbolizations of the world. This bond is so important that when a community is removed from its land, their way of life even­tually turns into a memory object (Ingold 2005), collectively or individually built through the ex­perience of inhabiting the land (Auge 2014). 

For Andean communities, a similar ontological framework finds expression in the meaning ac­quired by fields, or chacras, when they are sub­jectively signified: "the nurturing of the chacra is the heart of the Andean culture which, if not the only activity carried out by the peasants, is the one around which all aspects of life revolve" (Valladolid Rivera 1994 in Mayer 2004:22). The cumulative knowledge about growing seasons, climate indicators, the behavior of plant and ani­mal species, the agro-astronomical cycle, and hy­draulic engineering is complemented by a reli­gious, symbolic dimension. Farming practices may symbolically encourage the sowing process, or aim to thank and invigorate the divine source of life through offerings or "payments to the Earth" (Van Kessel and Condori Cruz 1992). The earth becomes personified and deified as Pachamama, or universal mother and promoter of fertility, who is expected to protect and prolif­erate the harvest (Maricotti of Gorltz 1978; Mer­lino and Rabey 1983; Van Kessel 2000). Ulti­mately, this establishes a dialogue with the natural world, which is recreated daily through rituals of production and materialized through the ritualized "seeking permission" from the land (Van Kessel 2000). In this Andean ontology, human beings are not dissociated from their physical environ­ment; instead, they are closely interrelated, com­prising a larger system (Gobel 2003). This differs profoundly from the polarized Western world-view, where the distance between a relational and symbolic world, on one end, and the physical and natural world, on the other, are intended to sustain and justify the dominance and control of the former over the latter (Pfaffenberger 1988). 
On the basis of this Andean cosmology, we analyze the material remains of farming rituals performed in prehispanic times at the Las Pailas archaeological site in the Northern Calchaquf Val­ley (Salta, Argentina). The area near the site is at present inhabited by rural populations. Our in­terpretations are linked to the practices and beliefs of modem peasant communities at Las Pail as, whose interactions with the archaeological fea­tures have maintained and notably resignified the meaning of the site. By "rituals" we mean forms of social interaction involving the expressions and shared values of a group (Geertz 1957; Turner 
1969), and which are represented in a system of symbolic, performative, and agreed communica­tion (Dietl er 2001; Tambiah 1985). As social events, rituals must be analyzed in their spatial and temporal context with reference to the broader life experiences of the community (Segalen 2005). 
The Northern Calchaqui Valley 
The study area is located in a mesothermal valley-known as the Calchaquf Valley to the north and the Santa Marfa or Yocavil Valley to the south -that extends across the provinces of Salta, Tucuman, and Catamarca in northwestern Argentina (Figure 1). The region was extensively occupied in prehispanic times. The archaeological record dating to the last millennium reflects the socio-political regionalization and intensification of production that is characteristic of the Regional Development Period, from A.D. 900 until the ar­rival of the Incas in the early fifteenth century. During this period, increasing social complexity correlated with the development of a hierarchical political structure (Nunez Regueiro 1974; Tarrag6 1995, 2000) that, in turn, resulted in the estab­lishment of cooperative labor networks as a mech­anism to exploit natural resources (DeMarrais 2001). Such interpretations are supported by mod­els proposed in other parts of the Andes, e.g., Murra's (1975) vertical control model for the Pe­ruvian Andes, and Nunez and Dillehay's Caravan

model formulated for northern Chile ( 1995 [1978]). 
Settlement patterns in the Calchaquf Valley during the Regional Development Period are characterized by the presence of site clusters that varied in size and population density, and that took the form of hamlets and domestic units in agricultural areas (Baldini et al. 2004; Nastri 
1997-1998). At the same time, ceramic and metal technologies became more specialized and inter­related (Gonzalez and Tarrag6 2005; Palamarczuk 2012). The Calchaquf Valley and the Valley of Yocavil share distinctive features, such as the Santa Marfa ceramic style that is diagnostic of this period (Baldini 1980; Calderari 199 1; Nastri 1999; Pineiro 1996; Tarrag6 1974, 1995). This could be explained by regional socio-political structures and ethnic affinities (Tarrag6 197 4), with members of the same linguistic branch shar­ing a similar cultural background (Lorandi and Bo ix ados 1987-1988). 
The arrival of the Inca in the region did not entail substantial changes in the existing local political and social organization, nor did it sig­nificantly transform material and symbolic as­semblages (D' Altroy et al. 2000; Gonzalez and Tarrag6 2005; Williams 2002-2005). While con­servative views still claim that domination and acculturation were the primary mechanisms of interaction between local communities and the state (Acuto 1999), a growing number of research projects emphasize the importance of local polit­ical structures as the key to understanding the changing political situation in northwestern Ar­gentina during the fifteenth century (D' Altroy et al. 2000; Gonzalez and Tarrag6 2005; Paez and Giovannetti 2008; Paez 2014; Tarrag6 and Gonzalez 2005). In the north, center, and south of the Calchaquf Valley, Inca presence was man­ifested in the following ways: the organization of public spaces similar to the central Andes, the intensification of agricultural production­including the development of irrigation systems­and the construction or improvement of roads used to maintain communication throughout the region (D' Altroy et al. 2000; de Lorenzi and Dfaz 1977; Paez et al. 20 12; Paez and Giovannetti 2014; Tarrag6 and de Lorenzi 1976; Tarrag6 1977,

1978; Vitry 2002, 2007; Williams 2002-2005; Williams et al. 2010). Local ceramic workshops adopted "provincial styles" reflective of Cuzco­style Inca ceramics (Calderari and Williams 1991), although most of the pottery found in the region either combined Inca and local elements into a hybrid style (Calderari and Williams 1991; Paez and Giovannetti 2008), or continued to be produced in local styles. 
In historical times, the valley was primarily occupied by farming populations. During the Calchaqui revolts in the seventeenth century, the inhabitants of Cachi, who considered themselves "fellow Indians," moved to Salta to avoid attacks (Lanusse 2009; Lorandi 1987-1988). However, after the defeat of the Calchaqui and the subse­quent strengthening of colonial rule through the establishment of haciendas, the uprooted groups were "repopulated" and brought back to work in the haciendas (Lera 2011; Mata de Lopez 2000; Rodriguez 2008). During this repopulation process, new indigenous groups arrived, as well, creating a multi-cultural social environment (Lanusse 2009; Lorandi 1987-1988; Mata de Lopez 2000; Rodriguez 2008). 
The history of the valley suggests that, despite partial relocations, the area was never uninhab­ited, and its residents predominantly engaged in farming activities. Structures and elements iden­tified in the archaeological record, along with the environmental conditions of the area, support a long-term occupation of the area. In addition, the encomienda system implemented in the valley during the Colonial period survives today in the form of land leases, a variant of the patronazgo relationship (Pais 2011). 
Las Pailas 
The archaeological site of Las Pailas, the main focus of our analysis, is located in the northern part of the Calchaqui Valley, 25°02'05" S and 66°13'25" W, to about 3200 m as!, in the Depart­ment of Cachi, Salta Province (Figure 1) (Paez and Giovannetti 2014). It has been continuously occupied since the beginning of the first millen­nium AD., although occupation intensified during later times (Tarrago 1977). Chronological data obtained from radiocarbon dates indicate the site was extensively occupied during the Regional Development Period (fourteenth century AD.) 
(Myriam Tarrago, personal communication 2011). Technological elements and the presence of ce­ramic styles diagnostic of the Inca Period indicate that the occupation extended until the arrival of the Spanish (Paez et al. 2012; Paez and Giovan­netti 2014). 
Las Pailas is one of the largest and most im­portant sites of prehispanic agricultural produc­tion in the region, presumably favored by the en­vironmental conditions of the area, especially its hydraulic features. It covers an area of approxi­mately 500 ha; an additional 200 ha of site area have been partially destroyed by the modem oc­cupation. Most of the site consists of land that was probably used for farming, with crop fields of varying sizes and shapes (Paez et al. 2012). 
A cluster of stone structures southeast of the agricultural main sector is believed to have served as residential area for the inhabitants that made use of the fields seasonally or perennially. The residential area is strategically located. Its borders are formed by the Penas Blancas and the Potre­rillos Rivers, two permanent water sources that are fed by the Nevado de Cachi Mountains and that cut through the site, joining southeast of the residential area (Figure 2). Most of the enclosures in the residential sector contain grinding struc­tures, many of them portable (conanas), high­lighting the importance of activities related to processing of agricultural products grown in the nearby fields. The open spaces, or patios, possibly functioned as communal spaces related to pro­cessing activities (Tarrago 1977). 
Previous research divided the site into three longitudinal strips following the northwest-south­east incline of the valley slope, as illustrated in Figure 2. Strip B comprises the central area, in­cluding the southeastern cluster of residential structures and the adjacent large area of fields extending northward. Strips A and C, on either side of the aforementioned rivers that border Strip B, include fields and structures whose function has not been clarified yet, but may be associated with farming (Paez et al. 2012; Paez and Gio­vannetti 2014). 
The structures designated for farming-crop fields or canchones-differ significantly from residential structures in terms of shape and size. In most cases, they are of varying length and were built following the northwest-southeast in-

cline of the slope. The canchones on the north­west end of the site are more irregular in shape, wider, and reach a length of almost 100 m. There also are circular enclosures that may have been used for grain storage. The canchones and en­closures had irregularly shaped, double, single, or stone-mound walls built from locally available plutonic or metamorphic stones. Stone-mound walls are wide platforms that separate canchones from one another. They were built using stones that were removed during the cleaning of the fields (Tarrag6 1977). Inside the stone-mound walls are further enclosures, which generally oc­cupy the entire length of the platform. Most likely, these structures were designed for storage. 
South of the main sectors of Las Pailas 1, to­wards 25°01 '59.44" S and 66°14'45.08" W, a ridge following an east-west direction separates the formerly described extensive fields and res­idential sector from a smaller farming area called Las Pail as 2 (Figure 3). The latter is located southwest of the ridge and is connected to Las Pailas 1 by a mountain path that is still in use to­day (Figures 2 and 3). 
Field surveys conducted in Las Pailas 2 indi­cated that the entire area was probably used for farming, because there was no evidence of resi­dential structures. The absence of residences, to­gether with the remarkable morphological and constructive similarities of fields and water canals at Las Pailas 2 and Las Pailas 1, suggests that both areas could have been part of the same set­tlement and production system (Paez et al. 2012). 
In the higher-altitude sectors of Las Pailas 1 (northwest of Strip B) and in much of the western extension of Las Pailas 2, farming enclosures were delimited by single or double walls. Boul­ders of small or medium size covered the interiors of the enclosures and were dispersed at relatively even intervals, making it impossible to farm the interior spaces. Such discordance between field delimitation and surface preparation indicates that maybe they were designed with a specific yet un­known purpose, or they were once farmed and later abandoned (Paez and Giovannetti 2014). 
The site is traversed by a superficial hydraulic network of excavated canals, which, depending on their size, location, and extension, could be classified into first-, second-, or third-order canals (Poiree and Ollier 1974). First-order canals run

longitudinally through the site, directing water towards the second-order canals. These some­times extend through more than one field and run into the third-order canals, or gullies, which are the final course. The first-order canals, 3 to 4 m wide and variably deep, are built above the ground and are not covered, while second-order canals are dug in the ground, are up to .5 m deep and .4 m to .6 m wide, with semicircular cross­sections. The gullies are shallow, usually between .2 and .4 m wide, and form the ends of the aquifer (Paez and Giovannetti 2014). The characteristics and areal coverage of canals are shown in Figures 2 and 3. 
In Strips A and C of Las Pailas 1 and at Las Pailas 2, below-ground ducts were also identified at varying depths, ranging from a few centimeters to .8 m. In most cases, they were visible due to gully erosion, which caused their exposure in the soil profiles. Until now, about 30 canal sections have been identified, most of which are in Las Pailas 1. This sector is comparatively wider than Las Pailas 2 (Figures 2 and 3). Some canals run parallel to one another, while others intersect. 
The ducts are made of flat stones placed along the sides and across the top of the canals, although their floors are not lined with stones. Their width ranges from .12 m to .22 m. In most cases, they are between .12 m and .13 m deep, although min­imum and maximum values of .11 m and .18 m were recorded. Like the wall structures in the fields, the rocks used for canal construction are plutonic or metamorphic and were selected for their flat surfaces (Figure 4). The wide extension of the hydraulic network probably ensured max­imum field productivity, because rainfall is lim­ited to the summer months (November to March) in this region. 
The data indicate that during the Regional De­velopment and Inca periods, local production of food in Las Pailas expanded, consistent with the high number of grain processing structures in the residential area, the extension of the sowing land, and the profusion of hydraulic canals designed to distribute irrigation water. This hypothesis re­quires further testing near the periphery of the site, where fields were demarcated but have not been cleaned.

The Standing Stones of Las Pailas 
Standing stones are a common feature of most of the fields in Las Pailas l and Las Pailas 2, and are located in the middle of the fields individually or in pairs. Most of them are standing upright, are between .5 m and 1.5 m high, and are of vari­able width (Figure 5). 
Although the standing stone are made from the same metamorphic or granitic rock that was used in the construction of the walls delimiting the fields, they are easily identified by their cen­tral location within the fields. The study of Strips A, B, and C of Las Pailas 1 and Las Pailas 2 yielded a high frequency of standing stones in the whole farming area, except for the fields that have not been cleared, located to the northwest. Their recurrent presence in field and farming en­closures and absence from residential or domestic areas led us to systematically record and classify their morphology and orientation. Based on shape, which was the most distinct feature to­gether with height and width (Paez et al. 2015), we established five categories (Figure 6):

Figure 5. Upper: isolated stones in the middle of agricultural enclosures at Las Pailas; Lower: stones located individually or in pairs. 
• Type I are rounded-top stones with wide bod­ies and bases, and relatively parallel sides. They are planted vertically in the ground. 
• Type 2 are also rounded-top stones, but they present an inflexion a few centimeters below the top, where the sides get notably wider. Their bases are not flat, but rounded. 
• Type 3 comprises pointed-top stones of a par­abolic shape with a wide base. These stones have flattened front and rear faces. Some stand vertically, but others show varying degrees of inclination. In some cases this was accom­plished through the use of support stones or boulders wedged under the base. 
• 	Type 4 stones are defined by less regular shapes and flattened tops. Their even surfaces were probably achieved by cutting or polishing the stone. 
• Type 5 includes cases where isolated elements of one of the four previous types can be iden­tified, but they cannot clearly be assigned to a specific type. 
One of the questions raised by these stones is whether their presence was the result of man­made or natural processes. Their raw materials were available locally. The size of the stones is probably the result of frost-weathering processes common to this area. It is possible that many of these fractured blocks were displaced during in­tense summer rains, which caused materials to move down-slope from the snowy peaks north­west of the site to the lower area in the southeast. 
Conversely, the stones found at Las Pailas are neither very large 11or heavy and may have been moved there by the inhabitants of the site, pos­sibly to clear the area for farming. In many cases, similar stones can be found in the perimeter walls of the fields. Even if the blocks had been located farther from the fields, their transport to the cur­rent location would not have required much ef­fort. The thinning tips of some of the standing

stones may also have been the results of man­made alteration (Manzo 2010). Proving that the stones were intentionally inclined is not easy, considering that they may have been deliberately placed by people or unintentionally moved. The latter could be explained by the natural factors causing the movement of the ground where the stones are emplaced. However, some features clearly speak to the intentional manipulation of the position of the stones, such as the Type 3 stones found with stone wedges under their bases. 
The Stones and Relation with Symbolic-Ritual Practices 

During the fieldwork conducted at Las Pailas I in 2011, an area with large enclosures delimited by double-faced walls was recorded in Strip B. One of the enclosures was surrounded by a lm­thick wall built with narrow vertical stones. The large interior space of the enclosure stood out not only for its high visibility but also for its in­terior complexity and was probably associated 
with ritual practices (Figure 7). 
In the middle of one of the large enclosures 
was a structure formed by two big stones defining 
an internal space of about 1.2 m x 1.2 m, en­
closed by a double-faced wall. Based on the ex­
cavation of this enclosed space and its architec­
tural and spatial characteristics, we have 
proposed that this was a place for ritual activities 
(Paez et al. 20 14). 
Most of the artifacts were concentrated below 
or around the large stone at the center of the en­
closure (Figure 7). We recovered highly frag­
mented pottery pieces including coarse and 
finewares that date mostly to the Late and the 
Inca periods, as well as some older fragments. Many of the fragments had been exposed to fire, although no combustion feature or ash lens was identified within the enclosure. The ceramic as­semblage further included a fragment of semi­circular shape with post-manufacturing polish along the edges-a possible spinning instrument

or a board game piece. The isolated presence of a well-preserved bone fragment, likely the pha­lanx of a Lama sp., rules out the possibility of a culinary context, which would have included more refuse materials. The archaeological litera­ture relates such findings of camelid bones to rit­ual practices (Gutierrez Usillos 2002). The exca­vations also recovered mica sheets, a stemmed flint point, malachite beads, and an oxidized frag­ment of copper. Copper, malachite, and flint are not readily available raw materials in the area of Las Pailas. They must have been brought from other locations, indicating social and political ties of local residents to distant regions. Scholars have mentioned the importance of interaction networks between the puna and the valley regions for the exchange of obsidian, which was considered a prestige good (Escola and Hocsman 2007; Lazzari 1999). Likewise, malachite, used for making the beads found at Las Pailas, was also an imported resource and was used by local Andean authorities as ritual ornamentation. 
Surrounding the central stone in the four car­dinal directions are several standing stones that are inclined toward the center. In some cases, their inclination appears to have been natural, while in others small boulders were wedged under the base to obtain the desired tilt. Based on their position relative to each other and on the presence of votive offerings, these stones may have been huancas, an Andean concept that has been explored by eth­nohistorical and archaeological sources.

Andean ethnohistorical studies highlight the im­portance of places and objects in the landscape known as huacas and huancas, which are infused with sacred symbolism and through which hu­mans establish a fundamental bond with the land.

The concept of huaca is central to the analysis of Andean ceremonial practices. The pan-Andean nature of huacas is evident from its use in the two main languages of the region: Qhichwa (waqa) and Aymara (wak'a). These terms are of­ten used in Colonial descriptions to refer to reli­gious practices (Astvaldsson 2004). According to Manzo, the term huaca describes " ... any item or place considered sacred, which was worshiped, e.g., a physical element, whether natural or arti­ficially constructed, human or animal spirit, force of nature or human vitality. Not the mountain, or lake, or rock or statuette that is worshiped but the spirit contained therein" (Manzo 2010: 14 7, translation by the authors). In chronicles and legal documents of the early Colonial period, huaca was used to describe places and objects associated with sacred aspects ("indigenous gods"), or kin­ship categories referring to distant ancestors (Ast­valdsson 2004). Although Du viols ( 1977) recog­nized different meanings for the term as describing natural or artificial idols, fetishes, mountains, huacas, tombs and so on, huaca gen­erally refers to the sacred within the Andean worldview (e.g., Rostworowski 1983). 
In contrast, the term huanca defines specific landscape elements linked to ritual in Andean land management: "The Huanca like all huaca made from stone is inhabited by the spirits of the dead and the gods" (Duviols 1986:164, translation by the authors). Huacas include a multitude of natural and artificial elements and would also re­fer to tutelary monoliths guarding the land (Du­viols 1977). This was reported by the Colonial missionaries de Avendano ( 1648) and de Arriaga (1968 [1621]) and highlights the importance of huancas to the indigenous populations who wor­shiped these elongated stones (Duviols 1979). 
Based on the ethnohistorical evidence, Duviols characterized huancas as made from marble or granite, with smooth surfaces, zoomorphic or an­thropomorphic shapes, and being of varying heights (Duviols 1979). They were often located at the entrances of camps or villages representing the ancestors or founders of ayllu, and sacrifices were made to them according to the agricultural calendar (Duviols 1978, 1979). Duviols (1979) further distinguishes huancas based on their lo­cation. Those found in urban places (marca or llacta) are called marcayoc and protect the vil­!ages, whereas huancas in rural spaces (chakras) are named chacrayoc and ensure the fertility of cultivated fields. Chacrayoc are located in the center of the fields, their main side generally fac­ing east (Duviols 1979). 
According to Robin Azevedo (2010), stone monoliths in the middle of fields in the Andean community of Chumbivilcas represent petrified founding ancestors and served the appropriation of space by local residents. They structure the landscape and provide a physical link to the agri­cultural cycle. Chacrayoc located in the middle of cultivated fields are considered "owners of cultivated plots." Their phallic morphology em­phasizes their symbolic role as fertilizers. Azevedo also identifies a similar category of stones, known as ramaderos, which are related to the care and fertility of livestock (Robin Azevedo 2010). In Huaros (Peru), huancas are considered the owners of water and therefore in control of the fertility of the land and animals (Farfan Lobaton 2002). These examples demon­strate that huancas continue to play an important role in Andean agricultural life to the present day. 
For northwest Argentina, stones similar to huancas were first mentioned in the pioneering works of Ambrosetti (1897) who identified the presence of monoliths and stone alignments at El Mollar, Tucuman province. More recently, Garcia Azcarate (1996) has analyzed the pro­duction process of monoliths at Tafi del Valle, Tucuman, as an ideological and symbolic activ­ity. In the same study, Garcia Azcarate also ex­amines the location of the stones and their rela­tionship with the landscape. The huancas are grouped in concentric circles in connection with the agricultural cycle, and related to community activities around the main mound of the site of Casas Viejas. She suggests that huancas located in the middle of fields relate to cultic activities, ancestors, and the first settlements of the valley community. Other stones, however, would be as­sociated with domestic practices, following the distinction made by Duviols (1979) between ur­ban (marcayoc) and rural huancas (chacrayoc) as protectors and benefactors of different spaces. Yet other huancas act as territorial markings; they are located at access point to site where they control and enable interactions with other groups.

Other references to the standing stones in the middle of agricultural fields are mentioned by Aschero (2007) and at the archaeological sites of Coctaca (Jujuy, Argentina), Tarija and Potosi (Bo­livia) by Manzo (2010). These huancas are either worked at the top to obtain flat surfaces where offerings may be placed, or end in carved tips (Figure 8). These studies also find huancas to be associated with enclosures used for storage or collcas, and therefore to be related to the pro­duction (Manzo 2010). 
The Ethnographic Record 
The archaeological evidence found at Las Pailas highlights the importance of symbolism in shap­ing the agricultural and economic activities of the local population in ancient times. According to the ethnohistorical data, the stones standing in the middle of the farming enclosures could be interpreted as huancas, which materialized the power of the ancestors and ensured the produc­tivity of the land. 
All the standing stones at Las Pailas were iden­tified in agricultural sectors of the site. Only one long stone was found west of the residential area, fallen among the domestic structures, but its sig­nificantly longer shape excludes it from the ty­pology suggested for the farming area. Most prob­ably, it is a tutelary monolith related to the housing structures. A comparison of the Las Pailas stones with the huancas studied by Manzo (2010) at the Coctaca farming site (Jujuy, Argentina) shows that stones located in the middle of the farming areas resemble one another in terms of morphology and dimension. Types 4 and 5 of the Las Pailas standing stones could be identified at Coctaca; further similarities cannot be ruled out, because there are no detailed descriptions of the standing stones from that site. 
The ethnographic information provided by current inhabitants of Las Pailas indicates a direct

relationship between these stones and fertility rit­uals, as observed in indigenous farming commu­nities elsewhere in the Andes (Farfan Lobat6n 2002; Robin Azevedo 2010). The inhabitants mention rituals performed during planting season in reverence of Mother Earth (Pachamama), in­cluding digging a hole at the foot of the stones in the middle of the fields to be cultivated, pouring in wine and holy water, putting tobacco or coca leaves, and finally covering the hole. "Now the neighbors do that, over there, at the time of trans­planting peppers or sowing some seed. And they add wine, coca, holy water [ ... ] as they do it, and this is done by several families together, because many families are required for transplanting" (Marfa, 20 years, resident of Cachi; translation by the authors). 
In one of the rituals mentioned by local farm­ers called torna, families get together to help one another to plant the fields. During these events, elaborate feasts are held, including food, drink, and offerings to Pachamama. Cooperation among families has decreased over the years, and today votive offerings are made by individual families during planting season. This may have caused a change in the ritual practices related to the huan­cas. Oral histories revealed that as recently as one or two generations ago, votive offerings placed at the foot of the stones were much more common. Although the stones are no longer used today, they remain in their place because of the symbolic value they once had. 
Discussion and Conclusions 
In the last few decades, social scientists have dis­cussed the importance of using theoretical and interpretive frameworks that objectively comprise and intersubjectively establish the reality struc­tures of indigenous agricultural societies. The recognition of other, non-Western perspectives entails the acknowledgment of indigenous prac­tices, from which these societies construct their everyday reality. As we have shown in this article, it is necessary to reconstruct the network of social and symbolic relationships beyond the categories of nature and culture in order to signify the value of ritual practices in peasant societies from the Calchaquf Valley. The inanimate-in this case the huancas-acquires a new meaning, becoming a supra-natural entity capable of ensuring the fer­tility of the land on which the biological and so­cial reproduction of the group depends. This ex­emplifies how the categories of object and subject fail to account for worldviews, in which knowl­edge is constructed from bonds and perceptions between the animate and inanimate world. In this context, the huancas from Las Pailas would rep­resent more than mere references to votive offer­ings. Indeed, they would reflect the bond between humans and their ancestors, beyond the past and the present, evidencing the sacredness that en­sures the order of things and survival. If we pre­sume that meaning is mediated by the historical and situated relationship between entities, could it be possible to argue that the standing stones of Las Pailas are evidence of such a relationship? 

The ethnographic information we obtained points to two different periods within the modem era: from the grandparents of current inhabitants of the place, who performed rituals near the huan­cas, and from the current inhabitants themselves, for whom the stones mainly represent a memory object. Thus, because the stones constitute sym­bolically meaningful places, current residents of Las Pailas do not move the stones, even when they are no longer used in rituals anymore nor endowed with sacred meaning. At Las Pailas, the land represents a space built throughout history by long-established practices and traditions that have become part of its memory. Ultimately, these practices and memory are combined in the single element of the standing stone, making them living witnesses of a five-century long history.
