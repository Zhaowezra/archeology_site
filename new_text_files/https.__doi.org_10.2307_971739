IMPERIAL AND SOCIAL RELATIONS IN POSTCLASSIC 
SOUTH-CENTRAL VERACRUZ, MEXICO 

Christopher P. Garraty and Barbara L. Stark 
We explore social and imperial relations in the western lower Papaloapan Basin, especially along the lower Blanco River, using statistical analyses of ceramic rims from recent surveys. This region is sandwiched between two known tributary provincial cen­ters of the Aztec empire, but its relationship to the empire is uncertain in colonial documentary materials. Our analyses illu­minate changes in social relations from the Middle (A.D. 1150-1350) to Late Postclassic (A.D. 1350-1520) periods and shed light on the impact of Aztec imperialism. We use a ceramic unmixing procedure to assign collections to the Middle and late Postclassic periods for assessment of settlement patterns. Next we use cluster analyses to examine vertical wealth and status differentiation. In the Middle Postclassic period, we observe a concentric gradation of wealth and status away from the small center of El Sauce. Late Postclassic changes include the decline of El Sauce and the founding of a new center at Callej6n de! Homo. The concentric model does not apply to the late Postclassic period, however, and wealth and status became more highly concentrated at Callej6n de/ Homo compared to its hinterland. We also investigate sparse collections-those with few Post­classic rims-to evaluate whether these collections represent poor residences or, rather, sherd scatter from possible field manur­ing. The lower Blanco region was likely integrated into the Aztec empire on the basis of changes in vertical social differentiation from Middle to Late Postclassic times and percentages of Aztec-style ceramics compared to known Aztec provincial centers, especially Cotaxtla.

Posteriormente realizamos dos antilisis estad{sticos de agrupaciones para examinar la diferenciacion vertical de riqueza y de la posicion social. En el perfodo Postcltisico Media, observamos un patron concentrico de riqueza y estatus jerarquizados cuyo nucleo es el centro pequeiio de El Sauce, y a partir del cual se desminuye gradualmente la riqueza y el nivel de estatus. Los cambios de/ Postcasico Tardio incluyen el descenso de El Sauce y la fundacion de un nuevo centro en Callejon del Homo. Sin embargo, el modelo con­centrico no se aplica al periodo Postcltisico Tardio, y la riqueza y el estatus se observan muy concentrados en Callejon del Homo en comparacion con su periferia. Nuestra investigacion acerca de la diferenciacion social vertical tambien incluye el analisis de colecciones reducidas-las que tienen pocos hordes de certimica Postcltisica-para evaluar si estas colecciones representan res­idencias pobres, o tiestos esparcidos por el posible efecto de la aplicacion de abono en los campos de cultivo.

are scarce compared to the inner core of the empire in the Basin of Mexico. Here we consider evidence of social differentiation diachronically from the Mid­dle (A.D. 1250-1350) to the Late (A.D. 1350-l 5l9) Postclassic periods on the periphery of what were to become outer provincial towns in the empire, par­ticularly the provincial center of Cotaxtla. 
Our research focuses on settlement remains from the western lower Papaloapan Basin, located in south-central Veracruz where the Blanco River joins the Papaloapan estuaries (Figure 1). We consider evidence from two small centers and their environs, El Sauce (Middle Postclassic period) and Callej6n del Homo (Late Postclassic period). We use a regres­sion procedure (based on Kohler and Blinman 1987) to obtain sets of Middle and Late Postclassic col­lections, setting aside all dual-component collec­tions, and we evaluate settlement-pattern changes by plotting the Middle and Late Postclassic collec­tion midpoints. Next, we apply two cluster analysis procedures to examine ceramic types in relation to social status and spatial patterns. 
These analyses show that in the Middle Post-classic period, a concentric zone model (Marcus 1983) of wealth and social status applies to the cen­ter of El Sauce, with the center populations privileged in access to more highly decorated vessels, and declining access with a surrounding "inner" and "outer" residential zone. In the Late Postclassic period, however, we find little support for the con­centric model, in part because of difficulties in assess­ing it due to the distribution and shape of survey blocks and in part because valuable ceramics are more markedly concentrated at the center. In addi­tion, we observe relatively high-value ceramic col­lections at some distance from Callej6n del Homo in the general vicinity of the concentration of ceramic wealth and status that existed in the previous period. Perhaps the installation of a new center at Callej6n del Homo did not thoroughly dismantle previous land-holdings and continuities of wealth from the Middle Postclassic period. 
In both the Middle and Late Postclassic periods, we assess "sparse" collections-those with few Post­classic sherds-to determine if they better fit the expectations for poorer households (Stark and Hall

1993), or, instead, field manuring (Wilkinson 1982, 1989). Some support for field manuring emerges, but results are equivocal, as poorer households may also contribute to the sparse ceramic inventories. We note that a broad range of formation processes may be at work in the sparse Postclassic remains (Alcock et al. 
1994). 
We conclude that the Aztec empire likely con­trolled the lower Blanco region, perhaps indirectly. An increased wealth disparity developed between well-off and poorer households in the Late Post­classic period, which might reflect the co-optation oflocal elites by the imperial regime (Smith 1986). Co-opted elites generally prospered from their affil­iation with the imperial leaders, while subject com­moners suffered increased tribute and labor demands, decreed by both imperial and local elites (Berdan and Smith 1996; Brumfiel and Hodge 1996; Smith and Berdan 1992). High percentages of Aztec-style ceramics (Aztec III Black-on-orange types and Tex­coco Molded censers), compared to known imper­ial provinces (Smith 1990), further suggest imperial control of the region. 
We add analyses of vertical social differentiation to a growing set of archaeological studies of social variability in the Postclassic period, such as those by Lind (1987), Smith (1992, 1994), and Evans (1985). Each of these studies draws upon excavations of households. Our study, in contrast, relies upon sys­tematic survey and surface collections. Household excavations and regional survey are, ideally, com­plementary, the former providing advantages in chronological resolution and detail, while the latter yields a more extensive picture of variability (Gar­raty 2000:325). In this sense, our investigation rep­resents a first step in achieving a better sense of the issues surrounding social differentiation in the lower Blanco region. 
Social differentiation here refers to "vertical" wealth and status differences using a sample of indi­viduals, households, communities, nations, or any unit of study in which vertical differentiation might be expected. We realize that social variation is not always vertical and related to wealth; however, it is an important dimension to investigate. Social dif­ferentiation has long been a focus in Mesoamerican studies, but oftentimes it is assumed rather than pur­sued as a rightful focus of problem-oriented research (Chase and Chase 1992:3, 13). Archaeologists increasingly realize that the articulation of hierar­chical social relations varies cross-culturally among complex societies, as do the means by which these relations are established and socially reproduced (e.g., DeMarrais et al. 1996; Nelson 1995:599). Fur­thermore, the tools needed to interpret vertical social differentiation in the archaeological record require refinement. Thus, the methods and tools used to iden­tify and evaluate social differences should be a focus of empirical research as well. 
In this analysis, we illuminate social hierarchical relations through time at a residential-unit scale using ceramics. Interpretations of settlement hierarchy in this region are difficult due to the high degree of res­idential dispersion and the continuous scatter of household remains across the landscape (Stark 1999: 197). We are thus unable to define separated settlement locations aside from the two centers, which makes it difficult to develop a hierarchy based on settlement size, form, or other discrete attributes. Instead, we use individual residential locations to detect changing patterns of social differentiation. 1 
Political Geography of the Postclassic Lower Blanco Region 
The Late Postclassic political geography of the lower Blanco area is ambiguous concerning Aztec suzerainty (Figure 1). Tlalixcoyan, to the north, is the closest named sixteenth-century head town, but its two dependencies are not located on colonial maps (Stark 1974). Tlalixcoyan represents a small pocket of territory that may have remained independent of the empire or may have been controlled indirectly by one of the flanking provincial towns. Bracketing the lower Blanco area to the east and west are the provincial towns ofTlacotalpan and Cotaxtla, respec­tively. 2 Tlacotalpan represents lands along the Papaloapan River, while Cotaxtla held lands along the lower Cotaxtla River. 
The Late Postclassic community in the lower Blanco region is centered on Callej6n del Homo, a small center recorded in recent survey, located about 15 km west of El Sauce. It was almost certainly sub­ject to some head town, but we do not know which one. Berdan et al. ( 1996) observe that Aztec imper­ial leaders were highly selective in their conquest strategies: they generally focused on places that har­bored important resources or strategic geopolitical and economic advantage. As a result, the Aztec provincial map appears "patchy" (see Berdan et al. 1996:324), with large territories left untouched (but

not necessarily unaffected) by the imperial regime. Because of the "sandwiching" ofTlalixcoyan and the lower Blanco between Tlacotalpan and Cotaxtla, however, this modest-sized territory was surely pro­foundly vulnerable to the empire and may have been, defacto, subsidiary to the Triple Alliance. 
For the Middle Postclassic period, we have even less idea of the regional political geography because the Middle Postclassic ceramic complex along the Blanco River has not been reported from Cotaxtla or other archaeological sites in south-central Veracruz (Medellin Zenil 1960).3 The Middle Postclassic ceramic complex in the lower Blanco region evidences strong central highlands influence and can be inter­preted as a local variant of the "Mixteca-Puebla hori­zon." The incursion of central Mexican stylistic canons coincided with a cessation of prior ceramic traditions. Considering this sweeping cultural reorientation, Curet et al. (1994:28) suggest a powerful central Mex­ican or nearby lowland polity must have seized con­trol in the region, founded El Sauce, and imposed direct administration in the area (Stark 1990). 
Survey in the Western Lower 
Papaloapan Basin 

Our analysis of Middle and Late Postclassic social differentiation draws upon ceramic data from three survey projects in the western lower Papaloapan region, particularly along the Blanco River, but including other drainages as well (Figure 2). The bulk of the ceramic data come from the Proyecto Arqueol6gico La Mixtequilla4(PALM)( Stark 1991 ). The PALM survey, directed by Stark, occurred in stages. The first PALM survey (198 1988) covered a ca. 40 km2 Central Block, which included EI Sauce and various Preclassic and Classic period centers. Stuart Speaker directed survey in 1989 and covered seven smaller blocks around the Central Block in the distributary-delta zone of the Blanco River. The dis­tributary-delta zone is framed by the split of the Blanco River into the Blanco channel continuing northeast and the de las Pozas flowing to the south­east. The second PALM survey (1998-2000) expanded the survey region at the east end of the Cen­tral Block and covered areas upriver along the Blanco and adjacent drainages. In all, these surveys cur­rently encompass 95 km2, with an additional 43 km2 along the Blanco River checked in reconnaissance survey to assure that the area covered did not have 
additional monumental construction. 
The field teams employed intensive full-coverage survey tailored to the dispersed patterns of occupa­tion in the lower Blanco area. They systematically collected surface materials from most identified

structures and artifact concentrations.5 The features predominantly represent residential mounds, and most surface materials are domestic debris associ­ated with those residences. Surface collection was not always possible; for example, the western half of El Sauce was sketch mapped but not collected, because a modem village is situated on top of it. Where collection was possible, the survey team examined all artifacts and collected rim sherds, dec­orated or special form sherds, figurines, chipped stone, and certain categories of groundstone, but plainware body sherds were not collected. The goal of the original PALM survey was to collect 70-100 rim sherds per collection unit; however, this goal was not always feasible, leading to some features not being collected. The recent cycle of PALM survey (1998--2000) modified this policy so that all features with any visible remains were collected, yielding more representation of features with little pottery. In all, the PALM survey yielded 1,857 collection units, of which 1,368 include Postclassic sherds. 
Constructing a Postclassic Chronology 
A strong chronological framework is required to evaluate Postclassic social and settlement changes inthe lower Blanco region, an especially difficult task when dealing with surface collections (Jones and Beck 1992).Adding to the uncertainty, most ceramic assemblages are mixed, stemming from long-term occupation and reuse of mounds. A recurrent prob­lem for separation of components in mixed assem­blages is continuity in pottery types accompanied by variation in type frequencies that are characteristic of the periods. In the Middle and Late Postclassic periods in south-central Veracruz, a handful of ceramic types might safely be assigned to one period or the other, but many types appear to have been in use during both periods (Curet et al. 1994: 19). 
One way to assign period designations to mixed surface assemblages is to employ a ceramic unmix­ing technique. Kohler and Blinman (1987) intro­duced unmixing in archaeology to ascertain the "proportionate contribution" of individual ceramic components in multi-component assemblages. They employed least-squares multiple linear regression to discern the proportional representation of "peri­odized" assemblages within a mixed assemblage (Kohler and Blinman 1987:12). They first created a "calibration set," which refers to "the expected rel­ative frequencies of various ceramic types in each period" (Kohler and Blinman 1987:1 3). One must be careful when creating the calibration sets to select cases (preferably a robust number of cases) where a single-component occupation is certain or highly likely. The calibration sets serve as independent vari­ables against which the individual collection assem­blages (dependent variable) are regressed using ceramic counts. 
For each mixed collection, then, the regression calculates contribution coefficients (our phrase) for that collection by minimizing the sum of the squared deviations of the observed (the individual collection) and expected frequencies (the calibration sets). "The problem is to determine how many units of each of these expected patterns best approximate-when summed together-the observed frequency distrib­ution of sherds in the archaeological collection" (Kohler and Blinman 1987: 15). It is important to emphasize that unmixing does not assign individual sherds to one period or the other; it simply approx­imates the relative period contributions (as sherd counts) for each assemblage. The technique does not "unmix" as much as it evaluates mixture. 
Discovery of a single-component Late Postclas­sic center at Callej6n del Homo opened up the pos­sibility of unmixing surface collections, with El Sauce serving a similar role for the Middle Post­classic. Cross-dating of ceramics (Curet et al. 1994) provides the assurance that these are different com­plexes (we have no radiocarbon dates for them). We used ceramic assemblages within and from the vicin­ity of the Middle and Late Postclassic centers to cre­ate calibration sets, and we grouped some stylistically related types together to provide more robust cate­gories (Table 1 ). 
We also accounted for social, economic, or other bases for variation among the assemblages (Kohler and Blinman 1987: 17), as consumption differences in complex societies distinguish elites from the rest of the populace. In order to avoid conflating social and temporal factors, we used two calibration sets for each period: one associated with the centers, pre­sumably where a greater proportion of elites would have resided, and the other associated with the imme­diate periphery of the centers, where a greater pro­portion of non-elite commoners would likely have resided (Table 2). In the case of Middle Postclassic El Sauce and its environs, the calibration sets may include some sherds that were deposited during the Late Postclassic period, given the presence of a hand-

ful of definitive Late Postclassic types in these col­lections. However, the Late Postclassic population in the vicinity of El Sauce seems to have been scant, so the "contamination" of the Middle Postclassic calibration set is probably minimal. No Middle Post­classic occupation occurred in the vicinity of Calle­j6n del Homo; the Late Postclassic calibration sets can safely be characterized as "pure." 
The first run regressed each collection with 20 or more Postclassic rims against the four calibration sets, assuming a Y-intercept value of zero.6 Only Postclassic types are used in the analyses, not the entire collections, which may include other periods. After a series of runs, the remaining coefficients pro­vided the basis for assigning period designations:7 each collection was categorized as Middle Postclas­sic, Late Postclassic, or "mixed/unknown." The mixed collections are those with ample positive con­tributions from both Middle and Late Postclassic calibration sets. 
Advantageous in unmixing is its consideration of the distinct "life histories" of different ceramic types. It is not necessary to assign a certain type to one period or the other; rather, it is the relative frequency of a type in a given collection, compared against the frequency of that type in the calibration sets, that determines the period designations. However, unmixing is not fool-proof. For example, the pro­portion of coma/es (tortilla griddles) in the periph-

ery of Callej6n del Homo far exceeds the proportion in any other calibration set. Thus, some collections that otherwise appeared to be Middle Postclassic, but also happened to contain high proportions of coma­les, frequently regressed positively against the Calle­j6n del Homo periphery calibration set. In these cases, the results were clearly inaccurate, since coma­les occur frequently and in varying proportions dur­ing both periods. Also, there is some risk that additional collections may have been related to comal production besides those Curet (1993) identified (which we removed). In light of these occasional errors, the unmixing results were inspected against the raw data in order to insure valid results. The few cases with high comal percentages that were other­wise clearly Middle Postclassic were left in the Mid­dle Postclassic category. 
Small collections (less than 20 Postclassic rims) were not included in the unmixing analysis to reduce sample error. The small collections were assigned period designations (for a separate analysis discussed below) based on direct inspection of the raw ceramic data. For these small collections, we defined Middle and Late Postclassic assemblages by examining the relative proportions of temporally definitive ceramic types.8 Basically, the type compositions of small col­lections had to be rather definitive to be assigned to a period. For example, if a given collection was pre­dominantly Middle Postclassic but contained one definitive or probable Late Postclassic type, it was designated as mixed/unknown. 
In sum, two methods were used to make period designations for all collections with one or more Postclassic rims. All collections were designated as Middle Postclassic (n:::: 611), Late Postclassic (n = 290), or mixed/unknown (n :::: 467). Regression unmixing was used to evaluate collections with 20 or more Postclassic rims; visual inspections and assessments were used to designate collections with fewer than 20 rims. The mixed/unknown collections were excluded from further analyses. Armed with a set of Middle and Late Postclassic collections, we examine settlement patterns and social differentia­tion in the next two subsections. 
Postclassic Settlement Patterns 
The Middle Postclassic occupation is restricted almost entirely to the Central Block and nearby sur­vey blocks in the distributary-delta zone (Figure 3). A dense concentration of features occurs in and near El Sauce, which was highly nucleated, unlike earlier centers in the region that had dispersed occupation around public buildings (Curet et al. 1994:24; see also Stark 1999). The settlement density declines in the northern, eastern, and western outskirts of El Sauce, but relatively high-density settlement occurs to the south, especially in the northern part of the Classic-period center of Cerro de las Mesas. Settle-

ment density generally declines in the more distant reaches of El Sauce's hinterland. One exception occurs in the far southeast portion of the survey area, where settlement is somewhat denser near Los Azuzules, a Late Classic center. 
The features assigned to the Late Postclassic period occur over a wider area than those assigned to the Middle Postclassic period, including upriver locations along the Blanco and Guerenguito drainages (Figure 4). Callej6n del Homo, like El Sauce, includes a relatively dense mound concen­tration. Small, dense concentrations also occur in the immediate periphery of Callej6n del Homo, while elsewhere occupation appears to have been more dis­persed. Whether the more distant occupations fell under the political control of Callej6n del Homo is not known, but no evidence currently exists for other Late Postclassic centers in the survey region. Sig­nificantly, Callej6n del Homo developed where no prior Middle Postclassic occupation had existed and thus was probably not a political rival of El Sauce. It is doubtful the founders of Callej6n del Homo seized control of El Sauce, since they established their center relatively far from it. El Sauce may have been abandoned or diminished prior to the founding of Callej6n del Homo. The small number of defini­tive Late Postclassic collections in the vicinity of El Sauce supports the idea that Callej6n del Homo suc­ceeded El Sauce, whether after an interim or through active suppression. 
The continued use of some Middle Postclassic decorated ceramic types (e.g., Complicated Poly· chrome, red-on-black) into the Late Postclassic period suggests continuity of occupation in the region. With the collapse of El Sauce, some hinter· land communities and farmsteads may have remained in the area. Many mixed collections could therefore represent residences that were occupied continuously from Middle to Late Postclassic times. The salient question is, who founded Callej6n de! Homo? One possibility is seizure of the lower Blanco by one of the nearby head towns, perhaps one of the imperial provincial centers (e.g., Cotaxtla). A higher proportion of Aztec-style ceramics in Callej6n de! Homo, relative to its hinterland, supports the idea that Callej6n del Homo and the lower Blanco region were ultimately integrated into the Aztec empire eco­nomically, if not politically (see below). 
Statistical Measures of Social Differentiation 
We subjected the Middle and Late Postclassic col· lections identified through unmixing to two statisti­cal procedures in order to detect vertical social differentiation. We analyzed assemblage composi· tion in terms of proportions of highly decorated Post· classic pottery, primarily decorated bowls, using two clustering methods. The first is an "unconstrained" assemblage clustering procedure (sensu Whallon 1984), which forms clusters based on similarities in attribute frequencies. The second procedure, pure

spatial clustering (PSC), focuses on discrete spatial groupings of collections rather than individual assemblages (Koetje 1987; Siegal and Roe 1985; Simek 1984, 1987). Both are calculated using a k­means non-hierarchical clustering method (Blankholm 1991; Gregg et al. 1991; Kintigh 1990; Kintigh and Ammerman 1982; Simek et al. 1985) but with different input data.9 
The focus of analysis for assemblage clustering is the individual collections and their attributes, i.e., Postclassic ceramic type percentages (of total Post­classic rims). Each collection is treated separately, and the resulting clusters are unconstrained by spa­tial factors such as locational proximity (a focus of the second statistical tool). The use of individual col­lections makes the k-means clustering method ideal for distinguishing wealth and status differences among distinct residential groups based solely on assemblage attributes-in this case, the amounts of elaborately decorated pottery. 
Only collections of adequately robust sample size can be used, since ceramic type proportions are the input data for this analysis. For the Middle Post­classic period we used all collections with a mini­mum of 30 rims (n = 85).10 Only a few Late Postclassic collections contain 30 or more rims, how­ever, so we lessened the minimum number to 25 in that case to assemble a larger sample of collections (n = 30). We entered the ceramic data from these col­lections (as percentages) into a k-means clustering program (Kintigh 1999). In order to facilitate inter­pretation, we combined rare and/or similar ceramic types into single categories (see Table 1). 
The second statistical tool, pure spatial cluster­ing (PSC), is useful for comparisons of localized spatial units and provides an effective way to detect social trends across space. The aggregate ceramics of each spatial cluster can be compared and inter­preted in terms of vertical social differentiation. PSC entails a different calculation procedure than assem­blage clustering. For PSC, one first groups the col­lections into spatially defined clusters and then compares the aggregated attribute data for each defined spatial cluster. PSC is basically the reverse operation of assemblage clustering in which the ana­lyst defines clusters according to attribute data and then evaluates the spatial patterning of the cluster members. One advantage of PSC is that, since all col­lections from each spatial cluster are aggregated for comparison, even very small collections can be included in the analysis, thereby increasing sample size and spatial coverage. We used k-means to define the spatial clusters (Kintigh 1999), but the input data used were the X and Y coordinates (latitude-longi­tude) for each collection midpoint. 
The key distinction between assemblage cluster­ing and PSC involves the information that can be gleaned from them. Whereas assemblage clustering facilitates analysis of individual residential units, PSC facilitates comparisons among larger, spatially defined, nucleated occupations or localities. PSC is optimal for cases like this one where occupation is relatively continuous and, for the most part, clearly defined residential clusters are not evident. Still, the assemblage clustering and PSC results are intended to complement one another by accentuating some of the same patterns in the data. 
Social Differentiation in the Middle Postclassic Period (A.D. 1200-1350) 
Assemblage Clustering Results 
The optimal cluster solution for the Middle Post­classic assemblages occurs at a 9-cluster level; com­parison against the Monte Carlo simulation (25 random runs) at the 9-cluster level indicates signif­icance (see Kintigh [1999:20-28] regarding the assessment of significance). The 9-cluster solution provides several striking spatial patterns in the Mid­dle Postclassic ceramics (Table 3). A comparison of each cluster's mean type percentages against the overall means underscores major patterns of varia­tion in the data. Instead of treating all nine clusters separately, we aggregated them into four groups. These groups stem from our interpretations of fine­ness of decoration and labor investment for the ceramic categories listed in Table 1. Polychromes represent higher labor investment than bichromes. 11 Bichromes, in tum, represent higher labor investment than unslipped or utility forms, such as comales. 
The first group (Clusters 3, 6, 8) is composed of collections that likely represent high-status or wealth­ier residences, perhaps nobles and prosperous com­moners. The second group (Clusters 2, 9) shows some indications of wealth (e.g., high percentages of Complicated Polychromes) but not to the extent of Clusters 3, 6, and 8. The collections from these clusters may indicate intermediate-status residences. The third group (Clusters 1, 4) includes several cases that contain high proportions of comales and low pro-

portions of fine polychromes; the members of these clusters probably represent relatively low-status res­idents. A fourth cluster group (Clusters 5, 7) contains very high percentages of bichrome decorated types (Black-on-red and Black-on-orange) and may indi­cate ceramic production, but we do not explore this possibility here. Since the latter collections all occur in the southern and southeastern edges of the survey area (and perhaps on the periphery of El Sauce's political domain), we refer to the last cluster as the "peripheral" cluster group. While it is intriguing to consider ceramic variation within the four cluster groups, we do not attempt to explore all within-group variability in this paper. 
The High-Status Cluster Group. Figure 5 shows the spatial distribution of the Cluster 3, 6, and 8 col­lections (n 29). We interpret these three clusters as 
= 
signifying high-status residences for several reasons. First, about 2/3 (20 of 29) of these collections occur in or very near El Sauce. These results complement other data in suggesting El Sauce held social and eco­nomic advantages over its hinterland: for instance, the residents of El Sauce also constructed stucco floors and had access to copper items (Curet et al. 1994: 14). That the elites were concentrated in the urban centers of polities is not surprising. However, the cluster results suggest some high-status resi­dences in the hinterland of El Sauce (9 of29), mostly from Cluster 8, but these collections are sparse and widely scattered. Whether these hinterland collec­tions actually indicate high-status residences is dif­ficult to say without independent lines of evidence. Elsewhere, isolated high-status residences were sometimes constructed in the rural hinterlands of centers, e.g., at Texcoco, where palaces were scat­tered throughout the polity's domain, beyond the "downtown" area (Hicks 1982). 
A second reason we interpret the members of this cluster group as high-status residences is because they contain high percentages of elaborate poly­chrome ceramics. Clusters 3 and 8 contain extremely high percentages of Dull Buff Polychrome relative to the other clusters. The Cluster 6 collections include high percentages of both Complicated (or Cholute­coid) Polychrome and White-and-black-on-red Poly­chrome, although the percentages are not as striking as those for Dull Buff Polychrome in Clusters 3 and

cate market provisioning of pottery rather than exclu­sive elite access (see Hirth 1998). However, given their wealth, elites could presumably afford greater quantities of fine decorated wares than most non­elites (Hirth 1998; Smith 1987). Thus, the greater proportions of polychromes probably indicate greater means, not exclusive access. 
The Intermediate-Status Cluster Group. Clusters2 and 9(Figure6) probably represent commoner res­idences of intennediate status (n = 29). This "inter­mediate" group might include relatively prosperous commoners or lower elites, perhaps farmers with larger land holdings or merchants, administrators, and other specialists. Nearly a quarter of the collec­tions in this cluster group are located within El Sauce (4 of Cluster 9 and 3 of Cluster 2). The percentages of most ceramic types in Clusters 2 and 9 occur within one standard deviation of the overall means and thus do not reveal the high polychrome per­centages observed among the high-status cluster assemblages. However, the percentage of Compli­cated Polychrome is relatively high, comparable to the percentages for the elite cluster group, and may indicate greater wealth compared to most non-elites. Nevertheless, the higher ratio of bichrome (Black­on-red and local-style Black-on-orange) to poly­chrome ceramics, compared to the high-status cluster group, probably indicates a lower buying power than 
the wealthiest and most-powerful residents repre­sented by Clusters 3, 6, and 8. 
The Low-Status Cluster Group. Clusters 1 and 4 (Figure 7) probably represent low-status commoner residences (n = 17). Neither cluster contains high per­centages of polychrome or bichrome types, which might suggest minimal buying power for ceramic items. The spatial distribution of these cluster collec­tions is dispersed, and none occur within El Sauce. The composition of Cluster 1is unremarkable, except for its high percentage of Fondo Sellado, a type of impressed-base serving vessel with interior-painted sidewall bands. Fonda Sellado was produced in the area, to judge from finds of molds for the impresse<\ bases. This may help account for its economic acces­sibility. Cluster 4 is notable for its high percentage of comales, which may evidence decreased buying power of other, presumably more costly, decorate-0 types, but it might also simply suggest more use of comales or smaller-scale comal production than that detected by Curet (1993). The robust percentages of comalesin the high-status cluster group suggest coma! frequencies are not entirely indicative of economic sta­tus. This seems evident when we consider elite house­holds would probably sponsor more frequent, larger, and more elaborate feasts, which would require a large inventory of both elaborate and utilitarian vessels rel­ative to commoner households (Garraty 2000:328).

Figure 7. Middle Postclassic collections interpreted as low-status based on assemblage clustering results (Clusters I and 4). 
The low number of proposed low-status resi­dences in this analysis should not be surprising. It does not mean more high-and intermediate-status residences existed in the area than low-status resi­dences. Our sample size requirements may under­represent low-status households. We suggest the ceramic assemblages from most low-status house­holds are typically small for two reasons. First, low­status farmer's residences may have been ephemeral, which would diminish the accumulation of ceramic debris produced per household, compared to higher status and wealthier households (Kowalewski and Finsten 1983; Stark and Hall 1993; see below). Sec­ond, low-status residences would presumably have reduced purchasing capabilities, and vessel curation might have been a frequent practice. This would also reduce deposition rates of ceramic debris generated by poorer households. The assemblage clustering procedure may thus be biased toward the more afflu­ent and well-established segments of the community, given the minimum sample size requirement of 30 Postclassic rims. If so, much of the Middle Post­classic low-status population of the lower Blanco region would not generate adequate sherd abundances for inclusion in the assemblage cluster analysis. 
The "Peripheral" Cluster Group. The Cluster 5 and 7 collections (n = 10) occur exclusively in the southern peripheries of the survey areas, especially inthe southeast (Figure 8). Salient are their high per­centages of bichrome types. Cluster 5 is predomi­nantly composed of Black-on-red ceramics but also includes ahigh frequency of Black-on-orange. Clus­ter 7 also contains high percentages of Black-on-red and Black-on-orange ceramics. One explanation is production of these vessels, with high percentages due to "de facto" wasters (Stark 1985). Seven mem­bers (out of 10) of this cluster group occur within about  km of one another in the southeast area. We do not pursue a more detailed evaluation of this clus­ter group here. 
Pure Spatial Clustering Results 
The PSC results complement many of the patterns detected through assemblage clustering. Again, PSC uses k-means clustering of collection-area midpoints (as X-Y coordinates) to create spatial clusters, and the ceramic data for each spatial cluster are summa­rized and compared to interpret broad spatial trends. The 14-cluster solution provided the most readily interpretable results (Table 4; Figure 9), but some simplification is required to relate the clusters to social status. 
To facilitate interpretation we divided the deco­rated ceramic categories into polychromes and bichromes (excluding the miscellaneous-decorated category, because of its diversity, and Fondo Sellado, because of its ambiguity in labor investment [see endnote 11]). Polychromes would presumably have

required greater labor investment than bichromes, which would make them more costly and imbue them with higher social value. Also, it is possible that two bichrome types, local-style Black-on-orange and Black-on-red, were locally produced, which might have made them less costly. Given this rationale, the ratio of polychromes to bichromes can serve as an index of social and economic status. Polychrome­bichrome ratios were used to rank the cluster groups from most to least wealthy (Table 5) (the cluster ranks were used also as the cluster numbers to avoid confusion). A simple division of the ranked clusters into two halves reveals the upper half, with more plentiful polychromes, is distributed at and near El Sauce, forming a higher-ranked inner zone that con­trasts with a lower-ranked outer zone (Figure 9). 
Interpretations of patterning according to distance from the center are not straightforward. The pat­terning may reflect a gradient of economic means, but this interpretation ignores product access. The outer zone may have been disadvantaged by greater distance from a central marketplace at El Sauce (if one existed). Still, product access itself relates to wealth and status: wealthy individuals and elites may go to greater lengths than poorer nonelites to ensure access to the finest goods available. Also, families with greater means may be able to locate closer to the center and its varied facilities. If so, the ratio used here is a valid indicator of social and economic status. 
PSC Cluster 1 (Table 5) includes El Sauce and its immediate environs. The PSC Cluster 1 type per­centages support the high-status cluster group derived from the assemblage cluster analysis in showing the highest overall percentage of poly­chromes and the largest ratio of polychromes to bichromes. PSC Cluster 1 also includes the lowest overall percentage ofbichromes, which may indicate a preference for obtaining finer, polychrome ceram­ics. Alternatively, the low percentage of bichromes at El Sauce may simply reflect decreased access to these types due to distance, given the possibility of production of these types in the far southeast of the survey region. Both factors could have played into the consumption decisions at El Sauce. 
The overall spatial pattern fits what Marcus (1983:199-200) calls the concentric zane model of urban form. According to Marcus (1983:200) most Mesoamerican cities can be characterized as con­centric, with a "central zone of monumental public buildings surrounded by roughly concentric zones of increasingly unimpressive architecture." If not architecture, the data from El Sauce and its hinter­land suggest roughly concentric zones of decreas­ingly elaborate domestic ceramic assemblages. 
PSC Cluster 2 presents an interesting case. This spatial cluster is located a few km south of El Sauce, with a high percentage of both Complicated and Dull Buff Polychrome, nearly matching the percentages

from the highest-ranking Cluster 1 at El Sauce. Per­haps this area represents a wealthy or high-status "suburban" community. Without complementary evidence for social differentiation, however, we are reluctant to further pursue this observation.

Assemblage Clustering Results 
The optimal assemblage cluster solution occurs at the 4-cluster level, and the Monte Carlo runs indi­cate statistical significance (Table 6 and Figure 10). Given the small number of cluster solutions, it was not necessary to aggregate the clusters into groups, as we did for the Middle Postclassic assemblage clusters. The members of Cluster 3 can be interpreted as high-status residences for two reasons. First, Clus­ter 3 accommodates most (5 of 9) of the collections in and around Callej6n del Homo. The other four col­lection areas are dispersed in the distributary-delta zone. It is difficult to say whether these latter col­lections indicate elite residences without corrobo­rating lines of evidence, but perhaps some elite estates were constructed in the agricultural zone. 
Second, Cluster 3 includes high percentages of elaborate polychrome types and vessels with impe­rial stylistic associations, mainly Complicated Poly­chrome and Aztec-style vessels (Aztec III-style Black-on-orange and Texcoco Molded censers). The diverse and extensive polychrome tradition that marks the Middle Postclassic period in the lower Blanco area had disintegrated by the Late Postclas­sic period, and only the Complicated Polychrome types persisted. The very high percentage of Com­plicated Polychrome sherds in Cluster 3 indicates that the prestige associated with this type continued into the Late Postclassic period. The concentration of Aztec-style ceramics at Callej6n del Homo suggests that these ceramics may also have been costly and imbued with high social value (Smith 1990:163). Skoglund's (2001) neutron-activation analysis of Aztec-style ceramics from the lower Blanco and Cotaxtla drainages indicates that imitation Aztec ceramics were produced using local clays, which suggests some producers and consumers deliberately established a link to the Aztec tradition (for a dif­ferent view, see Smith [1990: 155]). The local imita­tion of Aztec types underscores their apparent social value to the Late Postclassic inhabitants of the lower 
Blanco area. Fondo Sellado (impressed-base) bowls are also frequent in the Cluster 3 collections, but the high percentage of Fondo Sellado overall in other clusters suggests these types were probably not con­sidered high-status. 
The Cluster 1 collections appear to represent com­moner residences. Cluster 1 encompasses more than half ( 17 of 30) of the collections used for the analy­sis, and their spatial distribution reveals no clear pat­terns. Comales comprise more than 50 percent of the Cluster 1 assemblages, which suggests either these residences were very poor or they produced a very high per capita amount of tortillas, perhaps as tribute or for sale in the local marketplace. The Aztecs fre­quently demanded food items as tribute in kind, and Hicks ( 1991) discusses instances where subject com­moners in the Aztec Basin of Mexico presented food to their noble patrons during feasts. It is plausible some commoners in the lower Blanco region provided tortillas to elites at Callej6n del Homo in the same manner. However, some of these collections occur in the middle portion of the Central Block survey, not far from the Middle Postclassic comal production area (Curet 1993); comal production might have con­tinued in this portion of the Central Block, account­ing for some of the high percentages of comales. 
Clusters 2 and 4 are more difficult to explain. Cluster 2 is an anomaly, comprised of a single case (collection 465) with an overwhelming percentage of Coarse Polychrome sherds (LPOLY m-o; 17 of 26 sherds), a very rare category in the lower Blanco area. The reason for this concentration at one locus is difficult to evaluate, but it may suggest Coarse Polychrome ceramics were produced or stored at this location. Cluster 4, which only includes 3 cases, contains high percentages of fine-paste gray and cream wares and Quiahiustlan-style ceramics. It is possible that fine-paste wares were produced at these loci, but the reason for the high percentages of Quiahuistlan-sty le types is difficult to gauge, as it has not yet been determined if these vessels were imported. All Cluster 4 collections occur in the Cen­tral Block, and the fine-paste wares appear to have been relatively rare in the vicinity of Callej6n del Homo, suggesting they were produced or more widely circulated in the distributary-delta zone. Fur­thermore, 2 of the 3 collections are located directly adjacent to one another (Figure 10), which might indicate production of fine-paste wares. Further evi­dence is needed to interpret the Cluster 2 and 4 col-

Pure Spatial Clustering Results 
The 9-cluster solution provides the most readily inter­pretable results from the Late Postclassic PSC analy­sis (Table 7 and Figure 11). In accordance with the Middle Postclassic analysis, we ranked the spatial clusters according to the ratio of high-value wares (defined as Aztec-style vessels and Complicated Polychrome) to the less-valuable bichrome types (local-style Black-on-orange and Black-on-red) (Table 8). All are serving bowls, except for Texcoco Molded, a bowl-shaped censer. Again, the PSC clus­ter ranks were used as the cluster numbers to avoid confusion. 
PSC Cluster 1, the highest-ranking cluster, encompasses Callej6n del Homo and its immediate environs, supporting the patterns observed in the assemblage cluster analysis. PSC Cluster 1 includes the highest mean proportion of high-value ceramic types. In fact, the ratio of high-value to bichrome types at Callej6n del Homo nearly doubles that of the second-highest-ranking cluster. Figure 12 graphsthis ratio and suggests that a striking gap developed between the most well-off inhabitants residing at Callej6n del Homo (represented by PSC Cluster 1)and its hinterland population, compared to Middle Postclassic times. The Middle Postclassic collec­tions exhibit a more continuous distribution of wealth. We discuss this wealth disparity in greater detail below. 

PSC Clusters 1 and 4, encompassing Callej6n de! Homo and collection areas just outside of it, contain low relative percentages of both Black-on-red and local-style Black-on-orange (Black-on-orange 57a­c ). PSC Cluster 2, corresponding to the Nopiloa sur­vey block, also contains low percentages of bichromes. The Central Block, in contrast, contains high percentages ofbichromes (Table 8), suggesting both bichrome ceramic types remained more promi­nent in what were their traditional locales of use (and possibly production) in the distributary-delta zone. This presence ofbichrome types in both Middle and Late Postclassic collections indicates continuity in the use of these types, but the area previously occu­pied by Middle Postclassic populations shows the greatest continuity in use. However, lower overall counts and percentages in Late Postclassic contexts suggest that the manufacture or di stribution of bichrome types dwindled considerably from Middle Postclassic times. The second-place rank for PSC Cluster 2 is not evidence for wealthy or high-status residences in the Nopiloa area because it has low per­centages of both bichromes and high-value wares. 
It is difficult to evaluate the nature of urbanism at Callej6n del Homo and its hinterlands in terms of Marcus's (1 983) formal models, since much of the area directly surrounding Callej6n de! Homo has not been surveyed with full-coverage methods. The

patchiness of the survey blocks thus provides only a glimpse of the settlement pattern and spatial trends during the Late Postclassic period (Figure 11). The highest proportions of high-value wares outside of Callej6n del Homo occur in PSC Cluster 3, in the western portion of the Central Block. This observa­ti on, along with the seeming impoverishment of the Cluster 4 occupations in the immediate vicinity of Callej6n del Homo, does not support a concentric model like that observed in the Middle Postclassic occupation.

lections in which Postclassic rims were sparse. In this section we attempt to interpret the social significance of sparse occurrences because of the possibility that they relate to poor households and may help flesh out our study of vertical social differentiation . Mesoamerican archaeologists have not often addressed the cultural and natural processes that gen­erate sparse collections (but see Kowalewski and Finsten 1983; Stark and Hall 1993). They may result from poor surface visibility, differential survey inten­sities, erosion and siltation, plowing, or any other number of post-depositional processes. Some also simply reflect a low overall amount of remains. Con­sideration of every possible determinate of collec­ti on size variability is beyond the scope of this paper.

ple of sedimentation effects on collections from the Central Block, for example. We attempt, as much as possible, to control for some determinants of col­lection variability by including only those cases where surface visibility was deemed "moderate" or "excellent" by survey personnel. 
We endeavor to model the past cultural practices responsible for the generation of sparse collections during the Postclassic period. Two possible practices are ceramic deposition from poor, ephemeral resi­dence at a location (Kowalewski and Finsten 1983:421; Stark and Hall 1993) and field manuring (Alcock et al. 1994; Wilkinson 1982, 1989).

manuring for productivity is evident; however, the artifact debris mixed with the manure aerates the soil and also contributes to productivity. Many sparse Postclassic collections have normal quantities of sherds from earlier periods, but these residential areas may have been reused as agricultural fields during the Postclassic period, given the disruption of Clas­sic settlement pattern (Curet et al. 1994 ). We do not expect that sherd deposition produced by manuring practices would generate collection sizes and densi­ties on par with collections primarily deposited in domestic contexts. Rather, such collections should be sparse. 
We tested the two hypotheses by comparing the sparse collections in aggregate against the results of the above analyses based on larger, more robust col­lections. Sparse collections are defined here as those with less than ten Postclassic rims. Separate analy­ses were performed for the Middle and Late Post­classic sparse assemblages, comparing each to the more robust collections assigned to that period (see above). 
If the sparse collections represent poor Postclas­

sic residences, as suggested by Stark and Hall (1993), then the aggregate proportions of ceramic types from these collections should more closely resemble the ceramic inventories ofiow-status residences and dif­fer from residences of high or intermediate status. If, instead, the sparse collections represent manur­ing deposits, then type percentages should more closely reflect the overall mean type percentages for all collections from that period. That is, the overall rate and accumulation of ceramic deposits in manur­ing should resemble the overall rate and accumula­tion of ceramic deposits for domestic contexts, within a reasonable range of variation. This latter hypothe­sis assumes a random sherd deposition, i.e., that all ceramic types were equally likely to be included with nightsoil deposits.13 In fact, one might expect the ' nightsoil deposits to be slightly more "poor-looking" 
I

than the overall type percentages because elites pre-i sumably were not practicing agriculture, and thus their sherds might not be as well represented among the nightsoil deposits.14 However, this biasing effect would probably be minor, since in agrarian societies the vast majority of domestic debris comes from

nonelite farming residences. Furthermore, servants 
may have cleaned up trash in the course of domes­
tic service to elites and applied it to field enrichment. 
We used Brainerd-Robinson (BR) similarity coef­ficients (Brainerd 1951; Robinson 1951) to quantify the similarity among sparse collections and the col­lections generated by residences of different status groups. The BR coefficient measures similarity among two or more units using type percentage data. The coefficient is 200 minus the sum of the absolute values of percentage differences between any two collections; a score of 200 indicates complete simi­larity, and 0, complete dissimilarity. The sparse col­
lections and the status-group collections were 
summarized as aggregated type percents (Tables 9 
and 10). We used Kintigh's (1999) distance/similar­
ity program (DIST) to calculate the BR coefficients. 

For the Middle Postclassic period, we compared the aggregated sparse collections against the pro­posed assemblage cluster groups for high status (Clusters, 3, 6, 8), intermediate status (Clusters 2, 9), and low status (Clusters 1, 4). Table 9 lists the mean type percents for each status group, the aggregated sparse collections, and the percentages for all col­lections, along with the BR coefficient between each row and the aggregated sparse collections assigned to the Middle Postclassic period. 
Not surprisingly, the sparse collections are most unlike the high-status collections. The "all collec­tions" category shows the greatest similarity with the sparse category, suggesting the poorest residences did not necessarily generate the sparse collections. Also, the BR coefficients are roughly equal between the sparse category and the intermediate-and low­status categories. The BR coefficients thus more strongly corroborate the expectations of the manur­ing hypothesis than the poor-household hypothesis. However, the mean percentages of polychromes per status group tell a different story. From this point of view, the sparse collections more closely resemble the low-status collections in that both categories con­tain lower percentages of polychromes (ca. 13-15 percent) compared to the intermediate-status and "all collections" categories (ca. 21 percent and 18 per­cent, respectively). The lower percentages of poly­chrome types in the sparse collections may also indicate that elite-derived refuse was not used for field manuring, or only used infrequently. The Mid­dle Postclassic data are thus ambiguous regarding the cultural formation processes of sparse collections in the lower Blanco area, and both deposition from poorer houses and manuring practices may be at work. 
For the Late Postclassic period, we compare the aggregated sparse collections with assemblage Clus­ter 3-presumably the wealthiest cluster group­and with assemblage Cluster 1-which probably includes commoner residences of "average" wealth and status (Table 10). Again, the sparse category most closely resembles the combined collections, but this time the sparse collections more closely resemble the high-status collections than the com­moner collections. The closer resemblance to the high-status coUections, however, might reflect the 
; strong reliance on Aztec-style diagnostics to assign sparse collections to the Late Postclassic period (see above). On the one hand, the highest BR coefficient occurs between the sparse and the "all collections" · 
categories, indicating stronger support for the manur­ing hypothesis than for the poor-household hypoth­esis. On the other hand, the percentages of high-status types (Complicated Polychrome and Aztec-style ceramics) among the sparse collections (ca. 6 per­cent) are slightly lower than the overall percentages (ca. 8 percent), which indicate some support for the poor-household interpretation. Again, this may also indicate less usage of elite residential trash as manur­ing material. 
In sum, the test results do not clearly confirm either hypothesis regarding the generation of sparse collections, although some support for each hypoth­esis exists. The indications of a combination of effects highlight strongly the complex formation processes responsible for the generation of sparse collections. Our results support the contention of Alcock et al. (1994) that multiple hypotheses must be considered and that more detailed problem-ori­ented research is needed. 
Discussion 

Town and Outlying Occupations 
The elite populations of the western lower Papaloa­pan region were concentrated in centers during the Postclassic period. In the Middle Postclassic, the ceramic evidence suggests that the majority of high­status features are located in or very near El Sauce, even though some elites likely resided in outlying locales, and a possible second cluster of elite resi­dences may have existed a few kilometers to the

south. In the Late Postclassic period, the concentra­tion of elites in the main center is even more strik­ing. Callej6n del Homo includes far richer ceramic assemblages than its outlying residences. There may have been elite occupations in the hinterlands of Callej6n del Homo in the western Central Block that reflect some social continuity with Middle Post­classic land use and wealth. 
The concentration of elites in the main centers may seem normative to many Mesoamerican researchers, but in reality it is not. The concentric model, which presupposes an elite center grading into less differentiated communities with increased distance from the center, has been shown to be inap­plicable in many cases in Mesoamerica (see D. Chase 1992: 122; Smith 1994 ). We demonstrate concentric patterns in the Middle Postclassic period but not in the Late Postclassic period. As noted, in both peri­ods there are some elite occupations in outlying regions. Elite populations in many Aztec polities in central Mexico are dispersed throughout the polity's domain, residing in both urban and rural areas (Evans 

1993, 1996; Hicks 1982; Parsons 1971; Smith 1992, 1994). Elite residence in rural areas was apparently commonplace among the Aztecs. Additional exam­ples of elite residence in the outlying countryside of cities come from the Maya region, such as Caracol 
(A. Chase 1992:41) and Santa Rita Corozal (D. Chase 1992: 122). 
In the lower Blanco area, Classic period occupa­tion includes a variety of sizable construction away from formal clusters (Stark 1999), suggesting that a zonal pattern is inapplicable, at least within the Cen­tral Block of the distributary-delta zone. In compar­ison, both Postclassic periods examined here show amore striking construction focus on the sequential centers of El Sauce and Callej6n del Homo. These examples illustrate that "concentricity" needs to be demonstrated, and we should not assume "the [con­centric] model fits the vast majority of cities in Mesoamerica" (Marcus 1983:200). This model applies on a broad spatial scale in the middle Post· classic lower Blanco area, but exceptions appear when the scale is shifted to individual residences. 
The ceramic evidence suggests social relations between center and outlying populations changed from Middle to Late Postclassic times. The Middle Postclassic ceramic data suggest a gradation in social status from high-status residences at El Sauce to var­ious levels of "middle-status" residents in the imme­diate and far periphery, to the poorest members of the society, likely represented by some of the sparse collections. Overall, the gradation in wealth and sta­tus levels in the Middle Postclassic period suggests a relatively widespread distribution of resources. 

A greater gap between rich and poor seems to have developed in the Late Postclassic period (see Figure 12). The inhabitants of Callej6n del Homo, for example, possessed greater percentages of high­status types (polychrome and Aztec-style ceramics) than outlying residences; the highest-ranking PSC cluster, centered at Callej6n del Homo, nearly dou­bles the values of the second highest-ranking PSC cluster. The residents of Callej6n del Homo also pos­sessed more Aztec-style types; the symbolic power of Aztec-related goods may have been considerable in establishing and maintaining claims to power and authority during the Late Postclassic period (Smith 1986, 1990; see below). In contrastto the Middle Post­classic results, the Late Postclassic cluster analyses do not clearly indicate the existence of graded social status categories. It is possible that evidence for res­idences with a clearer middle-status ceramic profile exists in unsurveyed areas of the lower Blanco region. However, current data suggest the quantity of wealth controlled by Callej6n del Homo's residents far sur­passed any of its hinterland communities. 
The Possibility of Aztec Control 
Had the lower Blanco region fallen under Aztec con­trol, one might predict such a burgeoning gap between well-off and poorer households. The Aztecs frequently co-opted or appointed local elites to administrative positions in conquered territories. They generally integrated local tribute systems into their own, and in so doing, typically elevated tribute demands. The commoner populations generally shouldered the greatest responsibility for meeting the increased tribute (Berdan and Smith 1996:211; Brurnfiel and Hodge 1996; Smith 1986; Smith and Berdan 1992). For example, not only did they have to satisfy traditional tribute requirements to local leaders but, after the Aztec incursion, also had to pay tribute imposed by the imperial regime. Moreover, local leaders, once affiliated with the Aztecs, often­times increased tribute burdens, knowing their authority was bolstered by the imperial presence (Hicks 1994 ). Commoners may have had little choice but to comply with these obligations. The greater trib­ute demands left them with fewer resources for them-

selves and less time disposable for their own eco­
nomic pursuits. A growing wealth disparity would 
thus likely result from the establishment of Aztec 
hegemony in a region (Berdan and Smith 1996; 
Smith and Berdan 1992). As summarized in Figure 
12, the ceramic data suggest that between the Mid­
dle and Late Postclassic periods, local elites at Calle­j6n de! Homo became more advantaged relative to the rest of the population than the Middle Postclas­sic elites had been. 
Additional evidence for Aztec control of the lower Blanco region comes from the percentages of Aztec­style ceramics in the PALM collections (Smith 1990; see also Hodge 1998:220). Aztec Black-on-orange and Texcoco Molded ceramics comprise a bit more than 3 percent of the Late Postclassic PALM col­lections. Smith ( 1990: 163) found that 83 percent of Aztec-style ceramics outside the basin were recov­ered from imperial provinces. Smith (1990: 154) also reports that percentages of Aztec-style sherds (not including Guinda, i.e., Texcoco Black-on-red and Texcoco Black-and-white-on-red) for the cases he considered range from . I to 4. 7 percent of total sherd counts (Smith l 990:Table 2), and the mean percent­age of Aztec-style ceramics from areas to the east of the Basin of Mexico is even lower, at .53 percent (excluding the outlier Quauhtochco, which has ca. 20 percent Aztec types). Hence, the high percentage of Aztec-style types (ca. 3 percent) in the lower Blanco area, relative to other areas, strongly suggests a political affiliation with the imperial regime. Ohn­ersorgen (2001) recovered ca. 2 percent Aztec-style ceramics (percent of rims) from surface collections at Cotaxtla. However, his 2 percent figure could reflect some Middle Postclassic rims, since he was unable to distinguish Middle Postclassic sherds, if they were present. Had he been able to control for any Middle Postclassic contribution, the percentage might have been somewhat higher. Nonetheless, the percentage of Aztec-style ceramics from Cotaxtla, a known Aztec provincial center, appears roughly com­parable to that of the lower Blanco region. 
Notable in this regard is that some ceramic types from the Aztec imperial core in the Basin of Mex­ico, most conspicuously Aztec-style Guinda types, are absent or scarce in the lower Blanco and Cotaxtla assemblages in the Late Postclassic period. The dis­tribution of Aztec-style Guinda is mostly restricted to the Basin of Mexico and surrounding valleys (based on our interpretation of Smith [l 990:Table 2]) 
and is nearly absent in the Gulflowlands, with at least 
one exception (Quauhtochco). Smith (1990: 162) 
suggests Aztec-style ceramics were disseminated 
into the outer provinces through down-the-line 
exchange. This may be partly true, but down-the-line 
exchange cannot explain the narrow range of Aztec 
types recovered from the lower Blanco region and 
other contexts in the outer provinces. First, if the res­
idents of the lower Blanco and Cotaxtla regions 
acquired Aztec ceramics through down-the-line 
exchange, we would expect all Basin ceramic types, 
including Guinda, to be represented in the outer 
provinces. Likewise, if the lower Blanco area had 
been a destination for Aztec colonies (Umberger 
1996:158-159), we would expect replication of a 
more complete inventory. 
Second, as Michael Ohnersorgen (personal com­munication, 2001) has noted, Aztec Guinda com­prises mostly bowl forms that could have been stacked during transport and, therefore, more read­ily disseminated in bulk by long-distance merchants. Black-on-orange and Texcoco Molded, on the other hand, generally do not occur as forms that would have been conducive to bulk transport: Black-on-orange occurs most frequently as dish forms with attached supports, and Texcoco Molded constitutes handled censers-neither form would have been easily stacked. Thus, Aztec Guinda would have been bet­ter suited for economies of scale and long-distance transport than Black-on-orange or Texcoco Molded. 
Given these observations, why do we recover Aztec III-style Black-on-orange and Texcoco Molded, but not Aztec-style Guinda, in the Gulflow­lands? This restriction of types suggests something more deliberately selective. Skoglund's (2001) evi­dence for local imitation of Aztec-style ceramics fur­ther indicates that some inhabitants of lower Blanco area made a deliberate connection to the Aztec ceramic tradition. J 
We suggest the presence of Aztec-style ceramics in the Gulflowland provinces to some degree reflects the prerogatives of local elites. Aztec-style ceramics and other Aztec-related goods may have served as tokens oflegitimacy (e.g., Schortman and Nakamura 1991) and powerful reminders to the general popu­lace about the imperial forces who backed the provin­cial regimes. Schortman and Nakamura (1991:328) 

discuss this process in the Maya periphery. Items acquired from powerful Mayan states, they argue, may have been used as "badges of office, separating

rulers from ruled, and/or as gifts to dependents, cementing intrasocietal alliances and stimulating sur­plus production." A similar process of co-opting sym­bolic imperial items to bolster the power of local rulers occurred in the outer provinces of the Aztec empire. Boone (1996) discusses the adoption of var­iousAztec "forms of knowledge" by elites from sub­ject provinces, including painting styles, forms of historical documentation, and the calendrical system. These forms of knowledge, and the items they yielded, probably signified Aztec support and impe­rial power. Perhaps a number of items recognized as "Aztec" could have served this purpose. In this vein, Aztec III-style Black-on-orange and Texcoco Molded could have been purchased or locally imi­tated because they were the ceramic items most widely recognized as being "imperial" by the gen­eral populace. 
The high frequencies of Aztec-style ceramics at Callej6n del Homo may have informed the "audi­ence," i.e., the tributary commoner population, of the Callej6n del Homo leaders' affiliation with the Aztec regime. It may thus be significant that, of the two Aztec-style ceramics that are widely circulated in the lower Blanco region, one is a serving ware (Aztec Ill-style Black-on-orange), and the other, a ritual ware (Texcoco Molded censers), both of which can be characterized as "high-visibility" (Wattenmaker 1994). Feast and ritual events would have been opti­mal occasions to display these types in a public con­text (DeMarrais et al. 1996). 
Despite the lack of documentary evidence affinn­ing Callej6n del Homo and the lower Blanco region 
s dependencies in the empire, material evidence suggests they were, although perhaps indirectly. The concentration of Aztec-style ceramics in Callej6n de! Homo may indicate the elites who resided there were co-opted by the Aztec regime (Smith 1986), perhaps via one of the larger head towns in the area. Cotaxtla probably controlled a number of smaller centers in south-central Veracruz and is the most likely provincial town to have controlled the lower Blanco region. Ohnersorgen's (2001) recent surface study in Cotaxtla shows it to be several times larger than Callej6n del Homo. 
Summary and Conclusion 
Inthe Postclassic period, the lower Blanco region had a spatially dispersed, continuous settlement pattern, making it difficult to interpret the settlement hierar­chy beyond designations of centers based on the size and nature of public architecture (Stark 1999). The survey data are geared toward analyses at the scale of the individual feature, however. An unmixing tech­nique (Kohler and Blinman 1987), along with visual inspections of the ceramic data, allowed us to desig­nate collections as Middle Postclassic, Late Post­classic, or mixed/unknown, and clustering techniques allow us to discern spatial and assemblage patterns tied to the elaborateness of pottery. 

The spatial arrangements and ceramics of Post­classic features suggest a significant change from Middle to Late Postclassic times. The Middle Post­classic settlement pattern centered on El Sauce and was concentrated in low-lying distributary-delta zone of the Blanco River. By the Late Postclassic period, however, a new center appeared upriver, Callej6n de! Homo, and settlement spread over a wider geo­graphic area, encompassing the distributary-delta zone and areas upriver along the Guerenguito and Blanco drainages. The ceramic data suggest some continuity from Middle to Late Postclassic times; however, given the dearth of Late Postclassic sherds at El Sauce, we suspect El Sauce had been abandoned prior to the founding of Callej6n de! Homo. 
The Middle Postclassic period is marked by a concentric pattern of settlement, in which high-sta­tus residences mostly occur in and near El Sauce but generally grade into lower-status residences in the more distant peripheries of the center. The Late Post­classic settlement hierarchy is more difficult to inter­pret, since much terrain in the immediate vicinity of Callej6n del Homo has not yet been surveyed. How­ever, the statistical results suggest a greater concen­tration of wealth in Callej6n de! Homo than earlier at El Sauce; the amount of wealth and prestige held by Callej6n de! Homo's residents far exceeded that of its outlying population. This burgeoning gap between well-off and poor households may reflect the incursion of Aztec imperial control. The relatively high percentages of Aztec-style ceramics (see Smith 1990) from the PALM surveys further support an argument for imperial control in the region. 
Finally, our analysis of sparse collections in the two periods, undertaken to check for the presence of poor households, met with ambiguous results. The data show support for the generation of sparse col­lections from manuring practices (Alcock et al. 1 994; Wilkinson 1982, 1989). However, we cannot rule out the idea that poor, ephemeral households generated

some sparse collections (Stark and Hall 1993), and both processes may have been at work. 
Overall, we demonstrate that ceramics from sys­tematic surface collections can be used to explore changes in the spatial and vertical social-status dimensions of regional occupation. In particular, the changes we examined show effects from the exten­sion of the Aztec empire into south-central Veracruz. We view our findings more as a source of ideas for future investigations than as conclusive results. Mul­tiple lines of investigation, including excavation, will be necessary to pursue these subjects more defini­tively.

Notes 

I. We also attempted to use residential mound height as independent evidence against which the ceramic indications of social differentiation can be evaluated. As Trigger (1 990) 
points out, one of the quintessential, cross-cultural character­istics of high status is the increased energy expended on the construction of "elite" dwellings and elite-sponsored monu­ments. However, the mound heights do not corroborate the patterns of social differentiation inferred from the ceramic data; mounds associated with proposed high-status resi­dences are generally similar in height to mounds associated with other residences. This muted effect probably reflects the fact that people generally favored residential occupations on higher ground and frequently reoccupied mounds from ear­lier periods (see Stark and Hall 1993). Another factor is mod­ern irrigation agriculture on the north bank of the Blanco River, where the Late Postclassic center of Callej6n del Homo is located. Intensive farming has leveled many resi­dential mounds in the vicinity of the center. Consequently, reoccupation and disturbance may have interferred with any relationship between mound height and the Postclassic ceramic inventories. 
2. 
Another provincial town in the area mentioned in colo­nial documents is Puctla, along the Acula River, a distribu­tary of the Papaloapan. Unfortunately, unlike Tlacotalpan, Tlalixcoyan, and Cotaxtla, Puctla did not become a colonial center, and its location is now unknown. 

3. 
Stirling's (1943) project at Cerro de las Mesas provides the most detailed local excavation data for this period (Drucker 1943). Largely on the basis of Vasquez's (1990) classification system, Curet et al. (1994) seriated surface col­


lections from the Central Block around Cerro de las Mesas, including El Sauce (Figure 2). They refined Drucker's (1943) two-part division of the Postclassic materials, which they ascribed to the Middle and Late Postclassic periods through cross-dating. 

4. 
The Mixtequilla is a loosely defined geographic term encompassing a subarea of ancient cultural development in the western lower Papaloapan basin, centered around the modern town of Ignacio de la Llave, also known popularly as La Mixtequilla. Because this subarea is indistinct in the Late Postclassic period, we refer to the survey locale as the west· em lower Papaloapan region or the lower Blanco region. 


5. 
During the systematic collections, the survey team examined all artifacts within a measured area, which was coded according to ground visibility. Because residential mounds are small, a collection square could be laid out to cover the mound or a large portion of it, e.g., a 20-x-20m or 30-x-40m area, selecting the portion with the best visibility. Systematic collections are key for our analysis because they assure consistent representation probabilities for all ceramic types. "Grab samples" tend to favor more readily recognized or diagnostic sherds. 

6. 
The value of 20 is a compromise intended to isolate the larger Postclassic collections but retain a robust number of them (n = 277). The use of rims provides a basis for assum· ing that all vessels can be represented. Variations in rim diameter that affect the proportions of types are less marked than the effects of body sherds, as large jars produce a dis-1 proportionate number of body sherds. 


Also, the coma! production assemblages identified by Curet (1993) were eliminated from the unmixing procedure to avoid biasing the results. The high proportion of comales relative to other types in these collections would skew the 
contribution coefficients. The excluded collection numbers for the proposed comal-production areas are: 395, 495, 555, 556, 506, 606, 607, 609, 63 1, 637, 722, 743, 1002, 1006. 1013, 1015, 1176, 1177, 1502, 1756.

We regressed each collection against the calibration sets using the linear regression function of SYSTAT. The type counts for each collection were entered as the dependent variables, and the calibration sets, as the independent vari­ables. This process was long and tedious, since each collec­tion was regressed against the calibration sets individually. Conceivably, a more efficient batch-processing program could be created, but we know of no statistical packages that offer that option. All calibration sets were included as inde­pendent variables in the first run. Negative or zero-value con­tribution coefficients provided the rationale for eliminating one or more calibration sets in subsequent runs (Kohler and Blinman 1987:17). We also eliminated calibration sets in some cases where the contribution coefficient was a very low positive number ( < 5) with a standard error greater than the coefficient itself (but never after the first run), assuming these coefficients were erroneous and/or insignificant. The same procedure and evaluation criteria were used for each subsequent run until only positive contribution coefficients remained for a given collection. 

8. 
Definitive ceramic types include Dull Buff Polychrome, El Sauce unslipped types, White-and-black-on­red polychromes, frieze-motif types, and interior-banded types for the Middle Postclassic period; Aztec III-style Black-on-orange and Texcoco Molded helped define the Late Postclassic assemblages (see Stark 1995 for type descrip­tions) (Table 1). Other types, although not temporally defin­itive, tend to occur in far greater proportions in one period or the other, and these types were also considered when making period designations as "probability" assessments. Some types were in use during both periods, including comales, Guinda (red-slipped wares), and local-style Black-on-orange (Curet et al. 1994: 19); such types could not be used to make period designations.

K-means utilizes nonhierarchical clustering, which means that collections can potentially change cluster assign­ments according to the number of cluster solutions. In other words, as the number of clusters increases, new cluster "cen­troids" are created, which yields the potential for reassign­ment to different cluster groups. This flexible operation is impossible with hierarchical clustering procedures, which produce dendrograms that work in a more "linear" fashion. The optimal clustering solution can be ascertained by observ­ing the trend of SSE (Sum of the Squared Errors) values as the number of clusters increases (Blankholm 1991; Gregg et al. 1991; Kintigh 1990; Kintigh and Ammerman 1982; Simek et al. 1985). The SSE is the sum of the squared distances from each point in a cluster to that cluster's centroid. The objective of the k-means operation is to reduce the SSE val­ues for each cluster by assigning every point to the nearest cluster centroid. Optimal clustering solutions occur where 



the slope of the observed SSE trend-line decreases from its previous downward trajectory (downward because an increase in the number of cluster centroids will necessarily reduce SSE values to some degree). The significance of the cluster solutions can be determined by comparing the observed plot line against random runs, obtained using a Monte Carlo estimation procedure (Kintigh 1990; Kintigh and Ammerman 1982). For this analysis we assessed the sig­nificance of the observed results against 25 random runs using a k-means program designed by Keith Kintigh and Hans Blankholm (Kintigh 1999).

The 30-sherd minimum used for this analysis is based on the central limit theorem, which stipulates a minimum batch size of at least 30 items to derive a normal distribution and, hence, a reliable sample unit (see, e.g., Drennan [1996:108-109] for more explanation). 

11. 
Although technically a polychrome, Fondo Sellado's principle decoration is the stamped base; commonly a red rim band delimited by a black lines adorns the interior, orange­slipped sidewall. The labor investment on Fondo Sellado is more akin to Late Postclassic bichromes, some of which exhibit complicated painted designs. 

12. 
Ancient Mesoamerica lacked draft animals. If manure fertilization was practiced, much of the manure used was probably human-derived. Wilkinson (1982, 1989) suggests human waste was collected along with other settlement­derived trash and used in manuring agricultural fields located in the peripheries of settlements in the Middle East. It is pos­sible ancient Mesoamericans used a similar practice to increase productivity. 

13. 
We have no evidence that worked sherds or sherd disks, or any preferential reuse, has affected type frequencies during the Postclassic (or any other period). Also, we do not assume that sherds deposited as a result of manuring reflect the use of vessels to haul garbage and nightsoil, as they would not necessarily break in a field as a result of that use. Baskets would be a more likely transport container due to their lightness. Sherds that might be deposited in manuring would have been part of household debris. 

14. 
A second agriculture-related factor is the presence of field houses. Temporary shelters built at fields might gener­ate some vessel debris. This agricultural activity would also generate assemblages slightly "poorer-looking" than the overall type percentages because elaborately decorated serv­ing bowls would be unlikely at field houses. At present, we cannot factor out any field house debris from nightsoil manuring.

"An adventurous quest to understand the flutes of the ancient Americans of the Andes. In learning how the instruments may have been played, we are taken on a journey through contemporary and age-old rituals, to 
discover an aesthetic part of a culture known more for 
its monuments and its precipitous fall to the Spanish." -Donald R. Hill, State University of New York, Oneonta In the first comprehensive synthesis of Andean musical instruments, Dale Olsen assesses three decades' worth of anthropological findings from diverse collections, museums, tombs, and temples. Although the instruments are analyzed in great detail, Olsen's is original among studies of pre-Cohimbian music-part musical quest, part adventure of the mind, he considers not only why and when the instruments were played, but exactly how.
