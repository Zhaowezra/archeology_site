LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 7, No. 2, 1996] 
understand that several pledges and promises are in order. Most importantly, we are committed to get­ting the journal back on schedule by the end of the year. We have learned that once publication is late, returning to schedule is not easy, since copyediting and printing schedules then must be doubled up (much like the proverbial pig moving through the body of the python). Nevertheless, with the help of Janet Walker (the journal's Managing Editor) and the support of the Society's Executive Board, when you open the journal this December our cover date should once again match your calendar. Please be assured that the manuscript copy for our first three issues was all prepared and submitted in advance of our deadlines, and we are doing all that we can to return Latin American Antiquity to its intended schedule. 
We also pledge to review and return your submitted manuscripts with greater speed. Although we promise a decision on all papers in four to six months, our practice to date has been to reach a deci­sion on every manuscript in no more than ninety days. We hope to maintain this shorter time frame for most of the year, although some delays may occur in the summer when so many archaeologists are away from their desks. One of the ways that we have expedited the review process is through the use of electronic mail to query potential manuscript reviewers. If you are interested in reviewing manu­scripts for Latin American Antiquity, please contact Gary Feinman by email (gfeinman@ facstaff.wisc.edu) or letter with your email address (providing you have one) and the areas/topics that you are interested in reviewing. 
We would like to thank David Pendergast for his bits of sage advice and for easing our transition to editorship. We also acknowledge the work that he did on many of the manuscripts that appear here and in the next three issues. A number of forthcoming papers were fully accepted by David, including a manuscript by one of us (Linda Manzanilla) that is to be published in the forthcoming September issue. This paper was positioned in the publication queue at the time that the recent editorial transition took effect. 
In closing, we wish to encourage your suggestions for the journal and recommendations for articles that you would like to write for or read in Latin American Antiquity. If you have a question, idea, or problem, please feel free to contact either of us (for Linda Manzanilla: lmanza@servidor.unam.mx), Managing Editor Janet Walker (janet_walker@saa.org), or the journal's editorial staff in Madison, Wisconsin (latamaq@macc.wisc.edu). We look forward to hearing from you.
