6:41-94) and those discovered by Hermes at Topoxte should be considered Holmul I on the basis of the pre­dominance of polychrome vessels with bulbous mam­miform or "tapir-head" tetrapod supports. 
The one major disagreement that I have with this vol­ume is the continued use of the term "Protoclassic." The term has so much past baggage that its use does nothing more than compound the confusion, in addition to neces­sitating one more recital of who has used the term when, where, and in what sense. The distinction between the earlier and later facets (or Protoclassic l and 2) is extremely important in the development of lowland Maya ceramics. It cannot be divorced from time as Pring and Brady et al. intend to do. The two facets are obviously sequent. The earlier is predominantly associated with waxy ware types that mark the Preclassic and the later associated with glossy types and polychromes that mark the Early Classic. At Tikal, for example, the Ci mi ceramic complex is typologically and stratigraphically Preclas­sic and Manik 1 and 2 unequivocally Early Classic. To say that these are at the same time Protoclassic can only result in such monstrosities as referring to Holmul 1 as "our late, or second, early Tzakol horizon Protoclassic facet" (Brady et al 1998:31 ). 
The importance of the ceramic changes can be lost in the midst of such confusing verbiage. I would suggest that the solution to the confusion is to enter these stages of ceramic development as subperiods of the standard sequence. I have long eschewed the use of the term "Pro­toclassic" and have referred to Tikal Cimi as "Terminal Preclassic." Manik 1-2 and their equivalents elsewhere could then become "Initial Early Classic." In sum, we have come a long way since the first use of the term "Pro­toclassic." Pring's volume marks a major advance in clar­ifying and understanding an important period of ceramic change. The material he presents will make it possible for ceramic specialists to continue in a more informed manner the research that must still be done as new mate­rial becomes available.

This volume contains 24 contributions that examine various aspects of Maya history and of contemporary developments in the Maya area. The volume is based on a symposium, entitled "500 Years of Maya Survivalism," which was held at the 50th International Congress of Americanists in Warsaw, Poland, in July 2000. The diverse chapters are organized into five sec­tions. For the convenience of the reader, references fol­low each individual chapter. 
The first section, "Maya Ethnicity and Ethnogenesis," deals with a current debate on identity, ethnicity, and ethnogenesis. Authors Jon Schackt, Matthew Restall, and Wolfgang Gabbert discuss the questions: at which point in time may we speak of a "Maya ethnicity" and what reasons might have caused this development? Schackt's general introduction to the topic is complemented by the studies of Restall and Gabbert, analyzing Yucatec eth­nohistorical sources in regard to the self-identification of indigenous people. 
"Structures of Persistence in Pre-Colonial and Early­Colonial Times," the second section, contains approaches to the discovery of Maya persistence patterns from pre­Colonial to Colonial periods in the archaeological, eth­nohistoric, and iconographic context. Diane Z. Chase and Arlen F. Chase compare the archaeological data of the Classic site of Caracol with those of Santa Rita Corozal, an ancient site that was settled from 1200 B.C. through the present. Lorraine A. Williams-Beck exam­ines sociopolitical dynamics in the Canpech region dur­ing the Late Postclassic and early Colonial period. Geoffrey E. Braswell discusses K'iche'an culture and identity between 1450 and 1550. Tsubasa Okoshi Harada examines the individual case of Gaspar Antonio Chi. He illustrates how this Maya intellectual glorified the impor­tance of his family, the Xiu, in pre-Colonial Yucatec his­tory. Constance Cortez considers female identity in the early Colonial period by iconographic presentations of indigenous women. 
The theme "Strategic Accommodation in Religious Contexts" (Section 3) contains three studies on the spir­itual conquest of the Maya area. Murdo J. MacLeod examines the transmission of the European cofradfa sys­tem to the people of Guatemala and compares the insti­tution in these two settings. Marfa Dolores Palomo Infante takes the cofradfa system as an example to demon­strate the processes of change and adaptation amongst Tzotziles and Tzeltales (Chiapas). Finally, John F. Chuchiak presents ethnohistoric data on the continuation of traditional Yucatec religious cults during the colonial epoch. 
The fourth section, "New Perspectives on Nineteenth­Century 'Rebels,"' includes ethnohistoric and linguistic contributions on the history of military conflicts in the Maya area. Don E. Dumond and William J. Folan dis­cuss the topic of Maya cohesiveness in regard to the orga­nization of Maya military and religious leadership during the Yucatec Caste War. Ines de Castro's article offers a detailed study of the military-political organization of the Pacfficos de! Sur, a group that separated from the rebel­lious Yucatec Maya during the Caste War.
