The site of Casas Grandes (or Paquimé), Chihuahua isone of the largest and most important archaeologicalsites in the Northwest of México and the Southwest of the United States. From 1958 to 1961, the Joint CasasGrandes Expedition (JCGE) under the direction ofCharles C. Di Peso of the Amerind Foundation and EduardoContrerasSánchezoftheInstitutoNacionalde Antropología e Historia conducted research at the site.In the largest international collaborative excavations inthehistoryoftheNorthwest/Southwest(NW/SW),theyuncovered11roomblocks,anelitetomb,ritualmounds,two ball courts, tons of ceramics, lithics and shell arti-facts, hundreds of skeletons of macaws and their pens,and copper from West Mexico. Di Peso returned to theAmerind and worked on the laboratory analyses and

publication of the research for 13 years. In 1974, theAmerind Foundation published the final report in eightexhaustive volumes. In these volumes, Di Peso pro-posed that Pochteca traders from the mesa central ofMéxico had built Casas Grandes. They came as tradersto acquire turquoise from the NW/SW in return forMesoamericangoodssuchascopperbells,macaws,andceramics. They also imposed Mesoamerican cults andgodsonthelocalpopulation.DiPeso sideaswereorig-inal and highly controversial, and they sparked decadesof research to evaluate them. 
Fortyyears afterthe publication ofDiPeso s monu-mental report, a group of 16 scholars gathered in anadvancedseminarattheAmerindFoundationtodiscuss thestateofarchaeologicalknowledgeinChihuahuaandto critically examine how our understanding of CasasGrandes has advanced since the JCGE. This book pre-sents the results of this seminar in nine chapters. Thevolumeeditors,PaulMinnisandMichaelWhalen,beginthevolumewithanintroductionthatsummarizesprevi-ous research on Casas Grandes.The following chaptersdiscuss the economy, chronology, history, religion, andregional organization, placing Paquimé in broader geo-graphic perspectives.The volume does an excellent jobof reviewing the debates about the site, summarizingwhat we know and directing archaeologists to theresearch questions that we need to answer.
TheJCGEandmostsubsequentresearchersfocusedprimarilyontheMedioperiod(A.D.1200tolate1400s)whenCasasGrandesachieveditsgreatestgrandeur.TwochaptersdiscusstheperiodsbeforeandaftertheMedio.JaneH.KellyandMichaelT.Searcy schapterdiscussestheViejoperiod(A.D.700to1200).Theyidentifymuchmore regional variation in the period than Di Peso hadoriginally observed. They conclude that complexity atPaquimé emerged from the widespread Viejo PeriodratherthanfromthepacksofPochtecatraders.DavidA.Philips Jr. and Eduardo Gamboa consider the Tardíoperiod and the question of the end of Paquimé. Theyreviewthevariousanswersthatarchaeologistshavepro-posedtothisquestion,rejectsome,andsuggesthowoth-ers might be tested.
Five chapters form the core of the book and coverMedio-periodPaquiméandtheCasasGrandesarea.PaulMinnis and Michael Whalen discuss ecology and foodproduction both atthe site and in the region.They sum-marizerecentresearchthattookadvantageoftechniquesnot available to the JCGE to reconstruct the food econ-omythatallelsewasbasedon.TheJCGE sexcavationsrevealedaplethoraofcraftobjects,includingpolychromepottery, metates, shell, turquoise, and copper objects.They also found evidence for the husbandry of turkeysand scarlet macaws. Gordon F. M. Rakita and Rafael Cruz discuss how the production of these objects andbirds was organized at Paquimé. Much of the debate abouttherelationshipofCasasGrandestoMesoamericafocuses on religious iconography. Christine S. VanPooland Todd L. VanPool review recent research that con-siders Di Peso s inference of Mesoamerican deities and cults in Casas Grandes Religion. They conclude thatCasasGrandesistheNW/SWsitewiththebestevidenceofMesoamericanreligiousprinciples,butthattheyman-ifest in different ways than they did further south.Theyalso emphasize the importance of shamanism in thesepractices. Michael E. Whalen and Todd Pitezel expandbeyondthesiteofPaquiméitselftolookatthesettlementpattern of the region. One of their most important con-clusions is that Di Peso s population estimates for thesiteandtheregionaretoohigh.JonE.DouglasandA. C.MacWilliams look beyond the environs of the site toconsiderthewholeof the Casas Grandes area, coveringmost of northern Chihuahua and extending into Sonoraon the west. 
The last two chapters of thebook examine the inter-actionsandconnectionsofCasasGrandesatthescaleof the NW/SW culture area and into Mesoamerica. JoséLuisPunzoandM.ElisaVillalpandoreviseearlierideasabout the relations of Paquimé to the south and west.Theyreviewcurrentscholarshiponthesite srelationshipto Mesoamerica and conclude that there is no evidence tosupportamercantilemodel.Lookingtothewest,how-ever, they find a strong relationship with theTrincherasTradition of Sonora. The chapter provides a good briefintroduction to the archaeology of northern México.Linda S. Cordell turns her attention to the relationshipof Paquiméto theAncestral Pueblo ofthe southwesternUnited States. She dismisses the idea that Paquimé wasa city and instead finds it comparable in size and com-plexity to Pueblo IV towns in the Río Grande valley.
AncientPaquiméandtheCasasGrandesWorldverysuccessfullyachievesitsgoalofsummarizingourcurrentknowledge of Casas Grandes and of charting the pathforfutureresearch.Thebookbothreflectsandamplifiesthe enduring legacy of Charles Di Peso and the JCGE.Students who wish to initiate research on Paquimé andthe Casas Grandes area should start their studies with this book. Scholars who work in other regions shouldturn to this book for a synthesis of what we know andneed to know about the site and region.
