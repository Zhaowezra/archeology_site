
KNOCK! KNOCK! WHO’STHERE?ANETHNOARCHAEOLOGICAL 
APPROACH IN FRENCH GUIANA 

Stéphen Rostain 
Amazonia and the Guianas possess exceptional potential for ethnoarchaeological studies because of the precolumbian heritage of modern-day Amerindian people. Surprisingly, minimal scholarship of this nature has been conducted in the South American lowlands. On the French Guiana coast, Maillard, a small Palikur village, was abruptly abandoned in 1990. I initiated an ethnoarchaeological study to pinpoint important differences between the interpretation of archaeological and ethnographic data. I recorded the topography of features and remains, compiled an inventory of artifacts and the contents of discard areas, inventoried the cultivated trees present, and described the characteristics of the surroundings. After analyzing the data using classical methods of archaeological inference to obtain a complete reconstruction of the village and the customs of its inhabitants, I invited the chief into his now-abandoned village to describe the settlement as it was while inhabited. In the twenty years since, I have made several visits to track the natural degradation of the site. This ethnoarchaeological approach shows that archaeologists dealing with .eld data can make many mistakes. Conversely, ethnographic accounts are distorted by the cultural rules and interdictions of interviewees. This experiment suggests the need for prudence in our interpretations and hypotheses, especially in the tropical lowlands, where archaeological preservation is particularly poor. 
La Amazonía y las Guayanas ofrecen un potencial excepcional para los estudios etnoarqueológicos, dado que su actual población indígena es heredera de los grupos precolombinos que habitaron las mismas regiones. Sorprendentemente, se han realizado escasas investigaciones de esta disciplina en las tierras bajas de América del Sur. En 1990, en la costa de la Guayana Francesa, la pequeña aldea de Palikur fue abandonada de manera repentina. Esto brindó la oportunidad de iniciar de inmediato un estudio etnoarqueológico original. De esta manera, se organizó un trabajo arqueológico de campo en el asentamiento, a partir del cual se registró la topografía de rasgos y restos, se realizó un inventario de artefactos y contenidos de las áreas de desecho y se describieron los árboles cultivados y los terrenos cercanos, entre otras tareas. Los datos obtenidos fueron estudiados para evaluar las interpretaciones que se podrían hacer siguiendo procedimientos clásicos, con el .n de obtener una reconstrucción completa del pueblo y las costumbres de sus habitantes. Una vez concluido el estudio arqueológico, se invitó al jefe del pueblo abandonado para que explicara cómo era el asentamiento anteriormente. Luego, durante veinte años, se efectuaron varias visitas para seguir los procesos naturales de deterioro del sitio y la desaparición de los rasgos antrópicos. El estudio desembocó en la constatación de las grandes diferencias existentes entre la interpretación de los datos arqueológicos y los etnográ.cos. Este tipo de metodología etnoarqueológica mostró que los arqueólogos que dependen exclusivamente de datos de campo pueden cometer varios errores. Por el contrario, la entrevista etnográ.ca no permite distorsiones, puesto que está profundamente in.uenciada por las reglas y prohibiciones culturales. Este experimento incita a una mayor prudencia en nuestras interpretaciones e hipótesis, en especial en las tierras bajas tropicales, cuyo contexto arqueológico es bastante pobre.

nthe Amazonian region, it is very common for archaeologists to base their interpreta­tions on ethnographic comparisons because of the perceived continuity of Amerindian cul­tures from precolumbian times. Nevertheless, 
this can lead to signi.cant misunderstandings because modern Amerindian cultures of Ama­zonia differ in important ways from prehis­toric ones.Similarly, ethnicattribution does not always correspond to differences in material culture (Duin 2014;Mans2014).Onesolutionto theproblemof checkingthevalidityof compar­isons between contemporary and ancient native

cultures could be the ethnoarchaeological method. Ethnoarchaeology can be de.ned as the use of ethnography to answer archaeolog­ical questions (see Supplemental Information 1). Ethnoarchaeology can also refer to using archaeological approaches in an ethnographic context. My ethnoarchaeological experiment was conducted in a modern Amerindian village using archaeological methodology to evaluate the validity of inferential reasoning used by archaeologiststoexplaintheir data. 
Amazonia offers exceptional potential for ethnoarchaeological studies because the Amerindian people residing in this region are the successors of precolumbian societies. Nevertheless, few researchers have conducted such investigations in Amazonia up to now. Annette Laming-Emperaire and colleagues (1978) conducted an ethnoarchaeological investigationinaXetásettlementin Brazil, with a special focus on the lithic technology that was still being used. Later, students of Donald Lathrap(DeBoer and Lathrap 1979)conducted ethnoarchaeological research in various areas of the South Americanlowlands.Inthe eastern foothills of the Peruvian Andes, Peter Roe and Peter Siegel(1982;Siegel and Roe 1986) evaluated the organization of two Shipibo dwelling compounds, one from an inhabited contextandtheother oneinarecently abandoned house, to establish correspondences between use areas and discard areas. Siegel (1990, 1991) also studied the relationship between demographic and architectural organization in a Waiwai village of Guyana. James Zeidler (1983)madea completeinventoryof a modern Achuar householdofEcuador and classi.ed the importance of each group of artifacts and each activity area. 
Since these studies, little ethnoarchaeology has been conducted in Amazonia until quite recently,when researchersbegan to study mod­ernvillages.For instance,I usedethnoarchaeol­ogy to identify the organization of a domestic .oor during a horizontal excavation of a pre­columbian proto-Jivaro houseinthe Sangay site, Ecuador (Rostain 2006, 2011). Brenda Bowser (2004) and John Patton (Bowser and Patton 2004) analyzed the gender division of activi­ties and spaces in Achuar and Kichwa houses of Ecuador.Gustavo Politis(2007) conducted illuminatingand detailedresearchonthe occupa­tion, environment, settlement patterns, mobility, technology, food procurement, ideology, and many other aspects of the Colombian hunter-gatherer culture of theNukak.Afew other eth­noarchaeological studies have been conducted in Amazonia(see Supplemental Information2). During the past twenty years, some doctoral dissertations have used ethnoarchaeology in the South American EasternLowlands (see Supple­mental Information 3), but few focused on the Amerindian house. 
In 1990, I conducted an ethnoarchaeologi­cal investigation in a small Amerindian village near the coastal road a few kilometers west of Cayennein French Guiana. Before that,in 1989, I regularly worked with some men of this vil­lage during my research on precolumbian raised .elds on the western coast of French Guiana (Rostain 2012). By October 1990, the village had been completely abandoned. I located the former occupants, who had migrated toasecond village calledKamuyene, located 3.1kmtothe west.Isawthe opportunityto conductan original investigation in the deserted settlement. This settingforms the basis forthe ethnoarchaeolog­ical experiment in archaeological methodology featured in this paper. 
First, I conducted archaeological .eldwork at thesite,including mapping andexcavations. Then,Iinterpreted this datawithout employing the past inhabitants of the village as a source. Although it is impossible to avoid unconscious in.uences,Iattemptedtobe unbiasedby basing interpretations only on features and artifacts. Obviously, a culture cannot be de.ned only on the basis of material remains although these can containclues that de.ne theinhabitant identity. This work was conducted with the intention to determine the characteristicsofthe material cul­ture and thesettlement characteristicsofthe for­mer occupants. following the culture-historical conceptasitis widely understood among archae­ologists working in the South American Low­lands. In spite of centuries of colonization, hybridization, transculturation, and integration, Iargue that each modern Amerindian village of theGuianas still presentsethnicspeci.cities and particular traits that differentiate them from other

settlements. Thesetraits constituteasetof clues that canhelpidentifytheoriginoftheinhabitants. The next step in the study was to meet the former captainofthe village,a titlegiventothe most important personinan Amerindian village in French Guiana and the legal representative to French authorities. I returned to the village with the captain, whogavemehis interpretation of the remains. I compared the archaeological inferences with the ethnographic evidence to reevaluatethe interpretation. Since this study,I have always tried to apply the lessons learned from it to my subsequent work. 
Two ethnoarchaeological studies have been conductedinthe Americasthatare comparableto my approach. FrederickLange and CharlesRyd­berg(1972)conducted archaeological .eldwork in a recently abandoned Amerindian settlement in northernCosta Rica. Theythen checked their interpretationsbyinterviewing theformerinhab­itantsofthe houses.Robson Bonnichsen(1973) carried out a similar study in a recently aban­doned Amerindian houseinthe centralCanadian Rockies known among archaeologistsasMillie’s camp. They used the activity area concept and checked archaeological interpretations against the accountsofthe former inhabitants.My con­clusions aresimilartothe resultsof thesestudies. Duringthesame period(endofthe 1980s),Fabi­enne de Pierrebourg(1999)conducted doctoral research on precolumbian and present-day Maya domestic structures in Mexico using a similar approach. More widely, several scholars have published work on formation processes of the archaeological record and on the ethnoarchae­ology of abandonment processes(Cameron and Tomka 1993; Lucas2012;Schiffer1987). 


Geographic Setting 
The French Guiana coastal zone is part of the broad Quaternary sedimentary plain stretching some1,600km betweenthemouthoftheAma­zonandtheOrinoco Delta.Thisplainis relatively narrowinFrench Guiana, whereitis 5–40km wide. Outcrops of the rocky shelf emerge only on theFrench Guiana coastinthe formof small hills in Oyapock Bay, Cayenne Island, and the lower valley of the Kourou River, but the rest of the coast is low and partially .ooded. The young coastalplainisdifferentiatedfromtheold coastalplain.The formerisalow swampyplain borderedbymangrovesonthemud .atsalongthe seashore. It is subject to tidal in.uences, and the seawater can .oodthemangroveasfaras2km intotheinterior.Ontheold coastalplain,marshes are cut by narrow and elongated sandy ridges parallel to the seashore. These are old beaches that measure some tens of meters wide and can reach more than 100 km long. Thesedry sandy ridgesarepreferred locationsfor Amerindiansto build their villages. 
Atthebeginningofthe colonial period, Euro­peans did notfavorthislandscape, considering it inadequate for settlement and agriculture, with noxious air that provoked lethal fever. In contrast,precolumbian Amerindians intensively occupied this savannah environment and pro­foundlymodi.ed thelandscape (Rostain 2008). For that reason, numerous archaeological sites havebeen found on thesesandy formations along the Guianas coast. After their initial limited occupations on the coast, European settlers pro­gressively advanced into the region during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, chasing away the Amerindian people. 
The Maillard settlement was located in the traditional territoryoftheKali’na,aKarib group, west of Cayenne Island. During the seventeenth century, the French Guiana coast was divided into two Amerindian territories, with Cayenne Island as a boundary. The eastern coast was the territory of the Palikur, an Aruak group, and the western coast, including Cayenne Island, was Kali’na territory. As late as the eighteenth century, manyKali’na villages were settledjust west of Cayenne Island (Hurault 1989). Later, Europeans pushed Amerindians farther to the west,tothe Mana River(Collomb 2015). These twogroups wereatwarthroughout the colonial period, which was characterized by temporary alliances and occasional battles. Thepresent-day territorial situation is still the same, with the Palikur essentially locatedintheLower Oyapock andin the neighboringBrazilianstateof Amapá and theKali’na settledinsomevillages westof the city ofKourou. 
The historical Palikur nucleus was located along the Urucauá River in the Uaça Basin, in the northern part of the Brazilian state of

Amapá (Nimuendaju 2008). At the time of the European conquest, thePalikur hadatrade net­work that includedvarious ethnicgroups settled betweentheAraguariand OyapockRivers.Dur­ingthe eighteenth century, numerous communi­tiesfound refuge in northern Amapá, leading to cultural mixing and assimilation. This resulted in theformationofthe three Amerindian ethnic groups in this region today: the Palikur (who speak an Arawak language),Karipuna, and Uaça (Grenand and Grenand 1987). In recent times, some Kali’na also settled in the Uaça Basin. In 1982, 1,026Palikur were reportedtolivein French Guiana and the Amapá State in Brazil. Ten yearslater,this number had risento1,480 (Grenand and Grenand 1994). 
Today the coastal Amerindians inhabit two main areas at the two extremes of the French Guiana coast: theKali’na area along thelower ManaRiverinthewestandthePalikur areaalong thelower OyapockRiverinthe east. Along the restofthewestern coast,onlyafewsmallKali’na villages arefound, generally settledonthe sandy ridges notfarfromNational Road1, whichruns east-west paralleltothe seashore. 
TheMaillard villagewaslocated onaslight elevation in the old coastal plain, 6 km east of themoderntownofMacouria and 235msouth of National Road1(4° 571 5911 N, 52° 261 2111 W). This site offered an advantageous view of the savannah, easy access to the main coastal road, and proximity to the town of Macouria (Figure1). Inhabitants were close to various biotopes—forested patches to the south, season­ally .ooded savannahs surrounding the village, and mangrove and sea to the north—allowing accesstoresources fromtheseareas.Theylacked only a nearby freshwater source because the closestriver,the Macouria,was7kmaway. 
A soil core from the center of the village showed two main pedologic strata. A layer of brown to yellowish-brown, clayish sand was found between0and40cmdeep.From40to60 cm, the soil progressively became multicolored clay (bright brown, red, and grayish). The soil was very dry in comparison with the .ooded surroundings.Insum,thevillagehadbeen settled on a low coastal formation, with a thin sandy layer lying above a clayish substratum, which may have been formed from a sedimentary origin or from an altered rocky substratum. In inhabiting the savannah, Amerindians opted to settleindryspots,freeof .ooding(Figure2).All thearchaeological test pits made between houses andin middensshowedathinsuper.cial cultural layer,reachinga depthoflessthan5 cm. 
The Maillard village was studied in two stages: .rst, classical archaeological .eldwork at thesitewasfollowedby aninterpretation of the collected data; then,a knowledgeableformer occupantof thevillagewasinterviewed. Field­work included topographical mappingofvarious features, several test pits, and an inventory of remains and midden contents. 


TheArchaeologicalApproach 
Archaeological .eldwork was conducted in November 1990 at the end of the dry season, and several visits were made over the course of thesubsequentyear.Vegetationwas stilllowand sparse, so remains and pathways were clearly visible. Moreover, a recent savannah .re had cleaned the central partofthe village. Thesettle­ment stretchedover38mfromnorthtosouthand 50m fromwestto east,but an additional house waslocated22m eastofthe eastern border. 
More than 100 planimetric measurements weretakenusingahorizontal alidadein magnetic orientation at scale 1/200. Altitude measure­ments con.rm that the village was located on the highest point of the .ood-prone savannah, so that it remained dry even during the rainy season. The .rst step was to locate posts and postholesinorderto reconstructthemapofeach individual house and of the latrines. Garbage dumps were then located and measured.A map of internal pathways was drawn. Planted trees were located and theirspecies determined.Two wooden benches, which constituted the largest artifacts, were located. Finally, houses were numbered forthe study.Acompletemapof the settlementwasdrawn showing postholes, house plans,latrines, pathways,middens, and discard areas, as well as notable artifacts, planted trees, and the centralplaza(Figure3). 
Settlement and Architecture 
During thetopographicalwork,remainsof seven houses were identi.ed(Figure4): onlytraces

posts. All houses had been built on low stilts. Of houses 6 and 7, only postholes, sometimes including partofthe post, were still visible. Floor beams of houses 1 and 2 were preserved. In house 3, posts and beams supporting the .oor, horizontal beams, and some palmleavesof the roof were intact.House4had lost itswalls and .oor, but still had its palm roof. House 5, the bestpreserved, seemed to have been abandoned more recently than the others, with its wooden posts, leaf roof, and raised .oor still in good condition. The roof was made of maripa palms (Maximiliana maripa, Arecaceae) and theraised .oorwasmadeof split trunksof acai(Euterpe oleracea,Arecaceae).Several utilitarian artifacts were abandoned on the .oor: an old tricycle, un.nished baskets, a pottery pitcher with lateral neck, a dented aluminum cooking pot full of coloring bark, and letters from employers. The material remnants and overall good condition of house5gavetheimpressionofahastyand recent departure,moresothan theother houses. 
Various featuresinadditiontothe houses were located and identi.ed(Figure5). Inhabitants of the settlement used only two latrines, located apart from the houses and on the northern and western peripheryofthe settlement. Some posts had another function than house support. Posts for clotheslines were distributed along lines at irregular intervals. Others with smaller diame­ter were supports for tables. Pathways and the central plaza were still clearly evident because vegetation had not regrownontheirtrampledand compacted soil. 
Three pathways led to the well, which was located on the northern edge of the settlement. Somegroups,such as thePalikur,regularly dig wellsin theirvillages,eveniftheyhavea stream at theirdisposal nearby.Water wells are common not onlyinmodern Amerindian settlements,but alsoin archaeological sitesofthe Guianas.Most were dug, probably with wooden shovels (Ros­tain 2010), in villages located on sandy coastal formations,especially when thesewerefar from

the village that contained rum and wine bottles. The absenceof similarremainsin other middens suggests that apart fromthe inhabitantsofhouse 5, village residents did not drink alcohol. The only culinary remains were eggshells, some pilesofbroken nuts, and snailshells(Pomacea, Ampullaria crassa, and Neritidae). 
Various useful trees and other plants grew near the houses, including acai palm, cotton(Gossypium barbadense), orange(Citrus sinensis), mango(Mangifera indica), mombin (Spondias mombin), and sugar cane(Saccharum of.cinarum). North of the settlement, just before the road, there was a complex of raised .elds locatedin thalwegs.Distributedinagrid following the curve of thethalwegs,these .elds were square and measured1 min diameter and 60 cm in height. 
Material Artifacts 
Few artifacts manufactured by Amerindians were found, the most notable being two wooden benches on the central plaza (Figure6). An individual bench made out of a wooden trunk and carved roughly in the shape of a bird was found in the ceremonial plaza. This small bench hadbeenplacedagainsta collectivebenchatthe edgeof the centralplaza. Thelatter benchwas madefromabeam370cmlongand10cm wide, squareincross section(Figure6). One endof the benchwassculptedin theshapeofastylized snakehead. The beamwasnot perfectly straight; the snake’s tail was slightly raised. The two sides were decorated with geometrical motifs and diamond shapes, painted in red, blue, and white.The general impression of the decoration evoked a snakeskin. Before being abandoned, this bench had been mutilated: thelast13 cmof thetailhadbeensawnoff.Thecut fragmentwas found near the bench. 
Other small material remains were also col­lectedin house5(Figure7).Onegourdbowlhad a rim decorated with incisions painted in black. Onelidofametalcanhadbeen perforatedwitha nailtomakea rasp,presumablytograte coconut (Cocos nucifera) or sweet manioc (Manihot esculenta). This was the only secondary tool we found, made out of a European object and used for a function different than its original purpose. The red bark found in a cooking pot testi.es to an Amerindian activity,probablythe manufacture of a dye for basketry or calabash. Only two Amerindian pottery artifacts were found(Figures7Cand7E).Oneisared painted pitcher.The pitcherisovalin section and has an inclined neck or spout to one side. The pitcher once hadawide handle,butthiswas broken. The second artifact is a small sherd painted with red and white motifs and with one small perforation (7 mm diameter). 
A year after the .rst .eldwork, I returned to the village, but for the most part it had disappeared. House posts had been taken or haddegraded naturally.Vegetationhadregrown, hidingpathwaysandgarbage.Onlythe centerof the ceremonial plazawasstill visible and not yet colonizedbysecondaryvegetation.Various visits weremadeinthe yearsthat followedtotrackthe naturaldegradationofthe siteandthedisappear­ance of features and traces. Twenty years after the.rst .eldwork,inMay 2009,I made another visittothesitewithan ethnobotanisttoevaluate the quantity of remains, useful plants, and the post-abandonment changesinthesettlement.No evidenceof an oldsettlementwasvisible.Even theplanted trees had disappeared, destroyedby the annual savannah .res.This absence of visible remains only twenty years after abandonment indicates that coastal savannah villages may generally leavefew tracesof human occupation. Pawel Gorecki(1985)has pointed out,ina simi­larethnoarchaeological study,that most changes in the archaeological record are effected during the .rst years of abandonment, after which a period of stabilization occurs. 
Itis easytoimagine what features mightbe foundifexcavations were conducted today: post-holes, the well, latrine pits, evacuation canals, and drip lines left by rain streaming along the sides of the houses. The majority of the artifacts, mainly European, were made from perishable raw materials and would have been destroyed. It can be expected that excavation would reveal glass and earthenware containers and few Amerindian pottery vessels.

Themappingof postsand postholesledtothe recognitionofseven housesinvarious conditions of preservation. They were all built on stilts according to the same technique. Such houses resting on short stilts are perfectly adapted to the .ood-prone savannahs of theGuianas coast. 
Simple observation of the architectural style of thewood and palm houses showsthat they were neitherWestern nor creole(theblack community predominant on the French Guiana coast, who livein cement houses),but clearly Amerindian (Roth1924).Theorganizationofthevillage,with a small number of houses, external latrines, a well, pathways, anda centralplaza,wastypical

of many modern Amerindian villages of the Guianas (Rivière 1984). Thelargest housewas locatedjustin frontofthe centralplaza, leading to the inference that the village captain lived in this relatively prestigious building, as is the caseinother Amerindian settlements. Usingthe characteristicsofhabitationfeatures, housesizes, and indigenous birthratesinFrench Guianainthe 1980s,Iproposethat anaveragefamily consisted of threetofour members. Thelarge quantityof baby bottlesinalmostallgarbage pits suggested the presence of children in each house. On the basisoftheseestimates,Ihypothesized thatseven families resided in the settlement, between 21 and 28 persons total. 
All the characteristics seen in the village indicate a sudden departure. Benches were left in the ceremonial plaza. Numerous artifacts in working conditionwerestillin house5and the red bark dye had not been taken. The fact that the collective bench tail had been sawn offcould be interpreted as a ceremonial destruction and a social depositionofthe bench. The abandonment wasestimatedtohavebeenvery recent, between severalweeks andafewmonths beforethe study. 
Dump areas werevery informativeasto daily life and theidentitiesoftheowners becausemost of the houses were associated with speci.c mid-dens.Thefact that themajorityof remainswere fromWesternindustrial societiesimplied that a cash economy was practiced, probably supple­mented by Amerindian products and local food procurement. Snail shells found in the middens indicated that local food sources could include small animals.Inhabitants couldalso collect wild plants fromthe surroundings.For their daily use, they could collect fruit from the trees between the houses. Other basic crops were probably cultivatedin .elds outside thevillage.It seems reasonable to infer that the former occupants cultivatedplantsonthe raised .eldsbuilt northof thesettlement,while complementary fruits grew near the houses. I supposed that game hunting wasprobablypracticed, althoughnoevidenceof this activity had been found. 
Each midden included some common kinds of waste. For instance, most contained baby bottles, indicatingthe presenceofinfantsinmany families. The numerous batteries in thegarbage heaps could be explained by the absence of electricityin thevillage, requiring inhabitantsto use .ashlights. Thehighvolumeof metal,glass, and plastic containers con.rmed an enduring relationship with the European world and the consumptionof various industrialproducts. 
The general absence of alcohol bottles spoke infavorof a religious community ban. That is, most households wereEvangelical,Adventist,or Pentecostal. Evangelical preachers’ forbidding stance on alcohol could wield a strong in.uence on Amerindian populations. The presence of rum and wine bottlesat house5 suggestedthat its inhabitants did drink alcohol. This could be because the inhabitants of house 5 had not converted to Christianity or were Catholic. It must be noted that because of its location at the entrance, occupants of house5 wouldhave receivedmostofthe visitorstothevillage.When Iwas visitingthe villagein 1989,Ialwaysspoke to themaleinhabitantof house5,thinking that hewasthe captain.In reality, duringthedayhe replacedthe captain,whohadasteadyjob outside the settlement. In any case, this distribution of empty alcoholic bottles could represent a reli­giousdifferencelikethatintheLower Oyapock, wheretheEvangelicalPalikurof Persévérance, near Saint-Georges, did not drink alcohol but theCatholicPalikurof theGabaretRiverfarther north still consumed alcoholic beverages. 
Another particularity that was observed was inthehouse4midden,whichwasfullofsparecar parts, suggesting that a handyman or mechanic livedthere. 
No Amerindian product or artifactwasfound inthemiddens,sotheycouldnotbeusedto iden­tifythe originof the occupants.Even thevillage distribution and house characteristics were not clearly identi.ed witha particular ethnicgroup. Forthat reason,otherclueshadtobeused,suchas the Amerindian furniture and artifacts designed in speci.c shapes with recognizable decora­tions.Morphologicaland stylistic featuresofthe wooden benches were compared with examples from Amerindian peoples of the Guianas to determine a cultural attribution. The Maillard village benches appearedtobeofPalikur origin.

Indígena and Museu Kuahí 2009). Individual benchesmayhavethe shapeofabirdor, rarely, a caiman. Theindividual bench in theMaillard villagewasa typicalPalikur bird representation, although simpler and coarser in design. There wasno decorative paint, perhaps becauseit had eroded. This bench found on the central plaza wasinterpretedashaving belongedtothe captain becausethe large house2in front of the central plaza was assumed to have been inhabited by him. 
Palikur collective benches measure from 2 to 4 m in length and may represent a sword­.sh, caiman, or anaconda. Caiman benches are destined for women while anaconda benches, often longer, are reserved for men (Instituto de PesquisaeFormação en Educação Indígena and MuseuKuahí 2009). The bench in Maillard villagewasa representationofan anaconda, and thus probably intended for men. In a Palikur village, individual and collective benches are located on the centralplaza and areused during ceremonies. When not in use, they are turned upside down to avoid their use by evil spirits. They areimportant artifactsfor the community becauseoftheiressentialroleinthe feastsatthe plaza that symbolizes the cultural domain, the center of social life and most important place in the village. 
Abowlmade from halfa calabashwas found abandonedin house4.Itsrimwas decoratedwith a row of small squares, each with a central dot madeby incision and then painted black.Palikur use the boiled bark of Licania heteromorpha (Chrysobalanaceae) to make this pigment. It washypothesized that this motif representsthe neck feathers of the stork Jabiru mycteria,as foundinPalikur iconography(vandenBel 2009). In the same house, the red bark found in a cooking pot testi.ed to the Amerindian activity of manufacturing pigments for basketry or for decorating calabashes. 
The two Amerindian pottery artifacts can be attributed to the same ethnic group, the Kali’na community.The red painted pitcher with a broken handle is only made by the Kali’na. Theglobularshapeof thepitcheris inspiredby theEuropean waterjug(gargoulette in French); its porous walls are made to keep water cool. Kali’na make many of these containers, which they designate by the Karib name watalakan, created by the association of the Dutch words water and kan (jug).The perforated painted sherd wasprobably partof a .owerpot.Inviewofthe technological and decorative characteristics— beige porous paste, red and white drawings, distinctive shape (Tricornot 2007)—there is no doubt that these two ceramics were Kali’na. Such dataindicatethe presenceofamemberof this group in the village or trade relations with Kali’na. 
From all the collected data, it is possible to inferthe presenceof oneortwoethnicgroupsin the village. Creoles are the main contemporary inhabitantsofthis partofthe coast,butthey can be eliminated because the settlement character­istics are clearly Amerindian. Ceramic sherds and the pottery bottle are typically Kali’na, so it is reasonable to think that representatives of this grouplivedinthisvillage.Nevertheless, the two wooden benches are clearly Palikur (as is the half-calabash bowl), so it can be inferred that this group also was represented here. This duality of styleinthe Maillard settlement might re.ect the presence of residents from both the ethnic groups, but I cannot determine which one was dominant. Another possibility is that the village was occupied by one group and had trader relations with theother.Thus, not enough cultural features were found to be sure of the identityof theformerinhabitants. 


ConfrontingArchaeology with Ethnographic Observations 
After completingthe archaeological reconstruc­tion in 1990, I immediately invited Jean N.,1 who was the captain of the Maillard village before its abandonment, to the deserted settle­ment to test the validity of my interpretations. The objective of this exercise was to compare archaeological data against ethnographic facts. Jean was relatively open in his responses, but he remained vague on some points, especially regarding ceremonial artifacts. 
The .rst revelation was the identity of the former inhabitants, who were all Palikur (and called themselves Paykweneh); no resident was Kali’na. Accordingto JeanN.,hewasthe.rst Palikur to settle in Maillard village in 1986.

He was born in Saint-Georges, on the French bank of theOyapock River, and migrated when very young with his parentstoUkumene on the UrucauáRiver. Whenhe cameofage,he returned to Saint-Georges,wherehestayed fortwo years before .ying to Cayenne to work and to seek good health and happiness. In 1986, he decided tobuild his house near Macouria.The same year, hisbrothers and otherPalikur joined himthere. 
The captain’stestimonyenabledusto reexam­ine several of the archaeological interpretations. First, the location of the settlement was not a choice of the inhabitants. Rather, the munici­pal government of Macouria decided to place the settlement far from the town, rejecting the Palikur in the same way that numerous other Amerindian groups in the contemporary Amer­icas were treated. Thus, the inference that a precise choice had been madeby theinhabitants wasinvalidated. 
The captain made a list of the former inhab­itants including the name of the husband (but not the wife) and the number of children in each household. In 1990, 28 people—12 adults and16 children—permanentlylivedinMaillard village, in an area of about 1900 m2 (this area excluded house6,whichwasset back from the settlement). Thus, the evaluation of the number of inhabitants—between 21 and 28—made dur­ing the archaeological work was correct, even if the average number of family members per householdandthe numberofhouses were wrong. TheMaillard village occupantswere: 
House 1: Jean N. (captain) and wife, two 
children; 
House 2: Lucien N. and wife, four children; 
House 3: Elie N. and wife, four children; 
House 4: Stéphane B. and wife, three 
children; 
House 5: YvonF. andwife, threechildren; 
House 6: un.nished house; 
House 7: un.nished house; 
House 8: AbrahamN.and wife. 
The number of residents had .uctuated over time because sometimes Palikur workers had come from Saint-Georges to labor in the sur­rounding pineapple plantations. The captain explained that the village was occupied by its inhabitantsfor onlyfour years becausetheowner oftheland decidedto settlea housingprojectin this area. Banished, most of thePalikur settlers moved awayinMay 1990to settleinanew vil­lage3kmclosertoMacouria.Three individuals stayedin house5until August beforemoving on. 
Kamuyene,the namegiventothenewvillage, is interesting becauseitwasthe nameofafamous Palikur clan. The word kamu means “sun,” and the name signi.es that the people’s eyes shone likethe sun(Grenand and Grenand 1987). This clan, which originated in the Maye Hill on the Cunani River in Amapá, were outsiders whojoined thePalikur and assimilatedintothe community by the beginning of the twentieth century(Nimuendaju 2008).I .rst thought that theinhabitantsofMaillard village were survivors of this clan,butfurther ethnographicinquiry with Jean N. revealed that his family came from a group that had assimilated with thePalikur ata later time.Infact,it seemsthathe couldevenbe aMarounouyene, whichisnotaPalikur clanbuta Maroni Kali’na group.Theclaimof membership in the prestigious Kamuyene clan could not be veri.ed, demonstratingthe practiceofembellish­ingoralhistorybymembersofacommunity.The symbolic dimensionofthe search fora mythical pastisanimportant aspectin some Amerindian groups. For that reason, it is important to be cautiousin ethnographicinterviewswhen asking for genealogical precision. 
In makingthelistofinhabitants,JeanN. omit­tedtwohouses(6and7),soIaskedhimwholived in these houses.He answeredthat no houses had been there. WhenIshowedhim the postholes,he explained that peoplehadbegunworkonthetwo housesbut had never .nished them;atthe time Maillard village was abandoned, the houses had never been inhabited. Thiswasnotobvious from theavailableevidence and features.Anindica­tionofthisfact mighthave been the absenceof garbage dumps associated with these houses,but adispersedmidden locatedjustin frontof house 7resultedinthe conclusionthat these houses had also been occupied and abandoned. Although no discard area was associated with house 6, it is common in Amerindian villages to sweep out thegarbageagainstthe neighbor’s house,so that a dump near one house could have come from another house. Moreover, Jean N. told me that there was a house east of the settlement that I

had not recorded. Theinhabitantsofhouse8had left long beforethe others. 
In the majority of Amazonian villages, the captain’s house is the largest and is usually located in front of the central plaza. It was inferredthat thelarge house2,just eastof the ceremonial plaza, was the captain’s house. “Oh no!” answeredJean N., “Minewasthe small one faraway[house1],at the endof thewestern pathway of the settlement.” The inference of social signi.canceof the centrallocationof the captain’shousewasthusinvalidated.The captain saidhehadnotwantedtolivein frontoftheplaza becauseofthe noise.Instead,hisbrother,Lucien, livedinhouse2.The captaindid con.rmthat the owner of house 4 was a handyman, but not a professional mechanic. 
The analysisof thedistributionof postholes and posts to reconstruct the plan of the build­ings seemedlikeastraightforwardinterpretation. Nonetheless, the multiple errors in the conclu­sions showcase the missteps an archaeologist maymakewhile analyzing remnant architecture. Isawtwoinhabitedand abandoned houseswhen infact theyhad neverbeen .nished nor occupied, andImisseda housethat had actually been used in the peripheryofthe village. 
The two abandoned benches were clearly of Palikur origin, based on their shape and decora­tion. According to Jean N.,the collective bench had been manufactured in Saint-Georges,inthe LowerOyapock.Itwasthen broughtto Maillard villagebycanoe,adif.cultvoyagebyseaofmore than 100 km.The captainwould notgiveaclear explanationforwhy the benchwas abandoned, and argued that he did not know that the tail was cut or why. Perhaps the childrendid it, he explained. This explanation was doubtful, as I learned later that the community split to form twogroupsin1990.Soitcanbe assumedthatthe benchwas ceremonially “killed”by amputation. The individual bench was abandoned because it was partially cracked. Nevertheless, it did not belong to the captain. My attribution of ownershipof this benchwasthus incorrect. 
In fact, few archaeological elements of the settlement had offered concrete clues to the identityof theformer occupants. Moreover,most objects, like the wooden benches, would have been destroyedby time, and thefew nonperish­able artifacts, such as pottery and glass, would have led to the wrong conclusions regarding identity.The identi.cationof anethnicgroup or an archaeological culture is frequently based on the pottery,inspiteof many argumentsagainsta simple correlation(Hodder 1982;Jones 1997). The presence of Kali’na pottery in Maillard village could be explained by the absence of ceramic manufactureinthe village.Nowomen manufactured potteryinthesettlement;thiscraft had almost completely disappeared among the Palikurby the 1980s (Rostain1992). Theclosest Amerindian potters were Kali’na, and thePalikur had to trade with them to obtain Amerindian ceramics. This ethnographic evidence is very interesting for archaeologists because similar phenomena surely occurred in the past. For example, until recently in the Upper Xingu, only one group made pottery, which theytraded to neighboring communities; these communi­tiesrepresented four different linguisticfamilies (Steward 1948). 
Work activities were divided by gender at Maillard village: all men were employed in neighboring pineapple plantations and worked in their own .elds, while women manufactured and sold basketry. In addition to agriculture, men hunted various animals in the nearby for­est, including agouti(Dasyprocta agouti), deer (Mazama americana), tapir(Tapirus terrestris, locally named maïpouri), toucan (Ramphastos sp., locally named gros-bec), and others. They also .shed and collected shell.sh (called man­touni inPalikur)inthe MacouriaRiver.Thepiles of snailshells were correctly interpretedasfood remains. 
The proximity of raised .elds and settle­ments suggested a connection between the two activity areas.Nevertheless, Jeanexplained that the village residents had never cultivated these raised .elds, nor had they even known their function. In reality, the raised .elds were built and used around 800 years ago by Arauquinoid people(Rostain 2010). Similarraised .elds are known along the Guianas coast, in an area 600 km long, from Cayenne Island in French Guiana west to the Berbice River in Guyana (Rostain 2008). They are mostly precolumbian, built between A.D. 300 and 1400 by Barrancoid or Arauquinoid societies. They were used to

cultivate crops, mainly maize, in .ood-prone areas such as the coastalsavannahs and swamps. This agricultural technique almost disappeared afterthe European conquest,but recently small groups,including Haitianmigrants and Saamaka (descendants of escaped African slaves), have built and cultivated similar raised .elds along thewestern French Guiana coast(Rostain 2012). The inhabitants of the Maillard village had, conversely, cultivated three .elds using slash-and-burn techniqueintheforested patches south of the settlement. The chance spatial associa­tion of ancient raised .elds and the remains of a modern settlement led to a false con­clusion about activity areas (see Supplemental Information4). 
DuringthestudyoftheMaillard village, some aspects were dif.cult to register and I missed some remains. The abandoned and ruined house 8 was covered by grass and some postholes were not visible, so only three postholes had been located during the topographical survey of the site. I did not .nd the posthole of the ceremonial polethat had been removedfromthe centralplaza. Thiswasa pity, becausethis pole is very important for the feasts and dances that wereorganized twiceaweekinPalikur villages (Institutode PesquisaeFormação en Educação Indígena and Museu Kuahí 2009). The central pole generally measures between 4 and 6 m, but can reach 7 m high. It is decorated with groovedmotifs, painted .gures, and feathersthat were spirit emblems. Onetofour poles,simple or equipped with arms, may be planted on the ceremonial plaza. During the Turé feast, strings tiedtothe beamsofthe polesymbolizea house roof.The centralplazais an essential space for the community,becausethe pole connectsspirits and humans through the efforts of the shaman. The ceremonial poleisthe passage takenbythe spirits to participate in the feast, when all the village members are present around the pole. The Turé is the most important feast for the Palikur,becauseitservestothankinvisiblespirits living in the Other World for the cure during shamanistic practices (Vidal 2009). Jean N. told me that the ceremonial pole was not the only element missing fromthe centralplaza.Former inhabitants had taken another large collective bench and four individual benches, those of Lucien, Jean, and Elie N., and one reserved for guests. 
Finally, I did not see the remains of the soccer .eld, which was under the grass at the southern edgeof thevillage.Idid not look for the goal postholes becausetheywere outside the settlement and hidden in the vegetation. 
Infact,Ifailedto detecttwoessential partsof Palikur community life: sports and ceremonies. I did not pay attention to the discreet—but present—traces of these domains of village life becauseI was notawareofthe practiceofthese activities. 
Over the course of the year following the initialstudyoftheMaillard village,Ireturnedto make regular observations to see what artifacts were taken by Amerindians when they came back to their ancient village(Figure8). The abandonment of various usable artifacts, such as sheet metal, toys, basketry, and pottery, had suggested that they had moved rather abruptly. Consequently,the easeofaccesstothesettlement and its proximity to the new village allowed them to return frequently to retrieve objectsthat couldbeputto useagain.The Amerindian people of the Guianas have been noted to possess an indifferenceto objectsandalackof attachment to material assets (Rivière 1984).Forinstance, during my visit with the captain, he took advan­tageofmy carto carry sheetsofmetaltothenew settlement. He noted the well-preserved posts, planning to return to take them later, and one of his children took the tricycle that had been left in house5(Figure7E).Thus,formerinhabitants tendedto visittheir abandoned settlementforthe purposeofreclaiming someoftheresourcesthat the area contains. 


Conclusion 
The objectiveofthe Maillard village projectwas to test the viability of interpretation used by archaeologists in the tropics. In the 1980s, no speci.c methodology had been developed in the rainforest, so inferences were made without a strict process.IntheMaillard village,thearchae­ological approach that was undertaken was the same as that used at precolumbian sites, such as diggingof testpits,recordingofthespatialdistri­butionoffeatures and artifacts, elaborationofa

What can we conclude from such a Poppe­rianexperiment?Theexperimental studyof the Maillard village allows us to evaluate the rele­vance of the intuitive analytical approach. The inferentialprocessusedfor archaeological inter­pretationled to crucial errors in the conclusions when confronted with theinformation fromthe ethnographicinterview.Four main mistakes can be recognized:

1) Social organization and occupation of the 
settlement were misidenti.ed (selection of 
the settlement location, identi.cation of 
un.nished houses, attribution of a house to 
the captain). 2) A wrong ethnic identi.cation was made 
(Palikur/Kali’na). 3) An activity area was erroneously identi.ed 
(raised .elds, not contemporaneous with the 
occupationofthe site). 4) Important features were missed (a house 
out of village bounds, the posthole of the 
ceremonial pole, the soccer .eld). 
Unfortunately, these are not insigni.cant errors, but essential misunderstandings that invalidated a large part of the proposed con­clusions drawn from the archaeological work. Mostof theseerrors resulted fromthe inferential process appliedtothe chainof successive inter­pretations.The logical conclusions providedby the archaeological study had to be signi.cantly reassessedin lightoftheethnographicalrevela­tions.The vulnerability of theintuitive analytic approach suggests that it should be critically examined beforeitisusedfor theinterpretation of archaeological data. 
Conversely, ethnographic data were not devoid of mistakes either, because the situation was described through thedistorted .lterofthe subjectivity of the witness, not to mention the limits to the accuracy of his memory. In the Maillard village,the captaingaveevasiveorinex­act answers on thereasons forthe abandonment of the settlement and the “deconsecration” of the collectiveAmazonian bench. Theinterviewer must keep in mind that interlocutors are in.u­enced by cultural rules and interdictions. This problem has been extensively explored by the Tucson Garbage Project conducted by William Rathje (Rathje and Murphy 1992; Rathje and Ritenbaugh 1984). 
This ethnoarchaeological experiment also provided successful guesses and positive conclusions. Reconstructions of house plans on the basis of the posthole distribution were correct,eveniftwoof thesebuildings werenever .nished.In these cases,close observationofthe data couldhave helpedavoid misinterpretations, suchasamore careful recordingofthepresence or absence of associated middens. The small size of the settlement and the organization of domestic space were correctly interpreted as belonging to a small-scale, egalitarian society of low-level food producers. The plaza was correctly interpretedasanimportant social and ritual space based on its centrallocation and the presence of two ceremonial benches. Perhaps one of the most interesting conclusions was that not all houses in a settlement are occupied simultaneously and permanently,something that archaeologiststend to forget. 
Thereasons forlocation and abandonmentof the village were misunderstood because of the intrusionofmoderncircumstancesand European presence. The municipal government marginal­ized thePalikur communityby settlingthemin theold coastalplain.Afewyearslater,theywere again pushedawaybythelandownerandhadto move to a new village. Such conditions have no correlationinthe prehistoric past. 
Inferences about demographics were correct. Despitedif.cultiesinevaluatingthe mobilityof the inhabitants, house abandonment or reoccu­pation, remoteness of structures, and so on, the evaluation ofnumber of residents was accurate. The observation that the inhabitants’ departure had been sudden was correct. The study of remainsandhousesmadeit possibletode.nethe chronology of abandonments and the analysis of themiddens helped createan accurate character­izationofthe former users. 
Nevertheless, the methodological approach of such excavations in contemporaneous set­tlements cannot be completely applied to the archaeological studyofaprecolumbian site.The high percentage of industrialized artifacts and European remains prevented a de.nite identi­.cation of the local culture. What was found was obviously not representative of a typical Amerindian assemblage. In Maillard village, metallic and plastic items replaced many lithic, bone, and wooden artifacts. In an Amerindian settlement without contact with the European world, the sample would have been fairly dif­ferent. Because of this strong external interfer­ence, crucial identi.ers ofAmerindian material culture were missing. The two pottery sherds were insuf.cient to de.ne the ethnic af.liation of the former inhabitants. But even a larger

Even setting aside the industrialized items,the comprehensivestudyof all Amerindian remains at the Maillard village showedajuxtapositionoftwo cultures, and this madeit dif.cultto de.ne theinhabitants’ iden­tity.Itiswell known that potteryis an important trade product in Amazonia and the Guianas. Kali’na frequentlyexchange theirproductswith other tribes.Ethnic communities consumingthe pottery of other groups is far from unusual (Gallayetal. 1996).Thiswork demonstrated that the combination of archaeology and ethnology gives a better image of past reality. It suggests that we shouldbeprudent in interpretations and hypotheses, especially in the tropical lowlands, wherearchaeological preservationisparticularly poor. 
In sum, the Maillard village experiment shows the risk of distortion and misinterpreta­tion during the process of making inferences based on archaeological data. Cultural differ­ences can lead to important mistakes in the archaeologist-ethnographer’s understanding of the people he interviews. Ethnoarchaeological experiments like the Maillard village study can help us to better understand formation pro­cessesofarchaeological depositsand distribution of features. This can help reduce the risk of misinterpretation of archaeological evidence in tropical environments. Such a study serves as an example ofthe complexity involved in inter­preting archaeological data from the excavation of precolumbian sites and theprudence that the researcher must showin drawinghis or her con­clusions.Here, as elsewhere, thearchaeological question“Who’sthere?”isnevereasytoanswer.
