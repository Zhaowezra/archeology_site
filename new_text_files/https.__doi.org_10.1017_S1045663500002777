EARLY OLMEC WRI TING: READING FORMAT AND READING ORDER 
David F. Mora-Marin 
This paper analyzes the reading format and reading order of the recently described Cascajal Block, an artifact with an Olmec-style inscription. The analysis, based not on the iconicity of the signs and their orientation, but solely on the formal and organizational characteristics of the text as a whole, and the patterns <{repeated sign sequences, suggests that the text was written from left-to-right, bottom-to-top-if one assumes the orientation assigned to the block by Rodriguez Martinez et al. (2006). However, a simple 90-degree rotation of the block would render the text in left-to-right, top-to-bottom read­ingformat and order-the same as that of later Mesoamerican scripts. It is suggested that the San Andres roller stamp and the La Venta obsidian core, both of which exhibit a pictorial image and an accompanying text, allow for a determination of the relative orientation of text and image with respect to each other, and support the hypothesis for the reading format pro­posed here. Also, preliminary structural analysis of the text reveals several patterns that are possibly indicative of linguis­tic structuring, and steps for future work on decipherment are outlined. Finally, the findings are placed within a broader context of previous studies of Olmec writing. 
El presente artfculo constituye un analisis del formato y direcci6n de lectura del recien descubierto Bloque de Cascajal, un artefacto con una inscripci6n de estilo olmeca. El analisis se basa exclusivamente en los rasgos formates y composicionales de! texto en sl, ademas de Los patrones de repetici6n de secuencias de signos. y no en la presunta orientaci6n e iconicidad de Los signos, rasgos utilizados por Rodriguez Martinez et al. (2006). El analisis sugiere que el texto Jue escrito en columnas-y no en hileras horizontales-de izquierda a derecha, de arriba hacia abajo, una vez que el texto es reorientado noventa gra­dos a la derecha con respecto a la orientaci6n propuesta por dichos auto res. Los resultados concuerdan con las caracterlsti­cas de los sistemas de escritura mas antiguos de Mesoamerica ya conocidos-zapoteca, epi-olmeca, maya. Tambien se sugiere que el sello cilfndrico de San Andres y el taladro de obsidiana de La Venta, ambos caracterizados por una imagen pict6rica acompofiada por un posible texto, permiten la tarea de determinar la orientaci6n relativa de texto e imagen, apoyando los resultados basados en el Bloque de Cascajal. Ademas, un analisis estructural preliminar def texto provee varios patrones que podrfan ser indicativos de una organizaci6n lingiifstica, y varios pasos para una futura labor de desciframiento son esbo:a­dos.

Recently, a group of scholars (Rodriguez Martinez et al. 2006) published a descrip­tion and analysis of a unique document for 
the study of prehispanic history, the Cascajal Block (Figure 1 ), named after the archaeological site in Veracruz, Mexico, where it was recovered. The dis­covery represents a potential flashflood of insights and discoveries for many years to come, not unlike that made possible by the discovery of La Mojarra Stela 1 (Winfield Capitaine 1988), which has led to significant progress in the decipherment of the Isthmian or Epi-Olmec script (Justeson and Kauf­man 1993, 1997; Kaufman and Justeson 2001, 2004), and facilitated the interpretation of themat­ically related pictorial art (Guernsey Kappelman 1997). The goal of the present paper is to contribute to the investigation of this newly discovered doc­ument with an assessment of its reading format and reading order, as well as a preliminary structural analysis of portions of the text necessary to make inferences about the reading format and reading order. In addition, after the analysis is conducted and the results presented, a discussion of its impli­cations in light of previous research on Olmec writ­ing, including the description of the San Andres Stamp (Pohl et al. 2002), is provided.

The Discovery and Its Context 
Olmec scholarship began with the archaeological investigations by Matthew Stirling (1940, 1943) and the art historical investigations by Miguel Covarrubias (1942, 1957). The original archaeo­logical discoveries took place at the site of La Venta and San Lorenzo in Veracruz, Mexico, not far from the site of Cascajal, an area nowadays referred to as the southern Gulf lowlands. However, "Olmec" sites, defined as such stylistically, are known from a much broader area, including Central Mexico, Guerrero, and the Pacific coast of Chiapas and 
Guatemala. The stylistic unity evident throughout these areas has led to much debate about the eth­nolinguistic nature of the "Olmec" and about the origin of Olmec civilization (e.g., Clark 1990). Debate continues, and in fact, a series of recent stud­ies of pottery exchange (Blomster 2002; Blomster et al. 2005; Neff et al. 2006) could support previ­ous suggestions that the Olmec style, and the polit­ical ideology it expressed, were diffused from the Southern Gulf lowlands region outward, although differing views exist (Diehl and Coe 1995; Flan­nery and Marcus 2000; Grove 1989, 1993, 1997). Until recently the evidence for hieroglyphic

writing, one of the most salient of all Mesoameri­can traits (Kirchhoff 1952), has been rather limited: did the Olmecs invent writing and then spread it throughout Mesoamerica along with other cultural products and ideas, or was writing the result of multiregional developments, with relatively little mutual influences? The Cascajal discovery sug­gests that Olmec writing did exist, as claimed by a variety of authors for the past five decades (Gay 1973; Kelley 1966; Meluzin 1987, 1995; Pohl et al. 2002), and possibly much earlier than writing elsewhere in Mesoamerica, as Rodriguez Martinez et al. (2006) argue. However, the dating of the Cas­
cajal block, placed at ca. 900 B.C. by Rodriguez Martinez et al. (2006), must be regarded as tenta­tive, given reservations expressed by David Grove and John Clark (Lawler 2006: 1551). These reser­vations highlight the circumstantial association of the block to other remains, and the vicinity to the site of San Lorenzo. Such reservations are valid, pending future archaeologically contextualized findings of similar inscriptions. 
Methodological Notes and Assumptions 
The goals of this paper are primarily methodolog­ical ones. The first is to test to what extent it is pos­sible to study the reading format and reading order of the Cascajal text without simply assuming a pat­tern of left-to-right, top-to-bottom columns and rows typical of several Mesoamerican scripts: is there evidence internal to the text itself-assuming for now that it is analyzable as a coherent whole­that would allow one to make such a determina­tion? And the second goal is to attempt a structural analysis of sign sequences in order to assess whether the text is internally consistent in a way that could possibly suggest linguistic structure. This paper does not have decipherment as one of its goals. Nor does it assume that writing can only be a representation of a natural (spoken or signed) lan­guage. Writing can be of a semasiographic or glot­tographic type, the former defined as the use of graphic conventions to represent specific ideas through nonlinguistic organizational principles, and the latter as the use of graphic conventions to rep­resent specific ideas through linguistic organiza­tional principles (Haas 1976). Mesoamerican scripts developed both principles (Boone 1994), and thus it cannot be assumed a priori that evidence of internal structure is the same as evidence of lin­guistic structure. In fact, Rodriguez Martinez et al. (2006: 1612) suggest that the text meets the "crite­ria" for writing, and in doing so they implicitly assume a definition of writing as a representation of spoken language: "The text deploys: (1) a sig­nary of about 28 distinct elements, each an autonomous, codified glyphic entity, (2) a few in repeated, short, isolable sequences within larger groupings, (3) a pattern of linear sequencing of variable length, with ( 4) a consistent reading order. As products of a writing system, the sequences would by definition reflect patterns of language, with the probable presence of syntax and language­dependent word order." 

Nevertheless, to test whether a writing system represents a spoken language it is necessary to first "try it out" as a representation of a specific lan­guage, in order to determine whether it matches the grammatical structure-phonology, morphology, syntax-of such language. It is simply too soon to make such an assertion, particularly because the cri­teria mentioned by those authors, even when con­sidered together, are not unique to glottographic scripts. Nevertheless, it is a necessary method­ological step toward decipherment to make a lin­guistic assumption as a basis for hypothesis-testing. With this in mind, Campbell and Kaufman (1976) have made a very strong argument in favor of some form of Mije-Sokean as the language of the Olmecs, and thus, Mije-Sokean should be the first hypothesis to be tested in this regard. But for now, the first step is simply to examine the signary defined by Rodriguez Martinez et al. (2006) more closely. 
Analysis of Formal Characteristics 
The Signary 
The original description of the Cascajal Block was accompanied by a preliminary sign catalog that displayed the frequency of each sign attested (Rodriguez Martinez et al. 2006:Figure 5). Upon close inspection of the text and the sign catalog the present author considers it necessary to make three revisions. Two signs, C(ascajal) S(ign) 10 and CS 20 (Figures 2a-b ), share a common component, a triangular, downward-pointing element. This is quite possibly a distinct sign, not just a graphic ele-

ment that is part of CS 10 and CS 20, given that the circular, cross-banded component of CS 10 can occur freely, as CS 26. Thus, for now, it is useful to split CS 10 and CS 20 into two components each, each of which can occur on its own or combined with signs that can occur on their own. The revised signary, organized according to frequency of dis­tribution, the principle used by the scholars who first studied it, is seen in Figure 3. It is possible that future research may show that such revision is ulti­mately unnecessary, and that it erred on the side of over-splitting, but for now it is a reasonable mini­malist assumption, one that places the burden of analysis on demonstrating that CS 10 and CS 20 are in fact equivalent, a task that must be regarded as pending, for it was not carried out by Rodriguez Martinez et al. (2006), nor is it carried out here. Nevertheless, it is certainly worth noting, as a ref­eree of this paper has done, that "other signs [in this text] [appear to be] separated from one another and not glued together." This is a point well taken, but it is simply indicative of a lumping approach, and therefore, one that assumes too much-rather than too little, as my splitting approach does-and is not clearly better from a methodological stand­point. 
Reading Format and Reading Direction 
Rodriguez et al. (2006: 1614) state: "Text orienta­tion is clear. Olmec imagery consistently displays vegetal icons, which sprout to the top. The appear­ance of such signs in the text demonstrates that the inscription is horizontal. This orientation is further supported by the disposition of 'sky-band' elements much like those on Olmec thrones and later regional iconography." This statement justifies the enumer­ation of the signs in the text, starting with #1 and ending with #62, from what those authors consider the top-most left comer of the block, as in Figure 
4. In their illustration they hypothesize about the text orientation, reading format (rows), and read­ing order (top-to-bottom, left-to-right). 
Yet iconically motivated grapheme orientation is not always a reliable guide to the orientation of the text. In Epi-Olmec writing some signs are ori­ented horizontally, even when their actual pictor­ial orientation was vertical (e.g., MS 81 and iconographically related signs). Similarly, in Mayan writing some signs could be oriented "standing up" or "on their side," depending solely on the arrangement of the sign in question with respect to other signs in the same glyph block­the organizational unit of representation in the script. I agree that all or most of the signs in the Cascajal Block text are consistently oriented with their upward end in the same direction, regardless of whether they were meant to be read "standing up" or not. Skidmore (2006:4 ), in fact, has also dis­cussed the reading format of the text, stating the following: "The direction of the reading order, and even the orientation of the text, is not entirely cer­tain. With regard to the latter point, a horizontal ori­entation of the block [see Figure 6c of this paper] would have the advantage of creating a roughly columnar layout, in the manner of more than one subsequent Mesoamerican writing system. And the apparent 'insect' [seeFigure4ofthis paper], which appears at the beginning (or the end) of a number of the sequences, would be in a more naturalistic position."

Skidmore, however, chose to accept the crite­rion of the orientation of the vegetal motifs in the text as indicators of the reading format of the text, following Rodriguez Martinez et al. (2006). I think it is worth pursuing the hypothesis that a different reading format is possible. Hence, the question that Iask here is whether text orientation could be deter­mined by other lines of evidence-such as the orga­niza ti on of the text itself, or possibly the relationship between other known texts and any accompanying pictorial images-rather than on the iconicity of signs. 
Before proceeding, it is useful to address another matter: the scholars in question do not discuss their method for determining the rows (rather than columns, given their assumption of a horizontal organization). They in fact state the following of their study (Rodriguez Martinez et al. 2006: 1612): "Yet, there is no strong evidence of overall organi­zation. The sequences appear to be conceived as independent units of information, although to judge from shared details of carving they were recorded by the same hand." 
Here I agree with their choice of selection of rows or columns; the term "line" is perhaps more neutral, and thus I use it whenever it is appropriate to express neutrality. However, it is necessary to provide some means of testing and justifying such

an assessment. A principle that works sufficiently well to this end is the height of the signs in each line. Indeed, within each line it seems that the scribe attempted to maintain a certain average height for the signs in general, and this height varied slightly from line to line. In two of the lines, those labeled in Figure 4 as including signs 9-14 and 35-39, it is apparently not just height but overall scale (height and width) that clarifies which signs belong in each line. 
Having established this, it is possible to return now to the question of reading format and reading order more generally. There are, in fact, clues to the text orientation problem that do not relate to sign iconicity. The first clue lies in assessing where each line most likely started and ended. It is very common for a writer to start a line on the lateral or vertical margin of a medium (paper, tablet, wall, celt) and end before reaching the other margin, leaving a gap in the process, if that is where the sentence ended. Thus, the location of such gaps

would tell us, with significant confidence, where the writing began and where it ended. 
As seen in Figure 5, lines B and D must have started on the left side, or else it would be hard to explain the empty spaces present on the right side of the text (cf. gaps 1 and 2). At this point the ques­tion is whether the text begins on the bottom left comer, or the top left comer. To answer this ques­tion it is necessary to pay attention to all the empty spaces: 1, 2, 3, and 4. These gaps suggest that the text started at the bottom line A, with sign #50, then moving to the right all the way to sign #62, and then restarting on the next line up, line B, with sign #40, again from the left, moving to the right, ending with sign #49 and leaving behind a gap represented here as gap 1. Line C is uneven because the scribe attempted to fill in some of the empty space left at the end of the second line with the last signs of this line, namely, the signs at positions #37-39. Line D is even and ends leaving a significant empty space, gap 2. Line E, is again uneven as the scribe

attempted to fill in some of the empty space left at the end of the preceding line. The sixth line, F, par­allels the fifth one closely, generally showing the same uneveness. The seventh and final line, G, is generally even. Interestingly, a cumulative effect appears at work: after the second line, line B, the third line became uneven when the scribe tried to partly fill in some of the empty space left behind, and from then on each succeeding line preserved, for the most part, the uneven pattern begun by the third line, C. These two lines of evidence-the gaps left at the end of lines, and the pattern of increas­ing unevenness of lines-suggest a left-to-right, and a bottom-to-top reading order. The former is consistent with the results by the scholars cited above, while the latter is in direct opposition, and more importantly, it would seem to be in direct opposition with the early Mesoamerican top-to­bottom reading order. Nevertheless, below it is sug-

gested that the Cascajal Block text is in fact read in a top-to-bottom order if one allows for the text to be rotated 90 degrees to the right with respect to the orientation assumed by Rodriguez et al. (2006), a procedure that would make it consistent with the format of the text on the San Andres stamp and on an obsidian core from La Venta. Thus, the appear­ance of a bottom-to-top reading order is just that, an appearance, for the external evidence adduced below indicates that what Rodriguez et al. (2006) suggest to be the top of the block is actually the right side. 
Another question worth asking at this point is whether there is any evidence from the signs in the text, particularly from repeated sequences of signs, which would support one of these reading orders but not the other (i.e., top-to-bottom vs. bottom-to­top ). Again, it is necessary first to review what the authors of the original study state (Rodriguez
