A large part of the excavation results have already been published, but Bourget provides more information on procedures and contexts, especially the stratigraphy at Plaza 3A. Photographs are plentiful and the stellar drawings by Jorge Sachún areparticularly helpful.In brief, morethan75 adult male warriors were ritually killed inside Plaza 3A during Phase IV (A.D. 400–700). Older men— hypothesized to be ritual executioners—were buried with adolescent retainers in the contiguous Platform II alongside liturgical tools, including a wooden club soaked in human blood. The sacred precinct was built over an ancient cemetery and children were buried as dedicatory offerings beneath it. Data from stratigraphic deposits are interpreted as indicative of alternate events of killing during rainy and dry episodesrelatedtowaxing andwaningENSOevents. 
Bourget’sfertile mind andexpert graspofMoche iconography areonfulldisplayin hisanalysisofthe plants andanimals disturbed, attracted,orhelpedby ENSOevents.Beyond theidenti.cation ofdifferent faunal taxa depicted in Moche art, Bourget remarks that ENSO creates deleterious conditions triggering infectious disease, especially leishmaniasis. Illustra­tionsvividlybridgethephysicaleffectsofthe parasitic infections and their depictions. Although Bourget’s demonstrationisconvincing,itis unclearwhyMoche artisansandritualists wereapparentlyso obsessedwith ENSO.Perhapsby Moche times coastal populations had become so entangled in irrigation farming and maritime activities that political and spiritual leaders found it useful to build legitimacy around growing concerns about theeffectsofENSO. 
The last two chapters will perhaps be the most provocativeand stimulatingfor Mochescholars. Bour­get, in an attempt to connect his iconographic anal­ysis with a model of political history, reviews elite mortuarycontexts.HesuggeststhatifMoche rulers were associated with the killing of human captives, changes in political structures must have triggered concomitant shifts in ritual practices and their repre­sentations.Throughthedatingand (re)assignmentof decorated objects and elite burial contexts to differ­entstylistic phases, Bourgetproposes three “stages” corresponding to (A) Phase III (Early Moche, A.D. 250–450);(B) PhaseIV(MiddleMoche,A.D. 400– 700);and(C)PhaseV(Late Moche).DuringStageA, images relatedtoWrinkleFace, MountainSacri.ce, and the Coca Ceremony were dominant, while the Sacri.ce Ceremony, including theWarrior Narrative andthe Battle of Animated Objects, appeared during Stage B. For Bourget the widespread depiction of images relatedtothe Sacri.ce Ceremonyatteststothe unity of “Moche stateideology” duringStage B. The iconographyof StageC,meanwhile,appears limited to theBurialTheme. 
While Bourget’s book will undoubtedly become a staple of Moche literature, it ultimately leaves the questions of why ritual violence and why ritual combatsomewhat unanswered.For instance, changes in Moche iconography are interpreted as indicative of transformations in political structures and a con­comitant need to re.neideological discourses. Bour­get points out the changing popularity and inferred authorityofcocatakers,warriors, ritual killers, temple attendants, andother actorsinincreasingly complex ritual narrativesand violentpractices.Still, onewon­ders why warriors and their ritual killing were at all of political importance in Moche times. Indeed, it remains unclearhowMoche structuresofgovernance developedorhow an ideologyof violence and human sacri.ce becamesodeeply entangled with rulership. Was warriorhood institutionalized during periods of real armedcon.ict? Couldthe ritual combatsbeways to commemoratethese ancient times?Was thespread of Mochereligious ideology relatedtothe capacityof elitesto nurture emotionalresponsestotheperceived omnipresence of violent acts and ritual combats akin to real armed con.icts? How were governance and legitimacy linked to shifts in political economies on the north coast? Bourget valiantly leads the way and positions himself in the debates about the nature of Moche warfare and the origins of prisoners, but Andeanists might have to look beyond elite burials and visual arts to reach more de.nitive answers. In any case, Bourget has to be praised for a very insightfulandmost welcome additiontoMocheartand archaeology.

useofquartzcrystalsasnatural mirrors.The pervading themethroughout the bookis themetaphysical func­tionof mirrorsas re.ectivesurfacesdeployedin rituals to “see” other realities. Mineral mirrors were seer stonesratherthanlamps.Theymayhave served some cosmetic functions, but ethnographic and historical informationprivilegesthe esotericoverthe mundane, and the 15 scholars in this book largely follow suit. Most chapters contribute data on the distribution of stone mirrorsin timeand spacein theAmericas,but Classic period pyrite mirrors qua shamanic devices dominate discussion. Space precludes a full listing of insightsand de.cienciesinthis book,but mentionof afew will give a .avor of the book and its utility. 
Topical coverage ranges from modernexperiments in mirror making to the use of mirrors by modern Huichol Indians. The opening chapter by Emiliano Gallaga andthe summary chapterbyKarlTaube deal with the cultural signi.cance of mirrors in aggregate andtoa lesserextentwith technicalitiesofindividual mirrors as hard objects. Remarkably, there is not a single adequate photograph, drawing, or description of a complete mirror in the book. Exacerbating this incongruity between wondrous objects and images, University PressofColoradodowngraded allthe color photographs into murkyshadesof gray.Thisnadirin publishing quality, however, may be metaphorically appropriate for a book on this topic. Mesoamerican mirrors blurred reality, and this made scrying with them possible. In Mesoamerican lore, mortals should not seetoo clearly. 
Metal mirrors roughed out by percussion and polished by abrasion appeared in Middle America by 1600 B.C., making them slightly older than the inceptionofMesoamerican society itself. Theuseof mirrorsmayhavebeen integraltotheculturalpractices that gave rise to Mesoamerican culture and sustained it over three millennia, but the early evolution of mirror use is not considered in Manufactured Light. Rather,individualcontributions deal with synchronic topics rather than the long view. The focus is on pyrite, mosaicmirrors.These Classic-period mirrors of golden cast were composed of small, .at pieces of polished pyrite glued onto .at pieces of slate or .ne sandstone. Such mirrors were generally larger than the one-piece mirrors made by Olmecs in the Formativeeraandalso moreregularin shape. Circular mirrors werethe most popular formofpyrite mirrors. The polygon pyrite tesserae of these mirrors were custom .t with the skill of Inca masons, leaving no gaps between conjoining pieces.Because each tessera was unique, those of individual mirrors .t together in only oneway ontheir back plates.The composite surface of each assembled mirror was ground and polished to the same optical plane, probably as the .nal manufacturingstep(this has not beenveri.ed). Complete mirrors are wonders to behold, but few are found whole because pyrite decomposes into a yellowish powder in most archaeological contexts. 
Thisistheonly bookIknowofthatmovesbeyond conjectural treatments of mirror making to descrip­tions based on replication experiments and analyses of microscopic traces of manufacturing marks. The .rst three chapters outline nascent studies designed to discoverthe techniques, time, andskill requiredto makepyrite mosaicmirrors.I am not swayedby the speci.c answers but am heartened that experiments with lapidary technologies have begun at long last. Extrapolating from one trial in making a sandstone mirrorback and onepyrite mosaicpiece, Gallagaven­turesthatitmighthave taken110to 160workingdays tomakeapyrite mirrorwith20to30pyrite plaques. Once the best ways of working pyrite have been discovered, I expect future experiments to demon­strate that the labor needed is less than a .fth this estimate. 
Five chapters report on sites with evidence for the production and use of mirrors. Of particular interest aredata fromCancuén,Guatemala,thatindi­cate pyrite mirror pieces were produced in work­shops devotedtojadejewelry.BrigitteKovacevich argues that these workshops were not associated with elite residences. This leads to the interesting surmise that nonelite craftspersons made items that circulated among elites. The connections between the manufacture and consumption of stone mirrors remain to be worked out. Carrie Dennett and Marc Blainey address this issue for the southern frontier of Mesoamerica; they look at the distribution of Maya-likepyritemirrors andmirrorbacksinCentral America. After evaluating various explanations they conclude that mirrors were items of gift exchange among elites—but gifts that presupposed the use of these mirrors in front of audiences. This conclusion reminds one of Kent Flannery’s famous article on EarlyFormativeexchangeof small, iron-oremirrors (inBenson, ed., DumbartonOaksConference on the Olmec, 1968).His groundbreaking studyis nowhere mentioned. ThesoletreatmentofFormativemirrorsis Joseph Mountjoy’sstudyof artifacts fromthe Mascota region near Acapulco,Mexico.He describesexquisite pyriteand polished quartzmirrorsandjewelsfoundin cemeteriesdatingto 900–700 B.C.

Authors in Manufactured Light deal with the composite, assembled surfaces of mosaic mirrors as singular, shiny surfaces and ignore other salient properties, namely,geometryand number.Inhisstudy of thelarge mirror fromLas Bocas,Puebla(thought to date to about 1000 B.C.), Alexander Marshack (inAveni, ed., ArchaeoastronomyinPre-Columbian America, 1975) analyzed the number, shapes, and arrangementofpyrite piecesof themirror.He argued persuasivelythat the 354 tesseraethat oncecomprised this rectangular-shaped mirror represented a calendar countof12 lunar months.It wouldbe welltoanalyze Classic-period mirrors in as muchdetail. The possi­bility that mosaicmirrors had calendrical,geometric, or numerological signi.cance is not considered in this book. Rather, mirrors provided luminous surfaces for looking into otherrealms.Some mirrorseven spoke, andthe sensesof touchand smell wereinvolved with others. 
In his summation, Taube discusses Postclassic mosaic mirrors that were clearly laid out as cosmo­grams. Olivia Kindl documentsthatHuichol mirrors continue to be framed as cosmograms. Her study calls attention to framing devices, most of which do not preserve archaeologically. Some Maya .int eccentrics appear to be copies of wooden mirror frames, soI would not be surprisedif some mirrors hadbeen attachedtowoodenhandles rather thanworn as pectorals. I suspect that the earliest mirrors were viewed in cosmological terms. As depicted in Olmec art, mirrors were centering devices that surely marked their wearers as central persons. These observations only scratch the surface of ManufacturedLight.The book merits careful perusal by those interested in Mesoamerican cultures, andsome chapters deserveto be read twice.

There remains much to be written about the history of Peruvian archaeology, despite the existence of accounts focused on prominent individuals such as MaxUhleand JulioC.Tello.Notably lackingtodate hasbeenanoverviewplacing researchinthecontext of the social, political, and economic changes that wereoccurring concurrently bothinsideand outside Peru.Tantaleán hasprovidedthe .rst such analytical review. 
The book is divided into 10 chapters. Chapter 1 brie.y traces the gradual emergence of archaeology from early postconquest times up until the very end of the nineteenth century. Chapter 2 introduces Uhle who, in 1896, conducted the .rst stratigraphic excavations in Peru. He continued his work with American sponsorship, was appointed by an enlight­ened government to head the archaeological section atanew NationalMuseumin 1906, anddevelopeda chronological scheme based on horizon styles. Also introducedisTello,whoexplored theruinsof Chavín de Huantar and established a museum of archaeology attheUniversityofSanMarcosin 1919.In chapter3 the reader learns that during the 1920s Peru forged a strong relationship with the United States while dealing with the rise of an indigenous movement in the southern highlands centered at Cuzco. Tello beganteachinganthropology at SanMarcosin 1923 and was named director of the National Museum of Archaeology in 1924. Based on his work at Chavín he theorized an Andean mother culture with highland and tropical forest origins that diffused to the coast. At the start of the 1930s the effects of the Great Depression resulted in a military coup. Tello was removed asdirectorof the NationalMuseumandwas replacedby thehistorian LuisE.Valcárcel.The latter created a new National Museum, was proactive in forginga nationalidentity, andfocused hisattention on thecleaningand reconstructionofIncasitesin and around Cuzco. Because of Valcárcel’s emphasis on tourismhisworkwasfully fundedbythegovernment, to the detriment of Tello’s scienti.c endeavors; this caused Tello to travel to the United States in 1936, resulting in the creation of the Institute of Andean Research. Chapter 4 focuses on Valcárcel and the indigenous movement that had intellectual roots in Cuzco.Valcárcel drew inspiration fromthe discovery oftheruinsof MachuPicchuand subsequently became enamored with Marxistideas.In 1927hewasbrie.y imprisonedfor publishingaworkinwhichhe called fora revolutiontocreateanidealized Inca state.
