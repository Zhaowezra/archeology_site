The Dawson seriation of Nasca ceramics has long been assumed to be an accurate marker of temporal changes in the pre­hispanic south coast of Peru. We test this assumption by directly dating a sample of sherds using Optically Stimulated Lumi­nescence ( OSL). Our results suggest that while some phases of the seriation are valid chronological markers, others appear to be the result of factors other than time. We discuss the implications of these results and call for additional studies of ceramics using luminescence dating. 
Los arque6logos han asumido que la seriaci6n de Dawson sobre la cerdmica Nasca es un marcador preciso que registra cambios temporales en la costa sur de! Peru prehispdnico. Comprobamos esta asunci6n usando Luminiscencia Opticamente Estimulada que fech6 una muestra de 50 tiestos de cerdmica provenientes de sitios ubicados en la region sur de Nasca. Nuestros resultados indican que algunas fases de la seriaci6n Dawson son marcadores vdlidos de cronolog{a, pero otros parecen ser el resultado de otros factores ademds def tiempo. En este trabajo discutimos las implicancias de estos resultados y sugerimos que son necesarios mas estudios de cerdmica usando fechados de luminiscencia. 
recise and accurate chronologies are central Pto archaeological studies in order to eval­uate social, political, and economic trans­formations in the past. In the Central Andes, where high-precision techniques such as den­drochronology are not yet applicable, archaeolo­gists have frequently turned to stylistic seriation for dating and chronology building (Rowe 1961). Although such seriations may work at a general level, it is often difficult to test them using ab­solute dating methods such as radiocarbon dating due to problems of association between dates and the materials on which seriations are constructed (e.g., charcoal vs. pottery). Moreover, while a se­riation may be supported through stratigraphic means and through radiocarbon dating at a given site, it is not always clear that a particular style ranges across the exact same temporal window over larger geographic areas or that different styles appear in the same temporal order in dif­ferent valleys or subregions. 
This limitation of seriation requires indepen­dent testing of chronologies, as has been recently noted elsewhere in the world (see, for example, Peeples and Schachner 2012; Pestle et al. 2013; Shennan and Wilkinson 2001; Smith et al. 2013). In this paper, we independently assess the tem­poral veracity of the most commonly used seri­ation on the south coast of Peru, the so-called Dawson Seriation. Specifically, we pose the ques­tion, "Is the Dawson Seriation about time?" To address this question, we employ optically stim­ulated luminescence (OSL) analysis to date indi­vidual sherds collected from surface survey across a broad area in the Southern Nasca Region (SNR). In the end, we compare our independent lumi­nescence dates against the stylistic assignments to evaluate ceramic chronology in the SNR. We
