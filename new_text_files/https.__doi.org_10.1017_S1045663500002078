This excellent edited collection results from a 2004 con­ference on Moche political organization held in Lima, Peru, jointly sponsored by Dumbarton Oaks, the Ponti­ficia Universidad Cat6lica de! Peru, and the Museo Arqueol6gico Rafael Larco Herrera. The volume con­tains 14 chapters in all, most of them written by experts who have each been engaged in active research on the Moche culture for at least the last 20 years and, in some cases, over 40 years. We have definitely come a long way since 1968 when I first learned about the Moche culture in Mike Moseley's South America class at Harvard. The breadth and depth of knowledge that has been gained through the multiple efforts of both native Peruvian and non-Peruvian archaeologists is quite staggering. 
Chapter 1 by Luis Jaime Castillo B. and Jeffrey Quil­ter is a very informative review of studies conducted on the Moche culture from the mid-sixteenth century into the twenty-first century. Of particular note are the con­tributions of Max Uhle, who incorporated the Moche cul­ture into his chronological framework for ancient Peru, and Rafael Larco Hoyle, who wrote extensively on the Moche culture in the mid-twentieth century. In particu­lar, it was Larco who devised the five-phase stirrup spout vessel chronology for Moche ceramics and who also for­mulated the model of the Moche culture as a centralized state centered in the Chicama-Moche Valley area of the north coast. The rest of Chapter I sets the stage for the remainder of the book, summarizing the tremendous amount of work done since Larco's time and how both his chronology and centralized state model have been called into question. 
Castillo and Quilter are particularly generous in their praise for Larco, calling him "a pioneer, a visionary, and a scholar of great depth and breadth" (p. 16). That char­acterization is not exactly the picture that I have of Larco and his contributions to Moche studies. It certainly was not my impression when I spoke with one of our elder workmen in the 1970s who, as a youth, worked on one of Larco's huaquero teams at the Moche Pyramids in the late 1920s. Nor was it the picture that I had when con­versing with Constante Larco, Rafael's brother, in 1972 when he talked about how Rafael would routinely send out dozens of huaqueros in the Chicama Valley to search for burials. According to Constante, Rafael got first choice among the pots found by those men and paid them accordingly. The men could do whatever they wanted with the remaining vessels. Rafael Larco was smart enough to follow Junius Bird's suggestion of seri­ating his Moche pottery collection and he had enough contextual information to produce his five-phase sequence that still holds true for the Chicama-Moche heartland. However, I cannot help thinking how much more useful his collections would be had he recorded burial association data similar to what is available for the Uhle collection at Berkeley. 
Chapter 2 by Elizabeth Benson compares multiple facets of both the Maya and Moche civilizations and makes a strong case to support a Maya kingdom model for the Moche culture. One puzzling aspect of this chap­ter is a short footnote saying that she does not accept the hypothesis that burials from Sipan Tombs 1 and 2 rep­resent supernatural beings in the Presentation Theme. This comment is surprising, given that the discovery of those tombs and the subsequent realization that scenes on Moche Pottery actually occurred in real life (i.e., the Presentation Theme) served as the initial impetus for almost all Moche investigations during the last 25 years. 
In Chapter 3, Christopher Donnan argues for a rigidly prescribed hierarchical priesthood that served as an over­arching institution to unify the Moche state. Each coastal valley had one or more centers where priests acted out roles in important rituals such as the Presentation Theme or Sacrifice Ceremony. His pioneering and continuing studies of Moche iconography using the thematic and narrative approaches to that art have guided two gener­ations ofMoche scholars to uncover the nature ofMoche art, religion and lifestyle. 
Chapter 4 by Izumi Shimada argues against using offi­cial art, like Moche fineware, as a way to reconstruct ancient cultures. As an example he cites Greek official Athenian pottery which, in his view, reflected more unity in Greek society than really existed. Instead, Shimada suggests that a more accurate Moche cultural recon­struction will be obtained through further technical and distributional studies of ceramics along with more set­tlement pattern and irrigation studies. 
In Chapter 5, Luis Jaime Castillo B. writes about the decentralized nature of the Jequetepeque Valley during most of the Moche period. Ceremonial centers like San Jose de Moro served as venues for community interac­tions and as places where elites participated in religious rites. In Chapter 6, Regulo Franco J., Cesar Galvez M., and Segundo Vasquez S. discuss the role of Huaca Cao Viejo (El Brujo) as the major ceremonial and pilgrim­age center in the Chicama Valley and as the head of a complex site hierarchy that spanned the entire valley. 
In Chapter 7, Santiago Uceda discusses his interpre­tation of the results of 20 years of fieldwork at the Moche Pyramids or Huacas de Moche site in the Moche Valley. He envisions two Moche periods. The first, ending around 600 CE, was characterized by theocratic rule with political power concentrated within a religious class asso-

ciated with Huaca de la Luna. Here, human sacrifices were regularly carried out as part of a ritualized com­munion between humans and gods. The second Moche period, from 600-850 CE, saw the rise of the urban elite at the site and the appearance of the unified Southern Moche territorial state that extended down to the Nepeiia Valley. Political rule became more secular, eventually giving rise to the later Chimu state. 
In Chapter 8, Jose Canziani A. makes some general comparisons and contrasts among various Moche sites ail along the north coast. In Chapter 9, Brian Billman suggests that the Moche rulers in the Moche Valley came to power from 300-700 CE through the expansion of the irrigation system on the north side of the valley. Farm­ers obtained farming rights to this newly irrigated land in exchange for labor or harvest taxes that were used to finance mound construction, craft production and pub­lic spectacles. 
Chapter 10 by Steve Bourget discusses the site of Huancaco in the Viru Valley in the context of a South­ern Moche state. On the basis of subtle pottery differ­ences (at least to this non-expert's eye), he believes the site was the center of a culture somewhat independent of the Moche culture that dominated the upper Viru Val­ley. In Chapter 11 Jean-Fran9ois Millaire describes Huaca Santa Clara as a Viru administrative center that established diplomatic relations with an intrusive Moche culture, not as a Moche center per se, similar to Bour­get's view of Huancaco. Both of these views support the idea that even the Southern Moche state may not have been especially unified. 
Chapter 12 by Claude Chapdelaine addresses the Moche occupation of the Santa Valley. Using both sur­vey and excavation data from several valley sites, Chapdelaine sees the Moche making initial incursions into the valley during Moche III times, perhaps dealing diplomatically with local Gallinazo rulers to gain a foothold. By Moche IV times, though, a full-blown inva­sion took place with thousands ofMoche colonists enter­ing the Santa Valley and incorporating it into an expansionist Southern Moche state. 

In Chapter 13, Krzysztof Makowski offers a differ­ent view of Moche society. He rejects the idea of a hier­archical priesthood in favor of political power being invested in warrior chiefs. He emphasizes the varied pres­ence of Moche, Gallinazo, and Vicus pottery at numer­ous Moche sites and claims that mortuary patterns reflect burials of related individuals within the same mortuary space. For him, lineage relations were very important for the establishment ofMoche culture in various areas along the north coast. 

The final chapter, written by mayanist William Fash, offers an outsider's perspective on Moche political orga­nization. He applauds the work that has been accom­plished up to this point, but cautions that much more work needs to be done. Fash sees a heterarchy model working as well for the Moche as it does for the Maya. He won­ders about the nature of rule in Moche society, whether it might have been more "theatre state" than theocratic in nature. In addition, he speculates on Moche warfare and postulates that there may have been more at stake than just ritual capture and sacrifice. 
In sum, as is the case for most edited volumes, there is no general consensus in this work about the nature of Moche political organization. With tremendous amounts of new data revealed over the last 25 years, it is obvious that the reconstruction of Moche society in general is much more complex than previously believed. This well­organized and well-illustrated volume presents substan­tial contributions to our understanding ofMoche political organization and should serve as a springboard for future research for the next 25 years.
