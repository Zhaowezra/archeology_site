In this paper we test the hypothesis that an intensification of maize production preceded the development of a regional Moche political economy in the Moche Valley of north coastal Peru during the Early Intermediate period (400 B.C.-A.D. 600). To do so we analyze stable isotopic signatures of 48 bone apatite and l 7 tooth enamel samples from human remains recovered from the site of Cerro Oreja, a large urban and ceremonial center in the Moche Valley. These remains date to the Guaiiape, Salinar, or Gallinazo phases and provide a diachronic picture of subsistence before the appearance of the South­ern Moche state. The most notable patterns identified in the study include a lack of significant chanf?e in <Y3Capar;ie values 
from the Guaiiape to Salinar phases ,followed by a significant enrichment in f/3Cap,u;u· values from the Salinar to Gallinazo phases. Several lines of evidence, including archaeological context, dental data, and comparative carbon stable isotope data from experimental animal studies and studies of archaeological human remains support the interpretation that the observed 13C enrichment in stable isotope values in the Gallinazo phase primarily reflects maize intensification. The sta­ble isotope data from Cerro Oreja thus suggest that a shift in subsistence toward a highly productive and storable crop may have served as an important precursor to state development during the Early Intermediate period in the Moche Valley. 
En este trabajo se prueba la hip6tesis de que una intensificaci6n de la producci6n de ma[z precedi6 al desarrollo de una econom(a polCtica regional moche en el Valle de Moche de la costa norte def Peru durante el perfodo Intermedio Temprano (400 a.C.-600 d.C.). Para ello se analizan firmas isot6picas estables de 48 muestras de apatita de huesos y 17 muestras de esmalte dental de los restos humanos recuperados en el sitio de Cerro Oreja, un gran centro urbano y ceremonial en el Valle de Moche. Estos restos datan de las epocas Guaiiape, Salinar o Gallinazo y proporcionan una vision diacr6nica de la sub­sistencia anterior a la aparici6n del estado moche de/ sur. Los patrones mas notables identificados en el estudio incluyen la fa/ta de cambios significativos en los valores de la 813Capai;ia entre las epocas Guaiiape y Salinar, seguida por un importante enriquecimiento de los valores de l'PCapaow entre las epocas Salinar y Gallinaw. Este enriquecimiento podrfa haber ocurrido de tres maneras: 1) los ocupantes de la epoca Gallinaw Cerro Oreja podrfan haber aumentado su producci6n de ma[z; 2)estos mismos podr[an haber intensificado el uso de los recursos marinas; o 3) que ellos podrfan haber intensificado el uso y la producci6n de mafz y los recursos marinas, respectivamente. Varias lfneas de evidencia apoyan la primera hip6tesis, incluyendo el contexto arqueol6gico, los datos dentales y los datos comparativos de is6topos de carbono de los estudios exper­imentales con animales y la investigaci6n de restos humanos arqueol6gicos que une los valores 813Capai;wsimilares a los obser­vados en la muestra de la epoca Gallinazo con una dieta a base de mafz. Los datos de is6topos estables de Cerro Oreja por lo tanto sugieren que un cambio en la subsistencia hacia un cultivo altamente productivo y almacenable puede haber servido como un importante precursor para el desarrollo del estado durante el periodo Intermedio Temprano en el Valle de Moche.

coast has received more attention or been the sub­ject of greater debate than the various Moche poli­ties (A.D. 300-800). Although diverse in form and historical development, Moche polities were char­acterized by the construction of massive ceremo­nial centers, intricate iconographic representations of an elite religious ideology, lavish elite burials, craft specialization , and social stratification (see Bawden 1995, 1996; Billman 2010; Pillsbury 2001; Quilter and Castillo 2010). 
Not surprisingly, questions related to the origins and structure of Moche political organizations, rit­ual practices, and elite ideology have engaged archaeologists working in this region since the work of Rafael Larco in the mid-twentieth century (Castillo 2010). Several prominent theories have been proposed to explain political change in this and other regions of Peru, including those invok­ing Wittfogel 's ( 1956, 1971) hydraulic hypothesis 
(e.g., Haas 1987; Moseley 1974; Stanish 1994), warfare (e.g., Billman 1996; Wilson 1981, 1988), and changes in agricultural production (e.g., Bill­man 2002, 2010; Burger and van der Merwe 1990; Hastorf and Johannessen 1993; Kellner and Schoeninger 2008; Quilter and Stocker 1983). Those invoking agricultural change have focused on shifts in maize production, because this grain can produce high yields in certain environments; it is easily stored for long periods; and it is known to have had a prominent role in prehistoric Andean social, political, and ceremonial life (e.g., Hastorf and Johannessen 1993 ; Johannessen and Hastorf 1995; Kellner and Schoeninger 2008). The pur­pose of this study is to test the hypothesis that maize intensification played a role in the origins of a regional Moche polity in the Moche Valley, com­monly referred to as the Southern Moche state.1 
In the 1990s, Billman set out to test Wittfogel's hydraulic hypothesis of state origins in the Moche Valley, using extensive survey data from the lower and middle valleys to chart the expansion of canal systems and the rise and fall of polities from 1800 
B.C. throughA.D. 600 (Billman 1996, 2002). The study examined changes in the organizational requirements of the construction and maintenance of irrigation from the start of small-scale irrigation in the middle valley circa 1800 B .C . to the con­struction of large-scale irrigation projects on the north side of the lower valley in the Middle Moche phase. Results of the study indicated that the man­agerial requirements of irrigation were relatively unimportant; rather, warfare, highland-coastal interaction, and political control of irrigation sys­tems created opportunities for leaders to form a highly centralized polity beginning around A.D. 300 (Billman 2002). 

This new polity (the Southern Moche state) was profoundly different from antecedent polities in that Moche rulers exercised significant economic, military, and ideological power over the population of the Moche Valley and beyond (Billman 2010). Moche leaders based at the Huacas de Moche were able to mobilize large quantities of labor on a reg­ular basis to construct massive monuments and irri­gation canals, and to fund craft production and elaborate public rituals. The extent of labor mobi­lization is demonstrated by the construction of Huaca de la Luna and Huaca de! Sol, which required the production of 180 million adobes over the course of perhaps 200 or 300 years (Hastings and Moseley 1975). 
Billman (2010) proposed that this regional polit­ical economy was based primarily on the extraction of tribute from farming households in exchange for access to land and water. Collection of tribute in the form of staples would have required fundamental changes in ithe domestic economy of farmers. In addition to expansion of irrigation, farmers would have had to make changes in the types and propor­tions of cultigens grown, reduce crop fallowing time, and increase yields through the use of manure or guano in order to accommodate the demands of the regional political economy. In tum, these eco­nomic shifts would have resulted in changing pat­terns of labor, gender roles, and diet (Gagnon 2006:265-266; Gagnon and Wiesen 2011) 
What role did maize play in this transformation of agricultural production? Maize played a key role in the political economy of a wide range of Andean polities, most notably the Inka empire (Bray 2009). Maize agriculture was (and still is) highly produc­tive in coastal valleys, and the grain is readily stor­able and can be transported efficiently over short to intermediate distances by llamas. Further, the provisioning of fiestas, religious festivals, and work parties with chicha de mafz (com beer) was con­sidered an obligation of the Inka and Chimu empires, and by inference other earlier polities (Gagnon 2006:253; Hastorf and Johannessen 1993; Hayashida 2009; Moore 1989; Ramirez 1996; Ube-

laker et al . 1995) . Consequently, ashiftto the inten­sive production of maize may have played an important role in the emergence of a regional Moche political economy based in the Moche Val­ley. Such a shift in maize production also might have led to changes in diet as farmers produced more maize in their fields and consumed more chicha at fiestas, religious gatherings, and work projects sponsored by rulers. 
Dental health data from individuals buried at the site of Cerro Oreja (VM-710:510), a large urban and ceremonial center in the Moche Valley, pro­vide evidence that a shift toward an increasingly cariogenic diet, such as maize would provide, occurred during the EIP (Gagnon 2006; Gagnon and Wiesen 2011). Dental caries, dental abscesses, and antemortem tooth loss have long been used as proxy measures of dietary change due to the well­documented relationship between dental disease and the consumption of refined carbohydrates (e.g., Cohen and Armelagos 1984; Hillson 1996; Kelley and Larsen 1991 ; Lambert 2000; Larsen 1997; Lukacs 1989; Turner 1979).At Cerro Oreja, a sig­nificant increase in the frequency of these dental indicators suggests that such a dietary shift occurred between the Salinar and Gallinazo phases (Gagnon 2006: 155-166). 
In this article we investigate this apparent dietary shift through the analysis of stable isotopes in human skeletal remains recovered from Cerro Oreja. The Cerro Oreja remains date to three sequential phases preceding the first construction episodes of Huaca de la Luna and Huaca de! Sol in the A.D. 300s. The stable isotope data provide us with direct evidence of diet and thus can be used to examine possible shifts in political economy that pre-date the Southern Moche state . 
Background 
Prehistory of the Moche Valley 
The primary focus of this article is the Salinar, Gal­linazo, and Early Moche phases of the EIP in the Moche Valley (Figure 1). A few Guafiape phase burials from the Initial period and Early horizon (1800-400 B .C.) are also included in the study and provide a glimpse into subsistence in this earlier period. The time frame represented by the human skeletal sample encompasses the period during

which irrigation agriculture became established in the valley (Billman 1996, 2002). 
During the Late Preceramic period (2700-1800 B .C.) a mixed economy based on marine resources and small-scale farming was established in the Moche Valley (Pozorski 1979, 1983). Marine resources exploited included mollusks, near-shore fish, and marine birds. Cultigens included gourds, cotton, squash, beans, peppers, peanuts, and sev­eral fruits, which were probably grown in small plots in sunken fields and on the floodplain of the river. 
By 1800 B.C. at the start of the Guafiape phase, most of the population moved from coastal settle­ments to the middle Moche Valley in the foothills of the Andes. People constructed small irrigation canals and presumably focused subsistence activ­ities on agriculture rather than fishing. By the end of the Guafiape phase over 4,000 ha of land was under irrigation (Billman 1996, 2002:380). In the Early Guafiape phase (1800-1300 B.C.), the first mounds were constructed in the valley. Mound con­struction peaked in the Middle Guafiape phase (l 300-800 B .C.) with the construction of mounds at Caballo Muerto and several intermediate and small mounds at other sites (Billman 1996, 2002; Chauchat et al. 2006; Pozorski and Pozorski 1979; 
T. Pozorski 1982) . Mound construction totaled more than 400,000 m2 (Billman 1996: 185, 2002). Cerro Oreja, the focus of this study, contains both Guafiape phase burials and unexcavated habita­tions (Billman 1996) and is located across the river from Caballo Muerto and adjacent to Huaca Huat­ape, an intermediate-sized Guafiape phase mound. The use and construction of mounds continued into the Late Guafiape phase (800--400 B.C.). 
At the start of the EIP in the Salinar phase ( 400-l B.C.), the political landscape of the Moche Valley changed dramatically (Billman 1999). All the Guafiape phase ceremonial centers, including the paramount site of Caballo Muerto, were aban­doned, settlement of the lower valley expanded dramatically, the first formal fortifications were constructed and the valley's population aggregated into eight discrete site clusters (Billman 1996, 1999). Cerro Oreja was one of the few Guafiape phase sites that continued to be occupied. During the Salinar phase the population of Cerro Oreja expanded, making it the second largest settlement in the valley; Cerro Arena was the largest during this time pe1iod. The eight site clusters likely were autonomous polities, although Cerro Arena was probably the dominant political power in the val­ley as a result of its demographic advantage over the other, smaller site clusters (Billman 1996, 1999; Brennan 1978, 1980a, 1980b; Mujica 1975). The political fragmentation of the valley, the abandon­ment of Guafiape phase centers, and the shifts in population were probably the result of the onset of armed conflict between the coastal and highland groups, and among polities of various coastal val­leys (Billman 1996, 1999, 2002). Irrigation in the Moche Valley expanded, increasing productive land to between 6,750 and 7 ,300 ha, a 73 percent increase over the preceding period (Billman 1996, 2002:382; Moseley and Deeds 1982). Although detailed data on food refuse are lacking for the Sali­nar phase, the expansion of irrigation suggests a transition from a mixed economic system anchored on the exploitation of marine protein and small­scale farming to a system of intensive agriculture (Billman 1996; Gagnon 2006:25). 


In the Gallinazo phase (A .D. 1-200) the Moc he Valley was unified under a single polity centered at Cerro Ore:ja (Billman 1996, 1999). Cerro Arena, which had a population between 5 ,000 and 10 ,000, was abandoned and the population of Cerro Oreja increased dramatically, making it the largest set­tlement in the valley. At its peak, perhaps more than 7 ,000 people lived at the site. Densely packed residences extended for 2 km along the lower slopes of Cerro Oreja. Up valley from Cerro Oreja, the population was concentrated at a series of fortified hilltop towns, which were linked visually. On the coast at Huanchaco, Pampa Cruz grew into a large fishing community, second in population only to Cerro Oreja (Billman 1996:239-242). 
Leaders of the Cerro Oreja polity apparently controlled more labor than the smaller Salinar phase polities of the Moche Valley. Investment in public architecture grew from 15,000 m3 in the Salinar phase to over 60,000 m3 in the Gallinazo phase (Billman 2002:390). At Cerro Oreja, a large adobe mound measuring 110 by 35 by 8.5 m clings to the steep slopes. above the residential area of the site. In order to create a level area to construct the mound, a cut-and-filll terrace, measuring 35 by 110 m, was carved out of the slopes. The masonry retaining walls for thils terrace were massive, standing over 6 m tall (Billlman 1996:241; Briscefio et al. 2006).

This new construction project demonstrates that leaders at Cerro Oreja could mobilize large groups for extended periods for construction projects. 
The concentration of the population and politi­cal power at Cerro Oreja meant the Cerro Oreja polity was well-positioned to control large tracts of highly productive, irrigated land. Due to the topography of the Moche Valley, the canal intakes that water most of the broad alluvial fan of the lower valley originate at or just above Cerro Oreja. If one controls these intakes, one controls over 80 percent of the cultivable land in the lower valley. While the irrigation system did not expand signif­icantly (Billman 2002:383), the choice of Cerro Oreja as the Gallinazo phase center is strong evi­dence that control of agricultural resources was essential to the power structure of the Cerro Oreja polity. The lack of major canal expansion may indi­cate that agricultural production stabilized during this phase, but it is equally plausible that food pro­duction was intensified through shifts in crops pro­duced (Gagnon 2006; Gagnon and Wiesen 2011), the use of guano or manure, decreases in the length off allowing, and the development of new and more productive varieties of cultigens, especially maize (see Bird and Bird 1980). 

By the end of the Early Moche phase (A.D. 200-300), a new political and ceremonial center was founded at Huacas de Moche (Bawden 1996; Billman 1996, 2010; Moseley 1975; Topic 1977, 1982; Uceda2001; Ucedaetal. 1994). CerroOreja continued to be occupied, although the population may have declined. At Huacas de Moc he the con­struction of Huaca de la Luna and Huaca del Sol was started (Uceda 2001; Uceda et al. 1994). The latter monument eventually became the largest adobe structure ever constructed in the New World (Hastings and Moseley 1975) . These new monu­ments were radically different in form and func­tion from antecedent monuments of the :Salinar and Gallinazo phases (Billman 1996, 2010). New forms of public rituals that involved human sacrifice and the burial of select individuals with unprecedented quantities of grave goods were performed at the monuments (Billman 2010; Bourget 1996, 2001; Uceda 2001; Verano 2000, 2001). Adj acent to Huaca de la Luna, craft specialists turned out vast quantities of ceramic goods for use in domestic and mortuary rituals (Bernier 2010; Uceda and Armas 1997, 1998). Beyond theHuacas deMoche, a major expansion and reorganization of settlement occurred in the valley with the construction oflarge numbers of new settlements and monumental cen­ters. Three massive canals were constructed on the north side of the Moche Valley, opening several thousand hectares of irrigated land (Billman 1996, 2002, 2010; Moseley and Deeds 1982). 

Collectively these transformations indicate a profound change in the relationships between rulers and the people of the valley (Billman 2010). Moche rulers were able to harness labor and collect large quantities of goods on a regular basis from com­moner households , which they used to finance a broad range of political activities, including mon­umental construction, public rituals, craft produc­tion, land reclamation, and possibly military actions. These transformations were manifestations of the emergence of a new regional political econ­omy in which Moche rulers exercised significant economic, military, and ideological power over the population of the Moche and adjacent valleys. 
While the Moche phase is not the primary focus of this research, the origins of the Moche polity at Huacas de Moche is. The Huacas de Moche polity (aka the Southern Moche state) was the culmina­tion of earlier political and economic developments in the Moche and adjacent valleys, though none of the preceding polities on the North Coast achieved its size or level of complexity. The dramatic expan­sion of the political economy in the Middle Moche phase required the mobilization of unprecedented quantities of food stuffs to support public works projects, craft specialists, elite families, and mas­sive public gatherings at Huaca de la Luna. These activities could not have been undertaken without an equally dramatic intensification of agricultural production. 
This paper examines whether or not shifts in diet related to the intensification of agricultural pro­duction in the Moche Valley occurred before the dramatic expansion of the political economy in the Middle Moche phase, or only after and in conse­quence of the rise of the Moche polity. To exam­ine this question we test the following hypotheses: 
H0 There was no significant change in the sub­
sistence regime in the Gallinaw phase. 
HAAn intensification of maize production in the 
Gallinaw phase preceded the development of 
a regional Moche polity in the Moche Valley.

These hypotheses are evaluated through the analysis of stable isotopes in human bones and teeth from the Cerro Oreja cemetery. 
Stable Isotopes 
Stable isotope analysis is a well-established tool for reconstructing diet in archaeological contexts (e.g., Katzenberg 1989; Kellner and Schoeninger 2008; Larsen et al. 1992; Tykot 2006; Vogel and van der Merwe 1977; Walker and DeNiro 1986). Stable carbon isotopes from preserved bone collagen were first used in paleodiet studies to indicate the pres­ence of C4 plants such as maize in the diet of peo­ple living in temperate regions (van der Merwe and Vogel 1978; Vogel and van der Merwe 1977). In North America, where the adoption and intensifi­cation of maize agriculture is the most significant economic transition to occur in most regions pre­historically, stable carbon isotope analysis has been used extensively to examine the timing and tempo of this transition (e.g., Buikstra and Milner 1991; Katzenberg et al. 1995; Schurr and Redmond 1991; van der Merwe and Vogel 1978; Vogel and van der Merwe 1977). Stable isotopes of nitrogen are often used in conjunction with stable carbon isotopes to provide information on trophic level, as well as the use of marine foods and certain plant food groups in the diet (e.g., Katzenberg 1989; Price etal. 1985; Sealy et al. 1987; Walker and DeNiro 1986). In South America, these dietary tracers have been used to detect the introduction of maize into the diet and to assess the importance of marine resources (e.g., Burger and van der Merwe 1990; Hastorf 1985; Hastorf and DeNiro 1985; Sandness 1992; Tykot and Staller 2002). 
Carbon atoms from ingested foods are stored in two sites in the human skeleton: bone collagen and carbonate. Bone collagen is a protein and, while many of the amino acids in collagen are non-essen­tial (i.e., can be synthesized within the body), con­trolled feeding experiments demonstrate that collagen nonetheless reflects the protein portion of the diet to a greater degree than it reflects the total diet (Ambrose and Norr 1993; Tieszen and Fagre 1993). Carbonate is a component of hydroxyap­atite, the mineral portion of bone and tooth enamel. Carbonate from bone mineral is an attractive source for stable carbon isotope measurements in regions where bone preservation is poor because collagen may be too degraded to yield reliable results (Krig­baum 2003; van der Merwe et al. 1993). Krueger and Sullivan (1984) first suggested that carbonate would better reflect the whole diet, and this was supported by controlled feeding experiments such as those cited above. Subsequently a number of paleodiet studies have made use of both sources of carbon (e.g., Harrison and Katzenberg 2003; Kell­ner and Schoeninger 2007; Tykot and Staller 2002; Ubelaker et al. 1995). 
Both collagen and bone apatite are subject to turnover as a result of bone maintenance and repair, whereas tooth enamel is not. For this reason, the isotopic signatures of bone collagen and apatite reflect dietary averages over the last 10 to 20+ years of a person's life (Hedges et al. 2007), whereas tooth enamel provides a measure of diet during the years of enamel formation (Eerkens et al. 2011; Wright and Schwarcz 1998). 
Controlled feeding studies of rats and mice (Ambrose and Norr 1993; Tieszen and Fagre 1993) indicate that collagen is enriched in the heavier iso­tope of carbon (13C) relative to the diet by approx­imately 5%o, although this number may vary depending on the specific diet and on the size of the animal (Table 1). Experimental studies further sug­gest that the o13C value of carbonate in the apatite of bone mineral (hereafter referred to as o13Capatite) better reflects the o 13C of bulk carbon in the diet, but with a greater enrichment relative to whole diet on the order of about 9%o in rodent models. How­ever, both of these numbers can vary and neither has been experimentally determined in humans. Research on archaeological remains suggests that o13Capatite enrichment in humans may be more on the order of 12%0 (Harrison and Katzenberg 2003; Tykot et al. 2009), the figure used in this study to estimate o13Cctiet from o13Capatite values. All terres­trial plants and the animals that consume them ini­tially obtain their carbon from atmospheric C02. Due to deforestation and the widespread burning of fossil fuels, which are depleted in the heavier iso­tope of carbon, the o13C of atmospheric C02 has been decreasing and is now approximately l .5%0 lower than it was prior to the industrial revolution (Boutton 1991). This number must be therefore sub­tracted from o13C values derived from prehistoric remains when making comparisons with values obtained from modem samples. 
The difference between o13Ccollagen and o13Capatite values in a sample can provide important

cane et al. 2006; Hastorf and Johannessen 1993; Kellner and Schoeninger 2008; Knudson et al. 2007; Sandness 1992; Slovak and Paytan 2011; Tomczak 2003; Tykot 2006; Tykot et al. 2008). A number of these studies have used stable isotopes to examine the role of maize in the structuring, function and/or evolution of political economies. In one of the earliest, Burger and van der Merwe (1990) used stable carbon isotopes from human bone collagen to investigate the role of maize agri­culture in the origins of the Chavfn civilization in the central Andean region (ca. 850 B .C .) . Contrary to their expectations, they found only a slight change in maize use during the growth and efflo­rescence of this civilization. Maize intensification does appear to have played a role in the develop­ment of social hierarchy in the northern highlands of Ecuador, ca. A.D. 100-450 (Ubelaker et al. 1995), where high-status individuals were found to have consumed and controlled greater quanti­ties of maize in the form of chicha de ma{z. Impe­rial influence on food production was also identified isotopically by Hastorf and Johannessen ( 1993) in the Mon taro Valley of the central Andes, ca. A.D. 500-1500. Their stable isotope data indi­cate that maize consumption increased from 40 to 60 percent of the diet after the Inka conquest, when chicha de ma{z was appropriated as a state food to manage labor and build political ties. Kellner and Schoeninger (2008) tested a similar hypothesis in the Nasca region of southern Peru for the period 
A.D. 1-1000, but in this case found no evidence that the Wari polity intensified maize production for imperial needs. 
Two studies of particular relevance to this inves­tigation used stable carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios from bone collagen and apatite to explore diet and socioeconomic relationships within and among communities in coastal Peru (Slovak and Paytan 2011; Tomczak 2003). At Anc6n on the central coast, Slovak and Paytan (2011) used this approach to clarify the nature of dietary practices during the Middle Horizon (AD. 550-1000) and to assess how these may have changed due to Wari imper­ial influence. On the south coast, Tomczak (2003) explored dietary variation among Late Intermedi­ate (A.D. 1000-1450) Chiribaya peoples of the Osmore Valley with respect to two models of resource use in order to address questions about the regional economy and political structure of the Chiribaya culture. These studies are particularly useful for this analysis because they provide very refined stable isotope models of maize use in coastal communities of Peru and they demonstrate the power of stable isotopes to reveal dietary prac­tices not otherwise evident in the archaeological record. These studies provide a highly nuanced comparative framework for interpreting stable iso­tope results from Cerro Oreja. 

Materials and Methods 
Cerro Oreja was first investigated through limited test excavatiion and surface mapping by members of the Chan Chan-Moche Valley Project (Mose­ley and Deeds 1982). In 1994 and 1995, Jose Carcelen directed salvage excavations at Cerro Oreja for the Instituto Nacional de Cultura-La Libertad in order to mitigate the effects of the con­struction of the Chavimochic Canal. Although much of the site was outside the area of impact, most of a large cemetery was excavated (Carcelen 1995) and represents one of the largest, unlooted burial samples in Peru. Jestis Briceno and Brian Billman (Briceno et al. 2006) followed this work with comprehensive total station mapping of all visible architecture and systematic surface of col­lection of two-thirds of the site. 
An inventory of burials and grave offerings indi­cates that the 909 burials from this cemetery date from the Iniitial period through the Early Moche phase of the EIP (Carcelen 1995:114-1462), although the cemetery may not have been in con­tinuous use over these years. Most (n = 816) of the burials date to the Gallinazo phase, but the sample also includes seven Guanape, 78 Salinar, six Early Moche and two possible Chimu burials (Table 2). 
The cemetery has a complex depositional his­tory (Carcellen 1995:18-20, 32-38). During the Guafiape and Salinar phases, and early in the Gal­linazo phase, the deceased were placed in subter­ranean graves, sometimes accompanied by ceramic grave goods .. During the Gallinazo phase, the ceme­tery was covered by aeolian deposits. On top of this new surface a series of masonry chambers were constructed, in which people were buried. Later, these mortuary structures were filled and the ceme­tery was again capped. Late in the Gallinazo phase people were again buried in subterranean pits exca­vated into this new surface.

The dating of graves by Carcelen (1995:34-36) was based primarily on stratigraphy and the inclu­sion of ceramic vessels identified as Cupisniqiue (Guaiiape), Salinar, Recuay, Castillo, Gallinazo Negative, or Moche I. Using site stratigraphy Gal­linazo phase interments were further divided into three sub-phases termed from earliest to most recent: Pre-Structural -interments predating the first cap­ping of the cemetery; Structural-interments within mortuary structures; and Post-Structural­interments postdating the second capping. In addi­tion to the changes in grave type seen during this time, Gallinazo phase mortuary practices involving the use of ceramics at Cerro Oreja appear to have varied greatly from those that characterized earlier and later phases (Billman 2010; Donnan and Mackey 1978; Millaire 2002; Tello et al. 2003). Of the graves dating to the Guaiiape and Salinar phases, I 00 percent and 71 percent respectively contained ceramic grave offerings (Table 2) . During the Gal­linazo phase this percentage fell to 21 percent. In all phases most vessels were plainware domestic forms (Carcelen 1995:132-156). 
Three radiocarbon dates obtained on human bone collagen from Cerro Oreja burials help to date the Cerro Oreja cemetery sample (Table 3). The cal­ibrated (2<T) range for the single Salinar sample is 
B.C. 
418-345, although a somewhat later date of 329-205 B.C. is indicated if the diet contained a hypothetical 10 percent marine protein. The cali­brated (2<T) ranges for two samples from the Struc­tural Gallinazo phase are B.C. 180-A.D. 73 and 

B.C. 
64-A.D. 93. When corrected for a hypothet­ical marine dietary component of 10 percent, the 2<Trangeforthese datesisB.C. 115-A.D.127 and 

B.C. 
45-A.D. 169 respectively. Given that the two 



Gallinazo samples derive from the middle sub­phase of the Gallinazo phase occupation at Cerro Oreja, either estimate produces bracketing dates for the Gallinazo occupation at Cerro Oreja of about 50 B.C.-A.D. 120. 
Of the total 909 burials excavated from Cerro Oreja's largest cemetery, 681 have been analyzed (Gagnon 2006) . As some graves contained the remains of more than one person, the total number of individuals thus far examined is 750. Preserva­tion of the Cerro Oreja skeletal collection ranged from good to poor, but much of it was poorly preserved-especially the Post-Structural Galli­nazo stratum of burials. As a result most skeletal elements required extensive reconstruction before basic data could be collected. Teeth were similarly affected, and in many cases had to be reconstructed from tooth enamel fragments. In order to maximize the data collected, those individuals characterized as having good to fair preservation were preferen­tially examined (Gagnon 2006:69-70). When choosing individuals for the stable isotopic analy­sis, efforts were made to sample all time periods and sections of the cemetery to provide broad rep­resentation within and across temporal samples (Figure 2). Both males and females, and individu­als of varying ages were included in the sample. However, as bone quality can affect stable isotopic analysis, the sampling strategy was skewed toward those individuals with the best preservation, and the final stable isotopic sample therefore does not equally represent all temporal phases. 
Bone collagen and carbonate from 48 human bone samples and 17 tooth enamel samples of 51 individuals were analyzed for stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes (Table 4). In order to prevent fur-

provide a general measure of diet during the period of permanent tooth crown formation: approxi­mately six months to 12 years (White and Folkens 2005:366) . The remains were analyzed in two phases. Phase I was conducted by M.Anne Katzen­berg at the University of Calgary using rib samples from 16 individuals. In phase II, 32 long bone sam­ples and 17 tooth enamel fragment samples were analyzed by Robert H. Tykot at the University of South Florida. 
Methods for collagen extraction differed slightly between the two institutions. Following Sealy (1986), phase I bone was cleaned in an ultrasonic cleaner for approximately 10 minutes, then dried. Dried samples were weighed then soaked in 1 per­cent hydrochloric acid (HCl). Acid was changed several times until bone mineral was removed. The remaining organic material was soaked in .125 M sodium hydroxide (NaOH) overnight. Samples were then rinsed to neutrality and centrifuged, and the remaining sample was lyopholized and weighed. In phase II, bone collagen was extracted by demineralizing whole bone using a slightly more concentrated 2 percent hydrochloric acid for 72 hours, dissolving base-soluble contaminants using .1 M sodium hydroxide (24 hours before and after demineralization), and separating residual lipids with a mixture of methanol, chloroform, and water for 24 hours. 
In phase I, collagen yields were found to be very low (between .8 and .2 percent) and eight samples yielded no collagen. Samples were analyzed for sta­ble isotopes of carbon and nitrogen on a Finnigan 
F -6.6 
MAT Delta + mass spectrometer interfaced with a Carlo Erba gas analyzer in the Isotope Science Lab­oratory, University of Calgary. Given the low col­lagen yields, there was insufficient sample to measure nitrogen and therefore no data on stable isotopes of nitrogen. Thus, there are no C/N data for evaluating the quality of the small amount of collagen that was recovered. Data on %C range from 17 percent to 4 percent, much lower than the expected 30-44 percent found in well-preserved bone . Collagen yields in the phase II study were similarly insufficient for stable isotope analysis. 

Since the stable carbon isotope data from col­lagen were severely limited and those obtained potentially affected by diagenesis, carbonate was isolated from bone mineral and tooth enamel. In phase I, approximately .5 grams of whole bone was ground in a mortar and pestle . Bone powder was treated with 2 percent sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) following the method of Lee-Thorp (1989). Afte:r five rinses, the samples were soaked in dilute acetic acid (JM). After two hours, sam­ples were rinsed under vacuum then freeze-dried. Samples were analyzed in Erlangen, Germany under the direction of Dr. Michael Joachimski. The carbonate powders were reacted with 100 percent phosphoric acid (density> 1.9) (Wachter and Hayes 1985) at 75°C using a Kiel III online carbonate preparation line connected to a ThermoFinnigan 252 mass spectrometer.
