brink of being ponderous. Data and ideas are often repeated in the text, although Lesure may well argue that this repetition was necessary in order to methodically develop his concepts and reach his final goal of illus­trating the laborious steps of archaeological data analy­sis and interpretation. There are a few small internal inconsistencies within the text: for instance Table 1.1 informs us that Cuadros and Jocotal Phases were from 1300 to I 000 B .C., but the beginning of Chapter 2 states that these phases were from 1100--850 B .C. These latter dates may be uncalibrated, but this distinction is not made clear in the text. The physical quality of the pub­lication is excellent-it is printed on high quality paper and the cover and binding are quite sturdy. 
Whether Lesure and his colleagues were ultimately successful in reconstructing Early Formative socioeco­nomic patterns is of course a matter for each reader to evaluate. They do a very good job in presenting their case, though not all readers may be convinced by all of their conclusions or reconstructions. This volume cer­tainly does succeed as a heuristic example of the detailed process of archaeological analysis, data testing, and the development of hypothetical socioeconomic reconstruc­tions. It is an excellent and valuable contribution to Early Formative and adaptive studies and will doubtless be a valuable source of information and ideas for many years.

More books should attempt what this book accomplishes. By assembling an adept roster of archaeologists, lin­guists, and ethnohistorians, the editors argue that ethnicity can be resharpened into a useful analytical tool. The book demonstrates the value of interdisciplinary research in Amazonia with results that deserve attention beyond the region. It also points to a distinctive aspect of the archaeological and historical record of the Amazon: the interplay between linguistic diversity, deep history, and material culture. The book contains an introduction, five chapters from archaeologists, six from linguists, five from ethnohistorians, and an afterword by the late Neil Whitehead. The chapters draw on data from throughout the Amazon Basin, although not every region is repre­sented. Several chapters take a large-scale, continental approach and, for the most part, relate their examples to larger frameworks of Amazonian language, identity, and history. Though South America has long been consid­ered the "least known continent," we have passed the 
point at which scholars can claim to need more time 
before they can synthesize their results. The past two 
decades of archaeological, linguistic, and anthropolog­
ical research have multiplied the amount of information 
available. This book is a promising sign for the archae­
ology of the Amazon, going beyond adding new infor­
mation to placing that information in new contexts. The 
book is notable for its cohesion and the feeling that the 
authors share a subject, if not the same point of view. 
Two of the archaeological analyses tum on recent debates about the role and importance of Arawak speak­ers in the Amazonian past. Speakers of Arawak languages were the first to greet Columbus in the West Indies; they were found from the Caribbean in the north to Bolivia in the south, and from the Andes in the west to the Atlantic Ocean in the east. A chapter by Neves provides a brief review of Central Amazonian archaeology and lays out theoretical questions that have been addressed by decades of research, while Heckenberger provides a similar ser­vice for the Southern Amazon. The question of whether the spatial pattern of Arawak speakers in the Amazon Basin corresponds to a historical record of the movement of groups along rivers and across the uplands, or instead to a long-distance trade network facilitated by a lingua 
franca, seems largely to have been resolved in favor of the latter. This issue informs a larger definition of eth­nicity that is well introduced by the editors. The quantity and quality of scholarship described here show that archaeologists in the Amazon have reached a point where the synthesis and comparison of information are essen­tial. Plenty of blank spots remain on the map, but these lacunae do not excuse a lack of reflection. 
For example, DeBoer offers a characteristically shrewd analysis of how archaeologists can mismanage differences in scale when they tum from the minutiae of pots and soils to trends over centuries and across river valleys. He uses statistics judiciously, without forcing them to carry too much meaning, and raises questions about how ceramic assemblages from eastern Peru con­nect to Panoan speakers and other groups, both the near­est neighbors and those farther away. Reanalyzing older ethnographic data using a similar approach, Deboer both generates a series of new questions about spatial and cul­tural relationships between groups of people and demon­strates a method for generating such questions. 
Turning to linguistics, few arguments against an essentialist interpretation of language and people are stronger than the appreciation of language diversity in the Amazon Basin: from the diversity of large language groups spread across the Basin to the clustering of lin­guistic isolates in Western Amazonia and along the east­ern slope of the Andes, and even to the level of linguistic variability within a single village or a single family. Only the interior of New Guinea rivals the Amazon Basin in terms of linguistic diversity. Basso's chapter connects the detailed study of ritual communication to ideas about

multilingual social networks, which underlie many archaeological models. Basso notes that archaeologists are concerned with ritual practice in public settings, but points out that individual control of discourse styles seem to be essential to political negotiations. This point is cru­cial; when speakers of different languages come together, all manner of other communication -including dress, body language, music, and gestures-are central rather than epiphenomena!. Archaeologists would be wise to incorporate these insights into their interpretations of rit­ual settings. 
With this book, anthropologists of Amazonia join other scholars, such as Proto In do-European researchers, who are connecting archaeological work to the study of historical linguistics. These studies combine archaeol­ogy's strengths in the reconstruction of deep history with new methods in historical linguistics, as well as provide improved data on chronological sequences of material culture and newly studied or re-studied languages. In addition to comparing word lists, linguistic studies now compare grammatical structures. Some linguists compare the grammars of geographically related languages and find similarities that are not revealed through the study of vocabulary. Sophisticated statistical analyses increas­ingly permit a more nuanced understanding of the rela­tionships between languages. 
The book's middle section puts to rest the idea that archaeologists should connect an aspect of material cul­ture to a language or language group, as though the lan­guage represents a distinct group of people or a population. This overall model identifies aspects of cul­ture (such as political organization and agricultural earth­works) not with Arawak speakers, but as part of a long-distance trade network that used a common lan­guage.Arawak-speaking groups in this model are thought to be associated with a system of long distance trade that spanned the continent and connected such groups (and presumably their neighbors with whom they traded) along the rivers of the Amazon Basin, spreading both ideas and material culture. 
Several of the ethnohistoric contributions are partic­ularly insightful. The research of Santos-Granero, rep­resented here in a chapter on captors and captives in linguistic context, multiplies the complexity of the lin­guistic and archaeological records. Using ethnohistoric sources, Santos-Granero shows how three societies were composed of a permanent captor class and a captive class, brought about through warfare and marked through different languages. In reference to the Arawak question, speakers may have been both the victims and the victors in such arrangements, again confounding any simple interpretation. Based on more than four decades of detailed ethnographic research, Whitten contributes a spirited defense oflocal, historical knowledge of Quichua speakers in the Amazon against what he describes as uni­versal, structuralist models that misappropriate this ethnographic record. This position is perhaps represen­tative of a larger tum in the field away from more expan­sive models and back toward the details of historically grounded case studies. A highlight from Hill's chapter is the maps representing geographic information produced during initiation rituals by Arawak-speaking Wauekenai in Venezuela. The journey described in the female initi­ation ritual crosses about 150 miles, while that of the male initiation ritual reaches the Atlantic Ocean, about 1500 miles away.Amazonian peoples had a broad geographic knowledge, a sense of history (or many senses of his­tory), and complex ways of integrating this knowledge into many aspects of their lives. Obviously, the use of this geographic knowledge intersects with gender con­struction and maintenance. 
In Amazonian studies, the link between the past and the present tends to be more important outside archaeo­logical circles than inside them. An important question about ethnicity for the public is the relationship between these new features of the archaeological record in the Amazon and the people who live there today. Dudley's chapter on ethnogenesis in Apolobamba, Bolivia, directly engages this question and the example should push archaeologists forward. The construction and recon­struction of ethnicity today offers lessons about the past, but also drives home to archaeologists how their results change the world in which they obtain them. 
The volume itself is very well produced and edited. The cover photograph of Brazilian geoglyphs is startling and effective, the figures are clear and understandable, and the text is well edited. The section of biographical information for each author is especially useful. The book would serve well in a graduate seminar or perhaps an advanced undergraduate class, although cost is a factor. 
The book succeeds by bringing scholars, widely sep­arated by discipline and geography, together around a single theme that interests both specialists and various archaeological publics. The book shows that a wide range of excellent scholarship is being carried out in the Ama­zon Basin, and these authors are contributing to increas­ingly nuanced and sophisticated analyses of what happened in the past and how that history structures the present. They also contribute to new thinking about rela­tionships between language, material culture, history, and the present. Amazonianists are not doomed to be importers and copiers of anthropological theory, but are here establishing their own workshops and becoming exporters of ideas. As an archaeologist, I favor this vol­ume because it brings together so much information that affects my interpretations of the Amazon Basin. Archae­ologists need all the help that they can get; I only hope that other specialists will find useful information herein. The long-distance exchange of information between lin­guists, ethnohistorians, and archaeologists promises to energize Amazonian studies for years to come.
