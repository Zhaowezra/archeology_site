Thisbookisaninterestingcontributiontocomparativelexicography, modern history, and translation studies.Focusing on the history and impact of Antonio deNebrijasfamousCastilianLatinVocabularioorDictionariumfirstpublishedin1495,theauthorfirsttracesthehistory of its multiple editions until 1610, documentingthemodificationsandadditionsthatNebrijahimselfandothereditorsmadeovertheyears.Next,twofascinatingchapters discuss the use of the Dictionarium as lexical template for the edition of translation dictionaries ofother languages in Europe,theAmericas,andAsia.TheauthordiscussesseveralcasestudiesincludingSpanishEnglish, SpanishFrench, TuscanSpanish, NahuatlSpanish,MixtecSpanish,PurhpechaSpanish,YucatecMayaSpanish,QuechuaSpanish,andTagalogSpanishdictionaries.Mostofthesevolumesincludedalsopartialorfullreversedictionaries.InthesepublicationsNebrijasoriginal lexical entries were often expanded to adapt totherichnessandlexicaldetailofthetargetlanguage.Forexample,Alonso de Molinas NahuatlCastilian vocabulary (1571) duly included Nebrijas original entryRelumbrarorreluzir (toshineortoglitter)butanumber ofvariations were addedtocaptureNahuatl categorizationsofreflectedlight.Forexample,amongseveral,the following subentries translate Nahuatl words referencingspecificqualitiesofreflectedlightassociatedwithparticular objects and situations (pp. 96101):

The lexicaland structural incommensurabilityof thetwo languages required long descriptions of categoriesthat did not exist in Spanish as with the light reflectionfield above. The author discusses other cases, such asMolinas NahuatlSpanish vocabulario, in which neologisms were created to translate Nahuatl words that didnot have Spanish equivalents. For example, Molina putforthabaxador(onewhobringsthingsdown)totranslateNahuatltlatemohuiani,morphologicallyanagentive nominalizationoftemohuia(bringdown).SuchnominalderivationsfromverbsarenumerousinNahuatlgivenitsrichandregularderivationalmorphology.Incontrast,excessivefidelitytoNebrijasentriessometimesledlexicographers to unfortunate mistranslations or lexicalperiphrasesthatdidnotreflectcommonusageinthetargetlanguage.

Finally, in Chapter 4 the author discussesthe use of margins to draft manuscript trilingual dictionaries. For example, the margins and blank spaces ofpublished copies ofAlonso de Molinas Nahuatl vocabulario and Maturino Gilbertis Purpecha vocabulariowere annotated with Otomi translations of each entry.Thus, copies of Molinas and Gilbertis bilingual dictionaries turned into the physical medium in which newtrilingual dictionaries were composed.
Hamann adequately discusses the circulation andsocial life of translation dictionaries in early moderntimes. However, some discussion of the circulation ofother types of texts such as doctrines and descriptivegrammars would have helped to contextualize dictionariesasadiscoursegenre.Itisunclearfromtheauthorsdiscussion the extent to which dictionaries modified or

I thought twice before agreeing to review Beyond Collapsebecauseitsmainthemes,resilience,societaltransformation, revitalization, and sustainability, have beenpopular among archaeologists for the last decade. Alltoo often intellectual fashion produces old wine in newbottles.Thereisabitofsuchrepackaginginthisvolume,but overall I found it very engaging and informative.Nineofthe20chaptersaredevotedtoMesoamericaandthe Central Andes, so much will appeal to readers ofLatin American Antiquity. 
ThefirsttwochaptersbyRonaldFaulseitandJosephTainter lay out the rationale for the book: that collapseof complex societies has been overstudied to the greatneglect of processes of persistence and recovery, andbesidescollapsehasbecomeboringandpass.Collapseisunderstoodtobethefragmentationordisarticulationofaparticularpoliticalapparatus(p.5),althoughotherdefinitionsoccurthroughoutthebook.Faulseitbelievescurrentconcernwithresilienceandsustainabilityderivesin part from collective fears that our modern, industrialapparatus is in danger of going off the tracks. His introduction provides a summary of resilience literature andconcepts,whichhavedeeprootsingeneralsystemstheory (an odd omission is the work of David Clarke, whodecades ago introduced many of these ideas to archaeologists of a certain age).Tainters chapter is a fine historical overview of collapse, and it explores a richintellectualtraditioninanuancedandreflectivemanner.

Some authors heavily integratethese phases into their presentations of archaeologicaldata, while others pay only lip service to them.

I always respond well to comparative perspectives,and regional coverage is impressive. Old collapse warhorses aretrotted out,includingtheMaya(HogarthandAwe; Hutson et. al; R. Storey), Rome (G. Storey), theAmericanSouthwest(Sedig;Torvinenet.al),Mississippianpolities(EmersonandHedman;Meyers),andtheOlmec(Pool and Loughlin).And kudos to the Mayanist GylesIannone for a very sensible overview of SoutheastAsiaand theKhmer.The casestudiesfallintoseveral scales,some much larger and more complex than others. HanChina (Kidder et. al), Monte Alban (Feinman andNichols),Tula(Andersonetal.),andTiwanaku(Sharratt)were all expansive imperial or statelevel sociopoliticalformations.Others,suchastheMoche(ZoberandSutter)and Nazca (Conlee), were more regional in scope.AlsoincludedaresmallerbutintriguingpolitiesfromtheMississippi Delta (Rodning and Mehta) and the LakeOkeechobee Basin (Thompson). I had no idea of theimpressive architectural remains left behind by theseeffectivelynonagrariangroups.Conspicuouslymissingis SouthwestAsia, whose long Mesopotamian traditionprovides much grist for collapserecovery models.
Lantzas gives a good example of the reconstitutionof viable new social and political formations out of oldfragmentedonesfortheArgolidregionofGreece,arguing convincingly for continuity after the collapse of theBronzeAgepalacecenters.Suchnewformations,however, represent only one dimension of transformation,albeit one consistent with the political recovery centralto the definition of collapse given above. Resilience, atits most basic scale, surely refers to the survival andreproductive success of individuals, regardless of thenewsocial,political,andculturalcircumstancesinwhichthey live. Although there are general qualitative statementsaboutpopulationdynamicsinmanychapters,numericalestimatesofhowmanypeoplewereinvolvedin the precollapse systems and how many descendantsweathered the various transitions are spotty at best(exceptions are the chapters on China, the Olmec,Cahokia, and Tula). A reconstituted system that has 80percent of the precollapse population scale is very different than one that has 20 percent. And surely demographic scale affects the potential for resilience infundamentalways.FiftymillionHanChinesearealwaysgoing to reconstitute some kind of viable descendantsystem,butpolitieswithafewhundredtoafewthousandpeople might not have this capacity.
Readers not familiar with resilience theory will runacross many new terms, some felicitous and some not.Sometimes these are used with no definition, and onehastodigaroundtofindoutwhattheymean(aglossary
