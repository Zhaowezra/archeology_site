EATING EMPIRE IN THE ."[EQUETEPEQUE: 
A LOCAL VIEW OF CHIMU EXPANSION ON 
THE NORTH COAST OF PERU 
Robyn E. Cutright 
As the Chimu empire (ca. AD. 900-1470) expanded along the north coast of Peru, it employed a mix of direct and indirect 
strategies to administer conquered populations. Jn order to investigate the extent to which Chimu conquest reshaped daily 
life in the provinces, I explore evidence from Pedregal, a rural farming village in the Jequetepeque Valley. I use cuisine as 
a window onto daily life at Pedregal, in order to construct a "view from the kitchen" of Chimu expansion. Excavation data 
from Pedregal households indicate that production of agricultural staples such as corn and cotton intensified during the 
Chimu period, but that while the focus of household culinary practice shifted, the overall range of household activities 
remained the same. The Chimu seem to have been able to establish political control and intensify agricultural production 
in conquered provinces without a radical reorganization of rural domestic economies. These findings have implications not 
only for emerging models of Chimu imperial expansion, but also for our understanding of how household-level change and 
continuity are articulated with regional political and economic processes.

his article focuses on the local experience Tof the pre-Inka Chimu empire conquest. Specifically, I investigate the extent to which Chimu conquest and administration re­shaped rural life in the provinces. Did the Chimu reorganize daily life in conquered households, as has been documented in some Inka cases? If so, did households respond to conquest by altering some dimensions of daily practice while conserv­ing others? Or is this conquest better described as a reorientation of authority and allegiance at the upper levels of the sociopolitical hierarchy, with minimal effect on rural communities? In order to address these questions, I approach local rural life through the lens of daily culinary 
practice. Food production, preparation, and con­sumption constitute one realm of daily life where the cultural, political, and economic effects of conquest might be experienced in archaeologi­cally visible ways. Thus, every day activities such as eating and cooking can serve as a win­dow into the varied experiences of Chimu con­quest. I focus on the case of Pedregal, a rural agricultural village in the lower Jequetepeque Valley that was conquered by the Chimu during their first wave of expansion to the north, circa 
A.D. 1320. Before turning to the evidence from Pedregal, I first discuss the archaeology of cui­sine and imperial expansion, and provide a broad synthesis of classic and recent research on Chimu

expansion and administration of conquered provinces. 
An Archaeology of Cuisine 
Cuisine has recently emerged as a particularly useful construct through which to explore a broad range of sociocultural processes (e.g., Bray 2003; Dietler and Hayden 2001; Graff and Rodriguez­Alegrfa 2012; Gumerman 1997; Hayden and Vil­leneuve 2011; Mintz and DuBois 2002; Twiss 2007). Of particular relevance here, the study of cuisine can bring into focus household-based, gendered responses to overarching politico-eco­nomic settings (Hastorf 1991; Klarich 2010). 
Cuisine has often been conceptualized as rela­tively conservative and resistant to change (Crown 2000); even today, home cooking is a touchstone for nostalgia, tradition, and identity. Hastorf (2012:69) suggests that the daily habitus of cook­ing helped to transmit and maintain social cohe­sion, and may have been a powerful force behind long-term cultural continuity in the early Neolithic village of atalhOyiik. Lightfoot et al.'s (1998) investigation of daily culinary activities in colonial northern California reveals that ideals related to gender, cuisine, and the organization of domestic labor were reproduced in daily practice, and pro­vides evidence that these ideals helped buffer the impact of broader external change. 
Despite arguments for culinary conservatism, households articulate with regional cultural, po­litical, and economic dynamics through daily culi­nary practice. In some cases, household culinary activities become the basis for increasing urbanism and social complexity. For example, Ur and Colan­toni (2010) argue that decentralized local processes, including choices about how to pro­duce, prepare, and serve food, were at least as important as top-down elite control in intensifying agriculture and urbanism in northern Mesopotamia in the third millennium B.C. In this bottom-up view, households are articulated with wider social processes because such processes are an aggregate of local household decisions. 
But this is not the only way in which cuisine and wider sociopolitical dynamics are linked. Processes such as imperial expansion take place above the level of the household, but household decisions often respond to the pressures and op­portunities that exist at a regional level (D' Altroy and Hastorf 2001; Wilk 1991). Brumfiel (1991), for instance, argues that Late Aztec cuisine shifted because of the domestic scheduling tradeoffs in time and labor necessary to meet state demands for tribute. Cases such as this suggest that do­mestic culinary practice can be sensitive to large­scale social dynamics, and thus represents a par­ticularly interesting window onto processes such as conquest and interaction. In this article, I adopt a "view from the kitchen" in order to investigate Chimu impact on local households in the Jequete­peque Valley of coastal Peru. 
Local Perspectives on Imperial Expansion 
Ancient empires employed various strategies to control conquered populations, including military force, political reorganization, and ideological manipulation. Control could be exerted directly by applying force, investing heavily in infrastruc­ture, and imposing state administrative control, or more indirectly by using local hierarchies and emphasizing ideological control, or at some point, along a continuum between more direct and more indirect forms of domination (D' Altroy 1992; Hassig 1985; Smith 2004; Stanish 1992). Strate­gies varied according to the needs of the state, the desirable resources available in each province, the existing level of sociopolitical complexity in the conquered territory, its distance from the im­perial heartland, and the response of the local population (Morrison 2001; Schreiber 1987; Si­nopoli 1994). The administration of a particular province could also change through time, accord­ing to the priorities of the empire or the situation on the ground. 
The Inka are well known for taking advantage of local hierarchies and existing systems of reci­procal obligation to rule indirectly, famously en­suring "that the larder of the peasant remain un­touched" (Murra 1984:79). In some instances, however, the impact of imperial conquest on local populations was dramatic. In the Mantaro Valley, for instance, Inka rule altered settlement patterns and land use to increase maize production, and reached into local households to reshape gender roles and the domestic economy (D' Altroy and Hastorf 2001 ; Hastorf 1991). In other provinces, the Inka applied a mix of strategies to different

dimensions of the local sociopolitical and eco­
nomic context, often drawing on existing social 
groupings and territorial divisions to reorganize 
and control provincial populations, negotiating 
power with local elites, but also investing heavily 
in state infrastructure. 
Rather than simply being dictated from the top, 
imperial administration and its impact on local 
populations were shaped by the complex interplay 
between the strategies of provincial populations, 
factional competition within ancient empires, local political and economic dynamics, and the goals of administrators (Schreiber 2005; Sinopoli 1994; Stark and Chance 2012; Stein 2002). From a "bot­tom-up" perspective, non-elite rural populations responded to regional political and economic change based on the demands imposed by the re­gional system, but also on internal processes and priorities within households. According to Fal­coner's (1995) analysis, for example, rural house­holds in the Bronze Age village of Tell el-Hayyat in Jordan demonstrated considerable flexibility in food production during the growth of regional ur­ban systems. Households produced more of some resources in order to participate in regional mar­kets, but also adopted strategies oriented toward maintaining ideals of autonomy and self-suffi­ciency at the household and community levels. Rural households, then, may sometimes resist full 
incorporation into regional systems, choosing to 
ensure long-term survival rather than maximize 
economic benefits (Wilk 1991). 
Household life can also change independently of regional or state trajectories. The case of Lukurmata (Hermann 1994) in the Bolivian alti­plano shows that dynamics that appear significant at a regional level may not transform rural house­
holds at all, and conversely, that not all household 
change occurs as a reaction to regional processes. Lukurmata households were not reorganized upon integration into the Tiwanaku polity, and only later adopted new forms of domestic production and community organization. While the range of household activities remained relatively stable, household architecture and allocation of space changed through time (Hermann 1994:238). In general, local responses to imperial expansion are complex. They may be articulated through existing cultural traditions or buffered by extra­household institutions, and in general are likely to be shaped by processes internal to households and communities as well as by the demands of imperial administrators. In the next section, I ex­amine the archaeological evidence for Chimu im­perial expansion, administrative strategies, and their effects on local populations. 
The Chimu Empire 
Around A.D. 900, the Chimu state coalesced in the Moche Valley, on the north coast of Peru (Fig­ure 1; Campana 2006; Moseley and Cordy­Collins 1990; Moseley and Day 1982; Ravines 1980; Rowe 1948). Chimu society is typically understood as highly complex and centralized. At the Chimu capital, Chan Chan, lower-class workshops and residences for a population of perhaps 30,000 clustered around 10 high-walled adobe palaces, or ciudadelas, which were con­structed according to a strict architectural canon that emphasized social control, restricted access to ritual, administration, and bureaucracy, and storage of bulk goods (Day 1982; Moore 1992; Topic 2003; Uceda 1997). The activities of inter­mediate elites and lower-class craftspeople at Chan Chan were oriented toward royal consump­tion, and likely dependent on state support (Kolata 
1983; Topic 1982). 
Outside of Chan Chan, the population of the Moche Valley functioned under a tight adminis­trative hierarchy to produce food and to complete state-sponsored construction projects (Keatinge 1975; Pozorski 1979, 1982). Irrigated fields were farmed intensively by residents of Chan Chan and rural sustaining villages under the supervision of rural administrative centers (Keatinge 1975, 1982; Moseley and Deeds 1982). On the basis of a set ofbotanical and fauna1 samples from Moc he 
Valley sites, Pozorski (1982) argues that farmers and other workers depended on a state redistrib­ution system to supply them with meat and other goods. Overall, evidence from the Moche Valley and the adjacent Chicama Valley (Pillsbury and Leonard 2004) suggests strong centralized control over production, distribution, and consumption in the Chimu heartland.

Because they conquered and incorporated ( 1981) argued that a system of split inheritance culturally and politically distinct polities, such drove later Chimu rulers to conquer new territory as the Late Sican to the north and the Casma to outside the heartland. On the other hand, Kolata the south, and because these areas retained some (1 990: 135) suggested that the state reoriented its aspects of their distinctive cultural identity and extractive economy from heartland agricultural even autonomy after conquest (e.g., Mackey production toward external expansion after a large 2011), the Chimu are a clear example of an An­El Nifio (ENSO) event around A.O. 1100, resulted dean empire (Sinopoli 1994). in catastrophic destruction of irrigation canals.

Mackey 2008) has employed a later date for Chimu expansion, placing its beginning after AD. 1300, and has argued that the Chimu employed a mix of direct and indirect strategies in conquered provinces. Mackey (2009:341) suggests that the Chimu were most interested in establishing con­trol over territory, trade routes, and key resources such as copper and Spondylus. They accom­plished this by placing state personnel and ad­ministrative architecture at provincial centers and intrusive settlements rather than intervening at the village level. Mackey also argues that the area of consolidated Chimu rule did not extend from Tumbes to the Chill6n Valley, as early researchers thought. Instead, the Chimu controlled a more restricted territory, from the lower La Leche to the Casma Valleys (Figure 1). 
In the classic model, the Chimu empire had a highly centralized economy and exerted strong political control over conquered territories. Nonetheless, new research from the provinces has disputed this model and emphasized the un­even nature of Chimu provincial rule. Tschauner (2001, 2008) argues that Chimu political control over the Lambayeque Valley was reinforced by intrusive hilltop settlements where Chimu admin­istrators and local elites lived and hosted guests. Nonetheless, he finds no evidence that craft pro­duction, especially of utilitarian goods, was cen­tralized or controlled by the Chimu, or that Chimu administrators were participating in an Inka-style labor tax by redistributing state goods to local workers. In Tschauner's analysis, political con­
quest was not reinforced by economic control over production, especially at the local level. 
Also in the Lambayeque region, Hayashida (2006) finds evidence for Chimu reorganization of agricultural production and daily life at the lo­cal level. Her survey of the agriculturally rich Pampa de Chaparri shows that the stable, locally 
managed irrigation system in place during the Middle and Late Sican periods was transformed during Chimu and later Inka rule. Changes were visible at multiple scales, including a shift in set­tlement patterns suggesting centralized control over the most productive parts of the system, the imposition of administrative centers, a move from separate household structures to combined do­mestic compounds, and even the construction of exclusive walled fields by the Chimu-Inka period 
(Hayashida 2006; Tellez and Hayashida 2004). Even within the Lambayeque region, the effect of Chimu conquest on local production and do­mestic life was uneven. 
Farther south, in the Jequetepeque Valley, Mackey's (2006, 2009, 2011) work at the Chimu provincial administrative center of Farfan sug­gests that the Chimu made little effort to share power with local lords. Instead, they destroyed an existing Lambayeque compound, placed two sacrificed women on the foundations, and then built their own compound on top (Mackey 2009:339). The Chimu also imposed an adminis­trative center at a key point for canal control at the valley neck (Keatinge and Conrad 1983), and engaged in large-scale projects to expand and re­inforce irrigation networks, ultimately intensify­ing agricultural production in the valley (Dillehay and Kolata 2004). At San Jose de Moro, they produced large quantities of maize beer (chicha) 
for consumption at the adjacent administrative center of El Algarrobal de Moro (Mackey 2004; Prieto 2011). Nonetheless, Swenson's (2007) analysis of hinterland ceremonial centers suggests that local elites manipulated imperial architectural symbols while maintaining a degree of political control and autonomy. Sapp 's (2011) work at the elite residence of Cabur also suggests that reor­ganization at lower levels of the political hierar­chy was minimal under the Chimu. As in the Lambayeque region, Chimu impact on the rest of the valley was felt unevenly. 
South of the Moche Valley, researchers find similarly mixed evidence for the impact of Chimu conquest. Vogel (2012a) argues that prior to Chimu expansion, the Chao Valley represented the northern frontier of the Casma polity. As the Chimu state began to coalesce, elites at the Chao Valley site of Cerro la Cruz incorporated some 
Chimu stylistic elements into their pottery but still maintained an independent identity. Ultimately, the Chimu conquered the Chao Valley, and Cerro la Cruz was intentionally burnt and ritually closed (Vogel 2012a:l77), suggesting that here, Chimu conquest significantly impacted local settlement patterns at least at the top of the settlement hier­archy. The Casma polity center of El Purgatorio was abandoned after Chimu arrival in the Casma Valley late in the fourteenth century (Vogel 20 l 2b), when power shifted to the Chimu provin-

cial center of Manchan. New Chimu-period set­tlements in the Casma were concentrated in the agriculturally productive lower valley, suggesting that the Chimu were interested in intensifying agricultural production (Mackey and Klymyshyn 
1990). However, Moore (1 985) found a lack of state control over the lower-class population at Manchan , and Koschmieder (2004; Koschmieder <ind Vega Centeno 1996) argues that hybridity and cultural fusion, rather than directly imposed con­trol, characterized the relationship between Chimu administrators and local populations at the ad­ministrative site of Puerto Pobre. 
Recent research outside the Chimu heartland has called into question the extent of centralized control over production and local populations ex­erted by the Chimu state apparatus. Specifically, the Chimu seem to have made highly visible po­litical statements by altering settlement patterns and establishing provincial administrative centers in conquered valleys, but aside from intensifying agricultural production, exerted little economic control over lower-class populations. The case of Pedregal supports this emerging view of Chimu administration as an uneven mosaic of direct and indirect strategies. 
Pedregal and the Jequetepeque Valley 
Environmental Setting. The Jequetepeque River flows west from the foothills of the Andes across a dry coastal plain to the Pacific Ocean (Figure 2). At the valley neck, the relatively restricted valley walls abruptly widen out and give way to the flatter, more open lower valley. Because of the low annual rainfall, averaging less than 30 mm/year, lower valley agriculture depends on extensive networks of irrigation canals (Eling 1987). Water availability fluctuates seasonally based on rainfall in the adjacent highlands, but the large flow volume of the Jequetepeque River (945 million m3 per year, compared to 321 million in the Moche Valley [Wilson 1988: 18]) allowed prehispanic residents to farm one of the larger cultivable areas on the north coast (Eling 
1987:107). Because the Jequetepeque flows year­round, prehispanic farmers could have harvested two crops per year. Beyond the irrigated flood­plains are sand dunes dotted with sparse vegeta­tion and isolated thickets of trees and shrubs such as zapote (Capparis angulata),faique (Acacia macracantha), and algarrobo (Prosopis sp.). 
The north coast of Peru is also rich in marine resources. Diverse marine and littoral habitats, including rocky and sandy intertidal and estuarine zones shading into the deep open waters of the Pacific, provide access to a wide range of fish and shellfish species within a relatively short dis­tance. The cold Humboldt Current, which runs north along the Pacific coast of South America, makes offshore waters extremely abundant in fish

and other marine life. Despite the occasional en­vironmental disruptions of El Nifio, large prehis­panic populations flourished in this area of the coast during the Late Intermediate period (LIP) 
(A.D. 1000-1300). The high levels of food pro­duction possible in the Jequetepeque may have made it an enticing target for Chimu expansion. 
Culture History. During the first half of the LIP, the Jequetepeque Valley was occupied by the complex Lambayeque polity. Pacatnamu (Donnan and Cock 1997) sat at the apex of a set­tlement hierarchy that included secondary admin­istrative sites like Farfan (Mackey 2009, 2011), residences of local elites at San Jose de Moro (Prieto 2010) and Cabur (Sapp 2011), the middle valley border outpost of Ventanillas (Cutright and Cervantes 2012), and agricultural villages such as Pedregal (Cutright 2009, 2010). Some have argued that during this period, the Jequetepeque was controlled by an expansive Sican state cen­tered in the Lambayeque/La Leche valleys to the north (Castillo 2001; Prieto 2010; Shimada 2000). Nonetheless, local variation in architecture, set­tlement patterns, and material culture suggest a high level of indigenous autonomy despite cul­tural and economic ties with the north (Mackey 2009, 2011; Sapp 2011). For this reason, I use the term Sicdn to refer to the Middle and Late Sican centralized states that controlled the Lam­bayeque-La Leche Valley region until Chimu conquest ca. A.D. 1375 (Shimada 1985, 2000), and Lambayeque to refer to the wider cultural phenomenon (after Zevallos 1971) and its ex­pression in the Jequetepeque Valley. 
Around A.D. 1320, the Jequetepeque was con­quered in what Spanish chroniclers later recorded as a bloody battle (Calancha 1982 [1638]; Mackey 2009). There is no evidence for a large-scale movement of Moche Valley colonists into the val­ley. Nonetheless, Chimu conquest marked a clear transition in the political structure of the Jequete­peque Valley. Pacatnamu was abandoned and po­litical focus shifted to Farfan, where existing ar­chitecture was razed, new administrative compounds were constructed according to impe­rial architectural canons, and members of the Chimu royalty arrived to administer the movement of people, goods, and information through the valley (Mackey 2009, 2011). As discussed above, land use, settlement patterns, and agricultural strategies changed after Chimu conquest (Dillehay and Kolata 2004; Keatinge and Conrad 1983). If Chimu rule reshaped life in provincial households, we should expect to see clear changes in the rural domestic economy in the Jequetepeque, as house­holds adapted to new tribute demands and expe­rienced the reorganization and intensification of agricultural production in the valley. In order to investigate whether this was the case, I conducted excavations at the rural village site of Pedregal in 2006 (Cutright 2009, 2010). 
The Community of Pedregal. Pedregal is a 5­ha multicomponent site with diagnostic materials spanning the Moche to Inka periods (ca. A.D. 500-1500). It is one of a string of villages stretch­ing along the Pampa de Faclo from the Lam­bayeque center of Pacatnamu east to Farfan, over­looking the irrigated river bottom (Hecker and Hecker 1990). The eastern portion of the Pampa de Faclo was irrigated in antiquity, and relic fields and canals are still visible (Eling 1987). Pedregal is located less than 5 km from the primary Chimu center of Farfan and adjacent to rich agricultural lands. If Chimu rule did reshape local production or daily household practice, such impacts would likely have been felt at Pedregal because of its proximity to valley centers, its role in agricultural production, and its participation in cultural tradi­tions and economic networks at the regional scale (Cutright 2013). 
During the LIP, Pedregal was a 2.9-ha village with a cluster of households and a small area of public architecture, flanked by cemeteries (Figure 3). The public area (Sectors B and C) drew on local LIP architectural canons (Swenson 2007) and included two low platform mounds at the end of a rectangular enclosure. The residential area consisted of six rectangular agglutinated do­mestic compounds to the south of the public area (Sector A). During the Inka period, an intervalley road ran through the site, cutting through one of the platforms and a household compound. In modem times, an airstrip partially destroyed the rectangular enclosure, and the platforms and cemeteries were extensively looted. 
In 2006, two 3-x-3-m units and several smaller 1-x-1-m test pits were excavated in each of three domestic compounds at Pedregal (Figure 3). Test units were also placed in other sectors of the site, but are discussed elsewhere (Cutright

Figure 4. Selected domestic ceramics from Pedregal. 
Occupation of these domestic compounds dates to the Chimu period, ca. A.O. 1320-1470 (Cutright 2013). Initial surface evaluation and mapping of Pedregal suggested a mixed Lam­bayeque and Chimu occupation, and it was hoped that these earlier and later moments of domestic occupation would correspond to periods before and after Chimu conquest of the valley. Excava­tion data confirm that Pedregal was occupied dur­ing the Lambayeque period. A radiocarbon date on cornstalks in platform fill had a two-sigma calibrated range of A.D. 1225-1381 (all dates calibrated with OxCal v4.1.5 [Bronk Ramsey 2010] using the Southern Hemisphere Atmos­pheric Curve [McCormac et al. 2004]; see Cutright 2013:7 and Blake et al. 2012) which could place it on either side of Chimu conquest of the Lambayeque around A.D. 1320. Based on adobe chronologies from Pacatnamu (McClelland 1986), construction in the public sector likely be­gan before Chimu conquest. 
Nonetheless, the break between earlier and later architectural phases in the domestic com­pounds does not likely correspond to Chimu ar­rival in the valley. Precise dating on the basis of ceramic typologies is complicated by the persis­tence of Lambayeque utilitarian styles, such as paddle-stamped alias, into the Inka period and the scarcity of diagnostic Imperial Chimu and Chimu-Inka fineware in nonelite contexts (Figure 4).

plates and small press-molded carinated ollas (Prieto 2008) were present at similar frequencies in both the earlier and later domestic occupations. Two radiocarbon dates from the earlier domestic occupation fall in the Chimu period, with two­sigma calibrated ranges of A.D. 1388-1445 and 
A.D. 1401-1462, respectively (Cutright 2013: Table 1). Thus, the households excavated at Pe­dregal most likely were inhabited during the Chimu period, though the community itself ex­isted before Chimu arrival in the valley. 
Local Experience of Chimu Rule: 
A View from the Kitchen 

I argue that changes in household activities from the earlier to the later occupational moment reflect the strategies of elite administrators and local res­idents in the context of Chimu imperialism. While the clear break between the earlier and later do­mestic occupations at Pedregal does not neatly correspond to the transition from Lambayeque to Chimu control over the valley, a pattern of di­achronic changes in household activities over the course of Chimu occupation does emerge. In this section, I will focus on changes that relate to food production, processing, and consumption in Pe­dregal households. If Chimu administrators were interested in extracting staple agricultural re­sources from conquered valleys, then increased production of maize, cotton, and other bulk sta­ples should be visible in the botanical assem­blages of sites such as Pedregal. Intensification of some kinds of production might influence the broader range of household activities, especially if the Chimu pulled rural villages into state-spon­sored distribution networks as they did in the Moche Valley heartland (Pozorski 1979, 1982) or reshaped local production as Hayashida (2006) documents farther north. Changes in household activity patterns would be visible in emphasis on different kinds of plant or animal foods, a reduc­tion in dietary diversity, or the appearance of more standardized or state-produced goods. Fi­nally, households may have made trade-offs in other realms of household life to support a greater labor investment in production for the state, as in the Aztec case discussed above (Brumfiel 1991). Household size or the efficiency of food prepa­ration techniques could have been adjusted to 
compensate for household investment in labor intensive crop processing activities. In the next section, I evaluate the artifactual, botanical, and faunal evidence for these potential impacts in the context of the ecological and cultural setting of Pedregal. 
Agricultural Production and Household Subsistence in the Jequetepeque 
In order to reconstruct subsistence practices at Pedregal, I look first at the foods procured by households. Isotopic analysis of skeletal remains was not possible, as no human remains were found in secure contexts. This discussion is based on analysis of macrobotanical, faunal, and shell remains recovered in the field from quarter-inch screens, and in the lab from three-liter soil sam­ples taken from each excavation context. Soil samples were screened through half-inch and quarter-inch sieves and then 1 liter of each was further screened through 1 mm and 5 mm mesh, following the protocol used by Gumerman (1991) at Pacatnamu. Subsistence remains were stan­dardized by volume to calculate densities, and also quantified according to ubiquity and propor­tion. Remains were analyzed on the basis of com­parative collections by project members and at the ARQUEOBIOS lab (Vazquez and Rosales 2007). A few ceramic sherds were tested for starch grains, but the most systematic analysis relies on macroremains of plants and animals. 
Faunal remains were quantified by Minimum Number of Individuals (MNI) and Number of Identified Specimens (NISP), but due to the frag­mentation of the assemblage and the small sample sizes from some contexts, NISP proved the most effective basis for comparison. Botanical remains were quantified by total number of identified parts. Differences in caloric contribution and preservation of both plants and animals mean that the proportion of the assemblage made up of a particular species does not necessarily represent the contribution of that species to diet in a straightforward way (Lennstrom and Hastorf 1995; Pearsall 2000). In this article, I use mea­sures of density, ubiquity, and relative proportions to counter the effects of sampling bias and chart shifts in subsistence through time.

and wild plants (Figure 5, Table 1). Cultigens such as maize, beans, chiles, sweet potato, and squash formed the basis of Pedregal diet. These were complemented by tree fruits such as guandbana, avocado, and lucuma, which would have grown around the irrigated margins of fields, and by wild species such as algarrobo and sea­weed. Pedregal residents raised camelids, guinea pigs (cuy), and dogs for household consumption. Shellfish were foraged from rocky and sandy shores near the mouth of the Jequetepeque River. The fish assemblage was dominated by two species: Paralonchurus peruanus (Peruvian croaker, or suco) and Engraulis ringens (an­choveta). Both fish and shellfish assemblages were diverse, suggesting that Pedregal residents were opportunistic in their consumption of these resources despite their reliance on a few econom­
ically significant species. 
Pedregal residents likely specialized in farm­ing, based on the density of crop remains, pres­ence of farming tools and their production at the site, and proximity to irrigated field systems. It is unclear whether residents would have been supplied with marine resources through state re­distribution, exchange with local specialists, or their own procurement efforts, but the diversity of fish and shellfish species suggests some com­bination of the latter two. Nonetheless, crop pro­cessing remains suggest that Pedregal households were intensively engaged in producing agricul­tural staples, likely in part for state tribute net­works. 
Crop Processing and Production for Tribute 
Models of Chimu expansion and provincial ad­ministration as well as settlement pattern evidence from the Jequetepeque suggest that the Chimu were interested in intensifying the production of bulk staples such as maize and cotton . These products could be stored, transformed into chicha and cloth, and used to support state work parties and elite festivities at the provincial center of Farfan. If this was the case, then production and processing of these crops should have increased through time at rural villages like Pedregal .
