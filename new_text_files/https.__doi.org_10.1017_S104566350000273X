find their expressions in declining health and nutri­
tional statuses in skeletons, coupled with increased mor­
bidity and mortality. To test the model, Wright takes 
into consideration several datasets that are designed to 
shed light on the role of biological factors in the changes 
that once took place in the Pasion region toward the end 
of the Classic period. Specifically, she considers demog­
raphy, dietary chemistry, enamel hypoplasia, and bone 
pathology. To place her information within a social con­
text, the author goes to lengths to characterize the Pasion 
region's cultural history and the social dimensions of 
its burial record. 
Logically organized into ten carefully crafted chap­
ters, Wright's investigation elucidates with each dataset 
that there is no single biological factor or any clear-cut 
pattern accounting for the so-called "Maya collapse," 
at least for the Pasion area. Wright's results demonstrate 
instead that dietary and health profiles were extremely 
heterogeneous on the eve of social disruption. Her 
results therefore contradict the idea that environmen­
tal degradation played a significant role in the sociopo­
litical and demographic changes and at the same time 
point to much more complex scenarios in which polit­
ical and social conflict should have played key roles. 
Without a doubt, the volume benefits from Wright's many years of research experience in the Pasion region and her longstanding investigation on dietary chemistry that have given her a solid understanding of both the potential, limitations, and biases that are inherent in this line of study. Besides the methodological soundness that characterizes Wright's work in general, I consider that the most important strength of this book lies in its explicit effort to interpret skeletal information within broader frames of social and cultural reference. I was especially delighted to see Wright's efforts in exploit­ing the mortuary record to point out (and quantify) the nature and changes of the Pasion sites' social organi­zation and individual standings within the social fab­ric. Her multivariate analyses of burial attributes, interpreted in terms of cautiously formulated proces­sual criteria (derived from role theory), warrant finely grained conclusions on changes in the area's individ­i ual and collective mortuary roles toward the Terminal

Classic. This approach is to be lauded especially in the 
view of the theoretical deficit that still hampers most 
contributions on skeletal information, when intended 
to be integrated with other datasets of the material 
record for broader bio-and sociocultural reconstruc­
tion and explanation. 
On the downside, this meticulously crafted investi­
gation is debilitated by the reduced size and deteriora­
tion of the skeletal series under study, a phenomenon 
that is notoriously known by the Mayanist community. 
The overall sample of 313 individuals, once divided by 
site, sex, status, and chronology, are bound to reduce 
the relevance and representativeness of the evidence 
they materialize and its potential for characterizing the 
living conditions leading to, or accompanying, the 
social changes in the region. 
In concluding, Lori Wright should be congratulated for having put together an important volume in Maya Pasion research and Maya bioarchaeology in general. This monograph is one of the few that evaluates the human mortuary record on a theoretically informed and regional scale, surely constituting an inspiration for other Maya bioarchaeologists.

Almost every culture has legends that tell of a mythical king coming from far away, a foreigner whose arrival would change the people's destiny. The Tainos were the first population in the New World that Columbus met upon his arrival, so it would be realistic to think that the Italian navigator was the stranger king that gives the title to this book. Much to my surprise, and as the author makes clear from the very beginning, Columbus is just an important character in the whole story. The real stranger king is Caonabo, the most powerful cacique in Hispaniola at the time of the conquest, a legendary and mythical figure also for the Tainos, and whose existence has survived the mist of time thanks to the colorful, and sometimes doubtful, historical narratives conveyed by the European conquerors. But as with all ethnohistori­cal accounts, much of the information has to be inter­preted on the basis of the view, mindset, traditions, and interests of the tellers. 
This book does not require one to be an expert on Taino culture, nor to be particularly well acquainted with Caonabo himself, or any other character or event. 
Taina Indians Myth and Practice: The Arrival of the Stranger King is a book about archaeology and ethno­history. History brings to us written acquaintance with past civilizations; archaeology instead rests upon mate­rial culture. Both aim at the same goal, from different perspectives, with their own intrinsic and extrinsic lim­itations. 
Keegan widens his views and opens up the reader's mind by putting aside the traditional schemes of inves­tigation and trying to objectively analyze and discuss the many different facets of the studies of ancient pop­ulations and even single, isolated events.

opinions that come from widely accepted ideas. He bor­rows the concept of chaos from physics and mathemat­ics to discuss the problems that archaeology faces by applying specific models in a rigid way, expecting there­fore rigid outcomes, and to explain the complexity of culture and, more so, the interaction between cultures. 
Keegan analyzes the interaction process between two completely different societies that all of a sudden came into contact. Both were characterized by their own beliefs and behaviors, which led the two parties to interpret the same events according to their own ideol­ogy. Columbus was welcomed because of a complex ideological, political, and mythical cosmos that per­meated the Taino society, the same features that led the mythical Caonab6 to become king. This chief, in fact, according to the narratives (which often report myths and legends as if they were real), was not a native of Hispaniola (nowadays the Caribbean island in the Greater Antilles that encompasses Santo Domingo and Haiti), being born in the Lucayan islands in the Bahamas archipelago. 
This is the starting point of Keegan's work: he argues that Caonab6 was indeed a real person who was not born in the island, and not just the product of myths and tales; he aims at unveiling from the archaeological and eth­nohistorical evidence the geographical, ethnic, and social origins of this important cacique and the ideo­logical and mythical reasons that brought his crowning into "practice." What was the Taino's social structure and ideological fabric, and how could a foreign chief become king? 
In order to accomplish his goal, Keegan structures this book into seven chapters, which allow him to put into context the whole frame of reference. He starts by providing a detailed analysis of the mythology of the Tai nos and how it was misinterpreted by the Europeans and turned into narratives. By putting together legends, myths, ideology, and chronicles, he demystifies, for example, the figure of the "cannibal" Caribs. Their human flesh-eating habits were a Taino's mythological perception that was enhanced by historians and anthro­pologists who missed the dichotomy between myth and reality. 
From legends back to archaeology, he reconstructs the archaeological contexts from detailed analyses and interpretation of various sites in Hispaniola and in the Lucayan islands, highlighting the economic relation­ships between these two regions (the Lucayan islands were a Taino outpost in the Bahamas), to eventually point to what he thinks can be the place of origin of Caonab6. Unfortunately no skeletal remains of Caon­ab6 exist, otherwise chemical analyses could corrobo­rate Keegan's hypothesis. What I consider the most important part of this book (without degrading the other chapters) is the careful analysis of the Taino's social structure and patterns of kinship and matrilocality, with­out which it would have been impossible to make infer­ences of any sort on Caonabo's place of birth. 
This book is a very interesting example of an open­minded combination of archaeology, ethnohistory, and cultural anthropology. It is also easy to read, because it is "seasoned" with the author's personal experiences through years of excavation of the sites as well as anec­dotes. At first glance, some might not have been nec­essary (like the extensive chapter on Sullivan's excavation), but in reality they contribute to give shape to an appealing work that can be useful for professional scholars as well as for amateur archaeologists regard­less of their region of interest.

For nearly a decade, the Classic Maya center of Piedras Negras, Guatemala, was subject to extensive excavations by archaeologists associated with the University Museum of the University of Pennsylvania (now the University of Pennsylvania Museum). Yet, as noted by the editors, John M. Weeks, Jane A. Hill, and Charles Golden, few official publications resulted from this pro­ject. Those that did emerge circulated little or remained hidden in the private libraries of researchers. In a worth­while effort to remedy the lack of published data, the editors have compiled most of these original papers and reports in a single volume. 
Divided into two parts, this book reproduces the individual fascicles that together composed the Piedras Negras Preliminary Papers (Part I) and Piedras Negras Archaeology: Architecture (Part II). Included in chap­ters are original figures, tables, and charts, which for the first time provide numerical designations for easy reference, as well as photographs converted to digital format in an effort to improve quality. The editors have amended portions of the original documents to follow contemporary conventions of archaeological publication, to promote accuracy, and to correct occa­sional omissions. These alterations appear as endnotes to each chapter, offering the dual benefit of retaining the original authors' writing and ensuring updated information for those who will use these data in their own work.
