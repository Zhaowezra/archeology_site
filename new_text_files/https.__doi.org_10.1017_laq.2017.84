A PERSPECTIVE FROM THE MAYA REGION: CLOSING THOUGHTS 
ON SLOAD AND SUGIYAMA, SUGIYAMA, AND SARABIA G.

The call to realign the absolute dates of the Teotihuacan ceramic sequence has implications for interpretation of the Late Formative to EarlyClassicthroughout Mesoamerica; ceram­ics,radiocarbon,andhieroglyphic datesfromthe Mayaregion mustbe consideredwhenevaluating this proposal.

worecent articles(Sload2015;Sugiyama et al. 2013)and the resulting exchange raise important questions about the dat­ing of Teotihuacan. I will not reinterpret other scholars’ excavations or their understandings of contexts,ortakeapositioninthis fruitful debate. Instead, my purpose is to draw the attention of readers of the journal who do not work at Teotihuacan to thebroader implications forthe Maya region and Mesoamerica. 
Chronologies are fragile structures that depend upon each other like a house of cards. Changestothe chronologyofapivotalcity often have consequences for distant sites. Inomata and colleagues’(2014)proposed realignmentof MiddletoLateFormative Kaminaljuyu ceram­ics, for example, has considerable and contested implications for contemporary sitesfromChia­pastoElSalvador(seeLove’sand Mendelsohn’s contributions in this issue). Proposed changes to the absolute chronology of the Teotihuacan sequence are even more momentous because of the centralimportanceof that city. 
Ceramics manufacturedintheMaya areahave been found at Teotihuacan, including Chicanel pottery mixed with Tzacualli sherds within the .ll of the Sun Pyramid. Absent from the same contexts are Early Classic Maya polychromes datingtoafterAD 150.It thereforeseems likely that tradeof Chicanel pottery occurred beforethe Preclassic Maya Collapse. Given the “tertiary” (sensu Sugiyamaetal. 2013)natureof.ll ceram­ics, theirrelevancetothe debateis limited;Late PreclassicMaya ceramicsfromthe Sun Pyramid do not supporta construction dateafterAD 150, butthe lack of EarlyClassicMaya pottery does not categorically rule it out. 
Until the advent of radiocarbon dating— and to a certain extent, into the 1980s—the absolute dates of Teotihuacan ceramic phases relied on educated guesswork and Maya hiero­glyphic inscriptions. A pivotal link in a long chain of argument was Xolalpan pottery from Teotihuacan foundin MoundsAandBofKami­naljuyu (Kidder et al. 1946). Those contexts also contained Early Classic polychromes from the Mayalowlands.Similar potterywasknownfrom Holmul (Vaillant 1935) and Uaxactun, where b’aktun 8 hieroglyphic inscriptions dated the

polychromes (Ricketson and Ricketson 1937, Smith 1955). This placed the Xolalpan phase in theMaya EarlyClassic. In the 1960s,Xolal­pan ceramicswerediscoveredatTikalin Early Classic contexts that also were dated by direct, stratigraphic, or iconographic association with texts containing hieroglyphic dates.Eventually, Teotihuacan imports or copies were recovered from multiple sites throughout the Maya area, sometimes with datable carbon. 
The best known and most studied cross-ties between Teotihuacan and the Maya region date to the Early Xolalpan phase, with a strong pulse of interaction commencing with the 11 Eb’15MakeventofAD 378 (Stuart 2000). These connections .zzled out circa AD 450, but there is evidence in the Maya area of an earlier .urryof interactioninMiccaotli or Early Tlamimilolpa times (Bove and Medrano Busto 2003:50–53; Braswell 2003:Figure1.2; Pender­gast 2003). This is smack in the middle of the period contested by Sload and Sugiyama and colleagues—that is, the late second and early third centuries AD. If Sugiyama and colleagues are correct,Mayanistsmayneedtopushforward our chronologies for the .rst half of the Early Classicbyacenturyorso.In particular, complex architectural sequences atTikal (Laporte 2003) and Kaminaljuyu (Kidder et al. 1946), ceramic phases at numerous sites(e.g.,Manik1 and2 atTikal, and Tzakol1 and2 atUaxactun), and interpretationsof thedevelopmentof interaction with Teotihuacan will need to begin later and be compressed. Realigning the Miccaotli and Tlamimilolpa phases later in time implies that early and late pulsesofinteractionwith theMaya were more or less continuous and limitedtothe fourth and early .fth centuries. Moreover, given that the absolute dates of Early Classic phases in theMaya area are tiedtothe Long Count,the realignmentoftheTeotihuacan ceramic chronol­ogy might entail a reevaluation of the GMT correlation. 
AbsolutedatesfromtheMaya arearelevantto interactionwithTeotihuacan—including during Miccaotli and Tlamimilolpa times—are abun­dant and proceed from multiple sites rather than a single, albeit immense, structure such as the Sun Pyramid.Asa Mesoamericanist who once worked at Teotihuacan, I am intrigued by the proposed redating of the Sun Pyramid. As a Mayanist,I am cautiousofasetof radiocarbon assays fromadistantpyramidthat mayrequire the realignment of many chronologies (some well dated, some not)fromthe Maya area. We must also consider much larger sets of abso­lute dates, as well as ceramic cross-ties, from throughout Mesoamericathat arerelevanttothe LateFormativetoEarly Classic periods.
