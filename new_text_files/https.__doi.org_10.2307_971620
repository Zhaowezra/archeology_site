REVIEWS AND BOOK NOTES 
Tumatumani excavations, the text and accompanying illustrations place more emphasis on the analysis of ceramics and lithics from the site. On the whole, the work reflects the professionalism of a very competent project director, Charles Stanish of the Field Museum, as well as the excellent analytical work of Lee Steadman, ceramicist, and Matthew Seddon, lithic ana­lyst. The work of Steadman and Seddon, in particular, meets a high standard of data reporting for the archae­ology of the altiplano. 
The work consists of three parts. In the first, Stanish and Steadman provide a brief summary of the archae­ology from the Juli area. In 18 pages they provide back­ground to the Tumatumani data. They give a short culture history of the southwestern Titicaca Basin including the period of Tiwanaku cultural influence, subsequent development of the Lupaqa polity, and the invasion of the lnka empire at the end of the fourteenth century. Surveys by the Lupaqa Project, initiated by Stanish, determined Tumatumani to be a multicompo­nent site consisting of both a Sillumocco occupation (200 B.C. to A.D. 750, roughly equivalent to late Formative Tiwanaku through Tiwanaku IV) and a Tiwanaku occupation (A.D. 750-1100). Mapping and surface survey at Tumatumani revealed two mound 
structures-a square mound to the southwest and what 
may have been a U-shaped mound to the northeast. 
Relatively little material was recovered from the inter­
vening area. 
The second part of the work provides a detailed 
analysis of ceramic and lithic data from the 
Tumatumani excavations. In this section, Steadman 
takes on the laborious task of describing in detail the 
ceramic assemblage from the site. To my knowledge, 
she provides the most detailed and precise descriptions 
of ceramic pastes and surface finishes available in the 
Tiwanaku literature. In particular, she deals admirably 
with plain and monochrome wares, often ignored by 
other researchers. It is unfortunate that given her pre­
cise typology Steadman could define only three tempo­
ral periods at Tumatumani-Early Sillumocco, Late 
Sillumocco, and Tiwanaku-reifying current gross 
chronological divisions rather than investigating rela­
tionships between chronologically sensitive ceramic 
styles. Despite the limited temporal division, she aptly 
concludes that Sillumocco had a potting tradition influ­
enced by, but independent from, those defined for 
Pukara, Chiripa, and Early Tiwanaku. 
Seddon's analysis of the lithics from the site com­
pletes Part 2 of the report. His analysis mirrors 
Steadman's, providing quantitative data for lithics 
types at the site. The description and analysis of lithic 
type and function is practical and critical but much less 
detailed than the work of Steadman. As Seddon notes, 
chronological analysis of the lithic material was limited 
by small sample sizes of diagnostic tools. For this rea­
son, differences between the Sillumocco and Tiwanaku 
periods remain more suggestive than conclusive. 
In the final part of the book Stanish offers some 
brief conclusions based on the work at Tumatumani. 
He suggests that the most important results of the Tumatumani excavations and the Lupaqa Project sur­vey are the data supporting a revised view of the alti­plano Upper Formative (ca. 200 B.C. to A.D. 400).The data presented are convincing that the Titicaca Basin in the Upper Formative was not simply polarized between two or three great centers but existed as a much more complex web of influence, emulation, and social and political interaction. In this, he follows Steadman's work to its logical end. Unfortunately, his innovative conclusions stop at A.D. 400. 
Regrettably, Stanish's remaining conclusions are largely reiterations of a dogmatic and uncritical view of Tiwanaku culture popularized in recent publications (Bermann, Lukurmata: Household Archaeology in Prehispanic Bolivia, 1994; Goldstein, Latin American Antiquity 4:22-47, 1993; Kolata, The Tiwanaku: Portrait of an Andean Civilization, 1993). The 
Tumatumani research had the potential to test ideas about social and political complexity before and during the period ofTiwanaku influence. Unfortunately, rather than take up this challenge, Stanish, and to a lesser degree his students, have been content to assert as fact what should be tested through excavation and data analysis. These assertions, slipped innocuously into Part 1, include ideas of Tiwanaku as "empire" or "expansive state," ideas of "occupation" and "control" by culturally Tiwanaku people, the centralized control of an agromanagerial bureaucracy, and the cultural affiliation of mound building with Tiwanaku culture. Although aspects of these ideas have been investigated, they have yet to be demonstrated convincingly by inde­pendent lines of evidence to support each of these assertions. As such, Stanish's research takes its place in a long line of tantalizing, but less-than-satisfying inves­tigations of the Tiwanaku phenomena.

LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 7, No. 2, 1996] 
There is often a disjunction-sometimes an unbridge­able gap-between the dirt archaeologist and the iconographer. After many years as a field archaeologist, including directing several seasons of excavations at Copan in the late 1970s, Claude-Franois Baudez has become a serious and devoted iconographer with a cer­tain fluency in Maya hieroglyphs gained from having worked with Berthold Riese, who was reading the hieroglyphic texts. This book presents the fruits of Baudez's labors in the fields of archaeology and iconography, which are not only related parts of a whole but greatly enriching to each other when brought together skillfully. 
The great Classic Maya site of Copan produced quantities of sculpture, some of the most elaborate in Mayadom, with perhaps the most complex iconogra­phy. Despite the subtitle, however, this book is not only about iconography. It incorporates an account of the exploration of the site, beginning with Garcia de Palacio in the sixteenth century, and a history of Copan archaeology and its literature. For a history of the site itself, there are comparative king lists from Baudez and Riese and from Linda Schele. 
Basically, Maya Sculpture of Copan is a catalogue of the Copan sculpture known up to the past few years with information on condition, dimensions, location, and archaeological history as well as the description and interpretation of motifs and glyphs incorporated in the sculpture. The main part of the book is divided into chapters on freestanding sculpture and architectural sculpture. The latter section, placing the sculpture in its architectural settings, has, for example, long sections on Temple 22, the Hieroglyphic Stairway, and Ball Court A. (Good information on the ball game and its significance is provided through discussion of the ball court as a cosmogram.) 
The latter part of the book begins with a history of monumental art at Copan, dealing with a study of "time-sensitive iconographic elements"--dress and symbolic objects that change through time-coordi­nated with dedication dates of the sculpture. Next, there is a chapter on religion and politics at Copan, which includes observations on bicephalic monsters and other cosmological creatures, as well as on ritual and king­ship. This section is a worthy contribution to Maya 
iconographic studies. 
Saying that he shares Tatiana Proskouriakoff's 
"view that iconography is a language" (p. 4), Baudez 
analyzes the syntax of that language with a structuralist 
approach. Dealing with two-headed cosmic monsters, 
right and left sides of monuments, cosmograms, and 
juxtaposed elements, he acknowledges the "scrupulous respect of symmetry in Maya art" (p. 4) as a part of the syntax. In the course of these presentations, he reviews relevant iconographic and glyphic literature and relates the sculpture to the subject matter painted on vases and the interpretation of painted vases. While addressing Copan specifically, Baudez recapitulates a good deal of the history of Maya studies generally. 
Appendixes include dedicatory dates of monuments and a list of glyphic elements (by T number) in the sculptural iconography. Hieroglyphic texts as such are not dealt with. 
The photographs of the sculptures are basically good, but printing on soft paper robs them of a clarity and contrast that would reveal more detail and liveli­ness. Drawings of many of the sculptures compensate somewhat for this drawback. 
Maya Sculpture of Copan does not include recent (and often exciting) discoveries of the continuing work at Copan, but Baudez treats the longer-known sculpture of the center of the site with care, knowledge, and thought. It will be hard to think or write about Copan without referring to this book, which will surely become a standard reference for the site, a foundation on which newer discoveries and interpretations can rest. If a book on the new work at Copan can be as rich as this one, that site, with its wealth of sculpture, will be well served indeed.

1\velve years after its completion, Graham's disserta­tion remains the most comprehensive work available on the archaeology of the Stann Creek District of Belize, and this publication of it is most welcome. Change has come so fast to this part of Belize that she correctly chose not to update the text, allowing it to stand as an authentic source for historians on fieldwork in the 1970s. She has added appendixes and references and made minor modifications, and this volume makes available clear photographs and drawings, in contrast to the University Microfilms version. I found in my fieldwork that her text contains many useful "leads" such as land ownership and usage, local artifact collec-
