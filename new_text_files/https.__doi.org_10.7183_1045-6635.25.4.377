CHRONOLOGICAL REVISION OF PRECLASSIC KAMINALJUYU, 
GUATEMALA: IMPLICATIONS FOR SOCIAL PROCESSES IN THE 
SOUTHERN MAYA AREA 

Takeshi Inomata, Raul Ortiz, Barbara Arroyo, and Eugenia J. Robinson 
Kaminaljuyu has been an important focus of archaeological research since the 1930s, and the chronologies of various sites of the Southern Maya Area are linked directly to that of Kaminaljuyu. The implications of the currently prevalent chronology of Kaminaljuyu are that various social and political institutions developed significantly earlier in the Southern Maya Area than in the Maya Lowlands during the Preclassic period. Our evaluations of new and existing radiocarbon dates through the application of Bayesian statistics, as well as ceramic cross-dating, indicate that the Middle and Late Preclassic portions of the Kaminaljuyu sequence need to be shifted forward in time by roughly 300 years. Our chronological revisions have the following important implications: ( 1) many centers in the Southern Maya Area suffered political disruptions around 400 B .C., roughly at the same time as La Venta and the centers in the Grijalva region of Chiapas; and (2) highly centralized 
polities with divine rulers and their depictions on stelae developed roughly contemporaneously in the Southern Maya Area and in the Maya Lowlands after JOO B.C. 
Kaminaljuyu ha sido unfoco importante de investigaciones arqueol6gicas desde la decada de 1930, y las cronologfas de varios sitios del sur del area maya han sido vinculadas directamente con aquella de Kaminaljuyu. La cronologfa prevalente de Kami­naljuyu, propuesta por Edwin Shook y Marion Popenoe de Hatch, implica que varias instituciones sociales y polfticas se desa­rrollaron significativamente mas temprano en el sur de la zona maya que en las Tierras Bajas mayas durante el periodo Preclasico. Nuestra evaluaci6n de fechas de radiocarbono nuevas y existentes a traves de la aplicaci6n de estadfstica Bayesiana fecha las porciones de! Preclasico Media y Tardfo de la secuencia de Kaminaljuyu aproximadamente 300 afios mas tarde. Las correlaciones relativas de cerdmica entre varias regiones basadas en los andlisis tipol6gico y modal son consistentes con esta nueva cronologfa. Las implicaciones mds importantes de nuestras revisiones cronol6gicas son las siguientes: (I) muchos centros en el sur de la zona maya sujrieron perturbaciones politicas alrededor de! 400 a.C., al mismo tiempo que el centro 
Olmeca de La Venta y los asentamientos en la region de! Rio Grijalva en Chiapas; y (2) las entidades polfticas altamente cen­tralizadas con gobernantes di vinos y sus representaciones en estelas se desarrollaron de manera contempordnea en el sur de la zona maya yen las Tierras Bajas mayas despues de! afio JOO a.C.

profound implications for our understanding of social processes in the Southern Maya Area. 
The currently most authoritative chronology of Kaminaljuyu is the one presented by Edwin Shook and Marion Popenoe de Hatch, which dates the Providencia phase to 700-400 B .C. and the Verbena-Arenal phases to 400 B.C.-A.D. 100 (Shook and Popenoe de Hatch 1999) (Figure 2). Although some scholars have suggested that the Providencia and Verbena dates by Shook and Popenoe de Hatch are 100 to 200 years too early (Kaplan 2011:270; Love 2002a), the majority of recent publications by Southern Maya Area spe­cialists adopt the Shook-Popenoe de Hatch chronology (Clark and Pye 2000; Fields and Reents-Budet 2005; Guernsey et al. 2010; Kosakowsky et al. 2000; Love 2007; Love and Kaplan 2011). The implications of the :Shook­Popenoe de Hatch chronology are that highly cen­tralized polities with divine rulership emerged substantially earlier in the Southern Maya Area than in the Maya Lowlands. At Kaminaljuyu, such political institutions were most likely established during the Verbena phase and continued during the subsequent Arena! phase. This process is evi­denced by two royal tombs, one with more than 298 offerings and the other with 157 grave goods found in a large mound, E-III-3, and by a sub­stantial number of stone monuments (Kaplan 2000, 2011; Parsons 1986; Shook and Kidder 1952). The Verbena and Arenal phases also wit­nessed a construction boom, including the devel­opment of a large canal system (Popenoe de Hatch 1997). In the Maya Lowlands, unequivocal royal tombs did not appear until 100 B.C. or later. Var­ious scholars have argued that rulership, writing, and the ruler-stela cult emerged earlier in the Southern Maya Area than in the lowlands (Coe

Here we present a substantial revision of this chronology through the examina­tion of ceramic cross-dating data and an evaluation of new and existing radiocarbon dates, which places the beginnings of the Providencia and Ver­bena phases roughly 300 years later (Figure 2). This chronological revision compels us to rethink the currently accepted interpretations of social processes in the Southern Maya Area. 

Brief History of the 
Kaminaljuyu Chronology 

The Carnegie Institution of Washington con­ducted major excavations at Kaminaljuyu from 1935 through 1952. The director of this project, Alfred V. Kidder, was one of the pioneers of chronological study in archaeology and had suc­cessfully established the Pecos sequence in the American Southwest before his work at Kami­naljuyu. The chronology of Kaminaljuyu, how­ever, turned out to be extremely challenging, re­flecting the complexity of social processes involved in the development and transformations of an urban center. Kidder was busy with various other duties as the head of the Carnegie Historical Research Division, and a substantial part of day­to-day operations fell on the shoulders of a young scholar, Edwin Shook. After the Carnegie Project, Shook continued to work in Guatemala and be­came the key person in the subsequent chrono­logical study of Kaminaljuyu. 

Shook worked at multiple lowland Maya sites as well. At various points in his career, he must have tried to build ceramic correlations between Kaminaljuyu and the Maya Lowlands. In the early 1950s, he wrote down what is probably the first version of such correlations in his notebook (Shook 1950) (Supplemental Figure 1). Except for its absolute dates, this cross-dating is remark­ably similar to the version we present in this pa­per. It is not clear why Shook diverged from this cross-dating in his later chronologies. A potential factor may have been the absolute date estimates that he made before obtaining radiocarbon dates. Shook ailotted a substantial time span to the Ver­bena and Arena! phases. Significant construction activities during Verbena and Arena! apparently gave him the impression that these phases were substantially longer than Providencia, which had more limited construction. This chart probably became a basis for the first published version of absolute date assignments (Shook 1952), in which Shook dated Las Charcas to 2000-1800 B.C., Arevalo to 1800-1600 B.C., Majadas to 1600­

1500 B.C., Providencia to 1500-1000 B..C., and Miraflores (Verbena) to 1000-500 B.C. The first sets of radiocarbon dates from Kaminaljuyu were published a few years later (Deevey et al. 1959; Libby 1954) . 
In 1968 Shook initiated excavations at Monte Alto and began to collaborate with Marion Pope­noe de Hatch, which resulted in the most preva­lent version of the Kaminaljuyu chronology (Shook and Popenoe de Hatch 1999) . Popenoe de Hatch has also worked on the ceramic se­quence of Tak'alik Ab'aj, which she linked to her and Shook's Kaminaljuyu chronology. 
Approaches and Data Sets 
We examined the Kaminaljuyu chronology through the evaluation of two data sets. One set consists of new and existing radiocarbon dates associated with Kaminaljuyu. These measure­ments were obtained by the Carnegie Project, the Pennsylvania State University Project, the project run by the Museum of Tobacco and Salt of Japan, and more recent investigations by Eugenia Robin­son in the Antigua Valley and by Barbara Arroyo at Naranjo and in the Kaminaljuyu Park (Figure 3). In addition, we examined radiocarbon dates from San Andres Semetabaj because of their his­torical importance. There have been a series of salvage operations at Kaminaljuyu, but besides the Miraflores II Project, to our knowledge no ra­diocarbon dates have been obtained by them. The most critical process in the evaluation of radio­carbon dates is the identification of valid and prob­lematic dates, an approach that some scholars call chronometric hygiene (Fitzpatrick 2006; Spriggs 1989; Tache and Hart 2013). We also applied Bayesian statistics to radiocarbon dates to further refine the chronology (Supplemental Text 1; Sup­plemental Figure 2; Supplemental Table 1). 
The other set of data refers to ceramic cross­ties with other regions. Ceramic data from the nearby regions of western El Salvador, the Salama Valley, and the Chixoy River region-along with their own sets of radiocarbon dates-allowed us to cross-check the chronology of Kaminaljuyu (Figures 3 and 4). More distant areas of the Gri­jalva River region in Chiapas and the Maya Low­lands provided additional data for comparison. We built ceramic correlations across different ar­eas by combining typological and modal data (Supplemental Table 2). We focused on types and modes that appear to have spread rapidly across various regions while recognizing that certain types and modes were transferred gradually from the area of origin to other regions. We find typo­logical data generally useful in correlating nearby areas, but we believe that cross-dating over wide areas should emphasize morphological modes that appear across diverse types, including wide horizontally everted rims, labial/medial flanges, scalloped/faceted ridges, nubbin and conical sup­ports, gancho (hook-shaped) rims, and larger tetrapod supports . 
We divide the Las Charcas phase at Kami­naljuyu into early and late facets. Early Las Char­cas ceramics can be aligned loosely with Pre­Mamom ceramics in the lowlands, Late Tok and Colos materials at Chalchuapa, and Chacte-Dyosan pottery in the Upper Grijalva region with a preva­lence of post-slip incisions. During the Late Las Charcas phase, correlations with these regions be­came clearer through the sharing of ceramics with glossy/waxy slips and blotchy/cloudy orange resist decorations, some of which occur on nearly iden­tical vessel forms across diverse regions. As noted by Arthur Demarest and Robert Sharer ( 1982; De­marest 1986), Providencia ceramics were closely related to the Chui complex at Chalchuapa and Santa Leticia in western El Salvador through the sharing of numerous specific types, including Kaminaljuyu Brown-Black, Rofino Fine Red, Morlino Purple-on-Red, and Olocuitla-and Ji­calapa-corresponding Usulutan. The Providencia phase also correlates to Toi of the Salama Valley, Noguta 1 of La Lagunita, Early Chicane! of the Maya Lowlands (Cantutse of Ceibal), and Guajil of the Upper Grijalva Valley, through the sharing of glossy/waxy red ceramics and labial/medial flanges. In other words, although the Providencia phase is placed in the Middle Preclassic period in the Shook-Popenoe de Hatch chronology, its ce­ramics are aligned with Late Preclassic materials in other regions. The ceramics of the Nil phase of Tak'alik Ab'aj are substantially different from those of the highlands, but this complex is tied to Providencia ceramics through Xue White Paste, Monte Alto Red, scalloped ridges, and coarse in­cisions.

Note that the figure does not rep­resent a single Bayesian model. Each set of dates was analyzed separately with Bayesian statistics, as discussed in the text, and is presented in individual figures (Figures 5-12, Supplemental Figures 4, 6--8). The resulting outputs of valid dates are compiled here. Thus, Bayesian outputs of recently obtained dates are not affected by dates from old projects. Premodeled distributions of calibrated date probabilities are indicated by light shading, whereas Bayesian modeled dis­tributions of calibrated date probabilities are shown by solid fill.

During the Arena! and corre­sponding phases, the size of tetrapods grew, lead­ing to the appearance of large mammiform sup­ports in the following Santa Clara phase. 
Radiocarbon Dates from 
Kaminaljuyu and Related Sites 

Radiocarbon dates obtained by different projects are characterized by diverse levels of accuracy and precision, and their descriptions of associ­ated ceramics vary substantially. Thus, we ap­plied Bayesian statistics to different sets of dates separately. 
Carnegie Project 
Most radiocarbon dates from excavations by the Carnegie Institution were processed in the 1950s (Deevey et al. 1959; Libby 1954), but one date (M-1257) from Stephan Borhegyi's excavation was run in the early 1960s (Crane and Griffin 1964; Figure 5; Supplemental Table 1). In some cases, the same samples-or samples from the same contexts -were dated first at the University of Chicago by Willard Libby in 1953-1954 and then at Yale University in 1956-1958. The Chicago and Yale dates exhibit wide discrepancies. It is now clear that the Chicago dates are substantially off, reflecting technical difficulties at the advent of radiocarbon dating technology. The accuracy and precision of radiocarbon measurements im­proved substantially when proportional gas coun­ters replaced the original Libby counters (Povinec et al. 2009). The Yale dates obtained with a pro­portional gas counter accord remarkably well with dates obtained recently. In the case of the Tikal lintels, Libby's Chicago lab dates were also sub­stantially older than those obtained by a propor­tional gas counter (Libby 1954; Satterthwaite and Ralph 1960; see also Kennett et al. 2013). We should note that the Yale dates may show a ten­dency to give slightly younger measurements, pos­sibly because effective sample pretreatment pro­tocols were not yet developed (Olsson 2009). 
We should comment on two problematic phases. Arevalo and Majadas Arevalo ceramics, which were found in the fill of Mound C-III-10 mixed with a small quantity of Las Charcas ma­terials, are dated to the Early Preclassic period in the Shook-Popenoe de Hatch chronology. The two Yale radiocarbon dates on Arevalo materials, how­ever, are: younger than the Las Charcas dates. Other Yale dates are remarkably good, and we have no reason to think that these Arevalo dates are anomalies. They suggest that most of Arevalo ceramics postdate the Las Charcas phase. The Majadas phase is also controversial. Majadas ce­ramics were found in two caches in Mounds C­III-6 and C-III-10, and Shook identified them as transitional materials from Las Charcas to Provi­dencia. More recently, Hermes and Velasquez (1996) claimed to have identified Majadas ceram­ics in their excavations. Majadas ceramics, how­ever, were never fully published, and they are not present in the ceramic collection at the Instituto de Antropologfa e Historia (IDAEH). Because of the difficulty in evaluating the status of this pro­posed ceramic complex, we did not include the Majadas phase in our revised chronology. 
The remaining Yale dates fit our chronology. The two Las Charcas dates represent the late part of this phase. Finca Las Charcas Pit 1, where Y­384 was collected, and Pit 2B, where M-1257 was taken, both contained Late Las Charcas ce­ramics. Thus, the radiocarbon dates and ceramic data accord well. Y-374 is adequate for the Prov­idencia phase, although Y-370 may represent char­coal mixed from upper layers or a problematic measurement. The Verbena dates are consistent internally and in accordance with those obtained later, although Y-391 may be somewhat old ma­terial. In sum, after rejecting the Chicago dates, one cannot find any date in the Carnegie data set that conforms to the Shook-Popenoe de Hatch chronology. Although the accuracy of the Yale se­ries over the Chicago one is obvious in retrospect, at that time Shook had few other radiocarbon dates from Mesoamerica with which to compare them. Soon, comparative radiocarbon dates that sup­ported the Yale series began to trickle in, but Shook apparently had difficulty rejecting the Chicago series, which better matched his pre-ra­diocarbon-dating chronology (Shook 1952). 
In 1961, Michael Coe (1961), building on his sequence for La Victoria on the Pacific Coast, suggested that the Las Charcas phase belonged to the Middle Preclassic period, dating it to 700­

300 uncalibrated B.C. In 1964, M-1257 from Borhegyi's excavation was published, giving fur­ther support to the Yale series and to Coe's sug­gestion (Crane and Griffin 1964). These lines of evidence, however, failed to convince Shook. In his 1965 publication, Borhegyi ( 1965) placed Las Charcas at 1000-500 uncalibrated B.C. and Prov­idencia at 500-300 uncalibrated B .C. This chronology appears to be a compromise between the Chicago and Yale dates; the proposed dates fall between the Chicago and Yale sets and match neither of them. Borhegyi probably received his radiocarbon dates after writing the manuscript; in his later publication, he placed the Las Charcas phase at 450-200 uncalibrated B.C. (Borhegyi 
1970). It is not clear whether the 1965 Borhegyi chronology largely reflected Shook's view, or whether his interpretation influenced Shook's later chronological study. 
Pennsylvania State University Project 
Radiocarbon dates from the Pennsylvania State University excavations were processed in the early 1970s (Michels 1973) (Figure 6; Supple­mental Table 1). The Penn State researchers ob­tained these dates mainly for the purpose of cal­ibrating their obsidian hydration dating method. Their excavations followed arbitrary levels, and descriptions of associated ceramics are often not clear (Michels 1979). The phase assignment of excavation lots appears to have been based mainly on the results of obsidian hydration dates, the va­lidity of which has been questioned by other re­searchers (Anovitz et al. 1999; Braswell 1992). In addition to the radiocarbon dates listed in Sup­plemental Table 1, they published eight more measurements, but they are not included in our study because the associated ceramics are not clear. We should also note that many of their types span the entire Preclassic and Classic peri­ods (Wetherington 1978). Some scholars think that the Penn State ceramic sequence is invalid and that contextual information based on it is un­usable. The Penn State radiocarbon dates certainly need to be treated with caution, and we did not rely much on them in our chronology-building. Nonetheless, a summary of this ceramic sequence with vessel shapes presented by Wetherington (1978:126, Figure 3) is largely consistent with our version of ceramic chronology, and we as­
sume that the phase assignments given to radio­carbon dates have some validity. The Penn State radiocarbon dates are indeed largely consistent with other sets of dates, except for 1-6247, which lacks clear ceramic association. 
Shook certainly considered these dates. Later he commented to Geoffrey Braswell (2003:85) that "Nothing has messed up our understanding of Kaminaljuyu chronology more than those ob­sidian dates; they set us back twenty years ." It appears that he decided to reject the Penn State chronology entirely when criticism of obsidian hydration dating was raised. The Shook-Popenoe de Hatch chronology, published roughly 20 years after the Penn State reports , was meant to correct this problem. Nevertheless, the Penn State chronology was generally adequate in retrospect. The Penn State team's obsidian hydration dating may have been based on untenable premises, but it does not mean that we should discard the ra­diocarbon dates used for its calibration. 
San Andres Semetabaj Excavations 
The site of San Andres Semetabaj is located on the northern shore of Lake Atitlan, roughly 65 km to the west of Kaminaljuyu. Despite its distant location, we discuss data from the site here be­cause of their historical importance. Shook and Popenoe de Hatch excavated at Semetabaj in 1978 and immediately published a report (Shook et al. 1979). They defined the chronology of this site through ceramic correlations with the Kami­naljuyu sequence. Their chronology corresponds with Borhegyi's 1965 sequence, although Borhe­gyi (1970) himself had already changed his date assignments. The radiocarbon dates were reported in an addendum, and Shook and Popenoe de Hatch noted that they received these dates after writing the report (Figure 7; Supplemental Table 1). 
In their report, GX-5857 is assigned to the "Late Preclassic," which was their period assign­ment for the Verbena-Arenal-corresponding phases. Nevertheless, Popenoe de Hatch (personal communication 20 13) has noted to Inomata that the post of the structure, from which this sample was taken, belongs to the Early Classic period. The sole Providencia-corresponding date, GX­5859, with an uncalibrated date of 710 ± 175 
B .C., appears to have significantly affected Shook and Popenoe de Hatch's later thinking. The Prov-

This sample, which was collected from a secondary context, was probably old charcoal that was mixed into plaza construction fill. 
Museum of Tobacco and Salt Project 

The Museum of Tobacco and Salt (MTS) of Japan investigated Kaminaljuyti from 1991 to 1994 (Ohi 1994) (Figure 8; Supplemental Table 1). Its in­vestigations focused on Mound B-1-1, but also involved small-scale salvage and restoration work at Mound D-III-1. MTS researchers did not adopt traditional names for ceramic types and phases, nor did they tie in their results with those of pre­vious work. Disregard became mutual; other re­searchers paid little attention to the MTS data or considered them unusable. MTS researchers, however, published a set of radiocarbon dates from secure contexts with excellent illustrations of the associated ceramics. In particular, a sub­stantial portion of radiocarbon dates were taken from caches associated with structure renovations. Full illustrations of over 100 vessels from these caches allow researchers to correlate these mate­rials with other ceramic classification systems and conventional chronological phases with rea­sonable certainty (Supplemental Text 2; Supple­mental Figure 3). We suggest that the MTS pro­ject's Period II encompasses the Providencia phase and the Providencia-Verbena transition and that Period III corresponds to much of the Ver­bena-Arena! phases. 
The MTS dates support our placement of the Providencia and Verbena phases. The Bayesian model places the Providencia-Verbena transition to around 100 B.C. Nonetheless, the MTS radio­carbon measurements exhibit substantial ranges of unce1tainty, and we need more data in order to narrow down the date of the Providencia-Verbena transition. The combined date of NUTA-2109 and NUTA-2056 (not further processed with Bayesian statistics) around 60 cal B.C. appears to adequately mark the Verbena-Arena! transition.

Antigua Valley 
More precise radiocarbon dates, including those measured with accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS), began to be obtained after the 1999 pub­lication of the Shook-Popenoe de Hatch chronol­ogy. The first set of such dates directly relevant to Kaminaljuyu came from excavations at the Urias site in the Antigua Valley carried out by Robinson et al. (2002, 2006) in the 1990s and 2000s as part of the Proyecto Arqueol6gico del Area Kaqchikel (Figure 9; Supplemental Table 1). The Antigua Valley is located in the Depart­ment of Sacatepequez, roughly 20 km to the southwest ofKaminaljuyu. The ceramic sequence of this region correlates closely with that of Kam­inaljuyu, although it also exhibits some ties with materials from the Pacific Coast. Robinson's Agua phase corresponds to the Las Charcas phase, and the Sacatepequez phase, originally proposed by Shook, corresponds to the Provi­dencia phase. Robinson originally accepted the Shook-Popenoe de Hatch chronology of Kami­naljuyu, but her own data led her to suspect that there might be some temporal differences be­tween the corresponding ceramic complexes of Kaminaljuyu and the Antigua Valley (Robinson et al. 2006). Nevertheless, substantial time dif­ferences in the use of shared ceramic styles be­tween these nearby regions are unlikely.

Beta-154187, obtained from the sterile or near­sterile Level 25 , determines the oldest possible limit for the ceramic occupation of Urias, whereas Beta-114963 from Level 24 is a clear outlier. The remaining seven dates belong to the Agua/Las Charcas phase. The distribution of these dates suggests that the ceramic occupation of the site most likely did not start until 800 or 700 B.C. The Las Charcas-corresponding dates are divided into a group affected by the 800-400 B.C. cali­bration curve plateau and one associated with the 400-200 B.C. upturn (see Supplemental Text 1). The Bayesian model based on the stratigraphic sequence narrows down their probability distrib­utions. Beta-141170 was taken from a burial in Level 17, which contained a zoned red-and-or­ange bichrome bowl characteristic of the Las Charcas phase. The Bayesian model places the median date of this sample around 370 cal B.C. We consider Beta-141 170 to be an important date from a secure context that helps us to narrow down the Las Charcas-Providencia transition to around 350 B .C. 
Recent Naranjo-Kaminaljuyu Excavations 
Arroyo's excavations at Naranjo, Santa Isabel, and the Kaminaljuyu Park provide the most recent set of radiocarbon dates from the greater Kami­naljuyu area. Naranjo was the primary early cer­emonial center in the Kaminaljuyu area, with nu­merous stone monuments dating to the Las Charcas phase. Arroyo (2010) excavated this site from 2005 through 2007 . We also include new dates from Santa Isabel, another Las Charcas set­tlement in the area, and from Arroyo's ongoing excavations in the Kaminaljuyu Park. In addition, Jonathan Kaplan kindly provided five unpublished dates from the Miraflores II Project directed by Juan Antonio Valdes in the mid-l 990s (Valdes and Kaplan 2000). Early Classic dates obtained from the Brigham Young University-Universidad del Valle excavations in the Kaminaljuyu Park complete the list of currently available radiocarbon dates on Kaminaljuyu (Figure 10; Supplemental Figure 4; and Supplemental Table 1). 
Arroyo originally followed the Shook-Popenoe de Hatch chronology and suggested that the main occupation of Naranjo spanned the Las Charcas and Providencia phases. The reexamination of ce­ramics excavated from the site, however, indicates that the majority of them belong to the Las Char­cas complex. The ceramics of Naranjo need fur­ther analysis, but we tentatively place what Arroyo originally classified as Las Charcas in our Early Las Charcas phase and her original Providencia materials in our Late Las Charcas phase. During the Providencia phase, a small population occu­pied the peripheral zones of Naranjo, and the site core continued to receive ritual visits. Thus, in­trusions of later ceramics are not uncommon . There remain some ambiguities in the ceramic as­sociation ofBeta-217153, but we tentatively place it in Late Las Charcas. Like Beta-141170 from the Antigua Valley, this radiocarbon date shows the highest probability around 380 cal B.C. after Bayesian analysis. If the contextual interpretation of this sample is correct, this date gives additional support for our placement of the end of the Las Charcas phase around 350 B.C. Ceramic data sug­gest that the main occupation of Santa Isabel was probably in the Late Las Charcas phase , and the two samples from this site accord with our pro­posed range of this phase. 
Beta-16710, obtained from Miraflores II, indi­cates that the Providencia phase dates to the Late Preclassic period. Along with Beta-361803 and Beta-164706 from Verbena contexts, it places the Providencia-Verbena transition around 50 B .C. Beta-320688 and Beta-320689 from Arenal con­texts are probably somewhat old materials . Beta­307567 helps us to place the beginning of the Are­nal phase around A.D. 50. Two dates from Santa Clara contexts, Beta-361798 and Beta-361800, show ranges around cal A.D. 200 and conform to the expected dates of this phase. Beta-16708 from an Aurora context and Beta-16709 from a Santa Clara context of Miraflores II show earlier dates than the Verbena and Providencia samples from the same project, and they most likely represent old charcoal pieces that were redeposited. 
Interpretation of Radiocarbon Dates on Kaminaljuyu 
Our review shows the near absence of radiocar­bon dates that accord with the placement of the Providencia and Verbena phases in the Shook­Popenoe de Hatch chronology. The sole exception is the highly questionable date of GX-5859 from San Andres Semetabaj, which appears to fall in the gap between the Chicago and Yale dates from

the Carnegie Project. Nonetheless, this date prob­ably resulted from old charcoal mixed in fill. An important factor that affected the Shook-Popenoe de Hatch chronology appears to have been Shook's original perception, later shared by Pope­noe de Hatch, that the Verbena-Arenal phases­with numerous construction episodes-should be long. Our chronological revision simply makes the construction boom during the Verbena-Arenal phases even more impressive. 
After clearly problematic radiocarbon dates are rejected, the remaining dates from different projects are remarkably consistent. We should emphasize that we applied Bayesian statistics separately to different sets of dates. Thus, the re­sults of Bayesian analysis on recent, more precise dates are not affected by dates from old projects with larger error ranges. These data indicate that the beginning dates of the Providencia and Ver­bena phases are roughly 300 years later than those suggested by the Shook-Popenoe de Hatch chronology. The Providencia phase, currently placed in the Middle Preclassic period, should be moved to the Late Preclassic period. 
Comparative Data from Other Regions 
Radiocarbon dates and ceramic cross-dating data from other regions provide additional evidence with which to refine the chronology of Kami­naljuyti . In addition, the chronologies of monu­ments and other elements indicative of highly centralized polities in these regions are critical for our understanding of social processes in the Southern Maya Area. 
Tak'alik Ab 'aj 
This site was originally investigated by the Uni­versity of California, Berkeley, under the direction of John Graham, and, more recently, it has been excavated by the Proyecto Nacional Tak'alik Ab'aj under the direction of Miguel Orrego and Christa Schieber de Lavarreda. Popenoe de Hatch (Popenoe de Hatch and Schieber de Lavarreda 2001; Popenoe de Hatch et al. 20 1 1) has been analyzing its ceramics, and ties the chronology of this site directly to that of Kaminaljuyti. The Ixchiya phase corresponds to Las Charcas, Nil to Providencia, Rocio to Verbena, and Ruth to Are­nal (Figure 2). Our revision of the Kaminaljuyti sequence dictates that the chronology of Tak'alik Ab'aj also needs to be shifted accordingly. The Ixchiya phase may begin around 800 B.C. The Nil complex contains vessels with glossy slips and wide horizontally everted rims that are closely related to those of the Francesa/Foko phase in the Grijalva River region and the Mamom-Chi­canel transition in the Maya Lowlands. Thus, we place the beginning of Nil earlier than Providen­cia, around 500 B.C. The Rocfo and Ruth phases can be placed in the Protoclassic period alongside Verbena and Arenal . 
Schieber de Lavarreda and Orrego (20 10) have suggested that Olmec-style monuments were erected at Tak'alik Ab'aj during the Ixchiya and Nil phases before 400 B.C., followed by a shift to the Maya style during the Rocio and Ruth phases. In terms of absolute dating, the end of Olmec-style monument erection around 400 B.C. corresponds to the collapse of La Venta. In terms of ceramic phases, however, our chronological revision suggests that many of the Olmec-style monuments probably belong to the Ixchiya phase alone. In particular, Monument 64, found in an Ixchiya context and covered by later construc­tions, can be dated fairly securely to this time range (Schieber de Lavarreda and Orrego 2010; Schieber de Lavarreda and Perez 2004). Because of the common practice of re-setting monuments, it is not clear whether Olmec-style monuments continued to be carved during the Nil phase after 400 B.C. Maya-style monuments were probably not produced before the Rocfo phase. A monu­ment of this kind found in the earliest stratigraphic context is Altar 48 , with four glyphs. It was found in a Rocfo context and was originally dated to 400-200 B .C. (Schieber de Lavarreda and Orrego 2009, 2010). Our chronological revision places it after 100 B.C. In other words, the inventory of monuments for the Nil phase between 400 and 100 B.C. is not clear. We need to reevaluate the chronology of monuments, considering the pos­sibility of cessation or decline in monument pro­duction after 400 B.C. 
This modification also indicates that major construction activities, as well as the interment of a rich tomb, Entierro 1, which took place dur­ing the Rocio and Ruth phases, can be aligned with the Protoclassic phases in other regions (Schieber de Lavarreda 2003). In addition, our

chronological revision makes the "ofrendas ma­sivas" of the Ruth phase, containing numerous vessels and stone spheres and associated with Stela 13 and Altar 46, contemporaneous with sim­ilar caches found at Ceibal, in Chiapas, and other regions (lnomata et al. 2010; Schieber de Lavarreda 2002; Schieber de Lavarreda and Perez 2005; Schieber de Lavarreda and Orrego 2010). The Tak'alik Ab'aj sequence needs to be further examined with full publication of its ceramics. 
Western El Salvador : Chalchuapa and Santa Leticia 
Sharer originally noted close similarities between Kaminaljuyu's Providencia and Verbena-Arena! ceramics and corresponding materials at Chalchuapa (Sharer 1978). With additional data from Santa Leticia, Demarest and Sharer then developed the more specific concepts of the Prov­idencia and Miraflores ceramic spheres (Miraflo­res is another name for the Verbena-Arena! phases). They dated these spheres to 400-100 
B.C. and 100 B.C.-A.D. 250, respectively (De­marest 1986; Demarest and Sharer 1982). 
Our reanalysis of radiocarbon dates confirms the validity of the chronology proposed by De­marest and Sharer (Figure 11; Supplemental Table 1). The Colos dates show wide probability distri­butions because of the calibration curve plateau and because there are no dates from the following Kai phase. Based on ceramic cross-ties with other areas, we estimate that the Colos phase dates to roughly 800-600 B .C. The lack of Kai dates also makes the start date of the Providencia-corre­sponding Chui phase imprecise. In our Bayesian model, Q-3108 is pulled forward in time toward the other three younger Chui dates. We suspect that Q-3108 's unmodeled distribution with the highest probability around 400 cal B.C. may be a better approximation of its true date. This might place the beginning of the Chui phase around 400 B.C. There is some overlap between Chul and Early Caynac dates, but the Bayesian model places their transition around 50 B .C . This date matches the ceramic cross-dating well. Nubbin and conical feet appear toward the end of the Chui phase at Chalchuapa and Santa Leticia, sug­gesting that this phase continued slightly later than the Providencia phase at Kaminaljuyu. The ceramics from caches placed on Floor 4 of Mound B-1-1, excavated by the MTS, contain a small number of vessels with nubbin feet. This indicates that this mode began to appear at the transition from Providencia to Verbena, but conical feet do not occur until Verbena. For the Verbena-corre­sponding Early Caynac phase, we consider Q­3103 to be an outlier. There is only one radiocar­bon date from each of the Late Caynac and Vee phases, but the Early Caynac-Late Caynac tran­sition around A.D. 50-100 and the Late Caynac­Vec transition around A.D. 250 accord well with our chronological revision and cross-dating with other areas. Apart from these minor adjustments, the chronology proposed by Demarest and Sharer is sound. 
Salama Valley 

Sharer and Sedat (1987) explored the Salama Valley located in the northern Guatemalan high­lands (Figure 12; Supplemental Table 1). Sharer dated ceramic phases as follows: Early Xox 1200-1000 B.C., Late Xox 1000-800 B.C., Max 800-500 B.C., Tol 500-200 B.C., Uc 200-1 B.C., and Quej A.D. 1-200. A small quantity of Early Xox ceramics were found in Sakajut Structure A3 , Feature 3, and Las Impresiones Feature 1, a midden. The charcoal sample for a radiocarbon date , P-3208 , was collected from the former de­posit. P··3208 exhibits a wide range ofuncertainty, and it is noted that the sample was too small for NaOH pretreatment. Thus, the reliability of P­3208 is uncertain. 
There are not enough data for the determina­tion of Late Xox-Max transition. The Max com­plex is characterized by glossy/waxy slips and blotchy orange resist decorations that are related to Mamom ceramics of the Maya Lowlands. These wares, as well as streaky gray-brown ves­sels, tie the Max phase to the Late Las Charcas phase of Kaminaljuyu. P-2 139 was collected from a possible ritual hearth made directly on the sterile soil layer and was associated with Max ceramics. Sharer noted that this radiocarbon date was too young, but this date from an excellent context should not be discarded so easily. The calibration curve upturn gives a common probability range of 400-200 B.C. to this measurement (see Sup­plemental Text 1), but its true date is likely close to 400 B .C., as indicated by our Bayesian model. We interpret this measurement to be a good date

and place the end of the Max phase around 350 
B.C. This dating accords well with that of the Late Las Charcas phase. 
The Tol complex is tied to Providencia at Kam­inaljuyu and Chul at Chalchuapa by the shared black-brown vessels with coarse incisions , labial/medial flanges , and scalloped ridges, as well as imported purple-on-red ceramics and Jicalapa Usulutan. This phase is the best dated, with 10 radiocarbon measurements. Among them, P-2138 and P-2222 are older than samples from lower layers and can thus be considered old materials that were mixed in. The youngest Tol date, P­2221, was taken from a thick layer of carbon that resulted from a burning event associated with Las Tunas Structure C6-2-2. P-2222, taken from the fill of the next version of the building, C6-2-1, is older than P-222 1 and is rejected as old mixed charcoal. P-2221 is securely tied to the Tol phase because the fill of C6-2-2 and C6-2-1 contains Tol ceramics, and Uc ceramics are almost non­existent at this site. Sharer considered P-222 1 to be too young, but, given its excellent context, the inclusion of later material is unlikely. We think that P-2221 is a valid date. Although the Bayesian model places the probability distribution of P­2221 closer to the rest of the Tol dates, we suspect that the unmodeled date of around 40 cal B.C. better approximates its true age. We tentatively place the Tol-Uc transition around 50 B.C. 
This adjustment of the Tol phase is supported by ceramic cross-dating. Sharer noted that the Tol complex included a small number of black­brown vessels with fine post-slip incisions, which are characteristic of the Verbena phase at Kami­naljuyu. If so , Tol may overlap with Verbena and corresponding phases in other regions. Nonethe­less, the presence of other Protoclassic markers, such as nubbin and conical feet, is not clearly recorded in the ceramic descriptions of the Salama report. There is only one date from the following Uc phase. Sharer noted that its date of around cal 
A.D. 30 is later than expected, but it is consistent with cross-dating with other regions. Thus, we shift the Tol and Uc phases somewhat forward in time from Sharer's original chronology. The re­sulting sequence accords with our revised chronology of Kaminaljuyu. 
An important issue is the date of El Port6n Monument 1, which is often referred to as the oldest stela with a glyphic text in the Maya area. Sharer assigned it a date of 400 B.C. based on the radiocarbon measurement of P-2132. Federico Fahsen (2010), however, stylistically dates this monument to around 200 B .C . The date that Sharer chose was the oldest end of the common probability distribution of 400-200 B.C. that is affected by the upturn in the calibration curve . Our evaluation of the stratigraphy related to Mon­ument 1 indicates that this stela was probably erected toward the end of the Toi phase and that P-2 132 may represent somewhat old wood (Sup­plemental Text 3; Supplemental Figure 5). We think that a date of 400 B.C. for Monument 1 is highly unlikely; a more plausible date for its erec­tion is around 100 B.C. This dating is supported by other associated features. Monument 1 was placed in a wall enclosure in front of a west­facing building, and similar stela enclosures have been found at Punta de Chimino near Ceibal and at Tak'alikAb'aj, in both cases dating to the Pro­toclassic to Early Classic period (Bachand 2006; Schieber de Lavarreda and Orrego 2010). Such stela enclosures probably began to be used during the Protoclassic period. 
In addition, Burial 2-which is better de­scribed as a cache with a decapitated skull , and represents a probable dedicatory offering made at the time of the erection of Monument I -con­tained ceramic vessels and stone spheres. Similar caches containing ceramic vessels and stone spheres were also found in front of Monument 2, a possible altar paired with Monument 1. The ce­ramics contained in the oldest one, Cache 8A, date to the Uc phase, and those in the later ones, Caches 8B, 8C, and 9, to the beginning of the Quej phase. Comparable caches are found in Pro­toclassic contexts at other sites. The initial de­posits in the aforementioned "ofrendas masivas" at Tak'alik Ab'aj were made at the time of the placement of Altar 46 and Ste la 13, and were fol­lowed by sequential deposits in relatively short intervals (Schieber de Lavarreda and Orrego 2010). Although Sharer assumed the existence of a substantial time gap between the placement of Monument 1 and the dedications of these caches, these deposits were most likely made soon after the erection of the stela. This reasoning also implies that Monument I was set at the end of the Toi phase.

Chixoy River Valley: La Lagunita 
The area was investigated by the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique of France from 1972 through 1982. An important focus of this work was the regional center of La Lagunita. The French researchers dated the ceramic phases as follows: Santizo I from 900-600 B.C., Santizo 2 from 600-300 B.C., Noguta l from 300-200 B.C., Noguta 2 from 200 B.C. -A.D. 100, Lililla 1-2 from A.D. 100-300, and Lililla 3 from A.D. 300-400 (Ichon and Arnauld 1985; lchon and Viel 1984). Most radiocarbon dates taken from La Lagunita concern the Lililla phase (Supple­mental Figure 6; Supplemental Table I). Radio­carbon dates from other sites in the region lack clear descriptions of associated ceramics , and they are not included in our study. 
Santizo l ceramics at La Lagunita can be cor­related with Las Charcas through the sharing of red-on-buff zoned bichromes. The lowest layers at La Lagunita contain Orfeo Orange with glossy/waxy slips, which is closely related to Nicapa Orange of the Escalera/Enub phase in the Grijalva River region of Chiapas and to Juventud Red and Tierra Mojada Resist of the Mamom sphere in the Maya Lowlands. Thus, in terms of ceramic cross-dating, there is no clear evidence for sedentary occupation with ceramics before 700 B.C. in this region. The common presence of wide horizontally everted rims in Orfeo Orange aligns the Santizo 2 phase with the Francesa/Foko phase of the Grijalva region. Trovador White with white paste and labial/medial flanges related to the Xue ware ties Noguta I with Providencia. Characteristic Utatlan Bichrome is also shared by contemporary phases of other regions. The contents of the Noguta 2 and Lililla 1 complexes are not very clear, but the former appears to be aligned with Verbena and the latter with Arenal and Santa Clara. Cache 524, found in Structure A-7, was placed in Lililla 1 and contained a plate with large mammiform tetrapods. 
Elite burial S-2, uncovered in Structure A-7, appears to be cut from a Lililla 1 level. The burial appears to predate Cache 524 stratigraphically and may date to the early part of the Protoclassic. A radiocarbon date from this burial, Gif-4231, exhibits a wide probability distribution from cal 
A.D. 1 to 400, but it is not inconsistent with its early Protoclassic placement. The burial goods are characterized by plates with large horizontally everted effigy rims and effigy labial flanges . These vessel shapes can be tied to those of the Istmo/Ix phase in the Grijalva River region dis­cussed below. Similar vessels are also found in other parts of the Southern Maya Area during the early Protoclassic. 
The evaluation of other radiocarbon dates and of the chronology of Lililla 2 and 3 is not easy because of some internal inconsistencies. For ex­ample, discrepancies among radiocarbon dates from Tomb C-44 may have resulted from multiple reentries into this feature. The tomb contained cylinder vases with slab feet related to Teotihua­can ceramics, as well as polychrome bowls with basal flanges. Thus, it can be dated to around 
A.D. 400-500, contemporaneous with the Esper­anza phase of Kaminaljuyu. These vessels fully belong to the Early Classic period. 
Five out of the six radiocarbon dates taken from the artificial cave C-48 show ranges around cal A.D. 400-500. The presence of Teotihuacan­related vessels in this cave accords with these ra­diocarbon dates . Nevertheless, Ixcanrio Poly­chrome ceramics with bulbous mammiform supports , also present in this cave , occur in the Maya Lowlands around A.D. 200. We suspect that this artificial cave was reentered multiple times over a long period and that ceramics from different phases accumulated. Ixcanrio Polychrome and other Protoclassic markers are apparently absent in Tomb C-44-a fact that supports this interpre­tation. In an influential paper on Protoclassic ce­ramics, Brady et al. (1998:34) cite these radiocar­bon measurements from La Lagunita as "the most secure 'hard date"' to argue that these Protoclassic elements continued until after A.D. 400. This claim needs to be reconsidered. All other late Pro­toclassic dates that Brady et al. cite fall around 
A.D. 250. Ceramic sequences from various parts of the Maya Lowlands suggest that Ixcanrio Poly­chrome, bulbous mammiform supports, and other Protoclassic elements disappear around A.D. 300, following a short period of coexistence with poly­chrome bowls with basal flanges. 
Alain Ichon and Marie-Charlotte Arnauld ( 1985) correlate Lililla 1 and 2 with the later part of Demarest and Sharer 's Miraflores ceramic sphere, that is, the Arenal and Late Caynac

phases. We suspect that the chronology of the Lililla phase is in need of some revision. Although a large part of the Lililla 1 phase may be corre­lated with the Arenal phase, large mammiform tetrapods on monochrome vessels seem to occur toward the end of this phase, which may thus be correlated with the Santa Clara phase. If so, Lililla 2-with the possible introduction of Ixcanrio Polychrome-postdates the Miraflores sphere and should be aligned with the Aurora phase of Kam­inaljuyu and the Vee phase of Chalchuapa. The specific contents of the Lililla 2 complex remain to be defined. The following phase is most likely fully Early Classic. Lililla 3, then, may not be a valid phase, based on the mixed Protoclassic and Early Classic ceramics of Cave C-48 . This revi­sion implies that the N oguta 2 and Lililla 1-2 phases of the Chixoy Valley are closely aligned with the Protoclassic phases of other regions. 
Grijalva River Region of Chiapas and Jzapa 
Numerous sites in the Grijalva River region of Chiapas have been excavated by the New World Archaeological Foundation (NWAF), and the ce­ramic sequence of the area is fairly well estab­lished. Nonetheless, full descriptions of a ceramic sequence have been published only for the Upper Grijalva River region, and our discussion relies primarily on this publication (Bryant et al. 2005)
. 
Izapa, located on the Pacific piedmont and known for numerous monuments, was also investigated by the NW AF from 1961 through 1965 (Lowe et al. 1982). The original report presents only cur­sory descriptions of excavation results and ce­ramics, but recent monographs add important de­tails (Clark and Lee 2013; Lowe et al. 2013; Navarrete 20 13). It is expected that ongoing re­search by Robert Rosenswig will provide addi­tional important information. 
During the early Middle Preclassic period, the ceramic affinities between Kaminaljuyu and Chi­apas are not clear. During the late Middle Pre­classic, the Late Las Charcas phase is aligned with the Enub phase of the Upper Grijalva River region and with the Escalon phase of Izapa through the sharing of blotchy/cloudy orange re­sist vessels and three-pronged censers (Bryant et al. 2005). Three-pronged censers appear earlier in the central part of the Grijalva River region. During the Francesa/Foko phase of the Grijalva River region, plates with wide horizontally everted rims become prevalent. Similar forms ap­pear in the Frontera phase at Izapa, in the Mamom-Chicanel transition in the lowlands, the Santizo 2 phase in the Chixoy Valley, the Toi phase in the Salama Valley, and the early Nil phase at Tak' alik Ab' aj, but they are nearly absent at Kaminaljuyu. 
The transition to the following Guanacaste/ Guajil phase is marked by the collapse of Grijalva centers , most likely tied to the fall of La Venta on the Gulf Coast (Clark and Hansen 2001). NWAF researchers suggest that there was strong influence, or even migrations of people, from the Maya Lowlands to Chiapas during the Gua­nacaste/Guajil phase. Sierra Red, a type charac­teristic of the Maya Lowlands, became common in this phase (Bryant et al. 2005). Wide horizon­tally everted rims nearly disappeared and labial/medial flanges became in vogue. This, along with the presence of Utatlan Zoned Bichrome, ties this phase to Providencia and re­lated phases. The following Horcones/Hun phase of the Grijalva River region can be correlated with Verbena and other early Protoclassic phases through nubbin and conical feet, gancho rims, and pseudo-Usulutan decoration . The Istmo/Ix phase can be placed in the late Protoclassic along­side Arena! and Santa Clara because of the pres­ence of large tetrapods. During this period, ac­cording to the NWAF scholars , Lowland Maya influence retreated, and wide horizontally everted rims and effigy rims returned (Bryant et al. 2005) . The Tabil Black Incised variety of this period shows close similarities to Kaminaljuyu Black­Brown in terms of surface treatment, fine incised motifs, and vessel shapes. 
The Guillen phase at Izapa requires careful evaluation. This was the time of most impressive construction activities at Izapa, and most of its carved monuments are assumed to belong to this period. NWAF researchers align this phase with the Guanacaste/Guajil phase of the Grijalva River region, dated to around 300-100 B .C. But Guillen ceramics are characterized by plates/dishes with wide horizontally everted rims, some of them in effigy forms. These ceramics may be better cor­related with Istmo/Ix materials, although NWAF scholars may have reasoned that at Izapa, where there was no noticeable Lowland Maya influence,

the tradition of wide everted rims continued from the Frontera phase. 
Other lines of evidence may support the dating of the Guillen phase to the early Protoclassic. For example, the Izapa report places inner-handle censers in the Frontera and early Guillen phases. These characteristic censers are found in Cache 
l7 of the Uc phase at El Port6n and in Burial 13 of the Early Caynac phase at Chalchuapa (Lowe 1965; Lowe andAgrinier 1960; Sharer 1978:Fig­ure 36m; Sharer and Sedat 1987:Plate 3.35dd4). In addition, spiked censers appear to date to the Guillen phase. Spiked censers are characteristic vessels that spread through the lowlands and some parts of the highlands during the early Protoclas­sic period. In the Upper Grijalva River region, spiked censers, called Yalmus Composite, are ap­parently confined to the Hun phase (Bryant et al. 2005). Yet the Guillen phase appears to lack clear Protoclassic markers such as nubbin feet, gancho rims, and Usulutan vessels (Clark and Cheetham 2005). Possible exceptions come from Burial 30E-1, which contained vessels with nubbin feet and a spiked censer and was dated to the Fron­tera-Guillen transition (Lowe et al. 1982). Nonetheless, the stratigraphic position of this bur­ial is not clear, and it may date to the beginning of the Hato phase. 
The analysis of radiocarbon dates from Izapa remains inconclusive partly because of the am­biguity in their stratigraphic contexts (Supple­mental Figure 7; Supplemental Table 1). The Bayesian model leaves substantial uncertainty, with the start date of the Guillen phase ranging between 300-IOO B.C. Thus, the Guillen phase is extremely difficult to date and needs further examination. If the Guillen phase actually dates to the early Protoclassic period, this would imply that Izapa was not left unscathed by the social upheaval tied to the collapse of La Venta and the Grijalva centers. Construction activities may not have fully resumed until the Hun-corresponding phase. As Clark and Pye (2000) have noted, some of the Izapa monuments, particularly round sculp­tures, may be earlier than the Guillen phase, but bas-relief monuments with depictions of rulers may date to after JOO B.C. Alternatively, if the traditional placement of the Guillen phase be­tween 300-IOO B.C. is correct, Izapa may have been a unique southern center that escaped the political turmoil of that time. This placement may explain its unique ceramic sequence that defies cross-dating with other regions. In this case, bas­relief monuments at Izapa that lack glyphic texts may represent a bridge between the Olmec-style carvings predating 400 B.C. and the Maya style stelae of Kaminaljuyu, Tak'alik Ab'aj, and other southern sites, which we now date to after 100 
B.C. (see Coe 1957, 1965). 
Maya Lowlands 
The ceramic chronology of the Maya Lowlands is well established, so we will not review all of the relevant radiocarbon dates. Important se­quences with significant numbers of radiocarbon dates include those of Tikal and Cuello (Culbert 1993; Hammond 1991; Kosakowsky 1987). Re­search at Ceibal by Inomata and his colleagues has obtained more than 70 radiocarbon dates, confirming the validity of the existing lowland sequences and adding further refinements (lno­mata et al. 2013). 

The correlation of the Kaminaljuyu sequence with the chronology of the Maya Lowlands during the early Middle Preclassic period is ambiguous (Andrews 1990). Certain traits, including small horizontally everted rims and applique fillets, vaguely connect them. Some modes and types de­serve special attention. White/cream vessels with a horizontal red band on the rim and vertical red bands are present during the Late Tok phase of Chalchuapa and the Early Las Charcas phase of Kaminaljuyu. Similar ceramics are absent in most parts of the lowlands, but Tower Hill Red on Cream of the Bladen phase (850-600 B.C.) at Cuello shows a close resemplance (Kosakowsky 1987). Pattern-burnish decorations present during the Late Xox phase of the Salama Valley and in Middle Preclassic Honduras are shared by Patchchacan Pattern-burnished in the Swasey phase at Cuello and by Yotolin Pattern-burnished in the northern lowlands (Joyce and Henderson 2001). In com­parison to those Belizean materials, Real ceramics at Ceibal show closer association with the pottery of the Grijalva River region of Chiapas. 
During the Late Las Charcas phase, the ce­ramic connection between Kaminaljuyu and the Maya Lowlands becomes clearer. Some vessels from Kaminaljuyu are nearly identical to Juven­tud Red, Pital Cream, and Tierra Mojada Orange

Resist of the lowlands. During the Providencia and Chicanel/Cantutse phases, typological con­nections weaken substantially, but the common use of labial and medial flanges links these re­gions. Important finds from the Chicane! period include a glyph block and elaborate murals from San Bartolo (Saturno et al. 2006). Our Bayesian model suggests that the former dates to 360-200 


B .C. and the latter to 200-80 B .C. (Supplemental Figure 8; Supplemental Table 1). According to our chronological revision, the San Bartolo glyph block is placed earlier than El Port6n Monument 1 and most other bas-relief sculptures at Kami­naljuyu and Tak'alikAb'aj. The San Baitolo data hint at the process of development of a writing system and an artistic tradition before they were commonly applied to stone monuments. 
For the early Protoclassic Verbena and Xate 1 phases, nubbin feet and hollow conical feet serve as temporal markers shared by Kaminaljuyu and the lowlands (Brady et al. 1998). Characteristic Verbena types, including Verbena White and Kaminaljuyu Black-Brown, are essentially absent in the lowlands. Rare exceptions include Kami­naljuyu Black-Brown vessels with fine post-slip incisions found in Tikal Burials 85 and 167, which are among the earliest royal tombs in the lowlands dating to the Cauac phase. Shook noted that the vessels found in Burial 85 are somewhat different from the Black-Brown ware of Kaminaljuyu (Culbert 1993). They may have been imported from other parts of the highlands. These pieces provide direct evidence for the contemporaneity of the lowland tombs with the Verbena tombs, as well as for elite interaction between the lowlands and highlands. 
Synthesis of Chronological Data 
The reevaluation of radiocarbon dates associated with Kaminaljuyu and with other regions, as well as ceramic cross-dating, consistently indicate the need for a substantial revision of the Kaminaljuyu chronology. We propose the following Preclassic chronology for Kaminaljuyu: Las Charcas 800­350 B.C.; Providencia 350-100 B.C.; Verbena 100 B.C.-A.D. 50; Arenal AD. 50-150; and Santa ClaraA.D. 150-250 (Figure 2). The sequences of Tak'alik Ab'aj and other sites that are linked to the Kaminaljuyu chronology also need to be mod­ified accordingly. Although some scholars have suggested that the Preclassic portion of the Shook­Popenoe de Hatch chronology needs to be shifted forward in time (Kaplan 2011; Love 2002a), a more substantial revision is necessary. The entire Providencia phase needs to be shifted from the Middle Preclassic to the Late Preclassic period. 
The presence of sedentary occupation with ce­ramic use prior to 800 B .C. at Kaminaljuyu is a vexing problem. Radiocarbon dates associated with Arevalo ceramics and ceramic cross-dating do not support the placement of the Arevalo phase in the Early Preclassic . Arevalo ceramics from Mound C-III-10 contain a significant number of Arevalo Red jars with necks and composite sil­houette bowls (Shook and Popenoe de Hatch 1999). Early Preclassic ceramic assemblages in southern Mesoamerica are dominated by teco­mates, and utilitarian jars with necks are nearly absent (Blake et al. 1995; Clark and Cheetham 2005; Coe and Flannery 1967; von Nagy 2003). The ceramic report from the Upper Grijalva River region shows a small quantity of short-necked bowls in the Early Preclassic period, but necked jars do not become common until the Middle Pre­classic after 1000 B.C. (Bryant et al. 2005). In terms of plate/bowl shapes, Early Preclassic ones almost exclusively have flat bases, and composite silhouette bowls do not appear until the Middle Preclassic. They do not become notable compo­nents of ceramic assemblages in southern Mesoamerica until 800 B.C. (Clark and Cheetham 2005; Love 2002b; Rosenswig 2010; von Nagy 2003). The fill of Mound C-III-10 consisted largely of Arevalo ceramics, but 19 percent of its ceramics were of the Las Charcas complex (Kid­der 1961; Shook and Popenoe de Hatch 1999) . In his examination of this collection, Raul Ortiz identified Late Las Charcas types , including blotchy orange resist vessels. This pattern strongly indicates that the Arevalo complex , or at least its dominant and defining type , Arevalo Red, is later than Late Las Charcas. Thus, Las Charcas types in the C-III-10 fill represent older materials that were mixed with later pottery. 
Some researchers have assumed that certain ceramics found in the Las Charcas collections, including red-rimmed tecomates and zoned-punc­tuated tecomates, date to the Early Preclassic pe­riod. Nonetheless, red-rimmed tecomates were

used throughout the Early and Middle Preclassic periods in southern Mesoamerica and they do not serve as a good temporal marker unless combined with more specific attributes. Zoned-punctated tecomates are present in various Middle Preclassic complexes, including Duende from Izapa, Late Xox from the Salama Valley, and Colos from Chalchuapa (Clark and Cheetham 2005; Sharer 1978; Sharer and Sedat 1987). Thus, they are most likely components of the Middle Preclassic Las Charcas complex. 
The placement of Arevalo materials after Las Charcas, as originally suspected by Kidder and Shook, does not deny the possibility of an earlier ceramic occupation at Kaminaljuyu. John Clark (Clark and Cheetham 2002) notes that he identi­fied Early Preclassic ceramics resembling Jocotal materials from the Pacific Coast in Popenoe de Hatch's excavations near Lake Miraflores and in excavations at Piedra Parada. At best, Early Pre­classic sedentary occupation in the Kaminaljuyu area appears to have been fairly small. When this early complex is defined with the full publication of its contents and contexts, it will probably be appropriate to give it a name other than Arevalo. 
The situation of the Salama Valley is similar. Sharer noted that Early Xox assemblages, which he dated to the Early Preclassic, are dominated by tecomates and flat-based bowls, some with dentate and rocker stamping, but also include necked jars, composite silhouette bowls, and tall conical supports . The presence of necked jars and composite silhouette bowls hints at the possibility that these materials date to the Middle Preclassic. Tecomates with tall conical supports are charac­teristic of the Early Preclassic Ocos phase on the Pacific Coast, but similar vessels are common during the Las Charcas phase at Naranjo. Illus­trations of dentate stamping are reminiscent of zoned punctuations discussed above, and this dec­orative mode may have been present during the Middle Preclassic. A potentially important indi­cator of their Early Preclassic date is the rocker stamping. This mode is characteristic of the Early Preclassic period on the Pacific and Gulf Coast, and it disappears or becomes rare during the Mid­dle Preclassic in many parts of southern Mesoamerica. Nevertheless, at La Venta on the Gulf Coast, these decorations continue into the Middle Preclassic. Thus, an Early Preclassic oc­cupation in the Salama Valley is possible, but ev­idence is still tenuous. We tentatively date the Xox phase to roughly 1100-700 B.C. 
The end of the Las Charcas phase around 350 
B .C. is suggested by Beta-141170 from Urias and Beta-217153 from Naranjo, as well as by P-2139 from the Salama Valley. Y-384, M-1257, and Y­390 from the Carnegie Project may also support this dating, although these dates obtained in the 1950s and 1960s are less reliable. Radiocarbon dates recently obtained from the Kaminaljuyu Park and Miraflores II excavations point to the transition from Providencia to Verbena around 50 B.C., which is generally consistent with dates from older projects. This date, however, needs to be further examined with more radiocarbon mea­surements . For now, we conservatively place this transition around 100 B.C., but we note the pos­sibility that this temporal placement may be shifted further forward in time with more data. The date of the transition from Verbena to Arena! is obscured by the similarities in ceramics in these phases. Considering Beta-361803 and Beta­307567 from the Kaminaljuyu Park, combined with the Penn State and MTS dates and cross­dating data, we place it around A.D. 50. 
Important issues are the dates of Tombs 1 and 2 found in Kaminaljuyu Mound E-III-3 . This large building underwent a series of renovations, which the excavators named Structures 1 through 7. The fill of Structure 2 contained a large quantity of Providencia ceramics with a small portion of Ver­bena materials mixed in. It was placed at the be­ginning of the Verbena phase. Tomb 1 was located in Structure 5 and Tomb 2 in Structure 6. The subsequent Structure 7 dates to the Arena! phase (Shook and Kidder 1952). This sequence indicates that Tomb 1 was constructed during the late part of Verbena and Tomb 2 at the end of Verbena or during the transition to Arenal. We place these tombs around A.D. 1-50. Y-377 from the Carnegie excavation appears to date Tomb 1 correctly. The probable end date for the Arena! phase around AD. 150 marks the decline of Kaminaljuyu. 
Our chronological revision places another type of feature-caches containing ceramic vessels and stone spheres-consistently in the Protoclas­sic period. These deposits include Verbena-Arena! caches from La Palangana of Kaminaljuyu, Ruth­phase "ofrendas masivas" from Tak'alik Ab'aj,

Burial 2 at the end of the Tol phase and Caches 8A, 8B, and 8C of the Uc and Quej phases at El Port6n, Lililla-phase Cave C-48 from La Lagu­nita, Horcones-and Istmo-phase caches from Chiapa de Corzo, as well as Maya Lowland ex­amples of a Terminal K'atabche' -phase "Triadic cache" from K'axob, Protoclassic Ofrenda 8 from Nakum, and a niche in Structure H-XVI at Uax­actun (Cheek 1977; Gotting 2011 ; Hicks and Ro­saire 1960; Ichon andArnauld 1985; Lowe 1962; Lowe and Agrinier 1960; McAnany 2004; Sharer and Sedat 1987; Schieber de Lavarreda 2002; Schieber de Lavarreda and Orrego 2010). At Ceibal, a series of caches with numerous ceramic vessels and stone spheres found in front of Struc­ture A-10 were dated to the beginning of the Xate 2 phase, around A.D. 50 (Inomata et al. 2010). It appears that this type of cache spread over a wide area in a relatively short time span during the Protoclassic period. 
Implications of the Chronological Revision 
This revision has important implications for our understanding of social processes in the Maya area: (1) centers in the Southern Maya Area suf­fered a significant political disruption around 400 B .C.; and (2) the major development of political centralization with well-established rulership and the stela cult occurred roughly contemporane­ously in the Southern Maya Area and in the Maya Low lands after 100 B .C . Full discussion of these issues must be deferred to future publications, but we consider it appropriate to summarize here the potential implications of our chronology. 
Our revised chronology indicates that substan­tial social change took place around 400 B.C. across southern Mesoamerica. This change may be called the Middle Preclassic collapse. The erection of monuments at Naranjo, Tak' alik Ab' aj, and other centers in the Southern Maya Area prior to 400 B .C . probably reflects elite interaction across wide areas, including the Gulf Coast center of La Venta. Around 400 B.C., La Venta and many of the centers in the Grijalva region of Chi­apas collapsed (Clark and Hansen 2001). Accord­ing to the Shook-Popenoe de Hatch chronology, the Southern Maya Area was hardly affected by this change. Kaminaljuyu and Tak'alikAb'aj con­tinued to develop into their heyday, and their monument style transitioned smoothly to so­called Maya-style carvings. Our chronological revision, however, suggests that we need to fun­damentally modify this view. The Southern Maya Area did not escape the political turmoil at the end of the Middle Preclassic period. 
In the Kaminaljuyu area, Naranjo was nearly abandoned probably around 350 B.C., which sig­nals a substantial political disruption. Poorly un­derstood Arevalo ceramics may date to around this time and may reflect intrusions of new pop­ulations associated with a social upheaval . Pop­ulation levels in the greater Kaminaljuyu area may have declined. Core data from Lake Amati­tlan , located 15 km to the south of Kaminaljuyu, show signs of substantial forest clearing and soil erosion during the Middle Preclassic period, fol­lowed by a substantial reduction in erosion and forest recovery after 400 B .C. (Velez et al. 2011). Although Velez et al. interpret this pattern as lo­calized conditions in the Amatitlan Valley, the data may better reflect a broader demographic trend in the greater Kaminaljuyu area. Strong sig­nals of erosion and deforestation return after 100 B.C., which corresponds with the Verbena-Arena! florescence of Kaminaljuyu. This interpretation may contradict the view held by Pennsylvania State University researchers that there was con­tinuous population growth in the Valley of Guatemala from the Middle Preclassic to the Classic period (Murdy 1984). The Penn State re­gional settlement data, however, were based pri­marily on now-discredited obsidian hydration dating (Anovitz et al. 1999; Braswell 1992), in combination with ceramic dates when possible. The demographic and environmental trajectories of the greater Kaminaljuyu area need to be further examined with more reliable dating methods. The fall of Naranjo possibly caused a disruption in the process of political centralization. Construc­tion activities may have resumed at some point during the Providencia phase, leading to explosive growth during the Verbena period. The demo­graphic and environmental trajectories of the greater Kaminaljuyu area need to be further ex­amined with a more refined chronology. 
The shift in carving styles at Tak'alik Ab'aj and other centers was probably not so continuous and gradual as previously thought. So-called Maya-style monuments that were traditionally

dated to 400 or 300 B.C.-including Altar 48 of Tak'alik Ab'aj, with four glyphs, and El Port6n Monument 1, with glyphs-may date to 100 B.C. or later, although some ambiguities still remain. If so , there may have been a disruption in the tra­dition of monument erection in the Southern Maya Area between the probable cessation of Olmec-style carving around 400 B.C. and the possible emergence of Maya-style sculpture around 100 B .C. The specific inventory of mon­uments dating to 400-100 B .C. is not clear. The only monuments that seem to date to the 400­100 B .C. span are the so-called "potbelly" statues (Demarest et al. 1982). These rather crude looking carvings may not have been exclusively tied to centralized political power (Guernsey 2010; Love 2010). The dating oflzapa monuments continues to be a difficult problem. They may date to 300­
100 B.C. and may represent a bridge between the Olmec-style and Maya-style carving (Coe 1957, 1961). Alternatively, they may date after 100 B.C. and be contemporaneous with the Maya­style stelae of other southern sites. The sequence of monumental carvings in the Southern Maya Area needs to be critically reevaluated in light of the proposed chronological revision. 
Multiple lines of evidence indicate that the development of political centralization with well­established rulership occurred roughly contem­poraneously in the Southern Maya Area and in the Maya Lowlands after 100 B.C., during the period called the Terminal Preclassic or Proto­classic. The major tombs of the Kaminaljuyti E­III-3 mound are most likely contemporaneous with the first royal tombs at Tikal and other low­land centers . Most of the Maya-style monuments depicting rulers at Kaminaljuyti, Tak'alik Ab'aj, and other southern centers were probably carved during the Protoclassic period (Parsons 1986), although the chronological position of Izapa mon­uments remains unclear. Likewise, there is no uncontested evidence for carved monuments from the Maya Lowlands prior to 100 B.C. (Bachand 2006; Hammond 1991), although the data from San Bartolo indicate that the development of a writing system and other political symbols was well underway in the lowlands before 100 B.C. (Saturno et al. 2006). This revision implies that the development of highly centralized polities in the Maya Lowlands cannot be explained in terms of one-directional influence from the south . 
Debates on Preclassic social processes in Mesoamerica have always oscillated between two poles: one arguing for one-directional influ­ence from precocious political centers or regions (Clark and Pye 2000; Diehl 2004; Gifford 1976; Kaplan 20 11) and the other proposing mutual stimuli, or lattices of interaction, among multiple entities (Demarest 1986, 1989; Hammond 1989; Love 2011). Our position is that no single model adequately describes the entirety of Preclassic social processes. Instead of assuming an overar­ching pattern, we need to carefully trace ever­changing social dynamics. In some periods, dif­ferences in political power among regions may have shaped social processes significantly, whereas in other cases, lattice patterns of inter­action or local factors may have predominated. Chronology is key for accomplishing this task (Demarest 2009, 2011; Inomata et al. 2013). Our interpretations of social processes need to be based on a sound understanding of the temporal orders and contemporaneity of events among dif­ferent regions. Debates on social processes will certainly continue, but, at the very least, a chronological revision of this magnitude should force researchers to seriously rethink conven­tional interpretations. 
In this paper we have attempted to present the most accurate chronology given the currently available data. At the same time, we should point out that the current data set is far from satisfac­tory. More ceramic data, their adequate publica­tion, and radiocarbon dates are badly needed. Our proposed chronology needs to be tested and re­vised with new data. We should also emphasize that our chronological revision does not detract from the importance of the Carnegie excavation of Kaminaljuyti, which should continue to be re­spected and honored as a monumental achieve­ment of American archaeology. Subsequent work by Shook and Popenoe de Hatch has made un­paralleled contributions to the archaeology of the southern Maya region. Our revision is also based on that work. It is the responsibility of modern researchers, who can benefit from more reliable dating techniques and other technological means, to advance what pioneering scholars started.
