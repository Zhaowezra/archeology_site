As stated by both the editors and the discussant, JoelPalka,thisvolumerepresentsatimelyadditioninEnglishto a little understood but major Mesoamerican culture.It will certainly mark a before and after for the non­Spanish reading audience. It clearly states how the“Huasteca” must be understood primarily as a coastalregion,tothenortheastofMexicoCity,alwaysinhabitedby a variety of linguistic groups, agriculturalist andnomads, that were in contact with their Mesoamericanneighbors both from the South (Gulf and Maya) andfrom the central Mexican highlands, as well as with thenorthern highlands and southeastern United States. Italso makes clear how it must be separated, analytically,fromtheHuastec,Wastekan,orTeneek(Mayan)speakersthat may or may not have been present in the region fora long part of the culture sequence.
Theintroductionbytheeditorssummarizesboththehistory of research and the major notions developedaround the Huasteca, emphasizing that, culturally, theregionalwaysmaintainedadistinctcharacter.Theobjec­tives stated are threefold (p. 6): to understand theHuastecainintra­andinterregionalcontext,toinvestigatecontinuityandchangefromthePreclassictotheColonialperiods, and to counter the misconception that theHuastecawasisolatedorperipheral.Theauthorsachievethis using an interdisciplinary approach, including con­tributions from archaeologists active in Huastec fieldarchaeology (Ahuja, Alarcón, Zaragoza, Dávila) andiconography(Faust,Richter),aswellasagronomistandsocialanthropologistRuvalcaba;therestofthe contrib­utorsarearthistorians(Koontz,Wyllie),aswellasotherspecialists:Taube(iconographer),Houston(epigrapher),Robertson (linguist), and Palka (archaeologist).
The first chapter, by John Robertson and StephenHouston,addressesthe longstandingdebateonwhetherthe Mayan speakers arrived in the Huasteca very early(in the Preclassic) or quite late (Postclassic or later). 
Refuting the early Maya Gulf coast continuum model,theypositthepossibilityofaLateClassiccoastalmove­mentfromSouthtoNorth,basedonlinguisticsimilaritieswith Western Mayan Tzeltal/Ch’olan.

A.D. 100–500 and the recent reevaluations that some ceramic diagnostics, like Prisco Negro, may not be asearly as originally thought. This could suggest that thesite had the disrupted sequence common in the region,with a long sequence culminating in a Late Preclassicapogee, followed by a near abandonment, occupationresuming in the Late Classic and Early Postclassic withNorth Central Veracruz and Maya connections, laterreplaced by the distinctive Late Postclassic Huastecassemblage.

Every student of Maya archaeology learns that archae­ologicalresearchatthesiteofTikal,Guatemala,helpedrevolutionizearchaeologyinthe1950sand1960s.Tikalbecame a test case for innovation in the archaeology ofsettlement patterns, environmental interaction, andurbanism. It is rewarding that Tikal once again is thecenter of innovation in archaeology. David Lentz,Nicholas Dunning, and Vernon Scarborough’s editedvolume Tikal: Paleoecology of an Ancient Maya Cityrepresents an outstanding contribution to the social sci­ences and providesa serious example of effectiveinter­disciplinary research in archaeology.
