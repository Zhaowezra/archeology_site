CUEVA HUENUL 1 ARCHAEOLOGICAL SITE, NORTHWESTERN 

PATAGONIA, ARGENTINA: INITIAL COLONIZATION AND 
MID-HOLOCENE DEMOGRAPHIC RETRACTION 

Ramiro Barberena 
In this paper I present an intensively dated chrono-stratigraphic sequence for the Cueva Huenul I archaeological site, Neuquen Province, Argentina. Located in the inland deserts of northwestern Patagonia, Cueva Huenul I offers a remarkable temporal record of events for a largely unstudied desert region. I connect this local record with available data on a macro­regional scale to reassess (1) the timing of the first human colonization of the area and its implications for explaining the extinction of megafauna (ca. I4,000-!0,000 cal B.P.) and (2) the decrease in human occupation recorded in several South American deserts during parts of the mid-Holocene (ca. 8000-6000 cal B.P.). The data presented here show a gap of about 1,500 calendar years between the extinction of megafauna and the appearance of humans. A review of evidence from the northern Patagonia and southern Cuyo regions is consistent with this record, favoring ecological causes for regional extinction of megafaunal taxa. Integration of this record with those indicating the earliest human presence in South America (e.g., Monte Verde, Chile) is consistent with a process of human radiation to the inland Patagonian deserts from nodes of initial occupation. The chrono-stratigraphic sequence from Cueva Huenul I also contributes to an assessment of a trough in human occupation along the South American Arid Diagonal around 8000-6000 cal B .P. Evidence for a decrease in occu­pational intensity during this period is found in the highland and lowland deserts in Mendoza and San Juan. the Puna region in northwestern Argentina, the Atacama Desert in Chile, and possibly the Pampean region. Previous researchers have sug­gested that persistent arid conditions would have produced increasing landscape fragmentation, particularly affecting desert areas. A more specific understanding of the demographic processes underlying this archaeological signal is needed. In this paper I suggest that this trough reflects not only spatial and social rearrangements, but also a macro-regional demo­graphic retraction. This could have caused a population bottleneck with lasting biological and cultural implications. 
En este trabajo presento la secuencia crono-estratigrafica def sitio arqueologico Cueva Huenul 1 ( Provincia del Neuquen, Argentina), la cual ha sido datada en forma intensiva. El sitio se emplaza en el desierto del noroeste de Patagonia y presenta un registro excepcional de eventos historicos para una region escasamente estudiada. Vinculo este registro con la informacion disponible en una escala macro-regional y reanalizo (a) la fecha de la primer presencia humana y sus imp/icancias para la extincion de la megafauna (-14000-10000 aiios cal a.P.); y (b) la disminucion en la intensidad de la seiial arqueologica regis­trada en multiples desiertos de Sudamerica en partes del Holoceno media (-8000-6000 aiios cal a.P.). Los datos revelan un hiato de -1500 aiios calendaricos entre la primera presencia humana y la ultima presencia de megafauna. Una revision de la evidencia disponible para el norte de Patagonia y el sur de Cuyo es consistente con este registro local.favoreciendo una causa ecologica para la extincion de la megafauna. La integracion de este registro con aquellos que reflejan la ocupacion mas temprana de Sudamerica (v.g. localidad Monte Verde) sugiere un proceso de radiacion humana desde los nodos de colonizacion inicial a ambientes marginales de Patagonia. La secuencia crono-estratigr6fica de Cueva Huenul 1 tambien contribuye a una evaluacion de la disminucion ocupacional registrada en torno a 8000-6000 aiios cal a.P. Este registro abarca desiertos de altura y planicies bajas de las Provincias de Mendoza y San Juan en Cuyo, la Puna en el noroeste de Argentina, el desierto de Atacama en Chile, a los cuales se suma el posible caso de la region pampeana. Diversos investigadores han propuesto que condiciones 6ridas persistentes habrfan producido un proceso de fragmentacion del paisaje que afecto a areas deserticas en particular. Actualmente, se requiere un analisis mas espec(fico de los procesos demograficos que subyacen esta seiial arque­ologica macro-regional. Aquf sugiero que esta disminucion en la intensidad de la seiial arqueologica refleja no solo una reor­ganiz.acion espacial, sino tambien una retraccion demografica, que podr(a haber conducido a un cue/lo de botella poblacional con importantes consecuencias biologicas y culturales.

landscapes and the extinction of megafauna (Barnosky and Lindsey 2010; Borrero 2008; Dillehay 2008). Although relatively little is known about these topics, a recently published corpus of information is producing new perspec­tives and challenges (see papers in Bueno et al. [2013]). Multiple South American deserts also show evidence of decreased human occupation during parts of the mid-Holocene (8000-6000 cal B .P.; Gros jean et al. 2007; Mendez et al. 2015; Yacobaccio 2013). Contrasting suggestions on the causes and social implications of this record have been put forth, although we still need a better understanding of the underlying macro­demographic processes. 
In this paper I present an intensively dated chrono-stratigraphic sequence for the Cueva Huenul 1 archaeological site, Neuquen Province, Argentina. Located in the inland desert of north­western Patagonia, Cueva Huenul 1 offers a re­markable temporal record of events for a largely unstudied region. I connect this local record with available data in order to reassess these demo­graphic problems and suggest new scenarios for

The Andean mountain range is a high and rela­tively continuous topographic feature that disrupts patterns of atmospheric circulation, directly im­pacting South American climate and ecology (Gar­reaud 2009). In the southernAndes (35-53° S), climate is controlled by the westerly winds, pro­ducing a remarkable rain-shadow effect. The west­ern Andean forests receive more than 2000 mm annually, but the eastern steppes and shrub-steppes of Patagonia receive less than 300 mm (Paez et al. 2004). In contrast, at the tropical and subtrop­ical latitudes north of 30° S , arid conditions prevail along the Pacific coast and extend into the western slopes of the Andes, while warm humid conditions associated with atmospheric circulation from the Atlantic Ocean prevail over the eastern slopes. These combined rain-shadow effects produce the South American Arid Diagonal, a continental ge­ologic-climatic feature including desert and semi­desert ecosystems (Figure 1).

The Cueva Huenul 1 site (hereafter CHl; 36° 57' S, 69° 49' W; 1,000 m asl) is located in a desert environment within the Monte phytogeographical Province, a scrubby formation typical of northern Patagonian deserts (Abraham et al. 2009; Paez et al. 2004). This region is ecologically sensitive for two reasons: (I) it is located in the transition zone between Pacific-dominated precipitation to the south and Atlantic-dominated precipitation to the north (Garreaud 2009), and (2) it is close to the western limit of the Monte Desert at this latitude. These transitional conditions make it a sensitive spot for tracking paleoecological change through the Late Quaternary. 
CHl is a large cave formed by erosion of the contact between ignimbrites of the Tilhue Forma­tion at the bottom and basalts of El Puente For­mation on top (Figure 2). A stable microenviron­ment with predominantly dry conditions within the cave has allowed for excellent preservation of organic materials. Argentinean archaeologist Jorge Fernandez tested CHl in 1978, obtaining a 14C age of 11,150 ± 230 B.P. for a sample of unknown composition and provenience (Cordero et al. 2002). The presence of late Pleistocene deposits and signs of recent human impact suggested that further sampling would be useful for exploring early human colonization of Patagonia (Barberena et al. 2010). 
Excavations were conducted in two sectors of the cave in order to assess stratigraphic variation (Figure 2). Three quadrats of 2 x 1 m (Al, Cl, and Dl) were placed in the deepest zone of the cave, where the upper deposits were better pre­served, reaching a maximum depth of 1.4 m (2.8 m3 of excavated volume). Test pit Bl (1 x I m) was placed closer to the mouth of the cave and reached a maximum depth of .95 m (.95 m3). Un­derlying bedrock was exposed in both cases. We present here a chronological and stratigraphic study of the two excavation areas, although de­tailed quantification of the materials is only pre­sented for Quadrat A 1 .

Methods 
The excavation was carried out in 10-cm artificial JeveJs and all natural sedimentary layers were differentiated. Temporal components were de­fined on the basis of stratigraphic and chrono­logical criteria, and hiatus were recorded on the basis of stratigraphic unconfonnities and temporal breaks in the sequence. 
Radiocarbon dates were processed at the Na­tional Science Foundation AMS Laboratory, Uni­versity of Arizona. The ages were calibrated in OxCal 4.2 using the SHl 3 curve (Hogg et al. 2013) and were graphed with the probability sum command in OxCal (Bronk Ramsey 2009). Un­less otherwise indicated, all ages discussed are in calibrated calendar years B.P. 
Results Chrono-stratigraphy 
The sequence in Quadrats A I , Cl, and DI is com­posed of eight stratigraphic units defined in the field, and organized in three temporal components (Figure 3). Stratigraphic Units VIII through V (excavation Levels 14-6) have high percentages­up to five percent-of organic matter in a matrix composed of fine sediment. These units make up the basal Component l . The organic content con­sists largely of macro-remains of shrubby plants. Embedded in the matrix, a large number of very 
well preserved coprolites were recorded. Their size and morphology indicate that they correspond to small carnivores and the megafaunal taxon Pilosa (see Martinez et al. 2010), which includes herbivores such as ground sloths. Two dates were obtained for coprolite samples from Units VII and V, producing bracketing median ages of 16,695 and 13,631 cal B.P. These dates bracket Compo­nent l (Table 1). The top of these units is delimited by a distinguishable erosional unconformity re­ferred to as Hiatus 1(Figure3). Two distinct tephra layers were recorded within Component 1. Geo­chemical analyses by Charles R. Stern (University of Colorado Boulder) indicate that they would correspond to the local Tromen volcano (Barber­ena et al. 2015a). 
In direct contact with the unconformity comes stratigraphic Unit IV, including Levels 4-5, which were about 20 cm thick. These levels are defined as Component 2. They are different from the lay­ers making up Component I in terms of sedi­mentary texture, color, and composition, and do not include coprolite-derived organic matter (Bar-
