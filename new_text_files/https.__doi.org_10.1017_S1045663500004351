HYDRAULICS, CACAO, AND COMPLEX DEVELOPMENTS AT 
PRECLASSIC CHOCOLA, GUATEMALA: 
EVIDENCE AND IMPLICATIONS 

Jonathan Kaplan 
Investigations begun in 2003 and continued through 2005 at Chocola, in Southwestern Guatemala, have determined the existence of an extensive Preclassic network of well-engineered subterranean canals, The hydraulics discovered at the site, 
as well as other.findings, add to long-standing evidence of Preclassic developments in the site's immediate region. While I consider an impressive Preclassic hydraulic system proven for Chocola, a similarly early industry of cacao-a high-water demand plant of pan-Mesoamerican importance and native to the region-is discussed here admittedly only as a plausible h,1pothesis, based on copious ethnohistoric attestation but also on the long-known but disparate evidence of a temporal pri­ority to many developments considered key to later Classic Maya civilization that are found in the Southern Maya area. 
Las investigaciones realizadas en Chocola, en el Suroeste Guatemalteco, dieron inicio en 2003 y continuaron hasta el 2005, determinando la existencia de un extenso sistema hidraulico de buena manufactura que consiste en canales que funcionaron tanto suhterrdneamente como en la superficie. Este sistema, }unto a otros hallazgos aporta a la evidencia de! alto y temprano desarrollo en la regi6n inmediata de la Bocacosta. Nuestros descubrimientos parecen confirmar el importante y temprano papel de! area Maya de! Sur en la trayectoria Maya. El impresionante sistema hidraulico de Chocold ha sido documentado arque­o/6gicamente. Nuestra busqueda de una industria preclasica de/ cacao permanece como una hip6tesis valida, dado el poten­cial que aporta el sistema hidraulico como generador de desarrollos considerados esenciales para la civilizaci6n Maya Clasica, cuyos antecedentes han sido documentados en el area Maya def Sur. 

he ChocolaArchaeological Project (PACH) 
Tis a long-term research undertaking whose principal goals are: (I) to fill in significant gaps in the culture history of the Southern Maya area, 1 especially in the Preclassic period; and (2) to seek data permitting analysis of the emergence of key high traits of Maya civilization in the South­ern Maya area (Figure I) (Kaplan and Valdes 2004; Kaplan et al. 2004). These latter include hiero­glyphic writing, urban entities, great trade systems, the Maya calendar, and core Maya ideology. Following an account of the site and its context and history, this report summarizes our evidence for a hydraulic system that extends at least 1.5 km north to south; this system both skirts around and runs within edifices in apparent administrative and elite residential precincts. Third, I focus on the pos­sibility of a major cacao industry that developed at and around Chocola and that could have constituted a material substructure for some of the high Pre­classic developments long known for the Southern Maya area. 
The Chocola site is located at the upper edge of the piedmont of Guatemala, extending 500--1000 m HAE (Height Above Ellipsoid), in a triangle formed at the north by two diverging rivers, the Chocola and Chichoy (Figure 2). Originally, at least I 00 mounds (Shook, personal communication, 1992; cf. Burkitt 1930), representing administra­tive edifices, platforms, and other structures, com­prised the site. The terraces supported both elite and commoner dwellings in what was part of an early Late Preclassic (400-200 B.C.) stratified society. Other important structures were built close to the numerous rivers and streams running through the site. 
Chocola 's piedmont settlement ecology, size, early rise, longevity, and the scale of the hydraulic system justify comparisons with Tak'alik Ab'aj, located 35 km to the southwest (Popenoe de Hatch

et al. 2000). Similar to Tak' alik Ab' aj, the ancient city rests on a series of ascending natural terraces (cf. Schieber de Lavarreda and Orrego Corzo 200la, 200lb, 2001c, 200ld). Both sites are large, ca. 6-12 km2. Ceramics at both sites indicate dense occupations from 800 B.C. through the Preclassic Period. Tak' alikAb' aj possessed canals or drainage systems (Marroquin 2005) whose construction is extremely similar to those of Chocola. The simi­larity of the systems at the two sites suggests a shared development during the Middle and Late Preclassic periods (900 B.C.-A.D. 200) that involved conceivably extensive control of corpo­rate labor. 
Chocola as well as Tak'alik Ab'aj may have mediated trade from an ethnohistorically attested breadbasket and center of commerce with far-flung networks and trading partners. Underlying these Preclassic developments, surplus cultivation of cacao may have been particularly important. While it remains for us to demonstrate that an ethnohis­torically described role characterized the Preclas­sic period as well, early colonial sources testify uniformly to the high quality and great amount of cacao grown in the immediate area (Bergmann 
1969). 
Entry into Chocola today is unremarkable except for the large Mound 1 (Figure 3), visible to the left as one passes houses and a multitude of evangelical churches. Further into town, another landmark is a German-built aqueduct that fed a giant turbine producing electricity from the bow­els of the coffee mill. A German-built machine shop still functions partially, using aqueduct-borne gravity-flow water to generate electricity for giant Pelton wheels linked with oversize canvas belts. powering saws, presses, drills, and other industrial machinery. Adjacent to the machine shop is a vir­tual "living museum" of postcolonial coffee pro­cessing, the relic of a giant system of exploitation

dissected piedmont of pastures and successional forest. An abundance of water exists-from 3 m of rain per annum, many fast-flowing, high-discharge rivers and streams, and many natural springs, often emanating from caves (Guerra and Ishihara, in Kaplan and Ugarte Rivera 2006). This superabun­dance probably inspired communal efforts to pro­tect the public buildings and elite structures from fiercely erosive flows and unwelcome pooling that would have occurred. Both removal of excess and diversion of water for specific practical uses were engineered; undoubtedly, other functions were real­ized, e.g., religious. Because the dry season lasts six months, it is also reasonable to assume that excess rainy season waters were retained and used to irrigate agricultural fields, although we have no evidence of this as yet. 
Two great natural resources, volcanically enriched soils and abundant water, therefore can be presumed as reasons early settlers established a community at Chocola. In addition, views are afforded on clear days to the Pacific Ocean 50 km to the south; this location and vantage provided both strategic and ideological power. Strategic power could be asserted because of the city's ample defensive perspective of the pastures and plains below the community. Based on its size and longevity, Chocola may have been a significant stopping point or nexus in the trade route linking Pacific coastal centers and K'aminaljuyu; ceramic analysis by Popenoe de Hatch (in Kaplan and Ugarte Rivera 2006) indicates that goods passed from and through Chocola to the highlands around and beyond Lake Atitlan, connecting Chocola with the Valley of Guatemala and other areas at some distance. The two centers ofChocola and Tak'alik Ab'aj perhaps formed the core of one regional sys­tem while K' aminaljuyu was at the core ofanother. It seems plausible to hypothesize that Chocola and Tak' alik Ab' aj supplied K' aminaljuyu with cacao, while K'aminaljuyu reciprocated with obsidian. 
Ideological power similarly seems likely to have come from the location of the site. The dramatic volcanic range visible immediately to the north may have represented "flower mountains" (Scar­borough 2003; Taube 2004); as mentioned, natural springs emanate from caves, still used today by shamans and practitioners of magic. Because a vis­itor would need to climb several hundred m from the southwest to pass through the center of Chocola, each tiring step would have brought him closer to what must, by Late Preclassic times, have appeared to be an impressive sacred center, backed up against the volcanoes, with very large (20 m or higher) pyramidal buildings in the administrative core. Ongoing archaeoastronomical research suggests the profound possibility that one of the factors anciently important in situating the site was a dis­tinctive eastern horizon with dramatic peaks and clefts; a solar horizon calendar-tentatively iden­tifying an early count from Chocola Mound 1 of both 260-and 360-day periods and, hence, a pos­sible origin of key aspects of the Maya calendar­could have permitted ancient astronomers and rulers primordially in the Mesoamerican trajectory to establish a tight correlation between the orien­tation of specific edifices and the cosmic order (Green 2007). 
Previous Archaeology at Chocola and 
Summary of Present Research 

Karl Sapper visited Chocola in the 1890s, noting that it was a large archaeological site ( 1897). In the 1920s, Robert Burkitt excavated two mounds (1930). His mission for the University of Pennsyl­vania Museum was to obtain antiquities for the Museum's collection; his most important acquisi­tion was the fragmented Monument I (Jones 1986, Paredes Umafia 2005) that is closely related styl­istically and thematically to K'aminaljuyu Stela 10, an enormous throne (Kaplan 1995, 2000, 2002a). In the 1930s Franz Termer, working at nearby Palo Gordo, visited Chocola and, like those before him, noted the site's importance (Termer

1973:51). Edwin Shook visited Chocola many times from the 1940s on (Shook, personal com­munication, 1992), counting 100 mounds; in 1945, he formally registered the site with the Guatemalan Institute of Anthropology and History, and later undertook test excavations at one mound. No archaeology was undertaken then until the work of PACH, which began in 2003 with a five-year con­venio from the Guatemalan Ministry of Culture. 
When German agribusiness arrived at Chocola in 1891, many stone monuments were found dis­persed around the site, which were moved to a small park at the edge of a central plateau with a commanding view to the south. Undoubtedly many whole ceramic vessels, figurines, and other artifacts were found. A diaspora of ancient Chocola's mon­uments, ceramics, and art continued beyond the departure of the Germans; older town residents informed us that in 1982, the last government man­ager of the great farm that constituted the agribusi­ness absconded with the farm trucks and carried away several monuments. 
By the end of PACH's 2005 field season, sur­veys indicated that mounds and dense surface remains extended at least 6 km north-south by 1.5 km east-west. Ceramic evidence indicates Chocola was occupied continuously from the Middle Pre­classic through to the beginning of the Early Clas­sic, from ca. 800 B.C. to AD 400, although some possible Oc6s phase ceramics suggest an occupa­tion dating conceivably from as early as 1200 B.C. (Popenoe de Hatch, personal communication, 2006). 14C dates from strata descending in the same pit, within an elite structure, yielded a range from 500 B.C. to A.D. 20 (Tables 1 and 2), with the ear­liest date derived from samples recovered from the deepest level, more than 20 cm below which was a cobble-walled small channel that connected to an extensive network of water control outside the edi­fice. Evidence is scant of a Late Classic occupa­tion, at least in the areas excavated thus far, comprised principally of an apparently intrusive cache of whole vessels deposited beneath the north­east corner of Structure 7-1, a possible palace or administrative building. 
To date we have located and/or recorded 30 carved monuments (Figure 4a, b, c, d, e, f), a count that would be expanded significantly if many "cupule" monuments3 were included. Before our project, only two sculptures were known from Chocola, Monument 1 and a stela fragment known only from a photograph in a Harvard collection. In each of the four great mounds thus far investigated (two platform and two pyramidal) we have found well-constructed edifices, all employing the same basic technology of densely aligned large, often reshaped cobbles framing, supporting, and sup­ported by earthen fill. These structures include a 6­x-12-m elite house or spring house (a structure built around a natural spring) located at the top of a plat­form mound; two much larger apparent residences, one whose east wall (the part of the structure exca­vated) extends 24 m, the other, whose partially excavated south wall extends at least 14 m and is associated with an unusual example of a "potbelly" sculpture (Figure 4c, d); and a 40-x-45-m cobble

Water Management in Chocola 
Because of the possibility that modem water sys­tems piggybacked onto ancient ones, drawing on interviews with current and past officials of the sev­eral water committees and tours of the water sys­tem, an ethnographical study was undertaken in 2005 (Kraemer, in Kaplan and Ugarte Rivera 2006). Natural springs are the primary source of potable water for the town, most (nine) emerging from north of Chocola between the Chocola and Chichoy rivers. With German ownership of the giant coffee and sugar plantation coming in 1891, a water sys­tem for the finca and coffee mill was installed; the system consisted of dams, concrete tanks or cajas serving as intermediate control mechanisms into which flowed water from the various natural springs, and large subterranean metal tubing; breathers were located strategically to allow air to escape from the tubing that otherwise would impede flow. Tomas (trenches) above rivers and elevated aqueducts also delivered water to various destinations and for various functions, domestic and industrial, for example, to provide a source of energy to power the coffee processing and machine shop.

ily copious and clockwork-regular afternoon rains. The Preclassic builders of the site must have had to deal in some energetic and resourceful manner with this great natural force that otherwise would quickly erode and destroy houses and other struc­tures. In our third test pit-on the large platform Mound 15-we discovered the first of several sub­terranean cobble drains and, from that time onward, ancient hydraulics became an important focus of the project. Exploring further but still adhering to systematic test-pitting rather than intensive exca­vations of stmctures, we found evidence of other canals, in the plaza north of the large pyramidal Mound 9, some JOO m south of the first one found in Mound 15, and in the road cut through the west­ern quarter of Mound 15. 
In 2004, the canals on Mound 15 were excavated more systematically (Paredes er al. 2005), reveal­ing a stone-capped artery passing just to the east of Stmcture I5-1, the latter a 6-x-12-m edifice with a small cobble channel passing from a central well within the stmcture out to the larger conduit (Fig­ure 6). Excavations followed the course of the larger canal 34 m to the south and which included a bifur­cation ca. 15 m south of the structure. Although there were clear indications that the main artery continued further south, lack of time required us to halt excavations and begin backfilling. The func­tion of Structure 15-1 remains unclear; possibili­ties include elite residence or spring house (Scarborough, personal communication, 2004 ), or both. The structure contains cobble-defined cham­bers that, although small in size, could have accom­modated domestic life; a gradually descending stepped patio is oriented due east; a possible "annex" to the structure was found in 2005, although another possibility is that this represents an entirely separate edifice. Whole pots as part of ritual offerings were found. In 2004, a large Late Preclassic olla was found almost precisely in the center of Structure 15-1 with five large cobbles placed carefully above it; these cobbles may rep­resent the five directions (Juan Antonio Valdes, per­sonal communication, 2004) and/or the four Chaaks plus a center. In 2005, more whole vessels-coma/es (domestic griddles)-were dis­covered, also interred intact, in the "annex." 
In 2004, an emergency operation discovered more evidence of the canal system, when PACH learned that excavations by one of the town's water committees was repairing a PVC tube that deliv­ered water from one of the many natural springs found north of the town. Examination of a trench revealed another subterranean cobble-constructed

water conduit that the workers had been at the point of removing to permit passage of their plastic tub­ing. Remarkably, the PVC tubing was being placed directly through the cobbles of the ancient drain. This conduit is located approximately 1.5 km to the south of the canals on Mounds 9 and 15, indicat­ing the large scale of the ancient water system. 
In 2005 we continued investigating the canal system on Mound 15 and found a series of con­duits, including a second large canal that connected into Structure 15-1 through its south wall. Evidence was found for the possible borrowing of cobbles from apparently older canals, indicating repair and/or improvement to the system. Surface recon­naissance located additional extensions of the 
Mound 15 system in the bed of the modem dirt road that cuts through the western quarter ofMound 15, and which appear to continue west through the opposite road cut, and at the edge of a modem milpa north of the mound; as mentioned, in 2003 in the eastern road cut, after clearing and cleaning the debris and plant growth, we found profiles or cross-sections of more conduits and architecture. Figure 7 shows in schematic form the plan view of the Mound 15 system as presently known (and not showing the conduits within Structure 15-1 ); it does not include the unexcavated canals whose remains are visible in the road bed to the west and those found in a modern water trench to the north of Structure 15-1. 
In 2005, while excavating what I believe was a palace structure, Structure 7-1, we discovered a well-constructed subterranean canal that passes beneath or through the base of an eastern-facing wall with stairway and piers. A cache of at least 13 whole vessels was found beneath the northeast cor­ner of the eastern wall-the only part of the struc­ture we could excavate fully. While excavating the cache, torrential rains forced us to halt our work in the pits and trenches; even with constant bailing, we faced the possibility of a collapse of the cob­bles. The rapid filling of this pit beneath the north-

east corner of the structure may have occurred because of an inadvertent cut into an intramound conduit, perhaps the same one that we found extended out from the south corner of the east fac;ade, and which was directing flows immediately into our pits. 
The Mound 15 System 
Thus far the canals and conduits in Mound 15 con­stitute the most completely investigated example of Chocola's Preclassic hydraulic system. Mound 15 is a large low platform located ca. 100 m west of the deep ravine of the Chocola River; current evi­dence suggests there are several structures on this platform. As mentioned, Structure 15-1 represents either a small elite house and/or a spring house. A small channel within Structure 15-1 connects to a cobble-walled dried well or cistern, in the latter which was found a whole pot with handles. Par­ticularly noteworthy about Mound 15 is the direct association of the structure with its small channel that leads to the cobble conduits laid to the east and south of the structure. In 2004 we discovered both the large size of the main canal passing just to the east of Structure 15-1 and the smaller tributary within the structure. Discoveries in 2005 deter­mined that another outlet and/or inflow from a canal existed immediately to the south of the small chan­nel in Structure 15-1. Some 20 m north of Struc­ture 15-1, in a trench dug for modern water control delivery purposes, we found evidence of more con­duits profiled in the trench. Future research should attempt to locate the intake point from springs undoubtedly lying further north, and also to find the cajas or redistributive boxes, which must have existed in order to redirect and distribute water to various destinations and for different functions. Our informants showed us the modem collection and redistribution boxes north of the town, and explained how these were maintained. 
Engineering and Construction 
Techniques of the Canals 
At least three distinct construction designs were employed in the engineering of the system: (1) subterranean-entirely cobble-enclosed, with large flat stones or lajas capping it; (2) surface-the bot­tom and two sides constructed of cobbles; (3) surface-cobbles only on the two sides (not shown) (Figure 7a, b, c, d, e). Measuring from the outside 
of the cobbles, the average dimensions of the largest canals found thus far are ca .. 75-x-.75 m, with the interior flow space ca .. 25 x .25 .33 x .33 m. Other engineering decisions included bifurcations of one canal into two, two canals joining to one, and one canal lying above another and depositing water through an opening into the lower one. A ferrous clay material, taxcal, found naturally in great abun­dance at Chocola (and at Tak'alik Ab'aj), was observed intentionally placed in the interstices of . the cobbles as well as on the beds of the drains, : providing an effective sealant or mortar. Evidence of the success of this technology was manifest from the sandy and loose, easily cleared soil found within the drains. 
Dating 
Evidence to date Chocola's hydraulics derives from 
seven charcoal samples recovered from Strata 3 
and 4, the first five samples from descending lev­
els within the same pit, located near the center of 
Structure 15-1, two more taken from a pit one meter 
to the east (Tables 1 and 2). Excavation was under­
taken by arbitrary 20-cm levels except when fea­
tures were encountered. 
Analysis of these dates is guided by the fact that 
all fall within similar ranges. It seems reasonable 
to conclude that the structure itself was built ca. 
350--150 B.C., with the earlier end of the range 
more likely-perhaps 300 B.C.-because of the 
apparent older date for the small channel which, 
presumably, based on the apparent fact that all strata 
within the pit, as elsewhere within the structure, rep­
resent different construction phases, was built 
organically, i.e., as part of what later became the 
residence/spring house-canal complex. However, 
these assertions require discussion. 
The small channel lay at least 20 cm below the 
level from which the apparently oldest and deep­
est dated sample was taken. This would indicate 
that the small channel is older than the structure; 
no evidence was found of intrusive digging. Fur­
thermore, the first four samples have almost the 
same earliest range date, which averages to 382 
B.C. The fifth sample, from the deepest level, has two intercepts, 500--460 B.C. and 430 B.C.-AD 20. Considering the stratigraphy and our difficulty at times in distinguishing between Strata 3 and 4, I must allow for the possibility that the time frame for both Strata 3 and 4---i.e., for the early con-

struction phases of the structure and, even, con­ceivably, of the canal-is fourth-second century 
B.C. However, Stratum 4 does not continue down to the canal; another stratum (7), possibly a con­struction cap, lies just above the canal. If the lower level dates to ca. 500 B.C. (Late Middle Preclas­sic) and the upper level dates to somewhere between 350-150 B.C. (Late Preclassic ), one might expect to see some changes in associated ceramic materials between the two levels. However, ceramic analysis is not yet able to determine conclusively the relative date for the ceramics recovered from the two strata from which the carbon samples were taken; preliminary analysis assigns the ceramics from both strata as well as deeper levels reaching to the canal to the Late Preclassic. No ceramics dat­ing to later than the Preclassic have been identified that are associated with the canals (Popenoe de Hatch, in Kaplan and Ugarte Rivera 2006). 
Given the location of the structure­immediately above the canal and the well -it seems reasonable to conclude that the conduit was built with the overlying structure in mind, albeit as part of the earliest construction phase of the struc­ture and which must have been repaired and/or modified through the second half of the second century B.C. or later. The fundamental consistency of the dates of the four samples recovered from higher or shallower levels suggests that the con­struction matrix, and the canal, were contemporary and also were undisturbed after the first century 
B.C. 
Therefore, it seems plausible that the small channel and, likely, as well, the much larger arter­ies it connected to that lie outside the structure, were constructed within the same fourth-second-century 

B.C. 
range. However, given the earlier intercept for the level lying more than 20 cm above the canal, it is also possible that the construction of the canal within the structure as well as of the associated canals outside of it falls early in this range and, con­ceivably, dates to the Late Middle Preclassic. 


More Evidence of the System within the 
Presumed Administrative Nucleus of the Ancient City 
After the 2005 field season ended, cultural ministry inspectors placed test pits for town residents who wanted to build new houses and evangelical churches. Behind one house, more evidence was found of the water control system 1.5 km to the south of the canals on Mounds 9 and 15. Taken together, our evidence is consistent with interpre­tations from elsewhere that corporate decisions were made in order to ensure that the water con­trol system functioned effectively and reliably. The northern location of this canal system also suggests social stratification through control of flows of water from the major sources, as well as the cleanest-which would fit with our tentative divi­sion of the site into northern elite residences, cen­tral administrative districts, and southern commoner population homes and workshops. 
Cacao and Coffee: 
Ancient History, Ethnohistory 
and Modern Context 

Early and later Post-Conquest ethnohistory attests that Soconusco, Mexico and Suchitepequez and Escuintla, Guatemala were great centers for the production of cacao, a high water-demand plant (Acuna 1982:25-60; Carrasco 1982:89-95; Fuentes y Guzman 1932-1933 IX:l7, 61, 91; Gage 1958; Gasco 1993, 1996, 2003; Gasco and Voorhies 1989; McBryde 1947:33-34, 92; Parsons 1967:13; Recinos 1984:79-94). The Late Classic art style of the Cotzumalguapan culture (Chinchilla 2002, 2006) that manifested in the piedmont combines decapitation and cacao among other themes. As is proposed here, this suggests the enduring economic power of cacao that saw emergence in the Preclas­sic and underlay the imposing Preclassic polities of the southern piedmont (Kaplan 2005a, 2005b, 2005c). The same ethnohistory records very dense populations at the time of the Conquest and fierce fighting between various caciques for control of cacao in the area of the Achi, where today one finds Mazatenango, Cuyotenango, Zapotitlan, San Anto­nio, and Samayac, all attested by ethnohistory to have been significant centers of cacao production and trade, and all clustered very closely around the ancient city of Chocola. While such ethnohistoric information cannot be relied on as direct evidence to characterize the Late Middle Preclassic, it seems reasonable to use these data as a guide for what one could look for, including evidence of large-scale exchange, most plausibly, of obsidian for cacao. More precise bridging arguments must be made to connect such apparently profound material sub­strates to cultural innovations. However, consider-

ing that the three earliest Long Count dated Maya 
texts are found in the Southern area, at Tak'alik 
Ab' aj and El Baul, both very near to Chocola, that 
apparently even earlier writing is found in the South 
(K' aminaljuyu, El Port6n, Chalchuapa), that 
arguably the earliest Maya urban entities arose first 
in the South, and that the ruler-stela cult seems also 
to have originated in the South as well, the tempo­
ral priority of developments in the southern Maya 
area leading to Classic Maya civilization seems 
bolstered. Because of dynamic interactions, peace­
ful and hostile, other types of culturally and socially 
complex developments would have occurred­
providing, in theory, a materialist and analytic 
approach to better understand the developments in 
the Southern area before such high traits appeared 
elsewhere. 
Immediately after the Conquest, and attesting 
further to the cacao wealth of the region, the Span­
ish" ... increased the output [of cacao] under ter­
rific pressure and at great cost of native lives" 
(McBryde 1947:33). Encomiendas in the region 
continued with their own cacao enterprises until 
postcolonial economic forces found cheaper labor 
and other production costs elsewhere. Circa 1850, 
a new cash-crop for export, coffee-present in 
Soconusco by 1783 (McBryde 1947:92)-had 
become a great postcolonial Liberalist enterprise 
in Guatemala, and has remained there since. 
Discussion: Precolumbian Commerce, 
Mythology, and Cacao in the 
Southern Maya Zone 

I suggest that the initial catalyst for the invention of Chocola's hydraulics must have been to manage very copious rains in order to avoid erosive dam­age to houses and other structures (cf. Marcus 2006). However, I believe that, fairly quickly, removing and diverting excess water away from buildings changed to ingenious positive and proac­tive hydraulics-long a traditional theme in pre­history as trigger and indicator of social complexity-to take advantage of a resource, superabundant in Chocola.4 The apparent wealth and size of the city from Middle Preclassic through Late Preclassic times--exemplified by Structure 7­1, an edifice with a 24-m east wall with stairway, piers, and apibna or tuj (sweatbath), and by Struc­ture 5-1, a40-x-45-m cobble platform located three 
km to the south of the former structure-indicate 
that sharp social stratification was in place proba­
bly no later than the beginning of the Late Pre­
classic.5 
The early development and large size of the 
Southern area centers, including K'aminaljuyu, 
Tak'alik Ab'aj, and Chocola, indicate that power­
ful material substrates may have been initiating 
factors behind high cultural and social develop­
ments precedent to Classic Maya civilization, and 
certainly within the context of the culturally and . 

linguistically still little understood area encom­
passing Southern Chiapas, Mexico, Southern/West­
ern Guatemala, e.g., the Guatemalan Pacific coast, 
Piedmont, and Highlands, Western Honduras, and 
Northern/Western El Salvador in the Preclassic. 
McBryde observed that, "[ t ]here is no region in the 
New World that surpasses western Guatemala for 
illustrating direct relations between culture and 
nature" (1947:2). Evidence of great commercial 
activity in the Southern area is found amply in the 
Guatemalan highlands and particularly at K'ami­
naljuyu, with its long-assumed control of a vast 
obsidian trade. 
While Chocola developed an impressive hydraulic system, as did other nearby piedmont centers, large scale Preclassic cacao cultivation here admittedly is hypothesized. I believe the hypothe­sis is reasonable, however, based on: (1) the exis­tence today of remnant cacao groves in and around Chocola, indicating that ideal soil and other eco­logical conditions are found in the region for the plant (cf. Gomez-Pompa et al. 1990:248-250); (2) attestation by current growers that as recently as ten years ago cacao was grown at and near Chocola in abundance; (3) ethnohistory documenting that the piedmont area from Soconusco in the west to Escuintla in the east was a profoundly important cacao-producing area-Central Mexico, in Aztec times, 1,000 km distant, imported cacao beans, and in great quantity, from this region; ( 4) cacao residue found in vessels in Belize dating conceivably to 600 
B.C. (Powis et al. 2002). This said, extensive palaeobotanical and other studies must be carried out to support the hypothesis of surplus cultivation of cacao in the Preclassic South. 
Further support for the hypothesis of Preclassic cultivation of cacao at Chocola and in its region derives from the high demand for cacao in Maya and other Mesoamerican civilizations in cuisine

and as sumptuary consumable. The signal impor­tance of cacao was such that it may have been a central part of Maya mythology-Vucub Hunahpu, uncle of the Hero Twins and the brother of Hun Hunahpu, the maize god (Taube, 1985, 1992, 1996) conceivably was the cacao god (Grofe 2005). At risk of oversimplification I must consider the pos­sibility of a central and vital role for cacao trade from Chocola and other proposed "kingdoms of chocolate," such as Izapa and Tak'alik Ab'aj, in originary events and processes, including devel­opment toward Maya writing, the calendar, urban entities, kingship and court life, great art styles, and a profound and elaborate ideology explaining the cosmos to the satisfaction of a great ancient civi­lization. By no means is this to propose that cacao, alone, was the lever to cultural and social heights; undoubtedly, trade in other products, such as cot­ton and salt, played a role as well. However, I believe that our discovery of an impressive water control system at Chocola dating apparently to the fifth-fourth-century B.C. suggests that corporate labor and powerful elites were poised to exploit cacao, attested so strongly by ethnohistory as a great native product in the region, for surplus cul­tivation and trade. 
Conclusions 
Many questions arise as a result of our work, includ­ing: do the hydraulics extend throughout the sur­veyed ca. 5 by 2 km area of the remains? Was irrigation agriculture practiced? If cacao proves to have been an important material basis for Chocola's Preclassic emergence, how was labor organized to meet the needs of this high water-demand, spe­cialized soil matrix, arboriculture? Finally, can data from the Southern Maya area provide a funda­mentally materialist basis for a better understand­ing of the rise of the Classic Maya? 
Admittedly, this paper is part demonstrated fact-the existence of large-scale Preclassic hydraulics-and an as yet undemonstrated hypoth­esis of a Preclassic cacao industry at Chocola. The discovery from the third test pit dug at the site of a cobble-constructed subterranean water conduit and our discoveries since then of the extent, sophisti­cation, and conceivably fifth-fourth-century B.C. date for the hydraulics, do seem strongly to con­firm even at the beginning stages of our research that Chocola achieved a high level of social and cul­tural complexity quite early in the Maya trajectory, strengthening the argument for a temporal priority of such developments for the Southern Maya area in which it lies (see Kaplan 2008 for a summary of this argument). But hydraulics alone certainly can­not explain the first emergence of high traits in the South such as Long Count dated Maya texts, urban­ism, elements of the Maya calendar (Green 2007; Malmstrom 1978), and the ruler-stela cult, demon­strated at Tak'alik Ab'aj and K'aminaljuyu. The ancient breadbasket of Soconusco and Suchitepequez with the plausible corollary of great trade systems from this area, principally including, perhaps, the specialty commodity, cacao, together with the great highland obsidian trade long assumed for K'aminaljuyu, could provide a more readily testable, materialist basis for analysis of the so­called precocity of the Southern area.

Notes 
1. 
Love and Kaplan suggest defining the Southern Maya area "as a place of great cultural florescence during the Preclassic Period that saw the emergence of large cities, writ­ing, high art styles, and tremendous economic activity," adding that while it "may fit geographically within the high­lands, Bocacosta, and Pacific coast of Guatemala and south­west Chiapas, Mexico ... rather than refer to it as a geographical division of southern Mesoamerica it is better defined, like other cultural-historical entities in Mesoamerica and, like 'Mesoamerica,' itself, as a cultural time and space" (Kaplan 2002b). 

2. 
Tectonic activity is evident; frequent small earthquakes are felt in the town. 

3. 
These altar-like monuments with concavities on the surface of the stone block are found also at Tak'alik Ab'aj, often set in front of stelae. I am not including these monu­ments in the formal catalogue because they may have had purely practical functions, such as for shaping of ground stones or holding of liquids, e.g., clay slip, in ceramic manu­facture. 

4. 
Notably, elsewhere in early civilizations hydraulics is postulated to have led to or characterized higher levels of social and cultural complexity because of a scarcity of this essential resource and the need for communal labor and elites to manage this labor. Accordingly, it seems that both scarcity and superabundance of water may have been stimuli to higher levels of social and cultural complexity. See Scarborough 2003 and Marcus 2006 for excellent updatings and retheoriz­ing of ancient hydraulics. 

5. 
We have not been able yet to excavate structures within apparent commoner or lower-status areas of the site. Accordingly, in addition to obvious differences between fine ceramics found in caches as opposed to utilitarian vessel sherds found elsewhere, the assumption of an elite as well a commoner social stratum, is based on the contrast one can make between large (partially) excavated structures located in northern and central precincts and unexcavated low and small mounds found to the south.
