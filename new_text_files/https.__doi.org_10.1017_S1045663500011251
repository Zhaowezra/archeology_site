and through archaeological excavations at 21 sites in the Puren and Lumaco Valley (Chapters 4 and 5 by Dillehay). Dillehay returns to his main research ques­tions and expands upon his concepts of the teleoscopic polity in Chapter 11. In addition to the theoretical focus of this volume, it also contains descriptive chapters by Dillehay and his collaborators that present new data and analyses of environmental reconstruction (Chapter 6 by Ana M. Abarzua,Alia G. Pinchicura, Leonora Jarpa,Ale­jandra Martel-Cea, Mieke Sterken, Rodrigo Vera, and Mario Pino Q .) , mound construction (Chapter 7 by Dille­hay and SaavedraZapata),ethnobotanical remains (Chap­ter 8 by Claudia Silva Dfaz), ceramic and stone artifacts (Chapter 9 by Dillehay), settlement patterns (Chapter 10 by Dillehay, J. Paige Silcox, and Carlos Ocampo E.), radiocarbon and thermoluminesence dates (Chapter 12 by Dillehay and Silcox), carbonized botanical remains (Chapter 13 by Renee M. Bonzani), wood charcoal remains (Chapter 14 by Maria Eugenia Solari), phytoliths (Chapter 15 by Jose Iriarte), and soil samples (Chapter 16 by Oscar Segue!, Mario Pino Q., and Dillehay). 
While it is admittedly difficult to simultaneously present new data from scientific analyses and new the­oretical constructs based on multiple lines of archaeo­logical and ethnohistorical evidence, Dillehay and his colleagues should be commended for producing a vol­ume that contains both. While the raw data contained in the volume will be of interest to archaeologists with interests in the region, the volume's most significant contribution is its examination of Araucanian political processes and successful resistance to the Spanish during the Colonial period. DiJlehay's approach to polity for­mation focuses on its dynamic nature. Against the idea of a centralized, hierarchical polity, he argues that the terms composite polity and teleoscopic best describe the compartmentalized or composite geopolitical orga­nization that the Araucanian polity formed through a telescope-like extension from family/household groups to local patrilineages to larger regional alliances. The Araucanian polity, Dillehay argues, was also a patriar­chal polity focused on warriorhood and reinforced through a largely male pantheon and through patrilin­eage and patrilocality. His discussions of ethnohistorical and archaeological evidence for patrilineages and the importance of warriorhood are useful additions to larger discussions of gender in the past and will be of interest to scholars with interests in masculinity as well as polity formation. In addition, Dillehay's emphasis on the important role of ritual settings and the maintenance and display of ancestors and their associated landscapes will make this an important book for scholars interested in the role of the dead in the living, such as bioarchae­ologists and scholars interested in post-mortem agency. 
In conclusion, Dillehay has used multiple lines of archaeological and ethnohistorical evidence to explore the emergence of the Araucanian patriarchal polity in the Colonial period, providing an alternative conceptu­alization of a complex polity; with little centralized power and an unostentatious material record, the Arau­canian polity successfully resisted the Spanish empire for more than 250 years and maintained political and economic autonomy long after many indigenous groups had been incorporated into the Spanish empire. With its wide-ranging scope, this volume will be of broad interest to specialists in Andean archaeology and history, as well as scholars with interests in sophisticated theoretical approaches to state formation, colonial interactions, ethnogenesis (or ethnomorphosis, in the Araucanian case), masculinity and warriorhood, war and violence, and landscape archaeology.

In this second edition, Mary Ellen Miller and Megan E. O'Neil have crafted a succinct, yet rich and beautifully illustrated introduction to the art and architecture of the Maya. They have substantially expanded, reorganized, and augmented the ten chapters of the first edition to include intervening archaeological discoveries, current theoretical developments, and the colonial and contem­porary Maya. These changes ensure the continued impor­tance of this volume for introducing students and lay audiences to the aesthetic dimensions of Maya art and the intellectual concerns with which the field engages. 
The book is organized by media or subject matter and chronologically within each chapter. Chapter 1 pre­sents an overview of Maya art historical study, the chronological and geographical dimensions of the tra­dition, and basic themes, while Chapter 2 examines the material genres of Maya art. Chapter 3 introduces struc­tural types, the built landscape, and regional and tem­poral architectural variation. This chapter proves particularly useful for isolating key features of specific traditions and the kinds of spaces most marked in the formal vocabulary of the Maya. Chapter 4 turns to the human form and its realization in various media. Chap­ters 5-7 present a history of sculptural forms and their development from the Preclassic to the Classic periods and geographically span the southern Lowlands to the

northern Yucatan. Chapter 6 deals with regional and city specific sculptural forms, and in this way returns the reader to the unique civic styles first mentioned in Chap­ter 3. Chapter 7 discusses ceramic vessels again through the lens of regional styles. Miller's seminal work on murals informs Chapter 9 and makes for a particularly rich discussion, which includes murals recently exca­vated at San Bartolo, Calakmul, and Xultun. Chapter 10 brings the colonial and contemporary Maya into focus, even if only briefly. A chronology and glossary with illustrations conclude the volume and are a useful aid for those trying to juggle what can seem like an over­whelming amount of new information. 
As with any introductory text, there are omissions and underdeveloped areas. For example, Maya ceramic sculpture is as ancient and diverse as stone, but it is not extensively treated apart from a discussion of the dif­ferences between ceramic figurines and stone sculpture or as a possible precursor to the naturalism seen in Late Classic period sculpture (97). Ephemeral artistic genres (e.g., paper or bundles) are the least discussed, presum­ably because they can normally be viewed only through their depiction in narrative imagery. Thus, their exclu­sion apart for a few brief mentions (158) is understand­able, but it prevents the treatment of some of the most important vehicles for the presentation of Maya deities and ancestors. 
Of greater concern is that the calligraphic arts and epigraphy are underserved. Calligraphy represents a sig­nificant percentage of Maya sculpture and painting. Texts are often contiguous with the painted or sculptural image, and glyphs regularly appear within the frame­work of iconography. Like calligraphy in East Asian or Islamic art, epigrams are integral components of Maya art. Likewise, text and image relationships played a crit­ical role in Maya art and allowed the viewer to better comprehend narrative flow. For example, the scenes on the vessel illustrated in figure 196 (Kerr vessel 1398) are presented in reverse order in the narrative description from that indicated by both Rabbit's gesture towards the introductory glyph of the dedicatory inscription sur­rounding the vase's rim and the dialogue between God L and Rabbit in which God L asks Rabbit where his cloths are before he visits K'inich Ajaw (Sun God) in the next scene. This is a minor point but one that nev­ertheless is part of the incredible subtlety of Maya art. Because epigraphy is not a line of evidence with which the volume substantially engages, the reader comes away with a good awareness of the form of Maya art, but not always an equal understanding of its substance. Given the need for the book to remain focused on the art object, calligraphy and epigraphy were likely casu­alties, but for those who might wish to use the volume for instruction, this will be an area of artistic expression that will require supplemental material. 
Thus, the volume, to various degrees, privileges occi­dental genres and media. This would seem less apparent were it not for a descriptive language that occasionally reinforces this impression. For instance, in describing the naturalistic treatment of the human form in Maya art the authors state that "no other civilization in Mesoamerica came close to the achievement of the Maya in this respect, and only a few civilizations of the premodem world were their equals" (95). This statement is true enough to the extent that the Maya took a special interest in articulating the human form in a naturalistic manner, but this and similar statements reflect our own aesthetic sensibilities and goals, rather than those of the period. This descriptive language reinforces many of the assumptions about art that a lay and novice student of art history might already have. Would it not be better to spell out these differences both to indicate why, his­torically, the Maya came to be revered among Western audiences and, more importantly, to query the near verisimilitude with which the Classic Maya realized the human form? 
These relatively minor points aside, the book has proved valuable in the classroom. At the time of this writing, I am using this edition in my introductory course on Maya art precisely because it introduces current issues while providing a scaffold upon which students can build a basic understanding of Maya artistic styles and medial and subject genres. They have found the book approachable and, from class discussions, it is clear that they are able to effectively transport concepts from this volume to additional readings and to their engagement with works of art, many of which are not presented in the book. This is a great testament to the book's success. 
As Miller has so often accomplished in her work, this book successfully straddles the divide between pop­ular and scholarly literature to produce a work that con­tinues to be not only the essential introduction to the history of Maya art, but also one that addresses and raises critical questions and issues in the field of pre­columbian art history.
