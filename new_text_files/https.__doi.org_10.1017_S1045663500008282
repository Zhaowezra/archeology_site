of the area than traditionally accepted. Archaeological evidence shows that the Inka also penetrated further into the eastern lowlands than previously known. He argues that the Titicaca basin was the source of significant archi­tectural, ceramic, and cultural influence on the Inka. Frances Hayashida and Natalia Guzman examine the Inka presence on the north coast of Peru. Noting that the presence of Inka style objects tells us little about the nature of Inka control in any area, they explain that the long tradition of complex societies on the north coast allowed the Inka to appropriate existing infrastructure, such as state ceramic workshops, which then continued to produce local styles as well as Inka pottery. Inge Schjellerup focuses on Chachapoyas, on the northeastern frontier of the empire. This area of tropical rainforest was heavily impacted by the Inkas, in part because of the rich economic resources: exotic animals, feathers, coca leaf, hallucinogens, gold, and salt. Although the Chachapoya resisted the Inka, there is little evidence that the Inca resettled foreign garrisons in Chachapoyas. Tamara Bray discusses the far northern frontier of the empire, again arguing that the conquest was somewhat earlier than traditionally thought. Resistance was fierce here, as evidenced by the numerous fortifications. She discusses the pre-Inka cultures, the Inka administrative sites, and the Spanish conquest. 
In the final section of the book, TetsuyaAmino shows how perceptions of the Inka changed during the colonial and republican periods. From early characterizations as either cruel tyrants or generous rulers, the Inka came to be seen as a symbol of indigenousness and then a concept akin to a life force. 
There is duplication of general information in many chapters. At the same time, specific themes such as craft production and military organization do not have chap­ters devoted to them, but information about them is spread across several chapters. The comprehensiveness of the bibliographies is variable: some cover the main sources, while others are more extensive. Some chapters conclude with suggestions for further research. Every chapter has insights valuable to experts in the field, but the book could also serve as a selection of readings for a course on the Inka or as a coffee-table book for the public. 
Archaeology and Bioarchaeology of Population Move­ment among the Prehispanic Maya.ANDREA CU CINA, editor. 2015. Springer, New York. xiii+l59 pp. $54.99 (softcover), $39.99 (ebook) ISBN 978-3-319-10857-5.

This is a slim volume of 13 papers in which archaeolo­gists and bioarchaeologists are expected to investigate the movements of population, but which really deal more widely with population dynamics and only possible movements in several cases. This is an English version, updated, of a Spanish publication whose title gives, in my opinion, a more accurate indication of what these papers contain than the English title. In Spanish, it is bio­logical affinities and population dynamics based on mul­tiple methods that are discussed, not just movements. It appears to be the inaugural volume of Springer Briefs in Archaeology, and the articles are brief, perhaps too much so for those who are not specialists. Thus, this is not an introduction to the methods and sites, but a summary of pertinent recent studies about dynamics in the Maya area from the Preclassic to Postclassic. A main criticism is that these can be too brief and try to pack too much infor­
mation into a few printed pages. 
Once one gets beyond the misdirection of the title, there are valuable papers. In a limited review, obviously not all 13 can be discussed in any depth. The first three chapters are about the changes in trade networks and cultural influences during the Classic period that are indi­cated by chronological ceramic complexes in Xcambo, Yucatan (Sierra Sosa), Calakmul region (Dominguez Carrasco and Folan), and U sumac in ta Basin and various Gulf Coast sites (Jimenez Alvarez). Changes in ceramics do not necessarily indicate significant population move­ments, as the chapters indicate. 
The rest of the chapters are more clearly about poten­tial population movements. Calakmul is also the subject for Folan and colleagues (Chapter 4), who briefly sum­marize the rise and fall, political as well as of population, of this major Maya site. The researchers tie the history to climate stability and the ability to conserve water, which then failed in the drought aroundA.D. 800 at the end of the Terminal Classic. Making conclusions that have become more widely accepted, Rafael Cobos (Chapter 5) disputes that the history of Yucatan and Chichen Itza in the Terminal Classic and Early Postclas­sic reflected the incursions of Toltecs and Nahuatized Maya foreigners. Instead, archaeology indicates that there were no large-scale population movements, but rather changes originating with local Maya. 
Starting with Allen Ortega's Chapter 6, skeletons become the dominant evidence. Using mostly paleode­mographic evidence, without delving too deeply into its strengths and weaknesses, Ortega sets up how migration should be defined and a framework to find migratory patterns. Then there are three chapters that use dental nonmetric traits, the ASU system, to find populational continuity or possible foreigners. A look at the region using 18 skeletal samples (Cucina) finds complicated dynamics. Inland Peten clusters together, in contrast with coastal and northern populations, which show continuity from Classic to Postclassic periods. Adding dental met­rics to the nonmetrics, a distinctive elite mortuary group

at Lamanai (Wrobel and Graham) could not be clearly characterized as local or foreign. Mayapan is the focus for Serafin and colleagues, where the teeth do indicate nonlocal elites but victims of violence were local and not necessarily elites. 
Strontium isotope analyses of human skeletons pro­vide strong evidence of a nonlocal origin for adults, as diets reflect geographic location that can indicate that an individual lived in a different place as a child. Scherer and Wright consider the history of Tikal, finding that there was immigration in the Early Classic and probable outmigration at abandonment of the site in the Terminal Classic. Nonlocals were from the Guatemalan highlands, northern Yucatan, and Belize, still likely to be Maya. Price and colleagues look more generally at the Maya region, finding most dramatically European and African individuals in a Colonial cemetery. 
The last two chapters depend little on population movement. Duncan and Hageman look for intracemetery kin at lxlu, Guatemala, and found little support for the importance of biological descent for coresidence at sites, but that may be a defect of nonmetric traits. Tiesler's study of cranial shaping reveals changes in the meaning of the shapes, from local identity to a homogeneous shape with perhaps pan-Mesoamerican meaning. 
Thus, most chapters were not able to really show large-scale population movements among the prehis­panic Maya, using a variety of methods in archaeology and bioarchaeology that could reveal such movements. The Maya samples available are generally inconclusive or generally showed continuity across the region, indi­cating, as hypothesized by Wrobel and Graham and shown at Tikal, that movements were mostly among the Maya, not from far away places in Mesoamerica. It is the movements of individuals for economic or mating purposes that appear to create the patterns found archae­ologically and bioarchaeologically, which underlie the population dynamics here.

It was in the mid-I 990s when my English teacher gave me the fourth edition of Michael Coe's book The Maya, after a trip to New York.At that time, I was in secondary school and was getting deeply interested in the ancient Maya civilization. Living in a small city in Poland, such publications were impossible to acquire if you did not have friends or relatives living abroad. Before receiving Coe's book, my knowledge about the Maya was limited to what I had read in popular literature (including a book by Diiniken), in older books such as Gods, Graves and Scholars by C. W. Ceram, or in outdated publications from the 1960s by Gallenkamp. Coe's The Maya was the first specialist publication that introduced me to the world of this fascinating ancient civilization. Thames and Hudson has just released the updated ninth edition of this classic, comprising 320 pages with 213 illustra­tions and co-authored by another prominent Mayanist­Stephen Houston, professor of anthropology at Brown University. 
The book opens with an introduction to Maya culture, which provides geographic, cultural and linguistic back­ground and presents a chronology of Maya civilization. Also, Coe and Houston describe three different regions that form what we define as the Maya Area. The second chapter deals with the evidence of the earliest human occupation in the area, from the first hunter-gatherers of the Paleoindian period through the Archaic (when people started the domestication and cultivation of crops, includ­ing maize), and onward to the beginnings of the Preclas­sic, when the first densely inhabited villages and ceramics appeared. The authors inform us about the first settlement of the New World and about the timing of this process. They discuss the most important sites from the Paleoin­dian or Early Hunters period, including the recent dis­covery of the "Hoyo Negro girl," found in a now-flooded chamber of a well or cenote in northeastern Yucatan. This is a skeleton of a teenager, ca. 12,900-12,700 years old, which is the oldest human remain found in the entire Maya Area. 
Coe and Houston continue with the origins of the Preclassic Maya in the Pacific coast, highlands, and low­lands, mentioning the latest finds from Ceibal, where monumental architecture rivaling, and most probably preceding that of the Olmec capital of La Venta, was recorded. The third chapter presents the rise and growth of Maya civilization during the Late Preclassic ( 400/300 B.C.-A.D. 250), with its typical hallmarks such as masonry-vaulted architectural buildings, a sophisticated naturalistic art style expressed mainly in low-relief, and the appearance and spread of the Long Count calendar and writing. These cultural innovations and changes are best seen in northern Guatemala, especially in the Mirador Basin and its surroundings, where many large centers dotted with pyramids arose, along with the major city of El Mirador that might have been the capital of the first Lowland Maya state. Coe and Houston describe the most important Late Preclassic Maya centers with exam­ples of monumental architecture, carved monuments, and other examples of public art, complemented with information on new discoveries from sites such as El Palmar in Guatemala and El Mirador itself. A special section is devoted to the site of San Bartolo, where spec­tacular examples of wall paintings and the first examples of Maya script were discovered. The next important
