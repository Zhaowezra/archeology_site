LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 26, No. 2, 2015] 
Erratum 
The article "Dedication and Termination Rituals in Southern Moche Public Architecture" in the March 2015 issue of Latin American Antiquity incorrectly lists the author's last name in the header. The correct citation of the article is as follows: 
Gamboa, Jorge 2015 Dedication and Termination Rituals in Southern Moche Public Architecture. Latin American Antiquity 1:87-105. 
Writing, The PAR/ Journal 8(4):1-22; C. Helmke andJ. Nielsen, The Writing System of Cacaxtla, Tlaxcala, Mex­ico, 2011). 
Guerrero concludes that whether Teotihuacan had a writing system "is yet to be answered completely, as there is not a sufficient body of data to work with" (p. 68), and she repeats her hope that more data will emerge. This is a puzzling conclusion, considering the fact that Guerrero herself has decided to ignore the largest portion of data. The unambitious scope of her investigations leads her to imagine that Teotihuacan writing may have "completely differed from any other writing system in use in Mesoamerica at the time" (p. 68). Yet recent studies (not cited by Guerrero) strongly suggest that Teotihuacan writing did not behave any differently than other scripts in the central Mexican highlands (e.g., T. King and S. Gomez Chavez, Avances en el desciframiento de la escritura jeroglifica de Teotihuacan, in La costa del Golfo 
en tiempos teotihuacanos: Propuestas y perspectivas. Memoria de la Segunda Mesa Redonda de Teotihuacan, 
ed. M. E. Ruiz Gallut & P. de Soto, pp. 201-244, 2004). Moreover, in her own partial comparative analysis, Guerrero also points to similarities in the sign inventories from Classic to Postclassic times. In her words, the study serves "as an initial investigation to verify whether these glyphs may be part of a writing system in use at the site" 
(p. i). Such a statement is not readily compatible with the fact that a number of publications have already shown that there is a writing system at Teotihuacan, and it is dif­ficult to find any Mesoamerican epigrapher who will doubt this. In sum, the volume adds nothing new to Guerrero's previous book; it is not up-to-date and does not include the most recent research and data. Most importantly, and sadly, it fails to contribute to the con­tinued efforts of achieving an understanding Teotihua­can 's writing system.
