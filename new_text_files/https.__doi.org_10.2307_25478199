inland, encompassing the rich resources of the coastal wetlands but not restricted solely to them. 
Voorhies's account of her 30-year pursuit of Chan­tuto archaeology should be a standard reference for archaeologists who investigate the shellmounds and shell middens along the edges of every continent. It is a tour de force in the great range of variables brought to bear on understanding the role of these distinctive sites in the past lifeways of a coastal people. Most approaches would be equally insightful for shell-dominated sites that differ from the Chiapas features in form and function. An added bonus of the volume is an extensive compi­lation of ethnographic and ethnohistoric practices from the literature. Even more valuable are the author's first­hand observations of traditional acquisition, process­ing, transport, material culture correlates, and residues of wetland resources in Chiapas and Costa Rica. Along with techniques used for mollusks, fish, and shrimp, she reports a case of repetitive mollusk collecting in Costa Rica that is generating large piles of clam shells to cre­ate a present-day version of a shellmound. 
Coastal Collectors in the Holocene, The Chantuto People of Southwest Mexico contributes importantly to the body of knowledge about inhabitants of coastal wet­lands and hunter-gathers in general. At the same time, it tracks the intellectual odyssey of a persistent, focused scholar. Voorhies's work illustrates the benefits of sys­tematically examining, re-examining, and expanding the boundaries of an archaeological of inquiry, reject­ing preliminary conclusions when they are superceded, and sharpening arguments over time. Although sub­stantial segments of the information in the current chap­ters have been published previously, conclusions reached in the book go far beyond a compendium that incorpo­rates recent findings. The volume stands as a uniquely comprehensive treatment of Archaic developments in the Mesoamerican lowlands and the coastal shellmounds that are their most notable markers.

The stone circles of Great Britain are old, massive, and mysterious. Finding out what such displays meant has proved exceptionally difficult, in part because prehis­toric material of this sort does not lend itself to easy or persuasive interpretation. Jerry Moore's valuable book addresses a comparable example of prehistoric build­ing, in this case the monumental architecture constructed in the Andes (and adjacent coastal regions) prior to the Inka. The result is far more convincing than most work on British megaliths. A true tour de force, Moore's vol­ume offers a forward-thinking and, at its best, replica­ble package of approaches to the study of prehistoric architecture. 
Moore is a "holist" in two senses. He reasons that complex features in archaeology, such as large build­ings, require complex lines of evidence. Those data would include acoustical science, "house" notions of social organization, comparative studies of perfonnance, privacy, and religious specialization, along with Andean and Amazonian ethnography. A tool that works is a tool worth using. The main goal is to understand monu­mental architecture in a particular part of South Amer­ica, not, as with Amos Rapaport and others, to devise a universal, culturally deracinated approach to buildings. 
A second kind of holism stems from the conviction that architecture "both mirrors and shapes soi:;ial inter­action" (p. 4 ). Through links to other domains of human behavior and belief, buildings provide opportunities for investigating less-visible features of Andean antiquity, such as the kinds of religious experience (spirit posses­sion, mastery and performance of esoteric knowledge. shamanic ecstasy) that might have configured Initial period architecture of coastal Peru. These analytic modes complement a more subjective aim, to understand the past experience of large, constructed spaces. Vignettes of the author hearing music at Sacsahuaman, observing an Aymara shaman at work, following a "Tzutzuhil" L sic] procession in Guatemala, and chatting with an older woman in Chiapas, Mexico, open the chapters and remind us of the people behind buildings. 
The chapters are ingenious. The first concerns a com­parison of"soundscapes," the acoustics of human speech as reflected in the spacing of buildings and as inferred from egalitarian societies around the globe. The close­ness of huts from Archaic and Early Formative sites (La Paloma, Asana, Acha-2) points to the presence of egal­itarian societies accustomed to ready conversation with neighbors. (At each site one assumes and hopes for con­temporaneity between the huts under review.) But the pivotal chapter is the one on Initial period architecture, almost the largest constructions in the ancient world. Moore lays out the two positions and two sets of advo­cates: Shelia and Thomas Pozorski propose centralized planning and construction, and Richard Burger and Lucy Salazar-Burger favor incremental building by egalitar­ian societies inclined to the practice of shamanic trance. A typology of religious practice, taken from South American evidence assembled by Lawrence Sullivan, and a separate measure of relative permanence, ubiq­uity, and visibility in structures leave little confidence that shamanic ecstasy played a role in such meg­abuildings. In this, the Burgers' position appears, if not wishful thinking, then at least an expression of the Arna-

zonian mode of interpretation that derives ultimately from the works of the late, great, and reliably audacious Donald Lathrap. The separate question of whether the societies were centralized or egalitarian seems unde­cided, however. The likening of Kogi and Mapuche, not otherwise known for high degrees of political organi­zation, to the habitants of Huaca de los Reyes and Sechin Alto fails to make a case for centralization in the form of large-scale institutions. 
In my view, the final chapters pack less punch. The tabulation of processions, including aspects of timing, space, sound, roles, and props, suggests that proces­sions took place in the past. This is not, perhaps, a sur­prising conclusion, although readers will benefit from Moore's dissection of the spatial components of ritual. Then, in his final substantive section, Moore moves to the "house" society, now a fixture of archaeological research in much of the Americas. The intellectual bloodline is clear: first generation--Claude Levi-Strauss and his detection of houses as overt models of kinship among the Kwakiutl, Yurok, and noble families of Medieval France; second generation--relatively tardy importation to general anthropology; and, third gener­ation, on to archaeology. 
For Moore, the ciudadelas of Chan Chan, long­known as an enigmatic and relatively abundant feature of this city, are material exemplifications of elite (read ''royal") houses. They stored collective wealth, perdured over time, housed many people in ties of fictive kinship, and honored the memory of key ancestors through rit­ual. To Moore, the appearance of such compounds in the late first millennium A.D. points to a historical incep­tion for house societies at this time. The problem is that the "house" concept is a unit of identity, a self-concept. It plausibly, but not provably, expresses itself in archae­ologicaJ.evidence from prehistory. A recent, somewhat conservative application of the concept to Iberia in late prehistory lists a number of attributes, including unclear descent systems, territorial ramifications, inherited emblems of rank, none of which can be securely docu­mented in the ciudadelas of Chan Chan (Alfredo Gonzalez-Ruibal, Journal of Anthropological Archae­ology 25:146). 
Moore has written, in his own description, a book 
about how peoples of the Andes and adjacent regions 
made and experienced a sense of place. The focus is on 
final design and recurrent use, not on technologies of 
building or how structures came to be (these will need 
a separate volume, along the lines of Jean-Pierre 
Protzen' son Inka masonry, yet far more extensive). Nor 
does Moore mechanically apply ethnographic observa­
tion to past peoples. The correlations are inexact and, 
because of shifts from imperial societies to rural, peas­
ant ones, thin or invalid. He works instead through spe­
cific arguments, tailored to problems at hand, and remains sensitive to dimensions of experience (sound, religious passages, movement, identity) that sit outside the majority of archaeological research. With this book, Moore makes those dimensions central to our practice. His bold example should be followed elsewhere. 

Postclassic Soconusco Society: The Late Prehistory of the Coast ofChiapas, Mexico. BARBARA VOORHIES and JANINE GASCO. Institute for Mesoamerican Studies-University of Albany, New York, 2005. xi+ 211 pp., bib. $35.00 (paper).

The reconfiguration of prehispanic societies following the collapse of Classic period states and the develop­ment of interconnected small states or city-states marked the Postclassic period. This volume complements other recent works on the Postclassic by archaeologists and ethnohistorians who have employed diverse theoretical frameworks to understand these changes. This book use­fully pulls together much previously unpublished infor­mation on the Postclassic of coastal Chiapas collected during various projects directed by Barbara Voorhies and Janine Gasco. 
The Soconusco region comprised of the Pacific coast of the modem Mexican state of Chiapas and adjoining Guatemala was famed for its cacao production and also formed an important frontier and crossroads in prehis­panic Mesoamerica. In the late fifteenth century the Aztecs conquered the Soconusco and incorporated it into their empire. Gasco and Voorhies undertook their individual and joint field investigations in Chiapas with diverse objectives, and the authors are explicit about the limitations of their data. Much of the Late Postclassic material they found came from deposits mixed with ear­lier artifacts. The identification of Early and Middle Postclassic is problematic and it is difficult to recognize sites without mounds in the Soconusco. Nonetheless, the authors present much useful information, especially on the Late Postclassic. 
This well-illustrated volume contains seven chapters 
and two appendixes. Chapter 2 describes the Late Post­
classic site of Acapetahua, the capital of a Late Post­
classic polity. As part of the Proyecto Soconusco, they 
conducted subsurface testing at the site, along with larger 
horizontal excavations. Occupation extends back to the 
Late Preclassic when a large platform was constructed 
on a ridge top. Following the Aztec conquest in the 
1480s, Acapetahua became a tribute center. 
Chapter 3 presents data on sites subordinate to 
Acapetahua or other primary centers. Late Postclassic 
secondary centers generally consist of central conical 
mounds that probably supported a small temple flanked
