The fate of the Jamaican Taíno encountered by Columbus and that of other Taíno peoples throughout the Greater Antilles is a tragic one: within a century these groups had been con­quered and virtually disappeared (on Jamaica, see Wesler 2013:252–253). 
Despite 
the 
inten­
sity of the Spanish-Taíno engagement over that period, only a handful of chronicles describe Taíno society in more than passing references. These 
chronicles, 
as 
Keegan 
(2013:70–72) 
notes, 
are not without problems either in their documen­tation or subsequent use. Of particular concern is their facilitation of a homogeneous ethnographic present for the Taíno of the Greater Antilles, one that denies potentially diverse histories, cul­tural and linguistic variation, and island-speci.c adaptations (Keegan 2007;Oliver 
2009; 
Wilson 
2007).1 
A growing archaeological dataset and close inspection of the ethnohistorical sources suggest a complex reality (Curet 2003:22). 
The 
role of the archaeologist is to document the diversity of cultural expressions for the Taíno with 
emphasis, 
as 
Keegan 
(2013:81) 
states, 
on 
“the processes responsible for a multivalent Caribbean.” 
We contribute to this exercise for Jamaica through examination of Taíno settlement con.guration as it existed in the village of Maima at the time of Spanish contact. Maima is strategically positioned on a hillside above the coastal plain, a topographic setting broadly characteristic of Taíno settlement patterns across the island. Archaeological research at Maima in 2014 and 2015 provides new insight into how this settlement type was accomplished through the use of arti.cial terraces and leveled platforms for Taíno house construction. Excavations on two of these terraces provide further documentation of the Jamaican Taíno house. In both settlement form and household features the Jamaican Taíno are distinctive within the scope of Caribbean archaeology. 


AnArchaeological ContextforMaima 
The historical record for Maima and the ini­tial Taíno engagement with the Spanish is lim­ited to a small number of references in the accounts of Columbus (Morison 1963), 
his 
son 
Ferdinand Columbus (Keen 1959), 
and 
Diego 
Mendez, chief clerk of the .eet (Major 1961). 
Being the closest village to Columbus’s ships in 1503, Maima was pivotal in the trade for provisions between the Spanish and the Taíno (Collard 1971:133; 
Padron 
2003:8). 
Beyond 
this, 
Ferdinand Columbus describes Maima as the locale where his father’s supporters defeated Captain Porras and his band of mutineers in 1504 (Keen 1959:280–281). 
It 
is 
unclear 
where 
or 
how 
Maima .ts into the political landscape of the Taíno in Jamaica. The number of archaeological sites along the Jamaican north coast (Allsworth-Jones 2008:79) 
suggests 
a 
dense 
population 
in 
later prehistory, with village locations regu­lated by upland terrain features and freshwater drainage. In a review of the limited descrip­tions provided by the Spanish chronicles, Wesler (2013:253) 
suggests 
a 
multiplicity 
of 
caciques 
with at least one, Huareo, holding considerable authority. Nevertheless, the accounts allow no more than the assumption of a nested political hierarchy in which regional polities, cacicazgos, may have existed. That neither Columbus nor his son identi.ed the name or authority of the Maima cacique could suggest a subordinate rank. 
The archaeological site of Maima was .rst documented in the 1940s by the avocational archaeologist Charles Cotter, who found “a num­ber of Arawak middens scattered over a large area” along “the bank of the dry riverbed known as Parson’s Gulley” (Aarons 1984:28). 
Tynsdale-Biscoe 
(1954) 
conducted 
additional 
excavations 
here in the early 1950s. In 1971 the govern­ment of Jamaica purchased the 300-acre Seville plantation, including Maima, to preserve and interpret the earliest history of the country within a heritage park. Leading up to the quincentennial celebration of Columbus’s .rst voyage, Spain provided funding and archaeological expertise for research on the .rst Spanish colony of Sevilla la Nueva; director Lorenzo E. Lopez y Sebastian expanded this to incorporate test excavations at Maima in 1982 (Lopez 1986). 
The 
results 
of 
the 
Lopez project were never written up in more than cursory notation. The excavation units at Maima were not back.lled, however, and were easily located in more recent investigations. 
In 2009 the Jamaican government submitted a nomination to UNESCO to have the “Seville Heritage Park” added to the World Heritage

List (it is presently on a Tentative List). Incor­porating Maima, the Sevilla la Nueva colony, and the post-1655 British sugar plantation of New Seville, the nomination recognizes the “encounter, co-existence and merging of Taíno, Europeans and Africans at this site,” giving “credence to the National Motto, Out ofMany, One People” (UNESCO 2009). Our research provides support for the nomination but also planning and interpretive data for the Seville Heritage Park. Initial objectives thus focused on documentation of site size, complexity, internal con.guration, and chronology and the potential impacts of contemporary land use. Initial survey was undertaken in 2014, with more concen­trated study, including site mapping and con­trolled excavations, in the following year. The results are far more informative than we had expected. 


An AnthropogenicHillscapeofTerraces and Platforms 
Upland areas in the vicinity of St. Ann’s Bay are formed by North Coast Belt bedded limestone of 
the Clarendon Block, Jamaican White Limestone Group (Robinson and Mitchell 1999). 
Contained 
within this are nodular or tabular layers of chert, a tool stone abundantly present in archaeological sites of the region. Initial archaeological survey on the hillslope identi.ed as Maima quickly doc­umented surface scatters of ceramics, lithics, and shell.sh remains over an area of approximately 1.2–1.5 
ha 
(Figure 
1). 
The 
distribution 
of 
this 
material is dissected by a steep-sided gulley, leading us to reference the Maima site in east and west sections. Maima East occurs on farmland and bush adjacent to the Seville Estate proper; Maima West is densely populated as a squatters’ settlement on untitled lands. In both segments, there is a north-to-south grade rising over a slope height of 10 to 15 m with notable terraces on the hillside. Controlled test excavations on select terraces in both east and west segments in 2014 illustrated that a number of these were constructed through intentional in.lling, at least in part. This created leveled platform surfaces on which houses could be built. The 2014 project was able to identify four such features in Maima West; it is likely that others exist in inaccessible

areas of the reclaimed village. The Maima East investigations also recorded several terraces and platforms. In 2015, these were cleared of vege­tation 
and 
mapped 
in

view 
(Figure 
2) 
and 
with 
contours 
(Figure 
3). 
As 
we 
are 
now 
able 
to 
document at Maima East, there is a minimum of 12 notable features distributed over several terrace levels. Three of these features had been excavated during the Lopez 1982 project. 
Terraces and platforms are constructed of locally available limestone aggregate, marl, or clay occasionally intermixed with degraded ceramic sherds and other archaeological materials. Construction materials can be readily acquired from adjacent slopes and in the gully bottoms, where colluvial deposits are concentrated. The presence of cultural materials in the .lls indicates the excavation and use of archaeological site matrices as additional constituents. Individual features are built outward from the upslope side to create a leveled surface. The thickness of the deposit consequently increases as it is added to on the down slope, with some of these .lls being substantial. In the House 10 terrace, for example, a 2014 test excavation illustrates .ll thickness of between 60 and 65 cm on the northern terrace edge 
(Figure 
4). 
Another, 
from Maima West, documented a 45–50 cm deposit, and excavation of the most northern of the 1982 units into Platform 6 (Figure 
2) 
would have removed 
3.7 m3 of limestone aggregate or clay .ll, given theunitsize(4.5x2m)and stratigraphy. 
In some cases where we have excavated through terrace .lls, the original soil surface is encountered. This is shallow dark brown clay that typically overlies a variable subsoil of mixed clay with limestone aggregate or limestone bedrock (Figure 
4). 
It 
is 
a 
rendzina 
soil 
closely 
match­
ing descriptions of Killancholly clay as occurs elsewhere on the Jamaican north coast (Gov­ernment of Jamaica 1964:10). 
Cultural 
materials 
occur within the subterrace soil, suggesting that terrace construction took place after initial site occupation. Subterrace diagnostic ceramics do not appear to be substantially different from those 
occurring 
on 
terrace 
surfaces 
(Figure 
5); 
however, all correspond to a Meillacan ceramic variant de.ning the White Marl period (AD 950–1545) (Allsworth-Jones 2008:102; 
Wesler 
2013:257). 
A 
1-x-1-m 
excavation 
unit 
in 
House 
8(Figure 
2) 
provides 
additional 
insight. 
The 
stratigraphy 
of 
this 
unit 
(Figure 
6) 
incorporates 
a terrace .ll of approximately 20 cm overlying strati.ed shell midden deposits up to 50 cm in thickness. The shell midden was positioned directly on top of limestone bedrock. Charcoal-based AMS radiocarbon dates from the lower and upper strata in the midden respectively are 938 ± 20 BP (Wk 43115, cal AD 1032–1151, 2s ) and 627 ± 20 BP (Wk 43114, cal AD 1298–1390, 2s ) (Table 
1). 
The 
upper 
date 
provides 
a 
terminus 
post quem for House 8 terrace construction, if not for terrace construction at Maima more generally. 
As we examined the terraces of Maima East, it was possible to predict locations of house struc­tures based on our inference of slightly elevated features 
(Figure 
2). 
Five 
of 
these 
had 
some 
type 
of excavation verifying initial impressions, with occupation materials atop an arti.cial platform. That other houses exist on these terraces seems highly probable. We also note that projected house locations occur on terrace edges above shallow 
basin-like 
depressions 
(Figure 
2). 
Rain­
water running downslope accumulates in these depressions, providing favorable areas for the potential planting of house gardens. The Taíno residents of Maima East may have enhanced these features by controlling the direction of drainage .ow. In fact, the .ll used to elevate terrace levels and construct house platforms may in part have been removed from these lower areas, serving a dual purpose of cut and .ll in terrace construction. 


EarlySixteenth-CenturyJamaicanTaíno Houses at MaimaEast 
The excavation of architectural features in Jamaican archaeology has been virtually nonex­istent. The discovery of terraces and platforms at Maima in 2014, therefore, was exciting for more than its engineering implications. If these were leveled surfaces upon which houses were constructed, they potentially represent a canvas onto which architectural features were imprinted. We have already noted the platform construction of House 10 and the substantial layer of .ll on its northern perimeter. In 2015

we removed surface loam from the terrace in search of the architectural imprint. House 7, .rst identi.ed by an exposed bedrock feature on the perimeter of an intermediate terrace in the central part of Maima East, also was selected for excavation. 
The House 10 excavation was successful in documenting a series of postholes de.ning a center-pole circular structure approximately 4 m in 
diameter 
(Figure 
7). 
The 
perimeter 
postholes 
typically are 15 cm in diameter, running to a depth of 20 to 25 cm. They have been excavated into the terrace surface and, in several cases, were supported by limestone rock packing. The central posthole is between 30 and 35 cm in diameter and extended from the surface to a depth of 45 cm. This also was stabilized by packed limestone rock. Postholes were not found on the western side of the house, a circumstance that appears anomalous. Given trade wind directions from the east-southeast, this part of the house likely was the door location. It is possible, therefore, that its construction form was different from other walls. A substantial rock feature exposed on the outside perimeter of the house in this area may have provided a .rm sub.oor for the house entrance and the activities undertaken there. Rather than a leveled and even house .oor surface, excavation of the platform exposed abundant limestone rock and an undulating occu­pation stratum. A naturally occurring, postoccu­pation drainage channel cut through the eastern side of the platform. We believe water .ow across the platform removed .ner marl sediments that previously composed the house .oor and covered the platform surface. Thus, the dense concentrations of projecting rock fragments are washed-out and exposed .ll constituents. 
House 7 excavations were to examine a lime­stone bedrock exposure thought initially to be a retaining wall for a platform. Once excavated, the exposure was found to slope downward to the south, creating a pocket or basin-like depression that had been leveled with limestone aggregate mixed with clay and cultural materials. Eight postholes ranging in size from 9 to 17 cm in diameter were recorded but without de.nitive pattern. Notably, two sets of adjacent postholes had 
been 
cut 
into 
the 
bedrock 
(Figure 
8), 
in 
a 
fashion similar to the “holster-formed postholes” documented 
by 
Samson 
(2010:142) 
at 
the 
El 
Cabo site in the Dominican Republic, but also present at several other sites in the Greater and Lesser Antilles (Samson et al. 2015:331). 
The 
nature of the platform and the materials recov­ered suggest a house .oor occupation. If this were in fact the case, House 7 would be similar to House 10 in size based on the con.guration of the bedrock basin. While built within a natural feature as opposed to an excavated depression, House 7 seems somewhat comparable to resi­dential structures at site MC 6 in the Turks and Caicos (Keegan 2007:144).

Cultural materials recovered from the House 7 and 10 excavations are diverse in function and support our interpretation of residential occupation as opposed to storage structures. This includes petaloid adzes, a range of pestle-like handstones and manos, .at-surface cobbles for use with the handstones or as metates, net weights, abraders, .aked stone expedient tools, debitage, and branch coral sprigs. The ceramic assemblage for each is abundant; 7,215 sherds were excavated from House 7 and 11,568 pieces from House 10. A wide variety of vessel forms and sizes are present, including boat-shaped forms with notched ends, and vessels with .lleted rims, punctation on the rims, and coarsely applied geometric incision. Four anthro­pomorphic or zoomorphic adorno pieces may represent cemi (Taíno gods, spirits) imagery as applied to household ceramics. As we have noted, in its style and decorative application this assemblage conforms closely to ceramic types of the White Marl period as documented elsewhere in Jamaica. 
Each of the house excavations recovered small assemblages of Spanish-derived artifacts, providing a post-Columbus end date for their individual occupations. From House 10 are six hand-forged nails, two fragments of glass, one with retouch, a piece of Spanish roof tile, a corroded piece of .at iron, and a sheep or goat

metatarsal and phalange. Excavations in House 7 recovered a cow molar as well as a silver piece that may be the handle of a fork or spoon. A ceramic handle fragment from House 7 may have been part of a colonoware vessel, a Taíno replication of a European ceramic cup or handled bowl (Woodward 2006). 
The 
historic 
component 
is consistent with the AD 1509 to 1534 presence of Sevilla la Nueva; the Spanish colony was only 700 to 800 m east-northeast of Houses 7 and 10 (Padron 2003; 
Woodward 
2009). 
Sevilla 
la Nueva was planned as an agricultural and ranching colony for local and regional mar­kets. The allocation of Jamaican Taíno peoples to the colonists through encomienda, a forced system of labor, was immediate and central to the colony’s role (Padron 2003:149–151). The impact of encomienda on Maima is unknown. The limited assemblage of historic materials in the households of Maima East, however, suggests the site was abandoned or its population forcibly removed shortly after the colony was established.

“western Taíno,” has long been recognized as distinct from the “Classic Taíno” of Hispaniola, Puerto Rico, and eastern Cuba. This distinction served to emphasize the elevated sociopolitical complexity of the Classic Taíno chiefdoms as well as a corresponding overlay of cultural traits. A large part of that overlay is reproduced in settlement layout, in which chie.y position and social relations are clearly de.ned on the landscape through village patterning, by large chie.y houses strategically positioned on central plazas, and by the construction and use of stone-lined ball courts (Alegría 1983; 
Deagan 
2004; 
Keegan 2007). 
The 
settlement 
con.guration 
we 
have described for Maima seems to be in stark contrast with this pattern. This, then, leads us to ask whether Maima is representative of Jamaican Taíno settlement at the time of Christopher Columbus, and if it is, what the implications are for Jamaican Taíno society in comparison to Classic Taíno culture as documented elsewhere. 
It may seem overly simplistic, but Atkin­son (2006:6) 
.ttingly 
describes 
the 
nature 
of Taíno settlement pattern in Jamaica by stat­ing that “it is the general consensus among Jamaican archaeologists that Taíno sites have the best views [because] their sites are gener­ally panoramic—located overlooking the land­scape.” 
Howard 
(1965:251) 
recognized 
this 
pat­
tern early in the 1960s, observing that “most vil­lages [occur] on hilltops overlooking the coastal plain and within reasonably easy access to the sea.” In his documentation of site locations mapped by James Lee between 1959 and 1986,

“middens” as having an association with the White Marl period. Only 17 of these occur at elevations below 15 m above sea level. His (2008:80–81) analysis of site geog­raphy additionally illustrates that a num­ber of these sites are located well inland (x = 4.57 km) and many are at substantial elevations (x = 160.85 m). The location of Maima on sloped and terraced terrain above the coastal plain, therefore, is not atypical. Rather it is the norm for the White Marl period, and for the Jamaican Taíno settlement by extension. 
The ubiquity of the hilltop settlement type throughout the White Marl period suggests its origins lay in an earlier ancestral pattern rather than a speci.c adaptation to the Jamaican landscape. White Marl and other late ceramic variants (Montego Bay, Port Morant) represent subseries of Meillacan Ostionoid ceramics as found elsewhere in Haiti, central Cuba, and the Dominican Republic (Rouse 1992:96–97). 
In 
form, decorative application, and other aspects of their production they are distinctively different from Redware ceramics (Ostionan Ostionoid subseries) of the preceding Little River period in Jamaica. This break is suf.ciently abrupt to suggest a new wave of migration into Jamaica beginning around AD 950–1000 (Keegan and Atkinson 2006:26; 
Sinelli 
2013:225). 
We 
believe 
that the people associated with this migration carried with them not only a Meillacan ceramic complex, but also a settlement pattern in which hillside or hilltop villages were central. In con­trast, Little River period archaeological sites for the most part are positioned on the coast (Wesler 2013:256). 
The 
difference 
in 
settlement 
patterns between Meillacan and Ostionan com­plexes more generally has been noted by Rouse (1992:99) 
for 
other 
areas 
in 
the 
Greater 
Antilles. 
Upland village locales would seem to be an adaptation of ancestral Meillacan peoples that Sinelli 
(2013:224) 
positions 
ultimately 
in 
the Cibao Valley region of the northern Dominican Republic based on radiocarbon dates. 
The uniqueness of the Maima village pat­tern relative to Meillacan sites elsewhere in the Greater Antilles lies in its use of constructed terraces and platforms. We cannot estimate how much .ll may have been employed, but feel safe in describing the construction process as a serious investment of labor. We have noted that Meillacan ceramics in subterrace deposits are of the same White Marl types as those occurring on the terrace surface. There is no evidence to suggest that discontinuity in site occupation accounts for the appearance of terrace platforms. We conclude, therefore, that terrace fabrication at Maima is a late prehistoric Jamaican Taíno development. The upper 2s date range of cal AD 1291–1395 (Wk 43114; Table 
1) 
for 
House 
8 provides an approximate terminus post quem age for this activity. Why these features suddenly appeared at Maima is a subject of speculation. Their construction facilitates a greater ability to house an expanding population on the hillslope in keeping with a proliferation of Jamaican Taíno peoples in later prehistory (Rouse 1992:7). 
Their 
construction further enhances side-slope settle­ment in advantageously positioning the Taíno household for prevailing breezes as well as an elevated viewscape. That it alternatively may relate to unknown changes in other aspects of Taíno society cannot be ruled out. 
During the 2014 survey and test excavation project at Maima, it was only near the end of the .eld program that we recognized the limestone aggregate, clay, and marl mix as arti­.cial .lls for terrace or platform construction. There was no precedent for the identi.cation of terraces in the archaeological record of Jamaica, nor for that matter in most other areas of the Greater Antilles (Keegan 2007:145 
provides 
an 
exception). Had it not been for the occasional degraded ceramic sherd or other items in these .lls, the excavations might have been termi­nated on the assumption that we had reached an underlying basal stratum. We wonder, there­fore, how many other archaeological projects at Jamaican Taíno sites had similar constructions that went unidenti.ed. The 1982 test excavations at Maima East, for example, had cut through a terrace, presumably unrecognized (Platform 6, Figure 
2); 
an 
additional 
effort 
by 
the 
same 
crew to excavate a test in House 10 was also abandoned when the compact graveled surface was encountered 
(Figure 
4). 
Scrutinizing 
past 
excavations in Jamaica in search of stratigraphic descriptions or drawings is not a simple task because most of this work remains unpublished

or has been reported in only a cursory fashion. It 
is 
fortunate 
that 
Allsworth-Jones 
(2008:135– 
184) has brought together the bits and pieces of data and individual excavation histories for a number of sites, with these projects spanning over a century of Jamaican archaeology. 
The intentional deposition of marl layers on a Taíno site was .rst reported for the White Marl site, the type-site for the White Marl period. Early (1952–1954) excavations here by Tynsdal-Biscoe documented three cultural strata interleaved with “6 in” deposits of marl (as reported in Allsworth-Jones 2008:163). 
Reexcavation by Howard (1965:251) 
in the 1960s not only substantiated this claim but led him to conclude that “this marling is clearly arti.cial and not the result of wind action.” That these layers could represent surface leveling for household .oors or other activities was seemingly ruled out for lack of evidence (Silverberg 1972 as cited in Allsworth-Jones 2008:164). 
Howard 
suggested 
instead 
that 
the 
marl was used to “sweeten the site periodically” or represented a “pattern of ceremonial renewal.” Neither was veri.ed in subsequent studies. 
The Allsworth-Jones account of archaeolog­ical excavation projects includes 28 sites identi­.ed as White Marl–Montego Bay period. Many of the descriptions are no more than a brief paragraph identifying earlier researchers who had undertaken the excavations; some include more in-depth discussion of the .nds but say little about site stratigraphy. Nevertheless, a reading of these accounts makes it possible to isolate stratigraphic records for .ve White Marl sites and one Montego Bay site in which distinct cultural layers are separated by variously described marl or 
gravel 
strata 
(Table 
2). 
Of 
particular 
note 
is 
the Fair.eld site, a large hilltop village associated with the Montego Bay Meillacan ceramic variant (Allsworth-Jones 2008:149). 
Layer 
4 
(Trench 
5) 
is described as a “marl layer, almost sterile” with radiocarbon dates on wood charcoal of cal AD 1310–1370 and cal AD 1270–1340 on cul­tural occupations above and below, respectively. (Conolley 2011:102, 
112). 
These 
dates 
are 
all 
but 
identical to the terminus post quem suggested for the House 8 terrace at Maima East. Interpreting the intervening gravel-like layers as colluvium in their excavations at Green Castle and Newry, Allsworth-Jones 
and 
Wesler 
(2012:30) 
under­
score the complexity of site stratigraphy. They state that “site formation processes of Jamaican Taíno sites are a subject needing intensive further investigation in a geoarchaeological perspec­tive.” 
New data also exist relating to residential con­struction and Jamaican Taíno settlement con.gu­ration. The House 10 posthole pattern documents a small center-post structure of no more than 4 m diameter with a .oor area of approximately 
12.57 m2 (Figure 
3). 
If 
the 
in.lled 
natural 
basin 
of House 7 is inferred to be a house .oor occu­pation as well, it is of comparable size. Clearly these are not the large extended family household structures described for the Classic Taíno of Hispaniola and Puerto Rico (Deagan 2004:607; 
Samson 2010:57–60). 
They 
would 
not 
accom­
modate more than a small nuclear family, perhaps in the range of four to .ve individuals. With only one clearly de.ned structure, any attempt to gen­eralize about the Jamaican Taíno house remains tentative if not speculative, especially given the strati.ed nature of Taíno sociopolitical organi­zation. Yet the small amount of comparative information on household size from elsewhere in Jamaica is tantalizingly consistent. House 10, in fact, may provide a household template for the great majority of individuals who were resident at Maima at the time of Spanish contact. 
Allsworth-Jones’s assemblage of notes, re­ports, and dif.cult-to-acquire publications for individual site excavations is summarized in his text; supplementary maps, drawings, and other materials are incorporated in appendixes on a CD-ROM. A prominent site is Bellevue­Manning’s Hill, which was excavated in two areas between 1974 and 1977. As Allsworth-Jones (2008:156) 
relates, these excavations revealed “a circular arrangement of postholes convincingly interpreted as a house foundation.” The plan-view map (Allsworth-Jones 2008:CD­
ROM, Appendix 9) illustrates a circular to ovoid structure, between 3.8 and 4.3 m in diameter, that is de.ned by a series of 13 posthole clusters; most are adjacent pairs, but there are two larger post-holes on the southwest and northeast perimeter. There is no central post or any indication of door location for the structure. Two aspects of this house are relevant to the present discussion. First,

the postholes were visible “in a layer of hardened earth,” suggesting an intentionally packed .oor. Second, the .oor area of 11.3–14.5 m2 comfort­ably overlaps with House 10 and House 7 at Maima East. It may be a coincidence, but the paired postholes of the Bellevue-Manning’s Hill structure appear comparable to the posthole pairs excavated into the bedrock for House 7 at Maima East. 
Allsworth-Jones 
(2008:161–168) 
provides 
a 
lengthy description of the excavation history for the White Marl type-site. Located in southeastern Jamaica, the site is a hilltop settlement 6.5 km from the ocean, with its original extent estimated to be as much as 33 acres (13.4 ha). Excavations by four different individuals were undertaken between 1952 and 1969 involving 11 excavation projects. 
In 
1963, 
Howard 
(1965:252) 
excavated 
a block area in the central part of the site to search for residential features, but was not successful. Subsequent excavations by Clifford in 1969–1970, however, exposed “nine postholes indicating a circular structure of 14’ [4.27 m]” (Allsworth-Jones 2008:167). 
The 
house 
entrance 
is described as being to the east, with a cooking area located to the west. This structure was similar to Bellevue-Manning’s Hill in not having a central post; rather there was a centrally located “burned area” 12 in (30.5 cm) in diameter. A .oor area of 14.3 m2 underscores once more the smallness of the Jamaican Taíno house, or at least one version of it in later prehistory. 
A wide-ranging review of Caribbean house­hold archaeology incorporating settlement lay­outs, house form data, and residential sizes can be found 
in 
Samson 
(2010). 
Tabulation 
of 
these 
data 
in a later paper (Samson et al. 2015:327) 
iden­
ti.es 15 sites where excavations have exposed a total of 98 residential features. Most of these are post-built with round to oval .oor plans varying in size from 10 m2 to 576 m2. Yet, excluding Bellevue-Manning’s Hill, there are only six exca­vated houses with interior areas under 20 m2 (Samson et al. 2015:330), 
and 
these 
tend 
to 
be 
isolated occurrences on sites with much larger structures (e.g., Righter 2002:312). 
An 
intriguing 
exception to this occurs in south-central Cuba in the late prehistoric to contact period (Horizon III) hilltop site of Loma del Convento (Knight 2010:36–37). 
Here, 
a 
single 
center-post 
house 
was excavated with an estimated interior area 
2
of 13 m. This house had been built on an uneven slope that was leveled to grade through the chipping-away of limestone bedrock, with postholes dug directly into bedrock. 
Much debate and discussion has centered on the nature of Taíno (writ large) kinship and post­marital residence patterns (Keegan and Maclach­lan 1989; 
Curet 
and 
Oliver 
1998; 
Curet 
2002; 
Keegan 2006). 
Within 
this 
debate 
it 
has 
been 
a given that settlement con.guration and house form reproduce these relationships closely. They also 
represent, 
as 
Ensor 
(2013:85–87) 
suggests, 
material correlates for kinship without in.uence of the Spanish chronicles. We do not want to overplay the data from Maima East, yet we can say that the small size of Jamaican Taíno houses documented to date must be re.ective of a nuclear rather than an extended family residential pattern. This, then, seems in contrast to the labor requirements of house terrace construction. In 
Puerto 
Rico, 
Curet 
and 
Oliver 
(1998:222–

223) identify a dramatic transition from large communal households to smaller types char­acteristic of nuclear families between AD 900 and AD 1200. Correlated with changes in burial practices, the presence of ceremonial centers, and other cultural traits, they theorize an emergence and consolidation of power by chie.y elites, the demise of lineal descent groups, and increasing complexity in social and political spheres. The domestic unit of production may have been transferred to the individual household level (Keegan 2007:175), 
but 
caciques 
increasingly 
gained control over aspects of production and the organization of labor, land, and other resources (Curet and Oliver 1998:234). 
The 
transformation 
of the Maima East landscape into a hillslope of terraces may not have been conceived and undertaken at the individual family level. The cacique’s increasing ability to mobilize labor for village expansion or improvements may well have been key to the Jamaican Taíno settlement con.guration at the time of their .rst encounter with Christopher Columbus. 


Conclusion 
Spanish accounts of the Taíno peoples in the Greater Antilles pose dilemmas since these sources foster the impression of an undifferen­tiated ethnographic present. When these sources are applied indiscriminately in modern studies, it results in an “ethno-tyranny,” to borrow a phrase from 
Maclachlan 
and 
Keegan 
(1990:1011), 
one 
that denies sociopolitical diversity, alternative historical trajectories, and linguistic variation. Archaeologists thus have a critical role to play: we are the frontline ethnographers for documen­tation of Taíno peoples as they lived their lives on various islands in the late .fteenth-century Caribbean. The present attempt to document and interpret Jamaican Taíno settlement con.gura­tion is therefore not framed against the usual backdrop of ethnohistorical sources. We believe the archaeological record of Maima provides a template for comparison or testing against the broader dataset derived from Jamaican archae­ology. This has been done to the extent that the existing data allow. 
In its settlement form Maima was a siz­able hillslope village looking north across the coastal plain to the Caribbean Sea. We cannot be certain when it was .rst occupied, but a 2s calibrated radiocarbon date range of AD 1032–1154 
(Table 
1) 
suggests 
it 
was 
early 
in 
the 
White Marl period (AD 950–1545) of Jamaican antiquity. The proclivity for hillside or hilltop settlement, in fact, is characteristic of the White Marl period as a whole, suggesting it is part of an ancestral Meillacan settlement pattern brought to Jamaica in the tenth century AD Perhaps in response to increasing Taíno pop­ulation growth, by the thirteenth to fourteenth centuries AD the people at Maima had expanded their settlement capacity through construction of house terraces or platforms. Some of these appear to have been major undertakings requiring the transport of volumes of broken limestone, marl, and other .lls. The few archaeological reports on Jamaica that describe stratigraphy in detail suggest this adaptation is a widespread phenomenon. Recorded details of the Jamaican Taíno house form include circular structures with or without central poles, illustrating a degree of diversity in their construction. A surpris­ingly limited .oor space is a constant, however, a characteristic that contrasts with the exten­sive construction efforts devoted to the terrace itself. 
The work at Maima is ultimately but a small contribution to the documentation of Jamaican Taíno society at .rst Spanish contact. Even so, much more detail about the site will be required before we can generalize about it in a categorical way. It does provide a starting point for future examination of Jamaican Taíno peoples within the Greater Antilles region. We hope that further studies will expand upon this base, clarify the pattern, and provide greater insight than current data permit.

Note 
1. A reviewer for this paper has observed that despite our agreement with epistemological concerns over the use of “Taíno” in reference to indigenous peoples of the Greater Antilles, we continue to use the concept in much the same way that it has been used in the past. Within the paper we do use “Taíno” as a gloss in reference to indigenous peoples in the Greater Antilles who share linguistic and ancestral relationships, as do most Caribbean archaeologists. We expect, however, that there will be regional variation in culture, adaptation, and other traits. Indeed, the objective of the paper is to document a part of this variation as it relates speci.cally to the Jamaican Taíno.
