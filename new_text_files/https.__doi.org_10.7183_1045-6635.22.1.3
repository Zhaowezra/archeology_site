ARCHAEOLOGICAL DRAWINGS AS RE-PRESENTATIONS: 
THE MAPS OF COMPLEX A, LA VENTA, MEXICO 

Susan D. Gillespie 
Scientific drawings, including maps, are increasingly recognized as theory-laden media for conveying information. The degree to which this quality impacts archaeological interpretations is revealed in the history of the published maps of La Venta, a Formative period Mesoamerican regional center. La Venta is pivotal to understanding the Olmec culture of Mex­ico's Gulf Coast, yet archaeological knowledge is based primarily on one small portion of the site, Complex A, excavated in 1955. Since destroyed, Complex A is now known especially through visual representations. A review of the Complex A maps in the original field report and subsequent publications demonstrates how these technical drawings have sometimes superseded the textual excavation data in generating and disseminating archaeological knowledge. Over time the maps have become more schematic and misleading, impeding understandings of La Vento and its role in regional cultural man­ifestations. Reliance on totalizing plan maps has led most archaeologists to overlook the 1955 excavators' major interpre­tations of the construction history of Complex A. However, the 1955 conclusions regarding the longevity of the formal design rules of the complex, reiterated by later archaeologists precisely because they are clearly visible in plan maps, are less well supported by the stratigraphic evidence.

La Venta es fundamental para el entendimiento de la cultura olmeca de la costa del Golfo de Mexico, mas sin embargo, el conocimiento arqueol6gico esta basado casi completamente en una pequefia parte del sitio, el Complejo A, excavado en 1955.

communicate knowledge (see Moser 1992, 1988, 2001; Moser and Gamble 1997; more generally Latour 1986, 2005:76; Law and Whittaker 1988). 
Although these concerns apply to virtually all archaeological illustrations, the case of La Venta, a major prehispanic Olmec regional center in Mex­ico, is particularly noteworthy because knowledge of the site has been so strongly influenced by graphic renderings of its mound architecture. The published La Venta site maps and stratigraphic drawings do not well represent the complex archae­ological evidence detailed in the excavation reports (Drucker 1952; Drucker et al. 1959). Nevertheless, the maps and perspective drawings from the 1955 excavations at La Venta's Complex A have tended to replace, and not just supplement, much of the other archaeological information as a medium of scientific and public communication. Why this is so deserves some explanation, grounded in the properties of archaeological mapmaking and the history of excavations and interpretations of La Venta. 
Scientific Drawings 
Since the Renaissance, realistic likenesses of phe­nomena have come to be treated as "re­presentations," mobile media that seem to render present that which is absent (Latour 1988b:24). 
However, no object can simply be reduced to another; some complexity is lost in the transference (Latour 1988a:158). Furthermore, archaeologists must be trained in "particular ways of seeing" in order to recognize the traces of past peoples in depictions as well as in field settings (Bradley 1997 :62-63). Like other sciences, archaeology has developed conventions for crafting illustrations and other visualization devices (e.g., Dillon 1985; Grif­fiths and Jenner 1990; Steiner 2005). Adherence to these conventions is necessary to garner the confi­dence of the scientific community in one's findings and interpretations (Van Reybrouck 1998:60). 
Moreover, these images are presentations of the­ories as much as they are depictions of objects or forms (Moser 1992:831, 837). Scientific illustra­tions more generally have been characterized as simplified, economical, and "docile" media that "speak on behalf' of the unwieldy reality they rep­resent (Law and Whittaker 1988:160-161); as a result, the complexity of that reality is often neglected (Latour 1986: 17-18). Following this metaphor, potential information rendered absent from the images has been "silenced" (Law and Whit­taker 1988: 161).For example,Jones (2001:352) has observed that the common practice in archaeologi­cal illustration of grouping drawings of artifacts from different places and time periods on a single page contributes to their "atemporalization," as the variations that emerged from their manufacture, use, or deposition at different time frames are obviated by the static "two-dimensionality of the page" on which they are arrayed. 
Much of the recent questioning of the role of images in archaeology has concerned illustrations of artifacts and pictorial imaginings of life in the past as paintings, museum displays, or video doc­umentary reconstructions, but similar critiques have been extended to maps and related drawings of spatial relationships of landforms. Modem car­tography developed in concert with the innovation of linear perspective in Renaissance visual arts and emergent capitalist political economies, both of which contributed to a new "way of seeing" the landscape that distanced the observer from the land (Cosgrove 1985). Although both landscape paint­ings and maps derived from these same beginnings, they eventually came to be seen as separate prod­ucts: paintings are considered subjective, qualita­tive, and evocative, while maps are treated as quantitative and objective, more "science" than "art" (Alpers 1983: 124). This conventional contrast between the two media is increasingly challenged today, as maps are recognized as types of pictures "privileging ... a particular conceptual scheme" (Turnbull 1993: 15). The oft-assumed neutrality attributed to instrument-made maps is negated by the selectivity inherent in any map, the filter of mapmaking conventions, and the roles maps play in spatial politics (e.g., Bender 1999; Bradley 1997:70; Duncan and Ley 1993:1; Harley 1988, 1992; Law and Whittaker 1988; Thomas 2001: 169; Turnbull 1993:5-6). 
Among the criticisms specifically directed to archaeological maps is the static and "totalizing vision" (Thomas 1993: 25) they produce. Maps and plan views usually adopt "a bird's eye-lord's eye-view of the world .. . [registering] a palimpsest of past activities" (Bender 1999:31; emphasis in original) that contributes to the "atem­poralization" of spatial features. The map reader is

often provided only the outlines (footprints) of three-dimensional structures, their relative height (or depth) having been disregarded or inadequately referenced (Bradley 2003: 163). Because maps dis­tance viewers from landforms, they make it diffi­cult to comprehend how the original inhabitants of a locale experienced and shaped their landscapes. The temporality of the use and modification of landscape features as well as their material, sen­sual, and aesthetic qualities are usually silenced. 
In drawing upon this body of criticism to inves­tigate the limitations of the maps and related draw­ings of La Venta, this study investigates that component of the "archaeological record" com­posed of reports (following Patrik 1985:29-30). Over 50 years ago Laet argued that the critical eval­uation of "the results of the most notable excava­tions made in the past" was an archaeological task equal in importance to "research into the ground for new evidence" of human activities (1957:81; see Patrik 1985:30). However, in such investiga­tions visual devices have tended to receive less scrutiny than textual presentations of archaeolog­ical information, because the former are usually "not ascribed with enough power to merit critical examination" (Moser and Smiles 2005:6). Their seeming ability to hide their power to influence the viewer, who then does not think to question them, serves to increase that power (following Miller 2005:5). When these images are technical draw­ings, presumed to be objective visual representa­tions of structures and strata created with the use of measuring instruments, their ability to evade scrutiny is further enhanced. Maps, in particular, "to have authority in Western society, must have the appearance of 'artless-ness'"; their embedded conventions "must be so well accepted as to be almost invisible" (Turnbull 1993:6). Because they have the capability to "deny or suppress the point of view" that motivates and shapes them (Turnbull 1993: 15), maps should be more carefully analyzed in terms of the decisions and conventions that went into their making. 
The Significance of the La Venta Maps 
One of "the most notable excavations made in the past" was the 1955 Smithsonian Institution­National Geographic Society project directed by Philip Drucker and Robert Heizer at Complex A, a small grouping of low clay platforms within the site of La Venta, located near the Gulf Coast in Tabasco state, Mexico (Drucker et al. 1959). La Ven ta was the premier center of the Olmec culture and likely the most important regional capital in non-Maya Mesoamerica during the Middle For­mative period (ca. 900-500 B.C.), a time of emer­gent regional political formations. It is long thought to have influenced the political and cultural devel­opment of other central Mexican settlements as well as nascent Maya centers (e.g., Drucker et al. 1959; Gonzalez Lauck 1996) .Although much more is now known about Olmec origins, cultural char­acteristics, and chronology from survey and exca­vations at other sites (reviews in Diehl 2004; Grove 1997; Pool 2007), La Venta is still the linchpin for understanding the Middle Formative Olmec phe­nomenon. 
This is a heavy burden of significance for a site about which so little is known.Although there have been some mapping and excavation projects at La Venta since 1955 (notably Gonzalez Lauck 1988, 1997; Heizer et al. 1968a), the 1959 report on the 1955 Complex A stratigraphic excavations contin­ues to serve as a principal source for knowledge of the site's archaeology and chronology. Unfortu­nately, that report presents many interpretive dif­ficulties, some of which were detailed in a pointed but little-read critique by Coe and Stuckenrath ( 1964) soon after its publication. In prepublication correspondence to Heizer, William Coe wrote that his criticism was actually directed against unnamed archaeologists who, he said, misused the 1959 report.1 They never bothered to read it carefully or concern themselves with the excavation details despite the fact that La Venta was such an impor­tant site (Coe and Stuckenrath 1964:2). 
In questioning the conclusions reached by the 1955 archaeologists, Coe and Stuckenrath (1964) detailed the difficulties they encountered correlat­ing the excavation information presented textually with that depicted in the maps and drawings. I argue here that, in part as a consequence of this incom­mensurable relationship, the maps and perspective drawings of Complex A came to substitute for the dense descriptive archaeological data of the 1959 report in many interpretations of La Venta's archae­ology. Moreover, soon after that report was pub­lished, its complicated maps were replaced by simplified versions in subsequent publications on

the Olmecs, maps that were even further distanced from the primary data contained in the report. 
To demonstrate in detail the interpretive diffi­culties of treating maps as "re-presentations," this study reviews maps of Complex A especially in publications authored by experts in Olmec or Mesoamerican archaeology (notably Adams 1977, 1991; Bernal 1969; Coe 1968, 1977; Diehl 2004; Evans 2004; Gonzalez Lauck 1988, 1994, 1996; Grove 1997; Heizer, Graham, and Napton 1968; Pool 2007; Porter Weaver 1981; Willey 1966; this article cannot consider every published map of La Venta). These are the works to which other schol­ars and the public alike would turn for the best infor­mation. The published maps are briefly evaluated against the original field records of the 1955 La Venta project, which are housed among the Robert Fleming Heizer Papers at the National Anthropo­logical Archives of the Smithsonian Institution in Suitland, Maryland. I am now incorporating some of this field-recorded information into new maps and depictions using visualization software not available in the 1950s but becoming standard today in archaeological practice and aesthetics.2 The lat­ter images are also created according to conven­tional "craft traditions" within archaeology (Bradley 1997) and cannot be granted greater objectivity, but they include some of the information lost when the 1955 drawings were prepared for publication. 
The intent of this reevaluation of the "archaeo­logical record" of Complex A is not to discredit the original excavators, an accusation lodged at Coe and Stuckenrath (1964) by Drucker and Heizer (1965). Neither is it meant as a treatise on map­making practices, although it is impossible to avoid commenting on how archaeological maps are gen­erated to graphically represent a physical reality, and more discussion of this topic among archaeol­ogists is needed (e.g., Webmoor 2005). The prox­imate objective is to reveal the latent influence of mapping conventions on archaeological interpre­tations via a chronological review of one very influ­ential map and its cognates (compare to Kidder 2002). I argue that reliance on plan maps has led most archaeologists to overlook Drucker and Heizer's important conclusions regarding Com­plexNs construction history, even as it has overem­phasized the excavators' interpretation that Complex A was built in strict conformance with an original and long-lived formal design plan. 
A brief description of Comp lex A based on exca­vations in the 1940s and 1950s is presented in the next section. The major goal of the 1955 project was to investigate the clay mound architecture, so the emphasis in this description is on the arrange­ment and modification of those structures. That section is followed by a review of how Complex A has been represented by totalizing plan maps in subsequent publications. Mapping conventions and restrictions imposed by print publication tended to introduce or exacerbate errors in depictions of the architecture and the excavation units. Stratigraphic profile drawings meant to supplement the plan maps, indicating how and when the individual structures and the complex as a whole were built and modified, have their own shortcomings, as detailed in the following section of the article. In the last section I argue that overreliance on plan maps and perspective drawings has led to the neglect of the ritually charged and materially impli­cated social practices that built Complex A over generations, information crucial to interpreting La Venta's role in local and regional cultural mani­festations. The ultimate objectives of this article are thus to direct archaeological attention toward alter­native means for interpreting Complex A and sim­ilar sites and to consider the possibilities for creating imaging devices that more explicitly pro­mulgate such interpretations. 
La Venta Complex A 
La Venta is an "island," a narrow natural elevation approximately 4 km long north-south rising above the swamps on the coastal plain of Tabasco state just east of the Tonala River and 15 km south of the modem Gulf of Mexico coastline (Drucker et al. 1959:8; Gonzalez Lauck 1996:73, 2001:798; Figure 1). The archaeological site of the same name dominates the island's center. The 1942 excavations at La Venta directed by Mathew Stirling and under­taken by Philip Drucker enabled archaeologists to finally assign a "homeland" for a style of mostly unprovenienced objects known across Mesoamer­ica (Drucker 1975: 103). This style had been named Olmec by George Vaillant in 1932 (Coe 1965a:747), and La Venta became the type site of the Olmec civilization (Coe 1965b:686; Heizer 1959). Radiocarbon dates from the 1955 excava­tions demonstrated the antiquity of Olmec culture

LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 22, No. 1, 2011 
Clues to the site's importance first came to light in a brief visit by Blom and La Farge (1926), who investigated several monumental stone carvings still evident on the surface near a great earthen pyramid over 30 m high. Stirling, of the Smith­sonian Institution, made La Venta a priority in his long-range program of Olmec archaeology (Drucker 194 7). Trenching excavations by Stirling and Drucker in 1942 and by Stirling and Waldo Wedel in 1943 revealed incredible discoveries in Complex A, a group of low clay mounds just north of the pyramid (Figure 2). These include Tomb A, an enclosure constructed of natural basalt columns; Tomb B, a great sandstone effigy coffer; two mas­sive buried mosaic pavements made of hundreds of polished serpentine blocks in a formal design; and many small jade and serpentine objects care­fully arranged in buried caches, referred to as "ded­icatory offerings" (Drucker 1952, 1975; Stirling 1940, 1942, 1943a, 1943b; Stirling and Stirling 1942). All of the stone had to have been imported to La Venta from sources long distances away. 
In 1955 a major archaeological project led by Drucker and Robert Heizer, published in 1959 by Drucker, Heizer, and Robert Squier (Drucker et al. 1959; see also Drucker and Heizer 1965, 1975), revealed more extraordinary buried objects. These include a third serpentine block mosaic overlaying many tons of layered serpentine chunks arranged in a deep pit, two other deep pits with layers of ser­pentine blocks at their bases, and a cache of stand­ing greenstone figurines and celts (Offering 4). Some subsequent discussions of Olmec culture have tended to dwell on the apparent predilection at La Venta for acquiring and crafting costly stone objects only to bury them within a small ritual set­ting. Modern sensibilities consider it a wasteful practice, one that may reveal 0lmec religious devo­tion, psychological eccentricities, or alternatively, political strategies of the ruling elites (e.g., Coe 1968:61, 63; Drucker and Heizer 1956:368, 1965; Gillespie 2006; Pina Chan 1989: 187). Importantly, the 1955 excavations also highlighted the long his­tory of ritual use of the Ceremonial Court. This is the name given to an area at the heart of Complex A partially enclosed by a wall of vertically posi­tioned pieces of columnar basalt. 
For decades Complex A with the adjacent great pyramid (Complex C) represented the site of La Venta. Eventually Complex B south of the pyra­mid and other nearby clay structures were cleared and mapped (Gonzalez Lauck 1988; Heizer et al. 1968c), revealing a large civic-ceremonial core defined by platform mounds and monumental stone sculptures in an area that may originally have cov­ered some 200 ha (Gonzalez Lauck 1996:75). How­ever, despite La Venta's undoubted importance, little else within the ci vie-ceremonial core has been excavated (Gonzalez Lauck 1996:76; Rust 2008; Rust and Sharer 1988). Thus archaeologists con­tinue to rely on the Complex A discoveries to char­acterize La Ven ta as a whole (e.g., Bernal 1969; Coe 1965b, 1968; Diehl 2004; Evans 2004; Gonzalez Lauck 1994, 1996; Pool 2007; Reilly 1994, 1999, 2002; Soustelle 1979; Tate 1999, 2001, 2008). Because Complex A exhibits many unique or rare features, the dependence on this one small ritual precinct for knowledge of La Venta specifically, and the Olmecs more generally, is problematic (Diehl and Coe 1995: 17). 
Unfortunately, Complex A was badly destroyed by looting and occupation activities after the 1955 project ended (Drucker and Heizer 1965:63, 1975:389). As Heizer later observed, Complex A "has been so torn up by bulldozers that no surface feature whatsoever exists that can be identified as being present in 1955. The 1955 map of Complex A, therefore, is the best we wiil ever have" (Heizer, Graham, and Napton 1968:139; emphasis added). With the destruction of the surface architecture, the 1955 map was given the daunting responsibility not only to "re-present" Complex A but actually to replace it (paraphrasing Van Reybrouck 1998:62). 
The Structures and Design Plan of Complex A 
Explaining how Complex A was built and trans­formed over time was a major goal of the 1955 pro­ject (Drucker and Heizer 1965 :63). 3 However, with so much public and archaeological attention devoted to the numerous exotic artifact finds, it was difficult to convince other archaeologists of the importance of the structures themselves (see Coe and Stuckenrath 1964). These were not impressive masonry pyramids, although some facades had been embellished with worked stone. They were low clay platforms, relatively shapeless and dam­aged by pitting and erosion. The architecture had to be visually represented primarily by maps and related drawings because photographs could not capture the totality of any individual structure. Most

of the structures and the massive pits associated with them were too large or incompletely excavated to show well in photos, while the shortest platforms were covered with overburden and revealed only in trenches. In other words, because so much of the physical reality of Complex A was unwieldy and not fully visible to the naked eye, increasing author­ity was given to the technical drawings (see Latour 1986:18). Furthermore, the color differences among the strata necessary to understand the con­struction history could not be well discerned in the published black-and-white photographs and draw­ings (in Drucker 1952; Drucker et al. 1959). 
The 1955 plan map shows that Complex A exhibits a formal design with a pronounced north-south orientation and east-west bilateral symmetry (Drucker et al. 1959:14; Figure 3). This symmetry is unique among the La Venta building complexes and is considered unusual for Olmec ceremonial centers (Adams 1991:59; Diehl 1981:78; Gonzalez Lauck 1996:76; Tate 2008:38). Three platform pairs are arranged east and west of a virtual north-south centerline that bisects the cen­tral Mounds A-2 and A-3, the rectangular Cere­monial Court, the South-Central Platform, and the pyramid at the southern end of Complex A. The 1942, 1943, and 1955 excavations opened a wide north-south trench along the centerline from north of Mound A-2 to the northern limits of the pyra­mid. This trench revealed many buried offerings placed along the centerline, including three of the five massive offerings-the pavements made of layers of serpentine blocks-and five tombs des­ignated A, B, C, D, and E (Drucker 1952:Figure 
14).4 
Excavations also determined that the area of the 
Ceremonial Court had been artificially leveled and 
walled with a low clay embankment principally on 
the east and west sides. This wall was later greatly 
enlarged with adobe bricks, embellished with rows 
of facing stones. It was further heightened by the 
erection of naturally occurring columnar basalts, 
fitted close together along the inside of the brick 
wall, enclosing an area 57.3 m (188 ft) east-west 
x 41.15 m (135 ft) north-south (Drucker et al. 
1959:8). The Ceremonial Court was designated 
Feature A-1, consisting of the wall (Feature A-1­
a), the built-up floors within it (Feature A-1-b), and 
the stone-embellished Northeast Entryway (Feature 
A-1-i). Twinned square adobe platforms on the 
southern boundary of the Ceremonial Court were first called the East and West Bastions and later renamed the Southeast Platform (Feature A-1-d) and Southwest Platform (Feature A-1-e). Excava­tions in 1955 exposed the low Northeast (Feature A-1-f), Northwest (Feature A"l-g), and South­Central Platforms (Feature A-1-c, at first called a stile) within the Ceremonial Court (Drucker et al. 1959:10-11).5 
The 1955 excavations uncovered evidence of a series of modifications, summarized in terms of four major construction phases (I-IV) for the Cer­emonial Court as a whole (Drucker et al. 1959: 121-127). Each architectural stratum as well as the massive and dedicatory offerings and car­bon samples were assigned to one of these phases. The construction phases were distinguished by the buildup of floor series that extended throughout the court. The water-sorted floors were laid first (I), fol­lowed by the white sandy floors (II), the old rose floors (III), and finally a deposit of red clay (IV). The red clay also covered Mounds A-3, A-4, and A-5 south of the Ceremonial Court and Mound A­2 to the north. The three earlier floor series con­sisted of multiple thin layers of colored clays and sands, alternating with episodes of clay fill brought in to raise the court floor. The court building phases also impacted modifications to Mounds A-2 and A-3 north and south (respectively) of the court, but Mounds A-4 and A-5 were dated only to the last building phase (IV). 
Drucker and Heizer concluded that the Cere­monial Court was the "principal structural feature" of Complex A, built and modified over several cen­turies in a coordinated fashion, with the other plat­forms constituting its "adjuncts or appendages" (1965:39-40, 45). They were confident of "func­tional relationships" among the structures and demonstrable cultural continuity in the ritual prac­tices associated with the Ceremonial Court from Phases I to IV (Drucker and Heizer 1965:63-64; Drucker et al. 1959:124; Heizer 1959:178-179). Furthermore, given the regular patterning exhibited by paired structures on either side of a virtual north-south line that bisected other platforms, they were "convinced of the reality of this centerline as a significant feature in the planning and original layout of the site" (Drucker et al. 1959: 14; empha­sis added). Importantly, they therefore interpreted the sociopolitical system of La Venta as centralized

and authoritarian from the beginning of the site's major occupation in order to have controlled the labor to build and maintain Complex A-"retain­ing all the while adherence to the centerline ori­entation and symmetrical arrangement off eatures relative to it" (Drucker 1981:32; emphasis added; see Drucker 1981 :32-36; Drucker et al. 1959:269-270; Heizer 1960:218, 1961:46, 1962). In other words, they believed that a formal site plan with a north-south centerline and resulting east-west bilateral symmetry was implemented and maintained over centuries of use, requiring continuous centralized oversight of this ritual land­scape. Labor control was also implicated by the huge quantities of imported stone and the con­struction of the great pyramid (whose building phases remain unknown), but it was more subtly evident in the constant upkeep of the Ceremonial Court, which required caretakers to continually remove wind-borne sand and rainwater (Drucker and Heizer 1965:64). 
In sum, important interpretations of La Venta's (and by extension, Olmec) sociopolitical organi­zation, the role of religious ceremony in political life, and the extent and continuity of politico­economic power at the local and regional levels emerged from the excavators' emphasis on the Complex A architecture-its formal design plan, the patterned consistencies of the offerings, the incorporation of tons of imported stone (Drucker 1947:2-3), and the maintenance of religious prac­tices and beliefs across its distinct construction phases (Drucker and Heizer 1965:63-65). Never­theless, despite the emphasis by the 1955 project on architecture, Diehl (2004:67) recently observed that there has been little discussion of the history, technology, and ritual use of the Complex A struc­tures (exceptions include Diehl 1981; Gillespie 2008). This is due to the fact that acceptance by the archaeological community of the 1955 interpreta­tions was ultimately dependent upon the efficacy of the 1959 report (Drucker et al. 1959) to repre­sent a ceremonial landscape that underwent both routine and dramatic modifications. The descrip­tive portion of the site report is replete with the minutia of stratigraphic details from the trenching operations, accompanied by 81 drawings and 63 photographic plates.6 The monograph was hailed at the time as "an outstanding example of archae­ological description and interpretation, with excel­
lent plans, drawings, and photographs" (Coe 1960:119). In his review MacNeish used the same words: "The excavation of these features is described fully and illustrated by excellent plans, drawings, and photographs" (1960:296). Such glowing praise aside, the excavation report is not an easy read, and the accompanying plans and drawings have multiple problems (detailed below). 
Field conditions required the excavators to aban­don their original research design, which was to clear large horizontal exposures of structures by levels to reveal the changes to the complex over time. Instead, the excavators were forced to rely primarily on trenches to determine the stratigraphic history of the architecture (Drucker and Heizer 1965:38; Drucker et al. 1959:4). It is has since proved impossible to correlate the modifications from one structure to another on a phase-by-phase basis from the descriptions and published strati­graphic drawings (see discussion below). For this and other reasons, Coe and Stuckenrath (1964) rejected the finding of cultural continuity at Com­plex A from Phases I to IV -a key conclusion of Drucker and Heizer (reiterated in Drucker and Heizer 1965 :64-65). Interestingly, the major archi­tectural changes by phase were depicted using a three-dimensional model of Complex A made for the widely disseminated 1963 film The Excavations at La Venta (and see phase-by-phase maps pro­duced from the published data in Dehnhardt 2010:Figures 3.2-3.3; Gillespie 2008:Figures 6 .3-6 .6). Nevertheless, only one plan map of Com­plexA was published, and it incorporates data from all phases of its occupation and postabandonment (Drucker et al. 1959:Figure 4; see Figure 3). The implications of the theory-laden quality of this plan map (and cognate drawings) have generally gone unrecognized since the 1959 report. 

Referred to as the 1955 map (see Heizer, Gra­ham, and N apton 1968: 139, quoted above), its styl­istic canons were influenced by earlier maps of La Venta, the ink drawing and lettering technology of the time, and publication restrictions. Over time the 1955 map underwent a series of changes due to the adoption of new mapping conventions and the addi­tion of previously unknown structures to La Venta's civic-ceremonial core. These maps manifest a chain of relationships, as subsequent drawings were transformations of their predecessors. For exam­ple, certain aesthetic decisions implemented in ear-

lier maps, such as the use of hachures to outline 
Mounds A-2 andA-3, were repeated in later draw­
ings whether or not they best represent the physi­
cal reality or best communicate archaeological 
interpretations of the mounds' forms. 
In reviewing the trajectory of the Complex A 
map in the following section, I am less concerned 
with the technical aspects of mapping conventions 
and more with how the maps have promulgated the­
oretical positions and interpretations of La Venta 
and the Olmecs. My arguments focus on the 
increasing disregard for the Ceremonial Court and 
the collapsing of Complex A's construction history 
into a tangled palimpsest-consequences contrary 
to the 1955 excavators' major findings-as a result 
of misleading representations and simplifications. 
Plan Views of Complex A 
Early Maps 
La Venta was mostly covered in thick scrub forest 
when it first came to archaeological attention (Blom 
and La Farge 1926:82; Drucker 1975: 103). When 
Blom and La Farge briefly visited in 1925, only a 

portion of the site had been cleared for agriculture. 
They were more interested in stone carvings than 
architecture, and the pyramid was the only obvi­
ous structure. Nevertheless, they reported seeing 

the exposed tips of columnar basalt pieces placed 
vertically to form a line. This "fence" (which should 
indicate the edge of the Ceremonial Court) is shown 
on their sketch map as a series of dashed lines form­
ing a partial enclosure north of the pyramid, 
although it is off-center from the pyramid (Figure 
4). The pyramid was given a stepped rectangular 

form with a ramp on its south side (Blom and La 
Farge 1926:82, Figure 68). 
More complete maps of Complex A were made 
' in the early 1940s. In the 15 years since B lorn and La Farge's visit, the area wa<; no longer under cul­tivation, and the entire site was covered with thick vegetation, making it difficult to discern the sizes and shapes of the mounds (Drucker 1952:22).Artist Miguel Covarrubias visited La Ven ta between 1940 and 1942, and in his 1946 book on his travels he ( 1946:91) published a sketch map of the site drawn from memory. His map also incorporates informa­tion provided to him by Stirling based on the 1942 and 1943 excavations. The 1943 project produced

a site map (Figure 2) that accompanied Wedel's report of the Complex A discoveries, not published until 1952 (Drucker 1952:Figure 14). Drucker (1952:22), who first investigated Complex A in 1942, described the Ceremonial Court at that time as an elevated rectangle about 1.5 m high bounded on its east and west sides by basalt columns. How­ever, on the map accompanying the 1943 report this enclosure was shown only as an incomplete line of dots representing the tops of the fence of columns and not as a raised platform (Drucker 1952:Figure 14). The 1946 Covarrubias sketch map also shows the line of columns as dots, but in an idealized state enclosing the entire Ceremonial Court. 
Drucker ( 1952) also described the above­surface structures of Complex A based on his 1942 investigations. Mound A-2 was a gently sloping, rounded mound about 4 m above the modern 
ground surface and 2.5 m higher than the level of the Ceremonial Court. In its eroded state Mound A-2 had an oval footprint (Drucker 1952:9, 22). Mound A-3, south of the Ceremonial Court, was

an elliptical knoll rising only 1.5 to 2 .5 m (Drucker 1952:34). Forming the comers of the southern edge of the Ceremonial Court, the East and West Bas­tions (Southeast and Southwest Platforms) were square in shape, 8 m on a side and 1.5 to 2 m high (Drucker 1952:9). On Wedel's and Covarrubias's maps these last two structures are indicated by the square-shaped enclosures formed of basalt columns on their top surfaces. 
The Covarrubias and Wedel maps depicted sur­face features to which some of the 1942 and 1943 archaeological finds had been added. Lower struc­tures, including the adobe brick court wall, were buried by drift sand (Drucker and Heizer 1965: 38), and the three platforms within the court, less than 1 m high, were not delineated until the 1955 exca­vations. Despite the impression one might get from the maps of the prominence we associate with mon­umentality, these clay structures were characterized by Drucker and Heizer as "little bumps in and around the Court" (1965:39). 
The 1955 Map 
The 1940s maps were generally superseded by the 
1959 publication of the instrument-made 1955 excavation map. That map was published in three different versions (Drucker et al. 1959:Fron­tispiece, Figures 3-4). In the 1950s the pyramid still had not been cleared, so its form was uncertain. It was depicted as quadrangular-as in the earlier sketches of Covarrubias and of Blom and La Farge -by Squier, a research assistant of Heizer' s at the University of California, Berkeley, who was in charge of mapping operations (Drucker et al. 1959:4; see Squier 1964:Figure 4).7 
Figure 4 of the 1959 publication (Figure 3) is a black-and-white foldout plan map, approximately 
45.72 x 30.48 cm (18 x 12 in). It includes a great deal of excavation information and is referred to here as the "base map." Most structures are indi­cated as outlines (footprints), but either relative height or stepped form is indicated uniquely for Mounds A-4 andA-5 by the use of concentric ovals. Outlines of the Southeast and Southwest Platforms and the court wall are not shown. The court itself does not appear to be a raised area, although two sets of horizontally laid columnar basalts that func­tioned as steps leading up to the court's elevated floor are indicated on its south side (see Drucker 1952:Plate 12a). Also shown on the base map are schematic, rectified outlines of the excavation units from the different projects in 1942-1943 and 1955; the locations of stone sculptures ("monuments" and stelae ); five massive offerings or "pavements" of serpentine blocks; and the small dedicatory offer­ings. These last are depicted via symbols (circle, triangle, square) to differentiate the finds accord­ing to their excavation year. A simplified version of the base map was separately presented as Fig­ure 3 in the 1959 report. It depicts only the struc­tures and the general location of the major stratigraphic profiles published elsewhere in the report, although the profiles in the Southwest Plat­form are misleading. A comparison of the two maps (Drucker et al. l 959:Figures 3-4) in the site report reveals that the architecture is not identically drawn in both.8 
In addition to these two plan views, the 1959 publication includes a perspective drawing of Com­plex A with the pyramid (Drucker et al. 1959:Fron­tispiece) that is visually more appealing despite imperfect perspective (Figure 5). The relative size of the pyramid is misrepresented, because at over 30 m high atop a basal platform, it should have been drawn much taller. Features of the perspective drawing are more similar to the site report's sim­ple map (Drucker et al. 1959:Figure 3) than to the complicated base map. However, it provides data not found in either of the plan maps. Importantly, only in the perspective drawing is the wall of the Ceremonial Court depicted as a raised structure several meters wide. On the plan map the wall appears incomplete because it is represented only by the basalt columns, which are indicated by irreg­ular lines of circles symbolizing their top surfaces as seen in bird's-eye view (comparable to the lines of dots in the 1943 map). These Phase IV columns were erected against the inner surface of the Phase II brick wall, and they never completely lined those walls (Drucker et al. 1959: 15, 25-26).9 
The 1955 base map was created for the most part from instrument measurements (alidade[?I and plane table) recorded by Squier to construct his field Map 2 of the architecture and Map 3 of the excavation units.10 The published plans and pro­files were drawn by Eduardo Contreras, a Mexi­can archaeologist who participated in the excavations and produced the ink drawings in 1956 at the University of California, Berkeley, under Heizer's supervision (Drucker et al. 1959:3).

treras adopted some of the mapping conventions used in the 1943 map, including hachures to rep­resent the outlines of Mounds A-2 and A-3. The other mounds on the base map are indicated with plain black lines, dashed to show uncertainty regarding the extent of the Northeast and North­west Platforms and the northern and southern edges of Mounds A-4 and A-5. 
Subsequent Drawings Based on the 1955 Map 
The simple plan map (Drucker et al. l 959:Figure 3) and the perspective drawing (Drucker et al . l 959:Fronstispiece) in the 1959 volume were the basis for subsequent renderings of Complex A, while the complicated base map (Drucker et al. 

1959:Figure 4) showing the excavation units, offer­ings, and monuments has seldom been reprinted in publications on La Venta (cf. Gillespie 2008:Fig­ure 6 .1). An even more simplified plan of Complex A appearing soon afterward in the influential Hand­book of Middle American Indians (Coe 1965b:Fig­ure 2) omitted the walls of the Ceremonial Court, leaving readers to wonder what feature was desig­nated A-1. However, starting in the 1960s text­books and popular books on the Olmecs used some version of the perspective drawing-a three­dimensional visualization-to depict Complex A, and together with the pyramid it represented the site of La Ven ta. A perspective drawing (Figure 6) pre­pared for Coe's book Mexico (l 962:Figure 17)

shares similarities with the drawing in Willey's (l 966:Figure 3-21) seminal synthesis of North American archaeology, both showing the same slight deviations from the 1959 perspective ren­dering.11 In other words, soon afterthe 1959 report appeared, its highly praised maps were set aside, and simplified versions depicting only the major structures were produced to disseminate this spa­tial information. It was not until decades later that some features were added back to Complex A maps, principally the stone sculptures and locations of the massive offerings (e.g., Gonzalez Lauck 1988; Grove 1999; Tate 2008:Figure 2.2) . 
In 1967 and 1968 Heizer directed two short field projects at La Venta to obtain more radiocarbon samples from Complex A, to document or retrieve sculptures that were rapidly disappearing from the site , and to map architectural complexes south of the great pyramid (Heizer 1968; Heizer and Drucker 1968; Heizer, Drucker, and Graham l968a, l 968b; Heizer, Graham, and Napton 1968; ). The 1968 map (Heizer et al. 1968c) came to par­tially supersede the 1955 map (e.g., Bernal l 969:Figure 2; Soustelle l 979:Figure 2). It includes a few large platforms south of Complex A (in Com­plex B), but more notice was given to the new ren­dering of the pyramid, C-1. Finally cleared of vegetation, the pyramid was revealed to have an irregular round, fluted shape (Heizer 1968; Heizer and Drucker 1968; see also Gonzalez Lauck 1997; Graham and Johnson 1979). 
A second major change with the 1968 map is that all of the other architecture is shown as rectilinear (Figure 7). lronically, as the pyramid's actual form was now finally depicted (albeit schematically) as round rather than rectilinear, the actual rounded edges of the Complex A clay platforms became right-angled comers. This change was not baed on any new knowledge of the structures because Com­plex A's surface constructions had already disap­peared by that time. Instead, it reflects the adoption of mapping conventions developed in the early 1960s by Maya archaeologists to record standing stone architecture (Heizer, Graham, and Napton 1968: 139). With these borrowed conventions, rel­ative height is now indicated. Taller structures are drawn as a series of concentric rectangles, such that Mound A-2 looks similar to the pyramid shown in Blom and La Farge's sketch map (Figure 4). How­ever, the difference between nonstepped and stepped platforms is obscured (Mounds A-2, A-4, and A-5 and the South-Central Platform were stepped) . 
Recognizing the artificiality of these new con­ventions, Heizer added a note of caution: "The reader is warned that while the map may show right-angled comers and flat-topped mounds, these features may in fact be rather different" (Heizer, Graham, and Napton 1968: 139). A direct compar­ison with the 1955 base map shows that the 1968 mapmaker squared the original semicircle repre-

senting Mound A-2 on the earlier map, making the diameter of the mound the same as the length and width of a square platform. Mound A-3 was simi­larly transformed from an oval into a rectangle. 
Rather than an improvement on the 1955 map, the 1 968 map significantly misrepresents the sizes and shapes of the platforms. Furthermore, despite the attention to height that is essential to these map­ping conventions, the l .22-m-high (4 ft) Ceremo­nial Court adobe brick walls (Drucker et al. 1959:25) are not shown. The outline of the court is instead symbolized by a line of regular but widely spaced dots to stand for the basalt columns, an ide­alization of an unwieldy reality given that the base map shows that the columns were not widely spaced and had irregular gaps. The court itself is also not depicted as an elevated structure, a rela­tive "acropolis" as the 1955 excavators called it (Drucker et al. 1959:25). 
Some subsequent publications adopted the 1968 map (e.g., Adams 1977:96; Bernal l 969:Figure 2) . New perspective drawings of Complex A were 

. ' made based upon it, one of them treating the arti­ficial mapping conventions quite literally. In the perspective image of Complex A in America 's First Civilization (Coe 1968:64-65), the architecture is given three-dimensional rectilinearity, and Mound A-2 becomes a four-tiered platform with a ramp on its south side (Figure 8). The dots that represented the columns in the plan view were transformed into widely spaced monoliths stuck directly into the ground. In addition , the court is much longer north-south than east-west. This drawing has been 
reprinted several times (e.g., Diehl and Coe 1995:Figure 10; Gonzalez Lauck 2001:798, 2007:50; Porter Weaver 1981:Figure 5; Tabarev 2005:Figure 58), which is one measure of its poten­tial influence to shape ideas about La Venta. How­ever, that rendering competes in recent publications with the perspective drawing that first appeared in the second edition of Coe's Mexico (1977:Figure 17; e.g., Pina Chan 1989:Figure 26). It is a revi­sion of the earlier drawing (Figure 6), substituting the 1968 fluted shape of the pyramid. A very dif­ferent artistically rendered perspective view (Tate 1999:Figures 2 and 5) breaks the chain of Com­plex A drawings by placing the Ceremonial Court in the foreground. It adds information not found in earlier renderings, although like some predecessors it shows Mound A-2 as flat-topped with a round footprint and the pyramid as four-sided, as in the 1959 perspective drawing. 
The Proyecto Arqueol6gico LJi Venta ( PALV) Map 
The Proyecto Arqueol6gico La Venta, begun in 1984 and directed by Rebecca Gonzalez Lauck of Mexico's Instituto Nacional deAntropologfa e His­toria, was the first major project at La Venta fol­lowing Heizer's brief 1960s field visits. The inhabitants of the Villa La Venta settlement that had grown up in the archaeological zone (Heizer 1968) were relocated, and a new series of research pro­grams was initiated, including limited excavations, restoration of additional stone sculptures, and reconnaissance and survey of the surrounding area (Gonzalez Lauck 1988, 1994, 1996, 1997).

topographic site map produced by this project (Gonzalez Lauck l988:Figure 1, l996:Figure 1) shows multiple architectural complexes within the civic-ceremonial core of La Venta. Not all of them date to the Formative period, many structures were destroyed before they could be mapped (Gonzalez Lauck 1996:75), and all the architecture is drawn in schematic fashion (Gonzalez Lauck 1988: 130). 
As know ledge of the larger site has grown, Com­plex A-which with the pyramid long represented all of La Venta-has receded in relative size on maps but not in importance. Most discussions of La Venta still focus on the exotic Complex A arti­facts because the rest of the site is so little known. This creates a problem of visual representation: How does one provide the necessary information locating the important finds (the massive offerings, monuments, tombs, and dedicatory caches) within a spatial field that is much reduced in size in order to display the entire ceremonial center? Despite these changed requirements, archaeologists con­tinue to rely on a single plan map with all the desired information, a practice that goes back to the 1940s maps, and there is renewed emphasis on using plan maps rather than perspective drawings. 
The PALV map was drawn in ink and published as another foldout drawing on a page approximately

than solid lines (Gonzalez Lauck 1988: 130: Fig­ure 9). The basis for this part of the PALV map is the 1955 map together with the 1968 fluted pyra­mid. Mounds A-2 and A-3 are drawn as si mple ovals, despite their height, while linear Mounds A­4 and A-5, which were shorter than Mound A-2. are shown as raised near-rectangles as depicted in the 1968 map. The Ceremonial Court is labeled Feature A-I but is otherwise difficult to distinguish. Its walls are barely indicated by narrow incom­plete lines on its east and west sides, the result of convergence of the tops of the individual basalt columns as the map was reduced in size. The plan of the complex is further complicated by symbols indicating the location of sculptures of different types (monuments, altars, and stelae). This i use­ful information, also found on the 1959 base map, but here it required lines to connect sculptures to their labels, and the labels are so small that they are illegible. In sum, the reduced size of Complex A on the PALV map (less than 4 cm long), the sup­plementary information regarding locations of finds, and the use of dashed lines all make it diffi­cult to see the architecture.Adams's (1991:Map 3­2) revised textbook added a magnified imct of Complexes A and C to a reproduction of the 1988 PALV map to improve the utility of that portion of the map. A simplified version of the 1988 map appears in Gonzalez Lauck (l996:Figure 1),but the Complex A architecture is still very small , and its

details are minimized. This map was redrawn for a recent textbook (Evans 2004:Figure 6 .15), result­ing in the loss of almost all meaningful spatial infor­mation concerning Complex A despite its prominence in the book's discussion of La Venta. 
The reduction in the relative size of Complex A compared to the site as a whole does not explain why some subsequent plan views based on the PALV map leave off entire platforms. Mounds A­2 and A-3, the South-Central Platform, and the Cer­emonial Court are absent in a redrawing of the PALV map (by John Clark, in Gonzalez Lauck I 994:Figure 6.6), and the remaining platforms are incorrectly sized (Figure I0). This later rendering has also been reprinted several times (e.g., Diehl 2004:Figure 28; Gonzalez Lauck 2007:50; Reilly 1999:Figure 1.lb). Illustrations in other publica­tions focusing just on Complex A reveal more care in depicting all the structures, but these plan maps utilize variable conventions: for example, all rec­tified platforms (e.g., Clark and Hansen 200l:Fig­ure J .2) or a combination of rounded and rectified platforms, withMoundsA-2 andA-3 as eitheroval or round (e.g., Diehl 2004:Figure 32; Grove J 997: Figure 4) . 
Summary 
Since the discovery of La Ven ta, maps of Complex A with the adjacent pyramid came to represent the entire site. Ironically, even as Complex A has rightly dimin ished in relative size on maps of La Venta­unfortunately, to the point that entire structures are too small to see or are absent-it still remains the basis for much of the knowledge concerning La Venta archaeology. The subsequent maps reveal a disregard for what the 1955 excavators considered the principal structure of Complex A-the Cere­monial Court-an unintended consequence of deci­sions made in rendering the 1955 map, produced by essentially inking the field map . This elevated platform is depicted only by a minimal boundary reduced to near-invisibility if not complete absence on many re-presentations. Furthermore, the history of thc modifications of the Ceremonial Court through ritual practice over many generations-a major finding of the 1955 excavations-has gen­erally been ignored (notable exceptions are Diehl 2004: Gonzalez Lauck 2007; Pool 2007; Reilly 1999. 2002) or misunderstood, for various reasons that require further discussion.

Representing Change Through Time 
Archaeological maps often depict the structures at a site as if they were all simultaneously in their final or complete state, and the published La Ven ta maps are no different. As discussed in this section, con­ventions adopted for the 1943 and 1955 maps unwittingly enhanced their anachronistic quality. The published profile drawings showing strati­graphic changes to the structures, which could have tempered that impression, have inherent short­comings that have exacerbated misunderstandings or neglect of the stratigraphic information they reveal. 
Anachronism in the Complex A Plan Maps 
The problem of anachronism is especially pertinent to La Venta because chronological information is lacking for much of the site with the exception of Complex A, whose individual history perforce became the history of the entire site. Heizer called La Venta "a one-period site which exhibits four suc­cessive building periods (Phases I-IV)" ( 1959: 178), referring principally to the Ceremonial Court with its different floor series. These four con­struction phases, originally suggested to be a cen­tury long each (Drucker et al. 1957, 1959:267; Heizer [1964:49-50] later admitted that was a sheer guess), were subsequently transformed into archae-

ological phases for the entire site: La Venta I through La Venta IV. As such they appeared on chronological charts alongside archaeological phase names from other sites or regions as if they were structurally equivalent (e.g., Bernal 1969: 107; Grove 1997:Table 2; Lowe 1978:Figure 11.3). Lowe (l989:Table 4.1) designated earlier and later time periods at La Venta as "Pre-Complex A" and "Post-Complex A." Only since the 1990s have sur­vey and excavation projects yielded the more usual phase distinctions for La Venta and its hinterland (e.g., Grove 1997:73). 
Nevertheless, for decades understanding the site's chronology should have hinged on distin­guishing these four (building) phases in the archae­ological images, something that has not been easy to do. The perspective drawings are of no help. The 1955 base map, a totalizing plan view, flattens or "atemporalizes" (following Jones 2001 :352) the modifications to Complex A. In the plan views building outlines, surface and subsurface sculp­tures, buried caches, and excavation units are all depicted together in space and therefore in time. Not surprisingly, some interpretations of static spa­tial patterns have been generated from the plan maps that are not supported by the stratigraphic evi­dence. For example, the three buried mosaic pave­ments (Massive Offerings 1, 4, 5) were interpreted as manifesting an intentional triadic pattern (Reilly 1999:28-29, 2002:35). However, the mosaics date to construction Phases II and IV (Drucker et al. I 959:Table 1), which means that for a considerable period of time there were only two. 
As for the architecture, the prevailing assump­tion is that the published maps and perspective drawings depict Complex A at its final stage of occupation (Gonzalez Lauck 1996:75). In actual­ity, they represent the structures at different stages of their formation and taphonomic transformation. Mound A-2, a stepped rectangular platform (Drucker et al. 1959:Figure 11 ), and Mound A-3 , rectilinear in general form, were capped in Phase IV with a thick layer of red clay, which became eroded and covered with naturally deposited drift sand, resulting in a round to oval footprint. This is how these mounds were first drawn in the 1940s and again in 1955. This convention was repeated in later renderings, including the perspective draw­ings, until the 1968 map, which incorporated numerous misrepresentations of platform shape and size, as noted above. Rejection of the 1968 rec­tilinearization has resulted in a fallback to the rounded shapes of the 1955 base map, but only for Mounds A-2 and A-3. 
Excavations revealed that all of the platforms and the court wall of Complex A were covered with red clay, an action that helps to define Phase IV (Drucker et al. 1959:25). However, on maps the platforms other than Mounds A-2 and A-3 are drawn as they might have looked before the red clay cap was deposited. Information on the form and size of Mounds A-2 and A-3 prior to the red clay deposit was available from the stratigraphic trenches, which formed the bulk of the 1955 fieldwork, but it was not incorporated into the published 1955 map. 
Lowe provided an unusual visualization of Complex A "prior to the placement of the red clay cap" (1989:34, Figure 4.1 a). This drawing shows MoundA-2 as a rectangular platform with two tiers, on top of which the Tomb A structure made of basalt columns and the Tomb B sandstone coffer lie exposed. It also shows the fence of basalt columns and two of the carved stone sculptures. However, Drucker and Heizer had interpreted the placement of the red clay layer and the basalt columns as near-contemporaneous (Drucker et al . 1959:25), and almost all of the sculptures were found lying atop the red clay.12 In spite of good intentions, this map also mixes elements of differ­ent chronological phases. 
The red clay cap has taken on an important role in recent interpretations of La Venta's demise. Reilly ( 1994: 131) and Diehl (2004:69-70) suggest that the dumping of red clay on all the structures was a ritual act heralding the impending abandon­ment of Complex A, an interpretation at odds with the stratigraphic information concerning the tim­ing of the use (and reuse) of the basalt columns. Drucker and colleagues (1959:25) presumed that abandonment of the complex by its caretakers must date to the evident erosion (not depositing) of the red clay as it lay exposed to the elements until it was covered by drift sand; until that time the court surface and structures had been carefully main­tained. The 1955 archaeologists interpreted this withdrawal of stewardship as an abandonment of the site itself, given that Complex A was consid­ered to be central to the operation of La Venta. Their conclusion is now questionable because the much larger civic-ceremonial core could still have

been occupied after Complex A's caretakers ceased their maintenance (Gillespie 2008: 133). 
Dynamic taphonomic processes such as erosion and the deposition of wind-borne sands further con­found attempts to visually represent the physical reality of Complex A as it changed over time. This situation likely contributed to Reilly's (published 1999:20-21) readingofWedel's 1943 profile draw­ing of a trench through Mound A-3 (Drucker 1952:Figure 21) to indicate that the mound was built atop the drift sand that covered the red clay cap. If correct, this structure postdated the major occupation of Complex A, an interpretation repeated by Freidel et al. (1993: 137, Figure 3 .4), whose plan map of Complex A therefore omits Mound A-3 . Problematically, the 1943 profile drawing does not separate the basal sand layer upon which the plat­form was built from the later drift sand (Figure 11 ), a distinction that was difficult for the 1955 archae­ologists to make in the field (Drucker et al. 1959:82). Nevertheless, the 1955 excavations of Mound A-3 dated its construction to Phase I (Drucker et al . 1959: 115-118), and the published 1955 trench pro­file does distinguish the basal and upper sand lay­ers (Drucker et al. l 959:Figure 31 ). Even so, in the 


; 1959 site report the upper (post-Phase IV) drift sand and the basal (pre-Phase I) sand layer were con­sistently given the same designation (stratum "a") in the text and profile drawings, seemingly obliter­ating their temporal distinctions. This is just one of the interpretive difficulties inherent in these draw­ings, as detailed in the following section. 
Visualizing Change Through Time 
via Profile Drawings 

Despite the importance of graphic representations of the Complex A landscape to understand the site's history, the stratigraphic profile drawings have posed major impediments to comprehending change through time. For various reasons, the sim­ple profiles drawn by Wedel in 1943 (in Drucker 1952) cannot be reconciled with those from the 1955 project. Several important images in the 1959 site report are identified as schematic, and even on scaled drawings (e.g., Drucker et al. l 959:Figures 9-12) some details are schematic, especially the thin layers of colored clay that were seldom indi­vidually recorded (Heizer 1964:46). The profile drawings were subjected to a scathing critique by Coe and Stuckenrath in their evaluation of how ineffectively the excavators had warranted their interpretations: 

Any reader of the reports of La Ven ta excava­tion data quickly realizes the problem of check­ing the authors' observations: one report [1959] is in feet, the others in the metric sys­tem; every section seems to differ in published scale, even contiguous or overlapping sections; if sections do in factjoin or overlap there is no way of telling due to the omission of printed horizontal controls [ 1964:4]. 

Certain aesthetic and logistical decisions for cre­ating the drawings decrease the utility of these visu­alization devices. The horizontal and vertical scales are often different in a single drawing, exaggerat­ing the heights of structures and depths of pits in relation to their horizontal extent to fit them on a page (or on a field map). The use of simple black lines against a white background-as opposed to distinguishing strata by adding symbolic patterns such as cross-hatching or pictorial renderings of matrix inclusions-makes it difficult for the eye to trace a single stratum across the page, especially

where the layers are complex and interrupted by pit features. The phase designations-requisite to compare phase changes from one structure to the next-were never included in the drawings them­selves; one must find them in the accompanying text. Fortunately, some of these problems can be ameliorated today with computer imaging soft­ware, for example, equalizing the horizontal and vertical scales and distinguishing the strata using colors or patterns (see the application of color for this latter purpose in Gonzalez Lauck 2007: 50, 52). 
However, the most serious criticism cannot be overcome, namely, that the profile drawings lack vertical and horizontal data or other reference points (Coe and Stuckenrath 1964:4). The pub­lished map showing the location of the major trenches (Drucker et al. 1959:Figure 3) is schematic, and the limits of the excavation units in the 1955 base map (Drucker et al. 1959:Figure 4) are imprecise. In the profile drawings the edges of trench walls and floors are not indicated; the lines separating strata simply end abruptly and unevenly (Figure 12). This makes it difficult to align one drawing with another even where the units were contiguous. Without a vertical datum, the excava­tion units float in space, making it impossible to correlate the vertical positioning of the various pro­file drawings and thereby align the same or equiv­alent strata across the Ceremonial Court. 

The absence of vertical controls resulted from preparing the images for publication, not from incomplete or incompetent fieldwork. Coe and Stuckenrath (1964) did not make this latter accusa­tion explicit, but it was felt by Drucker and Heizer (1965:37; Heizer 1964:46). In fact, the necessary data were recorded to potentially create drawings that would position nearly all spatial relationships in three dimensions. Analysis of the field records reveals that Squier instrument-mapped the horizontal locations of all the 1955 excavation units and recorded ele­vations at approximately 650 points. These spot ele­vations include the depths of most of the floor-series levels across the excavated portion of the court, all major finds (including each in situ basalt column), and the serpentine massive offerings. The field pro­file drawings, while usually not drawn to scale, include measurements that line up rather precisely when redrawn with computer-assisted technology. However, the horizontal spatial relationships in the published base map are more schematic and recti­fied than they appeared in the field (compared to Squier's Map 3).13 More significantly, the elevation information was not utilized when the profiles were drawn for publication. Squier, who controlled the instrument-mapped data, was supposed to have coauthored the response to Coe and Stuckenrath's (1964) critique, but this did not happen (Heizer 1964:45), so the Drucker and Heizer (1965) reply could not directly address this critical issue. 
Based on the profile drawings especially, Coe and Stuckenrath (I964:4-6, Figure 1) challenged the excavators on two of their major interpreta­tions: bilateral symmetry as a major planning prin­ciple from the beginning and the coordinated construction of the Ceremonial Court as an archi­tectural unit. The assumption of bilateral symme­try as a planning rule, evident in the placement of the Phase II Southeast and Southwest Platforms and Phase IV Mounds A-4 and A-5, had been used by the 1955 excavators to good effect.14 When the Phase IV Offering 9 cache was discovered 1 .37 m 

(4.5 ft) west of the centerline, its twin was looked for I.37 m ( 4.5 ft) to the east, and Offering 11, its mirror image, was discovered in that precise loca­tion (Drucker et al. 1959: 177). Similarly, after the Northeast Platform was accidentally uncovered, trenches were dug to search for its likely subsur­face companion, revealing the Northwest Platform (Drucker et al. 1959:51, 63). The size and place­ment of the Northwest Platform were estimated to match those of the better-exposed Northeast Plat­form (Drucker et al. 1959:10). 
Concerning these last two platforms-the only platform pair that exhibited longevity of modifi­cation from Phases I to IV-Coe and Stuckenrath observe that they "are mapped as of equal form and size. Together these structures contribute heavily to the appearance in Complex A of bisymmetrical layout with implied coordinated growth of bal­anced or twin structures" (1964:6). Yet their care­ful study of the profile drawings for both platforms (Drucker et al. 1959:Figures 16, 20-21) showed that the Phase I floor series (the water-sorted floors) appeared under the Northwest Platform (see Fig­ure 12) but lapped up against the facing of the ear­liest construction phase of the Northeast Platform, which was considerably smaller than the (later) first phase of the Northwest Platform. Using the 1955 excavation data Coe and Stuckenrath (1964:Figure 1) thus demonstrated that the North-

LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 22, No. 1, 2011 
appears balanced and symmetrical (1 964:7). Indeed, despite their emphasis on a formal design plan imposed from the beginning of Phase I, Drucker and his colleagues (1959:71) did suggest that the Northwest Platform had been given a major height adjustment in Phase III in order to catch up to the height of the Northeast Platform during that time. They ( 1959:25) also discussed how the Phase IV basalt column "palisade" was probably an orig­inally unplanned necessity, a response to the grow­ing material consequences of increments to the court floors such that the Phase II adobe wall no longer sufficiently enclosed the court. 
Plans vs. Practices 
In response to these criticisms of their interpreta­tions, Drucker and Heizer (1965:42-44), while admitting to "errors in exposition," indicated their continued unwillingness to acknowledge a pre-Phase I construction phase for the entire court-the principal architectural unit -even though there were traces of earlier structures with thin layers of painted clay on their surfaces under both the Northwest Platform and MoundA-2. Com­plex A was built upon an artificially leveled north­to-south-oriented ridge, requiring the removal of earth on the eastern side and buildup of soil on the western side (Drucker and Heizer 1965:43; Drucker et al. 1959: 121). The two earlier structural remains that were found, among possibly other early plat­forms impacted by that leveling, had a different alignment and were thus considered to "indicate a pre-La Venta [sic] complex on the same site" (Drucker et al. 1959:124). In other words, these material traces of earlier ritual actions were inter­preted as something quite different from the planned site layout that was subsequently built. Drucker and Heizer (1965:44) did acknowledge that the Northwest Platform was begun sometime after its "mate" and speculated on why that was so. They discussed "manifest" differences between the two platforms in ritual function, despite their pre­sumed symmetry in size, shape, and court place­ment, lending weight to the possibility that distinct yet complementary rituals were carried out at each. In other words, by focusing on the practices involved in the use of the platforms and their mate­rial effects over time, Drucker and Heizer recog­nized noteworthy variations between them that are invisible on most plan maps of the complex. 
Among these variations arc the placement and type of recovered caches (offerings) within or ad ja­cent to the platforms. The Northwest Platform was less extensively excavated, but it still had propor­tionally fewer offerings compared to the Nmtheast (Druckeretal. 1959:63),as shown on the base map (Drucker et al. 1959:Figure 4) that gives the gen .. era! locations of the caches (Figure 13). There were eight offerings in the Northeast Platform plus Offer­ing 4 just off its west side, versus two in the North­west Platform. Subsequent maps of Complex A eliminated the information on these caches, creat­ing the impression that the two platforms were identical in function as well as form. Moreover, the base map does not indicate the timing or type of cache, and quantitative disparity is not the most important distinction between the offerings in the two structures. Offerings 18 and 19 in the North · west Platform were individual ceramic bowls, only belatedly considered offerings and treated sepa­rately because they were found 68 .6 cm (27 in) apart (Drucker et al. 1959: 191 ). Nevertheless, they had been placed in the same shallow intrusive pit as it was being filled (Drucker et al. 1959: 190), meaning that they were part of the same deposi­tion event during construction Phase II (phase dat­ing of offerings is based on Drucker et al. 1959). In contrast, the Northeast Platform caches were dated to construction Phases I, III , and post-IV, and they include three pseudo-burials (Offerings 5, 6. 7) with green stone ornaments, one of them (Offer­ing 7) dating to Phase I and the other two dating to Phase Ill. The 1955 excavations revealed signifi ­cant differences, in both timing and type of cache, between the two structures. 
Another major distinction between them is invisible in the base map and thus in all subsequent plan views. The base map shows the location of recovered objects treated as offerings, but it does not show the pits that housed the offerings (except for Massive Offering 3) or pits that had no recov­erable objects in them. This might seem like a small detail, but Complex A was riddled with pits start­ing at least as early as Phase II. They are traces of activities as evident as the placement of offerings. The published plan view of the Northeast Platform (Drucker et al. I 959:Figure 14) indicates that its east and west edges were each intruded by three large pits (.91-1.22 m [3-4 ft] in diameter at the top), and three smaller pits were dug along its

Although only about one-third of its estimated extent was excavated, the profile drawings reveal a series of wide and deep pits, intruding into and overlapping each other as shown in a reconstructed plan view (Figure 15). Here the same area was continually dug into, and the depth of the earliest pit extended well below the base of the platform (Drucker et al. l 959:Figure 21).

ing of deposits, the placement and treatment of pit features, the use of organic materials, and the types of nonperishable offerings. 
The overlapping pit features in the Northwest Platform call attention to an aspect of ritual prac­tice that the limitations of the plan maps and draw­ings have made more difficult to appreciate ­namely, the importance ofrepetition in acts ofrit­ual deposition, by which later actions were under­taken in reference to earlier ones. The citation of prior actions as a motivation for subsequent ones is now recognized as an archaeologically visible way to understand the meaningfulness of practices (e.g., Jones 2001; Joyce and Lopiparo 2005). It adopts a perspective for understanding actions, such as the deposition or removal of materials in real time, accounting for social, material , and his­torical contexts and the agency of knowledgeable actors, rather than assuming mere conformity to formal design plans. This point of view engages

the potential of such actions for negotiating or innovating relationships as new materials are brought together in physical association with existing ones, still evident by traces in the ground oras remembered (Pollard 200 I). Offering 4 is a prime example: this Phase III grouping that included 16 figurines and six upright celts was reopened after it had been covered by Phase III floors but before the Phase IV red clay was deposited, exposing only the top portions of the objects before the pit was refilled (Drucker et al. 1959: 154-155).16 

Citation of prior acts was a likely motive for the continued repainting of the structure facades and repeated caching and pitting into the platforms, whether or not these deposits were superimposed, but it is especially suggested by the sequential placement of objects in the same locus. The area of Complex A with the most superimposed offer­ings is within the clay fill over Massive Offering 3

(Figure 13). Massive Offering 3 is composed of six layers of serpentine blocks placed in a deep square pit positioned between the Northeast and Northwest Platforms to the east and west and Mound A-2 and the South-Central Platform to the north and south (Drucker et al. 1959: 130). The pit penetrated Phase II floors and was dated to the beginning of con­struction Phase III; the Phase III old rose floors cov­ered the top of the clay fill (Drucker et al. l 959:Figure 9). As clay was dumped in to fill the great pit, offerings were placed especially over the northern half of the serpentine blocks along the court centerline. The excavators believed that this area "was regarded as an especially propitious place for offerings" and suggest that physical markers or records were kept of their locations because of the superpositions of many objects (Drucker et al. 1959: 132). 
On the Complex A published base map (Drucker et al. 1959:Figure 4), symbols (circle, triangle, square) show the general locations of all the recov­ered offerings, but they cannot well indicate super­positions. Tiny arrows were used to indicate that two symbols drawn side by side referenced objects that occupied the same horizontal space (Figure 13). The profile drawings (Drucker et al. l 959:Fig­ures 9-10) reveal that Offering 1943-C lies below Offering 1943-A (not directly so); Offering 10 was placed precisely below Offering 8; Offering l lies directly below Monument 13, a columnar basalt post erected vertically just in front of the south edge of Mound A-2; and Offering 1943-D was found slightly offset below a pit from which an ear­lier post (in front of a prior construction phase of MoundA-2) apparently had been removed. In addi­tion, Offering 2 lies directly under a series of thin layers of colored clay and sand stacked atop one another forming an "apron" in front of Mound A­
2. Although the ultimate positioning of the sculp­tures was dated to Phase IV, most of the caches are in the Phase III fill (Offerings 1, 2, 8, 10, 12, 1943­C, 1943-D). Almost all of these offerings consist of formal arrangements of jade and serpentine celts. This situation is different from that of the numer­ous Phase III caches in the Northeast Platform, which also exhibited far fewer superpositionsP 
A Historical Sh(ft in Spatial Orientation 
Understanding these placements as performance and as citation, taking into account their inherent temporality and historicity, presents an alternative way of understanding the claim by the excavators (Druckeretal. 1959: 14, 133) ofalong-liveddesign plan for Complex A based on a north-south cen­terline orientation, a consequence of which was an east-west symmetry of architecture and offerings. In their view, if there had not been a plan. Com­plex A would have been a "helter-skelter, fortuitous. opportunistic, or accidental melange of elements" (Drucker and Heizer 1965 :41), which it clearly was not. Nevertheless, as Coe and Stuckenrath ( 1964:6) observed, the point is not whether such a center­line orientation is manifest in the final placement of structures and offerings but, rather, whether it is best understood as the fulfillment of an a priori plan for this built landscape. 
The centerline orientation was considered by the 1955 excavators to manifest an explicit rule requir­ing strong leadership to prevent its aberration over the centuries (Drucker 1981 :32). Heizer( 1959: 179) further suggested that a centerline focus for ritual activities was a characteristic trait of Olmec cul­ture, for which only La Venta was well known at that time. The assumption at the root of these inter­pretations is that when the Ceremonial Court area was leveled by cutting and filling operations, the chiefs or religious leaders of La Venta shared a template for a new ceremonial precinct that they and generations of their successors directed sub­ordinates to execute. Phase IV constructions were thus the products of intentions already evident in Phase I; what we see on the map is the result of what was planned before anything was built. Drucker and Heizer (Drucker et al. 1959: 124) fur­ther believed that this design plan demonstrated a cultural break with the pre-Phase I platfom1 rem­nants they found in a different alignment, even though the same kinds of practices (painting col­ored layers on the clay platform surfaces) were evi­dent. This assumption supported their argument for cultural continuity from Phase I to IV, which was contested by Coe and Stuckenrath (Drucker and Heizer 1965:63-65). Significantly, temporal modifications were rendered invisible in their 1955 base map, reinforcing the idea that the same design rules resulted in similar practices to build and mod­ify Complex A. 
Barrett (1994, 1999; Barrett and Ko 2009) describes how similar notions have influenced the interpretation of monumental ritual landscapes in

Neolithic Britain, but he suggests an alternative 
scenario-that "monumentality originated in nei­
ther the idea nor the plan, but rather in the practice 
and in the project" (1 994:23 ). Recent relationist the­
ories reject the conventional notion that building 
is "a simple process of transcription, of a pre­
existing design of the final product on to a raw 
material substrate" (Ingold 1995:76). Instead, 
thoughts and ideas emerge from engagement with 
the material world as humans interact in knowl­
edgeable and intentional ways with its physical 
properties (e.g., Boivin 2008: 14; Ingold 
1995:75-78; Miller 2005:38; Thomas 2001 :172). 
As Barrett (1994:23, 1999:255-256) has further 
explained, simple principles of spatial order, such 
as orientation to the cardinal directions, or physi­
cal features, such as a natural north-south ridge, 
could have been brought to bear in material prac­
tices. By these means immanent values became 
articulated in certain concrete forms-in the case 
of La Venta, practices associated with erecting the 
low court walls on the east and west and the earli­
est structures. Once extant, these constructions and 
the values they concretized created "a new set of 
material conditions which life was then faced with 
having to accommodate" (Barrett 1999:257), 
becoming the necessary and even taken-for-granted 
conditions of future practices (see Joyce 2004 for 
a Formative Mesoamerican example). This alter­
native scenario requires a theoretical shift, which 
is incommensurate with the theories promulgated 
by the existing maps of La Venta. 
The Phase I and II structures -Mounds A-2 and 
A-3, the wall, the Northeast and Northwest Plat­
forms, the South-Central Platform, and the South­
east and Southwest Platforms (Drucker et al . 
l 959:Table I )-do not manifest a predominant 

north-south orientation as much as a four-sided , arrangement, although the pyramid (whose origins 
' are uncertain) to the south may have been an addi­tional focal point. Moreover, known Phase I and II caches were discovered from the east and west buildings, especially the extraordinary Phase II massive offerings under the Southeast and South­west Platforms. East and west are the principal ori­enting directions in Mesoamerican cosmology, marking the daily path of the sun. Despite excava­tion of the wide north-south trench through the center of Complex A, nothing found on the cen­terline dated to Phases I or II (Gillespie 2008:Table 6.2). Significantly, Drucker suggested that "if any Phase I offerings occurred along the centerline, they may have been removed in Construction Phases III and IV in the excavation of the pits for Massive Offerings 3 and 2" in the northern part of the court (1981 :36); indeed, he and Heizer may have assumed that there had been such offerings. 
Nevertheless, from the excavation findings themselves-which formed the basis of the pre­sumption of the centerline's importance for plac­ing offerings-no centerline caches dated to before Phase III, and the Phase III offerings were discov­ered only over the clay fill above Massive Offer­ing 3. This largest of the five massive offerings was the first known to be located on the centerline, pos­sibly occupying the last, central open space in the court created by the platforms occupying its east, west, and south sectors. The final two massive offerings were also positioned on the centerline, north and south of Massive Offering 3 and outside the Ceremonial Court, in Phase IV. 
Again, based on the excavation data, the place­ment of Massive Offering 3 seems to have heralded an important spatial shift in the burial of caches, although offerings were also placed in the North­east Platform in Phase III. However, all of the Phase IV offerings were recovered on the centerline, an apparent citational reference to the Phase III shift in ritual deposits , perhaps in concert with an imposed "forgetting" of the earlier offerings of Phases I and II and an intentional and physically marked "remembering" of Phase III Offering 4. Furthermore, with one possible exception, Phase IV materials were placed outside the Ceremonial Court, within MoundsA-2 andA-3, which yielded no earlier offerings, and Mounds A-4 and A-5 also date to this phase (Gillespie 2008:Figure 6.6). Despite the spatial emphasis on the centerline yet away from the Ceremonial Court in Phase IV, the post-Phase IV caches (mostly pottery vessels placed in the accumulating drift sand) reveal a reori­entation, with the majority of them off the center­line and some of them within the court confines. In sum, the complex chronology of events revealed in the excavation data indicates that the north-south orientation and bilateral symmetry may be more comprehensively understood as the historical and material outcomes of generations of ritual prac­tices rather than as evidence of original design plans for the building of structures and the placement of

offerings. That singular design is most apparent when the architecture and caches are atemporalized and reduced to simple outlines and symbols on a map. 
Summary and Conclusions 
This investigation of how La Venta has been rep­resented in maps and related drawings since its dis­covery and how those depictions continue to shape current understandings of the site illustrates some of the challenges archaeologists face in confronting "the imaging of archaeological knowledge" (Moser and Smiles 2005: 1). Since the 1940s La Ven ta has been represented as an arrangement of platforms depicted via a simple plan map or perspective draw­ing. The 1955 excavations revealed subsurface plat­
forms and demonstrated the sequence of modifications to Complex A over time. However, the base map printed in the 1959 site report (Drucker et al. 1959:Figure 4) reduced the com­plexity of its architecture to structural footprints, some of which are missing or incomplete. The embedded anachronism of the platforms' building stages and caches on that map was never adequately acknowledged. Coe and Stuckenrath's (1964) cri­tique received little attention, and much of it was directed to challenging the dating and construction history of Complex A, which for their own reasons they chose to interpret as culturally discontinuous. The base map supported Drucker and Heizer's ( 1965) opposing opinion that La Venta was a "one­period site" with obvious cultural continuity in its design plan.As such it was a representation of their theory, even as it undercut their ability to convince other archaeologists of the importance of the Cer­emonial Court, its modifications over time, and their other argument for continuity, namely, the constant upkeep and similarity of ritual practices through its construction phases (Drucker and Heizer 1965:64). 
As new mapping conventions were adopted (the 1968 rectilinearization) and as the extent of La Venta's civic-ceremonial core was revealed (the PALV map), further inaccuracies were introduced in depicting Complex A, even as its spatial context within greater La Venta was made evident. Com­plex A's surface features had already been destroyed, such that the maps had to speak for that no longer extant architecture. Over time, increas­ingly simplified maps substituted for a complex reality they were supposed to re-present. Early on only surface forms were typically depicted, even though much of La Venta's "architecture" was sub­surface (e.g., Tate 1999:Figures 2 and 5). In some recent publications entire structures have been omitted, destroying or reshaping the design plan that was once highlighted as integral to the cos­mological and sociopolitical significance of Com­plex A. 
The Ceremonial Court-painstakingly built up through countless acts of ritual deposition and extraction and constantly maintained-was con­sidered the principal architectural feature of Com­plex A by the 1955 excavators. However, it is depicted only in pieces on the published base map: the outline formed by the tips of some of the still­standing Phase IV basalt columns that incompletely lined the interior of its walls, an isolated drawing of the stone facing on the wall at the northeast entry, and basalt column "steps" on its south side whose function appears quite ambiguous given that no change in elevation is shown. On some drawings the court has virtually disappeared, although it has been plainly evident in the perspective views since the 1959 report (Drucker et al. 1959:Frontispiece, Figure 23). The absence from the plan views of the court as a built-up platform bounded on its east and west sides by a wide, adobe brick wall embellished with dressed stone blocks helps to explain why subsequent archaeological discussion has tended to disregard the court as an architectural unit. In fact, some descriptions (Diehl 2004:67; Gonzcilez Lauck 1988:131, 1996:76) refer to the long-lived Cere­monial Court as merely a "north court," with the space between Phase IV Mounds A-4 andA-5 con­sidered an equivalent "south court." This interpre­tation is drawn from the atemporality of the La Venta maps, focusing on the nearly identical appearances of these two adjacent locales as enclosed spaces while ignoring critical differences in time and in ritual practices. 
The relative neglect of the construction phases of the Ceremonial Court and its appendage plat­forms is also an expected consequence of the syn­chronic quality of the base map, which depicts all of the caches as if they were simultaneous and por­trays the platforms at different stages of their use lives. In preparing the map for publication, a deci­sion was made to indicate the dedicatory offerings

with symbols denoting the year of their excavation. This decision matches the organization of infor­mation in the 1959 site report, in which the 1955 offerings were labeled and described separately from the 1942 and 1943 finds (Drucker et al . 1959:Appendix 1 ). If, instead, symbols indicating the building phase for each offering had been utilized-data available in the text and profile 

rawings-a very different understanding of the chronology of Complex A may have resulted. 
In sum, Drucker, Heizer, and Squier argued in the 1959 report and later publications for the fol­lowing interpretations: (I)the primacy of the Cer­emonial Court, Feature A-1 ; (2) the sequence of the court's modification through four distinct con­struction phases; and (3) the imposition by La Venta's leaders of two formal design principles from the beginning, namely, (3a) bilateral (east-west) symmetry as a product of (3b) a dom­inating centerline (north-south) orientation. Iron­ically, the first two arguments have tended to be 
ignored by subsequent scholarship because the 
visualization devices that would allow archaeolo­
gists to "see" them in the appropriate ways were 
flawed. However, the third argument for bilateral 
symmetry and a centerline orientation for mounds 
and caches is enhanced by the simplified plan maps. 
Thus these characteristics and the interpretations 
they support -produced and communicated by the 
map-continue to be highlighted in discussions of 
Complex A. 
However, as Coe and Stuckenrath (1964) sug­
gested early on, and as I discussed further here, 
bilateral symmetry and the emphasis on the cen­
terline need to be considered separately rather than 
as the manifestation of a single ordering principle. 
They are more comprehensively understood as con­

sequences of the complicated history of ritual use . of this sacred locale, a topic that has tended to be ' 
ignored (see also Gillespie 2008). The excavation data suggest that what the earlier inhabitants did to this nonquotidian landscape impacted the knowl­edge and intentions of their successors, both limit­ing and enabling subsequent changes, as Drucker and Heizer (Drucker et al. 1959:25, 127) acknowl­edged. Nevertheless, archaeological attention to the dynamic temporality of the platforms' use on a human scale is hindered by the emphasis on formal design rules and the supposition that adherence to them explains how Complex A, and by implication, 
the political structure of La Venta, came to be. 
This critical investigation of the Complex A maps has evaluated them for their sufficiency in re-presenting the archaeological evidence recorded during excavations, adopting the position that maps are presentations of theories (Moser 1992:831, 837). I have drawn attention to shortcomings where, intentionally or otherwise, the maps and drawings have supported or subverted the inter­pretations of the original excavators and later com­mentators. Because the Complex A landscape is destroyed (although some deep deposits may still be intact), there are many things we will never know about it. Nevertheless, despite Heizer's pes­simism, the published 1955 map can be improved by consulting the field records and by employing visualization technology not available at that time. The adoption of alternative theories should also result in modifications to the 1955 map to promote those theories. Even as the craft of mapmaking is facilitated by technological innovations in equip­ment and software, and as flexible digitized draw­ings replace those printed on paper, archaeologists need to be attuned to the theory-laden quality of maps and the limitations introduced by mapmak­ing and publishing conventions that may impede our ability to visualize and interpret the archaeo­logical record. These same advances make it pos­sible to move beyond maps as distanced and atemporalizing representations of the plans of struc­tures and landforms and to devise images, for exam­ple, using video (e.g., Van Dyke 2006), virtual reality (e.g., Forte and Siliotti 1997), and interac­tive multimedia (e.g., Webmoor 2005), that aid in understanding the practices that connected people to their world (Gillings 2005:230). Such an approach to the "mapping" of Complex A would more comprehensively communicate how this dynamic ritual landscape came into being and was changed through material acts, how it was experi­enced by its caretakers over time , and how it influ­enced the historical processes of their inhabitation.

2. 
This work is part of an ongoing project I am directing, "The Architectural History of La Venta Complex A: A Reconstruction Based on the 1955 Field Records." A few of the new images created from field records were presented in Gillespie et al. 2009. Recourse to the field notes is necessary because the published maps present many impediments to creating a digitized map of La Venta (e.g., Sandoval 2004). 

3. 
The dating of Complex A and its building phases (I-IV) is not discussed here. The 400-year span derived from radio­carbon dates obtained in 1955 (Drucker et al. 1957, 1959:264-267) and 1967 (Heizer, Graham, and Napton 1968) was revised to indicate occupation from 1000 to 600 B.C. uncalibrated (Berger et al. 1967:5). However, there are diffi­culties interpreting the carbon samples in terms of their con­texts and whether they sort out four distinct building phases (Berger et al. 1967:5; Coe and Stuckenrath 1964; Grove 1997:72). Another problem is that the calibration with calen­dar years is not straightforward between 800 and 450 B.C. (Pool 2007: 160). Diehl (2004:69) suggests that the use of Complex A lasted perhaps only 100-150 years. There are no reliable chronological sequences from the ceramic, strati­graphic, or sculptural data to date changes and building events within the 400-to 500-year time span of occupation at La Venta's ceremonial center (Gonzalez Lauck 1996:73; Grove 1997:73; Pool 2007:158). 

4. 
The "tombs" are "surrogate" burials, as Drucker and Heizer (1965:56-57) later clarified (see Wedel's "gravelike deposit," in Drucker 1952:64). All but one lacked human remains, at least some of which would have survived if pre­sent (Drucker and Heizer 1965:57), and the costume orna­ments they contained were arranged too perfectly to have once been attached to a decaying corpse. Some of the other offerings have also been interpreted as less elaborate pseudo­burials (Gillespie 2008:Table 6.2; Joyce 2000:44-45). Tomb A yielded two compact "packaged" assortments of disarticu­lated bones, neither one indicative of a complete skeleton, interpreted as bundle burials (Drucker and Heizer 1965:57). The bones may have been considered part of the cache objects rather than the skeletal remains of principal grave occupants. 

5. 
In 1943 Wedel (in Drucker 1952:60-61) excavated what appeared to be another platform just east of the Southeast Platform on the south edge of the Ceremonial Court, perhaps 4 x 7 m in extent, made of adobe bricks and topped with basalt columns. He believed that it might have a twin on the west side, but the 1955 excavations showed that it did not. This structure did not receive a designation and was dismissed as a "late modification of the original plan of the Complex" (Drucker et al. 1959: 10). It was not formally mapped except as a line of six basalt columns (Drucker et al. 1959:Figure 4). 

6. 
Unfortunately, a major portion of the north-south Mound A-2 trench profile drawn in 1943 was lost (Wedel, in Drucker 1952:61), and the northernmost section of the 1955

LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 22, No. 1, 2011] 
trench was not recorded (Drucker et al. 1959:47). The north­ern limit of the tallest structure in Complex A thus remains unknown (Drucker et al. 1959:298). 
7. 
Squier was subsequently criticized in print for render­ing the pyramid, covered in forest in 1955, as rectilinear. Heizer (1968: 17) acknowledged with regret the "egregious errors" concerning the pyramid's shape in the 1959 report but placed the blame squarely on a surveyor in charge of map­ping it. Similar comments naming Squier as that surveyor appear in Heizer and Drucker (1968:52). Bernal followed suit, expressing contempt for the "presumably competent sur­veyor" (1969:35). Squier's typed notes to accompany his draft Map 1 of Complexes A and C (Maps Folder, Heizer Papers, NAA) indicate that he and Heizer conducted instru­ment and tape measurements of the pyramid during the last week of the field project, which runs counter to the impres­sion in Heizer and Drucker (1968:52) that its mapping was solely Squier's responsibility. 

8. 
Figure 3 in Drucker et al. 1959 shows the Southeast and Southwest Platforms as raised elevations, whereas in Figure 4 they are indicated only by lines of circles represent­ing the tops of the basalt columns that ringed the central part of their upper surfaces. The basalt column fence around the Ceremonial Court is presented in an idealized complete state in Figure 3, whereas Figure 4 shows that there were gaps in the fence and many of the columns were out of alignment. Figure 3 also fails to bring the northeast side of the wall all the way to the edge of Mound A-2 as shown in Figure 4. 

9. 
Similar to Figure 3 in Drucker et al. (1959), the per­spective drawing does not extend the wall on its northern side all the way to the edge of Mound A-2. The South-Central Platform is much longer in the perspective drawing than in the plan views, and that drawing also includes a bounded rec­tangle in the space between the South-Central Platform and the Southwest and Southeast Platforms that does not appear on the plan views. On the drawing a third set of basalt column "steps" has been added to the south end of the court to intro­duce symmetry.

11. These two 1960s drawings depict the bounded rectan­gle between the Southeast and Southwest Platforms as a dis­tinct elevated platform with a single stairway or ramp in the center of its south side. They also show the square ring of basalt columns as more complete on both the Southeast and Southwest Platforms. Mound A-2 is about the same size as Mound A-3. 
12. 
Drucker and Heizer (1965:63) acknowledged that the sculptures may have been reset from pre-Phase IV locations or moved during or after Phase IV, such that their strati­graphic positions as found by archaeologists are not a reliable guide to their original erection. 

13. Maps Folder, Heizer Papers, NAA. 


14. 
According to a grant proposal to help fund the 1955 excavations, Drucker and Heizer planned to excavate only one-half of the court on the assumption that the other half would provide duplicate information because of the already evident bilateral symmetry.

16. 
Because of inconsistent and misleading section draw­ings (Drucker et al. 1959:Figures 16-17, 39), Coe and Stuckenrath (l 964:28) doubted that Offering 4 had been opened for inspection. In their response Drucker and Heizer admitted to "our own errors of presentation" in the drawings and their failure to carefully proofread the work of their draftsman, upon whom they "relied heavily" ( 1965:61 ). They nevertheless effectively refute the criticism, and the field records leave little doubt that the pit had been filled, partially opened, and refilled. 

17. 
Heizer recorded Phase III Offering 6 (a pseudo-bur­ial) in the Northeast Platform as positioned a few centimeters above a Phase I ceramic bowl (Offering 15) (Drucker et al. 1959: 189; Field Notes, Heizer Papers, NAA). The vertical relationship of these two caches is reversed in the published profile drawing (Drucker et al. I 959:Figure 18).
