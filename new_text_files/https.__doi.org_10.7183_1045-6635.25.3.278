ALLUVIAL STRATIGRAPHY AND THE SEARCH FOR PRECERAMIC 
OPEN-AIR SITES IN HIGHLAND MESOAMERICA

The Preceramic archaeological record of highland Mesoamerica is biased toward rocks helter sites. We advocate more field­work in streamside settings, where open-air sites are likely to be found for reasons related both to the systemic context of hunter-gatherer lifeways and to the geoarchaeological context of site burial and preservation . Predicting site location requires attention to the peculiar nature and behavior of incised ephemeral streams (barrancas) and to the complex alluvial stratigraphic sequences that they leave behind. Four case studies-from the Mexican states ofTlaxcala, Mexico, Morelos, and Oaxaca-reconstruct the geometry and age structure of late Quaternary alluvium from exposures in cutbanks, brickyards, and purposefully dug trenches. We identify deeply buried locales with the remains of extinct megafauna, intentionally set 
fires, and lithic debitage. We distinguish between geographical areas, stream reaches, and time intervals that do or do not hold much promise for further research. The fragmentary nature of the alluvial record and the paucity of sites can be explained by changes in stream behavior wrought by agricultural land use and are conditioned by the intensity and antiquity of agriculture in any given area. Deposits and sites of Paleoindian age may be more commonly preserved than those of Archaic age. 
El registro arqueol6gico del Precerdmico en las tierras altas de Mesoamerica sufre de un sesgo a favor de los abrigos rocosos. En aras de revertirlo, proponemos dirigir mayores esfuerzos a los sitios a cielo abierto en ambientes jluviales que aun no han sido descubiertos. Su presencia y buena conservaci6n se explican tanto por el contexto sistemico en el que fueron ocupados por grupos de cazadores-recolectores, como por el contexto geoarqueol6gico en el que fueron sepultados. Anticipar su ubicaci6n requiere que prestemos mds atenci6n a las peculiaridades geomorfol6gicas de las barrancas y a las complejas secuencias estratigrdficas que producen. Cuatro estudios de caso, en los estados mexicanos de Tlaxcala, Mexico, Morelos y Oaxaca, reconstruyen la geometrfa y edad de aluviones del Cuaternario tardfo con base en cortes expuestos en las paredes de las barrancas, ladrilleras y trincheras que excavamos nosotros. ldentificamos algunos lugares con evidencia de megafauna extinta, uso intencional delfuego y talla Utica. Distinguimos entre regiones, tramos del mismo rfo y periodos que tienen mucho 
o poco potencial. La escasez y el aislamiento de /os dep6sitos aluviales y sitios de edad precerdmica se deben a los cambios hidrol6gicos provocados por la agricultura y guardan una relaci6n con la intensidad y antigiiedad de la misma. Los dep6sitos que corresponden al periodo Paleoindio parecen ser mds comunes que los de! Arcaico .

ture of the known archaeological record and the way archaeology is done. The "before" is referred to by Mexican archaeologists as prehistoria or etapa Utica. Anglophone researchers prefer the term Preceramic , subdivided at its most basic into the Archaic and the earlier Paleoindian. All these labels are problematic, but they acknowledge an archaeological reality. Formative sites number in the thousands , and many have been located through systematic regional surface surveys. If we exclude isolated finds of projectile points, lo­cales where paleoecological studies suggest hu­man activity, and finds of extinct megafauna with dubious evidence of human presence, there are probably no more than a hundred Preceramic sites in the whole of Mesoamerica known today. Their discovery has often been fortuitous. 
The Preceramic period in Mesoamerica is key for understanding such important topics as the peopling of the Americas or the origins of agri­culture. The pioneers who championed its study ­Luis Aveleyra Arroyo de Anda, Jose Luis Lorenzo, and Richard MacNeish-grasped early on the importance of interdisciplinary collabora­tion, but after 1970 the pace of discovery slack­ened. As MacNeish (1981 :46) observed with the irony of the successful old-timer, "more and more survey in Mesoamerica has become dependent on statistical sampling techniques, with the sur­prising result that fewer and fewer Preceramic sites have been discovered since our endeavors in Tehuacan." Today, progress in disciplines orig­inally brought in to aid archaeology has outpaced archaeological field exploration and is driving the research agenda. Examples include new stud­ies on the genetics of American populations (Meltzer 2009: 161-170), the phylogeny of maize (Doebley 2004), historical linguistics (Hill 2001), or paleolimnological signals of maize dispersal and ecological disturbance (reviewed in Lesure 2008). Their authors issue largely unheeded pleas to archaeologists to corroborate or refute their claims with evidence from habitation sites, or to provide new samples of ancient bone or plant tis­sue to work on. Debates, intellectually stimulating as they may be (e.g., Webster 2011), often boil down to the question of whether the absence of evidence is yet sufficient to be regarded as evi­dence of absence. We side with McClung de Tapia (2011) on this issue, answering, "Not yet." The odds are set so strongly against the preservation and discovery of Preceramic deposits that any inferences based on the absence of certain cate­gories of ecofact or artifact must remain suspect. In sum, we believe that, today, the largest obstacle to progress in understanding the Preceramic is simply the lack of new sites to work on. 
The small number of known Preceramic sites is not due simply to the low number of re­searchers, the low priority afforded by cultural heritage management, and the perception that the glamour of Mesoamerican archaeology starts with the Olmecs. Preceramic sites are indeed very dif­ficult to find. We realize this, having examined over the last 20 years late Quaternary deposits in the Basin of Mexico, Tlaxcala, Morelos, Guerre­ro, Michoacan, Oaxaca, Guanajuato, Zacatecas, and Huehuetenango. This article is based on the premise that there is something to be learned from our repeated failure to locate Preceramic sites, as well as from our few hits. We argue that greater attention should be given to alluvial set­tings. By contrasting examples taken from our research, we try to identify geological conditions that may diminish or enhance site preservation or visibility along different stream reaches and in different subareas of highland Mesoamerica. We limit our discussion to the highlands because stream size and behavior are radically different in the lowlands and because lowland archaeolo­gists seem more aware of the effects of alluviation on site preservation and visibility (Ortiz and Cyphers 1997; von Nagy 1997; Voorhies and Kennett 1995). 
Why Look along Streams? 
In many parts of the world, the earliest occupa­tions are known mostly from caves or rockshel­ters , and a distinction is drawn between those and so-called open-air sites. More often than not, the latter are a scarce commodity. The bias is par­ticularly strong in highland Mesoamerica, not only because of the numbers of sites involved, but also because of the excellent preservation of organic remains in the dry rockshelters excavated by the Tehuacan and Valley of Oaxaca projects. Both projects also looked for open-air sites along streams, but each ended up excavating only one of Preceramic age-Ts381 and Gheo-Shih, re-

spectively. Another place where comparing a set of rockshelters has provided important insights is the Ocozocoautla Valley (Acosta 2010; Garcia and Santamaria 1982; MacNeish and Peterson 1962). In contrast, open-air sites tend to be in­vestigated individually. Only along the former lakeshores of the Aguacatenango basin was more than one open-air locus dug (Garcia 1982; Gue­vara 1981). This bias matters because of both the systemic context of the behavior of Preceramic groups and the geoarchaeological context of the formation processes of Preceramic sites. 
The specter of "cavemen" has haunted hunter­gatherer archaeology worldwide. We know today that few human groups chose caves or rockshel­ters as their main abodes. For the most part, these were special-purpose camps occupied during a fraction of the year by small task groups, rather than by the whole band (see Binford 1980). The residential base where people spent more time or congregated in larger groups was likely to be elsewhere, often close to a stream. This was rec­ognized in Tehuacan even before Ts38 L was ex­cavated (MacNeish 1964), and the sharp distinc­tion between this site and rockshelter camps persisted through later publications. The inter­pretive weight of the half-a-pithouse preserved under the alluvium of a small tributary of the Rio Salado at Ts381 comes into focus once we realize that it became the basis for hypothesizing the ex­istence of a whole category of sites-called var­iously "linear valley hamlets," "hamlet-central bases," "semi-permanent hamlets," and "water­way hamlets" (MacNeish 1971a, 197 lb; Mac­Neish et al. 1975). It also became the single piece of evidence proving a shift toward sedentism in the Abejas phase, as well as the model for the widely reproduced reconstruction of a Preceramic village in the Museo Nacional de Antropologia. In Oaxaca, Gheo-Shih, located on a terrace of the Mitla River, was similarly cast as a meeting point for macrobands at a time of plenty when riparian mesquites ripened (Flannery et al. 1981; Flannery and Spores 1983). In a lowland example, Vuelta Limon, Chiapas, the only excavated site that was buried under alluvium, is placed at the center of the settlement pattern as the residential base of the group (Voorhies 2004:397-417). The posited systemic importance of Ts38 l, Gheo­Shih, and Vuelta Limon, however, contrasts with 
the paucity of recovered artifacts and ecofacts in comparison with the peripheral rockshelter or shellmound sites. 
There are many reasons why alluvial settings should have been important to Preceramic life­ways. A seminal article on the origins of agricul­ture in Mesoamerica (Flannery 1973) mentions the "humid barranca-piedmont habitat" as a place where the wild ancestors of several cultivars grew in above-average densities, together with other plants that were collected for food or for tool manufacture but never domesticated. MacNeish (198 1) acknowledged very much the same when he used terms such as "hydro-horticulture" or "barranca agriculture." We imagine that the in­tentional propagation of these cultivars beyond their native habitats followed barranca floodplains as the nearest equivalent of the setting in which they had first been manipulated. Worldwide, floodplains are often the corridors along which domesticates and associated land-use practices diffuse (Bogaard 2004; Delcourt and Delcourt 2004). They were attractive to both game and humans because of the absence of mature forests and the natural openness and richness of their plant communities. Additionally, drinking water was a patchy resource in the strongly seasonal and predominantly semi-arid climates of the high­lands. Even where streambeds did not support continuous flow, following them was a depend­able way of locating springs or seeps. The often deeply incised valleys offered sheltered camping grounds throughout the dry season, when there was little risk of flooding. Near the end of the Preceramic, Flannery (1973) again points to floodplains, this time as the crucial locus where the clearance of mesquite groves made room for the first permanent maize fields. 
Even when archaeologists realize the systemic importance of alluvial settings, they keep return­ing to rockshelters because they are relatively safe bets in terms of preservation. Once formed, cave deposits can be relatively immune to whole­scale removal. In some, however, spring vents periodically flush out the deposits, leaving hia­tuses in the record that may go unrecognized. Researchers are also coming to appreciate that post-occupational disturbance of cave sediments is the norm rather than the exception (Faugere 2006). Nonetheless, the taphonomy of the dry

caves of highland Mesoamerica has not yet re­ceived the kind of attention lavished on limestone caves in temperate zones of the Old World by several generations of archaeologists (Laville et al. 1980). 
Open-air sites in lacustrine settings in Mesoamerica are also plagued by low sedimenta­tion rates, except where the lakeshore is juxta­posed with a steep slope, as at Tlapacoya (Lorenzo and Mirambell 1986; Niederberger 1976), or en­croached upon by stream deltas, as along the east­ern shore of Lake Texcoco (Frederick 1999; Sedov et al . 2010) or Lake Chalco. Paleoecologists work­ing on the lake basins of the Neovolcanic Axis often have to contend with hiatuses in deposition and even periods of deflation (Frederick 1996; Metcalfe 1997; Metcalfe and Davies 2007), which affect the stratigraphic record most severely in the near-shore settings where human occupation is most likely. The climates of highland Mesoamerica are generally not arid enough for the alternating accumulation of evaporites and elastic sediments typical of lakeshores further north (Waters 1992:222-229). In contrast, the pace of aggradation along streams can be very rapid, along both low-and high-order reaches. We have examined dozens of exposures in which the Holocene alone is represented by more than 10 m of alluvium. The episodic nature of flooding and alluvial sedimentation translates into a relatively high probability of rapid burial, which may pro­duce excellent conditions of preservation. 
The Nature and Behavior of Highland Streams 
The natural environment of highland Mesoamer­ica often defies textbook knowledge. The region is dominated by azonal Cw and Aw climates of the Koppen classification and by volcanic sedi­ments and soils that do not always fit well into global classification systems (Krasilnikov et al. 2013:33-74; Werner 1988:113-115). Its streams are very different from the perennial rivers of the temperate zone and the large rivers that sustained the "hydraulic" civilizations of the desert belt of the Old World. A large proportion of the low-to medium-order streams are referred to as barran­cas, arroyos, or cafiadas. All three terms stress the deeply incised nature of the channel and, of­ten, the entire valley. Incision is enhanced by high rates of tectonic uplift, the abundance of un­consolidated sediment, and the pronounced sea­sonality of rainfall. 
A first crucial distinction is to be drawn be­tween regions where bedrock is close to the mod­em ground surface, as in the Sierra Madre Occi­dental and Oriental, and those mantled by thick deposits of weakly consolidated sediment, such as the pyroclastic tobas (Heine and Schonhals 1973) of the Neovolcanic Axis or the soft mud­stones or shales of the Mixteca Alta (Kirkby 1972). In the former region, streams are domi­nated by gravelly bedload, inimical both to human activity and to site preservation. Stream banks tend to be cut into bedrock pre-dating human presence in the Americas (e.g., Righter et al. 2010). Even where they are cut into late Quater­nary alluvium, the banks are typically inclined and therefore covered in vegetation, drastically reducing site visibility. In the latter region, stream banks are often cut into relatively young alluvium. Where the alluvium is composed of cohesive par­ticles in size fractions smaller than fine sand, banks are often vertical. Free of vegetation, they offer excellent visibility. 
Mesoamerican barrancas have not drawn the sustained interest of process geomorphologists. In order to understand their behavior we have re­lied on analogies with observations on similar landforms in the U.S. Southwest, Mediterranean Europe, parts of the Middle East, or semi-arid lands thickly mantled in loess (Darby and Simon 1999). Because their narrow floodplains are con­fined between steep walls, barrancas respond to changes in discharge and sediment load by de­grading or aggrading their bed at varying paces. Figure 1 is a schematic diagram of barranca evo­lution. Different bouts of aggradation are accom­panied by modest lateral shifts of the channel and the facies formed at different distances from it (la). When aggradation stops, the floodplain is colonized by vegetation, soils develop, and more permanent human occupation is often possible (lb). When aggradation resumes, the soils get buried and become paleosols (le). Eventually the whole barranca may fill up and become barely recognizable as such (ld). The crucial step comes when the balance of discharge and sediment load makes the barranca cut down again (lE). If the

downcutting does not exactly follow the course of the old barranca, a sliver of the old alluvium remains at the edge of the valley. The result of multiple cut-and-fill cycles is the formation of small discontinuous fluvial terraces, which are not necessarily paired (IF). Their absolute ele­vation is a poor guide to their age. 
This complex, large-scale, three-dimensional stratigraphy is one factor that has discouraged study by archaeologists and earth scientists. Moreover, there is a lingering misconception among some archaeologists that the barranca is a landform induced only by forest clearance and agricultural mismanagement (Cook 1949; Kirkby 1972; Smith 1976) and therefore something that did not exist in the Preceramic. Most published survey projects in the highlands acknowledge the problem of site burial along streams, but few re­searchers systematically walk channels from head to outlet, and none have worked to establish the age structure of the exposed alluvium, let alone to augment exposure by digging trenches. Assur­ances that opportunistic exposures have indeed been examined are followed by disclaimers stat­ing that, because few cultural remains were seen, and because floodplains are generally ill-suited to settlement, the problem is likely negligible for valley-wide reconstructions of settlement patterns

(Blanton et al. 1982:6-7; Spores 1972:13, 173). Alternatively, alluviation is discounted as "local­ized," and success in locating some sites (usually the very latest Postclassic ones) on basin floors is adduced as proof that the survey strategy is adequate (Sanders et al. 1979:61). We are not convinced that this approach does full justice to ceramic occupations-there are multiple exam­ples of mounds, standing walls, and entire field systems buried by alluvium (Fowler 1987; Fred­erick 1995:Figures 4.28 and 5.5, 1996, 2007; Gar­cia 1979:202-203)-and adamant that it fatally hinders detection of aceramic ones. 
The potential of barrancas for rapid burial and high chronological resolution, however, can be matched by few other sedimentary environments. It is under the intermediate semi-arid to subhumid climates characteristic of much of highland Mesoamerica that the highest rates of sediment delivery to streams and the highest rates of aggra­dation are attained (Langbein and Schumm 1958), because occasional heavy downpours are coupled with a sparse vegetation cover on slopes. While it increases the chances that sites will be pre­served, aggradation simultaneously hides them from sight, usually beyond the reach of detection by field walking of plowed floodplains or flu vial terraces. The small size and the isolation of Pre­ceramic remains make them practically invisible to geophysical subsurface prospection. Discovery thus relies on subsequent re-exposure by targeted or incidental use of a backhoe or other heavy ma­chinery, or, more often, on erosion by fluvial processes themselves. Any such re-exposure nat­urally threatens to remove the previously stored alluvium and to destroy the archaeological record. The degrees of preservation and visibility are nearly always inversely proportional to one an­other. The examples that follow are attempts to balance them to our advantage. 
Case Studies 
North-Central Tlaxcala 
The area studied in Tlaxcala (Figure 2) is heavily dissected by barrancas of very low order. The ge­ology is dominated by the products of Plio-Pleis­tocene volcanism. Thick deposits of tobas provide much of the stream sediment load, while their co­hesiveness allows the formation of deep, straight­walled barrancas (Heine 1971). We have inten­sively surveyed some 50 km of these barrancas and established a chronology of Holocene alluvi­ation in five separate drainages, measuring be­tween 9 and 32 km2(Borejsza and Frederick 2010). This chronology is based on 60 radiocarbon dates from alluvial contexts and on artifactual inclu­sions, and it is aided by the study of colluvial de­posits and by the excavation of multiple Formative sites in the same drainages, which produced 65 additional radiocarbon dates (Lesure 2014). 
The downstream distribution of late Quater­nary alluvium stored along a typical Tlaxcalan stream tends to follow a pattern. We conceptually divide the stream into three reaches. The upper and middle ones are a deep U-shaped barranca whose walls afford excellent visibility. In the lower reach, the depth of incision diminishes, and the banks are inclined and obscured by veg­etation. The upper reach is cut into tobas or into Pleistocene alluvium. The latter has a coarser tex­ture on average than Holocene alluvium and is derived from the reworking of the tobas of the "yellow/brown" or, less frequently, "white/gray" series. The age estimates for these tobas are 20,000-40,000 B.P. and 12,000-25,000 B.P., re­spectively (Miehlich 1991; Sedov et al. 2009; Werner 1988:87-88). It is not clear to what extent colluvial and alluvial processes had already re­worked the tobas in the dated exposures, but we can surmise that the Pleistocene alluvium is younger than the dates cited. The paleosols it contains are pale, presumably because of diage­netic loss of organic matter, and its substantial age is confirmed by the presence of bones of ex­tinct megafauna. There may be terrace insets of younger alluvium along the upper reach, but they are very narrow and limited to the very distal fa­cies of the floodplain in which paleosols of dif­ferent ages are welded together. They usually contain sherds that indicate their ceramic age. The middle reach is the only one where wider in­sets of Holocene alluvium are preserved and ex­posed. Proximal floodplain and channel facies of greater thickness and with neat separation of dif­ferent paleosols may be present. There may be more than one fluvial fill-terrace, and the main one is made up of early-to mid-Holocene (10,000-3100 B.P.) alluvium. The probability of

encountering such insets seems to be highest where the trunk stream is joined by small tribu­taries or where the valleys follow the edges of old faults and are thus markedly asymmetrical. The few sections we could examine along the lower reach suggested that deposits of all ages were present but very rarely exposed. 
The history of Holocene alluviation explains where and why deposits of Preceramic age are preserved. What little we can generalize about Pleistocene alluviation suggests the prevalence of high-energy flows and rapid deposition. There are nonetheless some low-energy deposits and paleosols that reflect periods of landscape stabil­ity. Lenses filled with peat-like material along Barranca Huexoyucan date to 46,320 B.P. (Solfs et al. 2012). Other A horizons, some overthick­ened by slow aggradation, are in stratigraphic po­sitions that suggest an age intermediate between that date and 10,000 B.P. At this date, Tlaxcalan streams underwent a deep incision. Streams began to aggrade fine-grained alluvium, transformed by concurrent soil formation into cumulic A horizons often more than one meter thick. They reflect

flow regimes steadier than those of modem bar­rancas and the existence of wet meadows similar to the cienegas2 of the U.S. Southwest (Hendrick­son and Minckley 1984). These would have at­tracted game, including perhaps the last big her­bivores. After 9100 B.P., they were buried by several meters of coarser-grained alluvium in a series of depositional episodes reflective of more fitful flood regimes. A non-cumulic soil was form­ing on floodplains by 3100 B .P. The resumption of aggradation at this date is the last event that can be correlated across drainages. Thereafter, the sequence of alluviation is different in each. This temporal divide roughly coincides with the arrival of sedentary farmers at ca. 2800 B .P. Local agricultural land use began to override regional climate as the single most important factor driving stream behavior. Cut-and-fill cycles accelerated by an order of magnitude, with two or more asyn­
chronous incisions documented between the For­mative and the present. Fills exceeding 10 m of thickness in places accumulated in a matter of centuries as a result of the stripping of top-and subsoil horizons on slopes. 
The importance of this for Preceramic archae­ology is that, given how narrow the valleys are, each incision tended to follow a similar course, flushing out much of the alluvium that had ag­graded between 10,000 B.P. and the onset of the Formative (Figure 3). Along many streams, the removal has been complete, so that our conceptual middle reach does not exist. Because the depth of incision varies along the stream and from one cycle to another, and because alluvium aggraded between 10,000 and ca. 3000 B.P. is found under the same fluvial terrace, it is actually the older deposits within this interval that stand a better chance of preservation. 
We have only one convincing remnant of Pre­ceramic activity in stratigraphic context. In a cut­bank of Barranca Tenexac, 4.3 m under the sur­face of its main Holocene terrace, we spotted a large slab in a bed indicative of stream energy patently too low to have transported it. It rested on a sutface reddened by heat, along which were strewn several charcoal fragments and spalls that could be refitted to the large slab. The charcoal was dated to 7900 B .P.

The Basin of Lake Chalco 
Before its virtual disappearance in the wake of the chaotic urbanization of the 20th century, Lake Chalco was fed in part by the Tlalmanalco and Amecameca rivers. These originate in a network of barranca-like headwaters and descend across a wide piedmont and lakeshore plain. The Tlal­manalco drains the extinct Iztaccihuatl volcano and has a predominantly fine-textured (muddy) sediment load. The Amecameca drains the Popocatepetl, and its very sandy sediment load mirrors the ashes generated by the still active vent. Along the Amecameca and the gentle divide separating it from the Tlalmanalco, stratigraphic exposures were limited to borrow, silage, and la­trine pits and a sewage pipe trench. In order to compensate for the lack of exposure, we exca­vated trenches with a backhoe. These were, on average, 3 m wide, 5 m long, and 3-4 m deep. 
The fine-textured deposits of several tributaries of the Tlalmanalco are mined to make bricks on the outskirts of Cuautlalpan (Figure 4; Seele and Siebe 2012). They are also exposed in barranca walls further upstream. We built a chronology based on 39 radiocarbon dates from charred re­mains of wood, aquatic plants, and organic-rich sediments, as well as on finds of free-fall and re­worked tephras, time-diagnostic artifacts, and his­torical references. 
The alluvial architecture of the two streams is radically different. The Amecameca has repeat­edly avulsed, while the Tlalmanalco has aggraded vertically along specific paths. The different lobes of the Amecameca delta have prograded 3-4 km since the Fonnative, shifting an enormous volume of sediment. Since soils develop very slowly in its coarse-textured alluvium, the degree of pedo­genic (soil) development is of little use in distin­guishing young from old.

away from the infilled channels and on the delta front, but none was positively identified as pre­hispanic, let alone Preceramic. At a few locales, the alluvium buried older deposits, but these were either anthropogenic and of ceramic age (a Toltec mound fill) or lacustrine to palustrine (Formative and older) and compressed into a short sequence of very low chronological resolution. 
North of the Amecameca, close to the twentieth­century lakeshore , Holocene lake muds are un­derlain by sands indurated with calcium carbon­ate , apparently formed in a soil profile that was subsequently truncated. The age of the sands is bracketed between a date of 6820 ± 40 B .P. (Table 1) from charcoal found at the base of the overly­ing organic mat and the layer of volcanic ash be­neath the sands. Elsewhere, a piece of charcoal from within that ash yielded an age of 11,950 ± 50 B .P., which is close to that of the Upper Toluca Pumice (Arce et al. 2003). Preceramic alluvium does exist in the Amecameca, then, but it is only some .5 m thick at the localities studied. Further inland and closer to the paleochannels, it is likely to be thicker but very deeply buried. 
In the brickyards around Cuautlalpan and the barrancas further east, the most striking strati­graphic units, up to 1.6 m thick, contain gravels up to boulder size, supported by a matrix of clay and silt. The movement of such debris requires the delivery of large amounts of water onto slopes mantled by large volumes of unconsolidated sed­iment. This provokes some of the sediments to become fluid, slump into the channel , and move at a velocity sufficient to sustain the buoyancy of gravel-sized clasts. Such debris flows are likely in this drainage because of steep stream gradient. They could have been triggered by heavy rains or rapid snowmelt, following either a volcanic eruption delivering fresh sediment onto the slopes or widespread removal of the vegetation growing on older but still highly erodible pyroclastics. Several lines of evidence place the debris flows between the latest Archaic and the Middle For­mative. They are stratigraphically above a vol­canic ash that is macroscopically similar to the "p6mez marcadora superior" (Lambert 1986:78) and the "Upper Pre-Ceramic Plinian Eruptive Se­quence" (Siebe and Macias 2004:11). In one of the brickyards, two successive debris flows bury upwards of 2 m of incrementally aggraded flood­plain deposits of a lower-energy meandering stream. Charcoal from the top of this older allu­vial unit was dated to 3840 ± 80 B .P. Among five dates on charcoal recovered from the debris flows themselves, the youngest-and the one that best approximates the age of deposition -is 2770 ± 30 B .P. The charcoal came from a hearth or oven­like feature associated with the lowest of seven discrete occupation surfaces with Formative ar­tifacts. The brickyards in question are known for

extensive scatters of Formative ceramics, which may date to as early as 3150 B.P. (Parsons et al. 1982:97-100; Tolstoy 1975). The timing of the debris flows does not coincide with any known eruptions or with any abrupt climate change recorded in nearby glacial and lacustrine proxies (Caballero and Ortega 2011). However, it ap­proximates the establishment of the oldest villages in the area. We thus favor the felling of piedmont forests as its cause. The time frame established so far leaves open the possibility that land clear­ance began a few centuries before farmers started using pots. 
Apart from this tantalizing suggestion, there are so far no signs of Preceramic archaeology in alluvial context. Still, the region's environment was exceptionally benign for hunter-gatherers, as is substantiated by the prolific site of Tlapa­coya, on the northern lakeshore, which has Pale­oindian, Archaic, and Formative occupations (Lorenzo and Mirambell 1986; Niederberger 1976). Sedentary farmers probably entered the Basin of Mexico along the pass beyond Ame­cameca (Parsons et al. 1982:365-366). In geo­logic terms, the region is blessed by the abun­dance of late Quaternary tephras, which may be used as marker horizons along which to survey exposures of alluvium. 
Yautepec Valley 
The Yautepec is a large perennial river some 50 km long that crosses the state of Morelos from north to south. In its middle course, near the vil­lage ofTicuman, it occupies a 1.5-km-wide valley hemmed in by limestone mountains. The valley floor is irrigated from the Yautepec itself and from springs at Las Estacas. The flow of the Yautepec is sustained by its large drainage area and other springs to the north. It is supplemented by tributary barrancas that form alluvial fans at the mountain front. Sediment in the river is de­rived from limestone and from volcanic bedrock and unconsolidated pyroclastics upstream. There is a lot of gravel in the active channel, which is some 15 m wide and is incised on the order of 4 m below the surface of the first terrace. The "off­site" strategy we implemented did not target Pre­ceramic archaeology, but, rather, the vestiges of irrigation works. Their history is, of course, inti­mately linked to that of alluviation. Predicting the location of buried canals, distinguishing them from natural channels, and dating them required an understanding of the geometry and history of alluvial fills in the valley. 
Along the 8-km reach studied, the modem channel of the Yautepec hugs the eastern side of the valley, so that little alluvium is stored on its left bank. To the right is the first terrace, which is some 20 m wide. The irregular surface of a second terrace, some 50 m wide, rises from ca. 5 to 7 m above the streambed. The third terrace starts at a level of ca. 10 m above the streambed. Its surface rises gently all the way to the western mountain front. The greatest volume of alluvium is found under this surface, but its topography is very subdued and reflects the intensive agricul­tural practices of recent centuries. The only op­portunistic exposure of the deposits under this third terrace is north of Ticuman. It was created by the appearance within the last few decades of a gully perpendicular to the main valley axis. Named Barranca de las Chinampas, it now forms a right tributary of the Yautepec and is incised a few meters deep for 250 m upstream of the con­fluence. The gully exposes alluvium deposited by the Yautepec River on its former floodplain. After discovering several fossil irrigation canals in the Chinampas cutbanks-some of them pre­cipitated in travertine-we dug one 93-m-long trench and three shorter ones paralleling the bar­ranca in the sugarcane field south of it. We also laid out a transect of 14 discontinuous trenches, spaced at wider intervals closer to the village, in such a manner that it spanned the entire valley to the right of the river. We dug a third, more limited set of trenches and test pits at Las Estacas, to the left of the river and on either side of a set of con­duits that collect water from the springs. All trenches were dug with a backhoe penetrating to a depth of ca. 4 m. 
There are four major sedimentary units under the third terrace of the river. The oldest one, Unit I, is a dark-colored clay. It has a strong pedogenic structure, clay coats with well-developed slick­ensides, and a significant amount of secondary carbonate with some nodules over a centimeter in diameter. We interpret it as overbank alluvium modified by soil formation to a degree that indi­cates a prolonged period of weathering under a stable (non-aggrading) ground surface. In the dis-

tal half of the long transect, we uncovered a pos­sible near-channel facies. Unit I can be found at depths as shallow as 1.1 m near the putative chan­nel and closer to 2 m elsewhere. In the proximal half of the long transect, it was beyond the reach of the backhoe. However, there is no clear corre­lation between the depth at which it is found and distance along the transect. Combined with the fact that carbonate nodules normally form in sub­soil horizons, this indicates that the top of Unit I is an erosional unconformity. The former topsoil was removed prior to, or concurrently with, the deposition of Unit II, which envelops the fos­silized irrigation canals. It is a buff-colored mud, little modified by soil formation. It does not pre­serve any obvious sedimentary structures, possi­bly because it was tilled as it aggraded. A thin A horizon formed from its top, indicating that flood­ing subsided for some time before its burial, pos­sibly because the channel of the Yautepec had moved away toward its modem position to the east. Along Barranca de las Chinampas the top­most Unit III is a thin layer of sediment probably deposited by the tributary just before the onset of gullying. At the western edge of the valley, fan deposits of the tributary barrancas seem to be wedged between Unit I and silts possibly cor­related with Unit II. The stratigraphy at Las Es­tacas is difficult to correlate with the other trenches. Much of the alluvium exposed may have been transported by tributaries. It is, on av­erage, coarser-grained than that of the Yautepec, and the carbonate seems of groundwater rather than pedogenic origin. 
The youngest of the canals contained a sugar mold and a horse bone. This means that the two lower terraces of the Yautepec are a few centuries old at most. On the basis of charcoal inclusions, the oldest canals date to 2459 ± 51 B.P. at Chi­nampas and 2883 ± 38 B.P. at Las Estacas. The implication is that, because the pedogenic attrib­utes observed in Unit I take centuries or millennia to develop, its deposition is much earlier than these Early to Middle Formative dates. Given that the unit is truncated, we hypothesize that the preserved part was deposited in the early Holocene or late Pleistocene. Consequently, some of the fan deposits at the edge of the valley could also be Preceramic in age. The shift to coarser­grained deposition in Unit II and its more rapid 
aggradation suggest that agriculture increased sediment loads and altered the hydrology of the valley from the earliest Formative onward. 
In the most distal trench at Las Estacas, at a depth of 1.7 m, we found an earth oven .7 m deep, with a width of .8 m at its mouth and .4 m at its bottom, lined with five large slabs set at an angle (Figure 5). The fill contained a great mass of largely amorphous charcoal and some ash. The occupation surface into which the oven was dug contained some flaked chert and burnt earth, per­haps daub. We recognized the same surface in an­other nearby trench. Charcoal from the oven dates to 7407 ± 48 B.P., placing it in the early Archaic. If the clays of Unit I are found at Las Estacas at a greater depth, they would likely be of Paleoindian age, and they suggest that deposits of Archaic age be sought under the fluvial landforms (floodplains, terraces, and fans) shaped by the tributaries issuing from springs and mountain ranges, rather than un­der those of the Yautepec itself. 
Nochixtldn Valley 
The Nochixtlan Valley is drained by a dendritic fluvial system whose two main branches coalesce to give birth to the Rfo Verde. The red calcareous shales of the Yanhuitlan Formation are the most common bedrock, but limestone and caliche dom­inate the headwater reaches. The shales shed enor­mous amounts of silt-and clay-sized sediment. The deeply incised channels cut through bedrock in the headwaters, but further downstream they tend to flow between vertical walls of alluvium. A Vanderbilt project studied the natural environ­ment in great detail (Kirkby 1972; Smith 1976; Spores 1969), but we challenge a few of its key 
assumptions (Mueller et al. 2012). Our chronol­ogy rests on 58 radiocarbon dates from charcoal and soil organic matter, artifactual inclusions, and buried cultural features exposed in cutbanks, in particular the abundant agricultural cross-channel terraces known as lama-bordos (Perez and An­derson 2013). 
In the limestone headwaters, alluvium is grav­elly and contains few well-defined paleosols. Its age is yet to be gauged by radiocarbon but seems variable, as some exposures contain the remains of extinct megafauna, while others contain sherds. Many reaches are still crossed by long flights of abandoned lama-bordos whose fills cover any

natural alluvium preserved underneath. In reaches of relatively low order flowing over shales the alluvium is finer-grained, and vertical cutbanks often exceed 10 m in height. Hundreds of lama­bordo walls jut out at different heights, making clear that much of the alluvium was deliberately trapped. The oldest one so far dates to 2840 B.P. Older alluvium is also present, but in smaller vol­ume and more isolated form. It is along the mid­dle-level reaches that the largest volumes of Pre­ceramic alluvium are present (Figure 6) under one or two distinct terraces. Along one such reach, the Yuzanu, the main early-to mid-Holocene ter­race is carved up by the semicircular meander scars of later incisions referred to as joyas. While removing much Preceramic alluvium, they have locally exhumed it over a sizeable surface area. Coarser-grained insets derived from the large­scale erosion of the Yanhuitlan Formation after Conquest lie over the Preceramic alluvium. It is the alluvium of intermediate age-ceramic but prehispanic-that is missing here. Finally, along the highest-order reaches, Preceramic alluvium is present in great volumes, but the lower levels of each fill cycle are sometimes hidden from sight because they lie below the level of the modem streambed. Also, some alluvium here probably pre-dates human presence in the Americas.

Our radiocarbon control starts at 12,100 B.P., when an incision swept through the stream net­work. It was followed by the formation of thick cumulic soils, though with more developed vertic properties. There may be two generations of them, the second one contemporaneous with the Tlax­calan examples. They disappear from the strati­graphic record after ca. 9000 B.P., buried by coarser-grained aggradation punctuated by short episodes during which organic matter accumu­lated on inactive floodplains and secondary car­bonate was precipitated in the subsoil. These weakly developed paleosols of mid-Holocene age testify to the sort of instability that, we argue, would have made the floodplains attractive to hunter-gatherers and incipient farmers. Upwards of 10 m of alluvium were deposited in this fill cycle. At ca. 5000 B.P., an incision that initiated on the Rfo Verde began to propagate upstream, reaching the headwaters of the western arm of the valley as late as 4100 B .P. The next fill cycle was significantly enhanced by the construction of lama-bordos. Two more incisions followed. 
The distribution of Preceramic alluvium and archaeological remains is largely determined by how deep and how far each of the last three inci­sions traveled along the stream network. The rel­atively wide valleys and the vagaries that the con­struction of lama-bordos introduced into the behavior of the fluvial system mean that each in­cision followed a slightly different course, sparing some Preceramic alluvium. Because of their tim­ing, the probability of preservation is highest for deposits spanning the Pleistocene-Holocene tran­sition and for those closely preceding 4000 B .P. Finds of Pleistocene fauna are common, and can often be traced to the wet meadow horizons. In view of the low energy of this sedimentary envi­ronment, the animals probably died close to the place of deposition. The report of a mammoth ex­humed by the Yuzanu brought Jose Luis Lorenzo to the valley in 1953. While looking for the mam­moth, Lorenzo discovered a roasting pit buried in the earliest deposits of our second fill cycle, which two radiocarbon dates placed at 4050-3950 B.P. (Lorenzo 1958). The excavation of this feature and associated scatter of stones required the man­ual removal of over 6 m of overburden and took place under salvage-like conditions during the wet season. Performed over half a century ago, this 
operation remains a Ione example of the kind of open-air site excavation that we advocate here. 
Our surveys confirm the paleontological and archaeological potential of the valley. On one of the low-order streams of the eastern arm, a small lithic scatter is buried 5 m underneath a terrace that combines alluvium from the second and third fill cycles. Organic matter from that level dates to 8500 B .P. On a tributary of the Yuzanu, a paleosol displays obvious signs of having been burnt. In a test unit placed in one of the cutbanks, the paleosol yielded several dozen flakes, fragments of burnt bone, and many unmodified stones with heat­spalling that are of a lithology absent along this particular tributary. Charcoal from this horizon dates to 4435 ± 48 B.P. Elsewhere, dense scatters of charcoal in some fluvial facies hint that late Archaic populations may have set fires that cleared riparian vegetation ahead of planting.3 
General Patterns of Alluviation and Site Preservation 
The case studies demonstrate that the chances of discovery of Preceramic open-air sites are closely tied to the history of fluvial activity. It is important to stress that the alluvial architecture and archae­ological potential of the deposits were empirically established on the basis of stratigraphic sequences logged in the field. If our target is Paleoindian remains, in Tlaxcala the alluvium of the right age is stored and best exposed along headwater reaches, while in Nochixtlan it is found in the higher-order reaches. This is not something that could be "predicted" by applying some geomor­phological "laws" to a set of maps and aerial im­ages of sufficient resolution and handling them with sufficiently sophisticated GIS software.4 Al­luvial deposits do not make complacent objects of modeling and are notorious for the difficulty of correlating them among different facies and exposures. The episodic nature of sedimentation and the presence of numerous unconformities do not allow for linear age interpolation or extrapo­lation of the kind applied in lacustrine settings. In this light, it may seem futile to try to extract any pan-Mesoamerican patterns of site preserva­tion from our experience. 
Still, we contend that such generalization is both possible and useful, as long as it is done at

a coarse enough level. Stream behavior is com­plex, but not random. If its controls can be shown to vary in unison in Mesoamerica over the mil­lennial timescales we are concerned with, we should expect some regularities in sedimentation style and soil development. These will be most pronounced-and the resulting correlations most credible-for the lowest-order reaches, which have the shortest response times to external con­trols. It does emerge, for example, that wet mead­ows were common during deglaciation , as docu­mented as far apart as Guanajuato and Oaxaca (Borejsza and Frederick 20 10; Mueller et al. 2012; Solfs et al. 20 1 2). Their rapid but low-en­ergy aggradation is expected to produce ideal conditions for artifact burial and preservation­in one case confirmed by the discovery of a hearth (McAuliffe et al. 200 1)-even though the in­tegrity of occupation surfaces may be compro­mised by intense bioturbation and the shrinking and swelling of clays (Ferring 1992: 16-20). Coarser, higher-energy sedimentation and the for­mation of carbonate-rich soils may have been more common in the mid-Holocene. If we do not refer to Chalco and Yautepec here , it is precisely because they include fewer small tributaries. Rivers such as the Amecameca and, especially, the Yautepec are so large that the time lag required for changes in external controls to register renders cross-regional correlations meaningless. Also, the larger rivers evolve more stable channel forms suited to transporting the volumes of sediment supplied, with the average discharge. As a result, overbank flooding and sedimentation are less fre­quent, which, from our perspective, means fewer opportunities for site burial (Gladfelter 1985:46­47). It is sometimes tempting to blame the scarcity of sites on such stability, especially for the Ar­chaic, which corresponds to the relatively stable climate of the mid-Holocene. The lack of pre­served and dated alluvial units of any particular time interval, however, does not necessarily re­flect a lack of sedimentation (Lewin and Macklin 2003: 117), especially in the absence of well-de­
veloped paleosols. 
It is remarkable that practically all the streams studied, small and large, seem to register the ar­rival of sedentary farmers. At some point between 3500 and 2800 B .P. they started to carry larger sediment loads, with coarser particle size, and to aggrade more rapidly. Cut-and-fill cycles accel­erated by an order of magnitude, so that while all early and middle Holocene alluvium is usually found under the same terrace, late Holocene al­luvium is distributed under several. The date at which this drastic change in hydrological regimes took place-presumably in response to sediment delivery and runoff from slopes accelerated by land clearance and tillage-follows in space the presumed direction of dispersal of Formative farming populations (Lesure 2008). It is thus some 500 years earlier in our Yautepec and Chalco cases than in north-central Tlaxcala. 
The incisions that became more frequent after this transition removed large volumes of previ­ously stored alluvium together with any Prece­ramic archaeology that it contained. Further downstream the mobilized sediment buried Pre­ceramic levels at depths of several meters below the modern ground surface. As more cases are added, we anticipate that the degree of hydrolog­ical upheaval will correlate positively with early introduction and high intensity of sedentary farm­ing, but negatively with the degree of preservation and visibility of Preceramic sites. This would ex­plain why it is more difficult to find Preceramic archaeology in Mesoamerica than beyond its bor­ders. One of the traits Kirchhoff (1 943) used to delimit this culture area was the presence of "su­perior cultivators," i.e., higher agricultural inten­sity. Isolated observations made on the northern fringes of Mesoamerica suggest to us that Holocene fluvial regimes there remained unaf­fected until the expansion of farming at the end of the Classic, or even until the arrival of the Spaniards. It seems no coincidence that some of the best examples of Preceramic open-air sites buried under alluvium, and the methodology de­veloped to locate them (e.g., Bettis and Mandel 2002; Holliday 1997; Mabry 1996; Waters 2000), come from areas further north that supported much less intensive agriculture before European contact and were among the last to be colonized by Anglo-Americans. 
A related and somewhat counterintuitive gen­eralization is that, all other things being equal, the deposits and sites dating to ca. 12,000-7500 
B.P. in highland Mesoamerica may be easier to find than those from ca. 7500-3000 B.P. Both typically belong to the same fill cycle that was

initiated by the cutting of new barrancas during deglaciation. As a result, the earlier remains are found in lower topographic positions than the later ones along a given reach. As they were carved up by ceramic-age incisions, these later deposits were at higher risk of removal (see Lewin and Macklin 2003: 109). The earlier ones often escaped unscathed, especially in locations where the ceramic-age incisions were not as deep as the one that occurred between 12,000 and 10,000 B .P. In other words, the very latest Archaic deposits were the most exposed to destruction when Formative farmers let loose the erosive powers of the barrancas. 
Survey Strategies 
One possible reaction to our observations, and one that is not infrequently heard among archae­ologists of Mexico, is that the Preceramic is best studied in the "North," beyond the borders of Mesoamerica. Where chances of site discovery and ease of access are concerned, we take no issue with this stance. If everybody assumed it, however, we would limit ourselves to studying only those populations that never made an inde­pendent transition to agriculture and sedentary life. If questions concerning "pristine" agricultural origins, the first domestication of key cultivars, or even earlier adaptations to tropical highland biomes still interest us, we need to develop strate­gies to discover remains that are difficult to get to-and virtually impossible to stumble upon by chance. 
A first step toward locating sites buried under alluvium is to categorize stream reaches according to their potential for site preservation and dis­covery, and according to the different survey strategies that they require. We have mentioned the division between valleys dominated by bedrock and unconsolidated sediments, the latter being much more promising. The next funda­mental division is between the barrancas usually found along lower-order reaches in the uplands and unincised channel forms with wider and less confined floodplains. These are often found where the barrancas exit onto intermontane basin floors. Two of our case studies (Tlaxcala and Nochixtlan) were dominated by the former, and the other two (Chalco and Yautepec) by the latter. 
At a finer scale, the approach of Nials et al. (2011) of formally defining "reaches" and "reach boundaries" may be useful. As they point out, reach boundaries tend to be loci of high archaeo­logical potential, something we have also empir­ical!J observed in Mesoamerica. The two major types of boundaries are ( 1) valley constrictions created by bedrock or sediments resistant to ero­sion, and (2) stream confluences. The reasons why they hold more potential are rooted in both their systemic and geoarchaeological context. In the first case, rises in water tables upstream of the constrictions create places that remain con­sistently wetter, changes in fluvial architecture notwithstanding. Their attractiveness in the wa­ter-stressed environments of highland Mesoamer­ica needs little explanation. The constriction also encourages sediment storage upstream of it and is thus a locus where longer stratigraphic records may be preserved. Turning to confluences, Nials et al. (2011 :737) explain that "tributary streams have steeper gradients than the mainstem stream, and transport proportionally larger amounts of sediment. These sediments may be too coarse or abundant for the mainstem to remove, and a part is ultimately deposited on the mainstem flood­plain at and near the tributary mouth." This is probably what explains the completeness of the stratigraphic record at Cuautlalpan, where pied­mont barrancas emptied into the Tlalmanalco River. To this we may add that the most attractive exposures of barranca stratigraphy are often found at confluences because the widening of the valley, coupled with slight changes in the position of the mouth of the tributary and the angle at which it enters the mainstem, allow each successive inci­sion to follow a slightly different route, sparing some of the older stratigraphic record. If the streams have meandered lightly, one is often left with "islands" of alluvium exposed in vertical cutbanks on all sides. This vastly improves visi­bility and facilitates the reconstruction of three­dimensional fluvial architecture. Reach bound­aries are also where diversion and intake structures for canals can be constructed most prof­itably (Nials et al. 2011:Figure 8). In the light of recent discoveries in the U.S. Southwest (Mabry 2007) and Peru (Dillehay et al. 2005), their exis­tence in Preceramic Mesoamerica is no longer unthinkable.

Incised and unincised reaches call for very different survey routines. The advantage of in­cised reaches is visibility. Walking along the mod­em channels is usually sufficient to observe the alluvium exposed in multiple cutbanks. We rou­tinely choose the most vertical cutbanks for the Jogging of stratigraphic sequences. Although this requires rappelling up and down faces up to 15 m in height, it enormously speeds up cleaning and sampling . Also, modem vegetation takes hold wherever the cutbanks become even slightly in­clined or stepped, with the consequent risks of bioturbation and addition of new organic matter to the exposed paleosols. Survey along incised reaches is a never-ending task, as each year cut­banks collapse, exposing fresh faces. The disad­vantage of the incised reaches is preservation , as the stratigraphic record is often very incomplete and fragmented across different exposures. Along unincised reaches, preservation and visibility are inverted. Exposures rarely exist unless they are created by recent human activity. In this respect, working in areas under development (such as Chalco in the 1990s) has the advantage of fre­quent opportunistic exposure, though the political climate to be negotiated is often very tense. Even then, mechanized excavation of trenches at crucial points on the floodplain or terraces is usually in­dispensable. In more rural areas (such as Yaute­pec) it may be the only option. 
If we are to increase the odds of discovering sites , our first and most fundamental task must be to grasp the complex geometry of alluvial de­posits and to understand the age structure of late Quaternary alluvium in any given study area (Fer­ring 2001). This is a task that requires consider­able experience and the willingness to spend money on the radiometric dating of contexts that lack any cultural remains. Apart from radiocar­bon , a technique that is expanding into alluvial contexts is optically stimulated luminescence (Aiuvalasit et al. 2010; Fuchs and Wagner 2005). 
The need for more dates diminishes as one learns to recognize landforms and deposits too young to be of interest for Preceramic archaeol­ogy (e.g., on the basis of ridge-and-swale topog­raphy of alluvial surfaces, or the exceedingly good preservation of sedimentary structures) or too old to expect human presence (e.g., on the basis of diagenetic processes that have affected alluvium and paleosols, consolidation, or tectonic deformation). The next task is to develop relative chronometric aids in the form of marker horizons and soil chronosequences. The most useful strati­graphic markers are the multiple tephras that have been ejected over the highlands in the late Qua­ternary, more of which are being recognized every day (e.g., Castro-Govea and Siebe 2007; Newton et al. 2005; Siebe and Macias 2004). Alluvial sedimentary environments offer good conditions for the preservation and recognition of tephras and, among our four cases, only Nochixtlan lacks them. As for buried soils, it is crucial to distin­guish between ephemeral ones that form in re­sponse to very localized changes in the distribu­tion of different channel , bar, and floodplain facies, and more mature ones whose formation may have been a response to wider climatic con­ditions (Ferring 2001). The latter may tum out to be useful as regional marker horizons. 
Building soil chronosequences means devel­oping an appreciation of the pace of formation of different attributes of floodplain soils (clay coats, accumulations of secondary carbonate) in order to estimate the time elapsed between the accumulation of one alluvial unit and the next (Bettis 1992; Ferring 1992:10). Another pending task is to measure the mean residence times (Matthews 1985) of different fractions of organic matter in floodplain soils in order to interpret more precisely the radiocarbon ages of paleosols buried under alluvium. Applying rates of soil for­mation and residence times calculated for other latitudes may be misleading in view of the pecu­liarities of the Mesoamerican environment. We have little hope that such tools will be developed independently of archaeology because fluvial en­vironments do not figure prominently on the re­search agendas of earth scientists active in the region. 
With respect to the "archaeology" we hope to find, we need to pay more attention to non-arti­factual traces of human activity and to extract from them as much information as possible. These may include bone accumulations with taphonomic attributes that are difficult to explain by fluvial transport alone; unmodified stones ("manuports") that are out of their geological context because of their lithology or too large for the stream en­ergy implied by the deposit; heat spalls washed

out of hearths or produced by fires set to flood­plain vegetation; and scatters of charcoal pro­duced by the same processes or washed down from slopes cleared for early agriculture. Spoiled as we are in Mesoamerica by spectacular finds from later periods, we may have to reconsider our attitudes about which sites are worth digging, especially since the initial observations made in a cutbank or the wall of a test unit are rarely a re­liable guide to what lies buried a few meters away. The reports of the few sites excavated after being spotted in a cutbank (Lorenzo 1958; Mac­Neish and Garcfa 1975:155-160; Voorhies 2004: 100-117) make for instructive reading in this regard. Many ceramic sites in Mesoamerica are palimpsests situated on surfaces that have re­mained stable for a long time and are covered in abundant cultural material. In contrast, the open­air Preceramic sites we advocate looking for and excavating will be situated on short-lived sur­faces. They will typically have a small number of artifacts, but this will be compensated by the exquisite preservation of activity areas. Tradi­tional measures of site significance, such as high artifact counts, are best set aside. In the end, as sophisticated as our survey strategies may be­come, the element of luck will still thankfully be there.

I . All dates are expressed in uncalibrated radiocarbon years. 
2. 
The te1m is problematic because in Mexican usage it refers to a large shallow lake. 

3. 
Pinpointing the source of charcoal in alluvial deposits, distinguishing between natural and set fires, and inferring the purpose of the latter-driving game, encouraging the growth of new browse, preparing cultivation surfaces, etc. -is difficult (see Borejsza et al. 2011; French et al. 2009). 

4. 
For just two examples of this approach, see Burke et al. (2008) and Egeland et al. (2010). With only a little exaggera­tion, their results can be summed up as "look along the streams."
