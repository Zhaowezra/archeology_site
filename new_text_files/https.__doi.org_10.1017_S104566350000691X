peoples through the movement of objects. For instance, interesting parallels might be drawn between the dis­tinctiveness of headdresses on Honduran figurines, which the authors interpret as family crests, and those from Late Classic Veracruz. Depictions of marriage or sexual unions in Central Mexican manuscripts as well as in West Mexican figurines might provide a provocative source of comparison with the Honduran marriage fig­urines, as some are represented by a paired man and woman under a blanket. Such a depiction resonates, in particular, with the more anomalous paired figurines from Travesia, Honduras, which possess two distinct heads with different headdress, but bodies cloaked below a single cloth. They interpret the cloth as a single huipil (women's dress) with the implication that two women were paired together as a single social person. In addition, a great deal of archaeological fieldwork with extensive analyses of excavated pottery has been conducted in the Honduran river valleys immediately to the east of their study zone (e.g., Naco River Valley and beyond). The 
authors, however, provide little information on how the 
people in their study region may or may not have inter­acted with people further east. 
Material Relations: The Marriage Figurines of Pre­hispanic Honduras showcases a series of paired figurines that bring us into a world of marriage alliances, the craft­ing of person-like objects, the reproduction of house­holds, the curating of ancestors, and public celebrations that brought diverse people together. As such, the sites of Campo Dos, Cerro Palenque, Copan, Curruste, and Travesia come to life, and the reader gains a greater appreciation for the social archaeology of western Hon­duras.

Twenty years after the publication of the French first edition (Montezuma ou I'apogee et la chute de ['empire azteque, Paris, Fayard, 1994), the Spanish translation of this masterpiece by Michel Graulich is a most welcome contribution to Aztec studies. Renowned for his in-depth analyses of myths and rituals in prehispanic Mexico­including Myths of Ancient Mexico (1997), and Ritos aztecas: Ins fiestas de las veintenas ( 1999)-the Belgian historian tackles one of the most controversial figures in Mexican history in this biography, namely Motecuhzoma Xocoyotzin or Motecuhzoma II, the king of the Mexica 
Empire who had to face the conquistadors led by Hernan Cortes. Like Jacques Le Goff, who in his book Saint Louis (University of Notre Dame Press, 2009) pursued the difficult search for the personality of a French king from the Middle Ages-beyond the stereotype of the sovereign and the model of the saint-Graulich raises the question of the possibility of offering a reliable por­trait of a prehispanic figure on the basis of sources rife with bias and contradiction. Just as Le Goff contextual­ized his biography by presenting thirteenth century French society, religion, and art, Michel Graulich includes a detailed description of Mexico at the start of the sixteenth century, from the structure of the Mexica Empire, the daily life of its inhabitants, and the myths that were the foundation for their vision of the world. In fact, drawing on myths to analyze Motecuhzoma's actions is one of the most innovative aspects of Graulich 's book. Also striking is the author's systematic comparison of sixteenth century sources-historical accounts written by the Spaniards and those by members of the indigenous population and the religious community-without over­looking the results of modern scholarship. Graulich not only exploits different versions to try to reconstruct a close approximation of the reality of the conquest, but he also assesses the indigenous perspective, without which many of the events would be inexplicable without. When viewing Spanish sources, the Belgian historian's gaze is at times critical, as in the case of Bernal Diaz de! Castillo's Historia Verdadera de la Conquista de la Nueva Espana, often used by historians who praise his remarkable memory. However, Graulich catches Bernal Diaz in a number of lies, such as the conqueror's claim that the Mayas began the hostilities during the initial contact with the Spaniards at Cape Catoche-he suspects that Bernal Diaz did not even participate in the Cordoba expedition -or when he describes how Cortes destroyed the idols of the Totonacs at Cempoala. Similarly, Graulich points out the discrepancies between Spanish accounts or their significant silences. We know that after the destruction of the idols at the Templo Mayor, Motecuh­zoma urged Cortes to leave Tenochtitlan, a fact that the future Marquis de! Valle naturally omits to cast blame for the Aztec rebellion on the arrival of Narvaez. As for the indigenous sources, Graulich 's criticism is of another sort. He discusses the reconstitution of events carried out after the conquest, many of them aimed at minimizing 
their resistance to the invaders or presented to enhance the image of collaboration with the Spaniards. 
It is worth noting that more than half of the book is devoted to the period preceding the arrival of the Spaniards. After a brief presentation of the creation myths and Mexica history, Graulich describes the education of Motecuhzoma and the complex ceremonies performed for accession to power. Military campaigns were carried out continuously during Motecuhzoma's reign to con-

so Ii date the empire by integrating independent enclaves, and above all to weaken the Valley of Puebla, the Triple Alliance's main adversary. The king's administrative reforms were intended to augment the coherence of the empire, to hold the nobles in check, and to reinforce the authority of centralized power. Motecuhzoma's mark also touched the religious sphere with major reforms. For example, the replacement of Quetzalcoatl with Huitzilopochtli, the Mexica patron deity, had important consequences when the Spaniards were assimilated to Quetzalcoatl, who was believed to be returning to recover his kingdom. Graulich examines these early contacts in detail, the sojourn of the Spaniards in Tenochtitlan, the strange and impossible joint government of Motecuh­zoma and Cortes, and finally the controversial death of the tlatoani. 
One of the most significant contributions made by Graulich's work is to demystify Motecuhzoma's sup­posed cowardice in the face of the Spaniards. Many accounts attest to the fact that the tlatoani thought that the rich but decadent Mexica Empire was on the verge of collapse with the arrival of the invaders. In contrast, the king saw the Spaniards as full of vigor, and the mem­ory of the fall of Tollan filled him with anguish. Having said that, Graulich demonstrates that after sizing up the power of the newcomers-for example, by influencing the Mayas who attacked them in Cinda-the Mexica king adopted several strategies to resist their advance, such as magical tactics inspired by myths. And so, Mote­cuhzoma sent to the coast an individual who resembled Cortes so strongly that even the Spaniards, amused by the act, called him Cortes. Graulich keenly detects that the tlatoani hoped to reproduce Tezcatlipoca's maneuver at Tollan by placing a mirror before Quetzalcoatl to con­fuse him. Unfortunately, the conqueror was oblivious to the ruse. At the same time, Motecuhzoma employed more drastic measures to fight against the foreigners. According to Graulich, the Cholula massacre-com­monly cited to condemn Cortes's gratuitous violence­must have been an ambush. Accused, Motecuhzoma had to confess that his troops were surrounding the city, and the Spanish garrison in Veracruz was attacked at the same moment as the trap set at Cholula. Graulich empha­sizes the tactical interest of this attempt to do away with the conquistadores in a closed location where the efficacy of Spanish weaponry was diminished. At the same time, the author believes that during the Toxcatl festival, in Cortes's absence, the Mexicas attempted to eliminate the Spaniards. These elements contribute to reappraising Motecuhzoma's personality. The tlatoani's pride and tyranny can now be situated within the context of the myths that the victims of the conquest forged to explain the punishment of the transgressor king, the scapegoat of the catastrophe of the conquest. They also spread the image of defenseless pacific Indians who waited until 
the last moment to fight against the Spaniards, who per­petrated unwarranted slaughter. Graulich breaks with this cliche, which is in fact humiliating and slanderous for the ancient Mexicans, and he shows that the Mexicas indeed defended themselves, and above all that Mote­cuhzoma was not the superstitious cowardly sovereign who abandoned his empire without putting up a fight against the foreigners.

Together with drug production and distribution, mining is one of the most significant macroeconomic activities currently transforming the Andes, and particularly Bolivia and Peru. In the past decade alone, these two countries have figured among the world's highest pro­ducers of both cocaine and precious metals. Every archaeologist working in the Andean highlands is imme­diately confronted with two issues: it is better not to cross paths with drug activity while doing survey, and it is better not to interfere with the big mines. Regarding archaeological heritage, mining is far more destructive than narco activities, since many of the main mines and the highways or conducts specially built to transport pre­cious materials to the coast are on or near archaeological sites. In this context, a substantial book like the one edited by Tripcevich and Vaughn on mining and quar­rying is more than welcome. It shows the potential of this field of study and will also serve as a sort of testi­mony, before many of these archaeological sites vanish. 
The volume includes an introduction by the editors, 13 specific chapters, and two closing discussions. The geographical scope of the book covers four countries (Bolivia, Chile, Ecuador, and Peru) but 8 of the 13 articles are related to Southern Peru. Only one small reference is devoted to northern Peru (in Brooks, Schworbel, and Castillo), and only one chapter partially deals with Ecuador (Ogburn). While most of the articles include dif­ferent amounts of ethnographic and historical informa­tion, there are two explicitly devoted to ethnography (Roddick and Klarich; Jennings et al). The two commen­tators, Burger and Shimada, who both have much expe­rience on the topic, provide excellent discussions indicating the achievements and limitations of each of the chapters, so I recommend the reader to start with those texts. In general, some of the specific chapters show the
