SETTLEMENT ORGANIZATION AND ARCHITECTURE IN LATE 
INTERMEDIATE PERIOD CHACHAPOYAS, NORTHEASTERN PERU 

Anna Guengerich 
Chachapoya societies that lived on the forested eastern slopes of the Andes in northern Peru between A.D. 1000 and 1450 remain largely absent from broader narratives of the Andean Late Intermediate period (LIP). This paper argues that envi­ronmentally deterministic frameworks and lingering lnka biases have led scholars to problematically isolate Chachapoyans from their highland contemporaries. This work reviews three aspects ofChachapoya built environments-settlement pat­terning, internal organization, and architectural style-in order to provide a baseline for comparison with other regions. 
Chachapoyas shared a pattern of hilltop settlement locations with nearly all of the highlands, which suggests that its inhab­itants faced the same shared factors that prompted changes in settlement organization on a massive scale in this region during the LIP. At the same time, comparison of Chachapoya built environments with others of the northern, central, and southern highlands highlights the considerable diversity within and between regions. This demonstrates that Chachapoyas is best interpreted as simply one of many regions that were characterized by distinctive spatialities and architectural forms. These reflected locally specific cultural practices and social institutions. Including Chachapoyas and other regions of the Eastern Andes in accounts of the LIP underscores the diversity and dynamism that characterized this period of significant change in Andean history. 
Las sociedades chachapoyas que habitaron en las vertientes orientales de las Andes de! norte de Peru entre 1000-1450 d.C. siguen ausentes de la historiograffa general del Perfodo Intermedio Tardio. Este trabajo plantea la idea de que el determinismo ambiental y la influencia de la ideologfa inka han resultado en el aislamiento analltico de las chachapoya de sus contemporaneos en la sierra, a pesar de que las investigaciones regionales siguen brindando mas evidencias de las interconexiones que existieron entre la sierra y las vertientes orientates de las Andes. En este artfculo se examinan tres aspectos de las paisajes construidos de Chachapoyas-los patrones de asentamiento, la organizacion interna y el estilo arquitectonico-para producir una base de comparacion con otras regiones. Chachapoyas compartio con casi toda la sierra un patron de asentamiento en lugares elevados, el cual sugiere que las habitantes de esta region enfrentaron las mismos factores que provocaron cambios a gran escala en las asentamientos durante esta epoca. A la misma vez, la comparacion de los paisajes construidos de Cha­chapoyas con otros de la sierra norte, central y sur, muestra la gran diversidad entre y dentro de cada region. Esta implica que Chachapoyas presenta solo un ejemplo de muchas sociedades regionales que se caracterizaron par espacialidades y 
formas arquitectonicas distintas, las cuales evidencian practicas culturales e instituciones sociales locales. De este modo, la integracion de Chachapoyas en las historias arqueologicas ayuda a poner enfasis en la diversidad y el dinamismo que carac­terizaron esta epoca de cambios importantes en el pasado andino .

raneous highland societies, when in fact its in­habitants confronted circumstances similar to those of other Andeans as they created new built environments during this period of change. Fur­thermore, a comparison of settlement organization and architecture in Chachapoyas and other regions of the northern, central, and southern highlands demonstrates the diversity seen throughout the highlands, rather than revealing some fundamental distinction separating Chachapoyas from all other areas. By comparing Chachapoyas with the rest of the highland Andes, this paper joins existing calls to move beyond generalized narratives of the LIP as a time of conflict, collapse, and hardship in order to examine the vibrant social and material traditions that were developed by local groups (e.g., Bonnier 1997; Kosiba 2011; Zovar 2007). 
I begin by discussing existing models of Chachapoya social organization and material cul­ture, examining in particular how scholarship has shaped and been shaped by a perception of this region as qualitatively unlike the rest of the Andes. This is followed by an overview of the space and architecture of Chachapoya settlements. This dataset facilitates comparison with other parts of the Andean highlands, where research on the LIP has often taken the form of survey and studies of spatial organization. This discussion builds in par­ticular on recent research at the settlement site of Monte Viudo, a village that was home to one to

two thousand people between AD. 1250 and 1450 ( Guengerich 20 l4a). The paper concludes by con­textualizing Chachapoya built environments in relationship to other regions of the LIP highlands, with the aim of demonstrating the potential con­tribution of the Eastern Andes to a more robust understanding of social process in the prehispanic Andean world. 
Chachapoya Societies,A.D.1000-1500 
Chachapoya material culture extends from the Marafi6n River on the west to the upper drainages of the Huallaga River on the east, and south from modern Baguas to Pataz and Pfas in northern La Libertad (Figure 2; Schjellerup 2005:53-58).2 Characteristic cultural materials include cliff buri­als in chullpas and in unfired clay sarcophagi (Kauffman 2009; von Hagen 2002a), circular stone buildings with friezes and platform bases (Fabre 2006; Guengerich 2014b), appliqued brown wares and red-painted whitewares (Reichlen and Reichlen 1950; Ruiz 2009), three-dimensional and bas-relief sculpture in stone and wood (Lerche 1995), and red ochre rock paintings (Koschmieder 2011, 2012; Ruiz 2009).3 These material forms

appeared in the region by AD. 1000 and continued 
under Inka domination (Church and von Hagen 
2008). 
The immediate processes leading to the devel­opment of Chachapoya culture remain murky. Ra­diocarbon dates spanning the Early Intermediate period (EIP), the Early Horizon, and the prece­ramic (e.g., Church 1994, 1996; Guengerich 2014a:95-104; Koschmieder 2012:35-40; Narvaez 2013; Schjellerup 2005:347-354) attest that this region had long been a locus of cultural development. The limited extent of most excava­tions, however, means that our knowledge of ear­lier populations and their relationship to LIP Chachapoyans remains fragmentary. Some styl­istically Wari artifacts have been found (Church and von Hagen 2008; Narvaez 2013:117, 131; Ruiz 2009:74--77), but these were likely the result of interaction rather than incorporation into the empire, given the absence of Wari architecture and state-built facilities (Church and von Hagen 2008:911-913; Schjellerup 2005:453). 
Like many areas of the Eastern Andes, Chachapoyas spans a great variety of environ­mental zones. These range from treeless puna (jalka) as high as 4500 m asl to temperate kichwa and warm, forested yungas or temple below 1800 m asl (Schjellerup 2005:33-50). In addition, large expanses of dense cloud forest also cover many areas . Accordingly, late prehispanic Chachapoyans probably practiced a variety of subsistence regimes, often in quite close prox­imity to each other as in the modern period (Brush 1977). Recent research suggests that com­munities throughout the region relied on different staple crops (Koschmieder 2015), such as tubers in the high-altitude Atuen drainage (Guengerich 2014a; Schjellerup 2005), maize in the kichwa­predominant Luya area (Koschmieder 2014), and possibly manioc in still lower areas.4 Camelid remains (Guengerich 2014a; Narvaez 2013; Schjellerup 2005) and their representations (Koschmieder 2011) are found across Chachapoyas, suggesting that they formed an ideologically and economically important re­source across ecological zones. 
Sociopolitical Organization 
Existing models of Chachapoya political organi­zation derive essentially from Spanish chronicles 
and ethnohistoric research, particularly by Walde­mar Espinoza ( 1967). According to these models, Chachapoya political landscapes consisted of small, autonomous polities made up of one village or several small villages coupled with a larger principal one (Church and von Hagen 2008; Koschmieder 2015; Schjellerup 2005:449--450). Authors often claim that village groups occasion­ally formed ephemeral alliances for military ends (e.g., Espinoza 1967:234; Koschmieder 2015:6; Lerche 1995:33-34), but there is no archaeological or documentary evidence to support this assertion.5 Site patterning studies capable of validating these models, for example, have not yet been under­taken. The size of sites did vary considerably, from several dozen to several hundred buildings (Schjellerup 2005:305), but it is not clear how these were organized spatially or whether their size distributions were multimodal. The presence of relatively monumental masonry constructions at a number of sites, including Pirka Pirka (Vega 1982), La Joya (Muscutt 1998:39--41), La Meseta (Muscutt 2013), and Cerro Las Cruces (Bueno and Cornejo 2009) does, however, suggest that some settlements may have been ritually or polit­ically important for multiple communities. 
The enormous site of Kuelap, with its 20-m­high platform walls, remains a particular puzzle for understanding regional power structures. On the basis of size, a few scholars have suggested that it stood at the apex of a regional state (Brush 1977:43; Narvaez 2013). Others have argued that its importance was grounded in its role as a ritual center, perhaps serving as a pilgrimage center (Narvaez 2013) or the seat of a regional shrine (von Hagen 2002b:62). The scale and the labor invested in Kuelap-among the largest stone con­structions of precolumbian South America­certainly suggest that it was a major center of gravity for regional power dynamics, but it re­mains difficult to specify the nature of that role until further research addresses this question from the perspective of additional sites. 
Historical sources indicate that greater Chachapoyas was made up of multiple subregional groups with ethnic-like characteristics, including the Chillaos, Chilchos, Paellas, and Chachas (Es­pinoza 1967; Zevallos 1995). This is increasingly supported archaeologically by evidence of geo­graphical patterning in material culture, including

frieze motifs (Fabre 2006: 116-117; Lerche 1995:30-31; Schjellerup 2005:448), cliff burial interments in sarcophagi or chullpas (Reichlen and Reichlen 1950; but see critiques by Nystrom et al. [2010]), and the predominance of appliqued brown wares or red-painted whitewares in ceramic assemblages (Koschmieder 2015). This raises the question of the extent to which the inhabitants of this region acted, or perceived themselves, as a common group. Schjellerup (2002), for example, argues that a sense of pan-regional identity de­veloped only following the incursion of the Ink.a. 
Chachapoyans have been associated with a cul­ture of warfare to a degree that other Andeans have not. They are regularly portrayed as warriors, in contrast to the people of other regions of the An­dean highlands, where LIP warfare is explained as a historically specific set of conditions respond­ing to social or natural changes (e.g., Arkush 2008; Hyslop 1976; LeBlanc 1981). As Nystrom and Toyne (2013) argue, however, this view derives principally from Spanish chronicles, which were heavily structured by Ink.a ideological narratives and reflect their experience of trying to subdue a strongly resistant population. It likely also has gained momentum from a common perception that Chachapoyans were culturally linked to the Ama­zon, which Western-and Inka-historiography has portrayed for centuries as a land where inter­tribal warfare flourished in the absence of law and political authority. Jivaroan groups in nearby Ecuador, for example, have often served scholars as a ready parallel for interpreting various aspects of Chachapoya cultural practice (e.g., Bueno and Cornejo 2009; Koschmieder 2014; Taylor 1989). To be sure, Chachapoyas is characterized by many of the same attributes used to infer the presence of warfare in other regions, namely hilltop settlement patterns and high rates of cranial trauma (Arkush and Tung 2013). Trauma rates, however, are com­parable to those encountered elsewhere, and Chachapoya sites are, in fact, rarely characterized by the perimeter walls, ditches, and parapets com­mon to other areas (Church and von Hagen 2008:913; Lerche 1995:30; Nystrom and Toyne 2013). The massive wall of Kuelap presents a no­table exception, to be sure, but researchers now recognize that many of its attributes are better ex­plained by ritual functions designed to integrate people than by defensive ones intended to keep them out (Narvaez 2013). 
Extra-regional Interaction 
Chachapoyas and other regions of the Eastern An­des have further been marginalized from narratives of Andean social and cultural development as a result of the environmentally deterministic as­sumption that access to these regions would have been as difficult for ancient peoples as it is for us today (Church 1996; Lyon 1981; Raymond 1976). Many scholars have asserted that Chachapoyas developed in relative isolation from other parts of the Andes, cut off by dense forests and the deep gorge of the Marafi6n River (e.g., Kauffman 2009:26-27; Lerche 1995:23; Schjellerup 2005: 377, 452). Others have attributed the origins of Chachapoya culture to regional groups from else­where. Bonavia (1968) and Kauffman (2009) have argued that this area was first colonized by Ink.a or other highland groups in search of new agri­cultural lands. Some scholars contend that it was settled by Amazonian groups who displaced in­digenous populations around A.D. 1000 (Koschmieder 2015; Lerche 1995), or that Chachapoya culture resulted from indigenous Ji­varoan-related groups emulating neighboring An­deans (Bueno and Cornejo 2009). None of these models have yet been validated through archaeo­logical evidence, however, and migrationist argu­ments in particular are challenged by increasing evidence of long sequences of autochthonous cul­tural development (e.g., Church 1994; Guengerich 2014a; Ruiz 2009; Schjellerup 2005:347-354) similar to what is seen in most of the Andean highlands (e.g., D' Altroy and Hastorf 2001; Her­rera 2003; Julien 1988; Parsons et al. 2000, 2013). 
The idea that the inhabitants of this region were either cut off from the rest of the highlands or only passive recipients of cultural changes originating elsewhere is particularly belied by a growing body of data demonstrating that they participated in far­flung networks of trade and interaction beginning in the Early Horizon (Church 1996; Church and von Hagen 2008). Ceramics spanning the Initial to Late Cajamarca periods (100 B.C.-A.D. 1200) have been found at many sites (e.g., Narvaez 2013:130; Ruiz 2009:70--71; Schjellerup 2005: 352-354, 359), and Spondylus shell was present in an EIP ritual

context at Monte Viudo (Guengerich 2014a:l01). Interaction with Amazonian societies is attested by unusually well preserved organic materials from the LIP/Late Horizon site of Laguna de los C6n­dores, including feather headdresses and mummi­fied forest felines (von Hagen 2002a), as well as by lowland gourds from a late LIP ritual deposit at Monte Viudo (Guengerich 2014a:274) and caiman vertebrae in domestic contexts of an unspecified date at Kuelap (Narvaez 2013:117). Outside of Chachapoyas, at the late EIP/Middle Horizon coastal site of San Jose de Moro, archaeologists have found miniature models of Chachapoya sar­cophagi (Fabre 2006:163). Chachapoyas was also the primary source of espingo, a psychotropic nut that has been used by Andean groups ranging from the Moche to the Kallawaya curanderos of modem Bolivia (Wassen 1979). 
Unwarranted emphasis on endemic warfare, migration, and geographic isolation, coupled with, until very recently, a shortage of survey, excava­tion, and bioarchaeological data, has given scholars little reason to assume that cultural developments taking place in Chachapoyas were germane to those elsewhere. As a consequence, Chachapoyas has suffered a fate common to the Eastern Andes of remaining stranded between two artificially po­larized bodies of scholarship-the Andes and the Amazon (Kojan 2002; Saignes 1985). Increasing attention being paid to evidence of extra-regional exchange is beginning to change this narrative (e.g., Church and von Hagen 2008), offering a productive avenue for tracing the social mecha­nisms that connected cultural macro-regions. In the following section, I tum to another body of data that likewise helps to illuminate the nature of the relationship between Chachapoyans and other Andean groups that underwent major social and cultural changes during the late pre-Inkaic period. 
Chachapoya Built Environments 
Archaeological research in Chachapoyas began in earnest only in the late 1960s, and spatial or­ganization and architecture are among the last datasets to be scientifically studied. To date, most research has focused on the monumental regional center of Kuelap (Narvaez 1996a, 1996b, 2013; Ruiz 2009) and on mortuary archaeology and bioarchaeology (Fabre et al. 2008; Guillen 2002; Nystrom et al. 2010; Nystrom and Toyne 2013). Kuelap, Gran Pajaten (Bonavia 1968; Church 1994), and Monte Viudo (Guengerich 2014a) rep­resent the most extensively mapped and exca­vated settlement sites; besides these, sketch or scale maps, architectural descriptions, and more limited excavations have been published from the areas of Luya (Koschmieder 2012, 2015), Cheto (Fabre 2006; Ruiz 2007; Ruiz 2004), south of Mendoza (Schjellerup et al. 2003, 2009), the Huabayacu drainage (Bueno and Cornejo 2009), and the Utcubamba-Atuen drainage (Langlois 1939, 1940a, 1940b; Muscutt 1998; Muscutt et al. 1993; Schjellerup 2005:307-377; Thompson 1973, 1976). 
Kuelap remains by far the best studied settle­ment site, yet we should be cautious in using its many unusual features as a baseline for general­izations about Chachapoya built environments. Its perimeter wall is exponentially larger than any similar feature in the region; it houses the Tintero, a solid structure with a central shaft that is dissimilar to any other construction in Chachapoyas; it contains an unusual number of exotic materials, such as obsidian and ceramics; and it contains hundreds of human remains, which were placed in pits, house floors, terraces, chull­pas, and in the perimeter wall (Narvaez 2013). In contrast, Monte Viudo provides a more repre­sentative view of architecture, spatial organiza­tion, and quotidian practice in most Chachapoya villages (Guengerich 2014a). This site exhibits attributes common to settlement sites, including mountaintop location, steep topography, and the absence of perimeter walls and monumental ar­chitecture. At 300 structures, it is slightly larger than average in size. Its built environment consists almost entirely of circular limestone buildings that extend along four ridges that intersect in the form of an X (Figure 3). The earliest date associ­ated with a domestic structure at the site is A.D. 775-975, but a set of dates beginning around 
A.D. 1250 indicates that the principal occupation was during the second half of the LIP (Guengerich 2014b:7). Monte Viudo was abandoned around the time oflnka incursion into Chachapoyas, as suggested by a terminal cluster of radiocarbon dates around A.D. 1450 and the near-total absence oflnka-style artifacts or architecture (Guengerich 2014a:106-114).

Settlement Locations 
Chachapoya settlements were located on moun­taintops, peaks, and ridges, with only a handful of exceptions known (Langlois 1940a:68; Schjellerup 2005:308-319). Unfortunately, our currently poor understanding of EIP chronology and our complete lack of knowledge of both EIP and LIP settlement patterns give us little sense of when and why peo­ple began to move to hilltops. Of the dozen settle­ment sites that have been radiocarbon dated to the LIP, three have also produced dates from the EIP. Nonetheless, in two of these sites the dates come from ritual contexts of limited extent (Guengerich 2014a:98-104; Narvaez 2013:150), while the lack of primary depositional contexts at the third makes it difficult to ascertain the nature of EIP occupation (Church 1994). 
As in other parts of the LIP highlands, the im­petus for the hilltop settlement pattern has most commonly been attributed to defensive concerns in conditions of heightened violence (Espinoza 1967:235-236; Langlois 1940b; Narvaez 1988). Many of the additional defensive features present in other regions, however-such as ditches, baf­fled entries, and concentric sets of walls (e.g., Arkush 2008; Covey 2008; Frye and de la Vega 2005; Nielsen 2002; Schreiber 1987; Toohey 2009)-are not found in Chachapoyas. Parapets have only been identified at Vira Vira (Muscutt et al. 1993). Perimeter walls have been recorded at five sites (e.g., Langlois 1939; Muscutt et al. 1993; Schjellerup 2005:347-354; Thompson 1976). In several of these, substantial portions of the settle­ment are located outside the wall. 
The absence of these features, of course, should not be taken to imply that defense was not a deter­mining factor in site location (Arkush and Stanish 2005). Yet it is important to recognize that, at the same time, hilltop settlements offered a number of advantages. Since flat terrain is scarce in this region, communities may have sought to reserve
