The Inka are justly famous for their distinctive archi­tectural style and their megalithic tradition. This book centers on one of the primary elements of the Inka's natural and cultural world-stone. No previous stud­ies of Inka material culture have taken stone itself as the focal point of investigation, and rarely has this sub­stance been explicitly theorized as a key cultural cate­gory and something potentially more than just inert matter. In this regard, as well as in the conscious attempt to view Inka stonework through a local indigenous (rather than Western) lens, Dean's book is a departure from the norm and as such offers a number of original insights into native Andean ontologies and the signifi­cance of stone. Among these is the discussion of tran­substantiation in Andean thought and, vis-a-vis rock, erasure of the intellectual divide between modified and unmodified stone; ideas about rock as kin; and the rela­tionship between landscape, ancestors, and rock. The evidence utilized in this study includes Inka stonework itself, early Colonial references to such, and modern ethnographic and folkloric information pertaining to the cultural significance of stone. While Dean is an art his­torian by training, the book is consciously structured (though not stridently so) as an argument against the imposition of Western art ideals and art historical cat­egories on the "visual culture" of non-Western/pre­columbian societies. To this end, the author opts for an anthropological approach in attempting to better under­stand Inka stonework from the inside out. 
The book is divided into five chapters-an Intro­duction followed by four 40-page chapters (and a volu­minous 75 pages of notes)-that take the reader logically and substantively through the author's argu­ment regarding the idea that stone, for the Inka, was simultaneously a vital component of both the natural and social world. In Chapter One, the author focuses on discerning how the Inka themselves conceived of and classified rock rather than a priori dividing it into such familiar categories as "sculpture," "architecture," "natural," etc. To this end, she first provides a set of criteria useful for physically identifying rocks that the Inka regarded as significant. This is followed by a review of Inkaic categories of significant stones based on named types found in early documentary sources. Analysis of this ethno-taxonomy leads to the idea that what was key for the lnka in terms of classifying rock was neither style nor form but rather the essence and function of lithic entities, particularly with respect to their roles in the construction of cultural places and "memoryscapes"-hence the title of Chapter One­"Rock and Remembrance." 
The next chapter, "Rock and Reciprocity," begins with a passage from a contemporary Quechua story from which the author extracts insights into indigenous thinking on the relationship between the natural and cul­tural realms. Drawing analogies between agriculture and architecture, she discusses both as key features of civilization in Andean thought insofar as they are human activities that bring order to nature through the "domes­tication" of specific natural entities, e.g., plants and stone. The author makes the case that the impressive agricultural terracing found throughout the Inca Empire represents an important point of intersection between the cultural practices of building and planting. Another insightful point derived from "reading" Inka stonework concerns the "cooperative" and gendered nature of the relationship that the Inka maintained with the natural order. These and other ideas presented in this chapter offer new ways of understanding and explaining some of the more puzzling aspects of Inca architecture, such as the common practice of integrating living rock into the overall design of buildings and settlements. 
The penultimate chapter, "Rock and Rule," outlines the political implications of the Inka's stone-working practices and the ways in which their manipulation of

fixed features in the landscape lent legitimacy to the imperial enterprise. Since the time of Gilgamesh, kings and rulers have grounded their claims to power in their ability to bring "order" to "chaos"-an assertion often made manifest through large-scale building and land modification projects. The lords of Cuzco were no exception but were perhaps exceptional in their archi­tectural ventures and their building "ethos." Dean argues that the Inka state's tactic of "inextricably linking its distinct built environment with the natural environment made clear and permanent visual statements about belonging and ... ownership of territory" (p. 105). Through the process of "grafting" (a term introduced by the author) imperial architecture onto local outcrops and natural features, the Inka were in essence "natu­ralizing" the legitimacy of their right to rule. As sug­gested in this chapter, the fine masonry and impressive architecture characteristic of the Inka state were criti­cal components of "place-making" and an important part of the overall imperial agenda. Also discussed in this chapter are various forms of Inka "place-taking," involving the use of stonework for framing, demarcat­ing, and otherwise co-opting significant local features (e.g., huacas), as well as the role of ushnus and lithic seats vis-a-vis the notion of oversight and claims to imperial possession. 
The last chapter, "Rock in Ruins," considers the ways in which modern tourists interact with and inter­pret Inka stonework in the context of Cuzco, situating tourist practices and imaginings on a continuum with the Spanish conquistadors' initial encounters with and reactions to the built environment of the lnka. The dis­cussion focuses on how deep-seated Western biases toward "imagistic" renderings and representation has for centuries privileged iconicity over what the author describes as "Inkanicity," resulting in misreadings and mystification oflnka stonework and generally limiting our ability to understand the significance of "aniconic­ity" within Inkaic and Andean systems of meaning. In concluding, the author argues for the importance of developing an aniconological approach to the study of Inka stonework and material culture as a way of gain­ing further insight into native Andean ontologies. 
In sum, A Culture of Stone represents an original and scholarly contribution to Andean studies. It incor­porates information from a number of disciplinary realms to provide fresh insights into the role of rock in Andean culture. Within a hermeneutical framework, the book offers a compelling interpretation of the mean­ing and significance of different types of stone and stonework for the Inka that furthers our understanding of non-Western views regarding the notions of nature and culture. The book will be of particular interest to Inka specialists and precolumbian scholars in the areas of archaeology, anthropology, art, and art history. It should also be useful to scholars in the fields of land­scape studies, architecture, material culture studies, and colonial Latin America for its particular material focus and its comparative value. Given the highly accessible style in which it is written, A Culture of Stone should also appeal to a general readership with interests in the Inka, the Andes, and the precolumbian world.
