DECIPHERING THE HANDWRITING ON THE WALL: 
SOME ASTRONOMICAL INTERPRETATIONS 
OF THE RECENT DISCOVERIES AT XULTUN, GU ATEMAL A 

Victoria R. Bricker, Anthony F. Aveni, and Harvey M. Bricker 
This study places the recently excavated ninth-century AD.four-part calendrical notations at Xu/tun (Lunar Table, Ring Number, Long Count, and Multiplication Table) in the context of both Classic monumental inscriptions and astronomical knowledge in the Postclassic Dresden Codex. We demonstrate that the Lunar Table employed a formula attributed to Palenque and that it could have been used as a device to determine precisely where to break the sequence of alternating 29-and 30-day months one finds on dated monuments. All four categories found at Xu/tun appear in the Dresden Codex. The Ring Number, which bridges a date in the deep past with one in the recently completed era, is a perfect fit with one of the most fundamental Dresden eclipse cycles. Our analysis of glyphs accompanying the Long Count date enables us to place candidate eclipses, especially one that corresponds with a conjunction of Mars, in real time. We argue that the large multiples were extracted from, or prepared for, warning tables like the Dresden eclipse table, and we demonstrate why such tables must have existed well before the Xu/tun inscriptions. Thus, while the writings in the Dresden manuscript constitute a finished product, the writing on the wall of residential Structure JOK-2 is more akin to what one might find in an astronomer's notebook. 
Sabre las murallas de la recien excavada estructura residencial denominada IOK-2 en Xultt.in, Guatemala (fechada para el siglo nueve d.C.), aparecen cuatro notaciones calendd.ricas (una tabla lunar, un Nt.imero de Anillo, una fecha de la Cuenla Larga, y una tabla de mt.iltiplos ). Este estudio sitt.ia estas notaciones en el contexto de las inscripciones cld.sicas monumental es y el conocimiento astronamico de! Cadice de Dresde de! perfodo poscld.sico. Mostramos que la tabla lunar emplea una farmula posiblemente desarrollada en Palenque con la intencian de determinar precisamente en dande interrumpir la alternacian de los meses de 29 y 30 dfas que se encuentren en monumentos fechados del periodo cld.sico. Las cuatro categorfas encontradas en Xultt.in se manifiestan en el Cadice de Dresde. El Nt.imero de Anillo, que conecta una fecha en el pasado remoto con una en la era actual, se ajusta precisamente con uno de los md.s fundamentales ciclos de eclipses. Nuestro and.lisis de los glifos ubicados al la derecha de la fecha de la Cuenta Larga facilita la colocacian de eclipses posibles en el tiempo histarico, espe­cialmente un eclipse que Jue en conjuncian con el planeta Marte. Mostramos que los mt.iltiplos grandes fueron extraidos de o preparados para tablas de advertencia en la misma forma que la tabla de eclipses en el Cadice de Dresde, y que tales tablas existfan mucho antes que las inscripciones sabre las mural/as de la estructura en Xultt.in. Por lo tanto, aunque las escrituras en el manuscrito de Dresde representan un producto final, la escritura sabre las mural/as de la estructura JOK-2 se parece md.s a la que se encontrarfa en el cuaderno perteneciente a un astranomo.

appeared. The initial announcement in Science (Saturno et al. 2012) was, quite appropriately, heavily descriptive, and the interpretations offered were preliminary and tentative. Much the same was true of an early online report (Zender and Skidmore 2012), which gave additional emphasis to the iconography of painted murals adjacent to, but not obviously related to, the astronomical no­tations. A more technical treatment of the hiero­glyphic notations (Aveni et al. 2013) was intended primarily as a contribution to the history of as­tronomy and the history of mathematics. The in­formation in these previous works is taken into account here. Additionally, however, we attempt to place the Xultun numerical inscriptions in a broader archaeological and cultural context. We emphasize their relationship to the extended cor­pus of Classic inscriptions familiar to Mesoamer­ican archaeologists, and we discuss in greater de­tail than in previous articles their relationship to the astronomical knowledge contained in the Postclassic Dresden Codex. 
The Lunar Table in Area A 
A table inscribed on the east wall of the early ninth-century A.D. Structure lOK-2 at Xultun, Guatemala (Area A in Figure 1 ), was first recog­nized by David Stuart as a lunar table related very specifically to the Lunar Series calendar of Classic Maya inscriptions (Aveni et al. 2013; Sa­turno et al. 2012). It contains columns of bar­and-dot numbers, each of which represents the cumulative total resulting from the addition of modules of 177 or 178 days, representing six lu­nar synodic months (one lunar trimester), to 
= 
the antecedent columnar total (Figure 2a). The layout and dimensions (5 x 48 cm) of this table resemble the series of cumulative totals in each of the 69 columns of the eclipse table in the Dres­den Codex (Figure 2b), dating to the mid-to-late eighth century A.D.,1 but it lacks the occasional module of 148 days or five lunar synodic months that are necessary for approximating the eclipse cycle. In what follows, we will show that the

table could have been used in conjunction with the Lunar Series recorded on Classic Maya mon­uments. It could have functioned as a device for determining where to break the sequence of al­ternating 29-and 30-day months by adding an extra day to a 29-day month in order to approxi­mate the true length of the lunar synodic month for epoch 800 A.D. (29.53059 days). The Palenque formula, a lunar month of 29.53086 days, involving the equation 81 mo. 2392d,

was used for this purpose at Xultun. This is evi­dent in the grouping of the 27 columns of num­bers structured into nine sets of three columns, each adding up to a period of 4,784 days (4784d

2 x 2392d 162 x 29.53086d), which agrees perfectly with the 18-month lunar calendar that underlies the Lunar Series in Classic Maya in­scriptions , as originally proposed by John Linden in 1986 and subsequently refined by him in 1996. 
The Lunar Series is part of the so-called Sup­plementary Series that follows Initial Series dates in texts on many Classic Maya monuments (Mor­ley 1916) (see Figure 3). It is composed of six glyphs, labelled as Glyphs E, D, C, X, B, and A.

Glyphs E and D refer to the age of the Moon on the day recorded by the Initial Series. The moon age is how many days have been completed since the beginning of that lunar synodic month. Glyph D is composed of signs that represent the verb huliy, or "it arrived."2 If the moon age is less than 20 days, Glyph E does not appear, and a bar-and­dot number prefixed to Glyph D specifies the age of the Moon. Glyph E represents the number "20"; it is prefixed to Glyph D if the age of the Moon has reached 20 days, and bar-and-dot num­bers are prefixed to Glyph E when the age of the Moon exceeds 20 days (e.g., a single dot repre­senting "l ," two dots for "2 ," a bar for "5 ," etc.). In the Lunar Series inscription on Stela 10 at Piedras Negras (Figure 3), the coefficient of Glyph Dis "9" (one bar and four dots), indicating that the moon age was nine days on the Initial Series date that introduces the inscription 
(9.15.10.0.0 3 Ahau 3 Mol =June 28, A.D. 741, Gregorian [June 24, A.D. 741, Julian]). Glyph C begins a new clause that specifies the position of a month in a lunar trimester. It consists of four elements: (1) a bar-and-dot number representing a coefficient that ranges from "2" to "6" or, in the case of the first month of the lunar trimester, either no coefficient or the glyph for na, meaning "first"; (2) the head of one of three deities that have been described as a skull, the head of a woman, and "mythical" (Linden 1996:345),3 fol-

The deity head signals which lunar trimester in an 18-month calendar composed of three trimesters is the one in question (Linden 1996). Glyph X has multiple variants that refer to spe­cific months in the lunar trimesters (Linden 1986:123-125). The one on Stela 10 at Piedras Negras is the X4 variant. Glyph B says that Glyph Xis "the name" (u kaba) of the "young" (ch'oc) Moon referred to by the coefficient of Glyph C, and Glyph A, which is composed of the glyph for "20" plus a postfixed or subfixed coefficient of "9" (one bar and four dots) or "IO" (two bars), assigns a 29-or 30-day value to the length of that month. The value of Glyph A in the Lunar Series on Stela 10 at Piedras Negras is "30," in­dicating that the month in question had 30 days (Figure 3) (the head variant of "10" is used here, instead of two bars). The Lunar Series is brack­eted by the two parts of the Calendar Round per­mutation associated with the Initial Series date, with the tzalkin expression (3 Ahau) preceding it and the haab expression (3 Mol) immediately following it. 
The inscription on Stela 10 at Piedras Negras mentions only that Glyph C refers to the third month of a lunar trimester designated as "skull." It does not specify whether the month in question is the current month that is nine days old or the previous month that has been completed. To our knowledge, only one inscription in the Maya cor­pus of ca. 400 Lunar Series contains such infor­mation, namely Stela 1 at Sacul, whose text is il­lustrated in Figures 4 and 5. 
The Initial Series date on this stela is 
9.16.10.0.0 1 Ahau 3 Zip (:::: March 15, A.D. 761 [Gregorian]) (Figure 4). Glyph D says that the age of the Moon on that day was four days; the coefficient of Glyph C is "1" (expressed in words rather than numerically as u-na "the first") (Figure 5). The variant of Glyph Xis X2a, and the value of Glyph A is "30" (this time with two bars rep­resenting "1 O"). 
As on Piedras Negras Stela 10 (Figure 3), the two parts of the Calendar Round permutation as­sociated with the Initial Series date bracket the Lunar Series, with the tzalkin expression (1 Ahau) preceding it and the haab expression (3 Zip) fol­lowing it, but in this case, the haab expression

does not immediately follow Glyph A (Figures 4 and 5). A pair of collocations referring to the "struck" or "beaten" (hadzal) fire (kak) of the Sun or Sun god (ahau kin) lies between Glyph A and 3 Zip (Figure 5).4 This unusual statement can be explained by the fact that the Initial Series date falls exactly 30 days after an annular solar eclipse on Julian Day Number 1,999,053 (9.16.9.16.10
= 
10 Oc 13 Pop and February 13,A.D. 761 [Grego­rian]). If the weather was good that day at Sacul, the eclipse should have been visible for about three-quarters of an hour before sunset. It began shortly after 5:00 p.m. (local time), but the Sun would have set within a few minutes of 6:00 p.m., while the eclipse was still very much in progress. Because a big part of the solar disk was occulted, or at least something had affected its visibility, observers could have gotten the impression that the Sun had been struck before it set. The same eclipse was predicted in column 11 of the eclipse table of the Dresden Codex to have taken place three days earlier on Julian Day Number 1,999 ,050 (Bricker and Bricker 2011:278, Table 9-2). The coefficients of Glyphs D ("4") and C ("l ") in the Lunar Series (Figure 5) imply that the current lunar trimester began 33 days earlier than the Ini­tial Series date on Julian Day Number 1,999,050, which is also the date predicted for the solar eclipse in the Dresden Codex. The fact that the beginning of the lunar trimester recorded in this inscription occurred near an eclipse syzygy (a new Moon or full Moon date on which a solar or lunar eclipse occurs) explains the reference to the striking or beating of the Sun (ahau kin), while it was being eclipsed. And because the solar eclipse occurred a few days more than one month before the Initial Series date, Glyph C must refer to the month that has been completed.

Figure 6. Linden's model for the 18-month calendar employed during the Period of Uniformity (after Linden 1996:350, 

Figure 3). 
The Maya number system records only inte­gers , but the mean length of the lunar synodic month is 29.53059 days, which is not a whole number. Nonetheless, if a 29-day period is fol­lowed by a 30-day period, the total is 59 days, the mean of which is 29.5 days, which is a close approximation of the true mean of the lunar pe­riod. In recognition of the significance of this 59­day period for approximating the length of suc­cessive lunar months, some of the variants of Glyph X serve as the names of two consecutive months, instead of only one. Thus, in Linden's model of the 18-month calendar (Linden 1996:350 , Figure. 3) , the X2 variant of Glyph X represents the names of the first two months in the first trimester (Figure 6). Similarly, the X4 variant names both the third and fourth months in that trimester. There are a few exceptions to this pattern of naming, as in the case of the X5 variant, which names only the fifth month in the second trimester, although both the fourth and fifth months are in the third trimester; neverthe­less the general pattern is clear. Furthennore , if what would be a 29-day period in the alternating sequence is occasionally replaced by a 30-day period, an even closer approximation to the true mean can be achieved. Linden (1986: 134) has phrased the matter as follows: 
When the months of the Glyph X calendar are assigned alternating 30-day and 29-day values ... beginning with 30 days in the first month and ending with 29 days in the eighteenth month, an average of 29.5 days per month is produced. If the value of the eighteenth month is changed from 29 days to 30 days, the average per month becomes 29 .55555 days. Nine rep­etitions of the Glyph X calendar, five with the eighteenth month having a 30-day value (2,660 days) and four with the eighteenth month hav­ing a 29-day value (2,124 days) yields a total of 4,784 days in 162 months, which is an aver­age of 29.53086 days per month. 
The value of 29 .53086 days in a lunar synodic month, derived by dividing 4,784 days by 162 months (27 groups of 6 months each), is what has been called the Palenque formula (Teeple 1931 :65). This is exactly what is recorded in the lunar table at Xultun, which contains 27 6-month groupings represented by 27 columns of cumu­lative totals of days. The cumulative total of the twenty-seventh column, which, fortunately, is quite legible (Saturno et al. 2012:715), is 4,784 days (13 .5 .4 in Maya notation). This suggests that lunar calculations at Xultun were carried out using the Palenque formula.
