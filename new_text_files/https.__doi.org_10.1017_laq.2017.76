Very few English publications better exemplify the merit of long-term interdisciplinary collaboration of an explicitly Mexican character than Linda Man­zanilla’s edited volume, Multiethnicity and Migra­tion at Teopancazco: Investigations at a Teotihua­can Neighborhood Center. Through 10 chapters, archaeologists, physical anthropologists, physicists, geochemists, geophysicists, DNA specialists, artists, geologists, and geoarchaeologists detail the multi­ethnicoccupationof a neighborhood centeratTeoti­huacan,Mexico(AD 1–550).First andforemost,I congratulatetheauthorsonthisfeat.Thiscollaborative strategy, consistently implemented from the initial research design, through rigorous excavation, sam­pling, and documentation ofeach context,facilitated highly precise laboratory analysis. It is inspiring to seeeverythingfromisotopeandelemental analysisto aDNA extraction taking place within local Mexican institutions that also contribute solid methodological advancements to the .eld. Each chapter builds on theprevious one,enhancingthe interpretive potential of each methodology and cross-verifying the results. An exercise in extraordinaryleadership,Manzanilla’s volume is both a portal into the livelihood of this multiethnic center,as wellasanoverviewof archaeo­metric methodologies applied to human skeletal remains. 
Spanning 13 .eld seasons of excavations at Teopancazco (1997–2003) at the project “Teotihua­can: Elite and Rulership,” Manzanilla’s volume for­mulates a comprehensive methodological narrative evaluating theimpactof immigrantin.uenceonthis neighborhood center and on the city as a whole. Thedistinctive customsandmaterialcultureof these immigrants, who hailed from various locales along keytrade corridors linked to the Gulf Coast, de.ned thesocioeconomicroleofTeopancazco (Chapter1by Manzanilla). Chapters arebroadly grouped according to analytical techniques applied on 116 spatially and diachronically controlledburials.Ageneraloverview of this skeletal assemblage, interpreted through a physical anthropologist’s lens with particular focus on activity markers and pathologies, introduces the subject population(Chapter2by Alvarado andMan­zanilla). The subsequent four chapters examine the chemical signature of their skeletal remains. Two of these(chapter3by Mejía Appel, andchapter4 by Casar et al.) discuss diet through elemental and carbon/nitrogen stable isotopes, while the other two (chapter5byMorales et al., andchapter6bySolís Pichardo et al.) attempt to resolvemigrationpatterns from clusters of oxygen and strontium isotopic sig­natures. The next two chapters extract aDNA from this assemblage to source the genetic makeup of the city (chapter7byÁlvarez Sandoval et al.)andtosex childburials(chapter8by ÁlvarezSandoval et al.). Finally,we meet .veindividuals renderedusingfacial approximationmethods (chapter9byEscorciaetal.). Cumulatively, these data furnish a nuanced model of the diet, health, and well-being of the population (chapters2,3,4), theage/sex andoccupation of the residents(chapters2,8),and theethnicbackground of theTeopancazcoburials(chapters 1–10).In-depth biographical narratives of speci.c individuals also come to lifethrough this synthesis(chapter10by Manzanilla). 
Newer and more precise archaeometric applications continueto demystifythe ethnicmakeup of thecity.While thepresenceofethnicenclaves(e.g., Merchant’s Barrio, Oaxaca Barrio, and Michoacán enclave) have long attested to Teotihuacan’s metro­politan constitution, the timing and scale of their

respectivemigrant populations’ economicimpact on thecityhave remained unclear.Tothisend,the book attemptsto modelasegmentoftheTeopancazco pop­ulation(byage, sexpro.le, occupation, health,etc.) as abasis for understanding theinternalsocialstructure of intermediate elitesatTeotihuacan.Drawing on her experienceexcavatinglow status (Oztoyohualco) and elite(Xalla)compounds atTeotihuacan,Manzanilla contextualizes and extrapolates these Teopancazco .ndings intoa postulationonthe natureofthesocial structures that inform and characterize the city’s dynamic socioeconomiclandscape. 
Manzanilla’s commendable strategy of sourcing acrossaspectrumofanalytical methodologies yieldsa goldmineofrawdata. Synthesizingthese.ndingswith relevant comparative data within Teotihuacan itself (chapter 5) and other Mesoamerican sites(chapters 4 and 7) reveals many features unique to Teopan­cazco.Forexample, adultmales wereextremelyover­represented(85%), while male andfemale children wereequally distributed(chapters2 and 8).Adults also featured a high incidence (29%) of nutritional stress during infancy, suggesting that the need for better quality of life (food rations andjob security) may have been a common impetus of outmigration from three separate regions along the Gulf Coast tradecorridor (chapter 10).Iwould caution,however, that the 38 decapitated individuals (~30% of the skeletal sample) mustbeinterpreted separately,asthis group is a signi.cant source of the skew toward a male-and foreign-dominatedcomposition. Thehighly specialized context means they are not necessarily representative of natural deaths nor of the resident population. 
The chapters successfully summarize each archaeometry method and its application, but they frequently lack proprietary and otherwise relevant diagnostic and technical factors as well as raw data tables. The volume would greatly bene.t from their inclusion, in appendix form if necessary. Without these, the reader must rely solely on summary .gures andtables(whichshouldhavebeen publishedincolor or corrected for proper representation in grayscale), and will have dif.culty assessing which samples were discarded due to failed diagenesis testing on bone strontium, carbonates, and dentine collagen. Nonetheless, taken in its entirety, the data in this volume form a coherent and useful guideline for many archaeologists navigating the increasingly specialized maze of archaeometry. 
In thewakeofdebates concerning thesocialstruc­tureofTeotihuacan, its ethnicmakeup, and modelsof urban population dynamics (references within chapter 10),the comprehensive approach to metadata integra­tionpresentedin thisvolumeisawelcome sight.From it, Manzanilladrawstwoimportant conclusions.First, the multiethnic nature of Teopancazco’s residents de.ned its social structure as a neighborhood center, precisely becauseofthespecial relationshipthis center hadwithGulfCoasttrade routes.Secondly,itisargued thatTeopancazco representsa “house” structure, with three main ethnic groups socioeconomically united by their common participation in activities such as rituals, feasting, craftwork, and trade (chapter 10). The portrait of Teopancazco in this volume devel­ops from its exemplary approach to multidisciplinary data acquisition. Findings fromfutureexcavationsof Teotihuacan compounds, compiled according to the strategy outlined in this volume, would serve as ideal referencesto testthe modelsadvocatedbyManzanilla and colleagues.

This book explores Classic Maya (AD 250–900) concepts of the body and the soul and how they relate to life, death and burial. The author not only draws fromarchaeology andbioarchaeologybut also fromMaya epigraphy,iconography, ethnohistory and ethnography. 
Chapter1,Lived Bodies,focusesonthelivedMaya body and introduces ethnographic Maya soul con­cepts, co-essences and supernaturals, and discusses the importance of the head as evidenced through historic and iconographic sources. Cranial shaping, tooth modi.cation, diet, sex, gender and aging, and disease are also addressed. Because the treatment of the bodyin both lifeand deathisperceived asa lens into Classic Maya conceptions of body and soul, in Chapter 2, Dead Bodies, the author looks into body treatmentssuchaswrapping andbundling, adornment of thehead,the useof red pigment on thedead body, and the symbolism of associated artifacts such as deathmasks andjadeornaments.The afterlifeofdead bodies,with theirexhumationand transformationinto objects(e.g.,bowlsmadefrom humancrania)forritual purposes, is touched upon as well.
