JUVENILE AGE ESTIMATION USING DIAPHYSEAL LONG BONE 
LENG THS AMONG ANCIENT MAYA POPULATIONS

Standards for diaphyseal lengths of the femur, humerus, and tibia that can be used in juvenile age estimation for the ancient Maya are presented. It is argued that these new standards are necessary given differences 
in stature and limb proportion in Mesoamerican groups compared to the prehistoric North American groups upon whom the current available standards have been developed. Using data from 96 juveniles in the protohistoric Maya series from Tipu, Belize, regression equations were developed to predict age of dental development using diaphyseal lengths; all had excellent fit and statistical signifi­cance. When the equations were tested with diaphyseal lengths from other Mesoamerican populations, the results were sup­portive of such application. 
Se presentan Los estdndares de las longitudes de los didfises def humero, femur, y tibia, las cuales serdn usadas en la esti­maci6n de las edades juveniles en poblaciones mayas prehist6ricas. Se propone que estos estdndares nuevos son necesarios ya que las estdndares empleados actualmente jiteron desarollados en poblaciones norteamericanas y existen diferencias en estatura y las proporciones de las miembros entre estas poblaciones prehfstoricas y las pohlaciones prehist6ricas Mayas. Usando datos de 75 j6venes en la serie Maya protohist6rica de Tipu, Belice, se produjeron ecuaciones de regresi6n para pre­decir la edad de desarrollo dental basada en las longitudes de las didfises; todas tenian la bondad excelente de ajuste y la sig­nificaci6n estadistica. Cuando estas ecuaciones fueron comparadas con datos tomados de otras pohlaciones mesoamericanas, las curvas parecen ser bastante coherentes.

especially prone to such conditions given their lesser bone mass compared to that of adults (Walker 1997). The generally poor preservation of Maya skeletal remains due to the acidic soils of the Yucatan is well known, and the limitations it places on the work of bioarchaeologists are numerous, especially in the area of sample size. Therefore, it is necessary for researchers to have available as many aging techniques for juveniles as possible. 
Among the bioarchaeological methods com­monly used in estimation of chronological age, evaluation of dental development and eruption is considered the most reliable (Johnston and Zim­mer 1989; Ubelaker 1989) since teeth are less affected by nutritional inadequacies or other health disruptions compared to other skeletal elements (Demirjian 1986; Garn et al. 1965). However, they are not always present or able to be utilized. Some­times crania may be missing, having been removed at time of death for ritualistic purposes or later dur­ing secondary reburial or pothunting. Fragile decid­uous teeth are especially vulnerable to destruction by taphonomic processes. Ossuaries also present analysis challenges since each bone element must be evaluated separately. In these situations, long bone epiphyseal union can be employed in evalu­ating age at death in adolescent skeletons. 
If epiphyseal union has not occurred, however, lengths of long bone diaphyses can provide age esti­mates (Scheuer and Black 2004; Ubelaker 1989). Although growth data from modem populations in which children's chronological ages are known could be used to establish standards for this pur­pose (e.g., Falhauber 1976), such samples are typ­ically not appropriate to apply to ancient groups with highly different genetic, nutritional, and dis­ease experiences. Consequently, standards are gen­erally created based on analysis of juveniles from prehistoric skeletal samples for whom dental age was able to be determined and diaphyseal length could be measured. Several of these model curves produced from graphing mean diaphyseal lengths by age have been developed for ancient North American populations, including the protohistoric Arikara (Merchant and Ubelaker 1977), Late Woodland Illinois Valley (Walker 1969), and the Archaic Indian Knoll (Johnston 1962; Sundick 1972). Researchers have also long noted that growth patterns are population specific (Demirjian et al. 1985), and no model curves have thus far 
been established for Mesoamerican groups. Such a curve would have potentially been useful in the study of juvenile growth patterns at Xcamb6 (Reyes Gutierrez et al. 2006), where model curves from Indian Knoll were employed instead. 
The need for juvenile aging standards specifi­cally for use with ancient Mesoamericans is sup­ported in a number of ways. Buikstra and Mielke (1985: 387) state that fora growth curve to be appro­priate for use in determining age at death, the two populations involved (the reference population and the population being analyzed) should have expe­rienced similar environmental stresses. Arguably, dietary patterns have the biggest effect in this area, influencing innumerable cultural and health vari­ables from birth spacing to nutritional deficiencies to disease repertoires (Larsen 1995). Subsistence strategies are quite different between Mesoameri­can populations and the North American popula­tions for whom curves have been developed. Mesoamericans have been agricultural for thou­sands of years (Pohl et al. 1996 ), whereas the Indian Knoll, Illinois Valley, andArikara groups were for­aging, transitional to domestication, and horticul­tural, respectively (Blakeslee 1994; Buikstra I 984; Webb 1946). 
Buikstra and Mielke (1985:386) have also sug­gested that when seeking an appropriate reference sample for comparison to an archaeological pop­ulation, the selection of one that is closely related reduces the potential sources of error based on fac­tors such as differences in the genetic potential of growth by age. The probability of genetic differ­ences between North and Central American pop­ulations seems great considering the geographical distance involved. Furthermore, the Maya were in the past, and still are, a very short people (Bogin and Keep 1999; Danforth 1994, 1999a; Marquez and del Angel 1997; Tiesler Blos 2001) compared to most other ancient New World populations (Table 1 ). Such differences have led Ubelaker (1989:62) to recommend that bioarchaeologists analyzing Mesoamerican populations should employ stature estimation formulae developed by Genoves (1967; see also del Angel and Cisneros 2004 ), whereas those analyzing prehistoric pop­ulations from northern North America usually will have more accurate results using the formulae developed by Trotter and Gleser (1958).

subsistence (Graham 1991 ), although ancient Maya dietary practices did vary extensively over space and time (Dunning et al. 1998). It is assumed that this may be extrapolated to their health patterns as well, as evidenced by the fact that the average heights for males and females at Tipu are quite sim­ilar to mean statures reported for a number of other more ancient Maya populations (Table 1). The period of use of the cemetery does allow that indi­viduals buried there may have died of introduced infectious disease, but no suggestions of hurried or multiple burials have been found (Cohen et al. 1997). 
In order to obtain the sample used for this study, those juveniles age 12 years and under who had long bones that required no or minimal estimation for measurement were identified in the Tipu col­lection (n 96), although Hoppa and Gruspier 
= 
( 1998) have developed regression equations to esti­mate length in fragmentary bones. The length of the better-preserved humerus, tibia, or femur for each individual was used, regardless of side. As the most reliable age indicator available among the various skeletal elements (Johnston and Zimmer 1989; Ubelaker 1989), dental development was used to estimate chronological age. The standards employed for this purpose are those presented in Ubelaker (1989:64). Using data from a large num­ber of Native American and "nonwhite" groups, he ( 1989:65) suggests that his compilation likely rep­resents the best dental age estimation standards available for New World juveniles. 
Nevertheless, it should be kept in mind that con­siderable intra-and interpopulation variation exists for timing of tooth development, gingival eruption, and alveolar eruption among populations (Halcrow et al. 2007; Konigsberg and Holman 1997; Liver­sidge 2003). In addition, Lampl and Johnston ( 1996) have shown that dental age often does not always correlate perfectly with chronological age, especially when modern reference samples are used. 
Once dental ages were determined, individuals were placed into age categories, starting with birth to six months followed by intervals of a year after that (i.e., 0-.5 years, .5-1.5 years, etc.), and the mean diaphyseal length by bone was determined for each group. These results were then plotted against the age category in order to develop regres­sion equations for the femur, humerus, and tibia. 
Although males and females display potentially different growth rates, especially in later childhood, they could not be analyzed separately since juve­niles do not exhibit skeletal sex indicators until the later teens (Bass 2005:19). The data were entered into an SPSS (version 15.0) spreadsheet, and a lin­ear regression analysis was run to determine rates of growth as well as the predictive power of long bone length for use in age estimation. 
Results and Discussion 
The sample sizes, mean lengths, standard devia­tions, and ranges by age group for each bone are listed in Table 2. The resultant growth curves with the smoothed values plotted may be found in Fig­ure 1. All three curves show some similarities in pattern, with faster growth in the first few years of life and then again in later childhood when the mid­childhood growth spurt would be expected to take place (Bogin and Smith 1997). The slight lull in growth velocity between ages three and seven or so is particularly observable in the femur. It is also possible that the lull could be an artifact of the rel­atively small sample size involved. 
Regression analysis was run separately for each bone, and significant positive correlations between dental age and long bone length were found for the femur, humerus, and tibia (Figures 2, 3, and 4, respectively). All three regression equations have good characteristics, with excellent fit and statisti­cal significance (Table 3). The model using the tibia has a residual plot that indicates a violation of homoscedasticity to some degree, though with its statistically significant slope coefficient and an r2 value of .93, this is not something that precludes its use. When possible, however, the age estimate gained using the femur should be given greatest weight. The data set for measurements from this bone is relatively large (N 77) compared to those 
= 
for the humerus (N = 40) and tibia (N = 31 ), and there are no missing age groups. In addition, sev­eral researchers have found the femur to be the most correlated with estimating dental age (Hoff­man 1979:467-468; Ubelaker 1974). 
A two-step process in applying the model is rec­ommended. The first step is to apply the appropri­ate regression equation for the bone under consideration to estimate an "exact" age; the sec­ond is to round the estimated age to the nearest

As would be expected, the Maya curve appears to provide good estimation for younger children, but the estimated ages deviate more among older indi­viduals. Although there was a slight tendency to overestimate age at death using the diaphyseal length data, the differences are all about two years or less. It is likely, however, that a variety of cul­tural factors also play a role in variation in adult stature in Mesoamerican populations. For example, differential access to resources affecting health according to status may be in operation, especially considering that all of the individuals tested came

Conclusions 
The primary goal of this study was to establish standards using diaphyseal lengths that could be used for age determination in children specifically for the ancient Maya. This is especially important given the poor preservation of skeletal remains in

the region, which may at times leave bone length as the only employable age indicator for certain individuals. Age estimation using this method, however, must be undertaken with recognition of the fact that growth is greatly subject to diet and disease dynamics; furthermore, even under the best health circumstances, notable variability in long bone length among individuals of the same age will exist. 
The regression equations presented here have limitations in that they are based on data from only one population, and thus the subsistence pattern, cultural practices, and environmental setting that shaped the growth of its members cannot be said to be representative of those affecting all Mesoamerican populations; researchers need to be aware of how populations under study may vary from Tipu in these aspects and how such variation might affect growth. However, it is argued that the equations in general will provide more reliable age estimates than use of the other growth models cur­rently available, all of which are based on data from prehistoric populations from North America.

individuals from Tipu reflect not only the compa­rably shorter stature of Central Americans in gen­eral but also differences in long bone proportions. Differences in genetic backgrounds and subsis­tence practices also likely would have reduced the reliability of existing standards. Thus, not only do these age estimation regression equations consti­tute a valuable tool for bioarchaeologists studying the ancient Maya, but they arguably may be applied to other prehistoric Mesoamerican populations as well.
