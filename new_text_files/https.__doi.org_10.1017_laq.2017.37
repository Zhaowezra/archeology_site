This study discusses the investigation of a series of pit-kilns in and around the prehispanic site of Kiuic in the Puuc region of the northern Maya lowlands and presents the multiple lines of evidence that identify these structures as lime production features. The study reports the results of systematic excavations, archaeometric analyses, archaeological experiments, ethnographic inquiries, and spatial analyses. Burnt lime has been used for architectural, dietary, hygienic, and other purposes by the Maya for at least three millennia and yet its importance in prehispanic Maya society is belied by the lack of lime production features identi.ed in the archaeological record. The identi.cation of these structures as lime production features has implications for understanding subregional differences in socioeconomic organization and resource management practices among the prehispanic Maya. This report provides a model for using multiple methods and analyses to investigate and identify lime production kilns that can be applied to societies and landscapes throughout the Maya area and the broader premodern world. 
En este trabajo se presenta la investigación llevada a cabo en una serie de hornos de tierra en y alrededor del sitio prehispánico de Kiuic en la región Puuc de las tierras bajas Mayas del norte. Se presentan múltiples líneas de evidencia que permiten identi.car estas estructuras como hornos para la producción de cal. Se reportan los resultados de excavaciones sistemáticas, análisis arqueométricos, experimentos arqueológicos, investigaciones etnográ.cas y análisis espaciales. La cal fue y sigue siendo utilizada por los Mayas para .nes arquitectónicos, dietéticos e higiénicos, entre otros, durante al menos tres milenios. Sin embargo, su importancia en la sociedad Maya prehispánica contrasta con la falta de rasgos para producción de cal identi.cados en el registro arqueológico. La identi.cación de estas estructuras como hornos para la producción de cal tiene implicaciones para comprender las diferencias subregionales en la organización socioeconómica y las prácticas de manejo de recursos entre los Mayas prehispánicos. Este trabajo proporciona un modelo para el uso de múltiples métodos y análisis para investigar e identi.car los hornos de producción de cal que se puede aplicar a las sociedades y paisajes a lo largo de la zona Maya y del mundo pre-moderno.

romas early as 1100 BC,burnt lime(cal in Spanish) has been one of the most important materials in the daily lives of the Maya. Nevertheless, considering the importance of lime for construction, hygienic, and dietary purposes,thereissurprisingly little information regarding lime production prior to the sixteenth century. This relative absence of information is largely due to the ephemeral nature of lime and the lack of lime production locations identi.ed in the archaeological record (Morris et al. 1931:220–225; Schreiner 2002:2– 5; Seligson et al. 2017b; Wernecke 2005:169, 2008:205). Aside from the identi.cation of a fewaboveground features (MacKinnonandMay 1990; Russell and Dahlin 2007), prehispanic lime production studies have centered on the identi.cation of permanent structures like

pit-kilns.Even when potentialpit-kilnsare iden­ti.ed,however,theevidencefor limeproduction often remains somewhat ambiguous (Abrams 1996;Abrams and Freter1996;Wernecke2008). The relative dearth of positive identi.cations re.ects not onlythe dif.culty of detectingthese locationsbutsuggeststhat archaeologistsmaybe overlooking potential lime production features. This article presents a comprehensive approach foridentifying annular structures documentedin and aroundthesiteofKiuicinthePuucregionof Yucatán as prehispanic limepit-kilns. Although this particular type of annular structure may be distinctive to the Puuc region, the methods described here provide a model for identifying limeproductionfeatures elsewhereinthe Maya area and Mesoamericamorebroadly. 
Burnt lime is produced by heating calcium carbonate(limestone or shellinthe Maya area) to at least 800°Cfor an extended period oftime. This chemically changes the stone to a caustic material called quicklime, or calcium oxide. The quicklimeisthen left to absorbwater naturally, or small quantities of water are added manually, which causes the quicklimetobreakdown into the .ne, white powder known as burnt lime, or calcium hydroxide. Burnt lime can then be mixed with aggregates and morewatertoform a cement-like slurry that dries and hardens once againinto calcium carbonate. 
TheKiuic annular structures arelow mounds capped by a single or double ring of boulders that surroundacentral depression(Figures1 and 2;Seligson2016;Seligson etal. 2017a, 2017b). Over 140 annular pit-kilns were identi.ed as partofa9km2 intersite surveybetween the Puuc sitesofLabná and Kiuicdirectedby thesecond and third authors (Figure3;Gallareta Negrón et al. 2014). Annular pit-kilns similar to those identi.edinand around Kiuichavethusfaronly been identi.ed at sites in the Puuc region of the northernlowlands,including Oxkintok(n = 13) (Ortíz Ruíz 2014), Sayil(n = 24) (Sabloff and Tourtellot 1991), Labna, Huntichmul (Gallareta Negrón et al. 2014), and along the Sierrita deTicul escarpment that delineates the northeastern edge of the Puuc region.Two pos­sibleexceptions aretwo double-ringed pit-kilns

identi.ed respectively by Fauvet-Berthelot (1980) at Cauinal, Guatemala, and Nancy Ettlinger(1983) at Pulltrouser Swamp, Belize (Figure4). Theseare most similartothevariety of annular structures identi.ed at Oxkintok. Futureresearch mayresultinthe identi.cation of more prehispanic annular pit-kilns elsewhere in the broader Maya region, but at this time, annular pit-kilns of this particular form and depth appear to be limited to the Puuc region. Thelarge quantity of limepit-kilnsidenti.ed in the Puuc also appearstobedistinct to theregion, whichmayhave re.ected the need forincreased lime production to supply expansive Terminal Classic period constructionprograms. 
Although the annular pit-kiln technology may have been largely limited to the Puuc region, lime production features have been identi.ed elsewhere in the Maya area, albeit infrequently (Seligson 2016; Seligson et al. 2017a). Archaeologistshave documented bowl-shaped pit-kilnswith rounded bottomsat Copan, Honduras (Viel 1983; Whittington 1991), and at DosPilas, Guatemala(Johnstonet al. 1989). Abramsand Freter(1996)documentedapartially enclosed pit-kiln at Copan that was unlike the Puuc annular pit-kilns(seealsoAbrams 1996). Additional identi.cations of potential lime pit-kilnsweremadeby Red.eld andVilla Rojas (1934) at Chan Kom, by Freidel and Sabloff (1984:35) on Cozumel, and by Barrera Rubio (2013)inthe northeastoftheYucatán Peninsula. A similar type of open-air .ring feature to the ones identi.ed by Russell and Dahlin (2007) wasdiscoveredbyMacKinnon and May(1990) at Placencia Caye in Belize, most likely to produce limefrommarineshells.Craig Hanson (2008:854) identi.ed four prehispanic pit-kilns atEk Balamthat mayhave been used for lime production. These were built into residential platformsinsteadofexcavateddirectly into the bedrock likethe Puuc pit-kilns. 
TurningtoMesoamericamorebroadly,poten­tial lime production features have been iden­ti.ed at Chalcatzingo in Morelos (Grove and Guillen 1987;Martín Arana 1987:392–393),in theTepeaca municipality of Puebla(Castanzo 2004;Castanzo and Anderson2004), and in the Tehuacan Valley (Sisson 1973:98–100). Lime has continued to be an important material for everyday life in the Maya area up through the historic period and into thepresent.Ethnographic and historical archaeological studies of lime productionsuggestthat open-airburns and Old World-style updraftkilnshave been thestandard production methods in the Maya area since the sixteenth century(Hanson 2008; Schreiner 2002). Considering the amount of lime that would have been used by the Maya from at least 1100BC onward(Hammond and Gerhardt 1990), the scarcity of documented prehispanic limeproductionfeaturesis striking.

Previous studies of annular structures at Oxkintok by Soledad Ortíz Ruíz (2014) and colleaguesandat Sayíl(Dunning 1991:25)have indicated that theylikelyfunctioned as pit-kilns forproducingburnt lime. The current investiga­tion combines multiple lines of investigation to test thehypothesis that the annular structures are infact limepit-kilns. Data aredrawn from1) the systematicexcavationofnine annular structures, 2) archaeometric analyses including inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) and stable oxygen and carbon isotope analyses, 3) the experimental construction and .ring of an annular structure, and 4) ethno­graphic research combined with the spatial and contextual analyses of 53 annular structures.

TheKiuic Annular StructureCaseStudy 
Archaeological Setting 
The Puuc region is characterized by a dis­tinctivehilly topography and an archaeological subculture with a high frequency of masonry architecture(Figure5;Gallareta Negrón et al. 2014). The Puuc is bordered to the northeast by the Sierrita de Ticul escarpment that runs southeast from Oxkintok. To the west of the Sierritainthe northern zoneofthePuucliesthe triangular,relatively .at stretch of theValle de SantaElena.Largearchaeological sitesincluding Uxmal, Nohpat, Kabah, and Yaxhom that are locatedinthevalleymostlikely controlled access to the distinctively deep and fertile soils that wouldhavedrawn ancient settlers to theregion (Barrera Rubio 1987;Simms et al.2012).To the south and southeastoftheVallede SantaElena is theBolonchén District whereKiuic and other ancient sitessuch as Labna and Sayilare located. 
Themid-level,Range III(GarzaTarazonade Gonzalez and Kurjack 1980) site of Kiuic is located within a circular valley surrounded by a ringoflowhills,many ofwhich possess archae­ological complexesontheir apices (Simmsetal. 2012).

As partofthelarger BRAPprogram,Gallareta Negrón and colleagues (2014) conducted an intensive9-pluskm2 ground surveybetween the sitesofLabna and Kiuic between 2001 and 2014. During the survey, they identi.ed all human-made and -modi.ed features in the surveyarea, including more than 140 annular structures.This study focuses on the partofthe survey area that would have likely fallen within the bounds of the Terminal Classic period Kiuic polity (ca. AD 700–950)and includesatotalof53 annular structures(Figure7).

Methods 
Several quantitative and qualitative research methods were used to determine thefunction(s) of theKiuic annular structures.Theseincluded 1) a systematic excavationprogram;2) archaeo­metric analyses; 3) experimental archaeology; 4) the incorporation of ethnographic data; and 5) spatial and contextual analyses. The study area was divided into inner, intermediate, and outer zones based on distance from the site core, topography, and frequency of residential architecture. A random sample of nine annular structureswaschosenforexcavationfromwithin each of these zones with the breakdown based on the proportional total amount of annular structures locatedin each zone. Theseninestruc­tures included those located within residential compounds, outside compounds, and othersthat were fairly isolated from other archaeological features (Seligson 2016). 
Several categoriesofmaterialwererecovered from the excavations, including partially burnt pieces of limestone, sascab (a soft type of marl, or unconsolidated limestone, that occurs natu­rally in pockets below the harder caprock lime­stone),reconstituted calcium carbonate, ceramic sherds,soil, and charcoal.Thesematerials pro­videdevidence forburning episodes within the structures as well as the types of materials that were burnt. The systematic excavation of the annular structures also allowedforabetter under­standing of their original forms and provided insightsintotheir constructionhistories. 
The second part of the testing program included stable carbon and oxygen isotope anal­yses, ICP-OES, and radiocarbon dating. The carbon and oxygen isotope tests determined whether the samples of sascab recovered from within the annular structures represented natu­rally occurring sascab or reconstituted calcium carbonate. Carbon isotope analyses measured the ratio of 13Cto 12C isotopes (or d13C) in the sascab/plaster samples. The d13C level of naturally occurring limestone is generally close to0 while the d13Clevelof limeplastersissig­ni.cantly lower(Létolle et al. 1992;Murakami et al. 2013). This is due to thefact that natural limestonewasformed under ancient oceans and absorbed CO2 isotopes from water. Reconsti­tuted calcium carbonate has gone through a

processinwhichit losesits originalCO2isotopes and absorbsnewCO2isotopesfromtheairand/or rainwater(Létolle et al. 1992). Depending on the degree of decalcination or decarboxylation of the original limestone, lime plasters may have a d13C level as low as –21. A similar phenomenon is observed in the ratio between 16Oand18O(or d18O),wherelowerlevels re.ect greater amounts of decarboxylation and then recarbonation of the materials (Létolle et al. 1992; Murakami et al. 2013). Thus, if it was found that the limestone and sascab samples had low d13Candd18Olevels, itwouldindicatethat the materials had been reconstituted as calcium carbonate. 
ICP-OES analyses were used to analyze lime­stone, sascab, and soil samples to detect the presenceofwood ashinthe kilns and determine whether the sascab/plaster samples had high or lowlevelsof magnesium, whichwouldprovide anotherway ofdistinguishing between the nat­ural and the reconstituted material. Naturally occurring sascab has been demonstrated to have higher levels of magnesium than the overlying bedrock layers from which burnt lime is pro­duced due to downward percolation of magne­sium atomswith rainwater(Villaseñor 2010:25). Charcoal and/or botanical samples recovered from within the annular structures were used to identifythe generaoftreesusedasfuel withinthe kilns,aswellastodatetheuseofthe structures through radiocarbon dating. 
Athird test of thefunction(s) of the annular structureswastheexperimental construction and .ring of an annular pit-kiln modeled on the prehispanicstructures.The purposeofthisexper­iment was to test the practicality of a partially enclosed pit-kiln forproducingburnt lime. The physicalevidence resulting fromtheexperiment was compared with the physical evidence dis­covered in and around the prehispanic annular structures. 
The .nal methods to determine thefunction(s) of the annular structures combined spatial and contextual analyses with ethnographic data con­cerningtheusesofdifferent gradesof limestone. Interviews with local informantsprovided infor­mation regarding different grades of limestone and knowledge of those types most conducive to lime production. Correlations between the locations of annular structures and sakel bach tunich—the type of limestone most suitablefor makingburnt lime—provided an additional line of evidence supporting the functions of these structures as limepit-kilns. 
Results 
Carbon and Oxygen Isotope and ICP-OES Analyses 
Annular Structure 1. Sascab/plaster levels were encountered in eight of the nine annular structures, and samples were recovered from seven of the structures. A sample recovered from the interior .oor of Annular Structure 1 (Sample 1) possessed isotopic levels of – 22.08, –22.49 d13C and –15.06, –14.07 d18O), whichare consistentwithlevelsforreconstituted calcium carbonate(Table1). ICP-OES analy­ses showed that Sample 1 possessed higher levels of phosphorous (1.18 ppm) compared with Samples 2 and 3, which were recovered from nearby sascab quarries (0.10 and 0.04, respectively; Table2). Thesubterranean sascab layer from the nearby quarry extended all the way through the central depression of Annular Structure 1. Thus, the quarry samples provide a baseline for the amount of phosphorous that occurs naturally in the limestone around the structure.Thehigherlevelofphosphorousinthe reconstituted calcium carbonatesamplefromthe structurere.ectsthe mixingofwood ashwith the sample. 
Annular Structure 2. Samples 4, 5, and 6 were recovered fromdifferent depths within the central depression of Annular Structure 2. The isotopic data indicate that Sample 4 (–24.42, -26.54 d13C and –19.50, –16.20 d18O) repre­sentsreconstituted lime, while Sample5(–10.45, -10.27 d13Cand –4.46, –4.35d18O)and Sample 6(–9.70, –9.84d13Cand –4.47, –4.42d18O) are most likely naturally occurring sascab.

that the approximately 50 cm thick layer of material between the pointsfromwhere Sample 4 and Sample 5 were recovered is made up of reconstituted calcium carbonate. 
The ICP-OES analyses show that Sample 4 (0.51 ppm) has a higher level of phospho­rous than Sample 5 (0.13 ppm) and Sample 6 
(0.06 ppm). The higher level of phosphorous re.ects the mixing of wood ash with Sample 
4. Another discrepancy between the uppermost sample and the two lower samples is the level of magnesium: Sample 4 (1.30 ppm), Sample 5(4.01 ppm), and Sample 6 (4.87 ppm). This supportstheinterpretationthatthelower layeris sascab and the upper layer material is not. Sas­cab has been showntohavehigher magnesium levels than overlying limestone (or in this case burnt lime) due to the migration of magnesium atoms downward with rainwater (Villaseñor 2010:25).

Sample7(–10.14, –10.01 d13Cand –4.59, –4.83 d18O) and Sample14(–10.83, –9.74 d13C and –3.09, –3.75 d18O) represent naturally occurring sascab. Samples 7 and 14 were much more similarto each other than eitherwasto Sample8 in terms of elemental composition as well. The ICP-OES analysis showed that Sample 8 (0.16 ppm) exhibited slightly higher levels of phos­phorus than Sample 7 (0.06 ppm) and Sample 14 (0.07 ppm). Also,differences in magnesium levels supportthe interpretationthat Sample8is reconstituted calcium carbonate while Samples 7and 14 are naturally occurringsascab. 
Annular Structure 4. Samples9and10 were recoveredfromAnnular Structure4.The isotopic dataindicatethat Sample9(–26.61, -25.60 d13C and –20.33, –22.21 d18O) represents reconsti­tuted lime while Sample 10 (–10.90, -10.30 d13Cand –4.37, –3.08d18O) represents naturally occurring sascab. This is consistent with the pattern identi.ed in the other annular structures, wherealayerof reconstituted calcium carbonate overlaysalayerof natural sascab at the base of theinterior depressionsof thestructures. 
Annular Structure 5. Sample 11 was recov­ered from the base of the interior of Annular Structure 5. The isotopic data indicate that the material recoveredisreconstituted calcium car­bonate(–23.34, –24.91 d13Cand –20.23,-22.10 d18O).Thisissomewhat peculiarinthat Annular Structure5is the only one witha central depres­sionthatdoesnot enter.Thissuggeststhatthekiln mayhavebeenusedforonlyalimited numberof burning episodes or atop an especially hard patch of surface bedrock. 
Annular Structures 6 and 7. Samples 12 and 13 were collected fromAnnular Structures6and 7, respectively. Theisotopic datafor Sample12 indicatethat thematerialwas naturally occurring sascab (–8.28, –10.02 d13C and –3.90, –3.92 d18O).Theisotopic data from Sample13likewise indicatethatthematerial encounteredwasindeed natural sascab (–10.40/–10.64 d13Cand –3.99/– 
4.49 d18O). Both samples have relatively high levels of magnesium (Sample 12: 4.20 ppm; Sample 13: 3.20 ppm), which further suggests that theyrepresent sascab insteadofburnt lime. 
Radiocarbon Data and Charcoal Species Identi.cation 
At least one charcoal samplewasrecovered from sixofthe nine annular structures, and sevenwere selected to be sent forAMS radiocarbon dating at the University of Arizona AMS laboratory. Two of the samples returned erroneous dates from the nineteenth century and one could not be dated, but the four charcoal samples that returned prehispanic dates were .rmly dated to theLate andTerminal Classic periods(Table3). Theseinclude samplesfromAnnular Structure1 (1222 ± 20BP, 675–775calADat2s ), Annular Structure4(1276 ± 19 BP, 658–765 cal AD at 2s ), Annular Structure6 (1167 ± 26 BP, 766– 892 cal AD at2s ), and Annular Structure 8 (1188 ± 35BP, 688–887calADat2s ;Seligson et al. 2017a:14–16). The measurements were background subtracted and isotope fractionation corrected. The calibrations were calculated using IntCal13 and OxCal4.2.4 software. 
In additiontousing therecovered charcoal for datingthe construction and useofthe structures, some of thepieces were well enough preserved to allowfor theirtaxonomic identi.cation. The identi.ablepiecesof charcoal included dicotyle­donous angiosperms (or hardwood species).Two tentative species identi.cations were made for Piscidia piscipula (or ja’abin inYucatec Maya) and a Lonchocarpus species like the balche tree, whichwere bothusedintheexperimental burning. 
Spatial Analyses 
Of the 53 annular structures in the study area, sevenare locatedin theKiuic inner zone (13%), 35 are located in the hilly intermediate zone (66%),and11arelocatedinthe outer zone(21%) beyond theringofhills.Acrossallof the zones, the most consistent contextual correlations for the annular structures are that they are located near outcrops of SBT limestone (the type most desirablefor making lime), and theyaresituated on elevated or sloping terrain.

The burnt and partially burnt chich resembledsimilarpiecesof chich identi.ed in and around the majority of the archaeological annular structures (Seligson et al. 2017a). 
Ethnographic Data and Spatial Analyses 
Limestoneisbyfarthe most ubiquitous typeof stone in Yucatán. Although it is impossible to project modernknowledgeoflimestonevariation directly back to the prehispanic inhabitants of the Puuc,exploringthe folk names and usefor different types of limestone provide the closest available analogue. Ethnohistoric and modern ethnographic accounts reference at least four recognizable types of limestone. The preferred type formaking limeisa slightly porous though not too soft type with a yellowish hue referred to as sakel bach tunich (white bird’s egg stone [translation by authors]). Stone workers in the townof Dzityálocated northwestof Mérida call itbythisterm(PerazaLópez 1993),asdo potters inthetownofTiculontheedgeofthe Puucregion (Arnold 2008:285) and ourown collaboratorsin the PuuctownsofYaxhachenandKobenhaltun. In theYaxcabáejido of centralYucatán, this same type is called hel bach (LevyTacher and Hernán­dez Xolocotzi 1995:264), and in other areas it is referred to as sak ebach or ebach (Schreiner 2001:358). 
There are three other general types of lime­stone recognized in Yucatán that are not as desirable for lime production. These include the softer limestone marl referred to variously as sak tunich, sascab tunich, and sah kab tunich, which generally means “white stone” or “white earth stone” (translations by authors). A harder, less porous grade of limestone with a grayish hue is referred to as sak tok’, toc tunich, tok’ tunich,or taman tunich, meaning roughly “hard stone” (translation by authors). The .nal type, distinguished by its reddish or pinkish hue, is referred to by variations of the label chak tunich or “red stone” (translation by authors; Levy Tacher and Hernández Xolo­cotzi 1995:264; Peraza López 1993; Schreiner 2001:358). The Spanish-Yucatec Mayan Dic­cionario Maya Cordemex compiled from both ethnographic and ethnohistoric accounts dating back to the sixteenth century AD refers to limestone generally as sahkab and includes a reference to sahkab as “tierra con que sefabricala cal”(BarreraVásquez 1980:708) or “earth from whichburnt limeismanufactured” (translation by authors).Another entry does specify that tok’ tunich is “piedra dura, fuerteopedernal”(Barrera Vásquez1980:805),or “rockthatishard, strong, or chert” (translationbyauthors). Thedictionary does not include references to any variation of sakel bach tunich or chak tunich.The absence of these terms re.ects the fact that the dictionary does not focus on limestone processing or lime production. 
Ourlocal collaborators, DonGabrielUs and DonEvelio Uc,who both had previousexperi­ence with limeproduction, describe and identify thefour general aforementioned types of lime­stone: 
• 
sakel bach tunich: This type of limestone is particularly white in appearance and of a medium-hard composition, and it is the best type formaking limepowder. 
• 
tok’ tunich:This general type of limestone is grayer in appearance, harder in composition, andis not suitablefor making limepowder. 
• 
chak tunich:Thistypeof limestone hasahigh iron content that gives it a reddish hue. It is generally unsuitablefor making limepowder and,ifused, resultsinalimepowderthathas apinkish hue. 
• 
sah kab tunich:Thisisthe softer,white lime­stone also known as sascab that is unsuitable formaking limepowder. 
Theidenti.cations demonstratethefamiliar­ity of the collaborators with the nuances of lime production. These different types occur unevenlythroughout thelandscape, oftenblend­ingtogether to form the bedrock matrix.There are,however,outcropsof limestone that are dom­inatedby one type or another.A.nal approach for determining the function of the annular pit-kilnsdrewonthe limestone identi.cation expertise of the collaborators.

Discussion: TheEvidenceforAnnular Structures Functioning as Burnt-Lime Kilns 
Physical Evidence 
Evidence for Burning. The boulders that formed the interior surface rings of the nine excavated annular structures and an additional 20 of the surveyed structures exhibited a black­ened appearance from exposure to .re. With the exception of Annular Structure 5, the cen­tral depressions of all of the excavated annular structures crossed through the surface layer of bedrock. The bedrock portions of the interior walls of all of these structures (as well as the surface bedrock .oor of Annular Structure 5) exhibitedthe blackened coloring and friabletex­tureof bedrockthathadbeen repeatedlyexposed to .ring episodes (Seligson et al. 2017a). The discoveryof charcoalorwoodashandburntsoil in the lowest layers of eight of the structures provides another direct line of evidence for burning episodes.Multipleburntlayersseparated by thin layersofreconstituted calcium carbonate near the bottoms of seven of the structures represented the remains of multiple successive burning episodes. 
The depth of the majority of the annular structures also indicates their repeated use for .ring events. The pit-kiln experiment demon­strated that the 20-plus-hour burn loosened 10 to 15 cm of bedrock from the .oor of the pit. This limestone, which was the same sakel bach tunich that dominated the outcrop into which theexperimental kilnwasbuilt,wasthen easily removed and could be used for a subsequent burn.Ifthis patternwascontinued repeatedly,the depthofthisexperimental kilnwouldeventually reach levels comparable to the archaeological structures. 
Burnt Chich. Thehigh concentrationofburnt or partially burnt chich around the annular structures suggests that the prehispanic Maya used them to burn limestone. The majority of the pieces of chich that are scattered around the structures belong to the sakel bach variety. 
In some cases, the partially burnt pieces of chich appear to have been randomly scattered aftertheydid not completely calcine duringthe burningprocess.In other cases,the prehispanic Maya used the partiallyburntpieces of chich as insulation or retention material to shore up the exteriorwallsofthestructure. Examplessuchas Annular Structure2,8, and9 possess an outer, sloping ring composed almost entirely of chich. Many of thepieces of chich that do not exhibit evidence of burning belong to the category of limestone known as tok’ tunich. This indicates that stones collected for potential .ring were carefully selected prior to the lime production process due to the recognition of their appro­priatenessfor producing lime. Additionally,the partiallyburntpieces of chich aresimilartothose pieces that did not completely calcine during the experimental burns and were subsequently discarded. 
Reconstituted Calcium Carbonate. Another lineof evidence suggestingthat theprehispanic Maya used the annular structures as lime pit-kilns is the identi.cation of layers of reconsti­tuted calcium carbonatein.veoftheexcavated structures.Oxygen and carbon isotope analyses indicated that the materials recovered from the pits absorbedwater and carbon dioxide from the surrounding environment when passing through the limeproductioncycle. Thereconstituted cal­cium carbonate recovered from the bases of the kilnsrepresentsthe remainsof limeproduction episodes (Seligson et al. 2017a). The results of the experimental project provided analogous materialstothose encounteredintheprehispanic kilns. Afterproducing the limepowder through intensive, high-temperatureburning, theresult­ing quicklime was left in the central depression of thestructuretohydrateinto limepowder.The burntlimepowderwasthen removedfromthepit. Itwasimpossibletoremove allofit, andathin layer remained. Over time, this layer hydrates further and then dry into a layer of pure lime stucco similartothosediscovered near thelower levelsof theprehispanicstructures.Thefact that multiple layers ofpure lime stucco were identi­.edinseveralpits,insome casesoverlayingand underlyingburnt layersofsoil, rock, or charcoal,

suggeststheremainsof multiplelimeproduction episodes. 
Tree Species Used as Fuel. An additional lineof evidence suggestingthat theprehispanic Maya used annular structures for limeproduction is the type of wood charcoal recovered in the pit-kilns. Charcoal samples were identi.ed as hardwood species, speci.cally those belonging to the Piscidia and Lonchocarpus genera, which include the ja’abin and balche tree species that are commonly used for slow burns today and were used in the experimental pit-kiln burns. These slow-burning woods would have been a preferred type for long-duration .res such as those necessaryto produce lime(Seligsonet al. 2017a). 
Spatial and Contextual Results 
Thepit-kilnexperiments demonstrated that lime productionrequiressubstantialamountsoflabor for the collection and preparation of raw mate­rials. The postproduction transportation of the heavyburnt limewouldhavealsorequiredmuch labor.The correlationsof structures with1) the location of sakel bach tunich (SBT) outcrops; 2) sloping and/or elevated terrain; and 3) high population density indicatetheirfunctionaslime productionpit-kilns. Mainly,thesefactorsre.ect the prehispanic lime producers endeavoring to limit thelaboreffortsinvolvedinthe production and distributionprocess. 
The fact that 8 of 11 (73%) of the outer zone annular structures arelocated on elevated or sloping terrain re.ectsthree probablefactors: 1) the desire to be close to the outcrops and hillslopes from where the raw wood and stone materialswere harvested;2) the desiretouse the natural slopein the constructionofthe kiln; and 3) the desiretoleave as much .at arableland as possible for agricultural production. A correla­tion between annular structures and sloping or elevatedterrainis also seenin theintermediate and inner zones.Thirtyof35(86%)intermediate zone annular structures are located either on a hill or immediatelyatthe baseofa hill. Thehigh correlationinthe intermediate zoneis partially due to thegreater prevalence of sloping terrain. Thesmallsamplesizeoftheinner zone(n = 7) limitsits signi.cancetothis discussion,but6of7 (86%)are located on sloping or elevatedterrain. 
Themajority (66%)ofthe annular structures identi.ed in the study area are located within theintermediate zone, whichalso has thehighest concentration(26.5perkm2,comparedwith18.4 per km2 in the inner zone, 9.7 per km2 in the outer zone, and 18.7 per km2 overall). This re.ects a desire on the part of lime producers to be close to both the source of the wood fuel and theresidentialgroups that neededburnt lime. The hillslopes of the intermediate zone wouldhave likely been among themore densely forested areasoftheKiuicpolityduringtheLate andTerminal Classic periods.The intermediate zone best .ts the balance between limiting the transportation of raw materials and of .nished product. 
Alternative Possibilities 
Although there are several convincing lines of evidence that point to the annular structures being used to produce lime, this does not preclude their possible use for multiple purposes. In fact, the amountof labor and resources requiredfor their construction suggests that they served multiple functions, especially if lime production was a seasonal activity. 
Despitethefactthatno ceramicwasterswere found in the vicinity of any of the structures, this does not mean that the annular kilns could nothave been usedto .re ceramicvessels.Dean Arnold(personal communication 2015) found that pottersinthetownofTicul removedwasters fromthe sidesof abandoned kilns possiblytobe used forkiln furniture or spacers. Though it is a stretch to directly link this modern analogue to prehispanic practices in the region, it does provideapossibleexplanation.Itis unlikelythat the kilns, at least at their .nal depths, would have been used to cook food, which requires shallowerpits (Salazaretal. 2012).After.nding ash and lime within the central depression of an annular structureatSayil, Dunning(1991:25) suggested that structures might have been used to produce fertilizer.Burning trashmaterials or making charcoal aretwoother possiblefunctions of these structures. 
Although there is substantial evidence for burning, it is possible that in between .ring

episodes, the annular structures were used for storage purposes. Ethnographic research in the Puuc (Smyth 1990)has demonstrated theimpor­tance of limefor storing and preserving maize. The limedries out the corncobs and detersinsects and rodents. Maize is then processed through nixtamalization, which washes away the excess lime. Flotation of soil samples from the lowest levels of the annular structures did not return any evidence for maize in the structures, however, and contemporarystorage structures arelocated aboveground. 


Conclusion 
Thisinvestigationusedmultiple linesofevidence to identify the annular structures in and around Kiuicasprehispanic limepit-kilns. Thesystem­aticexcavationofnine annular structures uncov­ered evidence for multiple burning episodes within each structure in the form of blackened and friablewalls.Isotopic analysesof materials recovered from within the structures showed them to be reconstituted calcium carbonate. This indicates that temperatures inside the pit-kilns would have had to reach at least 800°C for at least 20 hours to chemically alter small pieces of limestone. Additional evidence for burning episodes was uncovered in the forms of wood ash and charcoal pieces.A surveyof 53 annular structures in the study area found the majority of the structures were surrounded by a scatter of burntpieces ofchich,which were similartothe detritusproduced during limeproductionexper­iments. Theexperimentsalsoproducedburning signatures on the interior of the experimental pit-kiln that mirrored the marks identi.ed in the prehispanic annular structures. Spatial analyses demonstrated that the annular structures were located near outcrops of sakel bach tunich,the type of limestone known to be the bestfor pro­ducing lime. The concentration of the majority of annular structures in the suburban zone of the study area re.ects a desire by prehispanic lime producers to limit the transportation costs involvedin limeproduction. Thesuburban zone is nearesttothe rawmaterials necessary for lime production as well as the highest concentration of residentialgroups that consumed it. 
All of these lines of evidence point to the annular structures being used as pit-kilns for producing lime. The datingofthe annular struc­tures to the Late and Terminal Classic periods suggests that pit-kiln technology was used at a time when Kiuic and the rest of the Puuc region experienced demographic and construc­tion booms(Gallareta Negrón et al. 2014).These strained local wood fuel resources and encour­agedthedevelopmentof more fuel-ef.cientlime production technology. The experimental lime production episodes demonstrated that annular pit-kilnsincreased theef.ciencyin comparison to aboveground woodenpyres (Seligson et al. 2017a). The development of this annular pit-kiln technology,which appearstobe unique to the Puuc, thus has interesting implications for the study of subregional responses to social and environmental pressures, as well as prehispanic Maya resource conservationprograms(Seligson 2016). This report provides a model for using multiple methods and analyses to investigate and identify lime production features that can be applied to study the material record and land­scapes throughout the Maya area and broader Mesoamerica.
