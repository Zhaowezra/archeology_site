SPECIALIZED PRODUCTION OF SAN MARTIN ORANGE WARE 
AT TEOTIHUACAN, MEXICO 

Kristin S. Sullivan 
Specialized production forms an important component of the socioeconomic organization of ancient complex societies. Exca­vation provides critical information on the internal organization of production within a particular workshop and permits the recovery of features not preserved on the surface. In large settlements like Teotihuacan where modern occupation cov­ers much of the ancient city, it is not feasible to fully excavate every suspected craft production locale. At Teotihuacan and in other complex societies, the use of surface indications to generate thematic maps permits discussion of the spatial rela­tionships between economic and social units within the settlement. I use the surface collections made by the Teotihuacan Mapping Project and the partial excavation of one apartment compound and ceramic workshop in the Tlajinga district to consider the organization of specialized production in this neighborhood. I rely on the co-occurrence of ceramic produc­tion indicators to define likely workshops, using the surface collections from the excavated workshop as a reasonable indi­cator of production. Considering the evidence for vessel form specialization and dimensional standardization and previous ethnoarchaeological analyses of the excavated materials, Tlajinga district pottery production appears to have been maxi­mally organized at the community level, with individual apartment compounds forming the basic production units. 
La producci6n especializada es un componente importante de la organizaci6n de las sociedades complejas. La excavaci6n proporciona importante informaci6n sabre la organizaci6n interna de la producci6n artesanal y permite recuperar elementos culturales raramente preservados en superficie. En ciudades tan grandes y complejas coma Teotihuacan, donde la construc­ci6n moderna cubre la ciudad antigua, no es posible excavar cada Lugar que sugiera una producci6n ceramica. En Teotihua­can coma en otras sociedades complejas, el uso de colecciones de superficie para crear mapas tematicos permite la discusi6n de relaciones entre unidades productivas. Utilizo las colecciones de! Teotihuacan Mapping Project y la excavaci6n parcial de un conjunto y taller alfarero de! distrito de Tlajinga para considerar la organizaci6n de su producci6n especializada. Me baso en que un probable taller incluye par lo menos dos indicadores razonables de producci6n. A partir de la evidencia que dis­cuto acerca de la especializaci6n de las formas y la estandarizaci6n de las tamafios de vasijas, asf coma en la de Los restos excavados en investigaciones etnoarqueol6gicas anteriores, la alfarerfa de Tlajinga parece haber sido extremadamente orga­nizada al nivel comunitario, en la que Los conjuntos residenciales individuates formaban las unidades bdsicas de producci6n.

rchaeologists have linked the emergence of craft specialization to the development of political complexity, and in state-level societies many of the goods in circulation are pro­duced by specialists. Studies of craft specialization have focused on identifying production areas (Arnold 1990; Deal 1988; Pool 1992; Stark 1984, 1985)and assessing the organization of production (Arnold 199lb; Arnold 1993; Costin 1991, 2001; Feinman 1985; Reina and Hill 1978; Rice 1981, 1996; Sinopoli 1991). Other researchers have focused on evaluating the degree of specialization (Blackman et al. 1993; Charlton et al. 1991; Curet 1993) and investigating the interaction among pro­duction, distribution, and exchange (Brumfiel and Earle 1987; Charlton 1994; Charlton et al. 2000; Graves 1991; Hodge and Mine 1990; Pool 1992), as well as that between production and the politi­cal economy (Arnold et al. 1993; Hirth 1996; Nichols et al. 2002; Pool and Santley 1992; Stark 1992). In Mesoamerica, researchers have investi­gated broad temporal and spatial changes in the organization of ceramic production and exchange using intensive surface collections (Feinman 1985; Kowalewski et al. 1989; Santley and Arnold 1996; Santley et al. 1989; Stark 1992; Stark and Garraty 2004). Excavation provides the opportunity to con­firm activities inferred from surface indications and permits detailed discussion of specialized struc­tures, features, or other indications of production

The production of San Martin Orange (SMO) ware pottery in the Tlajinga district ofTeotihuacan provides a unique opportunity to consider the orga­nization of production within a neighborhood of the ancient city utilizing surface collections as well as information from the partial excavation of one apartment compound and SMO workshop (Fig­ures 1-2). Collections from the full-coverage sur­vey of Teotihuacan conducted by the Teotihuacan Mapping Project (TMP) permit consideration of the organization of some of the most specialized pot­tery produced locally in one neighborhood of the ancient city (Millon 1973; Millon et al. 1973 ). The partial excavation of the apartment compound and SMO workshop at Tlajinga 33, or 33:S3Wl, also contributes to this discussion of the organization of SMO production in the Tlajinga district (Hopkins 1995; Krotser 1987; Krotser and Rattray 1980; Sanders et al. 1982; Sheehy 1992, 1998; Widmer 1987, 1991; Widmer and Storey 1993). This exam­ple is of particular interest because Teotihuacan was a major economic center producing an array of goods that circulated throughout the city and beyond during the Early Classic period (Cowgill l 992a, l 992b, 1997; Millon 1973, 1981 ). Evidence for the production of different craft goods has been found in several of the city's more than 2,000 apart­ment compounds, and previous archaeological studies have demonstrated the utility of thematic maps based on surface collections in examining social and spatial relations at Teotihuacan (Altschul 1981, 1987; Robertson 1999, 2001). 
In this article I present the results of a system­atic analysis of the surface materials for evidence of specialized SMO production in the Tlajinga dis­trict. I utilize the ceramics collected by the TMP to detect likely areas of specialized ceramic produc­tion (Millon 1973; Millon et al. 1973). Artifacts col­lected from the surface of the excavated SMO workshop at Tlajinga 33 serve as a baseline against which surface collections from otherTlajinga apart­ment compounds are compared. I focus on the sur­face collections in order to consider the spatial relationship between likely SMO workshops in the

Models of Specialized Production 

These excavated materials could be compared with the existing excavated collections from Tlajinga 33 Researchers have presented several models for the for a more detailed understanding of the variabil­organization of specialized production (Charlton et ity inherent in the organization of Tlajinga SMO al. 2000; Earle 1981; Peacock 1982; Santley et al. production and of how the organization of pro-1989; Sinopoli 1988). I rely on Costin's (1991: 

https://www.cambridge.org/core/terms. https://doi.org/10.1017/S1045663500014097 
Table 1.1, 2001:275-278) typology for the organi­zation of production because it takes into consid­eration social, economic, and political factors influencing the organization of production. The results of my study do not fall neatly into a single category; rather, they reflect variability in the orga­nization of production. 
One aim of my study is to define areas where SMO pottery was likely produced and to discuss the organization of that production within the Tlajinga district. Four of the productive configurations dis­cussed by Costin (1991)--dispersed corvee, indi­vidual retainer, nucleated corvee, and retainer workshop--are not considered here because they are associated with attached contexts of production, whereas the Tlajinga district potters were located far from the civic-ceremonial core of the city and were not attached to elite or governmental sponsors. 
Two other productive units addressed by Costin (1991)-individual and dispersed workshops­involve production locales dispersed throughout a settlement and thus do not reflect the concentration of potters in the Tlajinga neighborhood. Because community specialization and nucleated workshops are most pertinent to the present investigation, these are the two organizational configurations discussed in detail here. Community specialization involves "autonomous individual or household-based pro­duction units, aggregated within a single commu­nity, producing for unrestricted regional consumption" (Costin and Hagstrum 1995:621). I refer to units practicing this form of specialized pro­duction as "aggregated small autonomous produc­tion" units because they represent independent household producers clustered in close proximity to one another. Nucleated workshops are "larger workshops aggregated within a single community, producing for unrestricted regional consumption" and are expected to produce more specialized goods (Costin and Hagstrum 1995:621). 
The other goal of the present study is to assess 

the level of specialization of the Tlajinga SMO pot­
ters based on the standardization hypothesis 
(Arnold and Santley 1993; Blackman et al. 1993; 
Sinopoli 1988; Stark 1995). According to this 
model, more specialized producers are expected to 
make more specialized and/or standardized prod­
ucts as the result of repetitive behavior, increased 
skill, and the need or desire to increase production 
efficiency to meet consumer demand. 
In community specialization, where the maxi­mal production unit would be the lineage or com­pound, as is argued for Tlajinga 33 (Sheehy 1992; Widmer and Storey 1993), the ceramic assemblage should exhibit low investment in labor and moder­ate skill (Costin and Hagstrum 1995:629). I would expect little or no evidence for vessel form spe­cialization or dimensional standardization by indi­vidual production loci, with each potting household independent of others in the Tlajinga district. Alter­natively, in labor-based nucleated workshops­where skill and availability rather than kinship determine recruitment by the production unit­potters may maximize production output with one workshop, or a group of clustered workshops, spe­cializing in a particular vessel form, size, or both and/or sharing productive facilities such as firing areas (Santley et al. 1989: 119). In this case, I would expect specialists in certain vessel forms or sizes to be clustered together, reflecting organization at a level beyond that of the lineage or compound, including the sharing of tools and the scheduling of firings and other tasks. I also expect SM 0 assem­blages from nucleated workshops to be signifi­cantly more standardized than assemblages from nonworkshop contexts, following the standardiza­tion hypothesis. 
The Standardization Hypothesis 



The standardization hypothesis maintains that spe­cialists' products will be more standardized-in dimensional, compositional, stylistic, or formal attributes-than those of relatively less specialized household potters. Many studies have relied, at least in part, on the standardization hypothesis to examine specialization in archaeological assem­blages where evidence such as raw materials, wasters, specialized facilities, tools, and reliably identified production locations is lacking (Barnes 1987; Blackman et al. 1993; Feinman et al. 1984; Hagstrom 1985, 1986, 1988; Rice 1981, 1989, 1991; Sinopoli 1988). Many researchers, however, have noted deviations from the expectation that specialists produce more standardized goods than nonspecialists (Arnold 1990; Arnold and Santley 1993; Longacre et al. 1988; Stark 1995). 
Stark (1995:232) discusses additional factors affecting standardization, including the use of stacking adjustments in firing and transporting ves-

sels and consumer acceptance of variability. In the Tuxtla Mountains of Veracruz, ethnographic stud­ies indicate that repetitive actions and the use of molds and measuring techniques (e.g., pieces of wood, finger and hand spans) by relatively unspe­cialized household potters may also contribute to the relative standardization of their goods (Arnold 199 la; Arnold and Santley 1993 ). Increased motor skill and experience in pottery making, the ratio of the number of producers to consumers or total prod­ucts, the effects of market controls, and the choice of fabrication technique all influence the variabil­ity of vessel dimensions (Arnold and Nieves 1992: 112; Stark 1995:232). 
Other factors influencing the apparent stan­dardization of particular assemblages include "the choice of variables, the nature of assemblages to be compared, technology, and methods of analy­sis" (Stark 1995 :234 ). The time depth of prehistoric remains also poses a problem for comparing archaeological phases with ethnographic examples where the number of producers and the years of production are known variables (Arnold 1991a; Stark 1995; Sullivan 2002:Table 5). Costin and Hagstrom also note that the "vagaries of quantify­ing skill lead us to suggest that ceramic techno­logical attributes related to skill and control, to standardization, and to labor investment be con­sidered together since they combine in distinctive ways, discriminating different kinds of specializa­tion" (1995:623). 
Archaeological Background 
Beginning in the 1960s, the TMP created topo­graphic and archaeological maps and made surface collections of nearly 5,000 survey units (Millon 1973, 1981, 1993;Millon et al. 1973:3-18). These collection tracts include multifamily apartment compounds (some of which were also craft work­shops), temples, and other structures, as well as nonstructural areas such as plazas. Collection tracts were assigned alphanumeric site numbers in the order they were surveyed within one of the arbi­trary500 x 500-m map squares (e.g., 33:S3W l was the 33rd tract surveyed in square S3Wl). All fea­ture artifacts, including diagnostic rim sherds, were collected from the collection tracts (Millon 1973 ). The TMP collections have been used to exam­
ine the distribution of SMO throughout the city (Cowgill 1987; Hopkins 1995; Krotser and Rattray 1980; Robertson 1999). Previous studies of ceramic production using the TMP survey collections have identified probable ceramic workshops and discuss product uniformity and specialization in a number of ceramic wares and at apartment compounds located throughout the city (Hopkins 1995; Krotser 1987; Krotser and Rattray 1980; Rattray 1988). The spatial patterning of artifactual and architec­tural remains argues for at least some degree of spa­tial clustering of social groups and economic activities at Teotihuacan (Altschul 1981, 1987; Mil­lon 1973; Robertson 2001; Sload 1982; Spence 1981 ). In Tlajinga, the clustering of probable ceramic workshops within the district suggests some social relationship among occupants of the apartment compounds (Altschul 1981, 1987; Sheehy 1992:778). 
The Tlajinga district is of particular interest because the area has evidence for some of the most specialized ceramic production at Teotihuacan (Figure 3). Large quantities of the popular Xolal­pan (A.D. 350-550) and Metepec (A.D. 550-650) phase SMO ware were used for cooking (craters) and serving (basins) food and for liquid storage (amphorae; Krotser and Rattray 1980; Rattray 1988; Robertson 2001:263; Sheehy 1998:299). The ceramics collected by the TMP from the surface of the partially excavated apartment compound and SMO workshop at Tlajinga 33 provide a useful baseline against which other TMP surface collec­tions can be compared (Sanders et al. 1982; Sheehy 1992, 1998; Storey 1987, 1992; Widmer 1987, 1991; Widmer and Storey 1993). Although SMO ware was produced from the same clay as other locally made Early Classic period ceramics, skilled firing at relatively high temperatures in an oxidiz­ing environment made it extremely durable and produced its distinctive orange color (Hopkins 1995; Krotser and Rattray 1980:96; Sheehy 1992, 1998; Sotomayor Castenada 1966). 
SMO pottery production at Tlajinga 33 began in the Early Xolalpan phase, as a complement to the lapidary craft specialty that dates to the pre­ceding Tlamimilolpa phase (Rattray 2001:385; Widmer 1987). The Tlamirnilolpa phase also wit­nessed the construction of nearly 2,000 planned apartment compounds to house the city's residents and an increase in the importance of craft produc­tion and external ties with other regions of

Mesoamerica (Millon 1981:209-210). The pro­duction and distribution of SMO during the Xolal­pan phase coincided with the city's largest population and the height of its interaction abroad (Millon 1993:28-30; Rattray 2001:385-390). Rat­tray (2001 :389) characterizes the Late Xolalpan phase as "a period of stabilization" in the pottery industry, followed by a decline in quality during the Metepec phase. SM 0 continued to be an impor­tant ware during the Metepec phase, although researchers disagree on whether SMO production at the Tlajinga 33 apartment compound slowed as parts of the residence were abandoned (Rattray 2001:399) or ceased prior to the Metepec phase (Sheehy 1992:300). By the end of the Metepec phase, the civic-ceremonial core of Teotihuacan had been looted and burned, with later occupation occurring away from the Street of the Dead (Mil­lon 1981 :238). 
Tlajinga SMO Production 

To assess specialized SMO production at Tlajinga, I examined all SMO sherds (nearly 7,000) from 18 1 TMP surface collections in map squares S3Wl-W3 and S4Wl-W3 (Millon 1973; Millon et al. 1973). These collections include sherds set aside by Paula Krotser ( 1987) as evidence of ceramic production. 2 Although SMO is prevalent during two distinct ceramic phases (Xolalpan and Metepec ), I con­sider these to be a single combined phase because of disagreements in the diagnostic features of Metepec-phase SMO (e.g., Rattray 2001 :297; Sheehy 1998:311).3 I recorded 348 ceramic pro­duction indicators, including lunates (specialized crescent-shaped ceramic smoothers), sherd scrap­ers, a possible rotational support, a possible mold, lumps of fired clay, and possible wasters, which are discussed in more detail below. 
One concern that arose during this study involved differences in interpretations of the archi­tectural remains at 20, 21, 24, and 25:S3W2. Krotser (1987:421) and Rattray (1988:263) argue that these structures may have been temple and platform structures involved in the administration of ceramic production in the district. The TMP database indicates that 24:S3W2 is interpreted as a residence of uncertain status, and Millon notes that "the structures involved did not appear to be built on large platforms, except for those fronting

the 'Street of the Dead.' But the grouping of these structures around a large plaza or open area was confirmed" (1973:18). Survey notes indicate that this large plaza, 35:S3Wl, may have been an open firing area. Alternatively, the area may have served as a local market for the goods produced by Tla­jinga potters (Millon 1981:225). Other important structures in the area include the Eastern Platform, which delimits the eastern extent of the Tlajinga district and is located along the Street of the Dead. Temples and platforms at 7 A-7G:S3Wl are located on top of the Eastern Platform and may have been involved in controlling access to the district or in the distribution of SMO outside of the potting neighborhood. 4 
Probable SMO Production Workshops 
The detection of ceramic workshops has been a topic of interest to researchers using ethnographic (Arnold 1985; Arnold 1990; Graves 1991; Lon­gacre and Stark 1992) and archaeological data (Arnold et al. 1993; Charlton et al. 1993; Curet 1993), as well as a combination of the two (Arnold and Santley 1993; Deal 1988; Pool 1992; Santley et al. 1989; Stark 1985). Archaeologically recov­erable indicators used to define ceramic production locales include unusual concentrations of ceramic wares or forms and the presence of wasters, spe­cialized structures or features, and production tools.5 I require the presence of multiple produc­tion indicators to define a collection as likely to have produced SMO (Arnold and Santley 1993; Stark 1985, 1992; Stark and Garraty 2004). I rank these collections based on the quality and quantity of surface evidence for SMO production, following theassumption that qualitatively and quantitatively stronger indicators of production are generally associated with more intensive production (Sant­ley et al. 1989: 113). 
Unusual Concentrations of Wares or Forms 
The first criterion for defining a likely SMO work­shop is that the collection should include an unusu­ally high concentration of SMO sherds relative to total Xolalpan-and Metepec-phase sherds. Although I examined all Tlajinga district SMO for evidence of production, only those collections with at least 100 Xolalpan-and Metepec-phase sherds were considered possible production locales in order to eliminate problems associated with small sample sizes. Unusual concentrations may reflect sherds from vessels that broke during firing or some other part of the production process prior to being used (Balkansky et al. 1997; Redmond 1979). Stark notes that although unusual concentrations of pot­tery alone may not signify production, "arguments based on unusual concentrations of particular wares or forms are more promising. Absent in most cases has been use of 'typical' domestic inventories as a benchmark against which to compare such atypi­cal concentrations" (1985: 167). 

To establish such a reference point in the pre­sent study, I consider both the overall ratio of SMO to total Xolalpan and Metepec sherds from collec­tions throughout the city and the ratio from vari­ous contexts (i.e., production, domestic, ritual) within the Tlajinga district. The ratio of SMO to total Xolalpan and Metepec sherds for the entire TMP survey is 54,550 to 156,396 sherds, or 34.9 percent. This is lower than both the mean ( 4 2.0 per­cent) and the median (41.9 percent) of SMO per total Xolalpan and Metepec sherds collected from survey tracts in the Tlajinga district. Within the dis­trict, a typical domestic assemblage (e.g., 2:S3Wl ) has 39.3 percent SMO (57 of 145 sherds). An assemblage associated with a typical ritual context (e.g., 7A:S3Wl ) has 23.2 percent SMO, or 13 of 56 sherds. Surface collections from the excavated SMO workshop at 33:S3Wl include 272 of 337 sherds or 80.7 percent SMO (Altschul 1981; Sanders et al. 1982; Sheehy 1992, 1998; Storey 1992; Widmer and Storey 1993). 
I define high proportions of SMO sherds per total Xolalpan-and Metepec-phase sherds as equal to or greater than a threshold value of 60 percent, or the third quartile of this ratio for all collections from the Tlajinga district, following research in other parts of Mesoamerica (Pool and Santley 1992:212). This proportion is greater than those from the nonproduction contexts discussed above. Figure 4 shows the distribution of the proportion of SMO sherds per total Xolalpan-and Metepec­phase sherds plotted against the proportion of pos­sible SMO wasters per total SMO sherds. Those collection tracts to the right of the vertical line have unusual concentrations of SMO sherds at or above the third quartile. Excluding collections with a small quantity (i.e., less than 100 sherds) ofXolal­pan and Metepec pottery, collection tracts with at

Possible Wasters 
To decrease the possibility that the high proportion of SMO reflects specialized use rather than pro­duction, I also require that collections from prob­able workshops include waster sherds from vessels that would have been unusable (Figure 5). These production errors include vitrified, bloated, warped, and fused sherds and sherds with severe cracking (Pool 1992:291; Pool and Santley 1992:212; Rye 1981: 108-115) . Also considered wasters are sherds from vessels that have been severely overfired, refired, underfired, heated too quickly, or cooled very rapidly and sherds with thick gobs of clay adhering to the surface (Pool 1992:291; Rice 1987; Rye 1981; Shepard 1985; Sinopoli 1991; Stark 1985). I use the proportion of possible wasters col­lected by the TMP from the excavated SMO crater workshop at 33:S3Wl (3.3 percent) as a reason­able lower threshold for the relative proportion of SMO wasters at likely Tlajinga district SMO work­shops. Those collections above the solid horizon­tal line in Figure 4 have unusual proportions of SMO wasters that are equal to or exceed the pro­portion of SMO wasters I identified in the TMP sur­face collection from Tlajinga 33. Six collection . tracts meet the criteria of an unusual proportion of

SMO to total Xolalpan and Metepec sherds, a large number of total sherds, and a high proportion of SMO wasters per total SMO sherds: 5, 6, 21, 24, and 25:S3W2; and 33:S3Wl. With 3.1 percent SMO wasters per sherd, 18:S3W2 is just slightly below the 3.3 percent cutoff and has other indica­tors of pottery production.

Pottery production evidence from the Teotihuacan Mapping Project Tlajinga collections: (a) lumps of worked and fired clay from 25:S4Wl, (b) lunates from 24:S3W2, (c) a possible mold from 25:S3W2, (d) a possible rotational sup­port from 18:S3W2, and (e) a sherd with thick gobs of clay adhering to the surface from 24:S3W2. 
tion based on surface artifacts alone (although, con­cerning surface indications of lime kilns in Puebla, see Castanzo and Anderson 2004), the TMP col­lections permit suggestions for future investiga­tion. The partial excavation of Tlajinga 33 revealed an open firing area on a patio outside the northwest comer of the compound (Sheehy 1992; Storey1992;Widmer and Storey 1993). At Tlajinga 33 and in other parts of Mesoamerica, open firing areas or open pit kilns have been identified in excavation based on the presence of a pit dug into the subsoil and associated with a thick layer of charcoal and ash, high densities of wasters and broken pottery, concentrations of prepared and of burnt clay, burnt adobe and bedrock, and soil rich in carbon (Abas­calMacias 1975, 1976; Balkansky et al. 1997: 146; Bordaz 1964; Stark 1985; Winter and Payne 1976). More formal, updraft kilns have been excavated elsewhere in Mesoamerica, although evidence from Terminal Formative and Early Classic period Teoti­huacan indicates that firing occurred in open areas similar to pit kilns in Hidalgo, Nayarit, Oaxaca, and the Puebla-Tlaxcala area (Cabrera Castro 1988; Flannery and Marcus 1983:299; Hernandez et al. 

1999:72; Krotser and Rattray 1980:96; Redmond 1979; Santley et al. 1989; Stone and Turnbull 1941; Whalen 1981 :88-105). I expect surface collections from possible open firing areas to include unusual proportions of deformed wasters, large overtired or retired sherds that may have been used as kiln fur­niture, and concretions of baked or burnt clay. Other indicators such as reddened soil or fire-cracked rock with angular fracture patterns from repeated, high-temperature firings might be identified on the surface. However, because open firings do not maintain high temperatures for an extended period of time, they often are not preserved (Arnold 1978:342; Pool 1992:289; Rye 1981; Shepard 1985; Stark 1985: 165). 
I was unable to confidently identify sherds fired to vitrification as a result of having been used to support vessels during firing. This may be related to the relatively low firing temperatures (below l ,000°C) of the open firing areas likely used at Teotihuacan. Such firings did not sustain high enough temperatures to induce the vitrification and bubbling often associated with kiln-fired ceramics (Hopkins 1995:580; Rye 1981:25). I was able to

identify lumps of fired clay or daub that may reflect stockpiles of raw material that burned in postoc­cupation structural fires or may be the material used in lining firing areas (Figure 5). These may be sim­ilar to the fired adobes found in excavation of Tla­j inga 33 and the clay concretions found in abundance at other pottery production areas in Mesoamerica (Balkansky et al. 1997:148; Red­mond 1979; Sheehy 1992; Stark 1985). Lumps of fired clay or daub occur in four Tlajinga collections: 17, 24, and 34:S3W2 and 25:S4Wl, of which only 24:S3W2 has other strong surface indications for the production of SMO. 
Although the large cleared areas at 35:S3Wl and 7:S3W2 would provide considerable space for fir­ing pottery, excavation ofTlajinga 33 indicates that SMO potters fired their wares on residential patios adjacent to apartment compounds rather than in the cleared areas between residences. I also did not find unusual proportions of SMO wasters and sherds or specialized production tools in the col­lection from 35:S3Wl. Collection tract 7:S3W2 does have an unusual concentration of SMO sherds; however, I only identified one SMO waster in this collection. Excavation of areas with strong surface indications for production like 24:S3W2 will pro­vide larger sample sizes and additional evidence that cannot typically be recovered from the surface, including unfired vessels, lumps or stockpiles of unfired clay, small stone or bone tools, and pigment (e.g., used in painting some of the SMO basins). 
Production Tools 
The presence of production tools like lunates, molds, or possible rotational supports further strengthens the ranking of these likely Tlajinga SMO workshops, although excavation is necessary to confirm or refute the suggestions presented here. Production tools identified in the Tlajinga collec­tions include several lunates, a possible mold, a pos­sible support or rotational device, and reworked sherd scrapers (Figure 5). Other studies of pottery production at Teotihuacan and elsewhere in Mesoamerica have identified lunates or crescent­shaped ceramic smoothers as being associated with pottery production (Hernandez et al. 1999:76; Hop­kins 1995:152; Krotser and Rattray 1980:96). Molds are used to help form the base of a vessel and to rotate the vessel in coiling and shaping. These tools vary greatly in shape, size, and form; and in some cases old pots may be inverted to serve as rotational aids (Arnold 1978:336, 339, 347; Hop­kins 1995:152; Rattray 1988:259-260; Reina and Hill 1978:22-23, plate 191; Sheehy 1992:506; Stark 1985:166; Widmer 1987:361-362). Other researchers argue that Tlajinga bowls were used as molds for forming the base of SMO vessels (Rat­tray 1988:Figure 4). However, I do not consider them specialized tools used exclusively in pottery production, as they were sometimes also "used as serving bowls and ultimately as a container for bur­ial of young infants" (Sheehy 1998:311). 
In the TMP Tlajinga collections I identified 24 lunates from 24:S3W2, three from 25:S4Wl, and one from 48:S3Wl. I identified a possible mold at 25:S3W2 and a possible rotational support at 18:S3W2, with both collection tracts adjacent to 24:S3W2. Molds, powdered with sand or dry clay to prevent the wet vessels from sticking, were likely used to form the pocked or rough bases character­istic of SMO craters (Hopkins 1995:152; Rattray 1988:259-260; Sheehy 1992:Chapter 9; Widmer 1987 :361-362). Although equivocal as production evidence because of their utility in a number of household and other specialized tasks, I also iden­tified six sherd scrapers at 25:S4Wl and one each at 34:S3Wl and at 9 and 24:S3W2. 
Summary of Production Evidence 
Based on the evidence presented above, I distinguish between strong and moderate evidence for the pro­duction of SMO. Collections that I consider to have strong evidence of SMO production have at least 100 Xolalpan and Metepec sherds and an unusual proportion of total SMO sherds and of SMO waster sherds. I define an unusual concentration of total SMO sherds as greater than or equal to the third quartile of the distribution of SMO sherds per total Xolalpan and Metepec sherds (Pool and Santley 1992:212). Unusual proportions of wasters are greater than or equal to the proportion of wasters collected from the excavated SMO crater workshop at Tlajinga 33. Several of the collections that fit the criteria for strong SMO production evidence also contain specialized product10n tools such as lunates, a possible mold, and a possible rotational support. Seven Tlajinga district apartment compounds have strong surface indications for SMO production: col­lection tracts 5, 6, 18, 21, 24, and 25:S3W2, as well as the excavated SMO crater workshop at 33:S3Wl

(Figure 6; Table 1). Although they have less than 100 Xolalpan and Metepec sherds, I have included 18 and 21:S3W2 because their totals are close to this cutoff (99 and 98 sherds, respectively) and both have other indicators of SMO production. Collec­tion tract 21 :S3W2 has a high proportion of possi­ble SMO wasters per total SMO sherds, exceeding proportions and counts of SMO wasters from the surface of 33:S3Wl. The proportion of possible SMO wasters (3.1 percent) from 18:S3W2 is very close to the 3.3 percent collected from 33:S3Wl, and a possible rotational support was recovered from the compound. 
Moderate evidence of SMO production includes collections with greater than 100 Xolalpan and Metepec sherds and unusual concentrations of SMO wasters, although proportions of total SMO fall below the third quartile. Five collections fit the criteria of moderate SMO production evidence: 48:S3Wl; 14, 17, and 33:S3W2; and 25:S4Wl. Although the proportion of SMO wasters falls below the cutoff of 3.3 percent, I also included 25:S4Wl in this group because the surface collec­tion includes lunates and lumps of fired clay. Res­idents at the apartment compounds with moderate evidence for SMO production may have produced low quantities of SMO and/or some non-SMO ware. The collection from 25:S4Wl includes sev­eral griddle sherds, and Krotser ( 1987 :421) notes that three apartment compounds in S3Wl and S3W2 made both SMO and griddles and that one in S4Wl also made Matte Ware covers (for a description of non-SMO vessel forms, see Rattray 2001 ). The possibility of production of some other ware at 24:S4Wl-griddles or Matte Ware cov­ers-should be investigated further.

Nine Tlajinga collections also include some evi­dence for pottery production and were noted in sur­vey as having evidence for possible pottery production: 9, 32, 34, and 49:S3Wl; 4, 9, 26, and 29:S3W2; and 20:S4W2.6 Fourteen other collec­tion tracts (6, 28, and 44:S3Wl; 7, 15, 16, 20, and 34:S3W2; 3 and 13:S4Wl; and 1, 3, 4\ and 12:S4W2) have some indications of pottery'pro­duction but were not noted in survey as possibly having been involved in pottery production. 
Assessing Specialized Production 

Specialized production may be manifest in ware and form specialization and dimensional stan­dardization (Arnold 1991a:364; Blackman et al. 1993). Standardization may also be evident in clay 
and temper composition as well as in stylistic and formal attributes (Arnold and Santley 1993:231; Rice 1987:203; Sinopoli 1988). For the purposes of this article, I focus on vessel form specialization and dimensional standardization because I have not yet identified compositional subgroups within theTlajingadistrict SMO. Hopkins (1995:464) has documented distinctions in the composition of SMOpastes throughout the city, observing that the 
majority of the metamorphic inclusions and the only example of polycrystalline quartz inclusions derive from the northwest of the city in map squares N6W2-W3 and N5W2-W3. 
Vessel Form Specialization 
Elsewhere in Mesoamerica, the scale and intensity of pottery production have been assessed by con­sidering specialization in particular wares and forms with larger, more specialized production units tending to specialize in fewer wares and forms (Santley et al. 1989:126). Vessel form specializa­tion is related to the scale and intensity of produc­tion, in that the reduced number of actions required for making a few forms, rather than the whole range of forms, may permit more efficient production of massive quantities. 
I consider amphorae, basins, and craters as these were the three most common SMO forms distrib­uted throughout the city during the Xolalpan and Metepec phases (Hopkins 1995:132, 152). Figure 7 shows the proportion of possible amphora wasters as a ratio of the total SMO amphora sherds plotted against the total SMO amphora sherds as a ratio of the total SMO sherds. Figures 8 and 9 plot these proportions for basins and craters, respectively.

Table 2 summarizes the vessel forms emphasized at each of the seven possible SMO workshops that meet the criteria detailed above. 
In assessing the evidence for vessel form spe­cialization in the Tlajinga district, I distinguish between strong and moderate evidence for the pro­duction of a particular vessel form. These desig­nations are based on the expectation that workshops specializing in a particular form should have unusual proportions of waster sherds exhibiting fir­ing errors (Stark 1985). Collections with propor­tions greater than the mean of both waster and total sherds of a particular form are considered to have strong evidence for specializing in that form (e.g., 24:S3W2 in Figure 7). Workshops with moderate evidence for specializing in a particular SMO form have greater than the mean proportion of possible SMO wasters of that form but less than the mean proportion of total sherds of that form (e.g., 33:S3Wl in Figure 7). In all cases, I also require that a given workshop assemblage contain greater than the mean number of sherds of that vessel form for all collection tracts in the Tlajinga district (i.e., so that unusual proportions are based on relatively large samples). The mean number of amphora sherds from Tlajinga collections is four, for basins the mean is one, and for craters the mean is 30. 
Most of the probable SMO workshops show moderate to strong evidence for producing two or three of the major SMO forms. Figure 10 summa­rizes the evidence for strong and moderate pro­duction of the three major SMO forms from the likely workshops identified above. The western portion of the cluster of SMO workshops in the Tla­jinga district has strong evidence of amphora and basin production (24 and 25:S3W2) and moderate evidence of crater production (21, 24, and 25:S3W2). The easternmost compounds in this cluster have strong evidence for basin (5 and 6:S3W2) and crater production (6:S3W2 and 33:S3Wl), with moderate evidence for amphora production at 33:S3Wl. Only one possible work· shop shows a strong indication of having empha· sized just one form (basins at 5:S3W2). As discussed below, an analysis of variance (ANOVA) to test for the significance of observed differences in means suggests that the rim diameters of small and medium-large basins from 5:S3W2 are not sig· nificantly different from those from other Tlajinga SMO workshops. No collection shows strong evi· dence for having produced only craters or 
amphorae. 
Amphora Specialization. Although eclipsed by the crater form during the Xolalpan phase, amphorae become the major SMO form in the Metepec phase (Rattray 2001:265, 299). Strong evidence for amphora production occurs only at 24 and 25:S3W2, with moderate evidence at 33:S3Wl (Figures 7 and 10). Surface indications from 33:S3Wl are supported by excavation, which revealed the production of SM 0 amphorae in small quantities at the apartment compound (Rattray 1988:263; Sheehy 1992). The distribution of lunates, tools especially useful for smoothing the restricted necks of amphorae, reflects this limited production (Hopkins 1995; Krotser and Rattray 1980:96). The vast majority (85.7 percent) of the lunates in the TMP Tlajinga district collections derive from 24:S3W2. The collection from 25:S4Wl includes 10.7 percent, and that from 48:S3Wl has 3.6 percent of the total lunates. Although 25:S4Wl and 48:S3Wl do not have strong evidence for the production of SMO ware, residents may have produced ollas, jars, or other similar forms with restricted necks or other con­stricted areas more easily smoothed with the crescent-shaped tools. 
Basin Specialization. SMO basins seem to have been produced in much smaller quantities than either craters oramphorae, and Sheehy (1998:313) has argued that they may have been imitations of another form. Basins are the only consistently painted form of SMO and may have been used for serving particular kinds of food or for presenting food at specific functions like feasts or ceremonies (Rattray 2001: 301 ). Strong evidence for basin pro­duction occurs at 5, 6, 24, and 25:S3W2 (Figures

8 and 10). 
Crater Specialization. During the Late Xolal­pan phase SMO craters were distributed to most parts of the city, despite their waning popularity in later Metepec times (Rattray 2001 :265, 299). Craters are by far the most abundant Tlajinga SM 0fonn in terms of both possible wasters and total sherds, and evidence for the production of this form ismost widespread in the Tlajinga district. The col­lection from 6:S3W2 shows strong evidence for SMO crater production (Figures 9-10). The exca­vated SMO crater workshop at 33:S3Wl has a slightly lower proportion of SMO crater wasters than the 2.6 percent mean for all Tlajinga collec­tions, with 2.4 percent crater wasters. Collection 
tracts 21, 24, and 25:S3W2 show moderate evi­dence for crater production. The collection from 18:S3W2 falls below the cut-off for all SMO forms; however, the collection from this apartment com­pound includes a possible rotational support that may have been used to form SMO vessels. 
Dimensional Standardization 
As with specialization by ware and form, dimen­sional standardization may also be related to the scale and intensity of production as producers opt for the increased efficiency of making a single size for vessels produced in large quantities. Standard­ized sizes facilitate stacking of vessels in firing, storage, and transport to markets (Arnold 1991a;

Blackman et al. 1993:71-73; Sinopoli 1988). A review of the ethnographic and archaeological lit­erature reflects the complexity inherent in linking product standardization to specialized ceramic pro­duction (Arnold 1991a; Arnold and Santley 1993; Blackman et al. 1993; Costin and Hagstrom 1995; Longacre et al. 1988; Sinopoli 1988). Other researchers have used various methods to examine dimensional standardization (Arnold 1991a:366; Arnold and Santley 1993:232; Blackman et al. 
1993:71; Costin and Hagstrom 1995:631; Lon­gacre et al. 1988:103-105; Plog 1985; Pool 1990; Stark 1995:238-239). I consider histograms, descriptive statistics, box plots, and ANOVA, which is based on the F distribution and permits simulta­neous comparison of two or more samples to eval­uate whether there is a significant difference in the means (Kirby 1993; Sheskin 2000:511; Stevens 1986). 
In the analysis presented here, I use 1,891 of the 2,055 total rim diameters that I recorded from Tla­jinga SMO sherds with an arc length greater than or equal to 5 cm. These include 28 1 amphora ( 13. 7 percent of the 2,055 total rims), 180 basin (8.8 per­cent), and 1,430 crater (69.6 percent) sherds. Another 164 sherds (7.9 percent of the total rim diameters recorded) are from other vessel fonns that were not typically made in SMO ware for dis­tribution outside of Tlajinga but which may have been produced for local consumption by Tlajinga residents (Rattray 2001:263, 299). 
I examined histograms of rim diameters from the three different vessel forms for evidence of mul­tiple modes indicating possible size groups. I have divided basins into small (14-35 cm), medium (36-60 cm), and medium-large (36--86 cm) size classes based on modalities I observed in the basin rim diameter distribution (Figure 11).7 I have com-

bined the medium and large categories together because I only recorded 14 examples of large (61-86 cm) basin rim sherds in the district, half of which were from workshops. I did not divide amphora and crater rim diameters into separate size classes because the distributions of rim diameters for these vessel forms are unimodal and do not sug­gest multiple size classes. 
I also inspected various summary statistics for assemblages of each of the three major vessel forms in Tlajinga collection tracts including median, mean, standard deviation (s), variance (s2), and coefficient of variation (CV) as presented in Table 3 (Sheskin 2000; Sullivan 2002:Tables 7-8). The coefficient of variation is the standard deviation divided by the mean and is particularly useful in studies of dimensional standardization as it pro­vides a standardized measure of dispersion (Shen­nan 1992:44). As expected by the standardization hypothesis, a comparison of coefficients of varia­tion for amphora and small basin sherds indicates that the combined workshop assemblages are slightly more standardized than those from the combined non workshop assemblages. Unexpected based on the standardization hypothesis, coeffi­cients of variation from assemblages of medium­large basin and of crater sherds demonstrate that combined workshop assemblages are slightly less standardized than the combined nonworkshop assemblages. In all cases differences are slight, as is supported by a comparison of the interquartile ranges of the box plots of rim diameters from the three vessel forms from both workshop and non­workshop contexts (Figures 12-15). 
The distribution of amphora rim diameters from the likely SMO workshops follows the expectation of the standardization hypothesis (Figure 12). Likely SMO workshops with strong indications for

amphora production (24 and 25:S3W2) have smaller interquartile ranges (i.e., the dispersion around the mean, or typical observation) than the excavated workshop at 33:S3Wl where some amphorae were produced. For small basins, the expectation of the standardization hypothesis is not met, in that the only likely SMO workshop that may have focused on producing basins (5:S3W2) has a very large interquartile range, reflecting greater dis­persion of scores around the mean (Figure 13). For medium-large basins, the distribution of rim diam­eters from 5:S3W2 does conform to the expecta­tions of the standardization hypothesis (Figure 14 ). 8 Craters do not conform to the expectation of the standardization hypothesis, in that the excavated SMO crater workshop has a relatively less stan­dardized assemblage (larger interquartile range) than the likely SMO workshops (24 and 25:S3W2) that show only moderate surface indications for producing the crater form (Figure 15). Crater rim diameters from 6:S3W2, with strong surface indi­cations for crater production, do conform to the expectation of the standardization hypothesis. 
I also used ANOVA to test for significant dif­ferences in the collections (Table 4 ).9 Other researchers have argued that SMO amphorae are uniform enough that they may be assigned to spe­cific workshops (Rattray 1988:261, 2001:263). ANOVA does not support this argument in tenns of dimensional standardization of rim diameters; however, other attributes such as rim form and sur­face finish should also be considered. Although workshop assemblages of small and medium-large basin rim diameters tend to be somewhat smaller than those for nonworkshops, the only significant difference between workshop and nonworkshop assemblages occurs with craters (F 43.55; df =

differences between 33:S3Wl and 24 and 25:S3W2 (for probabilities, see Figure 16). 11 With both the Bonferroni adjustment and the Tukey test, signifi­cant differences are also documented between 33:S3Wl and 6:S3W2 and between 25:S3W2 and 5:S3W2. The Fisher test, which allows the small­est difference between means, indicates significant differences between 33:S3Wl and all other possi­ble workshops except 5:S3W2, between 5:S3W2 and 24 and 25:S3W2, and between 6:S3W2 and 25:S3W2. 
Considering the spatial patterns, those work­shops with the strongest evidence for SMO crater production are located to the east and generally produced larger craters (6:S3W2 and 33:S3Wl); meanwhile, those compounds with moderate evi­dence for crater production, and which were gen­erally producing smaller craters, are located to the west (21, 24, and 25: S3W2 ). However, not all east­ern and western SMO crater workshops show sig­nificant differences, as the more conservative post hoc tests show that the collection from 6:S3W2, in the eastern cluster, is not significantly different from any of those from the western cluster work­shops.

cialized SMO workshop at 6:S3W2, with strong evidence for both basin and crater production, has a relatively more standardized assemblage of craters than does 33:S3Wl, with strong evidence for crater production. The three western workshops with only moderate indications for crater produc­tion also have relatively more standardized assem­blages than 33:S3Wl, with strong indication for crater production. 
The Organization of Tlajinga District SMO Production 
To interpret the vessel form specialization and dimensional standardization data and discuss the organization of SMO production in the Tlajinga district, I return to Costin's (1991, 2001) four parameters of production-context, concentra­tion, scale, and intensity. Context involves either independent or attached specialists. Excavation of Tlajinga 33 indicates that in the Tlajinga dis­trict, SMO potters were independent, with pro­duction facilities located within individual apartment compounds. I did not find evidence for SMO production in the open area at 35:S3Wl
