ACCOUNTING IN THE KING'S STOREHOUSE: 
THE INKAWASI KHIPU ARCHIVE 

Gary Urton and Alejandro Chu 
The site of Inkawasi (or Incahuasi) is located in the Canete Valley, on the south coast of Peru. It was a major garrison and storage facility for the lnka expansion onto the south coast, built for housing and provisioning troops in the Inka assault on the Huarco peoples. Archaeological excavations of the storage facility have exposed what is to date a collection of 34 khipus (or quipusJ, the Inka knotted-string recording devices. We first explain why we consider the collection to constitute an "archive" and what the implications of that classification are for considering the significance of such a large collection of accounting devices associated with state storage. Several of the khipus were found associated with, or covered by, aji (Capsicum sp.), peanuts ( Arachis hypogaeaJ, and black beans (Phaseolus vulgarisJ. We suggest that these may be the products that the khipus recorded. Several khipus were tied together, and two sets of tied, paired samples are shown to contain very similar quantitative records. Close study of the paired samples, as well as the numerical values knotted into several other khipus, reveal different 
strategies that were being used by the khipu-keepers to maintain "checks-and-balances" accounting. Evidence was also found of possible standardized accounting units for agricultural produce brought to Inkawasi. These took the form of a grid-like array of squares produced by impressing ropes into the floors of two rectangular sorting spaces in the storage complex. The grid-work of squares may have served in the process of spreading out the produce on the floor and collecting and accounting for these products in standardized units. We conclude with reflections on how the processes, procedures, and routines of accounting observed at Inkawasi provide information for approaching the writing of an autochthonous history of the Inka state based on the study of accounting practices.

ted cord devices known as khipu (also quipu; Quechua: "knot"). Scientific study of the khipus began early in the twentieth century (Locke 1923) and has continued, with varying degrees of in­tensity, until today (see Urton 2008a). In fact, we have long known that these two important technologies-storage and khipus-were inti­mately connected in Inka statecraft. For example, this connection was the subject of one of the drawings by Guaman Poma de Ayala (Figure 1), in which we see a khipukamayuq ("knot maker/or­ganizer/animator") displaying his cord account to the Inka, Topa Inca Yupanqui, in a setting dom­inated by buildings labeled collca ("storehouse"). 
Set against the longstanding interest in both these technologies is the fact that there have been to date only a few instances in which khipus have been found in association with storehouses. The few such cases that have been published until now, all of which pertain to coastal Inka sites, are intriguing but have not led to substantive khipu studies of storehouse accounting. For ex­ample, in his work at the great central coastal pilgrimage center of Pachacamac, in the Lurfn Valley, just south of Lima, Peter Eeckhout (2012) excavated a collection of nine khipus from a rec­tangular storage structure (designated ES) at the site. The khipus were fragile and poorly pre­served, and Eeckhout was unable to open any of the samples in order to study them closely (2012:219). Nonetheless, it was clear to Eeckhout from the context in which the khipus were found that local storehouse accounting was indeed car­ried out at Pachacamac, at least in relation to goods brought and deposited there by pilgrims visiting the oracle. On the south coast of Peru, Francis Riddell excavated a few khipus associated with a textile bundle found in a burial at the site of Quebrada de la Vaca (Riddell 2007). This site contains an enclosed rectangular plaza whose ground is marked off into strips by stones em­bedded in the surface of the plaza (see Urton 1991), as well as a bank of storage chambers on one side of the plaza. Katterman speculated that the khipus excavated at Quebrada de la Vaca may have belonged to a khipukamayuq accountant (Katterman 2007:223). No study has been pub­lished on the khipu samples found at the site. 
Conversely, we have examples of colonial doc­umentary sources on storehouse accounting, but 
in these cases we do not have the khipu records themselves available for study (see Julien 1988, and Parssinen and Kiviharju 2004). The most no­table of such cases is the storehouse accounting produced by one of the lords of Wanka, in Hatun Xauxa in the central Peruvian highlands in the 1550s. The first record of this accounting appears in the chronicle of Cieza de Leon, who requested a demonstration of khipu reading from a Wanka khipukamayuq in the Mantaro Valley in 1533 (Cieza de Leon 1967 [1533]:35). The Wanka lord detailed from his khipu account all the local pro­visions that had been given to or stolen by the Spaniards from the storehouses in the Mantaro Valley. The taking of these storehouse items later became the subject of a court case in which a documentary record was made of the khipu ac­counting produced by the Wanka lord (Espinoza 197 1 [1558-6 1]; Murra 1975). Unfortunately, the actual khipu or khipus from which the Wanka lord produced his account has never been recov­ered. We have in this case a good record of store­house accounting, but it is an account transcribed by a Spanish scribe in alphanumeric script -not in cords and colors and knots. 
Thus, although we have long known from ar­chaeological excavations and colonial written sources that khipus were employed in storehouse accounting, to date we have not recovered well­preserved samples in a good archaeological con­text, within storehouses, that could afford us in­sights into the precise methods and procedures of storehouse accounting in the Inka empire. The re­cent (2013-2014) scientific excavation by co-au­thor Alejandro Chu of a collection of 34 khipus from the Inka storehouse facility at the site of Inkawasi, on the south coast of Peru, has given us the opportunity to study khipu accounting in its appropriate setting. This article is the first report on that excavation as well as on what the initial analysis of these khipus teaches us about the prin­ciples, practices, and techniques of storehouse ac­counting in the Inka Empire. Before examining the Inkawasi khipus closely, however, it will be useful to consider some of the administrative im­plications of the discovery of accounting "docu­ments" in a setting like Inkawasi, located on the south coast of Peru, far from the highland Inka capital of Cuzco.

state storage facility far from Cuzco, where the major overseers of lnka record keeping and state finance would have been located, prompts an im­portant question about the exercise of power in the Inka state: How were the Inkas, from their court in Cuzco, able to monitor and control ac­counting in a distant setting such as the coastal site of Inkawasi? We suggest that the key to the exercise of power at a distance in the Inka state was the combination of (a) a complex and precise system of recording numerical data; (b) a power­ful, highly efficient, and shared (among khipu­keepers around the empire) set of accounting pro­cedures and practices; and (c) the training and deployment to critical sites of a highly knowl­edgeable cadre of record keepers, the khipuka­mayuqs (for fuller discussions of these matters, see Urton [2006, 2008a, 20 10]). The archaeolog­ical remains at Inkawasi provide direct and indi­rect evidence for all of these features of Inka ac­counting and controls. What it is most important to consider closely here, from a theoretical point of view, is what we ought to expect in terms of the nature and characteristics of the physical instruments -the cord accounts-of an adminis­trative system in which centers of operation are located at great distances from the site (or sites) where administrative overseers are located. 

In a wide-ranging and stimulating study enti­tled "Accounting Numbers as 'Inscription': Ac­tion at a Distance and the Development of Ac­counting," Keith Robson (1992) has argued that in order for efficient and effective accounting and controls to take place, especially in circumstances like those described at Inkawasi (although his own examples are drawn largely from the cuneiform tablets of ancient Mesopotamia), the records must meet a limited set of specific criteria. The qualities that Robson argues are essential in order for inscriptions to be effective at a distance and over the long term are that they must be mo­bile, stable, and combinable. 
As for the first criterion, mobility, Robson means that accounting inscriptions are required to move from the actor, in the accounting context, to a distant place where the accounts are inspected, and (often) back again. Robson cites Goody's ob­servation on the importance of mobility in relation to the requirement of comparing different docu­ments from different times and places: "The pres­ence of documents enables one to lay side by side different accounts emanating from different times and different places, and so perceive contradic­tions" (Robson 1992:693). We will see below that the Inkawasi khipus display this capacity, partic­ularly in what are pairs of linked (i.e., tied to­gether) and matching khipus, the latter of which are copies of each other. Aside from these features of khipu accounting is the well-known fact that messengers known as chaskis carried khipus along the Inka roads throughout the length and breadth of the empire. Thus, the khipus were, indeed, highly mobile "inscriptions." 
The second quality of inscriptions that are in­tended to act at a distance is stability. By this, Robson means, in the first place, that the inscrip­tions must resist decay and corruption, a condition that is fairly well met in the setting at Inkawasi, given the excellent conditions for preservation of organic materials on the dry coastal desert of south­ern Peru. But more interestingly, Robson also con­ceives of the stability of inscriptions in terms of their being recognizable, or legible, to their users, as well as the existence of a stable relation between the inscription and the context to which it refers. Said another way, there must be internal conven­tions by which the accounts are understood to com­municate and to have meaning. This involves stable conventions of grammar and syntax by means of which accounts may be recorded and interpreted, as well as the use of regular (i.e., "stable") mathe­matical conventions that may be carried out on el­ements within the accounting. We should note here a particularly interesting and relevant example of this principle, especially for our study of lnkawasi cord accounting, in the form of an arithmetical manipulation which Robson refers to as "horizontal equivalences:" 
The reduction of numerical relations to alge­braic formulae, i.e., variable numbers, pro­duces inscriptions which exhibit the principle of 'reversibility.' By this I mean that formulae allow arbitrary transformations that can be carried out to both sides of the equation with­out upsetting the equality ... Numerical equa­tions create stable, reversible relations and allow transformations and combinations not easily achievable in ordinary speech [Robson 1992:695, Note 19; emphasis added].

We believe that we have identified in the khipus at Inkawasi what Robson describes here as the principles of equality and reversibility of arith­metical operations. We will see these in the form of recording numerical data representing the sum­ming and subtraction of values recorded on pairs of khipus in two alternative, reciprocal formulas. We argue that these were critical elements of the system of accounting and controls in storehouse accounting at Inkawasi. 
Finally, the third quality of inscriptions that allows them to perform the work of control at a distance is combinability. As Robson states the matter, this feature "allows the actor to accumu­late inscriptions, aggregate them, tabulate them, recombine them in order to establish new rela­tionships, and calculate 'norms' through which to compare the settings to be influenced in ac­cordance with his or her specific objectives, aims or ideals (1992:697) ." What is particularly rele­vant to take note of in Robson's further commen­tary is that internal account comparisons often lead to the practice-or what we could call a culture-of internal surveillance. 
The continuous surveillance created by the accounts has the potential to create auto-reg­ulatory effects: the individualising power of accounting inscriptions are such that one can be subject to control not only from 'without', but the inscriptions that measure and survey the individual have also the potential for cre­ating an internal form of control. Accounting inscriptions serve to construct and discipline the individual in what it is he or she knows about him or her self [Robson I 992:700; emphases in original]. 
With this final feature of accounting inscriptions, we arrive at an aspect of accounting practice that is critical, regardless of the setting (i.e., cultural context) in which it occurs: the importance of surveillance and controls as essential elements of the culture and practice of accounting. We will find in the Inkawasi khipu collection several recording features whereby the principles of ex­ternal regulation and internal controls (or self­surveillance) were well in place. 
Because of the absence heretofore of khipu collections recovered from their original archae­ological contexts, especially in relation to store­house accounting, we have not previously seen evidence of the accounting practices identified above, especially those relating to the internal comparison and summing of accounts, and gen­eral accounting and controls procedures crucial to effective accounting regimes. We now have clear and compelling evidence of such practices in the khipus recovered at Inkawasi. 
In order to describe and analyze the Inkawasi khipu collection in relation to the various issues raised above (as well as others), we will consider the following questions in this paper: What are the characteristics of the 34 samples that make up the Inkawasi khipu collection? Where, within the site of Inkawasi, were the khipu samples re­covered, and with what other materials were they associated? What insights do we gain into Inka record keeping and accounting principles and practices from a close study of the Inkawasi khi­pus recovered to date? And finally, what can we learn from the Inkawasi khipu samples in terms of the larger question of how surveillance and controls were effected at a distance-e.g., in sites such as the storage facility at Inkawasi -in the Inka Empire? 
The Brief History of an Iuka Military 
Installation and Accounting Center 

The archaeological site of Inkawasi is located on the south coast of Peru, some 28 km up the Cafiete Valley on the left bank of the river. It is a Late Horizon (ca. A.D. 1450-1532) Inka site of quite impressive size, complexity, and state of preser­vation (Figure 2). The site was the subject of an extensive program of survey and mapping by 
U.S. archaeologist John Hyslop (1985) between 1979 and 1983. 
Further back in time, Inkawasi (or Incahuasi; Quechua: "Inka house") is extensively described in the chronicles of Cieza de Leon (1967 [1553]) and Garcilaso de la Vega (1966 [ 1609]). In the earlier and probably more authoritative of these accounts, Cieza states that Inkawasi was built as a staging area for the Inka conquest of the south coast, particularly in their efforts to defeat the warlike Huarco people. Both Cieza and Garcilaso note that Inkawasi was built on the model of Cuzco, the Inka capital. According to Cieza, "[the Inka] built a new city, to which he gave the name

of New Cuzco, the same as his main seat. They also tell that he ordered that the districts of the city and the hills should have the same names as those of Cuzco" (cited in Hyslop 1985:9). 
In the second part of the Cr6nica General, Cieza de Leon recounts what occurred at the end of the war lasting several years that the Inka waged against the people of Huarco: 
Peace having been restored to the valley, and mitimaes [workers transplanted from else­where in the empire] and a governor sent there, after receiving the embassies the Yungas and many of the mountain folk sent him, he ordered the New Cuzco he had built razed, and with all the army he returned to the city of Cuzco [cited in Hyslop 1985: 11-12; emphasis added]. 
If Cieza was correct in his mention of the raz­ing of the site at the end of the war-an act not included in Garcilaso's account-then we would not be surprised to find evidence of a general and fairly rapid destruction of the site. There is evi­dence of burning in certain parts of Inkawasi. 
Nonetheless, although we discuss evidence of materials buried under collapsed walls, the con­dition of the ruins today does not seem to support the proposition that the site was "razed" by the Inkas, as stated by Cieza de Leon. Alternatively, D' Altroy and Earle (1992: 182) have noted, citing Pedro Sancho's account of 1532-1533, that the Inkas considered storehouses to be an important military target; therefore, they attempted to de­stroy all warehouse complexes as they retreated before the Spanish invasion. It should be noted that Chu found evidence for a small occupation of Inkawasi after the time of the Spanish con­quest, into the early Colonial period. 
Due to the intense interest invested by the Inka state in Inkawasi during its apparently rapid con­struction and brief use history, it is reasonable to suppose that considerable care and attention would have been accorded to the site, at least ini­tially. This expectation is borne out from a tour of the site, which reveals generally well-preserved ruins of large and finely made residential sectors, a palace with an ushnu (ceremonial enclosure with seat/throne), and a massive storage facility

containing small square and larger rectangular storage bins (collcas; Hyslop 1985:14). It is a collection of khipus excavated from the storage facility by Chu in 2013 and 2014 that will com­mand our attention in the present article. 
To date, Chu has excavated a total of 34 khipus from various locations within the storage com­plex, which is referred to as Qolqawasi ("store­house"). A general description of 29 of the Inkawasi khipus (several samples were too fragile or fragmentary to permit their study) is contained in Supplemental Appendix 1. 
The Inkawasi Khipu Archive: 
A General Overview 

Figure 3 is a schematic plan of the Inkawasi storage complex, known as Qolqawasi. Immediately to 
the north, separated from the storage complex by a narrow corridor, there is a set of rooms on two sides of a trapezoidal plaza/patio designated as Sector C by Hyslop. At the middle of the plaza are the foundations of an ushnu (a ceremonial structure for pouring libations to the earth), along with the foundations of several round columns along the south side of the plaza/patio; these columns are thought to have supported a roof structure. These structures belong to a Temple of the Sun complex and had no direct relationship with the storage complex because both complexes had only one access at their respective northern sides. 
The storage complex is organized around and on either side of a central northwest/southeast passageway, at the center of which lies what Hys­lop termed a "central platform." Access to the central passageway is gained from the north by

an entryway that connects with a long narrow corridor running north-northeast/south-southwest and dividing the complex roughly in half. Moving from north to south, the following structures are located on either side of this central axis (that is, each feature occurs twice): (a) a pair of rectan­gular structures of a form often referred to as kallankas; (b) a long rectangular sorting or drying space1 whose length is equivalent to the combined lengths of the pair of kallankas; and (c) 18 rec­tangular storage bins, the outer nine of which are shorter on their long axes than the inner nine. The structures in (a) and (b) have been designated as Subsector Al, and those in (c) as Subsector A2 (see Figure 3). 
Thus, in total there are four kallankas labeled 
U.A. (Unidades Arquitect6nicas, or Architectural Units) I, 2, 4, and 5; two sorting/drying spaces 
(U.A. 7 and 8); and 36 rectangular storage bins making up the core of the storage complex. The narrow corridor bisecting the complex is desig­nated U.A. 3. Subsector A3, located around the west, south, and east sides of the inner storage area, contains some 209 small square storage bins. Hyslop estimated that the square bins in Qolqawasi contained 6,400 m3 of storage capacity.2 
The notable grid-like regularity of the Qolqawasi facility is in keeping with the regular layout and organization of lnka storage facilities, especially those found at highland sites (Earle 1992:339; LeVine 1992: 19). Nonetheless, whereas many of these sites contain a mix of rectangular and circular storage chambers, there are no circular storage deposits at Inkawasi. Morris (1967) hy­pothesized that the different sizes and shapes of storage facilities may have served an accounting function, with certain products being destined for storage in specifically shaped storehouses (i.e., circular storehouses for maize and rectangular ones for tubers). Nonetheless, to date we have little evidence to support this hypothesis. 
In 20 13 Chu and his team began excavating the narrow corridor on the north end of the storage complex (U.A. 3 in Subsector Al; see Figure 3). They found that the walls bordering this corridor had collapsed. Under the wall debris, Chu en­countered what appeared as a single, very large khipu lying on the floor of the corridor. This turned out to be a large mass or "pile" composed of seven khipus, some of which were tied together by their primary cords (Supplemental Appendix I, UR255-UR261). We may well wonder whether the presence of numerous khipus on the floor of the corridor, under a collapsed wall, in a setting that suggests that they were in the process of be­ing knotted or read, or were undergoing some other accounting procedure, may be evidence of the destruction and rapid abandonment of the site reported by Cieza de Leon. 
A number of additional remains, including lo­cal and provincial Inka sherds (Supplemental Fig­ure 1), a variety of foodstuffs, and a few small textile and cordage fragments were found asso­ciated with the khipus along the corridor. The botanical remains (Supplemental Figure 2) in­cluded maize cobs, lucuma seeds, bean pods, fish vertebrae, and mollusk and shrimp fragments. The wall collapse covered the material-khipus, sherds, foodstuffs, and textiles-on the corridor floor. 
Further excavations in the northern sector of the storage facility revealed additional khipus on the floors of all four of the kallanka structures 
(U.A. 1, 2, 4, and 5; see Figure 3), as well as on the floor of the west sorting/drying space (U.A. 7). Thus, all of the khipus were recovered in structures on the north end of the storage complex (Subsector Al), both to the east and west of the central axis. 
Beyond their discovery in a part of the site that appears to have been used for receiving and recording food crops (but possibly other items as well) that were undoubtedly destined for the stor­age bins, several of the khipus were actually found covered by certain of these plant items. For ex­ample, one khipu (UR271) that was excavated from the floor of kallanka U.A. 5 was covered by enough black beans (Phaseolus vulgaris) to fill two cupped hands. It is presumed that this khipu was used in the accounting of black beans, al­though there is nothing obvious about its appear­ance that may indicate this. Two khipus were found together inside a rectangular basket covered with chili peppers in the drying/sorting space U .A. 7, and 14 samples were found in the southwest comer of kallanka U.A. 4 covered with peanuts. The locations of these khipu finds associated with agricultural products are shown in Figure 4. 
Few other cultural remains were found on the floors inside the kallankas. Some pottery sherds

Inkaic Archival Organization and Accounting Practices 
In an earlier article, Urton (2005) studies several khipus in museum collections that display one or the other, or both, of two particularly notable fea­tures related to the archival disposition of khipus: "linking" and "matching." The former designation refers to two or more samples that are joined­like two documents stapled together-usually by having their primary cords tied to each other. "Matching" khipus are those in which the series of numerical values recorded in knots on the pen­dant strings attached to the primary cords of each khipu are identical ("matching") or close to iden­tical ("closely matching"). In some cases, the col­ors or color patterns of the matching samples co­incide as well; nonetheless, in applying the designation of "matching" to two khipu samples in the present study, we give priority to the coin­cidence of sequences of numbers, regardless of whether their color patterning matches. 

An example of linked khipus from the Inkawasi archive is shown in Figure 5. The join­ing of this pair is at the top center of the image, 
where the primary cords are tied together. These 
khipus (UR267 A and UR267B) were two of the 
three samples that were found rolled up, placed 
in a basket, and covered with aji (chili peppers) 
in kallanka U.A. 7. Another linked pair of khipus 
(UR255 and UR256), which was found in the 
"pile" of khipus in the corridor on the north edge 
of the storage complex, is shown in Figure 6. 
The large bunching of cords at the top center of 
the image is where the primary cords of the two 
khipus are tied together. 
What is particularly interesting about these two linked pairs of khipus is that they are also "matching," or "closely matching" khipus, with one element of the match in the first linked set and the other element in the second. The numer­ical values recorded on khipu UR267 A closely match those recorded on UR255, and the values on UR267B closely match those recorded on UR256-although less so than in the former pair. In short, as we view Figures 5 and 6, the two khipus on the left side of each pair closely match each other, as do the two on the right side. 
Several considerations about these pairs of linked and matching khipus are important in re­lation to the types and level of accounting that were being carried out at Inkawasi. Most notably, the pairs seem to be clear evidence of the exis­tence of a concept and related set of procedures for carrying out "checks-and-balances" account­

stance, two accountants recording information about the same circumstance, or the coordination of records from one accounting event to another. The need for such verification procedures could arise in maintaining records for what is received for storage, versus what is actually stored, re­trieved, or dispensed (on general questions con­cerning trust and verification in khipu record keeping, see Urton 2005, 2009). 
Because the linked khipus UR267 A and UR267B were found in a basket covered with chili peppers on the floor of kallanka U .A. 7 and the linked khipus UR255 and UR256 were found in the corridor outside of kallanka U .A. 7, it seems likely that the former were records of what was actually in the process of being stored, and the latter recorded these same items when they had come into the complex. An alternative explanation is that the latter were an oversight (checks-and­balances) set of records. It is difficult to be more specific than this. In any case, these two pairs of linked and matching khipus provide evidence for the practice of checks-and-balances accounting­in other words, surveillance and control-at Inkawasi. 

Addition/Subtraction of Repeating Values in 
Matching Khipus 

There is another intriguing feature of Inka record­keeping on display in the Inkawasi khipus-a fea­ture which has not been previously encountered in khipu research elsewhere in the Andes. This is the repeated occurrence of a particular number in the sequence of numerical values recorded on strings along a khipu and a related pattern in which that repeating numerical value is added to or sub­tracted from the values recorded on adjacent cords. This recording feature is evident in the two sets of closely matching khipu pairs, UR267 A/UR255 and UR267B/UR256. For the former pair, the re­peating numerical value is 15, and for the latter pair this value is 10. Besides the regular repetition of these numerical values, distinctive patterns of addition and subtraction occur across sets of three cords within both pairs. In the first pair, the se­quence x I 15 I y recurs in one khipu and x I y I 15 in the other. The difference between the values of x and y is 15. For example, the sequence 127 I 15 I 112 occurs in khipu UR267 A, with the corre­sponding sequence 127 I 112 I 15 occurring in

Cord#  Cord#  Table 2 do clearly indicate that the two samples  


were related to each other in a significant manner. 
Before we go on to discuss and analyze the 
data presented in Tables 1 and 2, we note that 
there are two other khipus from Inkawasi that 
display repeating addition/subtraction values. 
Both are from a group of 14 khipus found in 
kallanka U .A. 4 covered with peanuts: sample UR266 has the repeating value of 47, and sample 
UR268 has the repeating value of 208. None of 
the other three khipus from kallanka U.A. 4 that

What could have been the meaning and intent of these repeating values, which are added to or subtracted from the values on adjacent cords? We suggest two possible explanations. First, these numbers could have been amounts of goods­something like a tax -that were removed from the items that were being stored in the storage facility (e.g., "of the 127 measures of aji brought for deposit, 15 are removed for the administration of the facility, leaving 112 for deposit"). Second, perhaps these addition/subtraction records were something like practice manuals for new khipu keepers (e.g., the master khipu keeper ties a cord 
319 10 109 with knot values totaling 127; he then ties the 
92 [3 cords, no value; J 10-112] 

number 15 on the adjacent cord; he then informs

the proper resulting value [ 127 15 = ?] into the

khipu UR255. In Table 1 we report sequential nu­merical values from segments of the closely matching pair UR267 A/UR255 in order to clarify the nature of the procedure in question. 
Table 2 displays a run of corresponding cords between the closely matching pair UR267B/ UR256, which contains the repeating value of 10 and a similar pattern of addition/subtraction. We should note that this closely matching pair, in (a tax on deposits) focusing on its financial sup­port, the latter (the training of accountants) on replenishing the stock of accountants at the site. At present, we have no good grounds for arguing strongly for one or the other of these suggested explanations for this unusual feature of the Inkawasi khipu corpus. 
Returning to the numerical values recorded in the two sets of linked and closely matching khipus partially reproduced in Tables 1 and 2, what can we say about these patterns? In the first place, the two pairings in the tables suggest that the two

cord keepers who kept these records were oper­ating using two different principles of numerical organization. That is, the values recorded on the linked set formed by UR267A and UR267B fol­low a pattern we characterize as x I n I y (e.g., 127 I 15 I 112), whereas those recorded on the linked set formed by UR255 and UR256 follow the pattern x Iy In (e.g., 127 I 112 I 15). The value of n is the difference between the values of x and y. These two patterns and their respective examples are shown in Table 3 for clarity. 
Our suggestion for the significance of these different numerical structures, or formulas, is that they may be two different, reciprocal ways of performing what are complementary arithmetical procedures of subtraction. For example: 127 ­
15 = 112 and 127-112=15. Thus, perhaps these 
are two strategies for ensuring the performance 
of good mathematical operations (this would al­
low one to see the error made on khipu UR267B, 
cords 98-100, which gives the erroneous calcu­
khipu UR256, cords 116-118, where we find 153 
[not 152!] -143 = 10 [see Table 2]). 
We believe that the operations that we have identified in the Inkawasi khipu accounts are sim­ilar to Robson's (l 992) principles of equality and reversibility of arithmetical operations as require­ments for affecting action at a distance, as dis­cussed above. Table 3 shows the variable yet rec­iprocal structuring of accounts in our linked khipus in two different, "reversible" modes: x In Iy (e.g., 127 I15 I112) and x I y In (e.g., 127 I 112 I 15). One can read these two differently structured formulas either from left to right (sub­tracting) or right to left (adding) and, if all is in order with the calculations, the correct arithmetic values will be maintained. 

In addition, directionality appears to be an im­portant issue in these formulas. Before indicating

how this feature appears in the two models, we note that the way the numerical values are listed in the columns of Tables 1 and 2, the attachment directions-designated in Urton's khipu nota­tional system as v ("verso") and r ("recto")-are opposed, or opposite, between khipus from each of the two linked sets (UR267 A/UR267B and UR255/UR256).3 The directional attachment val­ues ( v or r) are noted at the head of the "Cord#" columns. What this means is that the close match between UR267 A and UR255 (Table 1) occurs when the cords of the former are v-attached while those of the latter are r-attached. Similarly, the close match between UR267B and UR256 (Table 2) occurs in the sequence shown when the cords of the former are r-attached and those of the latter are v-attached. If one were to flip over one or the other of the khipus in each pair, thereby making them readable as either both v-attached or both r-attached, this would invert the entire corre­sponding number column. As a result of this "flip­ping" operation, there would no longer be an alignment of closely matching values directly across from each other, thereby preventing the efficient performance of checks-and-balances ac­counting. What may also be important about this opposition in attachment directionalities is that it provides another mechanism for checking arith­metical operations within each three-cord set of values-that is, checking a value added in one direction by subtracting that same value going in the opposite direction. 
The Possible Standardization of Accounting 
Units at lnkawasi 

We conclude that the Inkawasi khipukamayuqs had the means at hand to carry out highly efficient and effective accounting of the goods that were being brought into, stored within, and dispensed from the storage complex of Qolqawasi by means of the various accounting strategies and proce­dures discussed above. Nonetheless, there is one other important issue that we need to address concerning the nature of accounting at the site. This has to do with the possible standardization of units of accounting. We have seen above that many of the items that were kept in the storage bins (collcas) at Inkawasi were agricultural prod­ucts, items such as chili peppers, peanuts, and 
beans. These are all items that come in large num­bers of small, practically uncountable items. Be­ing accused of being a "bean-counter" (a common derogatory label applied to accountants) is one thing; actually counting every individual bean that is being stored is quite another! To date, we do not have good evidence for the standardization of shapes and sizes of ceramic vessels used for transporting, storing, and accounting for agricul­tural food products in the precolumbian Andes. (The one study on standardized vessels we are aware of-undertaken by Bray [2008]-concerns lnka aribalo, which were used for storing liquids.) The question, then, is: How were such items enu­merated and accounted at storage facilities such as Inkawasi? Chu and his team have discovered at the site evidence for what may have been a heretofore undocumented method of establishing and enumerating accounting units in a standard­ized form. This was identified in one of the two large rectangular open spaces adjacent to the kallanka structures, which we have designated as sorting/drying areas. We have suggested that these spaces may have been used for receiving 
and recording materials brought into the site for storage. 
While excavating the floor of the rectangular space designated U .A. 7 in Figure 3, Chu and his team exposed a grid-like arrangement of panels of squares laid out in the mud floor (Figure 7). The same grid pattern was found in U.A. 8; un­fortunately, these were poorly preserved because modern occupation and wind erosion had re­moved almost all of the surface of the mud floor in the latter structure. The lines forming the squares on the floor of U .A. 7 were made by im­pressing ropes into the damp mud floor. One can still view the oblique S-twist of fibers composing the ropes in the impressions. The squares all mea­sure very close to what we could term a stan­dardized measurement of 23 cm by 23 cm. 
The squares were laid out on the floor in grid panels three squares wide by 39 squares long. Each grid panel is therefore composed of 117 squares. A narrow walkway separates adjacent grid panels on the floor. We estimate that there were 30 grid panels laid out on the floor across the length of the floor of U .A. 7. This would pro­duce a total of 3 ,510 squares across the entire floor area. This arrangement was presumably re-

peated in structure U.A. 8. It should be noted that virtually the entire central section of the floor of structure U.A. 7 is sunken or eroded, effacing the grid of panel squares across that section of the floor surface. As a result, only the panels at the western and eastern ends of this rectangular space have been preserved. A schematic drawing of what is likely to have been the appearance of the entire grid-like arrangement of squares on the floor of U .A. 7 is shown in Figure 8. 
We think that the squares may have served as a standardized accounting unit measure for products-especially small agricultural produce (e.g., beans, chili peppers, peanuts)-kept in the storage chambers. Objects to be stored would have been spread out across the surface of the grids of panels. This would have provided the setting for counting the numbers of standardized units of products that were being brought into the storage facility and that would have been ac­counted for in the khipu accounts. 
We note that the grid-work floors at Inkawasi are not entirely unprecedented in coastal Inka ar­chitecture. Mackey (2006) excavated a room at the lnka administrative site of Farfan, in the Je­quetepeque Valley on the north coast of Peru, in which the floor was marked off in a grid-like array of squares. The squares were arranged in a pattern of 17 rows and 23 columns, for a total of 391 squares. Mackey interpreted the arrangement to constitute a kind of calculator, like the Inka device known as yupana ("counter; calculator").

Figure 8. Reconstruction drawing of the grid of panels of squares on the Floor of U .A. 7. 
Finding a small depression in the center of each square (which is not found in the squares at Inkawasi), Mackey suggested that counters, in the form of stones or maize kernels, could have been moved around the squares for performing calculations and that the calculated values would then have been knotted into a khipu (Mackey 2006:335). 4 
In the case of the grid-work floor at Inkawasi, 
we are more inclined to interpret this as an 
arrangement designed to allow the parceling out 
of stored produce into standardized units. Pursu­
ing this hypothesis, we suggest that accounting 
and record keeping at Inkawasi may have pro­
ceeded as follows. Items brought in to the site 
(e.g . gaefr or ceramic containers filled with 
. 
beans, chili peppers, peanuts, etc.) would have been carried in by human or camelid carriers. These would have been directed to the north end of the Qolqawasi, perhaps entering the complex along the main corridor. The objects to be stored would have been offloaded in the corridor, or perhaps inside the kallankas. The items would then have been transferred to the floor of struc­tures U.A. 7 and 8, where they would have been spread out across the panels of squares. At that point, the khipu keepers or their assistants would have made the official count of the numbers of standardized unit-squares of different products that were being introduced into the site. Those figures would then have been recorded on the khipus. The products would then have been moved to one or another of the 36 major storage bins in the center of the site. At some point, prod­ucts may have been moved from the 36 major storage bins into the arrangement of ca. 209 small, square storage bins around the west, south, and east sides of the site. The latter action would probably have been accompanied by another act of reading and adjusting the khipu records, indi­cating the movement of known quantities of goods from one area to another within the storage complex. 
Conclusions, Reflections, and Looking Forward 
It could well be said that what we have referred to here as the "archival" study of khipus is in its 
infancy. In an earlier study, Urton and Carrie J. 
Brezine (20 11) identified 12 collections of khipus with reasonably well-attested provenience, which were classified as individual archives. To date, we have studies of the Chachapoya-Inka archive found at Laguna de los C6ndores (Urton 2001, 2008b, 20 11), the archive at Puruchuco, in the Rimac Valley (Urton and Brezine 2005, 2007), the Pachacamac khipu archive (Urton 20 14), and now the Inkawasi archive. One consequence of approaching khipu studies in terms of the inves­tigation of archives is to begin to shift the focus of our conception and understanding of these de­vices away from seeing them as individual, eso­teric mathematical records to on-the-ground ad­ministrative accounts. While both views are valuable and important, the latter perspective, which was little developed until the beginning of this century, promises to provide a more direct

path to developing a clearer understanding of how institutions of the Inka state were organized, how they functioned, and what role khipu ac­counting played in them. 
In our estimation, the khipus have for far too long been relegated to a marginal role in the evo­lution of Andean cultures. This has come about by our having persistently represented these knot­ted cord devices as products of a high and esoteric mathematical practice, one which was carried out by a small intellectual elite. We think this view radically underestimates and misrepresents the place of cord keeping in the lnka world and, therefore, misses the real, on-the-ground signifi­cance of khipu record keeping and of the khipuka­mayuq officials themselves in the Inka state. That is, we argue that while the Inka troops were un­doubtedly the blunt force of the power of the Inka state, the khipukamayuqs were the individ­uals who, in the end, exercised the greatest force in establishing and maintaining lnka power throughout Tawantinsuyu. They did this by the most seemingly prosaic of acts-naming, count­ing, and recording statistics (as well as histories) in knots and colors. In the performance of these acts, carried out daily in settlements throughout the Andes, as well as in the administrative centers scattered here and there along the Inka highway from modem-day Ecuador down to central Chile, the khipukamayuqs methodically shaped and re­shaped the world inhabited by the Inkas and their subjects. 
As we intensify our studies of khipu records, especially with recent, extraordinary discoveries of large, archival collections of these devices (es­pecially at Laguna de los C6ndores and lnkawasi), we are not only beginning to sketch the outlines of the shape that was imparted to the Inka world by the administrative practices of the khipuka­mayuqs, but we are also beginning to sketch the outlines of an autochthonous "Inka history." 
What do we mean by the notion of writing Inka history on the basis of accounting documents rather than doing so on the basis of the chronicles and documents produced by European minds, motives, and recording technologies following the Spanish conquest ofTawantinsuyu? We think the material discussed herein on accounting at Inkawasi is extremely suggestive of how we might initiate such a project. For instance, we 
can now make the explicitly historical claims that: (a) high-level accounting was taking place at the site of Inkawasi in the decades before the Spanish conquest; (b) accountants at Inkawasi followed a practice of tying khipus to each other, perhaps for the purpose of aggregating into the same large account the enumeration of different products; (c) accountants commonly practiced various checks-and-balances techniques, includ­ing making copies of full khipu records as well as structuring the internal numerical records in such a way that addition and subtraction could be performed inside accounts; (d) someone-or some collective-separated sets ofkhipus,placed them on the ground, and covered them with agri­cultural produce, perhaps in acts intended to mark certain khipus as relevant for the accounting of those same products stored at the site; and (e) people at the site made grid-like markings on the floors of the "sorting" spaces, probably to estab­lish a template for standardizing accounting units for storehouse record keeping. 
The above observations, while not deeply in­formative in the terms normally associated with the writing of history (which usually focuses on such matters as great battles, the abdication of a crown by a reigning king, etc.), do nonetheless constitute historical moments, events, and actions. We might say that such accounting-based histories are more the stuff of mid-twentieth century an­nales histories-with their emphases on statistics, demography, etc.-rather than Hegelian "great man" histories. Such facts of accounting practice as those adduced above are, admittedly, a slim ledge on which to begin to build an indigenous Andean/Inka history. Nonetheless, these obser­vations represent a foot-hold (or perhaps better a toe-hold!) in that effort, one that did not exist be­fore the discovery and careful, systematic, scien­tific excavation and study of the khipu archive at Inkawasi. 
Hopefully, in the future we can build on what we have deduced above as a small set of "histor­ical" observations, drawn from lnka accounting practices at Inkawasi, in ways that will allow us to continue to construct a history of Tawantinsuyu that will be based not on the Spanish chronicles, which have all the problems that come from the interested, politically motivated construction of historical narratives by a conquering population,

but rather on the basis of the minds, calculations, observations, and experiences of the indigenous Andean record keepers-the khipukamayuqs­going about the business of state administration.

Notes 

I. Although the precise function of what we term here "sorting/drying spaces" (U .A. 7 and 8; see Figure 3) is not known, we hypothesize that these large, open rectangular spaces were the sites where produce brought to the storage fa­cility was dried out and separated into standardized accounting units. 
2. 
Hyslop does not explain how he arrived at the estimate of a storage capacity of 6,400 m3 for Qolqawasi. Nonetheless, it is important to note that he applied this figure only to the square bins that enclose the site on the east, west, and south sides. He thought that the rectangular bins at the center of the storage facility may have been used for some purpose other than storage, but he does not speculate on what that may have been (Hyslop 1985:14-17). 

3. 
Khipu cords are attached to the primary cord by means of what is known as a "half-hitch" knot. These knots are pro­duced by first opening up one end of the plied pendant string. The opposite (unopened) end of the string is then passed around the primary cord and then through the opened end of the string. The cord is then pulled taut to secure its place on the primary cord. There are two different ways of performing this operation, which Urton has (arbitrarily) designated recto 


(r) and verso (v). In the recto attachment, the cord is passed from the front over the top of the primary cord and pulled taut at the back of the primary cord; in the verso attachment, the cord is passed behind the primary cord, over the top, and pulled taut at the front of the primary cord. The recto and verso designations for any given cord attachment will be re­versed depending on the side of the khipu from which one views the attachment. 
4. It is worth noting the existence of another partitioned floor at an Inka storage site. This is the enclosed rectangular plaza with storage chambers along one of the long sides, at the south coastal site of Quebrada de la Vaca (Riddell 2007). In Urton's (1991) earlier study of this site, he suggested that the nine strips into which the plaza was divided by embedding water-polished cobbles into its floor might have been used as spaces for separating and drying the produce to be stored in the storage chambers .
