SOCIOPOLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS AND METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES 
AT COPAN, HONDURAS: A CONJUNCTIVE PERSPECTIVE 

William L. Fash and Robert J. Sharer 
Results of 16 years of archaeological research at Copan, Honduras, based on different methods and theoretical perspectives, can be used in combination to better understand the developmental trajectory of Classic period sociopolitical evolution in the Copan Valley. Although research continues, findings to date demonstrate the ad­vantage of conjunctive research that applies archaeological, epigraphic, and iconographic data in a crosscutting, self-corrective strategy. While the use of any single data set may produce incomplete or inaccurate conclusions, as in the use of settlement data alone to reconstruct Middle Classic population size and assess the developmental status of the Copan polity, more complete conclusions can be reached by applying a fuller range of data from excavations in both the valley and Acropolis of Copan's urban core, along with epigraphic and iconographic evidence. These combined data show that from its beginning in the fifth century, the Classic Copan polity was ruled by powerful kings who controlled large populations and, quite likely, an extensive territory that may have included the site of Quirigua in the Motagua Valley to the north. 
At the other end of the developmental trajectory, the combination of research findings from the Acropolis and surrounding elite residential compounds and valley settlement data, has led to a redefinition of the Classic "collapse" at Copan, now seen as a long-enduring process involving the decentralization of political authority, the end of centralized dynastic rule, and gradual depopulation of the valley. This reconstruction, in combination with evidence for the end of the Classic period at other Lowland Maya sites, supports the long-standing conclusion that there was no single cause for the collapse, but rather that a complex and long-operating series of processes was responsible for the end of lowland Classic Maya civilization.

Los resu/tados de los Ultimas dieciseis afios de investigacion en Copan han estado fundados en perspectivas diferentes tanto de metodolog(a como de teor(a. No obstante, pueden ser usados conjuntamente para otorgar una mayor comprension de la trayectoria de la evolucion sociopolitica en el valle de Copan durante el periodo Clasico. Aunque las investigaciones contint1.an, los resultados obtenidos hasta la fecha demuestran las ventajas de inves­tigaciones conjuntas que aplican datos arqueologicos, epigraficos, e iconograficos en una estrategia que cruza las limitaciones disciplinarias y permite la autocorreccion.

Over a century of research at Copan, Honduras, has yielded a large corpus of data spanning a sequence of more than 2,000 years of Precolumbian occupation (Early Preclassic to Postclassic). The culmination of this occupation was during the Classic period (locally ca. A.D. 200-900) when Copan developed the economic, social, political, and ideological dimensions of a complex state organization (Fash 1988). The Copan data have an important bearing on central issues of concern to archaeologists, including the origins and demise of complex sociopolitical systems. In this paper we address both of these questions from the perspective of Copan, especially methodological issues raised by attempts to acquire and interpret archaeological data relevant to understanding the rise and fall of complex societies. 
After a brief summary of research at Copan, we review the overall strategy of a conjunctive methodology and the advantages of combining prehistoric and historic data sets as they are applied at Copan. Then we examine two specific questions addressed by research in both the valley settlement and the urban core of Copan: the origins and demise of the Classic period polity. 
To do this we draw on results gained by prior and completed research, as well as our own continuing investigations. Because our work is not yet completed, we cannot yet propose final answers to these questions. Rather, we offer an interim evaluation of the results gained thus far and the gaps that still remain. In this way we hope that future research, both at Copan and elsewhere, may benefit from the lessons learned, and obtain a clearer definition of the problems encountered and the kinds of research needed for their solution. 
In the course of this review we hope to make clear that none of the past or present research programs by themselves are adequate to provide a final understanding of the origins and demise of the Classic Maya polity at Copan. While each has made important contributions to resolving these questions, it is only by combining the results of all relevant research at Copan that we can approach comprehensive answers. Thus, for example, we point out that the recent settlement research con­ducted by our colleagues from The Pennsylvania State University (Webster and Freter l 990a), while providing a comprehensive view of Late Classic occupation in the Copan valley, has very likely underestimated the size of Middle Classic (ca. A.D. 400-650) populations in the same region. By looking at Middle Classic developments from a rural-settlement perspective, rather than holistically by including the urban core data, they have also misjudged the timing and significance of the origins of the Classic Copan polity. At the other end of the spectrum, we hope a summary of all relevant evidence bearing on the end of the Classic at Copan, including the important new findings from the same recent valley research (Webster and Freter 1990a) will further clarify the much-remarked-on issue of the Classic Maya "collapse." 
SUMMARY OF RESEARCH AT COPAN 
The origins of research at Copan date to the nineteenth century, with the first excavations con­ducted in what is now recognized as the Classic period urban core, or Principal Group (Figure l): the Acropolis, adjacent Great Plaza, and the surrounding concentration of masonry architectural remains (Gordon 1896; Maudslay 1889-1902). The chief concerns of this work, and the subsequent Carnegie Institution of Washington investigations in the first half of this century (Stromsvik 1942; Trik 1939), centered on chronology and determining the beginning and end of Classic period occupation at Copan. But not all this early effort was devoted to the urban core. The first attempts at reconstructing settlement history in the Copan Valley (Figure 2) were those of Sylvanus Morley, who explored many sites in the valley in search of inscriptions for inclusion in his monograph, The Inscriptions at Copan (Morley 1920). Morley was the first to propose the intrusion of a Maya elite into the valley in the Early Classic and to note the impressive array of early dates (9.1.10.0.0 through 
9.9.0.0.0 or A.D. 465-613) found in the locus presently occupied by the modern village of Copan

("Group 9"). Since there were at that time no monuments of comparable age known from the Principal Group of ruins, Morley concluded that Group 9 had been the primary locus of settlement and political power in the valley, and that later on (after 9.9.0.0.0 or A.O. 613) the area occupied by the Principal Group became important. 
Morley's ideas on the intrusion of a Maya elite group into the Copan Valley during the Early Classic were seconded by John Longyear as a result of his subsequent studies of Copan's ceramics (Longyear 1952:67-72). In Longyear's view, after the arrival of the ruling elite from the central Maya Lowlands, life's pace quickened for the native peoples of the valley and "work began in earnest." There was a slow buildup of construction in the Principal Group during the Early Classic, with increasing activity toward the end of the period. Finally, during the Full (Late) Classic, Copan's Acropolis began to assume its final form, and the "last half-century of this period witnessed the full flowering of the Principal (Group). During this comparatively brief span of years the great Hiero­glyphic Stairway and Temples 26, 11, and 22, all magnificently embellished, were finished" (Longyear 1952:70). For the Postclassic period, Longyear (1952:71) concluded that "The Maya hierarchic cult left Copan as it came-suddenly and unobtrusively. At the very height of its glory, the Acropolis, together with its outlying groups, was abandoned by the priests and craftsmen, and most of the common people also moved away from the built-up areas, probably to the refuge of the surrounding hills." Further, he states "There was nothing now, to keep the people in the valley, and absence of post-Classic occupational debris in the vicinity of the Acropolis indicates that they quickly moved out, possibly to the foothills" (Longyear 1952:71). Here Longyear does not specify whether "the valley" refers to only the alluvial bottomlands adjacent to the Principal Group, or the larger area defined by later researchers as the Copan pocket. 
Regarding the dating of the Late Classic period, Longyear (1952:74) notes "The beginning of the Full Classic Period, as shown above, can only approximately be placed in time. The end, however, is fairly definite. The last dated monument at Copan (Sculpture Gl) was erected in 9.18.10.0.0 
(A.O. 800), and shortly after that the Acropolis and other groups in the valley appear to have been

deserted by their priestly rulers." Finally, for the last occupations of the Copan Valley, Longyear 
(1952:75) states that "There app(tars to be a considerable hiatus between the Full Classic and post­
Classic periods. This is indicated by the complete lack of post-Classic deposits in the numerous 
tests and trenches dug in the vicinity of the Acropolis. The Copanecos seem to have moved away 
from this area following the exodus of the priests; when they next returned, it was at a considerably 
later date." Given the archaeological evidence available to him, and the then-current models of 
ancient Maya society, Longyear's interpretations made a great deal of sense. 
Modern archaeological research at Copan has involved a series of separate but complementary projects that have spanned the past 15 years. These investigations began with Gordon Willey's Copan Valley Project (1975-1977), marking the first in a series of programs dedicated to delineating settlement patterning and settlement change in the Copan Valley (Fash 1986a; Willey and Leventhal 1979; Willey et al. 1978). This work produced the basic settlement typology for the valley used by all subsequent investigators, and together with subsequent research, outlined the basic ceramic chronology, including an Early Classic Bijac ceramic complex (ca. A.D. 100-400), a Middle Classic Acbi ceramic complex (ca. A.D. 400-650), and a Late Classic Coner ceramic complex (ca. A.D. 650-850). The Copan Valley Project was followed by the first phase (1978-1980) of the Proyecto Arqueologico Copan (hereafter PAC I), sponsored by the Government of Honduras and directed by Claude Baudez, which continued settlement research in the valley, stressing vacant-space testing and collection of data from all periods of occupation, and which opened investigations in the Principal Group (Baudez 1983). The valley-settlement work was carried on during the second phase of this government-sponsored project (PAC II: 1980-1985), directed by William Sanders (1986), with David Webster as codirector, which focused on the valley's Late Classic occupation and environment. After the end of PAC II, this settlement research continued until 1988 under the direction of Sanders and Webster (1989; Webster and Freter 1990a, 1990b; Webster and Gonlin 1988). Since 1985 two new projects have continued investigations in the Principal Group: the Copan Mosaics Project and the Copan Acropolis Archaeological Project, both directed by William Fash (see Fash 1988), the latter being a multi-institutional effort codirected by Ricardo Agurcia, Robert Sharer, Rudy Larios, and E. Wyllys Andrews (Fash 1989; Sharer et al. 1989). Work has continued in the surrounding "residential" zones as well, with the North Group Project from Rutgers Uni­versity, directed by Wendy Ashmore, excavating Groups 8L-10 through 12, (see Ashmore 1989), and Pennsylvania State University programs continuing at Groups 1 OE-6 and 11E-7 (Whittington and Zeleznik 1990) and Group 8N-11 (directed by David Webster). 
THE CONJUNCTIVE METHODOLOGY AT COPAN 
These investigations have been implemented by a number of different research strategies, based on alternative theoretical perspectives, and have produced vast amounts of data. But while each has been designed to address specific and important questions, no single program can hope to provide a definitive answer to the largest and most enduring of research problems facing Maya archaeologists: the origins and demise of Classic civilization. To begin to attack these questions, many Maya scholars over the past decade have called for a multidisciplinary or "conjunctive" strategy beginning from the perspective of individual Classic Maya polities (Marcus 1983; Sharer 1978). The longest-running and most comprehensive example of such conjunctive research has taken place at Copan, where the reconstruction of local sociopolitical development is being accom­plished by a combination of archaeological, epigraphic, and iconographic investigations in a cross­cutting, self-correcting strategy. In this effort, all forms of relevant evidence, including the results of past and present settlement and population research, are welcome in order to refine and improve our understanding of ancient Copan. 
Obviously the utility and success of the conjunctive strategy relies on the unique richness of the Classic Maya historical record, allowing the back and forth testing of conclusions between textual and archaeological sources. Yet some archaeologists continue to treat Classic Maya research as "prehistoric." To do so implicitly ignores advances in textual decipherment and the significant results obtained from a conjunctive methodology that combines archaeology, history, and other

relevant disciplines. We acknowledge that the study of much of the nonelite realm of the Classic Maya, including the Copan Valley settlement, is strictly speaking "prehistoric" (Webster and Freter l 990a:66), given the absence of evidence for writing directly associated with most, but not all (see Ashmore 1989; Webster 1989), of the settlement sample. But viewed holistically, the settlements of the Copan Valley were for at least 400 years part of a larger and partially literate society. By including data derived from the historical texts on monuments and architecture at Copan (admittedly only a pale reflection of the corpus that must have existed in more perishable media) and testing these findings by archaeological investigations, the Copan research can proceed on a more complete level of understanding than would have been possible without the existence of inscriptions and pictorial sculpture. 
While we certainly agree that the study of settlement systems currently provides the "most powerful information available to archaeologists for reconstruction of prehistoric institutions and popula­tions" (Webster and Freter l 990a:66), research at Copan benefits from a broad spectrum of data, including that gained from both prehistoric and historic disciplines. As all Mayanists know, historical and iconographic evidence often provide the most explicit information about the upper echelons of society. The historical sources record interpolity social and political matters, including warfare, alliances, marriages, and visitations. Within a polity such as Copan, these record specific political and religious offices, the names and titles of individuals who held them, dates of monuments and events in the lives of prominent individuals, kinship relationships, the dates, and even the names and functions of specific buildings (see below)-altogether far more than we could ever hope to obtain from the archaeological study of a prehistoric community alone. We see these historical data not as mere ideographic details, but as providing a variety of anthropological implications subject to archaeological testing. 
A current example of the significant results realized from feedback between the study of the written and iconographic records and material archaeological remains is the work on Acropolis Str. 10L­22A, recently identified as the community house of eighth-century Copan (Fash and Fash 1990: 32). Specialists in archaeology, architectural restoration, art, and epigraphy working together were able to expose, identify, and rearticulate the fallen sculptures and glyphs from this building. These include 10 large mat designs that identify the structure as the popol na (glossed as "community house" or "council house" in sixteenth-and seventeenth-century Maya documents). It also is adorned by "9 Ahau" glyphs that probably date the building to the period ending 9.15.15.0.0 9 Ahau 18 Xul (A.O. 746), Ahaulil glyphs ("governance," "act of governing," or "kingdom"), and eight large hieroglyphs placed on the comers and three sides of the building, which have been identified as local place names. In addition, cross-legged seated human figures with distinctive chest and headdress adornments sat in niches above the hieroglyphs; these are probably the portraits of officials who represented the places or Copan Valley lineages that had a voice in the political deliberations that took place in the council house. 
These iconographic and epigraphic findings are reinforced by other lines of evidence. The archi­tecture of Str. 10L-22A is consistent with an inferred function of a council house, given features unlike any other known building in the Acropolis (multiple doorways that lead to a back room with elevated space for a large number of individuals). According to sixteenth-and seventeenth-century sources, the popol na were used not only for important political deliberations, but also for periodic feasts and for instruction in ritual dances (these same functions continue at present day popo/ na in rural Quintana Roo, Mexico [Nikolai Grube, personal communication 1990]). In addition, results of archaeological excavations offer further support from a large midden deposit uncovered just outside the southwest comer of the building. The ceramics from the Str. 10L-22A midden included both serving vessels and cooking pots, and use-wear analysis of the lithic artifacts by Kazuo Aoyama reveals that the majority of the obsidian tools had been used for cutting meat or hide. The ceramics and lithics associated with this building thus provide evidence for food preparation and serving on a large scale, fully in keeping with the historical and ethnographic evidence. Finally, there is a large (8.5-x-32 m) low masonry platform directly south of Str. 10L-22A, which has been interpreted as the setting for ritual dances (Fash et al. 1990). 
This example of conjunctive research has greatly expanded our knowledge of the past by dating

and identifying the probable function of a specific building, and thereby providing new information on sociopolitical organization and offices that can be further tested by archaeological research. For example, one hypothesis derived from this work is that the Late Classic subdivisions (or paramount­lineage compounds) of the Copan Valley were given specific names. This should be testable through excavation of valley residential groups to see if the same name glyphs found on Str. 10L-22A can be identified in hieroglyphic inscriptions in these valley sites. Importantly, this example demonstrates how various components of current Copan research-archaeology (including settlement studies), epigraphy, iconography, and architectural restoration-in combination can provide much more information than any single discipline could provide in isolation. 
The associations of architecture, texts, and iconography encountered at Copan provide powerful information on questions of history and institutional structure. This has been demonstrated re­peatedly in the Acropolis research (Fash 1989; Sharer et al. 1989, 1990), and was amply documented in the work on Str. 9N-82 (Fash 1986b; Webster 1989; Webster et al. 1986). Regarding this latter work, Webster (1989:106) notes that: 
If we had only the results of our surveys and excavations and no texts of any kind, we probably would be able to generate and confirm the same basic model of the place of the House of the Bacabs [Str. 9N-82] in the larger Maya sociopolitical system at Copan. We would lack, however, the precision and independent confirmation of chronology derived from inscriptions, as well as detailed insights into the way elite individuals related to the royal establishment and to each other. And we would certainly have a much poorer concept of how such elites manipulated ritual and ideology to legitimize and reinforce their positions and vie for authority and power. 
THE ORIGINS OF THE CLASSIC POLITY AT COPAN 
We have already mentioned the ideas advanced by early investigators such as Morley and Longyear that the Classic polity at Copan began with colonization by an elite group from the central lowlands. This issue is being attacked by continuing excavations in the Copan Acropolis aimed at revealing the very origins and initial development of this complex associated with the ruling dynasty, but more research will be needed before we can fully evaluate the Morley and Longyear proposition. In the meantime, sufficient data exist bearing on the size and organization of the Early and Middle Classic polity to examine these questions more closely. The size and nature of the early Copan polity has been the subject of two different reconstructions, one based on settlement data from the most recent valley research (Webster and Freter 1990a), the other based on a conjunctive approach using data from both settlement and urban-core data (Fash 1989; Sharer et al. 1989, 1990). In essence this debate has centered on the size of populations in the Copan Valley during the Middle Classic Acbi phase (ca. A.D. 400-650), the historical reality of the first 11 Copan rulers recorded in Copan's texts, and the scale of constructions in the Acropolis associated with these initial rulers (contemporary with the Acbi ceramic complex). 
Copan Valley Research: Sampling Issues and Population Size in the Middle Classic 
The past 16 years of settlement research in the Copan valley have demonstrated that most cases of pre-Coner (before ca. A.D. 650) occupation are deeply buried and difficult to reach (see below). "At Copan ... where earlier phase materials are represented poorly and are difficult to sample, and where Coner materials are so dominant, understanding the dynamics of the Coner phase settlement system is essential" (Webster and Freter 1990a:69). While it may be true that understanding the "dominant" is "essential," we believe that understanding the less dominant and more elusive earlier settlement remains is also critical if we are to discern the overall evolution of a society and the settlement systems it used over time. 
The sample reported by Webster and Freter ( l 990a:7 3) included sites from all settlement categories (Types 1-4) with a clear preference for small surface sites: "We have long felt that small sites, and particularly small residential sites, provide more reliable data on settlement trends than large ones for several reasons: occupations are usually shorter, stratigraphy is simpler, introduction of extra-

neous materials is less of a problem, and most important, representative sampling is accomplished more easily." While this may well be true, it is also true that because Webster and Freter's survey and excavations were confined to sites with surface manifestations (mounds, artifact scatters, and other visible features), the information obtained from those investigations would pertain almost exclusively to the Coner phase. As they note, "during the Willey-Baudez phases of research it was recognized correctly that the overwhelming majority of sites located on the surface and/or tested by excavation was associated with Coner phase pottery, an impression confirmed by all subsequent work since 1980" (Webster and Freter 1990a:69). Thus, while the results they obtained may be valid for the Late Classic Coner occupation, they may not be necessarily representative in an analysis of the pre-Coner phase settlement history of Copan. 
This very question of "representativeness" was one which vexed all those who contributed to the valley excavation program during the first phase of the PAC. By that time, it was fairly clear from the test pitting and horizontal excavations conducted in the bottomlands and foothills north of the river as part of Willey's project that the visible sites in the pocket dated to Longyear's "Full Classic" period. Baudez was not convinced that sampling visible architecture was necessarily the correct way to obtain information on the overall settlement history in the valley, particularly for the earlier periods. It had become obvious that because of postabandonment soil deposition, surface sherds in the Copan Valley are fairly scarce (unlike the situation found in many upland areas in Mesoam­erica), and that sherds and other artifacts from the earlier phases were particularly unlikely to appear on the surface. As such, Baudez insisted that equal attention be given to areas between visible sites for sampling the different physiographic zones identified in the valley by B. L. Turner II and his colleagues (Turner et al. 1983). 
The varied and different sampling strategies employed at Baudez's behest attempted to produce an unbiased, representative sample of the settlement history of the Copan pocket, and did succeed at finding considerable evidence for pre-Coner occupations in the alluvial bottomlands, and to a lesser extent, in the piedmont and high river terraces (Fash 1983a, 1986a). The PAC I excavations revealed evidence of settlement back to Middle Preclassic times in the bottomlands of the Copan pocket, use of the foothill zones during the Middle Preclassic and Early Classic, and settlements in the foothills during the Acbi phase (Middle Classic). The area of the modem village (Morley's Group 9) did contain structures and associated Bijac and Acbi ceramics (Early and Middle Classic), verifying that this was an important settlement locus throughout Copan's Classic period history. The discovery of fifth-and sixth-century inscribed monuments in Str. 4 of the Principal Group (Cheek and Milla 1983), however, was the first indication that Morley's idea that Group 9 was the original center of power in the valley would have to be revised. Rene Viel discovered that the large, defensible hilltop site of Cerro de las Mesas (located 1 km north of Group 9) was founded in the late Bijac or early Acbi phase and contained significant terrace and other constructions dating to the Acbi phase (Fash 1983a:266-278). 
Of further interest, there were great numbers of sites in the Copan Valley buried by the posta­bandonment sheet wash (in the foothills and upper slopes) and alluvium/colluvium (in the bottom­lands) found in the areas between (and in some cases beneath) the visible surface sites. Two meters or more of soil covered Coner phase sites such as Group 1 OJ-1 in the foothills north of the Principal Group, and Group 9M-13 in the bottomlands (recently reinvestigated by Webster; Figure 3), so one might expect buried pre-Coner phase materials in such contexts as well. Given the considerable amounts of land found between most visible sites in all but the dense settlement within a l km radius of the Principal Group, and especially in the rural sectors of the valley, it should also be expected that some of those considerable expanses might show traces of earlier settlements. In this regard, it is worth noting that with the exception of Cerro de las Mesas and the other large architectural compounds in the eastern part of the valley, virtually the only loci that produced evidence for occupations earlier than the Coner phase were those between the visible mounds and mound groups. As detailed below, the amount of labor represented by the monumental constructions spanning the entire Acbi phase in the Copan Acropolis is such that a sizable population must have lived in close proximity to the Principal Group, as had been indicated by the PAC I samples. 
In the more than 700 individual loci tested in the PAC I valley research, in an area of approximately

Figure 3. View of the excavation of Group 9M-13 showing depth of overburden covering Coner phase con­struction in the bottomlands of the Copan Valley. 
30 km2, it was found that excavations conducted away from visible architecture were more likely to produce ceramics and features from the pre-Coner phases than those conducted behind structures. Figure 4 shows how this pattern holds for the Bijac phase (ca. A.D. 100-400), and Figure 5 shows that the same holds true for the Ac bi phase (ca. A.D. 400-650). None of the pits in back of structures or tests of plazas of large visible groups in the foothills and upper slopes show evidence for Bijac phase occupations or land use. On the other hand, sampling in areas between visible sites did pick up evidence of Early Classic activities, and in some cases, residential architecture. Similarly, in the alluvial bottomlands in the east end of the Copan pocket, the pits in back of structures did not pick up much evidence for Bijac or Acbi occupation, but the large visible sites did, as did the samples from between visible sites. Testing of the large sites did recover ceramics from the Acbi phase in

In his consideration of PAC I samples, Fash (1983a, 1986a) noted that although the random samples of the different physiographic zones in the valley were unbiased and were thus "represen­tative" in that sense, nonetheless they constituted an extremely small sample of the space that was available for Precolumbian settlement. In fact, it was acknowledged that the small size of the sample as a proportion of the overall space under study rendered it insignificant in terms of statistical probability theory (Fash 1983a:429). However, the number of independent cases of settlement loci studied (slightly over 700) was sufficient to produce consistent patterns in the data, based on a series of different sampling sampling strategies (test pits in back of mounds, testing large mound sites, and random and purposive sampling of areas between visible sites). Those patterns were: (1) visible surface archaeological features date to the Coner phase; (2) extensive overburden exists on Coner phase remains, but is especially heavy on pre-Coner phase deposits; (3) pre-Coner phase remains are found in great abundance in the undisturbed sections of the bottomlands of the eastern Copan pocket; (4) extensive destruction of bottomlands tracts occurred in both the eastern and western Copan pockets (the destructive force of the Copan River being most obvious in the famous corte of the Acropolis), eliminating any Precolumbian settlement evidence which might have existed in those areas; (5) evidence of occupation of the foothills north of the river exists for the Acbi (Middle Classic) phase, along with land use and probable occupation for the earlier Bijac (Early Classic) and Uir (Middle Preclassic) phases as well; and (6) evidence of use and occupation of the often extensive "vacant" areas between visible sites in both the bottomlands and foothill zones of the Copan pocket exists for both the Coner and pre-Coner phases. 
Given these data and patterns, it is not particularly surprising that little, if anything, in the way of pre-Coner settlements was detected by the PAC II valley research (approximately 700 test pits were excavated in a 135-km2 area, predominantly though not exclusively in back of structures and in the plazas of small, visible sites; of these some 200 pits produced obsidian-hydration dates; see Freter [1988)). This recent research tested 14 percent of the known sites, yielding a sample that is probably adequate for studying the visible Coner phase settlement in the Copan region. What is most important to consider, however, is that this sample does not represent a 14 percent sample of the settlement data for the total space available for occupation during, or prior to, the Coner phase, when the visible sites in the rural areas of the valley occupy an exceedingly small proportion of the available land in all sectors. We find it unconvincing to claim simply that earlier occupation is unlikely in other locations because the visible Coner period rural sites occupy the most "attractive" topographic settings (Webster and Freter 1990a:79). Thus, the sparseness of Acbi period materials in their sample (18 of 200 obsidian-dated sites or 9 percent) is used to support the claim that pre­Coner populations were "very small," or "at most 4,000-5,000 people" at A.O. 600 (Webster and Freter 1990a:79, 81). But the adequacy of the sample based on surface sites (and ignoring intersite areas) is belied by the PAC I findings of deeply buried pre-Coner materials and both Coner and pre-Coner remains in areas between visible sites. 
A second problem with dating valley occupation from the available site sample is that the amount of excavation (generally two test pits per site) may be not be sufficient to rule out evidence of pre­Coner occupation in many surface sites-the possibility for deeply buried earlier occupation should be left open at least until more extensive excavations are undertaken. As a case in point, evidence for pre-Coner occupation of Group 8L-12 was not revealed to its investigators until after two seasons of excavations (Ashmore 1989:8). Before this work test pits placed in Group 8L-12 by the Harvard Project in 1977 indicated only a Coner phase occupation. Given the depth of most pre-Coner remains, these kinds of results are not surprising, and should be familiar to specialists acquainted with the history of sampling strategies in archaeology; for example it should be recalled that even a 50 percent coverage of a .224-ha site by test pits may not yield representative results (Cowgill 1975:266). 
With regard to their sample and its representativeness, Webster and Freter (1990a:73) state that "The small sites of Type 1 rank and lower provide the most valid reflection of settlement trends at

Copan, except for settlement in the restricted zone of the valley floor of the Copan pocket." But the exception they cite in this statement eliminates the very area that has been known since 1980 to have had the longest settlement history and densest population concentration, along with the richest alluvial soils in the valley. This area was settled by ca. 1000 B.C. and was continuously occupied and built up until the political collapse and beyond. 
On the basis of all the settlement research conducted in the Copan Valley thus far, we conclude that human settlements began to be nucleated in the Copan pocket in the fourth century A.D. if not earlier. The nucleation process began in modest fashion in the Bijac phase (Early Classic) and then accelerated during the succeeding Acbi phase (Middle Classic), still concentrated in the alluvial bottomlands adjacent to the Principal Group, but beginning to expand to the foothills. The occu­pations at the hilltop site of Cerro de las Mesas and at Morley's Group 9 (which possessed inscribed monuments implying administrative functions as well) show that there were at least two significant settlements outside of the valley bottomlands by early Acbi times as well. Recent salvage excavations in the Barrio Buenavista area of the modem village conducted by Joseph Galloy under the direction of Agurcia and Fash encountered additional Bijac and Acbi phase pottery, and future investigations at this locus contemplated by the Instituto Hondureiio de Antropologia e Historia (IHAH) will undoubtedly permit a better understanding of Early and Middle Classic occupation in this zone. 
In the meantime, though the evidence for a dense nucleated population in the valley bottomlands and settlement of the modem village area and Cerro de las Mesas in the foothills during the Acbi phase implies an expanding settlement system, we cannot claim that the picture of pre-Coner occupation of the Copan Valley is clear. To resolve the question of the density and distribution of Ac bi (and earlier) phase settlements outside the urban core of Copan, much larger samples of the available habitation space would be necessary, using a combination of probabilistic and purposive sampling. What we wish to clarify is that it cannot yet be demonstrated that all available space in the rural areas was uninhabitated or only sparsely occupied in Acbi times, given that such claims

are based on a small sample of visible sites (Webster and Freter l 990a:79), and thus represent a very small proportion of the landscape available for occupation. 
The cautionary tale provided here is that the sampling of surface sites does not necessarily provide a representative picture of overall settlement or population history. As a corollary, caution should be exercised in using the results of such surface site studies to model land-use and settlement patterns of areas between (and beneath) visible sites, particularly in areas such as the Copan Valley where ceramics and architecture from earlier phases are not always represented on the surface. 
Copan Acropolis Research: Development and Size of the Early Copan Polity 
Findings from the recent settlement research have been used to draw conclusions about the nature and development of the Copan polity (Webster and Freter 1990a:81-82). Again, however, this has been done without reference to other sources of relevant evidence. Somewhat ironically, the results of the PAC II work are projected backward in time, to the earlier occupations, events, and settlement history of the Copan Valley that were apparently beyond the goals of these investigations (Webster and Freter 1990a:69). In regard to the pre-Coner phase Copan polity, and its settlement history, Webster and Freter (1990a:82) state: 
Our guess is that the later Acbi pocket population was probably as low as 2,000-3,000 people. Given these figures, as well as the apparent limited architectural activity at the Principal Group before this time, the roles of the 11 putative "kings" in the dynastic sequence preceding the twelfth ruler, Smoke Jaguar, become exceedingly problematical. If these recorded rulers were real persons, and if they were actually predecessors or ancestors of Smoke Jaguar and his successors at Copan (as opposed to other Maya centers to which the Copan dynasty traced its origins), then they ruled over a very small-scale polity both in terms of subjects and territory. 
The basis for concluding that there was limited architectural activity in the Principal Group before the twelfth ruler (who came to the throne in A.D. 628) is not given, nor is the implicit questioning of the "reality" of the existence of the 11 "putative" rulers preceding Smoke Jaguar explained. These assumptions do support the conclusion that Copan had a single 200-year pulse of sociopolitical and demographic florescence in the Late Classic, beginning with the reign of Smoke Jaguar, as Webster and Freter state (1990a:82). Although such a conclusion ignores the evidence for important Middle Preclassic sociopolitical evolution at Copan (Fash 1988), of more direct concern here, it also ignores the evidence for the crucial development of the Copan polity in the Acbi period (ca. A.D. 400­650). Ongoing research and the previously cited data bearing on pre-Coner settlement produced by pre-PAC II valley test probes and excavations contradict these conclusions by indicating that there was a well-developed and powerful polity at Copan during Acbi times, ruled by "kings" every bit as real as Smoke Jaguar. We note that Webster and Sanders have suggested shifting the obsidian sequence back 50 years, so that the Coner period would begin at ca. A.D. 600, to provide enough time "for the extraordinarily rapid increase of the early Coner population" (Webster and Freter 1990a:80). We suggest that recognition of the importance of pre-Coner sociopolitical developments, including the sizable populations inhabiting the Copan Valley during this period, make such "ad­justments" unnecessary. 
Both previous work in the Principal Group (Becker 1983; Cheek 1986; Guillemin 1978) and current excavations in the Copan Acropolis, controlled by the well-defined architectural stratigraphy revealed in the famous corte, or Copan River cut (Sharer et al. 1989, 1990), provide the basis for important inferences about the timing and scale of activities controlled by the earliest of Copan's rulers. While most of the basic sources outlining the scale, timing, and events associated with the early Acropolis were at least potentially available to Webster and Freter (l 990a), including those by Becker (1983), Cheek (1983), Fash (1988, 1989), Guillemin (1978), and Sharer et al. (1989), we recognize that some of the results summarized here have come to light since the publication of their article. 
Excavations have documented the construction sequence underlying the eastern half of the Acrop­olis (Figure 1), including Str. lOL-16, Str. lOL-26, and the entire East Court (Str. lOL-22 and adjacent buildings). Temporal control is secured by a combination of stratigraphy, chronometric

assessments, associations with ceramics and other artifacts, and newly discovered inscriptions with Maya calendric dates. Although more work remains to be done and our conclusions are necessarily provisional, it is now apparent that Acropolis construction began around A.D. 400 with the raising of a series of monumental platforms and buildings that covered earlier smaller-scale constructions. These monumental constructions probably represent the first royal administrative, residential, and ritual complex at this locus, as indicated by the scale and elaboration of architecture and associated epigraphic and iconographic features. 
Far from representing "limited architectural activity," the overall size of this initial version of the Acropolis ("Phase" 4, ca. A.D. 400-500) appears to have covered about the same area as all subsequent versions ("Phases" 3-1, ca. A.D. 500-800). Excavations to date have revealed that the north-south extent of the Middle Classic Acropolis was about the same as it was at the end of dynastic rule ("Phase" 1, ca. A.D. 700-800), i.e., about 225 m long. The largest single Phase 4 platform exposed thus far, given the field name "Amarillo," measures some 70 m north-south by 68 m east-west by 6 m in height, and once covered the bulk of the southeast quadrant of the Acropolis (its full eastward extent may never be known, due to destruction by the Copan River). A platform of equivalent height, dating to this same initial period, has been found to the west of Amarillo, but its overall size and extent have yet to be traced. North of Amarillo, a lower platform supported a large complex of multiroomed (unvaulted) masonry administrative/residential type buildings, underlying the northeast quadrant of the Acropolis. Excavation has defined eight of these structures thus far, arranged around an east-west alignment of three courts (the only adequately exposed example, Court B, measures ca. 25 m north-south by 50 m east-west). The exteriors of these northern buildings were decorated with elaborately modeled and painted stucco reliefs (now destroyed), and at least one interior painted hieroglyphic text. While these results are preliminary and will surely be refined by work in subsequent field seasons, they are already sufficient to contradict the claim of "limited architectural activity" associated with the early Classic Copan rulers, as advanced by Webster and Freter (1990a:82). 
The size and elaboration of this initial Acropolis complex seems to us to reflect the power of a very real political authority at Copan during the very period that the inscriptions tell of the founding of the royal dynasty and the reigns of the first kings. In fact, if we use the Ac bi period population estimates given by Webster and Freter (1990a:81-82), when the scale of Acropolis construction is compared to population size estimates (as a rough measure of available labor resources) it would appear that the "putative" earliest kings of Copan relied on a labor pool only about 20 percent the size of the labor force available to the latest kings (based on their estimates of 4,000-5,000 total population at A.D. 600, vs. 15,000-20,000 total population for A.D. 750-800), yet as we have noted above, it appears that the overall scale of the later versions of the Acropolis was not significantly greater than the earliest. Thus, if the pre-Coner population was as low as Webster and Freter estimate, then the earliest Copan kings must have controlled a far greater proportion of the available human energy than did the later kings, at least as reflected in the labor needed to construct and maintain the Acropolis. This would imply that in a proportional sense, the twelfth ruler, Smoke Jaguar (or Smoke-Imix-God K), actually possessed less power and controlled fewer resources than his pred­ecessors, rather than being responsible for centralizing and augmenting royal authority, as other lines of evidence had previously indicated. It should be added that once our excavations are complete we should be able to make more detailed estimates of the energy requirements for each Acropolis construction episode, just as one study has already done for a single Phase 1 building, Str. lOL-22 (Abrams 1987). 
The more likely alternative, it seems to us, is that for reasons discussed previously, the earliest Copan rulers actually controlled far larger numbers of people than allowed by the population estimates for the Acbi period given by Webster and Freter (1990a:81): 2,000-3,000 for the Copan pocket and 4,000-5,000 total valley population at the end of Acbi times (ca. A.D. 600). A more realistic population estimate for the Acbi period (ca. A.D. 400-650), taking into account the evidence for deeply buried settlement remains in the Copan pocket, might be on the order of 8,000-10,000. A population at this level, or even assuming a slightly lower figure for the early Acbi period, seems

more consistent with the earliest monumental constructions corresponding to Acropolis phase 4 of ca. A.D. 400-500. 
These findings from beneath the East Court are reinforced by contemporaneous activity elsewhere in the Acropolis. Excavations inside the pyramidal substructure of Str. lOL-26 (the final phase of which bears the Hieroglyphic Stairway) have revealed a number of earlier buildings that can be directly tied into the overall Acropolis sequence devised by Sharer and his colleagues. One of these, constructed during the same initial Acropolis period (Phase 4, ca. A.D. 400-500), and given the field name "Papagayo," contains Stela 63 erected inside this building by the third ruler, in honor of the founder of the Copan dynasty. The founder, whose glyphic name reads K'inich Yax K'uk Mo', is cited on Stela 63 as having performed an important ceremony on the period ending date 
9.0.0.0.0 (A.D. 435). This date and his name also occur on later Coner phase inscribed monuments, indicating that this action continued to be considered important far after its first known recording on Stela 63. The fourth ruler, Cu-Ix, placed a new floor inside Papagayo at the same time he commemorated a hieroglyphic step at the base of Stela 63. To the east of Papagayo structure and its associated platform is an earlier, very large platform which in all likelihood is the work of either the first or second recorded Copan ruler. Still earlier masonry constructions buried beneath this platform are stratigraphically linked to Bancourt I, dated to the mid-fourth century by Cheek (1983). Thus archaeological, as well as epigraphic, evidence exists for important activities for the first, third, and fourth rulers. What is even more intriguing is that there is sophisticated architecture (including Ballcourt I) in the same area that probably predates the reign of the later-acknowledged dynastic founder. Thus, archaeological evidence indicates that other individuals of notable social and political stature preceeded Yax K'uk Mo', just as has been proposed on the basis of a few very fragmentary textual references, such as Copan Stela 24 (Stuart 1989). 
Given the growing body of evidence from the Acropolis, it appears to us that the initial Copan kings were not only very real individuals, but were basically indistinguishable from their Late Classic heirs except by their earlier date of rule, which makes it more difficult to recover the remains of their activities. As a final comment on the reality of these initial rulers and the size of the polity they controlled, we note that a recent reinterpretation of the text on the second-earliest dated stela at Quirigua (Monument 26 at ca. A.D. 493; see Ashmore [1980]; Jones [1983]) argues that rather than referring to the third and fourth rulers of Quirigua, as originally assumed, the inscription refers to the third and fourth kings of Copan (Schele 1990). This evidence raises the intriguing possibility that far from being a "very small-scale polity both in terms of subjects and territory" (Webster and Freter l 990a:82), Copan controlled Quirigua and its resources from the very beginning of its political history, rather than as a result of Late Classic expansion as formerly thought (Sharer 1990: 106). Although this latest clue from Quirigua has yet to be investigated further, it raises the very real possibility that Middle Classic Copan was one of the largest of all known Maya polities in territorial extent, if not population size. Regardless, the possibility that Quirigua was within Copan's Middle Classic realm is certainly consistent with evidence gained from all aspects of research at Copan that strongly supports the conclusion that the period of Copan's Classic florescence dates to a minimum of 400 years-equivalent to the span of its historically recorded dynasty-rather than the 200 years proposed by Webster and Freter (1990a:82). 
THE END OF THE CLASSIC AT COPAN 
The investigations at Copan since 1975 have made refinements in the ceramic chronology orig­inally proposed by Longyear, but the basic sequence has not been altered. In fact, in his recent work on the Copan ceramic sequence, Viel (1983, personal communication 1991) remarked on his respect for Longyear's original ceramic analyses and the conclusions that he drew from those analyses. And Webster and Freter ( 1990a:83) refer to Longyear's "good common sense and remarkable prescience." Nonetheless, the crucial juncture between Classic and Postclassic in the Copan ceramic sequence and its implications for understanding the timing and processes involved in the demise of the Copan polity have recently emerged as issues of concern, which we will briefly review here.

Dating the "Collapse " at Copan 
Viel dated the end of his Coner phase (equivalent to Longyear's Full Classic) on the basis of his original analysis and the lack of clear evidence for occupations associated with Postclassic ceramics (as defined by Longyear) from over 700 excavations in the Copan Valley carried out by the PAC I in 1978-1980 (Baudez 1983). Following Longyear's idea of a relatively rapid abandonment, Viel (1983:538, 542) allowed some 50 years between the end of monument commemoration (at that time still believed to be A.D. 800) and the end of the Coner phase. Thereafter, there are two dotted lines on his chronological chart (Viel 1983:541) between the end of the Coner phase and the beginning of the Early Postclassic Ejar phase, reflecting the "hiatus" proposed by Longyear between the end of his "Full Classic" and the beginning of the Postclassic (see above). 
Using comparative analysis, Viel dated the onset of the Early Postclassic to A.D. 900, based primarily on the appearance of Tohil Plumbate pottery, which had been found by Longyear (and used by him to define the Postclassic), by the PAC I investigations in scattered surface finds, and at Ballcourt B. The Tohil Plumbate horizon is generally dated to A.D. 900-1200 in southeast Mesoamerica (Viel 1983:539, 542). Thus, Viel's dating of the end of Coner and the beginning of Ejar were based on Longyear's original ceramic chronology, placed in the larger regional context of dated southeastern mesoamerican ceramics. 
It should be noted that Viel had no reliable radiocarbon or other chronometric dates to place the end of this phase in time. Radiocarbon assessments have continued to be problematic at Copan­Webster and Freter (l 990a:70-71) note that they have some inconsistent dates for their radiocarbon samples, a problem that has plagued earlier projects. From the moment he initiated PAC II in 1980, Sanders rightly insisted on the need for a tighter chronological control of the Coner phase ceramics. Unfortunately, such a ceramic "clock" was never developed, but the obsidian-hydration studies of Freter (1988; Webster and Freter l 990a) provide the potential for much tighter chronological control than ceramic dating could ever provide. As noted by Webster and Freter (1990a:70-71), however, obsidian-hydration dating has had "mixed results in Mesoamerica," and for that reason, despite the abundance of obsidian at Copan, Willey, Baudez, and their fellow settlement researchers had continued to rely on chronological schema derived from comparative studies of the other cultural and chronological sequences in southeast Mesoamerica. 
During the PAC I research, Fash inherited the valley survey and excavations program from Willey and Leventhal's Harvard Project, and followed the dating of the ceramic phases proposed by the PAC ceramicist, Rene Viel, in his considerations of settlement history in the Copan Valley (Fash l 983a, l 983b, l 986a). Several key interpretations of the archaeological record were tied to the chronological placement of the Coner phase. Among them was the idea that the valley test-pitting data indicated that the bottomlands of the eastern half of the Copan pocket (location of the Principal Group) were basically filled in with settlements soon after the onset of the Coner phase, and that the foothills of the eastern pocket were also densely settled by the end of dynastic rule (at that time dated to A.D. 800). Fash believed that occupation of the fertile bottomlands, the transference of agricultural activities to the thinner and less productive soils of the foothills and upper slopes of the valley, and the amount of deforestation and erosion entailed by the agricultural and fuel needs of the peak population (then estimated at 1 7 ,000) would have provoked drastic ecological conse­quences, entailing system failure and a rapid decrease in population. At that time Viel's estimate of 50 years for the Coner-Ejar transition seemed like a reasonable timespan for this abandonment of the pocket. In discussing the question of the "dissolution of the Copan state," Fash (1983b:304) was emphatic in stating that the ceramic chronology did not allow for much precision in the dating of the pertinent processes and events: 
In the case of Copan, dramatic increases in population size through the Coner phase placed increasing stress on both the sociopolitical system and the environmental substrate. In Chapters 6 and 7 we examined how these stresses were responded to in terms of agricultural and settlement systems on the one hand, and increasing segregation on the other. Here we will provide a model for the manner in which this increasingly hypercoherent system failed, resulting in rapid devolution and eventual collapse. However, we must offer the caveat that the data base for the collapse is in general much weaker than that for the rise at Copan. This is due in large part to the lack of a refined ceramic chronology for the final years of the Late Classic Coner phase (see discussion, Section VI, Appendix A). At present we can discern what some of the major stresses and defects in the system

were, but the specific timing and interaction of these factors remain to be adequately documented in empirical terms. As such, the present discussion is at the same time a model and a research design for future investigations into this problem. 
Until recently this is the way things stood regarding the timing for the end of the Classic era at Copan. Although we indicated in our earlier discussion some difficulties in using their data for reconstructing the history of settlement in the Copan Valley, we feel Webster and Freter (l 990a, 1990b) have presented the best possible overview of Late Classic (Coner period) valley settlement. This is because the nature of archaeological remains and transformational processes in the valley and the aims of the most recent settlement projects have combined to produce a much more reliable sample of Coner period sites than those from earlier periods. In regard to their findings from this sample, they propose extending the end of the Coner ceramic phase several centuries later in time, thereby dating the final abandonment of the Copan Valley to ca. A.D. 1100-1200, based on the application of obsidian-hydration dating to samples obtained from the testing of large numbers of surface sites outside the Principal Group in all five sections or "pockets" of the Copan Valley system (Webster and Freter 1990a:80-82). We feel their proposed extension of the Coner phase is potentially the most important of their results, especially for its implications regarding the collapse issue. 
Defining the Classic "Collapse" at Copan 
It is clear that the working model of the "collapse" at Copan proposed nearly a decade ago by Fash (l 983b) has been substantially and constructively corrected by the research of Sanders, Webster, Freter, and their PAC II colleagues. The post-1980 valley work has shown that Fash was more radical in his materialist-inspired "ecological consequences" model than the case merited. In terms of process, it is clear that the ecological consequences of Coner phase settlement patterns predicted to have been a predominant factor in the collapse of centralized dynastic authority were less severe by the early ninth century A.D. than Fash had suggested in 1983. While the overcrowding and increasing social segregation in the eastern Copan pocket, as well as the deforestation of the sur­rounding area entailed by the resident population (Abrams and Rue 1988; Rue 1987), may in fact have had a role in the destabilization of the political system, nonetheless these factors were not so devastating as to require the total displacement of the population. After the population peaked in the first half of the ninth century A.D. (William T. Sanders, personal communication 1990), there was still enough productive, arable land in the surrounding region for the population to survive­in slowly declining numbers and progressively less-nucleated communities-for several centuries thereafter (Webster and Freter 1990a, 1990b). 
In this vein, and in order to clarify which issues and processes are under discussion, we suggest that the question of the so-called "collapse" should be more precisely defined as a sequence of processes. The first process was the increasing decentralization of political authority that was seem­ingly triggered by the shock of the defeat and loss of one of Copan's great rulers at the hands of a former vassal at Quirigua. The evidence presented earlier indicating that Acropolis Str. 10L-22A was a council house for the representatives of the different wards or lineages of the Copan polity is one example of the means used by the succeeding Copan ruler to incorporate the elite leadership in the decision-making process. The structure of second-tier elite administrators that gained strength in the wake of this setback (Fash 1988) survived the end of the ancient Copan dynasty and continued to direct many activities in the Copan valley during the final years of occupation. This process of political decentralization overlaps and probably contributed to the second process, the collapse of the centralized dynastic political authority, presently dated at Copan to the unfinished inscription on Altar L citing the purported accession of a successor to the sixteenth ruler in A.D. 822 (Schele and Grube 1987). The third process was the demographic decline that occurred in the centuries 
following the political collapse, at least in part the result of ecological stress (Abrams and Rue 1988), as the peak population slowly declined in numbers and redistributed itself across the landscape. This same pattern of political collapse followed by protracted activity and demographic decline has been seen at other sites in the Maya Lowlands (Chase and Rice 1985), as at Tikal (Coe 1968), Quirigua (Sharer 1985), and most recently in the Petexbatun (Demarest 1990), although the specific

scenario apparent at Copan is not applicable to these other regions. Thus Webster and Freter ( l 990a: 82) have added Copan to the roster of lowland sites that indicate that the Classic Maya "collapse" was an extended process, rather than a sudden catastrophe, played out in most lowland polities over a period of several centuries (see Sharer 1985:249-252). 
The important advances in dating provided by the obsidian-hydration studies in the Copan Valley settlements, as well as the renewed investigations of epigraphy, iconography, and related architectural studies in both the valley and the Principal Group, should allow for better control on the processes and events precipitating the political collapse of centralized authority. Issues such as the size, distribution, and nature of the population that continued to live in the valley after that time are best addressed by investigating sites shown to have occupations that postdate the political collapse. For those interested in the latter issues, the sites in question are now readily identifiable in both outlying areas and in much of the Copan pocket, thanks to the work of Webster and Freter (l 990a, l 990b) and Webster and Gonlin (1988). 
Although Webster and Freter (l 990a:70-7 l, 80) note the problems that have traditionally plagued obsidian-hydration dating and that Webster and Sanders "favor shifting the obsidian sequence back 50 years," nonetheless their data do point clearly in the direction proposed and are consistent with the radiocarbon-dated palynological evidence from the Copan Valley (Rue 1987). Thus it is apparent that many large sites continued to be occupied after the political collapse, as did a great number of small surface sites in the valley, especially those in rural areas. But we feel that the extension of the Coner ceramic complex by another 200-300 years (essentially doubling its original estimated span) raises some important questions. Among these is, Why do the sites that produce obsidian dating to A.D. 800-1200 yield Coner ceramics (Webster and Freter 1990a:80-81), rather than Ejar pottery (the latter with its Plumbate and other Early Postclassic ceramic markers; see Viel [1983:538-539))? It is obvious that the definition of, and transition between, these two ceramic complexes needs reexamination in light of this new chronometric evidence, and the apparent absence of Plum bate and other well-established Early Postclassic ceramic type and form markers in association with these late Coner deposits needs to be explained. Thus, while we agree that settlement of the Copan Valley did continue beyond the ninth century A.D., the actual length of time that occupation persisted after the political collapse appears still to need refinement by ceramic analyses and further testing by other chronometric dating techniques, including more of the archaeomagnetic dates mentioned but not discussed by Webster and Freter (1990a:78). 
From a larger perspective, the Copan evidence has an important bearing on the long-standing "collapse" issue. The conjunction of data from valley-settlement and urban-core contexts, derived from archaeological, art historical, and epigraphic sources, allows us to see the "collapse" as a long­term process of decline at Copan, beginning in the Late Classic and extending into the Early Postclassic, rather than the sudden catastrophic event traditionally associated with the end of the Classic period. While local or regional processes may be proposed to explain a pan-Maya Lowlands collapse (Demarest 1990:21 ), it seems to us that the specific causes for the demise of the lowland Classic Maya was due to a conflation of a series of processes that operated within individual polities over a minimum of several centuries. This is not to say that these local and regional processes were not systemically related, along the lines proposed by Lowe (1985), but the Copan evidence does reinforce the present consensus that there was no single cause-such as invasion, disease, environ­mental degradation, overpopulation, or warfare-that was responsible for the collapse everywhere in the Maya Lowlands. The very fact that polities and regions, such as Lamanai in the eastern lowlands, survived the Classic collapse relatively unscathed (Pendergast 1981), or that specific processes and timing of "collapse" was different in different areas (see Demarest [ 1990: 14-21] for an example of the sudden demise of Dos Pilas as capital of the Petexbatun polity due to conquest), indicates that we are dealing with a complex and long-operating series of processes rather than a single and sudden cause for the end of lowland Classic Maya civilization. 
CONCLUSION 
We have attempted to show how conjunctive research at Copan, as it has developed over a 15­year period, representing complementary but diverse programs with different objectives, strategies, and theoretical orientations, nonetheless provides a unique opportunity to explain the developmental

trajectory of the Classic Copan polity, including major questions facing all students of past complex societies, such as the origins and demise of such systems. Thus we have seen that settlement archaeology, based on mapping surface manifestations of ancient activity followed by systematic test-pitting samples of those remains, can provide a reasonable reconstruction of the latest or peak period of occupation in the Copan valley. But, at the same time, this approach has a greater difficulty, and ·may even yield misleading results, when pressed to extend its findings to earlier periods of occupation. A more accurate and complete picture of Middle Classic Copan emerges when settlement evidence is combined with the archaeological and historical data from the urban core of the Copan polity. At the other end of the developmental trajectory, the collapse at Copan is redefined as a multiple-stage process involving decentralized administration, demise of centralized dynastic au­thority in the early ninth century, and continuation of occupation for several centuries thereafter before eventual abandonment of the Copan Valley. This picture emerges from combining results from the ongoing Acropolis excavations, work in Late Classic elite residential compounds, and important new dating evidence gained from recent PAC II settlement research. 
Of course, since the goal of all scientific inquiry is to build upon knowledge, we hope that this examination will be seen as a constructive point of departure for improvements in method and theory in acquiring and interpreting data from complex sociopolitical systems, as well as informative in the strictly empirical sense. We fully expect that our present understanding of Copan will continue to be modified by future research. Thus, it is our hope and our conviction that the rich resource of different data sets from Copan will continue to be successfully combined to provide much more useful models of settlement history and cultural process in the Copan Valley. To do so requires patience, flexibility, long-term commitment, and a concerted effort by specialists from different disciplines who understand the strengths, as well as the limitations, presented by each of the available sets of evidence.
