alpacas). Bonavia identifies a critical sampling bias 
hampering the development of a zooarchaeological 
record for the Late Horizon. Likewise, a recovery bias 
has removed some early sites from consideration. The 
methods used to study camelid remains, unsatisfying 
at the time that this book was first put together, have, 
in fact, developed to meet some of Bonavia's challenges 
to the field. The work of Miller and Gill at Pirincay on 
camelids in Ecuador has been followed by regionally 
specific studies such as those by Mengoni andYacobac­
cio on sites in Argentina. This recent research on 
camelid body size variation coincides with Bonavia's 
impression that camelids adapted to a wide variety of 
conditions. 
The historical data are generally drawn from well­
known chronicles and legal documents. Bonavia pays 
close attention to the problems of interpreting colonial 
terminology used to describe totally unfamiliar live­
stock. These accounts generally support the presence 
of camelids in coastal valleys, across the highlands, 
and into the upper reaches of the eastern tropics, but 
they do not substantially alter the range of the came lids 
known from archaeological sites. 
Moving beyond Peru in Chapter 9, "Archaeological 
and Other Historical Data from Other Latin American 
Countries," Bonavia draws material from as far north as 
Nicaragua and Costa Rica (enigmatic ceramic effigy of 
a possible camelid) to Tierra de! Fuego (guanacos hunted 
into the twentieth century). Relatively detailed material 
is presented on the northern Andes, Paraguay, Argentina, 
and Chile. Unfortunately, almost no material is included 
on Bolivia, home of the majority of the world's llamas 
today. Taking these records into account further strength­
ens Bonavia's position that the camelids did well far 
away from their presumed high-altitude homelands, and 
that a combination of disease, competition from intro­
duced sheep and cattle, and ignorance of their potential 
has led to their decline (Chapter 12). Bonavia fears that 
the recent decline of numbers across South America is 
another step in their eventual extinction. 
Despite this book's heft and comprehensive approach, it lacks some relevant source material. The ; majority of sources in the bibliography appeared before 
' 
the early 1990s; few references date to the later 1990s or after. Included in a special bibliography are the sources cited by the authors he consulted but which were not available to him. These unobtainable sources (and others the author was apparently unaware of) include a substantial body of research presented in doc­toral dissertations and theses by U.S., European, and Argentinean scholars. This gap suggests that those schol­ars (myself included) have been ineffective in making their key findings available to a colleague who shares a keen interest. The data in these other sources generally supports the reconstruction presented by Bonavia, doc­umenting the use of alpacas and llamas as food (rather than being restricted to their role in ritual, fiber pro­duction and transport as is indicated by some docu­ments). There is more evidence for the introduction of camelids (and the decline of deer) at many more For­mative sites including rare but consistent records for southern Peru. Archaeological finds now fill in the con­tinuous distribution of both large and small camelid pro­duction across the Andes, and there is emerging evidence for llamas whose large size suggests they were selected as pack llamas. Readers of this book should also be aware of the publications of the Grupo Zooarqueologia de Camelidos, a Working Group of the International Council for Archaezoology, and the forthcoming spe­cial volume on the state of zooarchaeology in Latin America sponsored by ICAZ. Other research relevant to the book's coverage from the last 15 years would include studies on modem and ancient camelid genet­ics, expanding work on camelid diets using stable iso­topes of carbon and nitrogen, work on the geographic origins of individuals using stable isotopes of strontium and lead, and the fuller realization of archaeozoologi­cal methods for aging bone remains and describing size variation. Clear evidence in support of Bonavia's argu­ment about camelids in South America comes from the increasing numbers of llamas and alpacas living near sea level in North America, Europe, and Australia, and the extensive veterinary and management literature that has emerged from their care. The author touches on this topic (as of the 1990s), but its significance has contin­ued to increase over the last 15 years. 
There is a cranky tone to some of Bonavia's bibli­ographic research, occasionally so exaggerated that it may offend some readers. Those readers should prob­ably overlook this and appreciate the enthusiastic strug­gle to amass the material summarized, and the care taken to check the exact information behind so much generalization, opinion, and speculation about camelids. This book sets the stage for appreciation of llamas and alpacas as global players in the world of domesticated animal species, important far beyond South America.

LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 20, No. 2, 2009] 
tion of The Human Body and Ideology: Concepts of the Ancient Nahuas, Alfredo Lopez Austin's seminal work on the all-encompassing role of the body among the Nahua, and Mesoamerican peoples in general. It is also this idea of the body as the sustenance and fundamen­tal cosmological bond with the external world that anchors the ambitious effort of Stephen Houston, David Stuart, and Karl Taube to explore ancient Maya mind­sets, feelings, and their expression in everyday life. As they argue, this approach is not only convenient but indeed compulsory, since the body is the only entity that is suitable to grant access to past lived experience and sentiment. 
Apart from the intellectual inspiration of L6pez­Austin' s work, Jill Furst' s research on concepts of the soul in Mesoamerica and-most importantly-a long history of scholarly work conducted by the authors themselves, The Memory of Bones draws from a care­fully designed analytical frame. The theoretical ground­work is applied coherently to interpret a truly impressive volume of iconographic, archaeological, and linguistic evidence. This strategy of data-reliant, balanced inter­disciplinary research, combined with exquisite schol­arship, succeeds in driving home the key points discussed throughout the volume. The well-founded interpretation and the broad scope of the research there­fore separate this study agreeably from many of today's more speculative readings of past body experiences. 
The study is organized into eight well-written and richly illustrated chapters with titles mimicking a psy­chosomatic compendium with anthropological under­currents. The tempo is set from the beginning of Chapter 1, which explores the overall organism, its constituent parts, and their representations in word and picture, relying heavily on polysemy and anatomical parton­omy. From here, the reader is lead through a step-by­step discussion of relevant facets of ancient Maya lived existence and its cultural choreography, ranging from basic physiological functions to the senses and felt emo­tions, mind and personality, identity, and its cultural expression. 
Throughout the volume, the authors are careful to acknowledge the diversity of (bio)cultural body expe­riences within the Classic period. They talk about dif­ferent settings, about gendered social participation and perception, young and old, commoners and elites. Although the authors do use datasets pertaining to dif­ferent epochs, they focus consistently on the Classic period throughout the volume. This consistency allows for coherent coverage of scholarly terrain for an epoch, which is difficult to access from our present, postcolo­nial world and mentality. 
Given the topic, the allusive book title, and myself being a bioarchaeologist, I would have been pleased to see a more in-depth exploration of the physical substrate of the experienced body, namely the skeletal remains and their cultural relevance. Inquiries -like the ones regarding facial physiognomy from the skulls, the cul­tural assimilation of the severe nutritional diseases that show up in the record, or the possible motifs behind the bewildering diversity of artificial head shapes recorded within the Maya realm-appear to be beyond the focus of this study. These facets, along with many other issues that the authors do explore and discuss extensively, trace promising future avenues of scholarly research. Apart from the solid groundwork that the study estab­lishes, it is precisely these new ideas and questions that ; The Memory of Bones inspires, for which my colleagues

Ecological issues and the biological evidence of social status differences still stand as a stronghold in Maya skeletal studies. Besides broad questions concerning biodiversity, health, nutrition, adaptation, and repro­duction in different sociocultural settings, skeletal research has focused on the role of diet and health in the so-called "collapse" of Maya hegemonic structures at the end of the Classic period. Specifically the question whether the slash-and-burn (milpa) subsistence econ­omy could or could not have sustained over centuries densely settled areas in fragile tropical ecosystems has maintained the attention of the scholarly community. According to this argument, the Maya overexploited the environment, exceeding its carrying capacity, while sus­taining an ever-increasing population and having to meet the growing demands of its ruling elite. Agricultural intensification, mono-cropping, and environmental degradation brought about infections and malnutrition that undermined the inner structure of society and even­tually led to the dramatic social changes and demo­graphic collapse that is documented for large pats of the Maya Lowlands. 
It is this line of reasoning that anchors Lori Wright's monograph. The author sets out to examine systemat­ically the skeletal and contextual evidence for or against the proposed environmental argument, contending that, if the ecological model were true, then a series of changes starting from a qualitative impoverishment in diet and extreme reliance on maize through time should be expected. These detrimental living conditions should
