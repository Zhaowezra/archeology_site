The ballgamewas prominentin most Mesoamer­ican centers. Its importance transcends its reli­gious symbolismasaninstitutionthat mediated social and political relationships, as shown in the regional distribution of courts in relation to settlement hierarchies (see Scarborough and Wilcox1991). In contrast to regional studies,in this article we examine spatial patterning within urban epicenters. Two intrasite spatial parame­ters contribute to understanding the role of the Mesoamerican ballgame: access and visibility (Smith 2007:23–25). 
Accessreferstothedegreeof ease(or restric­tion) to reach the ballgame within its formally constructed architectural space and addressesthe centralityof ball courtsand their positionrelative to other publically accessibleareas (e.g., plazas). A pioneering study by Hammond (1972:769) used graph theoretic connections among plazas and buildings at the lowland Maya site of Lubaantún to reveal that the ball court was rela­tivelyisolatedand inaccessible.In contrast,most Mesoamerican ball courts (including the Gulf lowlands)werebuilt near the centralplaza, indi­catingtheir easy accessibilityinanobviousway.

or political reasons from ascending the mounds .ankingthe court,fromwhereweassumepromi­nent individualswatched. The ballgamesimulta­neously united populations,providinganeventof public interest, and divided social groups based on privilege. This observation anticipates our broader .ndings froma formal analysisofgame visibility. 
Moore (1996a, 1996b, 2005) pioneered an approach to determining capacities and visibil­ities for Andean public plazas and monumen­tal architecture. Subsequently, several investiga­tors have concentrated on Mesoamerican plaza capacities to understand ceremonial or civic visibilities (Inomata 2006;Tsukamoto and Ino­mata 2014). Mesoamerican monumental plat­formssupportedbuildings well abovetheplazas, allowing people to look up and witness pro­cessions ascending stairs or ceremonies in front of temples. In contrast, architectural ball courts have .anking platforms that reduce visibility. Additionally,crowd clustering around the courts would impede the vision of those standing behind.Forexample, our analysis indicates that maximum potentialviewersat ball courts ranged from 323 to 2,869 people, depending on the measurement method and the particular built environment surrounding the ball court. 
Measuring access and visibility of the ball­gamerevealswhetheritwasdesignedforthepub­lic or restricted to certain social segments. These deductions may reveal strategies of social inte­gration(i.e., inclusivevs.exclusive; e.g.,Blanton and Fargher 2008; Blanton et al. 1996) and relate to modes of governance: more abundant facilitiesorbetter accesswith stronger collective action, or more limited access with autocratic rule thatwas not heavily reliant on taxpayersfor revenue (Blanton andFargher 2008). Ourwork also contributestoinvestigationsof open space in settlements(Smith 2008;Stanleyet al.2012; Stark 2014a, 2014c)and accesstofacilitiesthat provide public bene.t (e.g., Stanleyet al. 2016). 
We calculate viewership of ballgames in the Gulflowlandsthat wereplayedon formal,archi­tecturally constructed courts (henceforth archi­tectural courts) used during the Classic period (AD 300–900).Wethen comparegameviewing to the number of people accommodated in the main plazas to assess the relative degree to which viewing a game was open to the public. Main public plazas were formal public assembly spaces typically designed to accommodatelarge crowds.Plaza capacities, which canbe measured preciselyand consistently,providean upper limit to the quanti.cation of public inclusiveness at any site and a way for us to normalize the viewershipoftheballgame acrosssettlementsof differing sizes. 
The game operated on several social levels, not all of them con.ned to architectural courts. We distinguish viewership from the audience; namely, the totality of people who may have heard or seen parts of the game or associated activities, perhaps processions to the court or gambling onthe outcome (see Hill and Clark 2001). Peoplewho could not seethegame may have heard it, including shouted descriptions fromothers. Other peoplemayhave seenit from so far away that details of the game were not readily observed. Thus, an audience involves a graduated scale of participation that we cannot calculatebutisrelevanttotheoverall attraction of ballgames. 
Weevaluateviewershipdifferences withinthe site hierarchy for three primary, six secondary, and one tertiary center for the western lower Papaloapan basin (WLPB),andforthree primary centers in the southwestern Tuxtla Mountains, Veracruz,Mexico(Figure1).We .nd that view­ershipofgamesis notablyrestricted relativeto plaza capacities. Games may have had many political, sacred, and social roles, including social integration,butthegame alsowassocially divisive in viewership. 
The Mesoamerican Ballgame and Its Social and Political Implications 
The Mesoamerican Ballgame (Scarborough and Wilcox 1991) and later publications advanced arguments about the political and social roles of theritual ballgame. DeBoer(1993)did thesame forthe North American chunkeygame,whichhe argued becomemore centralized under Cahokia. We continue the focus on the social and polit­ical dimensions of court games by examining thedegreetowhich Mesoamerican architectural courts measureupaspublicfacilities.Howmany people couldsee the actionofthegame relative

to the capacity of main plazas where the city’s most prominent public ritualstook place? 
UnlikeNorth American “chunk yards,” which at Cahokia consisted of a central .eld area (Pauketat 2009), Mesoamerican architectural courts are constructed with two parallel plat­formswith sloping sides that framea.at playing alley(Figure2). Courts vary in size and ori­entation. The ends of the court are subject to varying treatments, and courts may have other architectural elements, such as side rings, .oor markers, or benches(Taladoire 1981),and rarely, sculpted panels (Castillo Peña 1995; Kampen 1972;Ladrón de Guevara1999). Interpretations of the ballgamedifferin part becausethegame wasplayed invariableways,re.ectingregional traditions (Taladoire 1981). Courts may have been used forotherevents(e.g., boxing matches [Taube and Zender 2009]orritual battles[Tal­adoire 2011, 2012a]). 
The lateral mounds would have accommo­dated viewers onlyontop becausethe inner sides had rolesinthegame itself, allowing de.ection of balls. The slopes of platforms .anking the courtwere not bleachers.WestMexican ceramic ef.gies of courts, players, and viewers show peopleseatedonthe .anking moundsand around the end zones, as does a graf.to from Tikal

(Taladoire 2012b). Sometimes one or both ends ofthe courthavealowmoundthatmayhavepro­videda “viewingstand,”but open-ended courts are prevalent in the Gulf and Maya lowlands (Taladoire 1981). In the cases examined here, end zones areusually open, though occasionally alow end mound likely accommodated viewers. Wecannot rule outwooden bleachersatthe open ends, but no supporting evidence has yet been uncovered. For open-ended courts, we assume viewersstood aroundadesignatedend perimeter, also providing stops for errant balls. In many regions, T-shaped end zones are enclosed with walls, unlikethecourts addressed here.With such courts, people couldhavesat on thewalls with others standing behind them. 
The architectural framing of the court has a marked effect on who gets a good view of the action.Wede.ne “primeviews”asthoseenjoyed by people standing or sitting atop the .anking mounds, standing along the open end zones, or perched on an end mound (bleacher-like). Sometimes structuresfartherawayafforded “sec­ondaryviews,”butonehasto considertheeffects of distance and peoplearound the courtblocking linesof sight.Manysurrounding structures were temples or palaces—buildings for which access may have been controlled and for which the facades (typically plastered or .nished with a sealant if made of earthen construction) would have been vulnerable to damage from viewers scaling the sides (concerning Gulf earthen con­struction, see Daneels and Guerrero 2013). A series of games may increase total population reached by a single architectural court, and we return to this subject in the Discussion and Conclusions section. 
The conformity of the architectural courts raises the possibility that viewership was delib­erately limited. Constructionofmounds .anking the court originated quite early in Mesoamerica on the basis of Chiapan evidence dating around 1600 BC (Hill and Clark 2001). The early court at the village of Paso de la Amada, Chiapas, is long (80 m), and the .anking mounds and end zones may have provided prime viewing toamajorityof that small community.Atlater (and larger) centers,asmallerproportionofthe population could watch in these positions. In some parts of Mesoamerica, later courts were sunken, reducing possiblesecondaryviewership (Chinchilla Mazariegos 2009:146). 
Informal ballgames mayhave been played on an open, demarcated .eldarea, likethe surviving gamesinwesternMexico(Leyenaar2001;Leye­naar andParsons 1988:94–148; seealsoWhalen and Minnis 1996).We term these “.eld courts” in contrast to architectural courts, and later we discuss their possible social signi.cance. The viewership numbersprovided here apply onlyto architectural courts. Widespread interest in the ballgamemayhave been achieved throughamix offormal occasionsand“sandlot”eventsopento anyone (Miller and Houston 1987). Like soccer in Latin America today, playing the ballgame among the general population generates interest in professional events and vice versa. 
Investigators recognize different social and political roles for the game, some of which have implications for viewership. These range from external political functions (Kowalewski et al. 1991), to internal mediation (e.g., Fox et al. 1996; Gillespie 1991; Taladoire 2011, 2012a), to recreational events(Anderson 2012; Fox et al. 1996:494; Scarborough 1991:141– 142). Some authorssuggestthegame recognized social divisions (Gillespie 1991:342; Taladoire 2011, 2012a; Wilkerson 1991:55), promoted social unity (AgüeroReyes et al. 2009;Daneels 2008, 2016;Fox 1991:213),orindicated the de­gree of political centralization(Liendo Stuardo 2015; Santley et al. 1991). Cosmic-symbolic considerations are a recurrent scholarly preoc­cupation (e.g., Aguilar-Moreno 2015; Baudez 1984 cited by Taladoire and Colsenet 1991; Cohodas 1991;Fox 1991; Miller and Houston 1987:63; Scott 2009;Uriarte 2015). If political leaders, especially rulers, positioned themselves prominently in ballgame rituals, augmentation of political stature ties the ritual and symbolic dimensionsof thegameto its political side. 
Some social and political interpretations hinge on the number and location of courts in relation to the centralization of political power, with the idea that the privilege, authority, and resources to build a court depended on the autonomyandpowerofthe community.Accord­ing to Santley and coauthors (1991), many courts at various differently sized settlements indicate weak centralization. Both restriction of

courts to thebiggestsettlements and placement mainly along frontiers suggest centralized con­trol of the facilities in Oaxaca (Kowalewski et al. 1991). 
Alternatively, the game could be theorized as an institution that integrates communities through popular participation (Agüero Reyes et al. 2009; Daneels 2008, 2016). In this rea­soning, internal social differences arerecognized competitively through thegame,but peopleare also uni.ed becausegames areplayedatavariety of settlements, creating cross-cutting relation­ships. In the data we examine, courts appear in primary and secondary centers, and rarely in smaller centers or other specialized contexts (such as part of a palace complex). Therefore, they exemplify a well-distributed pattern, sim­ilartothat reportedbyDaneels(2008, 2016) for the lower Cotaxtla River valley in south­centralVeracruz. Ourresearch bothsupports and modi.es theintegrative perspective becausewe show that viewership in architectural courts was far less than the quantity of people who could be accommodated in the main plazas of Gulf lowland centers; therefore, thegames hadamore restrictiveintegrative role. 
Interpretations of Mesoamerican Public Plazas 
Plazas are public Mesoamerican facilities par excellence, usually accommodating relatively large numbers of people(Tsukamoto and Ino­mata 2014), potentially drawnfromthe site,the surrounding hinterland, and even other centers. A plaza is a public open space delimited by buildings of predominantly civic, religious, or commercialfunction. Usuallytheplazais framed on all sides, but in some regional traditions, the presence of buildings on only two or three sides can imply a quadrilateral form. Kostof (1992:149–152) notes a wide variety of plaza formsworldwide, including irregular spaces,but Mesoamerican plazas tend to be quadrilateral (e.g., Solari 2014), compatible with cosmicprin­ciples and cardinality. We concentrate on the “mainplaza,”whichis surroundedby themost prominent civic, palatial, or religious structures inthesettlement.Rarely,theremaybe morethan one such plaza. 
Mesoamerican plazas vary considerably in area (Ossa et al. 2017; Tsukamoto and Ino­mata 2014), as do Andean plazas, which has implications fortheirfunctions (Moore 1996a). Ethnohistoric,soil chemistry,and artifact studies indicate multifunctionality (Ossa et al. 2017). For the central precinct at the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan, López Austin and López Luján (2017) note that calendric festivals included ritual,processions, dances, and other activities. Ritual observances have been emphasized in Maya plaza interpretations (e.g., Inomata 2006; Tsukamoto and Inomata 2014), and feasting has been argued from soil chemistry studies (e.g., Fulton et al. 2013; Wells et al. 2007). Unlike Tenochtitlan, which had a designated area for a daily market, many smaller centers would use their plazas for periodic markets or over.ows from a dedicated space (Chase and Chase 2014; Chaseetal. 2015;Dahlinetal.2007,2010;Terry et al. 2015). 
Plaza capacities are an interpretive issue. Some investigators (e.g., Inomata 2006)have argued that main plazas could have accommo­dated most of the population of a site. We do not pursue a comparison to site populations because we lack reasonably precise population estimates forthe setofcentersexamined.1 Plaza capacitiesmay re.ectdiverse designprinciples. Some plazas may have been “overdesigned”; that is,larger than any expected crowdinorder to createanimposingspatialgrandeur, perhaps symbolizing the importance of a center, estab­lishing room forprocessions,oraccommodating sculpture or other displays. Plazas may have been constructed for occasional assemblies that included people from beyond the site, perhaps neighboringsettlements. Ossaetal.(2017)show that as settlementsincreasein population, plaza space does not increaseatthe same rate.Assem­bled crowds surely varied widely in numbers with the occasion. Our interest, nevertheless, is in the comparison of estimates of maximum ballgame viewers with maximum main plaza capacityto addressdegreesofexclusivity. 
We calculate plaza capacities two ways, drawing on information provided by Moore (1996a:149) on Andean plazas.Mooredrewon three estimates of densities, all expressed as the area attributed to a single person: 0.46 m2,

3.6 m2, and 21.6 m2. He argued the densest packingis unlikely andfar above the population estimates of some Andean sites. The lowest density of 21.6 m2 includes too few individ­uals for events at some small Andean plazas. The middle value of 3.6 m2 in effect remains more plausibletohim. Ethnographicinformation warranting these values is extremely scarce and does not provide much guidance for estimating maximum packing.We opted fortwo densities within therange describedbyMoore: 0.5m2 and 2m2 per person, selected somewhat arbitrarily to represent upperandlowerhigh-packing assump­tions.Notethatonlythe0.5m2 packingisused forareasof ballgameviewers,however, because prime game-viewing space was so limited that we assume thehighest packing. 
Assessing Ballgame Visibility in the Gulf 
Lowlands: Data and Methods 

We use two methods to determine ballgame viewership. The .rst employs plane geometry and scaled measurements to determine lines of sight toward the center point of the courts. For the WLPB, this largely pencil-and-paper method (M1) was used to calculate viewership forprimary and secondary centers(Stark 2012) to determine if viewership restrictions differed according to the settlement hierarchy (Stark 2014b). Perhapsat secondary centersviewership was less restrictive because local leaders were less powerful, allowing more social integration. 
Oursecond method(M2)is moreexact,using viewsheds calculated in ArcMap 10.2.2(ESRI) with digital elevation modules (DEMs) inter­polated from vector contour maps. The second methodwas appliedtothe threeprimary centers in the WLPB and three in the southwestern Tuxtlas,plusoneWLPB secondary center(Tuza­les), undertaken .rst as a smaller test case. GIS computer programs can precisely calculate viewsheds—the areas for which lines of sight exist. 
The two methods provide .exibility, and we compare results for the epicenters analyzed bothways.Not allinvestigatorshave accessto, or expertise in using, viewshed programs for ball-court analysis, nor is precise quanti.cation always requiredtoreach basic conclusions about access and visibility.In bothmethods,thereare challengesand assumptions,sometimesdiffering according to the method. 
Data Sources 
Data are drawn from two Gulf locales where wehave accessto contour maps or DEMs.The Mesoamerican ballgame has a long history in the Gulf lowlands, with indications as early as Gulf Olmec times during the Early Formative period(1200–900BC; Daneels 2015;Ortízetal. 2015).As noted,weexaminesite epicentersfrom theClassic period(AD 300–900).We converted WLPB maps to vector images and then used contours to interpolate DEMs. Tuxtlas vector maps have not been analyzed with the manual procedures becausethe viewshed approach (M2) is more precise. 
Western LowerPapaloapan Basin(WLPB). We examined 63 monumental or quasi-monu­mental complexes in primary and second­ary centers fromseveral projects(Speaker 2001; Stark 1999, 2008;TorresGuzmán1972;Torres Guzmán et al. 1975). Surface collections from site epicenters and surrounding occupation establish the Classic period (AD 300–900) dating for the centers and their ball courts. Antecedent courts may have existed at Cerro de las Mesas, where a yoke was interred with aburial likely between AD1and 300 (Daneels 1997:220; Drucker 1943:8; Stirling 1941). No courts areevidentatthetwoPostclassictownsin thesurvey area. Thegreat majorityof the courts occur in formal arrangements at centers that display “StandardPlan” plazas (Daneels 2002), which dominated duringthe Classic period. 
At the Standard Plan plaza, a high conical mound is accompanied by one or two elongated moundson thesidesofarelativelysquareplaza, with an architectural court at the opposite end. Typically,the court axisisthe same as theplaza axiscrossingthe conical mound;the courts rarely have transverseorientations.Noneof the courts analyzed have been excavated, and we do not know about architectural details, sculpture, or offerings. 
In the WLPB, the courts are usually open on both ends (27 cases), which is the Type 1 form describedbyTaladoire(1981)ascommon

A few courts (six cases) havealow mound, possiblya viewingstand, at one end. Endmounds aremore commoninthe next drainage west,the Cotaxtla (Daneels 2002, 2016). 
Twenty-four courts were mapped, with nine other possible cases. Only 17 courts from 11 centers are analyzed here because ofdamage to courtmoundsor obstaclesto contour mapping.A “possible court”isalowmound displaying court­likeproportionsand locatedintheusual position in theStandardPlanplazabutwhich has suffered severe erosion. In theCotaxtla drainage, courts oftensitonlowplatforms,but this arrangement has not been detectedin theWLPB. 
The length of .anking mounds affects the amount of prime viewing, assuming some audi­ence members watched from on top. Only pro­visional length measurements can be provided using .anking structures (we use the longest one in Table1). In the WLPB, the .anking mounds are approximately equal in height, usu­ally between30and50mlong (similartoTuxtlas primary centers). The longest is 86 m in the central courtofNopiloa,aLateClassicprimary center (AD 600–900).The smallest is 24 m, in Lobato, a semimonumental complex that was possiblyasmall community center.Itislocated near theproposed edgeof theAzuzules primary center and mayhavebeena“border complex”on its perimeter (Stark 2014a). 
Thethree WLPB primary centersincludedin the analysis are Cerro de las Mesas (Drucker 1943;Stark 2003; Stirling 1943), Nopiloa (Medellín Zenil 1987), and Azuzules (Stark 1999). Cerro de las Mesas was the capital of theWLPB duringthe EarlyClassic period(AD 300–600), but the other two centers operated independently along with Ajitos-Pitos during the Late Classic when the Cerro de las Mesas realm disintegrated (Stark 2003). Ajitos-Pitos, located in the paleodunes, is omitted because heavy vegetation prevented contour mapping. We also exclude a center in the mangrove swamp. 
Among the primary centers analyzed, the epicenterof CerrodelasMesasis unique because it has an agglomerative quality, with several Standard Plan plaza groups (Stark 2003), per­haps representing communityfactions.Two ball courts are associated with central Cerro de las Mesas, and four more aredistributed around the outer perimeterofthe epicenter(oneisapossible court).Fiveofthesixball courtscanbe analyzed. The centralCerrode lasMesas-North courtisat the edge of the largest main plaza, surrounded by someof thebiggestarchitecture.Forthe .ve Cerrodelas Mesas courts,wemade calculations usingthe adjacent main plazas for each, and not allplaza areas combined. Other WLPB primary centershavea single dominant plaza and court. 
In addition to the three primary centers, six secondary centers and one tertiary center have suf.cient preservation to permit analysis. We also include two subsidiary complexes within primary centersthathave ball courts.Thesetwo include one palatial platform with a court in its immediate cluster of mounds (mound 6309 complex at Nopiloa) and the already mentioned smallAzuzules border complex,Lobato. 
Southwest Tuxtla Mountains. From the Tuxtla Mountains we include three primary centers: Matacapan (Santley 2007), Teotepec (Phillip J. Arnold III, personal communication 2016; Thompson et al. 2009), and Totocapan (Stoner 2011). Research at Matacapan during the 1980s (Santley 2007; Santley et al. 1984; Santley et al. 1985)was followedbytheTuxtlas Regional Survey along the Catemaco River and north to the coast (Santley 1991; Santley and Arnold 1996). Ball courts are not abundant. Matacapan (Santley 2007),Chuniapan de Abajo, and possiblyChuniapande Arriba (León Estrada and Wilson 2015) are the only centers in the Catemacovalleywith architectural courts,along with Teotepec and Isla Tenagre in the Lake Catemaco basin (León Estrada and Wilson 2015;Santleyand Arnold1996)and Matacanela south of the lake (Venter 2014). The small ball court at Matacapan was constructed between AD 300 and 650. 
Two ball courts at Teotepec are among the Classic period architecture, with one forming the terminus of a plaza group that resembles

the Standard Plan described above but with a more elongated rectangular shape likethe “long­plaza group” found south and eastoftheTuxtla Mountains (Borstein 2001;Symonds et al.2002; Urcid and Killion 2008). Notably, Matacapan does not displayarchitectural arrangementsthat closely adhered to either of theseGulflowland patterns, perhaps re.ecting the foreign identity of its founding population(Santley 2007;Stoner and Pool 2015). 
Totocapan was mapped with compass, tape, and handheld GPS during the Tepango Valley Archaeological Survey (Stoner 2011). Later, Stoner obtained theLight Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) point cloud fromINEGI that permitted an accurate and detaileddigitalelevationmodule (DEM)for the central partofTotocapan (Stoner and Pool 2015:Figure8)2.Totocapan possesses four ball courts.The largest, used forthis anal­ysis, occupies the endofaStandardPlanplaza. Datingofthisarchitectural complexis uncertain, butTotocapanwasalmost completely abandoned bythebeginningoftheEarly Postclassic(ca.AD 900; Stoner 2011:292–295). The con.guration of mounds at the site resembles that of Mound Group2atTresZapotes (Pool 2008), whichwas likelybuilt sometimeafter 400 BC. 
ElsewhereintheTepangovalley,surveyiden­ti.ed single ball courts at the secondary centers of Tilzapote and Xiguipilincan and the tertiary center of Cruz de Vidaña. Tilzapote and Xigu­ipilincan reached their maximum sizes between AD 450 and 900. Both also had Postclassic occupations,but the ball courts were integrated into typical StandardPlan con.gurations.Cruz deVidaña reached its apogee 400–1 BC, raising the possibility that court constructionwas earlier than othersinthevalley. Onlysketch mapsexist forthesethree centers, so they areomitted from the viewshed analysis. The existence of ball courtsat secondary centersintheTepangovalley resembles the WLPB and the Catemaco River and Lake region. 
Visibility Methods 
As noted, we apply two methods to assess viewership but each relies on the same three categories of information: (1) the plaza area; 
(2) the prime viewing opportunities for courts: the tops of the .anking mounds, the open end zones and contiguous open space, and,if present, theinteriorsideof an end zone mound; and(3) secondary viewing areas located on the tops or sides of other structures that do not immediately surround the court. Recall that secondary view­ing is dubious because viewers may not have been permittedtoclimbthe platformsgiven the vulnerabilityoffacadesor sacredorprivatespace restrictions. Rarely, a mound with secondary viewingis positioned so that its presumed stair wouldafforda good viewof thegame (such as Figure3,Mound 1143, at Azuzules). 
In south-centralVeracruz, stone forarchitec­ture is lacking, and construction uses rammed earth or adobe blocks with earthen .ll(Daneels and Guerrero 2013). Consequently, with time, erosion creates a softened contour for mounds. Withoutexcavation,theoriginallevelofthe court playing alley, which traps erosional sediment, cannotbe determined, causingustoassume that itwasatthe samelevelasthe surrounding plaza. We correct the DEM court alley elevations to matchthe surrounding surfaces. 
Thewidthof the narrowplaying alleys can­not be estimated usefully because of erosional material, so we evaluate visibility to a center point.The GISviewshed calculations (M2) used a 1 m positive elevation offset from the court center to approximate the beltlevel of players, withtheideathatifviewers can seetobeltlevel, theycan followthegame.Inthe manual method (M1), secondary viewing was determined on graph paper for an arbitrary point representing the court center on theplaying alleysurface, with structures placed at an appropriate scaled dis­tance with theirscaled height.Each measurement methodhasvalid reasoning,buttheM1 method decreases secondary viewership slightly due to theuseofthe centerpointatthegroundsurface. 
For ball-court lines of sight over standing viewers, peoplewere1.5mhighinbothmethods. We limitedviewershipto100mdistanceinboth methods because of the dif.culty of seeing the game well at a greater distance. Increased dis­tance would mainlyincrease secondary viewer-ship from elevated positions on other structures. 
In the manual method (M1), capacities for peoplestanding alignedto seethegame(ontop of .anking mounds or across the end zones) reliedonsix peopleper linear meter(three people

Black rectangle indicates an area of primary viewers on an end mound. Dark gray rectangle (on Mound 1143) represents secondary viewers.

0.5m2.InGIS viewshed analyses, onlookersare represented by a random population of points to achievethe same density as plaza areas.The program automatically determines which have lines of sight. 
Both inward and outward viewsheds (M2) were calculated for ball courts for the six pri­mary centers(andTuzales; Figure4), although only the inward viewshed results to the cen­ter point of the ball court are tabulated here. Observation pointstoconduct inward viewsheds were constructed by randomly generating eight points per4 m2(2m × 2 m .shnet) requiring at least 0.3 m between points. This procedure results in the same crowd density as the manual calculations3.The pointsare then rasterized and givena heightof1.5mabovethegroundsurface with grid dimensions of 0.5 m × 0.5 m. The crowd-interference raster, which represents the bodiesofballgameviewers,is addedtothesite DEM. The observation points, perched atop the crowd “columns,” provide the input features to calculatevisibility usingthe “visibility”toolbox in ArcMap 10.2.2. Then, thefrequencyofobser­vation points that can see every raster square in theDEMis calculated (witha1 moffsetto simulate the beltlevelof ballgameplayers). 
The calculations were runtwice. The.rst run included allviewers withina 100mbuffer(i.e., bothprime and secondaryviewers). Thesecond run omitted secondary viewers from buildings not directly forming partofthe architectural ball court. 
PlazaCalculations 
For bothmethods,weused0.5m2and2m2 per person in order to assess two possibilities for maximum capacities. Plaza areas in the manual method (M1) were takenfrom polygons drawn on GIS “footprint” maps of centers (Mapinfo Professional 6.5).The rectilinear polygons were not closelyalignedagainstthe basesof structures in thesesimpli.ed maps,butintheGIS method (M2),the polygons were .ttedcloselyagainstthe base contours of structures, providing a better

Figure 4. Example of the GIS calculation of inward and outward viewsheds for Totocapan. Outward viewshed observation locations are represented by the shaded raster squares that expand out in fan-like shapes from the ball court. Each square represents one individual. The inward viewshed is represented by the continuous gray-scale gradient located within the ball court. For comparison to the manual method, inward viewshed values (in number of viewers) were recorded at only the central data collection point (triangle) within the ball court. 
estimate of maximum plaza area. The manual method allows more space forcirculationaround theplaza. Similarly, thelower packing .gureof 2m2 also permits more circulation. 
Discussion of Methods 
The calculations areinexact with bothmethods. We cannot assess plaza areas very precisely becausewelacktheexcavatededgesofstructures and must usetheireroded edges.Likewise, court viewingis based on theassumptionthat special wooden bleachers were not constructed. Any perishable roofed structures atop the .anking mounds of the court would affect some dis­tant lines of sight to the court and might also constrain viewership from the .anking mounds themselves.The highestranking individualson .anking moundsmayhavebeen seated,butthese details are notavailable and at mostwould adda small additional viewership if individuals could stand behind them. 
Annick Daneels (personal communication 2016) raised the question of whether prime viewers were mainly adult males. If so, plaza .gures for 0.5 m2 packing should be adjusted downwardby75%forthe purposesof comparing theexclusivityof ballgameviewership,assuming minimally onein four personswasanadultmale.

Results of Ballgame Viewership and Plaza 
Capacity Analysis 

Comparison of Methods 
Table1presentsthe plaza areas, capacities, and viewership data for prime and secondary loca-tions.Weuse ratiosofMethod2(viewsheds)to Method1(manual)toreadily highlight viewer-ship differences between themethods(Table2). Aratio above1indicates that M2 yields higher numbers of viewers. 
Forsolelyprimeviewers, manual calculations exceedtheGISviewshed calculationsin.veof theseven cases (ratioslessthan1);thetwo cases of higher GIS counts are due to the inclusion of people in neighboring plaza areas. The .ve higher manual values re.ect the use of packed linesofviewersaroundthe courtin contrastto the viewshed model of person-columns. 
As noted, we have great doubt that secondary viewing was generally permitted. For the most part, the viewshed approach yields more prime-plus-secondaryviewers.Inmost casesM2view­ership (prime and secondary) is close to two times themanual method,butfor CentralCerro de lasMesas-East, it is .ve times greater.This aberrant value is due to a much larger sec­ondaryviewership calculated for nearby mounds in viewshed analysis. In contrast, the manual method assumed that a single area of packed viewers on each mound precluded more distant viewers. This discrepancy in results is a good example of the advantages of viewshed anal­ysis over occasionally misleading assumptions when marking off secondary viewer areas in the manual method. In general, the systematic accuracyoftheviewshed calculationsis superior for secondary viewers. 
Method 2 to Method 1 ratios of plaza areas (Table2)showthat theeffortto bettermeasure maximum plaza area for the viewshed analysis produced up to 36% larger areas (therefore with ratios above 1). 
Degreeof Restrictionfor PrimeViewers Compared with PlazaCapacities 
Aratioof primeviewersto main plaza capacities (using 0.5 m2 per person) summarizes whether ball-court viewership was highly restricted in comparison to prominent public assembly space in each method(Figure5). The relationship of prime viewership to plaza capacity is prima facie unlikelytobe1 to1 because of the ball­courtarchitecture.Ahighratio, between 0.5 and 1, would suggest the courts served a sizable proportion of the maximum formal assembly capacity.Asthe ratio drops, ball courts become more exclusive. A ratio of 0.25 to 0.5 would still be fairly generous in serving people(e.g.,

Figure 5. Comparison of manual (M1) and GIS viewshed (M2) results for ratios of prime viewers to plaza capacities (people). The smaller the ratio, the more exclusive ballgame viewership. E indicates an end mound, and T indicates a transverse court. Cerro de las Mesas is abbreviated as CM. 
more than just elites). A ratio below 0.25 we de.ne as restricted access, whichisthe bracket that encompasses our prime ratios using 0.5 m2 packing. 
Thehighest observedratiois0.14forapartial Standard Plan plaza group in Central Cerro de lasMesas-East with theviewshed calculations, withTeotepec-East close behind at 0.12.With the manual method,thesoletertiary settlement,Coy­ote,is 0.13,andtwosmall “part” complexesthat arewithin primary centersare above 0.10. Thus, both third-order sites and “partial” settlement groups aremoreinclusivein ballgameviewing than most other groups. Other ratios are well below 0.10. 
Interestingly, estimates of the proportion of elites to nonelites in ancient societies do not deviatemarkedlyfromthe restrictiveproportions of prime ballgame viewership to total assembly sizein plazas.Michael Smith (personal commu­nication 2016) suggested sources for estimates of the proportions of elites in various societies (e.g., Bodley 2003:94, 98; Braudel 1982;Flan­nery 1983:136; Lenski 1966:219; Rojas 1986:97; Smith 1994:320;Tacoma 2006:94, 95).Arange from0.01to0.10 captures mostoftheestimates, not much different from our ratios of prime court viewership to maximum plaza capacity. One potential derailing factor, however, is that game viewers could change across a series of games(seeDiscussion and Conclusions). 
As noted, viewshed calculations were per­formed for primary centers in the WLPB and Tuxtlasareas,butthemanual methodwasapplied to all centers in the WLPB settlement hierar­chy(Figure5). Ratios ofprime viewership to plaza capacitiesfor bothprimary and secondary centersfallat or below 0.10, and .veare at or below 0.05. The ballgame was therefore much moreexclusivethan plaza assembliesregardless of settlement rank. 
We have expressed doubts about the validity of secondary viewing by people who climbed to vantage points on nearby structures. Neverthe­less, we provide information on the combined primary and secondary viewership for readers who do not want to discard this possibility (Table1). Secondaryviewers occasionally make total ballgame viewership fairly generous in public access, in some cases almost reaching 0.50, but the majority of courts have ratios in the restrictive bracket. 
Also, we expressed doubts that only men viewed the game, but we provide these data

(Table1).If,minimally, onein four peoplewere adult men, plaza capacities must be adjusted downward correspondinglyfor comparison. This adjustmentis thesameasthe less dense packing assumptionof one person per2 m2.Althougha coupleofratiosbarelypassthe0.50markto enter thebracket representingasizableproportionof plaza capacity,the other ratiosare approximately divided between the fairly generous bracket (0.25–0.50) and restrictivebracket(<0.25). 
DissectingResults fortheWestern Lower Papaloapan Basin Settlement Hierarchy 
Centersvaryintheirratiosofprime viewersto plaza capacities,butthevariation does not appear to be linked to the settlement hierarchy in the WLPB(Figure5). Primary and some secondary centershaveoverlapping rangesof scores,with no consistent relationships, given the sample size.Itis importantto disaggregatethe elements oftheratioto betterevaluatetheirexpressionin settlement hierarchies.In doing so,wediscover thatthesimilarityin ratiosislikelydueto archi­tectural canons becauseindividual measures dif­fer between primary and secondary(or lower) settlement ranks for(1) ball-courtlengths,(2) plaza sizes, and (3)prime viewer counts. 
WLPB ball-courtlengths (i.e., of thelongest .anking mound) areshorteratsecondary centers (Figure6)than primary centers (Azuzules and Nopiloa) duringthe Late Classic period. During the Early Classic period, the multiple courts at Cerro de las Mesas are similar to those of secondary centers. 
Primary centershavelarger main plazas than secondary centers(Figure7A), although some main plazas within CerrodelasMesas aresimilar to some secondary centers on this measure. Primary centers also have higher prime court viewership(Figure7B).To some extent,greater viewership is due to the addition ofend mounds at one of the Cerro de las Mesas courts and at the Nopiloa and Azuzules courts. Only one secondary center (Madereros) has an end mound. Viewership values at some of the additional courtsat CerrodelasMesas aresimilartothose of some secondary centers. 
In sum, primary centershavemoreresources, grander installations, and more prime game viewing than secondary (or tertiary) centers in this sample. These patterns for individual values help establish that ball courts vary in size, re.ectingthe prominenceofthesettlement, especiallyintheLateClassic period.Thedegree of repetition of the Standard Plan, with its tendency toward a square rather than elongated plaza, suggests a shared underlying concept of architectural ingredients and proper proportions. Theseproportionalities contribute to thelack of clear discrimination among ratios of ballgame viewing to plaza capacity for primary versus secondary centers. Smaller centers tended to maintain a reduced but consistent relationship among the various architectural elements. 
CountsofPrimeViewers and PlazaCapacities 
We brie.y examine individual measures for prime viewers and plaza capacities, which offer insights apartfromratios. Maximumprimeview­ership at theprimary centersiscalculated as 500– 2,000 people with the manual method and 300– 3,000 withviewshed analysis,butthelatterrange drops to 300–1,000 if the outlier of Totocapan is eliminated.Totocapanisexceptionallyhighin primeviewers becauseaslightlyelevatedplaying surface and upward sloping terrain permit more peopleinplaza areas to seethegame.Totocapan demonstrates that even subtle variation in the plans of urban architects can have dramatic effectsonpublicexperienceof ritualsandgames. 
With 0.5 m2 packing, the main plazas at primary centers could accommodate 6–40 × 103 peopleusingthe conservativevaluesintheman­ual method (M1) and 4–200 × 103 people using more complete area measurements done in M2; nevertheless, thehighestM2 value (Matacapan) is an extreme outlier. The quantity of 6 × 104 for Cerro de las Mesas-North is a more useful upper value for the M2 results, but even this plazaisamarkedoutlier comparedto other Cerro de las Mesas plazas and other primary centers (excluding Matacapan).It raisesthe possibility of an “overdesigned,” grandiose plaza with a capacity that likely exceeded population in the immediate area. 
With2m2 packing, the M1 plaza range for primary centers is 1–10 × 103 and M2 is within the same order of magnitude (Matacapan excluded).Withthis packing,CerrodelasMesas-North remains large compared to other primary

Discussion and Conclusions 
To summarize, we have evaluated the numbers of people relevant to two open-air facilities in the Gulf lowlands: ball courts and main plazas. Despite their public prominence and high accessibility in the site epicenters, they differ greatly in the numbers of people who could be accommodated to view events. Prime viewing of the ballgame was markedly lower in numbers of viewers compared to potential plaza assemblies. The presence of ball courts at both secondary and primary centers in the WLPB and southwestTuxtla Mountains suggests multiple points of sponsorship of facilities and games, and perhaps thus a degree of collec­tive action through secondary elites, rather than highly centralizedregimesprovidingonlyacourt at primary centers. In theWLPB, we noted that theratiosofballgameviewersto plaza capacities do not differ noticeably between primary and secondary centers, because proportionalities in architectural canons mask the greater invest­ments in higher-order centers when ratios are considered. 
The possibility of sequential court use requires consideration before we conclude that architectural courts were relatively exclusive compared to plazas on the basis of our calcu­lations. Perhaps any teamsorindividuals could practiceorplayat a formal court, taking turns, with only some games of ritual or political importance attendedbymore important members ofthesociety.The possibilityofsuch generalized use of formal courts cannot be ruled out, but anynoteworthy competitions likelywouldhave beenof interestto importantfamiliestowatch, in addition to the most ritually or politically prominentgames. Thus,evenwith rotational use, viewership limitations would have favored the privilegedoverthe general population. Theritual and sacred importanceoftheballgamediscussed above does not suggest casual,informal useof architectural courts. 
Consequently,the architectural ballgamemay have been particularly potent at integrating the upper echelonsof societyamongdifferent settle­mentsratherthanthegeneral populacewithinany single settlement. Possible .eld court games— not yet proven to have existed—with variable timing and personnel and open to community participation couldhaveachieved thewider inte­gration argued by Daneels(2008, 2016)for a

serve 10% (or less) of the people who could assembleinthemainplaza,orafairly generous proportion(upto 50%)ofplaza capacities,if less dense packing is favored. If prime view­ers were largely men, prime viewership ratios are likewise generally still not above 50% of main plaza (male segment) capacity, though some nonelites may be included. Given the limitationsof viewership,the formal courts, like civicbuildings or temples, were “place-making” institutions that established centers as the foci of governmental authority, ritual practices, and economic power—controlled and patronized by the upper social stratumormostpowerfulgroups. Wider ballgameinvolvement mayhavedepended on more indirect audience participation, on play in .eld courts, or perhaps on occasions when elitesdisplayed their generosityby opening the architectural courts to the populace. 
The Veracruz ballgame, like chunkey con­testsfor Cahokia(DeBoer 1993),wasintimately connected to important settlement and social hierarchies.Likemanyinstitutionsof social life, Mesoamerican architectural court games likely were subjectedtoadegreeof classandgovern­mental co-optationasleaders and rulers inserted themselves into rituals connectedtogameevents or becamethe patrons commissioning court con­structionand placement.Theextentto whichthis co-optation was successful varies by time and place in Mesoamerica. 
In south-central Veracruz and the Tuxtla Mountains, with well-distributed architectural courts in primary and secondary centers, co­optation of the game was less restrictive than in Oaxaca(Kowalewskietal. 1991)but never­theless appreciable(noteDaneels[2008, 2016] distinguishes centralized from segmentary poli­ties in her Cotaxtla survey, with the former having ball courts onlyatthe capital).Inkeeping with the observations of Daneels(2008, 2016), thegame generally served to integratedifferent settlements,butthe upper social echelons likely werebetterservedbyarchitectural courtsthanthe general population. Carved stone yokes, palmas, and hachas testifytoscarce ballgameritual gear in the Gulf lowlands, some of it rendered in carved ball-court reliefs at El Tajín in which prominentindividualsareshown.The possibility of .eld court games pursued more freely by all social classes is suggestive that, as with ritual practices,different levels of participation, kinds of participation, and even different asso­ciated material culture coexisted from popular to high status contexts.Despite theproliferation of courts in some Mesoamerican societies, such asin south-centralVeracruz, architectural courts retaineda connectiontogovernmental authority and class relations.

Notes 
1. 
For example, at Cerro de las Mesas, population esti­mates are fraught with uncertainties.Early ClassicCerrode las Mesashas thegreatestamountof surrounding residential survey. For many centers, we do not have enough survey to attempt population estimates. An initial estimate for its central delta surveyblock was approximately 4,000–10,000 (Stark 2003:401). Correcting for multiple homes around a patio on theresidential mounds andusing anaverageoftwo homes yields 8,000 to 20,000 people. Although people in mostofthe central blockcouldreach Cerrodelas Mesaswith a5to10kmwalk,itsurelyhad boundaries;withoneboundary proposal (Stark 2014a), the center encompasses 41% of the central block, implyinga populationrangeof 3,280to 8,200 people. StarkandGarraty(2008:193) estimate approximately 30% morelowresidential features(i.e., <2m high) were not detected. Because 75% of features are below 2 m, another 4,950 mayhaveexisted,but an unknown proportionwould be EarlyClassicand within thesettlement. 

2. 
TheINEGI LiDARpoint cloudisof poor spatial res­olutioncomparedtocontemporaryLiDAR data,butbecause themajorityofTotocapanisin cattle pasturewithvegetation no taller than5 cm, thedata recordeven minor changesin elevation acrossthe site. 

3. 
During the conversion from observation points to raster columns 1.5 m tall (used to simulate the bodies of the crowd as barriers to visibility), about 10% of the total possible observer points were eliminated.
