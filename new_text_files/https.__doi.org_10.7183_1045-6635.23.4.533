
LAGOA SANTA REVISITED: AN OVERVIEW OF THE CHRONOLOGY, 
SUBSISTENCE, AND MATERIAL CULTURE OF PALEO INDIAN SITES 
IN EASTERN CENTRAL BRAZIL 

Astolfo G. M. Araujo, Walter A. Neves, and Renato Kipnis 
Lagoa Santa, a karstic area in eastern Central Brazil, has been subject to research on human paleontology and archaeol­ogy j(Jr 175 years. Almost 300 Paleoindian human skeletons have been found since Danish naturalist Peter Lund's pio­neering work. Even so, some critical issues such as the role of rockshelter.1 in settlement systems, and the possible paleoclimatic implications (){the peopling of the region have yet to be addressed. We present some results obtained from recent excava­
tions at.f(Jur rockshelters and two open-air sites, new dates for human Paleoindian skeletons, and a model to explain the cultural patterns observed so far. It is also argued that the Paleoindian subsistence system at Lagoa Santa was similar to other locations in South America: generalized small-game hunting complemented by fruits, seed, and root gathering. 
Lagoa Santa, un area kdrstica en Brasil Central, ha sido objeto de investigaci6n en paleontologfa humana y arqueologfa durante 170 afios. Casi 300 esqueletos humanos paleoindios se han encontrado desde que el natural is ta dinamarques Peter Lund empezd su trabajo pionero en la mitad de! siglo XIX. Sin embargo, problemas crfticos como el papel de las cuevas en /os patrones de asentamiento y las posibles implicaciones paleoclimdticas en el poblamiento def area todav[a tienen que ser mejor estudiados. Nosotrospresentamos los resultados obtenidos de las recientes excavaciones de cuatro cuevas y dos yacimien­tos a cielo abierto, nuevasfeches de esqueletos humanos paleoindios, y un mode lo para explicar los patrones culturales obser­vados. Tambien propone mas que el sistema de subsistencia paleoindio en Lagoa Santa Jue, as[ coma en otros sitios de Sudamerica, bastante generalizado, incluyendo la caza de pequefios animales y la recoleccidn de frutos, semillas y ra(ces. 
he Lagoa Santa region is a karstic area Tencompassing several counties near the city of Belo Horizonte, State of Minas Gerais (Figure I). The geological setting comprises mainly Upper Pre-Cambrian metasedimentary rocks of the Bambuf Group (Instituto Brasileiro do Meio Ambiente and Centro de Pesquisas de Recursos Minerais [IBAMA/CPRM] 1998). The Bambuf Group is composed of a basal metacal­careous body-Sete Lagoas Formation-and an upper metapelitic formation called Serra de Santa Helena Formation. Hydrothermal solutions cut­ting the Pre-Cambrian rock bodies produced siliceous veins and geodes, many of them with hyaline quartz that were heavily used as raw mate­rials by the local Paleoindians. Weathering of Serra 
de Santa Helena Formation produces most oxisols found in the region (Pil6 1998), whereas the Sete Lagoas Formation limestones, because of their purity, are almost completely leached, forming caves, dolines, and other karstic features. 
Vegetation today comprises patches of savanna ("cerrado"), and deciduous ("mata seca") and semi­deciduous forests (Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatistica [IBGE] 1992). 
This is one of the most widely known archaeo­logical regions of Brazil, and a key area for under­standing the peopling of the Americas. Thanks to the Danish naturalist Peter W. Lund, who visited several hundreds and excavated many dozens of rockshelters and caves during the mid-nineteenth century, Lagoa Santa became internationally

known as the first place in the Americas where the co-occurrence of humans and extinct animals was thought to deserve further investigations (Walter 1948:21, 1958:106). 
Lund also realized that the human skeletons found in Sumidouro cave were not "typical Amerindians," now a well-accepted assertion among biological anthropologists (Chatters et al. 1999; Hub be et al. 2010; Jantz and Owsley 2001; Neves and Hubbe 2005; Neves et al. 2007; Neves, Powell, and Ozolins 1999; Neves and Pucciarelli 1989, 1991; Powell and Neves 1999; Steele and Powell 1992). 
After Lund's death in 1880, the interest in the region decreased somewhat, with excavations being resumed only in the beginning of the twen­tieth century, mostly by other naturalists and ama­teurs (see Mello e Al vim et al. 1977 and Neves and Pil6 2008 for a more detailed account of previous research in the region). 
In the 1950s, Wesley Hurt and Oldemar Blasi carried out the first professional diggings in Lagoa Santa. Their primary goal was to test the long-held idea of the co-occurrence in time of humans and megafauna in the region, as suggested by Lund in 1844, using standard archaeological procedures for the first time. 
Lapa das Boleiras and Cerca Grande VI rock­shelters were the most prominent sites excavated by Hurt and Blasi (1 969). In Cerca Grande VI, they generated the first absolute dates for the region (around 9700 B.P., or 1 1 ,200 cal B.P.), which cor­roborated the hypothesis that humans were in Lagoa Santa at least since the beginning of the Holocene. However, by the end of their research, both scholars were very skeptical about the con­temporaneity between humans and megafauna in Lagoa Santa, because no skeletal remains of extinct animals were found in the sites they excavated. 
Between 1971 and 1976, a French Brazilian team carried out large scale archaeological inves­tigations in Lagoa Santa.Anette Laming-Emperaire and associates were responsible for the excavation at Lapa Vermelha IV rockshelter (Laming­Emperaire et al. 1975). It was only with the exca­vations at Lapa Vermelha IV that a human occupation extending back to the Late Pleistocene was formally suggested for Lagoa Santa. Further­more, the issue regarding the contemporaneity between humans and extinct fauna in the region was

resurrected by the French Brazilian mission: bones and dung of a small ground sloth ( Catonyx cuvieri) were found at Lapa Vermelha IV at levels dating back to 9580 ± 200 (GIF 3208; wood charcoal; 11,450 to 10,250 cal B.P.), while a human skele­ton (Lapa Vermelha IV Hominid 1 , or "Luzia") was found in layers dating to between 10 ,220 ± 220 and 11 ,680 ± 500 radiocarbon years B .P. ( 11,264 to 15,145 cal B.P. [Laming-Emperaire et al. 1975; Prous 1986; Prous and Foga9a 1999]). Later the "Luzia" human remains were directly dated (bone collagen) by AMS, resulting in a minimum age of 9330 ± 60 (Beta 84439; bone collagen; 10,298 to 10,701 cal B.P.-Neves et al. 1998; Neves, Pow­ell, and Ozolins 1999; Neves, Powell, Prous, et al. 
1999). Since then, despite the capital importance of Lagoa Santa for the understanding of the peo­pling of the Americas, no large-scale archaeologi­cal operation was carried out in the region (but see Prous et al. 1998 for a more recent comprehensive site inventory for the area). 
In 2000, a long-term paleoanthropological pro­ject headed by one of us (WAN), was initiated in the region. Three limestone rockshelters, Lapa das Boleiras, Cerca Grande VI, and Lapa do Santo were chosen as focal sites, with excavations beginning in 200 1 ; the first two because the work carried out by Hurt and Blasi (1 969) revealed the occurrence of early human skeletal remains; the third because of its excellent preservation (most archaeological sites in Lagoa Santa are seriously damaged by ama­teur excavations and/or limestone commercial min­ing). A fourth limestone rockshelter, Lapa Grande de Taquara9u, was excavated later, starting in 2003, to assess the role of water availability in the human settlement choices. 
In 2004, we started the excavation of a paleon­tological site, named Cuvieri Cave, to have a bet­ter grasp of the fauna! response to climatic changes, and assess the chronology and relationship between humans and megafauna. After 2005, our efforts were also directed toward finding and characteriz­ing early open-air sites, because the well-estab­lished chronology obtained inside the rockshelters had no correlate outside. By means of an intensive subsurface prospection program, we were able to detect two Paleoindian sites on the shores ofSum­idouro Lake, named Sumidouro and Coqueirinho. 
In this article, we present the results of our inves­tigations and elaborate on their implications for long-held discussions about the Paleoindians 1 of Lagoa Santa. A tentative model, relating cultural, biological, and environmental pieces of evidence, is also suggested as a framework to help the orga­nization of future work in the area, and as a heuris­tic device to advance the interpretation of the local archaeological record. 
Lapa das Boleiras Rockshelter 
Lapa das Boleiras is part of a limestone outcrop fac­ing two sinkholes, one of them active today as a swallet of an intermittent stream. The sheltered area is 43 m Jong and 12 m wide, aligned roughly north-south, with an area of 280 m2 (Figure 2). The shelter's mouth faces west, and its floor is slightly inclined (12 percent) toward the north. A colluvial fan can be observed to bring red colluvial material from above the outcrop into the southern portion of the sheltered area. 
The site was first excavated by avocational archaeologists in the early twentieth century and later by a team of professional archaeologists in 1956 (Hurt and Blasi 1969). Between 2001 and 2003, our team excavated a total of 21 m3. Excavations detected generally well-stratified human burials, abundant lithic and bone artifacts, and common fau­na] and plant remains. The stratigraphy, chronology, and formation processes at the site are discussed at length elsewhere (Araujo et al. 2008). The Paleoin­dian occupation was dated both by radiocarbon and OSL, with ages ranging between 10,150 ± 130 B.P. (Beta 168451; wood charcoal; 12,380 to 11,240 cal B .P.) and 7 560 ± 110 B .P. (Beta 15924 3; wood char­coal; 8560 to 8160 calB.P.)(seeTable 1 for details). 
Lapa do Santo Rockshelter 
Lapa do Santo is a sheltered entrance of a cave, 70 m long and 20 m wide, with its mouth opening toward the west, and comprising an area of 1,300 m2 (Figure 3). The site is very well preserved, because treasure hunters, naturalists, amateurs, and professional archaeologists never carried out any kind of intrusive activities inside the rockshelter. At the time of our first visit to the Lapa do Santo, fragmented human bones could be found at the sur­face, exposed by water dripping from the roof. The site began to be excavated in 2001, and works ter­minated in 2009.

An area of 44 m2 was excavated. The site showed a deep stratigraphy, reaching more than 4 min its deepest portion. The sediments, although not yet subject to more detailed geochemical and micromorphological studies, bear a strong resem­blance to those of Lapa das Boleiras. In both cases the archaeological package is composed mainly of debris related to anthropogenic activities (mostly wood ash, see Araujo et al. 2008). Sixty-two radio­carbon ages were obtained for this site. Ages for the Paleoindian occupation range between 10,490 ± 50 B.P. (Beta 280489; wood charcoal; I 2,680 to 12,350caJB.P., 12,320to 12,240ca1B.P.)and7890 ± 40 B.P. (Beta 214142; wood charcoal; 8970 to 8910 cal B.P., 8870 to 8830 cal B.P., and 8790 to 8590 cal B.P.)

At the time of our intervention, the sediment at the rockshelter seemed to have been completely removed, with the possible exception of a small par­cel underneath a limestone boulder. Four units were dug inside the shelter, another three outside the sheltered area. Our excavations confirmed that the original stratigraphy of the site had been seriously disturbed, and deserved no further excavations. The only sign of human occupation found outside the sheltered area was a unifacial tool ("limace"), on the surface, with no stratigraphic context. 
Lapa Grande de Taquara\;U Rockshelter 
This rockshelter is located in a somewhat different setting, in an isolated limestone outcrop, outside the main karstic area, and close to a major river. The site is 30 m long and 9 m wide, opening toward the west, with a sheltered area of255 m2. The exca­vated area comprises 7 m2• The archaeological sed­iments at Taquaral(U showed the same pattern observed both at Lapa das Boleiras and Lapa do Santo: they are mainly anthropogenic, composed almost totally of wood ash, albeit in some levels with a very small silt and clay contribution from the adjacent river. The archaeological stratigraphy reaches a maximum depth of 1 m. Ages obtained for the Paleoindian levels range between 9990 ± 60 B.P. B.P. (!1,750 to 11,250 cal B.P.) and 8080 ± 40 B.P. (9050 to 8990 cal B.P.) (Table 4).
