perspective, the social value and importance of obsidian goods as symbolically loaded items is demonstrated through an examination of context, technology, and arti­fact morphology. More of these detailed kinds of analyses are needed throughout Mesoamerican archaeology. 
In the third section, focused on interpretation, Car­ballo concentrates on a single deposit discovered through his investigations at La Laguna, Tlaxcala. Importantly, Carballo applies a semiotic approach to an obsidian cache from the site, a method that I believe is essential to better understanding these complex cache deposits in Western and Eastern Mesoamerica alike, from all time periods. This cache, which contains what can only be called unique obsidian eccentrics, was nevertheless deposited in a fashion typical of Mesoamerican caches. He further uses iconographic analysis to place the eccentrics in a symbolic continuum within obsidian and flint eccentric traditions from the Maya Lowlands and Central Mexico. These one-off pieces suggest to me that the knappers at this site may have had other influences, perhaps from places located to the east, in Veracruz. Stemp and Awe use use-wear analysis in a strong interpretation of obsid­ian blades from cave contexts in Belize. Moving beyond simple artifact counts and broad generalizations, Stemp and Awe explore the possible religious context of caves in Maya and Mesoamerican thought. Furthermore, they conduct micro-wear analysis of the blades to determine how the blades may have actually been employed; while the blades may have been used in a variety of ways, their transport to cave contexts was likely for sacrificial or rit­ual purposes. 
Although the Puche et al. chapter on Xochitecatl­Cacaxtla might fit better in the previous section because it focuses on distributional analyses and more general interpretations of production and use, it is a valuable contribution for its integration of multiple artifact types and their association with what appear to be obsidian bloodletters. The authors make a good argument that the needles and punches were not used for utilitarian pur­poses, since they are not associated with typical blades and debitage common in household middens, but rather were used in ancestor worship and perhaps agricultural rites. These Epiclassic data fill a gap in our knowledge from these sites, which in many other ways seem to con­stitute a bridge between Maya and Central Mexican artis­tic and cultural traditions. 
Parry ties the volume together nicely with decades of expertise on Central Mexican chipped-stone traditions. This chapter, however, reveals a Central Mexican bias in what is supposed to be a Pan-Mesoamerican compi­lation, with most of his comparative analysis focused on Teotihuacan and Aztec archaeology. From a largely func­tionalist perspective, Parry's contribution provides a sobering critique of how far we can correlate the rather spotty ethnographic and ethnohistorical records with the archaeological record, (e.g., the ancient value of obsidian and its associated symbolic and iconic meanings). Per­haps the most valuable aspect of Parry's chapter is his discussion of obsidian in mortuary contexts at Teotihua­can, which synthesizes previous studies, some not pub­lished in English, in a concise manner. Overall, the volume represents movement in a positive direction for obsidian studies and should be necessary reading for Mesoamerican archaeologists in general.

This handsome volume represents the results of excava­tions carried out between 2000 and 2005 in a large num­ber of early burial sites located in the Mascota Valley of northwest Jalisco, about 60 km east of Puerto Vallarta. Discovered on the slopes of a low hill by a local farmer while bulldozing his field for a maize silo, the site of El Pantano proved to be a village cemetery with no fewer than 39 burial pits, representing the interment of about 175 individuals, with abundant burial offerings. El Embocadero II, another cemetery of the same age as El Pantano, was located some 10 km to the southwest; it had once consisted of many shaft-and-chamber tombs, but had been seriously looted before the archaeologists arrived to conduct salvage excavations.A third site, also heavily looted, was Los Coamajales, located further up the Mascota Valley, not far from the town of Mascota. 
Mountjoy places these three sites in his Middle For­mative period, which he defines as extending from 1200 to 300 B.C., with three subdivisions: (1) Initial Olmec, 1200-900 B.C. (San Lorenzo); (2) Intermediate Olmec, 900-600 B.C. (La Venta); and (3) Terminal Olmec,600­300 B .C. (Tres Zapotes). This, of course, is only a chrono­logical ordering.as there is nothing that can be identified as Olmec or even Olmecoid in any Jalisco site. In con­trast, most archaeologists dealing with Olmec and Maya would fix the beginning of the Middle Formative at about 900 B.C., with the demise of San Lorenzo and the sub­sequent rise of La Venta and lowland Maya monumental. Six calibrated radiocarbon dates from El Pantanal and two from Los Coamajales firmly establish that these cemeteries were in active use from ca. 900 to 600 B.C. 
A wide variety of burial types is present in the skeletal remains. Many burials were single and extended, while other pits contained anywhere from two to as many as 12 individuals. Some were secondary "bundle" burials, in which the bones had probably been wrapped in matting before being deposited. The detailed osteological analy-

sis of these shows that the teeth of early farmers in the Mascota Valley were in appalling condition at the time of death, often riddled with caries and even abscesses. There must have been much suffering in their lives. As for life spans, most of these individuals had died in what we would consider young adulthood. 
Accompanying these burials were lavish offerings of pottery vessels, clay figurines, and stone artifacts. The figurines are astonishingly simple, even crude, compared to what one finds in Middle Formative sites further south­east in Mesoamerica. In fact, while lively and forceful, they are completely outside any Mesoamerican tradition, and if they had not been found in context, most art his­torians would label them as fakes! They have been mod­eled to show both male and female nude figures standing, squatting on the ground, or seated pensively on four­legged stools. 
The pottery vessels, on the other hand, are highly sophisticated and inventive, in particular the amazing variety of bottle shapes. The necks of some of these bot­tles have been modeled to represent another small, restricted-mouth jar perched on top and, in one case, even a vertical penis. There are a few animal-effigy ves­sels. Perhaps of most interest to diffusion-minded archae­ologists (like myself) are the rare stirrup-spout vessels, strikingly similar to Initial-period Cupisnique bottles from the North Coast of Peru. 
The non-ceramic artifacts in burial offerings show that these Mascota people were far from simple. From the well-known source at Ixtlan de! Rio, Nayarit, they imported obsidian for the manufacture of scrapers and finely chipped stemmed dart points (these in a shape that would be called "Marcos" if they had been found in Texas). There were cruciform ornaments of iron pyrites and obsidian, finely worked rock crystal, and even jade beads; according to the author, these latter were fashioned from the green jade known for the Motagua Valley in Guatemala. 
Jn a final chapter, Mountjoy convincingly relates this Mascota funerary culture to the site of Capacha, Colima, excavated in 1939 by Isabel T. Kelly. As he has noted before, the type site is poorly dated, but it may well be coeval with, or slightly earlier than, the Mascota sites. Yet there can be no doubt that its exuberant pottery tra­dition, which included double and triple spouts connected to several vessel shapes at once and even stirrup spouts, is part of a more widespread shaft-and-chamber tomb culture extending along much of the Pacific-facing coastal zone of western Mexico. There are also links with the shaft tomb culture of El Opefio, Michoacan, which in turn is linked with Tlatilco in the Valley of Mexico. Unfortunately, unlike the case for dating Mas­cota, both Capacha and El Opefio suffer from a lack of reliable radiocarbon dates As for Tlatilco, it is almost certainly on the same time level as San Lorenzo. 
Mountjoy also ranges more widely in seeking out relationships and long-distance connections, as have other archaeologists before him. The possible connection with Formative cultures in the Guayas Basin of Ecuador is the most frequently cited, in particular Machalilla. Ironically, at one time more than a few archaeologists had proposed that Machalilla and the subsequent Chorre­ra culture had originated in Mesoamerica, rather than the other way around. Mountjoy examines the possibility of early maritime voyages between the two areas. To an archaeologist mainly concerned with the peoples of cen­tral and southeastern Mesoamerica, the Formative culture discovered here by Mountjoy barely qualifies, if at all, to be labeled "Mesoamerican." Did it originate in South America? In my opinion, the question still remains open. 
I have said that this is a handsome book. Every single pow (burial pit) and all of the associated artifacts are shown in excellent color photographs, beautifully printed on coated paper. In the present day, when the illustrations in most North American excavation reports appear only in smudgy black and white, this publication is a pleasure to see and read. However, having said this, I regret the nearly total lack of line drawings to illustrate the many burials and the artifacts. While descriptions of these are given in fine detail, the reader needs visual scales. As it stands, there is seldom any indication of the dimensions of whole vessels, figurines, or non-pottery artifacts.

Drought has been at the forefront of arguments regarding the so-called Maya "collapse" for about two decades and has been incredibly popular in public conceptions of the Maya since the publication of Richardson Gill's The Great Maya Droughts (2000).At the 2009 SAA meetings in Atlanta, Gyles Iannone assembled a group of scholars with transdisciplinary backgrounds to assess the true impact of droughts on the ancient Maya, not only during the Terminal Classic period, but also during other critical periods for which Gill proposed that drought had shaped the trajectory of civilizational development. lannone's edited volume is a welcome critical response to a theory that has become entrenched in the scholarly and public imagination.
