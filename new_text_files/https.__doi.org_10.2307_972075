argued that West Mexico was insulated from Mesoamerica. Given that West Mexico exhibits persistent South American traits that the rest of Mesoamerica does not share, however, these deviations cannot simply be defined away. 
Pollard also cites evidence for the use of long skirts in West Mexico. Because this was the norm in Mesoamerica, it is not surprising that West Mexico would reflect this practice as well. The puzzling-and operative-anomaly is that the Tarascan elite, as depicted in the Relacion de Mich­oaciin (1956), did not; even the Aztecs commented on their strange attire, which has parallels only in Ecuador. Pollard also asserts that all studies show mesoamerican pipes to be relatively similar. I refer the reader to Porter ( 1948:238, 240-241) regarding the unique and intrusive nature of long­stemmed Michoacan elbow pipes around A.D. 1100, and Meggers (1966:98) for Ecuadorean elbow pipes as early as 500 B.C.-A.D. 500. 
More substantive is the evidence Pollard introduces for similarities between the Tarascan and Chibchan language groups, but this would seem, if anything, to support the idea of early cultural exchange between West Mexico and northern South America. Although Pollard appears to accept such contacts at various points in prehistory, she objects to the suggestion of sustained cultural influence because of the absence of an entire, unbroken culture sequence from Archaic times up to the Late Postclassic Tarascans. Given the present state of West Mexican archaeology, no one could possibly demonstrate a continuous cultural tradition in that still largely unexplored area. 
Pollard flatters me with the suggestion that I have invented an "origin" myth for West Mexico. This would be an overstatement even if I were the only scholar to demonstrate West Mexico­Ecuador connections. Given the weight of existing evidence, however-e.g., similar metallurgy, mortuary practices, ceramic techniques, design motifs-there can be little doubt that such contact took place. How often, precisely when, via what mechanisms, and with what impact remain to be worked out. My modest contribution serves to reinforce prior contact studies by adding a new category: clothing similarities.
