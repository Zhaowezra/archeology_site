IDEOLOGICAL PATHWAYS TO ECONOMIC EXCHANGE: 
RELIGION, ECONOMY, AND LEGITIMATION AT, THE 
CLASSIC MAYA ROYAL CAPITAL OF CANCUEN 

Arthur A. Demarest 
The royal port of Cancuen was a major economic exchange center controlling the nexus of the river and land transport routes between the Maya highlands and lowlands, as well as to the Gulf of Mexico. Given its lack of temples, moderate size, and near absence of direct military activities, it would appear to have been an almost exclusively economic power. How­ever, recent theory has emphasized the seamless connection of ideology and economics. Cancuen provides good examples of the variety of mechanisms of legitimation and control, showing the interactive nature of ideology, ritual, coercion, and economic power. The case of Cancuen is especially illustrative because of the direct nature of its economic resource con­trol and the wide variety of ideological mechanisms used to channel the perceptions and behavior of a broad class of social actors. Furthermore, each mechanism of legitimation appears targeted at a specific aspect of the exchange system. The pat­terns exemplify the nature of interactions in the Classic period and the devices linking economic rights and ideology. 
El puerto de Cancuen era un centro economico, que controlaba el acceso a las rutas terrestres del Altiplano ya las rutasflu­viales del rfo La Pasion. Ambas eran crfticas para el transporte y el intercambio entre las Tierras Bajas, el Altiplano, y las estados del Golfo de Mexico. Dado que Cancuen carece de templos, que tiene un tamaiio moderado y que hay pocas eviden­cias de que se haya involucrado directamente en actividades militares, parecerfa que funcionaba casi exclusivamente como un poder economico. Sin embargo, la teor{a recientemente desarrollada ha enfatizado lafluida conexion entre la ideologfa y la economfa. Cancuen provee excelentes ejemplos del uso de una variedad de mecanismos de legitimacion y de control, que muestran la naturaleza interactiva de la ideologfa, el ritual, la coercion y el poder economico . El caso de Cancuen es espe­cialmente ilustrativo par la naturaleza claramente economica que se observa en el control de sus recursos y par una variedad de estrategias que uso para canalizar las percepciones y el comportamiento de una amplia gama de actores sociales. Es mas, cada uno de las mecanismos de legitimacion que uso parece haber apuntado a un aspecto especifico del sistema de inter­cambio. Los patrones descubiertos ejemplifican la naturaleza de las interacciones en el perfodo Cldsico y las dispositivos que ligaban las derechos economicos y la ideologfa.

that religious systems can actually sometimes struc­ture the relations of production (e.g., Godelier 1978). More recently, the model of "ritual econ­omy" has been proposed as applicable to many aspects of the economy (Wells 2006; Wells and McAnany 2012). Both the concepts of "legitima­tion" and "ritual economy" can yield insights on specific aspects of social practice. The concept of "legitimation" is most useful in cases where reli­gious belief or institutions are created or manipu­lated to economically privilege elites. As discussed below, "ritual economy" best applies to character­izing ritual events that have identifiable economic or ecological consequences (e.g.,Rappaport 1999; Wells 2006). 
However, I do not see either of these models as an overarching paradigm for the varied relation­ships of ideology and economy. It is possible that more case studies, such as those presented here, might inductively help construct a truly useful gen­eral approach. "Legitimation" has inevitable con­notations of economic primacy and of conscious exploitation by cynical elites. Nonetheless, I use "legitimation" in this article because it seems to be applicable to most ideological mechanisms used at the site ofCancuen in particular-and for that site, even its connotations might be appropriate. With "ritual economy" the problem can be the great breadth to which the concept is actually applied, with ritual seen as the "basic social act" that includes most aspects of both performance and ide­ology in both "sacred and secular forms" (e.g.,Wells and Davis-Salazar 2007; Wells and McAnany 2012). Following Rappaport's definition (1999:23-24), I believe that the concept of "ritual" is more meaningful if limited to a sequence of par­ticular formal acts (i.e., actual performance) with symbolic and sacred associations. I would use the term "religion" more broadly as covering a poly­thetic set of particular beliefs, as well as associated practices. "Ideology" is the most general term, referring to any aspect of symbolic systems, ritual, religion, or belief, and to associated features of pol­itics or economy (e.g.,Flannery and Marcus 1993). All of these terms are useful in specific applica­tions, but only if their meaning is clarified. 
Another very broad approach to these issues, one that comes from a different, primarily eco­nomic, perspective is that proposed by Hirth ( 1996) in considering general "principles of political econ­omy." With these economic principles, he sought to understand economy rather than ideology. Hirth ( 1996:221-224) would structure analyses of polit­ical economy with four principles: ( 1) the "accu­mulation principle" examines the universal feature that economies permit the accumulation of strate­gic resources, (2) the "context principle" concerns "where and how resource accumulation takes place," and (3) his "matrix-control principle" exam­ines how elites control resource-accumulation "net­works by placing themselves at major matrix positions to influence directly or indirectly the pro­duction, accumulation, and flow of resources." Both the context and matrix control principle apply well in the specific case of the port center of Cancuen -the case study considered here-where elite control of port and exchange contexts were the key to differential accumulation. 
Most relevant here is Hirth's fourth "ideology principle." Hirth was interested in how the work­ings of ideology are needed to control critical posi­tions and resources. In Hirth's structured approach to political economy, a necessary element is "an eco­nomic ideology that reinforces both the basis for unequal accumulation of resources and the struc­ture in which it occurs" (Hirth 1996:225). In terms of such principles, "all resource accumulations also are rationalized in terms of end usages that are usu­ally expressed with reference to the population's general wellbeing" (Hirth 1996:225). This princi­ple reminds us of an obvious fact, sometimes over­looked in thinking on political economy: Power in the economic terms of control of either the means or the relations of production is not a given. It must be accepted by most members of a community that certain individuals or groups have the right of pos­session or usage of both critical resource contexts and matrix positions. While it could be argued that coercive force was often the means of possession orusage, the control of that coercive policing or mil­itary force must itself be accepted and justified by ideological principles. Although not couched in those terms, Hirth's ideology principle fits well with practice and power theories that see agency at all levels of society, requiring some degree of accep­tance of inequalities. 
In terms of "legitimation," economic ideology is where elite agency is most easily exerted: "It is in this arena that elites promote the development of new ideologies ... that provide a basis for them

to shape belief about both the demand for resources and the specific use for which they are collected" (Hirth 1996:226). The utility of Hirth's paradigm is that it is integrated into a specifically economic model that encourages us to identify aspects of ide­ology that justify differences in power over criti­cal positions in the economic system. I also doubt that this constitutes a final universal model, but it is one that works very well for the specific system described here, and I believe it does have broad applicability. 
Some Ideological Sources of Ancient Maya 
Elite Economic Power 

Following general trends in anthropology, many archaeologists have proposed more central roles for ideology in economic and political power in Mesoamerica (e.g., Clark 2004; DeMarais et al. 
1996; Demarest 1992; Flannery and Marcus 1993; Freidel 1981 a; Freidel et al. 2002; Helms 1993; Ino­mata 2001; Schortman et al. 2001). In archaeology of the Maya civilization, such recent trends can be attributed in part to new evidence and intense debate on the very nature of Classic Maya economy-with often conflicting interpretations regarding exchange, markets , and specialization (e.g., Aoyama 2001; Braswell 2010; Chase and Chase 2001 , 2004; Dahlin 2009; Demarest 2012; Lucero 2006; Masson and Freidel 2013; Rice 2009; Shaw 2012). Study of connections between Clas­sic Maya ideology and economy are especially promising, given the fine detail we already have on Maya religion and ritual. 
Without being in anyway exhaustive, it is worth considering some of the specific ways that religion and ritual were important to Classic Maya elite economic power. Numerous examples have been provided by archaeologists and epigraphers, and some of these have been extrapolated as general characteristics of Maya ideology and economics. Many of these mechanisms were present in Late Classic Cancuen. 
The most important of these economic rights, although seldom explicitly discussed, was local tithing in products or labor to the royals, nobles, and their courts. Tribute associated with warfare and conquest certainly was an important source of resources, particularly for Maya royal courts 
(e.g., McAnany 2010:270-304; 2013). Still, in most Maya states, the major sources for food, goods, and labor were religious in nature. The acceptance of rulers ' right to possess and use such tribute exemplified an economic ideology that had to be maintained. 
As McAnany (1998) points out, much of the built environment of the epicenters of Classic Maya sites manifested the ruler's right to tribute in food­stuffs and labor from the local sustaining popula­tions and vassal zones. Especially prominent were the impressive temple and plaza complexes that dominate Classic Maya epicenters. These served as the setting for grand and expensive ceremonies in which the ruler, k'uhul ajaw, was the principal actor. The details of these ceremonies are well known from texts and iconography. Sacred asso­ciations that were more accessible to the general non-literate population were created by the place­ment of these structures with specific directions (e.g., Ashmore and Sabloff 2002) or with sacred features of the natural landscape (e.g., Brady 1997; Demarest et al. 2003). Stucco and stone sculpture provided further symbolic details for this built envi­ronment, stages for events that associated rulers with deities, ancestors, cycles of time, and sacred realms. The public ceremonies and their physical settings had effects in terms of social solidarity, internal elite competition, and external status rivalry with other centers. However, from a purely economic perspective, their principal importance was "to justify and legitimize the differential accu­mulation and use of resources for nondomestic pur­poses by specific individuals" (Hirth 1996:225) . 
One model for this right to tribute in labor or goods is that of the "theater state" proposed for southeastAsia by Geertz (e.g., 1980).Adiachronic dynamic for this model was added by Tambiah (1977) in terms ofunstable "galactic polities" (see also Higham 2001:164--166). Geertz consciously hyperbolized his model to make the point that ide­ology and ceremony could be a direct source of power, not merely a legitimation of authority that was really based on economic resources or coer­cion. It was an assertion needing emphasis at that time, given the then-dominance of materialist, eco­logical, and evolutionary approaches. In a similar vein, I stressed this aspect of Classic Maya polities to underscore the role of ritual and religion as a direct source of ancient Maya material power (Demarest 1992, 2004:206-207, 215-217; Ham-

mond 1991). However, in southeast Asia, there were other sources of power, such as elite direc­tion in warfare, exchange systems, and infrastruc­ture (e.g., Geertz 1980; Higham 2001). Similarly, for the Classic Maya, we have growing detail on elite economic and political power derived from involvement (in widely varying degrees) in field systems, hydraulics, markets, and/or tribute war­fare (e.g., Chase and Chase 2001, 2004: Dahlin 2009; Masson and Freidel 2013; McAnany 2010:269-304; Scarborough et al. 2003). 
The theater state model is now best understood as a central element of ideology, politics, and eco­nomics of almost all Classic Maya states, but not a "type" of state or political organization. This the­ater state aspect of Classic Maya polities was a central element in the legitimation of other sources of power, including economic control. It provided the economic ideology establishing in the most general terms the right of rulers and elites to usage, control, or claims of control over hydraulic systems, the labor of warriors and resulting tribute, products of exotic crafting, and specific contexts of accu­mulation such as markets, exchange routes, or ports. I would argue that in most cases, but not all, elite control of such critical aspects of the econ­omy may not have been through management but simply through taxation in goods and services. Above all, the ideological powerof these grand cer­emonies and their epicenter settings were a pri­mary source of the most nearly universal feature of Classic Maya state economies: the "tithing" of food stuffs and labor to physically maintain the holy lords and nobles and their many activities. 
Yet even these most central features of eco­nomic ideology were highly variable.At some sites, the locations of temple complexes may indicate that rituals were used competitively to justify dif­ferent sectors' contested claims to economic and political power (Lucero 2007). At Chunchucmil, there was no central stage for the "theater state" aspect of the economy. Instead, temple/plaza com­plexes are small and placed within zones ("quad­rangles") separated from other complexes by stone walls (Hutson et al. 2008). As detailed below, most elements of the theater state and its centralized rit­uals were also absent from the port site of Can­cuen-replaced by a variety of more specific ideological contexts and activities claiming vari­ous discrete economic rights . 
In that regard, even at the more typical lowland centers, the major periodic theater state ceremonies were not the only sources of ideological power or legitimation. A wide range of rituals and symbols associated the rulers with deities, ancestors, sacred places, and natural phenomena. Overlapping with the more general models of legitimation and the­ater states, these more specific religious associa­tions also justified the central role of rulers and nobles in various contexts of accumulation. Such aspects of economic ideology created sacred elite associations, general and specific, that asserted their rights of control and/or usage of sumptuary goods such as jade, quetzal feathers, spondylus, pyrite, fine textiles, and other exotics that often arrived via long-distance trade, gift exchange, or military tribute. 
Elite rights over usage and control of such goods -and sometimes of the production and exchange contexts that brought or produced them ­is referred to by McAnany (2010:138-139) as the "naturalized authority of the royal court." This "nat­uralization" of economic rights of rulers and nobles involved beliefs associating rulers, and to a lesser extent elites, with maize, water, ancestors, war, sac­rifice, and specific deities (McAnany 2013). Rice (2004) has stressed the role of rulers as time lords, with cyclically rotating authority over time itself. Like their other claims of divinity and the theater state rituals, this periodic power could have granted general rights over tribute and labor to the patron lords of specific calendric periods (Rice 2009). Note that in addition to such general claims to labor and goods, the supervision of calendric period ending ceremonies might have provided some degree of control or taxation of the periodic markets that would have coincided with such ritual gatherings (e.g., Freidel 198lb; Rice 2009). 
Other general aspects of divine kingship related rulers to the major factors that determine the suc­cess of the agricultural cycle. Solar aspects of rulers' divinity were numerous and included the "k'inich" designation in titles of many kings, directly connecting them to the sun god, k'inich a jaw (Colas 2003) or to the maize deity (e.g., Hous­ton et al. 2006:45-49). For example, the Popol Vuh, many elements of which can be traced to the Clas­sic or even Preclassic, is laden with details relat­ing nobility and divinity to the maize deity and to his sons, the "hero twins," the protagonists of its

tale. The hero twins also were in part deities of the sun in its diurnal and nocturnal aspects. Of partic­ular relevance to Cancuen, the hero twins were divine practitioners of all forms of sacrifice and of the sacred ballgame. In this, they were models of kingship and nobility for Classic Maya leaders . In the royal version of the ballgame, rulers and high nobles symbolically reenacted the roles of the deities in the myths (e.g., Cohodas 1991). Royal ballcourts (e.g., the one at Cancuen) often had iconography of two rulers or nobles playing a ver­sion of the game, such as the "friendly" matches between the twins and between their father and their uncle. Other games central to the Popa! Vuh were against the death deities. In these, the ball­game and its underworld courts were associated with war and with captive sacrifice (e.g., Miller and Houston 1987). In stone, ceramic, and mural art, ballcourts often were places of presentation or sac­rifice of war captives. Thus, ballcourts, and the role of rulers and vassals as players related directly to the claims of royal rights over the labor of warriors and the economic benefits of tribute from vassalage through military victory or alliance. Furthermore, as with the grand periodic theater state events, the attendance at ballgames also had a direct economic impact in providing opportunities for elite gift exchange and general market events that drew on a larger geographical area (e.g., Fash and Fash 2007; Freidel 1981 b). 
All such rights of court tribute mimicked the general concept of"original debt" to the deities and ancestors that had to be reciprocated with offerings and sacrifice (e.g., McAnany 2010:67-69). The charterof sacred "debt" to the deities (and by anal­ogy to the divine kings) could also apply to the ancestors who were , to various degrees, perceived as supernatural beings, particularly in the case of royal and noble ancestors . Ancestor worship and offerings were central to all aspects of Maya ide­ology in all periods and at all levels of society (see especially Houston and Inomata 2009:210-216; McAnany 1995, 1998) and had a particular impor­tance at Cancuen and its region (see below). Offer­ings to ancestors at all levels of society constituted a major investment of goods and labor. Of course, the celebration and propitiation of divine royal dynastic ancestors was the most important and costly of investments, and those events were a part of both the great theater state ceremonies and the noble burials. Rulers, nobles, and even household patriarchs derived significant power from their role as the most direct interface with the ancestors and the principal actors in many forms of their worship. 
It is also especially noteworthy in relation to Cancuen that ancestor ritual and related myths had caves as dominant settings. Most of the episodes in the Popol Vuh occurred in either caves or ball­courts or ball courts within or accessed through cav­erns. In many zones of the southern lowlands, especially in parts of the southwestern Peten, most offerings of any kind are found in caves. Indeed, there would have been a great economic impact from the production of ceramics and valuable arti­facts for cave rituals, given their consequent per­manent removal from circulation (Brady 2005). Religion and ritual in the Upper Pasion and Alta Verapaz zones (highlighted here) have always cen­tered on caves, from the Preclassic to the present (e.g., Spenard 2006; Woodfill 2010). Thus, elite roles as directors of some cave rituals further legit­imated their general power, as well as their super­vision over this specific sacred context of significant economic consumption. 
Rulers also had special connection to water, in all of its manifestations. Lucero and others (e.g., Fash 2005; Lucero 2006; Scarborough and Valdez 1998) identify many elements of iconography, texts, and the built environment that may be seen as part of an economic ideology claiming control, or simply credit, for reservoir systems and, of course, timely rains. Note that associations with rivers, water, and sacred fluids are constituents of the ideology of divine kingship in many world regions (e.g., Quigley 2005; Taylor 2013). Sym­bolic association of the ruler's body and its fluids were part of the corporal conception of the sacred­ness of Maya rulers (e.g., Houston et al. 2006; Lucero 2006). These aquatic analogies also could facilitate claims of control over rivers and their benefits, as seen at Cancuen (see below). 
With the late eighth-century "balkanization" of Classic Maya royal power, such sacred aquatic connotations of rulership also may have frag­mented. During that period, dispersed water fea­tures could have been elements of the sacred landscape, providing separate community defini­tion and localized rituals in different sectors of sites (e.g., Fash 2005; Fash and Davis-Salazar 2006), perhaps presided over by resident leaders .

Such a fragmentation of sacred royal claims over aquatic contexts might include division of control and usage of rivers and ports as contexts and "matrix positions" in the exchange economy (e.g., Demarest and Andrieu 20 13). 
I would argue that in many contexts, we can identify how each of the previously mentioned ele­ments of ritual, religion, and myth also could define specific aspects of Classic Maya economic ideol­ogy, as attempted here. In more general terms, such beliefs and rituals generated acceptance by the pop­ulation of elite "ownership, end usage, and resource conversion" (Hirth 1996:225). They rationalized economic ideology "in terms of idealized end usages that are usually expressed with reference to the population's general wellbeing" (Hirth 1996: 225). Note that such an idealization corresponds closely with the historical and archaeological lit­erature on the nature of divine kingship in general and rulers' responsibilities for economic prosper­ity (e.g., Iannone 2013; Quigley 2005; Taylor 2013). As Hirth (1996:225) reminds us, such ele­ments of ideology are not merely an alternative to coercive physical force for resource accumulation. Rather, such an economic ideology is a prerequi­site to "legitimize economic inequality and the use of force to defend resource accumulations" [ empha­sis mine]. Ancient Maya elite rights to tribute, labor, and control of specific economic contexts were asserted through this ideology and both general and more focused devices and institutions. These were inscripted in images, architecture, artifacts , and texts. 
I present here one set of examples of specific mechanisms of ideological assertion of Classic Maya elite power over critical nodes of the econ­omy. The case of Cancuen is especially illustrative of these, necessarily overlapping, activities because there we see a direct form of elite economic resource control, an importance of exchange systems, and a reliance on a variety of mechanisms used to chan­nel the perceptions and behavior of a broad class of social actors-including peer rulers, elites, local pop­ulations, and non-Classic Maya neighbors and more distant trading partners. Furthermore, specific strate­gies of legitimation at Cancuen seem to be targeted at selected segments of the exchange system. The patterns exemplify our growing awareness of behaviors that link the various "categories" and spheres of action in ancient states. 
The Kingdom of Cancuen as a Case Study in 
Variability in Classic Maya States 

Recent research has documented the great degree of variation between Classic Maya cities, particu­larly in aspects of politics and economy. Indeed, much disagreement between scholars over the nature of Maya states can be attributed to attempts to generalize from individual examples. In some cases, differences in structure reflect scale, with some gigantic centers evidencing a more integrated, heterarchical economic structure. For example, at Caracol specialized communities and under-pop­ulated agricultural zones were linked by causeways with market termini (Chase and Chase 2001). While this example has been extrapolated as evi­dence of general unitary Classic Maya state struc­ture, both such scale and infrastructural features are unusual and can be identified at only a few enor­mous cities, (e.g., Coba [Folan et al. 1983]). Such a structure might be inferred for other megacen­ters , such as Calakmul and Tikal. Note that those sites were probably ten to twenty times the size of most Maya centers , and subsistence for both those populations and their elite courts would have been different in structure. A few centers, such as Colha and Salinas de los Nueve Cerros, appear to be spe­cialized production centers due to access to special resources, and with an elite role in managing these (Hester and Schaffer 1994; Woodfill et al. 2011). But variation is so great that, even within relatively small regions, contrasting hierarchical and heter­archical polities have been identified (Scarborough et al. 2003). Other centers such as Chunchucmil are strikingly different in almost all features, lacking centralized ritual architecture and with an economy based on a port function and well-documented mar­kets (e.g., Dahlin 2009). 
Still, I would argue that the vast majority of the courts of Maya centers were probably more depen­dent on the combination of tithing from religious authority and military vassalage. Nonetheless, taken together, new evidence on Maya economy and more detailed understandings of divine king­ship require more studies of "outliers" in variabil­ity to identify features of economy and economic ideology that may be present, but less clearly evi­dent, at other sites. We can now assert a high degree of temporal and regional variability in governance and economy, but we are far from understanding

all the factors that determined such variability­and the different ideologies that justified it. 
Evidence from the site of Cancuen contributes to the study of variability in Classic Maya states. Like Chunchucmil and Caracol, it does so by hav­ing clearly identifiable economic activities linked to an unusual site structure . Put succinctly, Can­cuen is a frontier center dedicated to a specific eco­nomic function as a port for long-distance exchange. While it is a rich site, with one of the larger palaces in the Classic Maya world, it lacks temples and other features associated with the the­ater state. At first consideration , royal and elite power appears to have been based on neither reli­gious authority, nor military tribute , but on con­trol of its port economy (e.g., Barrientos and Demarest 2007; Demarest and Andrieu 2013; Demarest et al. 2009). However, following Hirth, an ideology underlying economic control must always be present. After over a decade of investi­gations, we are beginning to understand aspects of Cancuen 's more specifically targeted devices for legitimation of economic control . 
As noted above, the term "legitimation" is gen­erally problematic since it carries some of the tra­ditional Marxist connotations of systematic deception by a cynical elite . More often elite agency might be better conceived as operating within a "habitus" generally accepted by the elites themselves but with conscious or unconscious changes created by their own practice within the system. In the case of Cancuen, however, the more manipulative connotations of"legitimation" might not be inappropriate. It was a capital suddenly cre­ated in a frontier region and surrounded by com­munities that did not share many aspects of the Classic lowland Maya religious system. Ideolog­ical systems at Cancuen did not gradually evolve, but were rapidly created or adapted for a more diverse audience oflowland and highland, elite and non-elite, sustaining populations and exchange partners . Subjectively, one can suspect that elite and royal agency might have been quite conscious and strategically targeted. 
Elite Economic Power at the 
Port Kingdom of Cancuen 

In the late eighth century, Cancuen was the capital of a kaloomte, a king of kings. Fourteen large-scale seasons of excavation have shown that royal state power, and that of the Cancuen nobles, was based on control of significant and obvious economic resources (see the many articles and dozen annual monographs on excavation and lab results in the supplemental online bibliography). The site itself is where the Pasion river begins and connects to adjacent land routes (Figure 1). Sitting in the mid­dle of the Pasion, the Cancuen epicenter peninsula (Figure 2) is the "head of navigation," the point at which the cascades and rapids end and the Pasion first becomes navigable by boat or canoe. It was the transfer point from land to river and vice versa. To the north of Cancuen, the Pasion flows down­river as a smooth highway of transport and exchange, passing many cities of the southern Maya lowlands, intersecting with key land routes, and joining the Usumacinta to lead all the way to the Gulf of Mexico (Barrientos and Demarest 2007; Demarest et al. 2007). To the south, Cancuen links the Pasion river to the archaeologically and ethno­historically identified land routes to Kaminaljuyu and the Valley of Guatemala, and ultimately to both the Motagua valley and Pacific coast (Figure 2) . This valley route is still used today. Also, we have learned in the past decade of the importance of a third route that crosses at the Cancuen nexus: the "transversal" that runs by land due west along the northern base of the highlands of Guatemala, then turning northwest along the foothills of Chiapas , and reaching all the way to the Gulf coast of Tabasco and Veracruz (Figures 1 and 2). This trans­versal route was a critical one in the final half cen­tury of Cancuen's apogee. 
Cancuen's position as an economic crossroads of several major routes across southeastern Mesoamerica is quite clear and was reflected in all aspects of its nature and its written history. In all respects, Cancuen was about exchange and about its port economy. 
Direct state or noble control of the critical eco­nomic assets of the site are indicated by the distri­bution of elite architecture, imported ceramics, and artifact concentrations (e.g., Demarest 2012; Demarest and Andrieu 2013; Demarest et al. 2009). Within the Cancuen epicenter itself were well­defined ports (Figure 3), three of which have been intensively investigated; these are described in detail elsewhere (e.g., Alvarado 2004; Demarest and Andrieu 2013; and supplemental bibliography).

Each of these three investigated ports is in a small inlet off of the river, each has been used as a portage to the present day, and each was surrounded by a complex and varied array of architectural groups (Figure 4). Note that Cancuen differs from a num­ber of Maya ports in that its portages were not located at a distance but were directly within a site epicenter, as well as being as far from a sea as any major Classic Maya site .

tecture in terms of masonry bases, artifacts, size, and form . On the northern neck of the Cancuen peninsula, a fine masonry range structure sits directly astride the isthmus that leads into the penin­sula epicenter of the site and just above the north­eastern port complex (Figure 4a). The largest port complex is just 400 m south, associated with Can­cuen's eastern port (Figure 4b, 4c). Frequencies of Peten style artifacts at the northeast and east port also indicate Classic lowland affiliations for some of these structures. The elites of these port com­plexes may have controlled both land and water access to the very head of navigation and, thus, to the Pasi6n/Usumacinta river system. 
Very distinct artifact distributions are associ­ated with different features and sectors of the site, suggesting a complex multi-regional population. 
The northern zone of the site's head of navigation, its northeast and east ports, and some other con­texts in the site have Chablekal Fine Grey ceramics-sourced compositionally by INAA to Tabasco; significant proportions of black opaque obsidian from Highland Mexico; and some Cam­pamento Fine Orange from Veracruz (e.g.,Andrieu and Quinonez 2010; Bishop, personal communi­cation 2009; Bishop et al. 2005; Fome et al. 2010, 2011).All of these artifacts that related to the site's interregional economy are well-dated ceramically to the Los Laureles and Chaman phases from A.D. 760 to 800, periods identified by texts and archi­tecture as the apogee of the kingdom (Barrientos and Demarest 2007; Fahsen and Barrientos 2006; Fahsen et al. 2003).

gest lowland Classic elite supervision of port exchange and other economic activities in the site's peninsular epicenter (Demarest 2012; Demarest and Andrieu 20 13; Demarest et al. 2009). Perhaps due to control of the loci of arrival of obsidian to the peninsula, most of the obsidian cores were concen­trated in royal or high elite cache and burial deposits, whereas core fragments elsewhere are heavily reused (Andrieu 2009; Andrieu and Quinonez 20 1 0). Another aspect of elite economic power was exotics and, in one case, production. The latter involved a most sacred substance: jade. As discussed further below in reference to Cancuen's highland-style ball­court, this jade probably came from a newly identi­fied highland source on the Verapaz/Quiche border on the valley route to Cancuen (Andrieu et al. 2011 ). Like obsidian, its importance, as a non-perishable, also is for plotting Cancuen's role in interregional exchange. Activities at Cancuen did not involve skilled artistry, but rather had to do with breaking down boulders into unfinished preforms of plaques and beads. This process left thousands of fragments of jade debris, boulders, and preforms (Andrieu et al. 2013; Andrieu and Fome 2010; Andrieu et al. 2012; Kovacevich 2006). 
As with ports, elite control of raw jade and pre­form production is indicated by multiple lines of evidence, as well as elite supervision of other activ­ities on the peninsula. Contrary to some of our ear­lier preliminary hypotheses (e.g., Demarest et al. 2003; Kovacevich 2006, 2007): (1) given the prox­imity of the workshop to elite complexes (Figure 4a), there was probably minimal autonomy for workshop labor (e.g., Demarest 2012; Demarest andAndrieu 2013); (2) there is only one area of pro­duction and craftsperson residence of any kind thus far identified in the epicenter: the jade preform pro­duction in the midst of elite and other complexes; 


(3) the late imported fine paste wares are not arti­san-associated (Kovecevich 2007), but rather have a much wider and more complex distribution, as well as chronological (e.g., Fome et al. 2011) and interregional significance (e.g., Fome et al. 2010). Furthermore, because of landowner restrictions, the area of the site studied prior to 20 10 was lim­ited to the peninsular epicenter (see below). Our more recent interpretations, indicating close elite control at Cancuen, are based on extensive 2006-2011 excavations and laboratory study of the many complexes around this port and workshop area (e.g., Demarest 2012; Demarest and Andrieu 20 13; see supplemental online bibliography), more study and evidence on ceramic distribution (e.g., Fome et al. 20 10, 20 11), and reanalysis of all of the Cancuenjade and obsidian on a lot-by-lot basis, rather than combined by structure types (e .g., Andrieu and Quinonez 2010; Andrieu, Quinonez, and Rodas 2011; Andrieu et al. 2012; cf. Kovace­vich 2006, 2007). Finally, very significant changes have come in the past two years from field work beyond the epicenter, new lab studies, and addi­tional ethnohistorical evidence. We now know that in the peninsular epicenter were located the ports and much public architecture, as well as residences that together covered all drained land on the penin­sula itself. The 20 13 survey and excavation show that the site continues for at least 4 km to the east (mapped so far) and possibly several kilometers fur­ther (Wolf and Bracken 20 1 3); investigations in other directions are underway. 
Many of our previous publications have empha­sized the role of Cancuen in the long-distance exchange of exotics, such as jade, pyrite, and shell. Discoveries from Cancuen, extending beyond the epicenter peninsula, and ethnohistorical perspec­tives from 20 13 now suggest a broader economic role for Cancuen in both exchange and production. With 2013 findings, cache deposits of whole spent obsidian cores in elite or public caches (more than 90 percent of all cores) and elsewhere have been recovered: a total of 940 whole spent cores from the A.D . 656 to 800 period of Cancuen's existence-enough cores to produce about 94,000 blades (Andrieu, personal communication 2013). This number of cores already discovered is much more than were recovered for the entire Late Clas­sic of Tikal-a site many times bigger, with a 60­year excavation sample that is literally hundreds of times larger than that of Cancuen (we are still just beginning in "Greater Cancuen") (Moholy-Nagy 2003:Table 3.18, 3.24, 2008:Table 3.006). How­ever, many of the cores are far from fully spent, also suggesting long-distance exchange of cores . Thus, we now believe that at Cancuen, long-dis­tance exchange of cores was a major aspect of its port economy, but we now also hypothesize that Cancuen was involved in large-scale blade pro­duction for the local and regional Upper Pasion and northern Alta Verapaz communities (e.g., Demarest et al. 2013).

Very late in its history (ca.A.D. 780-800),eco­nomic functions of Cancuen included jade pro­duction, but only of preforms, not finished artifacts. The evidence indicates that, like the ports, the jade preform production area was in the epicenter and was elite-supervised (Demarest 20 12; Demarest and Andrieu 2013). As with obsidian cores, exotics, and probably perishables (see below),jade preform production and exchange essentially treated jade as a commodity (e.g.,Andrieuetal. 2013; Demarest et al. 2013; on jade as a "commodity" see,e.g.,Frei­del et al. 2002; Masson and Freidel 2013). 

This pattern of elite control of materials and their exchange may not be a general one for Clas­sic Maya sites. Rather, at the central peninsula of Cancuen, it fits well with elite control of access to the ports and the isthmus leading into the epicen­ter (e.g., Demarest and Andrieu 2013; Demarest et al. 2009; Wolf and Bracken 2013). Elsewhere we speculated that it was actually a developing class of "noble merchant" elites that might have super­vised these sites of access and production (Demarest 2012; Demarest and Andrieu 20 13; Demarest et al. 2009; see also McAnany 2013). However, a royal claim of control might be inferred from a cache with a large raw jade boulder, pol­ished on one side, found in the throne room of Taj Chan Ahk (e.g., Andrieu et al. 2013). In addition to jade, an elite or state claim of control of obsid­ian distribution (at least for the limited access epi­center) might arguably be inferred from obsidian caches associated with stelae and royal burials. 
One hypothesis is that there was elite control in the port of transshipment and distribution (at least peninsula epicenter) of other materials such as pyrite, shell, quetzal plumage, and other perish­ables. Regarding perishable commodities, it is well documented that in historical times the "transver­sal" piedmont zone, less than 15 km to the south, was a major zone of intensive production of cacao and cotton. Indeed, the cacao from this piedmont zone was considered to be of unusually prized qual­ity (Caso and Aliphat 2006; van Akkeren 2012:38-39). It also was a production area of the highly valued Maya condiments of vanilla and annatto, which were mixed with the processed cacao in chocolate drinks and with other food stuffs (Caso and Aliphat 2006:36-37, 2012). Also, salt from the piedmont source of Salinas de los Nueve Cerros was most easily accessible via the nearby Verapaz transversal route leading to Cancuen, where salt-processing metates have been found (Mijangos 2013). These, as well as the more pre­cious sumptuary goods , would have been moved from land to river through the Cancuen ports , and elites certainly would have been in critical "matrix control" positions in terms of Birth's principles of the economic system. 
Obviously, at Cancuen we see elite control and oversight of many major economic activities. The ports, jade, obsidian, exotics, and other commod­ity exports would help to explain the impressive elite material culture at this modestly sized site. Again, we cannot extrapolate the evidence at Can­cuen for such elite economic control as a general model for all Classic Maya centers. Cancuen's "frontier" location, its access to, or control of sev­eral long-distance exchange routes, the channeling mechanism of its ports, its connections to Gulf coast economies, and the late date of its apogee may all suggest an economy shifting in some patterns to a Terminal Classic and Postclassic form of elite­directed mercantilism and commodity exchange (Demarest 20 12: 364--369; Demarest and Martinez 2010; compare to McAnany 2013). Nonetheless, the study of the international economy of this unusual port center does indicate a direct elite or state role in its economic activities and adds to the growing body of evidence on economic and polit­ical variability in the Classic Maya lowlands. 
Ideological Mechanics of Power for 
Cancuen and Its Exchange Network 


In all aspects, Cancuen as a port and exchange cen­ter would seem to have its identity and power based squarely on economics. It lacked temples, presti­gious history, military potential, and a large popu­lation. It appears to have been neither a significant military power nor a great ceremonial center. While Cancuen was a major interregional player in the economics of exchange, what economic ideology gave elites "ownership" or "usage" of these resources-ofthe ports, the head ofnavigation, the exchange route, the jade workshop? How was that ideology generated and maintained to control these resources and the opportunities for unbalanced accumulation that they provided? The channeling mechanism of the ports and river route gave elites, if not the state, the opportunity to create a classic

example of what Hirth (1996:224) calls a "context oriented" economy: "context oriented systems are those where resources are produced and/or accu­mulated in special contexts under the direction of organizing or supervising elite." In tum, this could have facilitated control of the distribution of criti­cal goods within the site, the surrounding region, and via exchange down the river to other lowland centers. However, these advantageous elite eco­nomic positions at Cancuen could have existed only with a strong ideology that legitimized own­ership or usage. 
A look at the details of Cancuen's ideological structures and devices indicates an astute series of strategies for the feedback cycle between power, ideology, and economics. These included not only power over distribution and transport at the ports, but control (or claims of control) over some imported materials, such as jade boulders, obsid­ian, pyrite, shell, and probably perishables, as dis­cussed earlier. The instruments of economic ideology at Cancuen were unusually diverse and complex due in part to the multiregional popula­tion of its epicenter and sustaining area, requiring tools of legitimation that drew on differing "canons" of belief and ritual. 
Religious Pilgrimage, Cave Shrines, and the Early Classic Exchange Route 
Turning to specific mechanisms for access to exchange routes, we see a very clear pattern in the Early Classic, before the founding of Cancuen itself as dynastic seat, but within the retrospec­tively described history of the kingdom (Fahsen and Jackson 2001). Excavations in the Verapaz and along the Upper Pasion valley indicate a more direct Central Peten influence in maintaining Early Classic access and flow on the great west­ern trade route. In the fifth century, sites with Cen­tral Peten monuments and ceramics were established in the greater Pasion valley at Punta de Chimino and Tres Islas (Bachand 2010; Bar­rios 2006). Farther south, all along the piedmont and Verapaz land route (Figure 2),pilgrimage cen­ters in caves had thousands of potsherds of Tza­kol-style polychrome ceramics, found in offering deposits in the opening chambers of caverns and even a sculpture with texts in lowland Maya style (Woodfill 20 10). Woodfill and Andrieu (2012) have interpreted all of this evidence as indicating the presence of Central Peten lowland merchants, who also were pilgrims, and who maintained asymmetrical, although non-violent, relations with the Verapaz populations that lined the road to highland goods. 
Thus, it would appear that in the Early Clas­sic, the lowland Central Peten control over both the river and land exchange route was through direct presence. The flow of sacred goods, as well as commodities such as salt, obsidian, and cacao, was maintained by such direct contact-with reli­gious pilgrimage to the highland routes as a facil­itator of exchange . Such exchange relations were clearly asymmetrical . The Verapaz cave shrines were part of an economic ideology that legiti­mated such asymmetry. 
It is remarkable that in the Late Classic, after the establishment of Cancuen, lowland influence in the Verapaz abruptly ended, and there is little direct evidence of Peten culture in piedmont Ver­apaz sites or caves. As described below, cave rit­ual was utilized in the Late Classic by the Cancuen kingdom, but primarily in its immediate sustain­ing area. It would seem that in the Late Classic there was a radical change in exchange strategy and eco­nomic ideology, with Cancuen clearly defined as the intermediary between highland culture and resources and the Maya lowland centers. 
The Dynastic Seat of Cancuen: 
Military Founding and Initial Strategies 

The founding ofCancuen inA.D. 656-657 appears to have been purely military strategy. It was founded (or the dynastic seat was moved) by Calak­mul, with its epicenter placed on its highly defen­sible near-island peninsula at the head of navigation of the Pasion river. This move would not have required much force since surrounding communi­ties and piedmont neighbors were few, small, and less complex sites. Under Calakmul's authority, two of Cancuen's initial rulers were placed on the throne and apparently held their accessions at Calakmul itself (Fahsen and Jackson 2001; Martin and Grube 2008). Through Cancuen, the Calakmul alliance was able to control the head of navigation, outflanking the Tikal hegemony and seizing con­trol of the Pasion river. These activities were simul­taneously coordinated with wars by Calakmul or its allies and conquest of Dos Pilas, Waka, Machaquila, and other sites on the major western

exchange routes (Demarest 2006:126--166; Mar­tin and Grube 2008). 

Cancuen was located adjacent to less complex highland and piedmont communities that did not share lowland material culture or ideology. Thus, it needed a different set of ideological tools to jus­tify economic privileges and power to local pop­ulations. As Cancuen gained autonomy with the eighth-century decline of Calakmul, it also uti­lized various strategies for local control, alliance, and exchange relations with both more distant downriver lowland Peten Maya states to the north and with very different piedmont and highland Maya neighbors and trading partners immediately to the south. 
These strategies did not appear to include direct warfare led by Cancuen itself. Monuments do not record military action by the Cancuen k'uhul ajaw himself, but by allies (Fahsen and Barrientos 2006). Furthermore, the site lacks temples for the central legitimating force of the theater state . Yet Cancuen needed to control, or ally with, a wide range of dif­ferent types of polities and communities to form its trade route hegemony. Toward each of these dif­fering entities, Cancuen addressed specific legiti­mating mechanisms. 
Marriage, Alliance, and the Pasion River Exchange Route 
Access and exchange on the low land Pasion river's northern portion of the exchange system involved more familiar tools of Classic Maya alliance. After the A.D. 695 defeat of Calakmul by Tikal and Calakmul 's decline, Cancuen became more directly associated with the growing Petexbatun region hegemony of Dos Pilas (Demarest 2006; Martin and Grube 2008:55-67). This association was one of Cancuen's peaceful alliances with the militaris­tic Dos Pi las state. Cancuen 's size and nature would have allowed little opportunity for major conquest, so this alliance was critical to maintain its auton­omy and access, specifically to the downriver Pasion exchange system . 

At Dos Pilas, a marriage alliance is confirmed in Panel 19, where a queen from Cancuen is por­trayed at an important ritual (Demarest 2006:Fig­ure 7.7, p. 142; Houston1993; Martin and Grube 2008:61). This queen also had her own palace struc­ture group. It is constructed of fine masonry, unlike the mix of rough-worked and unworked stone 
found in most Dos Pilas elite architecture. Fur­thermore, the queen had her own elaborate death throne, naming her a "Lady of Cancuen" (Houston 1993). This alliance with Dos Pilas was continu­ally reinforced by joint rituals such as that recorded on a hieroglyphic staircase in Cancuen 's sprawl­ing central palace. It describes ceremonies held at Cancuen by the Dos Pilas ruler, K'awil Chan K'inich, with his cousin, the great Cancuen regent, Taj Chan Ahk (Fahsen et al. 2003). Such rituals and marriage alliance guaranteed downriver access on the exchange system, as the predatory Dos Pilas state had conquered the Middle Pasion region (Demarest 2006; Demarest et al. 2007; Houston 1993). Other Cancuen lowland alliances included that with Cancuen's second dynastic seat at Machaquila, which was subordinate to Cancuen prior to A.D. 800 (Fahsen and Barrientos 2006). 

At Cancuen, the physical settings for rituals of downriver alliance with Classic Maya centers included the two lowland Classic Maya-style ball­courts and the smaller courtyards of the palace (described below), which had inscribed monuments and a hieroglyphic staircase with texts for their lit­erate lowland peers. Along with the marriage alliance, these more typical instruments of Classic Maya ideology, and probable gifting of exotics, assured both military immunity and asserted "own­ership" of the head of navigation, both critical for Cancuen's economy. 
Cancuen Subsistence, Cave Shrines, and "Imagined Community " 

Most of the materializations of economic ideology described here assert elite, in some cases state, "ownership" or "usage" of the key features of Can­cuen 's port and long distance exchange economy. Yet, we must also consider their most direct eco­nomic need: the subsistence support to feed and provide labor for the population of the Cancuen epicenter. 
The Cancuen peninsula epicenter was packed with the huge royal palace; elite, retainer, and worker residences; ballcourts; and other ideologi­cal features (see below). There was little room for agriculture of any kind, except possibly a few small household gardens. Non-elites were more likely primarily retainers for the elite Peten Maya popu­lation, as well as workers in many port functions (porters, rowers, boatmen, etc.). This peninsular

core is almost an island, surrounded by the Pasion river, which rises and falls erratically over 8 m per year (and as much as 6 min one day) due to the heavy rains in the immediately adjacent piedmont and highlands. At times, the river widens around the site to more than 1 km (Figure 3). Beyond are equally unstable river channels, lakes, and swamps, leaving discontinuous areas of drained land useable for occupation or agriculture (e.g., Demarest et al. 2013; Wolf and Bracken 2013). Thus, there is no neatly concentric form for "Greater Cancuen," but the site continues east from the peninsula, and in other directions is a discontinuous occupation divided by water or swamp. Throughout this area of continuing survey and excavation (see Wolf and Bracken 20 13 and supplemental online bibliogra­phy), we have recovered Late Classic ceramic assemblages characteristic of Cancuen. These investigations of Cancuen beyond the epicenter have so far mapped and tested 4 km east from the center with continuous significant populations and architecture (e.g., Wolf and Bracken 2013), includ­ing several stelae and altar complexes and 123 structures. These include non-elite and elite struc­tures, and the multiregional nature of Cancuen is again reflected in the presence of both Central Peten and piedmont forms. The former include "Plaza Plan 2" groups with a higher shrine structure on the east. Yet they also include what Wolf and Bracken (2013) call "aggregated clusters" -a num­ber of structures of variable style and status densely crammed together on restricted, artificially leveled ground on the limited, well-drained ridges of Can­cuen's swampy environment. This "greater Can­cuen" research is continuing now and will for years to come. The current limits of the Cancuen ceramic assemblage are found at the cave shrines 8 to 12 km away (see below). 
How was this food and labor support area tied to the Cancuen epicenter? Economic connections to the center might have been based in part on the arrival through Cancuen of goods such as obsid­ian, cacao, salt, and other piedmont products for distribution via local markets or through commu­nity leaders. Identification with the center also could have been created through some of the other ritual and visual devices described below, which could have been experienced at events and visits to Cancuen by community or household leaders. Remember, however, that Cancuen lacked large temple arenas for theater state rituals for large audi­ences. Furthermore, during all periods, the religion and ritual of the local transversal, piedmont, and highland populations were very different and were focused on cave and hill shrines. 
One ideological strategy of Cancuen appears to have directly utilized local religious canons. Within 8 to 12 km from the Cancuen epicenter, about a 2 to 4 hour walk, and visible from its epicenter, there are many heavily eroded limestone hills, remnants of the piedmont. Many of these scattered hills have caves within them. These "karst towers," as geol­ogists call them ("mogotes" to local Q'eqchi'), have nearly vertical walls, such as those of low­land temples (e.g., Figure 5): "these sites are situ­ated in and around tower-like karst hills with caves, a landscape that represented 'ready-made temple pyramids"' (Spenard 2006:146-147). Thirteen of these cave/hill shrines have been excavated; all have deposits of artifacts, primarily ceramic offer­ings dating from the Preclassic to the present (Spe­nard 2006; Woodfill 2010:76-89).As noted above, Early Classic offerings included basic Peten styles, including lowland Tzakol-style polychromes. 
In the Late Classic, however, cave ceramics were the same as those of Cancuen (Spenard 2006:80-116). Spenard (2006) and Woodfill (2010) have interpreted these as shrines used by the local Cancuen population during the Late Classic. The cave excavations at Torre Hun (Figure 5) , one of the more impressive hill/cave shrines, recovered evidence of Late Classic rituals, one involvedleav­ing offerings such as a cache containing a human cranium. Spenard interprets that site as a Cancuen ancestor shrine with rituals that might have been like one described in Cancuen Panel 1 (Kistler 2004; Spenard 2006:147-148). In the Late Clas­sic, these cave shrines could have defined a zone of "cave ritual and the establishment of Cancuen authority" (Spenard 2006:147; 142-148; see also Woodfill 2010:76-89). As Spenard (2006: 147) con­cludes: "The rulers of Cancuen ensured that the city incorporated all aspects of the idealized sacred landscape by establishing the San Francisco hills as the pyramid-temples of the site." 
The cave shrines around Cancuen provide an ideological definition of a site-sustaining area, a "Greater Cancuen." Contemporary archaeological studies no longer define communities as merely areas of contiguous settlement. Instead, they utilize

the concept of group and individual identity as defined through practice by community members themselves; a definition that more closely corre­sponds with modem, historic, and ancient commu­nities (e.g., Anderson 1991; Yaeger and Canuto 2000). Zones of membership in such "imagined communities" (Anderson 1991; Isbell 2000) have been identified through specific architectural and artifactual features for contiguous and also discon­tinuous Classic Maya urban areas at "Greater Chunchumil" (Hutson et al. 2008), Caracol (Chase and Chase 200 1), and other sites (e.g., Joyce and Hendon 2000; Yaeger 2000). The cave/hill shrines around Cancuen would have defined its greater community "as a form of identity discourse created and reproduced by interpretive acts in the public sphere" (Preucel 2000:73). Late Classic Cancuen use of the cave shrines also involved the elite agency "to shape beliefs about the demand for resources and the specific use for which they were collected" (Hirth 1996:224)-in this case, for subsistence sup­port for the peninsula epicenter population. 

As with the highland-style feasting ballcourt and some other epicenter features, the shrines gave lowland elites settings different from most lowland city states, with rituals that would res­onate more effectively with the existing ideology of the local piedmont and highland communities. Suddenly, embedded in a non-Classic lowland region, the Cancuen Peten leaders appear to have quickly and strategically adjusted to shape exist­ing ideology (and, thus, its economic privileges). 
The Ballgame, Proxy Wars, "Lowlandized " 

Verapaz Mountain Shrines, and New Exchange Routes in the Late Eighth Century 
The royal ballcourt of the Cancuen rulers Taj Chan Ahk and Kan Maax is extraordinary in its iconog­raphy and monuments that provide a narrative of alliance and proxy wars. As discussed below, the association of this ballcourt with the ruler as a water lord was also reflected in its river position and the aquatic themes of its stucco and stone sculptures. The ballcourt had three large markers projecting 15 cm above the ballcourt floor (Figure 6). These were substantial altar-sized monuments Gust under 
1 min diameter and 35 cm high). All three altars were found in situ. Their placement and projection up into the playing field would have altered the sur­face of the court and the nature of the game. 
The unusual nature and imagery of the ball­court, its altars, and its iconography indicate that it served exclusively as a ritual forum for events between rulers. The three altars, along with Panel 3 in the ballcourt range structure and the palace hieroglyphic stairway, tell a tale of Cancuen hege­mony, alliance, and proxy wars (e.g., Fahsen and Barrientos 2006). Altar 2, dated to A.D. 790, is the most explicit of these monuments, showing Taj Chan Ahk playing with a high lord (Figure 6). They are in elaborate costume, and this was clearly a high ceremonial form of the ballgame. 
The competitor or companion in the ritualized and politicized game was identified as the captor of another lord of a center known as Sac Witz, "white mountain." We can speculate that this could have been a reference to a site on the Verapaz trans­versal, which is only 15 km south of Cancuen. The transversal exchange route runs along the base of this piedmont, and its centers were dominated by very steep white limestone hills-the settings for Verapaz worship. On the transversal, the karst tow­ers were almost mountains, much higher and more impressive than the hill shrines of Cancuen, with great caverns and some large sites. In the Late Clas­sic, the site ofRaxruja Viejo, sitting directly on the transversal, was "lowlandized" with the addition of large platforms, terraces, and plain stelae/altar complexes placed at the base of its steep temple­like mountains with caves (Figure 7) (Demarest et al. 20 13; see supplemental bibliography). One of its altars has the distinctive truncated cone form found only at Cancuen. Ceramics and stratigraphy suggest a late occupation that could correspond to the late dates on the Cancuen ballcourt altars (AD. 790-800). Farther west, directly on the transversal at the base of the piedmont, other hill sites suddenly had monuments; and one, La Lintema, had a hiero­glyphic staircase. 
The late "lowlandization" with stelae platforms at Raxruja Viejo suggests a very brief direct Can­cuen lowland influence in the transversal ­combining some Peten Maya religious and architectural canons with the pre-existing highland ideology. Apart from these stelae platforms, the sites remained highland in material culture, includ­ing coarse-paste ceramics, artifacts, and clay-faced rubble construction style (e.g., Demarest et al . 20 1 3); the ceramics were local in chemical com­position, as evaluated by INAA (Ronald Bishop,

personal communication 2012). So, lowland Maya migration is not indicated. It also is significant that the "syncretic" lowland religious architecture and influence did not penetrate to the south, which shows virtually no Peten ceramics, artifacts, mon­uments or elements of style of the Late Classic (e.g., Woodfill 2010). The lowland architectural features and monuments are found only directly on the narrow transversal route at the base of those highlands. Once again, a newly created "hybrid" ideology appears to have been used to assure control-or at least, access-to this route west. This economic ideology may have been the mech­anism for legitimating "usage or ownership" (Hirth 
1996)-in this case, most likely just usage-of these strategic exchange contexts. The effectiveness of this additional Cancuen ideological strategy is evident at the capital itself. 
Compositional evidence suggests that in this period-during the reign of Taj Chan Ahk (A.D. 756-796) and his son Kan Maax (A.D. 796-80) ­there was new access to the transversal route. There was a late eighth-century (A.D. 760-800) influx of materials from far west. These materials would have come most directly via this land route (Fig­ures 1 and 2) from the Gulf of Mexico through the northern Verapaz and Chiapas. The Middle Pasion was racked by warfare, and on that northern river route, the western Tabasco and Veracruz ceramic and lithic imports (described below) were rare or absent during this period. At the same time, some transversal sites were experiencing lowland influ­ences in monuments and architecture (Demarest et al. 2007). Cancuen received significant quanti­ties of eighth-century Chablekal Fine Grey ceram­ics of high chromium varieties compositionally

traceable to Tabasco (Figure 8a), Late Classic Campamento Fine Orange vessels (Figure 8b) from Veracruz (Bishop et al. 2005; Forne et al. 2009, 2010; Ronald Bishop, Christopher Pool per­sonal communications 2011), and black opaque obsidian from Highland Mexico (Andrieu, Quinonez, and Rodas 2011). This transversal route provided Cancuen with an alternative passage to the west (Figure 2), all the way to the Gulf coast, avoiding the late eighth-century chaos of warfare and destruction in the Middle Pasion region (Demarest 2006; O'Mansky and Dunning 2004). Mechanisms to secure access to this route would have included all of the ritual devices at the Can­cuen epicenter, but also may have included the projection of some elements of lowland Classic Maya religious concepts and settings along this new trade transversal route itself. 
In terms of ballgame ritual and the routes north into the Peten, we should note that a second inscrip­tion was added to the bottom of Altar 2 (Figure 6). This text also credits the king's companion ball player as being the captor of a lord of the great city of Machaquila, and texts on many other monu­ments identify the Cancuen ruler also as "lord of Machaquila" (e.g., Fahsen and Barrientos 2006; Fahsen et al. 2003). This reestablishment of Can­cuen's control of Machaquila indicated its contin­
ued dominance of this alternative route to the north, around the maelstrom of the Middle Pasion. This route headed northeast, up the Machaquila river valley to the central and eastern Peten (Figure 2). In this same late eighth-century period of Cancuen apogee, there is a 50-year hiatus in monuments at the clearly subordinate center of Machaquil:i (Fah­sen and Barrientos 2006). The alliances support­ing the proxy wars and exchange route control were consolidated by the peer polity ballgame and palace rituals described in the monuments and hiero­glyphic stairway. It is also probable that such vis­its by allied rulers included gifting or the exchange of some of the precious resources and general com­modities coming through Cancuen's ports. Fur­thermore (as discussed above), sacred associations of this type of royal ballcourt, which were part of the general canon of ideological legitimation of the holy lords, generally would have been more empowering to rulers and nobles of every site involved in the exchange system . 
The ballcourt of Taj Chan Ahk and, more impor­tant, the late eighth-century new "ideological cor­ridor" on the western transversal were only two more of the elements in their strategy of trade route access or control . They were, however, important and unusually explicit strategic projections of polit­ical and economic ideology.

Long-Distance Highland Resource Exchange and the Cancuen Feasting Ballcourt 
The use of a different ideology to support exchange with transversal, piedmont, and highland trading partners is best seen in another ballcourt. This court was located in the very middle of the Cancuen epi­center peninsula. It was a purely highland-style, open, and sprawling ballcourt, 24 m in length (To­rres 2011). Unlike any court in the lowlands, its play­ing alley was defined by sloping unworked natural slabs oflimestone (Figure 9). This construction tech­nique in ballcourts was completely alien to the Peten and elsewhere at Cancuen, yet it was the most com­mon form of construction in the highland areas to the south. Very similar structures were excavated at Los Encuentros in the Baja Verapaz, Los Cerritos in the Quiche, and Chijolom in the Alta Verapaz (lehon and Hatch 1982:83-96; Torres 2011 :93-97; van Akkeren 2012:70-111). The ballcourt is surrounded by massive, heaped middens of broken serving ves­sels and jars oflocal and piedmont ceramics-further evidence that this was a highland-style "feasting ballcourt" (Fox 1996; Torres 2011) . 
We can posit that the rituals in this context would have created and solidified exchange relationships between the Peten Maya of Cancuen and the high­land valley route polities to the south. The area known for such construction style and ballcourts also was the highland source ofCancuenjade. Pre­liminary chemical compositional analyses have shown that this source was probably located up in the highlands, near the Baja Verapaz/Quiche fron­tier (Andrieu et al. 2011), not in the well-known Motagua Valley sources and its quarries. Further­more, analyses of jade production suggest an unusual exchange relationship in the transport of raw jade. Motagua sources and production sites exported jade as manageable preforms (e.g., Rochette 2009). In contrast, the jade arriving at Cancuen from its highland Verapaz/Quiche source was in the completely impractical form of huge, unbroken boulders of 20 to 40 lbs (e.g., Andrieu andFome 2010; Andrieu et al. 2012,2013).As the primary activity at Cancuen was breaking boul­ders into preforms, it was almost a "quarry" workshop-minus only the initial quarry stage: the extraction of blocks from bedrock.

The highland feasting ballcourt may have had a function in a ritualized exchange relationship. That exchange and ballcourt rituals and feasting also would have helped create and legitimize Cancuen elite "ownership" and supervision of jade and its subsequent production into preforms. These ritual exchange relationships would have brought in other exotics, since the highland area where these ball­courts were located also had identified pyrite sources and was near the core zone of quetzal birds, the biotopo de! quetzal. From farther south, obsid­ian and shell also would have moved through these same highland valleys. As discussed earlier, new 2012-2013 evidence also suggests that the ballcourt facilitated gifting, tribute, and/or market exchange of Verapaz transversal commodities (cacao, salt, achiote, vanilla, etc.), as well as distribution or exchange of obsidian blades produced at Cancuen (e.g., Demarest et al. 2013; van Akkeren 2012). 

Along with rituals and their settings for visiting Verapaz elites, the highland ballgame and its feast­ing also may have served to solidify ideological and economic alliances (Fox 1996). Its highland-style rituals might have created specific "relations of production," in a classic sense (Godelier 1978), and, in this specific case, mechanisms of both long­distance and regional material exchange. It has long been recognized that the ballgame had economic as well as ritual and political functions (e.g., Fash and Fash 2007; Scarborough and Wilcox 1991). At Cancuen, such factors were probably involved in all of its ballcourts, but the highland feasting court may have represented a unique context by also facilitating specific long-distance exchange rela­tionships. Thus, it was an instrument of economic ideology-in this case, quite consistent with my own, more narrow, reading of the concept of "rit­ual economy." 
The Symbolic Water System and Claims of River Control 

Another ideological device was an unusual water system at Cancuen. It was one of the most openly visible instruments of legitimation at the site and one which might have directly made claims of con­trol over water, ports, and the river itself. 
The water system consists of tiny stone-con­structed channels running through the plazas around the enormous royal palace and other elite and public architecture (Figure 10) (Alvarado 2011; Barrientos et al. 2006). Several mound struc­tures appear to have been placed carefully for water diversion into the system (Wolf and Bracken 20 13). This system was centrally located in the epi­center. Thus, it would have reinforced the central role of the water lord (Lucero 2006), not geo­graphically segmented power, as characterized by Copan 's water system (Fash 2005; Fash and Davis­Salazar 2006). This miniature constructed stream system was fed by the water sources of several per­manent natural springs, as well as the runoff from the finely plastered architecture and plazas of the epicenter. At two points in the elaborate system (Figure lOc, lOd), it had plastered stone masonry pools at springs (Alvarado 2011 :63-103, 105-106; Barrientos et al. 2006). Between these pools and the site's ballcourts and palaces ran the channels faced in stone, 1 to 1.5 m wide and 0.5 to 1.5 m deep . Channels of the system ran past ceremonial architecture, small palaces of nobles, the main entrance to the palace, and, significantly, one chan­nel system began at the palace ballcourt (Figures lOa, lOb) . 
One fine masonry plaster-sealed pool laid directly at the impressive principal entrance to the royal palace (FigurelOc, 12c). This pool was 8 by 10 m and 2.5 m deep. Its plaster was painted red, further identifying it as a sacred location. Stair steps led down into it (perhaps for ritual ablutions?) . This cistern was later the setting of the execution and watery burial, including rich grave goods, of 31 of the site's nobility (e.g. ,Suasnavaretal. 2007). Cra­nial deformation, inlays, rich artifacts, and isotope analyses indicate that these men, women, and chil­dren were part of the Peten lowland Maya elite segment of the site population (e.g., Quintanilla 2013; Winburn et al. 2013). 

Farther north in the epicenter system, there was another stone cistern of 7 .3 by 6 m and more than 3 m deep. It also was finely constructed of masonry and plastered. It had multiple levels, stone chan­nels, and an artificial cascade (Figure lOd). Yet a third conical pool was found in the northwest side of the epicenter. This carefully planned water sys­tem was ceremonial, not being necessary for drink­ing or agricultural water, since the site has several fresh springs within it and is an island surrounded by the Pasion river, with aerated cascades just above its northeast port (Barrientos et al 2006; cf. Fash 2005; Fash and Davis-Salazar 2006).

The location of the system, and the images on the monuments and stuccoes nearby, present the k'uhul a jaw as a water lord (Figure 11 ). Meanwhile, the eastern royal ballcourt of Taj Chan Ahk associ­ated him in its imagery, and its position on the river, as a water lord. Detailed study of the many stucco sculptures of that ball court show that the iconogra­phy is of water symbols (Fernandez 2010). Panel 3 in this same court shows this ruler in a quatrefoil sitting atop a water monster (Barrientos et al. 2006; Fahsen and Barrientos 2006). Together, these fea­tures and the miniature river course could have cre­ated an ideological legitimation of control of the river and its ports. All of these elements would have been physically visible in the epicenter to all levels of society, residents, and visiting participants at palace meetings, rituals, or the ballcourts. 
This water system is an unusually explicit exam­ple of the water lord associations of rulers among the Classic Maya, as discussed by Lucero and oth­ers (Fash 2005; Fash and Davis-Salazar 2006; Lucero 2006) , and of the more general linkage of rivers, water, and prosperity to divine kings (e.g., Iannone 2013; Quigley 2005). But in this case, images, location, and form suggest that its claims were over the surrounding Pasion river, this port city's all-enveloping source of power. 
The Palace as Power-Generating Device 
For alliance building at all levels, the royal palace of Cancuen was a well-designed mechanism to inspire awe and to project social distance. It did so through sequential movement between closed architectonic complexes (Barrientos 2013). The palace (Figures 12a and b) covered an area as large as the Central Acropolis of Tikal , despite the fact that the site was only a fraction of Tikal's size. Its eleven courtyards were carefully laid out to be

structure were 8 m high, with elaborately decorated cornices and wide doorways facing outward to the great stairway and terrace below. Detailed com­parative analysis by Barrientos (2013) identified these and most other rooms in the palace as non­residential receiving chambers (Figure l 2a). While impressive in their facades, they were only 3 by 3 m or 4 by 4 m in internal area, had only 3 walls, and were open on the side facing outward toward the plazas below (Figure 13). Most of these rooms had no direct access to the palace interior. 
Thus, Barrientos (2013) concludes that most of the palace, and all of its outer rooms, may have served administrative and ritual functions. Such rit­ual/administrative palaces have been identified at other sites, dated to the very end of the Classic period, but especially the Terminal Classic (Ba­rrientos 2013). At Cancuen, almost full-round, larger-than-life-sized figures, adorned exterior fa<;ades (e.g., Figure 13 b). Studies by Barrientos, Larios, and others conclude that the imagery is of kings and nobles, some flanked by bas relief deities and profile guard figures (e.g., Barrientos 2013). Details and variation in facial traits suggest that these may have been actual portraits of rulers and nobles and that these parts of the palace may have served as popol na, or council houses (e.g., Barri­entos 2013). 
The ideological strategy of the inner palace was directed at lowland peers, like most Classic period palaces. Only the select few would enter beyond the great entrance to the next inner court­yards. These had panels and a stairway with writ­ten texts, proclaiming the history of the dynasty and its changing lowland alliances (Fahsen et al . 2003; Fahsen and Jackson 2001). These smaller courtyards would have been ideal for the types of elite ritual events and feasts characteristic of low­land Classic Maya sites. Finally, the last, small­est, and highest courtyard placed only the most important visitors before the throne of the king (Barrientos 2013).

To whom, however, was the general broader impact of the external palace architecture directed? Why the myriad exterior audience chambers? Why the massive exterior three-dimensional stuccoes in the palace, royal ballcourt, and adjacent architec­ture (Figures 12 and 13)? And why the external, openly visible, water system? The answer to these questions must again take into account the fact that Cancuen was a lowland Classic Maya site intruded into a region of highland material culture in ceram­ics, construction, cave-rather than temple­worship, absence of writing, and other markers of the (generally less complex) Verapaz highland, non-Classic Maya societies. In this sense, the outer palace complemented the highland feasting ball­courtand Late Classic cave shrines. While the inter­nal courtyards reinforced the ideological authority and alliance with divine Peten Maya rulers and nobles downriver on the exchange route, external architecture and images would have provided awe­some empowerment of Cancuen 's elites in a form accessible to neighboring populations and to more distant non-literate, non-Classic Maya, highland exchange partners. 
Conclusion 
These are some of the mechanisms of ideological action that supported the exertion of authority over economic resources by the elites ofCancuen. They provide specific examples and material correlates for our understandings of "legitimation," "ritual economy," and "economic ideology." In this case, the very rapid trajectory of Cancuen's history was due to a feedback loop: investment in ideological infrastructure and events then provided the labor and resources for further investment in legitimat­ing ritual settings, patronage, and long-distance exchange . The number and unusual nature of its ideological devices accords with the more diverse partners of this frontier center: Classic lowland Maya allies, local piedmont communities , and elites from distant centers ranging from the south­ern highlands to the Gulf coast. Without either mil­itary might or ancient prestige, Cancuen's complex economic ideologies established their rights over ports, the workshop, local support, and long-dis­tance exchange relations. Both the effectiveness and the fragility of this economic ideology can be seen in the very short history of the Cancuen king­dom, with its late seventh-century meteoric rise and its late eighth-century ritualized destruction. 
Ongoing research and interpretation at Classic Maya centers will provide more examples of spe­cific links between ideology, ritual, and economic systems. Admittedly, the identification of such spe­cific connections and institutions is a "moving tar­get," given changing and contested interpretations of Classic Maya economy itself. On the other hand, the reconstruction of the variable and complex roles of elites in Classic Maya economies can be facili­tated by considering the nature and effects of their more richly documented beliefs and rituals. Long considered a "back water" in studies of economy (if not theory in general!), Mayanist archaeology is becoming a leading field in the study of specific connections between religion, ritual, and political economy.
