This first major study of the Precolumbian cuisines of Middle and Andean South America is a seminal work. It is also a deeply disappointing one, but for reasons that do not detract from its importance as a first step. The book expands a series of six articles concerning Aztec and Inka food and culture that Sophie Coe wrote for Petit Propos Culinaires between 1985 and 1991. These have been slightly revised and some chapters on Maya foods and cookery not previously published have been added. 
The text concerns itself with foods and their prepara­tion and consumption in the sixteenth century, as described in conquest period and early colonial docu­ments. Very minor use of archaeological and botanical data is made; the use of archaeological sources is, in fact, the weakest part of the book, as Dr. Coe apparently depended upon her husband, Dr. Michael Coe, for data and interpretation. More surprising, Coe does not seem to have even seen, let alone tasted or cooked with, many of the ingredients she talks about, as the text contains numerous factual errors. For example, achiote, the red seed of Bixa Orellana widely used as a colorant for food (and people), is repeatedly described as a red oil that cov­ers the seed rather than the tough coating (aril) sur­rounding the seed that is ground and processed to produce the dye, making me wonder if Coe had only seen achiote-colored oil and had no experience with the condiment itself. Similar comments are made concern­ing the cooking of guinea pigs and the appearance and uses of various tuber and bulb crops; she does not seem to have heard of much of the experimental work on chul­tunes (which includes studies of the longevity of smoked maize in these underground chambers). She also repeat­edly belabors the supposed lack of a staple carbohydrate in modem America. Perhaps this is the case in upper middle class New Haven, but Middle America still runs on potatoes and bread-and the increasingly large Asian and Latin American communities have not, for reasons of both ethnicity and economics, dropped their depen­dence upon rice and maize. However, ignoring the flaws of this book, flaws perhaps understandable in terms of the author's mortal illness as well as her personal attach­ments and interests, Americas First Cuisines is an inter­esting and valuable contribution to the historical study of foods and foodstuffs. 
The book covers three major cultural groups: the Aztec, the Maya, and the Inka, with introductory chap­ters on domestication, New World staples and produce, and four final chapters on the European effect on Inka and Mexican food and culture. The Aztec chapters are by far the most successful, largely because central Mexico is rich in documentary sources, including the works of Sahagun, Motolinia, the descriptions of Tenochtitlan by Bernal Diaz, and the illustrations of the Codex Mendoza. Coe describes markets and produce, modes of preparation, the general austerity of the Aztec in matters concerning food and drink and such matters as the availability of meat and meats consumed. These chapters are the most detailed and most well balanced of the book, as indeed they were of the original series of articles. 
The section on the Maya is much less detailed because of fewer and less detailed conquest-and colo­nial-period documents. Here again she stresses the nutritional importance of the discovery of "nixtamal­ization" (an unfortunate term for soaking maize kernels with lime), a process that enhances the food value of the com. Tortillas being a late introduction to the Maya, she discusses the possibility of other uses of maize, using archaeological and ethnographic data. Although her discussion of ways to cook maize cakes without a ceramic griddle is not convincing, she points out that tamales were extremely important; and she presents detailed information concerning the wide variety of tamales made. Strangely, there is no mention of Karl Taube's major study of Maya maize tamales (American Antiquity 54:31-51), although it is certainly germane.

Her discussion of silviculture and of the uses of fruits and various drinks among the Maya is well presented. This section has the poorest use of archaeological and ethnographic data: noncomparable bits from vastly dif­ferent times and places are all rolled up together. Coe also falls into the common fallacy of assuming that the Lacandon Maya, because they were the most isolated, are the "purest" exemplars of traditional Maya culture. This does not detract from the competent synthesis of the limited documentary sources, but it is annoying and, perhaps, misleading. 
The weakest section is that on the Inka, partly because of really sparse documentation, but also because Coe apparently had no personal experience of the Andes. The physical description of Peru is risible, and her per­sonal lack of acquaintance with most of the foodstuffs described is very evident, even though many of many of them are readily available in the United States. This is especially unfortunate as there is a growing interest in Andean cultigens, many of which have been or are being developed for the world market ( ocas, tree tomatoes, ullucos, manioc, and many different potatoes are regu­larly available in the United States in mainstream, not ethnic, supermarkets). Peru's most infamous crop, coca, is mentioned, but little of coca's essential role in Andean social and religious life is presented. Chicha (native beer) is more thoroughly discussed and its dietary, as opposed to its recreational, importance is noted. As in the Maya chapters, there is an interesting treatment of the importance of salt in native diets and economies. 
For all the weaknesses, inaccuracies, and minor per­sonal vendettas present, Americas First Cuisines is the first major attempt at a synthesis of a field unfamiliar to nonspecialists. Coe has carefully searched the major documentary sources on these three cultures at the time of contact and has presented these data in a coherent and generally readable manner. The faults of this study will, hopefully, inspire more investigation into this extremely important and consummately interesting area of ancient American life.

Due to the spectacular developments of Honduran archaeology during the last 20 years, ceramic typologies have multiplied, hundreds of varieties have been listed and described, and the situation had become so complex that a pause was needed to bring some order to this con­siderable amount of information and make communica­tion easier among archaeologists. In the past, ceramic conferences for the Maya area or the Greater Nicoya subarea have been held successfully for the same rea­sons, and one could expect a favorable result for the workshop held in Honduras in 1986. Based on that workshop and other meetings in 1987 and 1988, the pre­sent volume is a collection of papers covering 10 regions-Copan, La Entrada, Naco, Lower Ulua, Central Santa Barbara, Southwestern Hondurs, Lake Yojoa, Northeastern Honduras, El Cajon, and Comayagua-which have detailed ceramic sequences. One of the editors' objectives, that of compiling a sum­mary of descriptions and classifications, is fulfilled by the book although the contributions on the Copan Valley and on El Cajon are more synthetic and less analytic than the others. The other objective of the book is "to set forth concepts, methods and theories used in Honduras" 
(p. 2); beyond the fact that most authors use the type­variety method of classification and sometimes indicate the procedures followed in "establishing the taxa," there is little in the theoretical and methodological realms that is either new or not shared by all contributors. 
The regional 
ceramic typologies presented here have been constructed for chronological purposes, and types are divided into varieties most often to express very minute differences. The book mostly consists of a compendium of summaries of ceramic descriptions with minimal illustration, and the reader feels frus­trated by the lack of any attempt to present, even in a preliminary way, a subareal synthesis. There is also no effort to draw out of the individual typologies the most significant ceramic units or modes for building up a common language that would make comparisons possi­ble. As a result, although the authors of the El Cajon sequence recognize more Los Naranjos types than does Patricia Urban for the Central Santa Barbara region, I am not sure which region had more in common with the Lake Yojoa region, the two regions being a comparable distance from Los Naranjos. 
Comparisons are made difficult or impossible because most of the contributors belong to the splitter category. Masica Incised, for example, now includes 10 varieties distributed in the La Entrada, Santa Barbara, Southwestern Honduras, Lake Yojoa and El Cajon regions. No variety is found in several regions, and rarely is a single variety found in even two complexes.
