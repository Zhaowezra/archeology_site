Although the study of plant and animal domestication in the Andean world has a long and august history, it remains the case that few areas within the region have produced systematically recovered data from multiple perspectives that can speak more or less definitively to that question. It is not that we lack data; on the contrary, numerous sites ranging from the lowlands of Ecuador to the highlands of northwestern Argentina have produced excellent records of cultivars, plausible reconstructions of how these cultivars entered the diets of ancient peo­ples, and, finally, how the more permanent role of these cultivars ultimately transformed many of these peoples and led to the development of more complex social and political institutions. No, what we lack are regional-scale data obtained through a combination of intensive survey and sufficient excavation that reflect long-term trends in these processes. Chronological control over changes in diet and material culture is necessary, as is a careful 
understanding of shifts in climate and the effects of cli­mate change on regional ecology. Finally, these data must then be integrated, at least in part, by a coherent theoretical perspective. 
Few areas in the Andes reach this rather lofty (but highly desirable) target. One such region includes the Zafia and Jequetepeque valleys offar northern Peru, where Tom Dillehay and colleagues, in a series of projects conducted over the past 30 years, have amassed an impressive data base on the preceramic (and later) occupations. Their vol­ume is best seen as a true synthesis, and while some new data are presented, most chapters are devoted to showing how the data address the research themes that structured the multiple projects. One of the contributors to the vol­ume (not a member of the research team) describes it as similar to Kent Flannery 's ( 1976) The Ancient Mesoamer­ican Village. Dillehay's book has points of similarity with that classic, but certainly lacks Flannery's humorous touch: no grumpy Real Andean Archaeologist or snarky Skepti­cal Graduate Students here! 
The volume is organized into 15 chapters and four appendices, along with a useful forward by Peter Kaulicke that briefly outlines earlier thinking on plant and animal domestication in the Andes. Chapter 1 (Dille­hay) introduces the problem through a brief description of the environment, phasing, and, most importantly, the investigators' theoretical perspectives. Chapter 2 (Dille­hay, Kacy Stackelback,Jack Rossen, and Greg Maggard) outlines the history of research in the region and pro­vides critical definitions of site types and how these were recognized in the field and then refined in subsequent analyses. Patricia Netherly (Chapter 3) charts paleocli­matic changes across northern Peru in general and the Zafia and Jequetepeque valleys in particular over the period from 25 kya to 6 kya. Chapters 4-7 describe the three key archaeological phases in which cultivars appear and are adopted to a greater or lesser extent into the diet: Chapter 4 (Maggard and Dillehay) describes the El Pal to Phase (13800-9800 BP), Chapter 5 (Rossen) the Las Pir­cas Phase (9800-7800 BP), and Chapter 6 (Stackelbeck and Dillehay) the Tierra Blanca Phase (7800-5000 BP). 
These discussions are followed by a series of chap­ters that address specific material cultures or treat broader topics related to the projects' theoretical themes and aims. Chapter 7 (Dillehay, Netherly, and Rossen) introduces the topic of preceramic mounds and hillside villages made famous by research at the Nanchoc site; human remains are described in Chapter 8 by John Verano and Rossen; Chapter 9 (Rossen) examines plant use across the three key preceramic phases; and Chapter 10 (Stackelbeck) presents fauna! analyses. Chapter 11 (Dillehay, Maggard, Rossen, and Stackelbeck) describes other aspects of mate­rial culture, including residential architecture, irrigation canals, gardens, agricultural fields, lithics, and so-called "exotics." Chapter 12 (Dillehay) examines changes in land use and settlement patterns with a careful analysis of population dynamics, including attention to popula-

ti on estimates. Finally, Chapter 13 (Dillehay, Rossen, and Stackelbeck) presents arguments about pathways to farm­ing, water control, regional interaction and land use, and speculations on how these pathways combined to con­tribute to, in the authors' terms, the "economic founda­tions of Andean civilization." 
The final two chapters make an effort to pull together these data and place them into a broader comparative per­spective. Dolores Piperno (Chapter 14) examines the data from the Zafia and Jequetepeque valleys and com­pares them to other well-defined trajectories toward plant domestication in the Andes. In Chapter 15, Dillehay offers a grand synthesis and notes three primary out­comes of this research: 1) an outline of a cultural his­torical and ecological interpretation of the multiple trajectories of plant domestication during the preceramic in northern Peru; 2) a synthesis of the more than 30 years of data collection in the region; and 3) the identification of what the authors describe as four important patterns that relate to the occupation and subsequent trajectory of cultural development in the region: a better sense of the initial peopling of the region, a robust understanding of the transition from early foraging to farming, a recog­nition that this transition is uneven in development, and, finally, a reassessment of commonly held assumptions about what happens when foragers begin to introduce cultigens into their diets. 
I found the discussion of two patterns to be especially interesting: that of the transition from foraging to farm­ing, and the recognition that this process was character­ized not by steady progress from a foraging baseline in the El Palto phase to full-blown reliance upon cultigens by the end of the Tierra Blanca phase, but rather by an uneven trajectory of utilization. Intensification in some areas and in some periods was not followed directly by domestication but instead by a reduced reliance. Further, some of the standard causal forces that archaeologists use to model the transition, such as demographic change or population pressure, significant environmental change, or clear evidence of aggrandizing, seem not to have been present in this trajectory.Although the authors are careful to make clear what they do not know about this process (they hew very closely to their data and keep unwarranted speculation to a minimum), they identify historical, cultural, and contingent causal forces as being primary drivers. They note that landscaQe configurations 
and social choices appear to have primacy at multiple points in the process. Readers looking for "the" answer to the whys of plant domestication in these valleys will 
be di.sa\)\)Oi.nted. However, la\)\) laud the care the authms 
have taken to look at a multiplicity of additional factors 
and the ways in which they have woven those factors 
into a series of plausible interpretations of the past. 
This volume will be of special importance to Andeanists, especially those who work with the prece­ramic and have an interest in the domestication process. 
It will also appeal to scholars grappling with similar processes in other regions of the world. For them, I rec­ommend starting with a careful reading of Chapters 1, 14, and 15. Specific chapters that provide a greater depth of empirical support and synthesis can then be read more deeply. But however one reads this volume, it is sure to challenge one's assumptions about how the discipline has approached the domestication process and how the insights obtained from the volume may apply to one's own work.

"Dedicated to: The tecomate-and all those archaeolo­gists who have puzzled over its use and importance in Formative-period Mesoamerica." These words are the opening salvo in this, the first published monograph from the Mazatan Early Formative Project directed by John Clark and Michael Blake. Lesure informs the reader early on that while this volume is primarily a detailed report of the Early Formative El Vara! estuary site of coastal Chiapas, it is also an intellectual experiment in archae­ological argumentation and hypothesis building. There­fore, this is an ambitious project, and in many areas Lesure is successful in his undertaking. The report of the investigations of El Vara! and the subsequent analysis of the material from the site is an exercise in archaeologi­cal thick description: it is a data-laden report, supported by numerous tables, graphs, and figures. As the title implies, however, Lesure goes beyond site analysis to undertake a study of Early Formative variation between sites in the Soconusco, with the ultimate goal of creat­ing hypotheses concerning the development of socioe­conomic organization within the region. The central problem inspiring this investigation is a dichotomy of site assemblages in the region: tecomate-dominated sites 
along the estuary zone versus contemporaneous <:Hsh­
dominated sites further inland. The monograph is organized into three principal sec­tions. Part I focuses on the archaeological investigations 
at El Varnl. While Cha\)tern 2-4 deal wi.th the ni.tt)'-gritty 
of site investigations, Chapter 1 is actually an overall summary of the entire volume and perhaps should have been an introductory chapter apart from and previous to this section. We are informed that El Vara! is a small I ha Early Formative site located at the edge of the estu­ary zone in the Mazatan region the Soconusco. The 100
