Theunderlyingideainthisbookisthatmarketexchangeis now largely accepted in the study of Classic Mayaeconomies, and therefore, what can be said about themarketplaces themselves? What could those transientspacesthatmayhavehostedMayamarketstellusaboutthe ancient economic organization?
The introduction by Shaw and King is a very finetunedhistoryofresearchonMayamarketsthatreiteratesthe reasons for the traditional opposition that prevailedfor a long time between what would have been a morecommercializedeconomyintheMexicanAltiplanoversus a noncommercialized economy in the Maya Lowlands. They attribute what they consider to be a realdenialofthecomplexityoftheMayaeconomytomultiple causes: the romantic image of the Maya, the misunderstanding of their ecological environment, and theimpactonresearchofsubstantivism.This leadsthem toa very interesting discussion about the old oppositionbetweenfunctionalistsandsubstantiviststhatwillprobably remain a major reference on the question in thefuture.Theauthorsshowconvincinglythattheinsistenceof Karl Polanyis school that the economies in ancientsocieties were nonutilitarian and embedded in social relationshipshasbeenaconsiderablebarriertoourunderstanding of ancient economies. On the other hand, theydoadmitthateconomictransactionsweremoreentangledinsocialrelations thantheir modern counterparts(p. 1),and this leads them to suggest subsuming this old theoretical opposition between formalists and substantivistsby both accepting the idea of economic rationality forancientsocietiesandatthesametimetakingintoaccountthefactthatarationalactionisculturallymediatedandbound and must be interpreted in that context (p. 22).
That middle ground posture opens the way to thestudyofmarketsinnonmodernsocietieswhileadmittingthat these had specificities that need to be taken intoaccount. In that sense, the first chapter, which is an ethnohistorical analysis of Maya markets, builds on theintroduction and is a fantastic synthesis ofcolonial dataontheMayaandMesoamericanmarkets,whichprobablyprovides the best grounded comparison for understanding the specificities of those markets. Kings review ofthevocabularyusedindifferentMayalanguagesfortalking about these exchanges highlights the lack of Mayawords for the notion of money, which she interprets bysaying that our modern idea of commercialization and currencies does not correspond well with Maya emiccategories,whichmayhaveviewedobjectsalongamorefluidcontinuumfromgoodstocurrency,servinginsomeinstancesassimplymerchandise,andinothersasmoney
(p. 43). This suggests an interesting template for whatmay have been some of the specificities of the Mayamarkets, while underlining all the work that is stillrequired to understand them.
This statement isclearly one ofthe theoreticalbasesof the book. However, it is not followed up in detail byall the authors. While most contributors clearly rejectPolanyis view on ancient economies, others are not asspecific as the authors of the introduction, and Polanyiclearlyappearsasthe badguyofthebook,serving,inmost cases, as the straw man. Furthermore, the understanding, or at least consideration, of the nature of theinvolvementoftheMayaeconomyinsocialrelationshipsisnotreallydevelopedintheotherchapters.Infact,mostoftheremaining chaptersare more specifically focusedon the issue of identifying the marketplace using a vastrangeof methodsondifferent sites.Various approachesare presented, from the spatial and morphological(Becker),tosoilanalysis(Cap;Terryetal.),andthedistributional approach (Eppich and Freidel), but all thechaptersagreewiththefactthatmarketplacesaresodifficulttorecognizethattheyrequireaveryprecisemultiscalar approach that could integrate all the availablemethods(Cap;Chaseetal.;ShawandKing).Thechaptersconvincinglyshowthatitispossibletoisolatesomespecific spaces that could possibly have been used asmarketplaces. In that sense another important merit ofthis book is to situate the study of those large vacantplaces, which until recently were hardly taken intoaccount, as a work objective. Soil analysis in particular(Terryet al.) showsfascinating differences intheuse ofsuch open spaces within a single site and opens manyperspectives for the future of urban studies in general.
However,itisonethingtorecognizetheuseofaparticular place or even a mode of exchange, and anotherto be able to discuss the economic framework in which that placewasused.Theideabehindthe book is thatbyrecognizingthemarketplacesweshouldbeabletounderstand the way they worked in society. But it appears sodifficulttoactuallyrecognizethemarketplaceitself,thatfor now, the demonstration takes most of the effort andwe might ask if finding the marketplace will, in fact,solve all our problems in understanding Classiceconomies in general. Perhaps there is work to be doneon that specific question: what a marketplace, andfromthere a mode of exchange, will reveal about the rest ofthe economy? This is probably this books only failure.It does not attempt to develop this aspect since there isaconstantconfusionbetweenmarketexchangeandmarketeconomy.Inthefirstchapter,KingandShawspecify

thatbymarketeconomytheymeanitspremodernvariant and that while market transaction played a centralrole, other forms (of exchange) were present to varyingdegrees (p. 16). But once this rather ambiguous definition has been stated, no effort is made to see what thispremodern variant of market economy might be, orevenifthetermmarketeconomyisvalidatall(whichIactuallyreallydoubt),afterwhichmanychaptersseemto consider that a market exchange implies a marketeconomy.I am not certain that prices were regulated bysupply and demand mechanisms. There was probablysome competition between the agents of exchange, butwe cannot postulate that there was any kind of freeexchange (i.e., no state intervention) with prices beingautoregulatedbysupplyanddemandthatwouldimpactthe volume of production. We simply do not knowenough about all those aspects of the economy to takethat for granted!The more so since many authors stressthefactthatothermodesofexchangeprobablyprevailed(Eppich and Freidel; King), that we have no way ofknowing whether prices were fixed or not (King), andthat the supervision of the elite was, in certain cases,very probable (Becker; Jones).

JoanM. Gero is oneof the bestknowntheorists incontemporary U.S. archaeology. Recipient of the LifetimeAchievement Award from the World ArchaeologicalCongress, her contributions to critical archaeology andthe archaeology of gender are widely recognized, andher articles are required reading in university seminarsfocusing on postprocessual archaeology. Unlike sometheorists, Gero also has maintained an active career inthe field, carrying out investigations in diverse areasincludingBritain,Labrador,Peru,andArgentina,aswellasSouthCarolina.Nonetheless,hertheoreticalwritingshave been more influential (and frequent) than her substantive contributions to world prehistory.
