INTERPOLIT Y POTTERY EXCHANGE IN THE 
TUXTLA MOUNTAINS, SOUTHERN VERACRUZ, MEXICO

Neutron activation analysis (NAA) of Coarse Orange jars demonstrates economic exchange among the Classic period polit­ical capitals of Totocapan, Matacapan, and Teotepec in the Tuxtla Mountains of southern Veracruz, Mexico. Matacapan. in particular, displays evidence of intensive pottery production at large workshops at the southern margin of the site. Comoa­pan (Area 411) and Area 199 present configurations of kilns, ceramic densities, and assemblage characteristics that sug­gest production for exchange beyond the site's boundaries. Both of these production facilities specialized in the production of Coarse Orange jars, a well-made and decorated utilitarian ceramic ware. While these products were traded to sites in the Tepango Valley, different paste recipes of the Coarse Orange type were also produced locally. Of broader concern, I 
examine the articulation of these regional exchange relationships with the interregional interactions previously documented among Tuxtlas groups and others in central Mexico and the Gulf Coast.

I detail here the results of compositional analy­ses that trace the distribution of Matacapan-pro­duced Coarse Orange jars across a politically divided region. More importantly, I am concerned with how this industry articulated with the other political, economic, symbolic, and ritual networks in the Tuxtlas. The network of exchanges among Matacapan, Totocapan, and Teotepec suggests a concern for maintaining cooperative interpolity relationships. I propose that these economic inter­actions developed because of the regional eco­nomic and cultural diversity that followed Matacapan's connections to central Mexico. 
Multiscalar Interaction Networks in Ancient States 
Biologist Douglas Whalen (2010) recently wrote, "The most revolutionary idea in the past 150 years may be Darwin's having taken individual variation as data, rather than having averaged over it." Aver­aging over individual variation is a major limita­tion of generalized models, such as core-periphery interaction, that have been popular in archaeology since the 80s. Most applications of core-periphery analysis have assumed a direct correlation between culture and regional units of interaction (e.g., Chase-Dunn and Hall 1998; Frank and Gills 1993; Hall and Chase-Dunn 1993; Wallerstein 197 4), while discarding individual variation in favor of broad scale processes (Frank 1999:278-281).Mod­els of interaction between cores and peripheries have been extremely helpful for understanding the integration of groups over long distances, but they ignore how groups within those broad territorial units interrelate. This is not so much a criticism of world-systems theory, but a call to investigate how world-systems processes layer on top of other scales of interaction. 
Santley and Alexander (1996; see also Santley 1989, 1994) have sought to understand the devel­opment of Matacapan in the Tuxtlas through core­periphery analysis. They posited a dendritic model of Classic period interaction across Mesoamerica,

in which raw materials and goods flowed from the periphery through a hierarchy of centers, ultimately going to the top-ranked center in the system: Teoti­huacan. In this model, all interaction is hierarchi­cal with little or no exchange among regional centers of equal rank. This model is at least par­tially supported by the data for exchange, and I do not dispute its utility for understanding macrore­gional processes. However, it presents only part of the picture. Previous research has demonstrated diversity in how settlements on the Gulf Coast interacted with Teotihuacan and with each other (Arnold and Pool 2008; Pool 2006; Stark 1990). The current study goes a step further to identify variability of the network connections among neighboring settlements within the Tuxtlas . 
As Jennings (2006) argues, core-periphery mod­els emphasize direct links between the core and periphery, but neglect regionalism. In terms of the currentresearch,Matacapan's political peers, Toto­capan and Teotepec, sit in a blind spot of core­periphery models because these centers did not forge direct connections to the "core." The dendritic model, in particular, would predict very little inter­action among these three polities. The data pre­sented in this paper contradict this notion. While Jennings raises important issues for interaction studies in ancient states, I depart from his critique on one issue. The primary flaw with the core­periphery approach is not precisely that it neglects regionalism, but that it glosses over how interac­tions at the interregional level articulate with regional-scale networks. 
Interregional scale interactions introduce for­eign materials, people, goods, and ideas into the local system. How these stimuli are adopted, used, or rejected across the landscape depends largely on negotiations among different local groups. This contact between distant polities is one class of event (see Beck et al. 2007) that has the potential to dis­rupt established local institutions and cause rapid change. Each node (settlement or in di vi dual) in the regional network may react differently to new infor­mation. Differential negotiation of these inputs fos­ters social contrasts across the cultural landscape. This process of regional differentiation is termed cultural divergence, a concept that has roots in biol­ogy (Darwin 2010 [1859]) and anthropology (Flan­nery and Marcus 2003; Sahlins and Service 1960:49-53; Steward 1955:11-12). 
Cultural divergences may either enhance or inhibit interaction networks. At the core of this dis­tinction is the degree to which groups compete over the same material or ideological resources. Ideo­logical differences, for example, may lead to hos­tility between divergent groups . Polities competing for land and material resources may fall into per­petual warfare. However, not all interactions among diverse groups are contentious. Differentiated eco­nomic specialization among groups in a region, for example, may actually facilitate regional coopera­tion and exchange. The diversification of network participation inevitably results in a greater diver­sity of goods, values, and ideas that circulate among its settlements. Each group develops privileged access to certain commodities , materials, and knowledge that others lack. This diversification and specialization of regional networks has the potential to enhance material and cultural exchanges among settlements that otherwise show little in common. 
With these points in mind, I am not exclusively concerned with mapping the network of produc­tion and distribution for Coarse Orange pottery of different compositions. More importantly, I want to express how the network of Coarse Orange pro­duction and exchange articulates with other patterns of interaction in the Tuxtla region. Did the exchange of Coarse Orange pottery map onto the Matacapan political domain, leaving the other regional poli­ties to produce this ware independently? Did the exchange of these vessels from Matacapan follow the distribution ofTeotihuacan symbols and goods through the region? How do patterns of pottery exchange compare to the exchange of obsidian tools and raw materials across the regional land­scape? Does social identity inferred from material culture and architectural styles serve as a predictor of economic exchange? 
Geopolitical History and Economy in the Southwestern Tuxtla Mountains 
A group bearing ceramic artifacts, architectural forms, and green obsidian associated with Teoti­huacan established Matacapan during the Early Classic period (A.D. 300---450) (Arnold and Sant­ley 2008; Ortiz and Santley 1998; Pool 1992; Sant­ley et al. I 987). This land had been previously abandoned following a volcanic eruption near the

end of the Protoclassic period (Pool and Britt 2000; Santley et al. 2000). Matacapan was the only regional center in the Catemaco Valley during the Early Classic (Santley and Arnold 1996:234), but settlement expanded outward during the Middle Classic (AD. 450-650) into a three-tiered settle­ment hierarchy (Santley 1994; Santley and Arnold 1996: 234-235). 
Besides Matacapan, the Middle Classic Catemaco Valley hosted two other large centers . Ranchoapan , located a few kilometers to the west, developed concurrently with Matacapan. Over the Classic period, Matacapan and Ranchoapan inter­acted closely. In addition to their proximity, they display similar material culture styles. Ranchoapan adopted the Teotihuacan symbolism present at Mat­acapan. Also, the data suggest that these two cen­ters served complementary economic roles in the region , one based on ceramic production and the other on obsidian. To the east, Teotepec flourished in the Middle Classic and also displays evidence of interaction with Matacapan (Arnold and Van­Derwarker 2008; Santley and Arnold 1996; Stoner et al. 2008). Teotepec likely commanded its own political domain independently ofMatacapan. Both Teotepec and Ranchoapan increased slightly in size in the Late Classic period while Matacapan was in decline . 
The Tepango Valley Archaeological Survey (TVAS), which I directed in 2007, targeted Toto­capan and its southern hinterland for extensive sur­vey (Figure 2, Supplemental Figure 1). Totocapan has a long history of development from the Mid­dle Formative (900--400 B.C.) through the Late Classic (A.D. 650-800) (Ortiz 1975; Stoner2011). At 585ha, this site is almost as large as Matacapan (-600 ha, measured from the digitized site bound­ary polygon using ArcGIS 9 .3), and the number and size of monumental constructions at Totocapan ( 127 mounds) surpasses Matacapan ( 107 mounds). Based on a comparison of size, architectural com­plexity, and regional settlement hierarchies, the Totocapan regime commanded an independent polity that covered a territory about the same size as Matacapan (Stoner 20 12a) . 
Besides Totocapan, two other large centers were identified within the TVAS . Xiguipilincan, located at the southwestern comer of the TVAS (see Fig­ure 2), rose to prominence during the Middle and Late Classic periods. At the southeastern comer of the TVAS, Tilzapote emerged as a secondary cen­ter due to its role in regulating interactions across

the boundary zone between polities (Stoner 20 l 2a). Both Xiguipilincan and Tilzapote rose to the top of the regional hierarchy while Totocapan began to lose its power at the end of the Late Classic. This temporal pattern resembles the trajectory observed among Matacapan, Ranchoapan, and Teotepec, which may suggest that the fortunes of the two polity capitals were linked. 
Symbolic Networks in 
Middle Classic Tuxtla Mountains 
Settlements throughout the southwestern Tuxtla Mountains share a rather homogeneous set of everyday material styles that differentiate this region from other Gulf Coast regions (Daneels 2006) . Stylistic uniformity may signify many things, including shared social identity, shared tech­nological knowledge, or use of common raw mate­rials. Atop this substrate of regional stylistic commonalities, however, are more overt expres­sions of identity that pattern distinctively across the landscape. 
For Matacapan, Teotihuacan symbols likely rep­resent the promotion of an official state identity and ideology. Consumption of these symbols extends from Matacapan -which is the most central node connecting settlements in the Tuxtlas to Teotihuacan-down the Catemaco River and west to Ranchoapan (Santley 2007:Figure 6.4). Despite strong evidence for economic interaction with Mat­acapan, intensive research at Teotepec has not yielded any Teotihuacan-related ceramic materials (Arnold and VanDerwarker 2008; Santley 2007:166--167). In the Tepango Valley, very few tenuous Teotihuacan stylistic affinities appear. These few Teotihuacan symbols cluster mostly in the south-central and southeast comers of the sur­vey area around Tilzapote (see Figure 2). This pat­tern likely developed through its relative proximity to Matacapan and its position on the most easily traveled route connecting settlements across the two valleys. Totocapan itself did not possess sig­nificant stylistic connections to either Matacapan or Teotihuacan (Stoner 2011:413-418). 
As a proxy for Totocapan influence, I present the distribution of a standardized set of ceramic attributes on bowls that depict saurian imagery, referred to as the Cipactli Cult (Stoner 2011:418-425). The Cipactli Cult, as practiced in the Tepango Valley, appears to have originated at 
Totocapan, as these materials are most abundant there. I argue here that promotion of this ideology augmented rituals held at Totocapan and provided portable media through which its leaders promoted their ideas to the countryside. Sacrifices were offered to Cipactli -the primordial monster asso­ciated with the underworld, water, fertility, and cycles of death and rebirth-at other settlements in the Gulf Coast region (Arias 2007; Sanchez 1999). At Totocapan this cult may have been linked to the playing of the ballgame (Stoner 20 l 2b). Ball­game paraphernalia appear in the same context as Cipactli Cult materials in excavations undertaken by Valenzuela (1 945b ). A connection between saurian deities and the ballgame was not unique to Totocapan, as a saurian imitator appears splayed across a ball court in the central Mexican Codex Borgia. Cipactli Cult bowls occur principally at Totocapan and in its environs, but examples occur at and around nearly every regional center in the TVAS. No Cipactli Cult vessels have been identi­fied at Matacapan or in the Catemaco Valley (Ortiz and Santley 1988), though it was never the focus of an intentional search. Most importantly, the inferred symbols of each regime intermingle in the southeast comer of the TVAS area. 
Another line of data useful for detecting social contrasts in a region is architectural layout. I fol­low approaches to urbanism that see the built envi­ronment as a form of nonverbal communication (Rapoport 1982, 1990; Smith 2007). From the con­figuration of monumental architecture in space, the researcher can make qualitative inferences regard­ing possible political relationships among centers in a region (Ashmore and Sabloff 2002; Moore 1996; Pool 2008; Smith 2007; Trigger 1990). Toto­capan, Matacapan, and Teotepec presented differ­ent architectural patterns at their monumental cores. Totocapan and Teotepec display versions of stan­dardized architectural layouts seen throughout cen­tral and southern Veracruz. Plaza Group 1 at Totocapan resembles the square plaza and single­long-mound configuration of some Late Classic "Standard Plan" architecture at Cerro de las Mesas and sites further to the west (cf. Daneels 2002; Stark 1999; Stoner 20 1 2a). Interestingly, Totoca­pan also shares a number of ceramic material cul­ture traits with Cerro de las Mesas and surrounding settlements, such as double-slipped and bi-slipped wares, pottery that resembles Acula-Red-Orange,

and use of simple volutes as decorative motifs (see Stark 1998, 2001). Versions of the standard plan were recorded at all but one of the Middle Classic regional centers in the Tepango Valley. 2 Those at secondary and tertiary TVAS centers are fully enclosed, square plaza groups.An alternative archi­tectural program occurs at Teotepec and other set­tlements in the southern Tuxtlas foothills and the Coatzacoalcos Basin (cf. Arnold and VanDer­warker 2008; Borstein 2001; Dominguez 2001; Urcid and Killion 2008). The Long Plaza Group exhibits a rectangular plaza enclosed on both edges by parallel long mounds and on the long axis by a temple mound and a low platform. 
It appears that an architectural style boundary occurred somewhere in the Tuxtla Mountains. Nei­ther Matacapan nor any settlement along the Catemaco River displays strong affiliations with either of the aforementioned architectural tradi­tions. Architects at Matacapan did construct plaza groups, but they were differently configured in space. The most important plaza group at the site integrated the talud tablero style made popular at Teotihuacan (Valenzuela 1945a) . Moreover, all architecture at Matacapan was arranged around what was perhaps the largest central plaza in the Classic Gulf Coast region (Santley et al. 1985:30). Central plazas of this size are rare at other centers in the region, which favor smaller, modular arrangements of buildings. 
Systems of Ceramic Production and Exchange 
While Matacapan provided several civic and ritual functions for the inhabitants of the Catemaco Val­ley, the data suggest that control over the produc­tion and exchange of certain goods was a key component of its political power (Santley 1994). The economic system of the Catemaco Valley was such that specialized craft production occurred mainly within regional centers. Specialized pro­duction did rarely occur in hamlets and villages . The most notable case of specialized production was pottery manufacture at Matacapan (Pool 2003:64--66; Santley et al. 1989). The ceramic pro­duction system at this center was highly variable, consisting of low-intensity production for use exclusively in the same household, household industries with at least some production for exchange, an attached workshop, and two large independent workshops that provisioned parts of the Tuxtlas with well-made utilitarian and prestige ceramics (Arnold et al. 1993; Pool 1990; Santley et al. 1989; Stoner et al. 2008). 
Coarse Orange jars tempered with fine volcanic ash were the most intensively manufactured pottery vessels at Matacapan (Amold etal. 1993; Pool 1990; Santley et al. 1989). These are well-made utilitar­ian pots, often slipped and painted with geometric designs with at least one example of use as a funer­ary um (on display at the Museo Tuxteco in San­tiago Tuxtla [Figure 3]). The Coarse Orange type is a narrowly defined category that encompasses lit­tle variability relative to others in the regional ware­type-variety system (Ortiz and Santley 1988; Pool 1990:265-268, 283-286, 295-296). While Coarse Orange was not exclusively made during the Mid­dle Classic, it was most popular then. 
Coarse Orange pottery was produced in a vari­ety of settings at Matacapan, but three production areas specialized in making these pots. Coarse Orange was the primary ware manufactured by an attached production area ("Pit 6") in central Mat­acapan and at two large production areas on the southwestern edge of the site: Comoapan (Area 411) and Area 199. Comoapan, in particular, was Matacapan's largest-scale ceramic workshop com­plex (Arnold et al. 1993; Santley et al . 1989; Pool 1990:222-230). Evidence of pottery production at Comoapan covered more than 4 ha. Excavations and surface reconnaissance revealed 36 updraft kilns and several large waster dumps. Product spe­cialization at Comoapan was unusually high . Coarse Orange jars made up 66 percent of all exca­vated rim sherds (Pool 1990:228). 
Only 23 percent of sites in the Middle Classic Catemaco Valley show evidence of ceramic pro­duction of any kind (Santley and Arnold 1996:236), though low intensity production is probably under­represented (Stark 2007; Stark and Garraty 2004). Given that ceramics, particularly the Coarse Orange type, appear at nearly every Classic period site throughout the Catemaco Valley (Santley 199 1), intersite ceramic exchange was likely. The cumu­lative output of Coarse Orange jars from Comoa­pan and Area 199 alone exceeds the estimated consumption requirements of Matacapan, indicat­ing some exchange beyond the site's boundaries (Arnold et al. 1993). 
Previous NAA and petrographic assays demon­strate that the paste recipe formulated by Comoa-

pan occurs throughout the Catemaco Valley, but it is less well represented at sites near the western val­ley margin (Site 154, Site 170) and atTres Zapotes, a large center west of the Tuxtla Mountains that was in decline by the Middle Classic (Stoner et al. 2008). Interpolating this fall-off pattern into the Tepango and Xoteapan valley suggests that the Comoapan paste recipe would form a minority of the Coarse Orange sample investigated from the Tepango Valley. Distance from Matacapan, politi­cal differences, and the existence of chemically different geological materials all add to the proba­bility that Tepango Valley settlements did not con­sume pottery from Matacapan . This hypothesis is tested below. 
Currently available evidence for pottery pro­duction at Totocapan consists of a few small-scale production loci attached to elite households (Stoner 201 1 :438). However, one cannot directly compare production evidence at Totocapan to Matacapan. While Matacapan was intensively surveyed and excavated, Totocapan was only subjected to exten­sive survey techniques (but see Pool [2003:64-66] for a similar comparison between Matacapan and Tres Zapotes). At least one large-scale pottery pro­duction workshop occurred outside Totocapan. Sur­vey at the small village of El Nopal, located about 4km to the east of Totocapan, yielded a high num­ber of partially vitrified and warped waster sherds (n = 128) and high sherd densities over a large area. While potters did produce some Coarse Orange jars there, the percentages for types represented among the wasters are 81 percent Fine Gray dishes , 7 percent Coarse Brown cazuelas, 5 percent Coarse Brown jars, 5 percent Coarse Orange jars, and 2 percent unidentified. 
Obsidian Tool Production and Exchange 
Obsidian from the Zaragoza-Oyameles source in Puebla dominates all Classic period assemblages in the Tuxtlas (Santley et al. 2001; Stoner 2011 :466), suggesting that most sites participated in the same obsidian distribution network. Green obsidian is not so evenly distributed across the region. Matacapan imported green obsidian from the Teotihuacan-controlled Pachuca source. It was then traded through more restricted networks (Sant­ley 1989; Santley and Arnold 2005). This material occurs primarily as finished blades, with very lit­tle evidence of blade production or importation of raw materials (Santley 1989). Green obsidian occurs in its highest percentages at Matacapan ( 13 .3 percent in the late Middle Classic) and Teotepec 
(12.l percent of all obsidian recovered at the site) (Santley and Arnold 2005). Given the demonstrated connection between Matacapan and Teotihuacan, and the lack of such a connection evidenced at Teotepec, I infer that Teotepec was a consumer of this obsidian traded in from Matacapan. Many other sites in the Catemaco Valley possessed green obsid­ian tools in lower proportions. Green obsidian blades also made their way into the Tepango Val-

ley, with the highest percentages found in the south­east comer of the TVAS along the Xoteapan fork (a tributary of the Tepango River) (Stoner 2011:471-474) (Figure 2). Tilzapote and nearby sites account for 55 percent of all green obsidian in the TVAS area during the combined Early and Middle Classic period. In contrast, survey at Toto­capan returned only one piece of green obsidian out of225 total pieces. Tilzapote generally had greater access to all obsidian than most settlements. Twelve of 18 collections at Tilzapote possessed obsidian­to-ceramic ratios above the median for the TVAS; four of those collections were in the upper decile for the project area (maximum for the site is .85). 
Ranchoapan produced obsidian tools on a rela­tively large scale compared to other settlements in the Tuxtlas . Barrett (2003:222-223; see also Sant­ley and Arnold 2005: 188), however, argues that Ranchoapan was not a major mover or producer of stone tools on the macroregional scale (compared to Tula or Colha) and that most production was for local use in specialized contexts. That said, the scale of tool production in the northern portion of the site, combined with the lack of blade produc­tion evidence at many other sites in the region, points to some intersite exchange of blades. Inter­estingly, Ranchoapan possessed among the lowest percentages of green obsidian of any site during the Classic period (Santley and Arnold 2005: 188), which suggests that the flow of these tools into the Tepango Valley came directly from Matacapan. Matacapan also displays evidence for production of obsidian tools, butthese tended to be smaller pro­duction contexts that did not likely provision a large part of the region. 
No obsidian workshop in the Tepango Valley came close to the inferred intensity of blade pro­duction at Ranchoapan. Data from the site of Otea­pan, however, point toward production for exchange during the Late Classic. This site, located 3 km south ofTotocapan, yielded the highest quan­tity of blade production by-products in the TVAS, but relatively few blades were recovered there. The ratio of blade production by-products to blades in the southern portion ofOteapan is .74 (32 by-prod­ucts/43 blades) . This suggests that more blades were produced there than anywhere else in the val­ley, but they were not consumed on-site. I suggest, based on its proximity and size, that the largest consumer of these blades was Totocapan, a site with only one blade production by-product identi­fied out of 39 Late Classic blades. Many blade pro­duction indicators were also identified in spatially discrete zones of Tilzapote, but the industry does not appear to have been an intensive endeavor. 
In general , it appears that Totocapan and Mata­capan served very different economic functions with respect to their hinterlands. While Matacapan provisioned many sites in the region with goods, Totocapan produced few ceramics or obsidian tools for exchange outside the city (with the possible exception of Cipactli Cult ceramics). Totocapan appears to have relied instead on nearby producers of ceramics and obsidian. It must be stressed that these are preliminary findings for the Tepango Val­ley. The Catemaco valley has seen a much greater intensity of work, including excavations and more intensive surveys at several sites. 
Reconstruction of Political Boundaries in the Classic Tuxtla Mountains 
Elsewhere, I have evaluated and characterized political boundaries (and the strength of political relationships over space and time) among the Mata­capan, Totocapan, and Teotepec polities based on several variables: location, scale, magnitude of political control over space, gradient of authority between polities, permeability of the boundary to interactions, the internal spatial continuity of authority within the polity, and stability of the boundary over time (Stoner 20 1 2a). Part of this reconstruction relied on the distribution of mater­ial culture styles and architectural layouts as sum­marized above. Additional lines of evidence are presented here. 
All three of these political capitals were of rel­atively equal size and architectural complexity. Totocapan, Matacapan, and Teotepec all possess between 100 and 130 mounds of varying sizes and layouts. While Matacapan (ca. 600 ha) and Toto­capan (ca. 585 ha) were of relatively equal size, Teotepec is estimated to have covered only about 
100 ha. Due to differences in ground cover between Matacapan and Teotepec, however, the size of the latter may have been underestimated during the initial survey. 
Another method of evaluating polity boundaries summarized here depends on the distribution of settlements across space. Between the large cen­ters of Tilzapote and Ranchoapan lies a sparsely

inhabited area that may have served as a buffer zone. Buffer zones may show a concern for defense or they may reflect the practical concern of being closely situated to cities that provide centralized functions (see Blanton et al. 1993:69-72). I employed Xtent modeling (Renfrew and Level 1979) in ArcGIS 9 .3, modified to incorporate cost distance (the energy or effort required to travel over terrain of different slopes). This model allocates ter­ritories to political centers, weighted by their size (in hectares) and least-cost paths throughout the region. Relying on this model alone is problematic, so I characterized the boundaries using multiple lines of evidence according to the variables men­tioned above (Stoner 2012a). The projected Mid­dle Classic political boundary between Matacapan and Totocapan goes through Tilzapote. This polit­ical boundary was not a hard border because the symbols of both polities comingled in the south­eastern comer of the TVAS . The boundary was per­meable to the movement of ideas , goods , and ceramic traditions.Alternatively, the intermingling of different styles may indicate that the political boundary was unstable and fluctuated many times over the 200-year Middle Classic period. The same methods used to infer this political boundary sug­gests that Teotepec was not part of the Matacapan polity, but we have relatively few data points to establish this argument for that side of the study area. I return to consider the possible exchange of Coarse Orange jars between Matacapan and Teote­pec below. 
Summary 
This review paints a complex picture of interaction in the Tuxtlas region. During the Classic period, the introduction of foreign influence at Matacapan disrupted the localized trajectory of evolution in the Catemaco Valley (Arnold and Santley 2008; Pool and Britt 2000; Santley et al. 1987). This contrasts with autochthonous cultural developments better represented at places like Totocapan, Teotepec, and Tres Zapotes. Over time, the different settlement zones developed divergent cultural practices. Teoti­huacan rituals and ideals predominated along the Catemaco River, but prominent settlements estab­lished Jong before Matacapan did not adopt these intrusive symbols. Totocapan, instead, presents evi­dence of interactions with settlements in the Lower Papaloapan Basin to the west. 
Some sites, like Teotepec, which did not align itself with Teotihuacan, interacted closely with Matacapan to procure pottery and Teotihuacan­controlled green obsidian. Other sites, like Ran­choapan, display Teotihuacan-style artifacts but Jack the green obsidian exported from the central Mexican city. The foreign disruption also may have affected urban planning, as Matacapan and all set­tlements along the Catemaco River rejected the pervasive Gulf Coast architectural plans seen at Tepango Valley (Standard Plan) settlements and at Teotepec (Long Plaza group). Furthermore, the talud tablero architectural style that dominated Teotihuacan appears on at least two mound con­structions at Matacapan (Valenzuela 1945a). In sum, these multiscalar interaction networks across the Tuxtlas display disjoint patterns over space and time. Missing from this reconstruction are data on the distribution of Matacapan-produced Coarse Orange pottery, which was that site's most eco­nomically important ceramic ware . 
Geology and Ceramic Resources in the Tuxtla Mountains 
The Tuxtla Mountains are an island of volcanic activity on the relatively flat coastal plain east of Mexico's Sierra Madre Oriental . The Tuxtlas mas­sif formed during intensive volcanic activity that began during the late Miocene. This volcanism continued through the Pliocene and Pleistocene, but tapered off into the Holocene (Martin del Pozzo 1997; Rfos 1952; Reinhardt 1991). Pressure that resulted from volcanic activity domed up the over­lying Tertiary marine deposits. Eruptions deposited copious flows of lava over the region (Dirzo and Vogt 1997) , which cooled slowly and formed fine­gained to coarse-grained olivine, pyroxene, and plagioclase-rich basalts. Explosive Strombolian eruptions shot volcanic ash clouds into the air. This volcanic ash, which is composed of the same min­erals as basalt (Stoner 2003), is found in thick beds in many places throughout the Tuxtlas. Volcanic ash was used to temper prehispanic pottery, including Coarse Orange. 
Of particular importance to understand pottery economics in this study is the surface distribution ofTertiary marine clays. High-quality clay was, and still is, available for making pottery in the region (Arnold 1991;Pool 1990:148-161;PoolandSant-

ley 1992; Stoner 2003). Rios (1952:328) charac­terized the sedimentary geological formations of the Tuxtlas. From oldest to most recent, these are La Laja/Deposito, Concepcion, and Filisola (see Pool 1990: 148-161 for a comprehensive descrip­tion ofTuxtlas strata). Pool (1990:307-314) estab­lished that certain ceramic wares-specifically Fine Orange (including Fine Buff), Fine Gray, and Coarse Orange -were manufactured from Con­cepcion clays. Quaternary clays, which include smectite that forms around basalt outcrops, were probably used for other wares, such as Coarse Brown (Pool 1990). The Concepcion formation composition gradually shifts stratigraphically, so a distinction between upper and lower Concepcion can be made (Pool 1990; Pool and Santley 1992). Plio-pleistocene and recent volcanic rocks have formed on top of these older horizons (Pool 1990:148). 
The Concepcion strata are composed primarily of kaolinite clay minerals. Concepcion clays dif­fer from the stratigraphically superior Filisola for­mation because the latter is composed primarily of quartz sands and sandstone. Filisola sands are the most accessible Tertiary formations in the Tuxtlas because they are the most recent. The Concepcion outcrops at several places where river valleys cut through Quaternary soils, volcanic ejecta, and Fil­isola sands. The Concepcion strata gradually tran­sition into the Filisola formation; thus, clays taken from the top of the upper Concepcion should por­tray some of the characteristics of the Filisola. This provides an interesting source of stratigraphic vari­ation that benefits compositional sourcing studies (Pool 1990:148-161; Pool and Santley 1992; Stoner 2003; Stoner et al. 2008). Martfn de! Pozzo (1 997:27) notes that the lower Filisola has inclu­sions of fine calcareous minerals, and the middle layers contain volcanic material and mica. 
The clay formations discussed above are exposed on the surface in distinct areas of the Tux­tlas (Figure 4). Erosion that incised river valleys into the Tuxtlas massif exposed Concepcion clays in several parts of the region. The Catemaco and Tepango Rivers exposed these clays to different depths. Pool's (1990) X-ray fluorescence analysis of ceramics and clays demonstrated an east-to­west pattern of chemical variation among the clays in the Tuxtlas. Group C, which is calcium-rich, occurs in the eastern portion of the study area around Ma tac a pan (Pool 1990: 311). The Catemaco River exposed clays of the lower Con­cepcion. The higher calcium content of Group C clays of the lower Concepcion is attributed to higher frequencies of carbonate minerals and lower concentrations of quartz sand. Group S clays appear farther to the west and southwest of the Catemaco River and within the Tepango River val­ley. It also occurs high in the exposed stratigraphy near Bezuapan, but was not used because Group C clays were more accessible and of finer texture. Group S has significantly lower concentrations of calcium and is also elevated in iron and titanium (Pool 1990:345, 376, 379; Stoner 2003). The Group S clays derive from the upper Concepcion formation, which has fewer carbonate mineral inclusions and greater frequencies of quartz sand. 
Volcanic ash, a common temper for ceramic production, occurs at many locations throughout the region. The Strombolian eruptions that occurred most recently in the Tuxtlas were of a very explo­sive and gaseous variety (Santley et al. 2000). This translates into a polymineralic ash that is a combi­nation of exploded basalt and small bits of cooled lava that are spewed into the air. Each ash grain contains mineral crystals of plagioclase, olivine, or pyroxene. Although volcanic ash occurs as lenses in the La Laja Formation and is dispersed in the middle member of the Filisola Formation, it is not described for the Concepcion Formation (Martfn­Del Pozzo 1997:27; Pool 1990:150; Rios 1957: 335-337). The absence of basaltic volcanic ash from the Concepcion formation is further supported by elemental concentrations in 80 Concepcion clay samples analyzed by XRF (Pool 1990:307-312, Table 19). In particular, clays derived from basalt were easily distinguished from Concepcion clays, and basalt contamination in two samples collected near lava flows was readily identified (Pool 1990:309, 310). 
I analyzed by neutron activation analysis (NAA) one volcanic ash sample (Stoner 2003), collected by Pool (1990) for his doctoral work.Additionally, volcanic ash grains within 50 Coarse Orange sherds were targeted using laser ablation-inductively cou­pled plasma-mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) (see Stoner and Glascock 2012). These volcanic ash specimens displayed high concentrations of chromium, iron, nickel,manganese, vanadium, and scandium relative to the clays in the region. Rein-

hardt (1991) identified chemical variation among the ash beds found in the Tuxtlas, but it was due primarily to differential weathering and will not be useful for sourcing to a geographic location. 
Distribution of the Coarse Orange Type 
Coarse Orange is a common ceramic type in the Catemaco River valley. It occurs at nearly all sites that were occupied during the Middle Classic period. The Coarse Orange type is very distinctive and relatively standardized in form, color, texture, temper size and percentage, and decoration. It occurs as neckless jars with an out-flaring lip or necked jars with long, straight, and out-slanted rims with everted lips (Pool 1990:295-296). Bowls of this type were rare in the TVAS (n = 50 or 3 per­cent of the Coarse Orange type). Texture refers to the tactile characteristics of the pottery. Since the same clay is used to produce the soft, chalky Fine Orange and Fine Gray ceramics, it is common that the surface of the ceramics is slightly eroded, leav­ing the fine to medium sand-sized volcanic ash temper exposed. The texture of the slightly eroded surfaces, therefore, feels like a very uniform 60 or 80-grit sand paper. Decoration, when preserved, always consists of black and/or red paint over a white or cream slip or the natural colorof the paste. 
Coarse Orange jars generally occurred in lower frequencies in the TVAS area than in the Catemaco Valley (Table 1 and Figure 5). A total of I ,723 sherds were typed as Coarse Orange (3 .3 percent of all pottery sherds recovered by the TVAS). This ceramic code was rigorously maintained as a cat­egory, including only those Coarse Orange speci­mens that were visually indistinguishable from the Coarse Orange produced at Matacapan based on form, color, texture, slip, temper type, temper size, and temper amount. 
Table 1 and Figure 5 depict the proportion of Coarse Orange among all Middle Classic-sensi­tive pottery for sites that yielded I 0 or more sherds

of this type. The Coarse Orange type composed a much larger part of Middle Classic ceramic assem­blages in the eastern half of the survey area. Pro­portions of this type decrease with distance from Matacapan, suggesting that the political capital of the Catemaco Valley was either the origin of the Coarse Orange style or it was the primary producer of these jars that were then distributed to the coun­tryside. 
Tres Zapotes, the western-most site sampled for my earlier compositional analysis (Stoner 2003), produced a very low proportion of Coarse Orange jar sherds from survey. Many of the sherds classi­fied as Coarse Orange during analysis of survey materials from Tres Zapotes (Pool 1997) displayed characteristics that could be visually distinguished 
Compositional groups indicate statistically sig­nificant chemical or mineral variation in the pastes of the sample that arose from differences in paste preparation or raw material procurement (Arnold etal.1991; Glascock 1992; Neff2000; Weigand et al . 1977) . Groups are formed through hierarchical cluster analysis , principal component analysis, Mahalanobis distance-based probabilities, and visual inspection of elemental plots. My objective is to form robust groups that remain coherent no matter what statistics are used to evaluate or dis­play them. The geographic distribution of such groups allows archaeologists to reconstruct zones of production and exchange on a general level . Supplementary data on ceramic production and resource availability allow a more specific charac­terization of patterns of exchange observed in the compositional data.

Coarse Orange Chemical Groups 
Figure 6, a scatter plot of the NAA data from the Tepango/Xoteapan Valley Coarse Orange sample, analyzed as part of the current project, displayed over 90 percent confidence ellipses for member­ship in the Coarse Orange reference groups. A 90 percent confidence interval provides a slightly more conservative estimate of group membership than a 95 percent interval. My initial hypothesis that most of the sample from the Tepango Valley would be made from Group S clays prevalent in the area was mostly wrong. The majority of specimens in the Tepango Valley possessed the CO 1 paste recipe made from Group C clays available in the Catemaco Valley. 
Statistical analyses were calculated on the entire 462-specimen sample for the combined ceramic and clay dataset described above. Prin­cipal components analysis provides a first look at chemical patterns. The first two components explain 60 percent of the variability among the chemical data (Table 3). The most influential vari­ables on Principal Component 1 are Ca, Sr, Cr, and Ni, in order of decreasing importance. As seen in Figure 7, Ca and Sr are highly correlated and explain variation along the same axis. Chromium and Ni, however, diverge from Ca and become the most important counterparts to Ca on Principal Component 2. The chemical groups dif­ferentiate using either Principal Components I and 2 (Figure 7) or elemental concentrations of

ments compared to the raw clays. These include Cr, Fe, Ni, Mn, and V. The addition of volcanic ash temper, therefore, separates Coarse Orange pottery from the composition of the natural clays (Figure 10). In Figure 10, Group C and Group S clays clearly display the lowest concentrations of the most important elements contributed by volcanic ash (Cr and Ni). Group COP6, Coarse Orange from an attached production facility in central Mataca­pan (excavation Pit 6), contains the lowest per­centage of temper in the paste. As a result, COP6 displays lower levels of Cr and Ni than the major­ity of the Coarse Orange pottery. 
Four groups of Coarse Orange and two groups of clays separate V;'ithin tn chemical dataset. Both clay groups (Group C and Group S) score lower than most ceramics on Principal Components 1 and 2 (see Figure 7). Among the clays, Group C scores higher on Principal Component 2 (influenced strongly by high Ca and Sr). Group S scores lower on PC2 (indicating lower Ca and Sr concentra­tions) and higher on Principal Component I (influ­enced mainly by negatively loaded Ca, Sr, Cr, and Ni). I briefly describe each compositional group below (Table 4).

Ceramics within Coarse Orange Group I (COi) are potential products of Matacapan . Group CO i scores higher on Principal Component 2 and lower on Principal Component I than Coarse Orange Group 2 (C02) (see Figure 7).

(.1 25-.249 mm) and medium (.250-.499 mm) sand-sized volcanic ash temper and contain very few quartz inclusions larger than very fine sand ( < .125). Potters began with very fine-textured clay and improved its technological performance char­acteristics (Schiffer and Skibo 1997) by adding fine to medium volcanic ash. 
For this paper, I am concerned specifically with identifying possible exports from Matacapan's Comoapan production facility. Many of the Tepango Valley specimens fall outside the CO 1 group previously established for Coarse Orange from the Catemaco VaJiey. Claiming that aJI CO 1 ceramics were products of Comoapan would over­state the importance of this production facility. Therefore, I separated the COl specimens that scored comparatively high on both PC l and PC2 as subgroup COIB, leaving the COIA variant to represent the most plausible products of Comoa­pan (see Figures 7-9). COIB may consist of rela­tively lightly-tempered pots compared to the COl A subgroup. 
Dividing COi into subgroups accounts for the majority of the unassigned specimens in the sam­ple (21 percent) (see Figure 8). Forcing unassigned specimens into the subgroups would overestimate the number of ceramics that match the Comoapan production source. I prefer the more conservative assessment at this time . It should be noted, how­ever, that most of the unassigned samples can be confidently assigned to the general COI group made from group C clays. 
C02 

Group C02 ceramics are the second most abun­dant paste recipe found in the project area. They display significantly lower concentrations of Ca than the COl ceramics, exhibited by its lower scores on PC2. This results primarily from the use of the Ca-deficient Group S clays. These clays, as viewed in ceramic thin sections, contain many rounded, sand-sized quartz inclusions, which may dilute the levels of Ca. Volcanic Ash temper in C02 ceramics frequently has grain sizes of medium and coarse sand. Considering both quartz sand inclu­sions and temper together, C02 is the coarsest Coarse Orange sampled. Because Group S clays are most prevalent in the Tepango and Xoteapan valleys, locally-produced Coarse Orange jars sam­pled from the TVAS should possess the C02 paste recipe. This is supported by previous research by Pool (1990:318-320) demonstrating that Fine

Orange ceramics from Totocapan were made with Group S clays. 
C03 
Coarse Orange Group 3 (C03) is a variant of Coarse Orange produced within the southern and western parts of the study area. Relatively few spec­imens are assigned to C03, and most derive from the Hueyapan Survey area in the southern Tuxtla foothills. These ceramics were produced using Group S clays. C03 ceramics contained many 
sand-sized quartz inclusions. Comparatively low quantities of volcanic ash temper were added to this already coarse clay, which resulted in lower con­centrations of Cr, Ni, Mn, Fe, and V compared to the other ceramic specimens. The heterogeneous composition of temper suggests that potters may have gathered it from river sediment. Little is cur­rently known about ceramic production within the Hueyapan Survey area. 
COP6 
Coarse Orange Group "Pit 6" (COP6) ceramics produced at Matacapan separate statistically in the petrographic dataset (Stoner et al. 2008). Visual inspection of the scatterplot of chemical groups shows three of the COP6 ceramics clustering together between the major ceramic clusters and the Group C clays. The other two actually appear chemically closer to C02. It is doubtful that the lat­ter were produced with Group S clays because of their very fine texture. Group COP6 possesses the fine-textured Group C clay tempered very lightly with fine sand-sized volcanic ash. This demon­strates the role of the percentage of volcanic ash temper in determining the chemical composition of ceramics. The clays utilized in this production recipe are among the finest textured, with very low frequencies of silt-sized quartz inclusions and almost no sand-sized inclusions. 
Distribution of Coarse Orange 
Paste Recipes across the Study Area 


Plotting the CO I A paste variant on a map of the region demonstrates exchange between these two river valleys (Figure 11, Supplemental Figure 2) . In general, the prevalence of Coarse Orange pot­tery of this paste recipe in the TVAS area suggests importation from the Catemaco Valley, specifically Comoapan. The lowest percentages of this paste recipe occur at sites near the hypothesized politi­cal border between Matacapan and Totocapan poli­ties, including Tilzapote and Sites 39C, 154C,

170C, and 143T (see Figure 2). The majority of Coarse Orange sampled from Totocapan, Francisco Madero, and Sites 97T and 110T display the CO lA recipe. Trade of these jars, therefore, appears to travel from Matacapan toward the northwest. Toto­capan utilized the highest proportion of these wares in the region. The COIA specimens found in the countryside immediately surrounding Totocapan could have been procured either from markets at Totocapan or perhaps from itinerant merchants from Matacapan making several stops throughout the region. Unfortunately, the mechanisms of exchange cannot, at this time, be determined with confidence. A secondary route of distribution enters the TVAS at the headwaters of the Xoteapan fork and follows the river southwest. 
Within the Tepango Valley, several sites com­pletely lack or possess very few jars of the CO 1 A paste recipe (Sites 143T, 152T,Tot6gal,andTetax). Three of these sites were situated in upland areas, and all of them were positioned at a distance from major rivers . This may support the idea that major routes of interaction followed routes of river trans­port, while the uplands remained on the margins of popular interaction networks. The scarcity of the CO lA paste recipe at Tres Zapotes is likely due to its distance from Matacapan. 
The CO I B paste recipe was also produced from the Group C clays found in the Catemaco Valley Jars of this paste recipe found in the TVAS may also have been imported. Pottery was produced a1 sites 141 T, l 44T, and Tilzapote, which are all sit­uated within the major distribution zone for this paste recipe (Figure 12, Supplemental Figure 3). All three of these sites occur within a short walk to Group C clay outcrops, but Group S clays are more prevalent in the area. Furthermore, none of these sites currently exhibit evidence (i.e., wasters) specifically of Coarse Orange production. 
The C02 paste recipe is underrepresented in the Tepango Valley (Figure 13, Supplemental Figure 4). This is surprising because the Group S clays used to produce C02 dominate clay outcrops in the area, whereas Group C clay outcrops are absent. This pattern, combined with the distribution of the Coarse Orange type as presented in Figure 5, sug­gests that only a minor percentage of the Coarse Orange jars found in the Tepango Valley was pro­duced there. The C02 recipe may have been pro­duced at Tres Zapotes, Chilchutiuca, or Sites 152T, 154C, 170C,or39C. 
The C03 paste recipe was restricted to the south­ern Tuxtla foothills and a few sites in the Tepango Valley, such as Tot6gal. These few specimens (see

Table 2) were locally produced and were probably not exchanged. 
The COP6 paste recipe exclusively appears at Matacapan in the attached production locality iden­tified in excavation Pit 6. The products from this attached producer were likely consumed by the patron who commissioned the service. 
Interpreting the Results 
Because of the prevalence of Group S clays in the Tepango Valley and Pool's previous research demonstrating that Fine Orange at Totocapan was produced using local Group S clays, the dominance of the CO 1 A paste recipe in the TVAS area strongly indicates the import of Coarse Orange jars from the Catemaco Valley. Based on data for the differen­tial size and intensity of ceramic production facil­ities in the Catemaco Valley, potters at the Comoapan facility (and possibly Area 199) likely manufactured these trade goods. 
These data strongly indicate that Totocapan and Matacapan were networked together on the regional economic landscape during the Middle Classic. The two polities cooperated to satisfy each other's economic needs for at least part of their his­tory together. The data also indicate that Totoca­pan was one of the biggest consumers of these goods. The hamlet at Site 110T consumed about equal proportions of Matacapan-produced Coarse Orange jars. Survey at Totocapan yielded more than 10 times more Coarse Orange sherds ( n = 392) compared to Site 110T (n = 36), but the ware gen­erally made up a much higher percentage of the Middle Classic ceramic assemblage at the latter (41 percent) than the former (24 percent). Zezeca­pan, Texcochapan, Maxyapan, and Site 110 may have procured Matacapan Coarse Orange inde­pendently of Totocapan because they all sat on an alternative route of river transportation along the Xoteapan fork. Perhaps more important, the other regional centers in the TVAS area did not rely heav­ily on these imported goods. Cruz de Vidana and Xiguipilincan were not sampled for NAA because not enough Coarse Orange was identified there to collect a robust sample. Tilzapote and Oteapan did possess Coarse Orange jars, but more than half were made from alternate paste recipes. Francisco Madero is the only center in the TVAS besides Totocapan that consumed significant proportions of Coarse Orange of the COIA paste recipe. 

Teotepec along the northern shore of Lake Catemaco also imported Matacapan-produced Coarse Orange. While this has been stated previ-

ously (Stoner et al. 2008), recent NAA assays by Arnold (Arnold 20 12; Arnold and VanDerwarker 2008) strengthen the argument. Ceramics made at Teotepec show a strong preference for Group S clays and a clay of intermediate composition between Group C and Group S unique to this local­ity. The C02 Coarse Orange jars previously sam­pled from Teotepec are locally produced, but jars of the COIA paste recipe came from Matacapan. 
Disjuncture among Tuxtla Mountains 
Interaction Networks 

The Teotihuacan-related disruption that caused set­tlements at Matacapan and in the Catemaco Valley to diverge from the local developmental trajecto­ries observed at Totocapan and Teotepec did not inhibit interaction among these three important polity capitals. Matacapan traded Coarse Orange jars, and possibly green obsidian, to Teotepec. While almost no green obsidian found its way to Totocapan, the Tepango Valley capital consumed the most Matacapan-Produced Coarse Orange pots of any political center in the TVAS (in both per­centage and raw quantity). 
Besides Totocapan, Matacapan-produced Coarse Orange was found primarily at villages and hamlets in the Tepango Valley. In contrast, all regional centers in the TVAS procured at least a minor quantity of Cipactli Cult ceramic vessels, probably produced at Totocapan. This reflects two distinct decision processes in the Tepango Valley. For prestige/serving ceramics, emphasis was placed on association with Totocapan . For utilitarian ceramics, consumer decisions relied on practical concerns of availability, cost, quality, and, possi­bly, reputation (as Reina and Hill [I974:237] observed for Chiconautla-made jars in Guatemala) . 
At the boundary between the Catemaco and Tepango valleys, sites underutilized Matacapan­produced wares compared to the remainder of the study area. This includes Tilzapote, which yielded both high percentages of green obsidian and sev­eral examples ofMatacapan-style bichrome ceram­ics. Given the likelihood that both green obsidian and the CO IA paste recipe originated from Mata­capan, this discrepancy suggests either that resi­dents of Tilzapote had no use for imported Coarse Orange jars, which were no doubt more "expen­sive" than locally-made jars, or perhaps that these two trade items traveled via different types of mer­chants along discrete trade routes. 
The distributions of Matacapan Coarse Orange jars, material culture styles, architectural styles, and other commodities highlight the disjunctive patterns of interaction in the Tuxtlas. It is clear that the leaders and general population of the upper Catemaco River valley saw themselves as differ­ent from neighboring settlements to the east and west. The Teotihuacan association that many in the Catemaco Valley expressed was, however, scarcely appropriated by Tepango Valley residents. Fur­thermore, the few Teotihuacan-style objects found in the TVAS area are not good predictors of trade with Matacapan, as symbolic, political, and eco­nomic interactions followed different spatial tra­jectories. Disjuncture among interaction networks prevailed because social actors throughout the region negotiated interactions with Matacapan from unique perspectives and with different local needs and motivations. 

Little to no data exists for exchange from set­tlements in the Tuxtlas to Matacapan. Certainly Matacapan leaders and craftspeople did not provi­sion the region with obsidian and ceramics out of pure generosity. Perhaps the items traded to Mat­acapan were perishable (e.g., food, textiles, and products manufactured from local flora or fauna) and therefore not detected through the methods employed by archaeologists. Raw materials for manufacture (e.g., clay, temper, basalt for making groundstone tools) and other products not found in production contexts at Matacapan may also have been imported to the site. This brings me back to Santley's (1994; see also Santley and Alexander I996) argument regarding Matacapan's position within a dendritic core-periphery system. While it does not appear that Matacapan traded Coarse Orange jars to central Mexico, as Santley originally implied (1994; cf.Arnold et al. I993), perhaps the intraregional interactions highlighted by this research functioned to accumulate a surplus of per­ishable resources at Matacapan. These locally avail­able materials were then exported to other regions that lacked direct access to them. Goods and mate­rials accessible in the region, but scarce in the semi­arid highlands, include cotton, rubber, honey, liquidambar, various flora and fauna, and tropical­bird feathers, among others. With regard to Sant­ley and Alexander's (I996) dendritic model, the

possibility remains that Matacapan fostered intrare­gional exchange relationships in order to gather resources for export to central Mexico and else­
where. The Teotihuacan relationship provided lead­ers and merchants at Matacapan with exotic goods and ideas for trade to other settlements in the region. Intensive ceramic workshops provided yet another method for Matacapan officials to intensify exchange relationships with the regional Tuxtlas population. Furthermore, the target of exchange may have been the contents of Coarse Orange jars rather than the jars themselves (Arnold et al. 1993). In any case, Coarse Orange jar production fits into a pattern of enhanced regional interconnectivity during the Middle Classic that may have implica­tions for interregional networks as well. The for­eign connections wielded by Matacapefios enhanced economic and cultural diversity in the Tuxtlas, which elevated interactions among the three polities discussed herein. 
The Tuxtlas case highlights the role of interre­gional networks in influencing patterns of regional interaction . This conclusion emphasizes the neces­sity of multiscalar analytical perspectives for ancient states. Finally, the disjunctive patterns of symbolic, political, and economic patterns described here advertise the need for more induc­tive and particularistic research that embraces intraregional variability as a potent tool to under­stand processes of cultural evolution.

Notes 
1. 
This assertion was later revised (Santley 2007: 124-125; see also Stoner et al. 2008). 

2. 
The only one that did not present a standard plan (Oteapan) is extensively disturbed by modem constructions so that formal layouts cannot be discerned.
