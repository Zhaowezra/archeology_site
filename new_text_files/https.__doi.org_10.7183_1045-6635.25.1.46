The 2011 investigations of the Caves Branch Archaeological Survey at the large and recently documented Maya site of Tipan Chen Uitz resulted in the discovery of the site'sfirst monument with a glyphic inscription. Prior to this discovery, the site's glyphic corpus was limited to a small collection of texts rendered on fragmentary ceramics. In this paper, we describe these sherds as well as the monument (Monument 1), report on their archaeological contexts, provide an epigraphic analy­sis of the texts, and consider these written sources relative to our growing understanding ofTipan and its place in the ancient political landscape. The discovery of Monument 1 is important, for it stands to contribute to sociopolitical reconstructions in this part of the central Maya Lowlands and has significant implications for the possible presence of other, as yet undis­covered, Late Classic period (A.D. 550-830) monuments at Tipan. 
Las investigaciones de la temporada de 2011 del proyecto Prospecci6n Arqueol6gica de/ Caves Branch en el sitio grande ­y recientemente documentado-de Tipan Chen Uitz resultaron en el descubrimiento del primer monumento de! sitio con una inscripci6n glifica. Previamente, el corpus glifico del sitio estaba restringido a una pequeiia colecci6n de textos fragmenta­rios realizados sobre cerdmica. En este art(culo describimos estos tiestos, el monumento ( Monumento I), y sus contextos arque­ol6gicos. Proporcionamos un andlisis epigrdfico de Los textos y consideramos estas fuentes escritas relativas a nuestro entendimiento creciente de Tipan y su lugar en el panorama politico prehispdnico. El descubrimiento de!

uneven terrain, are built of dry-laid boulder core, measure 3 to 8 m wide, and represent a major construction effort (Andres et al. 201lb). Tipan, the largest of the three sites, likely represents a polity capital wherein the satellite sites were in­tegrated into its orbit by means of the causeways (Figure 2). 
Prior to discovery of Monument 1, the site's glyphic corpus was restricted to texts rendered on fragmentary ceramic vessels. These texts, coupled with that of Monument 1, inform our under­standing of Tipan's fluctuating sociopolitical po­sition during the Classic period. Moreover, the monument's presence at a site strategically situ­ated between two primary drainages suggests that Tipan's sociopolitical importance was derived, at least in part, from its location in the physical landscape. 
Site Description and 
Summary of Investigations 

Following Tipan's discovery, a preliminary map was completed of the monumental epicenter. Ini­tial observations, relating to building sizes, court­yard counts, energetics of construction, and the variety of architectural features present, all pointed to the community's importance in antiq­uity (Andres et al. 2010, 2011a). While no single statistic satisfactorily characterizes the scale and complexity of ancient Maya sites (see Adams and Jones 1981; Hammond 1975; Helmke and Awe 2008:67-70; Turner et al. 1981), Tipan is clearly very large, suggesting that the site is best classi­fied as a major center (e.g., Bullard 1960:275; Hammond 1975:40-42; Helmke and Awe 2008:68-69, 76-78) (Table 1).

Tipan once occupied the top of a sub-regional po­litical hierarchy and is most appropriately viewed as a "primary" civic-ceremonial center (Andres et al. 2010) for the surrounding 155-km2 area (Helmke and Awe 2012:61-65).1 
The first season of investigations, in 2010, in­cluded excavations in the site's monumental epi­center and detailed topographic mapping. This work sought to clarify the occupational chronol­ogy and to illuminate key architectural features. The map shows that the epicenter extends over 
5 .2 ha and comprises 63 major structures (Gonzalez and Howell 2011:153) (Table 1 and Figure 3). The site center also includes seven plazas and five courtyards; at least five temple structures; a sunken, T-shaped ballcourt; several long range structures; three causeways; and an acropoline palatial complex measuring more than 20 min height (Andres 2011; Gonzalez and How­ell 2011; Wrobel et al. 2012). 
Excavations completed in 2010 and 2011 fo­cused primarily on structures affected by looting. Two of the locations examined included the west face of Str. A-1 (the formal approach to the pala­tial complex) and a looters' crater in Plaza A (An­dres 2011 ). These investigations provided insight into the site's construction history and helped de­fine the style of architecture that is characteristic

of Tipan and surrounding sites. Examination of the Plaza A looters' pit showed that this large plaza was raised in a single construction event by more than 3 m. While no diagnostic ceramics were recovered, the plaza's dry-laid boulder core construction is typical of sites in the area (in­cluding Pook's Hill, Cahal Uitz Na, and Deep Val­ley; see Ehret and Conlon 1999:57-62; Helmke 2009:285; Jordan 2008:65). Investigations of Str. A-I have shown that the formal approach to this first level of the palace incorporated an outset axial stairway with stair-side outsets that was modified during the Late-to-Terminal Classic pe­riod (A.D. 750-850), when a low platform was constructed over the stair's base (Andres 2011) (Figure 4). 
Both this platform and the earlier outsets were faced with slabs of dense crystalline limestone (fossiliferous limestone or micrite; see Villasenor and Helmke 2007: I 38-I 39), measuring ca. I .0 m high and 2.5 m wide and shaped via direct per­cussion (Figure 5). Although initially identified as stelae (Andres et al. 20 10), excavations have re­vealed that these slabs form part of the axial stair and associated stair-side outsets. 
Similar slabs embellish the lateral stair-side outsets of Strs. F-5 and F-7 at Tipan, indicating that this is a typical architectural feature at the site (Andres 2011). The same practice is also docu­mented at Yaxbe and Cahal Uitz Na, the satellite sites to the west (Awe and Helmke 1998:210-215, 2007:31-32; Helmke 2009:269-270, 273). Exca­vations at both Cahal Uitz Na and Tipan have made it clear that these monoliths rest directly atop the terminal plaza floor (Andres 2011; Ehret and Conlon 1999), and, as such, these slabs are better designated as "panels" that were set as bat­tered facings to the stair-side outsets. The re­peated occurrence of these panels at Ti pan and its satellites suggests that this is a characteristic ar­chitectural feature of this polity, integrated into re­gally commissioned construction. The use and placement of monolithic panels along stair-side outsets is otherwise most commonly seen at sites in the Pasion area of Guatemala, including Dos Pilas (Strs. L5-49 and L4-35), Aguateca (Strs. 1 and 133), Tamarindito (Strs. 2 and 64), La Pa­ciencia (Strs. 2 and 7), and El Excavado (Str. 1) (Houston 1993).2 
The presence of what could be termed a Pasion architectural feature at a series of west-central Belizean sites is intriguing. Recent excavations conducted by the Triangulo project (under the di­rection of Vilma Fialko) at Naranjo, revealed that

the stair-sides of Str. B-14, a temple within the central acropolis, were likewise embellished with monolithic slabs. The Naranjo panels are made of local, friable limestone (i.e., porous micrite; see Villasenor and Helmke 2007: 140) and in their measurements more closely resemble their Pasion counterparts than the heavier and thicker exam­ples from the Roaring Creek Works. The Naranjo connection provides a pivotal link between the Pasion and the Tipan polity. For one, the histori­cal connection between Dos Pitas and Naranjo is well-known, since the glyphic texts of Naranjo laud the arrival of Lady Six Sky in A.O. 682, daughter of Bajlaj Chan K'awiil, king of Dos Pi­las (Grube 2004:201-202; Grube and Martin 2004: 42-43; Helmke and Kettunen 2011 :20-30; Martin and Grube 2000:74; Schele and Freidel 1990: 183-186). With her "arrival" event, we see the temples of Naranjo rededicated and the local dynastic line revitalized, resulting in the birth of the heir and successor, in A.O. 688. The incum­bent, K'ahk' Tiliiw Chan Chaahk (A.O. 693-728), was to have a strong impact on eastern Peten and parts of adjoining Belize, and his monuments record an initial series of warfare campaigns on neighboring sites between A.O. 693 and 714, fol­lowed by diplomatic alliances with client states, including Ucanal, Yootz, and Buenavista de! Cayo (see Boot 1999; Houston et al. 1992; Reents­Budet 1994:290-311; Tascheck and Ball 1992). Against this historical backdrop, Lady Six Sky may have brought with her to Naranjo, from her native Pasion, the tradition of monolithic stair­side panels, which could have disseminated from there to client states in west-central Belize, espe­cially given that there is evidence that several Belizean sites were under the sway of Naranjo during much of the Late Classic (Helmke and Awe 2008:79-84). We hope that additional exca­vations at Tipan, Naranjo, and other sites will

help to clarify whether the dates of these panels align with the historical events outlined above, or whether another explanation must be sought. If this model can be substantiated, the presence of these panels at Tipan may provide tacit evidence for relations with Naranjo during the Late Classic period. 
Context of Discovery of the Ceramic Texts 

Tipan's ceramic texts were discovered within a small cave, designated TCU s.08. The karstic hills surrounding Tipan are dotted with caves, many of which are of archaeological importance, including Actun Kabul, Je'reftheel, Midnight Terror, and at least ten other cave sites (Brady 2009; Helmke and Wrobel 2012; Morton 2010). TCU s.08 lies in Plaza C, within the acropolis complex, and is one of nine sinkholes discovered within Tipan's epi­center (Figure 3).As elsewhere at Tipan, the sink­hole's entrance was covered during construction of the plaza, but was later exposed by a tree-fall. The irregular entrance measures approximately 
3.0 min diameter and continued to a depth of ca. 
2.5 mat the time of its discovery. This cave ex­hibited a massive ceramic deposit that partly choked the chamber, a feature that warranted in­vestigation to recover temporally diagnostic ma­terials and assist in dating Tipan's occupation. 
Excavations in TCU s.08 in 2010 revealed three stratigraphic units. The first (Lot 3) was com­posed of the sinkhole's clayey and sterile alluvial floor (Figure 6). The second level (Lot 2) repre­sents a stratum of dry-laid rubble interspersed with artifacts. Several larger limestone blocks pre­sent in Lot 2 may have been introduced during in­filling of the cave in tandem with construction of Plaza C. Clearing Lot 2 revealed that most of the cave's stalactites had been deliberately broken and removed from the site in antiquity (see Brady et al. 1997, 2005) .3 The uppermost stratum (Lot 1) consists of the ceramic deposit, which, given its profile, reflects materials cast through the en­trance. Minor smoke clouding of formations be­neath the entrance and the paucity of sherds with carbonized surfaces suggest that fire was intro­duced sparingly, probably reflecting use of torches. 
Although analyses of this deposit are on-going, salient horizon markers for the respective strata have been identified, and a 14C sample recovered from Lot 2 produced a calibrated date of 1810-1560 years B.P. (cal A.D. 140-390) [2 cr ­Beta Analytic 284075 -wood charcoal]. As a whole, the artifacts from Lots 1 and 2 consist al­most entirely of ceramics, dominated by un­slipped jars, with a few bowls, dishes, vases, and other specialized forms such as censers, shoe pots, and drums. Interestingly, the ceramics ap­pear to have been introduced, not as whole ves­sels, but as partial vessels and sherds. Only a small number of non-ceramic artifacts were pre­sent in the deposit (particularly in Lot 2), includ­ing two prismatic obsidian blades, slate frag­ments, flakes of chert and quartzite, several

fragmentary groundstone manos and metates, freshwaterjute (Pachychilus sp.), apple snail (Po­macea sp.), olive shells (Olivella sp.), and isolated human long bone fragments. 
Due to the prevalence of Late-to-Terminal Classic ceramics visible on the deposit's surface, it was initially surmised that the entire assem­blage dated to this period. However, excavations and ceramic analyses indicate that the ceramics were deposited over a more extended period of time. Protracted use of the feature is suggested, for example, by an intact, miniature Cocay Ap­pliquect: Cocay Variety (brown ware) ollita found at the stratigraphic interface between the sterile floor and the overlying rubble (at the juncture be­tween Lots 2 and 3) that can be assigned to the Proto-Classic to Early Classic transition (see Reents 1980: 168, 1982:61, 62). That caves tend to contain some of the earliest materials attesting to human presence in a given area has been re­peatedly noted across Mesoamerica (Brady 1997). The earliest materials discovered within TCU s.08 are therefore particularly significant because they potentially index the earliest settle­ment at Tipan, especially given that deposits of equal or greater time depth have yet to be recov­ered from deeply buried strata beneath the mon­umental core. Whereas the majority of materials from TCU s.08 can be dated to the Late-to-Ter­minal Classic (A.D. 650-950) (Spanish Lookout: Roaring Creek Red, Xunantunich Black-on-or­ange, Benque Viejo Polychrome, Belize Red, and Cayo Unslipped), limited numbers of sherds date to the Proto-Classic (A.D. 0-250) (Floral Park: possible examples of Monkey Falls Striated and Negroman Punctated-incised), spanning the Early Classic (A.D. 250-550) (Hermitage: Mi­nanha Red), and Middle Classic (A.D. 550-650) (Tiger Run: Macal Orange-red, Molino Black, Uacho Black-on-orange, and a number of buff and cream polychromes) (Gifford 1976). With some exceptions, the general pattern is that the older materials are from Lot 2, whereas the later ceramics constitute Lot 1. This suggests that the deposit accumulated over an extended period of time, rather than in a few temporally restricted acts. What is significant here is that all glyphic sherds were recovered from the later Lot 1. As a result, the deposit recovered from TCU s.08 dis­tinguishes this cave from other subterranean sites in the area, as does its association with Tipan's palatial acropolis. In this regard, TCU s.08 is comparable to other caves in the Maya area that are associated with palatial structures. Key ex­amples include the cave of the Murcielago palace at Dos Pilas (Brady 1997:605-608; Demarest et al. 2003) and the Cueva de los Quetzales (Brady and Rodas 1995), two sites of the Pasion area. Context and associated architecture aside, the most comparable assemblages are those discov­ered within two caves in the nearby Roaring Creek Valley, namely the Laberinto de las Taran­tulas and the entrance chambers of Actun Tu­nichil Mucnal (Awe et al. 2005; Helmke 2009: 246-260, 4 24--434). The similarity of these assemblages to the one at Tipan suggests that we are looking at the material remains of similar ritual practices. They also seem to reflect the so­cial status and origin of the users of these caves. 
Epigraphic Analyses of the Ceramic Texts 
The ceramics recovered from TCU s.08 that are decorated with glyphs and glyphic elements set this context apart from others at the site in terms of quantity and quality of materials. These deco­rated ceramics can be subdivided into two broad groupings: those dating to the Middle Classic (Figure 7 a-b) and those of the Late-to-Terminal Classic (Figure 7c-d) (Gifford 1976; Helmke and Reents-Budet 2008). This division between rela­tively early and late assemblages is typical of western Belize, with few texts dating to the in­tervening Late Classic, a time during which sites in the area fell under the sway of either Naranjo or Caracol (Helmke and Awe 2008:78-86). This patterning has interesting implications in terms of the ability of royal dynasties to produce and con­sume written texts, and in terms of the sumptuary laws that undoubtedly conditioned the execution of glyphic materials. At Tipan, most of the late materials are represented by pseudoglyphs, in which glyphic elements only approximate the ap­pearance of writing. Thus, one set of sherds pre­sents an abbreviated and repeated dedicatory verb (Figure 7c), another the highly abstracted and repetitive title keleem ("youth") (Figure 7d), or the mostly illegible caption naming a kneeling captive on a Terminal Classic Molded-carved sherd (see Helmke et al. 1998:116-117, Figure 8s).
