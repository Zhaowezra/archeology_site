The role of seed crops in the Maya diet is well understood. The role of root crops in the ancient Maya diet has been con­troversial, with some scholars suggesting they were staples, and others arguing they were not cultivated at all. Research in the /990sfound occasional manioc plants in kitchen gardens within the Classic period Ceren village, leading to the inter­pretation that manioc did contribute to the diet, but was not a staple . Recent research outside the village encountered sophis­ticated raised-bed monocropping of manioc over an extensive area. This area was harvested essentially all at once, about a week prior to the eruption. An estimated ten tons of tubers were harvested. The various uses of manioc include consumption as food, exchange with other settlements.fermentation, drying and storage as a powder, and as an adhesive. It is possible that many or all these alternatives were being followed. At Ceren manioc was a staple, not just an occasional adjunct to 
the diet. Because Ceren is toward the wet end of the ideal range for manioc cultivation, other areas of the Neotropics that receive less than I ,700 mm of precipitation may be more suitable for manioc cultivation than Ceren. 
Es probable que en la zona maya el cultivo intensivo de ma{z y su consumo se remonten al periodo Preclasico Media. No obs­tante, su importancia en la dieta maya esta bien determinada desde el perfodo Clasico hasta hoy. En oposicion, la importan­cia def cultivo de rafce.1· en la dieta de los antiguos mayas ha sido potemica. Dada la escasez de evidencia directa de su cultivo, proceso, y consumo, muchos arqueologos han expresado incertidumbre sabre su papel en la dieta maya. Algunos de ellos han sugerido que las ra{ces no eran cultivadas en absoluto. En el otro extrema, hay quienes sugieren que su cultivo fue un com­ponente dominante de la dieta. En el caso especifico de la mandioca, hay quienes piensan que fue introducida al area maya desde el Caribe por los espaiioles. Durante nuestras investigaciones arqueologicas en el sitio de Ceren, en El Salvador, hemos contado con la ventaja def excepcional estado de preservacion de las elementos enterrados par la ceniza de la erupcion def volcan Loma Caldera, ocurrida cerca de! aiio 630 d.C. En nuestras primeras ex.cavaciones encontramos algunas pocas plan­tas de mandioca en los huertos de las casas del pueblo, lo que nos llevo a interpretar que sus tuberculos se cosechaban indi­vidualmente para ser incorporados en la dieta de forma ocasional. En esta etapa nuestra comprension de la mandioca era escasa y pensamos que dicho tuberculo no era una parte importante de la die ta, y que solo contribufa con unas cuantas calo­r{as. En nuestras investir<aciones mas recientes, realizadas unos 200 m al sur del asentamiento arqueologico, encontramos un sofisticado monocultivo de mandioca sobre un area extensa, practicado sobre un sistema de amplios camellones. En contraste con el estilo de cosechar en los huertos caseros dentro del pueblo, en esta area de monocultivo, la produccion comp/eta de mandioca se cosecho en un solo evento, una semana antes de la erupcion def volcan Loma Caldera. Estimamos que se obtu­vieron hasta diez toneladas de tuberculos con el procedimiento de arrancar la planta completa,jalandola par la base del tallo. Con esta tecnica la mayor parte de los tuberculos de cada planta habr{an sido recogidos de un solo tiron, aunque algunas ramificaciones se habr{an roto durante el proceso y permanecido enterradas en los camel/ones. Estos tuberculos desprendi­dos se descompusieron en el campo, dejando impresos suforma y volumen en huecos quefueron preservados por el deposito de ceniza vo/canica . Cuando encontramos dichas oquedades, las llenamos con yeso dental par lo que se conservaran perpe­tuamente. Un tuberculo de mandioca se descompone en pocos dfas despues de su cosecha. Par ello los agricultores de Ceren

tuvieron pocas alternativas para procesar esta gran cantidad de mandioca . Es probable que una parte de la cosecha se haya consumido en la comunidad, pero un pequeiio asentamiento de entre JOO a 200 personas no habrfa podido consumir una gran cantidad de tuberculos en tan corto tiempo . Es tambien posible que cierta porci<in de la cosecha se hubiera transportado rdpi­damente a otros pueblos o a las mercados de los centros regionales cercano.\'. Dos centros ref?ionales con mercados se loca­lizan respectivamente unos 5 km al sur y al norte de Ceren . Una posibilidad mas es que los a[?ricu/tores de Ceren hayan procesado la mandioca hacia un polvo que llaman almid6n, el cual puede almacenarse por tiempo indefinido mientras se man­tenga seco. Otra cantidad de mandioca pudo habersefermentado para ser consumida como bebida alcoh<ilica durante la cere­monia de la primera cosecha def asentamiento, la cual se via interrumpida por la erupci<in vo/cdnica. Hemos identificado que una ceremonia de primicias, quizas una versicin de la ceremonia maya tradicional "Cuch'' , estaba en marcha en la Estruc­tura comunitaria JO. Con estos nuevos hallazgos, la mandioca de Ceren ya no puede considerarse unicamente como un suple­mento dietetico ocasional sino coma un cultivo primario. Ceren se localiza en una franja de alta precipitaci<in, que no es la mas ideal para el cultivo de mandioca. Esto nos hace pensar que otras areas de la zona maya, as( como otras ref?iones neo­tropicales de Mexico y Centroamerica, con precipitaciones menores a 1500 mm, hayan sido mds propicias para el cultivo de la mandioca de lo que Jue en Ceren. Para contrarrestar la a/ta precipitacicin, los antiguos cultivadores de Ceren preparaban sus camel/ones para el cultivo de mandioca con una pendiente de entre seis y JO" quefacilitaba su desaf?ue. 

he ancient, historic, and contemporary TMaya emphasize maize as their primary sta­ple, and maize is the very stuff of which they were created by the deities. Maize preserves bet­ter than some other cultigens in the archaeological record, due in part to the multiplicity of plant fos­sils that identify its presence, such as macrore­mains, phytoliths, starch grains, and pollen. Most Mayanists until the mid-twentieth century believed swidden cultivation of these seed crops was suffi­cient to feed the assumed low population densities of the ancient Maya. However, surveys initiated during the 1950s and 1960s encountered vastly greater numbers of housemounds than anticipated (Willey 1982), indicating populations larger than could be fed by swidden with seed crops. The efforts to explore what could have fed such dense populations, estimated to be in the many hundreds per square kilometer (Culbert and Rice 1990), took two routes. Many scholars searched for evidence of agricultural intensification, and found terracing, raised fields as swamp reclamation systems, and water control features. Other scholars explored food sources other than seed crops, such as Bron­son ( 1966) who proposed root crops as subsistence alternatives. Bronson's suggestion was greeted with a burst of enthusiasm, but researchers found scant direct evidence to support it. Because root crops are often planted by stem cuttings, often do not have hard parts that carbonize well, and often produce few or no diagnostic seeds, phytoliths, or pollen, they are exceptionally difficult to detect in the archaeological record. The unusual preservation of the Ceren site (Fig­ure 1), from the volcanic ash (tephra) from the Loma Caldera eruption (Sheets 2006), allowed organic materials such as thatch roofs, pole doors, cloth, stored foods, string, baskets, birds, and ani­mals to be recovered. Only a few scattered manioc (Manihot esculenta Crantz) plants were found inside the village, such as one in the kitchen gar­den of Household I (Lentz and Ramirez-Sosa 2002; Sheets and Woodward 2002). The abundance of maize surrounding each household, with only an occasional manioc plant, indicated manioc was a minor part of the diet. 
However, excavations of agriculture outside the village, some 200 m south of Ceren, encountered surprisingly intensive and sophisticated cultivation of manioc in elevated planting beds (Figure 2).And all manioc was harvested essentially all at once,just a few days before the eruption. The harvesting of many tons of tubers raises questions about how it was processed, exchanged, preserved, and con­sumed. Durable indicators of manioc processing are being investigated that could preserve at other sites in the Maya area and beyond. 
Initially we assumed because manioc tubers, roots, and the occasional stalk were so well pre­served, so too would the microscopic indicators such as starch grains and pollen be preserved. As the roots of manioc produce few phytoliths, defin­itive phytolith evidence was not expected. Starch grains and pollen were recovered in low amounts. Starch grain preservation in soils and sediments is often poor and this is probably the main reason for the absence of manioc starch at the site. Manioc produces relatively few pollen grains that seldom have been found in archaeological settings. Preser­vation of starch and pollen may also have been compromised by the high heat of the volcanic ash layers that buried them. Henry et al. (2009) exper-

imented with the durability of starch grains under boiling water conditions and found them to be greatly modified or largely destroyed. 
Ancient Maya Agriculture: 
Historical Context 

For five centuries Westerners have been describ­ing Maya food production, beginning with Bishop Diego de Landa ( 1938) describing maize in the early sixteenth century. Gage in the seventeenth century (Thompson 1958) and Stevens and Cather­wood (1841) in the nineteenth century described how the Maya fed dispersed populations by maize­based milpa cultivation. Morley ( 1946) conferred academic acceptance onto the maize-milpa-swid­den model by arguing that there had been no changes in agriculture over three millennia, and claiming it was the only form of agriculture possi­ble in the Maya tropics because of uniformly poor soils. 
The challenge to this dominant interpretation came not from direct agricultural discoveries, but indirectly from paleodemography. Researchers at Barton Ramie in the 1950s and Tikal during the 1960s found vastly greater housemound densities, and by inference population densities, than expected (Willey 1982:4). Culbert and Rice (1990) note estimates of many hundreds of people per square kilometer at many Classic period sites

derived from those surveys. Black (1 983:82) esti­Maya, and was in part responsible for a burst in mated average population densities in the Zapoti­enthusiasm for these cultigens. He documented tan basin zone at about 300 people per square manioc cultivation among seven out of 10 ethno­kilometer in the Classic period. By the 1960s it was graphically recorded Maya groups. For instance, clear that swidden was insufficient to feed such the Chorti, the geographically closest Maya group populations, and archaeologists sought alternatives. to El Salvador today, cultivated manioc in fields

for manioc, "tz 'iXn," was found in all major branches of Maya languages, indicating wide­spread utilization, and perhaps significant time depth. Flannery ( l 982:xix) noted the surge of inter­est in manioc among Mesoamericanists after Bron­son's publication, but criticized scholars who "believed on faith [in precolumbian manioc culti­vation] because there is no archaeological evidence to support it." Flannery did mention two ancient manioc seeds discovered in Tamaulipas and Chia­pas, but noted that both may be wild. The evidence for Classic period Maya cultivation of manioc was so weak that Marcus ( 1982:252) suggested out­siders may have introduced it during the Postclas­sic period, or even that the Spanish may have introduced it into the area from the Caribbean dur­ing colonial times. 
In the most extensive compendium of the ancient Maya, Sharer (2006:637-65 1) describes the current understanding of subsistence as a mix­ture of extensive and intensive techniques focus­ing on maize, beans, and squash. He notes that the Classic period population increase required more intensive techniques, including kitchen gardens, terracing, raised fields, and irrigation. He also favored the multi-species mosaic model of inter­cropping, mimicking the species diversity of the rainforest. 
Fedick ( 1996) provides a detailed understand­ing of ancient Maya agriculture in his felicitously titled book The Managed Mosaic. The 28 authors provide many facts and cases consistent with Sharer's overview, and they document environ­mental heterogeneity in ways not imagined in pre­vious decades. Many chapters present large-scale agricultural intensification features such as terrac­ing, raised fields, canals, and reservoirs, because they preserve better in tropical climates than do smaller features. And, not surprisingly, the domes­ticated plant species that have the greatest chances of being recognized in the archaeological record are featured, especially maize. A rough indicator of the predominance of maize is in the number of references to it in the text. The index provides 73 page references for maize, but only two for man­ioc. Significantly, both of the manioc references are by Cathy Crane (1996:271), stating how little evi­dence of cultivation of any root crop has been found among the Maya, and concluding "the role of root crops in the Maya diet is unknown." 
The best evidence of manioc in the Maya low­lands and environs has come from microscopic examination of soils and sediments during the past two decades. Pohl et al. (1 996) found Manihot pollen in swamp cores from northern Belize, dat­ing to about 3400 B .C. and Manihot pollen was dis­covered more than a millennium earlier in Tabasco (Pope et al. 200 1). It is important to note here that identification of these grains cannot be made below the level of genus, therefore strictly speaking leav­ing the issue of wild or domesticated unresolved. Because native wildManihotoccurs in Mesoamer­ica, the discovery of Manihot pollen should not automatically be interpreted as the domesticated crop. The context of the grains in ancient field set­tings and near habitation locales suggests they are of domesticated manioc. Manioc starch grains from central and western Panama date to ca. 4400-5600 
B.C. (Dickau et al. 2007; Piperno et al. 2000). An earlier occurrence in Panama than in Mesoamer­ica is expected because the plant probably was domesticated in South America (Olsen 2002; Olsen and Schaal l 999). DeBoer ( 1975) and Perry (2005) provide information on manioc in archaeological sites in South America. Miksieck (1991:80) iden­tified some carbonized organic materials at Cuello as fragments of manioc stems, but he did not know if they were wild or domesticated. Hather and Ham­mond (1994) report finding manioc soft tissue in three of six samples from Cuello. Jones identified Manihot pollen from a sediment core taken from Cobweb Swamp, but it is not well dated (Crane 1996). Evans (2008:133) summarizes much research that has found a paucity of manos and metates in lowland tropical Mesoamerica in the Early Formative, interpreted as likely indicating that maize was not a staple crop in that period. It is possible that manioc was a staple then, and it is also possible that it remained a staple in some areas, but has yet to be detected as such, except at Ceren. Maize was, of course, a staple in all subsequent periods. Intriguingly, Wilken (1971 :44 2) states that Rafael Girard ( 1952: 104-105) claimed one of the most ancient recorded Maya myths includes an agrarian deity represented by a root crop, not by a seed crop. 
One manioc plant was found in the Household 1 kitchen garden at Ceren (Sheets and Woodward 2002), and a few isolated ones were found else­where (Lentz et al. 1996; Lentz and Ramirez-Sosa

2002), leading us to think that manioc provided lit­tle to the diet. That finding was consistent with general expectations that manioc was cultivated as isolated plants, only in gardens, and not as a sta­ple-like maize in formal rows and in extensive sin­gle-species plots. 
Agriculture within the Village: Kitchen 
Gardens and High Performance Milpas 

The kitchen garden of Household I held a variety of species, all planted on six small ridges oriented 30° south of east, in a 5-x-6 m area between the kitchen and the storehouse (Sheets 2006:58). One manioc stake had been planted in the northwest cor­ner of the garden, and had grown two stalks. Pre­sumably the tubers would have been harvested individually for immediate processing and con­sumption within the household, allowing the plant to continue growing and to replace that tuber. Based on the rarity of manioc inside the village, we con­cluded that it was a minor component of the diet. The 2009 research south of the village changed that dramatically. The rest of the northernmost kitchen garden row was occupied by Xanthosoma violacium Schott, locally called malanga, a root crop. Each malanga plant has a short stem with long vaginate petioles attached to a very broad saggi­tate leaf blade. Below ground the stems end in car­bohydrate-rich tubers. The other five rows alternated between Xanthosoma and a small plant identified as cebadilla (Schoenocaulon officianale [Schlecht. & Cham.] Gray ex Benth.) (Sheets 2006:59). Seeds of the plant contain veratridine and other alkaloids that have violent emetic-cathar­tic properties and can be used as a medicinal plant when used sparingly (Williams 1981). Prior to being found at Ceren, malanga had not been found growing at other Mesoamerican sites. (Lentz and Ramirez-Sosa 2002), although it was suggested as a possible Maya crop (Bronson 1966). It apparently provided significant calories for the villagers. 
Specialty crops were grown in the garden of Household 4 (Lentz and Ramirez-Sosa 2002; Sheets and Woodward 2002). Those included arboriculture with guava (Psidium gua1ava L.) and cacao (Theobroma cacao L.), a large chile plant (Capsicum annum L.), with nance (Byrsonima crassifolia [L.] H.B.K.) not far away, and an esti­mated 70 agave (Agave sp.) plants used for fiber. 
Surrounding each household within the village was an extensive zone of milpa. Maize ridges are oriented the same way as the kitchen garden ridges, following the dominant architectural orientation of household and public buildings in the village. The maize ridges are small, at about I 0 cm high and spaced 80 cm apart, and have 4-5 seeds planted in each digging stick hole, spaced about 70 cm along each ridgetop. In six of the eight places where milpa has been found, the com had matured and the stalk was doubled over to dry the ear in the field. That the Loma Caldera eruption caught maize agricul­ture at the drying-in-the-field stage indicates it struck in the middle of the rainy season, probably in August. In one other location a second planting had been done, and in another location the field was in fallow. The mature maize cobs were preserved sufficiently well to allow estimates of productivity per unit area. Sheets and Woodward (2002: 186) cal­culated over 5 ,000 kg of maize per hectare, a very high figure indeed. In spite of that high productiv­ity, they calculated that in most years the mi/pas surrounding each household were insufficient to supply sufficient food to feed a family. Presumably the additional needed food production came from fields outside the village, and we proposed the vil­lagers used a three-part agricultural strategy of kitchen gardens, infield milpas, and outfields. 
Agriculture South of the Cereo Village 
The origins of the 2009 research were two exploratory test pits (Figure 2) excavated in 2007 about 200 m south of the Ceren site (Sheets et al. 2007; Sheets et al. 20 1 1). Those two pits, each 2 x 3 m, encountered very large planting beds, 7 to 10 times larger in volume than the maize ridges found inside the village. The beds were made of the juve­nile soil developed on the tephra from the Ilopango TBJ eruption that may have occurred in the early fifth century (Dull et al. 2001) or more likely as late as A.D. 536 (Dull et al. 2010). Nothing was found growing above the ridges, but the stakes of manioc plants were found to have been planted just 
days before the Loma Caldera eruption. In addi­tion some manioc tubers were found that had been missed in the harvesting. Intensive manioc culti­vation was certainly unanticipated, and that dis­covery led to the proposal for research during the 2009 season.

Excavations. With the permission of individual landowners in the area of the 2007 testpits, exca­vations began in January 2009 to explore agricul­ture outside the village. A total of 22 3-x-3-m pits was excavated through about three meters of the Loma Caldera volcanic ash that had buried the landscape in about A.D. 630 (Sheets 2009). 
Three different kinds of Classic period land use were discovered: cleared areas, cultivated and har­vested manioc, and mi/pas where maize had matured but not yet harvested (Figure 2). The cleared areas likely were used for processing the har­vested manioc, and probably for maize, and included some constructed platform areas on both sides of the fields. A maize field was found that equaled the care in cultivation and in productivity of maize grown within the village. An extensive area where manioc had been cultivated and harvested, with some areas where it had been replanted, was also discovered. These three land use zones are described and interpreted in the three sections that follow. The zones are separated by approximately parallel lines that are oriented 30° east of magnetic north (all directions in this article are magnetic as of 2009). In addition a large rectangular adobe block was found in Operation P that also oriented 30° east of north on one side, and 30° south of east on another side. It may have been a property intersection marker. If these orientations emanate from the vil­lage they could indicate highly structured village 
control over land use outside the village. 
Cleared Areas. Two areas (Figure 2) were dis­covered that were kept clear of vegetation on each side of the intensive manioc cultivation area, and where platforms were constructed (Maloof 2009). In striking contrast to the high-density manioc agri­culture adjacent to it, Ceren residents cleared a size­able area of vegetation and built a platform to the west of the western land use 1ine (Figure 3). Another cleared area with a platform was found to the east of the fields, at Operation P (Figure 4). Why would people farm manioc so intensively below that land use line, and maintain such a large cleared area next to it? Harvesting manioc a tuber at a time for house­hold consumption from a kitchen garden (Sheets 2006) does not require a significant processing area. However, here people harvested an entire field by pulling up the stalks with most of the tubers attached, and that requires a large processing area. The activities would at least involve separating tubers from stalks, and saving stalks for replant­ing, and it apparently also involved cutting the cor­tex off of the tubers, and possibly cutting them into small segments for sun-drying. 
Nine excavations west of the manioc cultivation zone encountered an extensive cleared area (Ops A, B, C, D, J, H, O, M, and W, Figure 2). The area is estimated to be at least 30 by 50 m. The Classic period surfaces were kept quite clear of vegetation, with only an occasional volunteer cul ti gen or weed growing (Maloof 2009). Three excavations (Ops D, H, and J) encountered the juncture of the man­ioc beds and the cleared area, and in all three cases the cleared area had been leveled by a cut-and-fill procedure. One notable exception to the effort to keep the harvest processing area clear of vegeta­tion was encountered in Op D, where a tree had been growing years before the eruption. The tree was cut down about a year before the eruption, but the roots continued to live and sprouted three saplings that were allowed to grow. The sapling diameters were ca. 15 cm, so they grew into small trees that would have provided some shade for a few square meters of platform. 
Four of the nine excavations in the cleared area contained evidence of cultivation at some time prior to the erupltion (Ops A, C, 0, and W) (Maloof 2009). Faint remnants of agricultural ridges remained, well trampled by activities in the months or more likelly years after they had been abandoned, before the emption. Although the smoothed ridges were barely perceptible, their spacing indicated that three of them had been planted in manioc (Ops A, C, and W). The very close spacing in Op 0 was tighter than even maize ridge spacing, and the prior cultigen or cultigens are unknown, but could have been small vegetables. 

Ops B and M also encountered cleared sur­faces, and those surfaces were so flattened that no vestiges of prior cultivation ridges could be detected. That flattening could have been deliber­ate, or inadvertent by considerable foot traffic over a long period of time. In the upper (western) end of Op M the remnants of a possible footpath lead­ing toward the village core were identified (Mal­oof 2009). The foot path followed a trajectory of roughly 15° east of north toward the archaeologi­cal site. The path appeared to continue in the other direction, to the southwest. Thus, the footpath could have provided Ceren villagers access to their

fields and harvest processing areas. Also, residents of the modern village of Joya de Ceren have infonned us of encountering evidence of some scattered ancient buildings farther south and west of our 2009 excavations, presenting the possibil­ity that the path connected the village with some field houses or agrarian households. 
Operation P was excavated on the other side of the intensive manioc fields, downhill to the east (Figure 4). It encountered another cleared area largely devoid of vegetation just above the drop­off down to the river (Maloof 2009). It was exca­vated there to explore the eastward extent of the manioc fields, and the excavation was successful as formal fields did not extend into it. It probably is close to the eastern end of manioc cultivation, as one volunteer manioc stalk was found growing there, along with two volunteer maize plants. Also a carefully constructed flat platfonn was encoun­tered, made of TBJ tephra brought in and leveled out, averaging 6 cm in thickness in the southern half of the excavation. It was likely for manioc tuber processing. Below the TBJ tephra platfonn as well as beyond it to the north was a shallow sheet midden composed of sherds, lithics, and plant macrofossils. Use wear on an obsidian prismatic blade from the midden, discussed below, suggests that decortication was being done promptly after harvesting at this location. 
A sizeable adobe block was constructed from the clay-laden soil below the TBJ tephra and placed on top of that ash layer. It measured 65 x 45 cm, and averaged 25 cm thick. The edges were 30° east of north and 30° south of east, corresponding to the dominant architectural and agricultural azimuths, suggesting it probably was built at a property inter­section and functioned as a boundary marker. 
Maize Field. Prior to the 2009 field season at Ceren, maize was believed to be the only staple crop grown there. Maize had been previously identified both in kitchen gardens and in the infield milpas located adjacent to the village structures (Sheets 2002). During the 2009 excavations maize was again documented atCeren.Amaize field was iden­tified to the east of the manioc beds discovered in 2007 (Figure 2). The eruption preserved much of

the stalks and some of the ears,just like those found in the site center (Sheets 2002; Tetlow and Hood 2009). Stalks were bent over for drying in the field. This maize field borders the manioc fields to the west and south and extends an unknown distance to the north and east (Tetlow and Hood 2009). 
The I 0-cm high maize ridges of this area were spaced approximately 70 cm from each other, with plant clusters on each ridge spaced almost a meter apart (Tetlow and Hood 2009). The size and spac­ing of these maize plants is similar to maize plant­ings within the site center (Sheets 2002). It appears a similar high productivity of maize milpa extends to this region. What is unusual is ridge orientation. All previously excavated maize field ridges at Ceren were oriented perpendicular to ground slope, presumably to maximize infiltration and retard ero­sion (Sheets 2002). In contrast, the maize field south of the village is located downslope from the manioc fields. Those manioc beds and walkways were oriented to maximize drainage, and that excess water ran into the maize field, where drainage continued to be maximized. 
Manioc Fields. The discovery of harvested man­ioc fields initially in 2007 (Figures 5 and 6) and in detail in 2009 has provided an unusually clear pic­ture of intensive manioc production by Classic Period Maya villagers. The two initial test pits exca­vated in 2007 were positioned along the tie-lines between two ground-penetrating radar grids (Dixon 2007). No plants, including weeds, were found on the surface of the planting beds, indicating the care­ful maintenance of the area. Excavation of the man­ioc beds discovered five manioc tubers and seven cut manioc stalks. The stalks, called stakes, are sec­tions of the manioc trunk that had been planted hor­izontally for the next cycle of plant growth (Dixon 2007; Sheets et al. 2007). 
The 2009 field season was organized around the manioc beds discovered in 2007 with the aim of placing these beds in a wider context by inves­tigating the surrounding area (Figure 2). This con­tinued research yielded a previously unprecedented glimpse into the broader organization, the variation in cultivation, and importance of manioc at Ceren and potentially in other areas. The 2009 field sea-

son encountered Ceren manioc beds in a total of 12 operations and provided increased understand­ing of Maya manioc production 
Three separate fields were identified within the manioc cultivation zone. Manioc Field 1 includes the original beds discovered in 2007 and is the most extensive single plot found during our excavations thus far. The manioc beds excavated within this area had very uniform sizes, shapes, and styles of con­struction, and all had been harvested just prior to the Loma Caldera eruption, and some had been replanted (Dixon 2007, 2009; Sheets 2009). The beds in this plot average 20 cm in height, with almost vertical sides, and flat tops about 50 cm in width. Their cross-sections are quite angular. All beds were sloping 6-10° degrees, presumably to drain excess water. Precipitation at Ceren is 1,700 ± 300 mm, toward the moister end of manioc's ideal range of I ,000-2,000 mm. It can be produc­tive even down to 500 mm. Most of the Maya area is suitable for manioc cultivation, and much of it more suitable than at Ceren. 
Manioc Field 1 extends 15 m between its west­ern and eastern boundaries and an unknown dis­tance to the north and the south. A land-use line establishes the western boundary of Manioc Field 
I. A leveled platform was the first feature imme­diately to the west of the land-use line, presumably for processing manioc. The land-use line is ori­ented approximately 30° east of north. 
The eastern boundary of Manioc Field 1 is marked by another land-use line that is also aligned about 30° east of north . The northern portion of this use-line creates the boundary between the manioc production of Manioc Field 1 in the west and maize production in the east (Figure 7). The northern maize ridges of the eastern field closely resemble maize ridges in the Ceren village, as their heights average 10 cm, and ridgetop-to-ridgetop spacings average approximately 70 cm. But

towards the southern regions the maize ridges gradually increase in ridgetop-to-ridgetop spac­ing between beds that approach pacing of man­ioc fields, at I 10 cm. Maize plants were growing throughout this field at the time of the Loma Caldera eruption, so there is no doubt all these ridges were dedicated to maize production. How­ever, it is possible that a portion of this field was used earlier for manioc cultivation and that this 
region is a transition between the maize field to the north and Manioc Field 2 to the south. Alter­natively, it is possible that this southern portion of the maize field received more runoff from the cleared area and manioc field to the west, and thus the swales of the maize field needed to intersect the swales (walkways) of the manioc field to carry excess water toward the river. 
The southern portion of this western land-use line forms the boundary between Manioc Fields 1 and 2 (Figure 8). At this boundary the manioc beds of Manioc Field 1 become the furrows of Manioc Field 2,and the furrows become the beds. The stag­gered orientation of the manioc beds creates a clear boundary between the two fields. Water poured from one swale to the staggered one downhill over a miniature waterfall (Figure 9). These fields have manioc beds with uniform construction in shape, style, and size to each other (Figure IO) (Dixon 2009), but because they are separated by a clear 
land-use line, they presumably are of different cul­tivators. The eastern and southern boundaries of Manioc Field 2 have yet to be found. 
The western boundary of Manioc Field 3 pre­sumably is the continuing land-use line, and the northern boundary is where it abuts Field 2, but nei­ther has been confirmed. Manioc Field 3 was so designated not by discovering land-use lines or field boundaries, but rather by the striking stylis­tic differences in manioc bed construction. The beds of Manioc Fields 1 and 2 were broad and flat­topped with almost vertical walls, while the beds of Manioc Field 3 were shaped like sine waves in cross-section. They are much higher, averaging 40 cm, and more widely spaced from ridgetop-to­ridgetop at 130 cm. Given their very different style of construction, these manioc ridges have been des­ignated as a separate manioc field. While it is pos­sible the larger and differently shaped manioc bed

construction of this plot might serve to prevent soil erosion, there are no ground slope differences between this field and the other areas of manioc production (Dixon 2009). There are no known advantages or disadvantages of these different styles of construction that we could discover. Thus, it seems probable the field differences are idio­syncratic in nature. 
The two land-use lines and the large adobe block in Op P are oriented at about 30° east of north, which is close to the orientation of most architec­ture and agricultural field ridges inside the Ceren village (Sheets 2002, 2006). It is possible that they emanate from the village, and possibly even from Structure 3, interpreted as the political center of the village where the elders sat on benches of author­ity in the front room. However, it is also possible that the land-use lines emanate from a settlement to the south, possibly even San Andres, the largest site in the valley, some 5 km away. It is also pos­sible that they were simply local boundaries set up by mutual agreement among these agriculturalists, and do not relate to any settlement. This last alter­native is considered the least likely. 
Artifacts. Excavations within the Ceren village have encountered hundreds of artifacts made of pot­tery, obsidian, dacite, jade, bone, antler, and other materials, most in positions of storage, but some in loci of use (Sheets 2002, 2006). Virtually all were complete; in fact, it is unusual to find a sherd in or around a building what was not a part of a whole vessel. The opposite holds in the agricultural area investigated in 2009, where only broken/discarded artifacts were encountered. A total of 200 sherds were encountered in all operations, with types and frequencies consistent with those found within the village (Beaudry-Corbett 2002). More than half of the sherds (i.e., 111) came from a small sheet mid­den encountered in Operation P, at the southeast cor­ner of the research area. In addition to sherds, miscellaneous fired clay artifacts were recovered, including olla handle fragments, adornos, a sherd spindle whorl, and a whistle fragment. 
Only 12 obsidian artifacts were found, all from Operation P, and all are prismatic blade fragments (Sheets 2009: 124). One blade had an unusual usewear in the form of many individual striations parallel to the edge. Along concavities of the edge

the individual striations are clear. But along con­vexities where the blade would make more contact with the worked material, there are so many stria­tions that the surface appears frosted. Only two examples of this kind of usewear in Mesoamerica or the Intermediate Area have been published, to the best of our knowledge. Hutson et al. (2007:461) report an obsidian prismatic blade from Chunchucmil with striations parallel to the edge, which they suggest could have been used in cutting coarse fibers. We suggest it might have been used in manioc de-cortication. Given manioc's resistance to drought, it might have been a more important domesticate at Chunchucmil than at Ceren. A few striations similar to those on the Chunchukmil and Ceren blades developed during replication experi­mentation by Suzanne Lewenstein (1987: 126, Fig­ure 85).An obsidian edge received a few striations parallel to the edge when used to slice the cortex off of manioc tubers at Cerros. It is possible that more extensive use could develop the high degree of striations seen on the Operation Pb lade. This kind of usewear may be a durable indicator of root crop processing, and possibly specific to manioc. Stria­tions from removing the cortex of malanga (Xan­thosoma) would be perpendicular to the edge. Usewear highly similar to this has also been found on a few prismatic blades from Chalchuapa. Exper­imentation currently underway has replicated this usewear on newly-manufactured obsidian cutting edges, while cutting manioc tuber cortex coated with a thin layer of volcanic ash from the TBJ erup­tion ofllopango volcano. 
Two non-obsidian chipped stone artifacts were found, a dacite scraper, along with a basalt flake that may have been debitage from early in the manu­facture of another scraper (Sheets 2009: 124). The dacite scraper had been extensively used, with con­siderable abrasive wear from motion perpendicular to the working edge. Traditional Amazonian natives remove manioc's cortex by scraping or by cutting (Dufour 1994). An attempt to resharpen the scraper was unsuccessful and it was discarded. It was found in the midden of Operation P, adjacent to a prepared platform that may have been constructed for man­ioc processing following harvesting.

a day or two, or processed into another form rapidly. They deteriorate even faster once the cor­tex is removed. There are four possibilities regard­ing processing and use: direct consumption, drying and storing in powdered form, as an adhesive, and fermentation. The drying and storage option begins by decortication, cutting into small segments to sun-dry them and then grinding into a powder locally called "almidcin." Almid6n stores indefi­nitely as long as it is kept dry. An extensive area would be needed to sun-dry the estimated I 0 tons of manioc tubers harvested from this area days before the eruption (Sheets 2009). Manioc juice is an effective adhesive, and may have been the binder used to paint Structures I 0 and 12. Another possibility is that tubers were fermented in ceramic vessels, and the fact the village was holding a har­vest-oriented community ceremony and feast at Structure 10 when the eruption occurred suggests that fermented manioc beer perhaps was con­sumed. The fermentation presumably would have been done in ceramic vessels kept in the town, rather than in the field. We suggest that a large pro­portion, probably the majority, of the manioc tubers were being de-corticated, cut into segments, and sun-dried in the cleared areas, prior to being transported to the village and ground into almid6n. The large surplus of manos and metates in House­hold 1 , responsible for supporting the ceremonies in Structure 10 (Sheets 2006), may have been used for such grinding, as well as the individual mano­metate sets in other households. These alternative modes of processing and consumption are not mutually exclusive. 
Plant Macroremains. A large quantity of car­bonized plant macroremains -plant remains large enough to be seen by the unaided eye-was col­lected from the sub-TBJ sheet midden uncovered in Operation P. The plant remains from that unit were collected as they were encountered during the midden's excavation, while additional plant macroremains were recovered from soil samples taken from the midden and processed using a mod­ified Apple Creek water flotation system (Pearsall 2000: 15). These archaeological plant macrore­mains were transported back to David Lentz's Plant

Resources Laboratory at the University of Cincin­nati for further analysis.All plant macroremains ini­tially were sorted based on a broad classification separating wood charcoal, seeds, rinds, pits, roots, stems, leaves, and amorphous plant tissue with the aid of a stereomicroscope (8-50X magnification) illuminated by a fiber optic light. Wood charcoal was removed from the assemblage for this study to be examined further with scanning electron microscopy. Once sorted into these broad cate­gories, each plant macroremain was individually analyzed for morphological and anatomical fea­tures indicating the plant's taxonomic name and part, with references made to Lentz's collection of comparative plant materials from Central America. 
A total of 1,557 plant macroremains was iden­tified from the sub-TBJ midden assemblage in Operation P, including seeds, pits, roots, stems, and leaves (Table 1). The major cultigens traditionally thought to have comprised the ancient Maya diet­maize (Zea mays L.), beans (Phaseolus spp.), and squash (Cucurbita sp.)-are present in the assem­blage, although maize and beans are the most abun­dant plant remains by both count and weight. Beans,both common beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) and lima beans (Phaseolus lunatus L.), however, are by far the dominant plant macrofossil recov­ered from the midden. Although present in large numbers here and in other contexts within the Ceren village (Lentz et al. 1996; Lentz and Ramirez-Sosa 2002),beans are generally infrequent in the archae­ological record of ancient Maya sites because the process of their preparation, soaking and boiling rarely leads to carbonization and subsequent preser­vation (Hammond and Miksecik 1981 :268). The paucity of beans recovered from sites throughout the Maya area with well-studied paleoethnobotan­ical records such as Copan, Chan, and Cuello underscores the strong impacts that formation processes and differential preservation have on the taxa recovered from archaeological features like middens, and ultimately our interpretations of past human/plant relationships (Lentz 1991 :275; Lentz et al. 2012; Miksicek 1991:78). The unusual preser­vation of such large numbers of beans in the Oper­ation P midden is likely due to people depositing a 6 cm-thick TBJ tephra layer above the midden to create a flat platform, effectively sealing it off from intrusive foot traffic, animals, and other distur­bances while Ceren was occupied. The Loma 



Caldera eruption further buried the feature, elimi­nating post-occupational disturbances. 
A gourd rind (Lagenaria siceraria [Mo! .] Standl.), a plant commonly found in archaeologi­cal contexts in Mesoamerica, was also recovered from the midden. Identified in larger quantities from Household 1 and Structure 11 (a food prepa­ration area) in the village, gourd fruits are noted for their wide array of uses as containers and utensils, while their seeds are often eaten like those of related squash species (Cutler and Whitaker 1961 :483; Lentz et al. 1996:249; Lentz and Ramirez-Sosa 2002:Table 4.1). 
Several tree fruits of economic importance were also identified in the Operation P midden, includ­ing jocote or hog plum (Spondias sp.), avocado (Persea Americana Miller), and nance. The pres­ence of Spondias pits is particularly intriguing because this is the first time the tree fruit has been documented at Ceren, despite numerous examples of other well-preserved tree crops such as guava, cacao, and calabash (Crescentia alata H.B .K.) in the village. Spondias fruits are eaten raw and grow in bountiful quantities throughout Central Amer­ica (Standley and Steyermark 1949: 193-194). Given that Spondias is ubiquitous throughout the modem Central American landscape, and that the fruit pits are frequently present at sites (Copan and Cuello, for example) that lack the unusual preser­vation conditions found at Ceren (Lentz 1991 :274; Miksicek 1991 :72), it is surprising that this tree crop has remained absent from the archaeological record at Ceren until now. Possibly Spondias trees were grown far enough away from the village that the pits did not enter household spaces, or Ceren 's res­idents routinely cleaned all activity surfaces of food waste and other debris. Perhaps more likely, Spon­dias fruits simply may not have been in season when the Loma Caldera erupted, rendering it imperceptible until uncovered in the Operation P midden that contained refuse that was deposited prior to the eruption . 
The identification of tree fruits from the Oper­ation P midden-coupled with extraordinarily well-preserved, in situ tree trunks, branches, fruits, stems, and stands of fruit trees planted within household courtyards in the village proper (Lentz and Ramirez-Sosa 2002:38)-provides extensive evidence of arboriculture at Ceren. Such vivid details of arboriculture are significant because they

contextualize an emerging corpus of paleoethnob­otanical data for tree crops at other ancient Maya sites where typical preservation conditions render non-carbonized plant remains virtually invisible. Chan, an ancient Maya farming village in west-cen­tral Belize, is such a site, with a diverse set of plant macrofossils including numerous tree crops (Lentz et al. 20 12). Remains of avocado cotyledons in out­door domestic spaces and nance pits recovered from terrace beds indicate that Chan's residents likely planted orchards in household courtyards and further afield in terrace beds, an observation that mirrors the distribution of in situ tree fruits and the trees bearing them within the Cenn village, in addition to tree crops such as Spondias only doc­umented outside of household areas. Overall, the lush evidence of plant use practices at Ceren pro­vides a useful framework from which to interpret plant macrofossils and ancient landscapes through­out the Maya area. 

Although we did not find carbonized manioc remains in Operation P, we did find two manioc stems, cast in dental plaster, volunteering from the midden (Figure 5). The manioc stems could be identified because of the unusual leaf scars and nodes found on the stout main stem which can grow up to 5-6 cm in diameter. As seen in the modem sample shown in Figure 5,at each node of the man­ioc stem there is a prominent circular leaf scar sub­tended on either side by a horizontal protuberance. Even more telling, the nodes are alternate in arrangement, but are distributed on the stem in a spiral pattern. Although the circular leaf scars are not particularly well-preserved on the: plaster casts of the manioc stems, the horizontal protuberances are evident as are the spiral node arrangements, leaving little doubt that these casts represent Mani­hot esculenta . Furthermore, other potential candi­date plants for these casts can be eliminated because of their stem morphology. Maize, for example, has about the same stem diameter as manioc, but maize stems are covered with leaf sheaths above each node. The leaf sheaths have the parallel venation characteristic of monocots and these are readily observable in the numerous maize casts that have been recovered from Ceren. Also, the phyllotactic arrangement in maize is distichous, with single nodes distributed alternately on either side of the stem and not spirally arranged as in manioc. Two other New World root crops, yams (Dioscorea tri­fida L.) and sweet potatoes (lpomoea batata [L.] Lam.),grow as prostrate vines unless offered some scaffolding. Malanga, as cited above, has been identified at Ceren, but their true stems barely emerge above the ground surface and the envagi­nated leaf petioles are the parts most commonly seen in plaster casts. Achira (Canna edulis Ker.) and arrowroot (Maranta arundinacea L.) are other cultigens that might be candidates (Pipemo and Pearsall 1998) for plaster casts at Ceren, but they are both monocots and the parallel venation would be apparent, as with maize.Also, the stems of achira and arrowroot are far less robust than the cast seen in Figure 5. Finally, the manioc plants are adjacent to the ancient manioc field described above, per­haps one of the most extensive known in the ancient New World (Tetlow and Hood 2009: 14). 

Manioc is typically propagated vegetatively by planting cuttings from the plant's mature stems in the ground (Cock 1982:756) and not by seeds , eliminating a potential source of evidence for man­ioc in the archaeological record. Furthermore, manioc roots, along with macrofossils of root crops in archaeological contexts throughout the world, preserve poorly and prove difficult to identify even when preserved via carbonization, desiccation, or from waterlogged conditions (Pearsall 2000: 153). Preparation techniques for manioc discussed above -grating, grinding, and fermentation-in addition to boiling (Miksicek 1991 :80), further decrease the probability that manioc root tissue would become carbonized and preserve in archae­ological contexts. Despite this seemingly pes­simistic outlook on the chances of identifying manioc from sites in the Maya area lacking the unusual preservation conditions at Ceren, archae­ologists working in Mesoamerica should be encouraged to incorporate programs of paleoeth­nobotanical study into their research designs to systematically recover potential macroremains, as well as microremains (i.e., pollen, phytoliths, and starch grains), in an effort to broaden the pale­oethnobotanical record of a botanically as well as culturally diverse region. 
Phytoliths and Pollen. Pollen and phytolith analyses were conducted by Dr. John Jones in the Palynology Laboratory at Washington State Uni­versity. A total of 37 sediment samples were sub­mitted for analysis, all of which came from sub-Loma Caldera tephra contexts, and most of

which came from the middle-Classic horizon con­temporary with the Ceren village. A few samples came from earlier sub-Ilopango TBJ contexts and thus antedated the principal Ceren occupation. Extraction procedures followed techniques modi­fied from Pipemo (2006). 
Although disappointing, it was not unexpected that pollen was nearly completely absent from the Ceren samples. It is likely that the high heat from the Loma Caldera tephra destroyed most grains, along with other organics in the sediments and/or that pollen preservation generally was poor, as often is the case in archaeological sites where natural oxi­dizing conditions are present. A few poorly pre­served fossil grains were noted in a couple of samples; those grains may have been buried prior to the eruption and thus protected somewhat. The few grains that could be identified include Poaceae (grasses) Asteraceae (composites), Cheno-Ams (goosefoot, pigweed) and Zea mays (maize). These types are usually overrepresented in pollen records because they are durable, they are produced in abundance, and their distinctive morphologies make them readily recognizable, even when highly degraded (Bryant et al. 1994). 
Phytoliths on the other hand were abundant and well preserved in the Ceren sediments. All of the phytolith samples from Ceren are dominated by a number of typically common phytolith types from the Poaceae and various other families or groups of plants. The discussion will focus on economi­cally significant plants and cultigens. 
Several phytolith types encountered in the Ceren samples represent economically significant plants. A single spherical, scalloped Cucurbita phytolith was noted. This type is diagnostic of the fruit rinds of Cucurbita (Bozarth 1987; Pipemo 2006). The size of the phytolith, 58 microns long, overlaps those of wild Cucurbita species, precluding a defin­itive identification as a domesticated squash. Con­sidering the chronology and overall context of Ceren it is likely that the phytolith is from a domesticated species. 'Zea mays (maize) is a heavy phytolith pro­ducer, with different types of diagnostic phytoliths being produced in its leaves and cobs. Both maize leaf and cob phytoliths were recovered from every sample except 30, 31 , and 32. Maize leaf phytoliths are represented by large "cross-shaped" phytoliths and cob phytoliths by "wavy-top" rondel phytoliths (Pearsall et al. 2003; Pipemo 2006). 
Palms are all heavy phytolith producers and some different phytolith groups are recognized (Piperno 2006). The very few palm phytoliths encountered in the Ceren samples are all spherical types, which occur in many palm genera including Sabal; however, genus-level identification cannot be made. However, their rarity suggests that palms were not common in the Ceren area. Conical­shaped palm phytoliths produced by genera such as Bactris andAcrocomia were absent, suggesting that these plants were not being cultivated near the sediment collection areas. Lentz and Ramfrez-Sosa (2002:40) also noted the presence but paucity of palms at Ceren, which is unusual when compared to so many other Maya sites. 
Two samples (Lab numbers 37 and 38) repre­sent scrapings of carbonized materials on ceramic sherds. Both samples were dominated by car­bonized and partially carbonized organic mate­rials, and phytoliths were isolated from these materials with some difficulty. Both contained maize phytoliths. 
Starch Grains. Starch grain studies were carried out on a total of 28 samples, including scrapings from the surfaces of metates, insides of sherds, and general midden contexts. Starch analyses followed protocols developed by Dolores Piperno (e.g., Pipemo et al. 2000) and identifications were made by reference to Pipemo's large modem reference collections housed at the Smithsonian Institution. Starch grain content was poor in many samples studied (Table 2). Three starch grains with mor­phological and size features diagnostic of maize were isolated from one of the midden scrapings (Sample FS 42) and five other samples each had one or two starch grains with attributes consistent with those of maize. However, sample size is not large enough to make a definitive identification. (See Pipemo et al. 2000 and Holst et al. 2007 for descriptions of the maize identification technique.) In other samples where starch was present the grains could not be identified to a taxon either because the grains were damaged or because the type present is not currently represented in our modem reference collections. No starch diagnos­tic of manioc tubers was recovered. Given the apparent poor preservation of the starch remains, this is not surprising. 
Detailed phytolith studies require a separate processing technique, but some phytoliths are typ-

in flotation samples from the small Op P midden. Maize and especially beans were abundant, with squash and bottle gourd also found. Tree fruits were identified, including jocote, avocado, and nance. Many species are common outside and inside the village, but it is notable that jocote was found only outside the village in these samples. And of course the striking dis juncture is how few manioc plants were growing inside the village and how abundant it was outside.
