This article examines the significance of outlying groups in the spatial organization of Classic Maya settlements. The relative scarcity of textual records concerning outlying groups has often made it difficult for researchers to analyze in detail the political interactions between individuals associated with these groups and the royal authority. The recent discovery of a hieroglyphic stairway at the Guzman Group, an outlying group of El Palmar, Campeche, Mexico, provides an exceptional opportunity for understanding the constitutive process of spatial organization during the Late and Terminal Classic periods (ca. AD. 600-900) . Epigraphic studies of the Guzman Group stairway have identified a main individual who emphasized his genealogical ties to lakam (banner-bearer) officials and his political relationship with foreign rulers of Copan and Calakmul. The results of archaeological and epigraphic studies suggest that the Guzman Group was a locus for negotiating power and ideology among different 
social actors. 
En el presente art{culo se examina el proceso de formaci6n de las grupos arquitect6nicos apartados de las nucleos urbanos en la organizaci6n espacial de las entidades polfticas mayas durante el periodo Clasico (ca. 250-900 d.C). La escasez de estos grupos discretos con registros epigraficos que mencionen a las personajes que las habitaron ha limitado el conocimiento sabre la interacci6n polftica entre dichos actores con la autoridad real. El reciente descubrimiento de una escalinata jerofilifica en un grupo discreto designado coma Grupo Guzman, ubicado 1 ,3 km al norte del sitio arqueol6gico de El Pa/mar, ofrece una excelente oportunidad para entender el proceso constitutivo de la organizaci6n espacial de esta entidad politica maya durante el Clasico Tardio y Terminal (ca. 600-900 d.C). En las textos epigraficos de la escalinata se identijic6 un protagonista que enfatiza su vinculo geneal6gico con oficiales que poseen el titulo de lakam ( abanderado) y sus nexos poUticos con gobernantes de Copan y Calakmul. Las investigaciones arqueol6gicas y epigraficas sugieren que el Grupo Guzman era un espacio poUtico en donde las diferentes actores sociales negociaban poder e ideologia.

for understanding Maya spatial organization dur­ing the Late and Terminal Classic periods (ca. 
A.D. 600-900). Archaeological and epigraphic data suggest that the Guzman Group, an outlying group of the Classic Maya polity of El Palmar (Figure 1), was a political arena in which different social actors negotiated power and ideological re­lations. Outlying groups have been called by dif­ferent terms, including "architectural groups" (Ashmore 1991), "building clusters" (Kurjack and Garza 1981), "hinterland settlements" (Yaeger 2003), "plazuela groups" (Thompson 1931), and, more commonly, "minor centers" (Bullard 1960). The latter term could be useful because Bullard (1960:359-360) originally designated a minor center as a cluster of pyramidal temples with lower buildings arranged around plazas. Nonetheless, it is a loaded term, and a consensus has not been reached among Maya archaeologists regarding its meaning (Chase 2004; Chase and Chase 2003: 108; Conlon and Powis 2004; Iannone 2004; Iannone and Connell 2003). The present study uses the term "outlying group," a designation that implies no specific function or meaning, but in­stead designates a discrete cluster of buildings that form one or more plazas in the vicinity of the urban core. 
The scarcity of textual records concerning out­lying groups has often made it difficult for re­searchers to analyze in detail the interactions be­tween the royal authority in the urban core and those individuals who were associated with the outlying groups, as well as how these interactions contributed to the constitution of the overall po­litical landscape (Chase and Chase 2003; Smith 2003). In this sense, the discovery of a hiero­glyphic stairway at the Guzman Group of El Pal­mar provides an ideal opportunity for examining power and ideological relations between the royal authority and the occupants of outlying groups in

the spatial organization of Classic Maya settle­ment. This study assesses political interactions among different social actors who played impor­tant roles in the spatial organization of the polity of El Palmar. 
The Study of Spatial Organization in Lowland Maya Archaeology 
Understanding the spatial organization of settle­ments has been a principal concern of Maya ar­chaeology. The results from over half a century of settlement pattern research have revealed that low­land Maya centers tend to be characterized by dis­persed spatial organization, that is, an urban core surrounded by dispersed outlying groups (e.g., Ashmore 1981; Bullard 1964; Driver and Garber 2004; Kurjack 1974; Willey et al. 1965). The robust data provided by settlement pattern studies have been used to address the role of outlying groups in the overall spatial organization of centers. Above all, the degree to which cosmological ideology is represented by Classic Maya urban landscapes has been broadly discussed (e.g.,Ashmore 1989, 1991; Ashmore and Sabloff 2002; Brady and Ashmore 1999; Kowalski 1994; Schele and Freidel 1990). In examining the spatial configuration of Tikal and Copan, Ashmore (1991) suggests that Classic Maya polities tended to have quadripartite spatial arrangements, emphasizing a north-south axis. Structures placed to the north represent the celestial supernatural realm or heaven, while those to the south symbolize the underworld, or xibalbd (Ash­more 1989). To evaluate this hypothesis in the placement of outlying groups, Ashmore (1991) ex­cavated the North Group of Copan. There she re­covered the remains of sculptures-one of the 
Principal Bird Deity-as well as ritual deposits associated with symbolic representations of the celestial realm, thus corroborating the proposed correlation between north and sky. 
Ashmore and Sabloff (2002) further assert that the cosmological template of directionality and emulation of spatial designs constituted the most prominent ideational foundations of Maya royal authority. They argue that Maya site plans were laid out as microcosms for the legitimization of royal power through the spatial arrangement of outlying groups at the cardinal directions. This influential model has led other researchers to ex­amine the degree to which cosmological ideology is embedded in the layouts of other Maya sites, concluding that Classic Maya rulers promoted the symbolic representation of a cosmogram in order to reinforce their political centralization (e.g., De­marest et al. 2003; Estrada-Belli and Tourtellot 2005; Houk 1996; Houk and Zaro 201 O; Mathews and Garber 2004; Tourtellot et al. 2000). Never­theless, the scarcity of textual data in outlying groups has made it difficult for other scholars to prove the materialization of cosmograms in Maya urban planning (Smith 2003, 2005; but see Ash­more and Sabloff 2003). While the ideational model of cosmological ideology has unveiled a potentially crucial political strategy of Classic Maya dynasties, we should consider that such cos­mological representation could also have been transformed, erased, or newly created by subse­quent practices (Ashmore and Sabloff 2002; Knapp and Ashmore 1999). 
Outlying groups could have had different func­tions and trajectories. Chase and Chase (2003) have demonstrated a variety of functions embed­ded in outlying groups around the urban core of Caracol. Careful ground mapping and systematic excavations show that some of these outlying groups did not contain residential and ceremonial deposits and debris, but rather had large plaza spaces, suggesting that they served as integrative facilities (Chase and Chase 1996). Meanwhile, others were residential groups that included formal tombs and cache deposits (Chase and Chase 2003). Furthermore, their excavations show that some of those groups existed independently during earlier periods, but were integrated by a causeway into the overall political landscape of Caracol at a later date. This process of integrating outlying groups as a means of political centralization has been re­ported at other Maya sites (e.g., Cheetham 2004). 
Multiple lines of evidence suggest that the function of outlying groups could change over time. Haviland (1981) has demonstrated this through extensive excavations of an outlying group called Group 7F-l , located 1.25 km south­east of the Great Plaza at Tikal. Haviland's exca­vations revealed that the inhabitants of Group 7F­1 modified the spatial organization of the group, transforming it from an informal residential cluster into a formal plaza compound. Material remains show discontinuous activities associated with cer-

emonial deposits in a temple structure located on the east side of the plaza, a spatial arrangement known as "Plaza Plan 2" (Becker 1991). The dis­continuity of ritual deposits suggests to Haviland (1981: 116) that ceremonial activities took place intensively in Group 7F-l from ca. A.D. 593 to ca. A.D. 682, but in other periods the group served as a residence of the royal lineage. 
The combination of archaeological research with epigraphic studies has provided an explicit relationship between people who lived in outlying groups and royal authority. An elaborate residen­tial complex called Group 9N-8 at Copan is lo­cated near the Las Sepulturas causeway, about 500 m from the Main Group. Magnificent archi­tecture with numerous mosaic sculptures, prestige goods, and a hieroglyphic bench suggest to re­searchers that the inhabitants of Group 9N-8 were noble families (Webster 1989). Jackson and Stuart (2001) have deciphered the texts of two hiero­glyphic benches that recorded an intimate con­nection between ajk'uhuun officials and specific rulers of Copan (see also Zender 2004). The po­litical interactions between local nobles of sec­ondary centers and the rulers of major centers have been studied at great length in the U sumac­inta region (e.g., Chinchilla and Houston 1992; Jackson 2005). The rich data from this region in­dicate that even in the same region political tra­jectories vary among centers (Golden et al. 2008; Houston and Stuart 2001). 
Symbolic, political, and economic factors may not have been mutually exclusive, but rather are likely to have been interrelated in the process of generating Classic Maya spatial organization. Var­ious researchers have demonstrated that a di­achronic approach through careful excavations and material analyses is indispensable for our bet­ter understanding of the dynamic nature of outly­ing groups in the Maya Lowlands. 
El Palmar 
The archaeological site of El Palmar is located in southeastern Campeche, Mexico, about 30 km and 25 km from the current borders with Guatemala and Belize, respectively (Figure 1). The site was originally discovered by J. Eric S. Thompson in 1936 (Thompson l 936a, 1936b, 1994:262-266) and subsequently investigated by 
Carlos Brokmann (1996, 1997). They reported the monumentality of the urban core or Main Group and documented over 40 carved monu­ments with caches, including elaborate eccentrics (Thompson 1936a). Their results provided the ba­sis for our archaeological research at El Palmar (Tsukamoto et al. 2010). Since 2007, the first and second authors have co-directed the El Palmar Archaeological Project: Urbanization of Social Space in the Maya Lowlands. The project focuses on political interactions among different social actors in the urbanization process of the El Palmar polity during the Classic period (ca. A.D. 250­900). Our topographic mapping during four field seasons from 2007 to 2014 has covered over 100 hectares, detecting several outlying groups around the Main Group. Figure 2 shows the map of the Main Group and two outlying groups, including the Guzman Group. Excavations at the Main Group have uncovered a long construction se­quence from the Late Preclassic (ca. 300 B .C.­
A.D. 
250) to the Terminal Classic periods (ca. 

A.D. 
800-1000; Tsukamoto et al. 2012). While extensive excavations at structures have yet to be carried out, data from test pits suggest that most of the plazas of the Main Group were constructed before the eighth century. 


Guzman Group: 
An Outlying Group of the El Palmar Polity 

The Guzman Group is an outlying group located 
1.3 km north of the Main Group. Surface survey and topographic mapping between these groups have detected a causeway. This causeway was clearly visible in only four sections (A to D) of the transect in the field (Figure 2). Recent road construction activities in 2010 destroyed part of the causeway, exposing sherds dating to the Late Classic period (ca. A.D. 600-800).This evidence suggests that the causeway was built or remodeled during this period. 
The Guzman Group consists of one temple mound (Structure GZl) in the east and six low structures (Structures GZ2-GZ6 and GZ9) sur­rounding a small plaza named Plaza A (Figure 3), a spatial configuration similar to Group 7F-1 at Tikal (Haviland 1981). A hieroglyphic stairway is attached to Structure GZl, with an orientation of about 17 degrees east of true north. Unlike

Figure 4. Section of Structure GZl (section by Kenichiro Tsukamoto and Luz Evelia Campana Valezuela). 
Excavations in three structures (GZl, GZ5, and GZ6) and Plaza A show that the north half of the Guzman Group was inhabited during the Late and Terminal Classic periods (ca. A.D. 600-900). Termination rituals carried out during the renova­tion and abandonment of the structures left arti­facts on burned floors, which allowed us to es­tablish the chronology of the Guzman Group. All radiocarbon determinations are shown in Table 1. The following section summarizes the results of excavation in each structure. 
Structure GZJ 
Structure GZl is a temple structure with a hiero­glyphic stairway (Figure 4). The hieroglyphic stairway consists of six steps, and the inscriptions indicate that it was built around A.D. 726 (Tsukamoto and Esparza 2015). Most carved blocks of the stairway were found in situ or slightly moved forward from their original posi­tions due to post-abandonment disturbance. When relocating the blocks to their original position, we noted that each step had been 77 cm in width, which is wider than usual for the architectural style of this region. The highest step (Step VI) of the stairway connects to a terrace, which, along with the hieroglyphic steps, could have served as a stage for ritual performances. 
Architectural remains revealed that the upper shrine of Structure GZl was decorated with finely cut cornices and had a masonry vault. The shrine contains two low benches at its north and south ends. On the western wall and adjacent to a door­way, two cord holders are framed by red jar necks. Although there is no direct evidence, they may have served to sustain a curtain or to partition the space from the outside area. Textile curtains are frequently observed in court scenes on polychrome vessels (e.g., Kerr 1997:K2573; Kerr 1998:K1453, Kl 728). The outer facing stones of the structure are limestone veneers, finished with thin plaster and red paint. 
The excavations detected evidence of a termi­nation ritual (TRI) in and around Structure GZl . A radiocarbon sample (AA95402; 1220 ± 37 B.P.; wood charcoal) recovered from the termination ritual dates to cal A.D. 687-890 at 2cr (Table 1). A large number of broken artifacts with black and ashy soil were found on the burned floor. Mean­while, no artifacts were found in front of the stair­way. There is no evidence that the hieroglyphic stairway was dismantled, suggesting that the bro­ken artifacts were deposited by people living in the Guzman Group rather than by enemies or other elite factions. 
The excavations discerned different architec­tural characteristics prior to the construction of the hieroglyphic stairway. The structure was modified at least six times, including a termination ritual (TR2) under Structure GZl-Sub 6. The latest mod­ification before the construction of the hieroglyphic stairway represents a non-hieroglyphic stairway built with roughly cut stones. The steps of this stairway are narrower than those of hieroglyphic

stairway, with a tread width of only 23 cm (Figure 5). Although our excavation area is limited, this critical architectural modification suggests that the function of Structure GZl changed along with the building of the hieroglyphic stairway. 
Beneath the second-to-last floor of the upper shrine, the excavation detected a cist burial (Burial I), which was intrusively cut into the fill of the previous plaster floors. Burial 1 contained an adult male interred along with two polychrome vessels. The individual's front teeth had small circular in­lays of jade and pyrite (Tsukamoto and Cerezo­Roman 2013). A piece of femur was used for ra­diocarbon dating (AA95405; 1820 ±100 B.P.), but the small proportion of collagen (. 2 percent) re­maining in the bone resulted in imprecise dating (Table 1). One of the two polychrome vessels has a bird represented on two sides of its walls. The bird has trisected black feathers with a cormorant­like beak and a heron-like eye, which may sym­bolize an aquatic bird (Schele and Miller 1986:55). A fire ritual is indicated by both archaeological and iconographic evidence at Structure GZl. In the archaeological record, we identified a large quantity of charcoal without other artifacts above 
the cist of Burial 1. A radiocarbon sample (AA95401; 1311 ± 37) taken from the charcoal dates to 653-770 cal A.D. at 2a (Table 1). This date range encompasses the inauguration of the hieroglyphic stairway in A.D. 726. In terms of iconography, another cylinder vessel from the bur­ial depicts two mythological scenes of fire rituals (Figure 6). In each scene, an individual in a luxu­rious headdress is seated on a decorated bench. Flames or smoke issue from the hands of the main individual, and a servant stands in front of (and in one case also behind) the individual. Three bands of pseudo-glyphs are drawn on the upper register and in between scenes. Obviously, the fire rituals seen in the iconography and in archaeological re­mains are not one and the same, but both lines of evidence suggest that people associated with the Guzman Group recognized the symbolic signifi­cance of fire rituals.

the original shape of the structure, but provided robust data for establishing the chronology of the Guzman Group (Figure 7). The excavation reached the bottom of the structure where marl (bedrock) was excavated and paved with a plaster floor on the one side and linearly cut and leveled on the other side. This indicates that the bedrock was modified to create a platform (Structure GZ5-Sub 5). Unlike the latest construction episode, the east­west alignment of this bedrock platform is about 17 degrees east of north, an orientation adopted for Structures GZl and GZ2. Decades later, a ter­mination ritual (TR2) was conducted on the surface of the platform. The termination deposits contained burned seeds of a palm tree (Orbignya cohune). Since a palm tree annually produces seeds that cannot be preserved in a tropical environment over an extended period, the carbonized seeds most likely point to the precise date of the termination

Structure GZ6 
Structure GZ6 is a rectangular structure that de­fines the north end of the plaza. Collapsed archi­tectural debris suggests that it was originally vaulted. Extensive excavations uncovered three rooms (Figure 8). These rooms are not intercon­nected via interior doorways; rather, each room has a different entrance. 
The west room is the largest rectangular room of Structure GZ6. The excavation suggests that this room played both public and private roles. The room has a single doorway on the south and two masonry benches: a central throne-like bench located at its center and another lateral bench at the west end. The central bench is .7 m in height and more elaborate than the lateral one. The cen-

tral bench divides the room into east and west parts, but its location is asymmetrical because it is 1.5 m to the west of the central axis of the door­way. The west end of the bench appears to have had a step. The doorway in front of the central bench suggests that the bench served for public events such as receptions and meetings (Harrison 200 1), although its asymmetrical location might have interfered with function. The east part of the room may have served for such public activities,

but this is unclear due to a lack of material remains on the floor. This space is likely to have been swept out when abandoned, so that the excavations recovered only a piece of a broken greenstone ar­tifact and a few ceramic sherds on the burned floor (Figure 9c). 
Meanwhile, the west part of the room, associ­ated with the lateral bench, was likely used for private activities. Access to this bench was re­stricted by a narrow passage with a limestone block

In fact, on the northwestern corner of the lateral bench our excavations found a miniature bowl used as an incense burner (Figure 9b) and a groundstone sphere (Figure 9h). A large number of termination deposits were found in the room and outside the doorway, including a chert eccen­tric (Figure 9g), an obsidian prismatic blade (Figure 9f), and unworked mollusk shells (Figures 9a and 9e). Even though the termination ritual made it difficult to distinguish abandoned artifacts 
from the termination deposits, the absence of burned floor and material concentrations in the area around the lateral bench may indicate that the miniature bowl and ground stone are related to the use of the room rather than termination deposits. 
The function of the other two rooms is unclear. 

The central room is a small quadrangular space with a single doorway on the south. After remov­ing the collapse debris inside the room, we de­tected heavy traces of burning on the floor surface, on which termination deposits were placed. The small size of the room and the location of the doorway in front of the public space might indicate that the central room served as a temporary storage space for collecting tribute or other goods, al­though we do not have direct evidence to support this hypothesis. The east room is a T-shaped rec­tangular space. Unlike the other rooms, it has a doorway on the east side, suggesting that it was used for different activities. The room appears to have been swept out when abandoned, but the ex­cavations recovered a few termination deposits on the burned floor. A complete greenstone celt with evidence of heavy use wear was found in a niche-like space (Figure 9d). The context suggests that the celt was an artifact related to the use of the room, rather than part of the termination de-
