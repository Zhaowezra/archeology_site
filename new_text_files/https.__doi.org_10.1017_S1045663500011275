Meddens, Susan Ramirez, and John Staller, associate or equate the ushnu with an axis mundi, following an early observation made by Zuidema in 1980. While this idea is for the most part not further developed, it could be suggested again that it is the physical and material aspect of the ushnu (as well as the concept of the "axis mundi" per se) that is key to the presumed "joining together of the cosmos" function it performs, rather than just the application of the abstract notion of "joining" to the ushnu feature, e.g., the concept of an axis mundi requires embodiment to be efficacious. 
In the collection of papers as a whole, what I find par­ticularly exciting is the way in which the archaeological evidence promises the possibility of new insights into the significance of Inca ushnus once researchers are released from the strictures of ethnohistory and ethnog­raphy. The material variability of these archaeological features in terms of composition, morphology, location, etc., needs to be further explored rather than glossed over in order to fit them under a single rubric. Many of the chapters in this book begin to take on this challenge. For me, they highlight the importance of seriously engaging with the material and contextual evidence pertaining to ushnus (and other elements of Inca material culture), rather than always defaulting to the minimal and often uniformed comments of the chroniclers. 
In sum, Inca Sacred Space: Landscape, Site and Symbol in the Andes represents a useful and scholarly contribution to Inca,Andean, and precolumbian studies. It integrates information from a number of disciplinary realms to provide insights into the nature and signifi­cance of the Inca ushnu and its role in the imperial Inca project. The book will be of particular interest to Inca specialists and precolumbian scholars in the areas of Archaeology, Anthropology, Ethnohistory, and Land­scape Studies.

The authors of this well-researched volume cover the symbolic importance of lightning in past and modem indigenous societies in Mesoamerica and the Andes. They present the iconographic, historic, archaeological, and cultural evidence for the significance of lightning, in addition to clarifying similarities and differences between these regions. The authors succeed in presenting exhaustive analyses of imagery and indigenous interpre­tations, but in doing so they include tangential and repet­itive cultural information. Another downside of the book includes fuzzy photographs of artifacts that could have been re-done or drawn. 
Staller and Stross point out that lightning is awe inspiring, but its symbolism is not well-studied. Light­ning can destroy, yet people link lightning to fertility, positive spiritual forces, and sacred places where it struck. In general, the authors look at how views of the natural world shaped precolumbian cultures. For instance, ruling elites associate their power and specific gods with lightning, which also makes it crucial for shamans, especially if they survived lightning strikes. Lightning is prevalent in tropical Mesoamerica and in the Andes, and it produces nitric acid in the soil where it strikes, which is important for agriculture. Addition­ally, lightning is associated with stone bifaces, crystals, metals, and child sacrifice. 
In the Andes region, lightning connects the mascu­line sky and the feminine earth by transmitting fluids to fertilize the land. Lightning emerges in myths that incor­porate mountains, rock outcrops, lakes, springs, and caves. Also, lightning was connected to metallurgy, ser­pents, and creation. Lightning infuses metals in cere­monial contexts, especially silver from mountains. Lightning resembles serpents, which symbolize water, storms, war, and fertility. Some information is not obvi­ously connected to lightning, such as marine shell imagery. Nonetheless, the discussions of lightning sym­bolism in Andean society are insightful, including obser­vations on the creation of the heavens. 
Furthermore, Andean shamans receive their power from lightning and their rituals are important for the prosperity of people and animals. The connection between lightning, nature, and shamans supports their religious power and control over fertility and regener­ation. Interestingly, stone bifaces, seen as 'lightning stones,' represent the flight of the souls of shamans. Also, elites can channel the forces of lightning and asso­ciated sacred places, such as mountain, cave, and water shrines, to contact spiritual forces for the benefit of soci­ety and cosmic balance. Through lightning symbolism, rulers construct ties with spirits at ritual places and make the shrines "speak." These messages transmit decisions of the spirits to rulers for the benefit of society, including the generation of life and balancing the cosmos. Andean people view lightning as the creator of twins and people with harelips ('sons of lightning') who fit into notions of dualism in nature and society. 
In Mesoamerica, the authors demonstrate the asso­ciation of lightning with storms, war, mountains, caves, twins, serpents, tobacco, and growth in maize and mush­rooms. Snakes are assistants of lightning because of their similarity in form and since both appear during storms. Tobacco wards off snakes and lightning, and

this plant grows well, like maize and mushrooms, where lightning has struck. The authors link iguanas and croc­odiles to lightning, but it is not clear why, except for their connection to water. Mesoamerican descriptive terms for lightning include "light," "shine," "machete," "explosion" and "god/sacred." Lightning is also a spirit familiar in Mesoamerica. Religious specialists rely on lightning symbolism for bringing fortune, protection, and cures, like 'reading lightning in the blood' (taking a pulse). Lightning can also be utilized by religious spe­cialists for destruction. 
Since lightning appears in clouds on mountains, Mesoamerican people believe that storm deities generate lightning and rain from mountain caves. Shrines to storm gods exist on mountains, but the authors do not mention the important discovery of intricate wooden lightning bolts tossed by worshipers in Mexican alpine lakes during rain ceremonies. Maya people call the storm deity Chahk (also Chae; the figures in the book often do not exhibit clear examples ofChahk), who generates lightning with ax blows in clouds.A connection between lightning bolts and axes was articulated to me recently by Lacandon Maya: lightning must contain an ax since it splits trees! Maya smoking celts represent the power of lightning, sustenance, and kingly power, for according to mythical narratives, they served to crack open the mountain that released maize, water, and other necessities to people. 
In the conclusions, Staller and Stross skillfully pre­sent the similarities and differences in lightning sym­bolism between the two culture areas, but with a general focus on Andean perspectives. The similarities include the association of lightning with mountain lords, twins, and bodies of water, its connection with sacred places and stone tools, its ties to fire and crop fertility, and the use of lightning symbolism by shamans. They suggest that the similarities stem from interaction and parallel inventions without indicating possible shared ancient beliefs. The authors point out that the differences between the regions are based on cultural and environ­mental factors. The association of lightning with rain­bows, the heavens, metallurgy, spiritual forces, masculine and feminine symbolism, and animating forces at sacred places is central to Andean societies. The importance of lightning symbolism with deities, caves, and mythology belongs to Mesoamerica. 
This book is an exceptional reference for analyzing Andean and Mesoamerican lightning symbolism. Occa­sionally, however, the authors' treatments do not contain references for readers to explore, such as the position that Mayan terms for jaguar and snake, in addition to nagual ('spirit familiar') and serpent, are the same. Nonetheless, this book nicely synthesizes copious infor­mation on lightning symbolism and its connection to language, religion, agriculture, and cosmic order. At times the connections are not clarified, but they can be explored with further research. The book is well-written and the illustrations are generally good, especially the color images. This unique book is valuable for examin­ing lightning in culture and how perceptions of natural forces influence people.

A notable trend in recent Central Andean archaeology has been an increase in large and exciting field projects organized and directed by Peruvian investigators, made possible by domestic financial support coming from the central government, regional and municipal authorities, Peruvian businesses, and foreign corporations. These frequently overshadow foreign projects in scale, duration, and funding. Fortunately, this surge in research by Peru­vian scholars has been paralleled by an equivalent spike in the number and quality of books and journals published in Peru. The Boletin de Arqueologia PUCP and Arque­ologia y Sociedad are perhaps the most noteworthy jour­nals, among many others. 
The book under review exemplifies the aforemen­tioned trends. It summarizes recent excavations by Quirino Olivera at four sites in the cloud forest (ceja de selva) of northern Peru. The Andes mountain chain is particularly low and narrow in this area, which has long been appreciated as a major corridor connecting the Peruvian coast and highlands with the forested eastern slopes and vast Amazonian lowlands. Julio C. Tello highlighted this region's importance in the development of Andean civilization, but despite a century of archae­ological work in Peru, the prehistory remained poorly known due to logistical problems and unresolved polit­ical tensions surrounding the contested northern border between Peru and Ecuador. A peace treaty signed between the two nations in 1998 has facilitated fieldwork and even bi-national collaboration. 
Arqueol6gicaAlto Amaz6nica provides a lucid sum­mary of the extensive research carried out by Quirino Olivera between 20 10 and 20 12 at the sites of Monte­grande and San Isidro in J aen, and Casual and Las Juntas in Bagua. The large-scale excavations were sponsored by the regional governments of San Martfn and Ama­zonas, as well as private support from the Friends of the Si pan Museum Association and the Yanacocha Mining Company. The mining company also sponsored the vol­ume under consideration, lavishly illustrated with full­page color photographs of the landscape, excavations,
