ichard L. Burger, Kris Lane, and Colin Cooke (2016) mistakenly claim that Huancavelica was the only source of vermilionpigmentin prehispanic Peru. Cinnabar was also mined in southern Ecuador in the province of Cañar. There are ample historical records of the mines, beginning with their dis­covery about1558byGilRamírezDávalos,the founder of Cuenca (Newson 1995:229). Owing to the complete lack of any archaeological investigation in this area, we know nothing concerning precolumbian use of the mines, although a local Cañari apparently showed them to Ramírez. The of.cial claim (estanco) of 1561, issued by the viceroy to establish royal monopoly over the cinnabar mines of Cuenca (Azogueswaswithin thejurisdictionof Cuenca during the colonial period) and Hua­manga, Peru(Archivo Generalde Indias,Seville ES.41091.AG/29.7.16.4/Patronato, 188, R.21), survives, as does 250 more years of documen­tationofthe mines. 
This source was important enough that the adjoining town was named San Francisco de PeleusídeAzogues after boththe local indige­nous chiefdom and the local cinnabar mines. Multiple documents show that the mines .our­ished for approximately a decade until Huan­cavelica in Peru started full production. The Spanishgovernmentof.cially closedallcinnabar minesexcept Huancavelicain 1570(to limit tax evasion), but Loma Guashon continued inter­mittent production until the beginning of the nineteenth century. 
In 1799, a detailed drawing/map of Loma Guashon showingthe10 sequentially used mine tunnels was made (Supplementary Figure 1). Shortly thereafter, the cinnabar source was exhausted and themines completely abandoned. Ouroriginal articlewas basedonavisittoLoma Guashon in 1996 (Truhan et al. 2005). It was onlyin 2013, whenatrackwasbulldozeddown the deep gully calledQuebrada San Marcos,that we visited the mines themselves; they appear exactly as showninthe 1799 drawing, although the Loma is now covered with a eucalyptus plantation(SupplementaryFigure2). 
In October 2016, we took geological sam­ples from the well-preserved1799 El Boquerón mine (SupplementaryFigures3,4,and5).Stan­dard geochemical sampling (inductively cou­pled plasma) of the altered sandstones at Cerro

Guashon gave 11.8–113.3 ppm Hg (Supple­mentary Table 1), consistent with mining that wouldhavelong since removed the high-grade cinnabar ore, leaving only trace amounts of disseminated cinnabar in the sediments adjacent to the north-south vein. Occurrence of mercury in association with the sedimentary rocks is somewhat similar to the geologic setting of Almadén, Spain, where the ore is also strata-bound, disseminated cinnabar with some native mercury(Rytuba 1986:180).The geochemical signature at Guashon includes As (9–75 ppm) and Sb (10–54 ppm), much like the geochem­ical signature at cinnabar occurrences such as Almadén. The amount of sulfur (182–7262 ppm S)mayberelatedtothesulfur heldincinnabar, but other sulfur-bearing minerals may also be present. There is no .eld evidence to suggest that Guashonisahot-springmercury occurrence. WedismissCooke’scoringinthe CajasNational Park since the prevailing winds of Azogues are north-northwest, not south. Likewise, we dismiss the conjecture, based on an inaccurate translation of the Relaciones Geográ.cas de Indias (Gallegos 1965 [1881]), that the Loma Guashon mines were sources of red ceramic clay. The clay sources are 5–7 km to the southeast (SupplementaryTable2). 
We suggestthat Burger and colleagues’ con­clusion that the only precolumbian cinnabar source was Huancavelica is premature. Georg Petersen mentions 20 cinnabar sources in Peru; 19 remain unsampled (Petersen 2010 [1975]:29). Moreover,notasingleEcuadorianprecolumbian pigment was analyzed. Given the close pre­columbian trade connections between northern Peru and southern Ecuador, one might expect the use of cinnabar there. Whether it was locally mined or traded in from any Peru­vian source has yet to be established. We thank them for posing some questions that may be settled with the publication of our new research.
