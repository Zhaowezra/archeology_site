HOUSEHOLD AND STATUS IN FORMATIVE CENTRAL MEXICO: 
DOMESTIC STRUCTURES, ASSEMBLAGES, AND PRACTICES AT LA 
LAGUNA , TLAX CALA 

David M. Carballo 
Two Terminal Formative (ca. JOO B.C.-A.D. JOO) domestic areas of La Laguna, Tlaxcala, are compared to examine vari­ability in residential structures, assemblages, and practices, and their correlation to status differences at this midsize regional center during the period of initial central Mexican urbanization and state formation. Combining multiple lines of evidence, the study assesses the applicability of previous frameworks for investigating household status to this particular community. It demonstrates significant differences between elite and commoner residences in architectural elaboration, labor mobilization, access to certain foreign goods, and particular ritual practices, but general similarities in domestic economies and more restrained differentiation 
in forms of personal adornment and domestic ritual. These conclusions are consistent with demarcated lineage ranking but relatively minor wealth accumulation by a more rural elite located periph­erally to larger cities and polities. 
Dos zonas residenciales def sitio La Laguna, Tlaxcala, correspondiendo al Formativo terminal (c. JOO a.C.-JOO d.C.), se com­paran para entender la variabilidad en estructuras, conjuntos y prdcticas domesticas en este centro regional de tamaiio medio durante la Jase inicial de urbanizaci6n y de evoluci6n def Estado en el Altiplano Central mexicano. Juntando lfneas de evi­dencia multiples-incluso arquitectura, herramientas utilitarias, adornos persona/es e implementos de uso ritual-el estudio evalua trabajos previos acerca del tema con respecto a la comunidad particular de La Laguna. Demuestra diferencias signi­ficativas entre familias de elite y del comun en la elaboraci6n arquitect6nica, la movilizaci6n del mano de obra, el acceso a ciertos recursos foraneos y en ciertas practicas rituales, pero semejanzas genera/es en sus econom{as domesticas y diferen­cias mas sutiles en tipos de adorno personal y en otros rituales cotidianos. Las conclusiones son consistentes con la presen­cia de demarcaciones bien establecidas entre los ran gos familiares pero relativamente bajos niveles de acumulaci6n de riquezas por parte de una elite rural situada de manera periferica a ciudades y centros de poder mas grandes. 
A
s the most fundamental social unit, the household represents a major organiza­tional framework underlying the diverse beliefs and practices that constitute human soci­eties. Archaeologists reconstruct past household composition and activities through a fragmentary yet unique record of diachronic transformations in the physical spaces and accouterments of domes­tic life. Understanding the complex social arrange­
' ments of any particular society requires an appreciation of the heterogeneity in the economic pursuits and biocultural reproduction that charac­terize its households (Hirth l 993a). Principal con­cerns in household archaeology include evaluating how status differences were materially articulated by families living in early complex societies lack­ing forms of institutionalized inequality or coercive authority, and the impacts that urbanization and state formation had on the domestic practices of such societies. These issues are effectively addressed by recognizing that the physical house often serves as an important setting for political action and the strategic negotiation of social hier­archy (e.g., Bowser and Patton 2004; Lyons 2007), rather than existing wholly outside the public domain. Houses are the most authentic represen­tation of household status in traditional societies­incl uding those studied by archaeologists­because they possess indexical qualities that express and reproduce all dimensions of human social relations, making them a particularly valu­able unit of analysis (Blanton 1994).

This article examines variability in household status through domestic assemblages and the index­ical qualities of house construction at La Laguna, a midsized regional center in Tlaxcala that was occupied during the later Formative period (ca. 600 B.C.-A.D. 100). It was during this period that soci­eties developed urban centers in areas surrounding La Laguna, with large portions of central Mexico being incorporated into Teotihuacan's political sphere during the subsequent Classic period (ca. AD. 100-650; Figure 1, Figure 2). Among world regions, central Mexican households are one of the better understood archaeological, ethnohistoric, and ethnographic cases (e.g., contributions in Har­vey 1991; Manzanilla 1986; Plunket 2002; Sant­ley and Hirth 1993). Nevertheless, many fundamental issues remain unresolved, including 
the prevalence of social differentiation among households within more rural communities con­temporaneous with the first cities and states in the region, the manner in which such differentiation was materially expressed, and changes in house­hold strategies in response to local and regional developments of the time. 
Ethnographic and ethnohistoric records provide excellent detail on aspects of native household orga­nization in more rural portions of central Mexico during the first few decades following the Spanish' 
conquest (e.g., Carrasco 1964, 1976; Cline 1993; Harvey 1986; McCaa 2003; Offner 1984; Williams and Harvey 1997). And the households of con­temporary Nahua communities in Tlaxcala exhibit continuity with prehispanic societies, despite sev­eral important points of divergence (N utini 1968, 1996; Robichaux 1997). The general flexibility characteristic of household organization in central Mexico makes the physical aspect of cohabitation their fundamental organizing principle and domes­tic structures a particularly meaningful unit of archaeological analysis. Lockhart (1992:59-60) identifies in quiahuatl, in ithualli ("the exit, the patio") as the nearest original Nahuatl equivalent for the English terms "family" or "household," highlighting the embededness of the native con­ceptualization of the social unit within an anthro­pogenically bounded, physical space (see also Sullivan's 1987: 211 similar translation for the term cemithualtia as "se hace el patio juntamente"; and discussions by Kellogg 1993; Smith 1993). 
When viewed cross-culturally, house size may reflect a wide range of social factors other than sta­tus (Blanton 1994; Coupland and Banning 1996; Ember 1973; Joyce and Gillespie 2000; Rapoport 1969; Whiting and Ayres 1968; Wilk and Ashmore 1988). However, records from central Mexico doc­ument that higher-status households tended to own larger residences and a greater number of associ­ated structures because they included more depen­dent non-kin, children who were less likely to move away than was the case in lower-status households, and a slighttendency for polygamy (Carrasco 1964, 1971, 1976;Chance2000;Cline 1993;Evans 1989. 1991; Smith 1993; Smith et al. 1999; see also Net­ting 1982). A rural Nahua perspective on house size and elaboration is provided by a sixteenth­century Tlaxcalan, who distinguished between a calpolli ("big house," here referring to a physical

structure, not the social unit) and axacalli (a small wattle-and-daub house that is the origin of the Eng­lish word "shack"; Sullivan 1987:194--195). This native conceptual division provides a useful start­ing point for archaeological classifications that seek to distinguish a greater number of residence forms in order to encompass the synchronic (particularly rural/urban) and diachronic variability observable in central Mexico. 
Households possess enduring qualities as well as the ability to adapt to and actively shape their physical and social surroundings to meet the goals of their members (Rapoport 1969). Throughout the prehispanic sequence, the three most typical types of central Mexican domestic units were ( 1) isolated residences, (2) clusters of several residences around a patio and/or walled enclosure (usually referred to as a patio-group), and (3) very large agglutinated multifamily compounds (with the largest examples including the apartment blocks that housed much of the population at Teotihuacan). Hirth (1993a) has charted the morphological evolution of house types in central Mexico and emphasizes the major change represented by the growth of elite households dur­ing the Formative period (see also Flannery 2002; Grove and Gillespie 1992). 
Although extensive domestic excavations at La Laguna have only been undertaken in two areas of the site-with five others having been explored through fewer, contiguous test units-they demon­strate that families could be strongly differentiated by the size and elaboration of their houses, but more homogeneous in activities associated with portable artifacts commonly linked to status by archaeologists, including ceramic serving wares, evidence of craft production, and burial offerings. The trajectory of community differentiation likely accelerated during the process of early urbaniza­tion elsewhere in central Mexico, before being trun­cated by the dramatic regional restructuring during the first two centuries A.D., which included cata­strophic volcanic eruptions to the south, mass migrations, and the formation and expansion of the Teotihuacan state (Carballo and Pluckhahn 2007· Cowgill 1997; Garcia Cook 1981; Garcia Cook and Merino Carrion 1996; Manzanilla l 999a , 1999b; Millon 1988; Plunket and Uruiiuela 2006 2008; Sanders et al. 1979; Sugiyama 2004). I no tum to these Formative developments to frame La Laguna's place within the regional landscape. 
Polity Formation, Urbanization, and 
Households in the Later Formative Period 

The later Formative period in central Mexico (ca. 600 B.C.-A.D. 100) is of interest to comparative perspectives on the origins of regional polities with proto-urban centers (i.e., chiefdoms), cities, terri­torially expansionistic states, and the growth and intensification of the economic and ideological exchanges that accompanied and contributed to the development of such institutions. The largest For-; 
-
mative centers in central Mexico evolved in south-em portions of the region, which is generally more advantageous for maize agriculture than the north. Among these were the dominant urban or proto­urban centers of Cuicuilco, Tlapacoya, Tlalan­caleca, and Xochitecatl (Gamez Eternod 1993; Garcia Cook 1981; Sanders et al. 1979; Serra Puc he 1998). Cuicuilco's monumental constructions and estimated population of 10,000-20,000 (Sanders et al. 1979), and Tlalancaleca's 500 ha occupation (Garcia Cook 1981) could be classified as urban following more inclusive frameworks (e.g., Pauke­tat 2007; Yoffee 2005), though the extent and orga­nization of their associated settlements and political domains are poorly understood (see Spencer and Redmond 2004). These communities appear to have been virtually abandoned during the first cen­tury A.D., and Teotihuacan, located farther north, became the largest city in the Americas, politically consolidating much of central Mexico and influ­encing societies in other regions of Mesoamerica (Millon 1988). Cholula and Cantona also urban­ized rapidly at this time and likely maintained inde­pendent polities from Teotihuacan (Garcia Cook 2003; Plunket and Uruiiuela 2005). Volcanic erup­tions in the south appear to have been a major stim­ulus for mass-migrations and the restructuring of central Mexican society, including the rise ofTeoti­huacan as the preeminent Mesoamerican city (Pas­trana 1997; Plunket and Uruiiuela 2003, 2005, 2006; Serra Puche 2005; Siebe 2000). 
Following earlier investigations of the largest Formative centers, which placed greater emphasis on nondomestic architecture and chronology, archaeologists have undertaken detailed studies of Formative households based on extensive, hori­zontal excavations (e.g., Grove and Cyphers 1987; Manzanilla 1985; Plunket and Uruiiuela 1998; Sanders et al. l 975a, l 975b; Santley 1993; Serra

Puche 1986, 1988; Serra Puche et al. 200 I). Their 
work has documented the three major central Mex­
ican residential arrangements known from later 
periods: isolated houses; patio-groups consisting of 
three houses facing an open space; and enclosed 
house compounds with multiple dwellings-the 
latter two forms serving as the templates for the 
three-structure complexes and apartment com­
pounds at Teotihuacan (Plunket and Urufiuela 
1998; Santley 1993; Urufiuela and Plunket 2007). 
The over two-dozen houses excavated at Tetimpa 
by Plunket, Urufiuela, and colleagues-excellently 
preserved under volcanic eruption layers-are far 
and away the most data-rich cases of later Forma­
tive residences for central Mexico (Plunket and 
Urufiuela 1998, 2003, 2005, 2006, 2008; Plunket 
et al. 2005; Urufiuela and Plunket 1998, 2001, 
2007). Accordingly, this study frequently draws 
comparisons with Tetimpa to help illuminate sim­
ilarities and differences between the two residen­
tial areas at La Laguna. 
An increase in the number of communities with 
larger and more elaborate houses is suggestive of 
escalating social inequality and elite differentia­
tion, and is clearly discernable during later phases 
of the Formative (Charlton 1969; Grove and Gille­
spie 1992; Hirth 1993a; Plunket et al. 2005; Serra 
Puche I 986). Hirth has attributed the significant 
increase in large residential structures to the devel­
opment of social ranking and eventual class strat­
ification, which restructured and diversified 
household economies and created new social roles 
for the domestic spaces occupied by elite families. 
He reasons that the enlargement of houses and 
households was linked to elite domestic practices 
requiring more space, greater disparity in the dis­
tribution of resources, and the effects that prestige 
would have had in discouraging residential fis­. sioning within the families of incipient elites (Hirth 1 I 993a:3 l ). 
Communities in northern Tlaxcala were part of 
this macroregional process of elite differentiation, 
with the inhabitants of larger settlements likely 
organized by individuals possessing increasingly 
formalized authority to coordinate group action on 
a large scale, such as the labor necessary to con­
struct public ceremonial precincts. Guadalupita Las 
Dalias (northwest), La Laguna (center), and Cer­
ritos de Huamantla (southeast) were the largest set­
tlements in their respective subregions. Although substantially smaller than contemporary regional centers in southern Puebla-Tlaxcala, all three were situated along an important natural communication corridor extending from the northern Basin of Mex­ico toward the Gulf of Mexico (Borejsza 2006; Carballo and Pluckhahn 2007; Garcia Cook 1981; Garcia Cook and Merino Carrion 1996; Garcia Cook and Rodriguez 1975; Merino Carrion 1989; Snow 1969, 1972). La Laguna's size (100 ha) and quantity of ceremonial architecture relative to adja­cent settlements suggest that the community con­trolled a modest polity during the later Formative period (Carballo and Pluckhahn 2007:619-621). The same may apply to the other two sites, or Guadalupita Las Dalias may have been a subordi­nate center to Tlalancaleca (Garda Cook 1981; Garda Cook and Rodriguez 1975). 
Domestic Excavations at La Laguna 
La Laguna (19.50°N I 98.00°W) was documented as the largest Formative community in north-central Tlaxcala by the surveys undertaken by Snow ( 1966, 1969) and Garcia Cook and Merino Carrion ( 1991; Merino Carrion 1989). Excavations were first ini­tiated at the site by Borejsza (2006) who focused on its land-use history as part of the UCLA For­mative Apizaco Project directed by Lesure. Project excavations at three other Formative sites in cen­tral and northern Tlaxcala failed to uncover clear residential architecture due to their thin soils and severe erosion, but were able to identify household units (sensu Flannery 2003 [1983]) through the dis­tribution of preserved subterranean features (Lesure et al. 2006). Excavation of test units and trenches at La Laguna in 2004 documented preserved domestic architecture worthy of future explorations in excavation areas designated Area F and Area H (Figure 3). Seventeen radiocarbon dates trace the site's initial occupation ca. 600-400 B.C., a possi­ble hiatus lasting as long as three centuries, and a second occupation of ca. 100 B.C.-A.D. 150 (see Borejsza 2006:Appendix E). The community apparently reached its greatest extent during this later Formative occupation before being abandoned sometime during the second century A.D. Follow­ing this abandonment only isolated homesteads were established within the boundaries of the for­mer Formative community during the Epiclassic to Late Postclassic periods.

The first two seasons of the Proyecto Arque­ol6gico La Laguna (PALL) were designed to inves­tigate household variability through horizontal excavations permitting comparison of domestic structures and assemblages, and focusing primar­ily on Areas F and H. La Laguna's complex land­scape history (detailed by Borejsza 2006; Borejsza et al. 2008) and location in a saddle between three surrounding hills combine for preservation and vis­ibility conditions that are unusual for central Mex­ico. Colluviation of the site center and the retention of slope sediments through metepantles (a bancal­type or ditch-and-berm terracing system secured with maguey [Agave spp.] plants) on the sur­rounding hills have served to obscure all architec­ture from the surface except for the tallest structures (over approximately 1.5 m). Visible mounds in the flat site center correspond to civic-ceremonial struc­tures, but others on the lower slopes ringing the site served as residences, which became apparent in Area H through the preliminary surface collections and test excavations. The conditions at the site dic­tate that household comparisons be made exclu­sively through extensive excavation rather than surface architecture and artifacts, as is often possi­ble at other highland Mexican sites. While these conditions make for laborious recovery methods and small comparative samples-in this case, only two domestic areas-they allow for the possibility of comparing well-preserved domestic structures with subsurface contexts such as living surfaces and domestic features. 
Research Questions 
Excavation and analytical methods were planned, rndertaken, and refined to answer the following ·esearch questions. How did the members of house­1olds physically modify the landscapes they occu­)ied to serve their residential needs through the lonstruction of structures, plazas, terraces, and )ther features? How were status differences fos­ered and maintained through the social uses of naterial culture, and what is an approximate range 1f variation in household status at the site? What 
vel of access did households have to interregional xchange goods, and did this access vary in rela­ion to their status? What domestic activities, 1cluding craft production and rituals, did house­olds engage in? Where did such activities take lace, and may their practice and/or constituents have also varied in relation to individual or collec­tive identities? Finally, how did these dimensions of domestic life change over time during a span of approximately seven centuries? 
Methods 
The comparative excavation of a domestic area near the periphery of the site with no architecture visible from the surface and one ringing the site cen­ter possessing visible structures was planned as a means of addressing the above research questions. The initial objectives for each area were developed with some underestimation of the depth of cultural deposits and an overestimation of the likelihood of encountering preserved floors with artifacts located in situ. Excavation strategies and lines of reason­ing were therefore modified in response to the con­texts encountered below the surface. Excavations at Areas F and H were similar in being a mix of broad horizontal exposures and more narrow con­tiguous excavations to define domestic architecture. They were nearly identical in volume: roughly 128 m3 for Area F and 130 m3 for Area H. This simi­larity in sample size, the general contemporaneity of the residential structures in both areas, and the presence of earlier cultural features truncated by later constructions and living surfaces make for complementary contexts on which to base social comparisons. 
Excavations in Area F 
Domestic excavations in Area F uncovered a resi­dential platform with a surface covering approxi­mately 120 m2 that once supported a small (ca. 4 x 3 m) wattle-and-daub house, several pit features extending from the floor into the fill of the plat­form, and earlier underlying and adjacent pit fea­tures (Structure ISM-I; Figure 4). The platform served as a residential terrace, its inhabitants hav­ing artificially flattened their living surface by building a sloped (talud) stone wall on two sides to retain an anthropogenic fill they deposited over a prior occupation surface and the natural slope of Cerro Las Palmas. Similar residential terraces were also constructed during the Formative at Ecatepec, in the northern Basin of Mexico (Lopez Wario 1993), and at Tetimpa (Plunket and Urufiuela 1998). 
A small staircase provided a formal access to the platform from down slope, but the surface of the platform also met the natural contours of the

hill on two of its four sides. Postholes delineating a concentration of rocks, small daub fragments, and a rectangular block that served as a single entrance step are all that remain of the house crown­ing the platform. Flannery and Marcus (2005: 31-34) detail the construction of wattle-and­daub houses in highland Mesoamerica as frequently involving the use of maguey-fiber rope to lash canes together and connect them to weight-bearing posts. 
Daub tends to be made from the same clay that is used for pottery, but can be mixed with lime to pro­duce a finer finishing coat that is often burnished in higher-status residences, rather than being left to crack in the sun. Field-stone foundations and door sills or steps, like those in Area F, help to ori­ent the house plan archaeologically. These obser­vations are all consistent with the remains excavated in Area F, which likely supported only

the single structure on its platfonn, though some uncertainty exists because a second could have fit on the unexcavated portion to the east. 
No complete, in situ artifacts were encountered on the packed earthen living surface except for an enigmatic deposit of two human crania with a thin black ceramic cup or vase placed between them. The deposit was located in front of the entrance to the house, only 10 cm below the modem ground surface. Its proximity to the surface resulted in post­depositional disturbance that crushed much of one skull, damaged the top of the second, and truncated the neck and rim of the vessel. The lower portions of all three objects were articulated, however, and the positioning of the mandible of the more com­plete skull in front of its face indicates that the indi­viduals had decomposed prior to their skulls being redeposited in front of the house (Figure 5). The arrangement is suggestive of a secondary usage of the previously interred skulls for a termination rit­ual. Together with the lack of other in situ artifacts, it is consistent with a refatively slow abandonment of the residential area in Area F1• 
The inhabitants of the platform built atop an earlier occupation that included pit features dug into tepetate. Two small hearths and the walls of the plat­form cover and truncate three earlier bell-shaped pits and one larger, inegularly shaped pit, the mouth of which was reused for a flexed burial covered by a small rock alignment. A single radiocarbon sam­ple recovered from the anthropogenic fill of the platform dates to the Middle Fonnative at 2400 ± 40 B.P. or la cal 520-400 B.C. (Beta-216423; charred C4 plant; o13C = -10.4%0). It was likely redeposited from the earlier occupation, as ceram­ics from features within the platform are diagnos­tic of the Tezoquipan and early Teotihuacan phases, including two complete vessels that served as the receptacle and lid for the burial of a neonate within the floor near the house. The two small hearths and intrusive burial surrounding the platform and eight pit features in the platform fill were all contempo­raneous with its occupation. A hearth on the plat­form was filled with burnt rocks, fine ash, and carbon, including pieces of maguey plants that were roasted in front of the house (Popper 2007). The

other pits on the platform likely served for storage prior to their secondary usage for trash disposal and the neonate burial. 
Excavations in Area H 
The structures of a residential complex in Area H proved to be considerably larger than could be determined from the surface. After encountering a stone-faced talud platform in the 2004 test exca­vations, our working hypothesis became that it rep­resented the subplatform supporting a residence comparable to the house arrangements documented at Tetimpa (Plunket and Urufiuela 1998). Excava­tions demonstrated it to be a smaller, independent platform (Structure 14M-3) possibly used as a kitchen or for storage and adjacent to two very large (ca. 25 x 25 x 2.4 m) residential platforms with talud faces that were coated with layers of smoothed concrete (aplanado), and which once supported substantial wattle-and-daub structures that were smoothed and painted with vibrant poly­chrome geometric motifs (Structures 14M-1 and 14M-2; Figure 6, Figure 7). The depth and extent of the excavations, and size and elaboration of the structures, led us to wonder whether the area may have served more communal functions rather than as residences. Yet the abundant materials recovered during excavations were exclusively compatible with the structures being residential-indeed, they are remarkably similar to those recovered from Area F, as is discussed below-and associated domestic features included hearths and subfloor burials. The structures are on the larger end of the spectrum for currently documented residences from Formative central Mexico, but share a precedent with and are similar in form to a large (ca. 13 x 13 x 2.5 m) house excavated by Sanders at Tezoyuca, in the northern Basin of Mexico (Charlton 1969:285-286; Sanders et al. 1975a:89-90, 1975b:489; Se.rra Puche 1986: 174-175). They are also similar in size to a residence excavated at Cerro del Tepalcate, in the western basin (Serra Puche 1986:1980-1981, 1983). 
As in Area F, construction in Area H truncates an earlier occupation surface, including three bell­shaped pits directly under the most extensively excavated structure (Structure 14M-l). Materials from these contexts provide points of chronologi­cal comparison with later occupation. In contrast to Area F, the structures in Area H underwent at 
least two major construction phases, with a slightly smaller substructure (Structure 14M-1-sub) built approximately one century earlier than Structure 14M-1. This earlier version was also impressively large-with walls covered in multiple smoothed mud layers rather than concrete-and indicates that the family who organized constructions in Area H was capable of mobilizing substantial labor projects for multiple generations. Moreover, landscape modifications in Area H were extensive, involving the artificial flattening and terracing of an area of hill slope that covers more than 1 ha, and the lat­est Formative occupation was terminated by the conflagration of the structures, involving a fire that reached temperatures high enough to preserve large segments of daub walls and comer posts and to vit­rify the daub adhering to several posts (Figure 8). The burnt northern comer post of the later struc­ture was conventionally dated to 1920 ± 40 B.P. or lrr cal A.D. 10 -140 (Beta-227413; wood char­coal; 813C -24.7%0), while carbon within the

northern comer post-hole of the substructure was AMS dated to 2090 ± 40 B.P. or lrr cal 170 -50 
B.C. (Beta-227414; wood charcoal; 813C 
= 
-19.6%0). Assuming that Structure 14M-l was occupied for a generation prior to its destruction, the abandonment of Area H can be dated to the early second century A.D., and occupation of the large residences spanned approximately two centuries prior to that event. 
The crushed-tepetate floors of the structures in Area H were regrettably eroded away except for a segment in the center of Structure 14M-1, which did not have in situ artifacts on it but contained an extended burial excavated within it. The floor apparently once covered the entire 400 m2 surface of the platform, as broken floor fragments were abundant in structural collapse layers on all sides. A second burial was encountered in a flexed posi­tion and partially covered with an orange vessel within a subfloor pit where the crushed-tepetate had eroded. An infant burial containing a miniature ves­sel and surrounded by fragmentary textile remains was encountered in one of the bell-shaped pits dat­ing to the occupation prior to the large structures. Carbon from a large olla fragment placed directly above the infant, possibly burnt as part of a mor­tuary rite, was AMS dated to the early Middle For­mative at 2580 ± 40 B.P. or Irr cal 800-770 B.C. (Beta-227412; wood charcoal; 813C = -25 .3%0). It

seems likely that old wood was used in this case, as the ceramics from La Laguna do not support such an early occupation at the site. However, the date is consistent with the three bell-shaped pits dug into tepetate underneath Structure 14M-l as corre­sponding to the early occupation of ca. 600-400

Structures, Assemblages, and 
Household Status 


Analytical frameworks for assessing household sta­tus through structures and assemblages have been developed by Smith (1987), Hirth (1989, 1993b), and Blanton ( 1994 ). Although these studies are applicable to other world regions, they have been informed by their authors' experiences in the archaeology of central Mexico and are directly rel­evant to drawing household comparisons at La Laguna. All three emphasize the need to combine multiple lines of evidence in evaluating household status and the primacy of structure size and elabo­ration as an authentic indication of the occupant family's status-since the requisite labor is com­paratively costly and less subject to falsification in traditional societies lacking large lending institu­tions (Blanton 1994: 16). Preserved domestic assemblages provide alternate lines of evidence for reconstructing differential social identities and practices along this primary axis of household sta­tus (see also Kamp 2000). 

While the scale and elaboration of construction is very different in the two domestic areas at La Laguna, their associated artifact assemblages are not, save for some illuminating points of compar­ison discussed below. One broad difference with important implications is the higher density of all artifact classes associated with the structures in Area H except for bone tools (Table 1 ). This pat­tern is consistent with Area H having served as the residence of a larger household than the one that inhabited the platform in Area F, as is also implied by the great differences in scale of the construc­tions. Hirth (l 993b) and Smith (1987) both corre­late higher densities of possessions with higher status, particularly items associated with dress, adornment, and food service, when preserved remains or residues are detectable. 
A significant difference in depositional contexts exists between the two areas, however. Whereas the family in Area F discarded some of their trash directly into pits within the earthen surface they inhabited or over the side of the platform, the fam­ily in Area H inhabited structures with formal, crushed-tepetate floors and disposed their refuse elsewhere. Their solid floors were only broken for placing subfloor burials within them. Nevertheless, shallow pits filled with trash were excavated into the earthen surface of the smaller adjacent platform (Structure 14M-3), and a portion of the occupation surface northeast of Structure 14M-l contained materials that accumulated next to the structure over

its approximately two-century occupation. Further, the structures in Area H appear to have been aban­doned more hastily than Area F, likely associated with the burning event terminating occupation of the large structures. Although complete pots or other large items were not encountered on floors in Area H, fragmented sernicomplete vessels and smaller possessions were recovered primarily from struc­tural collapse matrix containing abundant burnt daub and carbon, suggesting they were carried from floors into collapse layers. 
Below I review five categories of household practices and assess their associated material impli­cations in greater detail. The categories include ( l) craft production, viewed primarily through evi­dence of lithic production and tool types; (2) food service, viewed primarily through pottery forms and decoration; (3) personal adornment, viewed through earspools, beads, and access to nonlocal resources used for ornamentation; (4) ritual activ­ities, viewed through obsidian lancets potentially used for bloodletting and effigy vessels used for burning incense; and (5) the themes of house con­struction, decoration, and destruction that physi­cally situate the activities involving the above materials. 

In the case of pottery and chipped-stone tools­the two most abundant artifact classes­comparative contexts have been divided between secure early deposits, predating the house con­strnctions by a few centuries, and deposits associ­ated principally with the occupation of the structures. The pottery analysis is based on sherds originating solely from living surlaces, pit features, and construction nuclei, and only includes the rims and few complete vessels from these contexts. The chipped-stone analysis includes materials origi­nating from features predating the structures, sep­arated from the later features, living surfaces, construction fill, and overburden layers. Although it is certain that the latter two contexts contain an admixture of materials dating to the earlier occu­pation, they are included to provide a large sample originating from Area H, which lacks the quantity of subfloor pit features excavated in Area F, but whose overburden is primarily structural collapse that can be confidently associated with the Late­Terminal Formative occupation-much more so than surface materials, for instance, but not as ideal as materials exclusively from living surlaces and pit features. Less-abundant artifact classes are divided exclusively by their area of origin.

Craft Production 

Smith ( 1987) considered the complex relationship between household craft production and status. While certain production activities may serve as a means of increasing household wealth or as a reflec­tion of status, many others may be indicative of impoverished resources and/or landholdings and the necessity of crafting as viable but less desirable means of household provisioning (see also Santley 2007:211-213). Accordingly, he divided house­hold tools and equipment into categories of house­hold maintenance items, tools used in domestic production for use, agricultural implements, and tools for specialized artisan production­illustrating that cross-culturally most artifacts under these categories are not reliable indicators of house­hold wealth, and that domestic and specialized­production tools are often inversely associated with wealth except in certain cases of attached produc­tion (Smith 1987:309-310). Among the materials from La Laguna's Areas F and H, chipped-stone tool production, chipped-stone tool use in other production activities, and fiber/textile production involving bone tools and perforated ceramic discs are all potentially representative of household pro­duction for its own use. Any could also represent specialized artisan production if the output were to significantly exceed household consumption needs. The assemblages from both areas are largely sim­ilar and are supportive of diversified production for household consumption, with the possibility of only low levels of production directed toward exchange. 
Stone tools at La Laguna were made primarily 

from obsidian imported from a minimum of 58 km away, and secondarily from more locally available microcrystalline, basaltic, and felsic stones (sum­marized in Table 2). In general, obsidian was used for formal and informal cutting, piercing, and scrap­ing tools; microcrystalline stones (i.e., chert) were used for informal cutting tools and formal scrap­ing tools; and basaltic/felsic stones (i.e., basalt, andesite, rhyolite) were used for formal scraping and grinding tools. A difference is discernable between the frequency of green obsidian in the two areas, which originated primarily from the Pachuca source and is roughly twice as dense in late con­texts at Area H compared with Area For with ear­lier contexts at Area H2. Nevertheless, green obsidian was a minor component in the lithic assemblages-never exceeding five percent-and the inhabitants of both areas appear to have enjoyed ready access to obsidian, obtaining it primarily from the Pared6n source (see also Carballo 2006; Carballo et al. 2007). 
The technological analyses (summarized in Table 3) are more informative regarding produc­tion activities and the differential usage of lithic materials. They draw on previous frameworks developed by Clark and Bryant (1997) and Hirth and Flenniken (2006). Production activities repre­sented by tools and byproducts (debitage) are broadly similar between the two areas and occu­pation phases but contain informative differences. The general debitage category groups byproducts that exhibit few diagnostic attributes and cannot be confidently assigned to a type of production activ-

ity. Through inference to other categories, it is likely that debitage in this category relates primarily to uniface and biface production, expedient-flake technologies, and core shaping associated with pressure-blade production (i.e., "prismatic" blades). 
Although the frequency of scraping tools is nearly identical in both areas, the approximately five-times higher frequency ofbasaltic/felsic stone from Area F suggests that more trapezoidal maguey scrapers ("desfibradores"; Figure 9j) were made there compared with Area H3, though smaller "spoon" or "turtle-backed" unifacial scrapers (Fig­ure 9i) made from obsidian and microcrystalline stones were produced and used similarly in both areas (see Evans 2005; Parsons and Parsons 1990; Serra Puche 1988:145-187; Tesch and Abascal I 974). The densest concentration ofbasaltic/felsic flakes originated from the roasting pit with remains of carbonized maguey plants on the platform in Area F. Debitage in this deposit is consistent with the production of trapezoidal implements for removing maguey fibers rather than grinding tools because the flakes are primarily small (ca. 3 cm), many are consistent with the transformation of a blocky edge into a serrated one (as is necessary in making such tools from local lajas), and certain flakes exhibit polish consistent with the repolish­ing of a spalled scraper edge. The difference in the frequencies of basaltic flakes together with the evi­dence of roasting maguey and manufacturing trape­zoidal scrapers on the platform in Area F suggests that its inhabitants were more involved in process­ing the plant for food and fiber, while those from both areas may have used small scrapers equally for extracting sap (aguamiel) from the plants and/or other domestic scraping activities such as of wood and hides. 
Prismatic blades and blade-production byprod­ucts are the largest category of diagnostic lithic remains from all contexts. The quantities of exhausted bladecores, core preparation and main­tenance items, and blade-segment ratios (see DeLeon et al. 2009) provide compelling evidence for blade production during the later occupation associated with the excavated structures in both areas. Though samples are much smaller for the ear­lier occupations, the same attributes more tenu­ously suggest that whole blades were acquired through exchange in Area F, but were produced by the inhabitants of Area H themselves. The later local blade production in both areas included the reduction of very wide blades from large Pared6n percussion cores (macrocores)-potentially acquired directly from the source or from individ­uals living near it-and the reduction of narrower blades from previously formed pressure cores orig­inating from other sources. As an example, random samples of I 00 Pared6n blades and I 00 Pachuca blades demonstrate the much greater width (Pared6n mean = 1.38 cm; Pachuca mean = I .00 cm; t = 6.84, p < .001) and variability (Pared6n s

.5 1; Pachuca s = .22) of Pared6n blades, consis­tent with a more complete reduction sequence of Pared6n obsidian at the site beginning with larger cores.4 A similar distinction characterizes house­holds at Tetimpa, but that community appears to have acquired pressure cores primarily from the Otumba source, rather than percussion cores from Pared6n, and Pachuca blades were acquired as fin­ished products (Plunket et al. 2005). These later reduction stages are likely reflective of Tetimpa's greater distance from obsidian sources relative to La Laguna (ca. 75 km and 51 km, respectively, from their most represented sources). 

Although certain tools were produced in both areas and were used for other production activities, the lithic data are inconsistent with specialized pro­duction greatly exceeding household consumption. Following the expectations of analysts for special­ized blade production oriented toward exchange (e.g., Clark 1997; Healan 2002; Santley et al. 1986), the relative quantities of core fragments and byproducts and/or early-series pressure blades rel­ative to late-series pressure blades in both areas is consistent with household consumption over a cou­ple of centuries of late occupation or only low lev­els of production for exchange. 
An important but poorly represented implement made from blades is the obsidian lancet, three of which were recovered from Area H while none were encountered in Area F (Figure 9h). Though

these are finely worked implements that would require relatively high knapper skill to produce, there is no satisfactory technological explanation for why they should be in Area H and not in Area 
F. Another possibility, discussed below, is that the lancets implicate different ritual practices or usage norms between the two residential areas. 
Bone tools and perforated ceramic discs are other durable artifact classes that relate to prehis­panic central Mexican craft production, particu­larly as tools used in spinning, sewing, and weaving textiles. Perforated discs (Figure 9f) have been observed ethnographically to serve as spindle whorls in central Mexico (Parsons and Parsons 1990:3 14-315) and are often interpreted as such in archaeological contexts (e.g., Hall 1997), though some scholars argue for other uses including as lids for jars or bottles (Flannery and Marcus 2005:77; Niederberger 1976:234). The whorl identification is supported for La Laguna since there are few jars/bottles that could be successfully covered with a disc of :S 5 cm (none in the over 2000 rims sherds analyzed to date). No formal spindle whorls, com­mon during later periods (Garcia Cook and Merino Carrion 197 4 ), have been encountered from secure Formative contexts at La Laguna. It would be imprudent to interpret much from the differences of perforated ceramic discs, bone needles (Figure 9e), and potential bone awls/shuttles between the two areas because the sample sizes are so small 

(1:2:4 for Area F, 9:3:2 for Area H, respectively). The data can only be construed as indicative of low levels of domestic spinning and weaving for house­hold consumption. Overall, materials relating to craft production are suggestive of diversified house­hold economies with relatively low levels of inter­dependence among households in production activities. 
i Food Service 
A number of human social relations are mediated through formalized consumption events involving food, drink, and/or substances that are consumed in forms, quantities, and/or vessels that designate the event as being extraordinary. Archaeologists recognize the utility of ceramic serving wares to investigating household status competition and alliance formation (e.g., contributions in Dietler and Hayden 2001). Serving wares also figure prominently in the frameworks by Smith (1987) 
and Hirth (1989, 1993b) for assessing status. Hirth 
(1993b:137-138) applied his model to houses at 
Xochicalco, demonstrating that elite residences­
identified primarily by their size and architectural 
elaboration-possessed greater quantities of all 
ceramics and a higher proportion of decorated serv­
ing wares relative to other types and forms. While 
the first pattern also obtains for La Laguna, the sec­
ond does not. 

The total density of ceramics at Area H was over twice that of Area F, very similar to the ratio of stone tools primarily for grinding maize (Table 1, Rows 4-5). Both are consistent with the structures in Area H having been the residence of a larger household involved in more food production and consump­tion than the household in Area F. But in isolating serving-ware rims originating from contexts that are more clearly associated with the structures and earlier occupation-features, construction nuclei, and living surfaces-a counterintuitive pattern emerges. Within this sample, the size of serving wares is equal between the two areas or is only slightly larger in Area H; mean rim diameters are similar, but Area H has proportionately more large (diameter  20 cm) vessels as a percentage of all serving vessels (Table 4). However, after having 
proportionally a greater number of large decorated serving wares than Area F during its early occupa­tion, the percentage in Area H drops sharply dur­ing its late occupation to a low of five percent. 
The reasons for this counterintuitive pattern could be either chronological/stylistic or behav­ioral. The ceramics from Area H appear to chrono­logically straddle the boundary between the Tezoquipan and Teotihuacan phases, identified by Merino Carrion (1989), to a greater degree than those from Area F. Teotihuacan phase ceramics in the region include more monochrome vessels with­out the characteristic red and white incised bichromes of Tezoquipan assemblages (see also Garcia Cook and Merino Carrion 1988; Rattray 200 1; Sanders et al. 1975a, 1975b; West 1965). It is possible that Area F was abandoned slightly ear­lier than Area H, which could account for the dif­ferences between the two based simply on the phase-wide transition to more monochomes and proportionally fewer decorated wares. Alterna­tively, the higher frequencies of decorated serving vessels at Area F and at Area H centuries prior to the large structures could be representative of a

more typical pattern associated with interhouse­hold consumption events, while the later occupa­tion involved larger, community-wide events at the center of the site. It is conceivable that the inhabi­tants of Area H assumed a prominent role as com­munity leaders during consumption events in the ceremonial center, lessening the role of their resi­dence as an arena for such events in the process. A refinement of the regionai ceramic chronology, an improved understanding regarding site abandon­ment, and more investigations at the site center are necessary to satisfactorily resolve these issues. 
Personal Adornment 
More notable differences between the household assemblages are discernable in the materials and types of adornments used by their inhabitants. Smith (1987:317) classified personal adornments under the category "nonutilitarian luxuries" and noted how imported marine shell and jade were used by wealthy Mesoamerican households to index their status. Grove and Gillespie ( 1992) iden­tified jade and iron ore as the materials that most clearly differentiated household status in Forma­tive central Mexican sites such as Tlatilco and Chal­catzingo. Since only single pieces of iron ore and what visually appears to be true jadeite have been recovered from La Laguna to date, I focus on other varieties of greenstone (which may include ser­pentine and fuchsite ), shell, and clay ears pools in exploring how status was expressed through durable ornaments worn by the inhabitants of the two residential areas. Following Lesure (1999), I consider these objects to have possessed gradations of values to La Laguna's inhabitants, which fos­tered and upheld social identities and inequalities by simultaneously asserting similarities and dif­ferences between their owners (see also Wille 2004 ). 
Greenstone represents the material type with the greatest disparity in density between the two areas-over 26 times higher in Area H. This con­trast is striking, but much of it is likely attributable to a greenstone bead necklace or bracelet having been on the flooron Structure 14M-l where 20 disc beads and bead fragments were washed down with structural collapse to the northern corner and encountered in eight contiguous excavation units. Beads of an identical style (Figure 9d) were also encountered within the construction fill and in a post-hole of the structure, however, indicating that the inhabitants of Area H possessed other adorn­ments of this type. As a point of comparison, the density of greenstone recovered at Structure 14M­1 was 30 percent higher than that which was recov­ered from an elite residence at Chalcatzingo (cf. Grove and Cyphers 1987:Table 4.1.; Lesure 1999:Table 3-1; Thomson 1987:Table 17.2.). Yet greenstone was not abundant everywhere at La Laguna, and just a single bead fragment was uncov­ered from the residence in Area F. 
Differences in shell densities are less significant, but the density in Area H is still over five times greater than Area F, with a differential ratio over twice that of utilitarian items such as stone tools

and ceramics (Table l, Row 7). Certain shell frag­ments represent parts of tubular beads and sequin­sty le ornaments, while other pieces cannot be clearly attributed to personal adornments but may have been from their manufacture or from complete shells that were manipulated for household activi­ties before being broken and discarded. In Struc­ture l 4M-l they were concentrated in units at the northern comer, with many of the greenstone beads, but were also encountered in structural collapse layers to the east and west of the platform. 
A third type of personal adornment is earspools, which were exclusively items to be worn in the ear­lobe at La Laguna, rather than the larger examples used as decorative elements on dress known from other Mesoamerican contexts. La Laguna's ear­spools possess interesting axes of variability that permit an investigation of the gradations of value within a single artifact class. These include: (1) material type, with all examples from Areas F and H being ceramic, but a single fragment of one made from greenstone discovered at the site center (Fig­ure lOg); (2) form, with a primary division between solid and hollow ceramic (Figure 9a-c ), but vari­ants included flaring, fluted, and scalloped rims (Figure 9b); (3) surface treatment, particularly monochrome slips versus bichrome slips or exam­ples with painted geometric decorations; and (4) dimensions, such as the circumference that would fit in one's ear and the size of the flaring portion, if present. 
Garcia Cook (1976) attributed formal variation between solid and hollow earspools in Formative Puebla-Tlaxcala as being either related to status or to chronology. Grove (1987:271) interpreted solid ceramic earspools as non-elite adornments at Chal­catzingo, but did not designate hollow ones as higher-status adornments due to a small sample. Nevertheless, a patterned distribution of hollow earspools being concentrated at the center ofChal­catzingo is observable (Grove 1987:Table 16.1.). A concentration of hollow earspools at the site cen­ter is also observable at La Laguna, where they were the exclusive type encountered in 30 m3 of exca­vations there in 2005 (Carballo 2006:Table 2). 
Hollow earspools are found more frequently in Area H than in Area F, but they are the majority type in both areas and this subtle distinction can only be compellingly connected to status when considered in conjunction with overall densities and other attributes (Table 1, Row 6; Table 5). Ear­spools are more abundant in Area H and are also more variable than in Area F, including the pres­ence of a few decorated examples (with fluting, incising, and painting) and twice the number of styles of surface treatment. They are also signifi­cantly larger in Area H (interior diameter t -1 .86, 
= 

.1 <p <.05; exterior diameter t = 1.5, .2 <p < .1). 
While none of these differences are over­whelming, they are consistent with expectations for artifacts with gradations in the values that were socially ascribed to them by members of a com­munity, whereby objects may be compared and serve metaphorically for evaluating people in terms of their social affiliation and status (Lesure 1999). Although it is likely that earspools would have been one medium by which the community's inhabi­tants projected and negotiated vertical social rela­tions such as status, it is also possible that identification as to kinship, gender, and age were also evaluated through earspools and other forms of adornment. Nevertheless, the size continuum or

earspools from La Laguna exhibits a relatively nor­mal distribution that does not match neatly with potential gender divisions or age grades. Perhaps a larger sample or the discovery of adornments as mortuary offerings will help refine our categories of social identity in the future. 
Domestic Ritual 
Effigy vessels at La Laguna depicting identifiable precursors to the Old God of Fire (Aztec Huehue­teotl) and Storm God (Aztec Tlaloc) were used in domestic rituals at the site, connecting households to a much larger interaction sphere that generated shared conceptualizations of these deities and the natural and supernatural forces they were associ­ated with (Carballo 2007a). Old God effigy vessels had a clear usage as pedestaled incense burners, but excavations in Area H reveal that the deity was also depicted by figurines with small receptacles on their heads that would not have made very effec­tive incense burners (Figure 9g). His prevalence in domestic contexts at La Laguna and elsewhere in central Mexico demonstrates that the Old God was a preeminent household deity during the Forma­tive, providing a level of religious integration among households. Fragments of at least eight Old God effigies were recovered from Area H and at least one was recovered from Area F. They appear to have been used contemporaneously with, but later supplant, a zoomorphic burner tradition in Puebla-Tlaxcala, which may have been a local ver­sion of a broader Mesoamerican mythological con­nection between opossums and fire (see Lopez Austin 1993; Ramirez 2008). The iconography, media, and depositional contexts of the Storm God were much more varied than the Old God, sug­gesting a more multifaceted role for the Storm God ranging from the household to large-scale cere­monies held at public temple precincts (Barba de Pifia Chan 2002; Carballo 2007a; Garcia Cook 1981). Fragments of at least two Storm God effi­gies were recovered from Area F and at least one was recovered from Area H. 

Effigy incense burners are common in both res­idential areas and do not appear to correspond to household status. However, fine obsidian lancets, likely used for ritual bloodletting, were found exclusively in Area H. All three examples, one of them still complete (Figure 9h), were found in the northern cornerof Structure 14 M-1, where most of the greenstone beads originated as well. While the sample is small, the association between obsidian bloodletters and elite residences is consistent with other areas of Formative highland Mesoamerica (Flannery and Marcus 2005:96). One of the frag­mented examples was broken during production, suggesting that bloodletters were produced in Area 
H. Although a soft touch is required for the deli­cate pressure flaking of such a fine implement on brittle obsidian, the quality of blademaking char­acterized by the debitage from Area F indicates its : residents could have also produced their own lancets. Perhaps only certain individuals living in Area H engaged in auto-sacrifice, due to their social roles in the community, or, alternatively, only they may have been permitted to do so with an obsid­ian lancet, while others made use of widely avail­able maguey thorns. 

House Construction 
Behavioral variability between the two households would appear to have been minor based solely on their associated assemblages. Most important, how­ever, were the physical environments constructed as the settings for household activities and to express and reproduce household status. Landscape modifications in Area H were considerable, includ­ing the artificial flattening of over one hectare of natural hill slope and the construction of a sloping retaining wall (ca. 3 m tall). At least three large structures were built on this newly level surface, the platforms of two primary residences combin­ing for a construction volume of approximately 2500 m3 (Figure lOb ). One of these (Structure l 4M­l) had an earlier incarnation, also of substantial pro­portions and dating from perhaps 150 years earlier. The northern corner of Structure 14M-l-sub was excavated, revealing that it was at least 1.2 m tall and likely also extends to tepetate, which would make it nearly equal in height to the later structure. An earlier version of Structure 14M-2 may also have been built at this time, but excavations there were more limited and did not probe the fill of the platform for substructures. The size of the resi­dences and continued elaboration of the living space demonstrates the multi generational ability of the family in Area H to mobilize large-scale labor projects, consistent with hereditary ranking. By comparison, the family in Area F was also con­cerned with flattening their living surface but

Hirth (1989, 1993b) considered house size and elaboration as the most important axis for deter­mining household status at Xochicalco, augmented and enriched by the consideration of multiple lines of artifact data. The prioritization of residential architecture is further borne out by recent eth­noarchaeological studies that emphasize the formal and stylistic attributes of houses in the reproduc­tion of hierarchies and through serving as settings for interpersonal action that radiates back into community-level politics (Bowser and Patton 2004; Kamp 2000; Lyons 2007). Through his cross­cultural study of houses and household status, Blan­ton ( 1994) isolated two essential in de xi cal qualities of the physical house: (1) size as an authentic indi­cation of wealth, being impossible to fake in tradi­tional societies, and (2) the visual impact of coherent arrangements of decorative motifs. From its elevated position overlooking but easily acces­sible to the ceremonial center of the community, the imposing structures in Area H and their painted geometric motifs would have had a strong visual impact appropriate for one of its ruling families. 
Because the painted walls of the Area H struc­tures were burned in an intensely hot fire, they were preserved as large pieces of impressed daub that

were smoothed and decorated on their exteriors. This Terminal Formative to Early Classic aban­donment provides an additional perspective regard­ing the upheavals of this period in central Mexican prehistory, and the ensuing urban civilization cen­tered at Teotihuacan. The conflagration of Struc­ture 14-1 resulted in meter-deep accumulations of burnt structural collapse in certain areas, and involved temperatures that melted the daub coat­ing thicker posts of the structure into iridescent clumps of vitrified clay. Both strongly suggest intentional burning (Shaffer 1993). Additional lines of evidence are required for assessing whether the destruction was due to internal processes (i.e., the ritual termination of an important family's resi­dence due to community unrest) or external factors (i.e., raiding or warfare, the latter potentially involv­ing Teotihuacan). However, all potential scenarios provide another indication of the importance of the residential complex within the context of the For­mative community at La Laguna. 
Conclusions 
Household practices and status differentiation within a rural community surrounded by early urban centers are reflected in the domestic struc­tures and assemblages from two areas of La Laguna. The most substantial difference is observ­able in the amount of labor involved in the land­scape modifications and large house constructions in Area H. Though the comparative sample pre­sented here is small, the two contexts provide an opportunity to evaluate expectations for variability in practices through assemblages from two remark­ably different forms of residential architecture. Together with the apparently planned conflagration of the structures in Area H, their size and elabora­tion are consistent with having been inhabited by one of the highest ranked families within the com­munity, possibly corresponding to a chiefly lin­eage. The marked contrast in the residences of the two areas would have conspicuously signaled the different statuses of their occupants and likely would have formed a categorical division as stark as the one cited by the sixteenth century Tlaxcalan in the introduction between a "big house" and a ')acal." 
With a formalized ceremonial precinct orga­nized around open public space, and continuity in the location and elaborateness of the residences of chiefly families or similar political agents, the pat­tern of settlement at La Laguna is consistent with expectations for more institutionalized political authority (e.g., Henderson and Ostler 2005). Yet the lack of evidence for strong wealth differences in burials and household assemblages is suggestive of the limits of institutionalized differentiation within the community. Assemblages from Areas F and H illustrate more subtle gradations in the social prac­tices of their inhabitants, and the distributions of'. certain objects may be used to evaluate categories of residential architecture and to enrich our under­standing of activities and identities. Lesure (1999:32) proposes that intrasite patterning of arti­facts relating to social identity may differ between exclusive elite household distributions corre­sponding to vertical (status) social relations, dis­tributional patterning along other lines as indicative of horizontal relations (kin, age, gender, or other dimensions of identity), and a combination that nevertheless favored elite households as a poten­tial mix of vertical and horizontal signals. 

Following these premises, status may be impli­cated at La Laguna more through obsidian lancets for auto-sacrifice and greenstone for personal adornment, whereas shell adornments, earspools, and green obsidian indexed a mix of vertical and horizontal relations. In the case of greenstone, shell, and green obsidian, status would have been expressed primarily through the differential access to desired foreign resources. Obsidian lancets and hollow ceramic earspools were made from mate­rials that were readily available to all households, however, simply as finer or more elaborate ver­sions of objects for which somewhat cheaper alter­natives existed. The inhabitants of Area F were capable of producing bloodletting implements from obsidian blades and proportions of hollow ear­spools similar to those found in Area H, but they may have been impeded by social norms regard­ing the identity of individuals who were deemed appropriate users of such items-not necessarily sumptuary laws, rather, less institutionalized norms of conduct. 
Wealth differences between households do not appear to have been great at La Laguna, but the dif­ferences in their potential social capital do. Elite and commoner households engaged in similar domestic craft activities, consistent with diversified

economic strategies that could buffer against agri­
cultural risk (e.g., Hirth 2006). Yet the elite house­
hold in Area H was more connected to 
long-distance exchange networks that brought 
greenstone, shell, and other materials to the com­
munity than were the lower status inhabitants of 
Area F. It is possible that the community was orga­
nized similarly to Tetimpa, where senior and junior 
houses are proposed to have been interdependent 
but differentiated by their architecture and 
exchange relations (Plunket and Urufiuela 2002; 
Plunket et al. 2005). At the moment, however, archi­
tectural differentiation appears to have been greater 
at La Laguna than at Tetimpa. 
Cross-culturally, "households of a rural periph­
ery elite stand in sharp contrast with poorer house­
holds of the same communities, households that are 
Jess able to participate in the long-distance eco­
nomic strategies of the peripheries" (Blanton 
1994: 189). Blanton's observation fits well with La 
Laguna's domestic areas and regional setting, since 
the community was adjacent to three zones of con­
temporaneous urbanization, located along the most 
important corridor of communication between 
Teotihuacan and points south and east, and its aban­
donment coincides with Teotihuacano political 
expansion through the region (Carballo and Pluck­
hahn 2007). Under these new circumstances, the 
strategies of affiliation and differentiation of elite 
and common households in the region were swept 
into a much larger system centered at Teotihuacan, 
becoming transplanted into the macroregional hier­
archy of the Classic period.

Notes 

I. Urui\uela and Plunket (2007:43-44) discuss a similar burial from Tetimpa in which two crania were oriented facing Popocatepetl when placed within the fill covering the floor of a house. Whereas I interpret the Area F deposit as a potential termination ritual, the context of this Tetimpa burial-which does not include a vessel offering, and was encountered within the matrix of a structure that was purposefully destroyed-is more consistent with violent conflict. 
2. 
The frequency of green obsidian from all contexts in Area H is also more than double that of Area F expressed as pieces per m3 (Area F = .8; Area H = 1 .9). 

3. 
A feature excavated during the 2004 test excavations in Area H contained a dense concentration of basaltic/felsic flakes with diagnostic attributes of edge preparation associ­ated with the production of trapezoidal maguey scrapers. Although not included in this study, the feature dates to the earlier occupation, centuries prior to the large residences, and does not affect the interpretation that the inhabitants of Area F were producing more of these tools than those of Area H during the later occupation associated with the structures dis­cussed here. 

4. 
Material types were assessed visually informed by vis­its to sources and compositional studies (Carballo 2006; Carballo et al. 2007). Pared6n blade size was particularly large in a feature dug into the platform in Area H (Structure 14M-l), with a mean width of 1.68 cm (n = 133; s = .36).
