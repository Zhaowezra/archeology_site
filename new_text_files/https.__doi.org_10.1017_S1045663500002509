MAYA MARINE SUBSISTENCE: ISOTOPIC EVIDENCE FROM MARCO 

GONZALEZ AND SAN PEDRO, BELIZE 
Jocelyn S. Williams, Christine D. White, and Fred J. Longstaffe 
This article presents stable nitrogen and carbon isotopic analyses of diet at the Maya sites of Marco Gonzalez and San Pedro, Belize. This study, which provides important insight into social organization, trade, and subsistence economy for the Postclassic and Historic periods (ca. A.D. 900-1650), also expands our understanding of the distribution of stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes within coral reef food webs off coastal Belize. Marco Gonzalez and San Pedro represent the first doc­umented ancient Maya populations whose diet consisted mestly of marine resources with a minimal reliance upon maize. Although these sites do not appear highly stratified, and there are no dietary differences between sexes or status, the inhab­itants of Marco Gonzale;: incorporated more mainland-terrestrial animals and maize into their diet than the people of San Pedro. This finding supports the postulated roles of these two settlements, where Marco Gonzalez had trade ties to the main­land site of lamanai and San Pedro was a small fishing village. 
Este articulo presenta andlisis isot6picos de nitr6geno y carbono estables de la dieta en los emplazamientos mayas de Marco Gonzalez y San Pedro, en Be lice. Este estudio, que provee una importante comprensi6n de la organizaci6n social, comercio y economia de subsistencia en los periodos Poscldsico e Hist6rico (alrededorde los aiios d.C. 900-1650), tambien expande nue­stro entendimiento de la distribuci6n de los is6topos estables de carbono y nitr6geno dentro de las cadenas alimenticias mari­nas y de arrecifes en la costa de Be/ice. Marco Gonzalez y San Pedro representan las primeras poblaciones mayas antiguas documentadas cuya dieta consistia en su mayoria de recursos marinas, con una minima dependencia del mafz. Aunque estas sitios no parecen ser altamente estrati.ficadas, y no muestran diferencias dieteticas entre sexos o posici6n social, Los habitantes de Marco Gonzalez inco.rporaron mas animales terrestres ylo maiz en sus dietas que la gente de San Pedro. Este hallazgo apoya los roles postulados para estos dos asentamientos, en que Marco Gonzalez ten[a vinculos con el sitio de tierra adentro de lamanai y San Pedro era una pequeiia villa de pescadores.

include increased long-distance exchange (espe­cially with central Mexico, Yucatan), diversity in trade goods (with elite goods becoming com­modities), a more commercialized economy, new forms of pictorial writing and iconography, and new stylistic interactions between regions (specifi­cally with central Mexico) (Guderjan l 995a; Smith and Berdan 2000). Settlement patterns also changed following the Classic period. For exam­ple, we see the expansion and founding of thriving centers in areas located near rivers, lagoons, cenotes, and the ocean (Masson 1999; Pendergast 1986; Rice et al. 1998). Settlement patterns on Ambergris Cay, Belize, provide an example of this shift (Guderjan and Garber 1995b). 
Ambergris Cay is an island located off the coast of Belize in the Caribbean Sea (Figure 1). It is flanked by an offshore reef on the east/windward side. Chetumal Bay, on the west/leeward side, is fed by the Rio Hondo and New River (Guderjan 1995a). Twenty-two prehistoric sites have been located on Ambergris Cay spanning the Late Pre­classic to Historic periods (ca. 300 B.C.-A.D. 1650 [Guderjan 1995a; Pendergast and Graham 1991]). Location on the island appears to have played a role in determining the function and layout of the sites. In general, sites on the leeward side exhibit formal architecture and are larger than sites on the wind­ward side. This likely reflects the fact that leeward sites had direct access to natural or man-made har-

hors and were easily reached by canoes traveling 
down the coast (Guderjan 1995b). Based on the 
presence of exotic goods, elaborate burials, formal 
architecture, and natural and man-made ports, lee­
wardsites appear to have been inhabited by lineages 
with important roles in regulating and overseeing 
maritime trade. In contrast, the majority of wind­
ward sites have few to no exotic goods or grave 
offerings and little, if any, evidence of formal archi­
tecture. They were seemingly cut off from the trade 
networks and likely represent simple fishing com­
munities (Guderjan l 995b ). 
Marco Gonzalez and San Pedro are two ancient 
Maya sites located on Ambergris Cay (Figure 2). 
Marco Gonzalez is the southernmost settlement on 
the leeward side and dates from the Late Preclas­
sic to the Late Postclassic period (100 B.C.-A.D. 
1350 [Graham and Pendergast 1989]). San Pedro 
is on the windward side of the southern part of 
Ambergris Cay and dates from the Terminal Post­
classic to the Historic period (A.D. 1400-1650 
[Graham and Pendergast 1989; Pendergast and 
Graham 1991]). Archaeological excavations indi­
cate that San Pedro was a small fishing village with 
no fonnal (i.e., public/monumental) architecture 
(Graham and Pendergast 1994; Pendergast and 
Graham1991), in keeping with Guderjan's (1995c) 
findings where, in general, windward sites were less 
involved in the control of maritime trade. Artifacts 
from Marco Gonzalez reveal extensive trade links 
with other distant locations, such as green obsid­
ian from central Mexico, gray and black obsidian 
from highland Guatemala, slate ware pottery from 
the Yucatan, and plumbate ware and a button face jar from Guatemala and/or El Salvador (Graham and Pendergast 1987; Pendergast and Graham 1990). Excavations at Marco Gonzalez also uncov­ered formal architecture and elaborate burials (Gra­ham and Pendergast 1987, 1989; Pendergast and Graham 1987) indicating that this settlement rep­resents much more than a small, isolated fishing village. 
There is extensive ceramic evidence connecting Marco Gonzalez to the inland ceremonial center of Lamanai (Figure 1). Apart from Lamanai, Marco Gonzalez is one of few sources of ceramics dating to the Buk phase, A.D. 1140-1300, and in some contexts the amount of Buk phase ceramics per cubic meter at Marco Gonzalez is greater than that found in Lamanai (Graham and Pendergast 1989). 
Lamanai is located along a lagoon, fed by the New River, which in tum runs to Chetumal Bay just northwest of Ambergris Cay. The New River would have acted as a "canoe highway" linking the two sites and facilitating a flourishing trade relationship (similar to the situation at Blue Creek on the Rio Hondo [Barrett and Guderjan 2006]). Salt pro­cessing occurred during the Classic period (ca. A.D. 600-800) at Marco Gonzalez. Salt would have been a valuable export and also may have been used to preserve fish for travel inland (McKillop 1995). Stable isotope analyses from Lamanai indicate that marine foods were an important dietary component at that site (Coyston et al. 1999; White and Schwarcz 1989). Marco Gonzalez had a strategic overview of maritime traffic destined for the Caribbean Sea and for the mouths of water systems such as the Rio Hondo and New River (Graham and Pendergast 1989). The ceramics, exotic goods, elaborate burials, formal architecture, salt pro­cessing, and geographical location on the Belizean coast all support the inference that Marco Gonza­lez played an important role in maritime trade, per­haps as a gatekeeper (Graham 1989; Graham and Pendergast 1989; Guderjan et al. 1989; Hammond 1976). Based on the abundance ofLamanai ceram­ics, Graham and Pendergast ( 1989) postulate that Marco Gonzalez may have functioned as Lamanai's ancient port. 
In highly stratified ancient Maya society, diet played an important role in social organization (Chase and Chase, eds. 1992; Pohl 1985; Shaw 1999; White 1999; White et al. 2001; Whittington and Reed 1999). Faunal, isotopic, and ethnohistoric data indicate that patterns of consumption differed between elites and other classes and that certain foods may have been used to maintain and solid­ify social divisions (Emery 2002; Lecount 2001; Pohl 1985; Scherer et al. 2007; White et al. 2001; Whittington and Reed 1999). Because rare, trade, or imported food items had more social value, their consumption was often restricted to the elites. These include marine products and foods. For example, isotopic evidence indicates the con­sumption of marine/reef resources among elites as early as the Preclassic (Powis et al. I 999). 
In this article, we present the results of stable isotope analyses of ancient Maya diet at the fish­ing village of San Pedro and the trade center of Marco Gonzalez. The purpose of this research was

to investigate diet and its relationship to social and political variables (e.g., status, gender, trade). If, during the period following the collapse, elite foods did indeed become readily accessible to common­ers and if social divisions were also diminished, then we should be able to detect this isotopically. The saline soils of Ambergris Cay were not suit­able for the cultivation of maize (Guderjan and Garber 1995b ). Therefore, if maize were part of the diet it would have been imported, perhaps from Lamanai. Marco Gonzalez and San Pedro are the only two island Maya sites that survived into the Postclassic and Historic time periods and for which stable isotope data are available. The information provided by this analysis about social organization and trade expands our understanding of the Maya in this region following the Classic period collapse and during the Postclassic/Historic transition. 
Theoretical Principles 
The relative abundances of stable carbon or nitro­gen isotopes in a substance are determined by mea­suring the ratio of 13C/12C or 15N/14N (i.e., Rsample) relative to the isotope ratio of a standard reference material (i.e., Rstanctard). The comparison of these ratios is expressed using the delta (o) notation and reported in per mill (%0): o = ([Rsample -Rstanctarct1 I Rstandarct). The standard for carbon is Vienna-Pee Dee belemnite, calibrated using NBS-19 (Coplen 1994), and for nitrogen it is atmospheric N2 (air). 
Plants can be categorized as C, C4, and CAM 
3
(Crassulacean acid metabolism) based on different photosynthetic pathways, which produce distinc­tive carbon isotope ratios. The average o13C value for Cplants is -26.0%0 (Deines 1980:335), with a 
3 
range from -34.0 to -22.0%0 (Vogel 1980:6). C3 
plants include wheat, rice, trees, montane and wet­land grasses, all root crops, legumes, vegetables, nuts, honey, and most fruits (compiled from numer­ous sources, reviewed in O'Leary 1981). The aver­age o13C value for C4 plants is -13.0%0 (Deines 1980:335), with a range from -16.0 to -9.0%0 (Smith and Epstein 1971 :380). C4 plants include sorghum, millets, maize, sugarcane, some ama­ranths, chenopods, and tropical pasture grasses (compiled from numerous sources, reviewed in O'Leary 1981). Theo13C values of CAM plants are variable and encompass the range of both C4 and C3 plants. In general, CAM plants are not a dietary staple in most cultures, including the Maya (White and Schwarcz 1989). Most marine plants follow the Cphotosynthetic pathway, but there are some
3 
important marine plants (sea grass and plankton) whose o 13C values are within the range of C4 plants (Ambrose 1993; Keeley and Sandquist 1992; Schoeninger and Moore 1992; Smith and Walker 1980). Because marine plants preferentially incor­porate HC0-, which is more abundant in seawa­
3 
ter relative to dissolved C02 and is also enriched in 13C relative to terrestrial C02 ( +2.0%o vs. -8.0%0), marine and terrestrial Cplants can differ 
3 
in their o13C values by as much as 10.0%0. 
Carbon derived from plants undergoes isotopic fractionation during metabolism and is incorpo­rated into the tissues of higher-order consumers. The amount of carbon isotopic enrichment between the diet and tissue (Adiet-tissue) varies among tissues (DeNiro and Epstein 1978, 1981; Tieszen et al. 1983; Vogel 1978). The isotopic enrichment between diet and human bone collagen (Actiet-coil is generally accepted to be +5.0%o (van der Merwe and Vogel 1978) but can vary (for a review, see Ambrose 1993). An enrichment of approximately 
+l .0%0 occurs between trophic levels (positions in the food chain). Plants form the lowest trophic level, followed by primary consumers (herbivores) and then secondary consumers (omnivores, carnivores). Because there are so many trophic levels (e.g., pri­mary, secondary, tertiary consumers) in marine food webs, this enrichment is especially pro­nounced in marine environments (Ambrose et al. 1997; Schoeninger and Moore 1992). 
Nitrogen isotope ratios differ between marine (mean o15N = +7.0%0) and terrestrial (mean o15N = 
+9.0%0) plants (Wada 1980; Wada et al. 1975) because of differences in source nitrogen. A step­wise isotopic enrichment (Actiet-tissue) of 3.0-4.0%0 in o15N values between trophic levels in both ter­restrial and marine ecosystems has been well estab­lished (DeNiro and Epstein 1981; Minagawa and Wada 1984) but varies under some circumstances (see Ambrose and DeNiro 1986, 1989; Hedges and Reynard 2007; McCutchan et al. 2003; Post 2002). Because marine plants have o13C values within the range of terrestrial C4 plants, nitrogen isotope analyses are essential in order to determine dietary components when individuals are consuming C4 resources (such as maize) and/or marine foods (plants and/or animals) (Chisholm et al. l 983b; 
Downloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core. YBP Library Services, on 22 Aug 2018 at 17:36:38, subject to the Cambridge Core terms of use, available at https://www.cambridge.org/core/terms. https://doi.org/10.1017/S1045663500002509 
Walker and DeNiro 1986). 
An additional line of evidence used to determine 
relative dietary components is the combined analy­
sis of the organic (collagen) and inorganic 
(hydroxyapatite) components of bone. Collagen is 
a protein formed by amino acids, some of which 
can only be obtained directly from diet (essential 
amino acids) and some that are synthesized from 
biochemical precursors (nonessential amino acids). 
Ingested proteins are broken down into amino acids 
by enzymes in the gut, absorbed from the intestine 
(Schwarcz 2000), and directed to growing tissues 
by the blood. Because bone collagen is synthesized 
from the amino acids in ingested protein, the car­
bon isotopic composition of this tissue will pref­
erentially reflect the protein component of the diet 
(Ambrose and Norr 1993; Chisholm 1982; 
Chisholm et al. l 983a; Schwarcz 1991, 2000; 
Tieszen and Fagre 1993; Tykot et al. 1996). How­
ever, under conditions of insufficient protein intake 
nonessential amino acids will be synthesized from 
carbohydrate sources and bone collagen will reflect 
carbohydrate and protein sources (Kennedy 1988). 
Given the rich marine environment of Ambergris 
Cay, however, we can assume that dietary protein 
alone was adequate for collagen maintenance and 
growth. 
The inorganic component of bone is calcium phosphate crystallized as hydroxyapatite (termed "structural carbonate"). The ingested carbon from all macronutrients is respired as co2' which is car­ried by blood to the lungs and is in isotopic equi­librium with blood bicarbonate (HC03-). The B13C composition of structural carbonate is derived from blood bicarbonate. As such, carbon isotopic values of structural carbonate will reflect a weighted aver­age of all the macronutrients consumed ( carbohy­drate, lipid, and protein) (Ambrose and Norr 1993; Jim et al. 2004; Kellner and Schoeninger 2007; Krueger and Sullivan 1984; Lee-Thorp et al. 1989; Schwarcz 2000; Tieszen and Fagre 1993; Tykot et al. 1996). 
Based on controlled feeding experiments, it appears that collagen primarily reflects the protein component of the diet and structural carbonate reflects the whole diet (Ambrose and Norr 1993; Tieszen and Fagre 1993). Since these two compo­nents of bone reflect different dietary components, the difference in B13C values (commonly termed "spacing") between the two tissues (Li 13Csc-coJ) can be used as an indicator of the relative importance of meat in the diet (Lee-Thorp et al. 1989; but see Kellner and Schoeninger 2007). Lee-Thorp and colleagues (1989) found experimentally that the value of Li 13Csc _col for herbivores, omnivores, and carnivores was 6.8 ± 1.4%0, 5.2 ± .8%0, and 4.3 ± 1.0%0, respectively, although Hedges (2003) argues that this is not solely a reflection of dietary differ­ences. In marine environments, the values of Li13Csc _ col can be even smaller than for purely carnivo­rous terrestrial food webs (Lee-Thorp et al. 1989; Parkington 1991; White et al. 2001; Yesner et al. 2003). 
Site and Sample Description 
Ambergris Cay is 39 km long and is no wider than 4 km at any point (Glassman and Garber 1999; Gud­erjan and Garber 1995a; Figure 2). A barrier reef begins 160 m off the shore. The water within this reef is typically 3 to 7 m deep (Glassman and Gar­ber 1999; Guderjan and Garber 1995a). The west side of Ambergris Cay is bordered to the north by Chetumal Bay, which spans the 40 km to mainland Belize (Figure 1 ). Ambergris Cay is not a natural island. In the past, it was part of the same limestone shelf that forms the Xcalac Peninsula of Quintana Roo to the north in Mexico (Glassman and Garber 1999; Guderjan and Garber l 995b ). Sometime around A.D. 600 or earlier, the Maya built a canal (the Boca Bacalar Chico passage) through the lime­stone shelf to form an "island" (Guderjan 1995c) and facilitate canoe travel between the Yucatan coast and Chetumal Bay (Figure 2). 
Marco Gonzalez was excavated from 1986 to 1990 under the supervision of Elizabeth Graham and David Pendergast from the Department of New World Archaeology at the Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto. Although it is not yet possible to com­pletely reconstruct the past environment of Marco Gonzalez, it is known that over the last 2,000 years the sea level has risen approximately 60 cm and there has been an accretion of sediments along this side of the cay (Graham 1989). From the Late Pre­classic to the Late Postclassic periods, the living area of Marco Gonzalez was much larger, and the site was open to sea breezes and protected by a nar­rower beachfront (Graham and Pendergast 1989; Pendergast and Graham 1987). The 6.6-ha site con­tains at least 49 structures, which are all compara-

tively low platforms ranging in height from 30 cm to 4.2 m (Graham and Pendergast 1989) and were constructed from shells (queen conch and West Indian chank mostly, with some emperor helmet, brown conch, princess venus, tellins, chiones, and donax), irregular blocks of reefs tone (made of dead coral), and midden refuse. 
San Pedro was excavated by the same team from 1990 to 1993. Numerous human burials, most with no grave offerings, were found beneath house floors. No monumental architecture was discovered, only simple plastered floors (Graham and Pendergast 1994). Artifacts recovered from the excavation of middens include few to no exotic goods (lithics, a basalt mano, a piece of jade, pottery) (Guderjan I 995a; Pendergast and Graham 199 1 ). 
Skeletal Sample 
The Marco Gonzalez isotopic sample comprises 38 individuals: 28 adults (with a similar number of males and females [ratio of l: 1.3]) and 10 subadults (Table I). Individuals were found beneath structures 11, 12, 18, and 14, as indicated by the burial code (e.g., 14/24a represents structure 14, burial 24a; Table I). Structure 14 has been referred to as a high-status residence because many of its graves con­tained rich offerings of jaguar teeth, obsidian, pot­tery, and beads (Pendergast and Graham 1990:2). 

Structures 12, 18, and 14 were concentrated around the central plaza. Structure 11 was on the southern periphery of the central plaza. Five individuals were not specifically associated with a structure (and were designated by lot numbers rather than struc­ture numbers), nor did they have grave offerings. These individuals were included as examples of less elite or none lite individuals. It can be expected, based on the general pattern of burials at Marco Gonzalez, that individuals of higher status would be buried beneath the floors of structures (Pender­gast and Graham 199 1) and nonelites would be buried elsewhere. We cannot guarantee, however, that there were not some nonelite individuals included in structure 14 buiials. 


The San Pedro isotopic sample comprises 29 individuals: 20 adults (with a similar number of males and females [ratio of 1:.9]) and nine subadults (Table 1). Burials were mostly found beneath the floors of domestic structures (Pender­gast and Graham 1991). At present, it is not possi­ble to securely assign the individuals to discrete time periods within the period A.D. 1400--1650. It is also not possible to infer the status of the indi­viduals making up the San Pedro sample. If San Pedro was indeed a simple fishing village, as arti­factual evidence and grave offerings indicate, then it is likely that these skeletons represent individu­als of similar lower status. Age at death was assigned to individual human skeletal remains using the standards outlined in Buikstra and Ube­laker (1994). 
Fauna! Remains 
The faunal samples are from a midden at Marco Gonzalez (structure 27, level 21) dating to the Buk phase of the Postclassic (A.D. 1000-1200). Given their proximity, we assume that the two sites shared the same food web. The Buk phase corresponds well to the majority of the Marco Gonzalez skele­tal sample. Genus and, in some cases, species were assigned by Norbert Stanchly and Kevin Seymour of the Royal Ontario Museum. All species identi­fied from this midden, excluding those for which there was insufficient bone for isotopic analysis, are included in the fauna sample (Table 2).

Methods 
Bone collagen was prepared using the modified Longin method (Chisholm et al. l 983b; DeNiro and Epstein 1978; Longin 1971 ). Structural carbonate was prepared following Lee-Thorp and van der Merwe ( 1991 ). The preservation of bone collagen was assessed using the carbon/nitrogen (C/N) ratio and collagen yield (Table 1 ). The acceptable range of C/N ratios for archaeological bone is 2.9-3.6 (DeNiro 1985). The minimum acceptable collagen yield is 1 percent (Van Klinken 1999). The preser­vation of bone structural carbonate was assessed using its C02 yield, crystallinity index (Cl), and car­bonate to phosphate (C/P) ratio (Table 1). The acceptable range of C02 yields for unaltered sam­ples is >.6 to <1.3 percent (Ambrose 1990). The acceptable range for the CI of modern bone is 2.8-4.0 (Wright and Schwarcz 1996). The accept­able range of C/P ratios for unaltered samples is .15-.30 (Wright and Schwarcz 1996). 
To examine possible relationships between dia­genesis and isotopic composition, 8 values were tested for significant correlations with values from each of the diagenetic indicators (Williams 2000). Samples that caused a statistically significant (p < .05) correlation were excluded. Consequently, one human (MG 14/7c; Table I) and five fauna! sam­ples were eliminated (Table 2). The statistical pack­age SPSS was used for all statistical analyses, and significant values are reported to a P value of less than .05 unless otherwise specified. For samples that were normally distributed, parametric statis­tics (e.g., unpaired t-test, ANOVA, and Pearson's r) were used. For small samples that were not nor­mally distributed, the nonparametric Mann Whit­ney U (reported as U) was used to compare samples. 

The stable isotope composition of 26 fauna! samples from Marco Gonzalez (Table 2) was used to construct a model (i.e., food web) of the iso­topic variability in locally available foods. Four faunal classes are represented in these data: Oste­ichthyes, Chondrichthyes, Reptilia, and Mam-

Figure 3. Foodweb for Ambergris Cay. Data from Williams (2000) and Keegan and DeNiro (1988) are corrected to rep­resent meat, as described in text. The isotope data for the human bone collagen (not corrected to diet) are represented within ovals MG = Marco Gonzalez, SP = San Pedro. 
to reflect meat (described below), are summarized in Table 3. The 815N (F =3.23; df =3, 17; p < .05) and Li13Csc-col (F= 31.8; df =3, 17;p < .001) val­ues between classes of fauna differed significantly, demonstrating origins from numerous trophic lev­els. The highest 815N values are found in species such as jackfish, pompano, and shark/ray (inshore, offshore, reef fish), and the lowest, in marine inver­tebrates and decapods and deer, turtle, and iguana (Figure 3, Table 2). The most carnivorous species (indicated by low Li 13Csc-col values) are the fish, for example, barracuda and jackfish (Figure 4, Table 2). The least carnivorous species (indicated by a higher Li13Csc _cot values) are deer and amphibians, for example, iguana, turtle, and crocodile (Figure 4, Table 2). There are also significant differences in the 813Ccot (F = 114.85; df = 3, 17; p < .001) and 813CscCF=52.23;df= 3, l 7;p< .001) values among the various classes of fauna. This result is expected since terrestrial, riverine, and marine animals all use carbon sources with distinct 13C/1 2C ratios. 
Since the faunal sample from Marco Gonzalez does not include decapods, marine invertebrates, or plants, their 813Ccot and 815N values have been added from other sites within the Caribbean Sea (Keegan and DeNiro 1988) to reconstruct the food web. Although most of Keegan and DeNiro's (1988)sample consists of prehistoric species, some of it is modem. Because the burning of fossil fuels since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution has added C02 to the atmosphere, resulting in lower o13C values of atmospheric C02 (Marino and McElroy 1991), all o13C values for modem sam­ples were increased by l .5%o. 
Because most of the isotopic data for Marco Gonzalez fauna and much of Keegan and DeNiro's (1988) sample come from bone rather than meat (the tissue consumed by humans), the o values were adjusted to reflect the isotopic composition of the meat. The fractionation between meat and bone collagen is -3.7 ± .7%o for carbon and + 1.7 ± .7%o for nitrogen (DeNiro and Epstein 1978, 1981; van der Merwe 1982). The carbon isotope fractionation between meat and structural carbonate is -7.0 ± l .0%o (Lee-Thorp et al. 1989). The crabs described by Keegan and DeNiro (1988) represent chitin and not meat. The isotopic fractionation between chitin and meat is -2.4 ± .5%o for carbon and + 10.0 ± 2.7%o for nitrogen (Schimmelmann 1985). 
Humans 
There are statistically significant differences in the isotopic composition of tissues between San Pedro and Marco Gonzalez: o13Ccot: t = -3.566, df =64, p < .001; o13C,c: t = -6.767, df = 64, p < .001; Li13Csc-cot: t =-3.655, df = 64,p < .001; and o15N: t = 2.278, df = 64, p < .05 (isotope data are sum­marized in Table 4).As expected, o 13Csc and o 13C001 values are related (r=.690; df:= 66; p < .001; Fig­ure 5) and indicate a shared source of carbon

Discussion 
The reconstructed food web illustrates the isotopic composition of the various food choices at Amber­gris Cay (Figure 3) and provides an important base­line for the analysis of human diets within that particular environment. The most prominent fea­ture of the food web is that the majority of resources are enriched in 13C. This includes plants using the C4 photosynthetic pathway, marine plants using HC03 -(which is enriched in 13C relative to terres­trial plants), and animals consuming these plants . It is further characterized by the following features: 
(1) terrestrial food sources such as deer, tubers, and land crabs have 813C values that are depleted of 13C relative to marine resources; (2) the 813C values for riverine and terrestrial reptiles are shifted toward

Reef, inshore, offshore, and riverine species are represented in the faunal sample, which indicates the exploitation of a variety of environmental zones. Both San Pedro and Marco Gonzalez were located beside lagoons, with easy access to the barrier reef and open waters off the coast of Ambergris Cay. Many of the offshore and some inshore species lived in areas that would have necessitated the use of canoes that were large enough to fish, transport the catch (including sharks), and withstand rough offshore waters. Additionally, the different species must have been caught using a variety of methods,

swamps, so it is doubtful that it was actually culti­vated on Ambergris Cay (Guderjan and Garber 1995b). Furthermore, archaeological evidence for maize-processing tools (manos and metates) is sparse (E. Graham, personal communication 1999). It is, therefore, assumed that if maize were an important part of the island diet, it would need to have been imported from the mainland. The pres­ence of C4-like foods in the diet more likely came from marine resources, for which there is both archaeological and ethnohistoric evidence of exploitation off the Belize coast and in the Yucatan (Ball and Eaton 1972; Landa 1941 ; Norr 1991 ). 
The o13Ccot values indicate that the inhabitants of Marco Gonzalez consumed more proteins depleted of 13C relative to San Pedro. These could include marine decapods, inshore/offshore reef/estuarine fish, and terrestrial fauna (e.g., deer, reptiles). Since marine decapods are depleted of 15N relative to other protein sources (Table 3, Figure 3) and the average o15N at Marco Gonzalez is greater than at San Pedro, differential consumption of this food is not a plausible explanation for differences in o13CcoI· As a group, inshore fish are depleted of 13C and enriched in 15N relative to reef/estuarine and offshore fish (Figure 3), and it is possible that San Pedro consumed more reef/estuarine and off­shore fish relative to Marco Gonzalez. However, given that both sites were located within similar habitats, this seems unlikely. Archaeological, geo­graphical, and isotope data from Lamanai provide strong evidence for trade ties between Marco Gon­zalez and the mainland; as such, the consumption of imported deer meat at Marco Gonzalez seems a plausible explanation for the differences in carbon and nitrogen isotope values between the sites. The limited grazing land area on the island makes it unlikely that there was a local deer population, but deer were plentiful at Lamanai (Emery 1999) and may have been a trade commodity. In exchange for deer meat and possibly maize, marine species may have been exported to Lamanai, especially fol­lowing the Terminal Classic period, when both fau­n al and isotopic analyses indicate a shift to increasing reliance on marine foods. 
The o13Csc values confirm that the whole diet, not just protein sources, differed between the sites. The low A 13Csc-cot values indicate that the protein component of the diet at both sites was derived pri­marily from marine sources, consistent with val­ues of l-2%o found for marine diets elsewhere (Lee-Thorp et al. 1989; Parkington 1991 ). A very small spacing between structural carbonate and collagen o13C values reflects the unique combina­tion of macro nutrients in marine diets, where high­protein foods (e.g., fish) are enriched in 13C relative to lipids and terrestrial carbohydrates (Hedges and Van Klinken 2000; Lee-Thorp et al. 1989; Schwarcz 2000). Because the o13Csc-coI values for both sites are so small, maize could not have been a staple at either site. 
There is a much stronger relationship between 

o 13Csc _col and o 13C,c than between o 13Csc _col and o13Ccoi (Figure 5). Consequently, a decrease in the o13Csc _cot values is due primarily to the nonmeat components of the diet (lipid and carbohydrate). Both lipids and carbohydrates are depleted of 13C relative to proteins (Vogel 1978); as such, increased terrestrial carbohydrate (e.g., maize) or fat (e.g., deer) consumption would lower the o13Csc values, thereby lowering the o13Csc -coJ· This follows Lee­Thorp and colleagues, who suggest that the extremely low o13Csc _cot values associated with marine diets reflect a "dietary combination of iso­topically enriched proteins and depleted lipids and/or terrestrial carbohydrates'' (1989:593). We can conclude, based on all isotopic measures, that the diet at Marco Gonzalez and San Pedro was based primarily on marine proteins; however, some inhabitants of Marco Gonzalez may also have con­sumed terrestrial food sources such as deer and maize that were likely imported from the mainland. By contrast, the isotopic analysis of diet at San Pedro seems to corroborate Guderjan's (l 995a) suggestion that sites on the windward side of Ambergris Cay, such as San Pedro, were simple fishing villages because the majority of their diet represents marine foods. 
The nitrogen isotopic composition of marine foods off the Caribbean coast of Ambergris Cay is not as enriched in 15N as one would expect for marine food webs (e.g., Ambrose et al. 1997). Con­sequently, the average nitrogen isotopic composi­tion of deer is actually enriched in 15N relative to the average value for reef and estuarine fish (Table 3). Based on nitrogen isotope analysis alone, it would have been difficult to distinguish differences in the subsistence base between Lamanai and Marco Gonzalez. However, o13Ccol and A13Csc -col values indicate that marine foods were a staple at

although within the carnivorous range, are not as small as we would expect for marine food depen­dence. Similarly, the o 13CcoI values indicate a greater reliance on proteins depleted of 13C (e.g., deer) relative to Marco Gonzalez. Although the iso­tope data from Lamanai consistently indicate the incorporation of some marine foods (possibly off­shore, reef, and estuarine fish), they would have been a minor component of the diet, much in the same way that maize and/or deer were at Marco Gonzalez. 
During earlier time periods, dietary differences between males and females are found at other sites, including Altun Ha (White et al. 2001), Pacbitun (White et al. 1993), Copan (Reed 1999; Whitting­ton and Reed 1999), and those reviewed by White (2005). Males consumed significantly more animal protein from higher trophic levels (e.g., inshore and offshore fish) relative to females. For all other iso­topic measures of diet, there were no significant sex differences at Marco Gonzalez. For San Pedro there were no significant differences in the isotopic mea­sures of diet between the sexes. Similarly there were no sex differences at Postclassic Lamanai (Coyston et al. 1999; White and Schwarcz 1989; White et al. 1994 ). These results support the hypothesis that there may have been fewer social divisions from the Postclassic onward (Aimers 2004; Smith and Berdan 2000). 
There is evidence for status differences in diet at several other Maya sites (e.g., Lamanai [Coys­ton et al. 1999; White et al. 1994], Pacbitun [White et al. 1993], Copan [Beaubien 2004; Reed 1999; Whittington and Reed 1999], Altun Ha [White et al. 2001], Tikal [Moholy-Nagy 2004], Caracol [Teeter 2004], and Late Classic period sites in Guatemala [Scherer et al. 2007; Wright 1997]). If we use burial location (core vs. periphery) and grave offerings as indicators of status (Carr 1995; Chase 1992; Chase and Chase 1992; McHugh 1999; Pendergast 1992; Ruz 1965), differences do exist within Marco Gonzalez for whole diet (o 13C5c) but not by protein source or level of camivory. We acknowledge that the use of these variables as sta­tus indicators (particularly the core-periphery dis­tinction) may be problematic. Although the assumption that our groupings represent socioeco­nomic differences requires greater substantiation, 
we argue that the lack of significant dietary differ­ences for o13Cco" o13Csc-co' or o15N values sup­

from that at Marco Gonzalez. The enrichment of o13C for both structural carbonate and collagen reflects a greater reliance on marine plants and ani­mals at San Pedro. The isotope data from Marco Gonzalez are consistent with the consumption of some terrestrial animals (e.g., deer) and maize, which were likely acquired through trade with the mainland. The o13Csc-col values for San Pedro were larger than for Marco Gonzalez, which appears to be related to differences in the macronutrient com­position of the marine diet, where Marco Gonza­lez diets were higher in lipids and/or carbohydrates from terrestrial sources (e.g., maize and deer) and San Pedro diets contained few macronutrients from nonmarine sources. The average o15N value at Marco Gonzalez is 1.1 %0 higher than at San Pedro, indicating that the inhabitants of both sites were consuming animals from a similar variety of trophic levels. 
Although the incorporation of some terrestrial foods at Marco Gonzalez suggests trade ties with the mainland, the main resource base at both Marco Gonzalez and San Pedro was the sea. Species from a variety of marine ecosystems are represented in the fauna! assemblage, which indicates the exploita­tion of various environments (rivers, lagoons, bay) using specific technologies (canoes, hooks, spears, nets, etc.). 
The dietary evidence provided by the stable iso­topic data from Marco Gonzalez and San Pedro enhances our ability to comment upon the lives of the ancient Maya during the Postclassic period and further demonstrates the significance of regional variability in maize consumption as a hallmark of ancient Maya diets (Mansell et al. 2006; Tykot 2002; White 1999; Wright 2006). Although their overall isotopic composition reflects a similar basic subsistence economy, the two sites have distinct isotope ratios. This finding supports the archaeo­logical evidence for different political economies and trade relationships between these sites and the

mainland. The intrasite isotope data indicate that males and females had similar diets. lntrasite iso­tope data for Marco Gonzalez, although we acknowledge its limitations, indicate that elite and nonelite had similar diets. Together these data sup­port the idea of a general trend of diminishing social stratification from the Postclassic onward. San Pedro and Marco Gonzalez manifest the heaviest marine consumption of any Maya site yet analyzed. Maize, often assumed to be the dietary staple of the Maya, did not form the dominant portion of the diet at either of these sites.
