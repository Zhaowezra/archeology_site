THE USE OF FIREWOOD IN ANCIENT MAYA FUNERARY RITUALS: 
A CASE STUDY FROM RIO BEC (CAMPECHE, MEXICO) 

Lydie Dussol, Michelle Elliott, Gregory Pereira, and Dominique Michelet 
In this paper, we examine wood charcoal assemblages that were recovered from ash layers in Terminal Classic (A.D. 800­950) burials at the Maya site of Rfo Bee to understand the use of fuel wood in funerary rites. Compared to charcoal deposits from domestic and non-funerary contexts, the spectrum of wood taxa used in the burial deposits is unique, which suggests specific fire-related practices. Members of the Sapotaceae family and Cordia sp. dominated all contexts and were clearly primary fuels. In contrast, the use of pine ( Pinus sp.), which does not grow locally today, was limited to ritual practices. In addition, it seems that a deliberate effort was made to maximize the taxonomic richness of the fuel wood used in burials. Funerary charcoal deposits appear to have been carefully and intentionally "composed" for burning during funerary rites. We propose that this practice materialized the relationship between fire, ash, and the cycles of life and death, which are often symbolized by plant life cycles in the worldview of ancient Maya societies. This study also emphasizes the contribution of anthracological (wood charcoal) analysis to the reconstruction of human behavior and the importance of systematic 
paleoethnobotanical sampling in funerary contexts .

Roman cremation practices in Europe to under­stand issues of wood supply and selection for fu­nerary pyres, both as fuel and as construction ma­terial (Deforce and Haneca 2012; Fabre et al. 2003; Figueira! et al. 2010; Jansen et al. 2013; Moskal-de! Hoyo 2012; among others). Other re­searchers have studied the symbolic meaning of fires in funerary rituals (e.g., Beauclair et al. 2009; Scheel-Ybert et al. 2014). In contrast, studies in the Maya area have identified wood charcoal from funerary contexts (e.g., Copan, Honduras [Lentz 1991:Table 1), Actun Nak Beh [Morehart 201l:Table 5.13] and Pook's Hill, Belize [More­hart 2011:107], and Tikal, Guatemala [Pudzisz et al. 2004]), but no research has been conducted to date to clarify the role of fuel wood in ancient fu­nerary rituals. This lacuna is noteworthy for two reasons: first, Maya funerary contexts commonly include significant deposits of ash and charcoal. Although inhumation was the most common form of burial treatment among the Classic Maya, cre­mation practices did occur in the Postclassic period and continued into Colonial times (Landa 1966[1566]:59). Some cases of cremation have also been recorded for the Late and Terminal Clas­sic periods in the Maya Lowlands (Iglesias Ponce de Le6n 2003:226, 229; Weiss-Krejci 2006:55), attesting to the time-depth and importance of fire and ash in ancient Maya mortuary practices. Sec­ond, we would benefit from a more systematic approach to understanding the symbolic roles and uses of plants in Maya rituals through the per­spectives of archaeology, paleoethnobotany, 
iconography, and ethnography (see Morehart and Morell-Hart [2015] for a detailed discussion). 
Previous studies have focused primarily on microremains such as pollen, phytoliths, and starch grains (Bozarth and Guderjan 2004; Mc­Neil 2006, 2009; Morehart 2011; Morell-Hart 2011; Rue et al. 1989), or on carbonized grains and fruits (Morehart and Butler 2010; Morehart 2005, 2011; Morehart et al. 2005; Morell-Hart 20 11). Very few of these studies, however, have integrated wood-charcoal analysis. Morehart's (2011) study of archaeobotanical remains found in ritual contexts from several cave sites in the upper Belize River Valley presents some of the most systematic results. Using iconographic and ethnographic data, he argues that certain species of plants, particularly wood and resin from pine and copal trees, were selected for their symbolic significance and burned during rituals as offerings to gods and ancestors (Morehart 2005, 20 11; Morehart et al. 2005). The ceremonial burning of plants and wood seems to have existed in Maya societies since at least the Late Classic period and to have continued through colonial and mod­em times. 
A key difficulty in carrying out an anthraco­logical study of ancient Maya funerary rituals lies in determining whether the charcoal found in burial contexts is directly associated with the rite. Charcoal and other charred archaeobotanical remains, mostly resulting from domestic activi­ties, are commonly scattered throughout archae­ological sediments and can represent intrusive elements to burial fill that are not directly linked to the funerary ritual. In addition, the ritual alter­ation and reopening of ancient burials was a com­mon practice at Maya sites (Chase and Chase 2003) and can disturb the initial funerary assem­blage, making it difficult to determine the origin of the charcoal. Despite these difficulties, the na­ture of the deposit itself helps to determine the type of analysis and interpretation appropriate for the anthracological data (Lennstrom and Has­torf 1995). To interpret the use of plants and wood in funerary rituals accurately, the charcoal spectra from burials must be compared with those of other non-funerary contexts. 
The objective of our analysis of ash deposits found in Terminal Classic (A.D. 800-950) burials at the site of Rfo Bee (Campeche, Mexico) is to complement an earlier study of funerary practices at the site. The previous study was conducted from 2004 to 2008 by Pereira (2013) as part of the Rio Bee Archaeological Project (2002-2009), directed by Dominique Michelet (UMR 8096­CNRS). 
Of the 16 burials excavated at the site, 10 pre­sented a unique funerary pattern: the skeletons were covered by a thick layer of ash and charcoal that was clearly distinct from the burial fill and the surrounding sediment. Absence of evidence for burning on the bones eliminates the possibility of cremation rituals, but raises other questions regarding funerary procedures and practices in Classic Rfo Bee society. One possible explanation is that these ashes represent the refuse from hearths located elsewhere at the site, which were

then intentionally spread on the dead body during the inhumation, as an integral part of the funerary ritual. In order to determine the origin of these ashes, we conducted a comparative study of wood charcoal recovered from funerary, domestic, and non-funerary ritual contexts. Correlations or con­trasts in the uses of wood fuel across distinct con­texts might clarify our understanding of funerary rituals at Rfo Bee in the Classic period. 
Modern Environment of the Study Area 

The modem landscape of the Calakmul region of Campeche, where the site of Rfo Bee is located, consists of a vast limestone plateau that is dotted with low rises (about 250 m asl) and bajos (shal­low, clay-filled depressions that are seasonally flooded). Large-scale slash-and-bum clearing of forests for agriculture has not occurred around Rfo Bee since the abandonment of Maya sites there at the end of the Classic period (A.D. 800­1000). Despite its recent protected status as a local natural reserve, the forest around Rfo Bee has been subjected to consistent and significant natural and anthropogenic modification (e.g., wildfires, supervised wood cutting permissions, etc.), so that modern ecological information gleaned from the current vegetation must be ap­plied cautiously to interpretations of ancient pa­leoethnobotanical assemblages. 
The modem regional vegetation is classified as humid, sub-perennial high to medium forest patches (selva alta y mediana subperennifolia humeda),a formation that covers most of the hu­mid tropical zone of Mexico (Martinez and Galindo-Leal 2002: 10-15; Pennington and Sarukhan 2005:29-34). In the Calakmul bios­phere reserve of Campeche, Martinez and Galindo-Leal (2002:Appendix 1) have recorded a total of 134 species of trees and shrubs belong­ing to 40 botanical families, as well as 7 species of palm. Among them, the Fabaceae family is the most diverse (at least 25 species of trees), followed by the Sapotaceae family (11 species), the Moraceae and the Polygonaceae families (7 species each), and the Rubiaceae family (6 species). The taxonomic diversity is also elevated; at the site of Oxpemul (located 50 km east of Rfo Bee), the Shannon Wiener's Diversity Index reaches 3 .3 for woody species alone (Zamora-Crescencio et al. 20 12: 132). 
The dominant vegetation communities in the Calakmul reserve are the chicle and breadnut forests, whose trees reach heights of 15 to 35 m. The chicle forest (or zapotal) is principally com­posed of members of the Sapotaceae family such as Manilkara zapota (chicozapote), Pouteria amygdalina (sapote), P. campechiana (sapote), 
P. reticulata (sapotillo), P. sapota (sapote mamey),as well as Brosimum alicastrum (bread­nut), Swietenia macrophylla (caoba) and Vitex gaumeri (yaxnik). In the breadnut forest (or ra­monal) the dominant species are Brosimum alicastrum, Manilkara zapota, Pouteria reticulata, Pimenta dioica (pimienta), Talisia olivaeformis (guaya),and Licaria campechiana (aguacatillo). Other plant communities are present but less com­mon: the pukte forest dominated by Bucida buceras (pukte'), the bayo forest dominated by Aspidosperma cruentum (bayo rojo) and A. mega­locarpon (bayo blanco), and the machiche forest dominated by Lonchocarpus castilloi (machiche) and Piscidia piscipula (habfn). 
In contrast, the vegetation of the bajos tends to consist of low thorn-scrub with individual trees reaching heights of 4 to 8 m. It is dominated by 
Ateleia gummifera, Bravaisia berlandieriana (ju­lubal), Bucida buceras, Byrsonima bucidaefolia (nance), Cameraria latifolia (chechen blanco), Coccoloba cozumelensis (boochi che'), Cordia dodecandra (ziricote), Croton icche (p' ere' es k'uuch), Diospyros bumelioides (siliil), Eugenia spp., Gliri­cidia maculata (cocoite),Haematoxylon campechi­anum (palo tinto), Hyperbaena winzerlingii (tripa de cochino), Lonchocarpus xuul (xu'ul), Manilkara zapota, Metopium brownei (chechen negro), Thevetia gaumeri (campanilla), and Tal­isia floresii (kolok) (Martinez and Galindo-Leal 2002: 17). 
Society and Funerary Practices at Rfo Bee 

Following the rediscovery of Rfo Bee by Maurice de Perigny in 1907 and subsequent archaeological investigations, the site has been recognized as distinct from contemporaneous Maya centers. Lo­cated in the Central Maya Lowlands of Mexico in the southeastern quarter of the Calakmul Bios­phere (20 km southeast of the village of Xpujil) (Figure I), Rfo Bee was occupied from A.D. 450

to 950, although the region was inhabited as early as 600 B.C. (Taladoire et al. 2013). 
The site lends its name to the regional culture defined by its unique architectural style, in par­ticular, the "false tower" pyramids with rounded corners that abut certain residences. A number of characteristics beyond its architecture distinguish Rfo Bee. The site lacks the centralized spatial or­ganization associated with sacred royalty that is typical at other contemporaneous Maya sites. In­stead, the layout of Rfo Bee is characterized by dispersed residential monumental groups that ap­pear to lack a hierarchical arrangement (Figure 2). Each "House group" would have exercised authority over its immediate surroundings without necessarily being able to impose its rule on other House groups (Arnauld et al. 2013; Nondedeo et al. 20 13:392). Ritual practices, in particular fu­nerary rites, at Rio Bee lend additional support to this model because they seem to have been limited to the private sphere (Michelet et al. 20 10:156; Pereira 20 13:464). This contrasts with other Classic Maya sites, where the tombs of elite rulers were located in public spaces. Overall, the characteristics of the Rfo Bee site suggest that power did not become centralized in its society. 
Pereira's (2013) study of funerary practices at Rio Bee was carried out from 2004 to 2008. A total of 18 burials were recorded. Of these, 16 funerary contexts from residential groups A, B, and D were selected for systematic excavation. Individuals were consistently found buried under house floors within monumental residences and more modest structures. Applying Lopez's (I 998) model to characterize the internal structure of the deposits, as well as the spatial and stratigraphic location of the burials within the structure (inter­nal and external syntax, Lopez 1998: 177-178), Pereira (2013) was able to distinguish between two types of burials: "transition" burials occurred in association with episodes of significant remod­eling of residential space, while "occupation" burials were associated with the continued occu­pation of the structure. In occupation burials, the deceased was placed in a reclined position directly on the floor of the burial pit, before being covered with a layer of ash varying in thickness from 2 to 20 cm that contained large quantities of wood charcoal fragments. Lastly, the pit was filled with small stones. 
Because the burials were clearly sealed by house floors and this mortuary behavior was ob­served in 10 of the I l occupation burials, it is unlikely that the ash and charcoal in the funerary deposits represent a post-depositional intrusion. Instead, they seem to have been intentionally de­posited during burial . This practice raises a num­ber of questions about the nature and meaning of

ash deposits. To determine their origins (i.e., whether they were residue from domestic hearths of the associated house group or from funerary fires), and to characterize the use of fuel wood in Rio Bee funerary rites, we compared the funerary charcoal assemblages with contemporaneous charcoal assemblages from domestic contexts (kitchen hearths) and non-funerary ritual contexts (ceramic censers deposited beneath house or tem­ple floors). 
Contexts 
This study examines the five burials that were sampled systematically for charcoal recovery: Burial 16 from Group A; Burial 2 from Group B; and Burials 5, 7b, and 9 from Group D. The char­coal assemblages from the kitchen hearths and the ritual censers were selected from the same residential groups as the burials. They are also contemporaneous with the burials, dating to the Terminal Classic (A.D. 800-950). All charcoal samples included in our study had been collected during earlier fieldwork seasons. 
Funerary Contexts 
Of the five burials excavated in Group B, only Burial 2 was sampled for charcoal during exca­vation. It was discovered under the floor of resi­dential structure 6N3 North. The grave contained an adult individual of undetermined sex, in a flexed position, lying on his or her left side and oriented east-west. The burial dates to the final occupation phase of the structure (A.D. 850-950). 
Burials 5, 7b, and 9 in Group D were located under the floors of residential structures 7N2 and 7Nl. Burials 5 and 9 each contained a single in­dividual, while Burial 7 represents a double burial (individuals a and b). Individual bin Burial 7 is male, while the individuals from Burials 5 and 9 are of undetermined sex. All of the deceased were adults. The bodies were placed in a reclined and flexed position, oriented east-west (Burial 7b) or west-east (Burials 5 and 9). All the burials date to the final occupation phase of the residential group (A.D. 900-950). 
Burial 16 (Figure 3) was the only burial asso­ciated with Building 5N2 in Group A, located north of the zone referred to as "nuclear." The building consists of 12 rooms and a temple on a pyramidal platform. It is the largest structure in Group A and one of the only at Rio Bee that could have served a semi-public function (Michelet et al. 2013). The body of an adult male was oriented east-west and placed in a flexed po­sition on his left side. The associated ceramic material indicates that the burial dates to A.D. 
850-900. 
Domestic Contexts 
At Rio Bee, kitchen areas were buildings separate from residential structures that were used collec­tively by the members of the associated residential group. Two kitchen buildings that had been sys­tematically sampled for charcoal remains were selected for this study, Structure 5N2 bis in Group A and Structure 7N3 South in Group D. 
The Group A kitchen (Structure 5N2 bis) is located 15 m southwest of Building 5N2. It con­sists of a rectangular room that opens to the north. The southeastern floor area of the structure was partially covered by a layer of ash that appears to have formed through repeated hearth cleaning. The four charcoal samples were collected from separate charcoal concentrations that seemed to correspond to different hearth cleaning events. 
The Group D kitchen (Structure 7N3 South) is a rectangular room that abuts a modest resi­dential building. It opens also to the north, facing a patio. Eight charcoal samples were collected from this structure: two samples were collected from separate charcoal concentrations uncovered along the south wall, three from a layer of ash that covered the floor and appears to represent multiple hearth cleanings, and three more from charcoal fragments scattered on the floor of the building. 
Non-Funerary Ritual Contexts 
Several ceramic vessels were recovered at Rfo Bee from contexts under prepared floors. These vessels present characteristics indicative of their use as censers. Charcoal samples were systemat­ically collected from two of these censers: the first from Building 5N2 in Group A, the second from Building 7N4 in Group D. 
The censer from Group A is the fourth in a se­ries of seven vessels that had been placed in a row from east to west under the floor of the Struc­ture 5N2 temple. They appear to constitute a sin-

gle deposit associated with the consecration ritual of the temple around A.D. 830-860. This censer was the only one in the set that contained ash and charcoal, as well as the bones of a very young child. The absence of evidence for combustion on the interior surfaces of the vessels leads us to believe that the wood was burned first in an open space, as indicated also by the presence of large ash patches near the group of censers. At least a portion of the resulting ash and charcoal was later placed in the censer. 
The censer from Group D was located in a pit under the floor of Structure 7N4. It was appar­ently associated with Burial 6, dated to A.D. 850­950, which was the only occupation burial that did not contain an ash layer. The charcoal col­lected from this ritual deposit was found under and around the censer. As in the case of the censer 
from Group A, the absence of combustion marks 
inside the Group D censer and the charcoal dis­tributed around the vessel raise questions regard­ing the use of these objects, which are generally assumed to have served as receptacles for burning organic material. 
Materials and Methods 
Table I presents the list of contexts from which 
the samples used in this study were obtained. A 
small quantity of carbonized seed and fruit re­
mains was also recovered from Burials 7b, 9, and 
16 (Table 2). A separate study of these remains is 
currently underway. 
The charcoal samples were collected by mem­
bers of the Rfo Bee Project during the excavation 
of each structure or burial, with the exception of 
Censer A, which was transported to the laboratory 
of the Centre d'Etudes Mexicaines et Centrameri­
caines (CEMCA) in Mexico City for fine-scaled 
excavation and sampling. The procedure for char­
coal collection in the field consisted of dry screen­

ing all ash layers containing visible charcoal frag­ments with a mesh of 5 mm in the kitchen areas and 2 mm in the burials and censers.

Systematic analysis of the recovered charcoal was carried out in the Archaeobotany Laboratory of the University of Paris 1, located at the Maison de l' Archeologie et de l 'Ethnologie (N anterre, France). The samples were sorted to recover those most likely to be identified ( 4 mm in size). Each charcoal was snapped by hand to expose the three anatomical sections (transverse, longitudinal tan­gential, and longitudinal radial) and then observed with an optical reflected light microscope at mag­nifications between 50x and 500x. The physical comparisons of archaeological charcoal with mod­em specimens were carried out using the charred wood reference collection of the University of Paris l and the xylological collection of the Musee Royal de l' Afrique Centrale (Tervuren, Belgium). Wood anatomy atlases such as Metcalfe and Chalk (1957), Detienne and Jacquet (1983), Jacquiot (1955), and the Flora of the Guianas, Series A, of the Royal Botanic Gardens of Kew (Berg et al. 1992; Cowan et al. 1989; Jansen-Jacob et al. 2011), the online Insidewood database1 (maintained by the InsideWood Working Group and North Car­olina State University), and publications of the In­ternational Association of Wood Anatomists were also instrumental to our analysis.

In addition to the taxonomic identifications, we also carried out morphological analysis to deter­mine, whenever possible, the maturity of the wood tissue and the represented anatomical part (i.e., branch, trunk, or root). Juvenile wood is detected by observing the angle of the medullary rays, the curvature of the growth rings, and the presence of the central pith. Root wood is distinguished from branch or trunk wood by its higher relative abun­dance of parenchyma cells and by the absence of the central pith. Because the latter criterion cannot be used if the center of the fragment is not pre­served, the statistical value of the presence of root wood is limited. Photographs of all three anatom­ical sections were taken using a digital camera connected to a reflected light microscope. 
Results 
The results of our analysis are presented in Table 
3. A total of 1,516 charcoal fragments were stud­ied, of which 1,318 (87 percent) could be identi­fied at either the family or genus level. Seventeen taxonomic families and 12 genera were identified. For the remaining charcoal fragments, it was im­possible to identify the family with certainty. Forty-six charcoal fragments were identified as Fabaceae/Bignoniaceae, these two families being extremely difficult to distinguish anatomically when the vestured pits are not observable, as is often the case in poorly preserved charcoal. An­other 63 charcoal fragments (or 4 percent of the total charcoal assemblage) were grouped into 21 "unknown" taxonomic groups, each associated with a potential taxonomic type when possible

(Table 3). These fragments either do not present an adequate degree of discriminate characteristics or there is a lack of adequate reference material to identify them with certainty. Finally, 135 char­coal fragments (9 percent of the total assemblage) were classified as unidentifiable due to poor con­servation or immature cellular structure and are therefore excluded from the taxonomic analysis, but included in the morphological analysis. 
Taxonomic Richness and Diversity 
The taxonomic richness of a collection corre­sponds to the number of taxa present in a given assemblage (Spellerberg and Fedor 2003). Our results show that the greatest richness is found in the burial assemblages, with 43 taxa. The kitchen assemblages contain a total of seven taxa, and the censers 12. Taxonomic richness, however, does not indicate the proportion of each taxon within an assemblage, which can lead to bias in the interpretation. Thus, we must also consider the taxonomic diversity. 
The taxonomic diversity takes into account the relative abundance of each taxon in the sam­ple (Spellerberg and Fedor 2003) and allows us to evaluate the importance of taxonomic differ­ences. It is often expressed using the Shannon­Wiener index H' which uses the formula 
s 

H' =-L,pilnpi 
i=I 

where p is the proportion of the tax on in relation to the total number of taxa (S) in the sample. 
As shown in Figure 4, the taxonomic diversity index of each assemblage correlates with the type of context. Two principal groups emerge. The first is the lower diversity group associated with the censers. The lack of diversity in these samples is striking in light of their high charcoal counts, particularly for Censer A. The second is the higher diversity group, associated with the kitchens and burials. This second group can be further divided into two subgroups: (I) the buri­als, which present a higher taxonomic richness and a higher diversity score, and (2) the kitchens, which contain fewer taxa in more unequal pro­portions.

Taxonomic and Morphological Identification 
Four families dominate the assemblages, consti­tuting 81.9 percent of all the identified charcoal. It is difficult to distinguish between the different genera of the Sapotaceae family (30.3 percent of the assemblages) due to their anatomic homo­geneity. Sapotaceae wood is typically character­ized by a pattern of vessels in radial or dendritic arrangement, axial parenchyma in lines, hetero­geneous rays that are uni-, bi-, or tri-seriate, and wide horizontal to vertical vessel-ray pits. There are currently at least 11 species of Sapotaceae distributed among three genera (Manilkara, Pouteria, and Sideroxylon) in the Calakmul re­gion (Martinez and Galindo-Leal 2002:Appendix l). They are large trees typical of the zapotal habitat common in the Central Lowlands. 
Pine (Pinus sp., Figure 5a) makes up 26.3 per­cent of the identified charcoal. Oocarpa Pine (P. oocarpa) and Caribbean Pine (P. caribaea) are the two species that are currently present in the Central Maya Lowlands and the Belize Moun­tains. Only the Caribbean Pine grows naturally at low altitudes (300 m and lower). It is found in Belize, in the savannahs of Peten in Guatemala, and in southern Quintana Roo (Davidse et al. 2015; Perry 1991:200; Standley and Steyermark 1946:45-48). Although the two species of pine present similar anatomic characteristics (abundant uni-or bi-seriate pits in the vertical tracheids, horizontal tracheids with dentate walls, pinoid cross-field pits), the presence of numerous intra-annual growth rings (also referred to as "false­rings") in our fragments leads us to believe that this taxon is most likely the species P. caribaea. 
The ziricote (Cordia sp., Figure Sb) accounts for 10.5 percent of the assemblage. The genus Cordia is distinguishable by its scattered vessels of medium diameter, paratracheal aliform and confluent axial parenchyma, minute vessel-ray pits similar to the intervessel pits, and multiseriate and heterogeneous rays presenting crystals. Only one species has been recorded in the Calakmul region, C. dodecandra (Martinez and Galindo­Leal 2002:Appendix 1). Other species, however, exist elsewhere in the Central Maya Lowlands (e.g., C. alliodora, C. collococca, C. diversifolia) (Lundell 1937:74; Pennington and Sarukhan 2005:456, 460). 
The Fabaceae family is the most represented in terms of diversity in the Rio Bee charcoal sam­ple (a minimum of eight taxa that constitute 14.8 percent of the total assemblage). This family is one of the most prominent taxa in Central Maya Lowland forests, both in terms of diversity and occurrence. No less than 15 genera and 25 species have been recorded for the Calakmul region alone (Martinez and Galindo-Leal 2002:Appendix 1). Wood in members of the Fabaceae family is char­acterized by paratracheal axial parenchyma that is often abundant and presents crystals, vestured pits, and rays that are almost exclusively homo­geneous, with all ray cells procumbent. It is gen­erally difficult to differentiate among the genera

due to the high taxonomic diversity within the Fabaceae family, which presents a high degree of intraspecific anatomical variation. Neverthe­less, certain genera, such as Lonchocarpus (Fig­ures Sc and 5d), Piscidia, and Dalbergia (which belong to the Fabaceae-Papilionoideae subfamily) possess certain characteristics that make their identification possible. These include paratracheal confluent parenchyma and the storied arrange­ment of rays and axial parenchyma cells visible in the longitudinal tangential section. 
The remainder of the charcoal assemblage 

(18.1 percent) is made up of a mix of trees (Burseraceae, genera Protium and Bursera; and Moraceae, Ficus sp.) and shrubs (Coccoloba sp.; Celastraceae; Myrsinaceae). The genus Byrsonima (Figures 5e and 5f), a small fruit tree known lo­cally as the nance,occurs in Burials 16 and S. Its wood is characterized by few axial parenchyma, vestured pits, septate fibers with large pits, and heterogeneous rays that are 1-5 seriate, very tall, and irregular in the longitudinal tangential section. Charcoal from Bambusoideae stems (7 .3 percent; Figure 5g) were identified in Burial 16. Mono­cotyledons present a lignified non-woody structure that contains characteristic vascular bundles whose form and size allow more detailed identifications (Liese 1998). Unfortunately, due to the great anatomic homogeneity of the monocotyledons, as well as the lack of an anatomic reference collection specific to neotropical bamboos, we were unable to identify these charred grass fragments beyond the subfamily Poaceae-Bambusoideae. According to Clark (1990: 129), there are eight native genera of Bambusoideae in Mexico today, of which two are endemic. These include numerous species of herbaceous and arboreal bamboos. Only three herbaceous species of bamboo, belonging to the genera Olyra and Pharus,have been recorded for the states of Campeche and Quintana Roo (Da vidse et al. 1994). 
In addition to the taxonomic determinations, morphological observations were made for char­coal assemblages from the three different archae­ological contexts. In the burials, 14 percent of all the recovered charcoal fragments come from im­mature wood (small branches and twigs) and two percent from roots (cf. Eugenia sp.). For the censers, two percent of the charcoal is immature wood and one percent comes from roots (Figure Sh). Less than one percent of the charcoal from the kitchens is immature wood. Although these figures may slightly underestimate the proportion of roots and juvenile wood in the sample, due to the fact that not all necessary identifying features would preserve, the results show that at least a portion of these types of fuel wood differ from one context to another. 
The comparison of the proportions of charcoal from the four dominant families demonstrates clear patterns among the different contexts (Fig­ure 6). Members of the Sapotaceae family are present in all three types of contexts, particularly the Group A kitchen and the Group D censer. Cordia sp. is well represented in the domestic contexts and in Burial S. It is present in only small proportions in Burials 16, 7b, and 9, and it is absent in Burial 2 and the censers. Pinus sp. is well represented in the censers and the burials, with the exception of Burial S, where it is absent. In contrast, Pinus sp. is completely absent in the two kitchens. It appears that the proportions of Pinus sp. and Cordia sp. are inversely correlated. Finally, 99 percent of the identified Fabaceae were recovered from the burials. The final one percent was found in the Group A censer. It is, however, impossible to confirm that Fabaceae were entirely absent from the kitchens because charcoal fragments assigned to the Fabaceae/ Bignoniaceae category could not be assigned more precisely to a single family. 
Summary: Three Patterns of Fuel Wood Use 
Taxonomic richness and diversity and the taxo­nomic and morphological differences of charcoal pieces analyzed in this study indicate three dis­tinct patterns of fuel wood use. The first is asso­ciated with Burials 7b, 9, and 16 and is charac­terized by an elevated taxonomic richness and diversity, by the abundance of Fabaceae and pine, the low proportion of Cordia sp., and a relatively high proportion of juvenile wood. The second pattern is associated with the Group A and D censers and is characterized by a low taxonomic diversity, the absence of Cordia sp., and a high proportion of pine. The third pattern is associated with the Group A and D kitchens, and it is distin­guished by a medium taxonomic diversity score despite low richness, a high proportion of Cordia sp., and the absence of pine wood.

Figure 6. Proportions of the four dominant taxonomic families per context. 
Burials 2 and 5 do not conform completely to any of the three patterns. Burial 5 resembles in some ways the third pattern associated with kitchen contexts, but the high proportion of Piscidia sp. (26.4 percent), a Fabaceae not found elsewhere in the assemblage, is uncharacteristic of any of the patterns. Similarly, Burial 2, the only context analyzed from Group B, shares with the burials a medium taxonomic diversity and a high proportion of Fabaceae, but its high proportion of pine and the absence of Cordia sp. are more closely associated with ritual censers at Rio Bee. 
Discussion 
Our study aims to understand the relationship be­tween fuel wood use and three distinct activity sets (fires that were part of funerary ceremonies, non-funerary rituals, and domestic tasks). Does the charcoal recovered from funerary contexts derive from domestic activities? How does the study of charcoal recovered from censers used in non-funerary contexts contribute to our under­standing of wood combustion in ritual contexts? Can we observe a model of wood use that is unique to mortuary rites? The fact that the con­texts we analyzed for this study all date to the later occupation of the site (A.D. 800-950) facil­itates their comparison. Also, the three different types of activities (funerary and non-funerary rit­uals and domestic) were carried out in the same residential and familial setting and were relevant to the private sphere of Rio Bee society. 
Individual Fires and Mixed Hearth Remains 
Does random use of wood explain the differences in taxonomic richness that exist between the char­coal assemblages from burials, kitchens, and non­funerary ritual contexts? Or is it instead the result of intentional cultural practices related to specific wood selection for different activities? Finally, can we eliminate the possibility that taphonomic bias, like sampling error or differential preserva­tion, affects the assemblages? 
To answer these questions, we must consider the formation processes of the deposits and the human actions that produced them. Charcoal re­covered from primary deposits, e.g., domestic hearths, tends to provide a record of a particular combustion event, but does not necessarily rep­resent specific fuel wood use over extended pe­riods. In general, charcoal from these types of deposits represents the taxa used during the last episode (or last few episodes) of burning. Taken alone, they are of limited use for determining the full range of taxa used for combustion at the site. Charcoal assemblages that resulted from many successive fires present in dispersed deposits in occupation levels, middens, or construction fills are better suited for reconstructing long-term pat­terns of fuel wood use (Asouti and Austin 2005; Chabal 1994; Chabal et al. 1999:59-60; Pearsall 1988:115-116). 
The differences in taxonomic richness ob­served between domestic, ritual, and funerary contexts at Rio Bee could be explained by distinct formation processes. If the charcoal in the burials

constituted secondary deposits derived from suc­cessive fires in kitchen hearths, it should encom­pass all the taxa that accumulated in domestic fires over time. This formation process could ex­plain the greater taxonomic richness of the fu­nerary contexts compared to domestic hearths and ritual censers, because charcoal deposits that accumulated gradually over a long period would contain more taxa than those produced by isolated combustion events. 

It is probable that the domestic assemblages we study represent domestic fuel wood use at Rfo Bee, at least for the final phase of occupation. The assemblages recovered from the two kitchens were made up of several individual samples (four in the Group A kitchen and eight from Group D) that were collected not only from hearths, but also from secondary charcoal concentrations on floors that likely resulted from multiple episodes of hearth cleaning. The taxonomic diversity of the domestic contexts is nevertheless consistently lower than that of the burials, even when the charcoal counts of the samples are equivalent (e.g., the Group A kitchen and Burials 5 and 7b). The presence of Fabaceae wood in all of the burial deposits is also noteworthy in light of its absence in the domestic contexts. Therefore, it appears unlikely that the ash deposited in the graves at the moment of burial originated from the kitchen hearths. It seems equally unlikely that the resi­dents would have deliberately stored the remains of multiple domestic fires for use in future burials. The high taxonomic richness of the funerary char­coal assemblages is, however, typical of sec­ondary deposits, and the possibility remains that funerary charcoal comprised remains from mul­tiple combustion episodes of a different type, such as specialized ritual hearths. 
If the different rates of taxonomic richness ob­served between contexts are not due to tapho­nomic bias, they could instead imply discriminate fuel wood use for specific activities. Therefore, it is important to study both the taxonomic dif­ferences between contexts and the taxa that make up the various assemblages. 
What Were the Criteria for the Selection of Fuel Wood? 
According to ethnographic and archaeological studies, the choice and use of fuel wood may be influenced by various physical properties (density, length of combustion, odor, smoke production, etc.) depending on the particular function of the fire. For domestic fuel, which is most commonly collected opportunistically as deadwood, the most 


important factors are local abundance and acces­sibility (Chabal 1994:328; Chabal et al. 1999:92­93; Lee Smart and Hoffman 1988:168-170; Marston 2009; Metzger and Williams 1966). At Rfo Bee, the high proportions of Sapotaceae, Fabaceae, and Cordia could easily be explained by their abundance in the plant communities that nowadays characterize the Central Lowlands (Martinez and Galindo-Leal 2002:Table 2). Fur­thermore, their dense wood, which is a high-qual­ity fuel source, may also contribute to the delib­erate selection of these taxa. Sapotaceae species such as chicozapote (Manilkara zapota) or zapote (Pouteria sapota) serve many purposes (construc­tion wood, edible fruits, latex, medicinal proper­ties in the bark and seeds [Atran and Ucan Ek' 1999:Table 2.2]) that are well-attested to among Maya societies by archaeological data going back at least as far as the Preclassic (Campbell et al. 2006:Appendix 1.2; Lentz 1999:Table 1.1; Lentz and Hockaday 2009). It has been suggested that these trees, some of the most useful in the region, would have been favored resources for the Maya, which might explain their current abundance in the forests that surround archaeological sites (Lundell 1938). 
Wood from the family Burseraceae (Protium copal and Bursera spp.) pine (Pinus sp.) are ap­preciated today for their fragrance and resin. The resin may be used to produce incense, but its fra­grance is also released by directly burning the wood (Aguirre de Riojas and De Poll 2007:23, 132; Atran and Ucan Ek' 1999:Table 2.2; Pen­nington and Sarukhan 2005:292; Schlesinger 2001:115, 119-120; Standley and Steyermark 1946:1:41, V:434--441; Tobias 2011:107). In ad­dition, pine is used as kindling in the form of ocote, thin sticks of sapwood collected just be­neath the bark of the tree. Ocote is rich in resin and ignites quickly with a high temperature (Aguirre de Riojas and De Poll 2007:23; Standley and Steyermark 1946:1:41). 
Herbaceous bamboo stems (Bambusoideae) can also be used for this purpose. Thompson notes their use for lighting fires for ceramic production 
Downloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core. YBP Library Services, on 22 Aug 2018 at 17:14:15, subject to the Cambridge Core terms of use, available at https://www.cambridge.org/core/terms. https://doi.org/10.7183/1045-6635.27.1.51 
in Southeast Asia (Bayard 1977; Longacre et al. 1991 cited in Thompson 1994:15). In the case of ancient Maya societies, it is unknown whether bamboos were used as fuel, but the lack of data may well be due to poor preservation of these fragile plants, whose rapid combustion generally does not produce charcoal remains (Thompson 1994:15). 
While many of the wood tax.a at Rio Bee pre­sent physical characteristics that would explain their selection as fuel wood, others are known for their symbolic value and use in modem Maya rit­uals. We present here a brief summary of More­hart's (2011:106-114) inventory of these wood taxa, their ritual meanings and uses, based on ethnographic references, e.g., Alcorn ( 1984), Atran and Ucan Ek' (1999), Barrera Marfn et al. (1976), Berlin et al. (197 4), Breedlove and Laughlin (2000), Flores and Kantun-Balam (1997), McGee (1990), Roys (1931), and Vogt (1969, 1976). 

Pine, associated with wild nature, is commonly burned during modem Maya rituals, its fragrant smoke symbolizing the discourse of the gods. The wood of tzalam (Lysiloma sp.), hab{n (Piscidia piscipula), and ziricote (Cordia dodecandra) is reportedly used for burning during Yucatec Maya religious ceremonies. Religious idols are tradi­tionally carved from Spanish Cedar (Cedrela odorata). Burseraceae wood (Protium copal and Bursera simarouba) is associated with rituals tied to the rain deity Chae. Certain species of Lochocarpus are employed in the production of balche, a fermented drink consumed during rituals. Morehart (2011: 113) suggests that the use of wood from trees employed to make balche may have referred to the consumption of the ritual beverage. 
In the Rio Bee samples, the above-mentioned taxa were found exclusively in burials, with the exception of Cordia (also present in the kitchens) and pine (found in the censers). This pattern sug­gests a selection of certain wood taxa for funerary rites because of their symbolic value. The fact that they occurred in relatively low proportions may indicate that the charcoal resulted from the burning of objects during the funerary ceremony. In any case, it seems likely that the taxonomic diversity of charcoal found in burial contexts was intentional. 
The diversity of fuel wood taxa in burials is accentuated by the presence of a few seed and 
fruit remains in Burials 7b, 9, and 16. These in­clude maize kernels, fruit pits, and an almost complete drupe fruit (Figure 7). The inclusion of edible plant remains in the funerary assemblage might simply reflect the diversity of plant fuels. For example, it is well documented in Mexico that maize cobs along with wood were used as fuel (Adriano-Moran and McClung 2008:2929). It is more likely, however, that these plant remains were funerary offering. In various precolumbian societies, it is common for plant foodstuffs to ac­company the deceased into the grave (e.g., Bian­chini and Scheel-Ybert 2012; Cutrigh 20 11 ; Gumerman 1997; Hall et al. 1990; Powis et al. 2002). In addition to the seed and fruit remains, wood from fruit trees (e.g., Sapotaceae, ziricote [Cordia sp.], and craboo [Byrsonima sp.]) was found in the charcoal assemblage. It could be hy­pothesized that the symbolic food value of these trees was as important as their fuel value. 
The Use of Pine Wood in Rio Bee Rituals 
The presence of pine wood at Rfo Bee warrants deeper examination because of its high propor­tions in the assemblages (27 .5 percent of all char­coal), the ritual nature of the contexts in which it appears (burials and censers exclusively), and the fact that it probably had to be obtained over long distances. 
As previously mentioned, pine is a principal source of firewood and resin among traditional Maya groups today, particularly in the Guatemalan Highlands, where pine forest is abundant (Stand­ley and Steyermark 1946:1:41). The frequency of pine charcoal at Maya archaeological sites attests to the continuity of its use, at least since the Late Classic (Lentz 1999:Table 1.1; Lentz et al. 2005; Morehart 2011: 106-107; More hart et al. 2005; Pudzisz et al. 2004; Wyatt 2008). Additional evi­dence for the importance of pine wood in Maya culture comes from mythology. Pine, a symbol of wild nature, is mentioned in the Papal Vuh as one of the trees present at the beginning of the world, along with the ceiba (Ceiba pentandra) and cy­press (Cupressus lusitanica) (Aguirre de Riojas and De Poll 2007: 18-27). Morehart argues that pine wood was an indispensable component of rituals in ancient Maya cave sites in Belize (Morehart et al. 2005). Lentz et al. (2005) propose that the economic im-

portance of pine wood was such that its procure­ment, distribution, and use were a privilege of the ruling elite at Xunantunich in western Belize. 
It seems that the use of pine was also regulated at Rfo Bee, where it would have perhaps been reserved for the ritual sphere (funerary and non­funerary). A greater number of contexts need to be studied to confirm this hypothesis. According to Standley and Steyermark (1946:1:41), pine is not an ideal fuel wood due to its high resin con­tent, which results in rapid combustion. This ex­plains why pine is used primarily as kindling and not as base fuel wood today. The high proportion of pine in funerary and non-funerary ritual as­semblages at Rfo Bee may, therefore, reflect a preference for quick-burning, high-intensity fires in association with ritual symbolism. This con­trasts with domestic fires, for which a lower-in­tensity combustion and a longer burning time would have been preferred. This hypothesis is reinforced by the high proportion of juvenile wood (small branches, twigs, and roots of other taxa) in the burials, as well as by the presence of bamboo stem fragments in Burial 16. Both types 
of plant tissue produce high-temperature fires of 
short duration. 
Finally, it is necessary to consider the origins of the pine wood used at Rio Bee. The closest modem pine forests are located approximately 40 km east of the site (Davidse et al. 2015). Pine trees may have grown naturally in the area around the site during the Classic period, or the wood at Rio Bee may have been imported, a theory pro­posed by Lentz et al. (2005) for sites in the upper Belize River Valley. An alternate possibility is that pine was intentionally introduced to the Rfo Bee region and cultivated using ancient sylvicul­ture techniques (planting and maintenance). Caribbean Pine is a heliophilous pioneer species that grows rapidly; it can adapt to the sandy-clay soils of the bajo zones and colonize recently aban­doned areas in a short time (Barret and Golfari 1962:211). For the ancient Maya, it would have been ecologically possible and economically prof­itable to cultivate pine forests close to their set­tlements, allowing pine trees to recolonize aban­doned, deforested zones. Whether the pine at Rfo Bee was endemic to the area, or was introduced through trade or sylviculture (or a combination of these scenarios), this wood seems to have been of sufficient economic importance to justify re­serving its use to ritual practices. 
Funerary Hearths? 

Our study reveals that during the Classic period at Rfo Bee, the selection and use of fire wood was not random. Even if not strictly regulated, wood selection was at least influenced by a num­ber of economic and symbolic considerations, and specific wood types were associated with different combustion contexts. Taxa that occur abundantly and produce dense tissue (Sapotaceae, Fabaceae, and ziricote) served as primary fuels; they were present in domestic and ritual com­bustion contexts. Pine wood was clearly reserved for ritual activities, but its use was not necessarily mandatory, as demonstrated by its absence from Burial 5. Secondary fuel consisted of a wide spec­trum of other taxa, which most likely resulted from the opportunistic collection of firewood around the site, although some may have been selected for their symbolic value. Furthermore, the elevated richness of locally available wood taxa in funerary fires seems to have been inten-

tional, particularly in Burials 9 and 16. Finally, the inclusion of small-section wood elements such as small branches, twigs, roots, and bamboo stems appears specific to funerary rites, where they would have complemented the pine wood to produce intense fires of short duration. A sim­ilar practice is reported by Beauclair et al. (2009) for Tupi-Guarani societies in Brazil. Their analy­sis of charcoal from ritual hearths located close to burials shows that the fuel consists almost ex­clusively of bark, which was likely selected for its capacity to produce high-intensity fires of short duration. Ethnographic observation suggests that this practice enables the deceased to attain the status of ancestor. While we must be cautious about advancing a similar hypothesis for the Rio Bee funerary rites, we can nevertheless attest that fire played a central role in the treatment of the dead, although perhaps not for all burials, given that not all burials at the site were subject to the same treatment (i.e., transition vs. occupation burials). The link between fire and the dead con­tinued even after the initial inhumation, as evi­denced by the recurring traces of combustion found on portions of house floors associated with occupation burials (Pereira 2013:463). 
The Use of Wooden Artifacts in Funerary Rites 

We know that wood played a role in the funerary practices of many Mesoamerican societies. Al­though no direct records exist for the Classic pe­riod, written accounts offer some insight about funerary wood use during the Postclassic period. We do not discuss the evidence related to funerary pyres because cremation was generally a rare practice in the Classic Maya Lowlands, and there is no evidence for this practice at Rio Bee. Later sources mention other uses of wood in funerary contexts, e.g., in the manufacture of anthropo­morphic sculptures that serve as receptacles for some of the funerary ashes of Yucatec dignitaries during the Contact period (Landa 1966 [1566] :59). But these objects, conserved and ven­erated in domestic sanctuaries, were not intended for burning. 
Another use of wooden objects for the same time period is described in sources from central Mexico. Effigies made from pine branches were dressed and adorned to serve as proxies in the burials of warriors whose bodies could not be re­covered (Duran 1995[1566]:1:344-345). These were then burned during the funeral ceremony. Although the high proportion of juvenile wood in Rio Bee funerary deposits seems compatible with the description of burnt effigies, the current data cannot support this position due to the lack of burnt paraphernalia associated with the effigies. 
We cannot completely discard the hypothesis that the funerary charcoal at Rio Bee came from very simple artifacts. Many ancient and modem sources show the importance of bundles made from plant materials to symbolize different ele­ments or concepts in a variety of rituals. A well­known example is the bundle of sticks that sym­bolized the 52-year cycle for the Aztecs. Based on Classic period iconography, similar bundles used at Teotihuacan (von Winning 1979) and in Maya society (Taube 2000) seem to have been associated with fire and regenerative cycles. Mod­em ethnography (Dehouve 2001) shows that such bundles, grouping specific quantities of plant el­ements (leaves, ocote, etc.), are still used as ritual offerings today and are sometimes destroyed by fire. The number of objects present in the bundles varies according to the specific ritual or the su­pernatural entities invoked. 
We cannot confirm with our current data that the charcoal deposits found at Rio Bee originated from such bundles or arrangements of plant ma­terials. Nevertheless, the co-occurrence of sig­nificant taxonomic diversity, the symbolic value associated with some of the taxa, and the high proportion of juvenile wood allow us to hypoth­esize that this wood assemblage was deliberately arranged and later reduced to ash and charcoal. 
The Symbolism of the Plant Life Cycle in Maya Funerary Models 
The cremation of plant elements within a funerary framework leads us to consider the greater mean­ing that plants could have had in ancient Maya conceptualizations of death. In his brief descrip­tion of the afterlife of the Postclassic Yucatec Maya, Fray Diego de Landa (1966[1566]:60) em­phasizes the importance of a tree, the yaxhe (Ceiba pentandra), under which the blessed souls of the dead were supposed to remain. 
More relevant to our argument are epigraphic and iconographic data from the Classic period it­self. Based on a number of documents that date 
Downloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core. YBP Library Services, on 22 Aug 2018 at 17:14:15, subject to the Cambridge Core terms of use, available at https://www.cambridge.org/core/terms. https://doi.org/10.7183/1045-6635.27.1.51 
to this epoch, we note that the metaphor of the plant life cycle was popular to describe the trans­formation of the dead into ancestors (Eberl 2005; Fitzsimmons 2009:22-24). The cycle of death and rebirth of maize is widely illustrated in Maya iconography portraying the deceased with traits of the young maize god. The same traits are shown on the figure of the deceased lord in the first scene of the Berlin Vase and on that of the sovereign, who is depicted on the engraved bones from Tomb 116 at Tikal as traveling toward the underworld (Eberl 2005; Fitzsimmons 2009). 
But maize is not the only plant associated with the dead, and trees also occupy an important place in Maya funerary imagery. Depictions of ances­tors as trees can be found in several well-known scenes. On the second scene of the Berlin vase, three anthropomorphic trees grow above an al­most decomposed body. The three faces at the base of the trees show the deceased himself in the center, while the faces of a man and woman on either side prob(lbly show his parents. Each individual is associated with a different tree, all of which can be identified. The central tree, car­rying large horizontal pods, is cacao (Martin 2006), while the tree on the left is covered with fruits that resemble soursops (Annona murcicata, Filloy 2014:260). 
The representation of the dead as fruit trees is also well illustrated at the tomb of K'inich Janaab' Pakal of Palenque. Ten figures are engraved on the four sides of his sarcophagus; emerging from the earth, each is a member of the dynasties that preceded Pakal (Filloy 2014:258-259; Roberston 1983; Ruz 1973). As in the case of the Berlin Vase, the figures are associated with fruit trees, including guava, avocado, sapote, cacao, and cra­boo. Some authors have argued that this "orchard of ancestors" symbolizes the community of the deceased that made up the royal dynasty (McAnany 1995:75; Schele and Freidel 1990: 221). The deceased, as fruit, would decompose in the soil and fertilize the earth, to be reborn again in the form of fruit-bearing trees. 

Could there be a link between this metaphor­ical plant life cycle and the practices observed in the burials of Rfo Bee? Does the cremation of plants during funerary ceremonies represent their symbolic death and their subsequent revival by the deceased at the end of his or her journey to the underworld? We could also speculate that the cremation of the plants was intended to refer to the burning of agricultural plots that precedes the sowing of seeds. While we cannot verify this hy­pothesis, it is interesting to note that the taxa em­ployed were clearly chosen for their symbolic value (pine, copal, habfn, balche, etc.) or their alimentary value ( ziricote, craboo, maize). At Rfo Bee, funerary practices seem to reflect the world­view of a society that placed great value on an­cestors and territoriality (Nondedeo et al. 2013; Lemonnier and Vanniere 2013; Pereira 2013). The manipulation of the natural substrate of cer­tain burials (e.g., recreating natural stratigraphy in some, intentionally depositing vegetal litter in others) evokes the attention of the residents of the site on soil and earth. In fact, the recurring iconographic theme of the cosmic monster at Rfo Bee, which is portrayed on the faades of impor­tant residences, is interpreted as the symbol of the passage into the earth. This imagery may have represented the desire of elite families to manifest their territorial control (Nondedeo and Patrois 2007:189). In this sense, the use of a maximal number of wood taxa in funerary fires may rep­resent an attempt by the residents of Rfo Bee to affirm their ties to their territory through a sym­bolic recreation of the surrounding landscape. 
Conclusion 

The study of charcoal from burials at Rfo Bee has allowed us to demonstrate the complexity of Maya funeral rites during the Terminal Classic, as well as the importance of a paleoethnobotanical approach to the reconstruction of human activi­ties, in this case funerary rituals. Despite the rel­atively small number of contexts studied, it is clear that these burials were subject to a treatment that is more complex than previously understood, in which the choice and use of fuel wood were regulated and meaningful. Although the current data allow us only to advance certain hypotheses concerning the meaning of these funeral rites, they nevertheless attest to the links that existed in the Maya worldview between fire, ashes, and the cycle of life and death, as symbolized by the plant life cycle.

funerary and non-funerary rituals among the an­
cient Maya: if the ashes discovered in the burials 
and censers are not the result of in situ combustion 
and instead represent secondary deposits, where 
did the ritual fires actually take place? 
We know that sacred places in the Maya land­
scape, such as cave sites, were common places 
of rituals. But what may we hypothesize about 
the rituals that would have undoubtedly been car­
ried out in urban centers and residential units? 
Ethnographic observations provide one line of 
evidence, insofar as modem Maya continue to 
carry out ceremonies involving fire on modem 
altars in archaeological sites or in non-urban 
places (notably hills and forests near villages). It 
would be of great interest to investigate this issue 
in more depth, using ethnographic, ethnohistoric, 
and epigraphic data to guide the search for sites 
of ritual burning. 
The apparent lack of data in support of this fu­nerary practice beyond the Maya Lowlands does not mean that it was a localized phenomenon or that it occurred only during the Terminal Classic. Numerous mentions of ash and charcoal observed in funerary contexts can be found in the literature. For example, at the site of Naachtun, a similar treatment was observed in some burials (Barrien­tos 2013:304). While the principal goal of this study is to improve our understanding of Rfo Bee funerary rites and how they reflect the ideas and actions of local residents relating to death, it pro­vides only a limited vision of this ritual, which was probably practiced over a wider range in time and space. The relatively unremarkable appear­ance of these ash deposits no doubt explains why they have been largely ignored by archaeologists. We therefore wish to emphasize the importance of paleoethnobotanical sampling in funerary con­texts, using systematic collecting procedures (flotation or dry screening). Only through the ap­plication of such approaches at other Central Maya Lowland sites will we obtain the data necessary to make comparisons at the regional level. Future research will allow us to develop broader models concerning the use of fuel wood in the funerary rituals of ancient Maya societies.
