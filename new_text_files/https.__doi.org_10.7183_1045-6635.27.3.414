SPINDLE WHORLS FROM EL PURGATORIO, PERU, AND THEIR
SOCIOECONOMIC IMPLICATIONS

In the Andean region, spindle whorls have been the subject of archaeological analysis less often than other artifact classes,such as pottery. Nevertheless, spindle whorls may have much more to contribute to archaeological interpretations of pro­duction, status, and exchange patterns than previously acknowledged. The case study presented here examines the spindlewhorl collection from the site of El Purgatorio, Peru, the capital city of the Casma polity (ca. A.D. 700–1400). Spindlewhorls were not only expertly crafted utilitarian tools for spinning yarn, but also items of personal adornment, symbols ofwealth or status, and possible indicators of intra­polity exchange patterns. The analysis of spindle whorls in regard to formand functionprovides insight into Casmasocialand economicorganization. The spindle whorlsdiscovered at ElPurgatorioalso reflect varying degrees of standardization and technical knowledge, suggesting that at least some may have been man­ufactured by specialists in metallurgical and ceramic workshops.

Los torteros fueron analizados tanto por su forma como por sufunción, lo que generó un nuevo entendimiento de la organización social y económica del estado Casma. Los torterosdescubiertos en El Purgatorio también reflejan diferentes grados de estandarización y conocimiento técnico, lo que sugiereque al menos algunos de ellos pueden haber sido fabricados por especialistas en talleres metalúrgicos y cerámicos.

The analysis of spindle whorls and theirarchaeological contexts can reveal informationabout the spinning process itself and provide in­sightsintogenderrolesandthepoliticaleconomiesof prehispanicAndean states (Costin 1993, 1995,1998). We present the study of a collection of 75spindle whorls excavated at the site of El Purga­torio.Followingabriefdescriptionofthesiteandsample,wepresenttheresultsoftheformal(shapeand iconography) and functional (weight and in­ertia)analyses ofthesample.Situatingtheresultswithin the context of the existing literature, weexamine the socioeconomic implications of ourfindingsforthepoliticaleconomyandpresentourinterpretations of the meaning of these objects asgrave goods in regard to gender and status inCasma society. Because the majority of whorlswereuncoveredingravesofwomenandchildren,we conclude that spindle whorls were indicativeof social status (both ascribed and achieved), andpossibly of femininity.
Existing studies of spindle whorl assemblagesfromarchaeologicalsitesin theAndes,especiallytheMochecapitalonthenorthcoastofPeru,offerinsights into the variety of materials, forms, andcontexts associated with the manufacture and use of these objects that can be applied to the samplefromElPurgatorio.AtHuacasdeMoche,Chapde­laine and colleagues(2001) found whorlsina va­rietyofcontexts,includingurbanresidences,pub­licadministrativestructuresadjacenttotheHuacadel Sol, ceramic workshops, and a cemetery(Chapdelaine et al. 2001:797). The authors con­cludedthatspinningofcottonwasubiquitousandoften done in places of social gathering or in do­mesticareas(Chapdelaineetal.2001:799).Usingneutron activation analysis to investigate spindlewhorl production at Huacas de Moche, Chapde­laineandcolleagueswereabletoconfirmthatthespindlewhorlsweremanufacturedinlocalceramicworkshops.Theremayhavebeenseveralspecial­izedworkshopsatHuacasdeMoche,eachfocusedon whorls of differing types (e.g., quality, shape,decoration, etc.; Chapdelaine et al. 2001:802–803), a possibility discussed below for El Purga­torio. They reasoned that Moche women couldhave selected spindle whorls of differing styles and shapes produced at multiple workshops(Chapdelaine et al. 2001:803–804).
Donnan and Mackey’s (1978) sample ofMoche and Chimú spindle whorls from femaleburialsrevealedformalanddesignvariabilitysim­ilartothosefound inthesample fromElPurgato­rio. Shapes included disks, ollas, trumpet bells(herereferredtoasconical),andbiconicalwhorls.The metal whorls made from copper were foundin various states of decay.Whorls made from dif­ferentcoloredstone(green,white,andblack)andfired clay were painted and incised with patternsresembling flowers, intersecting dots and lines,and circles (Donnan and Mackey 1978:369).
Drawingonalargesampleofsitesacrosshigh­land Bolivia spanning the Late Archaic throughLate Horizon periods, Rivera (2014:242) notedthe increased standardization of spinning andweavingtoolsassociatedwiththeriseofTiwanakustate control (see also Costin 1993, 1995). Thecorrelation of state control and craft productionstandardizationobservedinhighlandBoliviadoesnot seem to apply to textile production and therise of the Casma state (as discussed below).Rivera(2014:253–254)alsoassertsthatthestatusandidentityofthetextileproducersprobablycon­tributed to the value of their products, either aseveryday orprestige objects.Thisideais relevantto the data from El Purgatorio discussed below.
In the Chibcha territory of northern SouthAmerica, Dennis O’Neil (1974) focused on themanufacturingtechniquesofstonespindlewhorls.Basedonexaminationofflakescarsandabrasions,he deduced nine manufacturing stages. First alarge,coarseflakewasremovedfromtheoriginalslate using a percussion blow. The edges of theblunt disk­flake were trimmed with heavy blowsuntil the desired diameter and roundness was reached. The craggy edges and sides weresmoothed and rounded again by more grindinguntil the sides were flat and parallel.

Intermsofdecorationandiconographicanaly­sis, Dorothy McMeekin (1992) argued thatMesoamericanandSouthAmericanreverencefor agriculture and plants was expressed in spindlewhorl decoration. In particular, she used spindlewhorlsdisplayingdetailedfloralandfruitanatomyto demonstrate the depth of this tradition(McMeekin 1992:172). Peppers, tomatoes, andsquash fruits were commonly featured, as well asdomesticated cotton in western South America (McMeekin 1992:172).
Beyond the Andes, Carpenter and colleagues(2012:395) examine Classic­period residences inEl Palmillo, Oaxaca, Mexico. These authors pos­tulatethattheeconomicproductionofspuncottonand maguey largely took place in domestic resi­dences. Their sample of 188 whorls provides ev­idence for the spinning of a mix of fibers andvariable participation in the steps of textile­pro­duction process across households.This suggestsa fluid economic model of middle­class domestic production using local resources in multicraftingactivityareas(Carpenteret al.2012:395).AnAn­dean study conducted by Edwards et al. (2008)produced similar results. Based on spindle whorlprovenience and sample size, the authors deter­minethatproductionofcottonyarnwasubiquitousand often took place during social gathering or indomestic residence (Edwards et al. 2008:99).These findings can be used to interpretthe prove­nienceandimplicationsofthewhorlsamplefromEl Purgatorio, as well.
Inomata and colleagues (2002) excavated atthe Maya site ofAguateca (ca.A.D. 800) and re­covered 39 spindle whorls from several com­pounds (Inomata et al. 2002:310). Seven werefound in a room that also contained ceramic ves­sels, storage jars, and a mano and metate. This suggests that the room was used for food prepa­rationandstorage(Inomataetal.2002:308).Otherassemblages included several whorls grouped to­gether,indicatingroomsfortextileproductionlo­cated near those for food preparation (Inomata etal.2002:324).Mostnotablewastheconcentrationof spindle whorls found in a room previouslythoughtofasa “stageforinteractionsanddisplay”(Inomata et al. 2002:326) or political activities.Inomata and colleagues propose that the purposeof the room may have changed before abandon­ment of the site or that women had been presenthere, perhaps participating in political activities(Inomata et al. 2002:326).
Finally, McCafferty and McCafferty (2008)examined a sample of 73 whorls from the site ofSanta Isabel in Nicaragua, measuring height, di­ameter, weight, shape, and hole size (McCaffertyandMcCafferty2008:144).Theirsampleincludedboth modeled whorls and perforated ceramicdisks. Interestingly, these whorls were fairlyevenlydistributedacrosstheexcavationlocations,with no great distinction between the locations ofmodeledversusperforateddisks(McCaffertyandMcCafferty 2008:153). They interpret this evi­dence as showing no functional specialization inspinning technique or quality of thread (McCaf­fertyandMcCafferty2008:153).Asdescribedbe­low,theresultsofourstudypaintquiteadifferentpicture for yarn production and specialization atEl Purgatorio. 

El Purgatorio and the Casma State 
El Purgatorio (Figures 1 and 2) was an importanturbancenterandthecapitalcityoftheCasmastate(ca. A.D. 700–1400), a large coastal polity thatstretchedoveradistanceofapproximately300kmalong the north coast of Peru. The archaeologicalunderstanding of the Casma state has grown sig­nificantlyoverthelastdecadesthroughexcavationsconducted at El Purgatorio (e.g., Cárdenas 1976,1978; Collier 1962; Przadka and Giersz 2003;Silva 1992; Tello 1956; Thompson 1964, 1974;Vogel2003,2011,2012;VogelandPacifico2011)and the secondary sites of Cerro la Cruz (Silva1992; Vogel 2003, 2012) and Ten Ten (Przadka2009).

Spindle Whorls at El Purgatorio 
Between 2006 and 2010, 75 spindle whorls werecollected and analyzed from Sectors A, B, and Cat El Purgatorio. The whorls, many of them withsurfacedesigns,weremanufacturedfromceramicand lithic material, and metal (Vogel et al. 2015).Ceramic and stone spindle whorls were commonin coastal Peru in the Casma and Chimú cultures (e.g.,Chapdelaineetal.2001;DonnanandMackey1978; Millaire1997)and wereusedto spincottonand camelid (llama and alpaca) fibers (e.g., Ed­wards et al. 2008:88). Most spindle whorls foundat El Purgatorio were manufactured from stone (n = 42, 56 percent), and only a small percentagewere made from fired clay (n = 6, 8 percent). Thescarcity of metal spindle whorls in archaeologicalassemblages in northern Peru may be a result ofpreservationandtargetedlooting ofmetalsduringlater periods. Metal spindle whorls also may havebeen a late technological development in prehis­panic fiber production. Twenty­seven of the 75spindle whorls (36 percent) were made of metal(various alloys of copper, lead, etc.; see Vogel etal.2015).Metalspindlewhorlswereusedastoolsand personal adornment at El Purgatorio. Mostwhorls were found in burials (discussed below)strung up on cotton yarn. They may have beenworn around the neck, and it was initially thoughtthat these artifacts were beads. In one case, a cop­per whorl was found on the spindle together withtwo stone whorls (Figure 4).

so that metal spindle whorls were included in ouranalysis only when feasible. It is worth noting,however, that their overall size and shape in theircorroded state remained consistent with that of the stone and ceramic whorls. Based on the con­ditionin whichthe objects were found, they wereincluded in some analyses but not others. For in­stance, a broken decorated whorl would be in­cludedintheiconographicanalysis,butnotinthefunctional analysis. The majority of whorls fromEl Purgatorio (64 of 75) were found in mortuarycontexts. The others were found in both publicand domestic areas. 


FormalAnalysis: Shape and Decoration 
The spindle whorls recovered at El Purgatoriowere analyzed according to their form and func­tion. Of the 75 total whorls, 53 whorls could besortedbyshapeintothefollowingfourcategories:spherical,conical,biconical,disk,andolla­shaped(resemblingaglobularcookingpot;SupplementalFigure 1).An additional category was created forshapes outside these categories (Table 1).The re­maining22whorlsweretoooxidizedtodeterminetheir original shape.
Themostcommonformofspindlewhorlfoundat El Purgatorio was a spherical shape, which rep­resented 30 percent of the spindle whorls analyzed(n = 16; Supplemental Figure 2). Spherical whorlshavealsobeenrecoveredatMocheandChimúsites (e.g., Donnan and Mackey 1978), although theirrelative popularity at coastal sites is difficult togauge.Allrawmaterialsandsurfacedesignoptionsarerepresentedintheanalyzedsampleofsphericalwhorls, which suggests that whorl material, deco­ration, andshape are unrelatedstylisticchoices.

Biconical whorls,shapedasthoughthelargersurfacesoftwoconicalwhorls had been fused, are the second most com­mon form at El Purgatorio and represent 26 per­cent of the spindle whorls studied (n = 14, Figure6).Biconicalwhorlsareusuallylargerandheavierthan whorls of other shapes.Although popular atEl Purgatorio, biconical whorls are less commonin other Andean collections (e.g., Donnan andMackey 1978).
Designed to be flat and circular, disk­shapedwhorls account for 17 percent of the whorls ana­lyzed for shape (n = 9). Disk­shaped whorls canbehomogeneousinthickness,ortapertoanarrowedge with a thicker center (Supplemental Figure4).Theninedisk­shapedwhorlsweresplitalmostevenly between decorated and plain whorls, andalso between metal and nonmetal whorls.

From our sample of 75 spindle whorls, surfacedecorations were observable and studied on 44 whorls. These include the full range of raw ma­terials, proveniences, and designs present at ElPurgatorio. This sample was structured to be asrepresentative of the full collection as possible.The whorls are divided into four categories ac­cording to their surface decoration: tripartite,quadripartite, unique, and plain. The most com­mon design patterns observed are those using in­cisionsto dividethewhorlintoageometricthree­part (tripartite; Figure 8) or four­part(quadripartite; Supplemental Figure 5) design.The incised patterns used to divide the whorlsalso vary between circles, straight lines, and cir­cle­and­dotdesignstypical ofCasmapottery.Ex­amples of tripartite and quadripartite designs arefound across all of the shape categories (disks,spheres, conical, and biconical). The remainingspindle whorls exhibit either unique engraved orpainted designs, or they are considered plain,with discernible surface decoration (Table 2).
Quadripartite whorls are the most common inthe sample (n = 14, 31 percent). In quadripartitewhorls, the central perforation marks the inter­section of two perpendicular dividing lines (Sup­plemental Figure 5). Usually geometric designsfilltwoofthealternatingsections,whiletheothertwo are plain. In the case of quadripartite conicaland biconical whorls that are decorated on onlyone side, the perpendicular lines radiate from thecenter holeuntilthey reach theedge ofthewhorl,but the bottom of the whorl remains plain.
Twelveofthewhorlsintheassemblagehave atripartite design (27 percent). This design couldbe achieved through lines that radiate outwardfrom the central perforation of the whorl, or byplacingtwoevenlyspaced,parallellinesoneitherside of the central perforation. Our sample of tri­partite whorls shows an equal number (n = 6) of each variant. 
The other whorls in the sample either haveunique designs that cover the entire whorl with auniform pattern such as ridges or chevrons (n = 3, 7 percent), or are not decorated at all (n = 15,34 percent).The lack of whorls divided any otherway, such as into two or five sections, suggeststhat the numbers three and four may have carried

some significance in the context of Casma ideol­ogy, iconography, or style.
Since whorls are placed on the bottom of aspindle, leaving only the top visible when thewhorl is in use, it is logical that only one sidewould be decorated. Of the 44 whorls analyzedfor decoration, 16 are plain (36 percent), 17 aredecorated on the top, and 11 are decorated onboth sides (39 percent and 25 percent, respec­tively). The decoration of spindle whorls on bothtopandbottomsurfacesmayindicatethatspindlewhorl design also served as an art form or amethod of symbolic communication, especiallywhen whorls were used in other contexts, for ex­ample,asnecklaces.Duringspinning,whorlsweresometimes stacked on top of one another on thespindle to provide more weight (cf. Barber1991:58),whichresultedinonlythelateralaspectsofthewhorlsremainingvisible.Whorlsdecoratedonlyonthetopsurfacesometimeshaveanincisedline around the circumference of the whorl sepa­rating the top surface from the bottom surface.Typically, this demarcation is observable on bi­conical whorls, which already have a distinct topand bottom surface. The focal points of designsfor the majority of decorated whorls, however,are on the top and bottom surfaces of the whorl,which would be obscured when the whorl is in use. In this way, the designs found on spindlewhorls suggest that the primary opportunity fordisplay may not have been in the context of spin­ning, but under conditions in which the top andbottom surfaces were visible. 
The surface decorations described here are mostly incised (n = 28, 64 percent). It is possiblethatsomeoftheplainwhorlsmayhaveoriginallyhad painted designs that did not preserve. Thepresence of one whorl (2 percent) with a painteddesign (Figure 6) suggests that there may have

been others like it. Fifteen of the 44 whorls ana­lyzed for surface design (34 percent) are catego­rized as plain, meaning that no decoration is visi­ble. Some plain whorls have polished surfaces,suggesting completion without the need for dec­oration.Otherplainwhorlsareunpolished,whichcould be interpreted as unfinished, or perhaps asevidence of a more utilitarian style. Of the 29decorated whorls, about half are decorated onlyon the top surface (n = 17; 59 percent). The restaredecoratedonboththetopandbottomsurfaces(n = 12; 41 percent). Spherical whorls are morelikely to be decorated all over. Of the 16 whorlsidentified as spherical in the previous section,seven are decorated all over (44 percent), but nowhorls from the biconical and conical categoriesare decorated on both the top and bottom.
The form and style of whorls, as expressedthrough their shapes and surface decorations, in­dicate the existence of a particular Casma artisticstyle and whorl technology of the late prehistoricera (Vogel 2011, 2012). The variability of whorlsineachformindicatesthatthereislittletonocor­relation between shape, surface decoration, andraw material. The design of spindle whorls at ElPurgatorio appears to be a method of creative ex­pression and a display of artistic skill on a neces­sary, utilitarian object. 


FunctionalAnalysis: Weight and Inertia 
Variation in functional design of whorls affectsthe quality of the yarn that is produced. Spindlewhorl weights and sizes vary in accordance withtheir intended use, such as the raw material andthe desired thickness of the yarn (Loughran­De­lahunt1996:21).Thesmallerandlighterthewhorl,the thinner the yarn produced. Heavier whorls,without increasing diameter to slow the spin, willstretch the yarn, making it more likely to break(Loughran­Delahunt 1996:55). Spindle whorlweights from around the world range from lessthan1gto150gandareusedtoproducedifferentthicknesses of yarn from different raw materials(Barber 1991). In her study ofAztec women andweaving technology, Brumfiel (1991) classifiedwhorls that weighed 10 g or less as small, andany whorl over 10 g was classified as large. Bar­ber’s(1991:51)cross­culturalcomparisonshowed thatthestandarddiameterforspindlewhorlsusu­ally exceeds 2 cm. Assuming similar weight, thediameter of the whorl determines the thickness and strength of the thread by inducing a faster orslower spin. Larger, slow­spinning whorls createheavy and thick cords with few twists, but faster­spinning whorls with smaller diameters allow formorerotationsperspinduration,producingamoretightly spun, thinner yarn (Barber 1991:57). Fur­thermore, yarn thickness may bealtered based onthe position of the whorl on the spindle. Low­whorl spindles are spun like a top by flicking thefingers, but high­whorl spindles are rolled up anddown the leg with the hand (Barber 1991:43).Spinning conducted at El Purgatorio typically in­volved the drop­spinning technique with low­whorl spindles.
Spinning can also be completed without theuseofawhorl,forexample,withapotatoorspin­ningbowl(e.g.,SmithandHirth1988),butwhorlsare more efficient. Whorls increase the duration of the spin of a spindle, resulting in a thinner,finer yarn.The use of a spindle whorl also allowsfor a more constant spinning speed, which canimprovetheuniformityoftightnessacrossastrandof yarn (Loughran­Delahunt 1996:16). Analysisof the physics and functionality of spindle whorlassemblages can determine the type of yarn pro­ducedand its purposes.Wethereforeconducted afunctional analysis of the subsample of whorlsfrom El Purgatorio to examine the weight, diam­eter, and moment of inertia to determine the kindof yarn produced at the site.
Of the total 75 spindle whorls, 43 ceramic andstonewhorlswereanalyzedwithweightmeasure­ments to the nearest hundredth of a gram and di­ameter measurements to the nearest thousandth of a centimeter (Supplemental Figure 6). Metalwhorlswereexcludedfromthefunctionalanalysisbecause their high levels of oxidation did notallow for accurate measurements. Due to vari­ability in the copper alloys, similarity or pre­dictability of weight cannot be assumed. PXRFanalysis (Vogel et al. 2015) showed that somewhorls contained lead. They would have beenmuch heavier at the time of their production. Be­cause lead deteriorates morequicklythancopper,thesewhorlsarenowlighterthanthosewithhighercopper content. Although none of the copper

whorls could be included in the functional analy­sis, all five of the ceramic spindle whorls and 38of the 42 stone whorls were analyzed.
Barber(1991:52)assertedthatlightweightspin­dle whorls are necessary to process short­staplematerials, such as cotton. She suggested 8 g as anexample of a lightweight spindle whorl, which is.65 g heavierthan theheaviestwhorlfrom ElPur­gatorio. The average weight of the El Purgatoriowhorls is 3.25 g (Supplemental Figure 6). It islikely that these whorls were used for spinningshort­staple Peruvian cotton as opposed to other,longer­staplematerialsthatwouldhaverequiredaheavierwhorl.Abundantevidenceofcottoncloth,thread,andrawcottonatElPurgatoriocorroboratesthis assertion (Vogel 2016). Evidence for camelidfiberatthesiteisrathersparse.Thepredominanceof lightweight spindle whorls indicates a produc­tionfocusonstrong,thincottonyarn.Nevertheless,multiple whorls have been found together on thesame spindle at El Purgatorio, and thicker­stapleraw materials may have occasionally been spunusing multiple lightweight whorls.
The 43 whorls in the sample appear to be dis­tributed relatively evenly across the differentweight categories every .5 g, with the exceptionofwhorlsweighingbetween5.5gand6.5g.Whensorted into smaller weight categories, the sampleshows a bimodal distribution with whorl weightsfavoring both the 1.50–2.24 g and the 4.25–4.49g ranges (Supplemental Figure 6). The bimodaldistributionofwhorlweightmayindicatethattwomaintypesofyarnwereproducedatElPurgatorio:a thinner, finer thread with whorls around 2 g inweight, and a slightly thicker thread from whorlsweighingabout4.5g.Onlythreeofthe43whorls(7 percent) weighed 5.5 g or more.
Whorl diameter is another useful indicator of the quality of yarn produced by a spindle (Sup­plemental Figure 7). The weight pulls the spindledownandensuresrotation,andthewhorldiameterinfluencesthespeedanddurationofthespin.Thelarger the diameter of the whorl, the farther theweight is distributed from the axis, slowing itsspin. At El Purgatorio, whorls measured 2.2 cmin diameter or less, indicating that the spinnersproduced mostly thin, tightly wound yarn. Al­though it is possible that heavier whorls existedto produce thicker yarn, such whorls were not re­covered in our excavations. Stacking multiplespindle whorls with small diameters could resultintheproductionofaslightlythicker,tightlyspunthread. Nonetheless, to spin materials of a longerstaple than Peruvian cotton would have requiredwhorls with a larger diameter.
Because the interplay of the weight and diam­eter of a whorl affects the quality of the yarn, in­dependent measurements of weight and size canbe combined to calculate the moment of inertia,whichisindicativeofwhorlefficiency.Inherdis­sertation, Loughran­Delahunt (1996) studies thephysicsofNorthwestCoastNativeAmericanspin­dlewhorlsbycalculatingtheirmomentsofinertia(the tendency of a body to keep rotating on anaxisataconstantspeed).Usingthesamemethod,the inertia of the whorls inthe ElPurgatorio sam­ple were calculated using the following formula:I=MR2/2, where I is the moment of inertia, M isthemassofthewhorl,andRisitsradius.Ahigherinertia measurement indicates that a whorl can maintain a constant speed for a longer time, thatis, it has a greater spin efficiency.
The inertia measurements of the 43 whorls in our sample range from .126 to 3.377 gcm2 (Sup­plemental Figure 8). Compared with assemblagesfeatured in other studies (including whorls withinertia measurements up to 16,479 gcm2 and av­eraging 4341.4 gcm2 in Loughran­Delahunt 1996),1 the level of moment of inertia amongwhorls from El Purgatorio, which average 1.16 gcm2, is low across the sample. This low level ofmoment of inertia suggests that thin, loosely spunyarn was the most popular variety produced at ElPurgatorio. Although the whorl diameters alonemightsuggestatightlyspunyarn,theinertiamea­surementindicatesthattheyarnwaslooselyspun.Theinclusionofmorevariablesincreasesthecred­ibility of the moment of inertia calculation, whichshouldresultinamoreaccurateinterpretation.Therelatively low inertia of these whorls is consistentwith the idea that Casma whorls were meant for spinningshort­staplecottonfibers;anunsupportedwhorl spinning too quickly could result in brokenthreadwhenprocessingshorter­staplefibers,suchas short­staple Peruvian cotton. The distributionof inertia measurements in our whorl sampledemonstrates that even within the available rangeof low­inertia whorls, whorls with the lowest in­

ertiameasurements(under1.2gcm2)arestillmoreprevalent.Anotherconsiderationnecessaryforthecorrectinterpretationofthesedataisthattheequa­tionusedtocalculate inertia assumes theobject inquestion to be a flat disk. Since many spindlewhorlsincludedinthissubsamplearesphericalorbiconical in shape (with tapered edges), they arenot evenly flat disks. This may mean that theirtrue inertia values are actually slightly lower thanthose provided here (Loughran­Delahunt 1996).The measurements provided here are therefore anapproximation of the efficiency of spindle whorlsused by the spinners of El Purgatorio.
The narrow ranges of diameters, weights, andinertia measurements indicate little variability inyarn quality between whorls.There appears to besome correlation between whorl material and the type of yarn it was designed to produce. Ceramicwhorls produced relatively thin, loose thread, butstone whorls produced awidervariety of threads.Ceramic spindle whorls were found only amongthelowerhalfoftheinertiameasurements,rangingfrom.184 to1.883gcm2,exhibitingalower aver­age inertia than their stone counterparts (averageinertia of ceramic whorls: .909 gcm2; average in­ertia of stone: 1.189 g/cm2). This variation maybe intentional, or it may result from the smallernumber ofceramicwhorlsinour sample(fivece­ramic as compared to 38 stone whorls). It is diffi­culttodeterminewhetherthechoiceofwhorlma­terial was determined by the desired threadthickness, available resources, or was purely astylistic decision. Indeed, all of these factors mayhaveplayedaroleinthedesignofspindlewhorls.
In sum, functional analysis revealed a preva­lence of lightweight, low­inertia whorls with rel­ativelystableweightanddiametermeasurements.Theseresultssuggestapreferenceforthin,looselyspun yarn as opposed to tightly wound threads.Nonetheless, it is important to note that the 84excavationunitsatElPurgatoriocontainedalmostentirely more elaborate whorls in terms of deco­ration and quality of raw materials, unlike theplainer whorls found at the site of Cerro la Cruz(Vogel 2012:134, Figure 5.27). It seems likelythatthe residents ofEl Purgatorio whoused moreelaborate whorls produced a more delicate yarnthan people using plain whorls at outlying settle­ments, an intriguing hypothesis that remains tobe investigated. 


Socioeconomic Implications 
Theformalandfunctionalanalysespresentedhere,when combined with the whorl contexts and our understanding of prehispanic Andean societies,havenewimplicationsfor interpretingCasma so­cialidentitiesandeconomicorganization.Asmen­tioned above, spinning is a quotidian activity thatoftenoccurredinareaswhereotheractivitiestook place. Elsewherespindle whorls havebeenfoundindomesticareas,publicareas,andmortuarycon­texts. In contrast, at El Purgatorio spindle whorlswere found predominantly in burials.
Of the 84 excavation units in sectors A, B,and C, 14 units yielded spindle whorls. Of thetotal 75 whorls uncovered at El Purgatorio, 64whorls (85 percent) were found in the Sector Ccemeteries as grave goods (Table 3). The other11 whorls (15 percent) were found in residentialand public architectural spaces.Ofthose11,onlytwo were found in Sector B, the commoner resi­dential area. The other nine were distributed across seven compounds:A1 (n = 2),A3 (n = 1), A6 (n = 2),AAS3PA1 (n = 1), C4 (n = 1), C5 (n = 1), and CAS5 (n = 1). Two whorls were foundin areas used for ceremonial purposes, and onewas found in the ceramic workshop. The otherswere found in domestic areas, often associatedwith foodpreparation.These varied locationsareconsistent with data from other sites suggestingthat spinning was aubiquitous activity in theAn­des that was often performed while doing otherthings (e.g., Costin 1993:6; Moseley 2001:74;Silverblatt 1987:9).
Themajorityofthewhorlswerefoundinburialcontexts.Thishighlyunevendistributionofwhorlsbetweenarchitectural andmortuarycontextssug­gests that spindle whorls were valued objects.Two of the 11 whorls found in architectural con­texts are broken, and one is made of poorly firedclay.Thisleadsustoproposethattheywererarelylost and were considered of significant value forinclusion as a grave good.Their presence in buri­alsalso suggeststhatwhorlswerepersonalitems.Rather than pass them on to children or otherloved ones, they were taken to the grave with thedeceased.Thesefindingssuggestthatwhorlswereso important to spinners that they were oftenburied with their owner instead of passed down,sold, or traded.

Allofthemetalwhorlswerefoundinmortuarycontexts,althoughburialsalsocontainedstoneandceramic whorls. As mentioned above, we arguethat whorls may have been used both as spinningweights and as items of personal adornment, atleastindeath.Ofthe64whorlsfoundintheceme­teries of Sector C, 38 whorls were found in directassociation with an intact burial (the rest were infill)andoftenshowedsignsofhavingbeenstrungtogether. These 38 whorls were collected fromnine graves: five adult females, one adult male,and three children. The male had only one whorl,anditwasmetal.Incontrast,thechildrenhadtwo,three,orfourwhorls,andthefemaleshadasmanyas eight whorls (Table 3). Because whorls are al­mostexclusivelyassociatedwithwomenandchil­dren (whose sex cannot be determined), they ap­peartohavebeengenderedobjects.Ifgravegoodsare often a reflection of a person’s activities inlife, the gender identity of spindle whorl users orconsumers can be inferred from the predominantassociation of whorls with female burials. Ethno­graphic and ethnohistorical documentation (e.g.,Costin 1993, 1995, 1998; Murra 1962; Silverblatt1987) show that textile production tended to be afemale task in the prehispanic Andes, althoughmendidparticipateintextileproductionoccasion­ally. Children likely learned to spin, although thepresence of whorls in the burials of two infants(CCM1U7F1 and CCM1U9F5) who were clearlytooyoungtospinindicatesthatonecouldbeburiedwith spindle whorls before one could actually usethem, suggesting that whorls may have been anindicatorofstatus,wealth,orperhapsevenoffem­ininegender(althoughthisideamustremainspec­ulative). The lack of spindle whorls in five out ofsix adult male burials at El Purgatorio suggeststhat this artifact type was not strongly associated with men, and supports the assertion that womenwere the primary recipients of spindle whorls asofferings.
It also seems possible that whorls were an in­dicator of wealth or status more than age orachievement, since the children have multiplewhorlsbut theadult male had onlyone. It is diffi­cult to know whether whorls were worn as con­spicuous signs of status in daily life or only indeath.Sinceourevidencecomesfromburials,wecannot say for certain that spindle whorls werewornasnecklaceswhiletheownerwasalive.The burials at El Purgatorio tend to reflect an inter­mediate class (rather than the highest elites ortrulypoorcommoners)basedontheirgravegoods.Because whorls interred with burials would be taken out of circulation for productive purposes,we argue that the number and type of whorls (es­peciallymetalwhorls)mayalsoreflectthewealthorstatusoftheinterred.Theproductionoftextilesplayed an important role in Andean economiesfor thousands of years (as prestige goods and in­dicators of elite status) (e.g., Costin 1993, 1995;Murra1962),andtheremayhavebeensomepres­tige or status associated with elaborately workedspindle whorls like those found at El Purgatorio.
ThespindlewhorlsfromElPurgatorioalsoof­ferinsightintoproductionpracticesandeconomicorganization in the Casma polity. Although thenarrow range of diameters and weights reflectsthe predominance of cotton as the raw materialfor thread in this society, the high variability ofwhorls in this assemblage in terms of whorl ma­terial, shapes, and decorations suggests that thereweremultiplemanufacturersforthesewhorls.Thefactthattheyaremadeofthreedifferentmaterialsindicates a minimum of three workshops for cre­ating stone, ceramic, and metal implements. Thehigh quality of these whorls also suggests thattheywereproducedbyskilledworkers,whowereabletocreatelow­inertiawhorlsforspinningcot­ton. In our view, the plethora of shapes and deco­rative elements, combined with the range of rawmaterials, suggests that whorls were likely pro­duced by several different manufacturers, eitherinhouseholdindustriesorinstate­controlledwork­shops (such as the ceramic workshop found inthe monumental Sector A at El Purgatorio; seeVogel2011,2016).Relativelylittleisknownabouttheprocessofcraftingspindlewhorls,butO’Neil’s

(1974) study of stone spindle whorls from theChibchaterritoryofnorthernSouthAmericahigh­lights the need for an extensive set of tools andconsiderabletechnologicalknowledgetoproducewhorls in an assortment of shapes and designs.As mentioned above, Chapdelaine et al. (2001)found evidence for Moche whorl production inspecialized workshops, as well.
Spindlewhorlstudiescanalsogiveindicationsof economic structures that regulate or controlwhorl production and distribution. For example,at Classic period sites in Oaxaca, Carpenter et al.(2012)describetheproductionofspuncottonandmaguey as taking place mostly in domestic resi­dences under a fluid economic model of produc­tion using localresources,butmarkedbyinterde­pendence and specialization. Smith and Hirth(1988) also document increased specialization inMesoamericancottontextileproduction,suggest­ingthattherisein “speciallymanufactured” spin­dle whorls during the Epiclassic period in centralMexicoindicatesanincreaseindemandandscale of cotton production for finer textiles (Smith andHirth 1988:355).
In a similar fashion, the data described heremayalsoprovide some insightsintoCasma polit­ical economy, at least where spindle whorls areconcerned. The lack of standardization of whorls mayindicatethattheirproductionanddistributionwere not tightly controlled by elites. In otherwords, whorls may have been freely traded andcirculated amongst the populace without muchstate oversight. This certainly seems reasonablefor stone and ceramic whorls, given the easy ac­cessibility of their raw materials. But access tocopper and lead as well as the metallurgical tech­nology to produce the metal whorls may havebeenmorecloselyattachedtostatecontrol(Vogelet al. 2015). The presence of copper whorls inburials may indicate a manner of payment or re­ward to women for their service to the state, per­haps even for their production of textiles (seeVo­gel 2016 for further discussion of economicorganization at El Purgatorio). Of course, the useof artifact frequency as an indicator of economicpatternsandtransitionsisnotuniquetothisanaly­sis. Brumfiel (1991) used the frequency of differ­ent Aztec spindle whorls across time periods asevidence for a proposed shift in the traditionaleconomy. The ideas proposed here will need to beinvestigatedfurtherasthestudyofCasmasitescontinues. 


Conclusion 
There is much to be learned from the careful ex­amination of spindle whorls, especially when alargesamplefromcontrolledexcavationsisavail­able.Inadditiontoexaminingthetechnicalaspectsof spindle whorls as tools for making yarn, thisstudy sought to identify the manufacturers andusers of the whorls, as well as other meanings oruses of these artifacts. The El Purgatorio sampleis especially intriguing for its diversity of materi­als, shapes, and decorations. In addition to theirtraditional function of spinning yarn, spindlewhorls may indicate gender identities, genderedtasks, expressions of wealth or status, and a lackof state­controlled production. This case studyfrom El Purgatorio is intended as a model for in­vestigating textile production in late prehistoricPeruandasamoreholisticwaytoapproachtheseartifactassemblagesaroundtheglobeandinvary­ing time periods.

Moreover, they are nearly an order of magni­tude larger in diameter and can have masses 100 times thoseof the El Purgatorio samples. Because of the incredible differ­ences in size, a clear distinction in the kind of materials thatwere spun and the thickness of the product is obvious.
