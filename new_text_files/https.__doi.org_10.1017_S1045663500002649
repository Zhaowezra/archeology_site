THE OCCUPATIONAL HISTORY OF GALINDO, 
MOCHE VALLEY, PERU 

Gregory D. Lockard 
The archaeological site of Galindo, located in the Moche Valley, is one of the most important Late Moche (ca. A.D. 600­800) centers on the North Coast of Peru. The site was once thought to have been occupied only after the nearby Huacas de Moche, the paramount Middle Moche (ca. A.D. 300-600) center in the valley, was abandoned. Recent radiocarbon dates from the Huacas de Moche, however, indicate that it continued to be occupied well into the eighth century A.D. This paper presents data on the occupational history of Galindo recently obtained during the Galindo Archaeological Project (GAP). These data, along with similar data from the Huacas de Moche, present a new understanding of the occupational history of the Moche Valley during the first half of the Middle Horizon (A.D. 600-1000 ). 
El sitio arqueol6gico de Galindo, ubicado en el valle de Moche, es uno de los centros Moche Tardio (ca. 600-800 d.C.) mds importante en la costa norte del Peru. El sitio era antes pensado haber sido ocupado solamente despues def sitio cercano de las Huacas de Moche, el centro principal Moche Media (ca. 300-600 d.C) en el valle,fue abandonado. Fechas radiocarb6nicas recientes de las Huacas de Moche, sin embargo, indican que lo continuaba estar ocupado bien entrado el siglo octavo d.C. Este articulo presenta datos sabre la historia ocupacional de Galindo recientemente obtenido durante def Proyecto Arque­ol6gico Galindo (GAP). Estos datos, )unto con datos similares de las Huacas de Moche, presentan una comprensi6n nueva sabre la historia ocupacional de! valle de Moche durante la primera mitad del Horizonte Media (600-1000 d.C.). 
he prehistory of the Moche Valley, located Ton the North Coast of Peru, has been exten­sively researched over the past century (Bawden 1977; Billman 1996; Brennan 1978; Don­nan and Mackey 1978; Kroeber 1926, 1930; Mose­ley and Cordy-Collins 1990; Moseley and Day 1982; Moseley and Mackey 1974; S. Pozorski 1976; T. Pozorski 1976; T. Topic 1977; Uceda et al. 1997, 1998, 2000; Uhle 1913). This research includes surveys of the lower and middle valleys and numerous site-specific projects, many of which have included extensive excavations. As a result of this research, we now know a great deal about the valley's occupational history. There are two prob­lems, however, with our current know ledge of this issue. First, the valley's occupational history is con­ceptualized only in terms of ceramic phases. Although the relative chronology of these phases is well established, in most cases the absolute dates traditionally assigned to them are not supported by chronometric dates (e.g., Chapdelaine 2001, 2003 ). Second, there is a considerable gap in the valley's presumed absolute chronology during the Middle Horizon (AD. 600-1000). 
The Huacas de Moche is believed to have been the capital of a multi-valley polity during the fifth and sixth centuries AD. (e.g., Bawden 1996; Shi­mada 1994). In the past, the site was believed to have been abandoned around AD. 600. This inter­pretation was based on the fact that the majority of the diagnostic ceramics from the final occupational levels at the site correspond to Phase IV in Larco's (1948) sequence of Moche stirrup spout bottles (traditionally assigned to the fifth and sixth cen­turies AD.; e.g., Shimada 1994, Table 1). The nearby site of Galindo was thought to have devel­oped into a major political center sometime after AD. 600, and abandoned around AD. 750 (Baw­den 1977, 1996; Shimada 1994). This was due to the fact that the majority of diagnostic ceramics

recovered from the site correspond to Phase V in Larco's (1948) sequence (traditionally assigned to the seventh and eighth centuries A.D. ). There is then a gap in the occupational history of the Moche Val­ley from around A.D. 7 50 to the founding of Chan Chan in approximately A.D. 900 (J. Topic and Moseley 1983). 
In the last few years, radiocarbon dates from the Huacas de Moche have called into question the presumed absolute chronology of the Moche Val­ley during the first half of the Middle Horizon. These dates indicate that the urban zone at the Hua­cas de Moche was occupied until at least A.D. 700 (Chapdelaine 1998, 2001, 2003). Few MochePhase V ceramics, however, have been recovered from the site. The late radiocarbon dates and absence of Phase V ceramics at the Huacas de Moche can be explained by one of the two following hypotheses: 
1. 
The Phase V occupation of Galindo was much later than previously thought, ranging from some­time after A.D. 700 to the founding of Chan Chan in around AD. 900. If this is the case, Galindo still postdates the Huacas de Moche and the gap between A.D. 750 and 900 in the traditional absolute chronology of the Moche Valley is elim­inated; or 

2. 
Galindo was occupied at the same time as the Huacas de Moche. Phase IV ceramics from the Huacas de Moche would therefore be at least partly contemporaneous with Phase V ceramics from Galindo. If this is the case, then (a) the Phase V occupation of Galindo overlaps with but persists beyond the abandonment of the Huacas de Moche until the founding of Chan Chan; (b) there was no major center in the Moche Valley after the aban­donment of the Huacas de Moche and Galindo and before the founding of Chan Chan; or (c) Chan Chan was founded significantly earlier than A.D. 


900. 
The evaluation of these hypotheses requires data on the occupational history of the three major cen­ters in the Moche Valley occupied during the Mid­dle Horizon: the Huacas de Moche, Galindo, and Chan Chan. Recent ceramic analyses and associ­ated chronometric dates from the Huacas de Moche have greatly enhanced our understanding of the site's occupational history (Chapdelaine 1998, 2001, 2003 ). This paper presents similar data con­cerning the occupational history of Galindo. 
The Archaeological Site of Galindo 
The archaeological site of Galindo is located in the Moche Valley on the North Coast of Peru (Figure 1). Like other rivers on the North Coast, the Moc he River flows westward from the Andes to the Pacific Ocean. In its upper courses, the river is closely flanked by mountains of decreasing altitude, and ultimately hills. Eventually, the river emerges from these hills at the valley neck approximately 20 km from the Pacific Ocean. Cerro Oreja marks the south bank and Cerro Galindo marks the north bank of the valley neck. The archaeological site of Galindo is located at the base of the latter. 
The site of Galindo is characterized by a num­ber of topographical features (Figure 2). The dom­inant features are two large hills: Cerro Galindo and Cerro Muerto. Cerro Muerto lies to the northwest of Cerro Galindo. Upon its slopes is the Quebrada del Norte, and located between Cerro Muerto and Cerro Galindo is the Quebrada Caballo Muerto and its three main tributaries. Lying to the west of Cerro Galindo and to the south of Cerro Muerto is a fan­shaped alluvial plain, which is divided into unequal portions by the outwash channel of the Quebrada Caballo Muerto. The site of Galindo covers the lower slopes of Cerro Galindo and Cerro Muerto and the fan-shaped alluvial plain in between, an area of approximately six square kilometers. 
Physical features and cultural features (i.e., walls and ditches) divide the site of Galindo into at least six distinct zones (Figure 2). According to Bawden ( 1977, l 982a), architectural remains within each of these zones are relative! y homogenous and func­tionally differentiated from that of other areas of the site. The following is a list and brief descrip­tion of the six functionally differentiated zones identified by Bawden at Galindo: 
1. 
Hillside A (the lower slopes of Cerro Galindo): Hillside A is separated from the alluvial plain below by Ditch A and Wall A. Based on the existence of architecture built on top of Ditch A and associated with Wall A, the former appears to pre­date the latter. Architecture on Hillside A is mostly residential; 

2. 
HillsideB (the lower slopes of Cerro Muerto ): Architecture on Hillside B is located along the flanks of the Quebrada de! Norte and its tributaries. Most of the structures appear to have been storage facilities;

Figure 1. Principal archaeological sites in the Moche Valley. 
3. 
Hillside C (the terraced flanks of the trunk of the Quebrada Caballo Muerto and its tributaries): Hillside C is separated from the rest of the site by the steep bluffs of Cerro Galindo and Cerro Muerto. Most of the structures on Hillside C appear to have been storage facilities; 

4. 
Plain Al (the northeast third of the portion of the alluvial plain to the northwest of the outwash channel of the Quebrada Caballo Muerto ): Plain A 1 is dominated by large structures known as cer­caduras, of which there are three (Cercaduras A­C). These structures, which are only found in this zone of the site, contain very little domestic refuse and appear to be administrative in function. Plain A 1 also contains residential structures, many of which appear to be associated with the cercaduras; 

5. 
PlainA2 (the southwest two thirds of the por­tion of the alluvial plain to the northwest of the out­wash channel of the Quebrada Caballo Muerto): Architecture on Plain A2 is mostly residential; and 

6. 
Plain B (the portion of the alluvial plain to the southeast of the outwash channel of the Que­brada Caballo Muerto): Plain Bis separated from Hillside A by Ditch A and Wall A. Two platform 


mound complexes (the Huaca de las Abejas and the Huaca de las Lagartijas) and two smaller platforms (Platforms C and D) are located on Plain B. Plat­form mounds are not found in any other zone at Galindo. Plain B therefore appears to be civic/cer­emonial in function. 
The Galindo Archaeological Project 
This paper presents data obtained during the Galindo Archaeological Project (GAP). The GAP, directed by the author, took place over the course of three field seasons. The initial field season took place in June and July of 2000. Fieldwork involved the excavation of a stratigraphic cut (Stratigraphic Cut 101) across the large wall (Wall A) that extends along the base of Cerro Galindo, excavations in two low-status Moche residences (Structures 39 and 40), and an informal survey of the entire site (Lockard 200 1). The second field season took place in July and August of 2001. Fieldwork involved excavations in two high-status Moche residential structures (Structures 41 and 42) and Platform B and Terrace 2a of the Huaca de las Lagartijas

(Structures 43, 44, and 45) within the plazas of the Huaca de las Abejas. 
The principal goal of the GAP was to study the political power of Galindo's Late Moche rulers and to compare it to that of rulers at antecedent and con­temporary centers on the North Coast of Peru. In order to accomplish this goal, a determination of exactly when Galindo was occupied compared to these other Moc he centers was required. As a result, a secondary (although equally important) goal of the GAP was to reconstruct the occupational his­tory of the site. This paper presents the results of this aspect of the GAP. The results of the study of the political power of Galindo's Late Moche rulers will be published elsewhere. 
Previous research at Galindo indicated that the site had both Moche and Chimu occupations (Baw­den 1977). Before the GAP, however, the duration and absolute dates associated with the Moche and Chimu occupations were unclear. These issues were addressed during the GAP viaceramic analy­sis, the excavation of a stratigraphic cut, and the radiocarbon analysis of samples recovered from both Moche and Chimu contexts at Galindo. 
Relative Dating 
Ceramics 
The most useful artifacts for the relative dating of archaeological sites on the North Coast of Peru are ceramics. In the Moche Valley, ceramics, and espe­cially finewares, underwent significant changes from their first appearance around 2000 B.C. until the Spanish conquest of Peru in A.D. 1532. As in other parts of the world, changes in ceramic tech­nology and decoration have been utilized to divide the prehistory of the Moche Valley and the North Coast as a whole into various archaeological cul­tures and/or phases. In most cases, these cultures and phases are thought to also be culturally and/or politically significant. 
The majority of temporally diagnostic surface ceramics at Galindo and those recovered during excavations at the site are Moche Phase V in form and/or decorative style (Bawden 1977; Lockard 2005:105-106). Surface ceramics that are charac­teristically Middle Moche are present at the site, but confined to the northern portion of the lower slopes of Cerro Galindo (Hillside A). To date, no structures associated with significant quantities of Middle Moche ceramics have been excavated at Galindo. Ceramics characteristic of the Chimu cul­ture (ca. A.D. 900-14 70) have also been recovered from Galindo (Lockard 2005: 110-111 ). These ceramics are confined to residential structures located in the southern half of Hillside A. 
Moche Ceramics. The most ubiquitous tempo­rally diagnostic artifacts at Galindo are Moche fine­line ceramics. Moche fineline ceramics are characterized by dark ochre slip paint applied with fine brush strokes to a light slip background (Don­nan and McClelland 1999) or, less commonly, vice versa. 1 During the GAP, 246 Moche fineline sherds were encountered (217 after refits) (Figure 3). All of the civic/ceremonial contexts and most of the res­idential contexts excavated during the GAP are strongly associated with this ware (Table 1).2 
The most common Moche fineline vessel form is the stirrup spout bottle. Based on changes in the morphology of these vessels, and especially their spouts, the Moche culture can be divided into five phases (Larco 1948). During the GAP, 17 stirrup spout fragments were encountered. Only one of these fragments, however, includes the entire spout. The spout is tapered, which is characteristic of Phase V (Figure 3a). Another vessel form that has formal attributes that vary by phase is the florero (Bawden 1977:311), also known as the "flaring bowl" (e.g., Donnan and McClelland 1999). Phase Vfloreros tend to be taller and have smaller bases than those of earlier phases. They also tend to have rims that are notched in a step pattern (Donnan and McClelland 1999: 146; "castellated" in Bawden's 1977:311 terminology). When the rims offloreros are flat, a painted repeating step motif usually takes the place of the notched step pattern (Lockard 2005:296). Bawden has demonstrated that bowls with step-notched rims are also characteristic of Phase V at Galindo (1977:311). All of the diag­nosticflorero and bowl fragments recovered from Moche contexts during the GAP are characteristic of Phase V. 
The designs on Moche finelines also vary to some degree by phase. In general, Phase V designs are more crowded and complex and utilize thinner lines than those of earlier phases (Bawden 1977:306; Donnan and McClelland 1999:152). In addition, the stirrups and spouts of Phase V vessels are more frequently decorated with painted designs

than those of Phase I-IV vessels (Bawden 1977:306; Donnan and McClelland 1999:168). Finally, the colors of the slip paints utilized to dec­orate Phase V vessels are often different from those of earlier phases as a result of differences in firing. The dark slip of Phase V vessels is often gray or black rather than red, and the light slip is often gray-white rather than cream (Donnan and McClel­land 1999:162). The vast majority of Moche fine­lines recovered from Galindo have designs characteristic of Phase V (Lockard 2005: 105-106). 
A wide variety of utilitarian wares were pro­duced by the Moche, including jars, bowls, ollas, and cantaros. As Theresa Topic (1977) demon­strated in her study of thousands of sherds from sev­eral stratigraphic cuts at the Huacas de Moche, however, changes through time in these Moche wares were minimal in the Moche Valley. In fact, few differences have been found between the util­itarian wares of the Moche culture and those of the preceding Gallinazo Phase in the Moche Valley (Billman 1996:293). Moche utilitarian wares there­fore tend to be of little use in distinguishing between Early, Middle, and Late Moche occupations. The analysis of thousands of domestic ware sherds recovered during the GAP failed to encounter any temporally diagnostic attributes for Moche utili­tarian wares at Galindo. 3 Utilitarian wares from Moche contexts, however, do differ significantly from those from Chimu contexts.

icant differences are a reduction in the number of forms present, different proportions of vessel, neck, and rim forms, and paste color or firing atmosphere (Schleher and Lockard 2003). Most of the utilitar­ian wares recovered from Moche contexts during the GAP were fired in an oxidizing atmosphere (resulting in sherds with red or orange paste), while most of those recovered from Chimu contexts were fired in a reducing atmosphere (resulting in sherds with gray or black paste). 
Galindo Atypical Ceramics. During his work at Galindo, Bawden (1977:333-354, 1987, 1994) identified five ceramic types that were not previ­ously documented anywhere on the North Coast of Peru. Most of these "Galindo Atypical" ceramics were found in association with Moche Phase V ceramics. Three of the Galindo Atypical vessel types have mold-impressed designs and two are undecorated. The decorated types are necked jars, square bowls, and double-chambered vessels. The undecorated types are angle-rimmed bowls and polished shallow bowls. All of the Galindo Atypi­cal ceramics identified by Bawden are graywares, indicating that they were fired in a reducing atmos­phere. None of the ceramics identified by Bawden utilized decorative techniques other than mold impressions. 
During the analysis of sherds recovered during the GAP from undisturbed contexts, 33 sherds were classified as Galindo Atypical ceramics . Necked jars, square bowls, and angle-rimmed bowls are represented in this sample (Figure 4). Most of the Galindo Atypical ceramics were recov­ered from residential contexts associated with Moche Phase V ceramics (Table 1 ). Although the proportion of Galindo Atypical sherds within each residence varies considerably, the ware does not seem to be associated with a particular status group or location within the site (Bawden 1977, 1987, 1994; Lockard 2005 :Appendix 3 ). The absence of Galindo Atypical sherds from some of the resi­dences that contained Moche Phase V ceramics, however, suggests that there may be some tempo­ral difference between the wares. If this is the case, Galindo Atypical ceramics were probably intro­duced after Moche Phase V ceramics. This assumption is in fact supported by the vertical dis­tribution of the wares in Stratigraphic Cut 101 (see below). Residences in which Phase V ceramics are present and Galindo Atypical ceramics are

Several sherds were encountered during the GAP that have mold-impressed designs similar or identical to those of Galindo Atypical ceramics but were fired in an oxidizing rather than a reducing atmosphere. At least one of these sherds is also

embellished with white slip paint (Figure 4c ). These sherds appear to represent an early style of the Galindo Atypical ware, in which mold-impressed designs appear on vessels fired in a manner char­acteristic of Moche ceramics. The majority of Galindo Atypical ceramics encountered during the GAP have darker paste than Moche ceramics, although they are not as uniformly dark as Chimu ceramics. Often, the paste color is not consistent across the vessel, being considerably darker in some locations than others. This appears to indicate experimentation in the firing of pottery in a reduc­ing atmosphere (Schleher and Lockard 2003). While reduced wares were made by the Moche at sites other than Galindo, this firing technique was confined to a very small number of highly polished finewares made by skilled artisans. Galindo Atyp­ical ceramics are considerably more rudimentary than these Moche blackwares. 
Little is known concerning the origin and dis­tribution of Galindo Atypical ceramics. Presently, they have only been documented at one other loca­tion. Pimentel and Paredes (2003, Figure 9.23) encountered sherds similar in design if not tech­nology to Galindo Atypical wares at a series of small sites located along prehistoric roads on the Pampa Colorada, located between the Santa and Chao valleys. The sherds were found along with

Moche fineline sherds with Phase V designs iden­tical to those documented at Galindo (Lockard 2005:309-310). 
Chimu Ceramics. During the excavation of sev­eral structures in Area 307 on Hillside A, it became apparent that the structures were not occupied dur­ing the Moche culture. The vast majority of the sherds recovered from these contexts are reduced wares. Although blackwares were produced by the Moche, they were much more commonly produced by the Chimu. Several of the blackware sherds con­tained mold-impressed designs, including "piel de ganzo," which are also characteristic of the Chimu culture. One sherd is a jar neck containing an applique figure with Chimu or Lambayeque attrib­utes (Figure 5b ). In addition, the residences con­tained ceramics with forms different from those recovered from Moche contexts at Galindo. The most common vessel forms are ollas with carinated necks (Figure 5a), large and small ollas with short everted necks and solid handles (Figure 5c-d), and plates (Figure 5e-f). These forms compare favor­ably with Late Chimu (ca. AD. 1300--1470) ceram­ics from Chan Chan (J. Topic and Moseley 1983, Figures 4a and 4b). 
During the analysis of sherds recovered from undisturbed contexts, 77 sherds were classified as Chimu. All but two of these sherds were recovered from one of three residences excavated in the south­ern portion of Hillside A (Structures 47, 48, and 49) or Stratigraphic Cut 10 1 (Table 1). One of the other two sherds was encountered in Terrace 2a (Area 202) of the Huaca de las Lagartijas. The sec­ond sherd was recovered from Structure 41 (Area 203), which is located in an enclosed elite resi­dential area (the Quebrada Terrace) on Plain Al. The vast majority of temporally diagnostic sherds from these two structures are Moche Phase V. The two Chimu sherds from these contexts are there­fore most likely intrusive. 
Other Temporally Diagnostic Ceramics. During the excavation of Unit 1 of Stratigraphic Cut 101, two sherds were encountered in the lower levels of the stratigraphy that are diagnostic of earlier cul­tures. The first sherd is similar to those documented at Cupisnique sites in the Moche Valley (Figure 6a). Cupisnique (or Guafiape Phase, ca. 1800-400 B.C. in the Moche Valley) ceramics were produced sev­eral hundred years before the Moche occupation of Galindo (Billman 1996). The second sherd is typ­ical of the Gallinazo culture (ca. A.D. 1-200 in the Moche Valley; Figure 6c ), which also predates the Moche occupation of Galindo. Similar vessels con­tinued to be produced by the Moche. At Galindo, however, other sherds of this type have not been documented. The possible Cupisnique and Galli­nazo sherds may be isolated objects deposited at Galindo before its principal occupation. An alter­native explanation is that they were picked up from other sites and brought to Galindo by the Moche. Caballo Muerto and Cerro Oreja, the largest sites in the Moche Valley during the Guafiape and Gal­linazo phases, respectively, are in fact both located near Galindo. 
In addition, two Cajamarca sherds were encoun­tered in Structure 42 (Area 204) on the Quebrada Terrace (Figure 6b). Access to the Quebrada Ter­race is highly restricted and characterized by the presence of the most elite residential architecture found at Galindo (Bawden 1977, 1982b). As a result, these Cajamarca sherds probably represent imported tradewares. Out of a sample of 4,296 sherds encountered during the GAP, these are the only two sherds characteristic of a highland cul­ture. Bawden recovered over 23,000 sherds during his work at Galindo and did not report any high­land ceramics. At the Late Moche site of San Jose de Moro, Cajamarca wares, along with Nivieria wares from the Central Coast, are common. These wares, however, have largely been recovered from elite burials. The small number of foreign wares recovered from Galindo by Bawden and during the GAP may be the result of the fact that most of these ceramics were recovered from residential and civic/ceremonial contexts rather than elite burials. An alternative explanation for the lack of foreign wares at Galindo is that its inhabitants had a very different relationship with foreign societies than the elites buried at San Jose de Moro. Galindo rulers appear to have attempted, in the end unsuccessfully, to maintain the traditional political ideology of Middle Moche rulers from the Southern Moche Region (Lockard 2005). At San Jose de Moro, on the other hand, Late Moche rulers adopted certain aspects of the political ideologies of foreign cul­tures from the highlands and Central Coast (Castillo 200 1, 2003).

tional history of Galindo, one of the goals of the GAP was to excavate a stratigraphic cut in an area with deep deposits. Unfortunately, however, such deposits are rare at Galindo. The architectural ter­races on HillsidesA-C generally have single occu­pational surfaces, which are buried only by wall fall and thin colluvial deposits. The architecture of Plains A and B also tend to have single occupational surfaces, which are buried only by wall fall and thin aeolian deposits. When multiple floors are present, they are generally directly on top of each other or separated by only a very thin layer of sedimentary fill. 
During an informal survey of Galindo in 2000, only one area of the site was found to have signif­icant stratigraphic deposits. This area is directly behind Wall A. Wall A is the largest wall at Galindo, averaging 3.5 meters in height and 2 meters in base thickness. The wall extends for approximately 900 meters along the lower slopes of Cerro Galindo. Its location on a sloped surface below the dense resi­dential architecture of Hillside A makes the area behind it ideal for stratigraphic excavation. Artifacts and colluvial deposits eroding from Hillside A have slowly accumulated behind the wall ever since its initial construction, creating a record of the occu­pational history of the site from the time the wall was constructed to the site's final abandonment. In addition, surface ceramics and ceramics recovered from excavations indicate that the earliest and lat­est occupations of the site were located on Hillside 
A. For all these reasons, a stratigraphic cut was excavated behind Wall A during the 2000 field sea­son of the GAP. 
Unit 1, Stratigraphic Cut 101. Several factors played a role in deciding where behind Wall A to locate Stratigraphic Cut 101. First, the cut is located in a topographical depression, where colluvial deposits are deepest. Second, it is located downhill from and between the small Middle Moche occu­pation to the north and the Chimu occupation to the south. Third, it is located directly adjacent to a

very deep looter's pit. This allowed for an exami­nation of the stratigraphy before excavation. The profile of the looter's pit revealed a complex stratig­raphy composed of alternating layers of colluvial sediment and adobe melt from the wall. These strata are highly irregular and amorphous (Figure 7). As a result, the stratigraphic cut was excavated in arbi­trary 10 cm levels instead of by natural strata. Unit l of Stratigraphy Cut 10 1 extends from the looter's pit to Wall A. This unit was originally a 2 by 4.5 meter excavation. After the excavation of Unit 1, the stratigraphic cut was extended across Wall A and onto the hillside below. This extension (Unit 2) was a 1 by 4 meter excavation. As significant stratigraphic deposits were only encountered behind the wall, only the excavation of Unit 1 is herein described. 
Few artifacts were recovered during the exca­vation of the first four levels of Unit 1, which were composed of colluvial deposits and adobe melt from Wall A. A poorly preserved bench surface (mostly clean of cultural materials) was encoun­tered during the excavation of Level 5, after which excavation occurred only in the 2 by 2.5 meters to the east of the bench. Beginning in Level 8, collu­vial deposits and adobe melt were mixed with sub­stantial cultural fill. A significant ash deposit was encountered along the eastern edge of the unit in Levels 9 and 10. This ash deposit was associated with the remains of a north-south adobe wall to the west and a quincha wall and two burned adobe fragments to the east. A poorly preserved living sur­face was encountered in the northeast comer of the unit at the base of Level 17. This surface was asso­ciated with several small ash deposits. Sterile deposits (Casma Formation) were encountered just below this living surface at the base of Level 18. 
Table 2 presents the distribution by level of the temporally diagnostic sherds recovered during the excavation of Unit 1 of Stratigraphic Cut 10 1.4 No stirrup spout fragments were recovered from the trench. As a result, no ceramics diagnostic of Phases III or IV were recovered. Several fragments of ceramic forms that are characteristically Middle Moche, however, were recovered from the lower levels of the stratigraphy (Figure 8). These sherds were followed without overlap by ceramics that are characteristically Late Moche, including Moche fine line sherds with designs characteristic of Phase V, in the middle levels of the stratigraphy.

Atypical and Chimu ceramics co-occur with Late Moche sherds in the upper of the Late Moche lev­els. Although the number of temporally diagnostic sherds recovered from the stratigraphic cut is low, the distribution presented in Table 2 suggests a pro­gression from a Middle Moche to a Late Moche ceramic phase, followed by levels in which Late Moche, Galindo Atypical, and Chimu ceramics co­occur. The fact that Galindo Atypical sherds only occur in the upper of the Late Moche levels sug­gests that Galindo Atypical ceramics were pro­duced only in the later half of Galindo 's Late Moche occupation. Two Chimu sherds were also found in these levels, however, indicating that they are most likely disturbed. 
Chronometric Dating 

Radiocarbon Dates from Galindo 
Radiocarbon dating was the chronometric dating technique chosen for the GAP because of the ease of collecting samples, the small size of the samples (which facilitates transportation from the field), and its cost effectiveness. Radiocarbon samples analyzed by the GAP were sent to an accelerated mass spectrometry (AMS) lab because the AMS technique can be performed on small samples and provides more precise results. 
Before the GAP, four radiocarbon dates were performed on samples from Galindo. Geoffrey Conrad ( 197 4) and Garth Bawden ( 1977) each sub­mitted two of these samples. Due to their high stan­dard deviations, however, these dates are unfortunately of little use in addressing the refined chronological questions posed at the beginning of this paper. Furthermore, one of Bawden's dates (K4649-D-l) is unacceptably old considering its context (a hearth in a Moche Phase V residence). Nevertheless, all four of the dates are reported in Table 3. Fortunately, radiocarbon dating technol­ogy has advanced considerably in the past few decades, especially with the advent of the AMS technique. As a result, radiocarbon dates are much more precise today than they were when Conrad and Bawden submitted their samples in the 1970s. 
During the GAP, 17 samples were selected for radiocarbon analysis. These samples come from a variety of contexts and are associated with both the Moche and Chimu occupations of the site. Each of the 17 analyzed samples was calibrated using the Southern Hemisphere calibration dataset (McCor­mac et al. 2004) in CALIB Rev. 5.lbeta (Stuiver and Reimer 1993). The calibrated dates are pre­sented in Table 4 and Figure 9. The following is a description of the context and a discussion of the dates obtained from each of the GAP radiocarbon samples.

Unit 1, Stratigraphic Cut 101. Two radiocarbon dates were performed on maize cobs from Unit 1 of Stratigraphic Cut 101. The first sample (AA56782) is from Level 11, which is associated with Late Moche ceramics. The sample was dated to 1372 ± 37 B.P. Calibration of the date produced a two-sigma range of A.D. 649-775 and a median probability of A.D. 702 (McCormac et al. 2004).5 This date places Level 11 between A.D. 600 and 
800.The second sample (AA56783) is from Level 17, which is associated with ceramics that are char­acteristically Middle Moche. This sample was dated to 1290 ± 34 B.P. Calibration of the date pro­duced a two-sigma range of A.D. 687-882 and a median probability of A.D. 782 (McCormac et al. 2004). The date produced by sample AA56783 is later than that of sample AA56782, taken from a level associated with Late Moche ceramics. These two dates, however, along with all of the other GAP dates from Moche contexts at Galindo, are statis­tically the same at the 95 percent level (T = 
2


14.45083 and x= 21 ). The radiocarbon technique 
is therefore insufficiently fine-grained to differen­
tiate between the ages of the two samples from 
Stratigraphic Cut 10 1, or in fact any of the GAP 
samples from Moche contexts at Galindo. 
Moche Contexts. Six radiocarbon dates were 

performed on samples from Moche civic/ceremo­nial contexts. Four of these samples were taken from Platform A of the Huaca de las Abejas and two were taken from Platform B of the Huaca de las Lagartijas. All six of the samples were wood charcoal, as this was the only organic material recovered from the two platforms. The dates from these samples range from 144 1 to 1285 B.P. Cali­bration of the dates produced two-sigma ranges of A.D. 572-884 and median probabilities of A.D. 647-792 (McCormac et al. 2004 ). These dates in di­-cate that Platforms A and B were most likely con­

' structed between A.D. 600 and 800. In fact, they were probably built during the eighth century A.D. (only one date, AA56785, has a median probabil­ity outside of the eighth century A.D.). 
Five radiocarbon dates were performed on sam­ples from hearths in Moche residential structures. These samples were from: (1) Structure 39, Fea­ture 1; (2) Structure 40, Feature 2; (3) Structure 41, Feature l; (4) Structure 42, Feature 2; and (5) Struc­ture 42, Feature 3. Two of the samples were maize cob fragments, two were maize kernels, and one was areed (Phragmites sp.) fragment. The dates of all five samples are consistent, ranging from 1373 to 1335 B.P. Calibration of the dates produced two­sigma ranges of A.D. 64 1-860 and median proba­bilities of A.D. 703-730 (McCormac et al. 2004). These dates indicate that the Phase V residential occupation at Galindo, at least in those residential zones that were sampled (i.e., the Quebrada Ter­race and the northernmost portion of Plain B ), most likely occurred between A.D. 600 and 800. In fact, it was probably confined to the eighth century A.D. 
As mentioned above, all of the GAP dates from Moche contexts at Galindo are statistically the same at the 95 percent level. The Phase V residential occupation at Galindo therefore appears to be con­temporaneous with the construction of Platform A of the Huaca de las Abejas and Platform B of the Huaca de las Lagartijas. At the very least, the radio­carbon technique is insufficiently fine-grained to differentiate between these two events. 
Chimu Contexts. Four radiocarbon dates were performed on samples from hearths in residences associated with Chimu ceramics. These samples were from: (1) Structure 47, Feature 4; (2) Struc­ture 48, Feature 3; (3) Structure 49, Feature 6; and 
(4) Structure 49, Feature 12. Three of the samples were maize cob fragments and the other was wood charcoal. The purpose of dating the latter was to compare the results of dating wood charcoal and maize cobs from the same general context (the Chimu occupation of Galindo). The dates of all four of the samples are remarkably consistent, rang­ing from 566 to 514 B.P. Calibration of the dates produced two-sigma ranges of A.D. 1393-1455 and median probabilities of A.D. 14 16-1435 (McCormac et al. 2004 ). All four of the GAP dates from Chimu contexts at Galindo are statistically the same at the 95 percent level (T = 2. 1540 18 and 
2

x=7. 81 ). These dates indicate that the Chimu occu­pation of Galindo occurred during the late thir­teenth and/or early fourteenth centuries A.D. The Chimu occupation of Galindo therefore took place after an approximately 500-year period of aban­donment following the Moche occupation. Surface ceramics indicate that the Chimu occupation of Galindo was small, covering only the southern por­tion of the lower slopes of Cerro Galindo (Hillside A).

ciated with the radiocarbon dating of wood char­coal from the North Coast of Peru is warranted, as all of the samples analyzed by Bawden and Con­rad and seven of the GAP samples were of this material. Before the Spanish conquest, the most commonly utilized wood for construction and fuel was that of the algarroba tree. The problem with dating algarroba wood is that the species lives for a long time, sometimes hundreds of years. If the outer ring of an algarroba tree trunk is dated, it will give a much later date than if the core of the trunk is dated. Furthermore, as wood is a rare commod­ity on the North Coast, wood beams were often reutilized. As a result, the date in which the tree was cut down (which is the date produced by radio­carbon dating its outer ring) may significantly pre­cede the construction of the building associated with the wood. A considerable amount of error can thus be introduced to the radiocarbon dating of algarroba wood samples. This "old wood" problem (Schiffer 1986), however, can to some extent be mitigated. First, samples should be taken from the outer rings of trunks or large branches if possible. This ensures that the sample will provide the date at which the tree was cut down, rather than the date at which the tree first began to grow. Second, it is better to date small branches than large branches or trunks. This is because the wood of small branches was most likely still alive at the time the tree was cut down. Small branches are most often utilized as fuel, while large branches and trunks are more often utilized as construction materials. The dating of wood charcoal from a hearth is therefore preferable to the dating of a construction beam fragment. Furthermore, it is highly unlikely that small branches were reutilized, especially those used for fuel. It is much more likely that large branches and trunks used as structural beams were reutilized. The old wood problem can also be mit­igated by the dating of multiple samples from the same context. If all of the samples provide similar dates, it is unlikely that all of the samples are incor­rect by the same amount. This is especially true if small branches used as fuel are dated. 
All of the wood charcoal radiocarbon samples recovered from Platforms A and B were most likely algarroba, although they were not analyzed by a specialist. All of the samples, however, were small pieces of wood charcoal within the clay matrix of adobes or adobe mortar. As such, they most likely represent the waste material from hearths located near the source of the clay utilized to construct the platforms. As mentioned, all of the GAP dates from Moche contexts at Galindo are statistically the same at the 95 percent level, as are all of the GAP dates from Chimu contexts. As a result, none of the dates appear to have been significantly affected by the old wood problem. 
Comparison of Moche Context Radiocarbon Dates from Galindo with those of other Moche Sites 

In order to place the Phase V occupation of Galindo within the broader perspective of Moche history, the radiocarbon dates from Moche contexts at Galindo were compared to those reported from other Moche sites. The dates from Moc he contexts at Galindo include those obtained from samples from Unit 1 of Stratigraphic Cut 101. Only recently reported radiocarbon dates from other sites were included in the comparison, as older dates have the same problem of large standard deviations as the Galindo dates submitted by Conrad (1974) and Bawden (1977). In addition, only dates from large sites associated with Moche Phase III, IV, or V ceramics were included. This amounted to two sites: the Huacas de Moche and Cerro Maya!. The dates from the Huacas de Moche are repmted by Claude Chapdelaine (2003, Table 22.2). Chapde­laine submitted 24 samples, all of which were wood or wood charcoal. One of the samples was from Platform I and another was from Platform II of the Huaca de la Luna. The remaining 22 samples were from the urban zone located between the Huaca de la Luna and the Huaca de! Sol. Two of the dates are rejected as too late (Beta-96025 and Beta­84844) and one of the dates is rejected as too early (Beta-108281; see Chapdelaine et al. 1998) to be associated with the Moc he occupation of the site. The remaining 21 dates were included in the com­parison. The dates from Cerro Maya! are reported by Glenn Russell ( 1998, Table 1 ). All nine of the samples were associated with Moche Phase IV ceramics . 
In order to make all of the dates comparable, the dates from the Huacas de Moche and Cerro Maya] were recalibrated using the same method utilized for the calibration of GAP dates. In other words, they were calibrated using the Southern Hemi­sphere calibration dataset (McCormac et al. 2004)

in CALIB Rev. 5.lbeta (Stuiver and Reimer 1993) 
(Table 5). The recalibrated dates from the Huacas 
de Moche and Cerro Mayal are compared to the 
calibrated GAP dates from Galindo in Figure 10. 
The 12 dates with the most recent median proba­
bilities (A.D. 617-800) and the GAP dates from 
Moche contexts at Galindo are statistically the same 
atthe 95 percent level (T=31.90544and x2 = 36.4). 
The radiocarbon dates from these two sites there­
fore challenge the conventional view that the Phase 
V occupation at Galindo took place after the aban­
donment of the Huacas de Moche (e.g., Bawden 
1996; Shimada 1994). Instead, the Phase V occu­
pation at Galindo appears to be contemporaneous 
with the later portion of the Phase IV occupation 
of the Huacas de Moche.6 At the very least, the 
radiocarbon technique is insufficiently fine grained 
to differentiate between these two occupations. 
The calibrated dates from Cerro Maya] and the 
GAP dates from Moche contexts at Galindo are sta­
tistically different at the 95 percent level (T = 

46.39421 and x2 = 32.7). If the two dates from 
Cerro Maya] with the latest median probabilities 
(A.D. 88 1 and 894) are excluded, however, the dates are statistically the same at the 95 percent level (T = 30.0 1285 and x2 = 30. 1 ). This analysis sug­gests that the Phase IV occupation at Cerro Mayal did not predate, and may have even continued after, the Phase V occupation at Galindo. This premise should be treated as a hypothesis for further eval­uation rather than a firm conclusion. At the very least, however, the analysis does indicate that the two sites were at least partially contemporaneous. This does not mean that Phase V ceramics from Galindo are completely contemporaneous with all Phase IV ceramics from the Chicama Valley. The radiocarbon dates reported above indicate that Phase V ceramics from Galindo were only pro­duced during the later portion of the Phase IV occu­


, pation at the Huacas de Moche. Phase V ceramics from Galindo were probably likewise only pro­duced during the later portion of Phase IV in the Chicama Valley. Furthermore, there is currently no data available to test the contemporaneity of Phase V ceramics from the Chicama Valley and those from Galindo. It is quite possible that the former postdate the latter. This should come as no sur­prise, as there is often time lag in the appearance and disappearance of ceramic types in geographi­cally distinct areas (O'Brien and Lyman 1999:46). 
Furthermore, there is often considerable overlap between ceramic types within a discrete geographic area such as the Chicama Valley. Larco's (1948) sequence is therefore most likely correct for the Chicama Valley, especially considering the fact that the sequence was largely developed from his seri­ation of ceramics from Chicama burials. 
Radiocarbon dates from Pampa Grande, although they have fairly large standard deviations, at least suggest that this site was contemporaneous with the Phase V occupation of Galindo. The dates from Pampa Grande are reported by Shimada (1994, Table 2). All five of the samples were asso­ciated with Moche Phase V ceramics. One of the samples was a burnt wooden post, two were charred cotton, one was burnt cane, and the last was car­bonized maize kernels. 
Finally, Franco et al. (2003, Table 19.2) report a single radiocarbon date from a sample from a Phase IV construction (i.e., Edificio A) of the Huaca Cao Viejo. Edificio A is in fact the huaca's final addition. The date obtained from the sample, recal­ibrated by the author utilizing the methods described above, indicates that this construction took place around A.D. 600. 
Conclusion 
Temporally diagnostic ceramics from surface and archaeologically excavated contexts and AMS radiocarbon dates paint the same picture of the occupational history of Galindo. Prior to Phase V, the site appears to have been a small rural site con­fined to the lower slopes of Cerro Galindo (i.e., Hill­side A). During the eighth century A.D., Galindo quickly and dramatically grew to its maximum size, covering the lower slopes of Cerro Galindo and extending across the lower slopes of Cerro Muerto and the alluvial plain below. During this time, the civic/ceremonial architecture on Plain B was con­structed. Galindo was suddenly and completely abandoned sometime before or during the ninth century A.D. The southern portion of HillsideA was then reoccupied hundreds of years later during the late thirteenth or early fourteenth century A.D. 
These data have a significant impact on our understanding of the occupational history of the Moche Valley. The traditional interpretation that Galindo was occupied only after the abandonment of the Huacas de Moche should be reevaluated.

Early Chimu ceramics may have been produced in 
the Moche Valley as early as the ninth century AD. 
Unfortunately, Early Chimu sites in the Moche Val­
ley have yet to be extensively researched, and 
chronometric dates associated with Early Chimu ceramics in the valley are lacking. If Early Chimu ceramics do date as early as the ninth century A.D., it is not unreasonable to hypothesize that Chan Chan itself may have been occupied at this time. The early occupation of Chan Chan is as yet poorly understood, as many of the earliest structures and middens at the site are buried by overlying cultural deposits. Ceramic analyses and associated chrono­metric dates from the Huacas de Moche and Galindo have contributed to a greater understand­ing of the occupational history of the Moche Val­ley during the first half of the Middle Horizon. Before a similar understanding of the valley's occu­pational history in the second half of the Middle Horizon can be reached, however, chronometric dates must be performed on cultural remains recov­ered from the earliest occupational levels at Chan Chan.

Although some Moche archaeologists only refer to Phase IV-V or Phase V ceramics with intricate painted designs as Moche fineline ceramics (e.g., Castillo 2001, 2003 ), I follow Donnan and McClelland ( 1999) in referring to all Moche finewares with dark slip paint on a light slip back­ground (or vice versa) as Moche fineline ceramics. 
2. "Diagnostics" refers to rim and/or decorated sherds, which are not necessarily temporally diagnostic. All ceramics were retained during the excavation of Area 307, Subarea I. In all other areas, however, only diagnostics were retained during the GAP. All sherds recovered during the GAP were catalogued (a preliminary analysis), whereas only sherds from undisturbed, non-surface contexts were fully "ana­lyzed" (for 16 attributes -see Lockard 2005:Appendix 3). All "Moche Finelines," however, were identified during artifact cataloguing. As a result, the percentage of Moche fineline

sherds could be calculated from the total number of diagnos­tic sherds, whereas the percentage of Galindo Atypical and Chimu sherds could only be calculated from the total number of analyzed sherds.

It has been argued that the median probability of the probability distribution is a more stable estimate of sample calendar age than intercepts with the calibration curve (Telford et al. 2004). 


6. A similar argument has been made by Chapdelaine, who states "the Moche IV population continued to occupy the site (the Huacas de Moche) at the same time that Galindo, a Moche V center, developed on the northern side of the Moche valley" (2001 :71-73).
