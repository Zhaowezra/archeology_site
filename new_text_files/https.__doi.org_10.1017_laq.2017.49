early every ancient Mesoamerican city known to archaeologists has one or more formal public plazas, typically in the epicenter/central zone. These are often large, impressive spaces, ringed by tall pyramids and othercivicbuildings. ScholarsofMesoamerican urban form have identi.ed the plaza as one of the fundamental elements of urban planning in thearea(e.g.,Andrews 1975:37).Archaeologists have had dif.culty, nevertheless, determining with con.dence what activities took place in theseplazas.Plazas were probablycleaned after they were used, leaving few direct artifactual tracesof theirfunction.In this article,weexam­ine the size of Mesoamerican plazas relative to theoverall populationofthe settlementsinwhich they occur to determine their ancient use. 
Withinagiven Mesoamerican urban tradition such as theClassicMaya or theAztec, informal observation suggests that larger cities and urban settlementstendtohavelarger centralplazasor greater total plaza area, sometimes distributed among more than one formal plaza (Andrews 1975;Inomata2006a;Smith2008).Butdolarger

cities have more, less, or the same amount of plaza space per person compared to smaller cities? This relationship is interesting because important activitieswithfewdirect traces—such as rituals and markets—took place in plazas, and the relationship between settlement population and plaza area can give us insights into those activities. This quantitative relationship has not previously been investigated systematically. Is therearegular relationship between urban popu­lation and plaza size? Andif so, can theformof therelationship helpdistinguish the likelyusesof plazas?Wepresent threeindependent setsof data that furnisha positive answerto both questions. 
The expectation that larger settlements will have larger plazas—ormoretotal plaza space— is based on the following logic. Plazas were places where people gathered periodically, and these gatherings were most likely events that heldsigni.cance—both personal signi.cancefor individual participants and social signi.cance for urban society. Settlements with larger pop­ulationswouldtherefore need more plaza space in order for the events in plazas to accommo­datea greater numberof participants.We limit consideration to formal public plazas; that is, built spaces with a clear spatial structure that were likely designed for human activity and interaction(see Smith 2007 on the concept of formalbuilt spaces).We identifyplazas as open spaces clearly oriented toward civic buildings, at leasttwo sidesof whichare clearly delimited by architectural constructions.Wefocus hereon public plazas, not residential patios. 
The proposal that larger cities should have more plaza areamakessenseintermsofagrow­ing literature—in economics, economic geogra­phy,anthropology,and sociology—that suggests that thescaleofhuman organizations and aggre­gations has a major effect on the performance of such population aggregations in public spaces (e.g., Bettencourt 2013;Carneiro2000;Glaeser etal. 2003).Humansettlementscanbe described as social networksthat areembeddedinphysical space. In the words of architectural historian SpiroKostof(1991:37), “citiesare places where a certain energized crowding of people takes place.”Face-to-face interactionisthe foundation of social life in cities, from the ancient world to thepresent. Public spaces playafundamental roleinfacilitatingsuch interactionsandmaybe expected to re.ect some of their intensity and value.Thesizeofplazas shouldthusbe sensitive to thescaleofsocial interaction, whichinturnis afunctionofthe populationof a settlement. 
We test these expectations by comparing plaza area and city population in three sets of Mesoamerican settlements:asampleof30Late Postclassic cities and towns from throughout Mesoamerica,aregional groupof Classic period settlements from south-central Veracruz, and settlement pattern datafromthePalenque region. In Mesoamerica, formal plazas were present not only in large capital cities but also in smaller settlements that could be called towns or even villages.Eachof our threesetsof sites contains urban centers (as de.ned in functional terms by Smith[2007]), meaning thosethat had rit­ual and administrative functions, and smaller settlements. The relationships we identify thus cut across the urban/nonurban distinction, and they describe settlement systems. We .nd that the three cases share a similar quantitative rela­tionship between populationsize and plaza area, known as a “sublinear” scaling relationship. In other words, larger settlements have more plaza space, but less plaza space per capita, than smaller settlements. This .nding reveals a decreasing proportion of the city population gathered in plazas at any given moment and suggests thatacurrently popular interpretationof Mesoamerican plaza construction and use—that they were designed speci.cally as settings for mass spectator ceremonies—shouldbe adjusted to take this general pattern into account. 


TheUsesofPlazasin Mesoamerican 
Settlements 

The most extensive discussion of the uses and sizes of plazas in Mesoamerica concerns Classic (AD 250–900) Maya cities. We .rst review TakeshiInomata’sinterpretationofMaya plazas, andthenwe outlinethemajortypesof directand indirectevidence forplaza useinMesoamerica. This section concludeswithadiscussionof.ve typesofactivitiesthatlikelytookplacein plazas: private rituals, periodic markets, mass spectator rituals, participatory public ceremonies, and feasts and other popular celebrations.

ClassicMaya PlazaSize and Use 
In an in.uential paper,Takeshi Inomata(2006a) argued that plazas in Maya cities were “political theaters” where city residents gathered to wit­nesstheatrical performancesby kings and elites. Thesewere “large-scale performancesinvolving a substantial number of participants” (Inomata 2006a:807). This argument originated with the notionthat politicalpowerinMaya politieswas based on spectacle and performance (Demarest 1992;Inomata2006b),amodel originally called the“theater state”by Clifford Geertz(1980).In this model,itiscrucial that the entire populace is able to gather to witness royal spectacles. Inomata describestheimplicationsofthetheater statemodel forplazas as follows: 
Yet the most important implication of these historiesofplazasis that securing suf.cient spaces for public events was a primary con­cerninthedesignofMayacities.This means that plazas were meant to accommodate a large numberofindividuals andsuchgath­erings were extremely important for Maya polities. Plazas and causeways were not sec­ondary spaces de.ned afterthe placementof templepyramidsbutsocialspaces ofextreme importanceintheirownright....Iargue that the critical elements that held together this precarious integrationofMayacommunities were the mass theatrical events sponsored and organized by the elite. Mass spectacles, in which a large portion of a community assembled and worked together, provided opportunitiesfor individuals to witnessand sense the bodily existence and participation of other members [Inomata 2006a:818]. 
Inomata analyzes the number of people that could .t in plazas by multiplying the area of urban plazas by several density constants reportedbyJerry Moore(1996).He selectsthree .gures mentioned by Moore—0.46, 1.00, and 
3.60 m2 per person—and calculates the poten­tial sizes of the groups that could .t into the plazas atTikal,Copan, and Aguateca (Inomata 2006a:816). He compares these .gures to the estimated populations of the three sites and concludes that the entire populations of Tikal, Copan,and Aguateca couldhavegatheredintheir respective plazas, although he admits that the entire populationofTikalwouldmakeforatight .t, and the ceremonial plaza of Copan would not have provided the best sightlines (Inomata 2006a:813–814, Table 1). Despite these com­plications, Inomata concludes that for smaller and medium centers, the plazas would have held the majority of community members for politically charged ceremonies and that thelarge plazas of the large centers were made to hold large numbers of people. Even as .tting the entire population becamedif.cultover timefor the larger centers, accommodation was made to afford everyone access to mass spectacles (Inomata 2006a:819). 
The density constants reported in Moore (1996:147) arerough estimates based onasmall number of heterogeneous settlements, some reportedbypersonal communications rather than publications. Inomata (2006a:812) acknowl­edges theprovisional natureof theseestimates. Nevertheless, this approach—estimating plaza occupancybased on 0.46, 1.00, and 3.60 m2 per personinsupportof massspectator ceremonies as the cause of plaza size—has been taken up by other Mayanists and other Mesoamericanists (Robin et al. 2014:381; Tsukamoto and Inomata 2014)and North Americanists(Cobb and Butler 2017;Thompson 2009). Theuseof theseplaza size constants suggests that these authors—like Inomata—assume that the entire urban popula­tionwouldhavegatheredin theplazas.1 
The basic assumption of Inomata’s model of mass spectator ceremonies is that the entire population of a settlement (or a polity) could .t intotheplazasofacapitaltowitness ceremonies. If this modelis correct,weshouldexpectalinear relationship between city population and plaza area. Our data, however, reveal a relationship inconsistent with this interpretation. The rela­tionship between population and plaza size is sublinear when the variables are expressed as logarithms, which means that larger settlements haveconsiderablylessplaza space per capita than smaller settlements. 
Sources of Evidence 
Aztec Ethnohistory. Most written descrip­tions of activitiesthat likelytook place in Aztec plazas—marketactivities, state ceremonies, and

public gatherings—pertain to the imperial cap­ital Tenochtitlan. One divergent feature of the layout of Tenochtitlan is the large size and enclosed con.guration of the central plaza. An open plaza similar to most city-state capitals may have been present early in the history of the city, but as imperial expansion proceeded, a wall was built enclosing the entire central zone (the so-called sacred precinct). This area was .lled with shrines, altars, and other build­ings (Rojas 2012:56–64), although considerable open gathering space remained between the buildings. 
Mesoamerican Ethnography. Markets and commercial exchange were widespread in Mesoamericaatthe timeofthe Spanish conquest (Berdan et al. 2003),and most scholars acknowl­edgea continuity fromthispre-Spanish pattern to the markets described by ethnographers in peasant villages of twentieth-century Mexico (Hassig 1985). This information provides rele­vant analogies for marketplaces in plazas. 
Soil Chemistry. Archaeologists have used chemical analyses of sediments from plazas to infer the activities that may have taken place. Suggestions include food preparation, feasting, rituals involving incense, and market activity (e.g., Canutoetal. 2010;Dahlin et al.2007;Ful­tonetal. 2017;Terryetal.2015). Unfortunately, the number of ethnographic analogues is still too small and unsystematic to establish reliable signatures forindividual activities. An increase inthe numberof contemporary analogueswould permit bettertestablepredictions foralternative plaza uses. 
Other Direct Archaeological Evidence. Because plazas were probably kept relatively clear of debris, direct archaeological evidence for their use can be dif.cult to .nd. In one study, Cap used microartifact distributions and other archaeological data fromthe ClassicMaya siteof Chanto inferthree typesoflikelyplaza activities: “(1) political/religious ceremonies,(2) economic transactions,and(3)socialgatherings” (Cap 2012:152).Chase and colleagues(2015) also used multiple types of evidence to infer marketplaces in formal open spaces at Caracol.Carballo(2012)has interpretedburied offerings and geophysical prospecting results as suggesting differential use of two plazas at theFormative periodsiteofLa Laguna: public religious ceremonies in a more formal plaza, and feasting and more informal public activities in an adjacent, less formal plaza. Masson and Friedel (2013) used distributional patterns of artifacts to infer the presence of markets in plazas. 
PlazaActivities 
Onthe basisoftheabovesourcesofevidencewe identify .ve types of activities that likely took placeinMesoamerican urban plazas:private ritu­als, periodicmarkets,massspectator ceremonies, participatory public ceremonies, and feasts and other popular celebrations. 
PrivateRituals. Weusethe termprivateritual here to refer to ritual activities carried out by a small number of participants and not witnessed by others. Aztec sources describe many such privaterituals—such as bloodletting and incense burning—carried out by priests and novices (Durán 1971), although their spatial locations arerarelyindicated. Carballo(2012)interpretsa plaza depositof greenstone objectsatLaLaguna, perhaps dispersedby a ritual scattering activity, asa possible caseofprivate ritualinaplaza. 
Periodic Markets. In most contemporary peasant societies with active and widespread commercial exchange, marketplaces are peri­odic. Towns may have permanent markets in dedicated buildings that are open daily while smallersettlementstypically hosta weeklymar­ket. Towns with permanent market buildings typicallyhaveaweekly“marketday”when stalls andexchange activityexpandbeyondthemarket buildinginto nearby streets and plazas (Cook and Diskin 1976). 
As thelocation of oneof the best-described premodernmarketsintheworld,the Aztecisland capitalTenochtitlan/Tlatelolco provides consid­erable information about marketplaces relevant to other, earlierMesoamerican cities. Tlatelolco, where the conqueror Cortés described 60,000 daily attendees at the market, had the only well-documented case of a dedicated marketplace buildingofanyAzteccity.Thiswas located adja­centtothemainpublicplazaof Tlatelolco(Díaz

del Castillo 1956:217; González Rul 1998). In the Maya area, Christopher Jones (2015) has madeastrong casefor theexistenceofamarket building(an enclosed compound with stalls)at Tikal. 
Forthe cityofTenochtitlan, thereis limited historicalevidenceto suggestthatamarket was heldina plaza outside theroyal palace (Matos Moctezuma 2015). Scattered records suggest strongly that all Aztec cities hosted periodic markets(Blanton 1996;Smith2012:Chapter 5), and the absence of marketbuildings at smaller Azteccities(Smith 2008)lends supporttothe notionthat theweeklymarkets were heldinthe formal plaza of each city. 
The strongest direct evidence for market­place activities in an urban plaza comes from Chunchucmil. Dahlin and colleagues measured the concentrations of phosphates and other com­pounds in domestic contexts, likely ceremonial plazas, and a less formal plaza (Dahlin et al. 2007). They compared the results to soil data gathered ata contemporaryhighland Maya mar­ketplace to identify a likely market plaza at Chunchucmil. 
Mass Spectator Ceremonies. We de.ne a mass spectator ceremony asa largecrowdgath­ered in one space to witness or participate together in a royal or state ceremony. For the Aztecs,theworksofFriar DiegoDurán arefull of passages that mentionorimply thepresence of large crowds gathered in plazas to witness events. Here aresomeofDurán’s(1971)remarks aboutvarious monthly ceremoniesinTenochtit­lan(notethat these quotations describedifferent ceremonies): “While they [the participantsina sacri.ce] were ascending, all the people stood below in the courtyard with great reverence and awe” (88); “This performance was attended by the entire city”(104); “The entire city was presentat this spectacle” (180).Inthese passages, Durán uses the term “courtyard” to refer to the open space in front of and surrounding the main temple of Tenochtitlan, within the sacred precinct. 
Participatory Public Ceremonies. A partic­ipatory public ceremony is an event in which groups of people participate in speci.c move­ments and activities in designated locations. 
TheAztec monthly ceremonies,as describedby Sahagún and others, provide many examples. Plazas were thesettings forprocessions, dances, sacri.ces, and offerings of incense. The Codex Borbonicus,forexample, showsanAztec urban plaza(Figure1)that corresponds closelytothe known layouts of many Aztec cities (Smith 2008:127–132).Agroupof deity impersonators (ixiptla)lines the edges of theplaza, suggesting that the plaza was used for public religious ceremonies. 
The Primeros Memoriales of Sahagún(1993) contains paintings of the 18 state-sponsored monthly ceremonies, describedin detailinBook 2ofthe Florentine Codex (Sahagún 1950– 1982). The painting of the Tlacaxipeualiztli ceremony(Figure2)includes twobuildings and three shrines or altars, around which six dif­ferent groups of actors are engaged in various activities, including human sacri.ce, playing musical instruments, and formal processions. No spectators are depicted; each person par­ticipates in a speci.c, localized ritual activity. Diversegroupsof peoplewereengagedinactive participation, visible to anyone who cared to look. Mass spectator ceremonies by contrast havelarger crowds, packed more tightly together, whose members passively witness staged events or may participate together in activities that do not require extensive space, such as chanting or limited choreographed movement. 
Feasts and OtherPopular Celebrations. We are unaware of analogical data from Aztec or modernethnographic sources pointingtofeast­ing activities in plazas. Nevertheless, this is a commonposthoc interpretationofsoil chemistry results that suggest possiblefood preparation and consumption activitiesinMesoamerican plazas (Canutoetal. 2010;Fultonetal.2017). Feasting is a dif.cult plaza activity to document, since food preparation and consumption were likely components of several other plaza activities besides feasting. 
Multiple Activities SeparatedinTime

dars ofknown Mesoamerican societies. Among the Aztecs, for example, markets met weekly (every .ve days) and participatory ceremonies and mass ceremonies monthly(every20 days). Assuchitwouldhavebeen convenientto usefor­malplazas forall threekindsof activity,instead of creating separate spaces for each. This sug­gestion illustratesakeyinsightofenvironment­behavior theory(Smith 2011), which posits that “organization in time may be substituted for organizationinspace” (Rapoport 1990:15). 
TheMesoamerican ethnographic dataprovide insight into the nature ofperiodic uses ofpublic plazas. Many indigenous towns have a central town square with a public fountain. Each week a market is held in the square, which remains empty the rest of the week. This pattern of a central square, which resembles a vacant lot most of the time but springs to life for market day, has been described by ethnographers of peasant villages in Oaxaca, westernGuatemala, and other regions of Mesoamerica(e.g.,Beals 1975; McBryde 1947). For example, in the late twentieth century, the Mexican town of Tepoztlan, Morelos(Lewis1951), hada perma­nent marketbuilding adjacenttothetownsquare. Most days the square was used for informal socializing and was frequently empty. But on market day (Sunday), the market spilled out of themarkethall and temporarystalls coveredthe plaza(Figure3). Themultifunctional character of plazas in Latin American towns has been emphasizedby Daniel Gade(1976)with respect to six types of plaza use: as an unimproved site, a marketplace, a ceremonial center, a social concourse, a garden park, and a traf.c hub. The commonfactor among thediverse periodic activities that likely took place in plazas is that

PlazaArea andPopulationSize 
Analytical Approach 
Our approach to plaza size differs from tradi­tional analysesbyMesoamerican archaeologists. In that scholarly tradition, archaeologists com­monly use excavation data to construct detailed analyses of individual architectural features like plazas. Although comparisons may be made among sites, such comparisons are typically peripheraltothemajor thrustofthestudy.Our approach, in contrast, is explicitly compara­tive and statistical in nature. Any comparative analysis requires simpli.cation and abstraction. Instead of dealing with the speci.c stratigraphic sequencesofindividual plazas,weare comparing onevariable—plaza size—acrossthree groupsof settlementsinrelationtotheirestimated popula­tion. In this manner, we evaluate plaza use by consideringits areain relationtoits surrounding settlement population. 
EstimationFramework 
Wehypothesizethat—within individual regions or urban systems—there was a systematic rela­tionship betweentheareaallocatedto plazasand the populationsizeofprehispanicMesoamerican settlements. Therearevarious possibilitiesasto the quantitative relationship between plaza area and population size, speci.cally with regard to howplaza areas changedin responsetoincreases in populationsize: proportionally,forexample, or less than proportionally.We adopt power-law function to represent the relationship between settlement population and plaza area: 
,
Yt = Y0Nß (1)
t 
where Yrefersto totalareaofplazas, Ndenotes population size, Y0 is a prefactor (or constant) capturing the effects of technology and institu­tional arrangementsonthe relationship between population size and plaza area, and t is a sub­script identifying a particular time. The value of the exponent ß (an elasticity index) determines how the area of urban settlements allocated to plazas varied with settlement population within asettlement system.The choiceofapower-law function assumes that the effect on plaza area of increasing populationsizeis not additivebut multiplicative, whichistosay that theincrease in plaza area is driven by the interaction of manyfactors observationally summarized in an increasein populationsize(Coffey 1979). 
Adoptingapower-lawfunctional form carries another implication; namely, that the relation­ship between plaza area and population size is parametrized by a single number, ß, which is itselfscaleindependent.Asa consequence, the rateofchangeorgrowth(inthis caserepresented by theincrease inthe populationsizeof settle­ments within a coherent system) is a constant fraction of the relative change in population. If empirically robust,sucharegularityisahintthat indeed therewere underlyingsocioeconomicand culturalprocessesthat generated and maintained the same relationship among two structural and

functionalvariables,plaza area and population, overthe rangeof scales found withinasettlement system (Brown et al. 2000). As suggested by Chave and Levin(2003:551), “scaling concepts offer an avenue to study heterogeneous assem­bliesfor whichthe microscopicprocessesare not known, and probably not knowable(e.g.,inthe case of social systems) except in terms of their statistical properties.” Thus, a scaling relation is perhaps the best evidence for the existence of general features in the immensely complex dynamicsofsocialand economic systems(Brock 1999). 
Taking the naturallogarithmofEquation(1) we obtain a simple linear regression equation: 
lnYt = c + ß ln Nt + et, (2) 
in which . is an IID noise term (Gaussian white noise). Whether or not it is reasonable to adopt the assumptions carried along by the choice of a power-law functional form can be evaluated by performing the usual goodness-of-.t tests on Equation(2).Thevalues forthe ß coef.­cients reported in the present discussion were estimated for all three data sets using ordinary least squares (OLS) regression with a correction for heteroscedasticity (the estimations were done using the Stata 12SE software package). Note that our threesteps—the choiceofapower-law functional form, estimation of the scaling coef­.cients, and provisionofa model orexplanation forthe estimated coef.cientvalues—are distinct analytical exercises. 
LatePostclassicMesoamerican Settlements 
Our .rst set of observations is drawn from a sample of Late Postclassic Mesoamerican settlements whose size and demography were analyzed previouslyby Smith(2005). The 2005 sample consisted of all Late Postclassic towns or cities with published detailed maps of their totalextent,theirurban epicenter,or both. Smith returned to that sample with AlexandraNorwood and measured the sizes of mapped plazas in all siteswith adequatemaps,yieldingasampleof22 sites.

Most Late Postclassic cities and towns had well-de.ned formal plazas located in the center of the site. Larger cities often had subsidiary plazasbuiltaway fromthe centralarea. Because we areinterestedinthe sumofall plaza activities in each settlement, we use the sum of the areas of allplazas in our analyses.The basal areas of shrines, platforms, or buildings located within plazas were subtracted fromplaza areas,yielding the space available for movement and social interaction that we call the “plaza interaction area.” Many of these settlements were capitals of city-states or other types of small polity. Although precise data are lacking, it is likely

whichisthe median population densityof Aztec cities (Smith 2008:152). The median is used instead of the mean because the mean is biased by thelarge populationofTenochtitlan.Forfour sites whose populations have been estimated independently of their area by archaeologists (Cuexcomate,Tenochtitlan, Mayapan, and Mitla Palace), we use those estimates. Estimate 2— whichweconsider more realistic and accurate— builds from the observation that human settle­ments generally increasein density as their pop­ulationsgrow.This patternhasbeen observedina numberof demographic analysesofbothmodern and premodern settlement systems, where set­tlement area exhibits a regular sublinear scaling relationshipwith respectto population(Cesaretti etal. 2016;Cookand Heizer1968;Ortmanetal. 2014;Ortmanetal. 2016). The elasticity of the population-area relationshipinthesestudies is similar to that found in contemporary urban systems, and it matches the value predicted by current models(Bettencourt 2013). Estimate 2 takes this general relationship into account. Speci.cally, we use Equation (1) in the case where Y refers to the settled area. Rearranging this equationtosolve for N, we obtain: 
= (Y/Y0)1/ß
N . (3) 
We use the subset of cases for which popu­lation is estimated independent of area (Cuex­comate, Tenochtitlan, Mayapan, Mitla Palace) to estimate Y0 and ß,using Equation(1), and then apply these .gures to the settled area for each siteto estimatethe total population Nusing Equation(3). 
Therefore, two regression models were esti­mated, using different population estimates: model 1, which uses population Estimate 1 (based on the assumption of constant density); and model 2, which uses population Estimate 2 (based on the assumption that larger sites had denser populations than smallersites).The number of observations(n = 30) is not very largebut is suf.cient to invoke the central limit theorem and thus estimate con.dence intervals around theregression coef.cient.The estimation results areshownin Table2.Not surprisingly, theestimatedregression coef.cientfortheeffect of populationsizeonplaza area differs between

the two models—0.55 for model 1 and 0.44 for model 2—but the 95% con.dence intervals for the two estimated coef.cients include each other.The proportionof thevariabilityin plaza area explained by population size alone—about 65%—is very similar in the models.

ClassicPeriod South-CentralVeracruz (Mixtequilla) Settlements 
Intensive settlement pattern research by the ProyectoArqueológicoLa Mixtequilla(PALM) I and II, undertaken by Barbara Stark, forms the basis for our study of plazas and settlements in south-centralVeracruz,Mexico (Mixtequilla). The plaza information was obtained from the centers and monumental complexes in a con­tiguous block of survey, or “main block” of the PALM projects, using detailedtopographicmaps (Figure6). These datainclude theClassic period centers and related complexes of Cerro de las Mesas and Azuzules,in additiontominor mon­umental complexes and centers (see Table3). 
The original settlement study captures the majority of the centers that were identi.able within the delta of the lower Blanco (Stark 2001). The PALM survey covered 49 km2 for the main survey block and identi.ed approxi­mately13civic ceremonial complexes, including the 10 centers with formal plazas that were

usedin this study (Stark 1999).Forthe Classic periodMixtequilla,formalplazas were typically con.gured in a recognizable “standard plan” that included a conical mound accompanied by two elongated mounds forming a plaza with a ball court opposite the conical mound (Daneels 2002), although some locally identi.ed variants of this planexist(Stark 2016).Twoofthe three complexes not used in our study had no formal plaza space and may not be public complexes (Ossa 2014).

recognize that these areas could have changed duringtheiruseofseveral hundredyearsandthat a certain amount of mound erosion-based error is also possible. 
Population estimates for south-central Ver­acruz were based onaMonteCarlo simulation that tested theexistence and scale(where possi­ble) of individual domestic mound associations with centers(Ossa 2014). The domestic mounds are remnants of residential occupation based on excavations and multiple yearsofintensivesur­vey(Stark 1999, 2001). Thesimulationallowed usto identifythe scaleat which residences were associated with centersbymeasuringthe highest densitiesof residences.Since theregionis char­acterized by a distribution of residences with­out easily identi.ed drop-offs that could mark the edges of center-associated populations, the simulated residential association scaleprovided a quanti.able settlement population boundary for most, though not all, of the centers in this study. Residences were assigned to the closest center based on the identi.ed scale. For those centers where settlement attraction scales were not identi.ed, a scale was selected based on size. Once a scale was identi.ed/selected, all residential mounds within each center buffer were tabulated at 5.6 persons per individual mound to come up with a population estimate per center(Table3).The .gureof5.6 personsper householdistaken fromKolb’s(1985)thorough study of Mesoamerican household size. 
Given that the Classic period occupation is the longest, the majority of residences used in this analysis probably date to the Classic period, although their exact contemporaneity is unknown. Site areas were calculated based on thescaleof settlement associationidenti.edby theoriginal simulation(Ossa 2014). Finally,the location of Azuzules near the survey boundary means that some boundary effect in measuring settlement (and therefore population) is pos­sible, although ground reconnaissance in the areas southofAzuzules indicatethat residential mounds are not found in abundance in that area. 
The decisiontotreatthedatasetfortheClassic period Mixtequilla settlements as a population makesit possibletoestimate ß notwithstanding the small number of observations (therefore a con.dence interval around the estimated regres­sion coef.cient is not reported). The estimated coef.cient is 0.61, indicating a sublinear rela­tionship between populationsize and plaza area. The larger size of the coef.cient relative to the Postclassic sites(Table2)indicates that the per capita plaza area declines more slowly with population size in the Mixtequilla population. The R2 valueof0.63isverysimilartothat forthe Postclassiccities data,andagainitisremarkable that over 60% of the variability in the area of plazasin theMixtequilla centersisexplainedby population size alone. 
ThePalenqueRegionin theClassicPeriod 
Our third case consists of the Classic period Maya cityofPalenque andagroupof10 nearby sitesfroma regional surveydirectedby Rodrigo Liendo Stuardo(2002, 2011).Palenque wasa majorurban center renowned for its architecture, art, and hieroglyphicinscriptions (Marken 2007). Liendo Stuardo surveyed an area of 470 km2 around Palenque. He published tables of data that include arealextentand populationestimates (based on counts of house mounds) of several hundred sites(Liendo Stuardo 2011:25–33).The sites are classi.ed into .ve types that form an ordinal scale of decreasing architectural com­plexity. Our data are from a table of the sites with civic-ceremonial architecture published in Liendo Stuardo (2014:117). Sites with civic-ceremonial architecture are classi.ed as Cate­gory5inthe survey typology (Liendo Stuardo 2011:25–33); these sites are further subdivided intotwo “ranks.” Therearetworegional capitals (Rank 1)—Palenque and Chinikiha—and nine minorcivic centers(Rank2). 
These sites can be considered a population following the same logic applied to the Mix­tequilla sites; they consist of all of the centers present within a de.ned spatial zone (survey area). The sites and measurements are shown inTable4.Site populations were estimatedby Liendo Stuardo and colleagues(2014:117) by multiplying the number of house mounds by the same constant of 5.6 as was applied in the Mixtequilla, maintaining internal consistency. Liendo Stuardo also provides an illustration of how the main plaza at Chinikiha was delimited for purposes of measuring its area (Liendo Stu­ardoetal. 2014:113).Weremeasuredthis plaza,

using the protocols established for measuring Postclassic plaza size, and our result—13,034 m2 afterremovingthe areaofastructureinthe center of theplaza—is within 0.53% of Liendo Stuardo’s .gure. On this basis we conclude that Liendo Stuardo’s plaza area measurements are equivalent to our measures of “interaction area” in the Postclassic sample described above. 
As in the Mixtequilla, the decision to treat the data set for the Classic period Palenque area cities as a population makes it possible to estimate ß notwithstanding the small number of observations.The estimated coef.cient is 0.40, very closetothevaluefor populationEstimate2 of the Postclassic sample. The R2 value of0.44 is smallerthan that for our other cases, partially duetothesmall numberof observations,butit does show that population size is an important determinantof plaza areainthePalenque survey region. 


Discussion 
We have reported quantitative relationships between populationsize and plaza area forthree separate groups of Mesoamerican settlements. One group is a sample of 30 Late Postclassic settlements from throughout Mesoamerica, and the other two are regional urban systems from theClassic period. The con.dence intervalsfor theestimated regression coef.cientsfor thetwo models using the Postclassic data include 0.4, and thus theresults for Postclassic andPalenque urban systems are consistent with a value of ß of 0.4. This can be interpreted as indicating thata1%increasein populationwas associated with a 0.4% increase in plaza area. The total areadevotedtoplazasin allthree urban systems under consideration did indeed increase with populationsizebutinamanner considerablyless than proportionally.The similarityin estimated ß valuesfortwoofthesetsofobservations suggests that the underlying social forces responsible for plaza size mayhave been similarinthese cases. Thedivergentvaluefor theMixtequilla sitesmay point to differences in how those plazas were used relativetotheothertwocasesweexamined. 
Anotherwayofexpressing thesublinear scal­ingrelationships listedin Table2 is toexam­ine the plaza space per capita in comparison with settlement population. This relationship is shown—using logarithms of the data—in Figure7.Two alternativeexplanations forthe quantitativerelationship between populationsize and plaza area can be contemplated. First, our results suggestplazas could nothave heldmass spectator ceremonies in which the entire urban population participated at the same time. If this were the case, one would expect a linear scaling relationship,in whichlargertownswouldhave the same amount of plaza space per capita as smallersettlement systems. Thefact that larger settlements had far less plaza area per capita than smallersettlementsinall threegroups lends support to the notion that plazas were designed foravarietyof(likely periodic) activities, rather than being designed speci.cally to hold the entire population of the city in mass spectator ceremonies 
A second, alternative, explanation for our resultsisthatwhen citiesandtownswereinitially planned and built, their plazas were intended to hold the entire urban population in mass spectator ceremonies.Butthenasthesettlements grew, the plazas remained the same size and thus the per capita area would have decreased through time.It clearlywouldhavebeendif.cult toexpand themain centralplaza asasettlement grew, given that most plazas were hemmed in by pyramids, palaces, and ball courts. But if plaza size needed to keep up with population size (for whatever reason), the easiest way to do this was to add smaller, subsidiary plazas,

often at some distance from the central plaza. In Inomata’s(2006a:816) tableofplaza areas,he listssixplazasin additiontothe Great Plazaat Tikal, .ve plazas in addition to the Great Plaza at Copan, and one subsidiary plaza at Aguateca. Weshould notethat such subsidiary plazaswould have not been effectivefor mass spectator cere­monies, which require the entire population be together in one location in order to experience thesameevent.The presenceof such plazas thus provides anotherargumentagainstthe notionthat plazas were designed primarily for such mass ceremonies.Mostlarge Mesoamerican citiesare similar in having a single central plaza plus a number of smallerplazas.Although thelack of .rm dates on urbanexpansionatthese and other Mesoamerican cities prevents a de.nitive test of the hypothesis that subsidiary plazas were built after the central plaza, the fact that the relationship between population and totalplaza space is similar across three separate data sets, and across settlements inhabited for differing periods of time, argues against this alternative explanation for the sublinear scaling of plaza size. 
Another possibility is that the sublinear rela­tionships between estimated population and plaza space that we observe are an artifact of our populationestimates.Wethink otherwise for threereasons.First,errorsderivedfromthe appli­cationofanyconstantfactor,such as the number of persons per household,wouldhavenoimpact on theexponentof thescalingrelation andwould only affect the coef.cient. Second, in all cases, theexponentof thescalingrelationissomuch less than one that,inorder to make therelation linear, our population estimates would have to betoolargeby aboutapoweroftwo.Itishighly unlikely that these estimates are systematically offby somuch, and so thereisnorealisticway to translate our results into a linear relationship. Third,itis importantto emphasizethat our anal­ysis examines the average relationship between populationandplaza spaceatlogarithmicscales, soeven substantialerrorsinthe estimates we use forspeci.c sitesshouldnothavemuch impactso long as these errors are unstructured and do not expand exponentially with scale. For example, supposethat our estimatefor the populationof Tenochtitlan(ca. 200,000)is twiceaslargeasit shouldbe.Thelogarithm(base10)of 100,000 is 5, whereas the log (base 10) of 200,000 is 
5.3. So even if Tenochtitlan were only half as largeasthe commonlycitedvalue that we used, thiswouldreduce thelog-transformedvaluefor the population of this site by only 6%. This example shows that imprecision in estimates at linear scales is not a signi.cant problem when one is working at exponential scales. 
Following these considerations, we con­clude that the regression analyses presented in this article provide evidence against Inomata’s

suggestion that Maya public plazas (and, by extension, other Mesoamerican plazas) were planned andbuilt primarily to accommodatethe entire urban population simultaneously in mass spectator ceremonies. This does not mean that such ceremonies did not take place in Maya plazas; by analogy with Aztec ethnohistory, it would be expected that such ceremonies did occasionally take place. Butatthe Aztec capital Tenochtitlan at least, the per capita plaza area of 0.61 (m2 per person) suggests that it is unlikely that the entire urban population ever gathered in the various city plazas at the same time(despite theclaimsofthe chronicler Diego Durán, cited above). For smaller settlements, with larger per capita plaza areas,itis entirely possiblethat the entire populationdidgatherin plazas for a particular ceremony. Our results are consistent with the notion that Mesoamerican plazas were multifunctional places intended to host a variety of periodic activities, from mar­keting to ritual, although they should not be seen as providing direct empirical support for this interpretation.We acknowledgeaseriesof caveats about theplaza data(chronologies are rough,mapsmaynotallbeofthe same accuracy) and about our samples(they are not large),but despite these potentially confoundingfactors,we have identi.ed consistent and empirically robust patterns. 


Conclusions 
Our identi.cation of regular quantitative rela­tionships between plaza size and populationmay seem surprisingat .rst glance. TheseMesoamer­ican settlements not only experienced different sociological, cultural, economic, and techno­logical contexts but each also had experienced hundreds of years of growth and change. Over the course of their existence each settlement likely experienced periods of growth, stasis, and decline, and witnessed major demographic, economic, political, and spatialtransformations. From this rich historical perspective, one might expect the relationship between resident popu­lation and plaza area to have been exceptional and uniquein each Mesoamerican settlement.On one level this is true, as in no case do all the settlementsinagroup lineup along the best-.t line.Yetour datastill show that onaverage there is a consistent quantitative relationship between population and plaza area within individual set­tlement systems, and a consistent relationship across two of the three systems considered in this article. These results suggest that plazas were used forsimilarsuitesofactivitiesinsome kindofregular patternsinthePalenqueandLate Postclassic urban systems, and that plazas in the Mixtequilla system alsoexhibitregular patterns, although with different activities or participants than the other two systems. 
Our results make sense within a new per­spectivethat has emerged from empirical studies and theoretical considerations in a variety of disciplines (economics, geography, engineering, and complex systems) that showshow contem­porary cities share certain predictable quantita­tive properties.A number of quantitative urban variables—surface area, amount of infrastruc­ture, and a broad series of both positive and negativesocial outcomes—scalewith population inapredictablemanner (Bettencourt 2013;Youn et al. 2016). Our work has documented that thesesame quantitativescalingrelationships also hold, not only for cities before the modern era (Cesarettietal. 2016;Ortmanetal.2014;Ortman et al. 2016)but also forvillage-levelsettlement systems(Ortman and Coffey 2015). 
The results presented in the current article do not match any of the empirical scaling rela­tionships previously identi.ed for contemporary cities(Bettencourt 2013), and thereisno current quantitative model that explains the speci.c scaling exponent of 0.40 that we observe in two of thegroups.The coef.cient forthe Mixtequilla area—0.61—is withintherangeofknownvalues for the scaling relationship of both land area and infrastructurelengthwith population(Bet­tencourt 2013),butwedonot knowofbehavioral models that would associate plaza area with eitherof thosetwo urbanvariables. 
Additional empirical studies of the relation­ship between population and public gathering spaces, perhaps in societies where the uses of such spaces aremoredirectly attested, will likely be necessary beforeareasonableformalmodel oftherelationship canbedeveloped.Fornow,we simply emphasizethat thesublinear relationship between plaza area and population we observe

1. One historical case of a plaza designed for a speci.c spacing among participants in mass spectator ceremonies is the Zeppelin Field in Nuremberg, Ger­many, designed and built by Albert Speer for Nazi ral­lies 1933–1938. Speer(1985:165) wrotethathedesigned the parade grounds at 290 m by 312 m to hold 90,000 persons, which works out to a spacing of 
1.005m2 perperson.
