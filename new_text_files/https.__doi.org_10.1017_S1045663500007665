
DOMESTIC PRACTICE IN POSTCLASSIC SANTA ISABEL, NICARAGUA 
Geoffrey G. McCafferty 
Four seasons of excavation at the Santa Isabel site on the shore of Lake Nicaragua have recovered an extensive assemblage of material remains relating to Early Postclassic period (A.D. 800-1250) domestic practice. This paper reports initial pro­ject results, specifically relating to themes of architecture, foodways, specialized production, and belief systems. Excep­tional preservation of organic materials such as fauna/ and botanical remains, as well as bone tools, permits an expansive description of the material culture relating to household level consumption. Through the intensive coverage of 5 ha of the site center, including I0 house mounds, we see that intra-site variation also reflects community organization. Finally, Santa Isabel presents potential for inferring cultural relationships between central Mexico (based on ethnohistorical accounts) and Greater Nicoya.

ecent investigations at an Early Postclassic site in Pacific Nicaragua have recovered abundant material remains useful for inter­preting domestic practice. Santa Isabel is located on the shore of Lake Nicaragua, in the Greater Nicoya culture area (Figure 1 ). Greater Nicoya con­sists of Pacific Nicaragua and northwest Costa Rica, and is famous for being the southernmost frontier of 'Mesoamerica' during the Postclassic period (A.D. 900-1521; Carmack and Salgado 2006; Sal­gado and Vazquez 2006; Smith and Berdan 2003), when it was allegedly (based on various ethnohis­torical accounts) occupied by Nahuat-and Oto­Manguean-speakers with origins in the Mexican highlands (Abel-Vidor 1981; Chapman 1960; Fowler 1989; Healy 1988; Lange 1992-93; Le6n­Portilla 1972). The Santa Isabel Archaeological Project was designed to explore this Mesoameri­can connection through the excavation of a range of domestic contexts in order to recover materials suitable for comparison with known central Mex­ican patterns and ethnohistorically-derived behav­ioral models. 
Household archaeology has a distinguished his­tory in Mesoamerica (Ashmore and Wilk 1988; Hendon 1996; Robin 2003; Santley and Hirth 1993), where it has been used to infer socio-cultural behaviors such as residence patterns, domestic pro­duction, and ritual. As the principal locus of pro­d uc ti on and social reproduction, residential contexts hold potential for the interpretation of cul­tural identities including ethnicity, gender, and sta­tus. Household-level analysis is particularly suited for analogies with ethnographic case studies, result­ing in richly contextualized and anthropologically relevant interpretations (Blanton 1994; Douglass 2002; Wilk and Netting 1984; Wilk and Rathje 1982). A recent amplification of this is the archae-

ology of communities (Canuto and Yaeger 2000; Urban and Schortman 2004 ), where discerning intercommunity variability is the goal. 
On the other hand, household and community archaeologies have not been well-developed in Nicaragua, and the Santa Isabel project represents the most extensive application of these research objectives yet applied to the Greater Nicoya region. Previous research in the region has focused on set­tlement pattern survey (Niemel 2003; Salgado Gonzalez 1996), small-scale excavation (Espinoza et al. 1999; Healy 1980; Lange 1996), and the development of a local ceramic sequence (Abel­Vidor et al. 1987; Bonilla et al. i990; Healy 1980; Niemel et al. 1997). 
Due to the minimal archaeological research in Nicaragua, most cultural reconstructions rely heav­ily on sixteenth-and seventeenth-century ethno­historical accounts that describe Mesoamerican colonists in the region, including the Nahuat­speak:ing Nicarao and the Oto-Manguean Chorotega (Abel-Vidor 1981; Chapman 1960; Fowler 1989; Leon-Portilla 1972). Following these "mythstories," migrants from the Mexican highlands arrived in Greater Nicoya, perhaps in several successive waves beginning aboutA.D. 800. Spanish chroniclers such as Oviedo (1976[c. 1540]), Motolinfa(l951[1540]), and Torquemada ( 197 5-83 [ 1615]) describe the cul­tural practices of these groups, including their cal­endrical system, language, religion, and political structure. Based on strongly Mesoamerican char­acteristics, the accepted interpretation has been that these were Mesoamerican peoples, with the Chorotega as the likely occupants of the Rivas isth­mus during the Early Postclassic Sapoa period (A.D. 900-1350) and the Nahuat Nicarao controlling the region in the Late Postclassic Ometepe period (A.D. 1350-1 522). 
Santa Isabel was first recognized as an impor­tant Postclassic site by Gordon Willey and Albert Norweb in the late 1950s (Healy 1980; Norweb 1964), with approximately 40 low mounds. A regional survey by Karen Niemel (2003) identified it as the largest coastal site in the Rivas region for the Sapoa and Ometepe periods, covering 271 ha, and it was therefore a likely candidate for the ancient Nicarao capital of Quauhcapolca. The Santa Isabel Archaeological Project was initiated in 2000

ceramic analysis has been completed and a revised chronology can be proposed. It is worth noting, however, that the Santa Isabel occupation corre­sponds very closely to the "Middle Polychrome period" proposed by Healy (1980:302-308), as defined on the basis of absolute dates from the Greater Nicoya region. However, the prominence of diagnostic ceramics (e.g, Madeira, Vallejo, and Castillo Engraved) in the upper levels of Santa Isabel predate their supposed appearance in Healy' s "Las Lajas" phase of the "Late Polychrome Period." Until well-dated "Late Postclassic" remains have been analyzed we feel that it is premature to pro­pose a revised chronology for the region, but cau­ti on that such a revision will probably be necessary based on discrepancies present in the Santa Isabel ceramic sequence. 
In four field seasons roughly 5 ha in the site cen­ter have been surveyed using shovel tests to sam­ple subsurface artifact densities, and 10 low mounds have been tested (Figure 2). Shovel testing on a I 0 m grid provided a quick and efficient means for identifying artifact distributions, especially in areas of poor surface visibility, and they indicated likely areas for more extensive excavation. A shovel test was typically 40 cm in diameter, and usually reached about l m deep in fine sandy soil with min­imal noncultural inclusions and neutral acidity. All

soils were screened through 5 mm wire mesh to facilitate the recovery of small remains, and soil samples were floated and then sifted through fine mesh to search for small bones, seeds, and beads. Notably, clear discrepancies exist between mound areas where artifact quantities in the shovel tests regularly reached above 200 artifacts per shovel test, and off-mound areas where counts were usu­ally less than 25 artifacts per shovel test. This indi­cates a strong tendency to localize trash disposal around the living area with minimal sheet midden accumulation between mounds. Furthermore, because there is little evidence for intentional mound construction, artifacts found on the mounds generally relate to primary or secondary deposition by the mound occupants. 
Mounds 1, 3, 5, 6, and 8 were sampled with more extensive excavations to expose living surfaces; a total of 110 m2 have been excavated, usually to the first floor surface ( 40-60 cm below surface), or to sterile soil (2-3 m). Mound 1 (Loci 3 and 4) is the largest of the mounds tested, both in height and area. It was sampled previously by Norweb ( 1964; Healy 1980), and also by Niemel (2003). An addi­tional 24 m2 have been excavated by the Proyecto Santa Isabel, including a 10 m2 area that exposed a large section of a walking surface bounded by a wall. Mound 3 (Locus 1) measured about 3 m high, and has been sampled with 24 m2 of excavation units, some extending down to sterile soil 2.80 cm below the surface. Mound 5 (Locus 5) was only tested with four 1-x-1 m units, one of which was expanded to expose two burials, and two were placed over um burials exposed when a farmer planted a banana tree. Mound 6 (Locus 2) was a low mound (2 m), and the site of the most exten­sive excavation with 54 m2 of excavated area, including a large block of 24 m2 excavated to expose a series of floors and walls. In 2005, brief investigations took place at Mound 8 (Locus 7), a very low mound (1 m), where three l-x-1-m units were excavated. 
Extensive material culture, including excep­tional preservation of organic materials (bone, seeds and carbonized wood), provides an ample data base for interpreting domestic practice at Santa Isabel. About 400,000 artifacts have been classi­fied, over half of which are faunal remains. The fol­lowing discussion describes evidence for architecture, foodways, specialized production, and belief systems. Other analyses are ongoing, espe­cially of the ceramics and figurines. 
Architecture 
The Santa Isabel house mounds measure between 1 and 3 m in height, and are distributed across the level plain approximately 500 m from the lake shore. Additional mounds are closer to the shore, including Mound 4 that is both taller and steeper than the other mounds, and may be ceremonial in nature due to its distinctive form. A test pit into Mound 4 by Norweb is reported as including strat­ified remains from several time periods and a pos­sible floor (Healy 1980:56). Stratigraphic testing into Mounds 3, 6, and 8 reached sterile soil at about the same level as the surrounding plain, indicating that the mounds are artificial. Successive floor lev­els suggest that they are the result of sequential occupation layers all relating to the Early Post­classic period. 
Floors were often of packed earth, but some had grayish inclusions of compact sand. One such floor surface from Mound 6 was found at the same level in two operations separated by 10 m, suggesting that it may have been part of a longhouse structure. Another floor had sherds embedded in the surface, perhaps as intentional paving. The most elaborate floors were found at Mound 3, where a grayish conglomerate had a cement-like consistency. X-ray diffraction of the grayish material revealed a high incidence of phosphates, likely from an animal by­product added as a bonding agent. Deep strati­graphic pits in Mound 3 indicated a sequence of floors with similar consistency. Because this is the only mound where this cement-like material has been found, it may indicate a status distinction with greater investment in construction. 
No building stones or adobe bricks have been found. Walls seem to have been made of wattle and daub (bajareque), and amorphous lumps of adobe "melt" are common. Some pieces of cane­impressed daub have been found, suggesting at least some angled comers. A typical sequence is a layer of adobe melt covering a floor surface, with floor contact materials sealed between. A relatively intact collapsed wall was found at Mound 6. No foundations have been identified, though possible post-molds do occur. These were isolated, however, and no pattern could be discerned.

Other architectural features include hearths and in-floor pots. A hearth found at Mound 8 featured fire-hardened adobe and fire-cracked rock, and con­tained carbonized jocote seeds. A large piece of car ­bonized wood from the feature was dated 910 ± 50 
B.P. (AD. 1030-1190, 1 sigma; Beta 217131; Stu­iver et al. 1998). A hearth found in a deep level of Mound 6 was dug into a packed walking surface that featured flecks of white ash and charcoal around the hole. A possible storage pit near the hearth contained numerous deer bones. Large frag­ments of an olla were found in a hole dug into the surface of the cement-like floor in Mound 3. 
While the mounds indicate that they were built up gradually through successive occupation levels, some evidence exists for more deliberate mound construction. At Mound 1, for example, a packed earth floor was covered with a 10-30 cm thick layer ofsterile sand and then a 10-20 cm thick layer of large ceramic fragments, suggesting intentional fill to raise the mound height. Evidence of intentional mound construction was also found at Mound 6, where a thick sherd layer covered the sherd­embedded floor. Despite these two examples of intentional deposition, the ubiquitous domestic debris indicates that these mounds were primarily residential in nature and probably not the result of large scale architectural investment. 
Although effort was made for broad horizontal exposures of architectural plans, no complete struc­tures were defined. The preliminary conclusions are that the people of Santa Isabel lived in structures made of perishable materials that required periodic renewal. Mound 3 featured the most intact sequence, where eight floors were found spanning about 450 years, suggesting that the renewal may have occurred several times per century. The pos­sible longhouse at Mound 6 may correspond with multi-family or extended family residences. A res­idential plan from Contact-period Tecoatega shows longhouses of post and beam construction with thatch roofs, designed for the cacique and his wives (Oviedo, in Healy 1980:27). 
Food ways 
The concentrated evidence of food residues and artifacts for food preparation are diagnostic traits of domestic space. The mounds at Santa Isabel fea­ture a very high incidence of faunal remains, as well as carbonized seeds and artifacts associated with food preparation such as grater blades (raspaditas ), manos, metates, and cooking vessels. This assem­blage relates collectively to the food ways practiced atthe site, and represents a sensitive means ofinfer­ring group identity. For example, different ethnic groups often have food preferences, in kind or in preparation. Status differences may be exhibited in differential access to foods, perhaps with more meat available to higher status individuals. Cross­culturally, women are often associated with food preparation, so areas within a site with a high inci­dence of cooking tools may be identifiable as female space. Based on these lines of evidence, a focus on domestic contexts was integral to the research goals of the Santa Isabel project. 
The excellent soil conditions at the site greatly facilitated preservation of organic remains, espe­cially animal bone and carbonized wood and seeds. Animal bone accounted for well over half of all arti­facts collected, and fish bones made up the major­ity of the identified faunal remains (Table 2). The fish were all from the nearby lake, with species of the genus Cichlasoma as the major types consumed (Hoar 2006). Boney scales of gar (Lepisosteus sp.) were also found in abundance, though bones of this species were not identified. The predominance of fish remains contradicts the findings of Pohl and Healy ( 1980) who, based on the initial work at the site by Willey and N orweb, were forced to conclude

that fish was not a significant part of the diet (they did, however, comment on the abundance of net sinkers as evidence that fishing was likely prac­ticed). The discrepancy is likely the result of the more intensive collection strategy employed in con­trast to the methods of the late 1950s. Ceramic net weights indicate that net fishing was likely a promi­nent method for catching fish (Figure 3a), as is presently practiced by local fishermen. Small bone fish hooks suggest that bait fishing was also prac­ticed (Figure 3b ). 
Fresh water clams and apple snails were also consumed, particularly at Mound 3. Local infor­mants report that snails are collected from streams flowing into the lake at the end of the rainy season. Ocean shell was also found at the site, but evidence of cut marks on the shell indicates that they may have been used more for jewelry production than food, as discussed below. 
Deer was the most important mammal con­sumed; other important mammals included rabbit, peccary, and armadillo (L6pez-Forment Villa 2007). Notably there were almost no dog remains found, in contrast to expectations based on ethno­historical sources. Reptiles were also common in the diet, especially iguana, snake, and turtle (Hoar 2006). The preliminary analysis showed bird bones as prominent, possibly including some turkey. Con­sumption of these classes of animals is compara­ble to results previously reported from the Rivas area by Pohl and Healy ( 1980), and from the San Cristobal site on the shore of Lake Managua (Rew­niak and Healy 2006). 
Besides the artifacts associated with fishing, other objects provide insight into food procure­ment and preparation. Bifacially flaked projectile points may have been used on spears to hunt deer and peccary (Figure 3c ). Small ceramic pellets were probably used as blow-gun projectiles to hunt birds and lizards .. Blow-gun pellets can be distinguished from rattle-balls out of hollow supports because they are relatively larger (about 1 cm in diameter as opposed to about .5 cm), and are smoothed and symmetrical (due to rolling during manufacture) as opposed to irregular (McCafferty 1992; Ventura 2003). Knapped and polished andesite tools may have been used as choppers for clearing trees, or as hoes to cultivate root crops. 
Evidence for food preparation is found in an abundant assemblage (n=36l l) of small chert

blades (Figure 4 ). Jolene Debert (2005; Debert and Sheriff 2007) has demonstrated that these show evidence of use polish on the wider end and haft­ing scars on the narrow tip, similar to the pattern found on grater blades for manioc and other tubers from Lower Central America and South America (Perry 2005). Groundstone tools of basalt resem­ble the manos and metates of Mesoamerica, where they were used for grinding maize. While this is a likely function it should be noted that no maize has been found among the macrobotanical remains, in contrast to other paleobotanical collections from Managua (Dickau 1999). The predominant seed recovered wasjocote (Spondeas purpurea), a small fruit that is currently consumed raw, cooked as a soup, or fermented into a tart wine. Other seeds included beans, cacao, andparaiso (possibly China berry, Melia azedarach L.). 
Utilitarian ceramics are consistently necked jars (ollas) or open pots (cazuelas), suggesting that liq­uid foods dominated (Steinbrenner 2002). Notably absent in the assemblage are comales, large grid­dles associated with the heating of tortillas in cen­tral Mexican contexts. Serving vessels also indicate that liquid foods were consumed, as virtually all are of high walled bowls or bottles. A large pro­portion of serving wares are decorated in a variety of polychrome types and varieties, suggesting that meals may have been important social events for the communication of symbolic information. 
Specialized Production 
In addition to subsistence related artifacts, Santa Isabel produced many objects related to specialized production. These data provide insight into the value system of the community as well as regional interaction. The discrete distributions of related artifacts indicate specialization between the dif­ferent households. 
Lithic debris was found at all site loci, suggest­ing that tool manufacture or modification was widely practiced. Thousands of small chert flakes were recovered, in contrast to the relatively few fin­ished lithic tools (Table 3). Hammer stones and deer antlers with evidence of knapping were also found. The chert grater blades discussed above were likely made from flakes. The predominant lithic material is a whitish color with inclusions that is described variously as chert or chalcedony (Debert 2005). A second material, accounting for about 3 percent of the total lithic assemblage, is a dark red chert with white inclusions. There was a preference for the reddish chert in large tools, such as projectile points, while the grater blades are exclusively of the whitish material. Prismatic blades of transparent gray obsidian were also present, but obsidian represents Jess than .4 percent of the lithic assemblage. Healy et al. (1996) report that obsid­ian from the Rivas area, including the Santa Isabel site, came from the Ixtepeque source in Guatemala. 
Another prominent class of specialized artifacts related to textile production. Ceramic spindle whorls and bone weaving tools were found in all contexts, but with concentrations at Mounds 3 and 
6. Spindle whorls came in several forms and sizes, suggesting that multiple fiber types were in use for a variety of thread qualities (McCafferty and McCafferty 2000, 2008a; Figure 5a). A wide range of bone tool types was found, including needles, awls, picks, and battens (Figure 5b). Ceramic fig­urines indicate that textiles were probably worn as skirts and shawls on women, and as capes on men. Another major use for thread would have been for fishing nets and hammocks. While thread produc­tion was likely done by all households, specialized textile production was probably localized at Mound 6 as 68 percent of the bone tools were found there. 
There is also evidence for local production of the spinning and weaving tools themselves. Re­utilized sherd disks were found with evidence of drilling and unfinished edges, as indication of the production of sherd spindle whorls. Cut marks on bones indicate the production process for weaving tools. 
Local production of other classes of bone objects was also found. Saw-cut deer bones are similar in
