of execution for enemy villagers who were swiftly killed but not evidently sacri.ced in a religious sense at Punta Lobos, discussed in a chapter by Verano and Sara Phillips. As victims’ identities changed, so did the premortem and postmortem treatment of sacri.ced bodies. Scale – the number of victims – and tempo – the frequency of sacri.ce events – also seem to have been quite malleable. These remarkable paradoxes of conti­nuity and change are on full display in this book. While the physical motions of killing remained essentially the same, the victims, the context, the audience, the rulers, and perhaps the supernatural beings, changed radically and so, we must assume, did the meanings of these violent performances for those involved. 
Standing in contrast with blood sacri.ce are forms of killing that kept the body intact, such as strangula­tion or live interment. They are discussed in several of the chapters, including one by David Chicoine for Huambacho in the Nepeña valley, and by Sylvia Bentley and Klaus for retainer burials over time. These “quieter” kinds of sacri.ce were usually associated with different categories of victims than blood sacri.ce (e.g., women versus men), with different social classes of practitioners (as Klaus and Shimada argue for Sican versus Muchik sacri.ces in Lambayeque), with different contexts (retainers and dedicatory burials versus offerings), and with speci.c ritual meanings, as in Inca capac hucha sacri.ces. Chicoine argues that, for the Moche, different metaphors of animal preda­tion informed blood sacri.ce (felines) and ligature (constrictor serpents). Given the lasting importance of blood sacri.ce, bloodless sacri.ce may have been performed in deliberate counterpoint to it, constructing distinct categories of victims for distinct kinds of occasions. These correspondences shifted over time and space, however, and are still poorly understood. Retainer burials, which may have been quite variable in practice, pose a particularly dif.cult challenge for interpretation. Two chapters, by Catherine Gaither and colleagues on Santa Rita B (in Chao) and by Elsa Tomasto-Cagigao and colleagues on San Jose de Moro, address Late Moche to Transitional period interments that accompanied principal individuals. A few bear perimortem blunt-force trauma, and atypical body positions and postmortem manipulation suggest retainer sacri.ce while defying easy categorization. 
One particularly interesting angle of the book is the explicit consideration of the link between human sacri.ce and the destruction of non-human beings. Paul Szpak and colleagues offer a thoughtful discus­sion of sacri.ced camelids at Huancaco in Virú and beyond. Sacri.ced camelids were sometimes treated in very similar ways to human victims, possibly con­sidered analogous. The smashing, “decapitation,” and “wounding” of ceramics, especially anthropomorphic vessels, also accompanied human sacri.ce, and in some cases may have stood in for it (discussed in chapters by Jean-François Millaire and others). These points reinforce the notion that while sacri.cial liturgy on the North Coast appears conservative in some respects, it was in many ways highly amenable to substitution and innovation. 
Through the meticulous documentation of sacri.­cial violence that took place over more than a thousand years, these authors have achieved remarkable insights and amassed material for a deeper understanding of how ritual tradition works and how it evolves. It is therefore slightly disappointing that Klaus and Toyne do not attempt a more ambitious synthesis with their introductory chapter. While they lay out some conceptual tools from general theoretical literature on sacri.ce, these tools remain mostly unused. However, perhaps it is premature to desire synthesis from a .eld in such rapid .ux, treating such a multivalent phenomenon. This new volume impressively captures the current state of knowledge about North Coast sacri.ce in all its hair-raising speci.city.

The link between objects and the social and cultural behaviors responsible for their manufacture, distri­bution, meaning, and use remains one of the most dif.cult, if not contentious, parts of archaeological interpretation. This book presents case studies about the social dimensions of learning that lie behind objects. Centered around the notion of ‘communities of practice’, the book crosses disciplinary boundaries: six are archeological, two are ethnographic, and one uses a historical approach. Only two use data from Latin America; the remainder uses data from the Southwest (N = 2), the Southeast (N = 2), and Africa (N = 3). 
As the book covers such diverse areas and disci­plines, it might seem that it would not be relevant to the readers of Latin American Antiquity. To the contrary, the theme of the book focuses on the concepts of com­munities of practice, situated learning, constellations of practice, and associated concepts that can be applied in any area.

LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 28, No. 4, 2017] 
The .rst case study by Olivier Gosselain recon­structs the history of the Niger River Polychrome Tradition (Africa). He explores the contexts in which potters developed social relations and were exposed to practices that transformed their practice of potting. He shows how the circulation of people, things, and ideas within and between places channeled the propagation of their practices that varied as the result of the chaînes operatoires among the producers over a wide area, and were in.uenced by markets, marriage, social struc­tures, geography, and migration along fertile valleys and main roads. A second factor contributing to this variability was the power relations that blocked the circulation of knowledge. Gosselain says that forms and decoration are structured by existing grammars and repertoires by shared patterns within a community, by the taste of clients in local markets, by practices in other material realms that have led to innovations, and by the development of regional stylistic variants. He concludes that the relative homogeneity and geo­graphical scope of this style should not mislead one to believe that it is rooted in a long and coherent history. 
Patricia Crown explores why vessels of two wares from the U.S. Southwest (White Mountain Redware and Cibola Whiteware) often used the same designs except for an orange slip on the redware. Both were made in the same villages and apparently by the same potters, yet redware vessels had few examples of involvement by learners; whiteware vessels had far more examples of crudely painted vessels, apparently produced by nascent potters. Redware vessels, Crown argues, were the products of potters who .rst learned how to make whiteware vessels either alone or in col­laboration with other potters. Redware vessels, on the other hand, were the product of skilled potters who had access to secret knowledge of sources and production rights that were restricted during great social change when new migrants were moving southward from the northern Southwest. Using ethnographic information and a large number of vessels from museum collec­tions, her work shows the methodological value of comparing large numbers of vessels of two different wares. 
Elliot Blair focuses on diverse glass bead assem­blages from colonial Spanish Florida that index mul­tiple intersecting communities of practice, speci.­cally communities of manufacturing and consumption. Using a social network approach to consider some of the scalar ambiguity inherent in the community of practice concept, Blair argues that interrelated communities of practice (production, distribution, and consumption) are better understood as unfolding into each other and across lived pathways, as a scaleless process of constellating practices. 
Andrew Roddick explores how the recon.guration of power relationships during a period of social and economic change affected learning in communities of potters in the Lake Titicaca Basin, Bolivia. His ultimate goal was to move beyond the traditional use of pottery to reveal the power relations of learned practices and the struggles and creativity inherent in everyday life in turbulent times that might relate to the emergence of the urban center of Tiwanaku at the end of the Late Formative (AD 450–1000). 
Historian Mark Harris’s article on the Lower Ama­zon uses historical data to show how learning patterns followed the path of the rivers. Amazonian archae­ologists will recognize that this pattern is ancient, and it also accounts for the hypothetical pathways of language learning, the movement of the knowledge of certain pottery styles, and the preparation practices used for different varieties of manioc. 
Ann Stahl’s article on the communities in West Africa explores how communities and constellations of practice recon.gured themselves in relation to the dynamics from the thirteenth through the mid-seventeenth centuries, showing how circulations of people, objects, and knowledge contributed to continu­ities and discontinuities in ceramic production. In the end, Stahl argues that communities of practice, both nested and emergent, “crafted life in turbulent times by drawing on the known while creatively incorporating the novel as they grappled with the shifting terrains of connection, power, and violence of recent centuries in ways that archaeological assemblages hold promise to illuminate” (209). 
Focusing on the notion of meaning in communities of practice, David Schoenbrun explores the emergence of a community of practice engaged with shrines dedicated to forging connections among dispersed communities of other practices such as ironwork, canoe-building, healing, and .shing along the shores of Lake Victoria in East Africa before AD 1000. 
Barbara Mills extends the notion of community of practice to practices of consumption. Cuisines consist of the choices that people make in the way that food is prepared, in the type of containers in which it was served, and to whom it was served. Using late prehispanic period ceramics from the American Southwest, she shows how networks were created by the accumulation of choices made by communities of consumption, and maps these networks as webs of interaction of people and things across space and through time. The growth and disappearance of these networks over time reveal social relations at multiple social, temporal, and spatial scales.

This book contains fascinating, creative, path-breaking, and methodologically unique chapters, but the lexical elaboration, resulting semantic complexity, and the use of quotes for cross-referencing similar ideas of other authors gets in the way of a clear and convincing discourse that might be useful for those who are not familiar with the terminology that emerged from the authors’ face-to-face community of practice that led to the present volume. 
Cuban Archaeology in the Caribbean.IVAN ROKSANDIC, editor. 2016. University of Florida Press, Gainesville. xii + 291 pp. $84.95 (cloth), ISBN 978-1-68340-002-8.

Until recently, Cuban archaeology was not well known among Caribbean archaeologists. The more than 50 years of blockade affected not only the economy but also academia. Travel limitations and polarizing ide­ologies of both sides limited the degree and timing of communication, interaction, and exchange of ideas. As a result, Cuba produced a local archaeology somewhat in.uenced by Soviet archaeology, with the rest of the islands informed by the Anglo-European tradition. Exchange of information was dif.cult and limited. However, Cuban academia did not isolate itself and for the most part had no desire to do so. Although prejudices developed on both sides, the cessation of communication came largely from outside the island. Notable exceptions were Betty Megger’s continuous support of Cuban archaeology throughout the Cold War era (and I may add, at her personal risk), and Kathleen Deagan’s partnering with Cuban colleagues. 
This hardened intradisciplinary boundary, how­ever, began to crack 20 years ago with the publi­cation in English of a book by Dacal Moure and Rivero de la Calle in 1996, followed later by other publications. Several foreign archaeologists came over in the 1990s to conduct research on the island. The development of the internet and access to e-mail facilitated communication and exchange of informa­tion. Arguably the most important catalyst promot­ing intradisciplinary communication, however, was a young generation of Cuban colleagues who reached out to other Caribbeanists. Thanks to all these efforts, today Cuba is represented in all venues of Caribbean archaeology. 
It is within this historical context that this volume comes to light. Although several articles are related to the project at Canímar Abajo, a considerable number of papers are the product of other research. Edited by Ivan Roksandic, this volume has 13 chapters: the introduction, 11 articles, and .nal commentary. In the introduction, the editor summarizes the chapters and puts the contribution of Cuban archaeology into historical perspective. 
The .rst two chapters deal with the possibility of direct contact and migration between Cuba and Nicaragua. Chapter 1, by Roksandic (editor), consists of a review and summary of evidence for the possi­bility of people from Nicaragua migrating to Cuba by making stopovers in the many keys between the two regions. This is supported by recent .nds of Central American material in the Greater Antilles, the preliminary results of Roksandic’s linguistic study in Cuba, and the fact that modern .shermen from Nicaragua travel to distant islands along this route for their abundant .sheries. 
Sagrario Balladares Navarro and Leonardo Lechado Ríos (chapter 2) review the archaeology, chronology, and material culture of eastern Nicaragua. The chapter is very informative for those, such as myself, not familiar with this region. The review is thorough and provides information on cultural and chronological sequences and on human-landscape interaction. 
David G. Smith (chapter 3) presents a summary of the results of the project in an early Archaic site of Canímar Abajo and includes a description of the site, its deposits, some of the .ndings, and its chronology. Canímar Abajo consists of two superimposed ceme­teries separated by a shell deposit and extending over a thousand years, suggesting a long use of “sacred” space. Other unique .nds are dental mutilations in an early Precolumbian context. 
Chapter 4, by Roberto Rodríguez Suárez and colleagues, presents a successful experimental study of the use of Congo red dye to identify activities related to food preparation in starch grains, such as grinding and various degrees of boiling. 
In chapter 5, Mirjana Roksandic uses the juvenile-adult ratio and mean child mortality rates as proxies for mobility and fertility in the Young and Old cemeteries in Canímar Abajo. Although I disagree with the author’s claim that the cemeteries represent normal populations, she found that the individuals interred in the Young Cemetery seem to have had higher mobility than those of the Old Cemetery.
