UNDERSTAND ING WARI STATE EXPANSION: 
A "BOTTOM-UP" APPROACH AT THE VILLAGE 
OF AK' AW ILLAY, CUSCO, PERU 

Veronique Belisle 
This paper documents how ancient state expansion affected local communities. Many scholars have argued that the Wari state of Middle Horizon (A.D. 600-1000) Peru established direct imperial control over several provinces. Archaeologists have studied large Wari sites using a "top-down" approach, but rarely have they studied local settlements to see how and if local populations were affected by the expansion of the Wari into their regions. My research takes a complementary "bot­tom-up" approach and examines the impact of Wari state expansion on the village of Ak'awillay in the Cusco region. 1 report on the excavation of contexts dating to the Middle Horizon and earlier periods at the site. These provide a unique perspective for evaluating change through time and assessing local responses to Wari expansion. Results suggest that most of the changes seen at Ak' awillay occurred before the arrival of Wari colonists in Cusco. Their presence had minimal impact on the daily lives of the villagers of Ak'awillay, although it provided new exchange opportunities that local leaders may have used for their benefit. Like other early states elsewhere, the Wari state may have controlled a small area around its colony but had a limited impact on more distant communities. 
En este artfculo se documenta el impacto de la expansion de los estados antiguos sobre las poblaciones locales. Muchos arque­6logos han propuesto que el estado wari estableci6 un control imperial directo sobre varias provincias de! Peru durante el Horizonte Medio (600-1000 d.C.). La capital wari y los grandes sitios waris afuera de Ayacucho han sido investigados, pero raras veces se estudiaron los sitios locales para entender c6mo las poblaciones fueron afectadas por la expansion de! estado wari en su region. La investigaci6n presentada aqu{ utiliza una perspectiva complementaria y examina el impacto de la expansion wari sobre el pueblo antiguo de Ak'awillay en la region del Cusco. Los contextos excavados en el sitio pertenecen no solo al Horizonte Medio sino tambien a los periodos anteriores. La comparaci6n de estos contextos proporciona una pers­pectiva unica para evaluar los cambios a !raves del tiempo y entender las reacciones locales frente a la intrusion wari. Los resultados sugieren que la mayor{a de los cambios enAk'awillay ocurri6 antes de la llegada de los Waris en el Cusco. Durante el Horizonte Medio la presencia wari tuvo un impacto mfnimo en la vida diaria de la mayor fa de los comuneros de Ak 'awillay, pero proporcion6 nuevas oportunidades de intercambio que las elites locales podrfan haber utilizado para su propia ventaja. Como los estados antiguos en otras partes del mundo, el estado wari pudo haber controlado un area pequeiia alrededor de su colonia en Cusco, en tanto que deja pocas huellas sobre las comunidades locales que viv{an a cierta distancia de las ins­talaciones coloniales. 
he study of state expansion often begins Twith a detailed examination of the capital and presumed administrative hierarchy. This "top-down" approach privileges large set­tlements associated with the expansionary state, focusing on rulers, administrators, and craft spe­cialists. It emphasizes the ways in which the center of the state maintained contact with its colonies or provinces through an infrastructure of roads, secondary centers, way stations, and forts. Al­though fundamental to understanding strategies 
of state expansion and consolidation, this approach often leaves aside the smaller settlements that were included in the state and the local villagers who may have come into contact with state rep­resentatives. The investigation of capitals and re­gional administrative centers alone cannot explain how the expansion of the polity affected local populations. Furthermore, it does not indicate whether and to what extent the expansionary polity controlled or influenced the people and re­sources of a region. To get a more complete picture

of how ancient states operated, it is crucial to adopt a complementary "bottom-up" perspective and understand how local people experienced col­onization or incorporation into an expanding polity (e.g., Bermann 1994; Brumfiel 1991; D'Altroy and Hastorf 2001; Goldstein 2005). 
State expansion involves the interaction of three groups: (1) the local population already liv­ing in a region, which may be heterogeneous; (2) the intrusive colonists or state officials, who may be from the center, from other regions within the state , or local; and (3) the heartland or state center (Stein 2005). Colonists ideally maintain contact with their communities of origin, but equally im­portant is the fact that they develop a variety of relationships with local communities. Rather than being passive recipients of a "donor" culture , local communities often coexist in symbiotic and complex ways with an expanding state (e.g., Di­etler 1998; Jennings 2006a; Schortman and Urban 1998; Stein 2002a, 2005). Interactions between local populations and intrusive colonists can take multiple forms, including trade, exchange, diplo­macy, feasting, ritual cooperation, intermarriage, emulation, war, control, or coercion. Interaction between local communities and expanding states is not always structured in asymmetrical ways and is not unidirectional; it can be accompanied by changes in the life and culture of both parties (e.g., Lightfoot and Martinez 1995; Rogers 1990; Yao 2008). 
This paper discusses the case of the Wari state of Middle Horizon Peru (A.D. 600-1000). Many scholars have argued that the Wari conquered widely and established direct imperial control over several provinces (e.g., Isbell 1989, 1997; Lumbreras 1974; McEwan 2005 a; Nash and Williams 2009; Schreiber 1992, 2001). Archae­ologists have studied the Wari capital, its heart­land, and large Wari sites outside the heartland, but rarely have they undertaken work at smaller, local settlements to see how and if local popula­tions were affected by the expansion of the Wari into their areas. I take a "bottom-up" approach and evaluate how the occupants of the village of Ak' awillay in the Cusco region were affected by the presence of nearby Wari colonies (Figure 1). Data on settlement patterns, domestic architec­ture, household activities, and exchange provide a new perspective on Wari presence in Cusco. 
Impact of State Expansion: 
The Local Perspective 

Impact on Local Communities 
Local reactions to state expansion are more com­plex than the simple dichotomy of "incorporated community" vs. "resisting community." States can affect local populations in diverse ways, and com­munities can respond to state expansion in equally diverse ways (e.g., Berdan et al. 1996; D'Altroy and Hastorf 2001; Hastorf 1990; Morris 1998; Schreiber 1987; Sinopoli 1994, 2001). The impact of intrusive political authority on local groups of­ten varies both within individual communities and 
from area to area within the state. State officials do not always administer a contiguous territory, nor are they necessarily interested in-or capable of-controlling all the communities they en­counter (e.g., Bauer and Covey 2002; Berdan et al. 1996; Sinopoli 2001). Some communities are heavily affected and transformed, while others are largely unaffected and maintain their autonomy. The impact of an expanding state may be dispro­portionately experienced by certain segments of local societies (e.g., elites vs. commoners and men vs. women) such that the impact of state expansion may vary even within individual communities or from house to house. 
The relationship between local populations and an expansionary state should be expected to vary over time. In the early stages of expansion (and sometimes longer) , each subjugated polity or community might be administered differently depending on local histories, state interests, and processes of incorporation, among other factors (Berdan et al. 1996; Earle and D'Altroy 1989; Morris 1998; Sinopoli 1994). In addition, expan­sionary polities do not always succeed or wish to establish asymmetrical relationships with local groups (Jennings 2006b; Schortman and Urban 1998; Sinopoli 2001; Stein 2002a, 2002b, 2005; Topic and Topic 2010), nor are they always in­terested in or capable of changing local cultures. When an expansionary state is colonial, colonies are often intended to provide economic opportu­nities or to relieve demographic pressures in the metropole, and the state does not always have mechanisms for governing non-citizens. 
Many studies have emphasized the dramatic consequences of state expansion by studying how

entire villages moved closer to agricultural fields, state roads, or state supervision (e.g., Schreiber 1987); how tribute obligations transformed local diets and reduced the time available for other household activities (e.g., Bermann 1994; Brum­fiel 1991; Cutright 2010; Hastorf 1990); or how heavy tribute burdens led to complaints, uprisings, and rebellions, which in tum sometimes led to the destruction of entire ethnic groups (e.g., Pat­terson 1991:104, 111-114).Although state intru­sion often did disrupt the lives of local popula­tions, in certain cases communities or their leaders were able to manipulate interaction with state representatives for their own benefit. 
An increasing number of scholars now em­phasize the idea that interaction and state expan­sion created new opportunities for local commu­nities or certain members of local communities (Castillo 200 l; Goldstein 2000; Helms 1979; Jen­nings 2010; Junker et al. 1994). Interaction with state officials and with the already established network of far-flung exchange partners of the state provided certain individuals or families with access to new commodities, prestige goods, and ideas. These items were carefully selected, rede­fined, and contextualized locally; they were not intrinsically desirable and were given a meaning that could be quite different from the meaning

that these items had in their original metropolitan context (e.g., Dietler 1998; Marcus 2003; Smith 1998; Stein 2002b; Thomas 1991; Yao 2008). 
Competing lineages or local leaders often used these exotic goods and esoteric knowledge to dis­play connections to others, enhance and legitimize their prestige at home, and differentiate them­selves from the other members of their own com­munity (Dietler 1998; Earle 1991; Helms 1979; Junker et al. 1994) . In many contexts, such indi­viduals increased their status locally and region­ally by organizing exchange and facilitating state access to resources, labor, and trade routes. As a result, exotic goods are not only a measure of external "influence" on local communities but also an indicator of local dynamics. When colonies were extensions of the metropole rather than nodes for dominating local populations, the presence of colonists often intensified competition for prestige goods and altered the balance of power among local societies (e.g., Covey 2006:78; Smith 1998). Local leaders often sought increased trade and welcomed colonization as a means of enhancing and reinforcing their own prestige and power (Dietler 1998:305). 
Household Archaeology 
The study of the impact of state expansion on lo­cal communities is often a study of change-or lack thereof-through time. The comparison of houses that were occupied before and during state expansion can reveal both local cultural change and the impact of intrusive political authority on local families (e.g., Bermann 1994; Brumfiel 1991; D' Al troy and Hastorf 2001; Falconer 1995). On the synchronic level, household ar­chaeology provides valuable information on the contexts in which material culture associated with an expanding state is found. The simple presence of foreign items is , of course, not an indication of foreign conquest, incorporation, or domination. People procure or emulate the material culture of a state for various reasons. State items could be limited to the house of a local leader or to a local public building or temple, or they could be ubiquitous and reflect a more pervasive influence on all segments of society. 
One key to investigating the nature of the im­pact of the Wari state in Cusco is to excavate a local village occupied before and during Wari presence. By comparing the activities, artifact in­ventories, features, and architecture of houses oc­cupied before and during Wari expansion at the village of Ak'awillay, this paper documents do­mestic changes from one period to the next and evaluates whether any of those changes can be related to wider regional processes-that is, the presence of Wari colonies in the Cusco region. This paper also examines the contexts in which Wari material culture appears at the site in order to evaluate the degree and nature of Wari influ­ence on local people. Before presenting the case of Ak'awillay, the following section reviews the evidence gathered at the large Wari settlements in Cusco. 
The Wari State and the 
Wari Colony in Cusco 

During the Middle Horizon, the site ofWari grew to become an urban center that dominated the Ayacucho region in the central highlands of Peru. Its distinctive architecture and polychrome pottery started to appear at villages and towns beyond Ayacucho, leading many scholars to argue that the Wari state conquered widely and established direct control over several provinces (Bergh 2012; Isbell 1989, 1997; Isbell and McEwan 1991; Lumbreras 1974; McEwan 2005a; Menzel 1964; Nash and Williams 2009; Ochatoma and Cabrera 2001; Schreiber 1987, 1992, 2001). Most of these researchers have focused on the Wari capital, its heartland, and large Wari sites outside the heart­land, and rarely (e.g., Jennings, ed. 2010) have scholars studied smaller settlements to explore how local populations were affected by the ex­pansion of the Wari into other regions. 
The Wari colony in Cusco is often used as the case study par excellence to show how Wari au­thorities extracted local labor to build impressive administrative facilities, transformed the local landscape into highly productive maize-growing lands, and controlled local communities and re­sources 300 km away from their homeland (e.g., McEwan, ed. 2005; Schreiber 1992). While Wari construction in the region is impressive and con­stitutes the largest Wari settlement recorded out­side of the Wari capital, this reconstruction of Wari dominance is based solely on data recovered at the Wari sites in the area.

The Wari constructed a single cluster of set­tlements to the southeast of the modem city of Cusco. This cluster includes the Huaro archaeo­logical complex and Pikillaqta (see Figure 1). The Huaro archaeological complex includes res­idential settlements, temples, and cemeteries in the Huaro Valley near the modem town of Urcos. Although no radiocarbon dates are available from Huaro, Glowacki and McEwan (Glowacki 2002; Glowacki and McEwan 2002) have proposed that it was the main center of Wari activities through­out the Middle Horizon; the Wari first settled there and later started to build Pikillaqta from Huaro. 
McEwan (2005a), who excavated at Pikillaqta in the Lucre Basin, argues that it served a cere­monial and administrative function. He concluded that no one lived permanently at the site; instead, Wari officials worshipped the mummies of an­cestors and feasted with their subjects as a form of reciprocity for labor extraction. This interpre­tation is heavily based on analogy with the Inka, despite research on Wari and Inka mortuary prac­tices showing that the two differed significantly. Many Wari burials in Ayacucho included a small opening that allowed descendants to give offer­ings to their ancestors (but not take out whole bodies), suggesting that the Wari were visiting the tombs of the dead rather than incorporating the mummies of their ancestors into their ritual activities (Isbell 2004:28). The presence of mum­mies in Middle Horizon Cusco still has to be demonstrated, although they appear to be docu­mented in the Formative (Davis 2011). If the Wari did worship mummies at Pikillaqta, this could suggest a Wari manipulation of local religious practices-and an ideology built on local, rather than state, beliefs and values-rather than the en­actment of a Wari tradition. 
The Wari arrived in Cusco early in the Middle Horizon. Calibrated dates from Pikillaqta indicate that the Wari were already established in the area and had built at least parts of Pikillaqta by A.D. 650 and perhaps even earlier (Glowacki 2005a:ll6; Glowacki and McEwan 2002). The latest radiocarbon dates from Pikillaqta suggest that the site continued to be partially occupied and under construction during the second half of the Middle Horizon (A.D. 800-1000), perhaps even until around A.D. 1100 (Glowacki 2005a:ll6). The site was finally sacked, burned, and abandoned. 
Research conducted at the Huaro archaeolog­ical complex and at Pikillaqta demonstrate a strong relationship between the Wari settlements in Cusco and the Wari capital in Ayacucho. A Wari colony did exist in Cusco, and evidence from architecture, pottery, and burials indicates that colonists maintained a Wari identity. Nonetheless, the kinds of relationships that the Wari colonists developed with local populations remain unclear. The hypothesis that the Wari en­gaged in asymmetrical relationships with the peo­ple of Cusco and effectively controlled the region still needs to be evaluated with survey and exca­vation data from local communities. 
Regional Assessment of Wari Influence outside the Wari Colony 
Over the last two decades, archaeologists have conducted a series of intensive, systematic full­coverage surveys in the Cusco region (Bauer 1999, 2004; Belisle 2014; Covey 2006, 2014; Covey et al. 2008; Covey 2013; Kosiba 2010). These surveys have identified more than 3 ,000 archaeological sites of all periods over an area of 2,000 km2• Results demonstrate continuity in re­gional settlement patterns during the time ofWari presence in the region, providing a picture of Middle Horizon Cusco that is very different from the one offered by research at the large Wari in­stallations. 
Most changes in the settlement patterns of the region occurred in the Early Intermediate period 
(A.D. 200-600), before the Wari arrived. During this period, local populations abandoned hilltop sites for lower, less defensible locations close to productive valley-bottom lands. Regional polities appear to have developed in the Cusco Basin and in the Xaquixaguana Plain. During the Middle Horizon, most settlements continued to be occu­pied, people continued to live in lower-elevation villages close to maize lands, and the same set­tlement hierarchy prevailed (Bauer 2004; Belisle 20 14; Covey 2006, 2014; Covey et al . 2008; Covey et al. 2013). Similar material culture is found at settlements dating to the Early Interme­diate and Middle Horizon, suggesting that Wari presence did not alter the production of pottery

or disrupt local and regional exchange networks. Some communities in the Cusco Basin began to produce a Wari-inspired type of pottery called Amway (Covey et al. 2013), but actual Wari items were limited to very few vessels found at a small number of local villages. Wari architecture is ab­sent outside the Lucre Basin and Huaro Valley, although it is important to note that standing ar­chitecture earlier than A.D. 1000 is not common across the region. 
Survey data suggest that the Wari colonists did not have a strong impact outside of their colony. One could argue that the population of Cusco was already living close to maize lands and that the Wari did not have to change the local settlement pattern to extract tribute from local communities. If this were the case, we would ex­pect to see changes in agricultural infrastructure to respond to new tribute demands, including the construction of terraces and irrigation canals to intensify production. Although such changes did appear in the Lucre Basin, this was not the case outside the Wari colony, where most Middle Hori­zon villages were settled close to water sources and agriculture depended on limited irrigation works (Covey et al. 2013). 
Wari Impact on a Local Community: 
The Village of Ak'awillay 

To verify the occurrence of other changes among the local population that could not be detected from surveys at the regional level, since 2006 I have been conducting excavations at the village of Ak'awillay. Ak'awillay is located on a low hill to the northwest of the city of Cusco and over­looks the surrounding Xaquixaguana Plain, also known as Plain of Anta. Ak'awillay was first oc­cupied in the Late Formative (ca. 200 B.C.-A.D. 200) and grew to become the largest village on the plain during the Middle Horizon , when it cov­ered approximately 10 ha. Evidence for social inequality during this period includes differences in mortuary treatment, material culture, and do­mestic architecture throughout the site. 
Ak'awillay is an ideal place to study the rela­tionships between Wari colonists and local com­munities in Cusco. It is the largest Early Inter­mediate period and Middle Horizon settlement that was recorded during survey (of an area of 2,000 km2) at a distance of more than five km from the Wari colonies. If the Wari state did in­fluence the local populations of the Cusco region-either through state-introduced institu­tions or through the actions of local elites-this process should be reflected in the archaeological record of Ak'awillay. 
Excavated Contexts at Ak'awillay 
With the help of a team of students, local ar­chaeologists, and local workers, I uncovered 435 m2 (654 m3) of contexts at the site dating to the Middle Horizon and earlier periods. Three houses and a community midden (Figure 2) were as­signed to the Late Formative and Early Interme­diate period based on AMS dates (Table 1), stratigraphy, and material culture. At the end of the Early Intermediate period, some villagers of Ak'awillay started to use an outdoor kitchen. Middle Horizon contexts include five houses (Houses 4-8), a public building, and a small cemetery; the kitchen also continued to be used. Most of the Wari-period contexts date to the Early Middle Horizon (A .D. 600-800; see Table 1), but stratigraphy and material culture suggest that one house (House 7) was occupied during the Late Middle Horizon (A.D. 800-1000). The charcoal samples used to obtain AMS dates were collected from the lowest levels of Wari-period houses and structures, representing the construc­tion of or the beginning of the Middle Horizon occupation of these spaces. These contexts are contemporaneous with the Wari occupation at Pikillaqta. 
Archaeological Expectations of State Impact 
The degree of change seen in the archaeological record at Ak'awillay should correspond to one of three scenarios describing the interaction with Wari colonists: (1) Wari had a strong impact on the villagers of Ak'awillay; (2) Wari impact was restricted to certain people or activities; or (3) Wari had minimal impact on Ak'awillay. 
In the first scenario , one would expect to see many changes in the archaeological record. Pat­terns of food production, preparation, consump­tion, and storage, craft production, and the orga­nization of labor would be modified in all households in order to meet new demands for tribute or corvee labor. For example, if local com-

Domestic Architecture and Household Activities 
The architecture, layout, and construction meth­ods of the houses atAk'awillay show strong con­tinuity from the pre-Wari period to the Middle Horizon. The villagers of Ak'awillay built all of their houses in the same way. They first leveled the terrain, after which they prepared a compact dirt floor and added a stone foundation (Figure 3). The villagers of Ak'awillay presumably com­pleted their houses with adobe bricks and thatched roofs. House shape changed somewhat through time, from irregular (Late Formative) to semi­circular (Early Intermediate period) to circular (Middle Horizon), but this change in shape is more likely the result of in situ evolution than the product of outs ide influence or imposed change. No rectangular house, patio group, or any other structure typical of Wari settlements (see Isbell 1997, 2009; McEwan 2005b; McEwan and Couture 2005; Nash and Williams 2009; Schreiber 1992; Williams 2001) was found at Ak'awillay. 
Houses at Ak'awillay contained similar fea­tures and material culture from the Late Formative to the Middle Horizon. This suggests that com­parable activities took place inside each house. All houses contained a hearth or ash lenses, indi­cating that cooking occurred within the house it­self. Botanical remains, animal bones, and stone tools show that the villagers of Ak'awillay planted and harvested maize (and certainly other crops), hunted deer and raised guinea pigs, and either herded camelids or obtained camelid meat from other sources. Houses from different time periods contained storage features such as pits and bins, further suggesting that people stored goods inside their house. Other activities that occurred in the Late Formative and continued into the Middle Horizon included spinning and weaving, con­suming coca and hallucinogenic drugs, playing music, performing rituals involving figurines, and burying human and non-human offerings below house floors. Some of the ritual activities would have been conducted in the houses, while others probably took place in the public building.

One notable change is the appearance of a high-status house during the Middle Horizon. This house contained prestige items and was built with finer materials than other contemporaneous houses at the site. Although the construction of high-status residences may have occurred exclu­sively during the Wari period at Ak'awillay, a larger sample of pre-Middle Horizon houses needs to be excavated to exclude the existence of similar high-status houses prior to this time. 
Food Consumption 
Continuity in domestic spaces and activities at Ak'awillay was accompanied by change in a few key areas. The first change, evidenced by the presence of new serving vessels, was related to food consumption and began before the Middle Horizon. In the Late Formative, the villagers of Ak' awillay consumed most of their food in large open bowls and plates (Table 2; Figure 4, upper row). The considerable size of these bowls and plates (the mean diameter is 24.7 cm) suggests that several individuals could have eaten from the same vessel. Their flaring form is incompati­ble with liquid foods, indicating that meals eaten in these vessels probably took the form of thick stews, casseroles, or roasted items. Earlier Late Formative contexts in the Cusco region contained these large family-sized bowls and plates, with no small bowls (Davis 2011). 
Starting at the end of the Late Formative and beginning of the Early Intermediate period, the villagers of Ak'awillay started to consume some of their food and beverages in small individual­sized bowls and cups (Figure 4, lower row). The small size of these vessels (the mean diameter is between 10.7 and 12.7 cm) suggests that only one person at a time could have eaten or drunk from these bowls. In addition, their restricted opening and their straight or incurving walls in­dicate that they would have been used to con­sume liquid forms of food-such as soups-and beverages. During the Early Middle Horizon, more than half of the bowls from Ak'awillay were small individual-sized vessels. The increas­ing popularity of these small bowls through time suggests an important change in local consump­tion practices. 
Procurement of Pottery 
The change in consumption practices at Ak'aw­illay was accompanied by change in the procure­ment of pottery. This change also began before the Middle Horizon. In the Late Formative, the pottery used by the people of Ak'awillay was most likely produced at or around the site (see Table 2). This pottery, called Derived Chanapata, included thick vessels used for a variety of pur­poses. When decorated, these vessels were gen­erally pattern-burnished or incised.

Starting at around A.D. 200, the people of Ak'awillay began to produce new types of pots. Along with Derived Chanapata, local Ak' awillay pottery was used for all household needs. Simple motifs were painted in black or red on a natural or cream background (Figure 5). Derived Chana­pata and Ak'awillay pottery continued to be pro­duced and used in subsequent periods at the site, mostly as domestic wares alongside the fancier imported polychrome styles. 
Starting in the second half of the Early Inter­mediate period (ca. A.D. 400-600) the villagers of Ak'awillay procured new vessels from outside the Xaquixaguana Plain (see Table 2). This pot­tery was finer than before and decorated with painted motifs . Qotakalli was the most common imported pottery at Ak'awillay, followed by Muyu Urqu and Waru. The latter is poorly known, but data from Instrumental Neutron Activation Analysis (INAA) and broad regional distribution patterns generated by systematic surveys indicate that Qotakalli and Muyu Urqu vessels were pro­duced from Cusco Basin clays (Bauer 1999:73­75; Covey 2006:63-68; Covey et al. 2013; Glowacki 2005b:112; Montoya et al. 2003, 2009). These three imported ceramic styles­Qotakalli, Muyu Urqu, and Waru-were present in all Early Intermediate period and Middle Hori­zon contexts at Ak'awillay. Most of these im­
ported vessels were small individual bowls and cups that were used to consume food and bever­ages. The production and distribution of these new pottery styles were not interrupted by Wari presence; indeed, in the Early Middle Horizon, imported vessels became even more common at Ak'awillay, reaching 15 to 18 percent of the pot­tery assemblage. 
In addition to local and imported polychrome wares, the villagers of Ak'awillay started to obtain Wari and Wari-influenced pottery in the Early Middle Horizon. Araway is a Wari-influenced pottery style whose production was restricted to the Middle Horizon. It was produced from Cusco Basin clays (Covey et al . 20 13; Glowacki 2005b: 112; Montoya et al. 2003: 181, 2009), sug­gesting that some local elites interacting with Wari colonists started to produce and distribute their own Wari-influenced pottery during the Mid­dle Horizon. Araway pottery did not displace other local styles. Qotakalli, Muyu Urqu, and Warn ceramics continued to be produced and used during the Middle Horizon. 
At Ak'awillay, Araway and Wari pottery ap­peared in very small numbers (less than 1 percent of the pottery assemblage), along with abundant local and Cusco Basin material culture. Araway and Wari vessels were bowls and cups, suggesting that they were used exclusively for eating and

drinking. Araway pottery was present in houses and in the public building, while Wari pottery was rare and restricted to the high-status house (one fragment, representing .6 percent of the dec­orated assemblage) and to the public building (one fragment, constituting .5 percent of the dec­orated assemblage). In these two contexts the overwhelming majority of decorated pottery con­sisted of local styles and imported vessels from the Cusco Basin. 
Stone Tools and Raw Material 
Similarly to pottery, the villagers of Ak'awillay procured stone from different sources over time. During the Late Formative, the villagers of Ak' awillay used a variety of materials to produce chipped and ground stone tools (Table 3). Most of these materials-with the exception of obsidian-are available around Ak'awillay or nearby in the Xaquixaguana Plain (Carlotto et al. 1996; Mendivil and Davila 1994). Most stone tools were chipped, and the presence of cores flakes, and debitage in houses indicates that tools except for those made of obsidian, were produce< and repaired in the house itself. 
During the Early Intermediate period, the vii lagers of Ak'awillay started to use a new type o stone: laminated andesite/slate (Figure 6). Carefu examination indicates that both laminated an desite and slate were used at the site. Howeve1 because it can be difficult for non-geologists t< distinguish these two types of stone, they an lumped together here. Laminated andesite/slat1 clearly became the most important type of stom during the Middle Horizon, when an overwhelm ing majority (more than 80 percent) of stone item were made from this material. Because laminate< andesite/slate has to be ground instead of chipped the types of stone tools produced changed durin; the Early Intermediate period and the Middl1 Horizon; most tools were knives and choppini tools that were likely used for a variety of do

There is no known obsidian source in Cusco. Thus, all obsidian had to be procured through long-distance exchange. Before the Middle Hori­zon, obsidian at Ak'awillay came from two sources: Alea and Chivay (Table 4) , both in the Department of Arequipa. During the Middle Hori­zon, most obsidian (93 percent) continued to come from the Alea and Chivay sources but some (5 percent) came from Quispisisa in the Depart­ment of Ayacucho. Quispisisa obsidian was re­covered at Wari sites, including the capital at Wari (Burger and Asaro 1979:308), Cerro Baul and Cerro Mejia in Moquegua (Burger et al . 2000:334; Williams et al. 2012), and Pikillaqta in Cusco (Burger and Asaro 1979:298). Although Quispisisa obsidian has been documented in many regions of Peru since the Preceramic, during the Middle Horizon it is generally associated with Wari expansion or exchange with Wari caravans (e.g., Burger et al. 2000) . It is important to note that the mechanisms through which the Wari ob­tained this obsidian remain unknown, and re­search to verify the presence of Wari occupation at the source is lacking. At Ak'awillay, Quispisisa obsidian is present in Early Middle Horizon houses, outdoor patios, and the public building. The appearance of obsidian at the site coincided with the arrival of Wari colonists in the Huaro Valley and Lucre Basin. 
The Community of Ak'awillay and the 
Cosco Region through Time 

Changes Initiated before the Middle Horizan at Ak'awillay 
Most of the changes detected in the archaeological record atAk'awillay occurred during the few cen­turies preceding the arrival of Wari colonists and then continued into the Middle Horizon. The small individual bowls and cups, so different from the large open bowls and plates of the Late For­mative, were ubiquitous atAk'awillay during the Wari period. The presence of these small serving vessels suggests two likely changes in the house­hold economy: (1) food was prepared and served differently, allowing for more liquid meals, and 
(2) beverages like chicha (maize beer) became 
more important during the Early Intermediate pe­riod and the Middle Horizon. Drinking chicha could have become central to the development and maintenance of key relationships between different families as some communities in the Cusco region were becoming more important than others. In the prehispanic Andes, chicha was often associated with the hospitality and generos­ity of leaders who provided the beverage to their followers as a symbol of prestige and authority and, in some cases, as reciprocity for labor ex­traction (Jennings and Bowser 2009; Murra 
1980: 121-122; Rostworowski 1977 :240-244; Vaughn 2005). The social organization of chicha production remains to be fully analyzed atAk'aw­illay, but along with the construction of a public building at the beginning of the Middle Horizon, the data on small bowls and cups suggest that lo­cal leaders organized feasts during which they offered chicha and food to their followers. 
Many of these small bowls and cups belong to the Qotakalli, Muyu Urqu, and Waru imported pottery styles. Although local pottery-Derived Chanapata and Ak'awillay-continued to be used in large quantities during the Middle Horizon at Ak'awillay, the increasing popularity of Cusco Basin pottery through time suggests an intensifi­cation of relationships between select families or communities throughout the region . The ubiquity of Qotakalli, Muyu Urqu , and Waru pottery at the site further suggests that the villagers of Ak'awillay maintained a regular flow of exchange with the people of the Cusco Basin (and perhaps other neighboring areas) even after the Wari colonists arrived in the region . Everyone at Ak'awillay had access to this pottery, but it is unclear at this point whether each family was able to procure imported vessels, or whether elite families obtained them and then distributed them to their followers (during feasts, for example). 
The presence of laminated andesite/slate in Early Intermediate period and Middle Horizon contexts atAk'awillay points to the development of new procurement strategies or exchange rela­tionships that were not in place during the Late Formative. The Wari living at Huaro and Pikil ­laqta also used slate for a variety of purposes, such as floors, canals, burials, and tools (Glowacki 2002; Glowacki and McEwan 2002; McEwan 2005c). According to Glowacki 
Downloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core. YBP Library Services, on 22 Aug 2018 at 17:17:43, subject to the Cambridge Core terms of use, available at https://www.cambridge.org/core/terms. https://doi.org/10.7183/1045-6635.26.2.180 
(2002:274), the only Wari sites in the Andes as­sociated with slate were the ones in Cusco. Given that laminated andesite/slate started to be used in the Early Intermediate period at Ak'awillay and other sites in Cusco, the use of slate by the Wari colonists could be the result of local influence on the Wari, rather than Wari influence on local populations. Laminated andesite/slate knives con­tinued to be used throughout the region during the Late Intermediate period (A.D. 1000-1400). 
Changes Initiated in the Middle Horizan at Ak'awillay 
The changes that took place during the Middle Horizon at Ak' awillay seem to be linked to Wari presence in Cusco. These changes did not dra­matically alter daily life at the site, however. The impact of these changes seems to have been felt mostly by the elites living at Ak'awillay, who benefited from new economic opportunities by gaining access to new resources. 
Like the other pottery styles produced outside the Xaquixaguana Plain, the presence of Araway pottery in Middle Horizon contexts at Ak' awillay suggests sustained exchange with people living in the Cusco Basin. Although Wari pottery is pre­sent at the site, the small amount indicates that the villagers of Ak'awillay did not obtain it on a regular basis; its presence in restricted contexts further reveals that only a few individuals pro­cured Wari pottery. Based on the finer architecture of these restricted contexts and the more elaborate burials associated with them, it is likely that those obtaining Wari pottery were individuals of higher social or economic status. 
The presence of Cusco pottery at Wari sites in the region demonstrates that exchange was not unidirectional; Wari colonists also obtained local products. For example, Qotakalli, Waru, and Ar­away vessels were found at Pikillaqta and Huaro (Glowacki 1996:199-207, 212-216, 248-250, 2002:279, 2005b: 106-107) and in Wari burials at the cemetery ofBatan Urqu (Bauer 1999:73; Za­pata 1997). At Pikillaqta, Wari colonists consumed more local pottery ( 10 percent of the assemblage at Pikillaqta; Glowacki 2005b: 105-107) than local elites consumed Wari pottery at Ak'awillay (< 1 percent of the assemblage at Ak'awillay). The presence of Cusco Basin pottery at Wari sites and the paucity of pottery styles produced outside the Cusco Basin (e.g., Ccoipa from Paruro to the south of Cusco) further suggest that the Wari colonists acquired local items primarily through Cusco Basin elites, rather than from other groups in the region. Likewise, the scarcity of Muyu Urqu pot­tery at Pikillaqta (Glowacki 2005b: 108) shows that Wari exchange networks did not entirely con­nect with or replace local ones. 
Apart from Wari pottery, the presence of Quispisisa obsidian at Ak' awillay is further evi­dence for exchange with Wari colonists or down­the-line trade with people in the Cusco Basin. In­terestingly, the villagers of Ak'awillay also continued to obtain Chivay obsidian during the Middle Horizon. Before my excavations, most scholars (e.g., Burger et al. 2000) thought that there was no Chivay obsidian-the exploitation of which is believed to have been controlled by groups related to Tiwanaku-in regions where Wari sites were present. A notable exception is the Wari site of Cerro Baul, which is much closer to Chivay than to Quispisisa. The implicit as­sumption was that any interaction between Cusco and Titicaca Basin groups was interrupted after Wari arrival in Cusco. The mechanisms through which the people of Cusco procured Chivay ob­sidian have yet to be understood, but its presence in Middle Horizon contexts at Ak' awillay suggests that the Wari did not disrupt the preexisting ob­sidian exchange networks in the region. Quispisisa was the main type of obsidian found at Pikillaqta (Burger et al. 2000), but contemporary local vil­lages like Ak'awillay do not follow this pattern. 
Discussion 
Evidence from Ak'awillay shows limited Wari impact on the largest community in the Xaquix­aguana Plain. Items of daily life remained virtu­ally unchanged at the site even after the arrival of the Wari in the region. Some changes did occur at Ak' awillay, but most of these took place before Wari colonists arrived in the region. A few changes did occur during the Middle Horizon at the site. Nevertheless, considering (1) the conti­nuity in regional settlement patterns, (2) the sta­bility of regional exchange networks during the Middle Horizon, and (3) the persistence through time of many local traditions at Ak'awillay, I ar­gue that the changes that we see at Ak'awillay 
Downloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core. YBP Library Services, on 22 Aug 2018 at 17:17:43, subject to the Cambridge Core terms of use, available at https://www.cambridge.org/core/terms. https://doi.org/10.7183/1045-6635.26.2.180 
are better explained by increased participation in regional and interregional exchange than by the loss of local autonomy and the incorporation of Ak'awillay and the Xaquixaguana Plain into the Wari state . The Wari items that were introduced at Ak'awillay (pots and obsidian) are best ex­plained by the development of trade and other symmetrical relationships between local elites and Wari colonists. 
One might argue that the scarcity ofWari items at Ak' awillay suggests that they were difficult to obtain . A competing polity based in the Cusco Basin might have restricted access to Wari goods for the people living in the Xaquixaguana Plain. The strong presence of Cusco Basin pottery in the Xaquixaguana Plain, however, suggests a lively economic interaction between the two ar­eas. It is unlikely that people living in the Cusco Basin traded many items with the people at Ak'awillay but were unwilling to trade Wari goods very often. Even if a competing polity in the Cusco Basin restricted their access to Wari items, the people living at Ak' awillay could have emulated Wari pottery locally, just as they imi­tated other pottery styles (Qotakalli and Muyu Urqu). The fact that there are no such local copies of Wari pottery and that Amway is uncommon indicates that the villagers of Ak'awillay were simply not very interested in Wari and Wari-in­fluenced ceramics. Surface collections across the Xaquixaguana Plain also recovered very little Wari pottery (only two sites out of 71 Middle Horizon settlements contained a Wari sherd), showing that this paucity characterized the region as a whole throughout the Middle Horizon. 
One might also argue that the lack of change in daily life at Ak' awillay could be explained by the fact that its inhabitants did not resist the de­mands of Wari colonists. Even if the people of the Cusco region were compliant, we would still expect a few changes. First, if Wari colonists de­manded maize as a tribute-or a labor tribute di­rected toward the cultivation of maize fields ­we would expect an intensification of agricultural activity (e.g., the construction of canals and ter­races). Yet all agricultural terraces of the Xaquix­aguana Plain date to the Inka period. Second, if people living atAk'awillay had to reallocate their daily tasks to fulfill tribute demands and corvee labor, we would expect to see changes in cooking technologies. Instead, there is strong continuity in the tools and spaces related to food processing, preparation, and storage atAk'awillay, including grinding stones, cooking and storage vessels, and storage features. Third, we would also expect to see large storage fac ilities and abundant storage jars for surpluses at the Wari colony. These are absent; the small conjoined rooms at Pikillaqta originally thought to be storerooms (Harth-Terre 
1959; Sanders 1973) have been reinterpreted as ritual spaces (McEwan 2005a) . Large storage jars were absent from these rooms, and excavations uncovered domestic trash and hearths instead (McEwan 2005c:56-57). 
For the people of Ak'awillay, the transition from the Early Intermediate period to the Middle Horizon was not a time of drastic change but one marked by continuity. The Wari disrupted the po­litical, economic, and religious life of a small area adjacent to their colony in the Lucre Basin and Huaro Valley, but, outside of this area, the Wari colonists do not seem to have controlled the resources or the population of Cusco. There is no evidence that Wari presence was coercive. Local communities such as Ak' awillay selectively incorporated Wari items into their domestic and ceremonial activities, alongside other non-local goods. This exchange may have included perish­able goods not preserved in the archaeological record (e.g., coca, feathers, food), or it may have been accompanied by other kinds of relationships (feasting, intermarriage, etc.). For example, local groups may have sporadically participated in Wari rituals and building projects in exchange for food and drink. Wari colonists may have accessed this labor by establishing alliances with local elites who retained power within their respective poli­ties. In exchange for labor, local elites may have gained access to exotic goods that they would have used to enhance their prestige at home. 
The increasing importance of chicha drinking at Ak'awillay during the Middle Horizon­indicated by the proliferation of small individual bowls-and the construction of a public building suggest that local elites organized large rituals during which guests were offered beverages and food. For local leaders, these venues were an op­portunity to display their generosity to their fol­lowers; these ceremonies were also a theater for the display of exotic items procured through ex-

change networks. In this sense, Wari state expan­sion in the Cusco region may have contributed to local competition and to the development of more complex sociopolitical hierarchies. Wari colonization intensified competition for prestige goods among local populations. For local leaders, Wari presence was a way to gain, rather than lose, opportunities. The aggrandizing behavior of local leaders at communities like Ak'awillay could have promoted new ways to express status and encouraged Wari-style labor tribute extrac­tions that might not have existed previously. 
Conclusions 
Data from excavations in the village of Ak'aw­illay and the results of survey in the Cusco region show limited Wari impact outside of the Wari colony. Strong continuity from the previous pe­riods suggests that Wari colonists did not establish asymmetrical relationships with all the commu­nities of the Cusco area. In addition, most changes at Ak'awillay were not related to Wari presence but to local dynamics (i.e., the emergence of so­cial inequality and regional polities) that were already in place by the Early Intermediate period. The construction of Pikillaqta suggests that the Wari may have had bigger aspirations for Cusco (i.e., transforming the colony into a province), but current data from Pikillaqta and elsewhere in the region indicate that these aspirations were not materialized (Covey 2006:77-78). As observed in other regions of the world (e.g., Braswell 2003a; Smith I 998; Stein 2002a), Middle Horizon Cusco represents a case where interaction with state colonists or state representatives did not lead to incorporation into that state. 
The Middle Horizon in Cusco was a time of increasing interaction. Earlier exchange networks were maintained and new exchange relationships were created. The occupants of Ak'awillay ob­tained items from a variety of sources, including people living in the Cusco Basin, the Wari colonists, other groups in the Cusco region, and perhaps people connected to the Titicaca Basin. The presence of Wari colonists provided the elites of Ak'awillay with new opportunities. Their re­sponse to Wari intrusion was to incorporate and display a select number of items of Wari material culture, although these items did not replace pres­tige markers that had been in use before Wari arrival. 
The available evidence does not support the in­terpretation that the Wari state controlled all of the southern highlands and the coast of Peru during the Middle Horizon. The Wari probably controlled a few regions close to their heartland (and perhaps more distant strategic areas), established symmet­rical exchange relationships with regions and poli­ties farther away, and ignored areas in which Wari rulers had no interest, local resistance was too strong, or locals did not seek out a relationship. In Cusco, colonization did not result in the domination or incorporation of local populations. 
This interpretation of Wari impact mirrors what we know about other early states in the An­des and elsewhere, and in this sense the Wari state may have been more similar to Tiwanaku, Teotihuacan, and Uruk than to the later Inka em­pire. Early states are different from later ones in terms of complexity, organization, extent, and re­sources. In Mesoamerica, Teotihuacan is a good example of how the distribution of material cul­ture was once interpreted as evidence for conquest and colonialism. Work at Teotihuacan and in the surrounding Basin of Mexico in the 1960s and 1970s led to what Pendergast (2003:235) calls "Teotihuacanomania:" most archaeologists saw Teotihuacan as the source of the political and cul­tural development of other Mesoamerican poli­ties. More recent research has reevaluated these Teotihuacan-centric models (see Braswell 2003b and Marcus 2003 for summaries for the Maya area) and showed that these reconstructions have greatly exaggerated the role of Teotihuacan in lo­cal developments during the Classic period. The prestige of Teotihuacan was certainly far-flung, but its political control was probably limited to regions surrounding the capital city in Central Mexico. For example, recent data do not support the presence of a Teotihuacan enclave at the Maya site of Kaminaljuyti. Instead, the elites of Kami­naljuyti seem to have displayed Teotihuacan goods and appropriated prestigious Central Mex ­ican symbols to reinforce their position and in­crease their prestige locally (Braswell 2003a: 139). 
Like other cases of early state expansion, the Cusco region is one instance where colonists co­existed with local populations without dominating them. Pikillaqta and Huaro, and possibly other

Wari sites outside the Wari heartland, look more 
like enclaves or colonies that facilitated the ex­
traction of resources and the development of key 
relationships than like provincial administrative 
centers that controlled resources and dominated 
populations. The case of Ak'awillay shows the 
importance of using multiple lines of evidence 
in assessing the presence, nature , and impact of 
an expansionary state. Expansion is not always 
related to political control, and our models must 
reflect the complexity of relationships that were 
developed between colonists and local commu­
nities. 
The case of Ak'awillay also emphasizes that although the investigation of state capitals and state installations outside the heartland is funda­mental for understanding state expansion and con­solidation strategies, the complementary study of the local communities that came into contact with the expanding state is equally important. A failure to do so rnisestimates state impact in some regions, ignores local agency, and disregards important lo­cal processes . When taken together, the "top­down" and "bottom-up" approaches provide a rich understanding of the needs, motivation, and ben­efits of the expansionary state, as well as the re­sponses of the local communities to these intrud­ing states and their impact on everyday life. Only then can we fully understand state expansion.
