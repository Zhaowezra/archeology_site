WITHIN-GROUP CULTURAL VARIATION

To study the Classic Maya is to at once recognize the shared material representations and practices that give coherence to this cultural category as a unit of analysis, as well as to critically examine the diversity and idiosyncrasy of specific cultural traits within prehispanic Maya society. Maya hieroglyphic writing, in particular the tradition of inscribing texts and images on carved stone monuments, offers evidence for widespread and mutually intelligible cultural practices that were, at the same time, neither unchanging nor uniform in their semantic content. As conduits of linguistic and cultural information. Maya hieroglyphic monuments offer detailed records of Classic Maya dynastic history that include the names, dates, and specific rituals performed by elite individuals. In this article, we analyze the distribution and diversity of these inscriptions to examine ritual variation and the divergence of dynastic traditions in Classic Maya society. Diversity indices and methods adapted from population genetics and ecology are applied to quantify the degree of ritual differentiation 
and evaluate how these measures vary over time and are partitioned within and between elite populations. Results of this research refine our understanding about the variation of Classic Maya ritual traditions and make substantive contributions to examininf? the population structure of cultural diversity within past complex societies.

a communication system, propagated by a specific population, consisting of arbitrary sets of traits, attributes, and collective rules relating to the words, grammar, and syntax of a particular lin­guistic tradition (Jordan 2015:35-36). Analo­gously, archaeologists are adept at uncovering past communities engaged in shared material cul­ture practices based on similar criteria (Bowser and Patton 2008; Canuto and Yaeger 2000; Joyce and Hendon 2000; Knappett 2011; Mills et al. 2015; Wenger 1998; Wilk and Ashmore 1988). The key challenge, however, is to identify the degree to which traits within a single cultural or linguistic tradition fit an overall pattern, or whether different sets of traits follow different evolutionary histories (Gray et al. 2010; Jordan 2015:42; O'Brien et al. 2010). In short, how tightly bundled are specific cultural traits within a community? In this article, we investigate the diversity and population structure of terms refer­ring to Classic Maya elite rituals to assess the coalescence and divergence of these dynastic tra­ditions across multiple temporal, spatial, and so­cial scales of analysis. 
This study analyzes the diversity and popula­tion structure of Classic Maya ritual inscriptions to better understand the shared practices and dif­ferences among elite ceremonial traditions. In particular, we quantify the frequency and distri­bution of ritual terms recorded on hieroglyphic monuments to systematically analyze lexeme di­versity and determine how these inscribed prac­tices were structured and changed throughout the Classic period (ca. A.D. 250-950). As statements of authority and dynastic duty, rituals inscribed on stone monuments document conspicuous pat­terns of past performances that were important opportunities for community integration, social cohesion, and identity formation as well as the negotiation of asymmetric power relations (Bell 1992; Inomata 2006a; Turner 1957, 1969). Vari­ation and divergence of these documented rituals provide clues to evaluate how different commu­nities chose to celebrate the political, military, and religious power of their divine rulers as well as measure the degree to which elite cultural tra­ditions were shared across Classic Maya polities. We present novel methods for quantifying ritual diversity using a set of statistical techniques orig­inally designed to measure population differenti­ation in genetic data. Contributing to a growing interest in understanding the population structure of human cultural variation, this study offers crit­ical historical data and interdisciplinary perspec­tives for investigating past cultural variation at multiple social scales. 
Royal Rituals Writ Large 
The ability to create and transform social structure through ritual is well established in the anthro­pological literature (Bell 1992; Rappaport 1999; Turner 1969). Recent archaeological studies sim­ilarly emphasize the integrative and communal aspects of Maya public rites, highlighting how these social practices are embedded in power re­lations (Inomata 2006a; Lucero 2003). Rituals are not timeless nor do they simply restore social equilibrium, but are active and ongoing social processes that unite and divide across multiple social categories. The balance between such cen­trifugal and centripetal forces reflects comparable processes in Classic Maya society in which ritual and ceremony played a central role (Houston and Inomata 2009; Inomata 2006a). Kyriakidis (2007:294-296) makes the important point that rituals not only create connections between social groups, but simultaneously draw boundaries within them, thereby creating "social groups within social groups." Thus, ritual is not only culturally specific, but can be distinguished at different levels of society by examining how strategic actions promote diverse meanings within the group. Such multivocality is inherent in the theatrics of Classic Maya performance; however, archaeological studies of performance tend to concentrate on the processes and contexts in which meanings were created and contested in the past (Inomata 2006a:807, 832). For example, variation in mortuary rituals at Teotihuacan demonstrates how gender roles and ideology were constructed differently across diverse sectors of this ancient Mesoamerican metropolis (Clayton 2011). Similar attention is drawn to the diversity of social life in Classic Maya society based on representational and household evidence that iso­lates the everyday experiences of commoners, nobles, and royals (Robin 2004). Distinctions along this social axis, however, do not lend them­selves to making meaningful observations about

variation within these categories, while inconsis­tent units of analysis may hamper comparisons between groups. The result of such a priori cate­gorization may lead to the unintended conse­quence of lumping together potentially significant differences between Maya royal courts, for ex­ample. To overcome this potential bias, this study analyzes a sample of royal rituals along different axes of variation to evaluate the degree of cultural diversity within the elite stratum of Classic Maya society. 
Recent research on Classic Maya ritual em­phasizes the political and social significance of royal ceremonies, independent of materialist or idealist agendas of individual researchers (Lucero 2003; Stuart 2005). The shared idea is that royal rituals derived from a "vocabulary of more com­mon activities" that represented the moral oblig­ation of the ruler to his community (Houston and Inomata 2009:62). Lucero's (2003) model for the emergence of Maya rulership is based on the idea that dynastic rites were simply enlarged versions of domestic rituals, which allowed aspiring rulers to extract and appropriate surplus production for political means. Focusing on the scale of dedica­tion, termination, and ancestor veneration rituals across a range of social contexts at different sized Maya centers, Lucero (2003:543) concludes that "commoners, elites, and royals conducted the 'same' rites, albeit at an increasingly grand and public scale, over time." The structural and func­tional similarity Lucero describes, however, belies potential differences in the content, form, and meaning of royal rituals themselves. Lecount (2003:548) aptly points out that these dynastic rites were not just "bigger, fancier, and more pub­lic versions of traditional rites but ... must have been qualitatively different in form and content from those that every Maya could perform." We therefore need to consider not only a wider range of ritual practices, but also the ways that leaders set themselves apart from rival competitors while maintaining distinct positions of power within Classic Maya society. 
Evidence from the hieroglyphic record may offer the best source for identifying variation among large samples of elite rituals. It is widely acknowledged that the principal genre of Classic Maya monumental inscriptions is dedication, which often frames political discourse (Stuart 
1995:99-102, 1998). Within these political nar­ratives, a number of different themes can be dis­cerned, which in turn involve a variety of events (Biro 2011:10-11; Garcfa Campillo 1995). Em­phasizing the underlying ideology of Maya king­ship, Stuart (2005) uses specific texts and images to discern the basic religious concepts that ori­ented the king and his dynastic duties. In partic­ular, he proposes three general categories of Clas­sic Maya royal ritual: bloodletting, dancing, and burning/censing, which may overlap consider­ably, but "seem to cover the majority of ceremo­nial categories we find recorded in the inscrip­tions" (Stuart 2005:273). Despite an effort to present a comprehensive overview of Classic Maya dynastic ritual, this classification scheme obscures potentially meaningful variation in the content, context, and diverse forms of royal prac­tice. Dancing, for example, was performed in a variety of cosmological and political contexts as observed on hieroglyphic monuments at Dos Pilas and Yaxchilan (Looper 2009: 1 8-43). In contrast, a recent study of epigraphic terms associated with Maya bloodletting finds equivocal evidence for the ubiquity of this particular royal ritual (Munson et al. 2014). Acts of burning, on the other hand, are so widely documented across ceremonial con­texts (Morehart et al. 2005) that this general cat­egory may prove useless for differentiating dis­tinctive ritual acts. Moreover, this tripartite schema overlooks how other well-documented royal rituals, such as impersonation, conjuring, and scattering rites, intersect with these attested categories. 
According to a practice-based approach, "ritual should be analyzed and understood in its real context. .. not as some a priori category of action" (Bell 1997:81). Rather than impose external cat­egories of ritual practice, we identify and classify elite rituals based upon their verbal roots ex­pressed in Classic Mayan as recorded in the hi­eroglyphic inscriptions. We interpret these lex­emes or phrases as records of ceremonial events that were performed in historical time by human actors embodying multi-agentive social roles. In short, these ritual terms are cultural traits that can be used to study the evolutionary history of Clas­sic Maya dynastic traditions. We can derive in­ferences about these cultural traditions based on the distribution and diversity of these ritual terms,

just as an archaeologist would draw conclusions about past human behavior from a sparse and of­ten incomplete material record. Unpacking this definition, however, requires some basic assump­tions and discussion of the semantic content and historical contexts of Classic Maya writing. Ob­viously, there may be a strong difference between the royal acts recorded in Maya art and writing and a broader set that likely existed (Houston and Inomata 2009:61), but this does not necessarily imply that recorded rituals were limited in number or formulaic in expression. 
The Content and Contexts of 
Classic Maya Writing 

Long recognized as a defining attribute of the Classic period (Willey and Phillips 1958: 182­183), Maya hieroglyphic writing is considered one of the most visually striking and fully devel­oped writing systems in prehispanic America. As most commonly described, writing is a method of communication that conveys meaning and sound through the structured use of conventional visual symbols (Coulmas 2003: 15-18). The 
choice to record different lexemes referring to 
the same type of dynastic accession ritual thus encodes potentially meaningful information about the ways that Classic Maya rulers differentiated themselves from rivals. In addition, the inscription of multiple and diverse elite rites provides clues to evaluate how different communities chose to celebrate their rulers and define themselves in relation to others. 
The Classic Maya script was a mixed logo­syllabic system comprised of graphemes denoting full word (logograph), numeric, and syllabic val­ues. Some scholars suggest the usage of a single prestige language in Classic Maya writing (Hous­ton, et al. 2000), but recent linguistic studies iden­tify variability in the language groups recorded indicating that multiple dialects or languages may be represented in the hieroglyphic texts (Grone­meyer 2014; Lacadena Garcia-Gallo 2010; Law 2014; Wichmann 2004). Although it is linguisti­cally complex, Maya hieroglyphic writing repre­sents a set of mutually intelligible texts that de­veloped over the course of 1800 years, beginning as early as the third century B.C. (Satumo et al. 2006) and continuing until the Spanish suppressed 
it during the sixteenth century. The bulk of extant monumental texts, however, are dated to the Clas­sic period (ca. 250-950), and these inscriptions offer the most legible and abundant texts for con­ducting detailed studies of lexeme variation. In addition, advances in decipherment over the last 30 years have significantly expanded our under­standing of the grammar, orthographic conven­tions, and semantic content of Maya writing. Ac­cess to this information in digitized formats, through cataloging and coding efforts by the Maya Hieroglyphic Database Project, create unique opportunities to conduct systematic em­pirical studies of the hieroglyphic record. 
Like other works of art in Classic Maya soci­ety, the production of hieroglyphic texts was an elite craft that required specialized training and knowledge concerning mythology, astronomy, mathematics, sacred rituals, and history (lnomata 2001, 2007). Restricted to elite and royal contexts, hieroglyphic texts can be found on a variety of 
carved or painted architectural features including stelae, lintels, altars, wall panels, and murals, as well as on decorated polychrome vessels and other ornaments made of jade, wood, bone, or 
shell. A limited number of fan-fold books wdtten 
in Maya hieroglyphs survive from the Late Post­classic and Early Colonial periods (ca. A.D. 1200-1600), although this scribal tradition was also likely widespread during the Classic period (Reents-Budet 1994; Rossi et al. 2015; Saturno et al. 2015). Demonstrating the esoteric knowl­edge held by Maya scribes, inscriptions from the codices primarily document astronomical cycles and religious content (Bricker and Bricker 2011; Vail 2000). Personal objects such as jade pendants and ear spools were often engraved with texts to be read by the owners of the objects but not seen by others (Houston and Taube 1987; Joyce 2003; Mathews 1979). Inscriptions found on some painted ceramics may document ancient speeches (Law et al. 2013) in addition to recording com­mon expressions that identify the drinking vessel, its contents, and the personal name and titles of the owner. In contrast, monumental inscriptions were usually less intimate, portraying the public persona of Maya rulers by recounting their dy­nastic history and marking important political and historical events. Regardless of the medium they worked in, scribal artists achieved high social

status as suggested by their official courtly titles (Jackson and Stuart 2001; Satumo et al. 2015) and through the power and prestige associated with the objects they produced (lnomata 2001). However, elites did not engage in these crafts only for political or personal gain; their partici­pation in arduous, sometimes unpleasant or even costly tasks points to their commitment to un­derlying cultural values associated with their artis­tic practice (Bliege Bird and Smith 2005; Inomata 2007). 
Beyond its technical components and signifi­cance as a status marker, writing is fundamentally a method of communication that should be ex­amined within its specific social and political contexts. Here we are interested in how Maya hieroglyphic signs may have been interpreted, transmitted, and acted upon in past sender-re­ceiver dynamics (Godfrey-Smith 2014; Skyrms 2010). Such "literacy practices" are essential to understanding the ways in which writing, reading, and their related acoustic and bodily acts are em­bedded within social and political power struc­tures in society (Street 1984). Focusing on the inscriptions allows us to emphasize the social significance of royal rituals regardless of whether they actually happened.1 Although archaeologists can rarely identify the intended recipients of an­cient writing, the location, sculptural presentation, calendrical information, and semantic content of Classic Maya monuments allow us to reconstruct potential social interactions centered on past lit­eracy practices. 
Formalized reading and writing were indepen­dent skills, with writing likely restricted to the noble class in Classic Maya society (Houston 1994:28-29). Although levels of literacy probably varied between communities and even among in­dividual scribes, the visual cues and performance­related aspects of monumental texts may have facilitated wider access to the information in­scribed in stone. Hieroglyphic inscriptions found on carved stone monuments were commonly in­tegrated with scenes depicting royal individuals engaged in the documented ritual action. The combination of image and text displayed in the public spaces where these ceremonies took place provides another vehicle for people to remember and re-experience those events (Grube 1992; O'Neil 2012). But the texts could also stand alone, fully capable of communicating information not otherwise represented (Martin 2006). Classic Maya writing also displays attributes of recitation literacy (Brown 1991). A Maya term for ruler, ajaw, which may literally translate as "he who shouts" (Houston and Stuart 1996:295), bolsters the idea that Maya kings were oratorical perform­ers capable of communicating to wide audiences. Inomata (2006a, 2006b; Inomata and Coben 2006a, 2006b) develops this performance-based approach for understanding the ways that public ceremonies were theatrical and politically charged occasions-not only for Maya rulers to assert their authority and divine power, but also for community participants to engage in the creation of social identities and negotiation of political struggles that characterize Classic Maya society. Central to these studies of past performance is the investigation of plazas and open spaces where community members gathered and ceremonial events took place (Inomata 2006a, 2014). Nonetheless, it is sometimes difficult to identify and distinguish different types of public ritual through archaeology alone. Tokovinine (2006:831) rightly points out that the "most im­portant question that remains unanswered is what kinds of [public] theatrical performances ... were essential to the maintenance of the imagined com­munities of Classic Maya polities." By examining lexical differences in the rituals inscribed on hi­eroglyphic monuments, we may inch closer to­ward understanding the intersubjective ways that Classic Maya communities chose to commemo­rate their political leaders and signal their shared social identity. 
Materials and Methods 
Ritual Inscription Dataset 
Ritual inscriptions analyzed in the current study were collected and coded from monumental texts recorded in the Maya Hieroglyphic Database (MHD). The MHD is a unique catalog of hiero­glyphic texts that encodes comprehensive spatial, temporal, and linguistic information about Classic Maya script and language (Looper and Macri 1991 -2015). Each record in the database repre­sents a spatially discrete unit of text, called a glyph block, which contains variable numbers of

graphemes that in combination commonly denote a word or phrase. At the time of data collection, there were 73,359 records in the MHD represent­ing thousands of carved, modeled, and painted hieroglyphic texts. Attributes of the glyph blocks are coded for detailed information about each textual source, including its location (site, region, monument name, coordinate, associated struc­ture), dates of monument dedication, and most documented ritual events, as well as linguistic and semantic content including glosses in Classic Mayan and English. 
In this study, we identified and coded every inscribed ritual in the MHD based upon its verbal root expressed in Classic Mayan. For the purpose of this study, we define elite rituals as intentional acts in which the main protagonist is a human actor rather than a deity or other supernatural. This includes not only kings (k'uhul ajaw), but also elite women and other titled individuals such as sajals, ajk'uhuns, and other human agents whose exact social standing is uncertain. By ex­tension, we exclude purely calendrical obser­vances such as temporal "completion" (tzutz) or "diminishing" (lam) events as well as k'altun "stone setting" and chumtun "stone seating" rit­uals, which in our view are not always clearly associated with physical acts performed by human agents. We note that some events, such as wars and the making of monuments, doubtlessly in­volved multiple actors; however, in many of these cases, the text either explicitly or implicitly at­tributes these events to the agency of a single person, usually a ruler. Since some rituals are recorded using constructions that delete or sup­press the identity of the actor, we assume that all persons whose acts are recorded on monuments belong to the upper tiers of Maya society. Al­though this elides the ritual actions of rulers with non-royal elites, this grouping results in a large dataset that facilitates the analysis of overall elite ritual behavior. 
In total, 81 different rituals are represented across I 02 epigraphic expressions. According to a practice-based definition of ritual, we minimally assigned rituals to categories based on epigraphic readings that converge on shared meanings (Sup­plemental Table 1). Seventy-five percent of all ritual inscriptions are accounted for by the top 12 categories, indicating that the majority of rit­uals were rare occurrences (Figure 1). Elite rituals previously discussed as essential to Maya king­ship are, not surprisingly, high frequency events in our dataset. Accession rituals are by far the most common rite (n = 281) and are represented in the inscriptions by one of six Classic Mayan verb roots: ajaw, ch'am k'awil (in some contexts), chum, joy, k'al hun, and (y)okte' (See Supple­mental Table 1). We use this subset of accession rituals to investigate finer scale differences in Classic Maya dynastic traditions. In addition, to evaluate the consistency of our results and reduce any bias in comparing royal rituals associated with different sociopolitical contexts, we con­ducted the analysis using both the complete set of ritual inscriptions and this subset based on the dynastic accession rituals. 
We restricted the sample of ritual inscriptions analyzed in this study to include only events that were historically dated and recorded on hiero­glyphic monuments from known archaeological sites . Although additional ritual actions were recorded on portable objects as well as on un­provenienced monuments, these were excluded because they lack the necessary temporal and spatial controls required for the present analysis. The current dataset yields a total of 1,581 ritual inscriptions. These records come from 124 ar­chaeological sites and include event dates ranging from 8.6.0.0.0 to 10.8.10.0.0 based on the Maya Long Count calendar system (159-998 A.D.). The frequency of elite rituals through time closely tracks the production of monumental texts (Figure 2), making clear that these ceremonies were the dominant theme of hieroglyphic monuments. In addition to the significant increase in monumental inscriptions during the seventh and eighth cen­turies, it is also important to point out that the quantity of writing varies considerably across the Maya lowlands (Figure 3). It is notable that ritual inscriptions do not occur at every site where hi­eroglyphic texts have been documented, indicat­ing the need to consider alternative factors that may structure the distribution of Classic Maya royal rituals.

ular, "thorough, painstakingly detailed, and war­ranted arguments that measure cultural diversity and change at multiple scales and degrees of temporal resolution [and] that take the complexity of the human experience into account" are ex­plicitly called for by archaeologists employing this approach (Pauketat 2004:202). However, the fundamental question of how to do this remains incompletely answered. In effect, there is a gaping limitation for operationalizing the types of ar­chaeological analyses called for by practice-based approaches (Munson 2015), and this is especially true for large and complex datasets. Here, we de­scribe a set of statistical methods that are explic­itly designed to quantify variation and population structure at different scales. We first describe these techniques and then apply them to evaluate how Classic Maya ritual differentiation varies through time and space, and is partitioned among sites at different social scales. 
Measuring ritual diversity. We use a simple estimate of diversity (D) to assess the probability, p, that two ritual inscriptions randomly sampled from the extant corpus of Maya hieroglyphic monuments belong to the same ritual ceremony based on its verbal root form expressed in Classic Mayan. Simpson's (1 949) index is a standard measure of diversity commonly used in ecology to quantify habitat biodiversity (Legendre et al. 2005) and applied in population genetics to assess heterozygosity (Nei 1987). Formally, Simpson's index, is given as: 
j
D=l-'L,p;
i=I 

where P; is the proportion of ritual ceremony i of j total rituals. This gives an index that ranges from 0 to 1, indicating the probability that two rituals chosen at random from the sample are different. We use this index to measure ritual diversity be­cause it takes into account the number of rituals present as well as the relative abundance of each ritual. Diversity is a function of ritual richness and evenness, or how the rituals are distributed among each category. This index is sensitive to sample size so we also need to consider possible effects due to small samples. We use this index to evaluate changes in ritual diversity through time and to detect population structure at different scales as described by the index below.

Note the association between increased ritual frequency and monument inscription dur­ing the seventh century. 
cent adaptations for cultural data, the fixation in­dex FsT is used to measure the extent of ritual differentiation as observed from Classic Maya hieroglyphic monuments. This provides a quan­titative measure of the degree to which the di­versity of rituals recorded at a single site is rep­resented in the total population. As a relative measure of differentiation, FsT is calculated as the ratio of the difference between the total esti­mated population diversity Dr and the average estimated subpopulation diversity D, over the total estimated population diversity Dr, formally ex­
pressed as: 

Ranging from 0 to 1, a FsTvalue of 0 indicates no differentiation between subpopulations or that all of the diversity in the population is represented within each subpopulation; a value of 1, in con­trast, indicates complete differentiation between subpopulations. In other words, low FsT values indicate a high degree of interaction or cultural transmission between sites and sharing of similar ritual traditions. High values, in comparison, sug­gest little interaction among sites and in this case, could reflect divergence of Classic Maya ritual traditions. 
Originally developed by Wright ( 1951, 1965) to measure genetic differentiation between sub­populations, F-statistics, such as FsT• have re­cently been used to investigate the population structure of cultural variation. Bell et al. (2009) pioneered the application of cultural F5Tin study­ing the evolution of prosocial human behavior by comparing genetic and cultural differentiation at a global scale. More recently, these measures have been used in large-scale cross-cultural stud­ies of European folktales (Rossel et al. 2013), to examine musical variation in Austronesian abo­riginal songs (Rzeszutek et al. 2012), and to detect archaeological cultures in Neolithic Europe (Shennan et al. 2015). We can make qualitative comparisons between FsTvalues generated from our study with the results from other cross-cul­tural studies to inform our understanding of cul­tural variation within Classic Maya society. In the above cases, population structure was inferred from a wide range of cross-cultural datasets and consistently show values less than .10 (see Shen-

Size of the circles indicates the different site-size classes based on the number of legible glyph blocks found on hieroglyphic monuments. Color rep­resents the number of ritual inscriptions found at each site. Labels identify sites with 100 or more glyph blocks that were included in the current analyses. Three-letter codes correspond to site names listed in Supplemental Table 2.

In addition, recent archaeo­logical applications of population structure in or­nament and pottery data show similar magnitudes for Neolithic European cultures <Psr = .134 for pottery and <Psr = .109 for ornament data (Shen­nan et al. 2015). Scherer (2007) has also recently used used Fsr to infer population structure among Classic Maya groups based on dental metric data, thus providing a unique opportunity to make structured comparisons between biological and cultural variation within the same archaeological population. 
Hierarchical extensions of the fixation index can also be used to assess how diversity is parti­tioned among subpopulations within groups CFsc),as well as how it is partitioned between groups within the total population CFsr). Thus, an advan­tage of this family of F-statistics is the ability to measure population structure at multiple nested scales. In this case, we can partition ritual diver-

sity into groups based on geography, site size, or other sociopolitical groupings to investigate how ritual diversity is partitioned at these different scales. One way to consider possible effects of space on population structure is to examine the variance among sites within specific geographic regions as well as the variance among these re­gions relative to the total. To do this, we classify sites into seven different archaeological zones that were first defined by Culbert (1973; Culbert and Rice 1990) and later used in Scherer's (2007) study of Classic Maya population differentiation based on biological traits. We also consider pop­ulation structure as a function of site size based on the overall quantity of monumental inscrip­tions found at each site. This allows us to examine differences in ritual diversity within and between groups of sites that had different levels of scribal output as expressed in hieroglyphic monuments. 
Assessing Ritual Dissimilarity 
Correlations between geographic distance, so­cial network distance, site size, and ritual dis­similarity are obtained using Mantel and partial Mantel tests (Legendre and Legendre 2012; Smouse et al. 1986), as implemented in the R package "vegan" (Oksanen et al. 2014). Mantel tests are commonly used to measure the correla­tion between two distance or similarity matrices, where standard regression analysis cannot be used to assess significance because the distances are not independent. P-values are obtained by com­paring the observed correlation against a distrib­ution of correlations obtained by randomly per­muting the rows and columns of the matrix. 
We first computed a ritual dissimilarity matrix using the Bray-Curtis (BC) differentiation mea­sure (Bray and Curtis 1957) implemented in the R package "ecodist" (Goslee and Urban 2007), which quantifies the shared differences between two sites based on the relative frequency of ritual inscriptions at each site. Importantly for archae­ological data, this measure ignores instances of negative matches (i.e., shared absences) that are common in sparse matrices. We then test the hy­pothesis that isolation by distance is a factor ex­plaining ritual dissimilarity using a simple Mantel test to compare matrices of BC measures with spatial distances. Spatial distance is measured us­ing Euclidean distance between projected UTM coordinates. Since the Classic Maya region is smaller than continental datasets (e.g., Shennan et al. 2015), and relatively close to the equator, Euclidean distances provide a good measure of distance between sites. A social network distance matrix was generated based on the presence or absence of a tie between two sites, with ties de­fined by the inscription of foreign emblem glyphs or personal names of individuals from other sites (see Munson and Macri 2009). Finally, we test the effect of sample size by computing a matrix that measures the difference in the total number of glyph blocks between pairs of sites. Combining these matrices in a partial Mantel test allows us to consider the effect of one variable at a time while accounting for the other variables. 
Results 

It is well known that the tradition of carving hi­eroglyphic monuments was widespread in Classic Maya society. Scholars recognize major scribal centers based on the quantity and quality of texts discovered at sites like Copan, Palenque, and Tikal (Martin and Grube 2008), while epigraphic studies of individual centers provide unparalleled details about Classic Maya political history (Houston 1993; Looper 2003; Polyukhovych 2012). This uneven distribution of hieroglyphic inscriptions, along with limited documentation of monuments and varied levels of epigraphic analysis, has cre­ated a situation in Maya studies that privileges the largest and best documented hieroglyphic records (c.f. Martin and Grube 2008). For a sys­tematic investigation of ritual variation, we need to minimize this subjective bias and consider the most complete set of hieroglyphic inscriptions currently available from the MHD. In analyzing these data, however, we also need to consider the potential effects of sample-size variation in the statistical techniques we employ. 
Archaeologists have long recognized the re­lationship between sample size and diversity (Grayson 1981; Neiman 1995). We therefore need to base our diversity estimates on samples of ritual inscriptions that are drawn from the same population. To do this we first evaluate the rela­tionship between ritual frequency and sample size based on the total number of glyph blocks recorded at each site (Figure 4). Although the
