Writing South American Archaeology 
After Steward: A Review Essay 

Handbook of South American Archaeology. HELAINE SILVERMAN and WILLIAM H. ISBELL, editors. Springer, New York, 2008. XXVI, 1192 pp. 430 illus. $179.00 (Hardcover), ISBN 978-0-387-79407-5.

An edited volume of 1, 157 pages (plus index) that addresses Greater Amazonian, Andean, Patagonian, and other South American archaeologies in proportions not seen since the Handbook of South American Indians (Steward 1946-50; henceforth HSAI) surely merits extended treatment in an essay transcending the usual book review. Indeed, the Handbook of South American Archaeology (henceforth HSAA) is the equivalent of at least five books (based on my perspective of the sec­tions of this volume). This review essay seeks to high­light major issues and debates raised in the HSAA while simultaneously presenting to the reader who might not wade through the entire monumental volume an accu­rate sense of its content. In this review, I stress the Ama­zonian chapters both because of my own expertise in that region and because the significant attention paid to the lowlands in the HSAA is one of the volume's most laudable features, equitably balancing treatments of the better known Andean societies. 
The editors, Helaine Silverman and William Isbell, are well known for their past editorial work in produc­ing important volumes of contributed chapters on Andean prehistory (Isbell and Silverman 2002, 2006; Silverman and Isbell 2002; Silverman 2004). In the current volume, they have extended their reach to the entire South American continent, rising above differ­ences of language, national traditions of scholarship, interregional differences (e.g., Andean vs. Amazonian), and long-standing as well as new debates. They have done this by aggregating major authorities from South America, North America, and Europe who exhibit dif­ferences of training and approach, and who represent generations of archaeological thinking and research in their areas of interest. One can find processual archae­ology, postprocessual archaeology, and several excel­lent chapters on public archaeology and heritage management, what might be deemed a new archaeol­ogy of practice. 
In this volume, one can perceive, as if in cross­section, a series of conceptual motifs threading their way across various linking chapters. They concern ongoing and past discussions about periodization and priority of sites with regard to questions of influence and complexity; interpretations of ethnicity, culture, and language in the past; history of archaeological research in South America; origins and configurations of political complexity; iconicity and perspectivism in prehistory; and the nature of landscape transformations, past and present. 
An edited volume of this size apparently involved difficult decisions about inclusion and exclusion of top­ics and authors, as well as disappointments concerning papers solicited but not delivered (Preface). We cannot know who else the editors solicited for contributions but did not deliver, and who was not asked. Certain con­temporary archaeologists not present in the volume are nevertheless represented by many citations. This is most notable in the Amazonian sections oftheHSAA to which Betty Meggers and Anna Roosevelt did not contribute. 
The volume is bracketed by a "Continental Intro­duction" (Silverman) and "Conclusion" (Isbell) between which are 57 chapters arranged in an eight­part sectional structure that encompasses central top­ics, as the editors see these, of South American prehistory: Early Occupations of South America, Envi­ronment and Subsistence, Lowland Moundbuilders, Continental Variations in Non-State Complexity, Demographic and Cultural Expansions, States and Empires of the Central Andes, Death Practices and Beliefs, and Ethics and Practice in South American Archaeology. These chapters review reams of new data that have come to light since publication of the HSAI.

The volume functions, therefore, as a principal refer­ence tool for contemporary South American archaeol­ogy, and it is the only one current and comprehensive. 
Introduction and Conclusion 
The opening chapter, "Continental introduction" (Sil­
verman), presents a retrospective view of modem South 
American archaeology's origins, with particular atten­
tion to the intellectual project of Julian Steward in cre­
ating his massiveHandbookof South American Indians. 
Silverman considers Steward's model of multilinear 
evolution of South American civilizations to have been 
foundational in understanding complexity and its ori­
gins. She analyzes other continental schemes that have 
been proposed as a comparative framework for the 
HSAA, and concludes with an appeal for archaeology to 
transcend "area studies" so as to generate a more holis­
tic practice. 
In the concluding chapter Isbell not only reflects on highlights in some of the previous 58 chapters, but also looks forward, especially to new relationships and improved communication among archaeologists, in var­ious countries, at diverse latitudes and elevations, across the continent and across oceans. Isbell also notes the passing of what has come to be called the standard model of ethnology and archaeology (Stahl 2002; Viveiros de Castro 1996), and its gradual replacement by new understandings. These new understandings include historical ecology, innovative studies in the ori­gins of complexity and urbanism, and novel approaches to heritage management and public archaeology (rep­resented in the final section of the HSAA). 
Periodization and Interpretation 
of the South American Past 
The concept of stages of increasing complexity was powerfully influential in much of the archaeology that followed Steward's Handbook of South American Indi­ans, which may be considered the beginning point of the standard model (Stahl 2002; Viveiros de Castro 1996). Rowe's ( 1962) relative chronology, which pre­dominates in the North American Andean literature, was intended to be a corrective, but that scheme is now being sorely tested by new data, with its continued utility in some doubt (Isbell). 
The supreme importance of the archaeological hori­zon comes into question especially as concerns the orig­inal Andean state, which Pozorski and Pozorski suggest emerges on the coast first, in the late Pre-Ceramic Period (see also Dulanto). Cara! of the Late Preceramic, located near the coast in the Supe valley, may be the first South American city (Makowski; Pozorski and Pozorski) and associated with an "inchoate" state (Makowski), even though monumental architecture associated with ceremonial purposes on the coast later 
vanishes with the emergence of Chavfn de Huantar in 
the highlands (Burger), the preeminence of which is 
now questioned (Pozorski and Pozorski). 
In terms of the standard view of Pre-Ceramic sim­
plicity, it is worth noting that elsewhere in South Amer­
ica, complex hunter-gatherers were clearly evident who 
were either lacking ceramics altogether, as with the 
builders of the sambaquis (Gaspar et al.), or making pot­
tery, as with the shell midden people of northern Brazil 
(Oliver; Neves), whose cultures were probably other­
wise quite different in many ways from the people of 
the sambaquis. Functional pottery is not necessary to 
complexity (Neves; Roosevelt 1995), nor is writing 
(Makowski), though simple ceramics probably are at 
some point an accoutrement to all complex societiei-. 
relying on agriculture, especially manioc cultivators. 
and others dependent on foods, domesticated and not 
that are otherwise toxic (Oliver; Rostain); ceramics also 
may be particularly important where fermented cere­
monial beverages come into use (Oyuela-Caycedo). 
The actual historical processes resulting in archae­ological periodification speak to the heart of contem­porary theoretical discussions about ethnogenesis. diffusion, practice, materiality, and ideology. It is no small matter for a horizon to be redefined as a tradi­tion, as is the specific case of certain Amazonian phases (e.g., Neves). 
Horizons instantiate the spread of ideological con­cepts and their physical manifestations, as with read­ily identifiable styles of ceramics, textiles, sculptures. domesticates, and medical and postmortuary technol­ogy (e.g., trephination and mummification). These traits were no doubt conveyed from one ethnic group to another, in a seemingly unconscious manner, over short expanses of time yet broad ranges of terrain. Such a pat­tern of transmission conceivably could have occurred in long dialect chains (as seen today in Australian or Eskimoan languages), or if not that, then between adja­cent languages that shared some mutual intelligibility, even if they were basically different. 
Linguistics, Migrations, and Other Population Movements 
For those interested in unraveling a past without writ­ing, contacts and exchanges that occur in the juxtapo­sition of different languages and cultures mean that the endpoint receiving-group of some artifact or techno­logical behavior in prehistory may not have known any­thing of the existence of the initial group that produced it, and may even have resorted to imitation of the orig­inal so well that to the trained eye of the archaeologist, the point of manufacture becomes a regional question, not a site-specific one. These archaeological regions are not dissimilar from the notion of language areas in lin­guistics, though it is unlikely, or at best, extremely dif-

ficult, to offer conclusive evidence that they would have overlapped (for Arawakan these difficulties are dis­cussed in Santos-Granero 2002). That is because we lack a contemporary written guide to this prehistory, although the colorful, knotted-cords known as khipu may indeed have been just that (Urton). 
It becomes at least heuristically useful at this junc­ture to propose that the object of inquiry may not be a specific kind of artifact, or even a site, but rather, a polity, or several polities involving, as Isbell calls it, "international identities" (p. 731 ). The qualifying term "international" is certainly apt for the time frame, and ethnographically it also makes sense, because in the modern cultural and linguistic context, anyone famil­iar with the many maps of language distributions in South America will immediately note that in most of the continent (the Central Peruvian Andes excluded), few concentrations of a continuous, single language exist over any significant acreage. Linguistic areas can contain languages of diverse (linguistically) genetic origins, and there is a tendency for different linguistic areas to be rather circumscribed and dissimilar, as observed in differences between Amazonian vs. Andean languages (Dixon andAikenvald 1999: 9-10). The areal pockets of relatively small groups (Panoan, Tacanan, Harakmbut, Jivaroan), to say nothing of the many isolates, are not, in fact, a linguistic exception. The Llanos de Mojos of Bolivia, which is only about the size of the state of Iowa, alone contains, apart from the national language Spanish, 13 languages today, including four language families and five linguistic isolates (Walker). The Llanos de Mojos was even more diverse shortly after the arrival of the first Europeans in the seventeenth century, with more than thirty dis­tinct groups, though only six constituted "major peo­ples" (Block 1994: 16 ). Areas of peoples speaking diverse, mutually unintelligible languages, whether in the same family or not, are the norm (Dixon andAiken­vald 1999), and this was probably the case in South America, at least from about 2000 B.P. onwards (Erick­son; Gaspar et al.; Neves; Oliver). That is roughly the beginning of the time when one sees expansions (or diasporas, as some authors would have it), as with polychrome pottery and circular village sites (Heck­enberger) and intensification of landscape transfor­mations, as in the initial spread of Amazon Dark Earths (Erickson; Oliver; Heckenberger; Versteeg; also see Arroyo-Kalin 2008), and displacements of people, as along the extreme southern Brazilian coast with the dis­appearance of sambaqui-making cultures (Gaspar et al.) and their likely replacement by agricultural Tupian­speaking peoples (Noelli). This also means that hori­zons in prehistory more than likely enveloped peoples speaking diverse tongues, and may have involved inter­group warfare on scales never before seen. 
The evidence of far-flung movement of people over the South American landscape may have close associ­ations with warfare and, in some cases, imperial expan­sion. Inca forts (Covey) and way-stations are now known farther east and south than had been realized ear­lier. Also, it is possible that superbly crafted and enor­mous geometric figures, such as circles and rectangles of 90-300 meters in diameter, recently found in the western Brazilian Amazon, had defensive purposes (Parssinen et al. 2009). Further, it has been suggested that a high frequency of warfare in the area where Ama­zonia abuts the eastern base of the Andes may be a lin­gering function of Inca and perhaps earlier imperial expansions into-and contractions from-the volatile lowlands (Robarchek and Robarchek 1997:140-141). To the east, a site with significant imperial, Cuzco-style architecture, for example, exists in the Ceja de Selva at Inca Llacta, in the area where the Chachapoyas were active a few hundred years earlier. The Amazonian area is known not only for warfare but eulogizing of war through collection of trophy heads, also seen on the western flank of the Andes (Verano). 
In South America, differences of languages tend to imply ethnic separateness, with the well-known excep­tions being the Upper Xingu (Lathrap 1970: 127) and, to a lesser extent (because of greater linguistic homo­geneity), the Northwest Amazon. Jesuit missions may have artificially created multilingual amalgamations that were peaceful, though multilingualism would have given way soon to the establishment of Moxa in low­land Bolivia, Quichua in Ecuador and Peru, Lingua Geral Amaz6nica in Brazilian Amazonia, Lingua Geral Paulista in southern Brazil, and modern Guarani in Paraguay andArgentina (e.g., Block 1994; Freire 2004; Rodrigues 1986). Donald Lathrap ( 1970: 113, 126-127) had initially postulated an "invasion" of Barrancoid peoples, whom he identified as Arawakan (Maipuran) speakers, in their presumed expansion out of the Cen­tral Amazon into the lower Orinoco drainage, displac­ing Saladoid people, and into the Ucayali basin of Peru displacing the Late Shakimu people, and into eastern Bolivia and the Upper Xingu, presumably displacing earlier peoples, if there were any earlier peoples there. The appearance of the Nofurei ceramic complex at Pefia Roja around A.O. 1 in the middle Caqueta basin is another example, although of the Amazon Polychrome diaspora, also discussed (Oliver). 
Heckenberger, who acknowledges a debt to Lath­rap, speaks of an Arawakan "diaspora" from the West­ern Amazon and Bolivia into the Upper Xingu. In today's parlance, diaspora has the connotation of some group of persons being somewhat unwillingly scattered about (Eduardo Viveiros de Castro, oral communica­tion, 2007). Is the Arawakan "diaspora" really that, or was it, rather, an example of people on a grander mis-

sion of introducing more complexity to diverse, differ­
entiated societies speaking unintelligible tongues across 
the geography of Amazonia, or was it simply an expan­
sion, to be sure, of a voluntary sort? The data seem 
inconclusive on these points. 
Regardless of the nearly pan-Amazonian associa­
tions sometimes drawn between Arawakan and certain 
features of cultures long since disappeared (e.g., Horn­
borg 2005), the thesis of connecting language to ceram­
ics, as Lathrap originally put forth, is not yet supported 
with bioarchaeological or genetic evidence. Tupf­
Guaranf speaking people cannot be unequivocally 
equated with the Tupiguarani polychrome style 
(Noelli), though it is often very tempting to do just that 
(e.g., Heckenberger, p. 947). Bioarchaeological data 
sometimes prove diffusion instead of migration, even 
when the traits in question are highly elaborated. Styles 
of cranial modification and textile genres in the Ata­
cama Desert, originally thought to be from Tiwanaku 
settlers, are found by archaeologists to be associated 
with skeletons that show continuity with earlier peo­
ples (Tung), and whether Tiwanaku influence in the 
desert of northern Chile is from Altiplano colonists or local peoples remains an issue (Rivera; Stovel). Partially supporting evidence for Amazonian diasporas, if that is what they were, may in fact be available in the highly polymorphic HLA (Human Leucocyte Antigen) data collected by Francis Black and others in the l 970s-80s (e.g., Neves 2006). On the other hand, Black himself (1991) pointed out a lack of predictable associations between genetics of the HLA system on the one hand, and language and culture on the other, because there was not, he suggested, much opportunity in South America for genetic drift, regardless of ethnic differ­entiation. Apparently, groups fused over time. 
Diasporas are also considered in this volume for the Andean region. John Murra's model of "verticality" or "ecological complementarity" has been influential in Andean archaeology. It concerns highland people sent to populate far-flung, lower lying colonies (Murra 1980: 176-189). The presence or absence of these colonies can be resolved by various methods, includ­ing through bioarchaeology. Movements of people have been bioarchaeologically documented in the Middle Horizon emanating from Tiwanaku, Bolivia, and from Wari, Peru (Tung; Rivera). In addition, there is the archaeologically and ethnohistorically well-known Inca system of establishing way-stations (tampukuna) and other administrative settlements in foreign territories (Covey) and sometimes peopling these with mit­maqkuna (Acuto, p. 848; Church and von Hagen, p. 916), that is, non-Inca workers brought from elsewhere. 
Migration, of course, is not the only means of mov­ing people and objects across space. Trade can be a major practice. In the Ecuadorian Andes, the docu­
mentary record speaks of a professional caste of traders 
who dealt in sumptuary goods, called mindal<ies (Bray; 
Valdez), and who existed since ancient times before the 
Spanish arrival. In the blurred mosaic between the 
Andes and the Amazon in northeastern Peru, the 
Chachapoyas people would have served as intermedi­
aries, culturally and politically, between the highlands 
and the lowlands (Church and von Hagen). In Ecuador 
evidence suggests ongoing exchange in salt, gourds, 
gold, pets, and even slaves between the Andes and the 
Amazon Basin (Bray; Salazar). Connections such as 
these, explicitly linking the Andes and the Amazon into 
a single, unified sphere of production, commerce, and 
traffic-in ideas, language, icons, domesticates, and 
· 
even people-has also been recently documented for 
the enigmatic (as to identity) Lecos people of the 
Department of La Paz, Bolivia (Dudley 2009). 
Migrations are, in general, difficult to recognize archaeologically because they can be conflated with simple diffusion, especially in times preceding true empires and multiethnic states, such as Tiwanaku (its multiethnic character suggested by the coexistence there, among other things, of two different styles of cra­nial modification, see Tung). In other instances, one can really only make inferences by using ethnohistory to know how objects moved across ethnically bounded units. 
One thing is certain in this book: one cannot rely on archaeological evidence alone in disentangling the Arawakan or Incan diasporas (or what Noelli quite appropriately calls "expansion" in reference to Tupian peoples' migration from Southwestern Amazonia, beginning ca. 2500 B.P.) from a model of diffusion, as in a horizon. The problem is freezing interethnic trans­mission in a time frame amenable to understanding directionalities in the flow of goods, ideas, words, and perhaps even ideophones (Nuckolls 1999), regardless of who invented or coined them first (Tung). 
Interpretations of Complexity 
A continuous theme in the HSAA is how to assess social and political complexity in prehistory. Minimally, com­plexity is supralocal organization, or at least the formal social and political alliance of at least two settlements. As to when "complex society" begins, Andeanists are divided, some advocating the Late Preceramic, others the Formative Period but some favoring still later phases. Hastorf suggests that Formative Period settlements in the Titicaca Basin could have been "autonomous" rather than linked in some higher order of organization. In contrast, Pozorski and Pozorski see significant com­plexity on the coast of Peru centuries before the local Formative Period. Some authors associate complexity with full-blown states such as Mochica (Castillo and Uceda) or empires such as Wari (Isbell). Cuzco was

undoubtedly the center of the lnka Empire, the elite of which were supported by a complex system of taxation and tribute (Covey). The chiefdoms of late prehispanic (and pre-Incaic) Ecuador exhibited complexity "of a different order" (McEwan and Degaldo-Espinoza, p. 505). These societies had advanced maritime technol­ogy, erected platform mounds, and built raised fields for agriculture. It seems reasonable for McEwan and Delgado-Espinoza to classify these societies as "poli­ties." however ambiguous the term. 
Of particular interest is the evidence for periods of political fragmentation amid complexity, as in Mochica prehistory (Castillo and Uceda) and even reversals of complexity. South American societies certainly lost complexity after European contact, and sometimes they lost fundamental technology, such as cultivation of domesticates, sedentism, and even knowing how to man­ufacture fire (Balee 2006; Cormier 2003) in a phenom­enon I earlier called agricultural regression (as cited by Oliver, p. 193). It now seems abundantly clear that sim­ilar losses of complexity and technology took place widely in prehistory also-as seen in Tumaco (A.D. 350) and Calima (A.D. 500--800), southwestern Colom­bia (Drennan), and collapses of the Mochicas at various times (Castillo and Uceda). But for the prehistoric low­lands, such an argument seems harder to substantiate. 
Anaologies are sometimes drawn between the social organizations of Amazonian-specifically Ge-and Andean or Pacific coastal groups. Raymond (p. 81) associates the Las Vegas people (8500-4600 B.C.) of coastal southwestern Ecuador with the Xavante of Cen­tral Brazil, in terms of the vast and divergent areas they exploited for hunting, fishing, and gathering. Levi­Strauss (1963) designated South America (especially Ge societies of Central Brazil) as the continent of dual­ism. or more specifically, of binary structure as con­cerning classes of persons, both in terms of society (kinship) as well as the universe (cosmology). Origi­nally stimulated by a reading of Nimuendaju's account of Ge societies, Zuidema (1964:21-22) arrived at a sim­ilar conclusion concerning the moiety organization of Upper and Lower Cuzco in Inca times. 
Archaeologists traditionally regard mortuary vari­ation as evidence of social difference/class stratifica­tion. This is readily seen in burial patterns in the Central Andes (Castillo and Uceda; Dulanto; Isbell; Lau; Moore and Mackey; Proulx). Site hierarchy also is evidence of complexity. Urbanism may be associated with states. Little doubt exists as to widespread urbanism of the Desert Coast and Andes in late prehispanic times, even if Andean urbanism should not be confused with the urbanism of Western antiquity, or Mediterranean and Mesopotamian urbanism (Makowski). The Mochicas (Castillo and Uceda) and the Chimu (Moore and Mackey) had cities that functioned as centers "to which labor and resources flowed" (Moore and Mackey, p. 784), such as Huaca del Sol-Huaca de la Luna and Chan Chan, respectively. The populations in these urban cen­ters were not all royal but essentially their societies were "elitist" (Castillo and Uceda, p. 715). 
Technology also is sometimes regarded as an indi­cator of complexity in terms of the labor freed from food production, to be supported by others. Work in gold, emerald, and quartz in coastal Ecuador (Drennan; McE­wan and Delgado-Espinoza; Valdez) is notable and associated with chiefdom societies. Inca mining tech­niques and foundries for working copper in the Atacama Desert (Rivera) are indicative of advanced technologies associated with stratified organizations. Record­keeping (Urton) and the very organization of labor (Covey) are elements of state technology as well. Yet sophisticated agricultural technology runs the gamut from simple (Versteeg, Rostain, Walker) to extremely complex societies (Isbell). Chinchorro mummification in the Atacama Desert region is an example of a sophis­ticated technology found with what must have been relatively simple social organization (Arriaza et al.). 
Underlying the political debate is a question that will not simply disappear. How and why did complexity and the building of "civilization" occur in South Amer­ica, roughly contemporary with similar developments elsewhere, such as China, Mesopotamia, Southeast Asia, South Asia, and Mesoamerica (Dillehay 2000: 287-288)? Is the change of societal organization from simple, village, or camp autonomy and egalitarianism to multisite, ranked groups and class stratification a latent facet of anatomically and ultimately behaviorally modern human nature? Or are we dealing not with processual phenomena, well understood from the stan­dard model both of ethnology (Viveiros de Castro 1996) and archaeology (Stahl 2002), but rather with contin­gent factors that affect archaeological and historical records and by which ensue the ethnogenesis of human societies in patterned interaction with local landscapes (Heckenberger; Makowski)? 
The answer to these questions depends a great deal on how one grapples with theory, whether determinis­tic or of the middle range, which would tend to be most appropriate for those who adopt a model deriving from historical ecology, not cultural ecology or its subsequent iterations, which essentially are based on a doctrine of environmental determinism over simple societies. Such a doctrine could never explain the rise of complexity, in fact. 
Ancestors 
The veneration of ancestors is widespread in South America, whether in highlands or lowlands, whether along coastlines or within interiors, whether in the ancient past or the present moment. Richly ornamented

funerary urns in Maraca and Marajoara ceramics are likely representative of once-living individuals now turned into ancestors (Guapindaia; Schaan). Speaking of the Central Andes, Lau points out that in the absence of writing it is difficult to distinguish one individual from another, so one must be very careful about attribut­ing identities of specific ancestors (as represented in stone and ceramic imagery). 
Arguably the best evidence of ancestor worship, and a belief in an afterlife, is to be seen in secondary buri­als, and these occur in the Desert Coast, the Andes, and Amazonia (Drennan; Guapindaia; Lau; Isbell 1997). In some cases, secondary burials of disarticulated bones indicate execution and disrespect of the individuals, or captives, so interred (Verano), but that in and of itself does not vitiate the notion of a widespread belief in an afterlife. 
Amazonia poses its own set of problems. The sec­ondary burial urns at Maraca in Amazonia, which are covered with lids of human heads and faces, strongly suggest transformation of the skeletal material inside into ancestors (Guapindaia). The reason one can make that inference is at least partly comparative, though it is not through ethnographic analogy per se. Yet without ethnography an archaeologist would not have the mate­rial remains for knowing that traditionally Wari' dead are completely eaten raw by affines to send these dead into the afterlife as ancestors, whereas killed enemies are roasted and only partially consumed, the remainder of their bodies left to rot in the forest specifically so that they cannot enjoy an afterlife (Conklin 2001). 
Looking at South American prehistory, it is not always clear who, or indeed what, allegedly may have enjoyed some sort of ongoing elan vital after the rup­ture of the divide between life and death. 
The sunken enclosures of the Middle Formative in the Andean Altiplano, and later at Tiwanaku, with tenoned heads (also seen much earlier, at Chavin, see Burger), nevertheless, instantiate what Hastorf intrigu­ingly denotes as the chthonic power of the ancestors and of meeting sites with oracular significance (Tiwanaku) that conceptually united the living and the dead. 
Ancestral cults are discussed in the context of sam­baquis (Gaspar et al.), Maraj6 Island (Guapindaia; Schaan), and Southwestern Colombia (where leader­ship and religion evidently were fused, see Drennan). The existence of ancestor worship is not only rather obvious from the chullpas, the mummy bundles in them, and the various offerings of coca leaves (etc.) made to them, as symbolic of sacrifice, but it is also clear from the ethnohistoric record in the sixteenth century, indi­cating that ancestor worship was hidden from Spanish conquistadores, assuming new forms. 
Again returning to challenges for the archaeologist, the iconicity of ancestor veneration is seen in linguis­tic and musical genres that are fused in the case of var­ious Arawakan speaking groups of the Northwest Ama­zon (Hill 1993; Santos-Granero 2002). Ancestors are not only remembered but transformed into cult figures by "spoken, chanted and sung speech," which exhibits a repetitious quality (Hill 1993: 17). That repetitious­ness no doubt serves mnemonic purposes as would have the tenoned heads in the subterranean temple near Kalasasaya at Tiahuanaco (Isbell in Chapter 37; Has­torf) or Chavfn de Huantar (Burger). 
Enduring Amazanian Debates 
Several HSAA authors criticize Betty Meggers for envi­ronmental determinism (e.g., Erickson; Heckenberger) 

· 
or her refusal to accept counter information showing the indigenous evolution ofValdivia pottery of Ecuador, not an import from Japan (Zeidler). Others, in contrast, essentially accept Meggers' periodization of Amazon­ian prehistory but with modifications (Neves; Schaan). Meggers's contribution to Amazonian archaeology lies in the data she and her late husband, Clifford Evans, gen­erated, if not the interpretations thereof, and certainly in the promotion of lowland archaeology practiced by archaeologists in the Amazonian countries. 
Donald Lathrap's spirit is seen in the diaspora argu­ments of some of the Amazonianists, and his contribu­tion, with modifications, is explicitly acknowledged by them (Erickson; Heckenberger; Neves; Oliver). It is important to note that the current generation of Ama­zonianists is looking at much more than traditions and horizons of pottery or even of linguistic differentiation and expansion, which is, of the two, the most difficult to prove. Archaeologists have greatly expanded the dis­cussion to incorporate the development and geographic spread of new agrarian technologies, such as Amazon Dark Earths, raised fields, and a host of other landscape alterations, such as circular plazas, ring ditches, cause­ways, and other geometric patterns of earthworks. 
Anna Roosevelt's research is made known by the citations of her finding of Amazonian pottery at Pedra Pintada cave and Taperinha mound sites being the old­est (8000-7000 B.P.) in South America (and the New World) (Roosevelt 1995) as well as for her discovery of artifacts associated with the oldest foragers yet known in Amazonia at Pedra Pintada (Roosevelt et al. 1996) [see Heckenberger; Oliver; Neves]. 
Amazonia: Domestication or Transformation of the Landscape? 
Landscapes are, by definition, cultural creations. Sev­eral chapters (Erickson; Heckenberger; Isbell [Con­clusion]; Walker) refer to Amazonian environments as "domesticated landscapes." Erickson (p. 158) employs the term essentially as a synonym for anthropogenic landscapes, whether consciously manipulated or not,

whereas Walker defines it programmatically as a process 
that "depends more on the creation of desirable attrib­
utes in the environment, and less on the manipulation 
of genetic material to push species across the boundary 
between 'wild' and 'domesticated"' (p. 936). It is per­
haps not surprising that both Walker and Erickson have 
focused on the Llanos de Mojos, which is one of the 
most engineered environments yet known in Amazonia. 
That is also where William Denevan (1966) carried out 
pioneering geographic and aerial research on raised 
fields and various complexes of mounds. Denevan has 
referred to "cultivated landscapes" in a way similar to 
the use of domesticated landscape in these chapters; he 
suggested that raised fields and similar evidence of inten­
sification of food production across South America con­
note more similarities than differences in anthropogenic 
landscape modifications between the Andes and Ama­
zonia (Denevan 2001 :304). 
The term "landscape domestication" derives origi­
nally from plant geneticist and historical ecologist 
Charles Clement ( 1999), who was explicit on the point 
of human intentionality underlying the concept. Land­
scape domestication, for him, is "a conscious process 
by which human manipulation of the landscape results 
in changes in landscape ecology and in the demo­
graphics of its plant and animal populations resulting 
in a landscape more productive and congenial for 
humans" (Clement 1999: 190; also Clement 2006: 165 ). 

It is appropriate to refer to these environments as land­
scapes transformed by human-mediated disturbance 
(Bake 2006), in which substrates have been altered to 
a greater or lesser extent and some species are domes­
ticated, some are not, and some are semidomesticated. 
This view allows for consideration of anthropogenic 
forests found on ridged fields and mounds of Suriname 
(Versteeg) as well as a host of other anthropogenic 
forests found in the Guianas more generally (Rostain) 
and Brazilian Amazonia, including liana forests, bam­
boo forests, and diverse kinds of palm forests on terra 
firme (Balt.e 1988, 1989, 2006). 
At roughly 2500-2000 B.P., Amazonian groups 
began to intensify agriculture with the use of Amazon 
Dark Earths, which is an anthropogenic soil horizon ·, (Erickson; Neves; Oliver). This involved changing the 
ways crops domesticated thousands of years earlier 
were used, perhaps especially bitter manioc (Arroyo­
Kalin 2008). It is at some point in these last two mil­
lennia that many of the anthropogenic landscapes noted 
today, though earlier misclassified variously as "pri­
mary forests" and the like, were formed (Erickson; 
Oliver; Oyuela-Caycedo; Rostain; Versteeg; Walker). 
After European contact, most of traditional manage­
ment of raised fields and the like disappeared, except 
for a reference to the Arawakan-speaking Palikur of French Guiana, whose lands for extensive agriculture had been reduced severely after the conquest; they began resorting again to raised field technology in the eighteenth century, meaning that the knowledge of how to make these fields, known from prehistory, was not entirely lost (Rostain, overview chapter of the Guianas ). 
Politics of the Past 
It is by now well known that archaeology is not a neu­tral science. The practice of archaeology (configuration of a project, excavation strategies, interpretation of data) is deeply affected by its social, economic, political. and historical milieu. Papers in the final section of the HSAA speak to this point (Benavides; Higueras; Scarborough; Gnecco; Verdesio; Lopes Bastos and Funari). Written by South American scholars, these "insider" papers address an important range of issues concerning the intersections of archaeology in the various countries with contemporary nationalism, racial histories, domi­nant state ideologies, and views of progress and moder­nity, among other matters. 
Final Remarks 
The Handbook of South American Archaeology demon­strates linkages in prehistory among societies from dif­ferent regions and, at the same time, it shows connections conceptually across the archaeology of South America in diverse countries, from an array of scholars. The book ecumenically presents both the standard model of South American archaeology (as discussed in Stahl 2002) as well as new models for understanding relationships between people and the facets of South American envi­ronments, such as historical ecology and perspectivism (Viveiros de Castro 1998). It also contains new ways of grasping meaning from artifacts, using one or more modem semiotic and scientific approaches, and some­times combining various subdisciplines of anthropology as well as other disciplines in order to interpret move­ments of people and exchanges of goods in prehistory. Taken together, the volume bespeaks a milestone in the archaeology of South America, Latin American refer­ence libraries should acquire it, and South Americanist archaeologists will be well served to immerse them­selves in its stimulating papers.
