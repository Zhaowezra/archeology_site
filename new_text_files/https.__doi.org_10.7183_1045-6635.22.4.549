
BIOARCHAEOLOGICAL ANALYSIS OF SACRIFICIAL VICTIMS FROM 
A POSTCLASSIC MAYA TEMPLE FROM IXLU, El PETEN, 
GUATEMALA 

William N. Duncan 
Excavations at the site of lxlu in northern Guatemala recovered a series of skulls and dismembered postcraniafrom a Post­classic (ca. A.D. 1000-1525) Maya temple. The current study considers demography, taphonomy (including mortuary pro­cessing), cultural modification and biological distance among the remains in light of ethnohistoric and archaeological data. Doing so addresses who made the deposits, why they were made, and who was interred, and informs on the use of ritual violence in the Postclassic Southern Lowlands. Six skulls were arranged in pairs on the east-west midline of the building, andfifteen skulls were placed in rows in the center of the building. All of the skulls faced east. Four postcrania were placed perpendicular to the skull rows. The skulls and postcrania were primarily late adolescent to young adult males. Three of the individuals exhibited a rare dental trait, supernumerary teeth, indicating that at least some of the individuals were 
related. The most likely scenario to account for the deposits is that the Itza, a dominant political group in the area, sacri­ficed enemy combatants drawn from raiding and buried them as a part of a dedicatory ritual in the temple. 
Las excavaciones de lxlu en el norte de Guatemala recuperaron una serie de calaveras y restos poscraneales desmembrados de un templo maya posclasico (ca. 1000-1525 d.C.). El presente estudio considera la demograffa, tafonomfa (incluyendo el procesamiento mortuorio), modificaci6n cultural y distancia biol6gica de los restos considerando Los datos etnohist6ricos y arqueol6gicos, para comprender quien hizo Los dep6sitos, por que fueron hechos, y quienes fueron enterrados en ellos. Seis craneos estaban dispuestos en pares en la lfnea media de este a oeste de! edificio y quince craneos estaban colocados en filas en el centro de! edificio. Todos los craneos veian hacia el este. Cuatro restos postcraneales estaban colocados perpendicu­larmente a las filas de craneos. Las calaveras y restos postcraneales eran principalmente de adolescentes y adultos j6venes varones. Tres de los individuos exhibieron un rasgo dental raro, dientes supernumerarios, indicando que par lo menos algunos de los individuos estaban emparentados. El escenario mas probable para justificar los dep6sitos es que los ltza, grupo politico dominante en el area, sacri.ficaron a combatientes enemigos tomados en los asaltos y Los enterraron en el temp/o como parte de un ritual dedicatorio. En los ultimos cinco aiios se ha visto un aumento dramatico en las investigaciones enfocadas en entender los dep6sitos no funerarios en Mesoamerica, aquellos que incluyen restos humanos pero que carecen de evidencia de tratamiento reverencial. Con unas pocas excepciones notables, los investigadores interesados en los mayas del Posclasico han realizado mas estudios de estos dep6sitos en las Tierras Rajas del Norte queen el area de! sur. El estudio que aquf se pre­senta amplfa esta literatura porque considera c6mo Los dep6sitos en Ixlu podrfan reflejar temas semejantes a los vistos en las Tierras Rajas de! Norte y muestra c6mo el analisis de distancia biol6gica y la contextualizaci6n polftica podrfan identificar mas temas locales implicados en la practica de violencia ritual en el Posclasico maya.

the Northern Lowlands. We know less about ritual violence during the Postclassic in the Southern Low lands, but the ethnohistoric record of the Peten lakes region in northern Guatemala allows for a highly contextualized characterization of such deposits. 
Two social groups dominated the Postclassic political geography around the Peten lakes: the Itza and the Kowoj (Figure 1). Archaeological efforts to identify these groups and understand their rela­tionships recovered a series of skulls placed in pairs and rows, along with four postcrania from a Post­classic temple (Structure 2023) from the site of Ixhi (Figure 2). The present study is a bioarchaeo­logical analysis of those remains and considers demography, cultural modification, taphonomy (including mortuary processing) and nonmetric dental traits in conjunction with ethnohistory and archaeology to gain insight into who made the deposits and why, as well as who was interred in them. In doing so, this study sheds light on Post­classic social and political dynamics around the Peten lakes and adds to our understanding of Post-classic ritual violence and nonfunerary deposits in the Southern Lowlands. 
Nonfunerary Deposits 
The basic difficulty in studying nonfunerary deposits in the Maya region was recognized 50 years ago when Coe ( 1959:77) reported burials and caches collectively. Becker (1992) and others (Chase and Chase 1998; Gillespie 2002; see below) continued to explore their overlap more fully, right­fully viewing them as a continuum. Researchers have approached the study of nonfunerary deposits from a variety of viewpoints. The first and most prominent is the identification of taphonomic sig­natures associated with specific types of trauma, mortuary processing, and modification for display (Anda Alanis 2007; Beck and Sievert 2005; Me­dina Martin and Sanchez Vargas 2007; Pijoan Aguade and Mansilla Lory 1997; Tiesler 2002; Tiesler and Cucina 2005, 2006). Tiesler (2007) has done this most recently and thoroughly, detailing specific taphonomic correlates that should reflect

various types of perimortem and postmortem pro­cessing and disposal in a larger model. Researchers have also considered the processes by which indi­viduals are selected for nonfunerary treatment, such as identifying migrants through isotopic analysis (Price et al. 2007; Spence et al. 2004; White et al. 2002, 2007). Others have attempted to understand the motivation and meaning of rituals associated with nonfunerary deposits by drawing on compar­ative archaeological (Weiss-Krejci 2003, 2004), epigraphic, ethnohistorical, and iconographic data (Miller 1999, 2007; Vail and Hernandez 2007), or by adapting cross cultural models of mortuary vio­lence to the Maya area (Duncan 2005a). Other aspects of the performance of ritual violence, such as identification of the audience, how much indi­vidual latitude actors have, or the role of animal substitution , remain largely obscure, although researchers are beginning to explore these topics as well (lnomata 2006; Vail and Hernandez 2007:139). Similarly, most studies have not con­sidered biological distance among individuals in nonfunerary deposits or attempted to situate them within their regional social and political contexts (with some notable exceptions, such as Barrett and Scherer [2005]). Additionally most of what we know about Postclassic nonfunerary deposits comes from the Northern Lowlands because of the emphasis on major sites there, Chichen Itza and Mayapan, and the fact that important ethnohistoric sources (Tozzer 1941) and Maya codices origi­nated there (Vail and Hernandez 2007: 121). Com­paring the Northern and Southern Lowlands indicates that certain themes, such as decapitation and the use of skulls, mass graves, and dismem­berment and defleshing are found in both regions, but much less is known about deposits in the south. 
Postclassic Nonfunerary Deposits in the Northern Maya Area 
Classic period iconography associated with ritual violence in the Southern Lowlands is largely (though not exclusively) characterized by an emphasis on individual rulers and the humiliation

of victims who are about to be sacrificed (Miller 2007). In the Terminal and Postclassic periods, iconography found in the north shows that the cel­ebration of an individual and the humiliation of vic­tims are both diminished, coupled with a shift to a greater emphasis on the act of sacrificial perfor­mance (Miller 2007:165). 
The emphasis on the act of violence has trans­lated to evidence of considerable variation in the depiction of sacrifice. Decapitation is among the most common forms of sacrifice in codices and is depicted on well-documented reliefs in the North­ern Lowlands (Vail and Hernandez 2007: 139). There are clear connections with decapitation and the ball game (Miller 1999; Wilkerson 1984) . Heads may have served as potential portals for animating essences passing to or from the under­world (Castro-Leal Espino 1972; Mendoza 2007a). Excavations at Chichen Itza have recov­ered numerous deposits that likely reflect decapi­tation. The Las Monjas complex held 40 skulls in a room (Bolles 1977:45). Also the outer platform of the Caracol structure at Chichen ltza held 14 crania placed in rows alongside isolated bones (Ruppert 1935: 119-125). 
Heart extraction, rare in Classic period iconog­raphy, is seen more commonly in the Postclassic (Vail and Hernandez 2007). Other forms of sacri­fice include spearing, axing, drowning, being mauled by a jaguar, disemboweling, and being thrown onto a pile of rocks from heights (Vail and Hernandez 2007). Although sacrifice is generally associated with cycles of birth and death (Mock 1998), several of these are explicitly associated with the passage of time. Decapitation and heart extraction are associated with the cardinal direc­tions of south and north, respectively (Vail and Hernandez 2007:149). The former is frequently associated with tun and katun ending rituals (Vail and Hernandez 2007: 157). Similarly, spearing and disemboweling are associated with year bearers in codex rituals (Vail and Hernandez 2007:149). 
Another theme in Postclassic violence is the use of long bones, in particular femora, as trophies and/or implements (Miller 2007: 180). This is seen in the sacred cenote at Chichen Itza (Beck and Siev­ert 2005), and in a chamber in the Castillo where femora were embedded in a wall (Miller 2007: 180). Archaeological evidence of skulls and long bones is seen most prominently on Terminal Classic plat­forms in the Puuc region at sites such as Uxmal , Nohpat, and Dzibilchaltun, though they are found elsewhere at sites such as Tlatelolco, Tenayuca, Tula, and Chichen ltza. Uxmal in particular has four such platforms in which crossed long bones alter­nate with the "death eye" motif (Miller 2007). The Madrid codex shows associations of bound captives and cenotes marked with crossed bones, so there clearly is some connection between long bones and sacrifice (Vail and Hernandez 2007). These are reminiscent of tzampantli platforms; however, Klein (2000) has noted that skull and long bone motifs on platforms are also associated with Tzitz­imime, a group of harmful "star demons of dark­ness" associated with the 52-year Calendar Round, and other, astronomically based, events (Miller and Taube 1993: 176). Thus the association of skulls and long bones may be more complex than previously thought. 
Flayed long bones are present in northern Post­classic iconography. The balustrade on the Great Ball Court at Chichen ltza depicts some of the fig­ures in a processional with skeletal legs (Salazar 1952:39). Recent analysis of remains from Cham­pot6n (Burial 23) found evidence of missing femora and detleshed tibiae and fibulae (Hurtado Cen et al. 2007 :217-220). Tiesler (2007 :27) describes two cases of Spaniards finding sacrificial victims hav­ing had their left forearm defleshed. 
Interments with multiple individuals have been used for both veneration and violation (Weiss-Kre­jci 2003). Interments with a relatively small num­ber of individuals (e.g., fewer than 10) are frequently found in altars , shrines, and domestic houses (Serafin and Peraza Lope 2007). These buri­als are commonly found in cists containing grave goods, include a combination of articulated and disarticulated individuals, and likely are family burials in which people were buried over time. 
Larger mass graves are found in cenotes and caves, as well as borrow pits and shafts below build­ings (Brady and Colas 2005; Serafin and Peraza Lope 2007; Weiss-Krejci 2003), and there is rea­son to think that the Maya regarded them similarly (Pugh 2005:50-52). The sacred cenote is the most well known example of a mass interment in the Northern Lowlands, though there were others at Chic hen ltza, including a cave that had almost 100 burials, a shaft leading to the cave below the osario, and two contexts at the Caracol structure with mul-

tiple individuals (Miller 2007). These were also found at Maya pan (Masson and Peraza Lope 2007), and recent work there and at Champot6n has found that individuals in mass graves exhibited evidence of dismemberment and defleshing (Structure Q 152 at Mayapan [Serafin and Peraza Lope 2007] and Burial 23 at Champot6n [Hurtado Cen et al. 2007]). 
Postclassic Nonfunerary Deposits in the Southern Maya Area 
Some sites in the Southern Lowlands, such as Lamanai (White 1997) and Tipu (Jacobi 2000), have yielded relatively large numbers of Postclas­sic and Colonial burials. Overall, however, there seem to have been fewer Postclassic nonfunerary deposits recovered and studied in projects in the Southern Lowlands (e.g., work in the Stann Creek district in Southern Belize [Graham 1985] or Naco in Honduras [Wonderley 1985]), than in the North­ern Lowlands , though there are some notable exceptions that suggest that some of the same themes found in the north are also in the south. An early investigation describes 40 crania found at Rio Hondo (Gann 1918). The skull pit at Colha, which dates to the Terminal Classic, included 30 individuals who were flayed (Massey 1989). Another mass deposit at the site that included numerous skulls and some postcranial remains was also associated with a termination event (Barrett and Scherer 2005). Though the remains were quite fragmented, they showed evidence of considerable processing in the form of cutmarks (Barrett and Scherer 2005). The mural at Santa Rita Corozal contains images of dancing figures holding decap­itated heads in their hands (Vail and Hernandez 2007: 133). A pair of skulls was also placed over a Late Postclassic burial at the site. Excavations pro­duced isolated mandibles and crania at the Sarteneja shoreline (Sidrys 1983) and two decap­itated skeletons were buried in the center of a ball court at Laguna de On (Masson 2000: 100). At the site of Almulunga in western El Salvador there was a relief of a decapitated person (Moser 1973:25). Two vessels from the Ulua valley in Honduras exhibited trophy heads in their imagery (Moser 1973:25). Significant nonfunerary deposits also have been found in the highlands. The skull deposits from Iximche are the best known from the Postclassic (Whittington 2003: 242-252). Forty­eight skulls were buried (primarily) in individual 
pits . Most of the skulls exhibited evidence of decapitation, and a variety of ages and males and females were represented. Thus, although less work has been done in the Southern Low lands than in the north, the use of skulls was widespread in nonfunerary contexts in both areas. Consideration of deposits from Peten, Guatemala, in particular a temple (Structure 2023) from the site oflxlu, sug­gests that other similarities existed as well. 
Peten Lakes Postclassic 
Archaeological work on the Postclassic period in the Peten lakes region began in the early 1900s, but initial excavations at Topoxte (Maler 1908) and Nojpeten (Flores [Guthe 1922]) recovered few burials. Subsequently, Cowgill ( 1963) and Bullard (1970, 1973) worked on the western and eastern ends of the lakes region. These efforts recovered a pair of Postclassic skulls facing one another at Nojpeten (modern day Flores [Cowgill 1963]). A skull burial (found under a bench) and a mass grave were located at Topoxte (Bullard 1970). Later work by Chase (1983) recovered a significant number of burials and caches of human remains, primarily skull burials in one form or another, but few from the Postclassic. A large-scale survey of the lakes region (the Central Peten Historical Ecology Pro­ject, Rice and Rice 1985) recovered inverted skull burials atZacpeten and Topoxte. Excavations at the site ofMacanche recovered 12 skulls arrange in two rows. Field notes suggested that they might have been males ( Aldenderfer, personal communication 2005). More recently, excavations by Wurster (2000) and colleagues (Acevedo 2000) found a number of complex burials, some of which included nonfunerary activities. These consisted of single skull burials, those with no skulls, multi­ple skulls included in individual burials (Acevedo 2000) and offerings including dismembered remains (Hermes 2000:82). 

The most recent long-term project around the lakes has been Proyecto Maya Colonial (PMC). PMC was a collaborative project by Prudence Rice, Don Rice, and Grant Jones that employed ethnohistorical data to identify and understand the relationships among social groups living around the lakes prior to European contact. Four social groups, which likely reflect political, ethnic, lin­eage, and linguistic distinctions, lived around the lakes at the time of conquest in 1697: the Kejaches,

the Mopans, the Itza, and the Kowoj (Jones 1998:5; Rice and Rice 2009). The first two of these groups are poorly known but seemed to have lived away from the lake shore to the northwest and south­east, respectively, and were politically less pow­erful than the latter (Jones 1998:5). The Kowoj controlled the eastern lake basins, and later the northern shore oflake Peten Itza, and were the pri­mary enemies of the Itza (Jones 1998: 17-19; 2009: 60-61). They traced their history back to Yucatan, at the site of Mayapan, and reportedly moved to the lakes area after the conquest of Yucatan by the Spaniards in the 1500s, though the movement was not likely a single mass event and may have pre­ceded the conquest of the Yucatan peninsula (Jones 2009:61). Recent investigations demonstrate the Kowoj connection to the Yucatan peninsula (Pugh 2003), indicate that they likely created mass graves in the area (Duncan 2005b), and suggest that what ultimately evolved into the larger social distinc­tions described above began on a lineage level (the Xiw) (Jones 2009). 

The Itza are the best-known group from this area because they had more contact with the Spaniards than other groups . Archaeological efforts to document ethnohistorical records are ongoing, but the Itza have a deep history going back to the Early Classic period and involving migrations to and from Peten and Yucatan (Jones 1998:7-16). Itza influence, if not control, extended from Sayaxche on the Rfo Pasion to the south and to Tipu in Belize. However their territory at the conquest of the Peten lakes was primarily in the western lake basins, which may speak to the mil­itary prowess of the Kowoj . It is clear that once the Itza arrived in Peten they were regarded as aggressive neighbors by other groups in the area, managing to conquer the Mopans and engaging in raiding and territorial disputes with other groups (Jones 1998:7-16). 
Structure 2023 at Ixlu 

Excavations by PMC focused primarily on identi­fying the Kowoj, with secondary emphasis on the Itza. The site of Ixlu (Figure 2) is best known for its 101h cycle stelae and was originally mapped by Blom in the 1920s and von Euw in the 1970s (Rice et al. 1996:38-41). Bullard excavated there in the 1960s, testing the large temple and main plaza in GroupA(Riceetal. 1996:38-41).lnthe 1980s,Pru­dence and Don Rice and colleagues remapped the site, identifying significant Postclassic occupation in the process. It was chosen for excavation because at the time it was considered to be a candidate site for Saklamakhal, the Kowoj colonial capital , and because the location of the Postclassic sites appeared to reflect consideration of space relative to the built Classic period environment (Rice et al. 1996:38-41). Additionally the site exhibited C­shaped structures which have been identified to the: south (Figure 2) (Rice et al. 1996:38-41) and mighr have shed light on cultural influences on the region that did not come from Mayapan or Chichen Itza. Excavations in 1998 focused on excavating C-and L-shaped structures at the site and on structure 2023 , a small temple in the main plaza of the site (Figure 2). Excavations of the building removed the collapse and identified the buildings' walls. Test pits were placed on the centerline of the building at the stairs and behind the building. Upon finding human remains, a 2 x 2 m test pit was placed in the middle of the structure and 1x1 m test pits on the cardinal directions at the edges of the building. 
Structure 2023 consists of three architectural components, the building platform and associated altars, the building itself, and a C-shaped bench that sits atop the primary building (Figures 3 and 4) (Romero 2004:23-24). The platform is 11 m long from east to west, 8.5 m wide and approximately 25 cm tall (Romero 2004:23-24). It is associated with two altars, both found on the center line of the platform. The first lies atop the plaza floor on the eastern end of the platform, found on the right side of Figure 4. It is approximately 1 m square and 40 cm tall. The second sits on the western portion of the platform and is 90 cm north to south, 75 cm east to west, and 35 cm tall (see Figure 4). The temple is approximately 8 m long from east to west and 6 m wide from north to south. It is 1.5 m tall with five stairs on the east. Excavations revealed red painted stucco on portions of the platform and the building itself. There are fragments of stelae associated with the collapse of the building that likely came from the twin pyramid complexes at the site (Romero 2004:23-24). The C-shaped bench that sits atop the temple is 20 cm tall. The primary structure is thought to date to the Early Postclassic, however the later component, primarily the C-shaped bench, may date to the Late Postclassic period (Cecil 2001 ).

The remains associated with the structure con­sisted of six skulls arranged in pairs, 15 skulls arranged in rows, and four postcrania. The three skull pairs were placed on an old plaza floor on the east-west center line on both sides of the building. Skulls 1 and 2 (Figures 3 and 5) were paired in the altar on the east side of Structure 2023 's platform.

Skulls 3 and 4 were found on the west side of the building. Skulls 5 and 6 were found to the east of the altar in which skulls 1 and 2 were placed. All skulls faced east (toward the plaza), except for skull 6, which had been disturbed by roots. 

Four postcranial skeletons were recovered from the same level as the skull pairs (Figure 6). Each postcranium consisted of articulated ribs, verte­brae, and os coxae, and were placed on their backs, although postcranium 3 was rolled somewhat on its right side. The long bones, clavicles, and scapu­lae, had been removed, partially dismembered, and placed in bundles on top of the articulated ribs, vertebrae, and os coxae. The hands and feet had been removed and were not present. In postcrania 1, 2, and 4, articulated cervical vertebrae were ori­ented south while the cervical vertebrae of post­cranium 3 were oriented to the north. Fifteen skulls were placed in two rows in front (to the east) of the altar sitting on top of the platform (Figure 7). A looter's trench intersected with the row at skulls 10 and 11, which were only represented by small cortical bone fragments. 
No grave goods were immediately associated with the skull pairs or postcrania, but two semi­complete vessels and a small cache of deer antlers that had bits of green coloring on them were found on the same level as the skull rows. Additionally, ceremonial refuse containing shell, animal bones, and evidence of burning was found to the west of the structure (Romero 2004:24-25). The refuse was separated from skulls 3 and 4 by a tamped floor that was roughly at the same level as the plaza floor to the east of Structure 2023 . 
The remains were interred in two events corre­sponding to architectural components. During the

first event, skulls 3, 4, 5, and 6 and the postcrania were interred below the most recent plaza floor, over an older floor. The second event involved depositing skulls 1 and 2 in the altar and the skull rows in the platform of the building. The first and second skulls had large limestones placed on each of them. The skulls in rows were placed in the plat­form to the east of the western altar, which is shown in Figures 4 and 7. 
The current study considers demography, cul­tural modification, taphonomy (including mortu­ary processing), and biological distance in order to understand the deposits. I inventoried and scored the remains as outlined in Buikstra and Ubelaker (1994), collected data on nonmetric dental traits (Turner et al. 1991), and looked for rare dental traits that might reflect kinship among a subset of the individuals. Researchers have focused on intr­asite and intracemetery analyses in central Mex­ico (Spence 1974) as well as the Maya area (Jacobi 2000; Rhoads 2002). Their efforts have primarily focused on whether or not biological differences correspond to mortuary treatment. Authors have considered kinship among individuals buried in

tombs in the Maya area (Hammond et al. 1975) and victims of sacrifice in other regions (Sutter and Verano 2007). Given the widespread interest in the use of skulls in ancient Mesoamerica (see above) it is surprising that biological distance has only been considered in skull deposits twice (Ugalde Morales and Pompa Padilla 2003; Whittington 1999). 
Methods 
Age at death for the postcrania was assessed with epiphyseal closure and pubic symphyseal mor­phology (Buikstra and Ubelaker 1994). I based age at death assessments for the skulls on three steps, using dental eruption, skull suture closure, and dental wear. Dental eruption was used when­ever possible. Suture closure was used to place the skulls in general categories of young (20-34 years), middle (35-49 years), or older adulthood (50+ years). Given the absence of a comparative sample to develop a population-specific baseline for dental wear (Miles 2001), I used the left mandibular first molar's wear score to serve as the in di vi dual' s wear score, or the right if the left was not available, and ranked the individuals within the sample. This stepwise method of age assessment is conservative but appropriate given that both cra­nial suture closure and dental wear have wide con­fidence intervals (Santini et al . 1990). Sex was assessed for adults on the basis of anthroposcopic traits of the skull and os coxae (Buikstra and Ube­laker 1994). Given the increasing masculinization of skulls as an individual ages (Walker 1995), sex is not reported for adolescents. 
Cranial and dental modification were identified in situ and through examination in the laboratory (Buikstra and Ubelaker 1994; Romero 1970) . I examined the bones for taphonomic influences, including animal gnawing (Haglund 1997a, l 997b), weathering (Lyman and Fox 1997), and signatures reflecting mortuary treatment, process­ing, or trauma. These include examination for heat modification, grinding, presence of cutmarks, chopmarks, and random striae. Cutmarks are lin­ear marks with a v-shaped cross section (White 1992). Chopmarks are distinguished from cutmarks on the basis of the former having some evidence of perpendicular force having been applied to the bone. There is no one sign that positively identi­fies chopmarks but they typically produce small depression fractures, and chattering (small chipping of cortical bone associated with trauma [Humphrey and Hutchinson 2001]), and they are wider than cut­marks (greater than 1 mm wide [ Andrushko et al . 2005; Tung 2008]). Random striae are subparallel scratches that can result from multiple causes such as trampling, are shallower in cross section than cut­marks, and are not v-shaped (Blasco et al. 2007). Remains were observed for evidence of pre-or per­imortem trauma. The former is defined by the pres­ence of healing; the latter is identified on the basis of depression or spiral fractures, or peeling (flake fractures [Marshall 1989]). Postmortem fragmen­tation was not recorded separately, due to its ubiq­uity. When any of these signatures of cultural modification, trauma, or mortuary processing were identified they were confirmed with a !Ox lens . In order to be scored for quantitative assessment of these factors, 75 percent of an element had to be observable (a score of 1 as outlined in Buikstra and Ubelaker 1994). Very few of the flat bones or bones of the skull were preserved at this level, preclud­ing their comparative quantitative analysis. How­ever the long bones were sufficiently preserved to allow for quantitative analysis of cutmarks. 
The final line of evidence I consider in this paper is biological distance. Specifically, I compared vari­ability in nonmetric dental traits between individ­uals in the skull rows and pairs, and between individuals interred in the first and second episodes of deposition. A total of 61 traits from the Arizona State University Dental Anthropology System (ASUDAS; [Turner et al. 1991]), as well as the presence of rare traits related to dental number (hyperdontia and hypodontia) , reduction, and anomalous union (e.g., concrescence [Alt and Tiirp 1998]), were observed on 17 individuals,five from skull pairs and 12 from rows. The individuals in the skull rows were examined twice to test for intraobserver error. Any traits that had an error of one grade in more than 20 percent of the compar­isons or any errors of more than one grade were removed. I removed other traits on the basis of low variability or because more than two data points were missing. All traits were scored as described by Turner and colleagues (1991), with the maxi­mum score per individual recorded. Kendall's tau was calculated to identify correlations among traits below a .05 significance level. The remaining vari-

ables were dichotomized (see below for break points) and analyzed with Jaccard coefficients, sim­ilar to Spence's (1974) study of intrasite frequen­cies of traits at Teotihuacan. Jaccard coefficients score the number of times individuals share a score relative to the potential number of similar scores. Absence of a score for both individuals is not recorded. In his study, Spence calculated the Tri­angular Cumulative Similarity (TCS) to describe within-group variability and the Square Cumula­tive Similarity (SCS) to describe between-group similarity (Spence, 1974). The Ixhi sample was partitioned into pairs versus rows, and first versus second events of deposition. Thus a TCS was cal­culated for the individuals buried within the pairs, the rows, and the respective burial episodes. The SCS compared the similarity between those buried in pairs and rows, and those buried in the different episodes of deposition, respectively. Higher TCS scores relative to the SCS scores or the overall Jac­card coefficient suggest that there is greater simi­larity among the subsets than between group or whole group comparisons, which would be consis­tent with phenotypically similar individuals receiv­ing similar burials. Finally the likelihood that rare traits were found in multiple individuals was tested to identify smaller sets of related individuals. 
Results 

Number of Individuals and Demography 
Twenty-one skulls and four postcrania were found in the rows (Table 1). The looter's trench inter­sected with skulls 10 and 11, which were only rep­resented by small cortical fragments of the cranial vault. Ultimately they could not be demonstrated to be separate skulls on the basis of element redun­dancy. Only in situ observations could be made on skull 3, though it was clearly a separate individ­ual. Additionally the path of the looter's trench makes it likely that at least two other skulls were destroyed when the trench was dug (to the east of skull 13). Thus the osteologically demonstrable minimum number of individuals is 19, though cer­tainly two and likely four more individuals were originally interred. 
Sixteen skulls had at least one cervical vertebra in articulation; only skulls 2, 15, 18, 10, and 11 lacked any vertebrae (and the latter two were destroyed by a looter's trench). Three skulls (3, 4, and 19) had one vertebra in articulation. Six skulls (5, 8, 14, 16, 17, and 21) had two vertebrae in artic­ulation. The remaining skulls had three articulated vertebrae. Attempts to individuate the skulls with the postcrania on the basis of vertebral size and morphology were unsuccessful. 
Demographic information for the skulls is pre­sented in Table 1. The postcrania were all from late adolescent to young adult males (15-35 years). Suture closure suggested that the majority of the skulls were young adults. However the skulls that exhibited minimal to significant closure of sutures were scored as young adult to middle adult. I mod­ified the other skulls' age ranges to reflect wear rel­ative to these individuals. The dental wear corresponds well to dental eruption, with the ado­lescents having the least amount of wear. Chi­square tests considering whether or not individuals were placed in pairs or rows or in the first or sec­ond episode of deposition on the basis of age (ado­lescents and young adults versus potential middle age adults) were not significant (pairs versus rows x2 with Yates correction= .082,df= 1; ns,p = .775; first and second episodes of deposition x2 with Yates correction= .114, df = 1; ns,p = .736). 
Cultural Modification 
Cranial modification was clearly present in two skulls, though it should be noted that poor preser­vation likely hindered observation in other cases . Skulls number 2 and number 5 (both in skull pairs) exhibited fronto-occipital modification. Dental modification was found in one individual (skull 13). The maxillary right and left central and lateral incisors were filed on the mesial and dis­tal corners of the occlusal edge (type 3-6 as described in Romero [ 1970]). The maxillary right and left canines were filed on the mesial edges only (type 2-4). 
Taphonomy 
Influence of the limestone context was ubiquitous, as was imprinting and fragmentation by roots, and both influenced observability of exterior surfaces. There was no evidence of weathering, heat modi­fication or random striae among the remains. Sim­ilarly there was no evidence of carnivore chewing, although rodent gnawing was evident on the left tibia from postcranium 4. None of the skulls exhib-

ited evidence of perimortem fractures or of cut­marks. This could have obscured some perimortem fractures or cutmarks; there is no reason to think that the skulls from Ixhi were subjected to any treat­ment analogous to that seen among the defleshed skulls at Colha in either skull deposit (Barrett and Scherer 2005) . Even though the remains from Structure 2011 at Colha were also highly frag­mented, numerous cutmarks were visible. 
The ribs and vertebrae of each of the postcrania were articulated and were thus neither dismem­bered nor defleshed. The limbs of the postcrania were largely disarticulated at the knees and elbows, with the exception of the left leg of postcranium 4 (see below). Postcranium 1 exhibited cutmarks on both the left and right clavicles (Table 2) . The cut­marks were found on the anterior aspect. The right clavicle exhibited an angled fracture associated with the cutmarks. Both would have been at or medial to the deltopectoral triangle. Postcranium 2 exhibited cutmarks on the right clavicle, left and right humeri, left ulna, left tibia, left fibula, left sec­ond rib, the right scapula, and two rib body frag­ments (Figure 8) . The right scapula exhibited cutmarks on its lateral border. The right clavicle exhibited cutmarks on the anterior medial aspect, similar to those from postcranium 1. The left humerus exhibited cutmarks on the lateral and pos­terior aspects of the lateral epicondyle. Cutmarks on the right humerus were found on and around the deltoid tuberosity. The left ulna exhibited cutmarks on the posterior distal aspect. The left tibia and fibula, respectively, exhibited cutmarks on the ante­rior and posterior border of the distal third of the diaphyses. Postcranium 3 exhibited cutmarks on the left clavicle, left ilium, right tibia and fibula. The left clavicle exhibited cutmarks similar to those found on postcrania 1 and 2 and was associated with an angled fracture and possible chattering (small chips of bone missing at the site of impact [Humphrey and Hutchinson 2001]) on the edges of the fracture that may reflect a chopping force. The cutmarks on the right tibia were found on the posterior and medial aspects the middle third of the diaphysis, the only cutmarks among the remains exclusively on the middle of a long bone. The right fibula exhibited cutmarks on the posterior aspect of the proximal third of the diaphysis. Postcranium 4 exhibited cutmarks on the left and right clavicles and the right femur. The left and right clavicles

exhibited cutmarks at the same location as the other postcrania. The femur exhibited cutmarks on the proximal third of the diaphysis. The left leg of post­crani um 4, however, was not dismembered, and remained articulated under the other bundled limb bones. With the exception of the cutmarks on the right tibia of postcranium 3, and the cutmarks asso­ciated with the deltoid tuberosity of postcranium 2, each of the cutmarks found on the appendicular skeleton were on the proximal or distal thirds of bones and associated with joints (Table 2). This indicates that the remains were dismembered, and that the assemblage does not reflect more complex processing such as defleshing. After dismember­ment, the long bones (and the scapulae which remained articulated with the humeri) were placed in bundles on the rib cages. 
Biodistance 
Intraobserver error was considered in terms of whether or not a trait was scored in only one ses­sion (6.29 percent); if traits were scored differently between the sessions but the discrepancy was one grade (1 1.2 percent) or greater than 1 grade (3.93 percent); or if any discrepancy appeared at all between sessions (20.3 percent). These percent­ages of error are consistent with those reported by Nichol and Turner (1986). After traits were omit­ted for the aforementioned reasons, a total of 10 traits remained. These are: P3 root number, the 
2

metacone and cusp 5 of M, cusp number, proto­stylid, and cusp 6 for M1 and M2, and supernu­merary teeth (see Turner et al. 1991 for scoring). A Kendall's tau analysis of the remaining traits found significant intercorrelation among cusp num­ber and cusp 6 for the M1, (tau = .529, p = .029) 
Scherer (2004: 120). Supernumerary teeth were scored as present or absent. 

The TCS score for the whole sample, rows, and. 
second deposition are similar and greater than the SCS scores (Table 3). This may reflect greaterphe­notypic similarity within groups. However, I sus­pect the trends seen here actually reflect the number of possible comparisons. The pair and first deposit TCS scores are lowest, with the smallest number of comparisons by far. The SCS scores are next, followed by the TCS for the whole sample, rows, and second deposition. Spence's analysis similarly resulted in more erratic scores when the sample sizes decreased (Table 4). 
Although the Jaccard coefficient provided no clear evidence that phenetic variability reflected mortuary burial placement and time, the presence of one rare trait among the skulls was significant. Three of the individuals exhibited supernumerary teeth. Skulls 1 and 7 (Figure 9) exhibited bilateral mandibular supernumerary premolars, while skull 16 exhibited a supernumerary premolar on the right side only. All supernumerary teeth were associated with or adjacent to the premolar field and are described in detail in Duncan (2009). 
There have been no studies of supernumerary teeth in Mesoamerica, but they have been reported in other biodistance studies (Table 5). There is no current reason to think that Mesoamerican, or specifically Maya populations, have elevated fre­quencies of hyperdontia, and thus clinical fre­quencies may serve as a proxy for generating

parameters to test the frequency among the Ixlu sample. 
Estimates for the frequency of supernumerary teeth in modern populations generally range from .1 % to 3.6% (Brook 1974; Hopcraft 1998; Liu 1995; Scheiner and Sampson 1997; see Duncan 2009 for review). Most often, multiple supernu­merary teeth are associated with pathological con­ditions, many of which are syndromes. Nonsyndromic hyperdontia is not uncommon but most cases are isolated teeth in the midline of the roof of the mouth (mesiodens). Hopcraft (1998) found 1.6-3.1 percent of individuals in a clinical context exhibited hyperdontia, but only 3-10 .9 per­cent of those individuals were premolars. These fre­quencies, taken together suggest a 1 in 625 chance of having supernumerary premolars . Resampling this scenario with these odds , which are conserva­tive because they do not take into account bilater­ality, produced only 17 occurrences out of 10,000 times, or .02 percent. This is statistically signifi­cant and indicates that at least three of the individ­uals were related to one another. 
Discussion 
Occupants of Ixlu 
One of the primary goals of Proyecto Maya Colo­nial was to identify the Kowoj and Itza in the archae­ological record. Ixlu was investigated because it fell within the Kowoj territory in 1697 (based on eth­nohistorical documents) and was originally thought to be a candidate forthe Kowoj capital, Saklamakhal (Rice et al. 1996). Subsequent research demon­strated that Ixlu lacked a Mayapan-style temple assemblage, which is considered to be a key diag­nostic feature of Kowoj occupation in the lakes region (Pugh 2003). The same research also found that another site, Zacpeten, was a key ceremonial and political center for the Kowoj during the Late Postclassic (Pugh 2003). This research suggested that the Kowoj likely established their presence ini-

tially in the eastern part of the lakes, at Topoxte and Zacpeten, and gradually spread west to control the northern shore of the lake by the time of conquest in 1697 (Jones 2009). Thus Ixlu likely was not con­trolled by the Kowoj in the Early Postclassic but fell within their territorial boundaries by the Late Postclassic and was clearly contested in the interim (Jones 2009:62). According to Cecil (2001), the ceramics associated with the skull pairs and rows were likely Early Postclassic, suggesting that the Kowoj did not create the deposits. This is consis­tent with the distribution of skull rows and pairs around the lakes. The use of skull pairs is only seen at one other site, Nojpeten (modern-day Flores) (Cowgill 1963). This skull pair was found during rescue excavations on Flores and has a limited description of context, but we know that the island was the ltza capital at the time of conquest in 1697 (Jones 1998). Skull rows were found at Macanche and Ix!U. Similarly, excavations recovered rows of skulls at Chichen Itza (Ruppert 1935), from which the Itza claimed heritage. Thus the absence of diag­nostic features for Kowoj occupation, the distribu­tion of the skull rows and pairs, and style of associated ceramics all suggest that some group other than the Kowoj were making them. It is dif­ficult to assess the degree of continuity around the lakes from the Terminal Classic to the Early Post­classic (Rice and Forsyth 2004:35), but there is rea­son to think that there is some continuity at Ixlu. The Itza are the most likely candidates, given that Nojpeten (Flores) was the Itza capital and that prior to Kowoj expansion to the west the Itza were the dominant social group around the lakes. However it cannot be ruled out that the area around Ixlu could have been controlled by either ltza allies or a group that was conquered by the Itza, such as the Yalain. 
Significance of the Deposits 
When compared with Tiesler's model (2007:23) the presence of articulated vertebrae, the presence of cutmarks at the long bone joints, and the absence of cutmarks on the shafts all suggest

decapitation and dismemberment. The absence of other markers of processing, such as burning, spi­ral fractures, or pot polish, indicate that there is no evidence for more complex processing such as defleshing or cannibalism. The evidence of Maya blue pigment in the fill of the building (Cecil 20 10), and the association of skulls and crossed long bone motifs , further support sacrifice as the most likely explanation. 
The fact that the individuals were interred as a part of construction episodes indicates that they were dedicatory in nature. This reflects three impor ­tant aspects of the Mesoamerican religious world­view: the embodiment of animating essences; the need to dedicate new constructions; and the cycli­cal nature of birth, death, and rebirth. Mesoamer­ican souls were fully embodied and animating essences that resided (among other places) in the head. Among the Maya, baah was the term that referred to the corporeal body and was specifically associated with the head (Houston et al. 2006: 60-68) . Baah was extended metaphorically in a number of ways but it is clear that baah and the head were used to represent individuals (Houston et al. 2006:60-68; Gillespie 2008: 130) . This par­alleled the Nahuatl concept of tanalli, an essence associated with destiny, that resided in the head (Furst 1995:63; L6pezAustin 1988:204). We know that the Maya regarded heads as "essential mani­festation[ s] of the body" (Houston et al. 2006:68) . By taking an enemy's head, one "absorbed the iden­tity of someone else" (Houston et al. 2006:72). More importantly, this animating essence of the head could be lost or manipulated. For the pre­Columbian Maya, children seemed to be at risk for losing animating essences through their heads (Duncan and Hofling 2011). Similarly, the images of heads were sufficiently potent that they could 
"continue to exert influence even after death" (Gillespie 2008: l 30). Among Nahuatl speakers, when children were born they were placed by a fire to strengthen their tanalli. If someone were to light something from that fire, they would diminish the essence of the child. Children who were dehydrated and exhibited a sunken fontanelle were regarded as having low tanalli. Twins were particularly dan­gerous because they shared the normal amount of tanalli and could siphon it off from others (Furst 1995: 100) . This relates to the second aspect-the need to animate new constructions. 
In Mesoamerica, things like caves, mountains, buildings, and some ceramics were spiritually potent, animated aspects of the landscape. How­ever buildings were not automatically animated when the equivalent of the last nail was in place. Numerous examples of animating ritual have been documented in the Maya area and indeed through­out Mesoamerica, but one of the best is found among contemporary Tzeltal Maya speakers in Tenejapa, Chiapas, Mexico (Stross 1998) . One of the final acts of construction is to bring the build­ing to life. This is done by killing a chicken and placing it under the floor, under the center roof beam of the new building. This highlights the final relevant aspect of the Mesoamerican religious worldview-the cyclical relationship between birth and death in which everything is engaged. Though the chicken dies, the death is followed by a rebirth of animating essences that enliven the building, completing its construction. Gillespie (2002) notes that newborns were actually considered to be rein­carnated ancestors among the ancient Maya, one of the reasons burials were placed in domestic houses. The skull rows, pairs, and postcrania in the temple reflect similar concerns. Both events of deposition were associated with phases of con­struction and the human remains were used to ded­icate them (Bloch 1992). 
The regenerative aspect of heads is highlighted in indigenous texts. In the Papal Vuh, the severed head of Hun Hunahpu, father of the hero twins, Hunahpu and Xbalanque, is placed in a calabash tree after which it spits into the hand of a woman (a daughter of one of the Lords of the Underworld), making her pregnant (Tedlock 1996) . Similarly, skulls and heads are explicitly associated with maize. Miller and Taube (1993:109) note that the Tonsured Maize God's head was depicted as an ear of corn in murals in Tlaxcala, Mexico and that he may have been an early prototype of Hun Hunahpu. Among Tzutujil Maya speakers , maize seeds are called "little skulls" or "interred ones" (Carlsen and Prechtel 1991) . The placement of skulls in rows may reflect a similarity between the skulls and maize rows in the minds of the actors. 
The location of Structure 2023 also informs on the performance that would have led to the creation of the deposits. Inomata (2006: 192-195) has shown that the manipulation of space was a vital compo­nent for framing public performances. The Post-

classic structures in the site clearly reflect an aware­ness of the built environment from the Terminal Classic period. The L-and C-shaped Postclassic buildings frame the boundaries of the main plaza, and other similar buildings were placed atop struc­tures from earlier periods elsewhere in the site (see Figure 2). Structure 2023 was the westernmost Postclassic building in the main plaza of the site. Its eastern staircase faced the large temple in the main plaza, as did the skulls. This was likely an appeal to identify with or at least connect to past glories of the site, which echoes Ringle and Bey's (2001) suggestion that areas for public performance were sometimes chosen due to their already exist­ing sacrality or at least their existing prominence. The recycling of stelae from a twin pyramid com­plex in Structure 2023 reflects similar concerns. 
Other aspects of performance and motivation behind the deposits are difficult to discern. The association of long bones and skulls may indicate that the dedication was calendrically based. Klein (2000) has shown that skulls and long bones are associated with Tzitzimime platforms, which are tied to the 52-year calendrical cycle (see above). This is ultimately difficult to test, but is consistent with the general dedicatory aspect of the deposits . Similarly, the visibility and persistence of the deposits in the minds of actors is impossible to ascertain. The presence of articulated vertebrae indicates that individuals' heads, not dry skulls, were being interred. The sacrifice and interment of the heads were likely public spectacles that would have focused in part on the experiencing of pain by the victims (lnomata 2006: 197-206; Houston et al.: 2006:37). Even though the remains were not physically visible, as Houston (2006: 141) notes, the Maya "had a deft means of displaying the invisi­ble and rendering it concrete" and it is reasonable to think that the burial did not fade from memory soon after interment for the participants or for the groups from which the victims were drawn. 
The Identity of the Victims 
The articulation and mortuary treatment also sug­gest that the remains represent warriors captured from the battlefield, individuals captured through raiding, or the conquest of the site of Ixhi. The pre­ponderance of males in the assemblage is similar to that seen at Dos Pilas, where the decapitated heads of adult males had been buried (Demarest et al. 
1997). Demarest et al. (1997) interpret the skulls as sacrificed warriors. This is the most likely scenario here as well, though knowing the demography does not necessarily favor either of the first two scenar­ios over the other. That said, the last scenario seems less likely. In contexts where conquest is considered to be a parsimonious explanation, such as at Colha in Belize (Barrett and Scherer 2005; Massey I 989) or La Coyotera in Oaxaca (Wilkinson 1997), signs of defeat (such as wholesale burning or abandon­ment) are evident. There are no signs of this at lxlu. 
It is difficult to know if the presence of cranial modification among the remains is significant or not. Only two individuals definitely exhibited it, but in the Maya area there is no single meaning attached to cranial modification (Tiesler I 998). In some areas in Mesoamerica, such as in Oaxaca (Marcus and Flannery 1996:105-106), there is a clear connection between cranial modification and social status. However in the Maya area, a number of other meanings are associated with cranial mod­ification , such as gender roles and aesthetics (Tiesler 1998). The relatedness among at least three of the individuals, though, is significant. Kinship was clearly a defining parameter of life around the lakes in the Postclassic, and lineage membership influenced polity boundaries, roles of rulership, and military leadership (Jones 1998:75-82). Addi­tionally it seems clear that in the Postclassic war­fare was not conducted by standing armies, but would have been manifested as systemic skir­mishing by raiding groups (Jones I 998). If these individuals were captured during raiding, it sug­gests that the group from which they were drawn was formed, at least in part, on the basis of kinship. 
In the Postclassic there was clearly a move to defendable locations (Rice and Rice 1985). Zacpeten, a major ritual and political center for the Kowoj , is a peninsular site with defensive structures at its connection to the mainland (Rice et al. 1998). Ixlu, on the other hand, is not as easily defendable, but would have been desirable due to its location between two lakes. Movement of goods from lake to lake would have been important and canals existed between the lakes, though it is unclear if they were operable during the Early Postclassic (Rice 1996). Ixlu was contested and ultimately changed hands from Itza to Kowoj territory by the time of conquest (Jones 2009:62). The capture and sacri­fice of the individuals for these deposits would have

fanned the flames of enmity among the groups con­testing the area throughout the Postclassic. 
The Ixlu deposits support the idea that many of the same themes that characterized the Northern Lowlands were present farther south. The use of sacrifice, the emphasis on heads and skulls, and the connection between skulls and long bones so preva­lent in the Northern Lowlands were themes that were present around the Peten lakes region as well. This bolsters previous work suggesting that Post­classic Mesoamerica was increasingly violent and that the emphasis on sacrifice and on decapitation in particular was becoming pan-Mesoamerican (Moser 1973:22). By employing biological dis­tance data, and considering aspects of performance within the deposits' larger political framework, this study has identified other themes that future stud­ies might consider, such as biological relatedness among the victims, and the invocation of past spaces in performances of ritual violence. It is worth noting that these approaches will not be equally use­ful for all nonfunerary deposits. Rare dental traits are, of course, scarce by definition, and their absence would have precluded making statements about the relatedness of the victims in this case. Similarly the rich ethnohistoric record of the lakes region allows for an above average contextualiza­tion of archaeology in terms of historically known variables. That said, by considering these and other themes future work can begin to consider whether or not there are local themes and trends (cultural or biological) among ,nonfunerary deposits throughout the Maya region.
