Following the introductory chapter, the second and third chapters describe the stratigraphy and chronology of the site, as well as the structures encountered.The author suggeststhe presenceoftwo dwellings (one oval and one orthogonal shaped) from twodifferent periods (one Saladoid/Troumassoid and one Suazoid) dug into the bedrock, as is common practiceinthe islands. 
Chapter 4 discusses 54 single primary, and one possibly double,burialsbelonging to thethree phases of occupation.Particular attentionispaidtofunerary practices,the morphologyof thegrave pits,the grave goods, the position and orientation of the buried individuals,and theirspatialdistribution.Theinterpre­tationiscorroborated with ethnohistorical information and burial data from other sites on nearby islands, underscoring thecomplex andvariedtreatmentof the dead in the Lesser Antilles. The author ends with a discussion of the pathologies encountered, such as dental caries(due to high consumption of manioc) and lesions of the bacterial disease Treponematosis. Cranial modi.cation, a common practice in the pre­colonial Caribbean usedtoexpresslocalandcollective identities, was also observed.

Chapter 7 describes the results of the analysis of the zooarchaeological materials recovered during the excavations in the 1980s. The data are highly fragmentary, without paleobotanical evidence or iso­topic analysis of human remains like those that are available for other sites on St. Lucia. Therefore, detailed comparative analyses of the strategies of exploitationofbiotic resources across timeand space withinthesameislandandbeyondit, are unrealizable. The author cautiously concludes that the subsistence of Pointe de Caille occupants was based on a mixed economy that includedcultivatedmaize and yucaand relatively abundant marine resources such as .sh and mollusks. 
Finally, chapter 8 summarizes the results. The strengthofthisvolume liesin themeticulous descrip­tion of the thorough analyses of the Point de Caille site and its rich materials and burial practices. This work should be further developed and made more widely available through follow-up articles. In this way,theresults couldbemorethoroughlyincorporated into a state-of-the-art, pan-Caribbean archaeological perspective that would contribute more amply to current debatesinthe region andbeyond.

Thiswonderfulvolume onlowlandMayaarchitectural orientations complements similar studies published overthepasttwodecadeson astronomical alignments in the civic and ceremonial architecture of the Gulf Coast, Oaxaca, and central Mexico. These studies, all involving Ivan Šprajc as either lead author or coauthor, represent a systematic investigation of site orientations in Mesoamerica. When they are consid­ered together, a pattern emerges featuring alignments to sunrise positions on thesolstices andsunrisedates marking a period of 260 days (or an approximation thereof) bracketing the agricultural season (February through October). This suggests a horizon calendar thatworks wellwith the 260-daydivination calendar shared throughout Mesoamerica. Actual alignments to the equinox are very rare, and those close to the equinoxes coordinate with the quarter days, marking halfway points between the solstices. Alignments also register subdivisions into 13-day and 20-day intervals, periods that areimportant in thedivination calendar.

employed,includingadiscussionof errorfactorsand why the researchers made measurements using sight lines on east-west and north-south trajectories along the building walls instead of choosing sight lines takenfromthe structure’sprincipal access point.They also note that ball courts were excluded from the study because they areusually surroundedbyhigher structures, making measurement of the alignments to horizon positions more problematic. The authors emphasize that their statistical analysis results in a greater methodological rigor than is commonly seen in studies published by other researchers. This certainly is the most comprehensive study of Maya orientations, but their method of statistical analysis emphasizes measurementofthebuildingwalls,rather than building to building alignments and sight lines within the buildings from windows and doors, the kinds of measurements often employed by other researchers. 
Chapter 3 expands the analysis with tables and graphs recording measurements and error factors. Table1ismostuseful, listingtheentiresetof271 struc­tures, thedates they wereconstructed, measurements for azimuth and declination, estimated error factors, and the solar dates implied by the alignments. The remaining tables group these structures in sets that show similar alignments, with sets that also relate to theextreme horizon positionsof the moon andVenus (Tables 3–5).Table2groups together16 solsticealign­ments, includingYaxnohcah GroupF,amiddlePre­classic construction. Histograms and graphs enhance chapter3,although manylack adequateexplanations of the x-axis. (For this data see a 2016 article coau­thoredbyŠprajcin JournalofArchaeological Science: Reports 9:191–202.)Theremainingtextinthis chapter studies groups of similar alignments, noting that the largest group (Group 1) has alignments to sunrise dates in early February and late October, marking a 260-day period. There is also a separate discussion of E-Group alignments, .rst measured at Uaxactun in astronomical orientations to the equinoxes and solstices that involve multiple buildings. Here the authorsdisagreewith .ndings publishedinthisjournal (Aveni et al., Latin American Antiquity 14:159–78), noting that the astronomical function for E-Groups is no greater than other buildings they measured, although theypoint out that theydid not measuresight lines from the western pyramid to structures on the eastern range,relying instead on theaxial orientations of individualbuildings (p. 85).

This chapteralsoconsidersthe symbolic aspectsof alignmentsto horizonextremes forVenus andthe moon,andprovidesananalysisofthe technical aspects of observation. Venus alignments have been widely discussed in the literature, but here there is an emphasis on horizon positions of the evening star relatedtothe agriculturalcycle.The lunaralignments ofa numberofMayastructures are also noteworthy.

Chapter5describesstructuresmeasuredat speci.c lowlandMayasites, discussing some sitesingreater detail than others.(ChichénItzáandTikalare covered mostthoroughly.)Hereitbecomesevident that some questions can be raised. At Chichén Itzá, the photo taken along the north wall of the Castillo is said to demonstrate an alignment to sunset on May 20, seemingtoinvalidatethe alignmentto thesolar zenith sunset (May 25 and July 20) described in my own studies, but a more detailed article by these two authors(Estudios de CulturaMaya 41:31–60) shows an alignment frominsidethe west doorwaythatmarks thedates May23 and July 21, or closetothe zenith dates(whichvaryby adayyearto year). This also demonstrates that the north wall is not at exactly the same angleasthe doorway. Onewondersif this could alsobethe caseinother structures.Asunset pictureon May7taken frominsidethewest doorwayoftheUpper Templeofthe Jaguars reinforces thedatederived from measurements of the north wall (17.518o azimuth, Table1),butFigure22 shows thesunis wellabove the horizon, positioned over a tree line that surely was not therein earlier times.Ialso hadthisproblem, resultinginamisleading photographofthe same view in my 1988 publications, cited here by the authors, buttheyfailto notethatIsubsequently corrected my interpretationofthisstructurein1999(Star Godsofthe Maya,p. 68).Otheroversightsare seenin thesection onYaxnohcah,where thereisonlyavery briefmention of theGroupFsolsticealignment listedinTable2,and it is not clear which structures were measured in that group.A map obtained fromanothersource suggests that thesolsticealignmentwouldhavetorun along the frontfaceofaplatformthatsupports theentireFidelia group.

are discussed further (returning to a brief treatment in chapter 3, pp. 67–68), and the authors note that this pattern is found in the Usumacinta and the northeast coast of Yucatan but not in Petén. They point out that regionalpatternsof orientations within the Maya area provide a possible key to cultural links. 
Asareviewer,itismyjobto assess thevolume as a whole, including .aws, but any discussion of shortcomings should not diminish theimportanceof this volume in the .eld of archaeoastronomy (a.k.a. cultural astronomy). Not only is it the most com­prehensive study of alignments in the Maya area, it also represents a great accomplishment involving manyyearsof.eldworktoground truthwhatisoften not evident in standard maps. And it is also com­mendablethatSánchez andŠprajchaveincorporated ethnographic data about the agricultural cycle into their analysis of the signi.cance of their statistical study of alignments. This book is a very important contribution to our understanding of site planning andthe calendrical periods embeddedinarchitectural orientations.

This book,in one sense, hasbeen longawaited, since the materials described in it were indeed excavated in 1912, and some were the subject of a seminal butnowlargelyforgottenpaperbyC.H. Mathewson published in 1915. I always remember this paper because onacontiguous pageof thejournalwas the announcement of the death of Henry Gwyn Jeffreys Moseley(23 November 1887–10 August 1915),the scientistwho made XRFanalysis possible. Thepaper was,in anothersense,rediscoveredafter theSecond World War, since practically no attention had been paid to it in the interim. Now, some 90 years later, this excellent monograph on the metallic antiquities of MachuPicchuhas appeared,completingthe story of this investigation. 
Some of the research work, carried out by R. B. Gordon, was clearly performed some time ago, since theauthor notes that themetallographicexaminations were recorded on a 3.5 × 4.5-inch Polaroid .lm; some were rephotographed between 2005 and 2007 employing a digital camera. In 1915, Mathewson had determined the elemental composition of 31 of the bronze objects, work augmented with EDAX data from 1981 to 1985, with additionalEPMAdata acquiredbetween 2004 and 2005, including data for silver-copper alloys that had not been investigated by Mathewson.An interestingaspectof theworkisthe .ne attention to detail. For example, between 2004 and 2005, severallaboratorysilver-copperalloys were fabricated that duplicated thecompositionaldatafor someof thesilveralloys fromMachuPicchu. Unusu­allyfora SouthAmerican context,thealloys usedto makethe tumis,tupus,awls,axes,chisels, limespoons, and so forth from Machu Picchu were all made of either silver-copperalloys, tinbronzes,ormetallic tin. Thereappearstobenoarsenical copperorarsenical bronze, nor gold or tumbaga alloys in the collection of excavated material. The decidedly prosaic nature of the metallic materials may be a consequence, as Burger andSalazar suggest,ofthe deceased members of theIncarulingand religious elite taking their more prestigious materials with them in burial elsewhere. Theabundanceof silver-copperalloypins showsthat this alloy was suf.ciently common that mostfamilies of artisans and retainers could own their own. The majorityofthesepins werefound with clothembedded in the encrusting corrosion, showing that they were wornwith clothingatburial.Itisapitythatno scienti.c work was carried out on the corrosion products them­selves,byDebye-Scherrerpower X-raydiffraction, for example, especially sinceanumberofinterestingcom­pounds areassociated with humanburialadjacencies.
