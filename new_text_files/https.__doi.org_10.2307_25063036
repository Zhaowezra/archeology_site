A recent study of Early Formative Mesoamerican pottery by instrumental neutron activation analysis ( INAA) yielded sur­prising results that prompted two critiques in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The INAA study indi­cated that the Olmec center of San Lorenza was a major exporter of carved-incised and white pottery and that little if any pottery made elsewhere was consumed at San Lorenza. The critiques purport to "overturn" the INAA study and demon­strate a more balanced exchange of pottery among Early Formative centers. However, the critiques rely on a series of mis­taken claims and misunderstandings that are addressed here. New petrographic data on a small sample of Early Formative pottery (Stoltman et al. 2005) are potentially useful, but they do not overturn INAA of nearly 1000 pottery samples and hun­dreds of raw material samples.

"sister culture" (Diehl 2004; Hammond 1988), which, because of their historical importance, merit some clarification. 
The Mexican artist and art historian Miguel Covarrubias (1942, 1957) first cast the Olmec in a generative role, suggesting that they created and inspired many aspects of Mesoamerican art and civilization: 
[The Olmec] introduced a cult of deities of the rain, of the sky, and of the earth, and with it a form of incipient theocracy by which they dominated a large population of peasant serfs, the peoples of the Pre-Classic cultures, a sys­tem that later prevailed all over Middle Amer­ica and replaced the simple communalistic system of small autonomous peasant villages [Covarrubias 1957:83]. 
Some modem researchers accept that the Gulf low­land Olmec participated asymmetrically in prestige relationships, but most do not consider the "mother culture" concept analytically useful. Researchers holding these views also acknowledge that the Olmec passed on a legacy, though they do not insist that the Olmec were the only ancestors of later Mesoamerican societies (Diehl 2004: 189). 
The importance of two-way interaction between Gulf lowland Olmec and groups in distant regions (Oaxaca) was first stressed in an important paper by Kent V. Flannery (1968). As elaborated more recently, the "sister-culture" (Hammond 1988) or primus inter pares view (Diehl and Coe 1996; Flan­nery and Marcus 2000) casts the Gulf lowland groups as roughly equivalent in sociopolitical com­plexity to their Early Formative neighbors (Flan­nery et al. 2005). This view denies San Lorenzo Olmec priority in the development and promotion of iconography associated with the distinctive Olmec art style. Instead, argue proponents of this view, an Olmec style, like other features of Early Formative Mesoamerican societies, arose out of competitive interaction among Early Formative groups (Flannery and Marcus 1994, 2000; Grove 
1989). As Flannery and Marcus (2000:33) stated, "[i]t is the adaptive autonomy and frequent com­petitive interaction of such chiefdoms that speed up evolution and eventually make useful tech­nologies and sociopolitical strategies available to all regions." 
Much of the evidence for interregional interac­tion of the San Lorenzo Olmec has come from styl­istic analysis. While the Olmec are known for mon­umental sculptures, such as the colossal stone heads of San Lorenzo, many portable objects, especially ceramic vessels and figurines, are labeled Olmec style without direct support for a connection with the Gulf lowlands (Blomster 2002; Grove 1989). In particular, three types of ceramic vessels recog­nized at San Lorenzo (Coe and Diehl 1980) appear at widespread sites in Early Formative Mesoamer­ica. These include Calzadas Carved, Limon Incised, and Xochiltepec White (along with a variant, Conejo Orange-on-White). Until recently, no robust data existed to determine if these ceramics were locally made or reflect some degree of Gulf low­land export. 
Instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA) at the University of Missouri Research Reactor (MURR) of944 Early Formative pottery sherds has shown that a surprisingly large portion of pottery with Olmec motifs found outside the Gulf lowland Olmec heartland was made at or near the center of San Lorenzo (Figure 1), while the amount of pot­tery that moved in the opposite direction or among non-Gulf lowland centers was so low that it was not detected, despite the large size of the analyzed sample (Neff and Glascock 2002). A synthesis of these data was published recently in a peer­reviewed journal, Science (Blomster et al. 2005). Confidence in the inferences about interregional exchange produced by the study is warranted by the size of the sample of analyzed pottery, the inclu­sion of numerous raw material analyses, and the marked elemental differences among the sampled regions. Nonetheless, two recent articles in Pro­ceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) allegedly refute the major findings of the study. We are pleased to see this research generate such interest and welcome this opportunity to dis­cuss the findings in more detail. 
Blomster et al. (2005) focused on presenting the evidence for directionality in the movement of Early Formative ceramics. The evidence consists of regional source attributions for 725 of the ana­lyzed Early Formative sherds (Table 1; Figures 2-5). Although the two critiques published in PNAS imply that a fairly radical pro-"mother culture" agenda drove the research, this was not the case. Obviously the pattern shown in Table 1 has impli­cations for understanding the nature of interaction

The second article, by Flannery et al. (2005), contains no new primary data but offers an alter­native statistical reanalysis of the MURR INAA data together with a broader condemnation of Blomster et al.'s (2005) views and those of others on the Olmec. Flannery et al. (2005) start from the premise that the results of the INAA study are "refuted by the petrographic thin-section analyses of Stoltman et al., ... [which] is only the latestto indi­cate that INAA has serious limitations in tracing individual sherds to their source" (Flannery et al. 2005:1 1219). Given this dim view of the useful­ness of INAA, it is worthwhile to point out that Spencer and Redmond are currently collaborating in a large INAA study of Late Formative Oaxaca pottery (Sherman et al. 2005), Redmond has used INAA of ceramics in the past (Redmond and Har­bottle 1983), and Sharer likewise has relied on INAA results in other projects (Bell et al. 2004: 134; Bishop et al. 1989; Sharer 2000). With such a wealth of experience using INAA in ceramic prove­nance investigations, the methodological misap­prehensions of Flannery et al. (2005) are puzzling. 
The contradictory findings of the petrographic and INAA studies deserve further exploration, and, in fact, Glascock has offered to analyze the petro­graphic samples by INAA at MURR expense. However, the errors and mischaracterizations of Stoltman et al. (2005) and Flannery et al. (2005) warrant a timely response regardless of the results of any future INAA study. Criticisms of INAA and the sampling design of the Olmec study are exag­gerated and/or misleading, both statistical re­analyses are erroneous, and Blomster et al.'s (2005) views about Early Formative exchange are dis­torted and caricatured. With respect to the Flannery et al. (2005) article, we argue that archaeology is best served by an honest exchange of ideas and is ill served by inappropriate rhetorical tactics. 
Before turning to issues raised by Stoltman et al. (2005) and Flannery et al. (2005) a brief expla­nation of the long list of authors' names attached to this article is warranted. Three of us (Blomster, Neff, and Glascock) were directly targeted by the authors of the PNAS articles. Beyond this, the other authors have varied expertise and concerns about issues raised by the PNAS articles. These include concerns about: distorted claims concerning weak­nesses of INAA (especially Glascock, Bishop, Blackman, Neff, and Joyce); superficial and mis­leading statistical analyses (especially Cowgill, Neff, Bishop, Blomster, Glascock, and Lipo); dis­tortion of arguments about cultural evolution in Formative Mesoamerica (especially Coe, Diehl, Stark, Cowgill, Blomster, Joyce, Winter, Neff, Houston); misconstrual of the relative merits and relationship between petrographic analysis and bulk elemental analysis (especially Blackman, Bishop, and Neff); and the nature of scientific debate (all coauthors).1 
Previous Petrographic Research 
Prior to the research reported in Blomster et al. (2005) and Neff and Glascock (2002) (as well as in preliminary versions [Blomster 1998; Herrera et al. 1999]), no objective method for examining the movement of Early Formative pottery had been systematically implemented. Stoltman et al. (2005: 112 L3) cite three previous mineralogical analyses that apparently anticipated their conclu­sion that pottery moved freely between highland sites and S:m Lorenzo. These earlier studies were exploratory. The earliest one, by Williams as part of Weaver's study of the Tlapacoya pottery in the Heye Foundation collection (Weaver 1967 :29-30), consisted of two thin sections from the same Monte Alban tripod support (exact period not specified, but obviously post-Early Formative) that were com­pared with one Tlapacoya gray ware sherd. Weaver does not indicate if the Tlapacoya sherd is from a carved vessel. Because the collection studied by Weaver ( 1967 :9) was "believed to have been exca­vated at Tlapacoya in 1962 by local huaqueros," who had already sold the whole vessels before the Heye Foundation acquired the materials she stud­ied, no context or temporal information is available. While the second study, by Lambert for Nieder­berger (cited in Flannery and Marcus 1994:262), also only examined two different vessels-one from Tlapacoya, one from Oaxaca (with somewhat ambiguous results [Flannery and Marcus 1994:262])--the study by William 0. Payne of eight sherds from San Lorenzo merits some detailed comment. Flannery's project member Nanette Pyne went through the collection of Calzadas Carved pottery excavated by Coe and Diehl (1980) at San Lorenzo, and "instantly" noted motifs that were stylistically "Oaxaca-like" (Flannery and Marcus 1994:263; Stoltman et al. 2005:1 1213); she

removed pieces of the eight sherds that appeared 
to be the most "Oaxaca-like." No sherds were 
included that seemed local to San Lorenzo, so it 

appears no reference collection was available for 
comparative purposes. 
Despite the ability of Pyne to "instantly" rec­ognize "Oaxaca-like" ceramics at San Lorenzo, Payne subsequently rejected one sherd (SL-B4-9­EC) on the grounds that it had "no apparent rela­tionship" to Oaxaca ceramics (Flannery and Marcus 1994:263). The other seven Pyne-Flannery samples ranged from being similar to Oaxaca gray wares ("could be of Oaxaca origin") to identical (Flannery and Marcus 1994:263). Testing these sherds by INAA would be imperative. Unfortu­nately, no record was left at the Peabody Museum at Yale University, where the collection is curated, of the sherds from which Pyne removed samples. In their discussion of this material, Flannery and Marcus (1994:263) have never published illustra­tions of the sherds, nor have they linked them with the extensive ceramic illustrations in the San Lorenzo site report (Coe and Diehl 1980). The iden­tification numbers provided by Stoltman et al. (2005) (several of which are invalid in the San Lorenzo numbering system) merely refer to the context in which the parent sherd was excavated. Thus, it is difficult to link these with the specific Calzadas Carved sherds in the Peabody Museum collection. This is especially problematic, as Payne's microscopic examination of these sherds has served as the hard evidence for highland export of vessels to San Lorenzo, and they were re-used by Stoltman in the current study. It is possible that three of the eight Pyne-Flannery samples are included in the Blomster et al. (2005) sample (and were determined to originate at San Lorenzo by INAA), but, unfortunately, existing records-and incomplete publication and illustration of these 
sherds by Pyne-Flannery-preclude certainty in this matter. 
The Samples Analyzed by INAA and Petrography 

Flannery et al. (2005: 11219) criticize the sampling design employed in the Olmec study, 2 alleging that "[i]t is hard to see this sample as anything but an attempt to make the bulk of San Lorenzo's pottery appear 'local' and to minimize the chances of find­ing foreign sherds misclassified as Calzadas Carved." The basis for this claim is the alleged overemphasis of local utilitarian sherds at San Lorenzo, in contrast to an alleged emphasis on sherds that looked like possible imports in the Basin of Mexico and Oaxaca samples. 
The misapprehension here has to do with the fact that the sampling design in the Olmec study, like many ceramic provenance studies, had two goals. One goal was to estimate the range of composi­tional variation in local ceramics for the various locations sampled. For Oaxaca, the Basin of Mex­ico, and Mazatan, the MURR database already included numerous raw material analyses as well as sherds representing multiple paste types and tex­tures (e.g., Nichols et al. [2002) for the Basin of Mexico; Neff [2002) and Neff and Glascock [2002] for Mazatan; Herrera et al. [1999) and Neff and Glascock [2002) for Oaxaca). Flannery et al. (2005) must have known this, because, for example, Neff and Glascock (2002:2-3, Figures I 0-1 1, Table 6), whom they cite, discuss the samples from the var­ious regions and use the raw material analyses to generate maps indicating specific production zones for the Tlapacoya and local Mazatan groups. 
Blomster et al.'s (2005: 1069) discussion of the highland samples was necessarily abbreviated for publication in Science, but details were provided in the supplementary on-line documentation (Blomster et al. 2005). In Oaxaca, the sample includes raw materials and pottery from modem pottery-making communities (Joyce et al. 2005). In addition, Blomster included approximately a dozen sherds from Etlatongo that either were undecorated or exhibit what appears to be local decoration (Blomster et al. 2005:Table S 1 ). Blom­ster's sample also included undecorated sherds from the Valley of Oaxaca sites San Jose Mogote and Hacienda Blanca. 
For San Lorenzo, the range of local ceramic compositional variation had yet to be evaluated, so the sample analyzed for the Olmec study included both local raw materials and a wide range of pastes that would permit reliable assessment of the range of ceramic compositions that could have been pro­duced from local ceramic resources. There was no deliberate attempt to slant the San Lorenzo sample in favor of local materials, just as there was no effort to "[ignore] the drab utilitarian wares" at the highland sites (Flannery et al. 2005 : I I 219).

Instead, in all regions, the goal was to understand the full range of what constitutes "local," so that imports and exports could be identified reliably. 
The second goal in the Olmec study was to eval­uate to what extent Early Formative pottery, espe­cially carved-incised and fine-white pottery, may have been transported among regions. Addressing this question, obviously, requires selective sam­pling of carved-incised and fine-white pottery. Flan­nery et al. (2005) suggest that this goal was not achieved at San Lorenzo, because although a rea­sonable number of Xochiltepec White sherds were sampled (19), only five "Calzadas Carved" sherds from that site were analyzed (Blomster et al. 2005:Table Sl). In fact, however, the initial 50 sam­ples submitted by Blomster ( 1998) included no "drab" utilitarian wares from San Lorenzo, and many were actually included because they bore a superficial resemblance to Oaxacan gray wares, and might have supported the model of Oaxacan export of pots to San Lorenzo (Blomster 1998, 2004). 
A careful evaluation of the San Lorenzo sam­ple reported in Blomster et al. (2005:Table S2 and S3) shows that it contains considerably more than the five Calzadas Carved sherds mentioned by Flan­nery et al. (2005). The ongoing project directed by Ann Cyphers (1996, 1997, 1999) at San Lorenzo is changing aspects of the ceramic typology used at the site, with Calzadas Carved and Limon Incised (the other major decorated Olmec export ware) being subsumed under the type "Tigrillo" (Symonds et al. 2002: Appendix II). The new clas­sification system was used in listing these carved/incised sherds in the ceramic type column in Tables S2 and S3, and little else was said about them in Blomster et al. (2005). There are, however, at least 11 additional Calzadas Carved sherds included in Blomster et al. (2005), all of which have a clear San Lorenzo origin as determined by INAA. In fact, five of these (SLN0376, SLN0377, SLN0420, SLN0438, and SLN0455) are explicitly listed as "Calzadas" in the "descrip/comments" column in Table S2, and in the "other description" column of Table S3 (Blomster et al. 2005). This more than triples the Calzadas Carved sample for a total of at least 16. Parenthetically, a sample of 69 sherds, many of them Calzadas Carved from Coe and Diehl's (1980) excavations is presently being analyzed at MURR. 
All samples are finite, and therefore none is per­fect. However, the large sample analyzed in the Olmec study (nearly 1,000 ceramics and 623 raw clays) is well designed to provide a reliable indi­cation of whether and approximately how much carved-incised and fine-white pottery may have been transported inter-regionally in Early Forma­tive Mesoamerica. In contrast, the petrographic sample of Stoltman et al. (2005: 11216) consisted of approximately 20 (the authors never provide a precise sample size), of which "about half ... had previously been singled out as possible trade pieces." As discussed in greater detail below, one can question provenance results based on such a small, carefully selected petrographic sample, and it certainly does not permit any assessment of the relative volume of interregional exchange. 
Statistical Issues 

Very early on in the course of developing archaeo­metric INAA, it became apparent that a rote approach to statistical analysis would produce mis­leading results. Somewhat akin to archaeological fieldwork, creation of reliable ceramic provenance data requires a multistage approach in which source-related groups are proposed, checked, and rechecked. Edward V. Sayre (1975) and Garman Harbottle (1976) recognized the special require­ments of provenance studies and began tailoring pattern-recognition and group-evaluation tech­niques so that they would yield reliable source­related compositional groups, while minimizing the chances of erroneously detecting exports where there were none. The basic approach adopted by Sayre and Harbottle has been elaborated and refined (Bishop and Neff 1989; Glascock 1992; Neff2002) and has been used successfully on numerous ceramic INAA projects at MURR and elsewhere (e.g., Glas.cock 2003; Glowacki and Neff 2002; Neff 1992). The Olmec INAA study is a textbook example of how this approach can yield clear, strong compositional patterns with unambiguous implications about interregional movement of goods. Conversely, the "re-analyses" of the MURR Olmec data by Stoltman et al. (2005) and Flannery et al. (2005) provide excellent illustrations of how far wrong one can go without fully understanding the underlying logic of the statistical technique and without considering whether the model implied by

the technique is appropriate for data at hand and the questions at issue. 
The basic goal in chemistry-based ceramic provenance determination is to delineate one or more source-related compositional groups. Such groups can be conceived as centers of mass in the multidimensional space defined by the fall set of elemental concentrations (e.g., Harbottle 1976). Archaeological context provides one useful piece of information about which analyzed specimens might be expected to group together. Additional information useful in forming initial groups may come from typology (e.g., carved-incised vs. fine white pottery in the present case) or from numeri­cal pattern recognition (e.g., cluster analysis, prin­cipal components analysis, factor analysis, or simple bivariate elemental-concentration plots). In any case, however, the initial groups represent hypotheses about subgroup structure in the data that must be tested by further analysis. They are the beginning of quantitative data analysis, not the end (Neff 2002). 
Sayre (1975) recognized that a generalization of the univariate z-score, known as Mahalanobis distance, could be used to test the make-up of com­positional groups on a case-by-case basis. This met­ric evaluates how "close" a specimen lies to the centroid of the various groups being tested, given the correlational properties ("shapes") of the dif­ferent groups. One important refinement of Sayre's basic approach is the ')ackknife," whereby speci­mens assigned to a particular group are removed from the group before calculating their own prob­abilities of membership. This is a conservative approach that eliminates the bias of the kind that would favor spurious support for preconceptions about group membership. 
Use of Mahalanobis distances, especially with the jackknife, usually identifies a subset of speci­mens that are so distant from all group centroids that they cannot be confidently assigned to any group. These specimens may be statistical outliers from one of the defined groups, they may represent divergent paste preparation practices or diagenetic anomalies (discussed further in the next section), or they may pertain to sources sampled so sparsely that they were not recognized as distinct groups. Forcing marginal specimens into the group to which they lie closest does not make that specimen any less marginal, and it broadens the group into 
which it is forced, thus blurring the discrimination 
between groups. As a result, standard practice at 
most laboratories that carry out archaeometric 
INAA is to err on the side of minimizing erroneous 
assignments, leaving marginal specimens unas­
signed. Note, however, that information about 
which group is the best assignment for a given 
specimen is nonetheless preserved in the probabil­
ities of group membership (e.g., Neff and Glascock 
2002:Tables 3-5). 
Specimens that do not fit the dominant typo­
logical characteristics of a compositional group are 
sometimes left unassigned as well. In the Olmec 
study, for instance, some nonwhite San Lorenzo 
sherds were left out of the San Lorenzo White group 
despite the fact that they exceeded 5 percent prob­
ability of membership in the group. As with the sta­
tistical outliers, this is a conservative approach that 
raises the bar for membership in a group while still 
preserving the information about which group is 
the best match for a given specimen given current 
data. 
Stoltman et al. (2005) and Flannery et al. (2005) 
point to the unassigned specimens in the Olmec 
study as a reservoir of possibly highland produced 
and traded ceramics, suggesting specifically that 
Blomster et al. (2005) missed evidence in the INAA 
data for highland imports to San Lorenzo. For 
instance, Stoltman et al. (2005: 11215) state, "no 
fewer than 48 sherds from San Lorenzo (any one 
of which could have been foreign) were listed as 
unassigned." In fact, all but 10 of the 48 sherds are 
best assigned to either the San Lorenzo or San 
Lorenzo White groups (Neff and Glascock 
2002:Table 5). The effect of including these 38 
unassigned specimens in the San Lorenzo groups 

(the best assignment statistically) would have been · 
to broaden those groups, thereby also inflating the probabilities that unassigned specimens from other sites would be assigned to San Lorenzo. In other words, forcing unassigned specimens into the group to which they lie closest, as Stoltman et al. (2005) would appear to favor, would have further accen­tuated the role of San Lorenzo as an exporter of pottery. The default assumption was that the cost of exporting ceramics with only human transport would have made interregional movement of ceramics infrequent, so the bar was deliberately set high for inferring interregional movement. If any­thing, however, this approach underestimates the

extent to which export of pottery from San Lorenzo was not balanced by a return flow of ceramics from other regions, a point made in Blomster et al. (2005:1070).

Mahalanobis distance-based probabilities for small groups are inflated to begin with, and even the high­est probabilities in this case fall outside of the 98 percent probability boundary for San Isidro. An inference of export of San Isidro ceramics to San Lorenzo thus would have to be advanced on very slim statistical evidence. Readers who may still think that Blomster et al. (2005) disguised poten­tial highland Mexican imports to San Lorenzo are invited to scan the long columns 0.000 percent probabilities listed under "Oaxaca" and "Tlapa­coya" in Table 5 of the original technical report (Neff and Glascock 2002). The same table shows that Mazatan and Tehuantepec similarly stand out as exceedingly unlikely sources for any of the unas­signed specimens from San Lorenzo. 
To reiterate, with only human transport, the default assumption should be that any given pot is 
. 
a local product, and the statistical bar for nonlocal status should be set high in order to minimize erro­neous inferences of interregional exchange. In the Olmec study, Blomster et al. (2005) setthe bar high for membership in all of the reference groups, and found that only the San Lorenzo group included any specimens found at sites outside of the inferred source region for the group. These specimens are unambiguously assignable to San Lorenzo; there is virtually no doubt that they were exported from Gulf lowland ceramic production centers during San Lorenzo's heyday. In contrast, not a single specimen found at San Lorenzo can be assigned to any source other than San Lorenzo, and no con­ceivable lowering of the bar admits any of the unas­signed San Lorenzo specimens to the Tlapacoya, Mazatan, Oaxaca, or Tehuantepec reference 
groups. 
How are the above inferences about the lop­
sided nature of Early Formative ceramic exchange 
to be reconciled with statistical re-analyses of 
MURR data by Stoltman et al. (2005) and Flan­
nery et al. (2005), which purportedly indicate mul­
tidirectional movement of Early Formative ceramics? The answer is that misapplication of packaged statistical procedures and limited under­standing of chemistry-based sourcing produced a result that was invalid, yet, it seems, compatible with the investigators' preconceptions. 

Stoltman et al. (2005) carried out a discriminant analysis in which the groups fed into the analysis were defined by archaeological context alone. As noted above, however, while archaeological context may be one good starting point for recognizing source-related groups, they are hypotheses to be tested, not the end of the analysis. In the Olmec study, the groups defined purely by archaeological context include a variety of suspected local and imported pottery. This is an artifact of the sampling design used in the INAA study (Blomster et al. 2005; Neff and Glascock 2002), the purpose of which was to evaluate the extent to which Early Formative ceramics may have been moved between regions. 
The fallacy of Stoltman et al.'s (2005) statisti­cal approach is exemplified by the conclusions drawn about Etlatongo, in the MixtecaAlta of Oax­aca. Stoltman et al. (2005:Tables 1 and 2) find, based on their discriminant analysis, that some­where around 50 percent of Etlatongo products were expmted to other sites, and they speculate that this result reflects either sampling bias or the importance of the Etlatongo region's claimed or "known" kaolinite sources. 3 Any familiarity of the PNAS authors with Etlatongo ceramics should have raised a red flag about the implausibility of this interpretation. At Etlatongo, Blomster selected sherds that appeared to represent several different types of locally made "cafe paste" (coarse and fine varieties), as well as possible imported ceramics, including carved-incised and fine-white pottery. Indeed, the results of the INAA discriminated at least two types of local cafe pastes, which match the visual inspection of these ceramics (Blomster 1998, 2004 ), together with two groups of imports, fine white and carved-incised. Stoltman et al. (2005) combine these four visually and composi­tionally distinct groups into a single "local Etla­tongo group." This heterogeneous amalgam subsumes so much compositional variation that a very broad range of analyzed pottery will now appear to qualify as "local Etlatongo" products. 
The effect oflumping all sherds from Etlatongo into a single group is illustrated in Figures 6 and 7. The structure Neff and Glascock (2002) identified

in the Etlatongo data, indicated by the smaller ellipses, comprises four groups, two found only at Etlatongo and two consisting of imports from the Gulf lowlands. The groups are clearly distinct on numerous projections of the data, including the two largest dimensions of variance (Figure 6). When the data are all lumped into a single group, as Stolt­man et al. (2005) did for their discriminant analy­sis, the range of variation of this "group" is magnified tremendously on all dimensions; iron, for instance (Figure 7) now varies over almost an order of magnitude. 

In a discriminant analysis, a highly variable group defined only by context of discovery that actually subsumes several compositionally distinct groups has a clear advantage in terms of how many of the cases will appear to be assignable to it. That is, when one assumes that everythingfound at site A was made at site A, the probability hyper­ellipsoid for site A is enlarged dramatically, to the point that sherds from sites B, C, etc. will begin to fall within it, even if they were not made at site A. More generally, by using only one criterion (con­text of discovery) to form groups, all hyper­ellipsoids are enlarged, and the overall ability to discriminate sources is degraded. 
By creating a heterogeneous "Etlatongo group" that combined at least four distinct groups, Stolt­man et al. (2005) forced their analysis to show that Etlatongo potters exported more pottery than was consumed locally, a peculiar conclusion that they then had to explain by reference to biased sampling or Etlatongo's desirable kaolinite clay sources. In fact, however, in the INAA sample (which delib­erately included likely imports) there is not a sin­gle pot that was exported from Etlatongo. Instead, the Etlatongo sample consists largely of imported pots made at production centers at or near the Gulf lowland Olmec center of San Lorenzo. 
Apparent "exports" from other sites identified by Stoltman et al. (2005:Tables l and 2) are due to similar though less extreme effects of increased group heterogeneity. The only region that did not export pottery according to the Stoltman et al. (2005) analysis, Mazatan, is so distinct in compo­sition (chromium concentrations about one-tenth of compositions found farther north in Mexico) that the local, low-chromium signature overwhelms theincreased heterogeneity due to inclusion of non­local (San Lorenzo) specimens in the group. 

Flannery et al. (2005) present a different reanaly­sis of the MURR data in which 184 "gray ware" . sherds from Tlapacoya, Etlatongo, Oaxaca, and San Lorenzo are subjected to a factor analysis. Fac­tor analysis is a useful pattern-recognition tech­nique that reduces the dimensionality of multivariate data and facilitates the recognition of potential subgroups, much like principal compo­nents analysis. As discussed previously, however, recognition of potential subgroups in the compo­sitional data is the beginning rather than the end of the analysis. Flannery et al. (2005) discuss a pro­jection of the data onto Factors 1 and 2, offering a highly impressionistic interpretation of what they accurately characterize as a "shotgun blast." Plots of this kind are used routinely during the very first stages of data analysis, when a broad understand­ing of possible subgroup structure is sought. For at least 35 years, however, users of INAA have rec­ognized that an initial exploration of subgroup structure is very far from the end of the story. It is naive indeed for Flannery and colleagues to claim that their impressionistic interpretation of a single two-dimensional factor-analysis plot represents a more valid understanding of structure in the Olmec data than that produced via painstaking, iterative application of pattern recognition and multivariate group refinement. 
Additional Methodological 
Misapprehensions 


Stoltman et al. (2005) and Flannery et al. (2005) repeat an old assertion about INAA being invalid for pottery because pots are not rocks but "human artifacts." In the critiques of the Olmec study, this assertion helps create a cloud of confusion within which the superiority of petrography can be asserted without demonstration. Insistence on the absolute superiority of either petrography or chem­istry is misguided, as sometimes superior geo­graphic resolution can be achieved with bulk elemental analysis and other times superior reso­lution is possible with petrography. Equally impor­tant, the fact that the two techniques usefully complement each other (Bishop and Rands 1980; Bishop et al. 1982; Montana et al. 2003; Rands and Bishop 1980) is lost in an argument about the supe­riority of one over the other. 
The basic complaint about INAA and other bulk 

Downloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core. YBP Library Services, on 22 Aug 2018 at 17:47:43, subject to the Cambridge Core terms of use, available at https://www.cambridge.org/core/terms. https://doi.org/10.2307/25063036 
chemical techniques is that they yield a chemical profile that, in the words of Stoltman et al. (2005: 11214 ), "derive[ s] from at least five sources: 
(i) the clay, (ii) any added aplastics (temper), (iii) the water used to moisten the clay, which may con­tain such soluble elements as sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, or iron, (iv) any substance stored, cooked, or transported in the pot, and (v) diagenesis, the absorption of chemicals from the soil in which the sherds have lain buried for mil­lennia." All of these effects have been recognized and discussed by proponents of chemistry-based sourcing, beginning with the very earliest applica­tions of INAA to ceramic source determination (Sayre and Dodson 1957; also see Bishop et al. 1982 and Neff et al. 2003), but they are raised in this context as if users of INAA habitually over­look them. These effects have also been examined in ethnographic contexts, where technology is known and the relationship between paste prepa­ration and bulk elemental profiles can be evaluated directly (Arnold et al. 1991, 1999, 2000). 
In principle, technology, use, and diagenesis might affect patterning in bulk elemental data in two distinct ways. One possible effect is to create compositional differences where none existed between the raw clay sources. This appears to be what Flannery et al. (2005: 11220-11221) have in mind when they assert that "[ o ]ne cannot rule out the possibility that some of the most critical ele­ments entered the sherds later, through diagenesis." In most INAA studies (including those undertaken at MURR) investigators implicitly or explicitly evaluate multiple working hypotheses about iden­tified subgroups (Neff et al. 2003). If, for example, elevated calcium and strontium (two of the soluble elements Flannery et al. [2005] worry about) are discriminators of one group from another, viable a priori hypotheses about this data structure would include: (1) the groups represent clay-source dif­ferences; (2) the groups are produced by temper­ing, e.g., addition of limestone or shell temper; (3) the group with elevated calcium and strontium reflects use of some of the vessels for preparing com meal (a scenario suggested by Stoltman et al. [2005:11214]), or (4) the groups represent some combination of all of these effects. 
Multiple hypotheses about structure in bulk ceramic compositional data can be evaluated by several means (e.g., Bishop et al. 1982; Kosakowsky et al. 1999; Neff et al. 1999; Neff et al. 2003; Neff and Sheets 2005; Rautman et al. 1999), including electron microprobe, laser ablation-ICP-mass spectrometry, and petrographic analysis (hence the complementary relationship of petrography and chemistry mentioned above). Although extended discussion of these methods is beyond the scope of the present paper (but see below for a discussion of petrographic analysis), one principle is relevant in light of Flannery et al.' s (2005) contention that diagenesis may be creating patterning in the Olmec data: if ceramic composi­tional groups can be linked directly to sampled raw materials, such a finding favors rejection of both ancient use practices and diagenesis as causes of group discrimination. In the case of the Olmec study, the ceramic groups attributed to San Lorenzo, Mazatan, Oaxaca, and Tlapacoya are all linked directly to geographic source locations by the fact that raw material samples from those locations fall within the range of variation of the ceramic refer­ence groups. Thus, any post-manufacture effect on the compositional profiles of Olmec sherds is insuf­ficient to obscure the relation of the ceramics to source raw materials. 
Two other considerations further strengthen the inference that regional Olmec reference groups reflect raw-material differences. First, the groups are discriminated by many elements, including transition metals, rare-earth elements, and other immobile elements, and no stretch of the imagina­tion could concoct a series of use or diagenetic effects that would create such profound composi­tional differences. Second, the mere fact that mul­tiple compositional groups are found in multiple archaeological contexts (i.e., the local groups together with the San Lorenzo and San Lorenzo White groups) is inconsistent with Flannery et al.'s (2005) suggestion that differential diagenesis (a local effect of the burial environment) is responsi­ble for the structure in the Olmec ceramic data. 
The other possible effect of technology, use, and diagenesis is to increase the compositional varia­tion of ceramics to the extent that differences between clay sources are obscured. Although experiments by Neff et al. ( 1988, 1989) have shown that the probability of such an effect is much smaller than intuition might suggest, the conservative approach to group assignment discussed in the pre­vious section in any case guards against erroneous

assignments when groups overlap at their edges. In the case of the reference groups defined in the Olmec study, the elemental differences are large and multivariate (see illustrations in Neff and Glas­cock 2002 and Blomster et al. 2005), so no matter how much broadening of the groups might have occurred due to technology, use, or diagenesis, such effects clearly have not obscured the interregional differences. 
The fact that bulk ceramic compositional pro­files reflect technology, use, and diagenesis as well as clay source differences should not be overlooked, and in fact is not overlooked in INAA studies. Such effects may attenuate geographical resolution and play a role in creating statistical outliers (some of the "unassigned" specimens) in the Olmec study. Further, the natural environment also imposes lim­its on geographical resolution. No measuring instrument is infinitely precise, and scientific rigor demands that the limitations of one's measuring instruments be assessed carefully and comprehen­sively. This dictum applies as much to petrographic analysis as it does to chemical analysis, a point to which we return below. 
Recognition of the need to assess the limits that the natural environment imposes on geographical resolution of INAA prompted discussion of the sur­prising similarity of some Late Formative Oaxa­can gray ware (Gris-I) to compositions characteristic of the San Lorenzo region (Neff and Glascock 2002). Stoltman et al. (2005) and Flan­nery et al. (2005) seize on this discussion as an Achilles Heel in the Olmec study, Stoltman et al. (2005: 11214) stating, for instance, "[n]owhere are the limitations of INAA more evident than in Neff and Glascock's ... acknowledgment [of the overlap of Oaxacan Late Formative and San Lorenzo com­positions]." 
To repeat, we believe that careful assessment of the precision of one's measuring instruments is part of good science. However, because Stoltman et al. (2005) and Flannery et al. (2005) insinuate that this discussion exposes a fatal flaw in the Olmec study, some significant details not mentioned by them deserve reiteration. First, although there is surpris­ing overlap of the Late Formative Oaxaca Gris-I and San Lorenzo groups on many projections of the data, there is, in fact, a clear multivariate sep­aration, which can be illustrated by a canonical dis­criminant analysis (Figure 8). Second, the attenuation of geographical resolution involves only Late Formative Oaxacan gray wares: as shown in Figure 8, the major axis of discrimination derived from the canonical discriminant analysis unam­biguously separates Early Formative Oaxacan gray pottery from San Lorenzo. The unambiguous dis­crimination of San Lorenzo from Early Formative Oaxaca was demonstrated previously by the com­parison of the two groups using Mahalanobis dis­tances (Neff and Glascock 2002: Table 2). The important point here is that the chance that Early Formative ceramics included in our San Lorenzo group were actually made in Oaxaca is much more remote than might be suggested by the surprising similarity of Late Formative gray pottery to San Lorenzo compositions. 
Publication of Raw Data 
Stoltman et al. (2005) and Flannery et al. (2005) also imply that there is something suspicious about Blomster et al.'s (2005) use of the Late Formative Oaxacan gray ware reference collection. For instance, Stoltman et al. (2005: 11215) complain that "[a]lso mentioned is a 'reference collection,' but no details, counts, or chemical elements for this collection are given." In other words, although Blomster et al. (2005) published over 1,000 raw data generated by the Olmec project, they are faulted for failure to publish the Late Formative data (which were generated in separate projects whose results were still being analyzed [Joyce et al. 2005]). MURR's record of publishing raw data (over 5,000 raw INAA data publicly available at University of Missouri 2002-2005) speaks for itself on this issue and sets a standard for documentation met by few if any other archaeometry labs. In comparison, Stoltman et al. (2005) show a total of 10 photomi­crographs and never specify their exact sample size. 
The Stoltman et al. Petrographic Study 
The fact that Stoltman's petrographic study yielded results apparently at odds with the results of INAA of nearly 1,000 ceramics and several hundred raw material samples deserves further exploration. Even a large sample such as the Blomster et al. (2005) Olmec sample may miss low-frequency composi­tional groups. It is possible, for instance, that Stolt­man et al. (2005) are correct in their identification

of several "Leandro Gray" sherds found at San Lorenzo as Oaxacan imports. While gray sherds were included in the San Lorenzo collection ana­lyzed by INAA, "Leandro Gray" was a type cre­ated for Oaxaca Valley pottery (Flannery and Marcus 1994 ), and the category was not used in the sorting of San Lorenzo collections sampled for the INAA study. The San Lorenzo sherds meeting the criteria for this type analyzed by Stoltman et al. (2005) have not yet been made available for analy­sis.4 Glascock's offer to analyze Stoltman's sam­ples at MURR expense is an expression of our desire to explore this possibility further. The major­ity of Leandro Gray specimens analyzed from Oax­aca were assigned to the Oaxaca reference group by INAA (Neff and Glascock 2002:Table 1 ), so we would not be too surprised if examples identified as the same type from the Gulf lowlands proved to be Oaxaca imports. Such a finding would not change the lopsided ceramic circulation pattern for fine white vessels or those with Olmec-style motifs revealed by our INAA results, however. 
At the moment, the absence of a secure inter­section between the INAA and petrographic sam­ples precludes definitive analysis of the reasons for the contradictory findings. IfINAA and petrogra­phy were to yield contradictory results for the same sherds, we would argue that neither result deserves to be dismissed automatically, as Stoltman et al. (2005:11213) seem to advocate. INAA and pet­rography are both instruments for monitoring source location, and both have inherent limitations on their resolution. We have already discussed the natural and technological effects that limit the res­olution achievable with bulk elemental approaches to ceramic source determination. We tum now to a brief consideration of the methods of petrography­based ceramic provenance research and of limita­tions in the research design of Stoltman et al. (2005). 
The principle underlying both the bulk-chemical approach and the petrographic approach to ceramic source determination is called the "provenance pos­tulate" (Weigand et al. 1977). The provenance pos­tulate specifies that between-source differences must exceed within-source variation in order for source-discrimination to be possible. The raw mea­surements may be either elemental or mineralogi­cal, and in either case variability may be assessed in either qualitative or quantitative terms (Neff 2000). The Olmec INAA project employed quan­titative elemental measurements, whereas Stolt-

man et al.'s (2005) petrographic study employed qualitative mineralogical measurements. Even if one accepts Stoltman et al.'s (2005) assertion that petrographic data are inherently superior for ceramic provenance determination, any petrography-based attribution of provenance still depends on characterizing both the range of petro­graphic variation within regions (qualitative vari­ation in this case) and the differences between regions. 
The methods used to assess intra-and inter­regional elemental variation in ceramics are dis­cussed in previous sections and need not be repeated here. Secure attribution of provenance in petrographic studies demands similarly explicit consideration of the range of mineralogical varia­tion within and between regions, including, ideally, sampling and analysis of raw materials. The petrography-based ceramic provenance research of Heidke, Miksa, and their collaborators in the Southwest, for instance, relies on extensive sam­pling of sands in order to develop petrofacies mod­els of the distributions of sand compositions within drainage basins (e.g., Heidke et al. 2002). 
The identification by Stoltman et al. (2005) of highland imports at San Lorenzo directly contra­dicts the findings of the INAA study and consti­tutes a crucial piece of their argument for multidirectional movement of Early Formative ceramics. From a methodological perspective, it would therefore seem critically important to char­acterize the range of qualitative petrographic vari­ation expected in San Lorenzo area ceramics, so that ceramics falling outside that range (imports) could be unambiguously identified. Stoltman et al. (2005:1 1216) analyzed a single presumed local San Lorenzo ceramic (Perdida Black-and-White) specimen, which turned out to be tempered with fine calcareous sand. They do not specify from which project-and from what context-this sam­ple originated, nor why they believe it to be local (Stoltman et al. 2005: 11216). They did not sample raw materials (in contrast to the INAA study, which included 123 raw clay samples from the vicinity of San Lorenzo). Stoltman et al. (2005) are therefore incautious to claim that their lone thin section from San Lorenzo provides a basis for identifying imports to the Gulf lowlands. 
San Lorenzo is surrounded by Quaternary allu­vium that derives from Tertiary and Mesozoic lime­stones as well as recent volcanic rocks of the Tuxt­las Mountains. In addition, the Rfo Coatzacoalcos drains across much older metamorphic rocks. For Stoltman et al. (2005) to assert, based on a single thin section of a presumed local ceramic sample, that San Lorenzo ceramics are characterized by only one kind of tempering material (calcareous sand) is unwarranted. Volcanic glass shards would be expectable in alluvium derived partially from the Tuxtlas Mountains, and alluvium of the Rio Coatza­coalcos might be expected to contain weathering products from a variety of rocks, including Paleo­zoic metamorphics. Stoltman et al. themselves mention at least one other class of San Lorenzo area temper, "quartzitic sand," or "fine quartz sand," identified in an earlier study by Payne and consid­ered a marker of Xochiltepec White produced in the San Lorenzo area (Stoltman et al. 2005: 11213 and 11217). 5 

Stoltman et al. (2005) analyzed more than one presumed-local thin section from Oaxaca, but they inadequately assess the range of mineralogical vari­ation likely to be found in Oaxaca Valley ceram­ics. The seven thin sections from presumed-local sherds were restricted to a single paste type char­acteristic of Early Formative gray ware made in the northern arm of the valley, in the vicinity of Monte Alban and San Jose Mogote. These seven thin sec­tions all had gneiss-derived grit temper plus vol­canic glass shards inferred to be natural inclusions in the clay. The gneiss is associated with meta­morphic rocks at the edges of the Oaxaca alluvium, while the glass shards presumably are derived from Miocene volcanics. As Payne (1994) has docu­mented, however, ceramic raw materials in the Oax­aca Valley also include sedimentary clays derived from weathering of a variety of rocks that surround the valley, notably including Mezozoic limestones. At one time, Flannery and Marcus themselves rec­ognized the importance of characterizing the range of mineralogical variation in the Oaxaca Valley, as indicated by their statement that "not all Delfina Fine Gray vessels were made from the same clay body, since different parts of the valley [of Oax­aca] had different parent geological materials" (Flannery and Marcus 1994:262). Because Stolt­man et al. (2005) did not document how the dif­ferent geological environments of the valley are expressed in ceramic thin sections, they have pro­vided an inadequate basis for petrographic identi-

fication of Oaxaca exports to other regions, such as the Gulf lowlands. 

The importance of establishing reliable baseline information about the range of natural and added non-plastics that might be found in pottery from the various potential source regions is highlighted by one additional example. Two Delfina Fine Gray sherds from San Jose Mogote and one Calzadas Carved sherd from San Lorenzo were found by Stoltman et al. (2005) to have very similar pastes characterized by fine-grained polycrystalline quartz. While Stoltman et al. (2005: 11216) suggest that the three sherds derive from an unknown high­land source, neither Oaxaca nor San Lorenzo can be ruled out as potential sources because the range of mineralogical variation in these regions has not been characterized. Fine-grained quartz is a common-enough constituent of alluvial sediments that it might be consistent with either region. The INAA study placed most sherds identified as Del­fina Fine Gray and Calzadas Carved in the San Lorenzo reference group (Blomster et al. 2005 : Table S3; Neff and Glascock 2002: Table 1), so it is most likely that these three fine-grained quartz­tempered sherds are not from an unknown high­land source but rather from the vicinity of San Lorenzo. "Fine quartzite sand" has been an accepted marker of San Lorenzo Calzadas Carved for some time (Coe and Diehl's 1980: 16; Flannery and Marcus 1994:263; 2000:28), and, as noted above, Stoltman et al. (2005: 11213, 11217) men­tion "quartzitic sand" and "fine quartz sand" as diagnostic of San Lorenzo. 
The fact that fine-grained quartz is so common in sediments renders its value as an indicator of source highly questionable. 6 Delfina Fine Gray and Calzadas Carved therefore may be an instance in which the geographic resolution of petrography­based ceramic provenance determination is very coarse in comparison to INAA, which unambigu­ously assigns most examples of these types to San Lorenzo (Blomster et al. 2005: Table S3 ). As noted before, however, an absolute insistence on the supe­riority of either petrography or chemistry is mis­guided; petrographic studies pursued with adequate geologic and archaeological sampling would cer­tainly advance our understanding of Early Forma­tive ceramic circulation, particularly if pursued in a collaborative framework that also included bulk elemental analysis. 
Belief in the absolute superiority of petrogra­phy leads Stoltman et al. (2005: 11214) to the asser­tion that results of petrography can "overturn" results of INAA. Their case in point is a study of pottery from Pinson Mounds, Tennessee. In the Pinson Mounds study, Stoltman and Mainfort (2002) purport to show that sherds believed on styl­istic grounds to be imports but identified as local by INAA (Mainfort et al. 1997) are in fact imports (thus "overturning" the INAA study). The 11 styl­istically nonlocal sherds were all sand tempered (Stoltman and Mainfort 2002: Table 3), like local Pinson pottery. However, Stoltman and Mainfort used point counts to measure the relative propor­tions of sand, silt, and matrix, and identified as non­local anything with a texture statistically different from most Pinson pottery (i.e., more than two stan­dard deviations above or below the silt, sand, or matrix mean). A total of three of the 11 potential imports showed statistically aberrant textures, which would seem slim evidence on which to base an inference of importation from as far away as southwestern Georgia. Stoltman and Mainfort, however, ask archaeologists to believe that char­acterization of ceramic paste texture is more sen­sitive to provenance differences than quantitative measurement of 33 major, minor, and trace ele­ments by INAA. Because their claim seemed fee­ble, Neff, Glascock, and their colleagues chose not to publish a response to the Pinson petrographic study. The claim still seems weak, as does the claim that the petrographic study of a handful of Early Formative sherds "overturns" the results of the INAA study of nearly 1,000 ceramics and hun­dreds of raw clays. 
The "Mother Culture" Debate 
Blomster et al. (2005) mentioned the "mother cul­ture" vs. "sister culture" debate as part of the back­ground on the intellectual history of Olmec studies, but they argued (p. I 068) for moving beyond the mother vs. sister dichotomy. They noted that mother culture advocates have discussed "the dissemina­tion of the social, political, and religious institutions of the Olmec," but they did not argue that their data proved this view to the exclusion of all others. Instead, they discussed pottery compositional data and what they showed about the circulation of ves­sels with Olmec-style motifs. They also took note

of local facsimiles of these designs at Etlatongo and the role of local producers. The authors of the pre­sent article vary greatly in their opinions on how much influence the Olmec had on their contempo­raries, despite unanimous agreement that the results of the Olmec INAA study were misrepresented by Stoltman et al. (2005) and Flannery et al. (2005). 
Nor did Blomster et al. (2005) attempt any sweeping conclusions about the role of exchange in Early Formative cultural evolution. Flannery et al. (2005) exaggerate their views by imputing to them the belief that movement of vessels denies the possibility of complex innovations elsewhere and complex inter-regional relationships. Explicit avowal of the "complex nature" of Olmec rela­tionships with their neighbors (B lomster et al. 2005: I 068) and the "multifaceted" interaction of producers and consumers of Olmec-style pottery (Blomsteret al. 2005 : 1071) contradicts such exag­gerations. 
Flannery et al. (2005: 1 1221) ridicule Blomster et al.'s (2005) conclusion that ceramics tended to flow out of the Gulf lowlands but not back in, con­tending that "unreciprocated trade among societies of this type is not typical or even viable." Flannery et al.'s (2005) discussion of"unreciprocated trade" pivots on the false claim that Blomster et al. (2005) suggest that nothing moved into the Gulf lowlands in exchange for the exported carved-incised and fine white pottery. Blomster et al. (2005) made no such suggestion. In an article focused on compo­sitional analysis and exchange of vessels with Olmec-style motifs, Blomster et al. (2005) did not even write about Early Formative trade in general. Still, there is the valid question of what, in fact, flowed from highland zones to the Gulf lowlands. 
Because exchange makes most sense if both parties gain, it may be expected to involve an exchange of goods that are relatively cheap locally for imported goods that are relatively dear. From this perspective, it is Flannery et al.'s (2005) insis­tence on reciprocal exchange of ceramics that could be construed as a nonviable argument. Ceramics may be exchanged, of course, if, say, different com­munities specialize in distinct fine ware classes. Or, as Flannery et al. (2005) suggest, it is possible that it was the contents rather than the ceramics themselves that were exchanged, although in the Olmec case it seems unlikely that heavy, fragile, and bulky carved-incised serving bowls were used as containers for long-distance transport of"desired products" between Early Formative centers (Flan­nery et al. 2005: 11221). In any case, in light of the demonstrated lopsidedness of Early Formative ceramic circulation, perhaps the most viable sug­gestion is that Gulflowland pottery was exchanged for goods that were either unavailable or relatively expensive in the Gulf lowlands. Thus, for instance, highland centers near obsidian sources, such as Tlapacoya, might have provided obsidian in exchange for the carved-incised pottery of Gulf lowland origin; Clark (1997:218) enumerates other possible imports to the Gulf lowlands, and Flan­nery (1968) has done so in the past as well. 

Finally, Flannery et al. (2005) summarize their position as one that is scientifically defensible and in opposition to the Blomster et al. (2005) argu­ments, which they label "creationist." Political arguments often make use of tendentious phrasing in order to make opposing views seem indefensi­ble. Linguist George Lakoff (2004) calls this sty le of argument "framing." Framing consists of using words and phrases that invoke images that a pro­ponent feels will resonate with the reader. These images may, in fact, represent the opposite of what is actually being stated. Like other social sciences, archaeology is not immune to arguments by "fram­ing," and over the years the literature has become filled with examples. Flannery et al.'s (2005) con­tention that Blomster et al. (2005) view "Mesoamerican civilization as the product of a kind of intelligent design" is an argument by framing. As we point out earlier in this section, there are good models that are consistent with the finding that San Lorenzo was predominantly a donor rather than a recipient of ceramics decorated in the Olmec style. 
Conclusion 

The objective of the analyses of Neff and Glascock (2002) and Blomster et al. (2005) was to build from primary data on individual sherd bulk elemental concentrations to reliable derived data consisting of compositional reference groups and associated information on inter-regional transport of particu­lar vessels. It is the creation of reliable data that is at stake. Archaeologists and other scientists use derived data routinely, although derived data are not often viewed as such in archaeology. In the same way that poor practices in excavation or survey can

create unreliable data, poor methods in ceramic provenance research can build unreliable data. Good methods (the basis for creation of reliable data) incorporate rigorous assessment of limita­tions on the resolution of one's measuring instru­ments. The measuring instrument used by Blomster et al. (2005), INAA, has limitations, and these lim­itations were evaluated and discussed explicitly (Neff and Glascock 2002). Despite its limitations, this measuring instrument produced an exception­ally clear result that demonstrated a marked lop­sidedness in the interregional transport of Early Formative carved-incised and white pottery. Because the pattern emerged from the analysis of a large sample, and pains were taken to minimize erroneous detection of interregional transport, this pattern would seem to qualify as reliable data. Inas­much as some past discussions have advanced com­plex interregional interpretations on the basis of very modest evidence, the clear patterning detected in such a large INAA data set would seem to rep­resent progress in Olmec archaeology. 
Flannery et al. (2005) and Stoltman et al. (2005) found the results of the Olmec INAA study unpalat­able and sought means to "overturn" the results. However, their statistical re-analyses commit exactly the kinds of errors that motivated a highly conservative approach in the original Blomster et al. (2005) study. The resulting unreliable data pro­duced by misapplication of statistical analysis not surprisingly support the preconceived view that "pottery moved freely among sites like Tlapacoya, San Jose Mogote, and San Lorenzo" (Stoltman et al. 2005: 11213). As noted above, an exchange sys­tem in which the participants do not specialize but rather all make and exchange the same goods (pot­tery) does not seem viable economically, unless dis­tinct classes of fine pottery were exchanged; more importantly, it is manifestly contradicted by a more careful statistical analysis of the INAA data (Blom­ster et al. 2005; Neff and Glascock 2002). 
The Stoltman et al. (2005) petrographic study has methodological weaknesses, as discussed above, but results obtained with a technique that has repeatedly demonstrated its value to archaeol­ogy for over 70 years should not be dismissed out of hand. In particular, considering that INAA of Leandro Gray sherds from Oaxaca showed them to be predominantly Oaxacan in origin, it would be no surprise if future INAA of "Leandro Gray" sherds from San Lorenzo were to confirm at least some of them to be Oaxacan imports. As noted pre­viously, even large samples may miss low­frequency compositional groups, and, unfortunately, we cannot be certain that any of the gray sherds from San Lorenzo are the same "Lean­dro Gray" sherds analyzed by Stoltman (but see footnote 3). Finding a few Leandro Gray Oaxacan imports to San Lorenzo would, like the previous INAA results, be important data to be considered in future discussions of the Olmec. But to claim that petrographic identification of a small number of imports "overturns" a pattern established by INAA of nearly 1,000 Early Formative ceramics and hundreds of clays is a rash exaggeration at best. 
Intra-and inter-regional interaction patterns were increasing in complexity and variability dur­ing the Early Formative period. The mother-sister culture debate is an element of Mesoamerican archaeology's intellectual history that no longer serves scholars well in characterizing the com­plexity of information and material exchange pat­terns that existed during this period. To reiterate what Blomster et al. (2005: 1068) stated, "we endeavor to move beyond this dichotomy." The INAA findings offer new information about the movement of certain vessels from the San Lorenzo area and about the scale of inter-regional pottery transport among several other areas. Analyses in process at MURR (David Cheetham, personal com­munication 2005) appear to provide further con­firmation of the patterning identified in the earlier study. Compositional analyses of pottery using multiple approaches in combination with other work published or underway on lithics, figurines, and other artifacts will establish a solid base of information about intra-and inter-regional exchanges. Detailed stylistic studies will also con­tribute to better understanding of how information and goods circulated at different geographical scales. 
Our purpose in this response is not to provide a synthesis of Early Formative Mesoamerican exchange relationships, but we believe that under­standing of those relationships should be informed by the evidence that people at San Lorenzo made and exported vessels with Olmec-style symbols in modest but detectable quantities at a time when, to date, we lack evidence that people in other regions did so. We do not conclude from this observation

that no pottery was ever transported by people who were moving among other regions. Moreover, other valuable objects that originated in non-Gulf areas were transported inter-regionally too. While the evidence persuades us that San Lorenzo and its 

support area were involved in production and exchange of ceramic prestige items that reached a number of regions, no one of us would suggest that regional variation across Mesoamerica in patterns of economic interaction should be ignored. To understand the bigger picture, it is counterproduc­tive to polarize research advances in terms of mother-sister culture positions, which have led to entrenchment of views and commitment to politi­cal rather than scholarly agendas. In sum, Blom­ster et al. (2005) did not attempt any sweeping conclusions about Early Formative exchange. They, like Neff and Glascock (2002), stuck to the specifics of what the ceramic INAA data showed about cir­culation of carved-incised and fine white ceramics. The new information produced by the project deserves to be taken seriously.

Notes 

1. 
One reviewer suggested that this paper should be authored only by the three original authors of the Science arti­cle, implying that the other authors did not contribute suffi­ciently to merit co-authorship status. In fact, however, the individuals listed as co-authors all made major contributions to the substance and tone of the draft submitted to Latin American Antiquity through a long and interactive series of internet discussions of multiple earlier drafts. Their contribu­tions are far more substantial than what is implied by a sim­ple acknowledgment. 

2. 
In the interest of setting the record as straight as possi­ble, it is worthwhile to note here that, although Flannery et al. (2005:11219) name Blomster as the individual responsible for sampling San Lorenzo, the Basin of Mexico, and Oaxaca collections, in fact the bulk of these samples were selected by a former University of Missouri-Columbia grad student, R. Sergio Herrera, as has been made clear in all associated pub­lications (Blomster 1998: Herrera et al. 1999; Neff and

Glascock 2002:2-3). Regrettably, Herrera abandoned the pro­ject around 2001, but this should not diminish the importance of the work he carried out selecting a sample that laid the groundwork for the first large-scale evaluation of Early Formative interregional ceramic exchange. 
3. 
Neither Winter nor Blomster, who have worked in the Etlatongo region, are familiar with the kaolinite clay sources to which Stoltman et al. (2005) refer. Payne identified the most iron-free source of kaolin in Oaxaca in the Nochixtlan Valley (Flannery and Marcus 1994:205). While the source has not been well documented, Joyce Marcus (personal com­munication, 1994) asserts that potters in Oaxaca circa 1970 used white kaolin from Nochixtlan. Local potters in Nochixtlan do not appear to exploit this source today, although it may have served in the past as a source for white slips and clays that imitated Xochiltepec White pottery (Blomster 1998). 

4. 
There may, in fact, be some intersection of the petro­graphic and INAA samples. Although Flannery and Marcus (1994) did not identify the San Lorenzo sherds from which Pyne took samples originally identified as Oaxaca imports, Blomster searched specifically for them, and believes that he included three (BLM045, BLM050, and BLM053) in the cur­rent analysis (Blomster et al. 2005:Table SI). These were identified as possible Pyne-Flannery sherds because of their superficial resemblance to Leandro Gray, their context num­ber, and the clear evidence of the recent removal of a frag­


ment. Because of problems pertaining to the collection and recording of the Pyne-Flannery samples, it is important that whatever may remain of these sherds be returned to Coe so that they can be matched with the parent sherds in the Peabody Museum and so that additional analyses intended to resolve the possible discrepancy between the petrographic and INAA results can be carried out. 
5. 
The possibility that temper might be imported to San Lorenzo from a distant location conceivably could further augment petrographic variation in local ceramic pastes. Admittedly, such a possibility seems unlikely based on ethno­graphic observations (Arnold 1985). Nonetheless, long­distance movement of tempering materials cannot automatically be assumed away, as the long-mysterious case of volcanic ash in lowland Maya pottery (Shepard 1937) may illustrate. 

6. 
Indeed, in thousands of sherds examined visually and microscopically from Etlatongo, many local ceramics pri­marily contain quartz, quartzite and mica as non-plastic inclu­sions; other inclusions, such as volcanics, occur less frequently (Blomster 2004 ). If some inclusions are rare in the sherd, much depends on where the thin-section is taken.
