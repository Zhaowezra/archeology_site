DIETARY CORRELATES TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF NASCA SOCIAL 

COMPLEXITY (A.D. 1-750) 
Corina M. Kellner and Margaret J. Schoeninger 
This study examines the relationship between agricultural intensification and social complexity in past societies using a 
' diachronic, contextualized population, the Nasca of the southern coast of Peru (A.D. 1-750). Using stable isotope analy­sis of human bone collagen, we tested social assumptions arising from the relationship between agricultural intensification and social complexity during the Nasca '.i cultural fluorescence, including the construction of underground filtration gal­leries (puquios). Our data show that while agricultural intensification may have spurred social complexity in the Nasca regian, it engendered few significant differences in access to foodstuffs. High status individuals in Nasca society had access to more meat than low status individuals, especially during time periods characterized by more social conflict, increasinfi trade routes, and agricultural intensification. Meat consumption may have been an important marker of status identity among the Nasca. Nasca elites, however, did not control access to agricultural products such as maize as effectively as they did meat. These dietary data support the contention that an indigenous process of innovation and intensification was the major catalyst to later social complexity in the Nasca population from the Las Trancas Valley. 
Este estudio analiza la relaci6n entre intensificaci6n agricola y complejidad social en las poblaciones def pasado a troves de los nasca, una poblaci6n diacr6nica y bien contextualizada procedente de la costa sur def Peru ( 1-750 D.C.). Mediante el analisis de is6topos estables presentes en el colageno de huesos humanos, examinamos algunas de las propuestas que surfie11 de la relaci6n entre intensificaci6n agricola y complejidad social durante la epoca nasca, como por ejemplo la construcci6n de galerias subterraneas de filtraci6n (puquios). Los datos obtenidos por este estudio demuestran que, aunque es posible que la intensificaci6n agricola haya estimulado una mayor complejidad social entre las nasca, este mismo proceso de intensifi­cacidn genera pocas diferencias significativas en el acceso a productos alimenticios. Los individuo.1· de mayor rango en la sociedad nasca tenian mejor acceso a proteina animal (came) que los individuos de menor rango, especialmente durante peri­odos caracterizados por conflictos socia/es, el incremento de rutas comerciales, y la intensificaci6n agricola. El con.sumo de came pudo haber sido un importante marcador de rango entre Los nasca. Las elites nasca, sin embargo, no manten{an con­trol sobre el acceso a productos agricolas tales como el maiz con la misma eficacia que en el caso de la came. Los datos obtenidos sobre la dieta de esta poblaci6n soportan un argumento a favor de un proceso local de innovaci6n e intensificacion agricola como el principal catalizador de la posterior complejidad social en la poblacidn nasca def valle de Las Trancas.

plexity even in agricultural societies (e.g., Larsen et al. 1992). Thus, the relationship between agri­culture and social complexity is poorly understood, and may differ across populations because of their unique cultural histories. The study of diachronic and contextualized archaeological populations in the midst of both processes is important to better characterize the "causal processes and sequences of the changes that are responsible for social vari­ability" (Feinman and Neitzel 1984:96). The pre­sent study investigates just such a population. 
The excellent archaeological record of the Nasca fromthesouthcoastofPeru(Figure l;A.D.1-750) presents a unique opportunity to test these associ­ations between agricultural intensification and social complexity. The Nasca experienced social and environmental challenges over the course of their history, ranging from a drought to the con­struction of aqueducts to the widening of individ­ual social differences to the creation of large, dense towns from early household settlements that were smaller and widely spaced during their develop­ment into a complex chiefdom (Schreiber and Lan­cho Rojas 2003). The material correlates of the Nasca, such as desert geoglyphs and polychrome pottery, have been explored for nearly 100 years (Hrdlicka 1914; Menzel 1959; Rowe 1956; Tello 1917; Uhle 1914). Recent studies have built on this foundation by analyzing intra-Nasca social vari­ability, which is crucial in assessing the biocultural

effects that environmental and social changes had on individual Nasca lives (Conlee and Schreiber 2006; Kellner 2006; Schreiber and Lancho Rojas 2003; Silverman 1993; Vaughn 2004). This study investigates agricultural intensification and its asso­ciation with the development of social complexity among the Nasca by examining diet through sta­ble isotope analysis of human bone collagen. On the basis of the archaeological evidence of tempo­ral changes such as a drought, the construction of a complex irrigation system (puquios), increasing social differences in burial practices, and more aggregated communities, we expect that maize intensification contributed to the development of social complexity in the Nasca region. 
Stable Isotope Analysis 
Bone collagen exhibits carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios (represented as o 13C and o15N in per mil notation: %0) that are correlated with the o13C and o15N of an individual's diet (DeNiro and Epstein 1978, 1981; see also Katzenberg 2008). Values of o13C in human bone collagen are com­monly used to determine the relative dependence on plants that use the Cor C4 photosynthetic path­

C4 plants. which have higher (less negative) o13C values, include many grass species such as maize and ama­ranth. The Crassulacean Acid Metabolism (CAM) photosynthetic pathway includes cacti and other succulents; these plants exhibit o13C values that can fall between Cand C4 plants, although sev­

collagen 813C values about 3-4%0 higher than their diets (see data in Kellner and Schoeninger 2007). Marine animals have 813C values in their flesh that are higher than most C3 plants and can overlap the values for C4 plants (Schoeninger and DeNiro 1984). Therefore, in regions where humans eat maize or consume other C4 plants and have access to marine foods, human bone collagen 813C values are not useful in reconstructing the amount of marine food in diet (Schoeninger et al. 1990). 
Nitrogen stable isotope ratios in plants vary widely based on their source of nitrogen and meta­bolic factors (Figure 2; see Shearer and Kohl 1986). Terrestrial plants have 815N values ranging from 0%o to +7%0 (Virginia and Delwiche 1982). Legumes, with few exceptions, have 815N values in the lower end of this range because they depend to a varying extent on fixation of atmospheric nitro­gen (with a value of zero, by definition); the vast majority of plants average around 3-7%o (Schoeninger et al. 1997) because they use nitro­gen containing compounds in soil, which have val­ues higher than zero. Thus,humans that rely heavily on leguminous plants, like beans, for their protein will have lower bone collagen 815N values than those who do not. The use of manure on agricul­tural fields, however, may significantly raise 815N values of cereals and grains grown on those fields that might be erroneously interpreted as consum­ing more meat (Bogaard et al. 2007). 
Herbivorous animals have bone collagen 815N values that are approximately 3%o higher than those of the plants on which they feed and there is a 3%o offset, on average, between the bone collagen 815N values of herbivores and carnivores (Schoeninger and DeNiro 1984). This general increase in 815N values of animals at different trophic levels is called the "trophic level effect." A diet that is omnivorous is less accurately designated in 815N values; but because meat contains relatively more nitrogen per unit weight than most plant material, meat intake should be reflected by elevated bone collagen 815N values (Phillips and Koch 2002; Schoeninger 1985). Somewhat complicating this simple rela­tionship, human diets that include marine foods produce higher 815N values in bone collagen than those based on terrestrial foods, and diets includ­ing secondary marine carnivores (e.g., carnivorous mammals and fish) have higher 815N values than those reliant on marine invertebrates because of 
trophic level effects (e.g., Little and Schoeninger 1995; Schoeninger et al. 1983). The marine effect is normally larger than that produced by omnivory on terrestrial fauna, so human diets that include marine foods have higher 815N values than those with only terrestrial foods, including meat. Recent analyses of amaranth, or kiwicha in the Andes, show 813C values similar to maize but 815N values well above those of other plants (Turner et al. 2010:562); their mean o15N values, however, are below most marine resources. When all these influ­ences are taken into account, human bone collagen 815N values can identify dependence on marine foods in regions where diets contain both marine resources and maize products, which confound the use of 813C values (Schoeninger et al. 1990), and should also indicate dependence on terrestrial meat (Phillips and Koch 2002). 
Agricultural Intensification 
Agricultural intensification encompasses an increase in human labor along with field prepara­tion technology designed to augment the produc­tivity of crops, such as manuring, weeding, or irrigation (Tainter 2006:94; White et al. 1993:367). Whether the agricultural intensification anticipated or was the product of increasing levels of social complexity has been a debate within anthropology 

(e. g.,Boserup 1965; Cohen 1977; Wittfogel 1957); but in many regions, there is a link between these two processes. For example, in the Neolithic Long­shan culture in North-Central China (3000-2000 B.C.), a period of rapid climatic fluctuations and an increase in land use for rice agriculture coincides with the emergence of social stratification (Liu et al. 2002). Among the present-day inhabitants of the Strickland-Bosavi region of Papua New Guinea, the Bedamuni who intensively cultivate tubers exhibit more social hierarchy than the hunter-hor­ticulturist Kubo (Minnegal and Dwyer 1998). A correlation between irrigation system size and polit­ical unity occurred in the Moche complex chief­dom/state from northern Peru around A.D. 600 (Moseley and Deeds 1982). In the Lake Titicaca Basin of Bolivia during the Late Sillumocco period (200 BC-AD. 400), the development of raised field agriculture was accompanied by "oppor­tunistic economic strategies" by elite groups (Stan­ish 1994:321, 2007). As part of their colonial

strategy in the Moquegua valley, the Peruvian Wari Empire (AD. 600) instituted the first extensive irri­gation canals along with pronounced social strati­fication (Williams 2006:319-320). 
In other societies, agricultural intensification occurs with little internal social stratification. On the north coast of Peru during the Late Prehispanic Period (AD. 1000-1480) local authorities main­tained highly efficient irrigation systems in a dif­ficult environment without a centralized state bureaucracy (Netherly 1984), similar to the strate­gies of people living in the Ancash highlands of North-Central Peru during the Late Intermediate Period (AD. 1000-1480; Lane 2009). In the Mix­teca Alta region of Oaxaca, Mexico, during the Postclassic period (A.D. 800-1521), and in pre­hispanic Lambayeque, Peru, agricultural intensifi­cation functioned in a peripheral region without direct state management (Hayashida 2006; Perez Rodriguez 2006). 
Various studies indicate that maize agricultural intensification and changes in social complexity are correlated with changes in diet. In some, the depen­dence on maize increases, and in many cases this increase is linked to a narrowing of dietary breadth and a change in dietary protein, either in the type of protein or as a reduction in the consumption of meat. In precontact Ontario, maize intensification through time (AD. 1125-1500) correlates with less negative 813C values and fish consumption appears to have dropped as indicated by lower 815N values overall (Katzenberg et al. 1995). In the eastern United States, 813C values indicate that individu­als at more complex Middle Mississippian (A.D. 1350-1450) sites ate more maize than those at less complex Fort Ancient (A.D. 1000-1450) sites (Schurr and Schoeninger 1995). In addition, a diachronic population from Moundville,Alabama, shows a jump in maize consumption during times of social complexity and a significant drop in maize consumption when Moundville social complexity collapsed (Schoeninger and Schurr 1998). In the Georgia Bight (United States), where indigenous maize agriculturists were forced to intensify maize production for the Spanish, individuals exhibited less negative 813C values and lower 815N values (indicating less marine fish) than before the impo­sition of colonial power, suggesting that intensifi­cation for state benefit significantly changed everyday diet (Larsen et al. 1992). During a period of agricultural intensification, population 813C val­ues are slightly less negative than earlier periods in Pacbitun, Mexico (A.D. 550-700; White et al. 1993), and in the Viru valley of north coastal Peru, 813C values of inland communities show a gradual increase in maize consumption within the first mil­lennium AD. (Ericson et al. 1989). 
Status and Gender Roles 
Maize agricultural intensification and the devel­opment of social complexity produce varied dietary outcomes for status roles, especially in chiefdom level societies (e.g.,Danforth 1999: 15-16). House­hold botanical evidence at the Peruvian north­coastal site of Pacatnamu (AD. 300-700) shows that elites consumed more terrestrial meat and restricted items (e.g.,chile peppers and coca) while commoners ingested easily obtainable fare such as wild plants and shellfish (Gumerman 2002). Fau­na! analyses in various regions suggest that elites had more access to diverse diets sometimes char­acterized by higher-quality cuts of meat, such as in socially differentiated households in the Kahikinui region in Hawai'i (Kirch and O'Day 2003), the Maya region of Petexbatun in Guatemala (Emery 2003), and in central Andean Xauxa households after Inca agricultural intensification (Hastorf 2001). Stable isotope analyses of bone collagen and apatite support this interpretation of elites or special social classes having a more diverse diet and more meat than non-elites, including at Copan, Honduras (Reed 1994), and at the U.S. Southeast site of Cahokia (Ambrose et al. 2003). At the pre­historic Czech site of Kunta Hora-Karlov, male warriors (determined by presence of weapons in burials) exhibit higher average 815N values than nonwarriors, suggesting they ate more meat (LeHu­ray and Schutkowski 2005). High status individu­als from precontact Ecuador, however, ate similar amounts of meat but more maize (possibly maize beer or chicha), when compared with low status individuals (Ubelaker et al. 1995). In contrast, no status difference in diet was found between elites and commoners in Late Mississippian American Bottom sites (A.D. 1250-1275) (Hedman et al. 2002) or at the Maya site of Pacbitun (White et al. 1993:366). 
Like status differences in diet, dietary differ­ences between the sexes are variable in agricultural

communities. Sex differences in diet were absent among agriculturists from the American Bottom in the U.S. Midwest (Hedman et al. 2002), Moundville in the U.S. Southeast (Schoeninger and Schurr 1998), and Pecos Pueblo and Gran Quivira in the 
U.S. Southwest (Kellner et al. 2010). The same is true for various populations of the Central Andes near the Wari heartland both before and during Wari influence (AD. 550-1000) (see Finucane 2009; Finucane et al. 2006).At Pueblo Bonito in the U.S. Southwest, however, women ate more undomesti­cated food products in contrast with the men who ate more maize and meat (Ezzo 1994:269). Maya maize agriculturists from coastal Belize (White 2005) and Copan (Reed 1994) show a similar pat­tern of women consuming less meat and less maize than men but with a stronger association among the elite than commoners. In prehistoric Peru, Tiwanaku men consumed significantly more maize than women did at the Moquegua site of Omo (A.D. 600---1000) (Sandness 1992:42) and during Inka rule in Xauxa, Peru in the central Andes (A.D. 1460-1532) (Hastorf 1991).ln the Maya, Omo, and Xauxa cases, the higher consumption of maize and meat by men is argued to stem from the greater access to it for ritual, ceremonial, or state purposes than women (Hastorf 1991; White 2005:373-374). 
Nasca Archaeological Record 
During the Early Nasca period (AD. 1-450),pop­ulations lived in small, widely spaced villages near the source of river water in the narrow valley foothills of the Andes (Figure 1; see Schreiber and Lancho Rojas 2003). River water directly irrigated fields to cultivate foodstuffs such as maize, beans, squash, potatoes, chile peppers, peanuts, and huarango (Silverman 1993). Other foods with a C4 isotope signal that would overlap with maize, such as amaranth, or kiwicha (Turner et al. 2010), and prickly pear, do not appear in the extant Nasca botanical record, even though these are seen in modem contexts (Sejuro 1990).Arable land did not exist in the wide middle valley portions of the Southern Nasca Region (SNR) at this time because the river system drops underground. Communal feasting at the Nasca ceremonial center of Cahuachi (Figure 1) began in this period, and involved the transfer of dietary calories in the form of chicha, or maize beer, and other foodstuffs from the elite to non-elite mainly for labor (e.g., Vaughn 2004). 
During the Middle Nasca period (A.D. 450-550), SNR populations began constructing an aqueduct system, known as puquios, to tap under­ground water in response to a drought that over a 30-year period "significantly reduced river runoff (from the Andes) to ... coastal communities" (Shi­mada et al. 1991 :262; Thompson et al. 1985). Peo­ple responded to this environmental challenge by shifting their settlements to the now-irrigated mid­dle valleys (Schreiber and Lancho Rojas 2003). Kin groups, known ethnohistorically and today as ayllus, may have constructed or maintained the puquio system, as they do in other regions (Erick­son 1992; Trawick 2003). It is unclear, however, if prehistoric Nasca elites directed the construction or maintenance of the puquios or if these tasks were managed by kin groups or more communally. 
In the Late Nasca period (AD. 550-750), peo­ple aggregated into larger sites that were situated defensively; social conflict seems to have increased during this time (Kellner 2002; Schreiber and Lan­cho Rojas 2003; see Tomasto 2009 for information on the northern Pal pa region of the Nasca drainage). In addition, social differences between individuals widened during the Late Nasca period as reflected in burial goods (Carmichael 1995). Tello's field notes, published posthumously (Novoa Bollota 2002), suggest that these tombs were reused and that various parts of previous burials were moved aside for newer offerings or burials. Botanical evidence suggests a temporal shift in maize varieties from before the Early Nasca period to the Late Nasca period from smaller, more "popcom"-like varieties to larger-kerneled, floury, semiflint varieties more amenable to chicha production (Grohman et al. 1961:85; Johannessen and Hastorf 1989:692). 
The Middle Horizon in the Andes (A.D. 7 50-1000) encompassed the emergence of the Wari state and its incursion into the Nasca region. Our previous isotope study of Late Nasca and Middle Horizon populations in the Nasca region showed no statistically significant status differences in diet. Some high-status individuals had 815N values that were higher than all of the low-status individuals, but this finding was not significant, suggesting no overarching power over access to meat (Kellner and Schoeninger 2008). This current study incorpo­rates individuals from the Early Nasca and Middle Nasca time periods and includes a larger sample

size from the Late Nasca period. These new data should clarify differential access to food in earlier Nasca time periods, if such occurred. 
Dietary Expectations 
We expect more maize consumption through time if the Nasca intensified maize agriculture after puquio construction, similar to that seen in Ontario and Moundville (Katzenberg et al. 1995; Schoeninger and Schurr 1998). In addition, we expect dietary breadth to narrow if the production of maize is emphasized over other foods. If Nasca elites were able to "transform surplus into power" (Thurston and Fisher 2007:10) through the denial of cultivated or difficult to obtain foodstuffs to other members of Nasca society, we expect more maize and meat consumption for higher-status individu­als as they may have had access to more of the prod­ucts of agricultural intensification (maize and/or chicha) and meat than lower-status individuals as seen in Ecuador and Belize (Ubelaker et al. 1995; White 2005). If agricultural labor roles based on sex changed after the construction of the puquios, then we expect to see temporal changes in the diets of men and women. We expect less consumption of maize and meat by women than men as seen in the Belize example (White 2005) and in the case of chicha or maize beer in the Peruvian Andes (Has­torf 1991; Jennings 2005; Sandness 1992). 
Strontium (87Sr/86Sr; see Bentley 2006 for an overview) and carbon isotope analysis of isolated Nasca human heads (i.e.,Nasca "trophy" head indi­viduals or THis) from the more northern Nasca Valley in the SNR (Figure 1) indicates that they come from the region and consumed a diet similar to other Nasca individuals (Knudson et al. 2009). If the Nasca THis are indeed from the same popu­lation as the non-THis in this sample, then we expect that their diet will follow the population dietary patterns through time. Alternatively, if the Nasca THis were collected from a region where the diet was not similar to the Nasca, we expect them to have a significantly different diet than the rest of the population. 
Materials and Methods 
Forty-five adult human skeletons from the 1927-1928 Julio C. Tello Nasca skeletal collection 
that spans the entire Nasca sequence were analyzed in this study (Table 1). These multicomponent cemeteries were important to the Nasca through­out their history but are not associated with spe­cific sites during the Early Intermediate Period (ca. 
A.D. 1-750); they are, however, located within a few kilometers of the large local Middle Horizon site (A.D. 750-1000) of Huaca de! Loro and these cemeteries contain many later Middle Horizon burials (Figure 1). Currently curated at the Musco Nacional de Arqueologfa, Antropologfa, e Histo­ria del Peru in Lima, Peru, these individuals come from three cemeteries, Los Medanos, La Marcha, and El Pamp6n, located within 10 km of each other in the southernmost Las Trancas valley of the SNR (Novoa Bollota 2002). Nine individuals from this sample date to the Early Nasca period (l-450A.D.), 17 come from the Middle Nasca period (450-550 A.D.), and 19 to the Late Nasca period (550-750 AD.). In addition, we have included six Nasca THis. These are decapitated crania buried with other complete individuals as tomb inclusions. Likely taken in social conflict, Nasca THis are well represented in Nasca iconography and are incor­porated in this study because they are important in Nasca prehistory (Kellner 2006). We included three THis recovered from the tombs of Early and Mid­dle Nasca period individuals and three from the tombs of Late Nasca period individuals. 
Establishing status can be difficult, especially in prehistoric chiefdom level societies. On the basis of the lead author's familiarity with the fragmen­tary 1927 field notes, we assigned status based on tomb ceramic offerings and the correlation with other tomb inclusions such as textiles, feathers, and obsidian following earlier studies of Nasca burials (Carmichael 1995:170). Those tombs with greater numbers of tomb inclusions are more likely to pos­sess THis (often more than one), as reported pre­viously (Carmichael 1995). THis are not included in our status rankings as we have no way of know­ing their status during their lifetimes. 
The range of tomb inclusions in this sample encompasses those buried with fewer than five ceramic pieces (n = 17), to those buried with more than 10 ceramic pieces (n = 8).Although this analy­sis necessarily condenses Nasca status levels, our sample includes individuals interred with a wide variety of ceramic pieces and tomb inclusions. A statistically significant positive correlation exists
