Over 20 years ago, Sergio Quezada published a land­mark study entitled Pueblos y Caciques Yucatecos 1550­1580 (El Colegio de Mexico, 1993) that explained how Yucatec Maya political institutions changed in the wake of the Spanish invasion. Since then, Quezada's writings have become widely regarded as essential references for scholars who study the consequences of Spanish colonialism in sixteenth-century Mesoamerica. Now he has substantially revised and expanded his foundational work and made it available in English, ably translated by Terry Rugeley. Quezada' s new interpretations of the nature of indigenous political authority are sure to re­energize several long-running debates among archae­ologists, historians, linguists, historical geographers, and cultural anthropologists about continuity and change 
in native society. 
The book describes the emergence and reorganization 
of native Maya political jurisdictions headed by batabs (cacique, governor) and known as batabils (lordships, cacicazgos) from 1350-1600. Quezada argues that Yucatan 's Postclassic-era polities coalesced as the batab consolidated an extensive network of supporters based on personal alliances and ties of mutual obligation. He shows how this process works by analyzing the linguistic roots ofYukatek Maya political terms such as cuuchca­bal, cuchteel, halach uinic, and batab, by modeling vari­ations in political structure against lineage patronyms, and by mapping political units and lineage patronyms 
against toponyms that can still be located today in 
Yucatan. Most critically, he contends that differences in the wealth and political centralization of the lordships were not based on control of territory or private property; rather, power was derived from the batab's right to impose obligations on his subordinates and to command their labor. 
In his 1993 monograph, Quezada rejected the notion that when the Spaniards arrived in Yucatan, the region was divided into 18 or more territorially bounded "provinces" -an interpretation that had long been accepted, based on Ralph Roys 's 1957 treatise, The Political Geography of the Yucatan Maya. Yet, in this new volume, he pushes his arguments to the edge. He claims that, prior to European contact, the Maya lacked a concept of private land ownership. Evidence for this statement rests on two facts. First, there is no term for property (apart from possessive suffixes), particularly house lands or royal lands, in the Yukatek language recorded in the earliest native language documentary sources. Second, no evidence suggests that the native nobility developed a system of rents or possessed emi­nent domain over the lands of their subjects. He is espe­cially careful to explain that Yucatan's noble lineages were not organized like the Nahua seigniorial houses of central Mexico, which clearly maintained corporate ownership of house land and had tenants. Nor did the Spaniards grant entailed estates to the Maya nobility. As a result, he concludes that Yucatan's Postclassic poli­ties lacked territorial definition. 
The chapters of the book lay out precisely how each batab's networks and alliances shifted between 1550 and 1600. The batabs' political networks were radically changed as the Spaniards implemented policies of forcible resettlement (reducci6n) and Christian con­version. Resettlement policies were put into practice in two stages -in 1565 and 1582-and were accompanied

by the intrusive process of establishing governing coun­cils in new colonial towns. In the last chapter, Quezada delves into the conditions that underpinned the decline of native political structures. Limitations on the batab's control of labor and human capital, the mid-sixteenth century demographic crisis, Franciscan religious con­version, heavy demands for tribute, and constraints on mobility and migration irreparably weakened indige­nous political authority and broke apart the lordships. This book offers an extraordinarily detailed perspective on Yucatan 's sixteenth-century political history, and the data on which the interpretations are based are presented in the appendices. 
Quezada's latest volume does not incorporate addi­tional primary written sources over those used in his original publication, and most of his discussion relies on documents previously consulted by Ralph Roys, France Scholes, and Robert Chamberlain, which they used to write the history of the conquest of Yucatan. Yet, his analysis of these well-known sources draws broadly on archaeology, philology, ethnohistory, and cultural anthropology, which enables him to pick out the Euro­centric assumptions that pervade earlier historiography. Geographic coverage of sixteenth-century political juris­dictions is restricted to northern Yucatan. The volume does not include information for Campeche, Tabasco, the Peten, or Belize. Readers should also note that none of Quezada's evidence actually dates to the Postclassic period. He extends the treatment of political change back to the fourteenth century because his primary sources allude to historical memories before Spanish contact. The earliest documents used in this study date to the 1530s and 1540s, and discussion of prehispanic political organization at Chichen Itza and Mayapan relies on a cursory treatment of secondary archaeological literature. Quezada is unsympathetic to the way that archaeologists arbitrarily bound their project areas because he thinks that this practice reflects an uncritical acceptance that geographic boundaries should corre­spond to political territories. Perhaps now Mesoameri­can archaeologists will think twice before naming their project areas after early colonial-period cacicazgos. 
The most important difference between the new vol­ume and the 1993 monograph concerns a political unit known as the tzucub. In light of continuing philological research, Quezada has retracted his earlier discussion of the tzucub (a group of towns headed by individuals with the same patronymic and likely belonging to the same lineage, which defines a political territory) and replaced this term with lineage (linaje). The new volume also includes an expanded discussion of the reducci6n of Tiz­imin based on his work with Ines Ortiz Yam on the 1583 visita of Diego Garcia de Palacio to Yucatan. It is unfor­tunate that the press decided to reproduce the map show­ing mid-sixteenth century political organization at too small a scale. The author also eliminated the map show­ing 1565 and 1582 reducciones of native towns. Readers will need to consult Quezada's excellent original maps published in 1993 to compare how changes in settlement and spatial organization related to political change. 
This volume highlights a number of questions that demand additional investigation. First, scholars need to redouble their efforts to define the tzucub and to explain how it differs from a lineage or a seignorial house. Next, the volume heralds an urgent need to reexamine the use of models that are ba5ed on analogies to sixteenth-century native political organizations across Mesoamerica. His­toriographic and methodological challenges also loom large. Though the Yucatecan polities may have lacked a series of terms for house land, royal property, and terri­tory that their Aztec, Mixtec, and Tarascan counterparts clearly possessed, does the linguistic evidence clearly indicate a difference in concepts of private property and political territory? Or, is this variation attributable to dif­ferences in the Spaniards' efforts to commensurate con­cepts of Maya political and social organization with their own terms as seen through the lens of sixteenth-century European lord-vassal relations? The Maya-language doc­umentary and cartographic record emphasizes social relations and place over property, but terms for land mea­surement (based on a vigesimal counting system) and partible inheritance of land (from wills and testaments) that appear in seventeenth and eighteenth century records were not merely Spanish inventions. These observations beg the question of just how many "native" land use practices recorded in colonial land titles can be traced to the prehispanic period. 
Quezada's work also presents new challenges for archaeologists. For example, if territorial control and private ownership of the land from which agricultural commodities and natural resources were derived were not the bases of wealth and power in Postclassic Yucatan, what was? Clearly Maya polities were economically stratified and controlled labor and resources that sup­ported institutions of coercive force.Archaeologists have shown that the ideological bases for political clientage and rulership are clearly expressed in the epigraphy and iconography of Yucatan's Epiclassic and Postclassic period sites. But were the structures and mechanisms of state finance really poles apart from those in central Mex­ico and sixteenth-century Spain? Quezada suggests that the batabs deployed the labor of their vassals to manage the disposition of products and commodities through vast personal exchange networks. His views are not out of line with the work of archaeologists who have argued that capital accumulation was accomplished by circulat­ing commodities through market networks that were macroregional in scale. By expanding networks of per­sonal relations and alliances, elites in one economic zone or geographic area could capture surplus value from

elites in another area, creating economic interdependence that gave rise to the Postclassic world system. Since many of Yucatan' s Late Postclassic settlements and six­teenth-century towns can still be located using their toponyms, archaeological investigation offers solutions for understanding changes in political and economic organization before, during, and after the Spanish inva­sion. In fact, a number of archaeological investigations that have tested Quezada's political models have been underway for decades. 
Maya Lords and Lordships is an extraordinary, thought-provoking treatise that will reinvigorate debates among historians, archaeologists, linguists, and cultural anthropologists over sixteenth-century political change in Yucatan. Now that Quezada's seminal work is again widely available, it may stimulate renewed research on the Postclassic-Spanish colonial transition in Yucatan and across Mesoamerica.
