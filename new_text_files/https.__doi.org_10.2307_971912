ATALLA: A CENTER ON THE PERIPHERY OF THE CHAVIN HORIZON 

Richard L. Burger and Ramiro Matos Mendieta 
The emergence of public architecture in Peru's central highlands occurred during the mid-:first millennium B.C. and is corre­lated with the expansion of the Chavfn sphere of interaction. Atalla, a high-altitude site in Huancavelica, represents one of the first known centers with large-scale masonry constructions. Analysis of the ceramic assemblage reveals many similarities between the local ceramics and the Janabarriu phase pottery from Chavin de Hudntar, located 450 km to the north. The inhabitants of Atalla emulated the ceramic style and cut-stone masonry of the much larger northern civic-ceremonial centers, like Chav{n de Hudntar, while maintaining local traits such as circular dwellings and burials in or adjacent to domestic architecture. Utiliz­ing a core-periphery perspective, the unprecedented formation in the central highlands of a community like A ta Ila is hypothe­sized to be an independent response to demands for exotic goods from the more complex societies to the north. The largest mercury deposits in Latin America are located 15 km to the west of Atalla, and the center would have been in an excellent posi­tion to procure cinnabar and distribute this bright red vermilion pigment. Production of the pigment itself would have occurred at small villages like Chuncuimarca located in the zone of the mercury deposits. 
La emergencia de arquitectura publica en la sierra central de Peru occurri6 durante el primer milenio a. C. y estd correlacionada con la expansion de la esfera de interacci6n del horizonte Chavfn. Atalla es un sitio que se ubica en el Departamento de Huan­cavelica a unos 3,850 msnm, y representa uno de los primeros centros conocidos con construcciones de piedra de gran monu­mentalidad. El andlisis de la cerdmica de Atalla revela varias semejanzas estilfsticas con la cerdmica de la fase Janabarriu de! sitio arqueol6gico de Chavfn de Hudntar, ubicado 450 km de distancia. Los habitantes de Atalla imitaron el estilo de cerdmica yla mamposter(a de las centros civic-ceremoniales, coma Chavfn de Hudntar, pero a la vez mantuvieron rasgos locales como la construcci6n de estructuras domesticas circulares y un patron de enterramiento al interior o adyacente a las viviendas. La for­maci6n de una comunidad coma Atalla no tiene antecedente en la zona, y se plantea la hip<itesis que este asentamiento Jue una respuesta independiente a la demanda para bienes ex<iticos de las sociedades complejas norteiias. El dep<isito geoi<igico de cinabrio (HgS) de mayor envergadura en America Latina se encuentra a 15 km al oeste de Atalla y existe datos arqueohlgicos de su explotaci<in temprana en tiempos prehispdnicos. El cinabrio tiene un color distinctivo de rojo vivo, el cual era utilizado como pigmento para la decoraci6n de! cuerpo humano y artefactos durante el Horizonte Temprano en sitios como Kuntur Wasi y Chav{n de Hudntar. Atalla ten{a una excelente ubicaci6n en el procuramiento y distribuci6n de! pigmento de cinabrio (bermeli<in). La producci<in de! pigmento habrfa ocurrido en asentamientos pequeiios coma Chuncuimarca que se localiza en la zona de los dep<isitos de mercu­rio cerca del pueblo actual de Huancavelica.

architecture (Matos 1978; Ravines 1969-1970, 1971, 1998). The impressive features of Atalla and the con­trast they present with coeval settlements suggest that the inhabitants of the site differed in status and power from those of the surrounding communities and that a new degree of social differentiation had emerged in this region. 
Thus, the existence of Atalla raises one of the fun­damental questions shared by anthropology and his­tory: How and why do relatively egalitarian kin-based communities abandon an organizational form that has proved successful for thousands of years in favor of more complex hierarchical social arrangements? In the case of Atalla, it also seems cru­cial to ask why these transformations occurred when and where they do. Why was a large center with pub­lic architecture built at Atalla rather than elsewhere in the central highlands of Peru, and what accounts 
for its appearance during the Early Horizon? 
The purpose of this article is twofold. First, it pro­vides a preliminary description of the archaeologi­cal site of Atalla and the ceramic assemblage

recovered during surface reconnaissance conducted there on two occasions. Such a presentation is Jong overdue considering the singular importance of Atalla and the frequent reference to it in the archae­ological literature. Until now, the few detailed descriptions of it have remained in unpublished sources. Our second purpose is to explore the poten­tial of using insights drawn from a core-periphery approach to interpret aspects of the Chavfn horizon, in general, and Atalla, in particular. It will be sug­gested that elements drawn from this perspective and the proximity of Latin America's largest source of cinnabar pigment may help to explain the timing and nature of this seemingly anomalous site in the high puna environment of Huancavelica. 
The Site of Atalla 

Atalla became known to the archaeological com­munity through the efforts of Julio Espejo Nunez, an archaeologist trained by Julio C. Tello, director of the Museo N acional deAntropologfa y Arqueologfa. In 1950, Espejo completed an archaeological map of the Man taro drainage that included 112 sites, and, being a student of Tello, he was puzzled by the absence of any that could be identified as "Chavfn." Espejo continued archaeological reconnaissance in the drainage through 1957, adding another 250 sites to his list. As part of this research, he surveyed the Ichu drainage, a tributary of the Mantaro in the Department of Huancavelica. On August 15, 1955, Espejo discovered a site that he referred to as Orc­concancha on the Hacienda Atalla. On the surface of the site were ceramics and obsidian projectile points "of evident Chavfn affiliation." Espejo linked these remains to other artifacts from the area in the Chavfn style that had been incorporated into the private col­lection of Julio Ruiz Pimentel, a pioneering figure in the archaeology of Huancavelica. Espejo (1958) published a short report on the site in La Vaz de Huancayo, and later that same year Ramiro Matos carried out the only scientific study of Atalla to date. Matos did not conduct excavations, but he engaged in systematic surface collecting as well as limited wall clearing. The results of his work at Atalla were incorporated into his bachelor's thesis at Universi­dad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos (UNMSM) and subsequent publications (1959, 1971, 1972, 1978). 
In 1988, Burger decided to restudy the ceramics collected by Matos at Atalla and now stored at the Museo de Arqueol6gia y Antropologfa UNMSM. 
He also analyzed the collection from Atalla made by Espejo that is now housed in the Museo Nacional de Antropologia, Arqueologia e Historia. 1 Comple­mentary pilot projects on ceramic composition and obsidian sourcing were initiated in collaboration with colleagues Isabelle Drue and Michael Glascock. In July 1997, Burger and Matos traveled together to Atalla for a brief visit despite the state of emergency that existed in Huancavelica at that time. Although the location of waterlogged areas surrounding Atalla had shifted because of the modification of the canal system, in most respects the site had changed little since the research by Matos four decades earlier. 
Description of the Site 
A tall a is the name applied by Matos and subsequent investigators to an archaeological site known locally as Ranra Cancha. The ruin is on a small mound called Orjon Cancha (or Orcconcancha), which is located on what was formerly the Hacienda Atalla. The site is situated only one-quarter of a kilometer from the lchu River, and it is directly across the river from the train station of the village of Yauli. At the present time, Atalla falls administratively within the District ofYauli, Province of Huancavelica, Depart­ment of Huancavelica; the site is approximately 15 km downstream from the departmental capital of Huancavelica. 
At 3,850 m above sea level, Atalla is located in the vast puna grasslands where herds of llamas and alpacas once roamed along with deer, vicufia, vis­cacha, and other wild game. A natural spring located just above Atalla would have provided a convenient source of water, and at present the landscape is ver­dant throughout the year because of the pooling of water in the lands surrounding the site (Figure 2). 
The archaeological zone of Atalla covers a min­imum of 4.5 ha (Figure 3). The site appears as a low mound (200 m x 250 m) surrounded by a wall and crude terraces. These were built of quarried and roughly shaped stone blocks. A concentration of smaller stone constructions is visible covering the summit. The size and technique of the early stone constructions at Atalla do not resemble the later pre­historic architecture of Huancavelica, and Matos has tentatively identified them as "Chavfn" or "Forma­tive" in date. 
A late occupation atAtalla is represented by small, poorly built, circular habitation structures lacking foundations. These were constructed by people using

the coarse "Man taro style" pottery of the Late Inter­mediate Period (LIP). Apparently, the LIP inhabitants reoccupied the site following a lengthy period of abandonment, in some cases reutilizing older build­ings or the building materials from these earlier con­structions. 
In the area of densest refuse near the center of the site, a complete surface collection by Matos of a 25 m2 area yielded a large pottery sample, of which 64 percent date to the Early Horizon; only 34 percent correspond to the LIP occupation. This is surprising considering that the older occupations of multicom­ponent sites are usually underrepresented in surface surveys. The ceramic analysis of the surface sample lends weight to the conclusion that the reoccupation of Atalla was insubstantial compared with the orig­inal settlement. 
The original occupation is dated to the Early Hori­zon and consists of semisubterranean circular build­ings with foundations some .5-1.1 m below the current soil level. These constructions were made of rough uncoursed stones of different sizes, with some­what larger stones used in the lower part of the build­ings. Matos believes that the larger of the circular structures served as dwellings and that the smaller ones may have been specialized storage or funerary constructions. In some cases, the dead were buried inside or adjacent to the outer walls of the circular buildings. Mortars and grinding stones, along with abundant household refuse, are associated with the circular buildings. Just prior to the research by Matos, three of the buildings were looted by huaqueros. During the investigation of this disturbance, a pair of buried individuals was documented in each of two buildings and a single body was found in a third (Matos 1959:5). 
On the uppermost part of the mound is a large rec­tangular structure built of quarried and selected stones. The quality of the workmanship on this build­ing surpasses that of any other features at the site. Its walls were straight and carefully constructed to pre­sent an even exterior face. In his original study, Matos concludes that this central construction was a pub­lic building, perhaps a temple. An opening into this structure's interior was cleared. It measured only 75 cm in height and 55 cm in width and was built using large slab-shaped blocks unlike those of the dwellings or outer perimeter wall. 
The surface collections made at Atalla by Matos consisted primarily of ceramics, but there were also

lithic tools and flakes of obsidian and quaitz. The stone tool assemblage includes bifacially flaked points, scrapers, and utilized flakes. In addition, Matos recovered three polished stone cup fragments reminiscent of exotic vessels subsequently found at Chavfn de Huantar. Unfortunately, the stone vessels were not fully documented and could not be found during the restudy of the pottery collections at UNMSM. During the 1997 site visit by Burger and Matos, a fragment of a small, shallow stone bowl was encountered (Figure 4). It was made from a dark, coarse-grained mafic igneous rock by pecking and polishing; its circular form and convex-curved sides resemble some of Atalla's ceramic bowls. 
The observations summarized above suggest that during the Early Horizon, Atalla was the locus of a sedentary community that was unusually large. Chuncuimarca, the closest coeval site, covers less than a hectare and has no large walls or buildings (Ravines 1969-1970). Further to the north, investi­gations in the Man taro Valley by Browman ( 1970) encountered only two small Early Horizon sites, nei­ther of which are comparable to the size of Atalla. In the late 1970s, Jeffrey Parsons and Matos ( 1978) directed a complete coverage survey that included roughly 1,000 km2. It focused on four representative sectors of the central highlands: the Jauja drainage (a major intermontane valley), the Junfn puna (high grasslands), the Huasahusi region (uplands forest), and the Tanna region (a warm eastern valley). These extensive surface investigations and subsequent excavations found no occupations dating to the Ini­tial period or Early Horizon in the Upper Mantaro or Tarma drainages (D' Altroy 1992:37; Hastorf 1993: appendix A; Parsons et al. 2000). Small occu­pations predating A tall a have been identified in caves and open sites in the central highlands, including Huancavelica, but their character led Ravines ( 1971)

The Early Horizan Ceramics from Atalla 
Before attempting to interpret the significance of Atalla, it is essential to establish the age of its pub­lic constructions and consider their cultural affilia­tion. As noted, the evidence available suggests that the more substantial buildings and walls were asso­ciated with the early pottery originally identified by Espejo and Matos as "Chavfn" in style. It should be borne in mind, however, that in 1958 the term Chavin was applied freely and was used to characterize a wide range of dark incised monochrome pottery. In the case of Atalla, however, the early component of ceramics constitutes a mid-Early Horizon assem­blage with strong parallels to the Early Horizon ceramic styles at sites like San Blas in Junfn, Kotosh in Huanuco, Chavfn de Huantar in Ancash, and the upper levels of the Tank Site at Anc6n near Lima (Burger 1993). A brief description of the pottery from Atalla accompanied by illustrative drawings and photographs is offered here as the most com­pelling evidence of the age of the site and of the cul­tural identity of Atalla's builders. 
A reanalysis of surface collections made atAtalla by Espejo and Matos demonstrates that the domi­nant stylistic component has strong similarities to the Janabarriu Phase pottery at Chavfn de Huantar. What is striking about these parallels is that they are not limited to a single shape or vessel class; nor can they be explained as occasional imports of "preciosities," such as an exotic bottle or bowl (cf. Goldstein 2000). Instead, the Atalla assemblage includes a range of vessel shapes, such as neckless ollas, bowls, plates, necked jars, and oversized bowls, all of which have counterparts at Chavfn de Huantar. Because of their close similarity, the typology developed for Chavfn de Huantar by Burger ( 1984) will be applied directly 

to the Atalla assemblage. The ceramic similarities to the findings at Chavfn de Huantar are not limited to their shape, attributes, and size (Table 1) but also appear in their decoration and surface finishing. It should be emphasized that the Chavfn-related ceram­ics atAtalla constitute the majority of the pottery uti­lized in the domestic and public spaces during the early occupation at the site. They appear to be locally produced and were not exotic prestige goods for mortuary offerings or other specialized purposes. 
Pottery Forms 
Bowls. Small bowls appropriate for single servings are a frequent vessel form in the assemblages from Atalla. The exteriors of these vessels were finished by polishing them to an even glossy surface, usually obliterating the smoothing lines in the process. The interiors of the vessels were also carefully finished, although they were usually less glossy than the exte­riors (sometimes matte or low gloss) and finishing marks were sometimes partially visible. The surface of the bowls was usually a dark gray (2.5YR3/1), but some tended toward a weak red (2.5YR4/2). 
Using the form classification developed for Chavin de Huantar (Burger 1984 ), the most common bowlformatAtallais Bowl 10; Bowl lOAis the most common variant. It is a shallow bowl with a sharply beveled rim and a flat beveled angle. The sidewalls are oblique, and the base is flat (Figure 5a-b).

Another popular variant of Bowl 10 is Bowl lOC, which is a beveled bowl similar to lOA but whose bevel is more rounded (Figure Sc--0), There is also one example of Bowl lOB where the bevel is flat but much less angled than lOA or lOC (Figure Se). This example differs from the bowls at Chavfn de Huan­tarin having a sharp comer point at the shoulder. The Bowl 10 vessels at Atalla resemble the Chavfn de 

Huantar bowls with similar forms in other ways as well, including the following: ( 1) the exterior is often decorated; (2) the surface is finely finished, often with a medium luster; (3) a broad incision runs around the mouth of the bowl just below the bevel; ( 4) dec­orations consist of repeating simple incised or stamped geometric motifs; and (S) the bases are nearly flat, and an (6) incision runs around the ves­sel above the basal angle and below the decoration 
(Figure Sf). 
Two examples of bowls with pouring lips occur 
in the Atalla assemblages. The idea of pulling a sec­
tion of the rim out from its normal circular shape in 
order to create a "pouring lip" that functions like a 
spout was introduced into the Chavin de Huantar 
ceramic assemblage during Janabarriu times, when 
it was used in the production of bowls (Burger 
1984: 109-110). It also has been documented in other 
Janabarriu-contemporary assemblages distant from 
Chavfn de Huantar, such as Karwa, on the Paracas. 
Peninsula; Anc6n, in the Chill6n drainage; and Moro 
de Eten, in the Lambayeque drainage. At Atalla, as 
at Chavfn de Huantar, the pouring lip is used on Bowl 
10 vessels and is highlighted by skirting it with a 
hemispherical incision that is an extension of the 
horizontal incision around the vessel's mouth. 
In addition, an example of Bowl 8B appears in 
the Atalla sample. This popular Janabarriu form is 
concave curved and has a distinctive interior thick­
ening of the rim, which produces a slight bulge and 
rounded lip (Figure Sg). This specimen has a cir­
cumferential incision, below which is rocker stamp­
ing. Similar bowls occur at Chavin de Huantar. 
Plates. There is a single plate fragment (Figure 
Sh) in our sample from Atalla, and it resembles some 
plates from Chavfn de Huantar in having a flat rim 
decorated with circle-dots. However, the simple con­
vex-curved form of the Atalla plate, with its hori­
zontally flattened rim, has no known equivalent. Its 
closest parallel is Plate 4, but the latter has a flattened 
rim jutting out as a flange (Burger 1984: figure 346). 
Other Janabarriu forms at Chavfn have repeating cir­
cle-dots on horizontal broad, flat rims (see Bowl l 3C 
and Cup 7 in Burger 1984: figures 241, 284). 
Oversized Bowls. These vessels have a red slip 
like those from Chavfn de Huantar, and their diam­
eters are 28 cm and 29 cm, respectively, compared 
with the 30--4S cm range of the Chavin Janabarriu 
Phase counterparts. One Atalla piece is similar to

but with less flattening of the rim. The finishing is slightly different, but its overall form is basically similar (Figure 6a). There is one example of over­sized Bowl 3B. It has a similar rim, applique band, and overall shape (Figure 6b ). The rapid thinning of the sidewalls below the applique band on the Atalla piece has parallels on Chavfn de Huantar vessels (Burger 1984: figure 265). 
Neckless Ollas. At Atalla, neckless ollas are vari­able in form, but several (Figure 7a) resemble Neck­less Olla 16, while others (Figure 7b) resemble Neckless Olla 18. A third shape (Figure 7c) is not like the Janabarriu forms in any but the most general sense. It is closest in form (but not color) to some of the Chakinani vessels (e.g., Neckless Olla 11). At Atalla, the neckless ollas have two size ranges: small, with a mouth diameter of 7-10 cm, and large, with mouth diameters of approximately 18 cm. Many of the neckless ollas were decorated on their exteriors, often with circle-based designs similar to those on the bowls, but they often lack the incision around the mouth (Figure 71J-,{:). At Chavfn de Huantar, many decorated neckless ollas also lack this incision (Burger 1984: figures 305, 309). Several oftheAtalla body sherds with decoration from restricted vessels 
are probably from neckless ollas. 
Jars. One fragment (Figure 7d), with its concave shape and thickened flattened rim, resembles Chavfn de Huantar's Jar 6 necks. Like the Chavfn de Huan­tar cases, this jar is slipped red. 
Pottery Decoration 
Decoration at Atalla consisted primarily of surface modification through incision or texturing. However, the addition of applique elements and post-fire inci­sion also occurred. Painting was rare except in the form of overall red slips, although some fragments do show traces of post-tire red pigment in the inci­sions. 
Incision was a popular decorative technique at Atalla. Most incisions on the Atalla pottery are broad (2-3 mm wide) and were made while the clay was leather hard, so the edges of the incisions are even and a slight luster is sometimes visible in their bot­toms. This technique was mainly used to create repet­itive geometric designs, especially circles with central dots and concentric circles. There are also instances of concentric circles with central dots and simple circles, but these are less common than the other two designs. Simple geometric motifa are gen-

erally arranged in horizontal rows and cover the entire exteriors of the vessels. On rare occasions, lines of them were also applied to the upper surface of broad flat lips. There are instances in which inci­sion was used to produce pendant hemispherical motifs (Figure Sb) or unidentifiable geometric designs (Figure Sa). 
When circle-based designs are utilized, they are rarely combined with other motifs or techniques. In most cases, a single design is used repeatedly with little variation in its form or size (Figure 8a--c). In our sample, there is a single exception to this gen­eralization. The beveled bowl (Figure 8d) in ques­tion has rows of small circle-dot designs alternating with a row of medium-sized concentric circles; it also differs from the norm by the decoration on the beveled lip of the bowl. 
Incision was also used to define zones of decora­tion. Many bowls have a single vertical line running horizontally around the perimeter of the vessel mouth, separating it from the decorated body of the vessel (Figure 8e-i). A similar incision was also sometimes applied above the basal angle of bowls, delimiting the lower extreme of the decoration (Fig­ure Sf). Incision also delimited bands of texturing and was used to create more complex curvilinear designs, although the examples of this are not sufficiently large to allow identification of the theme represented (Figure 9d). 
Post-fire incision was applied to a distinctive group of small open bowls with rounded lips, con­vex sides, a slight basal angle, and relatively flat bases. Because of the difficulty of incising into already fired vessels, the decorative lines are usually irregular in line and width (Figure 1 Oe ). Of the seven examples of these bowls in our sample, all but one have decoration on both their exteriors and their inte­riors. Several have a series of roughly parallel verti­cal lines, sometimes along with one or more horizontal lines running perpendicular to them. On other bowls, there are parallel diagonal lines that, in one case, are crossed by other diagonal lines to form a crosshatch pattern. Perhaps the most distinctive pattern is a plant-like motif created by a single cen­tral vertical line with diagonal lines emerging from both of its sides. One of these bowls, decorated with

inverted V designs, has traces of red post-fire pig­ment in the incisions. 
Besides incisions, a range of other techniques was utilized. A portion of the repeating geometric motifs appears to have been made with seals or stamps rather than by incision (Figure 5c). This practice is also identified at Chavfn de Huantar. In some cases, the circles appear to have been made with a stamp, whereas the central dot was made by hand. 
A large range of surface-texturing techniques was employed. Punctations, both tear-shaped and trian­gular, were used on the surface of restricted vessels, perhaps bottles (Figure 9b-c). In one case, irregular punctations were combined with incisions to deco­rate a bowl exterior. Even more common is the tex­turing of exterior areas using a serrated device to create either fine rouletting or dentate rocker stamp­ing (Figure 9a, e, g-h). There are also specimens that have shallow, roughly parallel lines crowded together; this decorative technique occurs in other Early Horizon assemblages, and it has been referred to as combing or brushing because of the presumed tools utilized (Figure 9f). Most of these texturing techniques are known from body sherds derived from restricted vessels. Another texturing technique, sim­ple rocker stamping, is known at Atalla from a sin­
gle open bowl fragment (Figure 5g). 
The technique of adding clay to form applique decoration was widespread during the Early Hori­zon, and two examples of it were found in the Atalla samples from restricted vessels, probably bottles. One fragment has a small, incised, applique nubbin projecting from a zone textured by rouletting (Fig­ure 9e ). A second sherd has a thin applique band mod­eled and incised to represent a serpent. The wall of the vessel chamber is 5-6 mm in thickness, but it reaches I 0 mm where the applique band is thickest. 
Identity and Ceramic Style at Atalla 
As noted, the ceramic assemblage from Atalla has striking similarities to ceramic assemblages from the Chavfn horizon in general and the Janabarriu phase ceramic assemblage from Chavfn de Huantar in par­ticular. The prominence of small decorated bowls with beveled rims is particularly noteworthy, as is the presence of the same decorative motifs arranged in the same manner as found at Chavfn de Huantar. The shared use of distinctive features such as pour­ing lips has already been mentioned. Similarly, the popularity of undecorated medium-sized neckless ollas and small decorated neckless ollas has strong parallels in the Janabarriu phase assemblage from

Chavfn de Huantar, even down to omitting the upper horizontal incision that appears on decorated bowls. The similarities in form, surface treatment, decora­tive techniques, and organization betweenAtalla and Chavfn de Huantar pottery are much stronger than those with coeval sites located at less distance, such as nearby Chuncuimarca near Huancavelica (Ravines 1969-1970), Ticrapo near Castrovirreyna (Ravines 1998), San Blas in Junfn (Morales l 998a; Nomland 1939), and Kotosh in Huanuco (Izumi and Terada 1972). 
The resemblances with Chavfn de Huantar are so striking that the possibility that exotic pottery was imported had to be considered. To begin exploring this question, a pilot study of the paste of two Chavfn­style bowls was undertaken by Isabelle Drue in order to determine if the Atalla pottery was imported from Chavfn de Huantar or some other more northern cen­ter. Although the small sample precludes broad con­clusions, the distinctive mineralogical composition of the Atalla pottery rules out a Chavfn de Huantar prove­nance and points toward local production. Moreover, the two Atalla fragments that were analyzed have compositions dissimilar to ceramics coming from all six coastal and highland Early Horizon sites that have been studied thus far (Drue l998a, l 998b ). 
The main composition documented by the petro­graphic and EDXRF analysis of the Atalla sherds is volcanic sand. In anAtalla bowl decorated with a cir­cle-dot motif, similar to that from Chavfn de Huan­tar, there are volcanic nonplastic inclusions probably of andesite, within a microlithic paste; there are also ferromagnesian minerals and hornblende phe­nocrysts. In the other bowl fragment, which was dec­orated with punctation, there are many tuff fragments as well as abundant volcanic sand. Although tuff fragments are also found in some ceramics from Chavfn de Huantar, these are rhyolitic tuff unlike those incorporated into the two Atalla sherds. Based on the above and other more detailed observations, Drue (personal communication 2002) has concluded that the mineralogical and chemical compositions of the two Atalla sherds do not match any of the large inhomogeneous sample studied from Chavfn de Huantar (n = 79). In addition, neither of the Atalla sherds has components typical of the central coast sites such as Anc6n and Garagay, which incorporate coastal sand of mixed intrusive, volcanic, and sedi­mentary compositions (Drue et al. 2001). 
While some 85 percent of the early pottery in the Atalla assemblage bears strong resemblance to the Janabarriu phase assemblage from Chavfn de Huan­tar, there are two groups of early pottery that do not fit this pattern. One is the group of small bowls with post-fire incision described above. Bowls similar to these were found at Chavfn de Huantar in Janabar­riu phase contexts (Burger 1984: figure 374), but they are very rare in the large Janabarriu sample. These may have been imported into Chavfn de Huan­tar, particularly in light of the recent finding that some 30 percent of the pottery from both settlement and temple contexts at Chavfn de Huantar was not locally produced (Drue l 998a). The presence of such bowls is relatively common at Atalla, and it could be hypothesized that these constitute a distinctively local central highlands style that, on occasion, may have 


· 

been brought to Chavfn de Huantar. 
Another group of four fragments (Figure 1 Oa-<l) differs from the rest of the Atalla material because it features rows of small stamped circles with diame­ters of 3--6 mm. Most of these come from concave­curved bowls with everted rims. These pieces are very similar to the early materials recovered at the nearby sites of Chuncuimarca and Ticrapo in Huan­cavelica (Ravines 1969-1970, 1998), although they also have general similarities to findings from sites on the south coast such as Disco Verde and Cerrillos. 
The production at or near Atalla of a range of household cooking and serving vessels that inten­tionally emulate a cosmopolitan ceramic style pop­ular within the Chavfn sphere of interaction in both the coast and the highlands attests to a conscious identification of the site's inhabitants with more developed and prestigious groups to the north. It is significant that there is less similarity between the Atalla assemblage and the pottery styles of the coastal peoples living to the west, most notably the coeval early Paracas ceramics from the lea Valley (Menzel et al. 1964) and the Tajo style of the Nazca drainage (Silverman 1994, 1996). This is especially noteworthy considering the long history of close rela­tions between the central highlands and the south coast. 
As noted above, the ceramic style utilized atAtalla 
sets its users apart from the rural residents of villages 
in its own heartland. The proximity of Atalla to Chun­
cuimarca and the presence of what may be exotic 
ceramics from the Chuncuimarca area atAtalla sug­

terns of everyday socioeconomic interaction. It is unfortunate that no Initial Period assemblage is known from the Huancavelica area, but judging from Initial Period assemblages in neighboring highland (Junfn, Andahuaylas) and coastal (lea, Acan') regions, it can be suggested that the Chuncuimarca pottery style evolved out of local Initial Period pottery tra­ditions in Huancavelica, whereas the Atalla assem­blage resulted from the conscious emulation of a package of alien features developed in the north and popularized by Chavfn de Huantar. 
What would lead members of a local population to identify with alien groups to the north and break with their own cultural tradition and the ceramic style with which they were comfortable? It is sug­gested here that the A tall a ceramic assemblage sym­bolizes the emergence of a social group in Huancavelica whose prestige and identity were linked to a role as exchange partner with the elites of more northern civic-ceremonial centers, particu­larly that of Chavfn de Huantar. The ceramic style that the group at Atalla favored actively expressed this cosmopolitan identity. 
Cinnabar, Long-Distance Exchange, and the 
Establishment of Atalla 

On the strength of the ceramic style alone, it is pos­sible to argue that Atalla was incorporated into the Chavfn sphere of interaction. This was an important change for the Huancavelica region, and it is nec­essary to consider the reason for its incorporation. At the same time, Atalla is located far to the south of other major Early Horizon public centers in the highlands. The nearest such center with a Chavfn­related artifactual assemblage is the site of Kotosh, over 300 km to the north. Thus, Atalla can be viewed as lying on the periphery of Chavfn's core region. If a core-periphery perspective is adapted, as dis­cussed more fully in the next section, it is reason­able to ask what resources in theAtalla region would have been of special interest to the elites of Chavfn de Huantar and contemporary centers. The most likely factor was the presence in Huancavelica of cinnabar, a scarce raw material highly valued by the occupants of Chavfn de Huantar and other large Early Horizon centers. 
Cinnabar is mercuric sulfide (HgS), a heavy, bright red ore of mercury. It occurs in soft earthy masses that measure only 2.0-2.5 on the Mohs scale ofhardness. Cinnabar is usually concentrated in the fissures and cracks of mercury-rich geological deposits. The process required to extract cinnabar is straightforward. All that is necessary is to strip off the rock deposit that covers it, scrape the cinnabar deposits from the surrounding rock, and then grind it into powder, removing the impurities. Bright red mercuric sulfide, when used as a pigment, is some­times referred to as vermilion. Because of the inten­sity of its color, it is easy to distinguish cinnabar from more common red colorants such as hematite, and, consequently, it was highly valued in pre-His­panic Peru (Petersen 1970:6-7). 
The largest cinnabar deposits in all of Latin Amer­ica occur in the Huancavelica area. Historically, the Huancavelica district was the only area of Peru that furnished a large output of mercury ore. Throughout the colonial period, mercury played a critical role in silver production, and while some mercury occurs naturally, most had to be extracted by applying heat to the mercuric sulfide (cinnabar). The Huancavel­ica cinnabar deposits were so large and productive that, in the colonial period, the mercury from these deposits was exported to Bolivia and Chile; it was even transported as far north as Mexico (Berry and Singewald 1922:21 ; Lohman 1949). According to American geologists Berry and Singewald, "The Huancavelica district ranks among the world's great­est mercury producers" ( 1922: 16). 
Between 1571 and 1790, the tax records of the Spanish Crown document an output of over I 04 mil­lion pounds of mercury from Huancavelica, most of which was extracted from cinnabar. Some 4,000 indigenous laborers worked at the cinnabar mine at its zenith. The silver mines in Potosf and elsewhere in the central Andes were dependent on the mercury from Huancavelica, and the first indications of its depletion set off a search for alternative mercury ore deposits. Although some small deposits were encountered, no other mercury mine in Peru ever achieved large-scale production (Berry and Singe­wald 1922). 
The cinnabar deposits ofHuancavelica are found in an extensive area of mineralization surrounding the city. The greatest concentration of cinnabar is in a zone running for 18 km through the mountains to the south of the city (Berry and Singewald 1922: 18-20, plates II, V), but mercury ores also occur to the north and further to the south of Huancavel­ica. Deposits of cinnabar occur in an area exceeding 30 km2, and, consequently, it would not have been

practical to control the mining of this ore at the source. Moreover, the high altitude and harsh con­ditions of Huancavelica would have created logisti­cal difficulties for supporting the mining of this rare commodity. Thus, local groups accustomed to the puna environment and supported by high-altitude resources such as herds of llamas would have had an advantage in organizing the production and distrib­ution of the cinnabar. 
In the Huancavelica area, small pockets and vein­lets of cinnabar are encountered in extensive beds of fine-grained sandstone and compact limestone; it is often mixed in a yellow ferruginous clay and some­times with bitumen. The best known place of extrac­tion in the colonial period was the Santa Barbara mine, located 2.5 km south of the city of Huan­cavelica (3,972 mas!). Guaman Poma (1980:966) provides a memorable drawing of the colonial city of Huancavelica with the cinnabar mine (socab6n) featured prominently on the mountain overlooking the city. In the illustration, the ore is being hauled down from the mine by human porters and llamas (Figure 11 ). 
According to traditional historical accounts, the mercury deposits of Huancavelica were discovered by Enrique Garces in 1559 (Lohman 1948). How­ever, the cinnabar deposits in Huancavelica were exploited long before the Spanish conquest, and, apparently, the Spaniards learned of them from the local population. When the cinnabar deposits at Mt. Chacllatacana south of the city were first explored, the Spanish found evidence of prehispanic exploita­tion, dating to before the time of the Incas (Jimenez de la Espada 1965: 118). According to the Spanish chronicler Cantos de Andrade, the Spaniards were particularly impressed by evidence that the indige­nous people had penetrated the surface in search of cinnabar and had dug caves and deep tunnels using only wooden stakes and deer antlers (Ruiz 1977:30). 
In early historical writings of the Spaniards, there is general agreement that the principal use of cinnabar during prehispanic times was as a pigment known by the Quechua term limpi (or llimpi) or paria. This pigment was used by indigenous peoples for facial and body painting (see also Garcilaso 1991 :555-556; cf. Petersen 1970:60; Yacoleff and Muelle 1934: 157) and the decoration of ceremonial objects (Acosta 1987: 161 ). The most important colo­nial Quechua dictionary, by Diego Gonzales Hol­guin, includes the word llimppicuni, which he defines as "to paint one's face and daub oneself with ver­milion" (1989:213). 2 
A detailed account of the use of the bright red pig­ment produced from cinnabar appears in the work of Father Martfn de Mania ( 1946:306). Mania notes that in Inca times, cinnabar or llimpi was used as body paint or in religious rituals but not for the extraction of silver from ore. He notes that the vermilion paint was applied to the face, hands, arms, and legs for the ceremonies. 
The utilization of cinnabar pigment can be traced back to the Early Horizon, and its use during this period has been confirmed on the coast and in the highlands. On the north coast, for example, the bright red pigment used in Cupisnique burials contains traces of cinnabar (Larco 1941: 163). Similarly, a cemetery to the north of Ocucaje in lea, along Peru's south coast, has yielded the valves of two Con­cholepus concholelpus shells filled with cinnabar (Petersen 1970:6, figure 7). 
In the northern highlands, the 1989 investigations at the Early Horizon center of Kuntur Wasi encoun­tered a series of rich tombs of men and a woman dat­ing to the Early Horizon (Kuntur Wasi and Copa Phases). Significantly, in both phases, the faces of the buried individuals and some of the gold objects accompanying them were covered with cinnabar (Onuki 1997:80, 82, 89, 96, 110). In only one case, possibly that of an outsider (Tumba 5), was cinnabar absent. The regularity of use and the patterning within these tombs suggest that cinnabar played an important symbolic role in the mortuary ritual of the Kuntur Wasi elite and that face painting with ver­milion, as described in the Spanish chronicles, had been going on for several millennia. 
At Chavin de Huantar, a stone ear spool of pol­ished chlorite was recovered from Janabarriu phase refuse in the settlement surrounding the temple. It had traces ofbright red pigment, and chemical analy ­sis confirmed that it was cinnabar (Burger 1984: 198). Clearly, cinnabar was known and valued by the large northern centers in the highlands. However, because the most common prehispanic use of cinnabar appears to have been as fugitive body paint, we would not expect it to be encountered in the archaeological record except in the case of burials or in those con­texts related to its preparation. As a consequence of this, cinnabar use has probably been underestimated because of its low archaeological visibility. 
As indicated, the major Huancavelica cinnabar

to the mercury deposits themselves. In 1966, Rog­ger Ravines ( 1969-1 970) investigated Chun­cuimarca, a small site on the lower slopes of the Cerro Potocchi near the northern edge of the city of Huancavelica. Located within the mineralization zone where cinnabar deposits occur, Chuncuimarca yielded thick deposits of Early Horizon ceramics mixed with obsidian tools and other lithics as well as the bones of deer, viscachas, and camelids. Although the pottery was coarser and less elaborate, both Ravines (1969-1970:237) and Matos (1959) have concluded that the early materials from Chun­cuimarca are coeval with those from Atalla. In fact, as already noted, the dominant style at Chuncuimarca resembles the small group of pottery at Atalla described above, which features small stamped cir­cles (Figure 1 Oa-d). 
Ravines concludes that Chuncuimarca was a per­manent agricultural village with a strong emphasis on hunting. In his excavations, however, he uncov­ered an abundance of granite-or basalt-grinding implements that were made by pecking and polish­ing. All of these ground-stone tools show evidence of having been utilized to prepare red colorants, prob­ably cinnabar, rather than foodstuffs (Ravines 
1969-1 970:25 1-252). The high frequency of tools for grinding red pigment in the Chuncuimarca assem­blage has no known analogue at other "Formative" Peruvian archaeological sites. Given the location of Chuncuimarca within the zone of naturally occur­ring mercury ore, we hypothesize that Chuncuimarca was a village specializing in the extraction and pro­cessing of the cinnabar for export. 
The natural route for distributing the cinnabar pigment into the central and northern highlands would have been down the Jehu River into the Man­taro Valley. As we have noted, Atalla is located on a hill overlooking the Ichu River, less than one day's walk downstream from Chuncuimarca. Journeys on foot of 15 km are considered insignificant by con­temporary rural residents of Huancavelica, and it is unlikely that the distance between Chuncuimarca and Atalla would have been considered an obstacle during the Early Horizon. Atalla would have been in a good position to control the movement of goods 
being transported toward the Mantaro drainage. Moreover, Atalla is lower in elevation than Chun­cuimarca and closer to productive agricultural lands. These factors would have made its location more pro­pitious for a large, permanent center than the harsh environment adjacent to the mercury ore deposits. At the same time, the inhabitants at Atalla had easy access to rich pasturelands and the llama herds that would have been essential in transporting the cinnabar to points north. 
During our study of the collection of the Museo Nacional de Antropologfa, Arqueologfa e Historia (MNAAH), in Lima, we encountered ajar filled with ground cinnabar pigment (#0.C. 197) that had been collected at the archaeological site of Atalla on August 15, 1955; this is the same day that Espejo made his surface collections at Atalla. It seems rea­sonable to presume that the bright red pigment sam­ple, like the separately accessioned ceramic collections at the MNAAH, was the product of his site reconnaissance. The context in which the ground cinnabar powder was encountered is unknown, but the quantity is considerable, and this find lends cred­ibility to the suggestion that vermilion pigment may have been brought to Atalla for distribution to points north from the cinnabar deposits and production workshops at Chuncuimarca. 
If Atalla played a special role in procuring and distributing cinnabar for the Chavin sphere of inter­action, other goods might have also been involved. Obsidian, for example, does not occur naturally in the north-central or northern highlands, but it nev­ertheless was used for cutting tools during the Early Horizon in the Mantaro drainage and even at Chavin de Huantar (Browman 1975; Burger and Asaro 1979; Burger et al. 1984). There was a sharp increase in obsidian distribution at this time in the northern high­lands, perhaps as a function of the incorporation of the south-central highlands into the Chavfn sphere of interaction and the general augmentation of social contacts and exchange during the apogee of Chavin. Recently, the major geologic source of this obsidian, known as the Quispisisa source, was located near the modern villages of Huanca Sancos and Sacsamarca in central Ayacucho (Burger and Glascock 2000a), roughly 100 km south of Atalla. Obsidian from this source was being transported from the Caracha drainage into the Mantaro and, eventually, on to Chavfn de Huantar; in small quantities, it reached even to Pacopampa. It is unclear whether Atalla 
played a role in this process, but its location would have been advantageous in this regard, particularly if related activities were already under way there in regard to the more local cinnabar deposits. 
Obsidian is common at sites in Huancavelica, and

it was the most common raw material for the chipped lithics recovered from both Chuncuimarca and Atalla. Based on the popularity of Quispisisa obsid­ian north of Ayacucho, we have hypothesized that the volcanic glass found at Atalla was procured from the Quispisisa source rather than the closer Puzolana source near the city of Ayacucho (Burger and Glas­cock 2000b) or some other deposit. As an initial test of this assumption, we analyzed a small sample (n = 2) of flakes collected at Atalla by neutron activa­tion at the Research Reactor Center, University of Missouri, Columbia (MURR). The results on the obsidian samples recovered by Matos at Atalla con­firm that the material was obtained from Quispisisa (Michael D. Glascock, personal communication 
1999). Was Atalla involved in the acquisition and transport of this volcanic glass from the Quispisisa source for more than local consumption? Once again, excavations at Atalla could help provide the answer to this question. 
World Systems and the 
Modeling of the Chavin Horizon 


For methodological as well as theoretical reasons, contemporary archaeology has been most comfort­able analyzing sociocultural change within a nar­rowly defined universe, frequently that of a single valley. However, in dealing with more complex soci­eties, archaeologists, like historians and sociologists, have been forced to recognize that such small ana­lytical units are insufficient to the task. At the very least, the broader territory of a polity or state needs to be taken into account. But what of those phe­nomena that appear to transcend polities and ethnic groups just as they crosscut drainages and regions? 
As research on the Chavin horizon advanced over the last half century, it became evident that the spread of this "horizon style" was associated with profound changes in religious ideology, social identity, eco­nomic interaction, and sociopolitical organization in many parts of what is now central and northern Peru. One of the authors, Burger (l 988, 1992, 1993), fol­lowing the lead of several colleagues (Cordy-Collins 
1976; Patterson 197 1), has hypothesized that some of these changes could be the result of the spread of a religious cult from its center at the Temple of Chavfn de Huantar to branch shrines in distant por­tions of the highlands and coast. Drawing on ethno­historical and ethnographic analogies, this model offers a partial explanation for some of the observed cultural changes, but it does not fully account for many of the socioeconomic transformations associ­ated with the Chavfn horizon. While the spread of religious cults often creates an ideological environ­ment compatible with expanded social and economic interaction, there are other factors that must be con­sidered in order to achieve a more complete under­standing of the processes involved. 

Outside of the central Andes, many investigators when confronted by the problems of working on a pan-regional scale of analysis have promoted a "World Systems" approach as a productive model for dealing with macroregional phenomena in com­plex precapitalist societies. Although these scholars vary in their application of this framework, there is consensus that by focusing on the differences between the organization and interests of the core elite and those of peoples living in the periphery of a World System, we can begin to explain some of the patterns of change that occurred. The term world in this context is not synonymous with global but, rather, refers to interconnections or divisions oflabor that are great in scale and consequently cross cul­tural and political boundaries. As defined by Hall and Chase-Dunn ( 1993 ), to constitute a "World Sys­tem," the interactions between societies within the system must be important for the reproduction of the structures of the internal units and importantly affect changes that occur in these local structures; the interactions cannot be trivial or intermittent. According to this perspective, societies on the periphery will be modified in their structure by their incorporation into the World System and, ultimately, experience radical modifications with the decline of the macroregional system. 
The relation between the core and the periphery is assumed to revolve around the acquisition of val­ued resources that can be used by the core's domi­nant groups for political advantage. Those living in the periphery may likewise find benefits from their relations with core societies, although the linkage is inherently asymmetric in character. Unlike the inter­action sphere concept (Caldwell 1964; MacNeish et al. 1975; Streuver and Houart 1972) or the peer­polity model (Renfrew 1996), the World System or core-periphery approach recognizes that the pres­ence of inequality both within and between societies is critical to analysis, as is geopolitical position within a World System. 
The popularity among archaeologists of World

Systems models over the last two decades is attested to by an abundant literature (e.g., Blanton and Fein­man 1984; Champion 1995; Chase-Dunn and Hall 1991; Hall and Chase-Dunn 1993; Patterson 1990; Peregrine and Feinman 1996; Sanderson 1995), despite objections by its principal advocate, the soci­ologist and historian Immanuel Wallerstein (1995) (see also McGuire 1996). While many anthropolo­gists, archaeologists, and sociologists believe that it is possible to apply a World Systems framework to the precapitalist world, most also have recognized the need to modify the World Systems approach as set forward by Wallerstein so that it can applied to a broader range of sociopolitical contexts and histor­ical transformations. Such modifications acknowl­edge that a pattern of multiple cores, rather than a single core, characterizes most of the ancient world, including the prehispanic Andes. They also take into account that in precapitalist settings the long-dis­tance exchange of prestige goods can be of consid­erable importance because of the special place these items had in the consolidation and maintenance of alliances and political power (Schneider 1977). Most anthropologists and archaeologists also recognize that within most, perhaps all, precapitalist World 
Systems there were multiple forms of sociopolitical and economic organization and that the articulation of these different patterns with each other was one of the dynamic forces for change of a World System (Patterson 1990). Given the large number of these modifications and their significant difference from the original World Systems framework proposed by Wallerstein, it might be more appropriate to refer to the resulting framework as a core-periphery per­spective rather than an archaeological application of World Systems theory. 
Archaeologists working in the central Andes, in contrast to those in North America, Mesoamerica, and the Near East (Peregrine and Feinman 1996), have been slow to explore the application of this perspec­tive (for exceptions, see Burger and Matos 1989; Pat­terson 1990), and some explicitly reject it. For example, in a recent article, Goldstein (2000) has argued that this approach is not useful for understanding the presence of Pucara and Paracas-N asca ceramic and textile traits in the Moquegua Valley. While Goldstein may be cor­rect in regard to prehistoric Moquegua, the core-periph­ery perspective does seem to have potential in the case of the Chavfn horizon, particularly for understanding cases such as Atalla. 
Is a core-periphery approach applicable to the Andean Formative? The answer to this question will be determined by whether the insights provided by such an orientation are greater than its drawbacks. Clearly, much unwanted intellectual luggage was intimately tied to the specific Old World historical case for which World Systems was developed. As one departs from this particular instance in time, space, and culture, it becomes necessary, as we have done earlier in this section, to offer a litany of caveats dis­associating the modified World Systems perspective from the specifics of Wallerstein's (1974) model. Although the creation of a more generic and anthro­pologically informed version of World Systems has seemed justified and attractive to many scholars, to others these efforts seem forced and misguided. Ulti­mately, whether it should be done is a question of intellectual taste and the willingness to treat the model as a flexible heuristic device rather than a doc­trine set in stone. One could finesse the situation by using other terms, such as centers and fringes, and by avoiding explicit references to Wallerstein and other antecedents; to adopt such an option, however, would lack intellectual integrity, for the model pre­sented here is an outgrowth of Wallerstein' s proposal and the constructive debate that ensued. 
Perhaps the other major concern about utilizing this approach in the case of Atalla is a concern about whether "Formative" central Andean societies, such as those of the "Chavfn" centers of the Early Hori­zon, have the structural features that would result in the establishment of core-periphery relationships. Some scholars have attempted to "type" the Forma­tive societies of the central Andes as "chiefdoms" or "complex chiefdoms" (Stanish 2001), and many assume that nothing less than state-level societies would be compatible with a World Systems frame­work. Many other scholars, including the senior author, Burger, are fundamentally skeptical of such concerns because of their reservations about the term chiefdom and their perception that it has become more of an obstacle than a tool. It is important to note that the so-called chiefdoms offirst millennium B.C. Peru do not resemble, in any material sense, the ethnographic cases on which this "stage" has been constructed. Moreover, it has been argued that chief­doms, as currently formulated by Wright and others, do not precede the emergence of states but, rather, are alternate trajectories to it (Yoffee 1997). 
More importantly from the perspective of this arti-

cle, by the middle of the first millennium B.C., cen­ters such as Chavin de Huantar appear to have been incipient small-scale states judging from their com­paratively large resident populations, social stratifi­cation, economic specialization, active long-distance exchange programs, and other features (Burger 1992: 165-227). It was the existence of real socioe­conomic inequality and an elite that consciously worked to maintain its power and prestige that cre­ated the structural conditions during the Early Hori­zon that led to the search for rare raw materials outside the multiple cores in the northern highlands of Peru. The identification of such rare natural resources and the incorporation of these crucial resource areas into a World System resulted in a situation in which unequal development became a critical feature in the transformation of both the multiple cores and the periphery. In contrast, the "Formative" societies of the second millennium (also known as the Initial period) do not display evidence of such conspicuous inequality, and we would be wary about applying a core-periphery perspective to these societies. 
One of the most frequent criticisms of a World Systems perspective is about its assumption of a fun­damental asymmetry in power relations between the core and the periphery. In the case of Atalla, such asymmetry would seem justified given its small size and population compared with those of northern cen­ters such as Chavin de Huantar, Pacopampa, and Kuntur Wasi. Despite this, it would be unjustified to assume that asymmetry necessarily translates into complete domination, particularly given the large distance that separates the two areas. The freedom that distance provides would have favored consider­able agency on the part of the Atalla residents, and the city's emulation of cultural features such as ceramic style and cut-stone masonry probably reflected internal volition rather than external coer­cion. Indeed, it might be accurate to describe the relationship between the two areas, in the words of Michael Dietler, as "a complex history of interaction and entanglement" (1998:298). Yet our rejection of a "mechanistically reductionist, structurally overde­termined" version of World Systems does not dimin­ish the fundamentally asymmetric nature of the relationship or the critical role that the production and transport of a rare raw material probably had in the relationship between a site on the periphery, such as Atalla, and centers in the core area, such as Chavfn de Huantar. Of course, the need for a rare commod­

ity such as cinnabar opened up new opportunities for the residents of the periphery to acquire ideas and goods that they wanted, and, in the case of Atalla, the end result may have been mutually beneficial rather than exploitative. 
In a recent formulation, Gil Stein ( 1998:228) has suggested that, in many cases, a distance-parity model has greater explanatory value than a World Systems model because of the diminishing power of the core at a great distance under preindustrial con­ditions. He recognizes, however, that the World Sys­tems model still has utility in those cases in which there is considerable difference in the technological and demographic levels of the two interacting zones. He also acknowledges that the presence of low trans­portation costs likewise favors a World Systems rather than a distance-parity model. Given the avail­ability of llamas for long-distance trade caravans at a "low cost," because the animals could graze on available puna grasses and can be herded with only a small investment of human labor (Flores Ochoa 1968), and the considerable demographic and tech­nological differences between Atalla and sites such as Chavin de Huantar, there would seem to be justi­fication in considering a World Systems model even from the critical perspective of Stein. 
Although Stein ( 1998) may be correct in his claim that World Systems theory and its variants may be overused and, in some cases, inappropriate! y applied, a World Systems perspective does seem to have potential in explaining the nature and chronology of the early occupation at Atalla. This is not to say that it offers a comprehensive analytical framework for all the multiple modes of interaction subsumed within the Chavin horizon. In many cases, the char­acter of Early Horizon centers and their relationship to Chavin de Huantar can be understood using mod­els of religious networks (Burger 1988) and peer­polity interaction (Renfrew 1996) rather than a core-periphery perspective (Burger 1993). The fact that this may be the case, however, does not under­mine the value of applying a World Systems per­spective to specific instances such as Atalla, where it does seem to shed light on the processes at work. 
Conclusions and Discussion 
The evidence presented in this article confirms the con­clusions of Matos and other early investigators that Atallaconstitutes an unusually imposing center whose history is closely linked with that ofChavfn de Huan-

tar and the sphere of interaction associated with that center during the Early Horizon. The research that has been carried out in the central highlands since Atalla' s discovery in 1955 has only reinforced the impression thatAtalla is larger than other coeval sites in the region and that there is no local antecedent for the public architecture at this site. Since Atalla's discovery, numerous full-coverage site surveys and excavations have been carried out, particularly in the Departments of Junfn (Parsons et al. 2000) and Ayacucho (Lumbr­eras 1974, 1981; Ochatoma 1998). In a synthesis of the information available for the central highlands, Burger ( 1992) has characterized the entire region as a cultural backwater during the Initial period and Early Horizon and has contrasted it with the more densely populated and culturally advanced northern highland and coastal regions. A more recent review of pub­lished investigations of the Formative (i.e., Initial period and Early Horizon) in the central highlands led Jeffrey Parsons and his colleagues (2000: 101) to con­clude that the existing settlement pattern data support this position. In Junfn and in northern highlandAyacu­cho, Formative sites are remarkably rare, and settle­ments that can be definitely dated to the Initial period are almost absent. Parsons and his colleagues (2000: l 02) argue that this pattern, which reoccurs in numerous studies, cannot be explained as a result of the survey methodology employed and that it sug­gests a light population. Moreover, Initial period and Early Horizon sites are rare or absent in the ceja de selva (eastern slope cloud forest) as well as in the puna and kichwa (lower valley) habitats of the cen­tral highlands. 
The conclusion that Burger (1992) and Parsons et al. (2000) reach is that prior to and during the Early Horizon, the lifeways in the central highlands stood in marked contrast to those among the flour­ishing intermontane valley cultures of the northern highlands and adjacent coast. Evidence of the con­tinuous use of puna caves and lakeside sites suggests 
a small population dependent on a mixed strategy that probably included herding, hunting, high-alti­tude farming, and the continued collection of wild resources. These autonomous high-altitude groups left little evidence of developing more complex socioeconomic organization as the result of internal processes. 
The establishment of Atalla appears to be a local response to stimuli provided from the rapidly expanding centers in the northern highlands, such as 
Chavfn de Huantar, Kuntur Wasi, and Pacopampa (Morales 1998b; Rosas and Shady 1970). The process of increased socioeconomic stratification at these centers, as evidenced by the unequal distribu­tion of highly valued goods (Burger 1992; Miller and Burger 1995) and the presence of elaborate elite tombs with rich grave goods (Onuki 1995, 1997), stimulated the search for and trade in raw materials that could be used to enhance and reinforce the sta­tus of the newly institutionalized elites and could serve as exotic symbols of the religious ideology underlying the status of these individuals. Accord­ing to anthropologist Kenneth Hirth (1978:37), an increased demand for long-distance trade goods by the elites of stratified centers often led to the estab­lishment of gateway communities located along nat­ural corridors of communication. Such gateway communities often occur at the critical passages near areas of high mineral productivity and at the inter­face of different technologies or levels of socio­complexity. While Hirth uses the concept of gateway community to explain the emergence of Chal­catzingo within the Olmec sphere of interaction, he recognizes that this case is an example of a more gen­eral phenomenon. 
The locally produced ceramics of Atalla, which appear to emulate the Janabarriu phase pottery from Chavin de Huantar, suggest that the local population living in the high grasslands of what is now Huan­cavelica consciously attempted to identify with the peoples living at the monumental center to the north. At the same time, construction at Atalla of circular dwellings and the association of burials with these 
dwellings demonstrate the local character of the set­tlement's inhabitants. Circular dwellings dating to the Early Horizon are known from the Huancavelica area (Ravines 1969-1970) and the neighboring Man­taro (Browman 1977:2) but not the highlands near Chavfn de Huantar or the neighboring coast (Burger 1984; Pozorski and Pozorski 1987). Similarly, house burials have no known analogue at Chavin de Huan­
tar or any of the other northern centers during the Early Horizon. Thus, it is evident that Atalla was not a "colony" or "enclave" of Chavfn de Huantar or one of the other northern centers. 
Atalla's emergence as a public center during the Early Horizon is hypothesized to have been a func­tion of the role of its residents in the procurement and distribution of vermilion pigment produced at the massive cinnabar deposits 15 km to the west in

Atalla's hinterland. Atalla's involvement in chan­neling obsidian from the Quispisisa source area, a major deposit of volcanic glass located 100 km to the south in what is now central Ayacucho, into the Mantaro drainage and beyond, may have been an additional factor. 
The insights provided by a core-periphery per­spective may be relevant in modeling the asymmet­ric relationship between the stratified societies of the northern highlands at sites like Chavfn de Huantar, which consumed the cinnabar and obsidian, and the less developed groups of the central highlands that were responsible for the building of Atalla. The social differentiation implied by the appearance of the cen­ter at Atalla can be interpreted as a response to stim­uli created in the Chavfn heartland as the priestly elites sought exotic products that could serve as emblems of their status and as distinctive symbols for their religious ideology. These exotics could also be employed strategically as gifts to consolidate or create alliances. Rare and easily recognizable items like cinnabar and obsidian, which, undernormal cir­cumstances, could not be obtained by populations outside the central highlands, would have been ideal in this regard, particularly given the general lack of contact between the northern and central highlands before this time. The formation of a gateway com­munity like Atalla at the entry into the Mantaro drainage could have helped resolve the challenge of insuring a dependable flow of cinnabar, obsidian, and other exotic goods from the central highlands into the northern core area. 
Although this hypothesis identifies a macrore­gional scale of analysis as essential in making sense of Atalla, the site is still understood as a local adap­tation to a new social and economic setting. Not sur­prisingly, the form and architectural features of the site reflect the cultural history and aspirations of the local leaders. Thus, Atalla resembles neither north­ern centers like Chavfn de Huantar nor nearby vil­lages like Chuncuimarca. On the contrary, Atalla was amaterial expression of sociocultural and economic innovation by a local population. The coordination and regulation of the procurement and long-distance trade in cinnabar and other products would have required the emergence of a distinctive social group with a new set of relations to the more rural peoples involved in the actual mining of these materials. The creation of large perimeter walls and construction of public buildings of dressed stone blocks, such as the "temple" on the site summit, are innovations from a local perspective and can be seen as symbolic expres­sions of the new and unprecedented status of Atalla's residents. It is not surprising that such a group chose to incorporate the alien technique of cut-stone archi­tecture into its public constructions, much as the res­idents favored a ceramic style that emulated that of their more prestigious exchange partners to the north. 
The abandonment of Atalla at the end of the Early Horizon is roughly coeval with the decline of the Chavfn de Huantar center and the abandonment of its public architecture. This correlation does not appear to be coincidental, and it suggests the degree to whichAtalla's prosperity was dependent on its spe­cial exchange relationship with the larger Chavfn sphere of interaction. If this conclusion is correct, cinnabar pigment should be rare or absent in the remains of the post-Chavfn occupations at Chavfn de Huantar. 
Given the lack of excavation at Atalla, the fore­going discussion should be considered as a source of hypotheses for future study. We hope that it will serve to stimulate interest in more intensive research at the site and help formulate questions that can be tested through such additional investigations. For example, how much social differentiation was engen­dered at Atalla as a result of its articulation with Chavfn de Huantar? How long did this new, more hierarchical configuration last after the collapse of the centers in the core area and the exchange net­work associated with them? What products were being procured or produced by the people of Atalla for export, and how did these new demands affect the local subsistence strategy? What was being acquired by the peoples of Atalla in exchange for these goods? 
Matos ( 1999) has observed that in the central highlands, the most significant developments during the Early Horizon occurred in the high grasslands of the puna and that the neighboring lower valleys appear to have been of secondary importance. The emergence of Atalla, the first major public center in this region, within the lower portion of the puna zone is eloquent testimony to the importance of these high grasslands, and future study of Atalla should consider the special role of those living in this environment in the production of high-altitude cultigens such as oca, ulluco, mashua, quinoa, potatoes, and cafiiwa; processed foods, such as ch 'arki and chufiu; and leather and woven products. In addition, high-alti-

tude herders from this zone may have played a crit­ical role in the procurement, processing, concentra­tion, and transport of rare raw materials to more developed northern centers. 
Some of the issues raised here will require the application of new methods in order to test the hypotheses in question. Among the problems that must be addressed is how to determine whether the vermilion pigment found at Early Horizon sites in northern Peru was brought from the cinnabar deposit in Huancavelica described in this article or from one of the minor deposits documented but never inten­sively exploited during colonial times. Although there is no historical or archaeological evidence for the use of the latter in prehispanic times, in contrast to the Huancavelica case, it would be premature to assume a priori that all of the cinnabar utilized before the Spanish conquest necessarily came from Huan­cavelica. Recently, cinnabar was identified in chrono­logically later elite burials at Batan Grande in the Lambayeque-La Leche drainage, but the excavator believes that the source of the bright red pigment may be in the Azogues-Cuenca region in southern Ecuador (Shimada 2000:58) rather than in Huan­cavelica. Because cinnabar deposits were formed at different times in dissimilar geological settings, it should be possible to distinguish among sources of cinnabar (mercuric sulfide) through the study of rare metals and other impurities linked to the local geol­ogy; these should be present in trace amounts in ver­milion pigment. Such sourcing studies, utilizing instrumental neutron activation, X-ray fluorescence, or some other analogous technique, have been suc­cessful in dealing with a range of materials, includ­ing obsidian, jade, turquoise, and ceramics, but they have yet to be applied to the study of cinnabar. 
As noted, some scholars have attempted to par­tially explain the spread of "Chavfn influence" as a result of the expansion of a religious cult. Such regional cults played important roles in creating new patterns of interaction and in providing an ideolog­ical basis for modifying the preexisting cultures (Burger 1988). In many historical cases, increased trade followed the spread of major religions ("trade follows the Hadj"), but in other cases increased social and economic interaction set the stage for the intro­duction of new religious systems (Burger I 993). At the present time, we do not know whether the peo­ple of Atalla ever adopted the Chavfn cult. The con­centric circles and other geometric motifs on the Janabarriu phase pottery style of Chavfn de Huantar refer to the pelage markings of the jaguar, a central figure in Chavin religious cosmology, but it cannot be assumed that the inhabitants of Atalla were aware of this symbolic meaning when they emulated these motifs in the production of their local pottery. Hope­fully, excavations on Atalla's summit will someday provide us with the answer to this and some of the other questions raised in this article. Ultimately, future studies atAtalla and coeval Early Horizon vil­lages will also make it possible for us to contextual­ize Atalla' s interaction with the northern centers and understand it from the standpoint of the social and cultural logic of the puna societies of Huancavelica with their own cosmologies, institutions, and com­plex histories (Dietler I 998).
