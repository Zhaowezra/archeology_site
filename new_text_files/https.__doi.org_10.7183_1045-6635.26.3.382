The Middle Horizon (ca. A.D. 600-JlOO) was a period of great change in the Andes, with much of Peru connected through long-distance exchange and widely shared Wari styles and practices. Recent research has begun to detail the transformations that occurred within the period, leading to questions about the development of the Wari state and its shifting relationships with outlying areas over time. This article expands this research by exploring the temporal differences 
within a funerary assemblage at La Real, a site in the Majes Valley of southern Peru. The artifacts and human remains from La Real are used to explore Middle Horizon dynamism in relation to both the surging interregional interaction of the period and emergent social stratification in the valley. Mortuary profiles and sublethal violence remain fairly constant throughout the period, but lethal violence significantly increases in the late Middle Horizon. There are also significant changes over time in the presence of exotic goods and other items, reflecting an increase in craft specialization, the adoption of Wari-related styles and practices, and the development of a more regionally oriented economy. The role of the Wari state in these changes, although unclear, may relate to attempts by Wari leaders to manipulate the long-distance movement of a restricted group of artifacts and resources. 
El Horizonte Media (ca. 600-1100 d.C.)fue un periodo de gran cambio en las Andes, con la mayorfa def Peru unido gracias al intercambio a larga distancia ya las estilos y practicas Wari, extensamente compartidos. Las ultimas investigaciones han empezado a detallar las transformaciones significativas que ocurrieron durante este periodo, que han llevado a preguntas con respecto al desarrollo def estado Wari y su relaci6n cambiante con las areas de su alrededor durante el Horizonte media, temprano y tard(o. Este artfculo desarrolla esta investigaci6n explorando las diferencias temporales dentro de Los ajuares funerarios en La Real, un sitio localizado en el Valle Majes, al sur def Peru. Los artefactos y las restos humanos def sitio son utilizados para explorar el dinamismo def periodo en relaci6n al surgimiento de la interacci6n interregional de la era y el contexto local de la estratificaci6n social emergente del valle. Los perfiles demograficos y Los traumas Jrecuentemente rela­cionados con la violencia fueron comunes a traves de este periodo, aunque la violencia fetal aument6 significativamente durante la segunda mitad del Horizonte Medio. Tambien existen cambios significativos a traves del tiempo en la presencia de bienes ex6ticos y otros artfculos que reflejan un aumento en la especializaci6n de artesanias, la adopci6n de estilos y prcicticas Wari, as( coma el desarrollo de una economfa regionalmente orientada. El rol del estado Wari durante estos cambios, aunque poco claro, puede relacionarse con las tentativas de los lfderes Wari de manipular el movimiento a larga distancia de un grupo restringido de artefactos y recursos.

areas continues to be debated (Bergh and Jennings 2012:7-15), but most scholars suggest that Huari was the capital of an empire that conquered, if not controlled, many parts of this region (e.g., Bergh, ed. 2012; Isbell 2008; Schreiber 1992). 
Although initially conceived as an era of sig­nificant change (Menzel 1964; Rowe 1962), the Middle Horizon has often been treated in practice as a homogeneous block of time, its sweeping transformations glossed across five centuries. Re­cent research is reemphasizing the dynamism of the Middle Horizon, underlining the need for more fine-grained analyses of changes in local practices and of influences deriving from interaction with the wider Wari world. This article builds on these efforts by using two funerary contexts from the Majes Valley of southern Peru to show how local, regional, and interregional relationships shifted between the first and second halves of the Middle Horizon. The changing material culture in the as­semblage exemplifies the dynamism of the period, while the more consistent trauma profiles hint at the durability of certain practices that may have had deadly consequences. 
The Andean Middle Horizon 
The term "Middle Horizon" was coined by John 
H. Rowe (1962:48), who introduced the widely used chronological sequence of the Initial period through Late Horizon. Though often forgotten, the original purpose of Rowe's article was to move away from describing successive cultural stages "defined on the basis of several different features which are supposed to occur together" (Rowe 1962:41). Like many subsequent scholars, he suggested that the initial spread of the Middle Horizon "may well represent a military conquest" (Rowe 1956: 150), but that this conquest was not instantaneous and the polity and its provinces were not unchanging. Rowe (1962:48) worried that the rich variation lurking within chronologi­cal periods would be subsumed under monolithic stages of cultural development. 
As Richard Schaedel (1993:252) noted, Rowe's Middle Horizon concept has ironically teetered between being "a helpful tool of analysis" and "a balloon of homogeneity masking a plethora of built-in assumptions." There has been a tendency to treat the period as an undifferentiated stage of cultural development (Rice 1993). Yet there also has been recognition of profound cultural changes within Middle Horizon Peru since Dorothy Men­zel's (1964) ceramic seriation divided the Middle Horizon into four phases. Menzel noted stylistic distinctions between her first two phases-the only ones associated with the Wari phenomena­suggesting a reorganization of interregional in­teractions a century or two after the founding of Huari (Menzel 1964:35-36). 
Subsequent research at Huari and many other sites has confirmed that considerable variation existed between the early and late Middle Horizon (Jennings 2010a; Jennings and Castillo 2014; Kaulicke and Isbell 2001, 2002). This concern is highlighted by the identification of a substantive, but still very poorly understood, shift in the rela­tionship between the Wari heartland and outlying regions during the ninth century A.D. (Jennings 2010b:5; Schreiber 2001:89; Tung 2007b:253­254; Williams 2001:80-81). This article con­tributes to our understanding of this ninth-century transition through the analysis of human remains and associated artifacts from two funerary contexts at the site of La Real in southern Peru (Figure 1 ): a mortuary cave and a semi-subterranean structure. 
Salvage excavations at La Real by the National Institute of Culture (now Ministry of Culture) of Peru documented a mortuary tradition shared by both contexts that involved the intentional de­struction and dispersal of mummy bundles. One of the contexts (the cave) dates to the early Middle Horizon, however, while the other (the structure) dates to the late Middle Horizon. The significant differences in the artifact assemblages reveal tem­poral shifts in the relationships that the people buried at La Real had both with each other and with those living farther away. These data suggest the development of a more regionally organized political economy by the late Middle Horizon that linked some of the coastal and highland groups of Arequipa. Although our research doc­uments the arrival of Wari ideas and material cul­ture, the data are still equivocal in regards to the nature of the role of the Wari state in the interac­tion network within Arequipa. Nonetheless, our results show significant changes in many aspects of the material culture of this community from the early to late Middle Horizon. This observation highlights the importance of treating the era as a

period of dynamic change rather than as a static stage of cultural development. 
The Funerary Contexts at La Real 
In 1995, a bulldozer accidently exposed two Mid­dle Horizon burial contexts at La Real. The vil­lage had long been known for its exquisite Middle Horizon artifacts (Garcia and Bustamente 1990), and the salvage excavations directed by Pablo de la Vera uncovered a similar quality of ceramics, textiles, metals, and other objects associated with the remains of mummy bundles and trophy heads. The human remains were subsequently analyzed by Tung (2003, 2007a, 2007b, 2012a, 2012b; Tung and del Castillo 2005), while the artifacts were studied by a team directed by Willy Yepez Alvarez and Justin Jennings (2012). 
Sealed one meter below the ash from the Huaynaputina eruption of AD. 1600, the La Real burial contexts were last accessed during the Mid­dle Horizon (Yepez 2012a). The first of these contexts was a cave filled fo a depth of almost two meters with the remains of mummy bundles and funerary offerings (Figure 2). The stratigra­phy within the cave suggests that the bundles had been tom apart in multiple episodes and their as­sociated artifacts often broken, dispersed, and oc­casionally burned. These disturbed mummy bun­dles were then pushed deeper into the cave to make room for additional ones (Yepez 2012a). 
The second, chronologically later, context was a two-room semi-subterranean structure located a few meters in front of the mortuary cave (see Figure 2). The human remains and artifacts appear to have been the remnants of mummy bundles and associated offerings that also had been in­tentionally destroyed (Yepez 2012a). One of the two critical differences between the contexts was that the destruction in the cave occurred in situ. The remains found in the structure, by contrast, appear to have been destroyed elsewhere and sub­sequently moved into the building, such that the artifacts and human remains were broken and

commingled. The other distinction between the contexts was that there was no evidence of burn­ing in the building, although about a dozen bones had been burned elsewhere and then deposited in the structure. 
The details of the mortuary process and its broader implications are beyond the scope of this study (see Jennings and Yepez 2012). For our present purposes, the importance of the contexts is that they each appear to contain burials and ar­tifacts from high-ranking individuals, who would have had greater access to exotics and sumptuary items than other inhabitants of the valley (Garcia and Bustamente 1990; Owen 2007; Tung and Owen 2006), as well as lower frequencies of some skeletal and dental pathological lesions (Tung and del Castillo 2005). A Bayesian analysis of the 13 radiocarbon dates from the two contexts (Jennings 2012a:40, 2014; Tung 2007a; Yepez et al. 2015) indicates that they are chronologically distinct (Figure 3; Buck et al. 1999). The material from the cave dates to the early Middle Horizon (ca. A.D. 700-850) and the material from the structure dates to the late Middle Horizon (ca. 
A.D. 900-1050; Supplemental Table 1). 
The Middle Horizon in the La Real region ap­pears to have been a period of great social change with widening social inequalities, surging popula­tion growth, and escalating violence (Jennings 2014; Owen 2010; Tung 2007a). Many of those buried at La Real were rising elites whose mourn­ers likely sought to use burial practices to reinforce social differences that were being asserted, at least in part, by prowess in battle and other forms of vi­olence (Tung 2012a). In the assemblage, children are underrepresented, and adult males are more common than adult females. Many of the males exhibit healed head wounds, suggesting that only certain segments of society, such as warriors and elites, were buried at La Real (Tung 2007a, 2012a:92, 145). The diachronic change in the fu­nerary assemblages and some aspects of human morbidity point to significant shifts in elite lifeways and legitimization strategies during the Middle Horizon (see Supplemental Text 1 for more infor­mation on La Real and Middle Horizon Arequipa). 
Thousands of artifacts were recovered from the burials at La Real, including textiles, leather, furs, botanicals, featherwork, and other objects that are rarely preserved in archaeological con­texts (see Yepez and Jennings [2012] for a more detailed discussion). These objects are used to test the null hypothesis that there were no changes in artifact styles and frequencies between the early and late Middle Horizon. Space constraints allow only a limited discussion of a few artifact classes, and we focus on those that had large enough sample sizes to detect significant changes through time. Specifically, we present data on 784 textiles, 609 spindle whorls, 2,258 diagnostic ceramics, and 145 incomplete skeletal individuals. We also briefly discuss smaller samples of ob­sidian, psychoactive drug paraphernalia, and fau­nal remains. To test whether there are significant differences in the artifact classes, demographic profiles, or skeletal fractures between the early

Changes in the La Real Artifact Assemblages 
Textiles and Weaving Equipment 
The La Real funerary contexts contain a plethora of weaving equipment, such as bags of raw cotton, spindles, spindle whorls, shuttles, combs, and back­strap looms. The ubiquity of these kinds of objects, paired with a near absence of weaponry, suggests a vibrant, culturally esteemed textile industry. This suggestion is supported by the wide variety of fin­ished textiles in cotton, wool, vegetal fiber, fur, and human hair (Table 1). The diversity of the col­lection reflects rising interregional interaction dur­ing the Middle Horizon, but also builds on a rich local textile tradition dating to at least the Early

Intermediate period. Some techniques, such as double and warp-faced cloth, were likely devel­oped locally during this time, while others evolved via a long back-and-forth with weavers in the Nazca Valley (Haeberli 2002, 2006, 2009; Que­quezana 1997; 2009; Quequezana et al. 2012). 
Plain weave warp-faced cloth dominates the later assemblage: 62.6 percent of the textiles were warp-faced during the late Middle Horizon, com­pared to just 30 .9 percent in the early Middle Horizon. The temporal difference in the frequen­cies of warp-faced cloth is extremely significant (Fisher's exact, p < .0001), as is the precipitous decline in the production of feather cloth and double cloth (p < .0001; Figure 4). These and other trends in the data on weaving techniques may suggest a streamlining of production in the late Middle Horizon. 
The focus on warp-faced textiles at La Real during the late Middle Horizon is correlated with a significant increase in the number of dovetailed and interlocked tapestries (p = .049). Interlocked tapestry is often seen as emblematic of Wari state­craft and a prerogative of elites (Bergh 1999, 2012: 187). Its greater frequency in the structure may relate to a broader circulation of Wari­affiliated textiles at this time in Arequipa (see Fig­ure 4). This trend, though less robust statistically than that seen for warp-faced textiles, is buttressed by the documentation of a four-cornered hat in the structure. These kinds of hats, commonly as­sociated with the Wari state (McEwan and Williams 2012:80), have thus far been demon­strated in Arequipa only in contexts that date to the late Middle Horizon (Jennings 2002:380-381). 
The spindle whorl data from La Real support the temporal trends towards greater specialization (Supplemental Tables 2 and 3).Among the trends noted by Goldstein and Yepez (2012:133-136) are statistically significant shifts in material (a greater use of ceramic over stone spindle whorls) and decoration (from undecorated to painted and incised; for both, p < .0001; Supplemental Figure 1). Most notably, there is a trend towards pro­ducing smaller and lighter spindle whorls with smaller diameter holes. Smaller diameter holes are designed for spinning a thinner and more con­sistent thread (Goldstein 2010:142).

Figure 4. Among the temporal trends in the textile data was the sharp decline in feather textiles and a significant increase in tapestry weave textiles. Left: detail of feather textile (RE-416.2) featuring a splayed anthropomorphic figure that is a local feature of the Middle Horizon. Right: detail of the tapestry weave textile (RE-163.20) displaying a Wari design. 
The decrease in dimensions of spindle whorls in the late Middle Horizon may be linked to an expanding demand for higher-quality textiles. The mechanisms behind this shift, as well as the increased specialization in warp-faced textiles, remain unclear. Wari state demand for high­quality cloth is one possible explanation (Earle and Jennings 2014; Goldstein 2010; Goldstein and Yepez 2012), but most of the textiles found at La Real are not particularly Wari in style. The decorated ceramic spindle whorls from La Real are almost identical to those found at Pataraya, a small Wari enclave in Nazca (Edwards et al. 2009), but the whorls also look like those dis­covered in Early Intermediate period tombs in Arequipa (Disselhoff 1969). Whatever the mech­anisms, there was a decisive shift in the Majes Valley towards making certain kinds of higher­quality textiles that occurred within the Middle Horizon period. 
Ceramics 
Like the textile collection, the ceramics from La Real are notable for their diversity, varying con­siderably in style, form, and pastes (Figure 5; Huaman 2012). Instrumental Neutron Activation Analysis (INAA) of the pastes demonstrates that 22 percent of the analyzed ceramics (n = 95) were made from a variety of clay sources likely located outside of the valley (Bedregral et al. 2015). In this article, we discuss only the changes in style and form. Our indications of the presence of a non-local style, such as Robles Moqo, should not be taken as evidence that all of the vessels in this style were imports. Some examples of imported styles, based on paste inclusions, INAA results, and stylistic departures, are local emulations of Wari styles. 
The differences in ceramic styles between the cave and structure reveal a few stark chronolog­ical breaks (Table 2). The La Ramada style-a coastal Arequipa style dating back to at least the beginning of the Early Intermediate period (San­tos 1980)-disappears in the late Middle Horizon (p < .0001). The decline in Nieveria frequencies also is significant (p = .007), and there is a non­significant decline in the frequencies of Ocros and Coastal Cajamarca. Loro also significantly declines in the late Middle Horizon (p < .0001), while Atarco-the style more closely affiliated with Wari in Nazca-appears in both contexts with no significant difference. The reasons for the decline in Loro ceramics are unknown, given that the style continued to be made in Nazca dur­ing the late Middle Horizon (Isla 2002:578). Its near absence from the structure may have been part of a broader movement away from non-Wari foreign styles during the late Middle Horizon. 
Although Chakipampa and Robles Moqo are confined to the early Middle Horizon in the Wari heartland (Knobloch 1991 :248-249; Menzel 1964:10-17, 21-23; Wolff 2012: 107), these styles linger at La Real with no significant difference between time periods. Vifiaque is typically seen as a derivative style that dates to the late Middle Horizon in the Wari heartland (Menzel 1964:40­45; Wolff 2012: 107). This style is confined largely to the structure (p = .0047), but the presence of

Figure 5. The use of (a) La Ramada and (b) Loro style ceramics declined during the Late Middle Horizon, while Wari­intluenced (c) Viiiaque La Real and (d) Chuquibamba styles became more common. 
20 Vifiaque sherds in the cave raises the possibil­ity that the style may have first developed outside of Huari. Owen (2010:64) has also noted the early dates of what are usually seen as later Wari "folk finewares" in Majes. 
There is an increasing emphasis on more local styles from the southern sierra during the late Middle Horizon. Vifiaque La Real, a local variant of the Vifiaque style with consistent differences in color, form, decoration, and composition (Huaman 2012:69-70), was far more prevalent than expected by our null hypothesis in the struc­ture, as was the closely related Middle Horizon Local and Los Escalondos (in all cases, p < .0001). In contrast, Middle Horizon Domestic­a style typified by jars and closed bowls that more liberally mixed local and Wari motifs-becomes much less common during the late Middle Hori­zon (p < .0001). One of the most important shifts may have been the late introduction of Middle Horizon Chuquibamba at La Real. The introduc­tion of this style corresponds with our first evi­dence for pervasive Wari influence in highland Arequipa, solidifying our case for tightening re­gional interaction in the late Middle Horizon (Goldstein 2010; Jennings and Yepez 2015). 
While the number of cups in the assemblage did not change during the Middle Horizon, there was an increasing emphasis on open bowls (p < .0001). This shift is matched by a decline in the use of closed bowls (p .0087), bottles (p <
= 
.0001), andjarras (p < .0001). Closed rather than open vessel forms were more common in coastal and highland Arequipa during the Early Interme­diate period and Middle Horizon (Goldstein 2010:150-153). Open bowls, however, were more

common in Wari heartland assemblages (Brew­ster-Wray 1990; Wolff 2012). They are also more heavily decorated and often found in contexts of feasting and elite display (Cook and Glowacki 2003:189-192; Nash 2012:91-94). The open bowls used at La Real were predominantly made in local Wari-influenced styles, perhaps reflecting the acceptance of a Wari state-promoted ideology linking one's status to greater knowledge of Wari iconography and practices (also see Goldstein 2010; Owen 2007). 
Psychoactive Drug Paraphernalia, Exotic Fauna! Remains, and Obsidian 
Although space constraints preclude an exhaus­tive survey of changes across other artifact types, a brief discussion of psychoactive drug parapher­nalia, exotic animal remains, and obsidian is war­ranted. One of the most widely known objects found at La Real prior to the 1995 salvage exca­vations was a Tiwanaku-style snuff tray depicting the front-face deity (Garcia and Bustamente l 990:Figure 3). The excavations at La Real re­covered six wooden snuff trays, nine bone spoons, five small bone containers, and a small stone mortar found within a leather bag (Supplemental Figure 2; Yepez 2012b). This assemblage is con­sistent with the paraphernalia used to inhale Anadenanthera colubrina, a psychoactive drug derived from a tree that grows along the eastern flanks of the Andes (Llagostera et al. 1988; Torres 1986). 
All 21 of these objects were found in the cave, an extremely significant finding if we expect drug paraphernalia to be interred equally in both contexts (p < .0001). People used Anadenanthera colubrina in both the Wari and Tiwanaku spheres, but the drug was likely more often mixed into maize beer rather than inhaled in Wari contexts (Knobloch 2000). The lack of drug paraphernalia in the struc­ture suggests a shift away from Tiwanaku-related practices during the late Middle Horizon. This shift is consistent with the ceramic and textile data that show (1) a decline in the variety of long-distance connections, and (2) a closer affiliation with Wari practices and its stylistic canon. 
Among the faunal remains found at La Real were those of undomesticated animals that were not native to the region during the Middle Hori­zon. The remains of these exotic animals were significantly more abundant during the early Mid­dle Horizon (p < .0001).A deer antler, puma foot, owl foot, condor head, and seven parrot heads were recovered from the cave, while only a single parrot head was found in the structure (Jennings 2012b ; Ugarte and Yepez 2012:154). 
The birds, especially the parrots, may have been kept as pets, as has been documented on the central and south coasts of Peru during the Early Intermediate period and Middle Horizon (e.g., Reiss and Stiibel 1887; Tello 2009 [1931]). The possibility that birds were raised in captivity at La Real is supported by the documentation in the cave of black-chested buzzard eagle talons­not included as an "exotic" animal in our analysis because its range included the Majes Valley­that were filed down while the animal still lived. 
Only seven obsidian artifacts-two flakes and five projectile points-were excavated from La Real (Glascock 2012). Based on XRF analysis, the three objects in the cave context came from three different obsidian sources: Quispisisa, Chivay, and Alea-I (Supplemental Figure 3). In contrast, the four objects from the later structure all come from Alea-1. Quispisia was the major obsidian source closest to the Wari heartland, while Chivay in the Colea Valley of Arequipa was the main supplier for those living in and around Tiwanaku (Burger et al. 2000). Alea-1, one of the sub-sources of the Alea source in the Cotahuasi Valley just to the north of Colea, was the most heavily used source in Cuzco and much of Arequipa (Burger et al. 1998). 
The increasing reliance on the Alea source over the course of the Middle Horizon in our dataset mirrors the results of a much larger study by Patrick Ryan Williams et al. (2010, 2012) on 473 obsidian artifacts from across southern Peru. Their results suggest that Quispisisa, Chivay, and Alea obsidian were in wide circulation during the early Middle Horizon, with the arrival of Quispisisa obsidian correlating with the introduction of Wari and Wari-inspired material culture into southern Peru. The Alea source, however, became the dom­inant obsidian source in the region during the late Middle Horizon. The segregation of obsidian ex­change networks during the late Middle Horizon corresponds with the shift at La Real towards greater regionalization that is seen in the ceramics, textiles, and drug paraphernalia.

Changes in Population Profiles and Trauma from the Early to Late Middle Horizon 
Changes in burial demographics and trauma pat­terns are more subtle than those in material cul­ture. Although the early Middle Horizon cave held many more individuals than the structure, each space was used to deposit similar relative frequencies of males and females, as well as of age groups. These individuals also suffered sim­ilar frequencies and patterning of head trauma, though the late Middle Horizon context had nearly significantly greater frequencies of lethal (perimortem) cranial fractures. 
Population Profiles 
The minimum number of individuals (MNI) buried at La Real is 145 (Tung 2012a:91), but there are many more individuals in the cave (n 
= 
97) than in the later structure (n = 48). In the cave there are 6 infants, 13 children, 5 adoles­cents, and 73 adults, and in the structure there are 8 infants, 9 children, 2 adolescents, and 29 adults of various adult age categories (Figure 6). The relative distribution of age groups is not sig­nificantly different between the two contexts Cx2 
= = =
7 .8625; df 6; p .2484), suggesting that burial selection criteria as they related to age at death were not significantly altered from the early to late Middle Horizon. 
In the entire burial sample there are more males (n = 42) than females (n = 26), but the data is not significantly different from an equal sex distribution (p = .227).2 The sex ratio is dis­tinct in each context: the male-to-female ratio in the cave is 1.4 to 1, and in the structure it is 2.3 to 1. However, the sex-based distributions be­tween the two contexts are not significantly dif­ferent (p = .433). This suggests that the impor­tance of male or female identity for receiving burial at the site apparently did not change from the early to late Middle Horizon.

Real indicate that violence was common among this burial group, affecting 31 percent of a total of 104 adults. Head wounds were noted on 42.5 percent of males and 19 percent of females, as well as 26 percent of unsexed adults.3 Although these frequencies of cranial trauma ( antemortem and perimortem combined) decreased from the early to late Middle Horizon, the change was not significant. Specifically, among the early Middle Horizon crania, 34 percent of adults (N 74) ex­

Sex-based differences in head trauma are not apparent in each context, but overall, males show nearly significantly more trauma than females (p 
= 
.06; Tung 2012a:l31-133). This new, more de­tailed analysis shows that, while males have more cranial fractures than females in both contexts, the rate is not significantly higher in the early Middle Horizon cave, (p = .2224), nor in the late Middle Horizon structure (p = .1235; Table 3). 
Multiple head injuries affected about a third of the entire sample, and this proportion stays constant through the early to late Middle Horizon. In the cave, 32 percent of the 25 injured adults have more than one wound; in the structure, 29 percent of the seven affected adults exhibit mul­

can be seen in the average number of wounds per injured adult: 1.72 in the cave sample and 
1.43 in the sample from the structure. This sug­gests that the kinds of violent encounters that af­fected adu1ts interred at 1...,a Rea) were generally similar throughout the Middle Horizon, inasmuch as relates to either injury recidivism or brutal at­tacks in which a victim received multiple blows to the head. 
The locations of head wounds among the in­jured adults from the cave are very similar to those found in the structure. Among the 25 injured adults in the cave, there were 42 head wounds; 52 percent are on the anterior, 24 percent are on the posterior, and the other 24 percent are nearly evenly divided between the right, left, and superior portions of the cranium. There were a total of 10 head wounds among the seven injured adults from the structure; 50 percent of the head wounds are on the anterior, 30 percent are on the posterior portions, and the other 20 percent of the wounds are evenly divided among the superior and right side. This pattern in which half of the wounds are on the anterior part of the cranium indicates that, for both temporal groups, half of the violent encounters likely in­volved face-to-face conflicts. This cultural norm of "squaring off' with an opponent apparently did not significantly change from the early to late Middle Horizon. 
What did change, however, is the lethality of the violence for those who were involved in phys­ical conflicts. General frequencies of head trauma and wound locations were similar in both phases, but the frequency of perimortem (i.e., fatal) trauma among injured adults was not. Perimortem trauma was nearly significantly more common among the seven injured adults from the late Middle Horizon structure (3 out of 7, or 43 percent) relative to the 25 injured adults from the cave (2 out of 25, or 8 percent; p .0566). This suggests that while the

constant, these became much more deadly in the late Middle Horizon, perhaps reflecting an increase in deadly warfare against a backdrop of constant general violence or an improvement in the efficacy or weaponry. Acicht10nal slce!etal samples l':rom Wari-affiliated sites in southern Peru that have early and late Middle Horizon components should help clarify these changes.

Wari style that has a drilled hole on the apex of the cranium (see Tung 2008; Supplemental Figure 4). In all cases, the entire base of the skull was intentionally removed, likely to extract the brain and install the carrying cord. Two of the trophy heads from La Real still had the woven reed cords threaded through the perforation (Tung 2012a: 196-197). This enabled the trophy heads to be carried or displayed, although it is unknown where the trophy heads from La Real would have been hung for exhibition. 
The total absence of trophy heads from the structure signifies a dramatic change in violence and ritual activities. Just as Wari influence began reaching this region during the early Middle Hori­zon, the community of La Real was apparently engaged in violent activities that resulted in the production of Nasca-style human trophy heads. Although there has been some debate about whether Andean trophy heads came from ances­tors, enemies, or criminals (Tung 2007c, 2012a: 154-158; Verano 1995), studies employing arti­factual, skeletal, isotopic, and ancient DNA analy­ses have concluded that trophy heads come from enemies likely taken in war or some other form of conflict (Forgey and Williams 2005; Knudson et al. 2009; Proulx 1989; Tung 2012a:l78-184; Ver­ano 1995). The presence of the Nasca-style trophy heads at La Real likely indicates the existence of initial strong ties to the Nasca cultural sphere-a connection that appears to have waned in subse­quent centuries as Wari influence gained traction. Although no Wari-style trophy heads have been recovered from La Real, they are present in the Majes valley near the site of Beringa (Tung 2003) and at Uraca (Koontz 2011), but it is unknown to which Middle Horizon phase they belong. Nonetheless, their presence in the valley suggests a shift to more Wari-like practices, an interpretation that is also supported by the ceramic and textile data showing an increase in the production and consumption of Wari-related material culture. 
Discussion 
Within a Middle Horizon context of endemic­and likely increasingly deadly-violence, some individuals strove to create elite positions in Ma­jes. Many of these elites were buried at La Real. It is difficult to determine how these people came to power, but their status seems to have hinged in part on participation in a changing suite of lo­cal, regional, and long-distance connections evi­dent in the funerary assemblages. The differences in early and late Middle Horizon connections hint at a dynamic relationship with the Wari heartland that still remains obscure. This section discusses four trends that can be observed in the data. 
Declining Exotica 
One of the most notable shifts is decreasing in­terest or access to exotic goods. This decline can be measured in terms of the paucity of non-Wari imports or influence during the late Middle Hori­zon within some artifact classes-pottery, drug paraphernalia, exotic animal parts, and perhaps trophy heads. The steep reduction in the use of featherwork may also be related to this trend. 
Newly won elite positions are often initially legitimated through association with exotic and enchanted objects (e.g., Gell 1998; Helms 1988). Although data are sparse, status differences ap­pear to have been muted in Early Intermediate period Majes (Disselhoff 1969; Haeberli 2009; Jennings 2014). The individuals from the early Middle Horizon context at La Real reinforced their tenuous hold on power through violence (Koontz 2011; Tung 2007a), but also by demon­strating wide-ranging connections that on occa­sion extended beyond the Wari sphere. With the social hierarchy more established by the late Mid­dle Horizon, there may have been less of a desire to acquire exotic goods. 
The decline in the import and emulation of non-Wari exotica during the late Middle Horizon may also relate to increasing Wari imperial control over long-distance exchange networks of certain goods. This may have limited the degree of in­teraction between local elites and distant locations (Tung 2012a:206-207; also see Earle and Jen­nings 2014; Goldstein 2010; Lau 2014). Why non-Wari exotica decreased in the late Middle Horizon remains an open question, but it is pos­sible that resource extraction and the distribution of particular items was tightly managed by the agents of the Wari state and allied local elites. 
Becoming More Wari 
The relationship between groups living in the Wari heartland and in the Majes Valley is also unclear. 
Downloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core. YBP Library Services, on 22 Aug 2018 at 17:16:51, subject to the Cambridge Core terms of use, available at https://www.cambridge.org/core/terms. https://doi.org/10.7183/1045-6635.26.3.382 
Wari influence on material culture and the body (e.g., changes in trophy head styles) is pervasive (Garcia and Bustamente 1990; Owen 2010; Tung 2012a:198-199). Yet there are no strong indica­tions of Wari imperial conquest and direct control over the region from settlement pattern, architec­tural, artifactual, or strontium isotope data (Jen­nings 2014; Knudson and Tung 2011; Owen 2010; Tung 2007b). Thus, it is unclear what drove people towards Wari practices, motifs, and forms. The change may have been spurred by emerging elites seeking to tap into an iconography of radical social difference and violence (Knobloch 2012), as well as from the expansion of a Wari hegemony that fueled desires to strengthen linkages with the Wari heartland (Goldstein 2010; Tung 2012a: 145-146, 206-210.). 
The data from La Real suggest that Wari styl­istic influence arrived in the valley by the begin­ning of the eighth century A.D. Much of this early influence appears to have been down-the­line, such that those living in Majes may have first experienced "Wari" via the strengthening of preexisting connections with Nazca. There were likely imports from the Wari heartland in the ear­liest context at La Real-an Ocros-style spoon, for example-but there was also a pervasive Nazca influence that can be seen in the ceramics, textiles, spindle whorls, and trophy heads recov­ered from the cave. As with other non-Wari for­eign influences, Nasca influence declined sharply in the late Middle Horizon. 
The assemblage from the late Middle Horizon reflects greater influence from the Wari heartland as local communities adopted more Wari-related practices. The implementation of a Wari-like style of feasting (e.g., Cook and Glowacki 2003; Nash 2012), for example, is suggested from the shift to open serving vessels, and the interlocked tapestry weave tunics and four-comer hat found at La Real reflect, at the very least, the desire of the local elite to wear emblematic Wari clothing (Bergh 2012). The declining use of snuff tablets and the shift away from Nasca-style trophy heads might also be based in a desire to behave in a more Wari manner. Nonetheless, the increasing affinity to Wari prac­tices does not seem to correlate with an increased flow of objects between Majes, Huari, and Wari colonial outposts. The data, as discussed below, suggest instead a regionalization of the economy. 
Becoming more Wari would have helped to legitimate local status gains by appealing to a state ideology that naturalized status hierarchies (Knobloch 2012). Nonetheless, it is still poorly understood how this particular materialization of Wari state eminence was constructed and accepted as a status marker. More research is needed to determine whether those emulating this ideology did so independently or whether they were tied into a Wari imperial political economy that ex­tended its hegemony via the circulation of prestige goods and other mechanisms (e.g., Earle and Jen­nings 2014; Goldstein 2010). 
Regionalization of the Majes Economy 
The data from La Real suggest an increasing re­gionalization of the economy, with our best evi­dence for regionalization coming from changes in textile manufacture. During the late Middle Horizon, local weavers began specializing in the production of cotton plain weave warp-faced cloth. Although the final destinations of these warp-faced textiles is unknown, they have been recovered in Chuquibamba (Goldstein 2010:233) and Cotahuasi (Jennings 2002:378-395), two highland Arequipa valleys where excavations have recovered few to no spindle whorls. This underscores the possibility that warp-faced tex­tiles were distributed from the Majes Valley into parts of highland Arequipa. Strengthening ties to this region during the late Middle Horizon can also be seen in the introduction of ceramic styles from highland Arequipa into the assemblage of La Real, as well as by the spread of Wari stylistic influence into much of highland Arequipa (Jen­nings 2014). 
The increased use of obsidian from Alea in the late Middle Horizon, instead of from the more distant Quispisisa source, further highlights the growing connections between elites at La Real and groups living in highland Arequipa. Nonethe­less, obsidian data from the Chivay source in the Colca Valley demonstrate that not all highland Arequipa populations were equally drawn into the Wari interaction sphere. Chivay obsidian was increasingly redirected towards the Tiwanaku sphere during the Middle Horizon, and Wari in­fluence on Colca ceramics is also weaker than elsewhere in the region (de la Vera 1988; Tripce­vich 2007; Wemke 2013:78-81).

The regionalization of the Majes economy may have been occurring amid escalating Wari state efforts to alter, if not outright control, the long-distance exchange of a narrow range of highly valued goods such as Spondylus shell, ob­sidian, fancy polychrome ceramics, and certain textiles (e.g., Earle and Jennings 2014; Lau 2014). Alea obsidian could have been one of these items, although there is no evidence for state control of extraction sites in the Cotahuasi Valley (Jennings and Yepez 2015). Some of the textiles manufac­tured in the Majes Valley may also have entered into a state-dominated interaction sphere. In re­turn, those living in Arequipa may have acquired access to Spondylus shell. Beads and pendants in Arequipa were often manufactured in a manner similar to that used in the Wari heartland (Gold­stein 2010; Jennings 2012b; Jennings and Yepez 2015; Tung 2007b). Camelid fiber textiles are another likely import, as this fiber was not pro­duced at La Real (Quequezana et al. 2012:108­110) . Acquisitions of these imports-especially Wari-style tapestry-would have enhanced the status of those who secured them. 
The creation of a regional economy in Are­quipa may have occurred in response to Wari state involvement with long-distance interactions. As old trade connections with the South Coast were reconfigured or shut down, Majes and other coastal leaders may have sought new trading part­ners in the highlands, especially those that had access to goods that were valued within the Wari sphere. 
Mortuary Treatment as Status Enhancer amid Continuing Violence 
The demographic profiles show that La Real never developed into a funerary locale for all members of society. The mourners continued to bury adult men in these mortuary contexts in higher relative numbers, resulting in a mortuary profile that did not reflect a once-living commu­nity (Tung 2012a:92-93). La Real was a burial place that celebrated the status of those buried there and of those who placed them there. While the styles of many grave goods changed from the early to late Middle Horizon, they continued to confer status among a similar category of people: adult men, particularly those who had been vio­lently injured. 
Amid the various changes in the local econ­omy, the same proportion of adults suffered sub­lethal cranial fractures from the early to late Mid­dle Horizon, suggesting that the growing Wari influence in the region did little to bring about an enforced peace (Tung 2012a: 149). In contrast. the greater presence of Wari material culture is correlated with a significant increase in deadly violence in the late Middle Horizon. The contin­ued rates of nonlethal violence may reflect con­tinuity in community tensions that materialized as domestic violence, physical conflict resolu­tions, and other community skirmishes (Tung 2012a: l 38-143). But the significantly higher number of violent deaths in the late Middle Hori­zon may reflect larger sociopolitical transforma­tions in which different communities were now interacting with each other, perhaps vying for ac­cess to exotic Wari goods and competing for other resources that now had different origins and dis­tribution patterns. Apparently, some of those in­teractions did not go well. 
The sometimes deadly frictions could have re­sulted from preexisting regional relationships that were reformulated in a new geopolitical landscape created by Wari influence or from wholly new interactions between groups who had little to no previous experience with each other. Whether this was the result of high-stakes competition to access Wari goods is unclear, but the influence of a new cultural and political authority in the re­gion may have had an indirect effect on the in­digenous groups in Majes and neighboring areas (sensu Ferguson and Whitehead 1992; see Tung 2012a:24, 131), contributing to unrest and con­flict, not necessarily with Wari state agents, but among local groups. 
Conclusions 
From approximately A.D. 700 to 1050, the Majes Valley opened up to a broader world. Those buried at La Real were major players in this tran­sition, using an array of local, regional, and in­terregional interactions to bolster their tenuous elite status. Wari stylistic influence spans this pe­riod in much of Peru, and thus in one sense it is appropriate to encapsulate this era as part of a single horizon. Yet thinking in terms of a "Middle Horizon," as John Rowe and his contemporaries

acknowledged (Rice 1993), can sometimes ob­
scure considerable temporal variation that took place within the period. This study shows key changes that occurred within the Middle Horizon during a time of widening Wari influence. Elite status in the Majes Valley was not won at the in­ception of the Middle Horizon, but was developed and maintained over time as individuals employed a varying mix of legitimization strategies that in­volved warfare, community conflicts, feasting, exotic goods, ideology, and craft production. The later shifts in these strategies, such as the creation of a regional economy and the adoption of more Wari-like practices, were in part locally driven. Nonetheless, these shifts also likely reflect broader changes in the interregional networks that spanned the Wari sphere.

Notes 
I . Following Isbell (2008), we use "Huari" for the archae­ological site and "Wari" for the broader cultural phenomena that occurred throughout much of Peru. 
2. 
In Tung (2012a), there are 67 sexed adults, but one unidentified cranium has been reexamined and identified as male. 

3. 
Only two of the trophy heads are in this calculation be­cause the other five were covered with soft tissue and therefore could not be observed for cranial wounds. 

4. 
Frequencies are slightly different from Tung (201 2a) because one unsexed adult cranium with trauma was reevalu­ated and categorized as male.
