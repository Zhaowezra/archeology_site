
POSTHUMOUS BODY MANIPULATION IN THE CLASSIC PERIOD 
MIXTEQUILLA: REEVALUATING THE HUMAN REMAINS OF 
OSSUARY I FROM EL ZAPOTAL, VERACRUZ 

Vera Tiesler, Arturo Romano-Pacheco, Jorge Gomez-Valdes, Annick Daneels 
Our interdisciplinary study provides new information and interpretations ofOssuary /,a large assemblage of human bones 
associated with the ceremonial center dedicated to a life-size clay figure of a splendidly attired human skeleton (often iden­
tified as Mictlantecuhtli in the archaeological literature) at the site of El Zapotal in south-central Veracruz. Recovered in 
1971, this assemblage has been interpreted as a ritual deposit of women who died during childbirth, whose bodies were 
dedicated in later Aztec lore to the Tlazolteotl goddess. The present paper provides new insights into the depositional sequence, 
the type and number of individuals within the assemblage, the sex and age profile of the mostly female cohort, the distrib­
ution of artificial head shapes as an ethnic marker, and evidence of perimortem violence and postmortem processing in the 
form of flaying. Our evidence indicates that Ossuary I represents the slow accumulation of loose bones and limb segments 
of partially skinned individuals in a circular shaft. Postdating the functioning of the Death God adoratorio and showing 
fluctuations in the patterns of pre-depositional body treatment, the assemblage expresses the Late Classic period ritual 
practice of flaying both males and females in Veracruz. In later stages, the ossuary was used again for a female cult, con­
sistent with the original interpretation of women who died during childbirth.

ture itself was flanked by a set of almost life-sized female clay statues and a multiple burial including smiling figurines. Immediately to the north of the shrine, a large cylindrical ossuary, known as Ossuary I of Trench I, stacked abundant amounts of disarticulated or partly articulated human bones (mainly crania, loose mandibles, and long bones), which have been thought to stem from human sac­rifices. This ossuary is the focus of our study. 
After recovery, some 59 of the 79 crania retrieved from Ossuary I were sent to the Depart­ment of Physical Anthropology (DAF) of the Insti­tuto Nacional de Antropolog{a e Historia (INAH) in Mexico City together with associated mandibles and postcranial bones.1 Of these remains, 56 cra­nia were initially studied by Arturo Romano, who, on the grounds of photographic interpretation, age estimation, sex determination, and artificial head forms, interpreted the context as a ritual secondary deposit of women who had died during parturition and whose bodies were dedicated to Tlazolteotl, goddess of midwifes, sex, and fertility to the Aztecs (Romano 1975, 1977). Romano's proposal aligns with Manuel Torres' interpretation of the shrine's monumental female terracotta figures as early rep­resentations of the cihuateteos, women who, according to later Aztec lore, died in the battle of their first childbirth (Torres 1972, 2009). Jaime Ortega, the Zapotal Project's physical anthropolo­gist, has recently published the results of his study of all human remains unearthed during the six field seasons at Mound 2 of El Zapotal . His data report 230 interments, all of ceremonial character; one third of the individuals were males, including those bearing artificial superior flattening of their head (Ortega 2009:189).2 This new appreciation seri-

Ritual Expressions and 
Mortuary Practices at El Zapotal 


The extraordinary ceremonial shrine from Mound 2 of El Zapotal has been the subject of an ongoing discussion regarding ancient Mixtequilla ideology and the rituals that led to its construction and use during the Late Classic period (Gutierrez and Hamilton 1977; Torres 2004, 2009; Wyllie 2008, 20 10). The shrine is the northern one of a pair of small buildings within a large rectangular platform. Mound 2 is 4 m high and 7 6 x 34 m at its base (Tor­res 2004:206). It is located between a plaza group dominated to the east by the Gallina pyramid and the monumental platform, dominated by the Gallo pyramid to the south (both pyramids are 24 m high) . Previous research suggests that plaza groups held predominantly ceremonial functions, whereas monumental platforms are identified as palatial compounds (Daneels 20 11). As such, Mound 2 may have served as a palatial residence adjoining the Gallina pyramid group. The mound is mostly known because of its northern shrine, measuring 
5.8 m x 3.3 m (Torres 1972:3). The shrine is dom­inated by a monumental polychrome representa­tion of an unfired earthen version of the god of death. Since Torres' first publication, this sculpture has been referred to repeatedly by its Aztec period name Mictlantecuhtli. It represents a life-size, partly skeletonized human figure who presides at the center of the shrine, flanked by mural paintings of male warriors and women, one of them appar­ent! y pregnant (Wyllie 2008: 234-243; 2010) (Fig­ure 3). When excavated, the adoratorio's western side appeared lined by a procession of almost life­sized female effigies of terracotta, deposited as part of a huge termination offering. The statues have been interpreted as cihuateteos, the Aztec era patron deity of women who died in childbirth (Torres 
1972, 2004:206). 

The fill used to cover the shrine also contained a series of primary interments. Among them is a simultaneous multiple burial of three individuals associated with so-called smiling face figurines, along with shell and stone ornaments and sculp­tures, the only lavish offerings found at the mound (Ortega 2009: 197). These remains have been erro­neously called Ossuary I of Trench IV and are not to be confused with Ossuary I of Trench I, the object of this study (Ortega 2009: 196-197; Torres 2004:206-209). Below the southern and northern walls of the southern shrine, a series of earlier pri­mary deposits appeared, described by Ortega (2009: 194-196) as articulated but partially dis­membered. Many of these skeletons were incom­plete, as they either lacked limbs or the head; others just consisted of isolated but articulated body parts . 
Immediately to the north of the Death God's shrine, a large ossuary (Ossuary I, Trench I) was discovered stacked with abundant disarticulated or partly articulated human bones (Ortega 2009: 189-198, Figure 4) (Figure 2; Table 1).4 The ossuary measured about 1 m in diameter accord­ing to Torres (2004:206) and was more than 3 m deep. It started at around 130 cm below the sur­face. Below that level, the photographic record indicated sequenced layers of stacked crania, mandibles, and limb and trunk segments that formed a roughly circular column, the bottom of which was located at a depth of 4.60 m (Ortega 2009: 196-197; Torres 2004:206) .5 Ortega specifies further that the postcranial bones appeared to be partly articulated, for example pelvic bones artic­ulated with lower lumbar vertebrae, or the long bones of the leg with the foot (Ortega 2009: 196). 
Ossuary I is described repeatedly by the origi­nal researchers as a column of bones, thereby implying that it was once freestanding and served for public display (Ortega 2003:64,2009: 196; Tor­res 2004:206). Yet the depths that are recorded for each of the crania indicate that the deposit did not harbor a single assemblage of skeletal segments but, instead, was made up by a succession of dif­ferent bone assemblages, as we will show below (Table 1). Our interpretation of a sequence of events rather than one single deposit is also upheld by the differences in conservation, bone surface color, and postmortem manipulation observed among the dif­ferent cranial assemblages (see below). If free­standing, the "column" would probably have collapsed, more so considering its height of more than 3 m.Also, in view of the stratigraphic evidence described here, it seems more feasible that the bones were not assembled to form a freestanding column, but, instead, were placed in several occa­sions into a circular shaft pit, which gradually filled up. The pit must have been dug from the level of

the platform that once covered the Death God shrine, cutting through the fill that covered it and through its floor level (Figure 4). A similar deposit, a deep circular shaft dug through a previous build­ing, has been reported from a nearby site, dated to the Late Postclassic period (Maldonado 2012).

Our review of the graphic, material, and con­( textual evidence of Ossuary I indicates that the human remains within it had accumulated rela­tively late in the occupational sequence of Mound 

2. Ossuary I must have postdated the use of the shrine itself, which at one stage was terminated by burying it under a thick layer of earth. Regarding our interpretation, the following data have to be taken into account: first, the damaged top of the shrine walls bear testimony of their dismantlement to the level of the upper part of the Death God sculpture. Second, the so-called cihuateteoceramic sculptures and the multiple burials with offerings placed alongside and in front of the shrine (still vis­ible in situ) were not placed on the shrine's floor, but were contained at the level of the god's figure in the same sandy silt fill that covered the whole shrine, a clear indication that they were part of a large termination offering. Third, Torres (2004:206) mentions that the shallowest part of the human remains that made up Ossuary I was discovered at almost the same depth (1.30 m) below the mound's surface as the upper part of the cihuateteo sculp­tures. This assertion is crucial, as it confirms that the pit dug to hold Ossuary I cut through the fill and therefore must postdate the termination of the Death God shrine. 
In Mesoamerica, both partial dismantlement of buildings and the placing oflavish offerings (some including human sacrificial remains) were common before erecting new building stages. These rituals served to close the previous stage and to consecrate

the new structure (for further examples in the Maya area, see Mock, ed. ( 1998), and Sugiyama and Cas­tro (2007) for examples from Teotihuacan). Simi­lar offerings to the ones documented in this study have been recorded also in the earthen architecture of other prehispanic sites in central Veracruz (Daneels 2008a, 2008b, 2011). Although never reported as such at El Zapotal itself, this interpre­tation is supported by field pictures taken by restorer Luis Torres in the seventies. These show the presence of a distinctive thick floor, which had been left by the subsequent building stage in the surrounding trench profiles. This floor rested on top of the fill that once covered the dismantled shrine. It is safe to infer that, when Manuel Torres speci­fied that the ossuary started at about the same level as the cihuateteos (i.e., at 1.3 m below the mound surface), the ossuary really intruded from the level of this new floor. Manuel Torres reports that its bot­tom lay 4.6 m below the surface of the mound. Because the shrine is preserved to a height of 2 m (as observed at the site museum), this implies that the shaft continued between 1.3 m and 1.46 m below the original floor of the shrine.6 
From all of the above, we conclude that Ossuary I cannot have been contemporary with either the shrine or its termination offering, but, instead, must have been part of the next building stage, probably dating to the latter part of the Late Classic. It should be noted that the mound shows still another, later building stage, at the depths of 0 to 1.3 m below surface, which sealed the ossuary. This last occu­pational stage still belongs to the local Late Clas­sic sequence (dated as late as A.D. 1000), as no Postclassic finds have been reported from El Zapotal (Stark and Curet 1994). 
Although ceremonially obliterated by a deep fill of earth and penetrated by the vertical shaft used for discarding human body parts (i.e., Ossuary I), the pit did not damage the underlying shrine. Thus it is possible to infer that the action probably was performed with a clear memory of the shrine's location. A new shrine may have been built on top of the previous one, although the excavation reports do not mention any significant findings. This absence of evidence does not necessarily mean evi­dence of absence: the upper layer of Mound 2 was eroded post-depositionally and looted (the very reason for initiating the archaeological salvage in 1971), and knowledge about earthen architecture was still too incipient to expect any conclusive statement on the last stages of use of Mound 2 by the original team. Thus, though continuity in the practice of a Death God cult cannot be discounted a priori, there is no evidence that the remains found in Ossuary I are directly related to it. 
Revisiting the Remains from Ossuary I 
After their recovery in 1971 and 1972, some 59 of the 79 crania were sent to the INAH's Department of Physical Anthropology (DAF) in Mexico City together with associated mandibles and postcranial bones (Ortega 2009: 191; Torres 2004:206; 2009: 196) . Of these remains , Arturo Romano (197 4, 1977) studied 56 crania after excluding three specimens for lack of suitable preservation.7 This material does not include the remains that were labeled "Ossuary I of Trench VI," recovered near the northwest comer of the shrine. Recently, Ortega (2009: 197) has correctly reidentified this human assemblage, from which smiling figurines were recovered, as a multiple burial rather than an ossuary. 
We reexamined all available human remains from El Zapotal at the INAH Department of Phys­ical Anthropology during 2010 and 2011 (Tiesler 2010). Most of the crania recovered from Ossuary I are marked with unpublished indications about their respective depth inside this deposit, ranging from 1.30 m to 4.76 m (see above). This informa­tion was communicated by the archaeologists to Arturo Romano in 1971 (Table 1). 
The skeletal analyses were based on conven­tional and digital measurements and on macro­scopic observation, which was supported by magnifiers (5x-10x) and raking light. Data pro­cessing included digital landmark studies and regression statistics. For the determination of the color, sphericity, and granulosity of soil that adhered to the bone material, we used aMunsell(r) color chart. 
For the assessment of the number of individu­als possibly represented, we determined the mini­mum number of individuals (MNI) from each anatomical segment. In each lateralized bone, we also used the criterion of the most likely number of individuals (MLNI), following a formula described in Adams and Konigsberg (2008:241).8 This formula is especially useful for inferring the

number of individuals from incomplete bone assemblages (Adams and Konigsberg 2008:241), which likely underrepresent the original burial pop­ulation when conventional MNI counts are used. For this study, pairing was conducted by one of the authors and checked for interobserver error by comparing the results to those obtained by two additional osteologists. Matches were determined cautiously on the grounds of individualizing mor­phological features, length, and diameter, along with a comparison of the states of epiphyseal clo­sure. By considering multiple morphological fea­tures and different observers, we sought to minimize possible biases arising from errors in bilateral matching. For the taphonomic assessment of anthro­pogenic marks, all bone surfaces were examined systematically in terms of color, texture, and direct evidence of perimortem violence and postmortem processing. We looked specifically for physical evi­dence in the form of slicing, blunt and sharp force trauma, abrasion, and fire exposure (Tiesler 2007) . Combining the contextual and skeletal data from Ossuary I, we reconstructed feasible and probable mortuary pathways that resulted in the assemblage arrangement, following the principles of French archaeothanatology (Duday 2009). For this approach we used basic concepts of primary vs. sec­ondary burial space, simultaneous vs. successive deposits, and multiple vs. collective deposits. In sex and age-at-death determinations, we employed general macroscopic standards described in Buikstra and Ubelaker (1994). For the iliac bones, we evaluated both age-at-death and sex. In the cranium, age-at-death was only roughly deter­mined using secondary criteria such as cranial suture closure (Meindl and Lovejoy 1985), degree of dental maturation (Ubelaker 1989), and physi­. ological wear of the occlusional surfaces of teeth (Lovejoy 1985). The conventional sex determina­tion in the crania was confirmed in a subsequent step by measureable results. For this purpose, we used PAST 1.97 ( c) software (Hammer et al. 2001) for a linear discriminant function analysis (LDA) in each specimen, based on 15 cranial measure­ments (Howells 1989). Cranial vault modification was described in each specimen with reference to presence, degree (0-4), type, and variation. Our classification follows broadly the one proposed by Jose Imbelloni (Dembo and Imbelloni 1938) . This taxonomy cat­egorically distinguishes annular from tabular erect and oblique types, the latter two produced with rigid compression devices. In this scheme, tabular erect shapes derive from cradle board use, leading to isolated lambdoid flattening or more severe cra­nial broadening and shortening. Different from cradling devices, head splints produce the reclined, elongated vaults that the literature describes as tab­ular oblique shapes. Regarding the compression devices used to obtain superior flattening, also called obelical flattening, which is abundantly observed at El Zapotal, there is some controversy as to the responsible device, as both cradles and free head boards have been proposed as imple­ments (Martinez de Leon 2007, 2009; Nelson and Mandimenos 2010; Tiesler 2012) . For the metric confirmation of our visually obtained classification of head shapes, we scanned a list of 15 craniometric landmarks in each cranium using a 3D digitizer (MicroScribe G2X, Immersion Corporation Inc.©), which converts a set of con­ventional cranial landmarks into 3D digital coor­dinates. Using Rhinoceros 4.0© software (www.rhino3d.com), the cranial polygon is obtained in each specimen, following the recom­mendations established by Romano (1965). The metric information was also processed using Prin­cipal Component Analysis in order to represent morphological diversity, both to group similar head shapes and to distinguish outliers . Results The available skeletal series from the El Zapotal's Ossuary I presently consists of 50 available crania, of which 4 7 (94 percent) were sufficiently preserved to allow for detailed determination of sex and age, and of the type and modality of artificial cranial shaping (Table 1). Apart from the series of complete crania, the ossuary contained 29 mandibles, teeth, and isolated segments of the face (N = 6) and neu­rocranium (N 2), along with hundreds of post­= cranial segments, all of which have been included in this study (Tables 2 and 3). This material was shelved separately from the complete crania and grouped according to the type of anatomical seg­ment.

Taphonomic Conditions and Depositional Sequence 
Regarding the subsoil that still adheres to the cra­nia under study, we obtained data from 23 crania with visible soil adherences (Table 1) .9 In all cases, the soil appears uniformly yellowish to light brown (Munsell chart 2.5Y 6/2-3), a silt substrate inter­spersed with sub-rounded, very fine sand particles. This result indicates that the same fill appears to have been used to cover all the human remains that were deposited in the pit. This may have been part of the deposition process during the use of the ossuary (to avoid the smell) or percolation of the fill from the last building stage (see above). 
According to our interpretation, the specimens recovered from the top levels of the gradually grow­ing ritual deposit of Ossuary I should be later, and the lower ones should have been deposited earlier. Unfortunately, only the crania bear information regarding their maximum depth within Ossuary I,

which ranges from I.30 m to 4.76 m (Table I; see also Torres 2009:206). The depths that are recorded for each of the crania indicate that the deposit did not harbor a single assemblage of skeletal segments but, instead, was made up by a succession of dif­ferent bone assemblages, showing a higher con­centration in the deeper, earlier portions of the pit. Twelve crania are marked at a depth of 4.76 m, three at 4 m. Thirteen more crania appeared at 3 .5 m, six range from 2.7 m to 3m, and five were recorded at a depth of 2.4 m. Two crania were recovered from a depth of 1.9 m and the shallowest two from I .3 m below the surface (Table 1). 
Our interpretation of a sequence of depositional events rather than one single occasion is also upheld by the gradual differences in conservation, bone surface color, and postmortem manipulation observed among the different cranial assemblages. The taphonomic characteristics of the crania fluc­tuate according to their depth. The crania from the upper levels are the most eroded and show a whitish to light brownish surface color (Munsell 5YR 7 /3). These properties change gradually with increasing depth. The specimens recovered from 3 m, and

number of individuals calculated from paired bones indicates almost 200 individuals (181 ± 38) from the femurs, considering 29 matches among 73 left and 73 right segments. Similarly high are the esti­mates for tibias (146 ± 49). These values are about twice the numbers of crania present in the deposi­tory and three times the MNI counts. These dis­crepancies underline the high number of individuals disposed of in Ossuary I and, again, the incomplete , reduced nature of the individual remains that were added over time. Regarding the disproportion between tibias and femurs, again we may rule out differences in preservation, as both segments tend to preserve equally well. The over­all picture introduces questions regarding the pos­sible reasons for the selective deposition and the biographic profile of the individuals represented. 
Sex and Age Profile 
Table 1 shows the distribution of sex and age groups obtained from the crania. Our results show that exclusively adults or adolescents are represented, among them at least 6 males and 41 females. Divided by depth, all sex-determined crania above the 3 .5 m maximum depth threshold appear to be women (N=15), while the lower and therefore ear­lier cranial deposits appear to be those of both sexes-with 20.69 percent identified as male or probably male and 79 .31 percent identified as female crania (N=29). 
Although no depth indication came with the remainder of anatomical segments, similar age pat­terns emerge when postcranial remains are com­pared to the crania (Table 3). Not a single segment of the scored skeletal series belongs to perinatal individuals, infants, or juveniles. The youngest bones were in the process of epiphyseal closure and classified as adolescents. 
Clearly distinct from the sexed cranial and mandibular cohorts are the proportions of females and males in the postcranial segments. While four of the 22 sexable mandibles appear to stem from males (18.18 percent), a similar proportion to that of the crania (Chi-squared= .052;df= l;p= .819), only two segments of the postcranial material , namely two right and left humeri, were assigned male or probable male status. All iliac bones, femurs , and tibias appeared to derive exclusively from females. Specifically, when using the 18 right pelvic bones for sex and age determination, a dis­tinctive age pattern emerges. All iliac bones were clearly female. The age distribution, determined from pubic symphyses and auricular surfaces, indi­cates a strong bias toward late adolescence and young adulthood, between 15 and 25 years of age­at-death (Figure 6). It is also noteworthy that all but one of the iliac bones showed clear parturition marks (dorsal pitting), an indication that the young women had undergone pregnancy and labor prior to death (Stewart 1970; Suchey et al. 1979). 

Head Shapes 
Each of the examined crania exhibits the effects of artificial modeling (100 percent; N=50), most of them severe (Figure 7). Tabular oblique shapes are rare and appear almost exclusively in the shallow parts of Ossuary I, were they appear in extreme expressions (Figures 7a and 8). The receding head

profile, produced by head splints , appears still accentuated by a sagittal sulcus, which visibly divides the vault into two parietal lobes .All but one of the seven crania with ascribed sex and this type of artificial modification were identified as females. Only Skull 38, deposited much lower (and there­fore earlier) than the other oblique specimens, was determined to be male (Table 1) . 
More frequent and present at all levels of Ossuary I are tabular erect shapes (Figure 7b), pro­duced by compression boards inside cradles to which the infants were strapped. In the skull vaults under study, this practice led to mostly severe changes in form, by shortening the anteroposterior length and by increasing biparietal width. This shape is present mostly in females, much like supe­rior flattening of the head; this form constitutes roughly half of all crania of our series (47 .92 per­cent; N=48). The compression device used for this shape should have been similar to conventional cradle boards on the grounds of the observed asym­metry of the crania, which is similar to other tabu­lar erect features, and after considering the additional anterior and posterior compression planes that are visible on the skull vaults of these individuals, the latter of which is typically located in the lambda area (Figures 7c and 9). 
Regarding the compression devices used to obtain superior flattening of the head ( obelical flat­tening), which is abundantly observed at El Zapotal, there is some controversy in the literature as to the responsible device, as both cradles and free head boards have been proposed as implements (Martinez de Leon 2009; Nelson and Mandimenos 201O; Tiesler 2012). The implement used to obtain superior flattening at El Zapotal must have been a cradle device, given the basal bulging and the lack of reclination of the skull. 
Table 1 illustrates the distribution of different artificial head shapes according to depositional depth. The female crania from the superficial lev­els of the ossuary show a series of different head silhouettes, except for the superior flattening, which is very common in the deeper portions of Ossuary I (Figures 7, 8, and 9) . The earlier, lower, corpus of crania, which includes both sexes, is shaped dif­ferently from the ones on top. Two thirds of the deeper specimens show a strong superior flatten­ing, which has been termed in the literature the "Zapotal-type head shapes" (Ortega 2009; Romano 1977). This shift in artificial head shapes is highly significant statistically when the two patterns are compared (Chi squared = 22.548; df= l;p = .000), pointing toward a cultural shift. 
Perimortem and Posthumous Body Processing 
Marks of perimortem violence and postmortem body manipulation were apparent in 15 of 47 uneroded specimens (Table 1). Ample signs of posthumous manipulation of the still-fleshed head appear in the form of flat cutmarks from slicing (N=22) and shallow scraping marks (N=2), in addition to the appearance of amorphous black­ish substrate.

The latter covers the surfaces of at least 16 of the lower-level crania and are associated with the specimens that evidence slicing of the neurocra­nium. We consider that the black patches, docu­mented on some of the skull vaults, probably occurred during the postmortem interval, when the skulls still conserved soft tissue. Scholarship relates blackening of bone surfaces to fire exposure, nat­ural staining during the decomposition process, and culturally applied paint or staining (Argaez et al. 2011; Phineiro 2006). While we exclude burning in our case for Jack of any other related indication, we think that the latter two possibilities would fit with the pattern of postmortem treatments encoun­tered in the lower part of the deposit. Decay processes are quite complex and can also vary within the same body mass (Pinheiro 2006; Pin­heiro and Cunha 2006). Some bone surfaces are affected by putrefaction differently from others, especially in cases of soft tissue exposure after skinning. For the third possibility, Argaez and col­leagues (2011) have found in several Mexican pre­his panic sites that the black patches they documented on bone surfaces of dismembered and defleshed individuals corresponded to bitumen. According to the authors, the use of hot bitumen should have facilitated the process of tissue sepa­ration (Argaez et al. 2011:2987). 
Again, the depositional depth (and therefore rel­ative chronology) appears relevant when examin­ing the distributions of cultural marks within the assemblage under study. While none of the female

b 
crania from the later depositional phases appear to bear marks of violence or evidence for posthumous processing (although some of the crania were too eroded to discern any evidence positively), the majority of the deeper cranial deposits did show distinct signs of postmortem manipulation, mostly in the form of cutmarks. The comparison of cut­mark frequencies between the two depositional stages is highly significant (Chi squared = 15.539; 
df = 1 ; p = .000). Other indications of posthumous cultural processing correspond to scraping, per­formed on the fresh skull surface and possibly blackening. There are at least two cases of unhealed blunt force trauma among the female skulls of the deeper deposit, pointing to their violent death. 
Figures 10 and 11 illustrate the morphological characteristics and the distribution of the cutmarks, which we believe were performed by repetitive slicing with sharp lithic blades. Figure 10 shows the sum of all recorded cutmarks on a schematic skull representation. On the frontal bone, the marks are oriented roughly transversally (from side to side). The slicing concentrates on the lower fore­head, a skeletal area covered in the living by the musculo-fibrous frontal portion of the tendinous aponeurosis, which must have been cut in the course of the slicing. On the parietals, the slicing marks are grouped in the vertex of the skull and continue back and downwards to the occipital pro­trusion (inion). Facially, occasional marks appear on the lateral, upper, and lower margins of the orbital sockets, the malar bones, and the right max­illa. All cutting vestiges are associated with super­ficial areas of bone and areas where skin and connective tissue attach. In two cases, this pro­cessing is associated with marks of perimortem violence, expressed as unhealed blunt force trauma (Figure 12) . 

Conversely, no cutmarks were found on the cra­nia that may represent either muscle detachment from the neck or the face of the individuals, or sep­aration of the mandible from the head or the head from the rest of the body. It is important to under­score also that none of the mandibles or the post­cranial segments available for study showed any signs for muscle detachment that could stand for defleshing or dismemberment. Given the clear, uni­form pattern and distinctive anatomical distribu-

evident after reconstructing the sequence of dif­ferent formation and transformation processes and recording the shifts in ritual uses, as evidenced in the remains from Ossuary I. These changes in rit­ual practice should have occurred over a relatively short time span within the 400 years that the mound may have been used. 
Regarding the ritual discourse itself, most schol­ars still adhere to Torres' s ( 1972, 2004) initial inter­pretation, which , using Postclassic historical evidence asserts that the shrine was dedicated to the Death God Mictlantecuhtli and that the large terracotta figures and the female burials represent the remains of women who died in childbirth, the so-called cihuateteos. Complementary insights were put forth by Bertels (1997), who considers the terracotta figures to be personifications of Tla­zolteotl , the Aztec goddess of love. 
A recent review of the osteological material of all mound contexts reveals that the great majority of the 230 ceremonial interments (88.4 percent) were adult, and one third (29.7 percent) of them were males (Ortega 1999:407; 2009:189-190); this information renders simplistic the original inter­pretation of the mound as a purely female ritual depository, associated with women who died dur­ing the battle of parturition and linked to Tlazolteotl and the cihuateteos. It is noteworthy that no remains of perinatal infants were reported for Mound 2 or were recorded for later stages of use, including the present reexamination of the remains contained in Ossuary I. If Mound 2 was dedicated to women deceased in childbirth, what happened to the infants? Did they all survive childbirth (and their mother), or did they also die, but their remains were not viewed as sacred or significant enough to be added to the deposit? 
Overall, we consider that Mound 2 was not a place where the complete bodies of naturally deceased individuals (by childbirth or other rea­sons) were interred over time; the sex and age dis­tributions of those individuals who were deposited are contrary to any normal burial distribution. The stratigraphies of Ossuary I and Mound 2 are more consistent with a series of subsequent, large, con­secratory deposits that included ceramic vessels and figures, occasional stone sculptures, and the remains of ritually offered (and probably sacrificed) indi­viduals. As part of consecratory rites to new build­ing stages, such large offerings are now identified as a recurring practice in earthen architectural sequences from south-central Veracruz during the Classic period (Daneels 2008a, 2008b, 2011). 
Nor do the murals of El Zapotal (Wyllie 2010) highlight purely female actors, as only two, possi­bly four, of the twelve figures may be identified as female. Some of the human portraits are shown skeletonized, but there is no evidence in the icono­graphic program of flaying (either a skinned per­son , or a figure wearing a human skin) . The so-called cihuateteos are life-sized female terra­cotta figures that lack the demonic qualities asso­ciated with their Aztec counterparts , and with their large headdresses, fancy adornments, and ritual co pal bags, they could easily be classified as priest­esses. Besides, not all have their eyes closed to suggest they represent dead persons.10 Thus, while the presence of the lordly skeletal figure surely points to a shrine to the god of death, the associ­ated figures do not unequivocally point toward what centuries later would be known as cihuate­teos to the Aztecs. 
The analysis of the ossuary itself, as a separate context that postdates the termination and burial of the Death God shrine, adds ritual information. The comparison between deep (early) vs. shallow (late) crania shows that within the same deposit there is a change, or at least a divergence, in the ritual prac­tices and possibly the occasions that motivated them. Ossuary I apparently served first as a recep­tacle for both male and female skulls from indi­viduals, many of whom had been skinned prior to decomposing, and before some of their body parts were re-deposited in Ossuary I. In later stages, Ossuary I received purely skulls of young females and probably also postcranial segments with no signs of any earlier posthumous treatments or per­imortem violence. 
Regarding the identity of the individuals found in Ossuary I, it is noteworthy that most of the dead in the earlier stages of the deposit still showed the local body insignias of El Zapotal and its sur­rounding area in the form of their artificial head shape. Skulls appear strongly flattened on top, which is consonant with the earlier, local prefer­ence of head shapes in the Mixtequilla area and also other sites of the Rio Blanco and Rio Hondo val­leys like Tlalixcoyan, Nopiloa, Apachital, and Dicha Tuerta (Martinez de Le6n 2007: 101; 2009).

(re)interpretation of the formation processes involved and the ossuary's relationship to the Death God shrine, to the diverse and possibly changing ritual uses of Mound 2, and to the biological data and body treatments of those individuals whose remains gradually filled Ossuary I. 
First! y, our review of the stratigraphic evidence mandates a more careful approach when interpret­ing the symbolic and ritual discourse at Zapotal, considering the Death God shrine with its associ­ated polychrome murals as a separate stage from the termination offering that seals it. The latter con­tains the almost life-sized female figures (assumedly cihuateteos) and the multiple burial that included an offering of smiling figurines. As we have argued, their deposit postdates the use of the shrine and predates the excavation of the deep pit containing Ossuary I. Therefore, the collective deposit under study must not reflect the earlier rit­ual practices at El Zapotal, performed during the time the shrine of the Death God was functioning , but a later stage of occupation, after the shrine had already been dismantled and buried and the mound rebuilt. Until now, scholarship has tended to lump together the findings at El Zapotal as one single iconographic discourse and ritual program ( Gutier ­rez and Hamilton 1977; Ladr6n de Guevara 1997; Sanchez 2005; Torres 1972; Wyllie 2008, 2010) , thereby confusing different moments of use and merging different cultural contexts.

Ossuary I apparently served first as a recep­tacle for both male and female skulls from indi­viduals, many of whom had been skinned prior to decomposing, and before some of their body parts were re-deposited in Ossuary I. In later stages, Ossuary I received purely skulls of young females and probably also postcranial segments with no signs of any earlier posthumous treatments or per­imortem violence. 
Regarding the identity of the individuals found in Ossuary I, it is noteworthy that most of the dead in the earlier stages of the deposit still showed the local body insignias of El Zapotal and its sur­rounding area in the form of their artificial head shape. Skulls appear strongly flattened on top, which is consonant with the earlier, local prefer­ence of head shapes in the Mixtequilla area and also other sites of the Rio Blanco and Rfo Hondo val­leys like Tlalixcoyan, Nopiloa, Apachital, and Dicha Tuerta (Martinez de Leon 2007: 101; 2009). Likewise, the murals from Classic period Las

Higueras and the anthropomorphic clay statues from Paso de Ovejas express the strong superior cephalic flattening that was popular in the region at that time (Franco 1993). In the eastern parts of Mesoamerica we have associated this peculiar head profile with the head form of the Maya merchant deity, God L, who is depicted either with a wide­brimmed hat or a superior cephalic flattening sim­ilar to the cranial vaults from El Zapotal (Garcia and Tiesler 2011; Taube 1992; Tiesler 2012; Tiesler et al. 2010) . In the Maya area, superior vault flat­tening appears initially during the Middle and Late Classic period and becomes prominent among set­tlers of the Chiapanecan Isthmus territories and Terminal Classic and Postclassic coastal popula­tions surrounding the Yucatecan Peninsula (Garcia and Tiesler 2011; Tiesler 2012) . 

In a later stage ofuse ofOssuary I, only remains of females were added on top of the earlier remains. Interestingly, none of these crania bore the artifi­cial superior flattening that appears to represent the local pattern, which could imply either a non-local origin or a shift in local preferences late in the occu­pation at El Zapotal. Given the exclusively female presence and the age profile of the crania, we ask ourselves if the pelvic bones (and other postcranial segments) belong to the crania from this later stage of deposition. The distinctive sex and age profile, which in the case of the tabulated pelvic bones cor­responds to women between 15 and 25 years of age at death with parturition marks, warrants an inter­pretation of women who died from childbirth, at least for the upper part of the deposit, an appraisal put forth originally by Romano (1975). Our bio­graphic profile upholds this idea, as this profile would be expected in a special disposal of the remains of women having died after giving child­birth. Although we cannot confirm this conclusion, such a profile would imply that these women did not die on certain, prescribed calendar dates, nor that they were put to death by others. 
Regarding the early stages of use of Ossuary I, both males and females appear to have been deposited, many of them after being flayed. Flay­ing (and possibly associated blackening) has not been reported from the earlier publications on the skeletons from El Zapotal, except for Garcia's unpublished thesis of 2007. It therefore appears to represent a new type of mortuary practice, in use after the Death God shrine had been sealed already. 
The patterns of cutmarks identified on the crania that appeared in the lower part of Ossuary I are con­sistent with the process of obtaining a flayed skin to be worn, as shown in the ceramic figures from the area(Figure 13).11 This practice vanished, at least in Mound 2 of El Zapotal, as the upper part of the deposit shows a change in mortuary treatment, with no cutmarks, scraping marks, or black stains, and a purely female presence showing a variety of cra­nial forms. As their physiological characteristics identify them as women of child-bearing age, the hypothesis of the so-called cihuateteos arises again, but now quite independently from the Death God shrine of the previous building stage. Because we still have no solid osteological population figures for Late Classic south-central Veracruz, it is diffi­cult to establish whether that age range is an aver­age death age for women. 
For most of Mesoamerica 's cultures there is only scant information regarding specific motivations and practices of flaying during ritual festivities, despite the wealth of taphonomic documentation (Botella et al. 1999; Pijoan and Pastrana 1981; Tiesler and Cucina 2007, 201 O; TurnerII and Turner 1999). Specifically regarding pre-Aztec evidence of flaying, besides its representation on ceramic fig­urines, no confirmed information exists on the occa­sions and ritual connotations that might have evolved into the Postclassic forms and functions of rituals demanding the detachment of human skin for central Veracruz (although some cases are reported from the neighboring Maya area: see Hurtado et al. 2007; Medina and Sanchez 2007; Mock 1998; Tiesler 2007) . This lack of information includes Classic period centers in Veracruz like El Tajfn. which staged elaborate ritual programs including human sacrifice. Here, no iconographic or skeletal indications for flaying have been found (Koontz 2009:82; Sitton 2010). 
Notwithstanding its obscure origins in the Clas­sic, we know that the act of flaying became a gen­eralized post-sacrificial practice during the Late Postclassic period. Among the Mexica, this prac­tice of tlacaxipehualiztli was destined to honor gods and goddesses of the earth, vegetation, and harvest (Gonzalez 1985; Soustelle 1982), specifically Tlat­zolteotl, who was considered the female counter­part of Xipe Totec, the flayed god (Durand-Forest 2001:235). This mythical connotation seems to find its first expression in the Classic Gulf Coast cul-
