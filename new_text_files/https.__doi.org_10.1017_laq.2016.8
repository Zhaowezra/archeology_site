Hunter-gatherers collected and used various woody species depending on the landscape, availability of plant communities, and sociocultural considerations. With extensive paleo-wetlands and groundwater-fed oases, the Atacama Desert was interspersed with riparian woodlands that provided vital resources (fuel, water, and game) at the end of the Pleistocene in areas such as the Pampa del Tamarugal (PdT) basin. We use anthracological analyses to determine thefuelmanagement strategiesof hunter-gatherersocietiesin this hyperaridenvironment andexplorewhether the “Principleof LeastEffort” applies.First,wepresent thecombustion qualities andcharacteristicsof woody taxafrom theAtacama and analyze possibleexploitationstrategies.Second, we use anthracological analysesfrom Quebrada Maní12 (QM12),a late Pleistocenearchaeologicalsite (datedfrom 12,750to 11,530calB.P.) locatedinthePdT basin,toshowthe prevalenceof twowoody species that were eitherfreshlycollected or gathered(very likely on purpose)from subfossilwood. Ourresultssuggestthatfuel selectionstrategieswerebasedonpriorknowledgeofthe qualitiesofthesewoodytaxaandhow theyburned.Thus we conclude that fuel management was partof a numberof social and economic decisions that allowed for effective colonization ofthis region. Furthermore, we stress the need for caution when using charcoal to exclusively date archaeological sites located in desert environments.

ollowing the domestication of .re, wood becamethe main sourceof thermal energy for prehistoric humans. Wood as a raw material has beenakeylimitingfactorin human adaptation becauseit affectsseveral basic activ­ities such as cooking, heating, illumination, defense, land-use changes, and so on. The study of charcoal,combustionremains,andotherwood management practices provides a unique oppor­tunity to expand our knowledge of fuel use and evolution over time and as a consequence of environmental change. Such archaeobotanical studies further our insight into the dynamics of social processes and the relationship between societies and environments(e.g.,PiquéiHuerta 1999;Seijo et al.2016). 
Scientists use traditional, experimental, and analytical anthracological methods, as well as ethnoarchaeological approaches, to explore, understand, and explain the social management of wood (Dufraisse 2012; Henry et al. 2009; Joly et al. 2009;March1992;Marconetto2010; Scheel-Ybert and Dias 2007;Théry-Parisot and Henry 2012). The taxonomic identi.cation of those species used as fuel can provide further data for local and regional paleoenvironmental reconstructions. Indeed, this was the emphasis of the earliest anthracological studies (Bazile-Robert 1982;Chabal1992;Marguerie and Hunot 2007;Thiébault1989;Vernet1973). 
Reconstructing wood management practices fromthe archaeological charcoal recordisa sig­ni.cant multidisciplinary challenge.To address this relationship, we show how anthracological analysesbasedonfuel propertiesandexploratory experimentation(sensuMarch et al. 2012)inthe hyperarid environment of the Atacama Desert can be used to de.ne fuel exploitation strategies among hunter-gatherer groups that inhabitedthis area during the late Pleistocene (ca. 13,000– this purpose, including the Principle of Least Effort. 
We studied charcoal and wood samples from the archaeological site Quebrada Maní 12 (QM12; Figure1), located in the Pampa del Tamarugal(~21°S, PdT), a large inland basin locatedintheAtacamaDesert.This area, de.ned asextreme,is characterizedby itshyperaridity, whichhas remained stablesincethelateNeogene (Jordan et al. 2014) due to the predominance of high evaporation rates and the absence of local rainfall(<1 mm/year; Dirección General de Agua 2007). Vegetation is restricted to a discrete oasis where underground and surface waterresources aredischarged. 
QM12 is one of the .rst known human set­tlementsinthe region (12,750–11,530 cal B.P.; SupplementalTable1);it emergedatatimewhen substantial local freshwater and woody vege­tation existed. These local paleoenvironmental conditions were driven by greatly increased precipitation water budgets in the high Andes during the so-called Central Andean Pluvial Event (CAPE).Thisledtoelevatedwater tables and perennial river .ow throughout the PdT. The resulting oases of riparian vegetation may have played a key role in the dispersion of the .rst inhabitantsofthisextreme environment and likelyfacilitatedthe initial colonizationof west­ern South America (Gayo et al. 2012; Latorre et al. 2013; Nester et al. 2007; Santoro et al. 2011). 
Like anypopulation enteringa newterritory, the.rstinhabitantsofthe PdTfaced theproblem of discovering and managing resources fortheir survival and social reproduction. This research aims to understand how fuel was managed in such anextremeenvironment.Consequently,our research question was de.ned as follows: Was thefuel managementof the.rst hunter-gatherer

Asageneralhypothesis,weproposethat these groups, living in an extreme environment with lowdiversity and fuelavailability—and despite thepresenceofoases—followedthe“Principleof LeastEffort”(PLE)as de.nedbyShackletonand Prins(1992). Thisinvolved collectingany wood athandin proportiontoits occurrence.Ifthiswas the case, anthracological analysis shouldreveala broad representationofwoody species (trees and shrubs) in terms of taxonomical composition. Otherwise,taxa selectionshouldbeevident,indi­cating that the hunter-gatherer groups selected the best fuel wood for their activities from an abundanceofwoody resources.Inthis case,PLE would not apply and choice of fuel wood was likelydrivenbyculturalrequirements. 
To answer our research questions, we fol­lowed two procedures to understand and de.ne rawmaterialexploitationstrategiesfor combus­tion, according to availability and variability of woody taxa: (1) an anatomical and taxonomic characterization of charcoal remains from the QM12 site, and (2) an experimental study of the physical properties and combustion behavior of nativewood samples fromthe AtacamaDesert in different states of preservation to determine their potential as sources of fuel. Our .nal goal was to show that anthracological analy­sesarekeyfor understanding fuel management and its relationship to the behavior and adapt­ability of the .rst inhabitants of the Atacama Desert. 
Vegetation and Climate 
The PdT is an extensive endorheic basin that spans fromtheLongitudinalValley(Intermediate Depression) into theAndean piedmontof north­ernChile (19°17i–21°30iS;Figure1).Elevations range from 1,000 to 1,600 masl (Japan Inter­national CooperationAgency 1995). Hyperarid conditions in the PdT date back to theNeogene (12±1Ma; Jordan et al.2014)and are character­izedby highevaporation(>2,000 mm/year) and an almost complete absence of local rainfall(<1 mm/year; DGA 2007). Vegetation is restricted to distinct oases formed by groundwater dis­charge that sustain patchy phreatic-halophytic ecosystems with low species diversity. Further

to the north (19°17–21°S), perennial streams occur along quebradas (ravines or deeplyincised canyons). There, emergent groundwater tables along thevalley.oorsprovide enough moisture for riparian forests to exist alongside a large number of endemic and native taxa, including

P. tamarugo(Gajardo 1994;Gutierrezetal.1998; Luebert 2004;Villagrán et al.1999). 
Only small and intermittent streams occur in the southern area of the PdT (21°–21°30iiS), including Quebrada Maní, Quebrada Sipuca (Figure1;Gayoetal.2012;Nesteretal. 2007), and the Salar de Llamara (a salt .at located ~20kmsoutheastfromtheQM12site;Figure1). Except for occasional .ash .oods and mud.ows (Houston 2001), these quebradas lack peren­nial water sources and are almost devoid of vegetation. 
The PdT experienced major ecological and hydrological transformations triggered by large positivehydrological anomaliesinthe adjacent highlands (Gayoet al. 2012;Nesteretal. 2007; Workman 2012).TheCAPEeventinvolvedtwo main phases dating back to 17,500–14,200 cal 
B.P. and 13,800–9,700 cal B.P. (Latorre et al. 2006;Placzeketal.2009).Twopulsesofriparian vegetation growth have been documented in Quebrada Maní (17,200–16,100 cal B.P. and 13,400–11,400 cal B.P.) that are coeval with both CAPE stages (Gayo et al. 2012). By the second CAPE phasealarge wetland had formed in Quebrada Maní (ca. 11,200–9,500 cal B.P.; Workman 2012). 


Materials and Methods 
Thestudied archaeological site,QM12, liesatthe headofthealluvialfanofQuebradaManí (1,240 masl, ~21° S) on an erosional remnant(~1.6 km2)ofthe Upper Miocene alluvial (T1) terrace (Latorre et al. 2013). The surface is composed of desert pavement, a distinctive trait of arid environmentsthatis typically formedbyalayer of thermally fractured clastsofvariablesizesand kinds (sur.cial archaeological layer). Thepave­ment also contains multiple lithicsinterspersed among the natural clasts.Lithic artifactsinclude bifaces, bifacial trimming .akes, and debitage, in different stages of manufacture and made out of either local (i.e., basalt) or allochthonous rawmaterials (high-quality siliceous rocks). Pro­jectile points, morphologically attributable to the late Pleistocene epoch, are common at the surface. Artifacts from later periods are very scarce (two pottery sherds within an area of 
1.6km2;Latorre et al.2013). 
A loose, very .ne matrix, locally known as chusca (Avyz horizon), occurs underneath the pavement; it is made up of silt, gypsum, and anhydrite, and can include surface clasts (Adelsberger et al. 2013; Ewing et al. 2006; Finstadet al. 2014;McFaddenetal.1987).The thickness of the Avyz is variable and it is often underlainby layersof sand with silt pockets(ca. 4–5 cm), followed by a second pedogenic salt crustofunknown thickness(Byzm soil horizon). This horizonis culturally sterile;small blocksof this salt crustare reworked into the Avyzhorizon (Latorre et al. 2013). 
An archaeological excavation of 12 m2 (QM12c) was conducted and reached 30–35 cm in depth (until the Byzm). Five distinct archaeological layers, numbered from top to bottom, contained numerous debitage and extra local raw materials such as Paci.c seashells (cf. Concholepas concholepas,cf. Nassarius gayi,and cf.Argobuccinum rude),plant remains, wooden artifacts (a proximal end of an atlatl spear shaft and a possible scraper haft), red pigment, bone remains(including an apparently cut camelidbone fragment),andacamelidcopro­lite (Latorre et al. 2013). In layer 3 we found an in situ prepared .replace (F1) containing a large amount of charcoal. Charcoal remains of variable sizes and mass were found throughout the four archaeological layers. Nineteen AMS 14C dates were performed on different types of materials, such as charcoal,plants,wood, feces, and seashells (SupplementalTable1).These ages indicate that human occupation occurred over a period of approximately 1,000 years, between 12,750 and 11,750 cal B.P., and that this site served as a location for various daily chores: wood, bone, and lithic tool elaboration; hunting; butchering; food preparation; cooking on a spit; and food consumption(Latorreet al. 2013). 
The archaeological context and chronology show that the shallow and loose stratigraphic deposit and its extended surface, scattered with artifacts that are affected by vertical and horizontal migration, was inhabited for almost a millennium at the end of the Pleistocene. This was part of a continental-scale human

colonizationthatwastaking placeatthe timein South America. Thus the peoplethat recurrently occupied this space made permanent features, such as the prepared .replace dug into the hard crust of caliche. The excavated artifacts show that they were skilled lithic knappers and hunters, knowledgeable about plant gath­ering and other resources. An obsidian .ake and artifacts made from shells indicate that these people had accessto coastal and highland resources. This implies that they knew how to obtain resources from those ecosystems, or that theymaintainedexchange interactions with other groups outside the PdT. 
Oneofthe interestingfeaturesof site QM12 is that four AMS dates on charcoal were anoma­louslytooold(ranging between16,800to14,400 cal B.P.;SupplementalTable1).Such early dates couldresultfromthe useofoldor subfossilwood asasourceof combustionmaterial(i.e., inbuilt ages). Moreover, several dates are stratigraphi­cally inverted, most likely caused by activities carried outby hunter-gatherersinthe campsite, post-depositional processes, or the use of old wood as fuel (subfossil wood that can remain in thelandscapeforseveral millennia; Latorreetal. 2013). 
Anthracological Analyses 
To determine archaeological charcoal character­istics, we used several methods and materials. First, we created a charcoal reference collec­tion from fresh wood from the modern native woody taxa of the Atacama Desert for the purposeoftaxonomic identi.cations.Keysteps involved:(1)Collectingsamplesof50 taxa along elevational transects carried out in the Arica and Parinacota Region(17–18° S and 0–4,500 masl) and in the Salar de Atacama(~22° 30i S and 2,400–3,400 masl). Taxonomic identi.ca­tions were conducted at theBotanyDepartment Herbarium of the Universidad de Concepción; 
(2) Preparation of comparative anthracological samples through carbonization of wood frag­ments from each of the 50 taxa; and (3) Def­inition of anatomical features of charcoal and wood samples based on observation under an episcopic microscope (Olympus BX41M, mag­ni.cation 100X, 200X, and 500X) on three anatomical planes—transverse, radial, and tan­gential(Figure2 and SupplementalTable2). 
Next, we collected 33 samples of unburned, subfossil timber from thelatestPleistocene ter­racesof Quebrada Maní(11samples), Quebrada Sipuca (21 samples), and Salar de Llamara(1 sample; Figure3 andTable1).They wereiden­ti.edasaboveandwe characterized theirspeci.c microscopic alterations. 
Finally, we determined the taxa according to the reference collection and observed the degree of alteration of twenty sample batches of archaeological charcoal fromthe stratigraphic layer of QM12, focusing on the prepared .re­place. Charcoal samples were obtained by .ota­tion in the laboratory to recover all possible sizes.Over200 charcoals from each stratigraphic level ofQM12werestudied to ensure that the samples were representative. A total of 1,810 archaeological charcoals were observed under the three anatomical planes to determine the taxa. Thedegreeof alterationof archaeological charcoals was de.ned by using an ordinal scale of criteria observable under the microscope. This included thefollowing properties: structure alteration (deformation, radial and tangential cracks, molten areas, vitri.cation), brightness, and hardness. Based on the degree of alter­ation, fourlevelsof combustionwereestablished that do not necessarily correspond to the dura­tion or heat intensity at the time of burning (Figure4): 
Level0: Partiallyburned charcoal. 
Level1: Soft charcoal; dull; deformations and 
cracks are few or absent. Taxonomic 
identity is easily established. 
Level2: Shiny charcoal with cracks and some 
deformities; hard, but can be cut. 
Taxonomic identity can usually be 
established. 
Level3: Shiny charcoal; some samples have 
signs of vitri.cation; hardness ranges 
from friable to extremely hard. The 
extent of cracking or deformation can 
make taxonomic identi.cation hardto 
establish. 
We also observed features not directly linked to combustion such as fungus action,

Such features may be also related to tree size, age, and degree of lig­ni.cation(Schweingruber 1990;Schweingruber etal. 2006;Sunetal.2006).Forinstance,inoak species(Quercus spp.), tylosis occurs in trees over15yearsold(Bakour2003)orthoseaffected by traumas caused by various agents such as fungus, bacteria, and hydric stress (Carlquist 2001;Schweingruber1990;Schweingruber et al. 2006, 2011;Sun et al.2006).

(M. pavonis, P. alba, S. molle, and Tessaria absinthioides) and four subfossil samples (C. aphylla, Prosopis sp., S. molle, and an unde­termined taxon)(Table2). From each of these specimens, we sampled branches of 0.5–2 cm

Results 
MicroscopicObservations and Anthrocological Analyses 
In general, subfossil wood and archaeological charcoalspresent tissues with highly deteriorated cellular structures. Pores appear deformed in cross section, which certainly hindered micro­scope observations. For radial and tangential sections,the observationofsmall elements(e.g., pitsand spiral thickening)wasdif.cult.Several samplespresented xylophagous insectgalleries. Wedetected tylosesinsomesamples assignedto 
S. molle and Prosopis sp.(Figure5). 
Despite the poor preservation of subfossil wood, taxonomic assignment to genus or species was possible for two-thirds of the 33 samples. Overall taxonomic diversity is low, represented by only four taxa, particularly by trees such as Prosopis sp., S. molle, and E. angustifolia; 
C. aphylla, a woody shrub, was also identi.ed (Table1). The unidenti.ed species in this table include P. tamarugoand P. alba,which we were not able to distinguish because of very similar anatomical features. 
In contrast, the resolution for taxonomi­cal determinations of archaeological charcoals, inferred from the description of the anatomical sections of various identi.ed species presented in Supplemental Table 2, was comparatively higher (97 percent; n = 1,756; Figures2 and 6).Thetaxonomicdiversitywaslow (three taxa) and dominated by two species identi.ed as the trees S. molle and M. pavonis (which no longer grows in Quebrada Maní); both are found in every level and in the prepared .replace (F1) at QM12(Figure6).

TheLower Calori.cValue(LCV)ofsubfossil wood ranges from 4,063 to 4,510 kcal/kg, within the known range of broad-leaf wood (Senelwa and Sims 1999). More precisely, the LCV for anhydrous wood from deciduous trees has a calculated meanof 4,300 kcal/kg, whereaswood from coniferous trees average 4,600 kcal/kg (Vautherin 1995). 
In general, subfossil wood tends to have higher ash content,whichvaries from 6.1to7.7 percent(Table2).ExcludingP. alba(7.0 percent; Table2),the percentagevaluesofash contentfor recent wood are smaller and range from 5.4 to 
2.4 percent. Even though the amount of ash is differentforsubfossiland modernwood samples, the values fall in the upper ranges for wood obtained from desert phreatophytic trees (Habit 1985).Itis likelythatthereductionoftheLCV producedbythepresenceofhighash contentis offsetbyahigher presenceofextractiveelements in someof thesesamples(Prosopis spp.), which are known forhavinga higher LCV than other wood components(White1987).Sample density varies between .61 and 1.21 g/cm3 in modern and subfossil wood. 
CombustionAnalysisof SubfossilWood 
The results obtained show that subfossil wood is more dif.cult to ignite than modern wood. Ignition times ranged from5 to 22 minutes(µ = 14 minutes; Supplemental Table 3). These samplesproduced .amesof short duration, rang­ingfrom 0 to 22 minutes(µ = 12 minutes), that wereslowlyextinguished, forminghot coals, and then were completelyreducedto ashes.The time from when the .ames were extinguished untilthetemperaturestartedtodrop rangedfrom 21 minutes (experiment number 3) to 86 min­utes, with a mean of 53 minutes of combustion timewithout .ame. During combustion, temper­atures ranged from 350° to 500°C(Figure8). An exceptionally high temperature of 768°C was recorded in experiment 2 using Prosopis .rewood(Figure8). 
S. molle and M. pavonis charcoals show very different levels of alteration. M. pavonis char­coalshavefew alterations(level1)and charcoal is easily identi.ed, whereas S. molle charcoals are more altered (levels 2 and 3). Although combustion and differential conservation cannot be totally excluded, it is most likely that this degree of alteration preceded the combustion event.The presence of tylosesinlarge numbers onlyin S. molle charcoal couldbe due to several factors.The absenceof fungusand xylophageous galleries indicate that the S. molle wood did not suffer attacks from these organisms. More likely,itwashydric stress (Schweingruber 1990; Schweingruber et al. 2011)that caused tyloses formationinour samples. S. molle isafacultative phreatophyte that grows preferentially in areas that are occasionally .ooded along perennial or ephemeral quebradas in the Atacama Desert; it survives drought by obtaining water from uncon.ned aquifers(Gayoetal. 2012).Alackof .ooding oraloweringofthe groundwater table couldtrigger theformationof tylosesin QM12 
S. molle charcoalsasa resultofhydric stress. 
The other possibility is that the charcoals comefrom heartwoodoftreesoldenoughtoform tyloses (Carlquist 2001; Schweingruber et al. 2006, 2011). Heartwood is more resistant to attacks by insects and denser than sapwood; the presence of tyloses makes wood more resistant to decay (Taylor et al. 2002). The abundance of tyloses taken together with the altered structure (degree of alteration 2 and 3) seen in S. molle charcoalssuggestthat theseoriginated from the combustion of subfossil wood that remained on the landscape from trees that grew in groves, possiblythousandsof years beforethe QM12 site occupation. This would also explain why fresh 
S. molle wood samples we collected in the area surrounding thesitedo not show anytyloses. 
Modern and subfossil wood taxa have differ­ent properties but both tend to have good .re­wood quality. Results from physical-chemical properties analyses of modern and subfossil wood, however, suggest that each category has different qualities. Subfossil wood exhibited lowermoisturelevelsandhigherash percentages. But LCV for these samples is almost the same as modern wood. Density can be in.uenced by wood moisture,butvalues can stillbe compared, since the difference in the moisture content is very small and does not signi.cantly change basic density.Variationsin density and moisture

play a key role in combustion, despite their calori.cvalue.Woods withlower density (less wall in the .bers) and higher moisture levels do not last as long in the .re. Woods with higher density and lower moisture levels, such as the subfossil samples, take longer to burn out and would be considered better .rewoods (Kataki and Konwer 2001; Vautherin 1995). Nonetheless, these are also more .re-resistant and take longer to ignite. In contrast, due to their higher moisture level and lower density level, modernwoods are easiertoignitebuthave shorter combustion times. 
Both S. molle and M. pavonis are long-stemmed and thick-branching trees with wood thatexhibits similarphysical properties. S. molle is denser than M. pavonis but has a higher moistureandash content,makingit less suitable as fuel(Table2). The two species constituted most of the charcoal we examined. The mono­cotyledon stemsidenti.ed in our samples could havebeenusedtolightthe.re.Small quantities of other species that may have been used for tinder may not havebeen preservedand therefore cannot be excluded. 


Discussion 
Thetaxonomic richnessfoundin charcoal from the QM12 site shows an unusual pattern of preferential selection toward just two trees, 
S. molle and M. pavonis, even though a broad variety of woody species was available in the PdT.Indeed,Gayoetal.(2012)haveshown that several species of trees (Escallonia angustifo­lia, Myrica pavonis, Schinus molle, Caesalpinia aphylla) and shrubs (Baccharis scandans, Tessaria absinthioides) were present in the Tamarugal basin during the late Quaternary, from 17,000 to 11,000 cal B.P. Furthermore, the archaeological context shows that these peo­ple had access to special coastal and high­land resources (e.g., shells and obsidian). This means that they couldhavealsoimportedtrade woods from nearby ecosystemsbutchose not to. Conversely, the few anthracological analyses of hunter-gatherer sites from the higher elevation regions of the central and southernAndes show the opposite.Indeed,awider taxonomicdiversity in charcoals with a general predominance of shrubs has been documented for early Holocene hunter-gatherer camps in the Puna of Argentina (Barberena 2015;Joly 2008;Jolyetal. 2009; Rivero 2012;Rodriguez1999, 2000, 2005). This impliesthat the.rstinhabitantsofthe Atacama Desert were not constrained by the environment and that the PLE hypothesis does not apply in this context. Our results show that main driversoffuelwood management were cultural and that wood was abundant enough to allow people to select what they considered the best choices. 
Our study indicates a selection preference for thicker wood, regardless of its availabil­ity (Joly 2008;Jolyetal. 2009). The lack of charcoals attributable to a M. pavonis in strati­graphiclevels 1–4 mayhave been theresultof apreservationbias becauseofits rapidignition

andlowerproductionofcharcoals(comparedto 
S. molle). We speculate that M. pavonis was used as tinder(a role associated with herbaceous materials) tokeep the S. molle combustion from dying out.Ourexperimental results indicatethat an open .replace could have been run using only subfossil wood as fuel, but it would have been dif.culttoignite,burning .amelessly and without achieving very high temperatures. The choice of M. pavonis dry .rewood as tinder by the peopleofQM12suggests that they had some experimental knowledge and know-how regarding combustible materials. The selection of S. molle subfossil .rewood over a number of other possibilities mayhave been motivatedby non-excluding factors such as (1) its character as a thick .rewood that was useful to stoke the .re without burning out the wood, or (2) its subfossil character of heartwood preservation that gives it extraordinary dryness and density, and the presence of tyloses, which accords a higher calori.c value. 
This clear selectionofsubfossil S. molle wood stronglysuggests that theQM12 occupantswere familiarwithits qualities. Indeed,the limitedtaxa ofwood usedin combustionatQM12implies that during the occupation of the QM12 site, there were no changes in wood management, even though thereweredifferent rawmaterials available(i.e., Prosopis sp.). 
Our study further implies that 14C dates of early sites likeQM12shouldbewithheld from chronological consideration until it is con.rmed that they are not derived from subfossil wood chosen by ancient people. This is a relatively straightforwardtaskwhen dates are anomalously old but more dif.cult when the ages are con­cordant with other materials. Such .ndings are relevant to most charcoal dates in the northern Atacama Desert, where the hyperarid environ­ment preserves wood very well, as seen in other archaeological records from arid regions (Schif­fer 1986). Although the “oldwood” issueis not new,anychronology relatedtoculturalprocesses involving site formation and radiometric dating inaridenvironmentsmusttakeinto consideration the possible and indeed purposeful selection of subfossil wood for its fuel qualities (Barniak et al. 2013; Kennett et al. 2002; Klusek and Pawelczyk 2014; Kolá.retal. 2014; Schiffer 1986). This issueisusually not considered when discussing artifactsintroduced into thearchaeo­logical chronologiesof northernChile. 


Conclusion 
The anthracological methodology applied herein a context ofhunter-gatherer societies duringthe late Pleistoceneinthehyperarid AtacamaDesert opensanewperspectiveoncombustionresource managementin an environmentdevoidofdiverse raw material. Although one would expect the applicationofthe PrincipleofLeastEfforttofuel management at Quebrada Maní 12, the behavior of hunter-gatherersshows thata notablelevelof organization and decision-makingwasinvolved. These decisions were based on experimental technical knowledge regardingthe propertiesof the local woody species. The occupants likely chosedry S. molle wood for combustion because theyhad discovered its qualities ofhardness and density (as a result of heartwood preservation and tylose presence).Thesesubfossillogs could have been found around the domestic activity area on the T1 surface (Latorre et al. 2013). Thesecond element selected for combustionwas dry wood from M. pavonis trees, which likely grew at the same time when the occupation took place.Itis possiblethat theQM12 people preferred these two woody species to other taxa available in the area because both taxa produce thick .rewood that is easy to collect and possesses good combustion qualities. Given the anatomical and physical-chemical features of these woods, their combustion as a whole wasatechnological solutionthat allowed hunter-gatherers to overcome the dif.culty of burning 
S. molle subfossil wood. Adding M. pavonis dry wood to the combustion process would have made ignition and combustion easier(with the helpofother tinder). Thisexploitation patternof fuel logs differs fromwhat had been observedin other prehispanicsocietiesfromthe central and southernAndes (Escolaet al. 2013;Joly 2008; Joly et al. 2009;Rodriguez2000). 
Experiments and the resulting physical-chemical characterization(calori.c value, den­sity, moisture, and ash rates) allowed us to understandthepropertiesofeachofthespecies foundatthesite.Thesefurther complementedthe

taxonomic identi.cations as well as the anthra­cological anatomical observations. Such a com­bination of analytical procedures is key for broadening and complementing our understand­ing of fuel economy in environmental and chronological contexts of human occupation toward the endof thePleistocenein thehyperarid core of Atacama. In summary, anthracological analyses representakey tool for understanding fuel managementinextremeenvironments, such as deserts,wheresubfossilwoodcanbefoundon the surface that might be thousands of years old andwasvery likelyusedbyprehistoric dwellers. This interesting subject will be the aim of future publications. 
Finally, the studies at QM12, the .rst late Pleistocene archaeological site at the core of the Atacama Desert, opens up the discussion of the processes of human colonization of the western side of the Andes, where coastal and highland camps show clear evidence of human occupation by the end of the Pleistocene. The results have allowed us to better interpret the systemic contextofthese hunter-gatherer groups, who show environmental experience and a will­ingness to experiment on the ecosystem of the Atacama Desert. This supports the idea that steady regional processesofhuman colonization weretakingplaceinSouth Americabytheendof thePleistocene. Thus,local, cultural, and social variationmay account formuch earlierprocesses ofexplorationofthe continentandthe possibility that more than one migratoryroutewas followed by the earliest South Americans.
