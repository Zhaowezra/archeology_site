(Chapter 2) focus on the administrative ambitions of 
Monte Alban in the Valley of Oaxaca ca. 300-100 B.C. 
Specifically, they contrast the autonomy maintained by 
the nearbyTilcajete polity with Monte Alban's conquest 
of the distant Cuicatlan Canada polity. Various resistance 
strategies supposedly implemented by Tilcajete are dis­
cussed (e.g., population increase and nucleation), but the 
interpretations are largely unconvincing. Moreover, 
alternative explanations are not considered. For exam­
ple, the authors suggest that active resistance by local 
polities like Tilcajete encouraged Monte Alban's con­
quest of less populous, although more distant polities 
like Cuicatlan. However, perhaps Cuicatlan was incor­
porated first because it provided agricultural products 
not available in the Valley of Oaxaca, a motivation anal­
ogous to early Aztec conquest of Morelos where cotton 
was available. This important ecological detail comes 
to light only well into the following chapter by Christina 
Elson (Chapter 3). Elson uses archaeological data and 
sixteenth-century ethnohistoric information to discuss 
varying strategies used by Monte Alban after 100 B.C. 
to integrate local elites at three secondary centers in the 
Valley of Oaxaca. A general suggestion is made that the 
Monte Alban rulers influenced their intermediate coun­
terparts by controlling access to the material trappings 
associated with noble status. This suggestion is reason­
able, but many specific arguments are supported by lim­
ited or incomplete data, which in some cases are not 
clearly qualified (e.g., why are obsidian implements 
necessarily considered "elite goods"?). 
Tung and Cook (Chapter 4) discuss the expansion of the elite class at Conchopata, a subject of the Wari Empire. Using burial data, they demonstrate that over time the number of elite strata increased dramatically. There are many interesting points made by this study, especially the interpretations regarding local ritual prac­tices. These merits notwithstanding, the burial data need to be better contextualized in relation to the site in gen­eral; why exactly are these burials interpreted as elite? This question required more attention given the high level of physical stress reflected by the skeletal mater­
ial, a condition acknowledged by the authors. 
Conlee and Schreiber (Chapter 5) examine sociopo­litical change in the Nasca region during and after the Wari Empire, beginning with a wonderful overview of the Nazca chronology (I recommend that readers unfa­miliar with this sequence read this chapter before Chap­ter 4). Based on settlement pattern data, the inferences regarding social factions both for and against the Wari Empire are well supported. The discussion for the period following the Wari collapse, however, is somewhat unclear. Apparently, during this time elites dispersed to many settlements, diversifying their power baes by tak­ing control over a wider range of activities (e.g., ceramic production). At one point the authors argue that this 
process created multiple elite strata, yet they conclude 
by suggesting that during this period the elites became 
less internally diverse. 
One minor general criticism of the volume is that 
some of the maps were inadequate, hard to read, or not 
labeled well enough to complement the narration. This 
point is unfortunate because it may frustrate a clear 
understanding of the arguments for readers unfamiliar 
with the local geographies. Nevertheless, this volume 
allowed me to clarify my understanding of "elites" as a 
category and the infinite variation characterizing elite 
behavior. An important and unresolved question high­
lighted throughout the chapters was whether persistent 
local elite traditions reflect active resistance to central 
authority or the calculated tolerance of ruling overlords. 
This debate is especially difficult to resolve with archae­
ological data alone, but it certainly represents a chal­
lenge worthy of future research on this captivating topic.

In his foreword, ethnohistorian Matthew Restall calls this book "the single most significant intellectual assault on the Great Wall that has divided 'Postclassic Mesoamerica' of archaeologists and the 'colonial Mex­ico' of historians." While I agree with this assessment of the importance of the book, the chapters demonstrate some of the obstacles yet to be overcome before we can begin to claim any kind of adequate understanding of the social effects of the Spanish conquest as reflected in the archaeological record. 
Chapter 1, an informative introduction by the edi­tors, places the volume within wider empirical and the­oretical contexts. Kepecs and Alexander note that a major contribution of the chapters is documentation of the great variability in the nature, operation, and results of Spanish colonialism within greater Mesoamerica. Susan Evans follows with a systematic analysis of images of indigenous-style palaces in a Spanish map from 1550. Enrique Rodriguez-Alegria describes con­sumption patterns of ceramic serving wares at three early colonial houses in Mexico City. Thomas Charl­ton, Cynthia Otis Charlton, and Patricia Fournier pre­sent an informative synthesis of demography, settlement, and ceramics at rural and urban contexts in the Basin of Mexico before and after the Spanish conquest. Helen Pollard summarizes documentary data on the fate of the 
Tarascan Empire under Spanish domination. Janine

Gasco presents documentary and archaeological data on pre-and post-conquest periods at five communities in Chiapas. 
Mark Lycett discusses a seventeenth-century mission in New Mexico. Although it does not deal with "Mesoamerica," this chapter provides a nice contrast with the others in terms of archaeological remains and social dynamics. It makes one wonder whether Mesoamerica is a useful scale of analysis for research on the social expressions of Spanish imperialism. Mov­ing to the Maya realm, Susan Kepecs applies world sys­tem theory to the Late Postclassic and Early Colonial periods in northern Yucatan. Don Rice and Prudence Rice describe documentary data and limited architec­tural data on Postclassic and Colonial sites in the Peten. Rani Alexander compares a detailed archaeological study of a Postclassic site (Isla Cilvituk) to documen­tary data (supplemented by one day of archaeological survey) at a Colonial site (Sahcabchen) in Campeche. Finally, Joel Palka analyzes archaeological remains from nineteenth-century Lacandon Maya sites. There is no synthesis or concluding chapter. 
Several chapters present little or no archaeological data, and in most of the remaining chapters the archae­ological coverage of the Colonial period is rudimentary and spotty. Where are the basic data on Colonial period settlement patterns, demography, trade, production, urbanism, and household consumption, topics that are staples of Mesoamerican archaeology? Although there are special problems of post-conquest archaeological data that hinder the analysis of some of these topics, I am disappointed at the "Great Wall" between Postclas­sic and Colonial archaeology that runs through many of the chapters in the book. It is not clear to what extent the minimal discussion of Colonial archaeological data in the book is compensated for by more extensive pre­sentations of data in other publications. 
For some chapters, the "archaeological perspectives" of the book's subtitle refer to archaeologists interpret­ing Colonial documentary data (usually from secondary sources and transcriptions of documents). Yet few Mesoamericanist archaeologists have sufficient training or experience in Colonial historiography to produce credible analyses. Archaeologists need to work harder to collaborate with historians (and ethnohistorians) who have much to offer but may avoid interaction with archaeologists. Only one research project described in the book (the Rice's "Proyecto Maya-Colonial") has a historian as a major collaborator-Grant Jones­although he is not a coauthor on the chapter. Archaeol­ogists should either improve their historiographic skills or else collaborate actively with professional historians; otherwise it will be hard to take their interpretations of Colonial-period archaeological sites seriously. 
Much of the research described in The Postclassic to Spanish-Era Transition in Mesoamerica would ben­efit from a more explicit use of theory and comparative studies of imperialism and colonialism. Two chapters show a very effective use of social theory: Kepecs applies a world system perspective to explore the wider connections of northern Yucatecan salt producers and others, and Alexander uses household ecology theory to compare agrarian patterns in the Postclassic and Colo­nial periods. Two authors (Lycett and Rodrfguez­Alegria) devote space to postmodern posturing, which leads them to some rather unremarkable conclusions (e.g., that Spanish colonial processes and outcomes were not identical throughout the New World). There is a real need in Spanish Colonial studies for social theory that is less polemic and less speculative in tone. 
In their introductory chapter, Kepecs and Alexander suggest that archaeologists "are in an excellent position to contribute to theories of culture contact, resistance, changing ethnic identity, and the progress of colonial­ism and globalization" (p. 12). The chapters in this book, for the most part, bear out their optimism, although most of these contributions remain in the realm of the poten­tial rather than the actual. The chapters that provide the most balanced and rigorous comparisons of Postclassic and Colonial archaeological remains are those of Charl­ton et al., Gasco, Kepecs, and the Rices. These chapters most faithfully adhere to the goals and themes of the volume, and they suggest something of the potential for continuing research in this area. 
The situation in Mesoamerican archaeology has cer­tainly come a long way since my undergraduate days, when I recall being told to ignore glazed pottery because it was modem garbage of little interest to archaeologists. At that time, Tom Charlton was one of the only Mesoamericanist archaeologists taking Colonial period archaeology seriously. In The Postclassic to Spanish-Era Transition in Mesoamerica, he is joined by 12 like­minded colleagues, and this book should help assure that their numbers continue to increase in the future.
