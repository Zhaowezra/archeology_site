One aspect of the evident political complexity and Mesoamerican in.uence is an economy that transcends the typical household economy of most southwestern cultures, focusing on the apparent specialized aviculture of macaws and perhaps turkeys and the specialized production of goods such as roasted agave, shell jewelry, architecture, ground stone metates, and pottery (Bagwell 2006; 
Rakita 
and 
Cruz 
2015; 
VanPool 
and Leonard 2002). 
Nevertheless, 
arguments 
for 
specialized production have been challenged, and debate continues concerning the presence and degree of specialized production evident throughout the region (Rakita and Cruz 2015). 
Here we address the organization of ceramic production using the Standardization Hypoth­esis, which is the premise that the products of specialized producers tend to have more standardized morphologies than the products of generalized producers (Crown 1995). 
We 
use 
geometric morphometric analysis to evaluate the variation in vessel form for Medio and Viejo period pottery and conclude that most Medio period Ramos Polychrome and some Babicora Polychrome demonstrate evidence indicating specialized production, but that the remaining Viejo and Medio period pottery types re.ect generalized (household level) production. This in turn supports arguments for the primacy of Paquime, the apparent economic and religious center of the Casas Grandes world, with the Paquime elites and their interest in imported Mesoamerican goods and religion instigating the specialized production and social complexity. 

Archaeology of the Casas Grandes Region 
The Casas Grandes region encompasses north­ern Chihuahua, southern New Mexico, southern Arizona, 
and 
eastern 
Sonora 
(Figure 
1). 
Charles 
Di 
Peso 
(1974) 
outlined 
a 
general 
chronology 
for the region that focused on the Viejo and the Medio periods. According to Di Peso and others working in the area, social differentiation, religion, political organization, and the economic system changed drastically in the thirteenth cen­tury as the region developed during the Medio period (Rakita 2009; 
VanPool 
and 
VanPool 
2007; 
Whalen and Minnis 2009). 
A 
major 
component 
of this was the creation of specialized production and economic integration above the household level, especially at settlements such as Paquime. This specialization both re.ected and reinforced increased political complexity, making the Casas Grandes region an excellent case study for exam­ining the relationships between craft production and the development of political complexity. Yet, while it is generally accepted that some arti­facts/resources were produced by Medio period specialists, the shift to a specialized economy was incomplete (Rakita and Cruz 2015). 
As 
a 
result, the structure of craft production is an empirical question that must be determined for each class of artifacts. 
Paquime is one of the largest and most elaborate prehistoric settlements in the North American Southwest (Di Peso et al. 1974). 
It has ceremonial platform mounds, two large Mesoamerican-style I-shaped ball courts, a T-shaped ball court, water reservoirs that fed a canal system running through the settlement, large ovens that could produce hundreds of pounds of roasted agave, one of the deepest known hand-dug wells in North America, evidence of human sacri.ce, massively overbuilt architectural fea­tures including adobe walls over 0.5 m thick, storerooms containing over 60 pots from other regions of the Southwest, and tons of ocean shells from the Gulf of California and other parts of the west coast of Mexico. When .rst encountered by sixteenth-century Spanish explorers (at least 100 years after it had been abandoned), its beauty and grandeur was so impressive that they likened it to a Roman city (Gamboa 2002:41). 
It 
is 
now 
listed 
as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. 
Other Medio period settlements are present within the region, although none compare to the size or grandeur of Paquime. These settlements range from a few large habitation sites perhaps half the size of Paquime, to small farming com­munities built on .oodplains, terrace slopes, and in rockshelters (Bagwell 2006; 
Cruz 
Antillón 
et al. 2004; 
Whalen 
and 
Pitezel 
2015). 
One 
of the most striking aspects of Casas Grandes archaeology is its beautiful polychrome pottery characterized by black and red designs on a white background. Although this pottery is found throughout the Casas Grandes region, its distri­bution is not uniform. Some pottery types are found in greater concentrations in some locations

re.ecting 
variable 
social 
rela­
tionships within the larger region. Paquime and nearby settlements contain a higher percentage of Ramos Polychrome (the most elaborately decorated polychrome with exceptionally .ne line work, re.ecting remarkable workmanship), areas to the east comprise more Villa Ahumada Polychrome, settlements to the northwest re.ect more Carretas and Huerigos Polychromes, and so 
forth 
(Figure 
2). 
When 
considered 
with 
archi­
tecture and other evidence, this indicates that the elites living at Paquime exerted substantial in.uence on settlements within a day’s walk (about 30 km), extending further northward perhaps into the Animas region of southern New Mexico (Skibo et al. 2002; 
VanPool 
et 
al. 
2013), 
but 
without 
direct 
control. 
They 
likely 
had less in.uence over settlements more than 30 km away to the east, south, and west/northwest (Carpenter 2002; 
Whalen and Minnis 2001, 
2009). 

A higher level of political complexity is re.ected in mortuary goods and contexts, archi­tectural elaboration, the use of exotic west Mexican prestige goods such as copper and shell artifacts, and specialized craft production (production above the household level) in the Ramos-dominated zone centered on Paquime. It is less common or even absent in the zones dominated by other Medio period polychrome ceramic types. Part of the analysis of the orga­nization of craft production is the consideration of Ramos Polychrome production. Its exceed­ingly well-executed designs in particular have caused some to suggest it is the product of highly skilled ceramic specialists, a hypothesis that has been supported by Sprehn’s (2003) 
analysis of design composition, complexity, and vessel size standardization. In contrast to the Medio period Mesoamerican-inspired architec­ture and increased political/economic complex­ity, the preceding Viejo period (AD 700 to

1200) re.ects the small-scale farming typical of contemporaneous Mogollon region settlements (Kelley and Searcy 2015). 
There 
was likely limited social differentiation during the Viejo period based on modest site hierarchies and some burial good differentiation (Kelley and Searcy 2015). 




Casas Grandes Pottery 
Casas Grandes ceramic types are split between the Viejo and Medio periods, with some overlap between the two. Types are primarily differ­entiated by .nishing techniques and painted elements (Brand 1935; 
Di 
Peso 
et al. 1974; 
Sayles 1936; 
VanPool 
et 
al. 
2008:60). 
Di 
Peso 
(1974) 
de.ned 
a 
number 
of 
Viejo 
period 
types 
including Anchondo Red-on-brown, Leal Red­on-brown, Pilon Red-on-brown, Fernando Red­on-brown, and Mata Red-on-brown textured, but Kelley 
and 
Searcy 
(2015) 
note 
that 
these 
types 
are likely not valid across the entire region and may not be valid anywhere. We follow their lead in collapsing the Viejo subtypes into a single category of Viejo Red-on-brown (Kelley and Searcy 2015). 
Viejo 
period 
jars 
typically 
have long necks that are frequently corrugated or incised and bodies decorated with simple banded designs, often with repeating triangles (Di Peso et al. 1974; 
VanPool 
2003). 
Viejo 
period 
pots 
also typically lack the duality and interlocking designs that are paramount on Medio period jars (VanPool and VanPool 2002). 
VanPool 
(2003) suggests that this indicates nonspecialist potters working at the household level were less struc­tured by the social rules that appear during the Medio 
period 
(see 
Hendrickson 
[2003], 
VanPool 
[2003], 
and 
Whalen 
and 
Minnis 
[2012]for a discussion of Medio period design rules). In fact, there is no evidence that any Viejo period crafts were produced above the household level. As a result, the Viejo period ceramics provide a useful comparative assemblage for assessing the struc­ture of Medio period ceramic production.

Polychrome vessels represent the main deco­rated ceramics of the Medio period. Di Peso and colleagues 
(1974) 
de.ned 
multiple 
variants 
for 
most types, but we focus on the standard versions. Babicora Polychrome vessels are typically jars and have thick red and black lines on a light brown surface with a thin wash. Carretas Poly­chrome vessels are usually unpolished bowls with decorations similar to Babicora but with red and black subglaze paint on a brown/orange surface. Corralitos Polychrome vessels are most often jars that are textured using incising or punching with a slipped surface and are dec­orated with thick red and black lines. Dublan Polychrome vessels have red and black lines that are painted closely together on a gray-brown surface with textured shoulders and necks on jars. Ramos Polychrome pots have a light paste color, are polished, have a .ne-grained temper, and have red and black painted designs. Villa Ahumada Polychrome jars are constructed with a dark paste, have a white slip except at the bottom, and are painted with black and red designs. Santa Ana Polychrome jars are decorated using closely massed red and black lines on a light background in what has been informally described as “cat scratch designs.” 
Casas Grandes ceramic types were originally de.ned 
by 
Brand 
(1935), 
who 
was formally trained as a geographer and was attempting to de.ne types that re.ected geography as opposed to time. Brand’s types were further re.ned and expanded 
by 
Di 
Peso 
and 
others 
(1974), 
but 
these 
types still did not (and do not) vary systemat­ically through time in a manner similar to most southwestern pottery types. Rakita and Raymond (2003) 
noted 
this 
and 
applied 
an 
evolutionary 
approach to identify a model of seriation for Casas Grandes ceramics. In their sample, Villa Ahumada was prevalent before most other Casas Grandes polychromes, but the seriation did not produce a .ne-scale ceramic sequence (Rakita and Raymond 2003). 
Whalen 
and 
Minnis 
(2012) continued the effort of linking the pottery to temporal trends and de.ned “early” and “late” Medio period ceramic assemblages. They found that Babicora is one of the earliest polychrome types in the region, that Dublan and Villa Ahu­mada Polychromes were introduced before AD 1300 during the early Medio period, and that the remaining polychromes, including Ramos, were produced after AD 1300 during the late Medio period (Whalen and Minnis 2009, 
2012). 
Other research in the southern portion of the Casas Grandes region indicates that noncorru­gated polychrome vessels appeared during the Viejo period (as was the case with Santa Ana) and developed into Babicora during the Medio period (Larkin et al. 2004). 
Thus, 
given 
the 
evidence 
of increasing economic and political complexity from the Viejo into the Medio period, culminat­ing in the complex system centered at Paquime, it might be expected that the scale of ceramic production increased above the household level late in time and might be re.ected only in the late Medio period pottery. This proposition can be evaluated using the Standardization Hypothesis. 


The Standardization Hypothesis 
Archaeologists recognize that the organization of production is a central component of the economic organization of a culture and have developed various methods to measure it (Costin 1991). 
Specialized 
craft 
production 
is 
de.ned 
as “where a limited number of artisans produce goods for a much broader group of consumers” (Costin 2015:1) 
and 
forms 
a 
continuum 
extend­
ing from each individual in a group making a product for their own use, to a single individual or group making that product for everyone in a soci­ety. Even so, it is useful to distinguish between “generalized production,” in which someone within each household makes the product for the consumption of that household, and “special­ized production,” in which a limited number of individuals organized above the household level make the product for a community. 
One of the most effective means of identifying the presence of craft production above the house­hold level is the Standardization Hypothesis (Crown 1995). 
In 
this 
context, 
standardization 
is 
the reduction of artifact variation. The Standard­ization Hypothesis holds that the morphology of artifacts becomes more standardized as spe­cialization increases because (1) there are fewer producers manufacturing any given number of artifacts relative to the number of generalized producers required to make the same number of artifacts; (2) specialized producers have more

skill and are therefore capable of making better formed/more standardized artifacts relative to generalized producers; (3) specialized manufac­turers focused on streamlining their production will establish habits and standardized production sequences that ef.ciently produce the product; and (4) standardization allows consumers not directly involved in production to evaluate the suitability and quality of a product. Each of these four factors should be applicable in the context of Medio period specialization. Although ethnographic and archaeological evidence indi­cates that there can be highly skilled general­ized producers—and novice specialized produc­ers with limited skill—in general, specialized producers have greater skill than generalized producers (Crown 1995, 
2007). 
Furthermore, 
specialists do in fact streamline production effort and methods more than the typical generalized producer, and specialized producers do work to create products that can be generally recognized as useful and high quality for those who are not directly involved in their production (Miloglav 2013). 
As 
a 
result, 
items 
produced 
by 
specialists 
tend to be more uniform (standardized) than those made by nonspecialists. One measure of standardization that has often been used is the corrected coef.cient of variation (CV*), which is based on the standard deviation standardized by the mean (Crown 1995). 
It 
is 
a 
unit-free 
percent­
age that measures the variation within a sample while also correcting for the tendency of small samples to underestimate variation (VanPool and Leonard 2011:54–56). 
Here, 
s is the standard deviation, Y is the mean, and n is the sample

Crown 
(1995) 
used 
previously 
analyzed 
sam­
ples of ethnographic and historic ceramics to propose that ceramic assemblages with CV* values of roughly 10% or less on common metric traits such as rim diameter were likely produced by specialists, whereas values greater than 10% likely re.ect generalized producers working at the 
household 
level. 
Crown 
(1995) 
further 
sug­
gested that substantially declining CV* values likely re.ect increased specialization, even if they are above the 10% threshold. This was the pattern she observed in her analysis of Salado Polychrome in which large vessels, presumably made for feasting, were associated with smaller CV* values (although still larger than 10%) when compared to other vessels, prompting Crown to conclude they were made by only the most skilled potters at the community level. Maria Sprehn (2003) 
used 
this 
approach 
to 
examine 
variation 
in vessel height and circumference in Ramos Polychrome, Babicora Polychrome, and Villa Ahumada Polychrome and found comparatively small CV* values, prompting her to conclude that Ramos jars, large Babicora jars, and large Villa Ahumada jars may have been manufactured by specialists. 
Obviously the 10% demarcation between gen­eralized and specialized producers is a heuristic distinction as opposed to a hard-and-fast delin­eation. 
VanPool 
and 
Leonard 
(2011:138–142) 
considered Crown’s data and found it unlikely that generalized producers produce CV* val­ues equal to or lower than 10% (only 10% of the assemblages produced by generalists are expected to fall below the 10% threshold), but the products of specialized producers can be expected to be above the 10% cutoff 37% of the time. This means that the 10% demarcation will misclassify products made by specialists as the products of generalists roughly one out of three times. This error rate justi.es Crown’s (1995) 
willingness 
to 
“stretch 
the 
boundary” 
for 
specialized production above the 10% threshold given that specialists are indeed associated with the range of CV* values she reported, but it does indicate that the 10% cutoff is excessively conservative for specialized producers. As a result, 
VanPool 
and 
Leonard 
(2011) 
suggest 
that 
CV* below 10% should be considered indicative of specialist production (63% of the specialist assemblages and 10% of the generalist assem­blages fall within this range), CV* between 10% and 14% could re.ect specialist or generalist production (24% of the specialist assemblages and 33% of the generalist assemblages fall within this range), and CV* greater than 14% should be considered indicative of generalist producers (13% of the specialist assemblages and 53% of the generalist assemblages fall within this range). Following 
Crown’s 
(1995) 
logic, 
decreasing 
CV* values through time or across ceramic types

likely re.ect differences in the organization of production, even in cases when the CV* is above 10%, so long as it is below 14%. 
There are additional factors that can affect the degree of standardization. Costin and Hagstrum (1995) 
make 
a 
distinction 
between 
two 
types 
of standardization. Mechanical standardization is the unintentional decrease in variation due to repeated production by the manufacturer (Costin and Hagstrum 1995). 
Intentional 
standardization 
is found in aspects of an artifact that are con­sciously made more uniform by the producer, because they impact performance characteristics (which make an item useful for a task). Costin and 
Hagstrum 
(1995) 
conclude 
that 
the 
Stan­
dardization Hypothesis is most easily applied to attributes of mechanical standardization, given that intentional standardization can be produced even by generalized producers. As a starting assumption, it is reasonable to suggest that perimeter shapes of ceramics, the focus of this analysis, will re.ect mechanical standardization at least somewhat given that variation is intu­itively evident even when simply looking at the pots. We think that if there was intentional standardization, then the pots should look more similar. 


Geometric Morphometrics 
The Standardization Hypothesis focuses on vari­ation in morphology, whether it be at the scale of decorative elements (e.g., line width), aspects of speci.c components of vessel shape (e.g., rim diameter), or attributes of the entire vessel (e.g., vessel volume). One useful means of quantifying variation in morphology, increasingly popular in archaeology, is geometric morphometrics, or GM (e.g., Buchanan et al. 2014; 
Wilczek 
et 
al. 
2014): 
the 
study of shape and its variation (Zelditch et al. 2012). 
The 
.rst 
major 
application 
of GM (Kendall and Kendall 1980) 
sought 
to 
answer questions about alignments at Stone­henge and other megalithic structures; since then GM methods have been used extensively (and primarily) in biology, paleontology, and physical anthropology to examine organismal morphology (Zelditch et al. 2012). 
These 
works 
led to great improvements in GM methods and eventually to the reintroduction of GM analysis in archaeological contexts. Current GM methods can correct for size so that shapes of objects of very different sizes can be directly compared (e.g., the shapes of small and large Clovis points can be directly compared in archaeolog­ical analysis). Shape in GM contexts is con­sequently de.ned as the geometric information that remains when location, scale, and rotational effects are removed through a process called Pro­crustes superimposition (Zelditch et al. 2012). 

Morphometricians create Procrustes super­imposition by .xing homologous landmarks recorded on different objects to a single, .xed point called the centroid. This center point repre­sents the geographical average of the landmarks (e.g., the center of a pot with landmarks recorded along its edge; the centroid position is literally the average position of the coordinates with the x position being the average of all of the x components of the landmarks and the yposition being the average of all of the y components; Zelditch et al. 2012:457). 
The 
differences 
in 
the 
landmarks for the objects are then minimized by rescaling the objects relative to each other. This is analogous to someone taking pictures of multiple objects, say pottery as in our case, and “blowing them up” or “shrinking them down” using a copy machine until the pots are as close to the same size as possible. In the case of Procrustes superimposition, though, there is a statistical algorithm that directly minimizes the variation among all of the measured objects based on the distribution of their measured landmarks around the centroid (Webster and Sheets 2010; 
Zelditch 
et al. 2012). 
For 
example, 
if 
two 
pots 
shared 
the 
exact same proportions but one was half the size of the other, Procrustes superimposition would scale both sets of landmarks so that they were overlying one another. By doing so, this process removes size differences and allows differences in shape to be isolated. 
Shape is measured using three types of land­marks: primary, secondary, and tertiary (also called sliding). Primary landmarks are homol­ogous, unambiguous loci that designate corre­sponding points that match within and between populations (e.g., the tip of a projectile point; Zelditch et al. 2012:461). 
A secondary or semi-landmark is a point on a curve, edge, or surface that is de.ned in terms of its position on
