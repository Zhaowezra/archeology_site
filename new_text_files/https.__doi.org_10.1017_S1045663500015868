Thebook represents a spirited defense of the possibility ofreconstructing regional settlement demography and acompelling argument for the central importance ofdemographytofundamentalarchaeologicalquestions.Itisatestament tothepowerof archaeological surveyanda demonstration of what well-designed research canaccomplish with the surface archaeological record.
The brief initial chapter, Regional SettlementDemography:WhyBother?, presentsashorthistoryofregional demography, centered on the seminal work ofWilliam Sanders, Jeffrey Parsons, and their colleaguesintheBasinofMexico.Then,asthechaptertitlesuggests,it argues convincingly for the centrality explicitly or implicitly ofregionaldemographytoabroadrangeofarchaeological questions and the need to tackle demo-graphic reconstruction, despite the difficulties and theinevitable imprecision of the results. Drennan et al.rightly note that, while there is no single right way todo demographic reconstructions, there nonetheless arebad or even wrong ways to go about it.

Startinginthischapter,thebook sclearverbalargu-ments are enhanced through the use of well-chosen andwell-illustrated examples drawn from both archaeolog-ical cases and modern data. Several of these examplesare followed, to good effect, through the methods dis-cussedinsubsequentchapters.Examplesaredrawnfromdiverse New and OldWorld archaeological contexts, inmany cases from the authors work. Drennan, Berrey,and Peterson do not shy away from dealing with uncer-tainty and the less than ideal circumstances thatarchae-ologiststypicallyface.Whilenotingthattheirdiscussionand comparisons are often presented as contingent on

RegionalSettlementDemography inArchaeology is written in an admirably clear and highly readable, con-versationalstyle.Itistrulyenjoyabletoread.Thewritingis at the same time optimistic about the possibilities fordemographic reconstruction and appropriately cautiousabout over-interpreting results. The book doesn t justtell the reader how to accomplish a specific task; it pro-videsacontextthatnurturesone sabilitytothinkthroughandplanananalyticaltrajectoryinamannersensitivetoa broad range of local circumstances.
Everybookmakestradeoffs,includingbetweendetailand readability. While in a number of places I was leftwishingformore,intheendIcan targuewiththechoicesmade here because the book works very well as acompactwhole.There is no indexand there are no cita-tionsinthetext.Anannotatedlistofadditionalreferences is provided at the end of all but the final chapters, andtheexamplesarefullyreferenced.Mostchaptershaveanovel Q&Asection that effectively reinforces their keypoints. In the book s thoughtful layout, figures usuallyface the page in which they are discussed.
I can find very little to criticize in this volume. Iwouldhavelikedmorediscussionoftotalaccumulation studies.Insomecases,thesubstantivechallengestoexe-cuting the proposed methods seem to me understated,but perhaps that implicit optimism is for the best. Thisapplies to the discussion of the magic number that isusedtoconvertperiod-specificsurfaceartifactdensitiestonumbersofpeople.Similarly,Iamnotassanguineasthe authors concerning the use of augering, althoughthey do acknowledge that an auger hole placed withinan occupation area may return no artifacts.
