GENDERED LOGISTIC MOBILITY AMONG THE EARLIEST 
FARMERS IN THE SONORAN DESERT 

James T. Watson and Marijke Stoll 
Archaeological evidence suggests that early farmers in the Sonoran Desert practiced a mixed subsistence strategy that 
likely involved logistical foraging by a segment of the population to supplement agricultural investments on the floodplains. 
Patterned differences in labor investments in archaeological populations can often be extrapolated by comparing cross­
sectional geometry in long bones, which can vary as a result of repetitive behaviors. We compare cross-sectional geometry 
(dimensions) of the femur between site location, archaeological phase, and by sex (males vs .females) in a series of skele­
tal samples from the Early Agricultural period (2100 B.C.-A.D. 50) to test the hypothesis that males exhibit greater ante­
rior-posterior dimensions of the femur midshaft compared to females. We found that the cross-sectional geometry of the 
femur is significantly different 

between the sexes, indicating that males participated in foraging forays more frequently than females, and we suggest that these early farmers employed a gendered logistic mobility strategy. These differences reflect a continued investment in foraged resources (subsistence and materials) during the Early Agricultural period in the Sono­ran Desert and have important implications for the division of labor and the construction of gender roles among these com­munities.

sonal and distant resources (Gregory 2001; Huck­ell 1995; Mabry 1998a, 1998b)-a form of logis­tic mobility (Binford 1980). Continued investment at bajada and upland sites during this period, as well as the presence of early com , has led other scholars to suggest that these groups were more invested in foraging than full-time farming and practiced some form of residential mobility (Bin­ford 1980) . This would have involved moving the entire group through a seasonal cycle from farm­ing and collecting on the floodplain to collecting in the uplands during different parts of the year (Dean 2005; Mabry 2008; Roth 1996; Wills 1995; Wills and Huckell 1994) . 
In archaeological populations, mobility related to patterned differences in subsistence activities, specifically residential vs. logistical (or logistic) mobility, can often be extrapolated by comparing geometric properties in long bones, particularly cross-sectional dimensions of the diaphysis (Auer­bach and Ruff2006; Bridges et al. 2000; Ruff2005; Ruff and Hayes 1983a, I983b; Ruff et al. I984; Wescott and Cunningham 2005) . The cross-sec­tional geometry oflong bones is continuously mod­ified over the life of individuals in response to bending forces exerted by repetitive activity. In this case, subsistence behaviors and labor investment can be inferred by differences in individual and group mobility, as reflected in bone morphology, whereby increasing levels of mobility (greater fre­quency of foraging forays) cause increases in ante­rior-posterior dimensions in the femur. 
There is still much to understand about the arrival of cultigens and investment in agriculture in the southwest U.S. and northwest Mexico, which began more than 4,000 years ago. Cross-sectional geometry, in conjunction with archaeological,geo­graphical, and environmental data from the Sono­ran Desert, has the potential to contribute to a better understanding of the Formative transition in the region. Given current evidence that the first farm­ers in the area practiced a mixed-subsistence econ­omy, our primary goal is to identify what fom1 of individual or group mobility contributed to this

adaptation. We suggest that one way in which these early farming communities maximized the exploitation of the floodplains, as well as foraged seasonal and distant resources, was by diversify­ing labor roles based on gender through logistical mobility. The regular exploitation of both local and distant resources could have shaped different forms of terrestrial mobility. 
We identify three scales of resource manage­ment to factor into a logistical mobility strategy based on resource distribution and topography in the Sonoran Desert: immediate, local, and distant. The management of immediate resources would have included activities such as tending of crops, fields, and irrigation systems, processing foods, and foraging floodplain resources. The manage­ment oflocal resources would have included short­distance travel over rugged terrain to forage wild resources. The management of distant resources would have included long-distance travel over often rugged terrain to forage seasonal resources and raw material resources and to trade. Using oste­ological samples recovered from Early Agricul­tural period sites we can test for differences in mobility within and between sites based on cross­sectional geometry of the femur midshaft. Previ­ous research has proposed that these communities practiced a form of gendered logistical mobility (Ogilvie 2005) in order to manage immediate vs. local and distant resources. We therefore hypothe­size that, if males participated in more frequent logistical foraging forays, they would exhibit greater anterior-posterior dimensions in cross-sec­tional geometry of the femur midshaft compared to females. 
In the following sections, we discuss the archae­ological evidence of subsistence economy and mobility-related strategies during the Early Agri­cultural period in the Sonoran Desert. We also con­sider the literature on mobility-related subsistence strategies and the biomechanical approach (based on cross-sectional geometric properties) to evalu­ate the osteological evidence and postulate how it may relate to the frequency of mobility among early farmers of the Sonoran Desert. 
Early Farmers in the Sonoran Desert 
The Sonoran Desert comprises 3 20 ,000 km2 of Ari­zona, California, and Sonora and Baja California (Norte and Sur) , Mexico. An average of 38 cm of annual rainfall in two rainy seasons creates a rich biotic diversity compared to many other desert environments (Dimmitt 2000) . This biotic diver­sity provided the basis for successful human occu­pation in the Sonoran Desert for the past 10,000 years. Sonoran Desert soils also proved to be rich enough for extensive agriculture. 
The first evidence for the arrival of cultigens in the southwest U.S. and northwest Mexico dates as early as 2100 B.C. (Mabry 2008), marking the beginning of the Early Agricultural period (2100 B.C.-A.D. 50). However, changes in subsistence patterns associated with the adoption of, and early investment in, agriculture are not identified archae­ologically in the Sonoran Desert until approxi­mately 1500 B.C. (Huckell 1995; Mabry 2008). The Tucson and Tonto basins contain the majority of intensively investigated Early Agricultural period (EAP) sites (Figure 1) (e.g., Ezzo and Deaver 1998; Huckell 2004; Mabry 1999, 2008). Other important sites have been documented along Cienega Creek in southern Arizona (Huckell 1995), along the Boquillas River in northern Sonora (Car­penter et al. 2005), and, more recently, in the north­ern Phoenix Basin (e.g., Hackbarth 1998). 
The artifactual evidence and timing of these events indicate that local foraging groups had been exposed to, and were likely experimenting with, maize cultivation for at least several hundred years prior to establishing permanent settlements (Diehl 2005 ; Huckell 1995) . Archaeological evidence associated with the EAP suggests that once settled, these groups practiced a mixed subsistence econ­omy based equally in foraging wild resources and in farming Mesoamerican domesticated cultigens (Roth and Wellman 2001; Watson 2008; Wills 
1995). The EAP is divided into three phases based on material culture that represent a general trend in increasing village settlement size, artifact den­sity, and complexity: Unnamed phase (2100-1200 B.C.); San Pedro phase (1200-800 B.C.); and early and late components of the Cienega phase (800--400 B.C. and 400 B.C.-A.D. 50) (Mabry 2008; Whittlesey et al. 2010). 
The Unnamed phase represents a protracted period of adaptation to the arrival of cultigens­particularly maize-before significant investment in permanent settlements is evident in the archae­ological record (Mabry 2008) . Small, imperma-

nent, earthen habitation structures and storage pits dating to this phase have been identified at a few sites along the Santa Cruz River in the Tucson Basin (Diehl 2005; Gregory 2001). Botanical remains recovered from several of these early EAP sites indicate that maize had quickly become one among seven important types of plants consumed; the others included saguaro cactus fruit, wild grass seeds, mesquite pods, false purslane, goosefoot, and amaranth (Diehl 2009) . 
San Pedro phase sites are generally character­ized by the presence of shallow domestic depres­sions ("pit" structures), storage pits, ubiquitous ground stone, an expedient lithic technology, San Pedro dart points, and the presence of maize (Huck­ell 1995; Roth and Wellman 200 1). In addition, some clay figurines and early ceramic sherds have been recovered from San Pedro contexts (Carpen­ter et al. 2005; Gregory 2001; Huckell 1995; Mabry 1999; Roth and Wellman 200 1). Evidence for the earliest irrigation canals in the North American Desert West has also been documented at several sites in the Tucson Basin by about 1500 B .C. (Ezzo and Deaver 1998; Mabry 1999). Although the true extent of irrigation canal utilization during this time period is not well understood, the development and investment in irrigation technology demonstrate that San Pedro groups were working to intensify agricultural productivity. 
It is also likely that irrigation promoted the development of concepts of private property and facilitated a significant change in community orga­nization during this time. Mabry (2008, 2009) argues that households first emerge during the San Pedro phase as the basic social and economic unit redefining community structure. Prior to ca. 1000 B.C., houses were relatively large and food was stored in outdoor pits suggestive of public storage and food sharing, whereas after 1000 B.C., houses were smaller and food was stored inside, which is suggestive of private storage and consumption within a nuclear family household (Mabry 2009) . 
The subsequent Cienega phase is characterized by larger villages, increased technological com­plexity, the establishment of both local and long dis­tance commerce networks, and the Cienega point type (Mabry 1997). The Cienega point represents experimentation with projectile point technology and the introduction of the bow and arrow (Ochoa 2004; Sliva 2000) . There is also an elaboration of ground stone manufacture techniques, the estab­lishment of a marine shell ornament production industry in both southern Arizona and northern Sonora, and an Incipient Plainware ceramic tradi­tion (Heidke 1999). Although houses still tended to be relatively small and circular or oval in shape with internal storage pits, larger "communal" struc­tures have been found at several Cienega phase sites. Mabry (2008, 2009) proposes that commu­nity organization continues to evolve during this time with a transition from nuclear family to extended family households in order to consolidate agricultural labor. He points to the tentative iden­tification of rings of houses around central court­yards and the presence of burial groups at several sites (Mabry 2009) . The addition of communal structures further suggests that EAP groups were employing social integrative mechanisms within the community (Mabry 2009). 

Huckell (1995) asserts that by 1000 B .C., maize becomes an equally critical part of the EAP mixed subsistence system, but that subsistence becomes primarily based in maize agriculture during the Cienega phase, with surplus stored for use during the rest of the year. Other researchers (Doelle and Fish 1988; Mabry 1999) cite the characteristics related to sedentism-including the ubiquity of maize, the presence of large middens, cemeteries, and irrigation canals-to suggest that this phase represents full reliance on agriculture. Diehl and Waters (200 1), on the other hand, suggest that sub­sistence strategies remained a stable, mixed econ­omy throughout the EAP, because pit storage technology was inadequate and made maize culti­vation extremely risky. Schurr and Gregory (2002) additionally identify a dramatic rise in all plant resources in storage features, including maize remains, seeds, grasses, cacti, and mesquite, over a 200-year stretch of the Cienega phase, indicating an overall intensification of food production and collection. 
Macrobotanical and fauna! remains recovered from EAP sites demonstrate an array of both wild and domesticated resources from valley lows to mountain highs. Table 1 represents a compilation of subsistence resources from numerous EAP sites (Dean 2005; Diehl 2005; Mabry 2005; Martinez 20 10; Martinez et al . 20 11 ). Not all of these resources have been recovered from all EAP sites, but they represent the diversity of resources that

were exploited as part of a larger subsistence strat­egy across much of the Sonoran Desert. 
There is a significant amount of similarity in material culture among EAP sites, which Mabry (2008) has suggested was maintained through potentially expansive marriage networks through­out the period. In addition, the presence at these sites of distant material resources, such as marine shells and obsidian, indicates some form of long­distance procurement strategy. The evidence clearly indicates that the EAP represents a pro­tracted period of change , resulting in the adoption of agriculture and the establishment of permanent irrigation villages on the floodplains of the Sono­ran Desert. It is equally evident that these groups practiced some form of foraging mobility strategy, which resulted in the procurement of sometimes distant resources and contributed to subsistence and material economies.

archaeological past: residential and logistical mobility. He stressed that these strategies are not discrete, diametrically opposed categories. Rather, they are idealized endpoints of a continuum, with societies and individuals changing their strategies in response to the temporal and spatial availability ofresources (Shoocongdej 2000: 15-16). 
Archaeologists' attempts to infer patterns of human mobility in the past are based on numerous lines of evidence, including flaked stone source material and artifacts, fauna! remains, the distrib­ution of"exotic" materials, settlement characteris­tics, and the distribution of sites across landscapes. Several studies focusing on flaked stone artifacts have successfully mapped prehistoric human mobility in the American Southwest using the dis­tribution of source materials and worked flaked stone (Brantingham 2006; Roth 1998; Shott 1986), the degree of reduction in flaked stone tools (Blades 2003) , and the composition of flaked stone weapon assemblages (Amick 1996).

portions of non-prey animals (i.e., rodents, birds, etc.) that rely on human-modified habitats. Kent ( 1992) characterizes the physical properties of set­tlements, such as site size and the presence/absence and number of formal storage facilities, to model anticipated and actual mobility patterns. Important to our argument here, she notes that societies will still occupy special seasonal activity sites, even after becoming fully sedentary (Kent 1992:637) , reinforcing the continuum concept of ancient human mobility strategies. 
A review of ethnographic data on hunter-gath­erers (Kelly 1983) demonstrates that the extent to which a group or individual employs residential or logistical mobility strategies is closely linked to the seasonality and distribution of resources in the envi­ronments they encounter. This would also be true among sedentary groups that practice logistical mobility. Kelly (1992:43) notes that how people move across landscapes is closely linked to social organization and to the economic exploitation of the environment and is "universal, variable, and multi­dimensional." Movements by groups and individ­uals are not only propelled by resource needs and availability, but also can be politically and socially motivated. Even when the ultimate underlying cause is food-related, many ethnographic studies note that people still offer political and social motives as the cause of their movements (Kelly 1992:48) . Although Kelly's (1983) study focuses on hunter­gatherers, his argument regarding resource struc­tures is applicable to both horticultural and agricultural societies, as their ability to produce food is still dependent on what can be found and what can be grown in the local environment. 
Stokes and Roth ( 1999:423) argue thatthe adop­tion of agriculture does not always entail absolute sedentism, but instead observe variation in how groups respond to the use of cultivated foods. Mobility strategies are not mutually exclusive; they depend on resource availability and seasonality, and groups may use different strategies through­out the year, or even at the same time to facilitate the exploitation of important resources (Kelly 1983:296) . Ethnographic data from the American Southwest demonstrate that agricultural groups in the region regularly integrated logistic mobility and a gendered division of labor (Stokes and Roth 1999:423) . Similar gender-based mobility strate­gies occur elsewhere, and in most cases men were regularly responsible for long-distance forays (MacDonald and Hewett 1999:510). 
Archaeological data indicate that EAP groups in the Sonoran Desert employed a mixed-subsistence economy. Yet continuity in village location and structure and irrigation systems at numerous flood­plain sites -which only increase in size and com­plexity through time -imply that settlement was essentially permanent. Given the continued exploitation of wild foods and investment in distant material resources, it is likely that these early farm­ers practiced a form oflogistical mobility. Here, we ask whether this mobility strategy was organized along gender lines-or, more precisely, sex. Oste­ological data (cross-sectional geometry) can provide some insight into the biomechanical consequences of mobility practices among past groups. 
Long Bone Geometry 
Several studies have used human skeletal remains to infer mobility patterns in the archaeological record, including those related to subsistence strategies. Here we employ a biomechanical approach based on long bone cross-sectional geometry. The key principle in cross-sectional geometry is that the shape and robusticity of long bone diaphyses are primarily influenced by their "mechanical loading history" (Maggiano et al . 2008; Ruff 2005; Stock and Shaw 2007). This is largely the result of bending forces exerted on long bones by the attached musculature, which induces adaptive remodeling of the bone at the cellular level (Brock and Ruff 1988: 113). With the exer­tion of consistent stresses over time, skeletal struc­tures adapt through the addition, resorption, and replacement of bone, measurably altering their geometric properties (Bridges et al . 2000; Frost 1997; Maggiano et al. 2008; Ruff 2005). 
Cross-sectional shape is therefore directly affected by adaptation to physical activity and has been demonstrated in numerous studies to vary across subsistence strategies (Ashizawa et al. 1999; Auerbach and Ruff 2006; Bass et al. 2002; Biewener and Bertram 1994; Haapasalo et al. 1998; Kerr et al. 1996; Woo et al. 1981). For example, high terrestrial logistic mobility, often associated with foraging, contributes to greater unidirectional bending stresses and results in larger anterior-pos­terior femur midshaft dimensions and increased robusticity. This is a result of the contraction of the

hamstring and quadriceps muscles attached to the linea aspera located along the posterior of the femur, which are commonly used during running and climbing activities (Wescott 2006:201 ). In con­trast, walking does not seem to produce as dra­matic of an effect on femoral shape (Wescott 2006); thus long-distance travel involving walking on rel­atively flat terrain will not produce as pronounced an elliptical shape as travel through rugged terrain such as mountains or canyons. Limited, or less vig­orous, mobility associated with large, permanent settlements and intensive agriculture contributes to more evenly distributed bending stresses and results in more circular and gracile femur midshaft dimensions. 
In addition to large-scale disparities between subsistence strategies, variation in cross-sectional geometry can also be used to identify more subtle changes in labor investment and the intensity of agricultural production (i.e., horticulture vs. agri­culture), as well as differences in tasks associated with cultivation and food processing. Bridges and colleagues (2000) examined upper and lower limb long bone dimensions from Eastern Woodland and Mississippian period populations in Illinois to iden­tify a variety of subsistence economies over time, ranging from low-level horticulture focused on native crops to intensive maize agriculture. Their analysis demonstrated a complex pattern of changes that appear distinct from other Eastern Woodlands areas (Bridges et al . 2000:227) . They argue that processing native cultigens played a sig­nificant role in female diaphyseal strength and dimensions, but that with the adoption of maize there was intensification in the production and pro­cessing of cultigens that resulted in greater humeral anterior-posterior dimensions among women. They propose that this biomechanical pattern is partially linked to shifts in early weaning and the assump­tion of subsistence-related economic tasks by females at a young age (Bridges et al . 2000:230) . These geometric changes in midshaft dimensions were ultimately related to increased frequency of food processing activities. 
Cross-sectional geometric properties have also been used to investigate changes in socioeconomic behaviors and labor demands beyond food pro­duction. Maggiano et al. (2008) observed a reduc­tion in the overall robusticity of upper and lower limb bone dimensions at the Classic period Mayan salt-producing site of Xcamb6 (A.D. 250-700). They propose that this reduction was related to a decrease in labor investment and physically demanding activities as a result of economic growth and increased social status. 
A common theme with many of these studies is the identification of gendered subsistence adapta­tions. Wescott (2006) rightly cautions, however, that researchers should take care not to assume a straightforward link between long bone geometry and physical activity across populations. Using a large skeletal sample drawn from temporally and geographically distinct populations with varying subsistence strategies and degrees of mobility, Wescott (2006) found that sexual dimorphism in femoral midshaft shape and robusticity was gen­erally greater in more mobile populations, as the biomechanical approach would predict. However, the correspondence between sex-specific variation and femoral shape and robusticity was rather weak, meaning that the effects of mechanical loading, specifically mobility, are not universal. He con­cludes that factors other than mobility, such as envi­ronmental , biological , and genetic variations experienced by different populations, may also play an important role in the geometry of the long bones (Wescott 2006:207). In this study, we attempt to control for these factors by using a biologically similar population (Byrd 2012; Mabry 2008), restricted to a single time period and geographic location. 
Of particular importance to our study is work by Ogilvie (2005) , who documented significant differences in femur cross-sectional dimensions between dedicated foragers from the Lower Pecos region of Texas, early agriculturalists from Matty Canyon in southern Arizona, and dedicated late agriculturalists from Pottery Mound, New Mexico. It is important to note that the Matty Canyon sam­ples Ogilvie used are the same individuals from the Cienega Creek sites included in this study. She uti­lized CT scans of adult femora to calculate femoral midshaft shape indices and documented that FMS (I/I: where Ix second moment of area in the 
y= 
medial-lateral plane, and IY = second moment of area in the anterior-posterior plane) decreased across this subsistence continuum as mobility decreased, but clear sex-based differences were observed among the early farming sample. The dedicated foragers in Ogilvie's sample displayed

greater anterior-posterior dimensions, with males and females exhibiting little difference. She argues that this pattern reflects investment in residential mobility and a collecting strategy. However, males in the EAP sample exhibited significantly larger anterior-posterior femur dimensions than females, which she argued reflects investment in a gendered logistic mobility strategy. The late agriculturalist sample displayed more circular midshaft dimen­sions, with males and females exhibiting little dif­ference. She argues that this results from limited mobility in the case of both sexes, resulting from intensive investment in agricultural production. 
Ogilvie's results have significant implications, in particular, for mixed foraging-farming subsis­tence strategies employed by EAP groups in the Sonoran Desert. Our study differs in that we con­sider a similar approach but refine it to consider a larger archaeological sample of biologically, nutri­tionally, and culturally homogenous communities within a single area (the Sonoran Desert) and archaeological period (Early Agricultural period) to test Ogilvie's (2005) assertions that these early farming groups practiced a gendered logistic mobil­ity strategy.

Adult femora (N = 117) were analyzed from nine EAP sites from southern Arizona and northern Sonora (Table 2) . Measurements were taken from skeletal samples held in repository at the Centro Instituto Nacional de Antropologfa e Historia (INAH) in Hermosillo, Sonora, Mexico and the Arizona State Museum at the University of Ari­zona, in Tucson, Arizona, or collected from data in original documentation forms on previously repa­triated remains. Left femora were the focus of analysis to avoid confounding issues of asymme­try. The study sample comprises relatively even numbers of males and females across each archae­ological phase.

Five measurements were taken from each femur (Table 3), including maximum length (FML), bicondylar length (FBL), maximum vertical femoral head diameter (FHD), maximum anterior­posterior diameter at midshaft (APM), and maxi­mum medial-lateral diameter at midshaft (MLM) . Measurements were repeated on ten individuals three months after the original measurements were taken to test intra-observer error. The mean differ­ence between measurements was .05 percent for FML, .27 percent for FBL, 1 .54 percent for FHD, .16 percent for APM, and .16 percent for MLM. In each case variances were far less than five percent, confirming that errors of the method were small and unlikely to bias the results. 
We further calculated living stature and three biomechanical indices (body size, femur midshaft shape, and femur midshaft robusticity) from these measurements to facilitate comparisons between samples by location (site area), archaeological phase, and between sexes (male vs. female). Liv­ing stature was estimated from the portion of the sample for which we had FBL, using equations recently developed for native Southwest popula­tions (Auerbach and Ruff 2010). Differences in height are expected between males and females within any given population and should reflect nat­ural patterns in sexual dimorphism inherent in our species; however, nutrition, developmental distur­bances, disease, and microevolutionary processes such as gene flow or genetic drift can modify these patterns significantly. It is therefore important to determine whether significant differences in stature exist between locations within the EAP samples or

between archaeological phases that could confound our attempts to decipher activity and mobility using cross-sectional geometry. Body size was calculated using the ratio ofFHDIFML (multiplied by 10), to similarly determine whether mass differed signif­icantly over time or between sexes. We did not expect significant differences in statures and body size between locations or archaeological phases if the EAP samples examined here represent biolog­ically, nutritionally, and culturally homogenous communities, as suggested by Mabry (2008) and Byrd (2012). 
Femur midshaft shape (FMS) is a measure of bending forces on the femur equivalent to the l)I
ycalculation used by many researchers of cross-sec­tional geometric properties to quantify sexual dimorphism in skeletal samples by subsistence pat­terns. Most researchers have found an anterior-pos­terior expansion of the shaft associated with greater mobility and foraging subsistence activities. Femur midshaft robusticity (FMR), an estimation of tor­sional strength equivalent to J (calculated torsional strength), is used in biomechanical studies to mea­sure bone strength divided by body mass.Although this is not a direct proxy for muscle development, it does provide a general scale to compare robus­ticity between in di vi duals. Again, we did not expect significant differences in FMS and FMR between locations or archaeological phases among homoge­nous EAP samples. However, if our hypothesis is correct and males participated in more frequent ter­restrial logistic mobility, we would expect to see significant differences in these biomechanical vari­ables between sexes, with males expressing con­sistently higher values -particularly reflected in expanded anterior-posterior values. 
Standard descriptive statistics for the measure­ments, structural properties, and indices were cal­culated. Variable means were compared between locations using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and between archaeological phases and sexes using independent samples t-tests. A probability level of .05 or less was considered statistically significant, while a probability level between .05 and .1 was regarded as nearly significant. All statistical tests were performed using PASW Statistics 18.0 (IBM 2011). 
Results 
None of the variables were significantly different between locations (sites) or archaeological phases (Tables 4a and 4b) , but stature and FMS differed significantly between males and females in the pooled samples (Table 3) . Males were significantly taller than their female counterparts (t = 5.804, df 
= 
46, p < .00 1) (Figure 2) . Males also displayed significantly larger FMS values (t = 5 .606 , df = 94, p < .001) (Figure 3), particularly in midshaft ante­rior-posterior dimensions. However, body size (t 
= =
1.27 1 ,df = 41,p .211) (Figure 4) and FMR did not differ significantly between sexes in the pooled samples (t .428, df = 76, p = .670) (Figure 5) . 
= 
We also compared the variables between sexes within each location and archaeological phase to identify whether either variant had some influence on the means in the pooled sex sample compar­isons. In all cases (within each location and in either phase) the difference in mean stature and FMS were statistically significant (results not shown here) , which reinforces our decision to pool the samples.

The results of our study demonstrate that sex­ual dimorphism and long bone geometry are sim­ilar across the Sonoran Desert and over the course of the EAP. These results also identify a significant degree of sexual dimorphism in EAP populations in the Sonoran Desert in which males display more elliptical femur midshaft dimensions (PMS scores) as a result of greater anterior-posterior bending forces, indicating specifically that males partici­pated more frequently in foraging activities than females. More circular femur midshaft dimensions (PMS scores) in females, on the other hand, sug­gest less-frequent participation in foraging activi­ties. Neither statistic suggests a decrease in the medial-lateral dimension, as these measurements are relatively stable throughout the EAP and fall within a normal range of variation (of a few mil­limeters) within a biological population. As previ­ously considered, these patterns are commonly associated with habitual terrestrial logistical mobil­ity among past human groups. 
The FMR index failed to show statistically sig­nificant differences between sexes in the samples tested. This is not altogether surprising, given Wescott's (2006) recognition that PMR scores did not correspond significantly with mobility in his examination across a global continuum of mobil­ity strategies. In particular, his results demonstrate that the percent sex difference for PMS was sig­nificant (p:::; .05) in the pooled "incipient horticul­turalists" and "village horticulturalists-hunters" 
7.0 50 121.5 7.7 
sample. In these cases, males demonstrated higher PMS scores, but not FMR scores (Wescott 2006) . Interestingly, Wescott (2006) also found that per­cent sex difference for FMR rose with increasing sedentism through samples of "maize-dependent horticulturalists" and "early modern industrialist," with females exhibiting significantly larger PMR scores. He concluded that "mobility differences between populations should be reflected more in femur midshaft shape (PMS) than robusticity (PMR), since long-distance travel and running cause anterior-posterior directional loads on the femur" (Wescott 2006:209) . 
Discussion 
Our results demonstrate a significant degree of sex­ual dimorphism in femur midshaft dimensions in EAP samples, indicating that males participated in more frequent foraging activities than females. The biomechanical model proposes that a continuum of mobility behaviors (from highly mobile to com­pletely sedentary) produce predictable patterns in cross-sectional geometry and robusticity in pre­historic populations (Ruff2005). In addition, many researchers propose a concomitant decrease in sex­ual dimorphism with increasing sedentism among groups along the mobility continuum (Ruff 2005; Ruff and Larsen 2001; Ruff et al. 1984), although Wescott (2006) warns that these patterns may not be universal and that types of mobility and subsis-

tence activities, terrain type, genetic, climatic, and age differences should be additionally considered. 
Terrain likely plays a significant role in the degree of sexual dimorphism and femoral cross­sectional geometry observed in EAP samples. Doleman (2005) points out that, although climate (specifically rainfall) plays an important role in resources availability, terrain was the greatest deter­minant for distance and intensity of travel among Archaic period foragers in the neighboring Chi­huahuan Desert of southern New Mexico and southeastern Arizona. To attain the same resources, foragers had to travel greater distances in the low, flat Chihuahuan Desert than their Sonoran Desert counterparts. In addition to a richer biome (the result of climate), the narrow valleys and high mountains of the Sonoran Desert facilitate a greater variety of resources available within a shorter dis-

tance (Doleman 2005) . The rugged terrain of the Sonoran Desert would have contributed signifi­cantly to greater anterior-posterior bending forces among EAP groups practicing more frequent for ­aging activities. Even the management of "local" resources could have required significant elevation gains and climbing over rugged terrain. Therefore, frequent forays to forage local resources during an individual's lifetime could easily produce the ellip­tical femoral shape observed among males in the EAP samples examined here. 
Given the evidence for foraging distant mater­ial resources among EAP groups, such as marine shells and obsidian, we must consider the effect that the combination of distance and elevation would have had on femoral dimensions and robusticity. Travel between locations in the Sonoran Desert can be facilitated through valleys, but the shortest dis-

tance is often over rugged terrain, and prehistoric trails attest to more efficient-direct line-travel in the region (Darling and Eiselt 2009; White 2008) . We might additionally consider that a substantial amount of this long-distance travel could have involved running. Running for long-distance travel, as well as sport, is documented historically through­out the region (e.g., among the Hopi of northern Ari­zona [Nabokov 1987] and Raramuris of western Chihuahua [Bennett and Zingg 1935; McDougall 2009]), as well as ethnographically among O'od­ham groups in the Sonoran Desert (Russell 1980; Webb 1959). In any case, the critical variable is the frequency of the behavior. A Jong-distance foray, whether it involves traveling over rough terrain or running , is not in and of itself sufficient to produce the chronic anterior-posterior bending forces needed to develop an elliptical femoral midshaft. An annual trip to the coast (several hundred kilometers away) , for example, for the collection or trade of shell or salt would not produce the same morphological sig­nature in femur shape. 
These concepts are significant for our findings in that the terrain of the Sonoran Desert, particu­larly steep elevation gains, likely contributed sig­nificantly to greater anterior-posterior bending forces as part of habitual foraging forays. There­fore, unlike conclusions from other biomechanical studies of mobility among foraging groups, trav­eling long distances is not obligatory for signifi­cant anterior-posterior bending forces in the Sonoran Desert, since climbing entails using the same muscles as those used for running (Wescott 2006:201). Even daily or weekly treks into the hills adjacent to any given floodplain site would produce significant anterior-posterior bending forces. These processes would only be further enhanced if regu­lar distance forays employed running . These are factors that Ogilvie (2005) failed to consider in her study of biomechanics and mobility in the prehis­toric Southwest. In her study, each skeletal sample came from dramatically different geographical environments. Foragers from the Lower Pecos region along the lower Rio Grande had adapted to a topographically extreme area, whereas agricul­turalists from Pottery Mound (NM) were exploit­ing the broad flat plains along the middle Rio Grande. The terrain exploited by forager-farmers from Matty Canyon (AZ) -under consideration here-is intermediate to these two extremes. There­fore, not only did the three samples she tested form a subsistence continuum, but they also formed a topographic continuum. 
The differences in FMS values between males and females observed in our study support our hypothesis that EAP forager-farmers from the Sonoran Desert practiced some form of gendered logistic mobility strategy. While both men and women would have contributed to the domestic and agricultural investments in the villages located on the floodplain, such as building the canals and planting the crops, men likely made regular forag­ing excursions to exploit subsistence and material resources across rugged terrain. Conversely, women were likely focused on tending and pro­cessing crops in and around the village and forag­ing resources located on or adjacent to the floodplain. This does not preclude walking a con­siderable distance during a foraging round, nor does it preclude the movement of part, or all of the village (to saguaro camps for example) for a cou­ple of weeks a year to exploit seasonal resources (Castetter and Underhill 1935) . However, the fre­quency of these foraging events is significant. EAP males demonstrate greater femoral anterior-poste­rior dimensions, which likely resulted from more frequent, or consistent, foraging forays compared to women. Our results support Ogilvie's (2005) suppositions about gendered mobility among the Matty Canyon sample and extend it across much of the Sonoran Desert during this period. 
But what does the practice of a gendered logis­tic mobility mean in the larger scheme of the adop­tion of agriculture and adaptation to the Sonoran Desert in prehistory? The EAP produced the first agricultural investments and permanent settlements in the region, the foundation of which was based on agricultural investments on floodplains adja­cent to permanent water sources and women's labor. Roth (2006) argues that women facilitated the majority of the agricultural labor, maintenance, and processing and were therefore the decision­making force among native groups of the Sonoran Desert from the origins of agriculture to the imme­diate ethnographic past.

skills, and how they have been traditionally over­looked or undervalued by archaeologists (Bram­back and Jarvenpa 1997:417; Meyers 2003: 187, 194; Roberts 1996:216). Women are often por­trayed as being limited by their responsibilities for childbearing (Hays-Gilpin 2000; Hill 1998; Jones 1996), which Hill (1998: 105) claims is not actual theory but rather biased interpretation. She argues that we need to reconceptualize men's and women's roles, particularly regarding subsistence strategies, and move away from Western models of man the hunter and woman the gatherer (Bramback and Jar­venpa 1997:418) . Men are just as capable of gath­ering, just as women are also capable of participating in hunting activities (Jones 1 996:245) . 
For Elston and Zeanah (2002:105) , successful human adaptation through the Pleistocene/ Holocene transition in the Great Basin was facili­tated by different foraging strategies pursued by men and women. Furthermore, the degree to which both individuals and social groups practiced either residential or logistical mobility strategies was influenced by population density and the structure of local resources. Fluctuations in the availability of resources would have demanded adjustments to diet breadth (Elston and Zeanah 2002: 109). Thus, a division oflabor based on gender would have alle­viated scheduling conflicts due to resource fluctu­ation, moderating the risk of starvation through the use of different subsistence strategies by men and women. They conclude that pre-Archaic occupa­tion sites were positioned for accessing resources utilized by women but with tool assemblages more reflective of men's subsistence and mobility strate­gies (Elston and Zeanah 2002: 121). 
While men and women may pursue subsistence activities that are coordinated to optimize foraging and hunting behaviors, they may also pursue some­what different and even "conflicting" subsistence agendas. According to McGuire and Hildebrandt (2005:696), "what constitutes a subsistence adap­tation may really result from a kind of uneasy, and at times inefficient, brokering of the interests of men and women." In looking at the data from Great Basin settlement systems, they conclude that sites were chosen that permitted logistical hunting strate­gies practiced by men while allowing for residen­tial foraging strategies practiced by women (McGuire and Hildebrandt 2005:704-706) . 
Sharp labor distinctions between men and women are not generally universal (Hays-Gilpin 2000:97) . This view implies that gender roles are immutable (Hill 1998: 109; Stockett 2005:596), when in fact they are often malleable, made so through social performance and social context (Meyers 2003: 197; Stockett 2005:570; Vanpool and Vanpool 2006:54) . While the early assump­tion was that social identities and gender were determined by biological sex, archaeologists who study gender and sex have brought this assump­tion into question. 
Sex has been defined as a biologically based but socially constructed category, while gender is viewed as "the social values inscribed on sex," can vary through time and space and across cultures, and may or may not coincide with biological sex (Hays-Gilpin 2000: 100; Hill 1998: IOI;Silverblatt 1995; Stockett 2005:568; Voss 2000: 185; cf. Van­pool and Vanpool 2006) . In addition, gender as a category intersects with other kinds of social iden­tity, including age, class, and ethnicity (Hays-Gilpin 2000: 100; Meyers 2003: 192). Recently, even the dichotomy of sex and gender has been brought into question, with the argument that gender should be considered as a multidimensional and continuous variable that is most appropriately studied by using a multivariate approach (Hays-Gilpin 2000: 100; Hill 1998:100, 102). 
Although the simplistic identification of gender based on biological sex, as determined by osteo­logical remains, has been critiqued by many gen­der archaeologists, this avenue of inquiry is still regarded as a critical one for examining gender in the archaeological record (Conkey and Gero 1997; Hill 1998; McGuire and Hildebrandt 2005; Mey­ers 2003). Hill points out that studies examining relationships between activity patterns and skele­tal pathology, coupled with contextual evidence, can be used not only to illustrate how the division oflabor relates "empirically to biological sex," but also to confirm how biological males and females may have engaged in "different activities, were involved in the same activities, or produce ambigu­ous results" (Hill 1998: 113-114). 
In the case of the EAP in the Sonoran Desert, the rapid expansion of technological investment (agri­culture) may have differentially affected the labor investments of women (Hayden 1992; Roth 2006). Our results suggest that males employed a logisti­cal mobility strategy, frequently foraging subsis-

tence and material resources over rugged terrain, whereas women were conceivably tethered to the settlement and its immediate investments and resources. Supporting evidence for differential mobility within EAP groups may also come from biological relationships between these communi­ties. A recent study of biological distance based on cranial measurements identified significant pheno­typic variability among males within and between EAP sites, whereas females exhibited greater phe­notypic similarity within sites (Byrd 20 12). Byrd (20 12) suggests that these patterns could result from, and reflect, the practice of male exogamy and matrilocal residence between EAP communities. Although men don't need to be "logistically mobile" to facilitate male exogamy across potentially dis­tant communities, matrilocality-nearly universally accompanied by matrilineal descent and control of agricultural resources (Aberle 1961)-could have enabled women to form stable agricultural com­munities, allowing men to be absent for long peri­ods of time to invest more hea vii y in foraging, trade, or raiding (Divale 1984; Peregrine 200 1). Aberle (1961 :670) identifies that, cross-culturally, "matriliny is most likely to develop on a horticul­tural base, with women doing the agricultural labor." 
Less frequent foraging forays by EAP women could also stem from the agency associated with managing agricultural resources and production. We argue that a baseline of gendered mobility and labor investment within these nascent villages is what propelled the development of agricultural pro­duction and social complexity and points to the critically important role of women in the transition to a settled subsistence strategy in the Sonoran Desert. 
Conclusions 
While significant advances have been made in the use of cross-sectional geometric properties oflong bones for studying skeletal variation and linking in vivo mechanical roles to specific physical activi­ties, as an analytical tool it has been relatively underutilized in archaeological research on ancient populations. Biomechanical variables represent a critical avenue of investigation for archaeologists interested in the effects of shifts in subsistence, occupational, and economic activities on health, social status, and division of labor. 
Here we employed a biomechanical model to test assumptions about gender constructions in sub­sistence strategies and labor investments during the EAP in the Sonoran Desert and identify that early farmers practiced a form of logistic mobility in which males participated in more frequent for­aging forays while females were more likely focused on exploiting floodplain resources and agricultural production. We suggest that the com­pact but steep terrain of the Sonoran Desert con­tributed significantly to enhancing differences in sexual dimorphism in femoral geometry. Regard­less, the shift to agricultural investment in the area resulted in differential labor demands between men and women that may have been facilitated by the development of corporate organization and changes in descent systems, which had additional conse­quences for bone biomechanics.
