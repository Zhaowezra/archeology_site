CR ANIOMETRIC PATTERNING WITHIN ANCIENT PERU 
Ann H. Ross, Douglas H. Ubelaker, and Sonia Guillen 
Numerous studies have used the Howells Peruvian sample from the province ofYauyos as the morphological representative for South America. Although Peru has a rich history of investigations of human skeletal remains, biological distance stud­ies based on craniometrics are limited to nonexistent. This study examines the morphological variation found in Peru using the Howells sample and three additional coastal ( Makatampu and Anc6n) and highland ( Cajamarca) samples. The between­group' variation and the degree of among-group differentiation 
were tested using a canonical discriminant analysis and Mahalanobis D2, respectively. All groups are significantly different from the Yauyos sample and results indicate a closer morphological affinity between coastal groups and the two highland groups. 
Numerosos estudios han utilizado la muestra peruana de Howells de la provincia de Yauyos como el representante morfol6gico para Sudamerica. Aunque Peru tiene una historia rica de investigaciones de restos 6seos humanos, Los estudios de variaci6n biol6gica basados en las medidas craniometricas son limitados. Este estudio examina la variaci6n morfol6gica encontrada en el Peru usando la muestra de Howells y tres muestras adicionales de la costa (Makatampu yAnc6n) y la sierra (Cajamarca) peruana. Los materiales empleados en este trabajo esttin depositados en el Museo Nacional de Arqueolog{a, Antropologia e Historia de la ciudad de Lima. La variaci6n morfometrica y el grado de diferenciaci6n biol6gica fueron probados usando un antilisis multivariado de Los valores D2 de Mahalanobis como distancias morfometricas entre pares de muestras. Todos Los grupos son perceptiblemente diferentes de la muestra de Yauyos y Los resultados indican una afinidad morfol6gica mtis cer­cana entre los grupos costeros y el grupo serrano y demuestra que la muestra original de Howells no refieja adecuadamente la variaci6n morfometrica peruana. 
raniometric studies have a long and rich Chistory in physical anthropology as have investigations of human remains from Latin America (Boas l 912a, 1912b; Cocilovo and Roth­hammer 1990, 1996, 1999; Dittmar 1996; Erick­sen 1962; FrieB and Baylac 2003; Gonzalez-Jose et al. 2005; MacCurdy 1923; Morton 1839; Neves et al. 2005; Newman 1943; Ross et al. 2002a; Roth­hammer and Silva 1989; Rothhammer et al. 1982, 1984; Stewart 1943; Ubelaker 1981, 1987; Varela and Cocilovo 1999, 2000; Verano 1997a, 1997b, 2001a, 2001 b; Verano et al. 1999). Long published lists of measurements and indices dominated pub­lications in physical anthropology in the early twen­tieth century but allowed few meaningful syntheses or interpretations of population relationships. Grad­ually, that approach to craniometrics has evolved 
into the sophisticated databases of today, which coupled with complex statistical analysis, enable augmented understanding of size and shape mor­phology and what they can reveal about the bio­logical distance among groups. Although issues remain regarding the extent of environmental influ­ence on cranial morphology, craniometrics clearly represents a key methodology to examine past pop­ulation variation and morphological relationships. 
Historically, craniometric studies in Peru have received considerable academic attention through the work of W.W. Howells. Howells' landmark pub­lication "Cranial Variation in Man" surveyed sam­ples from around the world, building a computerized database of detailed cranial mea­surements ( 1973). His multivariate analysis of this worldwide sample enabled analysis and detection

of patterns which in tum offered insights in evolu­tionary relationships. His statistical approach to revealing patterns on a large database represented a major methodological advance of previous approaches of describing "type" specimens within preconceived "racial" categories. This approach succeeded in breaking down old stereotypes of racial clustering and allowed statistics and objec­tive scientific approaches to discover patterns where they existed. 
As impressive and innovative as the study was, its worldwide scope precluded detailed examina­tion of any one region. The goal was to examine morphological patterning on a global scale, not to examine the effects of microevolution or regional dynamics. Thus, Latin America was represented by only one sample: Yauyos from Peru. 
Because the Howells database was worldwide in scope and assembled in such a quality manner, it has been used extensively for many studies beyond the original monograph to assess morpho­logical association of individual crania and sam­ples (e.g., Lynch 1990; Relethford 1994; Relethford and Harpending 1994; Roseman 2004; Roseman and Weaver 2004; Ross et al. 2002b). The Howells database is now also freely available for down­loading (http://konig.la.utk.edu/howells.htm) and available to users in FORDISC, a flexible system that allows custom discriminant functions to be calculated from partial lists of measurements, which has major forensic applications. However, because the single Yauyos sample from Peru is the only representative from Latin America, it is not clear if resulting classifications provide a clear and realistic image of diversity and thus if resulting interpretations are realistic. Basically, a question remains if the Yauyos sample is truly representa­tive of Latin America or even of ancient Peru. 
This study attempts to partially answer questions embedded in these issues. It also represents a regional aspect of a larger study designed to doc­ument in much greater detail cranial variation throughout Latin America, specifically the broad time period between the time of Christ and initial European contact. Although Peru has a long his­tory of bioarchaeological investigations, studies of biological distance among the different cultural groups and between coastal andAndean groups are limited or nonexistent. To this end, we present a study of craniometric variation of the original How­ells's sample and three additional samples from Peru to address the issue of Peruvian variation. In addition, we will also address the question of High­land/Coastal differentiation. 
Materials and Methods 
Materials 
Only undeformed adult crania were included in this study, and males and females were pooled in order to incorporate all of the observed biological variation within a population, as sex-related vari­ation is assumed to be negligible within each pop­ulation in among-populations comparisons (Sardi et al. 2005). Sex and age were assessed by the first two authors using gross morphological cranial fea­tures. The criterion for inclusion was adult crania and thus age was determined only to the extent of "adult" and "subadult." The samples used in this investigation include the data collected by W.W. Howells from Yauyos, Peru, in the central high­lands in the old province of Yauyos. The Makatampu (or MacaTambo) sample is from the central coast, Rimac River valley. This archaeo­logical site was situated between Lima and Callao and was excavated in the 1940s when the city of Lima was expanding and dates from the time of Christ toA.D. 800 (Chavez 1968). The Anc6n sam­ple is also from the central coast and corresponds to the Late Intermediate period (A.D. 900-1300.) (Kaulicke 1997). The crania from Cajamarca, located in the northern highlands or Sierra, are from the San Pablo district and are composed of remains from the sites of Maqui Maqui and Rumi Lanchi, corresponding to Cajamarca I or II (A.D. 1-100) and Cajamarca IV or later (A.D. 
1000-1200), respectively. Ericksen (1962) con­cluded that the sites represented regional continu­ity and were thus combined for the purpose of this analysis (see Figure 1 for more detailed sample location). These samples are all curated at the Museo Nacional de Arqueologia, Antropologia e Historia in Lima. These samples were selected for their availability at the single Lima museum loca­tion, their generally excellent preservation, groups with undeformed crania, and their representations of distinct regions within Peru that contrasted geo­graphically with the original Yauyos sample. The sample composition is presented in Table 1.

forensic applications. This subset was originally developed to standardize the metric collection from human skeletal remains particularly for forensic identifications. The measurements included in this suite were those found to be reliable and repeat­able across observers, reducing the possibility of interobserver error while enabling the use of data from various sources (Moore-Jansen and Jantz 1994; Ousley and Jantz 1998). 
In order to include the majority of the individ­uals from the original dataset and to keep the sam­ple sizes high, it was necessary to estimate missing values. The computer program NORM: Multiple imputations of incomplete multivariate data under a normal model (Schafer 1999) was used to impute the missing values, which can be downloaded from the web (http://www.stat.psu.edu/-jls/ mis­oftwa.html#mi). NORM is an iterative simulation procedure that uses a type of Markov chain Monte Carlo technique to generate random draws, where the distribution of each draw depends on the pre­vious draw (Schaf er 1999). 
To examine craniofacial variation while directly accounting for size effects, size and shape vari­ables were calculated from the raw measurements according to Mosimann and coworkers (Darroch and Mosimann 1985; Mosimann and James 1979). Size is defined as the geometric mean (GM) of all 18 variables. The GM of n variables is calculated as 

and the new shape variables are created by divid­ing each raw measurement by the GM (Y 
= 
X/SIZE). Although the newly created shape vari­ables do not remove absolute size, they provide a better understanding as to the geometric or shape related similarity among the groups. To test the null hypothesis that the mean size is not significantly different among the groups, a one-way analysis of variance (AN OVA) was performed on the size vari­able (GM). A canonical discriminant analysis that summarize between-population variation, was conducted on the newly transformed shape vari­ables. A Pearson correlation analysis was also per­formed to test the strength of the relationship between the size variable and the canonical axes. In addition, Mahalanobis D2 was utilized to mea­sure the degree of differentiation among the groups. All statistical analyses were performed using the SAS system for Windows Version 8 (2001 ). 
Results 
Summary statistics are presented in Table 3. The ANOVA for the size variable or GM did not yield a significant difference among the groups suggest­ing that there are no overall significant size differ­ences among the populations (R-square .005, PR > F . 785). However, the Pearson correlation revealed a weak relationship between CAN2, CAN3 and the GM (r -.143, P < .027; r = -. 165, 
= 
P < .011) respectively, suggesting that some of the variation observed for CAN2 and CAN3 using the transformed shape variables is influenced by size or size-related shape variation. The first axis, how­ever, is not correlated to size, indicating that the dif­ference observed on this axis is shape-related and not significantly influenced by size. 
Table 4 presents the three significant canonical axes, which roughly shows that 69 percent of the among-group shape variation is accounted for on CANl, 19 percent on CAN2, and 11 percent on CAN3. The total canonical structure, the correla­tion between the original variables and the canon­ical variates, is given in Table 5. The total canonical structure indicates that the variation on CANl is associated with vault length; CAN2 is related to maxillary breadth, and CAN3 to orbit height. Fig­ures 2 and 3 reveal that the coastal groups have short cranial vaults, with Ancon having high orbits and narrow maxilla and Makatampu having low orbits and broad maxillae, while the highland groups have relatively long cranial vaults with Cajamarca hav-

ing high orbits and broad maxillae and Yauyos hav­ing moderate orbit height and moderate maxillary breadth. 
D2 values are presented in Table 6. Analyses revealed high levels of significance among all sample-to-sample comparisons. This reflects the relatively large samples utilized and of course the morphological affinities that exist. It suggests that the differences found reflect real morphological sample variation and likely not random sampling error. 
All three of the samples are distinct from the Yauyos sample. The central coastal Makatampu sample showed greatest similarity to the central coastal Ancon sample, followed by both highland Yauyos and Cajamarca samples. Ancon is most similar to the Makatampu series followed by the Yauyos and Cajamarca samples. Cajamarca is most similar to the Yauyos, followed by Makatampu and Ancon. 
The squared Mahalanobis distance results indi­cate a closer morphological affinity between the coastal groups and between the two highland groups. This pattern can also be visually observed in Figures I and 2. Thus, regional patterning seems to reflect and be divided along ecological zones of highland-coastal differentiation rather than other geographic variables. 
Summary and Conclusions 
The results of this study suggest that pre-Hispanic crania within Peru demonstrate regional variation demarcated along costal and highland ecological zones. Coastal groups are characterized as having relatively short cranial vaults with Ancon having high orbits and Makatampu having low orbits. The highland or Sierra groups are characterized as hav­ing relatively long cranial vaults with Cajamarca having high orbits and Yauyos having moderate orbits. These results appear to concur with the clas­sic work of Newman ( 1943) who found that coastal

ization of crania from Caj amarca over time that was attributed to possible increased gene flow from the coast or to an in situ microevolutionary trend .. Clearly the Yauyos sample utilized in the original Howells study does not adequately reflect this vari­ation. All three of the additional Peruvian samples differ significantly from Yauyos indicating that Peruvian crania collectively display more variation than is reflected in the Yauyos sample. Considera­tion of all these samples provides a more realistic impression of variation within Peru. In addition, this study concurs with the investigation by Dittmar (1996) who found that there were significant mor­phological similarities between Peruvian and

Chilean coastal populations and Peruvian/Bolivian and Argentinean highland populations suggesting that morphological variation in South America may reflect low-high altitude adaptations. Similarly, modem anthropometric studies of high and low­land South Americans have found altitude­dependent differences in chest morphology (Rupert and Hochachka 2001 ). Weinstein (2005) concluded that postcranial morphological variation between highland and coastal Andean groups could be attrib­uted to both climate and diet and that gene flow had a negligible effect as coastal Andean populations remained biologically isolated from their highland neighbors. However, on a macro scale, Ackermann and Cheverud (2004) concluded that that the pri­mary force for facial diversification in the genus Homo was genetic drift. Similarly, Ross (2004) found that drift was responsible for the differenti­ation between two closely related Balkan groups and should not be overlooked as shaping human variation. In addition, Pucciarelli et al. (2006) found evidence of an East-West cranial differentiation in precontact populations in South America. Geo­graphic barriers such as mountain ranges are effec­tive genetic barriers limiting gene flow and could account for much of the variation observed in Peru­vian coastal and highland populations. The cran­iofacial morphological differences could reflect both in situ adaptations through the nonrandom forces of selection following early migration into South America and other microevolutionary forces such as drift with subsequent biological isolation between highland and coastal populations. This study further demonstrates that the Americas are much more heterogeneous than previously thought, and, interestingly, much of the variation may be divided along coastal and highland populations. These data also contribute to improved under­standing of variation within Latin America and how highland coastal distinctions can relate to human cranial variation and population differentiation.
