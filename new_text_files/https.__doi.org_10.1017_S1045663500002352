la familia reinante de Xunantunich durante la fase Sama]. Durante la primera mitad de la fase Hats' Chaak, Xunan­tunich vivio su apogeo constructivo y el asentamiento adquirio su forma final, y esto esta relacionado con la expansion de Naranjo. Hacia finales del siglo VII e ini­cios de! VIII, los gobemantes de Naranjo habian esta­blecido con exito su autoridad en la parte central de! este del Peten, y es en este momento que Xunantunich adquiere su morfologfa intema y se construyo un com­plejo tipo palacio en la parte norte de la acropolis. La forma intema del sitio muestra arquitectura ordenada a las cuatro direcciones cardinales. Por ejemplo, las tres plaza principales (A-I, A-II, A-III) y el Grupo C estan orientados en un eje norte-sur, mientras que las calzadas I y II integran el eje este y oeste respectivamente. En cuanto al nuevo complejo tipo palacio, las investigacio­nes en campo no revelaron un trono real, y esto sugiere que quienes ocuparon este nuevo complejo formaron parte de una elite subordinada polfticamente a Naranjo. 
Los vfnculos de dependencia que mantuvo Xunan­tunich con Naranjo en la primera mitad de la fase Hat's Chaak desaparecieron en la segunda mitad de la misma debido a que Naranjo decayo como unidad polftica. En esta segunda parte de la fase Hat's Chaak, Xunantunich surgio como un centro autonomo y prueba de esto son 
Jos monumentos esculpidos que proclaman su superio­ridad polftica, el USO de la ceramica Mount Malony de engobe negro que refleja una identidad local y, aparen­temente, individuos de alto estatus-como los que resi­dieron en el Grupo D-que si bien no formaron parte de la elite, mantuvieron cierta autonomfa y prueba de ello fue la produccion de objetos lfticos de alto estatus. 
Durante la segunda mitad de la fase Hat's Chaak el area inmediata a Xunantunich tambien sufrio transfor­maciones, y la explicacion de estos cambios constituye el objetivo de la tercera parte del Ii bro que esta integrada por una segunda seccion introductoria y cuatro capftu­los. Por ejemplo, en el capftulo 11 se analiza el papel que pudieron haber jugado miembros pertenecientes a la elite del area inmediata a Xunantunich para con los agricul­tores de los diferentes sitios menores cuando el valor del trabajo y la productividad marginal habian decafdo durante la fase Hat's Chaak. Otro aspecto interesante de la economfa del area periferica inmediata a Xunantunich-como se investiga en el capftulo 12-se relaciona con la produccion de objetos lfticos de sflex en unidades domesticas rurales que exhiben marcadas dife­rencias. Por un lado, se reporta la interdependencia en la produccion entre unidades domesticas de Succotz y Dos Chombitos, por otro lado, la autonomfa en la pro­duccion de esos objetos esta documentada en los asen­tamientos de Chan y Callar Creek. Una respuestas a estos dos modos tan diferentes de produccion pudiera ser que Xunantunich nunca influyo o controlo esa actividad; la segunda respuesta es que no parece haber existido una 

produccion organizada a gran escala como ha sido docu­mentado en Colha, Belice. 
Los estudios del area inmediata a Xunantunich tam­bien revelan que individuos pertenecientes a un estatus social alto vivieron en esta area. Estos individuos resi­dfan en sitios menores y parecen haberse esmerado en hacer mas manejables o llevaderas las relaciones socia­les y polfticas entre sus comunidades al momento en el que Xunantunich estaba expandiendose ( capitulo 13). En el capftulo 14 se analiza la forma en la cual comunida­des que existfan en el area inmediata vecina de Xunan­tunich se beneficiaron por la nueva estructura economica y polftica que acompafio a la transformacion de Xunan­tunich. Individuos pertenecientes a estos grupos se afi­liaron a las reglas de la nueva unidad polftica para tomar ventaja de las redes economicas en las que Xunantunich participo y, hasta cierto punto, controlo. 
La cuarta parte del libro esta integrada por dos capf­tulos ( 15-16) en donde el lector encontrara la sfntesis y conclusiones tanto de! Proyecto Arqueol6gico Xunantu­nich como de! proyecto Reconocimiento del Asenta­miento Xunantunich. Sin lugar a dudas, dos aportaciones destacan de! libro Classic Maya Provincial Politics: Xunantunich and its Hinterlands. Primero, la enorme y significativa cantidad de informacion que se obtiene de sitios secundarios y menores para comprender aspectos politicos de! Clasico Tardio donde los estudios han sido dominados por sitios de mas de 15 0 20 km2 que alber­gan una considerable cantidad de monumentos esculpi­dos (como Tikal y Caracol). Segundo, el esplendido uso de datos arqueologicos en un intento por comprender y reconstruir parte de los procesos que vivieron y experi­mentaron los antiguos ocupantes de! este de! Peten.

The Northern Maya Lowlands has long been treated as a cultural backwater in Maya archaeology. This per­ception is slowly beginning to change as indicated by The Ancient Maya of Mexico, a volume that contains 14 chapters organized chronologically into five parts derived from two 2009 SAA sessions that paid tribute to Wyllys Andrews V. 
Chapter 1 opens with editor Geoffrey Braswell's overview and discussion of a "new paradigm" for the northern Maya lowlands. The introduction presents an in situ regional history and emphasizes its integral role

in understanding developments in the southern and cen­tral lowlands, as well as interaction and competition at the site, region, and Maya culture area scales. Some of this coverage, however, is uneven. Middle Preclassic sites are now known to be numerous, although Braswell mentiones niether the large Middle Preclassic center of Xcoch in the Puuc hills nor the possibility of interaction between the northern Maya and the Olmec. The Late Pre­classic-Early Classic transition is seen as reflecting increased regionalism and the emergence of state soci­eties. Nonetheless, Teotihuacan's possible interaction with the Yucatan is dismissed; unfortunately, inaccurate characterizations and a failure to cite recent publications undermine this conclusion. The impact of droughts is noted in passing, although recent (unmentioned) paleo­climatic research at Xcoch and vicinity demonstrate that cyclical drought and water storage strategies were major 
factors in the Puuc region from the Preclassic to Classic periods. Cehpech-Sotuta pottery, ceramics and obsidian trade during the Terminal Classic are covered as well as the question of Chichen Itza and the Toltecs. New data from Postclassic Mayapan and historical studies are pro­viding new insights into late and reoccurring Maya col­lapse and resilience. 
In Chapter 2, David Anderson discusses 24 Middle Preclassic ballcourts from NW Yucatan, the largest con­centration of early ballcourts currently known for Mesoamerica. Most of the ballcourts, discovered during the Proyecto Costa Maya settlement survey, are rela­tively small and found near the center of early settle­ments. Anderson argues that these structures were unlikely to have been controlled by elites and served a more popular, traditional role. 

Chapter 3 by Nancy Peniche addresses the architec­ture of power at Middle Preclassic Xaman Susula. Peniche proposes that palaces equate with state societies and the exclusive presence of temple buildings may sig­nify chiefdoms. She further distinguishes between indi­vidualizing (monopolize wealth and production) and group-oriented (corporate strategies of political integra­tion) chiefdoms. Xaman Susula's 1714-Asub is argues to be a public building, type unknown, belonging to an individualized chiefdom. 
Joyce Marcus (Chapter 4) employs her Dynamic Model and political cycling to explain the distribution of the Kaan (Snake Head) emblem glyph at Calakmul and its neighbors starting in the Middle Preclassic. Emblem glyphs can refer to divine lords of a particular polity and not the polity itself, indicating that the lords and their emblem may have circulated. Oddly, the Kaan emblem glyph did not appear at Calakmul until AD 636 and it was known as the Bat polity in the Early Classic period. Marcus posits several different scenarios for the dynamics of political cycling and the rarity of Kaan glyphs at Calakmul, but it is particularly fascinating that she feels that the process of state formation in the Mirador Basin was similar to that of the Zapotecs. 

Chapter 5 by Scott Hudson discusses urbanism, archi­tecture, and internationalism at Chunchucmil and Iza­mal, two Early Classic sites of the Northern Lowlands. With some of the most voluminous construction in the Maya world, Izamal is estimated to cover 53 sq km yet the chronology of its low density settlement areas is not well established. Chunchucmil, on the other hand, has a high density residential core (950 structure per sq km) and a 20 to 25 sq km total site area. The presence of a marketplace at Chunchucmil indicates exchange of var­ious products but, if local agricultural production was as limted as Hudson contends, the question of how tens of thousands of inhabitants were supplied with foodstuffs remains an opened question. Hudson also addresses Late Preclassic and Early Classic megalithic architecture and its prevalence across northern Yucatan and concludes with a discussion of Teotihuacan-style open-work (tri­pod) supports in the Maya area and Central Mexico. 
The archaeology around the Champoton region is taken up by Jerald Ek (Chapter 6). Intensive survey along the coast and the interior reveals settlement patterns and chronological phases from early Middle Preclassic to Protohistoric times. The significant Late Classic interior sites of Ulumal and San Dimas are also discussed. The coastal region around Champoton reflects the Late-Ter­minal Classic shift in trade from low-bulk, high-value items to the movement of high-bulk, low value items of the Postclassic. 
In Chapter 7 Witschey and Brown describe their long­term mapping project of Maya sites. With a database that now exceeds 5,000 sites, the authors discuss the prob­lems of precision, accuracy, and completeness such as the difficulties of accessing sites from government reports, transcribing GPS coordinates, etc. It is clear as well that not all sites have been included and many sites still await discovery. Their Electronic Atlas, published as maps, computer datasets, and Google Earth files, has been used by researchers, university students, as well as teachers and students in primary and secondary educa­tion. This database is extremely valuable and will con­tinue to be so for years to come. 
The Nunnery Quadrangle at Uxmal is the subject of Chapter 8 by William Ringle. Using a wide range of Maya and Mesoamerican data, he proposes that this Late Uxmal Puuc style structure with its highly deco­rated facades functioned as a political complex dedi­cated to the kingly direction of the four "estates" of the Uxmal polity. These estates were represented by vaulted range structures to the north (for the King), a priestly or noble council to the west, the military to the east, and subject or allied centers to the south. It is refresh­ing to see a reconstruction of Nunnery that does not overemphasize religious ideology. Ringle explores the

roots of this quadrangular form and surmises that it derived from Early Classic Teotihuacan, but the dating of the Nunnery clearly places it to the early tenth cen­tury. This work is quite an advance over previous stud­ies, yet it is sad that more systematic problem-oriented excavation has not taken place at the Nunnery and else­where at Uxmal, and the lack of a complete settlement map greatly hinders any understanding of the process of urbanism. 
Chapter 9 by Geoffrey Braswell and Nancy Peniche reports on the excavations of the Great Platform at Chichen Itza. Collaborating with Rafeal Cobos Palma (UADY ), trenches were placed between the Castillo Pyramid and the West Colonnade and south of the Great Ballcourt where there are remains of a perimeter wall. While trenching excavations show ten stages of con­struction east of the Pyramid, the tentative construction sequence of platform structures is marred by the lack of detailed ceramic analysis and new radiocarbon dates. The authors conclude, however, that Chichen was slowly built over centuries, including an International style of art and architecture, which they argue renders untenable the traditional model of Maya Chichen being replaced by a Toltec Chichen. 
An interpretation of the perimeter wall excavated at Chichen Itza is the subject of Chapter 10 by Lauren Hahn and Geoffrey Braswell. They propose three hypotheses for wall function: defense, water management, and social space. The initial stage of construction was atop the Great Platform and contained finished masonry that served to segregate space between elites and commoners. Later, the wall assumes a defensive function being enlarged considerably and buttressed with hastily added bulk rub­ble and core-veneer masonry. There is little evidence for a large-scale burning event or ritual destruction of build­ings at Chichen Itza, so the major factors explaining the decline and fall of the city remain at large. 
In one of the more interesting papers, Gabrielle Vail and Christine Hernandez (Chapter 11) reexamine Bal­ankanche Cave and the rain and fertility rituals invok­ing the male rain god Chaak and the female creator deity Chak Che!. This cave contains numerous artifacts includ­ing Tlaloc effigy censers, studded biconical censers (Chaak?), and Xipe Totec effigy vessels clearly related to rainmaking and renewal ceremonies. Based on an examination of the Late Postclassic iconographic and epi­graphic records, the authors conclude that Chaak and Chak Che! are male-female counterparts represented in 
Balakanche by artifacts depicting male and female activ­ities that involved repeated rituals of world renewal and rainmaking ceremonies. They do not explain why arti­facts depicting central Mexican deities are so prominent in a Maya cave but they do acknowledge that such rain and renewal rituals in cave settings have great time depth in the Yucatan (e.g., at Gruta de Chae). 

In Chapter 12 Brown et al. explore house size as a measure of wealth employing modem economics to Post­classic Mayapan, Terminal Classic Sayil, and Late Clas­sic Palenque. Their statistical results show Pareto distributions suggesting significant differentials in poverty and wealth, with the exception that Mayapan exhibits a more equal wealth distribution. One must won­der, however, if house size is an unambiguous proxy for wealth. For example, ethnoarchaeological research among traditional Maya farmers shows that maize store­houses, one sign of wealth, can constitute one third of buildings in small-size houselots and that some large house lots, because of family size, can be among the poor­est in a community. Nevertheless, the authors feel this sta­tistical approach is expandable and that the distribution of wealth at other sites should be a research priority. 
In one of the volume's best contributions, Rani Alexander (Chapter 13) employs the framework of resilience theory to analyze the collapse of the Maya at different times in their history. Her paper explores the strategies employed in settlement aggregation and dis­persal, reorganization of the built environment, and household production before and after the catastrophes of the Spanish Conquest and Caste War of Yucatan. She concludes that the magnitude of demographic decline in historic times is comparable to (or exceeds) the Classic Maya collapse and that there was a great diversity of res­idential stability and length of occupation. Alexander also observes that communities employed radically dif­ferent political strategies to preserve autonomous lead­ership and developed different tactics to preserve land ownership. Clearly, this dynamic approach linking the­ory to the archaeological and historical records will pay great dividends in the quest to understand the past. 
Joyce Marcus provides her usual insightful com­mentary in Chapter 14. After a review of the northern lowlands, she guides the reader chronologically dis­cussing the major points of the chapters and other related issues. She is impressed with the growing knowledge of the Preclassic period arguing that in situ developments have been seriously underestimated. Her look ahead underscores the need to resolve the transitions from Archaic to Early Preclassic to Middle Preclassic, pre­scribes more extensive household archaeology, and encourages archaeologists to find new ways to analyze Maya sites besides using just pottery. The significant contributions to Maya studies by Wyllys Andrews V and family is dutifully and affectionately acknowledged. 
The Ancient Maya of Mexico is an important volume that presents new data on Maya studies in the Northern Lowlands. Though the volume is a little pricey, it will become required reading and should be on the library shelf of every Mesoamericanist. This volume is a fitting tribute to the career of Wyllys Andrews V and his influ­ence on Maya archaeology, present and future.
