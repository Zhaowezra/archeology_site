AMERICA'S FIRST POLYMER SCIENTISTS: RUBBER PROCESSING, 

USE AND TRANSPORT IN MESOAMERICA 
Michael J. Tarkanian and Dorothy Hosler 
Ancient Mesoamericans were making rubber by at least 1600 B.C, mixing latex from Castilla elastica trees with juice from lpornoea alba (morning glory) vines. The combination of ethnographic, archaeological and mechanical data presented in this text illustrate that ancient Mesoamericans had fully developed this process, and consciously tailored the mechanical properties of rubber to suit requirements of specific applications by altering the ratio of latex to I. alba juice. Our data focus on rubber balls, sandal soles, and rubber bands for hafting and joining. Elasticity, the mechanical property that defines the ability of a rubber ball to bounce, is maximized with a 1: 1 volume ratio of latex to I. alba juice. Rubber with high wear resistance, vital to the life and functionality of a sandal sole, can be created by mixing C. elas tica latex with 25 percent I. alba juice by volume. Unprocessed C. elastica latex, without I. alba juice, is the material best suited for joining applica­tions, such as adhesives or hafting bands, where strength and ability to absorb shock is of the greatest importance. Tribute data from sixteenth-century codices substantiate that rubber was processed for specific applications within the Aztec empire-rubber and latex goods were processed and constructed in the C. elastica-bearing regions, and then shipped to the capital for use or further distribution. 
Los antiguos pobladores de Mesoamerica procesaban el hule desde por lo menos 1600 a.C., mezclando el latex del arbol Castilla elastica con el Jugo obtenido de los bejucos de lpornoea alba, una especie de dondiego de dfa. La combinaci6n de los datos etnograficos, arqueol6gicos y j(sicos que se presentan en este texto muestra que los mesoamericanos descubrieron el amplio rango de propiedades mecanicas que se pueden obtener al combinar el latex con el Jugo de I. alba en diferentes pro­porciones, y que aplicaron estos conocimientos para manipular las propiedades del hule segun el uso especifico que se le fuera a dar. Nuestro estudio se enfocara en Ires ejemplos: las pelotas de hule, las bandas anchas de hule que servfan para enman­gaduras, y las sandalias con suelas de hule. Los datos de nuestra investigaci6n revelan que el hule que se obtiene al mezclar un 50 por ciento de lpornoea alba por volumen, ser{a la combinaci6n ideal para la manufactura de las pelotas donde se requiere de una maxima elasticidad y rebate. En cambio, para las suelas de hule de las sandalias, la resistencia al desgaste y la fatiga son las propiedades mecanicas mas importantes, y esto se lograba al agregar el 25 por ciento de Jugo de I. alba por volumen. Por su parte, el ldtex seco, sin procesar, es el material mas apropiado para crear las bandas anchas de enmangar, donde se requiere de una mayor fuerza de tension, rigidez y capacidad de amortiguamiento. La hip6tesis de que el hule se preparaba en varias formas en Mesoamerica es sugerida por algunas fuentes documentales del siglo dieciseis. En los documentos trib­utarios del imperio azteca se apunta que los artfculos de hule y latex habrfan sido procesados y manufacturados en las regiones donde los arboles de C. elastica son endemicos y desde ah{ transportados a la capital mexica o a los centros tributarios del 
imperio.  
Rubber is a material that was first processed in ancient Mesoamerica. The history of rubber usually begins in 1839 with Charles  were employing rubber and latex in medicines and rituals, for rubber balls for the Mesoamerican ball­game, and for sandal soles. Several lines of evi­

2003; Tarkanian and Hosler 2000, 2001). Materi­als associated with large rubber balls excavated from the Olmec site of Manati, Veracruz, Mexico have been radiocarbon dated to as early as 1600 B.C. (Rodrfguez and Ortiz 1994; Ortiz and Rodriguez 1994), marking the earliest known use of rubber in the world. This complements data that place the earliest known ball court, at Paso de la Amada, Chiapas, Mexico, at 1400 B.C. (uncali­brated) (Hill et al. 1998). References to rubber balls are abundant in the Popol Vuh (Tedlock 1985), in which the ballgame plays a central role in the story of the heroes Hunahpu and Xbalanque and their fathers, One Hunahpu and Seven Hunahpu. The repeated references to rubber balls in the Popol Vuh make clear that this material was sufficiently embedded in the world of the Classic Maya to con­stitute a primary theme in that work, which explains the origins of the universe and the human species. 
The data we present in this paper indicate that ancient Mesoamerican peoples were cognizant of the range of mechanical properties made possible by processing C. elastica latex with varying con­centrations of /. alba vine juice. This knowledge was a prerequisite to their ability to process rubbe r selectively for specific applications such as rubber balls and sandal soles, and for joining applications such as adhesives or hafting bands. These three applications stand out from the many other Mesoamerican uses of rubber and latex docu­mented in this paper. 
Rather than using one static "recipe" for rubber, the experimental laboratory data we present sug­gests that ancient Mesoamericans employed an adjustable rubber-making procedure to process rub­ber for specific needs. This allowed them the abil­ity to maximize the elasticity of rubber for use in balls, create wear-resistant material for sandal soles, and prioritize strength and shock -absorption for adhesion and hafting bands. By evaluating these data in conjunction with information from sixteenth­century tribute documents-specifically Codex Mendoza and lnformaci6n de 1554: sabre Los tri­butos que Los indios pagaban a Moctezuma-we

contend that ancient Mesoamericans were likely processi ng latex and rubber for specific applica­tions in the areas of Mesoamerica where C. elas­tica was indigenous. Finished goods would then be shipped as tribute throughout the Aztec empire. 
In this text, we will refer to "latex" as the dried unprocessed material directly out of the tree, and we will refer to the processed material as "rubber." 
Archaeological and Documentary 
Evidence for Rubber Use 

Apart from rubber balls, which we treat in detail in a subsequent section, archaeological and docu­mentary data provide evidence of a wide variety of rubber and latex items in ancient Mesoamerica. Some of these would have gained performance benefits through processing the C. elastica with lpomoea alba. The performance of other items required the properties conferred by unprocessed 
C. elastica latex. 
There is documented and archaeological evi­dence of latex being employed in ancient joining applications, such as hafting and adhesives.Among the Late Phase (ca. 1224-1461 A.D.) rubber and latex artifacts dredged from the Cenote de Sacrifi­cios at Chichen ltza (Coggins and Ladd 1992:353) is part of an effigy headdress composed of ceramic and wood. The wooden portion is coated in rubber, with the ceramic pressed against the rubber layer and fastened into place with a thick rubber band (Ball and Ladd 1992:230, Peabody Museum cat. No. C4780). This artifact uses latex as a hafting band. Coggins and Ladd ( 1992:356) also assert that Edward H. Thompson dredged and identified rub­ber-hafted blades from the Cenote de Sacrificios. Tensile strength is an essential material property for rubber to function effectively in any hafting appli­cation. In the case of the rubber-hafted blades described by Thompson, the band may also func­tion as a damping mechanism. The extent to which the material absorbs shock could be a crucial attribute if the object is a striking tool. 
Latex was used for adhesive applications in ancient Mesoamerica. Among the Maya, Tozzer (1957: 1: 144) explains that "[f]lint points from the Sacred Cenote at Chichen have at their base remains of a pitch, probably rubber, that served as an adhesive for attachment to shafts." In Ralph Roys' translation of Ritual of the Bacabs, he makes a similar suggestion in footnotes annotating the "the birth of the flint" (Roys 1965:61). In this sec­tion, the native text mentions "the resin of the white kik-che-tree" (Roys 1965:63), with very little con­text. Roys writes that he "can only surmise that the kik-che (rubber tree) is cited because its sap was employed in attaching the flint point to the arrow ­shaft, although I do not know that it was so used" (Roys 1965:63). Like hafting bands, high tensile strength is essential in adhesives. If an adhesive has ability to wet and attach to a surface (which is quan­tified as "adhesive strength"), its efficacy as an adhesive is then largely dependent on its "cohesive strength." Cohesive strength is directly correlated with tensile strength. 
The Florentine Codex contains repeated refer­ences to rubber-soled sandals, but the archaeolog­ical record has yet to produce corroborating physical evidence. In writing about the character­istics of the "Olmeca, Uixtoti, Mixteca" peoples, Fray Bernardino de Sahagun (1961:10:187-188) observes that "the sandals of the men were very pre­cious; also, they walked in rubber sandals." The original Nahuatl text of this passage helps to con­firm the existence of rubber-soled sandals, using the specific word olcactli for sandals. Cactli is a known Nahuatl word for "zapatos, sandalias, calzado en general" (Simeon 1977 :58) . Olcactli is a literal compound of the ol-root of rubber and cactli for sandal (Louise Burkhart, personal com­munication 2004). Another passage describes the Aztec dress during a procession to a vigil on "feast day": "And there were their rubber sandals; their rubber sandals went with them" (Sahagun 1981:2:44). In this case, the Nahuatl compound for "their rubber sandals" is ymolcac, combining ym­( their) with the ol-from olli and -cac from cactli. The -tli suffix is dropped for possessive nouns (Louise Burkhart, personal communication 2004). In volume six, Sahagun describes the contents of prayers to Tlaloc, in which worshippers ask that the rulers and Gods "take up the rubber sandals" (Sahagun 1969:6:39). 
InMonarqufa indiana, Torquemada furthers the case for the existence of rubber sandals in his descriptions of natural products the Aztec derived from trees. In describing the products of the rub­ber tree "uscuahuitl" (Torquemada 1977: 4:429) Torquemada writes: "Acostumbran antiguamente los reyes y sefiores hacer suelas y zapatos a su

usanza de este dicho ulli, y se las mandaban calzar a los truhanes o chocarreros, enanos y corcovados de palacio, para burlar de ellos, porque no podfan andar con ellos sin caer ... " (Torquemada 1977 :4:430). 
Diego Munoz Camargo also writes of rubber­soled sandals in Relaciones Geograficas del Siglo 
XVI: Tlaxcala. He offers: "... entiendo que, si se hiciesen suelas de zapatos de este uli ... que el que estas suelas se pusiese, le harfan ir saltando contra su voluntad por dondequiera que fuese" (Munoz Camargo 1984: 271). While Munoz Camargo's assessment of the effects of wearing rubber-soled sandals is clearly exaggerated, his mention of this footwear, coupled with the accounts of Sahagun and Torquemada, provide ample evidence for the fabrication of rubber sandals in Mesoamerica prior to the arrival of the Spaniards. 
Rubber Processing and Raw Materials 
In The Florentine Codex, Fray Bernardino de Sahagun identifies the Aztec source of latex as the tree olquauitl (Sahagun 1963: 11: 112). Olquauitl is the Nahuatl word for Castilla elastica, a species of latex-producing tree found throughout Mexico and Central America. C. elastica is most commonly found in the Mexican states of Chiapas, Veracruz, Tabasco, and the Yucatan peninsula, (Figure 2) below altitudes of700 m (Standley 192 0). In Cen­tral America, the tree grows on the lowland coasts of both the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. According to the botanist Paul C. Standley, C. elastica could also be found in the western Andes of Ecuador in the early twentieth century (Standley 192 0). 
Castilla elastica was the most practical source of latex available to ancient Mesoamerican soci­eties. In terms of mechanical properties such as elasticity, toughness and strength, as well as ease of use, C. elastica is far superior to other Mesoamerican alternatives including Guayule (Parthenium argentatum) (Lloyd 1911) or plants from the Euphorbia genus (Altamirano y Rose 1905). Guayule, a shrub, requires grinding the plant matter to extract latex, while C. elastica, trees in the Euphorbia genus, and Hevea brasiliensis (the source of commercial latex) secrete latex when the bark is cut.

The latex from C. elastica is a sticky, viscous whi te liquid when gathered direc tly from the tree. The latex turns brown and becomes rigid, and brit­tle as it dries. In this fonn, the dried latex lacks the mechanical properties required for balls, sandals, or hafting bands-each of which may require spe­cific combinations of elasticity, toughness, and strength. Elasticity is a quantification of"bounce," the ability of a material to store and release energy of defonnation efficiently. Toughness describes a material's resistance to fracture. The strength of a material refers to its ability to bear load either in tension or in compression, without breaking or defonning. 
Evidence of the use of C. elastica latex in ancient Mesoamerica predicates the development of the rubber processing regime we describe in Hosler et al. (1999), and in Tarkanian (2000 and 2003). The sixteenth-century documents, nineteenth-century ethnographic data, and other sources that have enabled us to decipher ancient Mesoamerican rub­ber processing regimes also suggest that ancient Mesoamericans were able to engineer C. elastica, the optimal source of latex available to them, for the applications we investigate here.As those pub­lications demonstrate, Mesoamerican peoples did so by mixing the latex of C. elastica with juice from lpomoea alba vines. J. alba is a white-flowered species of morning glory vine that flourishes throughout the Americas, commonly known as "moon-vine." 
In Historia de los indios de la Nueva Espana, Fray Toribio de Benavente (Motolinfa) established the case for an Aztec rubber-processing technol­ogy when he recalled some of the first European encounters with rubber: 
... ulli, que es una goma de un arbol que se cria en tierra calien te, de! cual punzando le salen unas gotas blancas, y ayuntanlo uno con otro, que es cosa que luego se cuaja y para negro, casi como pez blanda; y de es te hacen las pelotas con que juegan los indios , que saltan masque las pelotas de viento de Castilla, y son de! mismo tamafio, y un poco mas prietas; aunque son mucho mas pesadas. Las de esta tierra, corren y sal tan tanto que parece que traen azogue dentro de sf (Benavente 1984: 35). 
Motolinfa's commentary provides evidence, sub­stantiated by our laboratory studies and archaeo­
logical data, that latex was indeed processed by ancient Mesoamerican peoples to make rubber that was used for balls. Our ethnographic and labora­tory work show that pure unprocessed latex does not "se cuaja" (coagulate) nor does it tum black, as does the material described in Motolinfa's account. When untreated, a sample of C. elastica latex less than 1 cm thick takes several days to solidify fully. Solid, dried C. elastica latex is a rich brown color, not black as Motolinfa describes. By contrast, C. elastica latex, when processed with 1. alba juice, coagulates quickly and transfonns from a milky white latex into black rubber. Motolinfa witnessed the processing of rubber. Maya pottery and art related to the ballgame frequently depict balls distinctly black in color. Rubber balls are also portrayed as black in the Codex Mendoza (Berdan and Anawalt 1997: Folio 46R). 
As a footnote to our discussion of rubber pro­cessing, Motolinfa's comments also illustrate the European reaction to seeing rubber for the first time. In the sixteenth century, rubber-bearing trees such as C. elastica and Hevea brasiliensis were unique to the Americas, as were the material properties of the latex and rubbers borne of these trees. Elastic­ity, which is particularly apparent in a bouncing rubber ball, was not a property common to the mate­rial inventory of Europe. Materials with elastic prop­erties were not prevalent outside of the Americas. It is not surprising, therefore, that Motolinfa was only able to offer unusual, sensory descriptions of rubber -"soft like tar" and "like quicksilver" when comparing the properties of American rubber balls to the less "bouncy" stuffed hide or inflated blad­der balls of sixteenth-century Europe. He may not have been equipped with the proper vocabulary to describe such a material. To this day, the Spanish word for rubber remains hule, adopted from the Nahuatl ulli or olli (Corominas 1954). 
While Motolinfa describes the behavior of processed rubber, Pedro Martir de Anglerfa pro­vides insight into the process itself. As an official royal chronicler for the court of Spain's Charles V (1500-1558 AD), Martir compiled De Orbe Novo Decades (Martir 1989) and Opus Epistolarum (Anghiera 1966). These volumes contain collec­tions of his letters communicating observations of Mesoamerican life. Regarding rubber, Martir writes: 
Estas [pelotas] se hacen de! jugo de cierta 
hierba que trepa por los arboles como el lupulo

por los setos; cuecese dicho ju go, que al hervir se endurece, y convertido en masa, se le da la forma apetecida; otros dicen que fabricadas de las rafces de dichas hierbas son pesadas; pero no comprendo c6mo al chocar en el suelo se lanzan al aire, con increfble salto [Martir 1989:II:547; emphasis added]. 
Martir's observations reiterate the astonishment of the Spaniards at the elastic properties of rubber. Martir makes no reference to latex, but he is clear that rubber processing included boiling the juice of a certain vine. This information allowed Paul C. Standley, a botanist from the Field Museum of Nat­ural History in Chicago, to identify this vine as a species of morning glory (S tandley 1942). Stand­ley was familiar with the use of morning glory in early twentieth-century Mesoamerican rubber pro­cessing and published the following, along with his interpretation of Martir' s quote: 
After Castilla sap is collected, various sub­stances often are added to it to make the rub­ber coagulate. The usual one is the juice of certain morning-glories (lpomoea), or espe­cially the juice of the moon-vine (Calonyc­tion). In [Martir's] account of rubber preparation doubtless these vines were men­tioned and someone misunderstanding ­probably through faulty knowledge of the Nahuatl language -got the idea that it was the vine that really furnished the rubber [Stan­dley 1942:123; emphasis in original]. 
It should be noted that "moon-vine," Calonyction aculeatum, andlpomoea bona-nox are all synonyms for Ipomoea alba, the proper species name for this white-flowered vine (van Ooststroom 1940). 
Use of the Castilla elastica-Ipomoea alba mix­ture for processing rubber is further substantiated by an article published in Science in 1943. This study, conducted within the United States Depart­ment of Agriculture, was likely carried out in an attempt to find an alternative source of rubber dur­ing World War II. It states that "for many years, a 
juice prepared by natives of Central America from the moonvine of Nacta vine (Calonyction aculea­tum formerly Ipomoea bona-nox) has been used to coagulate the latex tapped from the Castilla tree" (Wildman et al. 1943:471). 
Ethnographic studies we carried out from 1997 to 2002 at Rancho Parafso in Zacualpa, Chiapas, Mexico (Hosler et al. 1999, Tarkanian 2000, 2003; Tarkanian and Hosler 2001) revealed that modem huleros were also familiar with the C. elastica-1. alba process and had used it more than 40 years ago, as children , to fashion rubber balls for play. They use juice only from the vine of the /. alba plant, removing the leaves and flowers before use. At Rancho Parafso, wild Ipomoea alba vines grow in close proximity to Castilla elastica trees. This facilitates the gathering of the raw materials and the processing of rubber on-site. 

Rubber Performance and 
Mechanical Properties 

The juice of Ipomoea alba vines transforms the properties of C. elastica latex through a two-part process: (I) by removing proteins that encase the latex and inhibit elastic behavior; and (2) by creat­ing cross-links in the latex/rubber that increase elas­ticity (Hosler et al. 1999: 1990). Cross-linking is a chemical process that can alter elasticity, strength, and other mechanical properties of polymers. 
We carried out a battery of mechanical analy­ses to quantify the range of mechanical properties of rubber and the applications of rubber made pos­sible by processing Castilla elastica latex with varying amounts of lpomoea alba juice. The analy­ses show that rubber made through this process can have a wide range of properties, varying in terms of elasticity, damping ability, wear resistance, strength and other properties depending on the con­centration of I. alba used in the mixture. 
Mechanical properties describe the way a mate­rial responds to specific forces or actions, and include hardness, toughness (a material's inherent capacity to resist brittle fracture), tensile strength, and others. "Elasticity" refers to the amount of "bounce" in a rubber ball. "Damping" is the ability of a material to absorb energy, such as a shock absorber in a car's suspension. "Wear resistance" quantifies ruhber's capacity to resist "grinding down" when subjected to an abrasive surface, as shoe soles wear down over their lifetime of walk­ing. "Strength" defines the maximum load that a material can withstand before breaking or plastically deforming. Plastic deformation is irreversible defor­mation: under an applied load the material stretches and cannot recover this strain, as when a paperclip is bent and does not return to its original shape.

The functional success of each of the three ancient Mesoamerican applications of rubber that are the focus of this paper-rubber balls, joining applications, and sandals-require markedly dif­ferent mechanical properties. A material for adhe­sives or hafting bands would be chosen to maximize the strength and shock-absorbing abilities required for functional success. A specific ratio of the C. elastica to/. alba mixture produces rubber soles for sandals that are specifically designed to resist wear and fatigue. According to archaeological data and sixteenth-century Spanish documents, rubber balls fabricated through several unique methods (Cog­
. gins and Ladd 1992; Filloy Nadal 2001a; Hosler et 
· 
al. 1999; Tarkanian 2000, 2003; Tarkanian and 
Hosler 2001) can be processed selectively for max­

imum elasticity or "bounce" (Tarkanian 2003). 
Ancient Mesoamericans were able to process 

rubber selectively to maximize the elasticity or 
"bounce" of rubber balls for use in the Mesoamer­
ican ballgame. Our laboratory results also suggest 
that the technology was adaptable to making adhe­
sives or bands that possessed high strength for haft­
ing and joining applications, while offering superior 
damping properties to reduce the shock of impact. 
Our mechanical tests indicate that by using a spe­cific ratio of latex to morning glory, the effective life of rubber sandals can be greatly extended through improved fatigue and wear properties. 

Rubber in the Ballgame 
Rubber made with 50 percent/. alba and 50 per­cent C. elastica, by volume, is the ideal combina­tion for rubber balls, which require maximum elasticity and bounce. This specific blend produces rubber with greater elasticity than mixtures with a higher or lower concentration of I. alba. Figure 3 illustrates the stress versus strain curves-or ten­sile properties-obtained for samples of latex (0 percentI. alba) we prepared and tested, and for rub­bers made by adding 25 percent, 33 percent, 40 per­cent, 50 percent; 60 percent, and 70 percent I. alba 
juice, by volume, to the latex. 
These tensile test data quantify the behavior of a material that is undergoing uniaxial elongation, and the results can be correlated directly to the strength and elasticity of the material. Strain is defined as the ratio of the change in length of a sam­ple as it is stretched to its original length. Strain refers to the response of a material under stress, in

this case, the tensile stress applied by an instrument that pulls on and elongates the latex or rubber sam­ples. Stress is calculated by measuring the force the material exerts against the direction of strain, divided by the material's cross sectional area. 
It is immediately evident in Figure 3 that there is a marked difference between the tensile proper­ties of C. elastica latex and the response of all of the rubbers to tensile forces. C. elastica latex is a stiff, "non-rubbery" material, and thus exhibits much higher stress and stress rates (the change in stress versus strain) than any of the rubbers. In the case of the 33-70 percent I. alba samples, the addi­tion of morning glory juice softens the samples, transforming the latex into a typical rubbery mate­rial. The behavior of the unprocessed C. elastica­it is stiff and prone to deformation under stress-makes it a poor material for use in sandals or rubber balls, where flexibility and elasticity are essential. 

We can further differentiate the mechanical properties of the tested rubber and latex by exam­ining a portion of the stress-strain data known as "initial modulus" or "elastic modulus." The elas­tic modulus directly relates to elasticity in rubbery 
materials. As in the bulk stress-strain data shown in Figure 3, Figure 4 shows that the addition of morning glory juice substantially lowers the value of the elastic modulus, transforming unprocessed (0 percent/. alba) C. elastica latex -which is hard and stiff -into a softer, rubbery material more suit­able for use in balls, sandals, and other rubber items. These data also show that among the rub­ber samples the 50 percent I. alba by volume rub­ber has an appreciably higher value of elastic modulus than the others. This means that this rub­ber is correspondingly more elastic than its coun­terparts . Accordingly, a I to I ratio of I. alba juice to C. elastica latex by volume would be the ideal mixture for making rubber balls, because it max­imizes elasticity or "bounce." Any other mixture produces a less elastic rubber that would be infe­rior for balls. 
Joining Applications: Adhesives and Hafting Bands 

Rubber made with 50 percent I. alba maximizes elasticity for balls, but the material for optimized joining ability requires a different set of properties: strength and damping ability. For this reason.

Construction Methods for 
Mesoamerican Rubber Objects 

Analyzing the mechanical properties of materials incorporated into an object can help to predict per­formance and efficiency, but construction methods and design also play a crucial role in the perfor­mance of the finished goods. We are able to com­bine a variety of archaeologically known construction methods with mechanical data on C. elastica-1. alba rubber to form a substantially com­plete picture of the performance of ancient Mesoamerican rubber balls. Unfortunately, we do not have a complete data set for the construction methods of hafting bands or rubber sandal soles, so we cannot examine these items as thoroughly. 
The preceding mechanical data show that rub­ber made with 50 percent morning glory juice by volume would produce a ball with the maximum elasticity possible via the C. elastica-1. alba process. Nonetheless, archaeological evidence exists for a wide variety of construction methods used to fabricate ancient rubber balls. The con­struction methods of a ball markedly affect its mechanical properties, such as its elasticity. The sixteenth-century Spanish sources discussed ear­lier indicate that ancient balls were made by shap­ing a solid mass of rubber. Historical accounts , ethnographic studies, and archaeological data pro­vide evidence for at least three other construction methods: balls built up with extremely thin rubber layers (Kelly 1943; Rochin 1986); balls rolled in a "spiral" fashion from one or several thick sheets of rubber (Filloy Nadal 2001a); and balls constructed from wound rubber strands (Coggins and Ladd 1992; Tarkanian 2000, 2003). 
Solid rubber balls were made shaped from a singular lump of rubber made by mixing latex with morning glory juice. Martir (1989: 11:5 47) writes

that when making balls, the rubber "se endurece, y convertido en masa, se le da la forma apetecida". Similarly, Fernandez de Oviedo (1959:1:145) recounts that mixing with the juice of roots and herbs creates "una pasta; e redondeanla e hacen la pelota tamafia como una de las de viento en Espafia". These descriptions mirror precisely the ball-making process we observed at Rancho Para{so in Chiapas (Tarkanian and Hosler 2001). There, rubber balls were made by mixing latex col­lected from C. elastica trees with juice squeezed directly from crushed/. alba vines.Approximately 10 minutes after mixing the two liquids, the latex coagulated into a solid mass of rubber. This rubber is extremely pliable and able to be shaped as desired. Within minutes, however, the rubber sets into place and its shape cannot be altered. This process significantly reduces the labor required to make a ball compared with the other construction methods. The balls made with this method are 
formed as a seamless mass, without any specific 
areas prone to breakage or fatigue. 
Photographs of several solid rubber balls, likely made using this technique, can be found in Figure 8. These balls were excavated from Man­atf, Veracruz in the early 1990s (Ortiz et al. 1997). Material found in conjunction with the rubber balls was radiocarbon dated to the First through Third Phases ofManatf, ranging from 1600 B.C. to 1200 B.C. (Ortiz and Rodriguez 1994).As Fig­ure 8 makes clear, the diameters of the balls from 
Manatf vary greatly. 
Modern ethnographic data reveal a second style of ball construction. This method requires layering extremely thin sheets of rubber until the ball reaches the desired size. Roberto Rochfn's film Ulama (Rochin 1986) documents this process in Sinaloa. There, latex from the plant known as aguama (Brome Lia pinguin) is mixed with slices of the root of machacuana (lpomoea rhodocalyx). Like/.

alba, machacuana is also a white-flowering plant from the lpomoea genus. This mixture is then heated in bowls in an aqueous solution. After mix­ing, small amounts of rubber harden in the bowls. They are flattened and layered so as to form a ball. Balls can attain 4 kg in weight using this method (Rochfn 1986). 
In Notes on Middle American Archaeology and Ethnology (Kelly 1943), Isabel Kelly describes a process witnessed in Nayarit that is almost identi­cal to that depi cted in Ulama. Kelly writes: 
The ball was thus built up, layer by layer, as small quantities of rubber were added to the pellet-like nucleus [also rubber]. After each increment of rubber was squeezed free of the liquid, the ball was shaped on a flat board held slanting against the knees to let the liquid run off...When perfectly round, the finished ball was smoothed and polished with a stick." [Kelly 1943: 164, emphasis in original] 
The method described by Kelly also requires the use of /. rhodocalyx. Kelly (1943:164) writes that "to coagulate the latex, the root of the machaquana was diced and added to water." This method, like that depi cted in the film Ulama, is much more labor-intensive than making a ball from a solid mass of rubber. In Ulama, the ballmaker constructs a 4 kg ball in a time-intensive process that occurs over the course of an entire day. In Chiapas, the ballmakers can produce a ball of equivalent size, from a single mass of rubber, in half an hour. 
The layered construction may also produce a ball that is more prone to breakdown than the Chi­apas-style balls, since it relies on cohesive bonds between the rubber-to-rubber layers. Immediately after coagulation, rubber is in its pliable state and able to form an inseparable bond with rubber in a similar state (or with itself). Once the rubber hard­ens and can no longer be shaped, it also loses the ability to bond, and is no longer tacky. Loss of bond within the layers of a ball develops over time or can result from faulty construction. These circum­stances would create a discontinuity in the elastic behavior of a ball, thus decreasing its ability to bounce. They would also produce a ball that could fail catastrophically in play. 
The third construction method consists of rolling thick sheets of rubber into a spiral shape, forming the sheets into balls, a method revealed by Filloy's Helical Computer Tomography (Helical CT) scans of balls recovered from excavations at Tenochtit­lan (Filloy Nadal 2001a). Late Classic and Post­classic Maya codices and art substantiate the case for ball construction with rolled sheets of rubber. During these time periods, rubber balls were often depicted as "tight black spirals" (Stone 2002:24). These balls were likely only used as offerings and not meant for use in the ballgame (Filloy Nadal 2001b). They contain deep grooves cut into their surfaces meant to hold feathers, as was typical for ceremonial balls (Filloy Nadal 2001a). 
Rubber ball construction using the "spiral" method identified by Filloy Nadal exhibits some similarities to the method described by Kelly ( 1943) and Rochin (1986) in modern Sinoloa and Nayarit. At the same time, the spiral method uses much thicker "layers" of rubber, perhaps even a single thick sheet. Using this construction method, the "spiral" balls would be subject to the same mechan­ical shortcomings as the "layered" balls. In the "spi­ral" balls, the likely absence of strong coherent bonding between the layers of rubber would lead, under stress, to mechanical failure and deadening of elastic behavior. However, since spiral-con­structed balls were apparently produced for cere­monial use, mechanical rigor would not have been a priority. 
Other rubber ball construction methods are evi­dent in a single incensario housed at Harvard Uni­versity's Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology as part of a collection of materials recov­ered from El Cenote de los Sacrificios at Chichen Itza, Yucatan, Mexico. El Cenote, which is rich in sacrificial offerings, served as a major ceremonial center for the postclassic Maya. The incensario, reproduced in Figure 9, is composed of a clay tri­pod bowl filled with copal and 13 small rubber balls likely used as "wicks" to aid in the burning of the copal (Coggins and Ladd 1992:348). This artifact represents a rather simple application of rubber. Our macroscopic examination of the 13 balls revealed four other construction methods. 
Five balls were made by winding thin bands of rubber around a copal core. Two balls were made by wrapping rubber bands into a ball, as one would wrap a ball of yarn. Three balls are of solid rubber, and two appear to be rubber-dipped copal. These rubber-dipped copal balls were apparently made by dipping a co pal core into liquid latex. No seams are

In both of these dipping applications it is likely that unprocessed latex was used, as a mixture oflatex and/. alba could be used for dipping only within the few minutes prior to solidification. Unprocessed latex will remain in its liquid form for days; a hardened "skin" forms on the surface when exposed to air. 
Organization, Production and 
Transport of Rubber Tribute Items 

The finding that rubber was prepared in numerous forms in ancient Mesoamerica is substantiated by accounts in sixteenth-century documents . The Codex Mendoza (Berdan and Anawalt 1997) and Informaci6n de 1554: sabre los tributos que los indios pagaban a Moctezuma (Rojas 1997), pre­sent data about the location of rubber sources, the form in which the rubber was transported, and the amounts of rubber paid in tribute. These documents provide insight into the infrastructure of the ancient Mesoamerican rubber "industry" and its produc­tion techniques. 
lnformaci6n de 1554 compiles information gathered through Spaniard-led interviews of six elder Aztec noblemen conducted in 1554. In this text, the Spaniards reconstructed a record of the tribute paid by 38 provinces to the Aztec capital. These interviews were aided by the presence of extant pictorial tribute records. Each of the Aztec noblemen recalled that 2,000 "panes de hule" (rub­ber cakes) were delivered on a yearly basis from the provinces of Tlapa, in west Mexico, and Tochitepeque, on the Gulf Coast (Figure 10). Co­tlastla, directly north of Tochitepeque, paid 2,000 panes de hule every 80 days and 400 estatuas de hombre de hule (rubber figurines) yearly. The large differences in the volume of rubber tribute paid by Cotlastla, Tlapa, and Tochitepeque suggests that Cotlastla was able to produce substantially greater volumes of latex and rubber, either through a dis­tinct advantage in labor force , production tech­niques, greater density of Castilla elastica trees, or other factors. 
Codex Mendoza (Berdan and Anawalt 1992), which details the tributes paid by various provinces to the Aztec capital, provides evidence for the trans­port of finished rubber goods from latex-bearing areas. In the case of the Tochtepec (called Tochite-

peque in 1nformaci6n de 1554) province, on the Gulf coast of modem Mexico, 16,000 rubber balls were paid as annual tribute (Berdan and Anawalt 1992:116). The 16,000 balls are depicted as two rubber balls, each on top of an incense bag. The bags are symbols for the value 8,000 (Berdan and Anawalt 1992: Folio 46R). 
Andrea J. Stone addresses the logistics of ship­ping of rubber balls in her article on the iconogra­phy of rubber balls in Mesoamerican art (Stone 2002) . Stone argues that individual balls may have been shipped while bound with ropes, as commonly depicted throughout Mesoamerican art. This would prevent balls from sticking to each other during shipping to Tenochtitlan. Sticking would be less of an issue for rubber processed with 1. alba, as processed rubber loses its inherent tackiness. Stone also argues that the balls were lashed with rope to prevent sagging in the ambient heat of the envi­ronment. Rubber from natural sources (i.e., not synthetic) will not readily deform or "sag" at tem­peratures around 100° F, but Castilla elastica rub­ber and latex are amorphous and will "flow" extremely slowly at ambient temperatures and above. This is often referred to as "cold flow." On a time scale of days,rubber balls made with C. elas­tica will develop flat spots due to cold flow if left on a flat surface. Flat spots on a ball would pre­clude it from effective use in the ballgame, as the direction of bounce would become unpredictable. If suspended with ropes, as Stone (2002) illustrates with examples from codices, a ball would remain roughly spherical, without flat spots, for longer periods of time and become distorted only around the bound areas. The areas distorted by the ropes would not have as great an effect on bounce as flat spots have, as the "rope marks" would be recessed from the still-spherical surface of the ball. Balls were likely bound with rope for storage purposes, to prevent flat spots due to "cold flow" of the amor­phous rubber balls. 
Tribute data are exceptionally useful in gaining insight into the labor, resources, and production technology necessary to satisfy the demand for rub­ber in ancient Mesoamerica. 1nformaci6n de 1554 suggests that over 11,000 "rubber cakes" were shipped yearly from Tlapa, Tochitepeque and Co­tlastla. Rubber cakes can be made by one of two methods: ( 1) by processing liquid latex with morn­ing glory juice and shaping the coagulated rubber into the desired form; or (2) allowing unprocessed 
C. elastica latex to dry in a cake-shaped mold. The first method presents distinct advantages with respect to time: cakes processed with 1. alba juice could be ready for shipment in a matter of hours. Unprocessed latex dries extremely slowly. A cake of substantial size would take weeks to solidify fully, greatly extending the delivery schedule of

these materials. The 16,000 balls due annually also could have been made using any of the methods described previously. If we assume a skilled ball­maker can make a ball by layering in four hours , this translates into 64,000 work-hours for the pro­duction of the yearly quota of balls. Making balls out of a solid mass from I. alba-coagulated C. elas­tica at 30 minutes per ball would require only 8 ,000 work hours, a substantial reduction in time. 
The processing choices made in the latex-bear­ing regions of lowland Mesoamerica would also determine the use of the latex or rubber when the products reached the Aztec capital or other centers. If the cakes were made of dried, unprocessed latex, they would be useful only in applications that were not mechanically intensive, such as for sacrificial offerings or wicks for incense burners, as described by Coggins and Ladd (1992) . Conversely, if the cakes were made of rubber processed with I. alba juice, the material could be used in more mechan­ically demanding applications. However, the use of rubber that arrived as cakes would be constrained by the already solidified form. Any application made from caked rubber would have to be cut (or sculpted) from the original cake. This would exclude rubber balls, which could not be reformed after the I. alba-C. elastica mixture has solidified. Rubber for balls would have to be processed into shape on-site. Shipping cakes of processed rubber would, therefore, have been an inefficient use of latex, morning glory, and shipping infrastructure. It is far more likely that the "rubber cakes" detailed by Informaci6n de 1554 were actually unprocessed cakes of latex used for copal burning and other rit­ual activities. 
These data from sixteenth-century sources make clear that tribute was paid to the Aztec in both processed rubber form and as dried unprocessed latex. The surveys conducted in lnformaci6n de 1554 document that the latex-bearing provinces within the empire sent rubber and latex to the cap­ital in the form of"cakes" and figurines. The Codex Mendoza refers to payment in the form of balls. Given the data concerning processing presented here, it seems clear that a large portion of rubber processing occurred on-site where the latex was collected. The materials for use in rubber balls and figurines, which required processing to develop the necessary mechanical properties (or in the case of the figurines the necessary plasticity and forma­bility), would have been processed on-site and then shipped out. The other option -to ship the volume of liquid latex and morning glory necessary to sup­ply the demand for rubber balls-would have been difficult logistically. It is likely, nonetheless, that small amounts of liquid latex were shipped from the latex-bearing regions for use as paint and as a waterproofing agent. 
Conclusions 
The combination of the mechanical properties data presented here and the ethnohistoric evidence from codices regarding the shipment of C. elastica in both latex and rubber form suggests that ancient Mesoamericans had developed the C. elastica-1. alba processing regime sufficiently to produce rub­ber and latex with mechanical properties tailored to specific applications. Simply by adjusting the ratios of latex to morning glory juice, they could optimize specific mechanical properties. In balls, where elasticity is essential, adding 50 percent I. alba juice by volume to latex is ideal . According to the archaeological evidence, these balls were made from solid masses of rubber, or by building up layers of rubber into a sphere, or by winding rubber sheets or strips. For joining applications. unprocessed C. elastica latex provides optimal per­formance with maximum strength and shock absorbing ability. For sandals, rubber made with 25 percent I. alba juice gives the wearer double the walking distance of sandals made from the next best material. 
The rubber or latex required for these applica­tions had to be processed at the Castilla elastica collection locations, such as Cotlastla, Tlapa, and Tochtepec, and distributed throughout Mesoamer­ica. Latex for non-mechanically intensive applica­tions such as offerings or wicks could be dried on-site in cakes or panes in preparation for ship­ping. Likewise, balls and sandals, which required enhanced mechanical properties for optimal per­formance, would have been made in the rubber producing regions and then shipped. Small amounts of liquid latex may have been moved for paints or waterproofing and for assembling tools with par­tially dried latex hafting bands. The broad distrib­ution and temporal depth of ball courts throughout Mesoamerica provides clear evidence of a long­term, high-volume demand for rubber. The cir-

cumstances created by this demand for rubber jux­taposed with the localized availability of Castilla elastica in the Gulf Coast and Pacific lowlands, must have given rise to a complex rubber produc­tion and distribution system based in the rubber­bearing regions. 
It has long been known that ancient Mesoamer­icans were master architects, mathematicians, civil and mechanical engineers, and metallurgists. The data presented here, together with our prior dis­covery that rubber processing was pioneered in Mesoamerica some 3 ,500 years before Charles Goodyear invented his process of vulcanization in the United States, show us that the inhabitants of ancient Mesoamerica were also chemical engi­neers. Over time, the technology was perfected to produce rubber with specific mechanical proper­ties through chemical manipulation. This makes the Olmec, and the peoples that followed them, the Americas' earliest polymer scientists.
