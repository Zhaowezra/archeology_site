
PEOPLE WITH CLOTH: MESOAMERICAN ECONOMIC CHANGE FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF COTTON IN SOUTH-CENTRAL VERACRUZ 
Barbara L. Stark, Lynette Heller, and Michael A. Ohnersorgen 
We examine the ways that textile production, exchange, and consumption were integrated into the political economy of the Gulf lowlands, Mexico, over the course of two millennia. Archaeological, botanical, and historical data concerning cotton textile production reveal that changes in the industry resulted from alterations in the cotton plant, shifts in the local political economy, and changes in the relationship of the Gulf lowlands to other key regions of Mesoamerica. Initially, textiles did not 
figure prominently in social displays, and there is little archaeological evidence for spinning of cotton thread. Subsequently, textile production may have been stimulated by elite substitution of locally crafted items for increasingly scarce exotic imports toward the end of Olmec times in the Preclassic period. The political and cultural stature of the Gulf lowlands increased dur­ing the Classic period in conjunction with a greater emphasis on cotton processing and use of textiles. During the Postclassic period, ruralization of once-key localities and possible conversion of the western lower Papaloapan Basin to a tributary sta­tus correlated with changes in the attributes of whorls and in representations of textiles. 
En este artfculo discutimos la manera en la que la producci6n, el intercambio y el consumo de textiles estuvieron integrados en la econom{a politfca de las tierras bajas de/ Golfo de Mexico durante dos milenios. Los datos arqueol6gicos, botanicos e hist6ricos relacionados con la producci6n de textiles de algod6n indican que los cambios en la industria textilfueron el resul­tado de (I) algunas alteraciones en la planta misma, (2) cambios en la econom(a po/(tica local, y ( 3) cambios en la relaci6n que debi6 existir entre las tierras bajas de/ Golfo y las otras regiones claves de Mesoamerica. En un principio, los textiles no parecen haber sido prominentes en los despliegues sociales, y hay poca evidencia arqueol6gica del hi/ado de algod6n. Posteriormente, la producci6n textil pudo haberse estimulado por la substituci6n de art(culos de fabricaci6n local sob re los materiales ex6ticos importados que ya habfan comenzado a ser escasos desde fines de la epoca olmeca en el horizonte Preclasico. Las tierras bajas de/ Golfo alcanzaron su papel poUtico y cultural mas eminente durante el horizonte Clasico, a la vez que tambien se observ6 un mayor enfasis en la producci6n de/ algod6n y en el empleo de textiles. Durante el horizonte Posclasico, la marginalizaci6n del area de la cuenca oeste de/ bajo Papaloapan, la cual hab(a sido antes un area clave, coin­cide con su posible conversion a una condici6n tributaria, y tambien con cambios en los atributos de los malacates y en las representaciones textiles.

cotton from the Basin of Mexico at Teotihuacan (Gonzalez 1982:464; McClung de Tapia 1979:139-140, 1987:72; Stromberg 1942) and Xico in the Clasic period indicates that some cot­ton reached this key region at a time when Veracruz production had become vigorous (King 1979:267). Therefore, cotton was an early eco­nomic plant for Mesoamerican peoples; the chal­lenge is to account for changes in its production, circulation, and use. 
The geography and ecology of cotton, along with its changing technology and relations of pro­duction, had long-term social and economic effects. "King cotton" in Mesoamerica was partly an artifact of technological change through selec­tion and partly an effect of changing social values concerning how cotton was used, both practically and symbolically. We suggest a diachronic process as follows. Initial efforts to elaborate tex­tiles may have been stimulated by elite substitu­tion of locally crafted sumptuary items for increasingly scarce exotic imports toward the end of the Preclassic period. Essentially the suggested stimulus falls within the "political model" described by Brumfiel and Earle (1987:3). Subsequently, increased lowland production of cotton textiles may have laid the basis for greater local social displays as well as exports. 
Large urban states in the highlands provided an internal framework permitting more special­ization and marketing during the Classic period, when cotton gained a greater role in interregional exchange and possibly tribute (Hall 1997). The decline of major Classic-period states likely stim­ulated marketing as a more independent institu­tion. Demand for cotton textiles in nonproducing highland regions later undermined the autonomy of producing regions, eventually leading to the Postclassic conditions of vigorous interregional marketing and imperial expansion that assured a tributary flow of textiles. Postclassic economies differed from earlier ones because they repre­sented increased production (more regions) and more market exchange and tribute of cotton. 
We argue for economic and social changes that go beyond the important factors identified in pres­tige economy interpretations for Mesoamerica that emphasize luxury products in long-distance exchange, key roles for attached specialists, and the assurance of clientage and interregional dependencies in a world-system framework (Blanton and Feinman 1984). Greater emphasis on cotton led to a diversification of uses of cotton textiles between the quotidian and sumptuary poles and to changes in land use and, probably, in landholdings and labor. Like Schneider (1978), we incorporate a substantial role for "luxury" products in regional and interregional economic and political transformations. It is still unclear whether (or how) other core-periphery relations link to textile economics. In fact, core-periphery relations, aside from imperial patterns, remain so imperfectly understood that we do not attempt to address that topic here. 
Our interpretation of the economic transforma­tions linked to cotton has some affinities with Kohl's (1988) multicore analysis of the eastern Mediterranean area in which he incorporates the effects of technological and economic shifts among regions. In part, our perspective on long­term economic change builds on general princi­ples concerning economic transitions, but it also reflects particular historical and technological cir­cumstances that profoundly affected the course of change in Mesoamerica. 
To establish a backdrop, we review the social roles of textiles in Mesoamerica. Next we con­sider environmental and technological factors that affected cotton production in the Veracruz low­lands to show that cotton growing was quite fea­sible, even if conditions were not optimal. Optimal conditions are usually created by irriga­tion in hot, dry climates. We rely on historic data to establish geographic patterns of cotton produc­tion in Veracruz. At the time of Spanish contact Veracruz cotton production and textile manufac­ture had a striking role in interregional economic relations. Later historical records clarify the tech­nology of cotton production and the critical role of a labor force. Historical data also help structure archaeological analyses by revealing "wild silk" and agave fiber production in the Gulf lowlands, in addition to cotton. 
The primary archaeological data for tracing the cotton industry archaeologically are durable tools of production. Ceramic whorls or weights used on the spindle during the spinning of thread are the most commonly preserved implements related to cotton processing, although many bone tools, such as needles, likely were used in textile

production. Cordage or coarse fiber processing must be distinguished from cotton spinning on the basis of whorl dimensions to isolate and monitor the cotton industry. 
The best diachronic archaeological data con­cerning the lowland Veracruz cotton industry derive from the Mixtequilla; we draw particularly on the Proyecto Arqueol6gico La Mixtequilla (PALM). PALM data indicate the inception of a vigorous cotton industry in the Early Classic period (AD. 300-600) and probably beginning in the Terminal Preclassic period (100 B.C.-A.D. 300). South-central Veracruz was among the first regions of Mesoamerica to exhibit substantial evi­dence of cotton spinning. Imagery from figurines and stone sculpture in the trans-Isthmian low­lands provides independent information about the elaboration of garments, presumably of cotton, as well as related feathered regalia. We link changes in the Mixtequilla textile industry to changes in Mesoamerica that culminated in the pervasive trade and tribute of raw cotton and cotton textiles at the time of the Spanish conquest. 
In the last section of the paper, we place cotton in a diachronic perspective with other products that were prominent in interregional exchange. We argue that cotton had a dynamic role through­out Mesoamerican history because it could at once become more widespread in access and still be elaborated as a prestige item. Some regions never could become cotton producers, and steady or growing demand coupled with unequal produc­tion continually stimulated interregional trade and tribute and may have been a factor in patterns of imperial expansion by highland capitals. 
Technological and Social Roles of Textiles 
Comparative research shows that textiles and related materials such as dyes often play key roles in regional and interregional social, economic, and political relations (Schneider 1978, 1987). Because of their labor investment, utility, and expressive properties, textiles are often selected cross-culturally for social prestations related to life-crisis rituals, rites of passage, and social negotiations (Schneider 1987). In Mesoamerica, cloth was not as pervasive in social prestations as in ancient Peru (Costin 1993; Murra 1962, 1989), but Anawalt (1981) describes the crucial role of particular garments for gender and ethnic identifi­cation and the differential ritual and social func­tions of clothing. The widespread Mesoamerican tradition of representing captives or defeated ene­mies nude or nearly so (Marcus 1974:90) reflects the crucial role of garments and personal adorn­ments in symbolizing the individual and his or her place in society. 
Cloth is particularly handy for social displays in complex societies because it can reflect differ­ential access through (1) amounts of textiles or denial of access, (2) their variety, elaborateness, or fineness, (3) their newness or wear, and (4) sumptuary restrictions tied to styles of textiles. Garments can serve relatively common social and functional utilities, such as indicating gender or age or providing sources of warmth and protec­tion. Yet they also can represent ethnicity, rank, class, or office, providing crucial signals in social interactions. Garments become emblematic of socially constituted personae. Items of personal wear are convenient as symbols in communica­tion because they are visible from a distance in the intermittent social contexts (Wobst 1977) that rise in frequency in urban settings compared to small communities. 
As Berdan (1987) indicates, cotton cloth had no pan-Mesoamerican rival as the most widely esteemed fabric. Maguey and yucca fiber, grown in a different ecological setting, had a different range of functional properties. Although soft cloth for garments could be produced from the inner leaves of maguey (Berdan 1987:245; Parsons and Parsons 1990: 178-179), agave cloth was not an important product in interregional exchange at the time of Spanish contact (Berdan 1987:248-249). The economic value of cotton cloth in Mesoamerica is indicated by its employ­ment at the time of European contact as one of a few widely accepted media of exchange or "proto-money" (along with cacao beans, for example). Cotton, like cacao, was subject to com­mercial chicanery, with concealment of lesser­grade cotton within finer-grade lint (Sahagun 
1950-1982, Book 10:75 [ca, 1578]). Raw cotton and cotton textiles were the most widely demanded materials for trade and tribute and entailed the most pervasive involvement of people in Aztec times (Berdan 1987:258-259). Textiles are more suited to interregional exchange than heavy, perishable foodstuffs, for example, in part

because of the value added by labor during pro­
duction (Drennan 1984). 
Cotton had many uses in Mesoamerica, and textiles were just one potential product. Cotton seeds were used medicinally (McClung de Tapia 1979: 140) and probably ground for oil (Lentz et al. 1996:255). Cotton lint could be employed for padding or bedding. The convoluted fibers of cot­ton lint are well adapted to spinning (Purseglove 1968:335), and cotton yarn could be made into knotted bags, lashing, or nets. Once woven into textiles, cotton had a new range of social utilities with few Mesoamerican rivals. Cotton textiles were used for a wide variety of soft, durable gar­ments and furnishings. Their light weight made them suitable to transport, and they were storable, with a moderate use life and a potential for recy­cling (e.g., used clothing, rags). Most importantly, textiles were greatly elaborated stylistically and technically through dyeing and weaving, includ­ing additions of feathers or fur and postweaving embroidery or painting (Carlsen and Wenger 
1991:371, 375). 
The social roles of cotton textiles were partly conditioned by their technology. Growing, pick­ing, ginning, carding, and spinning cotton repre­sent a substantial part of the labor in cotton textiles before mechanized technology (Wolf 1982:273-274). These steps plus dyeing and weaving (especially fancy weaving of fine cloths) form a labor intensive sequence that continually adds value. Apart from the weaver's development of appropriate experience, hand production with the Mesoamerican backstrap loom lacks the economies of scale that can be applied in several other Mesoamerican industries. Dyeing fibers is one exception because some economy of scale can be realized by treating a large batch of yarn. The labor in textiles is high but quite variable depending on their size, the elaborateness of the weaving, the thread count, and embroidery. Berdan (1987:241) remarks that late Mesoamerican textiles were primarily produced by women in a household context rather than in specialized workshops. This pattern is likely linked to (1) the high labor input, (2) the possibil­ity for interspersing textile work with other tasks, and (3) the lack of many economies of scale. Domestic production characterized the Mixte­quilla, also, as we show below. 
It is clear that cotton textiles had technological and social characteristics that lent them special significance in Mesoamerica. We now examine the geography and ecology of production along with historical data to underscore the suitability of the Gulf lowlands for production, after which we tum to archaeological data to construct a diachronic view of the cotton industry. 
Environmental and Agricultural Data Concerning Veracruz Cotton Production 
The environmental demands of cotton bear on why particular regions like Veracruz became prominent cotton producers. Growing conditions in Veracruz were advantageous; in parts of Veracruz the double cropping of cotton and foods, which was crucial to support a labor force, helps to explain the enduring role of cotton production before Spanish contact. We briefly examine rain­fall, seasonality, temperature, and soils in the Gulf lowlands with respect to cotton cultivation. Unfortunately, cotton plant parts are seldom pre­served archaeologically, and we have a spotty botanical record of cotton. Therefore, it is espe­cially valuable to analyze its requirements. 
The Mesoamerican domesticated cotton is gen­erally agreed to be Gossypium hirsutum L., but this species includes both annual and perennial races with different yields and ecological proper­ties (Purseglove 1968:333-364). At some time development of an annual race, laetif olium Hutch., permitted expansion of the range of cotton culti­vation because the annual could be grown in some seasonally cooler locales. An annual offers a bet­ter opportunity to control numerous cotton pests, such as boll worms (Purseglove 1968:357-359). It also can be grown in alternation with foods where double cropping is possible because of winter rainfall, soil humidity, or irrigation. 
The other cotton variety likely to have figured in Mesoamerica is punctatum (Schum.), a peren­nial small tree or shrub that produces for 5-6 years. (The ma rie-ga lante (Watt) Hutch. variety, distributed in northeastern South American and the Caribbean, is less likely to have been impor­tant in Mesoamerica.) Areas planted with tree cot­ton would not be available for food production for an extended period, but the grove, once estab­lished, would not demand the labor of annual planting. Cotton bolls recovered from Guila

Naquitz cave in Oaxaca, A.D. 700-1300, are described as similar to either la etif olium or pun c­ta tum, but with some different characteristics (Smith and Stephens 1971:163-165). Past culti­vars would have varied over time from the races recognized today. 
Where grown today with rainfall, cotton is found in regions with 1,016-1,524 mm of rain annually (Purseglove 1968:348). Garcia (1970:27) shows that much of lowland Veracruz receives 1,200-2,000 mm annually, with up to 2,500 mm in parts of southern Veracruz. In par­ticular, in south-central Veracruz the lower Papaloapan and Cotaxtla drainages range between 1,200-2,000 mm annually (Figure 1). Mesoamerican rainfall is strongly seasonal, and, in Veracruz, the rainy season is approximately June-October, followed by a dry season, as in other parts of the republic. Summer rains provide too much moisture for cotton in much of Veracruz, making it a winter crop. The Gulf low­lands are subject to winter nortes, cold North American fronts that cross the Gulf of Mexico bringing strong winds and sometimes rain that can damage bolls. Norte rains through December are more common in southern than central Veracruz (Garcia 1970:67-125), which typically receives only sustained strong winds.2 
Although colonial documents from Morelos suggest irrigated production up to 1,600 m (Maldonado 1990: 155), cotton today is mainly confined to elevations below 1,000 m (Purseglove 1968:347). Cotton requires about 200 frost-free days for the growing season (Purseglove 1968:347). Hotter, sunnier regions have an advan­tage for fruiting and boll production (Purseglove 1968:347). Germination is optimum at 94°F (34°C), and seedlings do best at 75-85°F (24-29°C) (Purseglove 1968:347)'; temperatures below 600F (15.5°C) adversely affect both germi­nation and seedlings. Temperatures in lowland Veracruz fall within a satisfactory range for cotton (Garcia 1970:13-23); most areas have a median annual temperature of 22-26°C. Some winter days in south-central and southern Veracruz (pre­sumably during nortes) can fall below the toler­ance of cotton for germination and early growth, with temperatures of 1O-l 2°C. However, the average minimum monthly temperature between 1921-1970 was 16-l8°C, indicating that most of 
the time cotton can be planted successfully. Both 
central and southern Veracruz have hotter temper­
ature extremes (both low and high) in most loca­
tions compared to northern Veracruz, which 
would make those two regions more favorable for 
cotton (Garcia 1970:19, 21). 
Cotton is tolerant of a broad range of soils (Purseglove 1968:348). We lack a detailed assess­ment of Veracruz soils with respect to cotton's requirements, but soils in the alluvial Veracruz plain display considerable variation in sand and clay. They have good fertility in most locations and, in riverine settings, are renewed by annual flooding. 
Postcontact accounts describe how cotton was grown in Veracruz and suggest cultivation was geared to an annual (Attolini 1949:217-218; Lazcano 1938:34; Ruz y Sandoval 1884: 134-137).4 Ethnohistoric evidence suggests Late Postclassic (A.D. 1350-1521) Veracruz cotton production also relied substantially on an annual race. Sahagun (1950-1982, Book 10:75 [ca. 1578]) mentioned five kinds of cotton in the Tlatelolco market. Irrigated cotton was the most prized in quality, presumably due to the control exercised on the amount and timing of humidity. Next was cotton from "hot-country," then cotton from the west, then cotton from desert lands to the north, and least in value was Totonac tree cotton, the perennial. Since tree cotton is distinguished from "hot-country" cotton, we infer that hot­country cotton was an annual, la etif olium.5 
In Veracruz, multicropping of annual cotton is particularly dependent on humid winter soils dur­ing the early growth period, on soils of high fer­tility that can sustain multiple crops, and on tapering off of summer rains. Multicropping would demand considerable labor to combat weeds, but the rainy-season food crops would help support a labor force. Labor also is needed for multiple handpickings (usually three to four) of ripe cotton bolls because the lint deteriorates and turns gray through exposure to heat and humidity (Brown and Ware 1958:190-191; Colwick and Williamson 1968:448; Purseglove 1968:356). Some diseases affecting cotton also stain lint. Sahagun (1950-1982, Book 10:75 [ca. 1578]) separately described market sales of yel­low, broken, and stretched cotton, which implies a concern for color and fiber quality.

In sum, the environmental characteristics in south-central and southern Veracruz facilitated winter cotton production, mainly of an annual cotton in historic times. Next, we provide more detail about localities of cotton production from historical records. Historic changes in cotton pro­duction highlight the impact of wider demand and the crucial role of labor. 
Historical Perspective on Cotton in Veracruz 
Ethnohistoric and historic records document the changing importance of Veracruz as a cotton pro­ducer. At the time of Spanish contact, Veracruz was a major cotton and textile producer,6 but dur­ing Colonial times cotton production declined.7 Production rebounded strongly during the nine­teenth century, only to wither in the twentieth century in the face of competition from irrigated production in regions relying on nonphotoperi­odic cotton (Chavez 1965:28).' The resurgence of cotton in the nineteenth century was tied to the international market that thrived following devel­opment of the cotton gin near the beginning of the nineteenth century, as well as the growing indus­trialization of textile manufacture. Prior to and during this cotton "boom," the locales of more persistent production and the extent of the crop can be mapped on the basis of the towns named as cotton producers. 
In 1803 cotton was mentioned for communi­ties in the lower Papaloapan Basin and in or near the Tuxtla Mountains (Tlalixcoyan, Tuxtla, Tlacotalpan, Alvarado, Cosamaloapan, and Acayucan [Florescano and Gil 1976:80, 81, 84, 86, 92, 96, 99]), but not for any communities in northern Veracruz (Figure 2).

towns were included in later production accounts. In the last half of the nineteenth century, Ruz y Sandoval (1884: 130-138) credited cotton produc­tion to Acayucan, Minatitlan, Tlacotalpan, Huatusco, Cordoba, Veracruz, Jalapa, Coatepec, Misantla, Chicontepec, Ozuluama (Ozulama), and Papantla, among other unnamed towns, but Cosamaloapan, Tuxtla, Tantoyuca, and Tuxpan yielded the greatest amount (Figure 2). The for­mer two big producers are in the Papaloapan drainage, and the latter two are in northern Veracruz. Over half a century later, Attolini (1949:217-218) added to the list of producing municipalities Tierra Blanca, Ignacio de la Llave, and Tesechoacan in the lower Papaloapan Basin and Tuxtepec (Oaxaca) in the upper basin. Presumably the higher-elevation towns drew on production from lower-elevation dependencies. 
Our review of the historic sources provides three key points: (1) there was an intimate link

between the scale of Veracruz cotton production 
and a wider market; (2) the Papaloapan Basin was 
a key cotton-growing region; and (3) a labor force 
was crucial, as indicated by mention of incidents 
when production declined due to depopulation or 
lack of labor (Florescano 1965:74; Florescano 
and Gil 1976:67). 
We argue that the same patterns characterized late Prehispanic times. The Gulf lowlands could sustain considerable cotton production because winter cotton could alternate with summer food crops that sustained a labor force. Considerable amounts of cotton were demanded by the Aztec in tribute (Barlow 1949:58-59, 89, 90-92, 95-96), especially decorated textiles from the lower Papaloapan Basin. In the Late Postclassic, cotton was king-the major Veracruz export (through trade and tribute) to other regions of Mesoamerica. What antecedent economic and cultural changes led to these conditions? One important factor has been mentioned: develop­ment of annual cotton undoubtedly improved pro­duction by reducing pests, allowing double cropping, and expanding the locales of production to include higher-elevation areas. The archaeolog­
ical record shows there was much more than selec­tive breeding at work, however. As we discuss below, the changing role of cotton was dependent on shifts in economic and political systems. 
Alternate Fibers to Cotton in Veracruz 
Consideration of archaeological remains requires attention to variation in fibers because spindle weights vary in size according to the fibers spun. To analyze cotton spinning archaeologically, we need to know what alternatives existed. We draw on historic records from the nineteenth century to highlight other fibers in some parts of the Gulf lowlands. Only one of the alternate fibers is stated to have been used for textiles-"wild silk"-but processing of the other fiber, presumably agave or yucca, for cordage could have left traces in the archaeological record in the form of large whorls. 
Communities in Veracruz in which wild silk was reported are Jalapa, Orizaba, Huatusco, and Zongolica (Chavez and Florescano 1965:205, 213, 222, 218), suggesting a cooler piedmont location (Figure 2).9 Many details of this fiber remain unclear, but it does not appear to have entered widely into textile production. Perhaps wild silk may have had certain properties that limited its utility as a fiber. 
Only for the Tuxtla dependency of Santo Tomas Apasapam is maguey cultivation men­tioned, specifically for Indian production of pulque, a fermented drink (Chavez and Florescano 1965: 132). Maguey is distinguished from another plant, ixtle, that also was grown in Tuxtla (Chavez and Florescano 1965:131-132). Large stands of ixtle (probably another agave) were reported in Tlalixcoyan and Acayucan as well (Chavez and Florescano 1965: 151-165), with Indians in the latter township exploiting it substantially. The streaky red, white, and green coloration of ixtle is similar to the succulent locally referred to as ca rd6n today and often grown along fence rows. Ixtle may be the same cordage plant mentioned for the earlier Ahualulcos province in southern Veracruz and Tabasco (Stark 1974:218). lxtle is described as thinner leaved and taller or longer leaved than the maguey from which cordage and pulque were widely known products; ixtle did not yield pulque but, instead, a soft cordage (Chavez and Florescano 1965: 169). Therefore, ixtle was dis­tributed mainly near the coast, perhaps along the well-drained, extensive, stabilized dunes. If this distribution is verified, ixtle had a complementary pattern with inland cotton-producing zones in the 
Gulf lowlands. 
The production of ixtle cordage is not described, but spinning may have required larger whorls than did cotton, although not necessarily the same sizes as those employed for maguey. It seems unlikely that wild silk would be in much demand on the coastal plain where cotton was pro­duced in quantity. In contrast, the use of ixtle for cordage could have been widespread and requires careful archaeological monitoring of lowland spinning implements to detect functional differ­ences, especially if different implements exhibit zonal patterns as implied by the documents. 
In the section below we discuss the functional interpretation of spindle whorls as a guide to cot­ton processing, using principles developed by Parsons ( 1972; Parsons and Parsons 1990). Her approach also detects whorls used for coarser fibers such as maguey or, perhaps, ixtle. As yet we cannot detect a clear archaeological "footprint" of the ixtle zonation described historically, but there

are some indications of whorls that may have spun coarser yam. Two "maguey-sized" whorls reported by Stark (1977:96) from Patarata 52 in the mangrove swamp (Figure 1) suggest cordage production, but one may have been a wheel (Stark 1977:Figure 27a). Among several hundred whorls from the Proyecto Arqueol6gico La Mixtequilla (PALM), one was maguey sized on the basis of Parsons's criteria (a hole diameter of 7 mm, whorl diameter of 46 mm, and interpolated weight of 
35.8 g). The rest of our paper concentrates on the other PALM whorls related to cotton. Future research should better document Prehispanic cordage production, as it is likely to have been another of the fiber specialties in the Gulf low­lands. 
Cotton Production and Feathered Regalia in 
Prehispanic Veracruz 

Overview of the PALM Data 
The PALM study region lies within the Mixtequilla and between the Pozas and Blanco Rivers, bounded on the east by the Limon estuary (Figures I and 2). The modern (and historic) town of Ignacio de la Llave, mentioned previously, is located in the study region. A 40-km2 central sur­vey block was examined through systematic field-by-field survey and surface collection (Figures I and 3). Formal architectural complexes mapped during the project include Cerro de las Mesas (Figure 3). Test excavations in low resi­dential mounds provided stratified contexts (Stark, ed. 1998). The domestic mounds all include a range of midden and fill deposits. Details concerning the residential excavations and survey can be obtained from other sources (Curet et al. 1994; Stark, ed. 1991, 1998; Stark and Curet 1994; Stark and Showalter 1990). 
PALM data provide a diachronic Prehispanic perspective on cotton spinning and weaving. For the study of textile-related artifacts, we use exca­vated residential contexts for the Late Preclassic (600-100 B.C.) and Classic (A.D. 300--900) peri­ods, with less-well-dated materials from the Terminal Preclassic period (100 B.C.-A.D. 300). Additionally, the archaeological survey provides a broader view of spinning remains, including the Postclassic period (A.D. 900--1521). Postclassic deposits were not the focus of PALM residential 
excavations, and we rely on analysis of surface 
collections to examine the Postclassic period. 
We summarize key points from Stark's (ed. 
1998) analyses of excavated (1) bone tools that 
probably were related to textile production and 
(2) ceramic, centrally perforated sherd disks and whorls that likely served as spindle weights. Small bowls were used in Morelos as spindle rests (Smith and Hirth 1988), but similar imple­ments have not been identified in the Mixtequilla.1° Clothing depicted on figurine frag­ments corroborates growth in the importance of textiles by the Classic period (Ethnic Arts Council of Los Angeles 1971; Goldstein 1987; Medellfn 1960; Stark, ed. 1998). Finally, we consider the evidence from a variety of imagery in the trans­Isthmian lowlands that adds information about related regalia, including what we infer were brightly colored tropical feathers that would, like cotton, have been unavailable naturally in high­land regions. 
We apply Parsons's (1972; Parsons and Parsons 1990) approach to discriminate the type of fiber spun through observations concerning whorl diam­eter, whorl weight, and hole diameter. One issue in tracking the history of cotton archaeologically is whether spinners used perishable or durable whorls. Centrally perforated sherd disks and spe­cially manufactured ceramic whorls are durable, but wooden or unfired clay disks are not consis­tently preserved. To partly circumvent this problem we have recourse to the general pattern of evi­dence, including bone tools and representational "art." For the Mixtequilla, the broader pattern of evidence is congruent with that from durable per­forated sherd disks and whorls. The pattern of evi­dence has not been addressed in other regions with the exception of Hendon's (1992) study of the Maya, but we see no basis yet to reject durable whorls as a reliable index of spinning. 
We can show that one factor intimately linked with the prosperity and social displays of Classic Mixtequilla was the growth of cotton and feather industries. The Terminal Preclassic through the Late Classic periods witnessed the remarkable elaboration of Classic Mixtequilla civilization (Stark 1993). Writing, calendrics, figurines, pot­tery, architecture, and sculpture reveal a distinc­tive variant of Mesoamerican civilization (Stark 1991, 1993).

In part, Classic-period textiles in south-central Veracruz were expressive of local social changes, but cotton production also may have fueled exports, as it is easy to imagine considerable demand in adjacent highland areas such as Oaxaca, Puebla, and the Basin of Mexico. The Mixtequilla was among the first regions in Mesoamerica to show an increase in fiber-pro­cessing tools, likely before cotton was a substan­tial product in some other areas where it later became important, such as Morelos in Epiclassic times (A.D. 700--900) (Smith and Hirth 1988). A precocious elaboration of cotton (and presumably textile) production began for local reasons in south-central Veracruz, perhaps as early as the Terminal Preclassic period, but then became important in a wider context, as we discuss below. 
By the Middle Postclassic period (A.D. 1200--1350), Classic Mixtequilla cultural patterns had collapsed or been dramatically altered (Curet et al. 1994). A major cultural reorientation occurred involving ruralization of the area and perhaps a tributary status. Part way through the Late Postclassic period (A.D. 1350-1521) the region likely became tributary to the Aztec Triple Alliance or to a tributary head town. In the fol­lowing sections we briefly summarize the archae­ological evidence from each major period in more detail. 
Late Prec lassic Period. During this period there is only equivocal, scant evidence of spin­ning and weaving in domestic contexts, but elite sculptural representations show apparent textiles. In the Late Preclassic period mounds 693 and 985 were part of what appears to have been a small village near Cerro de las Mesas (Figure 3). Textile-related artifacts were infrequent. Bone artifacts were scarce, comprising four worked bone shafts that cannot be tied to any particular function, such as weaving. Willey (1972:82-84; Large 1975) suggested that centrally perforated sherd disks (CPSDs) in Maya lowland sites func­tioned as spindle weights, although Hendon (1992:IO) views their size at Copan as related to a noncotton fiber. At Copan, CPSDs were in use contemporaneously with spherical whorls. Of six sherd disks at 693/985, only four are centrally perforated. None of the later excavated mounds yielded CPSDs, although unperforated examples occurred occasionally, possibly with a different function, such as stoppers or lids. There are no spindle whorls at 693/985 that were specially (i.e., originally) manufactured for spinning. 
The median diameter of CPSDs (43 mm) in PALM collections is considerably larger than that of Mixtequilla whorls (survey and excavation, 27 mm). Median weight (18.6 g) is more than three times that of all whorls (5.4 g). Median hole diameter (6 mm) is similar to that of whorls (5 mm), however. The weight and diameter mea­surements for CPSDs are greater than those Parsons ( 1972:62-64) suggested functioned effectively in light-fiber spinning, such as of cot­ton. Parsons's Type III (cotton) whorls fell mainly between 1.5-5.5 mm in hole diameter, up to about IO gin weight (with a few cases between IO and 20 g), and between 15-35 mm in total diameter. Importantly, the weights for PALM CPSDs are in the upper part of Parsons's range for cotton. As we note below, early whorls on the Pacific coast of Guatemala also are in the upper range for cotton. 
The median hole diameter and weight of CPSDs are not as great as the predominant values of whorls for spinning maguey fiber (Parsons 1972:62-64); the median disk diameter is close to the modal values for maguey whorls, however. Spinning is a likely function for CPSDs, but dif­ferent fibers, blended fibers, or greater thread size may have been involved than was typical for Postclassic cotton spinning in the Teotihuacan Valley as analyzed by Parsons (1972). 
Because even the CPSD are scarce at mounds 693/985, there is no reason to see spinning as more than an occasional household activity. The lack of definite textile-related bone tools at 693/985 supports the inference that textile pro­duction was not a frequent activity. However, 693/985 represents a small village and offers only a partial perspective about social and economic life. We also face the risk that whorls were in use but made from perishable materials. Imagery can provide an independent line of evidence concern­ing textiles. 
Imagery from the Late Preclassic period rein­forces the idea that textiles were not in wide­spread use as garments. Late Preclassic "Lower Remojadas" figurines typically depict nearly nude individuals, although often adorned with hair ornaments or headdresses, ear plugs, neck­laces, belts, or arm bands (Ethnic Arts Council of

Los Angeles 1971:43-47; Medellin 1960:42, 43, 
46). Therefore, we can detect no particular 
emphasis on textiles in social displays. This lack 
of depiction of textilelike garments is typical of 
earlier Preclassic figurines, as well. In the next 
section we discuss Late and Terminal Preclassic 
sculpture, which suggests more elaborate clothing 
for elites toward the end of this period. Because 
most of the sculpture is difficult to date very pre­
cisely for the Late vs. Terminal Preclassic peri­
ods, we discuss them together below. 
Terminal Preclassic Period. Terminal Pre­classic materials at mound 354 (Figure 3) reflect mixture with Classic-period remains, requiring careful analysis to determine whether any spin­ning evidence can be associated with the Terminal Preclassic period." There is one decorative vari­ant of whorls likely associated with the Terminal Preclassic period. Whorls decorated with a white slip or with a white slip and a chapopote (bitumen and resin [Belt 1971:39]) design comprise about 33 percent of the whorls at mound 354, a percent­age that far exceeds those for the Classic period at mounds 1126 and 1055/1056. At mound 1126, which is mainly Early Classic in date, only 12 percent of the whorls have these decorations, and there are none at 1055/1056, which is predomi­nantly Late Classic. Although there are only 15 whorls from mound 354, the higher incidence of white slips suggests a trait linked chronologically to the abundant Terminal Preclassic pottery there. We suggest that specially manufactured whorls had their inception in the Mixtequilla during the Terminal Preclassic period, perhaps near the beginning of the Early Classic period. 
Unfortunately, we cannot stylistically date the textile-related bone tools at mound 354. Two awls, a punch or batten, and a needle could relate either to the Terminal Preclassic or to the Classic period. We do not have figurine styles that can be unequivocally tied to the Terminal Preclassic period. Lower Remojadas figurines may still have been produced, but some early types of Upper Remojadas I figurines may have begun to succeed them. Some Upper Remojadas I figurines show skirts or multiple bands on the body, possibly rep­resenting cloth or rope bands, respectively (Medellin 1960:53, 67). Our best guess is that Terminal Preclassic figurines are transitional in respect to the depiction of garments, with textiles 
shown occasionally but to a much lesser extent 
than during the Classic period. 
Other imagery suggests that elaborate clothing 
and headdresses were produced in the lower 
Papaloapan Basin, but associated with elites. La 
Mojarra Stela 1 shows a richly clad figure accom­
panied by an inscription containing two dates, 
A.D. 143 and A.D. 156 (Winfield 1988:25). The garments worn are complex but may involve a kiltlike skirt and mantle. Feathers may be depicted in the headdress and mantle. The mantle is not unequivocally a textile, but neither is it clearly something else. The El Meson stela, which also may fall within the Terminal Preclassic period, to judge from stylistic traits, has a central figure with an elaborate feathered headdress (Covarrubias 1957:Figure 68). Thus, the La Mojarra stela is not unique in its elaborate garb. Textile clothing and towering headdresses may have been characteristic of rulers' garb, and feathers played an increasing role in their adorn­ment. 
Sculptural representations in the Terminal Preclassic period represent the end of a series of changes during the Preclassic period. Coe (1965:773) remarked that feathers are not typical in earlier Olmec monuments and became promi­nent only in Izapan times, i.e., the Late to Terminal Preclassic, but Taube (1996) argues that Gulf Olmecs sought quetzal feathers on the basis of depictions in Olmec art. Therefore, the change by the Late to Terminal Preclassic period may have been one involving the increased degree to which feathers figured prominently. 
The Early Preclassic Olmec sculptures from San Lorenzo show few possible textiles (Coe and Diehl 1980:299-374). The principal garments depicted on stone monuments are a wide belt, loincloth, or, rarely, a cape. Individuals sculpted at San Lorenzo, who seem to be of the highest social rank, are scantily clad. Towering head­
· 
dresses are not represented until the Middle Preclassic period at La Venta, for example on Stelae 1, 2, and 3 (Drucker 1952:174; Drucker et al. 1959:216-217; Stirling 1943:Plates 33, 35). Possible textile garments are more diverse at La Venta than at San Lorenzo. Stelae I, 2, and 3 show possible kilts, shirts, and cloaks. Stela 2 and Monument 19 from La Venta depict loincloths (Drucker 1952: 174; Drucker et al. 1959: 198,

Plate 49). In sum, in the Early Preclassic period few possible textiles are depicted. More elaborate garments are shown on monuments associated with the Middle Preclassic period at La Venta; textile clothing may have become a sumptuary appurtenance of elites by that time. By the Late or Terminal Preclassic period, sculptural representa­tions of what may have been textiles or feathered headdresses increased in some regions, e.g., at Izapa, Chiapas (Norman 1973), Tres Zapotes (Stirling 1943:Plate 14), and La Mojarra, Veracruz (Winfield 1988). 
Thus, the crucial steps in selection of a more productive cotton or in amplifying cotton cultiva­tion may have been responses initially to elite sumptuary demands and investments in weaving by attached specialists. Grove ( 1987 :440--441) points out that, as early as the Middle Preclassic period, Olmec elites may have encountered more competition from other polities for exotic materi­als. By the Late Preclassic period, Monte Alban, Cerro de las Mesas, Izapa, and other centers offered even more competition. Growing region­alization in Mesoamerica apparently interrupted earlier long-distance exchange networks, result­ing in a greater role for locally produced sumptu­ary items, such as textiles. If these inferences are correct, then the modest evidence for spinning and weaving and for figurine clothing from the Late Preclassic PALM 693/985 village is in keep­ing with indications that textiles had a restricted social role in the Preclassic period. Despite increasing elite use of textiles and feathers by the Late to Terminal Preclassic period, they were not yet widespread in figurines associated with ordi­nary residences. 
Classic Period. A very different state of affairs characterized the Classic period in south-central Veracruz. PALM excavations at residential mound 1126 yielded mainly Early Classic materi­als (Figure 3). At residential mounds 1055 and 1056 a few deep strata have inventories similar to 1126, but most of the remains are Late Classic. At both locations mold-formed, specially manufac­tured spindle whorls attest to cotton spinning (Stark, ed. 1998). Mold-formed whorls represent a technological improvement over perforated sherd disks because a more balanced spindle weight can be guaranteed. If perforated sherd disks were used in earlier spinning, they probably 
had to be "balanced" with resin or wax. At mound 
1126 there were 33 whorls, while 105511056 
yielded 48. The medians for whorl diameter and 
hole diameter of all Mixtequilla whorls (survey 
and excavations, except the large whorl mentioned 
previously) fall at the upper end of Parsons's 
(1972:62-64) distributions for possible cotton­
related whorls, but fall within her modal value for 
weight. Thus, the likely fiber was cotton. 
Bone tools from mounds 1126 and 1055/1056 
provide some support for the existence of a 
Classic-period textile industry, although many of 
the tool fragments are ambiguous in regard to 
function. At 1126, two needle or awl fragments, 
seven awls, and two needles were recovered. At 
1055/1056, four needle or awl fragments, two 
punches or battens, and two awls were found. 
Although awls may have many uses, they would 
serve well as warp lifters during weaving 
(O'Neale 1945:Figure 75h). In tandem with the 
amount of probable textile-related bone tools, the 
amount of worked bone shafts and other miscel­
laneous worked bone fragments increased com­
pared to the Preclassic period: 4 at 693/985, 3 at 
354, 11 at 1126, and 14 at 1055/1056. 
To evaluate the changing amounts of spinning and textile-working implements from the Preclassic to Classic periods, we calculated the ratio of these items to rim sherds in excavated deposits. The ratio of centrally perforated sherd disks or whorls to rim sherds increases from the Preclassic to Classic periods: .002 at 693/985 (Late Preclassic period); .006 at 354 (Terminal Preclassic and Classic periods); .009 at 1126 and .009 at 1055/1056 (Classic period). Inclusion of needles, awls, and possible battens with whorls and disks yields a combined ratio to rim sherds of .002 at 693/985; .008 at 354; .01 at 1126; and .01 at 1055/1056 (Stark, ed. 1998). 
Imagery from the Classic period manifests an equally dramatic shift. Although the spatial and chronological distributions of the highly varied Classic Veracruz figurines require much addi­tional study, both Early and Late Classic figurines frequently depict men and women with elaborate headdresses or gear, often including feathers, and with textilelike garments (Ethnic Arts Council of Los Angeles 1971:68, 70-71, 76-77; Medellin 1960:71-73, 78, 88-89, 94-95). For example, females especially are shown with considerable

amounts of textiles, often with a long skirt and a huipil or quechquemitl (Ethnic Arts Council of Los Angeles 1971: 51-52, 70-71; Goldstein 1987: 67-68). Not uncommonly, decorative pat­terns are shown on garments. Only a few figurine types are nearly nude, such as some smiling face figurines. Classic-period stelae from Cerro de las Mesas and the vicinity continue to show elabo­rately garbed leaders with impressive headdresses (Miller 1991), although possible feather motifs are scarce or absent. These commemorated lead­ers no longer are the only obvious consumers of textiles, although they bear some of the most elaborate garb. The persons and supernaturals shown on household figurines and larger hollow ceramic figures also typically display textilelike garments and commonly have feathered head­dresses. 
The distribution of whorls encountered during survey shows that cotton processing was not spa­tially restricted to a few residences. At Copan, Honduras, tools for textile production were simi­larly widespread and associated with residences (Hendon 1992: 12). The number of PALM whorls (all periods) per collection unit is shown in Figure 3 (the ratio of the number of whorls to rim sherds displays a similar pattern; we have opted to pro­vide the simpler distribution based on count). We do not attempt to show only Classic whorls because, without excavated Postclassic contexts, we cannot be sure that types of whorls associated with Classic excavated deposits do not also con­tinue into the Postclassic period. (In the next sec­tion we determine whorl types that likely were exclusively Postclassic in date.) 
The increased evidence for spinning and weav­ing at PALM Classic-period residential excava­tions suggests more households were processing cotton fibers in the Mixtequilla. Reported popula­tion increase from the Preclassic to the Classic period could mean a larger local labor pool for growing and processing cotton (Stark and Curet 1994). Spinning seems likely to have been a wide­spread Classic household activity and, therefore, may indicate a regional-or community-level spe­cialization, with labor supplied in domestic con­texts. Whether domestic production was at a scale to provide cotton or cotton textiles as common tributary items or for export remains unclear but not unlikely. 
Postclassic Period. Although a trace of Post­classic material occurred in the uppermost strata (mainly the plow zone) in some of the PALM res­idential excavations, Postclassi c residences were not the focus of the testing. Thus, we do not have the advantage of adequate excavated whorl data for the Postclassic period. We tum to the survey collections, among which the Postclassic period is well represented, but often as the latest in a series of occupations. In the low-lying Mixtequilla terrain, elevated residential mounds were attractive for reoccupation, and most surface collections are mixed. We have to establish which whorls may be from the Postclassic peri od. Figures 4 and 5 illustrate the range of forms and decorations among survey whorls. 
Using preliminary data for a graduate term paper in 1988, Joyce Hitchcock noted that whorls with mold-impressed designs (sometimes with additional slip or paint) appear to be associated with Postclassic ceramics. She also detected that these whorls tend to be slightly larger than others. As Parsons (1972:61) remarks, the weight and diameter of the whorl determine the moment of inertia that affects the action of the spindle. Larger whorls may imply a thicker thread, but the exact effects of different whorl sizes and dimen­sions are poorly known. A scatterplot of impressed and non-impressed whorls shows that the two categories form partly overlapping popu­lations in regard to whorl diameter and weight, but that the impressed whorls tend to be larger (p = .000 for the comparison of impressed to non­impressed for weight and p = .000 for diameter using a t-test) (Figure 6, upper). We address the Postclassic ceramic association of impressed whorls below, after considering whether any other whorls might be Postclassic in date. 
Other than their decoration and size, impressed whorls do not differ greatly from others. Descriptive statistics for variously decorated whorls are provided in Table 1. The impressed and non-impressed whorls have similar surface treatments (apart from the mold-impressed designs), although frequencies of some surface treatments differ on impressed whorls (more chapopote coatings, for example [Stark, ed. 1998]).12 Cross-cutting the surface treatments is a variety of whorl shapes, as well, but there is sub­stantial formal similarity between non-impressed

impressed whorls, median weights vary (Table 2): aberrant, conical, and constricted shapes have higher median weights of 7.2, 5.8, and 7.0 g, respectively; flat (4.0 g), edge-grooved (4.7 g), and dome-subdome (4.9 g) whorls have lower median weights. Because weight is measurable for only 6 aberrant whorls and 11 constricted ones, the 32 measurable conical whorls consti­tute a more robust category that differs in weight compared to other non-impressed whorls (p = .007 using a t-test) but not in whorl diameter (n = 39, p = .739). Aberrant and conical whorls are absent in Classic-period excavated deposits (there was one conical whorl from the surface of 
1055/1056). One constricted whorl was recov­ered in excavation at 1126, and, therefore, the chronology of this form remains uncertain. A cross-plot of whorl weight and diameter shows that impressed whorls are the most distinctive category in regard to larger size (Figure 6). Conical whorls include some lightweight cases (Figure 6, lower). 
The association between impressed and coni­cal whorls and Postclassic diagnostics is shown in Figure 7. For different whorl categories, the tem­porally diagnostic rim sherds in each associated surface collection are summed for survey collec­tions, and then the percentage of diagnostics for each period is computed using the grand total of these diagnostic sherds. Impressed whorls are found in collections with a higher frequency of Postclassic diagnostics and a lower frequency of Classic diagnostics compared to non-impressed whorls, which are broken down by form (Figure 7, upper) and by decoration (Figure 7, lower) for the more robust categories (with 25 or more whorls). On the basis of the survey data, coupled with the excavations (which include only two impressed whorls, likely representing Postclassic mixture at mounds 1055/1056), the impressed surface treatment is probably exclusive to the Postclassic period. The second category possibly related to the Postclassic period is non-impressed conical whorls. 13

importance of cotton in the Mixtequilla likely affected women's time budgets (negatively) and social status (positively). The Mixtequilla house­hold was a nexus of textile production in an envi­ronment in which winter cotton was grown in a seasonal round with foods; control of labor and land would have been crucial to household and regional prosperity. During the Postclassic period, tribute demands and the changed political and economic conditions affecting the Mixtequilla altered the character of textiles produced. Changes in the thread spun or in textile decoration may have been a response to an active market in which production output became somewhat more emphasized, with a corresponding deemphasis in quality or resistance to tribute demands, as sug­gested by Brumfiel (1993, 1996). 
Comparative Data 
We have proposed a Terminal Preclassic incep­tion for cotton-related spindle whorls in the Mixtequilla, with cotton production remaining a prominent activity until late historic times. Logically, we should expect to see similar pat­terns in some other regions that were extremely well suited to cotton production. The Mixtequilla patterns do not stand alone. Hall (1997) compiled data from central and southern Veracruz. She argued that by the Classic period cotton produc­tion had become important in the Mixtequilla and at Matacapan in the Tuxtla Mountains. She stressed that export of cotton and/or cotton tex­tiles may have figured in Classic-period political economies. On the Pacific coastal plain of Guatemala at the center of Balsamo, Escuintla, perforated worked sherd disks and a few whorls were recovered in residential areas that likely date to the Late or possibly Terminal Preclassic period (Stark et al. 1985: 106; Stark et al. 1981 :297-299). This association seemed anomalous until Arroyo (1993) documented whorls at the Terminal Preclassic center of Balberta, Escuintla. Her Type 1 whorl is particularly associated with the Terminal Preclassic and Early Classic periods. This type differs from later whorls in having an average of 6 g more weight (mean of 21.7 g vs. 12.9-17.5 g for later types), suggesting a thicker thread, although still likely involving cotton.1' In comparison, Parsons (1972:64) suggested that cotton whorls in the Postclassic Teotihuacan 
Valley are generally less than 10 g but range up to 20 g. 
Arroyo (1993:143) remarks that, with the exception of a spindle whorl possibly from the Crucero phase at La Victoria (Coe 1961:109), spindle whorls are not common on the Pacific coast until the Late Classic period. Although Balsamo is near Balberta, she was apparently unaware that Balsamo had yielded corroborating evidence and similarly sized whorls. The Pacific coast sites suggest that the Escuintla area launched into substantial cotton spinning earlier than other areas of the Pacific coast. 
In northern Veracruz, where Ekholm (1944:450-467) established a cultural sequence for the Tampico area, whorls are not abundant until the Postclassic period. Perhaps this reflects uneven economic development as well, but, as we pointed out above, south-central Veracruz is bet­ter suited to cotton growing environmentally than is northern Veracruz. 
There appears to be variation in the trans­Isthmian lowlands in respect to early investment in cotton processing. Although uneven economic change is not surprising, until the Balsamo, Matacapan, Balberta, and Mixtequilla studies, no one had proposed significant cotton processing in the Terminal Preclassic or Early Classic periods in the coastal lowlands. More detailed investiga­tions of this period in locations well suited to cot­ton growing may yield additional evidence. The types of deposits excavated and field methods have a direct bearing on whorl recovery and the analysis of contexts. Whorls are small artifacts that were heavily curated. 
Carlsen (1986: 134, 147) reports that a textile fragment from Rio Azul, Guatemala, was likely cotton, suggesting the presence of this fiber in the Maya Lowlands during the Early Classic period; Classic sculptural imagery shows elaborately garbed elites (Hendon 1992:8-9). A house at Ceren, Salvador, yielded probable G. hirsutum seeds, cotton cloth, and spindle whorls dating near the close of the sixth century AD. (Lentz et al. 1996:255). Mahler (1965:582) remarks that Preclassic Maya figurines usually do not show garments, which suggests that diachronic analy­ses of Maya spinning and textiles will be infor­mative and may parallel the Gulf lowlands. The Maya Lowlands may have become an important

textile-producing zone during the Classic period 
(Large 1975). 
In the Oaxaca and Ejutla Valleys, spindle whorls, mainly suited to cotton, first appear in the Early Classic period (Monte Alban IIIA) (Feinman and Nicholas 1990:236, 1992:102). They are far more common in the lower-elevation Ejutla Valley than in the Oaxaca Valley. Feinman and Nicholas (1992:89) note that, although cotton might have been grown in the Ejutla Valley with irrigation, it also may have been imported from coastal locations. The timing and patterning of the Ejutla and Oaxaca evidence hints that some low­land cotton may have been exported and that there was highland demand. Finds of cotton at Teotihuacan mentioned previously attest to export from cotton-producing zones. Despite these vari­ous sources of comparative data, we are far short of an integrated interregional picture. Balsamo, Balberta, and the Mixtequilla suggest that the more centralized and perhaps politically stronger coastal polities were among those more heavily involved in cotton production earlier than was characteristic of many regions. 
King Cotton: Long-Term Interregional 
Perspective on Economic Change 


Previously we remarked on the important role of cotton textiles in Postclassic Mesoamerica and the notable quantities drawn to the Aztec capital as tribute. How did these circumstances emerge? How did cotton cloth become so important and pervasive? Diachronic data from multiple regions will eventually give us better answers, but here we tackle this issue with an emphasis on the south­central Gulf lowlands. We consider the impact of a changing textile industry from the perspectives of production, distribution, and consumption. Finally, we address long-term economic changes in Mesoamerica. In this endeavor, we attempt to explore these broad interpretive issues, but not necessarily to resolve them. 
Prod uction 
Domesticated cotton is documented as early as the Archaic period in Mesoamerica. Cotton had a potential through selection and technology to pro­duce soft, durable textiles in large quantities. This potential may have been realized in part through the stimulus of changing prestige economies dur­ing Olmec times. Whether Gulf lowlanders played a crucial role in the selection and manage­ment of Gossypium remains unknown but possi­ble. They certainly were among the trans-Isthmian societies that began to lionize cloth garments and feather regalia in the Late and Terminal Preclassic periods. According to imagery, the likely initial social contexts for dis­play of textiles and feather regalia were linked to Middle and Late Preclassic elites. Perhaps tools of production for these periods will be found in elite household contexts if attached specialists were involved. 
As we have indicated in the period-by-period summaries, cotton-sized spindle whorls appeared earlier in the south-central Gulf lowlands and in greater numbers than in most other regions of Mesoamerica. We suggest that specially manufac­tured whorls occurred first in the Terminal Preclassic or near the beginning of the Early Classic period as cotton production increased and cotton garments became a more widespread social resource in the Mixtequilla. 
The growth of a cotton textile industry implies selection of varieties and adjustments in cultivation practices to improve yields and quality in cotton. Eventually annual cotton was achieved, but we don't know when or where. Increased cotton pro­duction would have created a differential in the Mixtequilla between terrain that was less suscepti­ble to inundation, permitting a rainy-season food crop and a dry-season cotton crop, and terrain so low lying that only a dry-season crop could be grown. Cotton's requirements benefited parts of south-central Veracruz and the Tuxtla Mountains and were a liability in rainier segments of the Gulf lowlands, such as southern Veracruz. A survey by Daneels (1997) along the lower Cotaxtla River to the west of the Mixtequilla encountered few whorls among surface materials except near the coast. The Cotaxtla and PALM data contrast because the Mixtequilla has considerably more evidence of cotton processing; however, the Mixtequilla survey was more intensive, which affects this comparison. With the advent of cotton as an important resource, economic differentials among regions within the Gulf lowlands were surely exaggerated and altered. The march of suc­cessive regional prominence from southern Veracruz in the Preclassic, to central, especially

south-central, Veracruz in the Classic, to northern Veracruz in the Postclassic that was observed by Wilkerson (1987:17) likely does not so much reflect a cultural stimulation and progression, as he argued, as a series of economic transformations. 
The labor-intensive steps in producing textiles drew weavers, possibly women in a domestic context, into the wider economy in a new way. Possibly some larger elite households would have had more personnel devoted to textiles and, there­fore, more evidence of spinning and weaving, but this kind of distinction is best addressed through excavation and requires more data than we cur­rently command. Hall (1997) describes a Classic­period residential mound at Matacapan with an unusual number of whorls that might be one indi­cation of this phenomenon. 
Distribution and Consumption 
We suspect that hierarchical Gulf societies partic­ularly encouraged the elaboration of parapherna­lia associated with high office during the Olmec portion of the Preclassic period (ca. 1600--400 B.C). Certainly no other coeval regions equaled Gulf Olmec centers like San Lorenzo and La Venta in their extensive networks for exotic mate­rials and command of highly skilled craft objects in the Olmec style. Such successes in long-dis­tance exchange were less feasible in Late and Terminal Preclassic times. The regionalization and local polity development that characterize the Late and Terminal Preclassic periods in Mesoamerica substantially limited the ability of any one polity to assure access to distant exotic materials (Grove 1987:440-441). Societies in the coastal lowlands on both the Atlantic and Pacific sides may have adjusted to these conditions by further elaboration of finely crafted local resources including textiles and feather-decorated regalia (Helms 1993: 196). Prestige objects replete with sacred symbolic value may be either exotic natural materials, finely crafted products, or both (Helms 1993). Similarly, writing and astronomi­cal and calendric lore, all representing esoteric knowledge, became more prominent in several societies, including the Mixtequilla. 

Whatever the constraints or incentives, the restriction of cotton textiles and feathered gear to elites did not endure. Textiles have the special quality of permitting almost endless decorative 
elaboration through variations in dyeing, weav­
ing, embroidery, and other additions (Hicks 
1994). Therefore, the possible "decay" of value, 
as prestige items gradually enter wider circulation 
through prestations to clients and gift exchange, 
can always be countered through differentials in 
labor investment, emphasis on the degree of new­
ness or lack of wear, and sumptuary rules. This is 
one reason that cotton textiles retained high value 
and even became units of value in Postclassic 
times. 
The restriction of cotton production to lower elevations in Mesoamerica likely promoted a gra­dient in value. Duran (1971:200 [1570]) states that only Aztec nobility were allowed cotton tex­tiles, yet Classic and Postclassic Gulf lowland fig­urines in household use commonly depict textiles, and the probable material was cotton. It seems uncertain how effectively the Aztec sumptuary prohibition affected access to cotton textiles in view of the quantity that entered Tenochtitlan as tribute, but the idea of restriction certainly reflects the necessity to import cotton to the Basin of Mexico. This restriction is unlikely to have been charactristic in producing regions where, instead, the kind or quality of cotton garment probably played a greater role. 

For a Mixtequilla regional specialization to emerge at a scale permitting substantial export of cotton or cotton textiles to nonproducing regions, we have to envision either a striking degree of administrative control over a population (because of the high labor demands) or a more widespread appreciation of and willingness to invest labor in textiles because of their local social uses. The lat­ter seems to have been the case in south-central Veracruz; the prominence of garments in figurine imagery seems to have expressed and reinforced widespread cultural values. This emphasis is an important feature of the Preclassic to Classic­period transition. The expansion of cotton textiles beyond a restricted elite context is a complex change that will require study. One possibility is that a growing role for cotton-textile tribute to elites in the Gulf lowlands allowed export to non­producing areas in a process that benefited Gulf elites, as well as substantial portions of the popu­lation. 
What factors may have conditioned Classic­period interregional cotton distribution?

Teotihuacan, a major Classic capital in the Basin of Mexico, is an important starting point for addressing this question. Imagery on murals and vessels at Teotihuacan shows important people typically dressed in elaborate garments, but fab­rics could have been made from maguey or cotton fibers. Local textile production is poorly docu­mented at Teotihuacan. We suspect that the endur­ing fascination of Teotihuacanos for scroll imagery (Stark 1998) and Lustrous Ware vessels was part of a consumption pattern emphasizing prestige valuables from the Gulf lowlands, including cotton textiles because cotton could not be grown in the Basin of Mexico (McClung de Tapia 1987:69). Seashells (from both coasts) also appeared at the city in considerable numbers dur­ing most of its history (Kolb 1987). An enclave of Gulf-lowland-affiliated inhabitants may have dwelled in the city (Rattray 1987, 1989). Other maj or polities and cultural regions of Mesoamerica, such as Monte Alban and various Maya centers, are not so consistently featured stylistically at Teotihuacan, which generally eschewed external styles. 
There may be varied reasons for these differ­ential patterns of stylistic interest at Teotihuacan, but one possible factor is the proximity and potential of the Gulf lowlands to supply bril­liantly colored tropical feathers and cotton tex­tiles. The supply mechanisms remain uncertain, whether through elite gift exchanges and alliance, market exchange, conquest and tribute, or some combination of these. Since it is difficult as yet to prove any tributary relationship for most areas of the Gulf lowlands (Stark 1989, 1990), elite gift exchanges and administered trade seem more promising as mechanisms. Stark et al. (1 992) raised questions about the effectiveness of market institutions as pervasive interregional mecha­nisms for exchange during the interval when major highland states emerged in Mesoamerica. Such states may have encouraged specialization and markets within their administered domains, but it remains debatable whether we should expect the market to have become a crucial mech­anism linking independent polities during most of the Classic period. If so, the quantities of cotton textiles available at Teotihuacan would likely have been less than those obtained by the Aztecs, who relied on both markets and tribute. 
An additional contributing factor to growth in the distribution of cotton and cotton textiles is the transportation context. Cotton textiles and brightly colored feathers can form part of low­land-highland complementary exchange carried out by foot transport. The durability of cotton, cotton textiles, and feathers and the favorable weight-to-value ratio meant that it was feasible to supply distant highland areas. Broader Mesoamerican conditions may have increased demand for cotton textiles. A growing Classic­period role for cloth garments, including cotton, is linked to the prevalence across Mesoamerica of urban centers or sizable states in which ethnic dif­ferences and factional affiliations played impor­tant political and social roles. Pasztory (1993) has underscored the stylistic differentiation, including dress, that typifies different polities in Meso­america during the Classic period. 
Classic-period patterns were not static. Blanton et al. (1993:210-214) proposed that the collapse of major Classic-period states posed a substantial challenge to the livelihoods of special­ists within their borders. One suggested conse­quence is that entrepreneurs fomented marketing as a mechanism of exchange partly independently of state control. In this line of reasoning, the col­lapse of major states unleashed market institu­tions. The Postclassic Mesoamerican emphasis on complex market institutions, therefore, emerges from a particular set of antecedent conditions in this scenario and should not be assumed to have characterized the Classic period to the same extent as the Postclassic period. 
Although some valued products, such as greenstone ornaments, are so durable that only burial or accidental breakage removes them from circulation, cotton textiles and feathers are subject to wear and require periodic renewal. Hicks (1994:97), for instance, cites ethnographic studies suggesting that males required two to three sets of cotton workday clothing annually in Prehispanic times. Cotton textiles, therefore, had a potential to ignite an enduring, rather constant process of exchange that mobilized household labor in inter­regional and local economies. If Teotihuacan or other highland states managed to engineer con­siderable prestige exchange or administered trade with the Gulf lowlands, the supply obtained may have fallen far short of the demand for lowland

garments and regalia. Eventually two effects may have ensued. 

First, whether impelled by local interest or responsive to outside demands, more lower-ele­vation upland regions are likely to have been enlisted in cotton production, probably with an annual cotton. The appearance of 
whorls in Morelos in the Epiclassic period may be a case in point (Smith and Hirth 1988). In some regions to which annual cotton production could expand, the crop would be a summer rainy-season endeavor, displacing food crops. Therefore, large landholders could produce a high-value product suited to both local and interregional exchange while still growing some foods. Small landhold­ers would not have the same opportunity. Irrigated lands with suitable climate and soils would become particularly advantageous for cot­ton production for the reasons noted previously concerning cotton's growth habits. Added eco­nomic incentives to augment landholdings could exacerbate social differences. Access to client labor for growing and processing cotton and for weaving would become crucial in an economy affected by increased demand for cotton. The enduring role of the lower Papaloapan Basin in cotton production is linked to the possibility of double cropping and the seasonal complementar­ity of cotton and food staples, which allowed subsistence for a labor force. 
Second, the difficulty of acquiring sufficient supplies of cotton in some highland polities may have encouraged militaristic expansion. There seem to have been only modest incentives for Gulf lowland regions to produce textiles to export in quantities to the Basin of Mexico, for example. Left to their own devices, Gulf societies might have consumed a great deal of their own cotton textiles, with fitful export to other regions. Apart from obsidian and greenstone, there are few cru­cial highland resources that might have motivated lowland societies in balanced exchanges. In the Gulf lowlands, ground-stone implements can be obtained from localities like the Tuxtla Mountains or the Sierra de Chiconquiaco or from the pied­mont zones leading up to Puebla and Tlaxcala. The Basin of Mexico is not a crucial supplier. Therefore, there likely was unsatisfied demand for cotton textiles in powerful highland regions. Aztec imperial expansion surely had many moti­vations, but better access to desirable hot-country products like cotton was one. 
Long-Term Perspective 

We urge a highly dynamic perspective on Meso­american economic and social change, recogniz­ing important shifts in crucial products and interregional relations. Some products such as cotton and cotton textiles had a potential to increase and change in value in local and interre­gional contexts. This potential contrasts with greenstone ornaments, which did not change greatly as prestige items from Olmec to Aztec times. Cotton contrasts in part with knapped obsidian, which underwent a related development with the inception of prismatic blade technology. Prismatic technology operated in a restricted (elite) social context in most nonproducing regions during the Preclassic period (Clark 1987), but became widespread in the Classic period in regions without suitable local materials. Little further change occurred in the economics and technology of chipped obsidian once prismatic blade core and blade production, distribution, and use became widespread (for example, tunnel min­ing was elaborated at Pico de Orizaba, permitting exploitation of that source for prismatic blade nuclei [Stocker and Cobean 1984)). Of course, political shifts affected control of sources and dis­tribution networks. 
In contrast, cotton escalated in importance between the Classic and Postclassic periods as more regions exhibited substantial production or processing. Metal implements might have suc­ceeded cotton as ingredients in economic change had not the Spanish conquest occurred. Metal artifacts were mainly prestige items during the Postclassic period (Hosler 1988), but further tech­nological and social change might have brought metal into wider circulation and led to a wider range of uses. Our point is that each technological domain had particular properties and facility (or lack of it) for economic change. Mesoamerican economy was not static. The incentives for trade and conquest were unstable in Mesoamerica because of substantial changes in regional prod­ucts, in the roles of households, and especially in women's labor. Ginning, carding, spinning, and weaving demand considerable labor but can be interfingered with other domestic tasks. While

women may not have been the only textile pro­ducers, it is probable that they played a prominent role and were mobilized to a greater extent in the wider economy. 
Our data are adequate to suggest a dynamic history for the cotton textile industry, but much remains to be accomplished to assess it fully. Most important will be additional regional diachronic studies that systematically assess bone implements, centrally perforated sherd disks, whorls, and imagery. 16 We need a diachronic record of the maguey industry in the highlands to track the major alternative material for textiles. Other fiber sources, such as wild silk and lowland ixtle fibers require economic and technological study. Finally, textiles provide only one window on Mesoamerican economic systems; additional comparisons to other parts of the economy and to political changes are essential.

Notes 
I. Issues in long-term economic change are varied. Some authors have considered the dynamics of prestige economies (Kipp and Schortman 1989; Spence 1982), i.e., ones in which exchange of valuables fraught with social meaning dominates over subsistence exchanges among societies, especially over long distances. Others have addressed the origins of market institutions (Blanton 1983) or interregional dependencies in "world systems" (Blanton and Feinman 1984; Wallerstein 1974). Diachronic models rest on concepts of economic and political systems, especially those elabo­rated by Polanyi (1971 ), Sahlins (1972), the neoevolutionists (Fried 1967; Sahlins 1963; Service 1971), students of empires (Hassig 1984; Luttwak 1976; Schreiber 1992), and other economic and historical analyses (Braudel 1972; Eisenstadt 1969; Schneider 1978; Wolf 1982). In particular, prestige items, market institutions, tribute, and staple finance (D' Altroy and Earle 1985) have proven to be crucial con­ceptual distinctions for ancient complex societies.

The early growth stage of cotton needs humid soils through irrigation or rainfall, but too much moisture during flowering and fruiting causes flower and boll loss and unde­sirable vegetative growth. The flowering and boll-ripening stages require dry conditions for optimum production, but moisture between the two stages for boll development. In general, cotton resists drought. Attolini (1949:217-2 18) attributed declining historic cotton production in southern Veracruz to climatic factors-the high amount of rain and its occasional occurrence when cotton demands dry conditions. He remarked that rain was not uncommon in March in the Acayucan area in southern Veracruz, staining the cotton fibers and reducing the value of the crop. For this reason, rainfall cultivation in central Veracruz is likely to have been more successful, and, ultimately, major cotton production shifted to hot, dry irrigated regions and became unimportant in the modern economy of Veracruz. Winter rains are impor­tant in modern food production in the Coatzacoalcos drainage, with up to four crops a year (Coe 1974), confirm­ing the idea that cotton growing in southern Veracruz would be problematic. 

3. 
Carns and Mauney (1968:43, 46) report only slightly lower values of 32.7°C and 27°C for germination and seedling growth, respectively. 

4. 
Planting was in the winter season between September and December for a May harvest; food crops were then planted during the summer rainy season (Ruz y Sandoval I 884: 134-137). The following production steps started with clearing a new plot (or clearing secondary growth from a fal­lowed plot): (I) January or February, vegetation was cut and shortly thereafter burned. (2) Maize was sown at the onset of the rainy season in May. (3) In September cotton was sown between the maize rows, with a separation of approximately 


1.5 m between plantings, with 5-6 seeds in each planting hole, the seeds having been soaked briefly. However, Attolini (1949:217-218) notes later planting times-November in Acayucan and December in the lower Papaloapan Basin. These variations likely reflect local conditions affecting the maize harvest and timing of rains. (4) Approximately 15-20 days after germination, the plot was weeded and plants were thinned to 2-3 seedlings. (5) One month after germination, the seedlings were laid on their sides with dirt placed over the stems. This measure involved a crucial technology for the norte-plagued Gulf lowlands, as otherwise the plants were knocked over by the winds and damaged, with interlacing of branches that made subsequent cultivation more laborious.

(6) Two months after germination, the excess, nonrecumbent shoots were pruned. (7) Another thinning of leafy shoots fol­lowed the first by 20-25 days. Throughout the growth period, weeding and tilling the soil were important. Attolini (1949:217-218) noted three cycles of weeding and vegeta­tive trimming. Harvests occurred in April and May (Lazcano 1938:34). Fields were used for cotton only two years, with a third year of rest before the field was used again for cotton (Ruz y Sandoval 1884:136). In Prehispanic times, the variety of cotton would have had an impact on the suitability of his­toric Gulf cultivation practices, as they are geared to an annual cotton, presumably G. hirsutum laetifolium. The perennial races of G. hirsutum are more likely to have been grown in semipermanent groves or house gardens and to have withstood nortes better. Keremitsis (1987: 170) says perennial cotton yields good crops (three-fifths to five­eighths of a bale per acre) for four to seven years and then usually is replanted. 
Berdan (1 987:237) mistakenly ascribed the cotton har­vest on both the Pacific and Gulf coasts to September­October. The very dry belt near the Pacific coast may require summer planting of cotton during the rainy season, but the Veracruz accounts clearly show cotton was a winter crop, partly because of multicropping, but also because the sum­mer rainy season would provide excessive moisture in most locations.

Upland annual cotton, a less photoperiodic variety, was developed in the United States around 1700 from the lati­folium race of Gossypium hirsutum (Purseglove 1968:340, 345). Earlier tropical cotton demanded short days rather than the longer summer days of more northerly latitudes (Lewis and Richmond 1968:8). Upland cotton was introduced to most tropical and subtropical countries during the U.S. Civil War. At that time production in the southern United States was blocked from the English textile industry. However, the principal commercial cultivar(s) grown in Veracruz in the 1800s remains unknown. Ruz y Sandoval (1884: 132-134) emphasized annual cotton in Veracruz but noted multiple varieties, including tree cotton. Keremitsis (1987: 170) stresses that nineteenth-century Mexican production included both annual and perennial varieties.

Sahagun (1950-1982, Book 10:187 [ca. 1578]) mentions weaving and embroidery as specializations for the land of the Olmeca, Uixtotl, and Mixteca, at least some of whom dwelled in the central or southern Gulf lowlands. In northern Veracruz the Totonaque and Huaxteca also were noted as producers of cotton clothing (Sahagun 1950-1982, Book 


10:184, 186 [ca. 1578]). Ethnohistoric data from the six­teenth and early seventeenth centuries for the lower Papaloapan Basin disclose that staple crops and cotton were common products in agricultural communities (Stark 1974). 
Barlow (1949:58-59, 89, 90-92, 95-96) summarizes the semiannual tribute in cotton from the Gulf lowlands to the Aztec Triple Alliance (north to south-central Veracruz): Tuchpa, 3,634 bundles of mantles, 400 articles of women's clothing, and 240 richly decorated mantles; Cuetlaxtlan, 2,800 mantles, 400 articles of women's clothing, and 160 richly decorated mantles; and Tochtepec, 1,200 mantles and 
1,600 richly decorated mantles. Berdan et al. (1996:112-113; 
Smith and Berdan 1996:7) revised the boundaries of the cot­ton-producing Tlalauquitepec and Quauhtochco tributary provinces, which Barlow had extended to the coast as well. The bulk of the highly decorated mantles for elite consump­tion came from Tochtepec, which encompassed most of the Papaloapan Basin. 
Not all lowland Gulf towns were involved in cotton pro­duction. Tlalixcoyan, located in the western Papaloapan Basin, is not mentioned in regard to cotton or cloth produc­tion in the sixteenth-and seventeenth-century records, but it is poorly documented. Nor is cotton mentioned for Cotaxtla, located on the next drainage to the west in central Veracruz, but also poorly documented, at least in the sources Stark (1974) consulted. The early ethnohistoric records show that tribute from central and southern Veracruz sometimes con­sisted of nonlocal items. Consequently, one puzzle is whether the lack of mention of cotton in the two communi­ties of Tlalixcoyan and Cotaxtla in the earliest historical records means that cotton was not produced or processed there. Such districts could have provided the Aztec with cot­ton obtained through trade. Perhaps lack of mention of cot­ton for Tlalixcoyan and Cotaxtla is a case of missing data, but it may also reflect postconquest changes. Cotton is reported as unknown in Tlalixcoyan, Cotaxtla, and Medellin (at the mouth of the Cotaxtla River) when it was introduced in 17 50 by de Betancurt, an official in Tlalixcoyan; resultant cotton production is described as excellent (Florescano and Gil 1976:65). Food staples and especially sugar cane are stressed for these towns; possibly local commercial products shifted following the Spanish conquest to foodstuffs for Veracruz and sugar for an international market. Archaeological survey of the lower Cotaxtla drainage by Daneels (1997) yielded spindle whorls only in an area near Laguna Mandinga along the coast, which tends to support the idea that drier parts of central Veracruz were less suited to (or involved in) cotton production than were areas in the Papaloapan drainage and the Tuxtlas. 
7. 
Cotton production declined following the Spanish con­quest, as sugar and cattle became important and native labor became scarce near Spanish settlements and major routes (Florescano 1965:74). Cotton production continued during the first half of the eighteenth century in some parts of Veracruz, such as along the Papaloapan River, but mainly for local consumption. Starting in 1750 cotton was increasingly emphasized as a crop. In 1797 diminished cotton harvests in south-central Veracruz are attributed mainly to a lack of labor, with too many men mobilized in the war with England, forcing the importation of labor from the Mixteca (Florescano and Gil 1976:67). Also, excessive taxation fol­lowing 1779 is stated to have caused general economic prob­lems and depopulation in towns in central Veracruz and the lower Papaloapan Basin (Florescano and Gil 1976:67). These circumstances would have been unfavorable for the labor demands of cotton. 

8. 
Cotton production varied in prominence historically in Veracruz according to national and international market con­ditions. Today, food crops, sugar cane, coffee, and cattle are the predominant products of the Veracruz coastal plain and piedmont, but cotton farming is absent, except possibly in

some traditional communities (Kelly and Palerm 1952:144). In contrast, in 1845 Veracruz produced four-fifths of Mexico's cotton (Keremitsis 1987:45). By 1876, however, it produced only one-third; it became a minor producer by 1880 due to the increase in irrigated cotton in northern parts of the republic and to imports from the United States (Keremitsis 1987: 167; Lazcano 1938:21-35; Sinclair 
1968:20). Lazcano (1938:34-35) remarks that fiber quality from Veracruz was inferior to other regions, many of them employing irrigation.

Wild silk was described as deriving from a large cocoon collected from a variety of tropical trees; the cocoon was formed by communal worms. The outer part of the cocoon yielded no usable fiber and was coated with a noxious goo, but once the cocoon was boiled, a "silk" could be extracted from the inner fibers. Mixtec Indians particularly sought these cocoons, traveling to slightly lower elevations in Tehuantepec and Guerrero to obtain them and spinning the thread to weave belts (Chavez and Florescano 1965: 152, 

163, 167, 179).

Small Quiahuistlan bowls from the Postclassic period are similar in form to the Morelos spinning bowls, but we have not yet detected characteristic wear patterns that would sig­nal their use in spinning because the PALM fragments are primarily from surface collections of rims.

An elevated proportion of differentially fired pottery in the later "black-orange" and "black-red" variants distin­guishes mound 354 as Terminal Preclassic in comparison to mounds 693/985, which date mainly to the Late Preclassic period. We know from Camaron I deposits at Patarata 52 (Stark 1989) and from the earliest layers at PALM mound 1126 that differential firing had disappeared by the Early Classic period. Therefore, inferentially mound 354 contains a large proportion of Terminal Preclassic material.

Among non-impressed whorls, many are covered with chapopote (27 percent), with a nearly equal amount (24 per­cent) bearing no slip or paint. Among impressed whorls, 53 percent were coated with chapopote and 33 percent lacked slip or paint. Impressed whorls yielded no cases with a white slip and only one with a white slip and chapopote-painted design; one impressed whorl had red slip with a chapopote design, but none had an orange slip and chapopote designs. Otherwise, both impressed and non-impressed whorls occa­sionally had orange or red slips or a chapopote-painted design over an unslipped surface. We conclude that whorl morphology and decoration do not differ greatly between impressed and non-impressed whorls except that chapopote coatings are considerably more common on impressed whorls. 

13. 
Spatial distributions of whorl types are not illustrated here, but they show an association of impressed and conical whorls with the Middle Postclassic center of El Sauce and with an area linked to Postclassic coma! production in the south-central part of the survey area (Curet 1993). Other types of whorls likely were produced and used during the Postclassic period, as well, but they were not so restricted in their chronology. There is a possibility that Classic-period 


assemblages included more of the lightest whorls, especially red-slipped ones and those with an orange or red slip and chapopote decoration. Non-impressed red-slipped whorls are the lightest (median weight of 3.7 g), closely followed by non-impressed whorls with a slip and chapopote decoration (3.9-4.6 g). However, the prevalence of Postclassic ceramics in surface collections precludes a definitive statement about the chronology of non-impressed whorls without excavated Postclassic materials. If these lighter whorls are associated with the Classic period, whorls in that time exhibit a range of variation that included very fine threads to a greater extent than the Postclassic whorls. 
14. 
Higher weights of Postclassic Mixtequilla impressed and non-impressed conical whorls may have facilitated a thicker thread and decreased quality in textiles as suggested by Brumfiel (1993, 1996). She tested whether spindle whorls for cotton fibers at Huexotla and Xico indicated production of thicker thread under Aztec rule than had been the case before. She suggests that such a change could be evidence of commoner resistance to new tribute demands. In Colonial times some Spanish encomenderos issued directives to com­bat poorly woven tributary textiles, possibly indicating peas­ant resistance. Because Brumfiel (1993) did not find evidence for any deterioration in thread quality under Aztec rule, she pointed out Aztec cultural and social factors that may have prevented this outcome in contrast to Colonial times. In Brumfiel's (1996) later discussion of the whorl data, she emphasized, instead, the probable role of coercion and monitoring of populations, in part because additional data suggested Colonial-era cotton thread remained fine. The change in Mixtequilla whorl diameters is slight between the Classic and Postclassic periods; we stress that experimental work and further stylistic and associational analyses of Postclassic whorls will be required before the larger size of impressed whorls can be ascribed confidently to resistance by weavers to the appropriation of their labor. In particular, we do not know how many other types of whorls are present in Postclassic deposits. Importantly, quality in textiles can be more effectively adjusted by a decrease in thread count (or textile size) that would not be reflected in spindle whorl attributes (Brumfiel 1996:454 ).

Archaeological methods play a role in successful study of the textile industry. Screening of PALM excavations assured regular recovery of small, broken bone tools and fragments of worked sherds and whorls. These highly curated tools of production are neither abundant nor large and demand ade­quate sampling to document change in textile-related imple­ments. Use of multiple lines of evidence is essential for an industry in which products are perishable and the tools of production also can be made from alternative, more perish­able materials such as wood.
