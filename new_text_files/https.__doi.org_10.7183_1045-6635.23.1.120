The lion's share of research on prehispanic Oaxaca has focused on the regional capital of Monte Alban or its antecedents; thus, it is noteworthy that After Monte Alban sets its sights on the Late Classic to Postclassic transition. The volume includes 12 chapters of archae­ological and ethnohistoric studies by both veterans and up and coming scholars who address a number of methodological and theoretical issues, some of which have impeded progress in our understanding of this dynamic, yet understudied, epoch. In providing a venue to shed light on these issues, editor Jeffrey Blomster seeks to put "Oaxaca 'back on the map' for this period ... [and] show its potential to examine larger anthropo­logical issues within Oaxaca" (p. xiii). The volume's broad-ranging contributions and innovative interpreta­tions do just that. 

Blomster' s introductory chapter primes readers with an overview of the political geography of Classic and Postclassic period Mesoamerica and then zeros in on selected debates and issues specific to Oaxaca. In dis­cussing the volume's theoretical orientation in regard to sociopolitical organization and development, Blomster explains that many (but not all) of the contributing authors draw inspiration from practice or agency theory, includ­ing the related concepts of "transformation and negoti­ation," which speak to the historical contingency of culture change and the limits of power relations within and among polities. 
Separate chapters by Michel Oudijk, Byron Hamann, and Bruce Byland foreground interpretations of ethno­historic documents, shedding light on the Late Classic to Postclassic transition in the Valley of Oaxaca and Mix­teca Alta regions. Oudijk (Chapter 3), working inde­pendently of archaeological data, presents an ethnohistorically based chronology for the Valley of Oax­aca based on his analysis of 14 Zapotec (Benizaa) doc­uments commemorating the foundation of royal lineages and dynasties. Hamann's contribution (Chapter4) draws heavily on the Mixtec codices to examine how Post­classic Oaxacans made sense of their ancient heritage and how relics of the past-ruins, artifacts, and even names-may have "imposed" themselves on the Post­classic present. Perhaps most ambitious is Byland's Chapter 10, which extends earlier efforts to correlate political histories recorded in the Mixtec codices with the archaeology of the Mixteca Alta. He argues that the codical scene known as the "War of Heaven" marks a period of political instability resulting from the collapse of Classic period centers. Related scenes indicate that this regional conflict was resolved with the transfer of political power to Tilantongo, whose authority was legit­imized through its association with the sacred center of Achiutla. Sadly, Byland passed away just months after this volume's publication and his pioneering scholarship bridging archaeology and ethnohistory will be deeply missed. 
Among the archaeological contributions from the Valley of Oaxaca, Robert Markens (Chapter 2) explains the intractable problems with Caso, Bernal, and Acosta's ( 1967) original ceramic chronology for the Classic through Postclassic periods. He then presents the results of his seriation of ceramic material from mortuary con­texts, which helps delineate the proposed Peche (500-600 CE), Xoo (600-800 CE), Early Liobaa (800-1000 CE), Late Liobaa (I 000-1200 CE), and Chila phases (1200-1521 CE). This work, which builds on previous efforts by Markens and colleagues, provides a more refined chronometric tool for future studies as well as extant archaeological collections. In fact, the revised ceramic chronology plays a role in Michael Lind's (Chapter 5) re-analysis of excavations at Lambityeco, directed by Paddock from 1961-1976. Lind argues that during Lambityeco's Xoo phase heyday, officials from Monte Albin installed their own ruler at the center, which may have so disenfranchised the local populace that they rejected their new overlords and eventually abandoned

the site. We also learn of new excavations at Macuilx6­chitl by Robert Markens, Marcus Winter, and Cira Martinez Lopez (Chapter 6). They describe the remains of high-status residences, tombs, and temples, including significant features atop Cerro Danush-a sacred hill­top. In the single archaeological contribution from the Mixteca Alta, Blomster (Chapter 9) describes a carved stone fragment discovered at the Postclassic capital of Etlatongo. This stone depicts a high-ranking male engaged in blood sacrifice or warfare, and Blomster rea­sons it may have once adorned a palace bench. 
The remaining chapters venture far beyond the most intensively studied Valley of Oaxaca and Mixteca Alta regions. Marcus Winter (Chapter 12) reviews existing archaeological data from the little-studied Mazateca, Chinantla, Mixe, and southern Isthmus regions of Oax­aca. Winter notes evidence for an abrupt Classic to Post­classic transition across most of these areas, marked by a sharp decline in population that was possibly drought induced. In addition, Winter objects to Smith and Berdan's (2003) modified world systems perspective of Postclassic Oaxaca because it implies that the area was more politically integrated than it probably was. He also challenges the notion that the Mixteca/Valley of Oaxaca region was a "core zone," since there is little evidence to support the implication that Mixtecs and Zapotecs dom­inated their peers in adjacent regions. From Oaxaca's neighbor to the West, Gerardo Gutierrez (Chapter 11) describes key prehispanic centers and associated cul­tural material from eastern Guerrero, noting moderate evidence for exchange with Teotihuacan and Monte 
Alban. The collapse of these aforementioned Classic period capitals, Gutierrez argues, did not have a dramatic affect on local life in Guerrero, a conclusion with impor­tant ramifications for theoretical models of interregional interaction. 
Twenty-five years ago, the archaeology of the lower Rfo Verde region was largely unknown, akin to the areas described by Winter and Gutierrez. Arthur Joyce (Chap­ter 7) traces the long-term history of political authority in the lower Rfo Verde region from the Formative through Postclassic periods, demonstrating just how much we can learn from research in areas once considered "periph­eries." Also notable is Joyce's theoretical approach, which draws on poststructural theory in viewing political sys­tems as "relatively unstable and negotiated." He sees ten­sions within and among communities playing a vital role in the creation of political formations that fluctuate through time; ranging from relatively centralized to decen­tralized and unfolding in historical contexts. In Chapter 8, Stacy King presents a rich array of archaeological mate­rial from household contexts at Rfo Viejo, also located in the lower Rio Verde region, to examine interaction with other areas of Oaxaca and beyond. Based on compara­tive stylistic analyses of artifact assemblages, King finds little evidence for exchange along the coast, but does argue for strong links with the MixtecaAlta, and perhaps with distant centers such as Cholula and Tula. 
I was especially taken by discussions in several chap­ters addressing larger debates concerning the roles of non-elites in ancient Mesoamerica. These debates include the degree to which they had access to and experienced elite art and writing (Hamann), the conceptual utility of "commoner" as a social category (Joyce), the nature of commoner-elite relationships and historical impacts (Joyce, Lind), and non-elite's participation in long dis­tance exchange (King). These chapters demonstrate that researchers working in Oaxaca are making substantive contributions to archaeological efforts that problematize the nature of social relationships and seek to appreciate more fully their importance in broader transformations. 
On an editorial note, I did not find the volume's orga­nization altogether intuitive, and dividing 12chapters into six separately titled sections seemed excessive. Further­more, the paper real estate consumed by the preface and foreword might have been more fruitfully apportioned to a concluding chapter prescribing areas for future research. Indeed, the volume provokes a host of ques­tions revealing how little we still know about the period after Monte Alban. There is considerable disagreement, for instance, concerning the circumstances that led to the fall of Monte Alban and other Classic capitals. In the realm of ethnohistory, lingering doubts regarding the scale of events depicted in the Mixtec codices (local or interregional?) and the identification of key place-names have prevented these records from playing a more promi­nent role in efforts to understand political reorganization in the Early Postclassic. Perhaps most evident is that apart for the lower Rio Verde region, our understanding of the Early Postclassic remains rudimentary for most areas of Oaxaca. The revised ceramic chronology for the Valley of Oaxaca should enable researchers to distinguish Early and Late Postclassic contexts more accurately, but similar ceramic refinements are needed in other regions-perhaps most urgently in the Mixteca Alta. 
In sum, After Monte Albdn's eclectic offerings fur­ther our understanding of the Classic to Postclassic tran­sition and reframe debates concerning fundamental understandings of complex sociopolitical organization and development in ancient Oaxaca.
