EL INDIGENO AND HIGH-ALTITUDE HUMAN OCCUPATION 
IN THE SOUTHERN ANDES, MENDOZA (ARGENTINA) 

Gustavo Neme 
The site El Indfgeno contains the greatest known concentration of hunter-gatherer residential features in the southern Andes. Located at 3,300 m asl in a meadow in the Cordillera of west-central Argentina, the site is notable for its 133 habitation structures, that-when considered along with the other characteristics of the site-represent an anomalous but perhaps not entirely unexpected adaptation to the highest altitude environment in the region. Based on radiocarbon dating and artifact typologies, the site was occupied between ca. 800 and 1500 B.P. It consequently represents the latest step in the indigenous colonization of what is arguably the most marginal environment in the region. This chronology suggests that the site was occupied when nearby lowland regions were under their most intensive use and during a time when new resources were incorporated into the high-altitude hunter-gatherer diet. In this article I report on research conducted at El Ind{geno and compare the results of these studies to the regional record, ultimately concluding that regional population increase affiliated with the spread of increasingly complex socioeconomic systems most parsimoniously explains the intensive occupation of this large, high-altitude hunter-gatherer site.

Localizado a 3300 msnm en una vega cordillerana del Centro Oeste Argentino, se destaca no solo por sus 133 estructuras sino por otros elementos, los cuales representan una anomala pero quizds no de/ todo inesperada adaptacion al entorno de mayor altitud en la region.

Esta cronolog{a sugiere ademds que el sitio Jue ocupado cuando todas las regiones proximas estaban siendo utilizadas intensivamente, y durante un tiempo en el que nuevos recursos fueron incorporados en la dieta de Los cazadores­recolectores. Aquf se presentan los resultados de los trabajos llevados a cabo en El Indfgeno, los cuales son comparados con el registro arqueologico regional. Finalmente se concluye que el incremento en la poblaci6n a nivel regional, asociado con la dispersion de una creciente complejidad def sistema socioecon6mico, puede explicar de forma mas parsimoniosa la ocupacion intensiva de este sitio de altura.

The south-central Andes of Argentina and Chile is one of the highest regions in the Ameri­cas, with peaks between 4,500 and 7 ,000 m asl. Here, biotic productivity is very low and soil for­mation weak, particularly above 3,300 m asl. At this elevation, vegetation is sparse and gives way to rock deserts and small plants. Steep and incised topography typically impedes movement across the landscape. Given these parameters, it is clear that environments above ca. 3 ,000 m as! in south­ern Mendoza Province, as elsewhere, are gener­ally Jess productive and less predictable than those found in lower elevations, and are consequently "marginal" (Bocher et al. 1972; Roig 1972). 
The indigenous populations who live in high­land ecosystems today have developed social and economic strategies well-suited to cope with the limitations of living in marginal, high-altitude environments (Lozny 2013). These strategies in­clude decreased overall mobility, increased caloric intake, storage and caching behaviors, and tech­nological innovations related to habitation and clothing that deal with cold and radiation stress. Adaptation to altitude also includes physiological changes for non-transhumant populations (Baker 1968; Beall 2007; Moran 2000; Orlove and Guil­let 1985; Thomas 1979). 
The idea of the marginality of high-altitude environments and the ensuing necessity for novel human behavioral adaptations is reflected in cir­cumstantial archaeological evidence worldwide. Per this work, most high altitude ecosystems around the world were intensively occupied and exploited only when resource exploitation in lower-elevation localities was radically intensi­fied. This arguably resulted in the need to expand into more marginal regions that entailed less ef­ficient foraging strategies (Aldenderfer 2006; Bet­tinger 1991; Brantingham et al. 2006, 2007; Mor­gan et al. 2012a; Zeanah 2000). Consequently, early use of high altitude systems was typically infrequent, opportunistic, often focused on hunt­ing large game, and characterized by strategies that tended to avoid risk and to share territories. In most places where intensified high-altitude land use later developed, these strategies were typically inverted and characterized by more fre­quent and logistically oriented occupations, in­tensive exploitation of plant resources, and in­creased territoriality (Aldenderfer 1998, 2006; Brantingham and Gao 2006; Brantingham et al. 2007; Moran 2000; Orlove and Guillet 1985). 
Because of these factors, it was until recently believed that most of the southern Andean high country was not intensively used by hunter-gath­erers. As a result, no systematic hunter-gatherer oriented research was carried out in these locales throughout most of the twentieth century, espe­cially in the periglacial environment. Most of the models used to characterize the use of mountain environments in South America focused on ex­plaining pastoralist adaptations. Pastoral land use was argued to have entailed a seasonal transhu­mance pattern where populations moved between different ecologic floors and different elevations depending on season (Lynch 1973; Morgan 2009; Murra 1972; Schiapacasse and Niemeyer 1975). These models explain high-altitude occupation after the introduction of domestic animals (llama, alpaca), but they do not explain the causes behind intensive high-elevation hunter-gatherer occupa­tions due mainly to the difficulty of transposing pastoral models onto hunter-gatherer populations. During the early 1970s, mountain climbers lo­cated two of the most important hunter-gatherer high-elevation sites in the region: Los Peuquenes and El Indfgeno (Lagiglia 1997). After this dis­covery, a more systematic approach to the hunter­gatherer archaeology of the region was under­taken, one which focused on large high-elevation sites with multiple domestic features. Today, five highland archeological localities are under study and several clusters of sites have been identified in the Argentine Andes between 34 ° and 36° SL (Duran et al. 2006; Lagiglia 1997; Neme 2007). El lndfgeno, the focus of this article, contains the largest number (n 133) of hunter-gatherer

habitation structures in the southern Andes. It is located at 3,300 m asl in the alpine tundra zone, close to the Argentina-Chile border. Its charac­teristics are similar to other high elevation sites in the world (Bettinger 1991; Morgan et al. 2012b; Nash 2012; Scharf 2009; Thomas 1982, 1994), making it a good place to address questions about what conditioned human use of high ele­vation areas. In this article, I describe the char­acteristics of El lndfgeno: spatial structure, chronology, subsistence remains, and technolog­ical orientation. These characteristics are used to reconstruct the occupational history and function

of the site within the context of regional settle­ment and subsistence systems. Based on these data, it is argued that the occupation of the site was conditioned perhaps in part by climatic changes but more likely by changes in lowland adaptive patterns. This information is then used to explore more general ideas about human adap­tation to high-elevation environments. 
Environmental Context 
Mountain environments present several charac­
teristics that are limiting to human populations. 
Among these are vertical and patchy biotic zona­
tion, steep topography, pronounced climatic vari­
ability, and unpredictable resource productivity 
and distribution (Aldenderfer 1998; Baker 1968; 
Moran 2000; Pianka 1982; Rhoades and Thomp­
son 1975). These characteristics are common in 
the south-central Andes. The southern Andes also 
have strong effect on climate, most notably in 
creating a pronounced rain shadow to the east of 
the Cordillera (Argentinean side) in contrast to 
the wet western slope (Chilean side). 
Much of the Andean landscape exhibits glacial topography (Corte 1976), especially in areas over 3 ,800 m asl. At these elevations, val­leys are narrow and steeply incised, their upper regions covered by glaciers (Volkheimer 1978). In southern Mendoza Province at elevations above 2,000 m asl the summer season is, for all intents and purposes, nearly nonexistent and the weather is particularly variable due to the re­gion's complex topography (Capitanelli 1972; Solbridg et al. 1984). 
High elevation areas across the region are gen­erally well drained, with abundant creeks and lakes that flow into the Diamante and Atuel rivers. Precipitation on the eastern slope ranges from 300 mm at lower elevations to 800 mm at higher elevations (mainly as snow in the winter) (Abra­ham 2000; Volkheimer 1978). Average annual temperature is 9°C at Laguna El Sosneado (2,000 m asl) and 0°C at 3,000 m asl. In this higher area, maximum and minimum temperatures are 25°C and -30°C, respectively. At this latitude (33° SL) the limit of biotic productivity is ca. 3,700 m asl (Abraham 2000; Bacher et al. 1972; Cabrera 1976) and glaciers are common above ca. 3,800 
m asl. 
High-elevation flora is typical for the Altoan­
dina phytogeographic province, but plant distri­
bution and abundance are also strongly condi­
tioned by soils, water traps, and insolation 
(Bacher et al. 1972; Roig 1972). For these rea­
sons, vegetation cover is rare at higher altitudes, 
where plants consist mainly of shrubs and grami­
neous steppe taxa with some areas covered by 
meadows and lichens. Asteracea and Poacea are 
the main families represented at this altitude; 
common genera are Azarella and Oxalis (Bocher 
et al. 1972; Roig 1972). Most of the plant species 
have well developed roots and stems adapted to 
cold, xeric, windy conditions (Cabrera 1976; Roig 
1960). Berberis empetrifolia is the highest-ele­
vation plant resource exploited by Andean hunter­
gatherers for subsistence; it is found at elevations 
as high as ca. 3,000 m asl. Other important sub­
sistence resources like Schinus poligamus, 
Rodophiala rhodolirion, and Senna arnottiana 
grow just below 2,700 m asl. Different species 
of Adesmia spp. were used as firewood, a critical 
resource, which can grow as high as 3,400 m as!. 
Faunal diversity is generally very low in the 
highlands and is characteristic by the Fauna de 
Grandes Alturas (Roig 1972). lt consists mainly 
of two large animals: guanaco (Lama guanicoe) 
and mountain lion (Puma concolor). It also in­
cludes lizards (Liolaemus genus), rodents 
(Akodon spp. and Phillotys spp.), and birds (e.g., 
Chloephaga picta, Merganetta armata, Attagis 
gaily, and Vultur gryphus) . 
Paleoenvironment 
On the eastern side of the Andes (at ca. 33° SL), paleoenvironmental reconstructions are based on scant palynological, charcoal, glacial, and sedi­mentological proxy data with generally coarse tem­poral resolution (D' antoni 1983; Markgraf 1983; Navarro and Whitlock 2010; Sting! and Garleff 1985; Tripaldi et al. 2012; Zarate 2002). These data extend back in time to ca. 3000 B.P. The main climatic variation seen in these data over three millennia is glacial advance occurring ca. 400 B .P., likely associated with the Little Ice Age (Espizua 2005; Stingl and Garleff 1985). Based on the char­coal and palynological record in Laguna El Sos­neado (located 38 km from El lndfgeno), wetter 
and colder conditions also prevailed ca. 2500-2000 cal B.P. (Navarro and Whitlock 20 10).

Higher resolution climate records are found outside the Andes in Chile. These include marine sedimentary records from the Pacific coast and lake cores from Laguna Aculeo and Laguna Chepical (Jenny et al. 2002; Jong et al. 2013; Lamy et al. 1999, 2002). There is some consis­tency between these records and those from the eastern Andes. In Chile and in the high Andes, climate was generally colder and more mesic over the last 2000 years when compared to the entire Holocene (Jenny et al. 2002; Jong et al. 2013; Lamy et al. 2002). A drier period was de­tected in Laguna Aculeo between 200 B .C. and 
A.D. 
200, followed by five periods of flooding: 

A.D. 
200-400, A.D. 500-700, A.D. 1300-1700, 

A.D. 
1400-1600 and 1850-1998, the last being the most pronounced (Jenny et al. 2002). The au­thors relate these events to the increased intensity of the Westerlies between ca. A.D. 200 and 950, concurrent with increased lake levels and biotic productivity (Jenny et al. 2002). Around A.D. 950-1930 the frequency and intensity of flood events increased, as well, especially ca. A.D. 1300-1700 and 1850-1930. These events corre­spond to the Little Ice Age signal detected by different proxy records in central Chile (Jenny et al. 2002; Jong et al. 2013; Lamy et al. 2002). Fi­nally, late Holocene climatic conditions, espe­cially during the last 2,000 years, were marked by stronger and more frequent ENSO events, which increased the overall variability of the cli­matic system of the southern hemisphere (Jenny et al. 2002; Lamy et al. 1999). 


Unfortunately, the regional paleoenvironmen­tal record lacks the resolution to reconstruct spe­cific plant and animal communities over the last 3,000 years, but the magnitude of climatic varia­tion during the time when El Indfgeno was occu­pied likely affected these communities. I can only speculate about how much biotic composition, density, and distribution varied over this time, but by ca. 1500 B.P., when El Indfgeno's occu­pation began, ENSO-related flood events in­creased, indicating more mesic conditions (Jenny et al. 2002; Lamy et al. 1999). Mesic conditions would likely increase vegetation cover, especially in valley bottoms. However, increases in precip­itation at higher altitudes could have the inverse effect because more snow cover might reduce growing season and consequently restrict plant productivity, which would keep herbivore (i.e., guanaco) populations in check. 
Regional Archaeological Background 
The first southern Andean occupations date to ca. 9000 B .P. and spread rapidly thereafter across most mountain ecozones below 2,500 m asl. The higher elevation zones, on both the western and eastern slopes, were essentially unoccupied until ca. 2000 B.P. At this time, some high valleys above 2,500 m asl began to be exploited by hu­man populations from both the western and east­ern Andean slopes (Cornejo and Sanhuesa 2003; Neme and Gil 2008). In central Chile, some agri­cultural societies appeared. Their material inven­tories include the Llolleo, Bato, and later Aconcagua complexes (Falabella and Stehberg 1989; Falabella et al. 2007). However, Cornejo and Sanhueza (2003, 2011) argue that central Chilean mountain ecosystems (from ca. 1,200 to ca. 3,500 m asl) were exclusively occupied by hunter-gatherers who had frequent interactions with their farming neighbors. From this perspec­tive, the only access agricultural groups had to mountain resources was through the hunter-gath­erer groups that lived in and exploited mountain ecosystems. 
This is not an anomalous situation. As different ethnographic and archaeological studies demon­strate that agriculturalists living in frontier zones often interacted closely with their hunter-gatherer neighbors, with whom they traded and, in some cases, upon whom they depended for survival (Headland and Reid 1989; Layton et al. 1991; Spielman and Eder 1994; Winterhalder and Goland 1997). It is therefore likely that domestic plants found at sites attributed to hunter-gatherers were acquired through exchange. In central west­ern Argentina, however, hunting and gathering remained the dominant subsistence pattern, both in the Andes and on the plains until the arrival of the Spanish (Gil et al. 2011; Llano et al. 2011). 
The first high-elevation archaeological work in the region began in the 1970s when El Indfgeno was discovered. The San Rafael Natural History Museum organized the first fieldwork at the site, which included a preliminary survey and exca­vation (Lagiglia 1997). Three other high-elevation sites were excavated after El Indfgeno: Laguna

el Diamante, Los Peuquenes, and Risco de los Indios. All four sites are characterized by prox­imity to mountain passes, habitation structures, late occupation periods (between ca. 1900 and 300 B.P.), abundant pottery, and the presence of non-local goods like shells from the Pacific coast, plants from the Andean forest, and pottery from central Chile (Duran et al. 2006; Neme 2007; Neme et al. 2015). 
All the high-altitude archaeological sites from southern Mendoza are believed to represent hunter-gatherer occupations. There is no evidence for other kinds of activities like pastoralism, min­ing, or defense (Duran et al. 2006; Lagiglia 1997; Neme 2007). The nearest Argentinean sites con­taining evidence for these types of activities are in northern Mendoza and San Juan, ca. 200 km from El Indfgeno (Barcena 2001; Michieli 2009) and in central Chile (ca. 100 km from El Indfgeno, over high Andean passes); the latter post-date the arrival of the Inca in the region (Stehberg 1992). There is, however, one osteometric study that connects Diamante River watershed archaeolog­ical sites to pastoral groups (Gasco 2012) but it relies on only three specimens of several hundred identified at the site. Considering problems related to osteometric methodology (L'Heureux 2010; Yacobaccio 2010) and the absence of other indi­cators of pastoralism (e.g., corrals, dung deposits, etc.) a pastoralist assignation for these fauna} samples must be considered extremely tentative at this time. 
By the time the first high-elevation sites in the Diamante River area were occupied ca. 2000 B.P., other important changes in human behavior had taken place across the greater region. Most of these relate to changes in subsistence. Most notable is a greater focus on hunting smaller and more diverse animal species (Neme 2007; Neme and Gil 2008). This was accompanied by similar changes in plant exploitation, where smaller and more costly-to-process taxa were included in regional diets (Llano 2010; Llano et al. 2011). Changes in technology include the adoption of pottery and the bow and arrow, as well as an increase in long-distance material conveyance (Duran 2000; Giesso et al. 2011; Neme and Gil 2008). 
El lndigeno 
El Indfgeno is located at 3 ,300 m asl on a basalt flow within a meadow watered by a creek, which flows to the Barroso River, a tributary of the Dia­mante River (Figure 1). The basalt is highly weathered, and the site is covered by clasts de­rived from this flow that were used to build its structures. The basalt flow causes the creek to form several small ponds and sediment traps, which has allowed soils to develop near the creek and resulted in the formation of the meadow. The presence of Adesmia spp.-commonly used as firewood-makes the meadow particularly at­tractive to human habitation. The basalt flow also protects the site area from high winds and retains heat from the sun well into the afternoon and evening on summer days. 
The main part of the site is composed of 133 structures running roughly north-south along the creek (Figures 2 and 3); the structures cluster into six main groups. The maximum length and width of the site are 225 m and 135 m, respectively, for a total area of ca. 30,000 m2• Four clusters of structures contain only two or three habitation structures each, and are spread across the basalt flow in an area of ca. 1.4 km2 (Neme 2007). Two of the site's structures are U-shaped, the rest are semicircular with an average diameter of 4 m (Figure 4). 
Previous Research 
The initial fieldwork at the site took place in 1973 when four circular structures were excavated (Structures 17, 18, 21, and 52) (Lagiglia 1997; Lagiglia et al. 1994). Only one of the structures was completely excavated (Structure 17); in the others, small test pits were dug. All excavations were conducted using 10 cm arbitrary levels. Dur­ing the excavation, soil and sediments were sieved using 5 mm mesh, no flotation samples were taken, and only a sample of the better-preserved fauna! material was collected. Excavations pro­duced copious amounts of sherds, stone tools, and debitage. Some of the more interesting sur­face finds were nine complete pots, which were found turned upside-down (Figure 5), one with half a squash (Lagenaria siceraria) inside (Lagiglia 1997). Nearly every structure was

equipped with manos and milling stones. 
Stone tools recovered during the initial exca­vations included scrapers, projectile points, and flakes made of basalt, obsidian, chalcedony, sand­stone, quartzite, and rhyolite. The notched trian­gular projectile points (Figure 5) were made from obsidian and date to the last 2,000 years B.P. (Duran 2000). One charcoal sample from Struc­ture 17, level 2 ( 10-20 cm) was radiocarbon dated to 980 ± 90 rcy B.P. (900 ± 90 cal B.P. [at 1 sigma]) (Lagiglia et al.1994). This date is con­sistent with the age of the Aconcagua style pottery found in the same level. 
Pottery included southern Mendoza types like Overo (Figure 5) and Central Chilean types like Llolleo, Aconcagua, and Diaguita chilena, among others (Lagiglia 1997; Falabella et al. 2001; San­hueza et al. 2004). The shape of the pottery con­tainers included bowls (escudillas), pots, and ves­sels. The abundance of pottery from the western slope led Falabella et al. (200 l) to argue that the site was occupied by groups from central Chile. 
Lagiglia (1997) obtained a small archaeofaunal sample from Structure 52 (Table 1), which shows a focus on hunting big game, mainly guanaco, supplemented by a small quantity of migratory birds (probably Chloephaga picta) (Neme 2007). The guanaco age profile shows a high frequency (41 percent) of young specimens (juvenile and neonates). Unfortunately the fauna! sample was poorly preserved and not all the bones unearthed were collected. Given the 5 mm mesh size, it is

Two units were excavated in the interior of Structure 96: A-1 (1 x 1 m) and B-2 (2 x 2 m). Ex­cavations proceeded in 5 cm arbitrary levels with all matrix passed through 2 mm mesh. Five-liter flotation samples were collected from each level. Five natural strata were identified (Figure 7), all composed mainly of sandy deposits (Neme 2007). 
The excavation continued until sterile sedi­ments were encountered: 45 cm below surface (9 arbitrary levels) in unit A-1, and 55 cm below surface (11 levels) in unit B-1. Four radiocarbon dates were generated, three from hearth charcoal samples and the fourth from a maize cob (Table 2 and Figure 8). These assign Structure 96 a date between ca. 1500 and 850 B.P. (1390-800 cal 
B.P.

Lithic artifacts consist of one triangular notched obsidian projectile point dating to the Late Pre­historic Period (last 2,000 years B.P.), one basalt core, and 64 flakes. The latter are comprised of obsidian (38 percent), chert (29 percent), basalt (15 percent), quartzite (10 percent), and rhyolite (3 percent), as well as undetermined (5 percent) stone. Obsidian sourcing (using XRF) of three samples indicates one was derived from a source within the south (Las Cargas, some 90 km south of El lndfgeno ); the other two samples originated from an unknown source (Duran et al. 2004). Flake types range from primary flakes to pressure flakes and retouch chips, indicating core reduction, tool manufacture, and tool maintenance. 
A total of 162 sherds were recovered. These are classed as Overo and Llolleo types, which are found on both the eastern and western slopes

Lagenaria siceraria (epicarp), two cfr. Empetrum rubrum (fruit), and two are unidentified speci­mens. Empetrum rubrum (wild) is the only spec­imen endemic to the alpine zone; the remainder had to have been transported from much lower elevations (the closest sites with domesticates are located some 60 km west of the highest peaks in central Chile). Adornments were recovered as well: one steatite labret and 115 stone beads neck­laces. One infant incisor also was recovered. 
Discussion 
El Indfgeno appears to have been repeatedly oc­cupied by mobile hunter-gatherers between 1400 and 800 years ago, in part due to the many bene­fits of the site's setting: water, abundant materials for building structures, protection from the wind, access to firewood, gentle topography, exposure conducive to melting snow earlier than nearby locales, pasture for guanaco, and ponds that draw migratory birds. One of the most important of these factors is access to firewood, which can be particularly limited in alpine settings. However, it is important to note that even though there are considerable local incentives for occupying El lndfgeno, the site setting remains marginal com­pared to lower elevation settings. Its high eleva­tion requires human populations to cope with hy­poxia, increased caloric requirements, cold temperatures, wind, insulation, and uncertainty with regard to climatic conditions. In fact, incen­tives such as those found at El lndfgeno are ex­ceedingly rare above 2,500 m asl, and it is clear that El lndfgeno is one of the few places in the greater region where this many beneficial envi­ronmental characteristics occur together. 
Site History and Function 
The chronology of the excavated structures, the differences in ceramic types, and the variability in structural preservation (which is better in the southern portion of the site) suggests that the structures were not built and occupied contem­poraneously. On the contrary, different groups likely added new structures to the site over time. Apparently some of the younger structures were made using materials from older structures, which is why the younger ones in the south are better preserved than those in the northern portion of the site. 
Given the nature of the fauna! remains at El Indfgeno, it is clear that guanaco hunting was the principal subsistence activity associated with the site and that hunting large fauna was the main reason why hunter-gatherers in this region ex­ploited highland environments. The artiodactyl index for all of the high elevation sites studied in the region (El Indfgeno, Los Peuquenes, and La­guna del Diamante) is over 90 percent, showing

very clearly that the exploitation of high-return resources like guanaco was the subsistence focus at these sites (Neme et al. 2013). 
However, plant processing was important, as well, as shown by the macrofloral remains and the manos and milling stones associated with each structure. The diversity and composition of the site features and artifact assemblages conse­quently suggest that it was not simply a logistical, ostensibly male-oriented hunting site. On the con­trary, the high frequency of processing equipment, pottery, and seeds indicate that family groups likely occupied the site. 
It is clear that at El lndfgeno hunting was sup­plemented by the use of vegetal resources from lower elevations. These might include the central

valleys of Chile (i.e., domesticates like Zea mays) or wild resources (e.g., Empetrum rubrum) from lower ecozones to the east and west of the site. In an interestingly analogous situation, research in North America's Great Basin indicates that oc­cupants of alpine villages (Bettinger 1991; Mor­gan et al. 2012b; Nash 2012; Thomas 1982) sub­sidized their diet with lowland resources, not only to lengthen their stay in high-elevation places, but also to reduce risk when travelling through the mountains (Nash 2012; Scharf 2009). This appears to also be the case at El Indfgeno, where the travel costs associated with accessing the site from lowland settings are quite high. 
Another important activity was exchange of non-local goods coming from at least 300 km away. Some of this material (Zea mays, Lagenaria, Empetrum, obsidian, silica, steatite, pottery, and mollusk shells) was brought to the site from lower elevations and probably originated with groups other than El Indfgeno's inhabitants. The first Spanish explorers who arrived in the region men­tioned that hunter-gatherers from southern Men­doza went to the western slope of the Andes in Chile every summer to meet people and exchange maize, blankets, feathers, salt, and pottery (Bibar 1966). 
Seasonality and Mobility 
Given the several meters of snow that cover the site from early autumn to late spring (some years even longer), environmental conditions largely preclude all but summer occupations of El In­dfgeno. Summer occupations are further indicated by guanaco age profiles from the site, which are marked by an abundance of juveniles. This cor­responds to archaeofaunal data from other Andean "villages" in the region, in which over 60 percent of the guanaco bone consisted of juvenile indi­victuals. These high proportions of immature spec­imens could be understated, given that weathering tends to destroy immature specimens of less dense bone (Gonzalez et al. 2012). 
I contend that the seasonality of the occupation of El lndfgeno, the environmental limitations of the high-altitude environment, and the conveyance of extralocal goods (especially volcanic toolstone) indicate that the people who occupied this and other similar sites spent a considerable portion of the year in the lower elevation Diamante and Atuel river valleys on the eastern slope of the Andes. Many of the resources (obsidian and lower-ele­vation wild plant foods) that were transported to El Indfgeno are available on the piedmont and in the intermontane valleys on the eastern slope of the Andes, below the worst of the winter snow, between 1,600 and 2,500 m asl. Importantly, such a transhumance system would not require trips onto the plains east of the Andes, as some re­searchers have suggested (Lagiglia 1997). 
However, it is also likely that the site was oc­cupied or at least visited by groups from both sides of the Andes, especially when taking into consideration the fact that sharing territories is common for peoples who live in high-elevation environments (Aldenderfer 1998; Orlove and Guillet 1985). The presence of Chilean pottery and mollusk shells from the Pacific coast lends support to this scenario, as does the presence of domesticates in the deposits at El Indfgeno. Be­cause research conducted in the Chilean high­mountain region suggests that the populations who inhabited the high Chilean Andes never adopted farming (Cornejo and Sanhueza 2003, 2011), the presence of domesticates and Chilean pottery styles must be related to interaction be­tween western lowland farmers and highland hunter-gatherer populations.

The Origins of Mountain Villages 
El Indfgeno was occupied between 1500 and 800 
B .P. Other smaller high elevation sites with sim­ilar characteristics suggest this "village" pattern began in the southern Mendoza region around 2000 B.P. (Duran et al. 2006; Neme 2007). This pattern included not only travel to distant high­elevation resource patches, but also a substantial amount of labor invested in constructing the mul­tiple structures found at these sites. This elicits the question: why did people begin intensively exploiting and seasonally residing in these high­elevation marginal environments at some point around 2000 B.P. and not before? 
One possible explanation is a climatic shift that could have changed the relative return rates between the lower and higher elevation resource patches. In this sense, an improvement in the bi­otic productivity of high-elevation patches or a decrease in biotic productivity at lower elevations could make the alpine zone more attractive, es­sentially "pulling" (in the former case) or "push­ing" (in the latter) humans to more intensively occupy the high Andes. There indeed appears to be some superficial temporal correlations between changes in the environment and human occupa­tion. The first occupations (ca. 1400 cal B.P.) of El Indfgeno are contemporaneous with one of the wetter periods in the last 2,000 years (Jenny et al. 2002; Navarro and Whitlock 2010). Cessation of regular use of the site (ca. 800 cal B .P.) could also arguably be linked to the harsher climatic condition associated with the onset of the Little Ice Age (although the most recent dates from El Indfgeno are roughly 150-200 years too old) (Jenny et al. 2002; Jong et al. 2013; Lamy et al. 2002; Stingl and Garleff 1985). 
Attributing a causal relationship to these very rough temporal correlations between climate and the history of human occupations is confounded by other paleoclimatic data from the Andes. First, the paleoclimatic record indicates that there were several wet episodes over the last 2,000 years that do not correspond to alpine village occupa­tions (Jenny et al. 2002; de Jong et al. 2013; Lamy et al. 2002; Navarro and Whitlock 2010). More importantly, the onset of human occupations at El Diamante, another high-elevation site in the southern Mendoza region, matches the driest rec­ognized period in the sequence at ca. 2100 B.P. 
(Duran et al. 2006; Jenny et al. 2002; Lamy et al. 2002). In this case, the beginning of human oc­cupation at the oldest high-elevation sites (Laguna El Diamante and El lndfgeno) would have dia­metrically opposed climatic triggers (wet vs. dry), consequently weakening gross environmental change explanations for intensive human occu­pation of the Andean alpine zone. 
Alternative explanations for the processes that drove high-elevation intensification are found in the lowlands (Bettinger 1994, 2000). Approxi­mately 2,000 years ago, a series of important changes occurred in the lifeways of populations living in southern Mendoza. These include alter­ations in technological, subsistence, and settle­ment patterns, which were apparently forced by an imbalance between population and resources (Neme 2007; Neme and Gil 2008). First, there was a decrease in the artiodactyl index through time in the south-central Argentinean Andes be­ginning ca. 2000 B .P. concurrent with an increase in the exploitation of smaller, lower-ranked species (Neme 2007; Otaola et al. 2012). A similar process has been recognized for plant resources: there was a decline in the proportion of high re­turn rate plants (Schinus ssp., Prosopis ssp. and Geofroea sp.) through time and new plant species began to be exploited, widening diet breadth (Llano 2010; Llano et al. 2011). These new plants include those domesticated prior to and around ca. 2000 B .P. outside the Andes (Zea mays, Lagenaria sp., Phaseolus sp., Chenopodium sp,. and Cucurbita sp.) and ca. 1000 B.P. in the moun­tains (Zea mays and Lagenaria sp.) (Hernandez 2002; Lagiglia 1968; Llano 2010). The meaning and the importance of the domestication process on the eastern slope of the Andes is still under debate (Gil 2006, 2003; Gil et al. 2014), but the data suggest that human populations were ex­panding dietary range, likely in response to in­creasing population density (i.e., "intensification sensu stricto [s.s.]" per Morgan 2015). If true, this situation resembles that seen in the alpine zone of the Uinta Mountains of northeastern Utah during the Formative Period. Here, maize inten­sification has been linked not only to increasing human population densities in the lowlands, but also to more intensive exploitation of mountain environments made possible, in part, by trans­porting maize into the mountains as a way of

subsidizing hunting and increasing hunting re­turns (Nash 2012; see also Morgan et al. 2012a). 
Scharf (2009) challenges the argument that environmentally-mediated, increased return rates in high-elevation patches incentivized high-ele­vation land use based on evidence from the White Mountains in California. Scharf argues that pop­ulation pressure at lower elevations incentivized people to carry seeds, a costly endeavor, from lower elevations to sustain populations in alpine locales. At El Indfgeno there is no evidence for the use of local, high-elevation plant resources that might suggest an improvement of highland plant productivity. On the contrary, the macrob­otanical remains recovered from El Indfgeno (as well as from other high-elevation sites in southern Mendoza) indicate that people transported wild and domestic plant resources (Schinus sp., Empetrum rubrum, Berberis empetrifolia, Zea mays, Cucurbita sp.) from lower elevations. Given the correlation between the floral and fau­na! assemblages at El Indfgeno, it appears that increased population density in the lowlands helped drive these phenomena. 
Additional support for the argument of in­creased population densities in the lowlands comes in the form of archaeological evidence from southern Mendoza whereas the number of archaeological sites and radiocarbon dates rises sharply between 2000 and 1000 B.P. (Neme and Gil 2009, 2012). Isotopic studies suggest signif­icant changes in human diet during this period, particularly towards eating a wider variety of re­sources and more C4 plants (possibly maize) (Gil et al. 2011, 2014). Zooarchaeological data from both high and low-elevation sites display evidence for bulk animal processing strategies (sensu Bin­ford 1978; Metcalfe and Jones 1988) and con­siderable bone fragmentation, both strongly sug­gestive of intensive animal processing. Increased dietary range, intensive carcass processing, and increase in site numbers, particularly at lower el­evations, are all consistent with the idea that an imbalance between human populations and re­sources triggered more intensive human occupa­tion and exploitation of Andean high-elevation ecosystems between roughly 2000 and 1000 B.P. (Neme 2007; Neme and Gil 2008). 
Final Remarks 
El lndfgeno and other high-elevation "village" sites in southern Mendoza indicate that their oc­cupants had a deep knowledge of the Andean landscape and its resources, even in particularly limiting alpine tundra ecosystems. These sites appear to have been occupied on a seasonal basis by mobile populations whose primary economic activity was guanaco hunting supplemented by plant foods, many of which were transported to the highlands from lower elevations. Extralocal obsidian, ceramics, and domestic and wild macrofloral remains indicate this seasonal round extended to both the western and eastern sides of the Andes, likely undertaken by different groups operating out of both Chile and Argentina (Cornejo and Sanhueza 2003, 2011; Lagiglia 1977; Neme and Gil 2008). Only in northern Mendoza province and in the west-central valleys of Chile were there farmers from whom transhu­mant Andean hunter-gatherers could have ob­tained the domesticated plants found in high-ele­vation residential sites like El Indfgeno. 
The hunting of large fauna is similar to patterns seen around the world in high-elevation settings (Grayson 1991; Madsen et al. 2000; Nash 2012; Zeanah 2000). The advantage of high-elevation "village" sites for the hunting of large fauna might be explained by (1) the transport costs involved in moving captured prey after the kill and (2) the higher caloric costs of operating in high-elevation settings; both would increase the amount of en­ergy needed to exploit these types of resources. The cost of transportation would decrease the closer human predators got to the home ranges of targeted prey, which, in turn, might explain the proliferation of high elevation "village" sites in the Andes in the Late Holocene (sensu Morgan et al. 2012a). By necessity, hunters would have to target high rather than low-ranking prey at these locations given the greater caloric returns afforded by such energy-maximizing prey choices (Bettinger et al. 2009:629; Grayson 1991; Madsen et al. 2000; Zeanah 2000). Further, to reduce transport costs for hunted game, entire family groups occupied sites like El Indfgeno, carrying lowland (and in some case cultivated) resources to high-elevation sites for on-site processing, os-

tensibly as a way of subsidizing a diet focused on large game (Morgan 2009; Nash 2012). Such behavior, while entailing substantial residential mobility, would increase hunting returns and de­crease the risks of occupying alpine zones (Mor­gan 2012; Zeanah 2000; but see Grove 2010). 
Both wild and domestic plants from lower el­evations were processed on the site: all the struc­tures were equipped with manos and metates even though there are no edible plants available in the alpine zone of this part of the Andes. We do not yet know the significance of domesticates in the macrofloral assemblages at sites like El Indfgeno, but apparently they were indeed processed and consumed there (they were burnt). Researchers working in high-elevation areas in North America suggest that transported, low-elevation plant foods (including maize) helped sustain people at high altitudes for longer periods of time than if such resources were not transported to the high­lands (Morgan 2008; Nash 2012; Scharf 2009). The transport of low-elevation resources conse­quently would reduce the risk of focusing mainly on large game in such marginally-productive en­vironments. At the same time, this would increase the likelihood of successful hunts simply as a function of increased residence time in the area (Morgan 2009; Nash 2012). 
The archaeological and ethnohistoric record of southern Mendoza indicates that El lndfgeno 's occupants obtained domesticates via exchange, most likely from farmers to the west, in what is modern-day Chile (Duran 2000; Michieli 1983). This assertion is supported by the proximity of El Indfgeno to the Las Leiias pass (4,200 m asl), which likely facilitated exchange between popu­lations from both side of the Andes and increased the diversity of goods seen in the archaeological record at the site. Given that the meadow in which El Indfgeno is located is isolated from other pro­ductive patches and is the only locus where fire­wood is plentiful in the area, it is perhaps not surprising that the site was reoccupied and used intensively over the course of its occupational 
history. 
By ca. 1500 B.P. when El Indfgeno was first occupied, other similar sites were also being used (e.g., Laguna del Diamante 2), especially along the Cordillera (e.g., LD-S4, LD-S 1, Risco de los Indios and Los Peuquenes) (Duran et al. 2006; Neme 2007). I argue that this intensification of seasonal highland residential occupations was brought about by increasing demographic pres­sure in lower-elevation valleys, especially on the western side of the Andes. This resulted in do­mesticates (mainly maize) becoming the domi­nant staple in these valleys, at the expense of game and wild plants, as indicated by the archae­ological and isotopic record (Fallabela and Ste­hberg 1989; Falabella et al. 2007). On the eastern slope of the Andes, however, hunting and gath­ering remained the dominant subsistence strategy, although several indications suggest that new re­sources were also being incorporated into regional diets, making them both broader and more costly (Gil et al. 2010, 2011; Llano et al. 2010; Neme 2007). Per this model, population packing and affiliated subsistence intensification on both sides of the Andes appear to have pushed people to in­tensify their seasonal exploitation of marginal Andean environments above 3 ,000 m asl. Further research at high elevations and in the lower-ele­vation valleys in and around the southern Andes are clearly called for in order to confirm or discard this hypothesis.
