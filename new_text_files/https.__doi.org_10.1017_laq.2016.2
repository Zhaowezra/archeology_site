We present data produced through archaeological and geological survey, as well as geochemical analysis of the Zaragoza-Oyameles obsidian source area located on the northern and western .anks of the Los Humeros Caldera in eastern Puebla, Mexico. One result of the intensive archaeological surface survey of this obsidian source area was the identi.cation of 117 obsidian .ow-band exposures. Geologic samples from 40 of these were submitted for instrumental neutron activation analysis. Eighty-.ve projectile points collected from the surface were characterized using portable X-ray .uorescence. These analyses identi.ed three sub-sources: Z-O1, Potreros Caldera, and Gomez Sur. The Gomez Sur sub-source appears chemically similar to the previously identi.ed Altotonga source, located 25 km to the northeast. Results of the geological survey help elucidate the relationship of Altotonga obsidian with the Zaragoza-Oyameles source area. The data from the three sub-sources are compared to all consumer site data attributed to the Zaragoza-Oyameles source in the Missouri University Research Reactor database. Results indicate that the majority of consumer samples throughout Mesoamerica match the Z-O1 sub-source, while 4 percent match the Potreros Caldera sub-source. This information, combined with the Gomez Sur data, is discussed in terms of economic relations with the regional center of Cantona. Obsidian procurement and distribution may have been more nuanced than previously modeled. We suggest that a number of potentially independent communities in addition to Cantona may have been involved in distributing this obsidian throughout Mesoamerica. 
En este trabajo se presentan los resultados de un relevamiento arqueológico y geológico y de análisis geoquímicos del área de la fuente de obsidiana Zaragoza-Oyameles, localizada en los .ancos norte y oeste de la caldera de Los Humeros, en el oriente del estado de Puebla, México. Uno de los resultados del relevamiento arqueológico intensivo de super.cie fue la identi.cación de 117 bandas expuestas de .ujo de obsidiana. De éstas, se sometieron 40 muestras geológicas al análisis instrumental por activación neutrónica. Adicionalmente, se analizó la composición elemental de 85 puntas de proyectil halladas en super.cie usando un equipo portátil de .uorescencia de rayos X. Estos análisis identi.caron tres sub-fuentes: Z-O1, Potreros Caldera y Gómez Sur. La sub-fuente Gómez Sur es químicamente similar a la fuente de obsidiana previamente identi.cada de Altotonga, localizada 25 kilómetros hacia el noreste. Los resultados del reconocimiento geológico ayudan a esclarecer la relación entre la obsidiana de Altotonga y la del área de la fuente de Zaragoza-Oyameles. Se comparan los datos de las tres sub-fuentes con la base de datos del University of Missouri Research Reactor, la cual incluye sitios del centro y sureste de México y Guatemala. Los resultados indican que la mayoría de las muestras de artefactos a lo largo de Mesoamérica corresponden a la sub-fuente Z-O1, mientras que el cuatro por ciento corresponde a la sub-fuente Potreros Caldera. Se discute esta información, junto con los datos de la sub-fuente Gómez Sur, en términos de las relaciones económicas con el centro regional de Cantona. Es posible que la adquisición y distribución de obsidiana fueran más importantes para este centro de lo que se pensó antes. La distribución de esta obsidiana a través de Mesoamérica pudo haber involucrado varias estrategias, llevadas a cabo por un número de comunidades potencialmente independientes además de Cantona.

thus on the endpoints of the entire extraction, production, distribution, and consumption sys-tem.Asaresult, theinterpretivestrengthofsuch studiesis vulnerabletothevagariesof base data from geological sources.Therefore,ifthe context ofobsidiansourcedataisquestionableorunclear, sothenareallthesubsequent conclusionsregard­ing the exchange of obsidian attributed to that geologic source area. 
Obsidian .ow systems throughout the world, including Mesoamerica, tend to be large in size, spreading out in numerous directions over tens of kilometers through broad mountainous areas (Balkan-Atli et al. 2011; Binder et al. 2011; Braswell and Glascock 1998; Cobean 2002; Darras 1999; Healan 1997; Knight et al. 2011; Pastrana 1998; Torrence 1986; Tripce­vich and Mackay 2011). Thus, exposures of obsidian bands from the same .ow system can be separated by great distance and signi.cant topographical features.Obsidianfromsuchvast systemsmayincludean arrayofcolors, opacities, and textures, often giving the visual impression of distinct and separatesources.Determining the degree of chemical variation across an obsid­ian source area therefore requires extensive, systematic survey coupled with a program of .ow-band sampling, chemical characterization, and geological mapping (Binder et al. 2011; Braswell and Glascock 1998;Cobean2002:31– 37).For instance, Binder and colleagues(2011) have distinguished seven chemically distinct sub-sources of the Göllüda.g obsidian .ow in centralTurkeythroughacomprehensiveprogram of geological survey and geochemical analysis. Similarly, multi-technique geochemical analy­sis facilitated the identi.cation of several sub-sources within theAlca.ow systemin southern Peru(Rademakeretal. 2013).Attheexpansive source areaofSan Martín Jilotepequeinhighland Guatemala, Braswell’s(Braswell and Glascock 1998) extensive geological and archaeological surveyof 280 km2, combined with geochemical and statistical analyses, distinguished six sub-sources and discriminated, with a high statis­tical con.dence, two principal quarry systems within thesource area. Thephysical constraints of obsidian source areas may explain some of the variability encountered in the chronological and geographical extent of their exploitation throughout the ancient past. The development of more intensive and multidisciplinary studies combining archaeology, geology, and geochem­istryallows foranincreased understanding and resolutionof episodesof obsidianprocurement and regional obsidiandistribution. 
Muchof thereference poolof Mesoamerican obsidian that has been used in instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA) and X-ray .uorescence (XRF) analysis since the 1980s stemsfromthe intensive collection of geologic samples undertakenbyRobertCobean andTer­rance Stocker in 1969 and 1980 (Cobean 2002; Cobean et al. 1971, 1991). The geological sam­pling was part of the University of Missouri obsidian program, in conjunction with James Vogt and Michael Glascock of the Missouri University Research Reactor (MURR) (Clark 2003:19; Cobean 2002:19–21, 35–37).The sam­plingprogram resultedinthe collectionof over 800 source samples. Since that time, only a handfulof systematicand comprehensivestudies of the same source areas have occurred. Those that have been conducted have increased the representative samples from the areas and, as a result, have identi.ed internal source varia­tion(e.g.,Braswell and Glascock 1998;Healan 1997), which allows a better understanding of how and when obsidian procurement was organized. 


TheZaragoza-Oyameles SourceArea 
TheZaragoza-Oyameles obsidiansource areain theCuenca Orientalof Puebla,Mexico,wasini­tially sampledbyCobeaninthe 1980s(Figure1). Priortothat time, thelocationofthe Zaragoza-Oyameles source was unknown and thus clas­si.ed as Group C/C1 in XRF characterization studies (Cobean et al. 1991:73). The .rst sites to be identi.ed with obsidian from the source area were Olmec and date to the Early For­mative period(Cobean et al. 1971).A total of 53 geologic samples were collected by Cobean over eight or nine days from four loci in the source area (Glascock and Cobean 2002:242– 243). These four loci include the “Zaragoza” and “Oyameles” sections of the source area. In the “Zaragoza” section, the collection locus was identi.ed as the “Barranca canto—1 km

obsidianexposures,but also fromfour additional exposures between the towns of Oyameles and Zaragoza. Chemically, the obsidian from all of those exposures is identical, suggesting that all the obsidianthat contributedtoCobean’s “Bar­ranca canto—1kmaloeste del pueblo” samples is the same. Thus, all the geologic samples of Zaragoza-Oyameles obsidianusedbyMURRin comparative characterizationstudies comefrom Cobean’s original collections, which come from one related.ow-band system.Since thoseinitial collections, several other programs of chemical characterization have been undertaken at the source area. García Cook and colleagues(2010) analyzed 17 samples collected from various exposures and sites acrossthe source area using abbreviated INAA. Beyond this, the Zaragoza-Oyameles source samples characterized by Car­ballo(2011:167; Carballo et al. 2007), Jiménez-Reyes and colleagues(2001),and Millhauser and colleagues(2015), all came from spotswithin thesource area encompassedbyoneof Cobean’s “Oyameles” collection areas. 
In 2012, the senior author initiated the Zaragoza-Oyameles Regional Obsidian Source Survey.Twoof theproject goalsweretoexpand thereference baseofsource samples and to con­ductan archaeological surveyofthesource area. Wepresent dataonthe chemical characterization by INAA of 40 source samples and by XRF of 85 artifacts fromthe Zaragoza-Oyameles source area, in which three Zaragoza-Oyameles sub-sources were identi.ed. The chemical signatures of thesethree distinct sub-sources arethen com­pared to theINAAand XRF datainthe MURR database fromthroughout westernMesoamerica in order to identify chronological and geograph­ical patterns of source exploitation and examine what this implies about interregional exchange systems. 
Geological Background 
The obsidian quarried by prehispanic people at the Zaragoza-Oyameles source area is part of what is geologically termed theZaragoza .ow, also called the Cantonac .ow by Ferriz and Mahood(1984). TheZaragoza .ow lieswithin the Los Humeros Volcanic center, located in the eastern partof theTrans-MexicanVolcanic Belt (TMVB), an east-west oriented geologic province that extends across central Mexico (Figure2) and contains more than 20 active volcanoes.Theevolutionofthe TMVBisdivided into four main episodes of magmatism based on the chemical composition change of dom­inating volcanic activity (Gómez-Tuena et al. 2007:130). 
Activitiesinthe LosHumerosvolcanic .eld began more than 1.6 mya and continued to as recently as 0.02 mya (Ferriz and Mahood 1984; Figure3). The .eld became active and entered the .rst stage at more than 1.6 mya, culminating with the eruption of the rhyolitic Xaltipan Tuff and the formation of the Los Humeros Caldera at 0.46 mya (Ferriz 1985). Post-caldera rhyolitic activity occurred between 
0.36 and 0.22(±0.02) mya with (biotite) rhy­olitic domes, including Cerro San Antonio on the edge of the later formed Potreros Caldera. The Potreros Caldera is an aphanitic rhyolitic .ow and thesource of theZaragoza-Oyameles obsidian .ow, which formed after the eruption of the Zaragoza Tuff at around 0.1 mya. This wasfollowedbythe eruptionoftwohypersthene rhyolite domes (Xonocuatla and the unnamed domeonthe westernsideofXonocuatla)onthe northeastern rimofthe LosHumeros Caldera. 
Archaeological Background 
During the 2012–2014 .eld seasons, 1,543 hectares between themoderntownsof Zaragoza in the north and GuadalupeVictoriain thesouth were intensively surface surveyed(Figure4). The town of Oyameles de Hidalgo lies in the center of the survey zone. Zaragoza-Oyameles obsidian has been recovered from consumer site occupations dating to the Early or Middle Formative period contextsin thesouthernGulf Lowlands (Cobean et al. 1971;Hirth et al.2013; Pooletal. 2014;Santleyet al. 2001),theLower RioVerdeValley ofOaxaca(Joyceetal. 1995), the Paci.c coast of Guerrero, Mexico (Ebert etal. 2014),andtheTeotihuacanValleyincentral Mexico (Stoner et al. 2015:22).The early distri­butionofZaragoza-Oyameles obsidian parallels the earliest distribution of Altotonga obsidian, which was an important obsidian source in the Earlyand MiddleFormativeperiods acrosswest­ernMesoamerica,but especiallyin thesouthern Gulf Lowlands (Boksenbaum et al. 1987;

Cobean et al. 1971;Pires-Ferreira1976). From the Late Formative period through to the end of theTerminal Classic period(400 B.C.–A.D. 1000) Zaragoza-Oyameles obsidian comprised 80–90 percent of chipped stone assemblages throughout thesouthernGulfLowlands (Esqui­vias 2003; Knight and Glascock 2009; Santley et al 2001; Stark et al. 1992), and became increasingly important elsewhere in western Mesoamerica (Drennan et al. 1990:188–189; Elam 1993; Joyce et al. 1995; Pires-Ferreira 1975;Zeitlin1982). At that time its distribution also included distant sitesinthe Maya area such asTikal (Moholy-Nagyetal. 1984),the northern Maya Lowlands (Braswell 2003:140), and the Paci.c CoastofGuatemala(Bove and Medrano Busto 2003:53). 
The archaeological remains of the ancient cityof Cantona occupy anareaof1,430ha and are located 10 km southeast of the Zaragoza-Oyameles source area (GarcíaCook 2003:315). More than 100 radiocarbon dates have been produced from excavated contexts within the civic-ceremonial core of the city (García Cook and ZamoraRivera 2010:33), datingthe original settlement of Cantona to theMiddleFormative period(ca.600B.C.)whenitwasasmall hamlet. By 300 B.C. the site occupation grew to a population of 10,000 in an area of 200 ha. By about A.D. 400,in thelateEarly Classic period, a population of about 50,000 people occupied an area of 670 ha, and the city reached its apogee of 90,000 inhabitants around A.D. 750, during the Late Classic period (García Cook 2003:339). The last phase of its occupation dates to theTerminal Classic period(ca. A.D. 900/950–1000/1050; García Cook 2003:337). Several authors (Braswell 2003; García Cook 2003, 2014)have suggested that Cantona con­trolledthe quarrying activitiesinthe Zaragoza-Oyameles source area,butthe natureofsuch con­trol is unclear.Braswell(2003:139) emphasizes the proximity of Cantona to the source area as evidence of control, while García Cook focuses on the 350 obsidian-reduction activity areas in a 19 ha zone adjacent to the civic-ceremonial coreof the city (GarcíaCook 2014:107; García Cook et al. 2010:219), especially the “state”

Although thereisnodoubt thataspecial relation­shipexisted between Cantonaandthesource area or that the ebb and .owofZaragoza-Oyameles obsidian consumption acrossMesoamerica par­allelstheriseandfallof Cantona,no modelhas been proposed that describes theroleofCantona in the controlovermaterialprocurement and the initialstagesoftool manufacture.Onegoalofthe surveywasto collect datatoelucidatethe nature of this relationship. 
During survey, seven archaeologists walked parallel transects spaced 5 m apart in plowed .elds.Inthisway,weidenti.ed100 percentofall surface siteswithin thesurveylimits.Depending on the size of a site, either all or a sample of the artifactsvisibleonthesurface were collected.In thelatter case,a10percent samplewasrecovered fromrandomly selected5 × 5 m surface units. 
In non-site areas, all formal surface tools, such as projectile points, cores,bifaces, and scrapers, as well as all ground stone and ceramics, were marked with a handheld Garmin 62s GPS and then collected. In forested regions and streambed slopes,wewalkedparalleltransects10 m apart following slope contoursorcompass points. The survey identi.ed 48 primary reduction sites, 3 habitationsites,50off-quarry sites,117 obsidian exposures, 77 surface extraction pits, and 1 extraction trench. To some degree, the survey covered areas previously and unsystematically surveyedby AlineLara Galicia(2003, 2004). During that reconnaissance surveysheidenti.ed 38 sitesassociated with obsidianreduction(Lara Galicia 2004:28),which shesubdivided into pri­mary,secondary, and tertiary reductionloci.Due todifferent methodologies,speci.csite locations of most sitesidenti.edbyLara Galicia(2004:31, Map 6)could not be con.dently matched with sitesidenti.ed during our survey.

Surface extraction pits are similar to those described by Healan(1997:86–87) as “dough­nut quarries,” or elsewhere as depresiones de extracción (Darras 1999:80–84), pozos de extracción (Pastrana 1998:55), or “funnel-shaped pits” (Cobean 2002:169). We use the term socavón,employedby Lara Galicia(2003, 2004). J. Gregory Smith of Northwest College conductedaprogramof topographicmappingin 2013 and 2014. This focused on known surface extractionfeatures,including socavones and the single, identi.ed trench. 


Obsidian Sampling 
We collected samples from 46 of the 117 obsidian-bandexposuresthatwe identi.ed.Most samples were collected from primary, 1–10 m thick .ow-band exposures. Not all band expo­sures show signs of exploitation or are located near workshops. We submitted 40 source sam­ples to MURR forINAA(Table1).We also assayed 85 projectile pointsbyXRF(Table2). We analyzed thesebifaces becausesomemight be imports fromother source areas.Almostall theprojectile pointswereisolated .nds, and we interpret most as hunting weapons lost in the pine and oak forest that typi.es the Zaragoza-Oyameles source area. 
Following García Cook’s (1967) typology, we recognized severaltypesof projectile points. These include Hidalgo (Early Classic), Peder­nales (Late Classic), Santa Clara (Early-Late Classic), Tecolote (Early-Late Classic), and TexcocoA(Late Classic-Postclassic) points.We also identi.ed Shumla A and Shumla B points (stemmed-B and stemmed-A varieties, respec­tively, in Spence [1996]), which date to the Early and Late Classic periods. ShumlaAandB styleprojectile pointsprobablyare not hunting weapons,andhavebeen associatedwiththemil­itary elite of Teotihuacan (Carballo 2011:133– 145, 159–163; Parry 2014:292; Spence 1996; Sugiyama 1989). They are found throughout centralMexico(García Cook 1967:138, Plate 11, Tables10, 29–33).Chemical characterizationof thesepointswas thereforeimportantto determine whether they were made of local obsidian or were imports from Teotihuacan. The presence of ShumlaAandBprojectiles couldre.ect the needformilitary weaponsat Cantona, interaction between Cantona and centralMexico, or thelocal manufactureofacentralMexican point stylethat spread beyondTeotihuacan. The ShumlaAand Bexamples that we collectedexhibita pressure-.aking pattern different from that of Teotihua­can and may represent local production tradi­tions, supporting the latter possibility (Knight 2017). Procedures and methodologies of INAA and XRFassays arepresented as Supplemental Text 1. 


ResultsofChemical Characterization 
INAA Analysis 
Three sub-sources of obsidian were identi.ed fromthe40 source samples: Zaragoza-Oyameles 1 (Z-O1), Gomez Sur (Z-O2), and Potreros Caldera(Z-O3; Table1). TheZ-O1sub-source is the most common and widespread across thesource area, representing88 percent(n = 35) of our samples. Samples identi.ed as Z­O1 were collected from a broad area across thesurvey zone (Figure5). Theseinclude the large obsidian .ow bands identi.ed adjacent to the western and eastern side of the town of Zaragoza, and all the exposed .ow bands between the towns of Zaragoza and Oyameles, including Cobean’s “Oyameles”area. Z-O1 also includes alltheexposures along thewestern side of theOyameles Dome,west and southwest of thetownofOyameles. Samples collected from the Barranca Toluca, along the northern .anks of the Oyameles Dome, were sourced to Z­O1,aswaslow-qualitybut knappable obsidian recovered from a ravine just northwest of the townof Huitzitzlapan,5kmwest-northwestof Oyameles. Thus, the samples that characterize theZ-O1sub-source were collected from an area that measures 11.6km(north-south)by 4.5km (east-west). 
The PotrerosCaldera(Z-O3) sub-source is de.ned from just 5 percent (n = 2) of the submitted samples. The exposed .ow bands that were the source of these samples cluster

of the town of Oyameles. Further north, these drainages enter a larger drainage system that passesthrough thetownsof Tlatlauquitepec and Teteles de Ávila, 10 and 11 km downstream, respectively, both of which contain substantial prehispanic occupations.Nosignsof quarrying or other prehispanic activities were found near where we collected the Gomez Sur samples, but the .elds adjacent to the ravines were not systematically or comprehensively surveyed. 
XRF Analysis 
Seventy-three of the 85 projectile points were madeofZ-O1 obsidian,andtheremaining12all areassignedtotheGomezSur (Z-O2) sub-source (Table2). No points were made from Potreros Caldera obsidian.All15examplesofthe Shumla Aand ShumlaBvarietiesofprojectile point were made of Z-O1 sub-source material, and all were recovered from the western and southwestern slopes of theOyameles Dome (the area closest to Cantona).Thisindicates that the pointswere made locally for use by people from that city. Elsewhere, Knight(2017)suggests that Shumla A and B points may have been produced for special uses by the elite of Cantona, such as giftexchanges with people outsideofthe central highlands. The surface distribution of all other projectile-point types has no noticeable pattern, supporting the proposition that they were used for utilitarian tasks such as hunting. 
Gomez Sur and Altotonga 
The Z-O1 and Potreros Caldera sub-sources have barium(Ba) concentrations in the 400 to 500 ppm range. In contrast, the three Gomez

Sur samples have Ba concentrations of about 100 ppm. This is very similar to samples from the Altotonga source area, located 25 km to the east-northeast along the eastern edge of the LosHumeros CalderainVeracruz. Cobean and his colleagues (1971:668) characterized Alto­tonga obsidian from cobbles found in a ravine 1 km north of the town of Altotonga. Ferriz (1985:367) mentions that Altotonga obsidianis not restrictedtotheareawhereCobean originally foundit, becauseitispartofthe broader Xaltipan Ignimbrite formation. A combined plot of all of Cobean’sAltotonga and Zaragoza-Oyameles (ZP-MX) source samples and the three sub-sources identi.ed in this survey exhibit a close correspondence between Gomez Sur and Alto­tonga(Figure6). 
To explain the appearance of outcrops of Altotongatype obsidianinthe Zaragoza region, wehypothesizethat bothGomez Sur and Alto­tongatypesof obsidianwereformed beforethe Xaltipan geologicalevent.Gomez Sur outcrops and samplesare alllocated on theinferred north rimofthe LosHumeros Caldera, and Cobean’s (2002) 15 Altotonga samples were collected outside the town of Altotonga, which is also outside the rim of the Los Humeros Caldera. We think that Altotonga obsidian is closely related to the Xaltipan tuff because cobbles of obsidian were found within ignimbrite. When compared to the silica-rich rhyolitic portion of theXaltipan tuff, boththe Altotonga and Gomez Surhave less strontium,but are almost thesame in other elemental concentrations.Therefore, it is possiblethat immediately beforeoratthe same timeasthe eruptionthat produced theXaltipan tuff, some chemically similar obsidian .ows erupted across the volcanic .eld. Nonetheless, due to the explosive eruption of Xaltipan tuff, not many .ows are preserved at the surface, but during the eruption, clasts of such obsidian could have been included in the pyroclastic .ows as accidental fragments. This may account for the “outcrops of small black obsidian cob­bles”identi.edby Cobean(2002:175) near the townofTezuitlán, Puebla.Adetailed geological survey from Zaragoza to Altotonga across the whole Los Humeros volcanic .eld and more

ComparisonwithRegional Data Sets 
Analyzedby Missouri UniversityResearch 
Reactor (MURR) 

We compared the chemical signatures of the threeZaragoza-Oyameles sub-sources with arti­fact data from consumer sitesintheentireMURR databaseinorder to identify chronological and geographic patterns. This database, collected since 1988, contains 821 Zaragoza-Oyameles artifacts assayed by INAA and 288 analyzed by XRF. Such artifacts are coded at MURR as “ZP-MX.” The artifacts come from sites across most of Mesoamerica dating to many periods. Supplemental Table 1 summarizes the artifact data used in this comparison for INAA, and SupplementalTable2 summarizes the dataused in XRF.

INAA 
For Zaragoza-Oyameles obsidian, the greatest intra-sourcevariationinelemental composition is exhibited by Ba and cobalt (Co). Unfortu­nately,Co and other useful elementsare assayed through the long irradiation procedure, which was not used to identify most artifacts. Thus, we employed Ba and dysprosium (Dy), both of which are assayed through the abbreviated-INAA process. Figure7 displays artifact data for consumer sites as compared with the 95 percent con.dencekernel ellipsesfor thethree sub-sources. 
The vast majority of the consumer artifacts sourced to Zaragoza-Oyameles in the MURR database come from the Z-O1 sub-source. Just one of the analyzed consumer site samples matches the Gomez Sur sub-source, and 4 percent (n =33) is assigned to the Potreros Caldera sub-source. These artifacts attributable to the PotrerosCalderasub-source come froma number of regions,including Oaxaca,Tabasco, Yucatán, Puebla,Mexico State,Tamaulipas, and Veracruz (SupplementalTable3).Unfortunately, we lack typological datafor theseartifacts. 
XRF 
Forartifacts analyzedbyXRF,weused strontium (Sr) and zinc (Zn) concentrations to distinguish among the three sub-sources. Once again, the vast majorityoftheZaragoza-Oyameles artifacts in theMURR database comefromthe Z-O1 sub­source(Figure8). Only one consumer artifact (DTW039), from coastalOaxaca, is assigned to the Altotonga/Gomez Sur chemical group. An outlierexists, whichisaprojectile point fromthe Zaragoza-Oyameles source area that contained unusually large quantitiesofSr. 


Discussion 
Unsurprisingly, the geologic samples of the Z-O1 sub-source come from .ow bands near the towns of Zaragoza and Oyameles. The largest and most intensive quarrying zones arelocated immediately northof Oyameles,alongthesouth­ernface of theBarranca Acuaco, and along the western edge of the Oyameles Dome. We also identi.ed considerable quarry activities north of theBarranca Acuaco,in Ixmatlaco and adjacent to Zaragoza. Oneofthe largest socavones identi­.edinthesurveyisnexttothetollroad entrance to thetownofZaragoza. Muchof this reduction workshop was destroyed by construction of the road, but what remains indicates that it was a major locus of quarrying and initial reduction activities. 
What do these results imply for the distri­butionofobsidian acrossMesoamerica? Survey andexcavationatthe cityof Cantonahave iden­ti.ed extensive obsidian workshops, suggesting intensiveproductionofprismatic blades forlocal consumption andof blade cores forexport(Gar­cía Cook 2003:337; García Cook et al. 2010). Theriseandfallofthecity correspondstothe principal pulsesofZaragoza-Oyameles obsidian distributionthroughout Mesoamerica. It is clear that Cantona had a special relationship with the source area, and that this was focused on the Z-O1 sub-source. Our identi.cation of three large habitation sites implies that extraction of Z-O1 obsidian was conducted by families liv­ing adjacent to some of the quarries (Knight 2015). We recovered a relatively large num­ber of ceramic sherds(n =~520) from these habitation sites, but they await analysis. Lara Galicia’s (2003, 2004) earlier reconnaissance and ceramic analysis indicate that pottery from the area near these quarries is similar to that consumed at the city of Cantona during the Early and Late Classic periods, which suggests thattheZaragoza-Oyameles habitationsiteswere consuming ceramics associated with Cantona. Next to no ceramics were recovered from the quarry and reduction sites closer to the town of Zaragoza or from the surfaces adjacent to the PotrerosCalderaorGomez Sur .ow bands. Therefore, the natureofthe relationshipofthese sub-source areas to Cantona is not understood. 
The 33 Potreros Caldera Artifacts from Consumer Sites 
Although incomplete, temporal data for the PotrerosCalderaartifactsinthe MURR database indicate that obsidian from that sub-source was consumed across several time periods. In the southern Gulf Lowlands, where most obsidian from this sub-source was used, the four Palo Errado samples come from layers that date

of Potreros Caldera obsidian consumption— from before, during, and possiblyafter theCan­tona occupation—indicates that Cantonawasnot solely responsibleforthismaterial enteringlong­distance exchange networks. The same can be saidforthe more commonZ-O1sub-source,with which PotrerosCaldera obsidianwas traded. 
The Potreros Caldera sub-source is located 4 km northeast of the town of Oyameles and the principal Z-O1 quarries. Quarrying activ­ities at the Potreros Caldera source area are minimal. Instead,it appearsthatexposed obsid­ian bands emanating from the steep slope of the inner caldera wall were opportunistically exploited. If obsidian from Potreros Caldera entered Mesoamerican exchange networks via Cantona, then its inclusion was more theprod­uct of ad hoc collection than systematic, con­trolled quarrying. Thisisvery different fromthe extractionofZ-O1sub-source material along the westernand northwesternedgesoftheOyameles Dome. Therefore, several systems of obsidian collection, possiblyby several groupsof people or communities with territorial claims to local .ow bands, couldhave contributedtothe obsid­ian enteringCantona. 
Another possibility is that Potreros Caldera obsidian may have entered Mesoamerican exchange networks independently of Cantona. The Potreros Caldera and Gomez Sur sub-sources areseparatedbyalarge, .at plain, and the PotrerosCalderaareawouldhave been more accessibletopeopletothe north thanto peoplein theOyameles area. Prehispanic siteshave been identi.ed to the north of the Gomez Sur sub-source area at Tlatlauquitepec and Teteles de Ávila.Onabrief site visittoTetelesdeÁvilain thespringof2015,we observed atleast15large (10–12mhigh) moundsinthesite core,thusthis site couldrepresentaregional center.We know of no published investigations of the site, and its occupationspanand general layout are unknown. 
Altotonga/Gomez Sur Distribution 
Thesimilarityof GomezSur sub-source obsidian to material from Altotonga may indicate that some obsidian from Gomez Sur also entered ancient Mesoamerican long-distance exchange networks. The physical location of the Gomez Sur sub-sourceexposures,aswellasknown Alto­tonga outcrops, suggests collection by groups along the slopes of the northern side ofthe Los HumerosCaldera. Thesemighthave been based at Tlatlauquitepec and Teteles de Ávila, or at other centersclosertothe moderntownofAlto­tonga. LikeZ-O1 and PotrerosCaldera obsidian, Altotongamaterialwas traded beforethe settle­mentanddevelopmentof Cantona.Nevertheless, duringthe Classic period, Altotonga/Gomez Sur obsidian was traded through the same network asZ-O1 material.For instance,atLagunadelos Cerrosin theSierradelosTuxtlasofVeracruz, theAltotonga/Gomez Sur material comprises9 percent(n = 23)oftheEarly Classic,19 percent (n = 34) of the Late Classic, and 12 percent (n = 15) of the Terminal Classic period sam­ple(Ramírez Sánchez 2008:127,Table 12).In theIsthmus ofTehuantepec, Zeitlin(1982:268) found that Altotonga comprises 17 percent of theEarly Classicsample and48 percentof the Late Classic sample. A recent study by Barca and her colleagues(2013).nds that therhyolitic glass shards used as aggregate in the stucco .oorsof the central courtyard ofTeopancazco, an Early Classic, multiethnic neighborhood of Teotihuacan, came from the Altotonga mag­matic system.Linda Manzanilla(2011:22–25) suggests that trading caravans were organized betweenTeopancazco and the centralGulfLow­lands at Nautla,Veracruz, to secureGulfCoast

commodities. Cantonais locatedrightinthemid­dleof oneoftheleast-effort routestothe coast fromTeotihuacan, yet artifactsfromCantona and thearchitectureofthe cityexhibit little connec­tionwithTeotihuacan (GarcíaCook and Merino Carrión 1998:197; Gómez Santiago 2010). In fact,Cantonawouldhavedirectly competed with Teotihuacan for accessto commoditiesfromthe GulfLowlands duringthe EarlyClassic period (García Cook and Vackimes Serret 2014:239– 240).Itis possible, then, that theTeopancazco trade routeveeredfarther north along the north­ernslopesoftheLos HumerosCalderatoreach Nautla, and thus received northern slope mate­rials such as Altotonga rhyolitic glass from the populations living there. As a result, obsidian fromthe PotrerosCalderaareamayhaveentered regionalexchange networksina manner similar to Altotonga/Gomez Sur materials during the Formative and Classic periods. 


Conclusions 
A program of intensive surface survey, source sampling, and chemical analysis has resultedin a substantial increase in our understanding of how obsidian was exploited in the Zaragoza-Oyameles source area. The role of Cantona in theextraction and productionofmacrocores and polyhedral cores is still under investigation,but the data point to a focus on the Z-O1 sub-source by the Cantona elite. The discovery of twoother sub-sourcesintheZaragoza-Oyameles source area, and the early Mesoamerica-wide distributionofobsidian fromthem,indicatethat locals engaged in extraction and production activities beforethe founding of Cantona. Thus, it seems likely that the early Cantona elite co-opted and expanded preexisting systems of obsidianextraction, production, and distribution, particularly in regard to some of the Z-O1 obsidian.ow bands.Thesepreexistingsystems may have continued during the occupation of Cantonain theformofopportunistic extraction of Z-O1 obsidian .ow bands, and the same thing may have occurred at Potreros Caldera and Gomez Sur. New chemical data showing that Gomez Sur obsidian is chemically indis­tinguishable from material from Altotonga, a better-known source to the east, makesthismore likely. The chemical similarity of Gomez Sur and Altotonga obsidianwidens the geographical distributionofpotentialexploitationlociof this obsidian acrossthe entire northernslopesofthe Los Humeros Caldera. This, coupled with the identi.cationofthe PotrerosCalderasub-source and its broad temporal use at consumer sites in the southern Gulf Lowlands, introduces the possibility that alternative avenues existed for Zaragoza-Oyameles source area obsidiantoenter Mesoamericanexchange networkswithout being channeled through Cantona. 
The increased detail on intra-source varia­tion at the Zaragoza-Oyameles source area was achieved through intensive surface survey and the collectionofgeologicsamples. PortableXRF is becoming an increasingly popular and cost-effective method of artifact characterization, especially in the .eld. As a result, we have begun to see much larger consumer site samples characterized thanever before(e.g.,Ebertet al. 2014;Hirth et al. 2013;Mili´c 2014;Moholy-Nagy et al. 2013). Yet, no matter how many artifacts from consumer sites are chemically characterized, the conclusions generated from those studies are still constrained by the nature and quality of source data. Unlike individual sites, obsidiansource areas aredif.culttosurvey and interpret, and can produce a volume of archaeological material beyond the time and .nancial limits of most projects. Nonetheless, with carefully developed survey methods and sampling strategies that include a multidisci­plinary approach, signi.cant new information can be generated. The increased resolution of data afforded by such methods allows for more nuanced interpretations of the political and economic systems behind obsidian artifact dis­tribution and consumption. Thesetechniques can be appliedthroughout Mesoamericaandbeyond.
