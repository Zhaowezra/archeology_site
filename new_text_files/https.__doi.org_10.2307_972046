LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 1 o, No. 3, 1999] 
328 
A number of important archaeological projects have been carried out in northern Yucatan since 1983, and read­ers will need to read more recent books and articles on the subject to gain fresh perspectives on the issues discussed in Gendrop's book. Nevertheless, George Andrews notes that Gendrop's work "still stands as the most comprehen­sive effort to date to reveal those cultural interactions that culminated in the development of the Chenes and later Puuc architectural styles ... from their beginnings in the earlier Rfo Bee region" (p. viii). This volume continues to be a worthwhile addition to a Mesoamericanist's book­shelf.

Entre mitos y fabulas: el Ecuador aborigen. ERNESTO SALAZAR. Biblioteca General de Cultura Vol. 4. Corpo­raci 6n Editora Nacional, Quito, 1996. 236 pp., figures, tables, bibliography. (paper).

This book is a revised and expanded version of the author's 1988 publication, Mitos de nuestro pasado, and its ulti­mate goal is the same: to debunk the "myths and fables" of Ecuadorian prehistory that are perpetuated by a hand­ful of textbooks widely used in primary and secondary school education. The author shows that many of these texts are based on antiquated archaeological knowledge dating to the first half of the century, or on ethnohistorical documents mysteriously lost after they were read and inter­preted by Ecuadorian luminary Padre Juan de Velasco. Even more egregious errors and distortions are introduced by the textbook authors themselves, who invent illogical and unfounded "interpretations" to suit their whims. Although subjected to reediting every few years, these textbooks demonstrate a systematic ignorance (or perhaps deliberate avoidance) of the substantial body of modem archaeological evidence upon which our current under­standing of Ecuadorian prehistory is based. This has lead to an unfortunate disjuncture between popular notions of prehistory and the scientifically established knowledge constructed over the past 30 years by a professional cadre of national and foreign archaeologists and ethnohistorians. 
The volume is composed of a brief introduction out­lining its purpose, followed by 11 short chapters examin­ing textbook accounts of various themes in Ecuadorian prehistory and ethnohistory. Examples include preceramic "early man" finds; the nature of Early Formative Valdivia culture; the infamous "Reino" de Quito theme, centered on the writings of Padre Juan de Velasco, and its indis­criminate use as an interpretive framework for under­standing pre-Inkaic social organization; and the impact of the Inka invasion on the Shyris and the nature of the local Shyri-Duchicela "dynasties." The final four chapters dis­cuss the intrigue surrounding famous lost archaeological "treasures." In the middle of this exposition, Salazar pro­vides a short but highly readable account of Ecuadorian prehistory based upon current archaeological evidence. 
This book is a must-read for all archaeologists work­ing in Ecuador, but especially for those involved in pub­lic education initiatives and community museums in rural areas where archaeological research is commonly carried out. It provides a useful overview of the obstacles we face in disseminating the results of scientific research to a rural populace whose knowledge of prehistory is largely derived from local huaquero lore and the national textbooks that Salazar deftly criticizes. Perhaps more urgently, the book should be required reading for all Ecuadorian school teach­ers and educators charged with curriculum development While it is true that archaeology can and should facilitate multiple interpretations of the past, it is time to move the field of discourse from exaggerated myth to scientific fact Salazar's book is an important step in that process. 
The Spirit of Ancient Peru: Treasures from the Museo Arqueol6gico Rafael Larco Herrera. Edited by KATH­LEEN BERRIN. Thames & Hudson and Fine Arts Muse­ums of San Francisco, New York, 1997. 216 pp., figures, catalog, bibliography, index. $45.00 (cloth).

In 1997, a selection of 160 pieces from one of Peru's pre­mier private museums, the Museo Arqueo16gico Rafael Larco Herrera, was brought to the United States for exhi­bition at the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco and the Knoxville Museum of Art. The nucleus of this collection had been amassed by one of the pioneers of Peruvian archaeology, Rafael Larco Hoyle, building upon the foun­dations laid by his father Rafael Larco Herrera. The Larco family controlled a large hacienda devoted to sugar culti­vation on Peru's north coast and many of the specimens were drawn from archaeological sites on the family lands and those in neighboring areas. 
The Spirit of Ancient Peru was created to serve as the catalog of the exhibition by its curator, Kathleen Berrio, and it admirably accomplishes this task. The volume's core are the beautiful color photographs of all of the objects; complementary descriptions and analyses of each piece are offered by specialists Elizabeth Benson, Joanne Pillsbury, Susan Berge, Heidi King, and Richard Burger. Because many of these pieces have never been adequately illustrated or discussed before, this catalog constitutes an important contribution to the field.

REVIEWS AND BOOK NOTES 
The broader significance of Larco collection is explored in a series of stimulating essays. Herrin offers a discussion of the historical context in which the collection was estab­lished, and a short biographical sketch of Rafael Larco Hoyle written as an obituary by the late Clifford Evans reviews Larco's archaeological career and contributions. A general introduction to the Prehispanic cultures which produced the objects in the Larco Collection is found in the chapters by ethnohistorian Maria Rostworoski and archaeologist Burger. A chapter by Christopher Donnan on deer hunting and combat among the Moche provides a more detailed picture of this culture-especially fitting because of the renown of the Larco Collection for its Moche ceramics. Finally, art historian Esther Pasztory con­tributes a provocative essay which considers Prehispanic Andean aesthetics and contrasts them to those of ancient Mesoamerica. The volume is beautifully produced and will be appreciated by specialists and nonspecialists alike. 
Ancient Civilizations of the New World. RICHARD E.W. ADAMS. Essays in World History. Westview, Boulder, Colorado, 1997. xiv+ 158 pp., 5 figures, 9 maps. $18.00 (paper).

This brief introduction to Mesoamerican and Andean cul­tures is a contribution to the series, Essays in World His­tory edited by William H. McNeill and Ross E. Dunn. Through description of these cultures from the peopling of the New World up to the Spanish conquests, Adams demonstrates that their rise to the level of civilization was based on native cultural developments. This is quite a task in only 158 pages and the book is certainly not detailed enough for the specialists in New World archaeology. Nev­ertheless, the quantity of information makes this a useful reader for an introductory course on world cultures. The first chapter discusses the four areas of the Old World (Middle East, Egypt, Indus Valley, and China) that gave rise to pristine civilizations between 5000 and 1200 B.C. as a way of providing the needed definitions and contexts for the understanding of civilizations as a topic. Chapters 2 and 3 are dedicated to Mesoamerica and chapters 4 and 5 to the Central Andes. 
The section on Mesoamerica is a condensed version of the author's 1991 textbook, Prehistoric Mesoamerica. Chapter 2 focuses on culture histories and contributions of the Olmec, Teotihuacan (whose rulers, according to Adams, conquered many Lowland Maya cities), the Zapotecs, and Lowland Maya. Chapter 3 traces the trans­formations in Mesoamerica around A.D. 650--900 that led to the later civilizations of the Toltecs, Maya, Mixtecs, Tarascans, Totonacs, and Aztecs. 

Chapters 4 and 5 treat the cultural trajectories of the Central Andes in the same fashion, beginning with the ear­liest inhabitants and village life, to the early civilizations of the Moche, Nazca, and Tiwanaku and the later civi­lizations of the Huari, Chimu, and lnka. Particular atten­tion is given to the significance of environmental diversity in Andean cultural development. The book concludes with a summary of the factors that effected the rise of civiliza­tions, including population growth, conflict, cooperation, and co-option. Through a comparison of world civiliza­tions, Adams argues that although the size, geography and specific cultural elements differ, the "similarities may be functionally necessary features that are needed by any human group that develops complex culture" (p. 132). In such a brief text, Adams highlights some truly important issues in anthropology. 
Heart of Heaven, Heart of Earth and Other Mayan Folk­tales. JAMES D. SEXTON and IGNACIO BIZARRO UJPAN. Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C., 1999. viii+ 152 pp., figures, notes, glossary, bibliography. $17.95 (paper).

This collection of 33 folktales in English prose transla­tion from the Tzutuhil-speaking village of San Jose la Laguna (a fictitious name for one of the famously pic­turesque villages on the shores of Lake Atitlan, Guatemala) represents the fifth published collaboration between anthropologist Sexton and his long-time Maya consultant and storyteller Ignacio Bizarro Ujpan. The con­tent of the tales ranges from traditional Maya material to motifs and tale types borrowed from Spanish traditions. Set down in the early 1990s, some texts consider histor­ical themes dating from the colonial and early modem periods. Unfortunately, none of this oral historical mate­rial reflects the insurgency and counterinsurgency activ­ities that occurred in the Lake Atitlan area during the 1980s-a convulsive period of civil violence. Thus, the collection will be of little value for historical reconstruc­tion of grassroots events of this crucial time in contem­porary Maya social and political history. 
If carefully examined, this collection will be of some use to epigraphers and historical ethnographers who seek contemporary data that will illuminate familiar Maya supernatural beliefs and practices, such as earth lords, nagualismo, shamanism, and calendrical divination. There also is useful material on Maya-Christian syncretism, best exemplified by the text, "Heart of Heaven, Heart of Earth: A Tzutuhil Tale," wherein the unitary ancient Maya cre­ative power (best known from the first part of the Popol Vuh) is shown to merge fully with the saints and other con-
