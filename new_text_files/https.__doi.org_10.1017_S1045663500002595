Excavations at La Sufricaya, a minor ritual group in the outskirts of the Lowland Maya city of Holmul, have documented two mural paintings inside an elite building of Early Classic date (A.D. 300-A.D. 600). One of the paintings is mytholog­ical in nature (Mural 9). The second bears an inscription with references to calendrical and historical events. It commem­orates a notorious arrival date at Tikal on 11Eb15 Mak (January 16, A.D. 378) on its first anniversary. The architecture and artifacts associated with the murals combine Maya and Teotihuacan decorative motifs, and offer several parallels with Tikal assemblages. The iconography, epigraphy, and archaeological associations of these murals are discussed in·relation to the function of the palace complex. This important new evidence contributes to an understanding of which role relations with Teotihuacan may have played in regional politics in the Maya Lowlands during the Early Classic period from the point of view of a smaller site. The interpretations presented here focus on the concept of political intervention of Tikal in the affairs of secondary and tertiary sites. 
El reciente hallazgo de dos pinturas murales en el sitio de La Sufricaya, en la cercania de la ciudad Maya de Holmul, Peten ofrece la oportunidad de discutir la relaci6n entre las ciudades Maya y sus relaciones con Teotihuacan en la epoca Clasico Temprana. Los murales se encuentran en un complejo de edificios palaciegos menor en las cercanias del centro ceremonial de Holmul en el cual abundan los motivos iconograficos Teotihuacanos y obsidiana importada de fuentes Mexicanas. Unas de las pinturas (Mural 9) es de contenido mitol6gico mientras la segunda (Mural 7) es de contenido hist6rico yes completa­mente textual. Ambas son de estilo y contenido Maya. El analisis de la iconografia y epigrafia de estos monumentos permite elaborar interpretaciones sabre la funci6n de este complejo como sede temporal de los gobernantes del sitio. A esta informa­ci6n se adjunta la discusi6n de! contexto arquitect6nico y de artefactos asociados a los monumentos las cuales indicanfuertes enlaces con Tikal. Estas evidencias aun si fragmentarias nos permiten una reconstrucci6n de las posibles modalidades en las cuales se dio el uso de dichos motivos Teotihuacanos en este caso especifico y nos permiten aumentar el conocimiento sob re que papel pudo haber jugado la lejana Teotihuacan en las Tierras Bajas Maya del Cldsico Temprano. Se ofrece una inter­pretaci6n que enfoca en la politica de intervenci6n de Tikal sabre centros secundarios y que evita algunas posiciones extremas que se han presentado sabre este problema hasta ahora.

Proskouriakoff 1993; Sanders and Price 1968; Schele and Freidel 1990; Stuart 2000ab ). In the 1960s, when Maya texts where still largely unde­ciphered, Tatiana Proskoirak:off (1993) first noted a historical event involving individuals wearing the costume ofTeotihuacan warriors on Tikal and U ax­actun carved monuments. She referred to this episode in Maya history as the "arrival of strangers." More recently, the discussions on the meaning of this event have been enriched by the reading of texts that detail the dynastic history at Tikal and the names and actions of individuals linked with Teoti­huacan imagery in what has been referred to as the Teotihuacan "entrada" (Stuart 2000a). The epi­graphic evidence has fueled the long-standing debate on whether the influx of Central Mexican styles in the Maya Lowlands was because of elite emulation stimulated by political competition among ruling families initially at a few selected cen­ters, such as Tikal, Copan, and the Highland cen­ter of Kaminaljuyti or to military expeditions or migrations from Teotihuacan or other Early Clas­sic period Central Mexican centers resulting in effective foreign control of selected Maya centers (Braswell 2003:33). The resolution of this issue appears to be complicated by the great variability of cultural manifestations apparent in the archae­
ological dataset, even if just the Early Classic period, the period of greatest cultural florescence at Teotihuacan, is taken into consideration. As a result, archaeologists have waited for new data that may help contextualize Maya-Teotihuacan con­tacts and stylistic exchange. 
The·new texts, iconography, and archaeologi­
cal material from an Early Classic palace in east­
ern Peten known as La Sufricaya may lend more 
detailed historical context to the political processes 
and motives behind what was once referred to as 
the Teotihuacan "influence" or more recently as the 
Teotihuacan "entrada" in the Maya Lowlands. Dur­
ing the 2005 field season, two murals were 
unearthed in the main compound at the site. The 
context in which the two painted murals have been 
found can be described as a circumscribed location 
with a single-phase occupation in which the inter­
action with foreigners is manifested in images, 
texts, and material culture. The evidence from these 
murals may provide us with a time-and space­
specific dimension not only to the Maya-Teoti­
huacan interaction of the sort invoked by many to arrive at a better explanation (Demarest and Foias 1993: 176; Marcus 2003:356) but also to the inter­actions among Maya centers of major and minor political status. Instead of offering generalizations on the nature of "foreign influence," which may encompass various periods of contact, this evidence may help us isolate one specific mode of interac­tion among the many possible that involves polit­ical influences and allegiances. Finally, this new evidence may provide support to one of the exist­ing models of extralocal political interaction among the central Peten Maya cities by addressing specifi­cally which role, if any, individuals from Central Mexico may have played at a minor site in the Maya Lowlands. 
Methodology 
The data presented in this article combine archae­ological, iconographic, and epigraphic material. Therefore, the interpretations offered here derive from the interweaving of archaeological, icono­graphic, and epigraphic methods of analysis. The archaeological data available include remains of well-preserved masonry structures whose sealed stratigraphy, form, and material associations can provideclues to its construction sequence and func­tion as well as stylistic connections with buildings and artifact styles found elsewhere. The dates for the buildings and associated stratigraphic deposits are derived from correlation of ceramic materials with neighboring sites where radiocarbon dates and associated Long Count dates are available. The pre­liminary dating of the La Sufricaya palace's strati­graphic sequence within the Early Classic period is corroborated by the coeval A.D. 379 dedication date contained in the Mural 7 inscription. 
The iconographic data presented in this article includes a basic description of the painted figures and symbols contained in Mural 9. A minimal inter­pretation is based on comparison of such arrange­ments of figures and symbols in similar scenes known from painted ceramics of known prove­nience and published iconographic interpretations of the individual symbols and characters. 
The epigraphic data presented in graphic and tabular form (Figures 5, 7 and Table 1) are the result of three main stages. 
First, the signs in each hieroglyphic block were 
identified and recorded including undeciphered,

We followed a common transcription style (logograms in bold uppercase and syllabic signs in lowercase letters; see Kettunen and Helmke 2005:12-15). Square brackets indicate recon­structed signs. Sign identifications in the text on Mural 7 can be traced to four articles (Houston and Stuart 1989; MacLeod 1990; Stuart 1987; Stuart 2000ba).

The next analytical stage is transliteration. This is illustrated in the third column of Table 1. This stage is directly related to the problem of identify­ing the language and the spelling conventions used in Maya writing. A recent review on these topics is contained in Wichmann (2006).

The transliteration presented here largely follows the conventions in Houston et al. (2004). However, none of the three hypotheses would result in a substantially different reading and translation of the inscription on Mural 7. We emphasize that our transliteration relies on lin­guistic reconstructions (Kaufman and Norman 1984) as a guideline for representing complex VOW· els in the script.

The Historical and Archaeological 
Context of Murals 7 and 9 


The archaeological site known as La Sufricaya is a group of ceremonial buildings within the urban area of the Classic Maya city of Holmul, in north­eastern Peten, Guatemala (Figure 1). It is located 35 km east of Tikal and 19 km north of Naranjo, as the crow flies. Explorer Ian Graham first reported a stela from this location in the 1980s (Mathews 1985) and recorded an acropolis platform. Begin­ning in 2001, the site has been the focus of sys­tematic investigations by the Holmul Archaeological Project. The site's public and domestic architecture was mapped and the chronol­ogy assessed by way of existing looter's trenches and new test excavations (Estrada-Belli 2002). The majority of public buildings at the site are built on a broad platform (131 X 118 min width) raised 3 m above the natural ground (Figure 2). An Early Classic ball court and a 5 m-high temple-pyramid are situated just off the north edge of the platform.

The southwest quadrant of the main platform is occupied by an 11 m-high platform (Group 1; 60 X 52 m wide). On it, are six mounds of collapsed masonry structures, which once lined the edges of a central court. Structure 1 is by far the largest of these mounds (23 X 17 m) and rises 3 m on the north side of the group. Sometime prior to the Hol­mul Project team's arrival at the site in 2001, loot­ers excavated trenches deep into the core of the mound from the north, east and west sides destroy­ing architecture buried within. 
Inspection of these trenches led to the discovery of several polychrome painted walls within a group of bmied Early Classic buildings (Murals 1-3, 6, and 8 of Room 1; Murals 4-5 of Room 2; Estrada­Belli 2001; Tomasic and Estrada-Belli 2003). Sub­sequent investigations in 2002, 2003, 2004, and 2005 led to the unearthing of a maze of 15 rooms within the same building. Structure 1, thus appears to be a multiroom complex on a 10 m-high plat­form with major access stairways from the north, south, and probably west formed by the piecemeal addition of standalone buildings to an initial court­yard. Most of the buildings' walls are preserved up to the vault spring and bear, in some cases, painted mural decoration. Subsequent conservation and analysis of the paintings led to the identification of several Teotihuacan-style figures painted in red­lined frames on three walls of Room 1. Several arti­facts found on the floors of the rooms within this structure suggested stylistic links to Teotihuacan and Central Mexico. These included coffee-bean applique decorated cylinder vessels, apron effigy lids, and dozens of green obsidian blades from Cen­tral Mexican sources (Estrada-Belli 2001, 2002, 2003, 2005; Estrada-Belli and Foley 2004; Hruby 2006; Tomasic and Estrada-Belli 2003). 
In addition to this evidence, hieroglyphic inscriptions link the site to an event that had great historical resonance in the Maya Lowlands, an arrival event at Tikal, which has been associated with the appearance of Teotihuacan imagery in the Maya Lowlands (Proskouriakoff 1993; Stuart 2000a). An inscription on a fragment of an Early Classic stela found at the site in 2001 (Stela 6) pos­sibly bore the Sihyaj K'ahk' name in connection with an incomplete Early Classic date 8. 17.?.9.9 that may fall in the 10-year period between A.D. 377 and 387 (Grube 2003). Thernissing part ofthis inscription may have referred to an event or cere­mony roughly coeval with the arrival event of Sihyaj K'ahk' at Tikal in A.D. 378, which is known from inscriptions at Tikal and Uaxactun (Grube 2003; Stuart 2000a). Finally, two other stelae found at La Sufricaya date to the years immediately preceding and following A.D. 400. Stela 5 records the acces­sion of ("seven lords") or of a local lord possibly namedAj Wosaaj on the 8.19.6.8.5 8 Chichchan 3 Xul date (August 6, A.D. 422). Stela 1, is a portrait of a ruler standing in profile that has much in com­mon stylistically with Tikal's stelae 31, 40 and Xul­tun stelae 12, 20, and other pre-Baktun 9 stelae from northeastern Peten (Grube 2003). 
The period of occupation in Structure 1 and other public and elite buildings at the site (e.g., the ball court and two looted elite burials; see Tokovi­nine 2006) narrowly corresponds with the times­pan of the La Sufricaya inscriptions. All of the buildings within Structure 1 were erected, occu­pied, and buried within the first part of the Early Classic period according to ceramic cross-dating. 
The construction core of the platform contained ceramics of the early Early Classic Holmul I and II phases (Merwin and Vaillant 1932) coeval with the Tzakol 1and 2 phases of Uaxactun (Callaghan 2006) and mixed with some Late Preclassic mate­rial, suggesting that the it was first erected prior to 
A.D. 375 but probably no earlier than A.D. 300. The upper building sequence began with two struc­tures, Rooms 1 and Sub 13 at the northern and western extremes of a courtyard later completely filled by additional rooms of the Structure 1 com­plex (Figure 3). In a second stage, room Sub 14 was built abutting the eastern, (courtyard side) facade of the Sub 13 building. In tum, a new room Sub 10, was added to the eastern facade of Sub 14, thus forming a sequence of three buildings aligned and abutting one another. The outer upper facade of these structures was decorated with a deeply recessed rectangular tablero framed by large tenoned limestone blocks. In some cases, poly­chrome murals decorated the outer walls of build­ings, as well the interiors. 
The small central courtyard space enclosed by these buildings was eventually filled with addi­tional rooms. During a termination ritual, the inte­riors of rooms were burned and filled with rubble up to the vault springs. Then, a floor was laid out on top of the former roofs to support a rectangular perishable building accessed from the south by a

masonry stairway. The single-episode filling of all of these rooms consistently contained material from the Early Classic Period with diagnostic artifacts similar to those of the Uaxactun ceramic phases Tzakol 2 and Tzakol 3 and Tikal's Manik 3 phase (Culbert 1993; Laporte et al. 1992; L. A. Smith 
1950), indicating that the beginning and the end of the Structure 1 building sequence were separated by a short period of time. This period most likely fell between A.D. 350 and A.D. 4501500. 
Taken as a whole, the existing body of archae­ological and epigraphic evidence from La Sufricaya suggests that this was not a peripheral administra­tive center in its own accord, but a group of elite and ritual edifices and monuments closely linked to the ceremonial center ofHolmul. As such, it was relatively short-lived and its occupants had some connection with Tikal and Teotihuacan. 
Mural 9 

Mural 9 is one of two murals discovered in 2005. 1 It is located on the inner eastern wall of room Sub 13 whereas Mural 7 was found on the inner west-em wall of the adjacent room Sub 10. Mural 9 was painted below a small rectangular window against the principal (western) entrance to Sub 13 (Figure 3). Its position suggests that it could be seen through the doorway by anyone accessing the building pre­sumably from a western stairway. The mural occu­pies the lower 1 m-area above the floor. Graffiti were incised at a later time on part of the mural. Before the termination of the building, the mural, and graffiti were covered with a thin wash of white paint. Because the room was filled with rubble dur­ing the Early Classic period, the graffiti must date to the time of occupation prior to its termination 
(A.D. 350-A.D. 450/500). 
Mural 9 is a monochrome painting consisting of red lines over a cream background (Figure 4). The lines are on average about 5-10 mm thick. The mural depicts a conversation between the two seated figures facing each other. The figures are rendered in a characteristically Early Classic Maya style with its preference for slender human bodies with elon­gated limbs and torsos, often presented in dynamic postures. The figure to the right is an elderly indi­vidual with a massive bead necklace, a pectoral, a

"YAX" diadem on the forehead, and a nose pen­dant. This set of ornaments is consistent in form with jade jewels characteristically worn by God D or ltzamnaaj (Taube 1992). He flexes his right arm out and inclines toward the figure to the left, whereas his left arm is bent down on his thigh to support the weight of the body. The figure to the left has a human body and the head of a bird. Its posture is nearly a mirror image of the posture of ltzamnaaj. The theme of ltzamnaaj conversing with an avian or human­avian messenger appears on several late Classic ves­sels, including the 8th century drinking cup from Burial 196 at Tikal that once belonged to the king Yik'in ChanK'awiil (Culbert 1993:Figure 84). That particular vessel depicts a conversation between ltzamnaajand a hummingbird. In several scenes on unprovenienced vessels the bird characters include birds of various species, possibly owls and eagles (Beliaev and Davletshin 2006). 
Mural 9 features three columns of hieroglyphic blocks located between the figures of ltzamnaaj and the avian person (Figure 4 and 5). The glyphs were painted in the same red lines as the rest of the mural. The size of each block is about 6 X 3.5 cm. There were at least six blocks in each column. The fact that the blocks in each column were not aligned hor­izontally with neighboring blocks in other columns suggests that the columns were meant to be read separately from top to bottom, a pattern found in the three other existing Early Classic inscriptions at La Sufricaya, Stelae 5 and 6 (Grube 2003), and Mural 7 (see below). 
The preservation of the inscription is very poor. There are several lacunae, in spite of enhancements with infrared imagery. The style of the glyphs is more cursive when compared to Mural 7. There are also fewer glyphs per block. Unfortunately, although a few signs are legible, the text is too dam­aged to be read with any degree of confidence. 
The context of the inscription suggests that the text may represent a conversation between ltzam­naaj and the bird figure. The imagery on Mural 9 may refer to a set of Classic Maya myths centered on God D and his court. 
Sometime later in the occupation history of the building, a woven mat motif was incised over the central inscription and a small human figure was sketched over the left arm of God D. This figure stands facing left, wearing a feather headdress sim­ilar to the drum-shaped headdress and eye-goggles

such as Room Sub 13 is difficult to interpret with­out more contextual information. It appears that this figure and the mat motif carved next to it are not part of a single composition but must represent two separate incidents of carving. Given the informal nature of the graffiti compared to the more formal painting of God D, which they overlie, it is unlikely that they were created to officially decorate the room, but more likely as an informal act. This evi­dence adds support to our working hypothesis that the numerous images depicting foreign warriors at La Sufricaya represent an actual local event (Estrada-Belli 2001).

Figure 7. Painted inscription, Mural 7, Room Sub 13, west wall (drawing by Heather Hurst). 
Finally, the location of La Sufricaya Mural 9 low on the wall and depicting figures sitting on a floor, provides some evidence that masonry rooms lack­ing built-in benches were occupied by sitting on pillows or mats directly on the floor, contrary to what is commonly seen in Late Classic Maya images. Among all the rooms in Structure 1, only one possessed a masonry bench, which was a later addition. The lack of masonry benches and thrones is common for Early Classic Maya palaces at selected Central Peten sites and at the founder's palace in Copan associated with Teotihuacan iconography (Traxler 2001 :64) and it may be because of a preference for perishable (portable) thrones, benches, and mats during that period (Ciu­dad Ruiz 2001). 
Mural7 
Mural 7 is located in the interior of room Sub I 0 and covers an area of 1 m2 in the upper section of the western wall of the room, near its northern door­way. The location of Mural 7 implies that it could only be seen from inside the room (Figure 3). The room's walls and floor were covered by two coats of plaster reflecting two separate phases of use. The lower layer was uniformly colored with red hematite pigment. The second layer was of cream color. Onto this, another thin pink foundation layer was applied in preparation for the hieroglyphic text. 
Mural 7 is a painted inscription that consists of five columns of six hieroglyphic blocks each (Fig­ure 7). The columns were separated with red lines before the glyphs were drawn. The same kind of demarcation of the painted space was attested on

Murals 1-3 and 6 from Room 1, in this same struc­ture (Estrada-Belli 2001, 2003) and may reflect a practice borrowed directly from precolumbian codices. The glyphs are in black with the excep­tion of the cartouches of day names. Each column of the text was meant to be read from top to bot­tom, beginning with the first column to the left. 
Four hieroglyphic blocks in the upper right cor­ner were likely destroyed during the termination of the building. Several blocks in the middle and at the end of the inscription appear to have been worn out when the room was still in use. 
The calligraphic style of the text pertains to the Early Classic period. It is characterized by irregu­lar contours of signs and calligraphic flourishes, which would disappear with the spread of Late Classic calligraphic styles emphasizing fluid and laconic sign shapes (Davletshin 2003; Lacadena Garcia-Gallo 1995; Tokovinine 2006). It also closely resembles the style of other painted and carved Early Classic inscriptions known from a few sites in central Peten, including Tikal, El Encanto, Bejucal, Tres Islas, Uaxactun, Candz­ibaantun, and El Zapote. 
The main stages in the epigraphic analysis of the inscription are presented in Table 1. 
The text is composed of four clauses. It consti­tutes a typical example of a Classic Maya narra­tive: a seemingly detached, third-person account, equally privileging historical events and the pas­sage of time in itself, referring to the past as an ever­happening present. The restricted location of the inscription corresponds nicely to the absence of quotativ'es like alaay ("here it is said") or che 'en ("I say") that would directly engage the reader. Therefore, it is unlikely that the narrative was meant to be read or performed in front of a large audience. 
Large sections of the first clause have been destroyed or worn out. The narrative begins with reporting the date of the event in accordance with several calendars, which form the so-called "Cal­endar Round": the 365-day year, the 260-day cycle; the nine-day period, also known as the "Lords of the Night"; and the lunar year. The "Long Count" date is noticeably absent, probably because subse­quent subordinate clauses serve as excellent chronological anchors. The verb at the beginning of the sentence that once followed the date has not been preserved (in Maya languages, the canonical syntactic order is verb-object-subject). From the remaining part of the sentence, we can deduce that a certain individual carrying the title of chak tok 

wayaab' did something to a "stone" (tuun) at a "Three 'Temple' House" (the T685 sign has not been deciphered; the "temple" reading is based solely on the iconography of the hieroglyph). The term tuun is ambiguous: it may refer to a stone object like a panel, a stela, or even a paved surface, but it may also stand for a unit of time, because of the practice of marking its passage with stone mon­uments (hence, ho'tuun, lit. "five stones," as a com­mon designation for a five-year period). The narrative establishes no part-whole relationship between the "stone" and the "house." 
Nevertheless, the physical context of the inscrip­tion offers additional clues to the possible mean­ing of the partially missing predicate. A large number of Maya texts are dedicatory statements referring to the objects on which they are inscribed (Stuart 1998:374-376). In fact, Plank (2004: 17-19) argues that most if not all dedicatory statements, particularly those on buildings and other contain­ers, such as boxes, bottles, and lidded vessels, are acts of ritual speech aimed at protecting the object and its content. Mural 7 is inscribed on a building wall. Its first clause refers to a certain "house" ( naah) as the location of the action, the focal event of the narrative, highlighted as the longest and the only independent sentence in the text. Naah is a more inclusive term, as opposed to otoot, and may refer to a group of related buildings of various func­tions rather than to a single hall or dwelling (Plank 2004: 11; Stuart 1998:376). "Three 'Temple' House" could be the name of Structure 1 itself. 
We suggest that the first clause of Mural 7 men­tions the dedication of an object associated with Structure 1 or even a section of the complex where the mural was painted. A less likely interpretation would be that the event took place in a "Three 'Temple' House" as a group of three temples at another site. Among the best known such places from this period in Central Pe ten could be the North Acropolis at Tikal or Group A-V at Uaxactun. The two Tikal kings with the largest amount of Teotihuacan-style associations, Yax NuunAhiin and Sihyaj Chan K'awiil, were buried in the North Acropolis (Coggins 1975). According to Valdes et al. ( 1999), the contemporaneous triadic group A-V at Uaxactun was the location of residence of its rulers. It was also their resting place, beginning

with a sumptuous tomb in A.D. 402, the first at the site to have Teotihuacan stylistic connections. How­ever, we acknowledge that the second interpreta­tion is particularly vulnerable in light of the fact that we do not know if the T685 sign actually stands for the word temple. A common term for temple or sanctuary in Classic Maya inscriptions is uwayb 'ii k'uh (spelled WAY-b'i or WAY-ya-b'i), literally a "sleeping place," a domicile of a deity (Stuart 1998:399-402). The term wayaab' is well-attested in dedicatory texts, whereas glyph B4 in Mural 7 would be the first example of the T685 sign used 
in such context. 
After the statement about the focal event, the narrative proceeds with outlining the broader his­torical context in two subordinate sentences. First, we are told that the ceremony at the "Three 'Tem­ple' House" occurred 16 days, six months, and one year from the period-ending ceremony on the day 1 Ajaw 8 Ch' en. The emphasis is clearly on the event as the date is at the end of the sentence, con­trary to the common order in the first clause. There is only one period-ending that falls on the day 1 A jaw 8 Ch' en in the entire Early Classic period, allowing us to establish the absolute chronology of the text (see Table 2). The author of the inscription might have cited the event with a similar goal in mind, although that consideration was likely not the main reason behind introducing the sentence: it reveals the name of the k 'a tun 1 A jaw that acceded on the very same day. By doing so, the narrative evokes the prophetic k' atun history, one of the most important genres of Maya literature (Lacadena Garcia-Gallo 2002; Rice 2004; Roys 1967: 182-187; Schele et al. 2002). There is the sub­tle hint that the narrative unfolds in times of hunger, war, and natural disasters (to be) brought about by this particularly unpleasant k' atun (Edmonson 
1986:208-214). 
The sentence also contains a curious chrono­
logical inconsistency. Instead of counting the time between the dates of the event of the main clause and the period-ending, the distance number is off by sixteen 20-day months. One explanation would be that the author confused the Calendar Round date of the main event (11 Kib'14Mak) wia sim­ilar date for another k 'atun (like 11 Kib' 14 Ch' en for k'atun 9 Ajaw) . On the other hand, the "mis­take" might hint that 320 days passed between the seating of k 'atun and the dedication of a monument in its honor. 
The second clause is followed by a distance number of 364 days. However, this span of time is once again counted from the main clause. The nar­rative takes the reader to an event that happened one year before the dedicatory ceremonies at the "Three 'Temple' House." As in the previous sub­ordinate clause, the Calendar Round date is moved to the end of the sentence, highlighting the event at the expense of its timing. The text informs, rather cryptically, that K' awiil, the Classic Maya lightning god, also known as God K, (Stuart 1987; Taube 1992:69-79), "arrived to Muta!" on the day 16 Mak 11Eb'. 
The date 16 Mak 11 Eb' immediately draws the reader's attention as an impossible combination: The day 11 Eb' cannot fall on the 16th day of the month of Makif a typical Maya correlation between the two cycles is followed (Grana-Behrens 2002:80-101, Table 35, 37). Because other dates on Mural 7 follow the common correlation, the combination of 16 Mak 11 Eb' cannot be attributed to an alternative correlation. Instead, we propose thatthe date I6Mak 11 Eb' suggests thatthe author of the inscription relied on a previously unattested way of recording the seating of days in the two cycles. In that system, the 16th day of Mak would begin before the end of the day 11 Eb' . The corre­sponding date in a common Classic Maya system would be 11 Eb' 15 Mak. We are aware of only one

more example of this unusual convention-a Cal­endar Round date in the inscription on Altar Q at Copan. The Long Count date for 11 Eb' 15 Mak in the Early Classic k 'a tun 1 Ajaw would be 
8.17.01.04.12, or January 16, A.D. 378. 
Finally, the fourth (and the last) clause seem­ingly brings the narrative back to the dedicatory event at the "Three 'Temple' House." However, the protagonist is no longer the chak tok wayaab ', but an individual named Sihyaj K'ahk'. 
Historical Significance of the 
Mural 7 Inscription 

To understand the meaning and significance of the last two sentences, we need to explore the histori­cal and cultural context of the narrative. January 16, A.D. 378, is a very special date in Classic Maya history as a day when, according to several inscrip­tions, an individual named Sihyaj K'ahk' arrived to the city of Tikal. This arrival coincided in time with the beginning of a chain of events that even­tually helped Tikal rulers achieve the status of the first among the Early Classic kings (Martin and Grube 2000:29-35; Sharer and Traxler 2006:321-333; Stuart 2000ab). During the very same period, Teotihuacan-related iconography in the Maya Lowlands became common in elite con­texts at Tikal and a few selected sites (Coggins 
1975; Proskouriakoff 1993). Given that there are several extensive summaries of the specific epi­graphic evidence related to this episode in Classic Maya history (in particular, Stuart 2000a and its up­to·date review in Braswell 2003), we shall present only a brief historical outline and focus instead on the narratives themselves and their context. 
The first event of interest is the accession of an individual nicknamed "Spearthrower Owl," kaloomte' of Jo' Noh Wits, on May 5, A.D. 374. The inscription on the Tikal "Marker"2 (Stuart 2000b:Figure 15.9b; Figure 8a; Table 3) states that "Spearthrower Owl" "makes a debut in kingship" as a fourth ruler of the dynasty (joyaj ti ajawil jat­s 'oom ... jo'no[h] wits kaloomte' chan ts'akb'u[ul] ajaw). The place name of Jo' Noh Wits does not reappear in Maya texts and we would have treated that accession as a minor event of local importance were it not for the role played by progenies and vas­sals in the "Spearthrower Owl" story. 
Four years later, according to the inscription on a stela fragment from the site of El Peru (Stuart 2000a:Figure 15.13), kaloomte 'Sihyaj K' ahk' is the protagonist of an unknown event at an unspecified location on January 8, A.D. 378. Eight days later, Sihyaj K' ahk' "arrives to" (huli) somewhere. None of the inscriptions available prior to the Mural 7 discovery specifies to where Sihyaj K'ahk' arrives. Tikal (Muta!) is mentioned in the same sentence as the arrival event in the inscriptions on Uaxactun Stela 4 and Tikal "Marker" after Sihyaj K'ahk's name (Stuart 2000a:Figure 15.2; Figure 8a, lOc), but neither context is clear enough to assume that Tikal has something to do with the location of the event or with the titles of the protagonist. Other ref­erences to the event are more obscure. According to the inscription on Uaxactun Stela 22:B9-l l (Stu­art 2000b:Figure 15.8; Figure 9b, Table 3), "Ochk'in K'awiil arrived" on that day (huliiy Ochk'in K'awiil). The corresponding passage on Tikal Stela 31 remains undeciphered, but the pro­tagonist is Ochk 'in K 'awiil Sihyaj K 'ahk 'kaloomte' 
(Stuart 2000a:478, Figure 15.5b). 
The verb huli in the clauses discussed above means "arrive to (somewhere)." It can be contrasted in the script with the verb tali"to come from (some­where)" as in the inscription on Altar Q at Copan (Stuart 2004:235) where the protagonist "comes from wite' house" (tali wite' naah) and subse­quently "arrives to Copan" (huli hux witik). The same contrast is well-attested in the 17th-century Ch'ontal Paxbolon Papers (Stuart 2004:235). Although a small glossary in the latest edition of this document makes no distinction between tali and huli (Smailus 1975:144, 169), the actual text always employs these terms as "come from I come 
· 
(from out there)" and "come to I come (to here)" respectively, sometimes even as contrasting pairs. Tali uyuxdzac ahauob ukaba chanpel [ ... } hain xach ahau yuual huli uchuce cabob .. [Came (from 
.
there) the third of kings named Chanpel ( ... ); him, the said king, then came (to here) to take the towns ... ] (Smailus 1975:27-28). Talihix huli licensia ... [As the licencia had already come from there (Calkini) the licencia came to here] (Smailus 1975:111 ) . ... yuual uhulel uthanol [ ... } vi ta cah tixchel uthan cayumla Rey tali ta espaiia ... [ ... Then arrived his decree ( ... ) here to the town ofTixchel, the word of our lord the King came from Spain ...] (Smailus 1975:111-112).

that on the very same day the king of Tikal, Chak Tok lch'aak, "enters the waters" (ochi ha') and "enters the mountain" ( ochi wits), that is, he dies, 17 years from his accession ceremony (the text uses a term ku-yu-TE' or KAL-yu-TE'). Accord­ing to the same text (Stela 31 :D26-C27; Figure 8b ), the event happens at a certain place. The place name has not been deciphered and does not reappear in this or other known narratives. 
The inscription on Tikal "Marker" informs of a subsequent "arriving" (HUL ?-ye) to an undeci­phered location (ku-?-pu CH'E'N). The protago­nists of the latter event are "Spearthrower Owl," Sihyaj K'ahk', and several supernatural beings including ChanAjaw K'uh ("Sky Lord God") and Ochk'in Waxaklajuun Ub 'aah Kan ("Western Eigh­teen Snake Heads"). The text on Stela 31 then men­tions dedication ceremonies undertaken by the kaloomte ', but it is unclear if it also refers to Jan­uary 16 (most of the passage is on the missing part of the monument). Some time later (it is impossi­ble to reconstruct the date; see Table 3 for alterna­tive dates), Yax Nuun Ahiin, the son of "Spearthrower Owl" and a future king of Tikal, "ascends to wite'house by order of the kaloomte "' (t'ab'aay wite' naah ukab'ji[iy] kaloomte') (Fig­ure 8d; Table 3). 
The next event is Yax Nuun Ahiin's accession 
on September 13, A.D. 379. The inscription on 
Tikal Stela 4 (Stuart 2000a:Figure 15.6) states that 
"Yax NuunAhiinNahb' Nal K'ihnich, the vassal of 
kaloomte 'Sihyaj K 'ahk' makes a debut in kingship" 
(joyaj ti ajawil Yax Nuun Ahiin Nahb 'Nal K' ihnich 
yajaw kaloomte 'Sihyaj K' ahk '). The inscription on 
Stela 31 :E10-El5 (Jones and Satterthwaite 
1982:Figure 52) provides a more extensive refer­ence to the same event: "reverend holy Kukal lord Yax Nuun Ahiin [is] in kingship; he takes twenty eight pet; [it is] his ... ; [it is] by order of Sihyaj K'ahk'; it happens at wite' house" (ti ajawlil mam k'uh{ul] Kukal ajaw Yax Nuun Ahiin uch'amaw waxak winik pet u-... ukab'ji{iy] Sihyaj K'ahk' 
uhtiiy wite' naah) (Figure 8d; Table 3). 
The latest event in our summary is the period ending ritual on July 8, A.D. 396. The Tikal Stela 4 text (Stuart 2000b:Figure 15.6; Figure 8c; Table 3) refers to the ritual as Yax Nuun Ahiin's "stone­binding" (uk' altuun). The inscription on Tikal Stela 3l:Fl6-E20 (Jones and Satterthwaite 1982:Figure 52; Figure 8d) offers additional details "he stone­binds [at] Huk lk' K'an Nal K'ahk' Wits; he com­pletes the eighteenth k'atun; [it is] by order of one k'atun lord Yax Nuun Ahiin" (k' alaw tuun Huk lk' K' an Nal K' ahk' Wits utsutsuw waxaklajuun winik haab' ukab 'ji{ iy] juun winik haab' a jaw Yax Nuun Ahiin) (Figure 8d). Another early Classic Tikal monument, badly eroded Stela 18 (Jones and Sat­terthwaite l 982:Figure 26), shows a figure seated on aK' ahk'Witsplace name hieroglyph (Stuart and Houston 1994:82-84), while the name of the pro­tagonist in the text on the back of the stela ends in " ... the vassal of Sihyaj K'ahk"' (. .. yajaw Sihyaj K' ahk' ). The monument may have marked the same period ending event as Stela 4. 
Interestingly enough, the text on U axactun Stela 4 (Schele and Grube 1994:89) describes period ending ceremonies on the same day undertaken by K' awiil Sihyaj K' ahk' kaloomte' himself and a local ruler, but not Yax Nuun Ahiin (Figure 9d).

of Bejucal commemorates a period-ending cere­mony performed three years earlier by a local ruler of the Ik' dynasty who calls himself "the vassal of kaloomte' Sihyaj K'ahk'" (yajaw kaloomte' Sihyaj K'ahk') (Schele and Grube 1994:88). Apparently, Sihyaj K'ahk', not Yax NuunAhiin, was acknowl­edged as a supreme ruler in the region. 
In summary, several inscriptions from Central Peten highlight the "arrival" of an individual named Sihyaj K'ahk' or kaloomte' Sihyaj K'ahk'. "Sihyaj K'ahk"' seems to be an abbreviated version of the name "Ochk'in K'awiil Sihyaj K'ahk' kaloomte'." Other attested abbreviations are K 'awiil Sihyaj K'ahk' and, rather confusingly, Ochk'in K'awiil. The "arrival" event coincides with the death of the Tikal king. A new Tikal ruler accedes to power within a year. He is repeatedly presented in the nar­ratives as "the vassal of Sihyaj K'ahk'. " A con­temporary ruler of Bejucal is also referred to as "the vassal of Sihyaj K'ahk'. " 
It is important to note that all previously known references to the "arrival" event postdate it by sub­stantial periods of time. Tikal Stela 4 and the Uax­actun monuments were commissioned no earlier than in A.D. 396, the period-ending event men­tioned in their inscriptions. The Tikal "Marker" was dedicated inA.D. 416. Tikal Stela 31 was com­missioned no earlier than A.D. 441. U axactun Ste la 22 was dedicated in A.D. 504. The references to Sihyaj K'ahk' leave no doubt that he is a historical figure, not a deity or an abstract concept, and that he is the main agent of the political turnover at Tikal and a few other locations. 
It is also noteworthy that the Tikal "Marker," Stela 4, the Bejucal stela, and Tikal 31 present slightly differing narratives on the same historical period by individuals who evidently had different political agendas. The rulers who commissioned Tikal Stela 4 and the Bejucal monument acknowl­edged being the "vassals" of Sihyaj K'ahk' . In the narrative of the Tikal "Marker;' which was com­missioned well in the reign of Sihyaj Chan K' awiil, the protagonist of the dedication event is an other­wise unknown individual (his name is undeci­phered) who carries no "emblem glyph" title and presents himself as a "vassal of Sihyaj K'ahk'" (Stuart 2000b:Figure 15.9). There is no reference to Yax Nuun Ahiin or Sihyaj Chan K' awiil in the narrative on this monument in contrast to several mentions of Sihyaj K'ahk' and "Spearthrower Owl." By contrast, Tikal Stela 31 was commis­sioned a few decades later by Sihyaj Chan K' awiil, a next-generation ruler of Tikal and the son of Sihyaj K'ahk's vassal. However, according to its text, Sihyaj Chan K'awiil is no one's vassal; nei­ther is there any mention of Sihyaj K'ahk', at least for the time of Sihyaj Chan K'awiil's own reign. These differences are intriguing and may reflect political competition at Tikal during the last few years in the reign of Yax Nuun Ahiin and the first three decades of Sihyaj Chan K' awiil's reign, which is the time in which Tikal Stela 4, the Bejucal mon­ument (A.D. 396), and the Tikal "Marker" (A.D. 416) were erected, and includes the decades prior to Stela 31 erection (A.D. 441) for which there are no other inscriptions. It is probable that Sihyaj Chan K'awiil's eventual rise to power might have been preceded by some power struggles at Tikal and a transitional ruler named Sihyaj Chan K' ihnich may have presided over this interregnum as early as 
A.D. 406 (Martin and Grube 2000:33). Alterna­tively, the lacunae in the early history of Sihyaj Cha n K'a wiil's reign may be because of the destruction of this period's monuments in subse­quent wars (e.g., the Tikal "hiatus") or may be filled by monuments that lie buried undetected and that have not yet entered our record. 
Where does the narrative on Mural 7 fit with respect to these historical narratives? It is the only inscription that unequivocally states: "K'awiil arrives to Tikal" (huliiy Muta! K'awiil) on January 16, A.D. 378. It is the only near-contemporaneous account of the arrival episode. Moreover, it is the only known case when a local lord and Sihyaj K' ahk' are involved in dedication ceremonies on the one-year anniversary of the "arrival" event. As it is common practice in Maya narratives to link events of the same kind, it is possible that the author of the Mural 7 text sought to draw a parallel between the foundation event at Tikal and the dedication of a new building, possibly a new seat of rulership, at Hol­mul. Sihyaj K' ahk's mention in relation to the ded­ication ceremony at the "Three 'Temple' House" is probably very meaningful because it happens dur­ing the "interregnum" period at Tikal. The inscrip­tion provides no clarification concerning the relationship between the protagonist of the dedica­tion and Sihyaj K'ahk'. However, it is likely that such a commemorative text was intended to bolster the prestige of the building owner.

We may also wonder why the anonymous author of Mural 7 may have chosen to present the agent of the arrival episode as K'awiil, like in the pas­sage on a later U axactun Stela 22. One explanation would be that the author simply used one of the common abbreviations of Sihyaj K'ahk's name (Ochk'in K' awiil). There is another possible inter­pretation of the passage. By choosing such phras­ing for reporting the arrival of Sihyaj K'ahk' to Tikal, the author of the inscription on Mural 7 may have intended to emphasize the ritual significance of this event. David Stuart (2004a), in his study of the inscription on Altar Q that relates the arrival of the founder of the local dynasty, K'ihnich Yax K'uk' Mo' at Copan, offered a new interpretation of the significance of such arrival events. Stuart suggested that the arrival of the lightning god K'awiil from the "place of reeds" or Tollanmentioned in that text symbolized the establishment of a new political and cosmic order at Copan. Maya kings used to "take" that deity on acceding to the office to return to the primordial origins of their power. The bring­ing of the lightning god Tohil from Tollan by K'iche' dynastic founders in the Papa l Vuh story represents the same symbolic trope (Fash and Fash 2000; Tedlock 1996). 
The Mural 7 Protagonist's Identity: 
chak tok wayaab ' 
The name of the protagonist of the dedication men­tioned on Mural 7 offers further clues about the identity of the La Sufricaya elite and their rela­tionship to the dynasties of other sites. The name begins with the title mam, which can be translated as "grandfather" or "grandson." This title is com­mon in Early Classic inscriptions where it usually occurs at the beginning of personal names. It is quite possible that it was used with a more generic mean­ing in mind, marking people of importance but not necessarily relatives of those who commissioned the texts. The following block is eroded. The sign in the third block (Cl) composing the name can­not be securely identified with any known glyph, although it remotely resembles the so-called ":flam­ing ak'b'al" (AJ-) or some allographs of the K'AWIIL sign (e.g., Tikal Stela 3l:D21). The fourth block (C2) consists of another unique sign that represents a human head with a knotted nose pendant encircling the area of the mouth and an ear assemblage consisting of a dotted circle with an upturned ts'a-like element below (Figure 7) and cannot be read. 
The last hieroglyphic block in the name of the protagonist of the first clause (C3) spells the title chak tok wayaab' that can be translated as "cloud­red" wayaab' (Figure 7). The wayaab' title (usu. in combination with k'an tok or chak tok) is rela­tively common in the inscriptions from the sites in the Usumacinta River basin where it is carried by individuals of nonroyal descent, particularly by provincial governors of the sajal rank (Beliaev 2004). The paucity of references to nonroyal elites in Central and Eastern Peten corresponds nicely with the near-total absence of the title in local inscriptions. Apparently, the protagonist of the ded­ication event described on Mural 7 was not ajaw, "king," but someone important and powerful enough to commission palaces, temples, ball court, and monuments, albeit in the presence of a higher political authority. 
The actual meaning of the title and its social sig­nificance remain unknown. Dmitry Beliaev (2004) suggests translating wayaab' as "dreamer" and compares it with wayeyab '-the appellative of the four year bearers mentioned in connection with the new year ceremonies on pages 25-28 of the Dres­den Codex and in Diego de Landa's relaci6n (Tozzer 1941:135-149). The word wayaab' liter­ally means "sleeping place" and is a common term for temples as gods' domiciles (Stuart 1998:399-402). An alternative translation of the title would be "cloud-red temple [person]." The deity known as GI of the Palenque Triad is called yax wayaab' "the blue-green (or original) temple person" whereas G3 (Sun God) carries the title of k'ihnich taj{ al] wayaab' "the hot torch temple per­son" (Greene Robertson 1991:Figure 95; Schele and Freidel 1990:250). The same k'ihnich taj{al] wayaab' appears in the Early Classic inscriptions at Copan and Tikal although in unclear contexts (Stuart 2004 ). Either translation would suggest that the title chak tok wayaab' designated a priestly office of some kind. Evidently, the protagonist of the dedication event described on Mural 7 was not ajaw, "king," but someone with high-ranking sta­tus. 
The inscription on Mural 7 has provided one of the three known examples of the chak tok wayaab' title in the Holmul region. The first known exam-

pie came from a stingray spine found in 191 1 by Raymond E. Merwin in one of the Early Classic interments in the rooms of the Building B temple, in GroupII (Merwin and Vaillant 1932, pl. 36e; Stu­art, Houston and Robertson 1998:11-46). The inscription (Figure I Oc) states that the object is "the tooth of the 'Stingray paddler,' the stingray spine of the cloud-red wayaab" (Davletshin 2002). The artifact was part of the funerary offerings associ­ated with one of individuals placed on the floor of Room 2, which was also the richest burial in the building (Merwin and Vaillant 1932:66-71 ). It con­tained three superbly decorated Tzakol 2 vessels (one with skull offering) and large numbers of jade, shell and obsidian objects (Merwin and Vaillant 1932:68, Plate 25, 26). At La Sufricaya, on the other hand, the ceramic assemblage associated with the construction of the Structure 1 palace corre­sponds to the Tzakol 2 phase and the termination fill with the Tzakol 3 phase (Estrada-Belli 2001 ; 
Tomasic and Estrada Belli 2003). Therefore, the individual named in the La Sufricaya mural and the one buried with the inscribed stingray spine at Hol­mul were roughly contemporaneous in the fourth century. 
A third occurrence of the title chak tok wayaab' was discovered in the dedicatory text on a ceramic sherd from a Terminal Classic (A.D. 830-950) mid­den in Group III at Holmul (Tokovinine 2006). The midden was located in the southwestern comer of Court B, the main palace in the final decades prior to the site abandonment in the ninth century A.D. (Estrada-Belli 2004 ). It contained several inscribed fragments of locally produced Fine Orange vessels (Pabellon modeled-carved type; Figure 11). 
The fragment of the dedicatory formula includes the name of the owner of the vase (Figure 11 b): .. . B' ALAM?-ma CHAK-TOK-WAY-b'a .. . b'a{h]lam chak tok wayab' ... It has the attributes that may be expected of a Terminal Classic inscrip-

tion. First, the synharmonic WAY-b'a instead of WAY-b'i reflects the loss of vowel length and the eventual response of spelling conventions to the phonetic change (Houston, Stuart, and Robertson 1998:284-285, 291-292). Second, the sign T252 for b'a appears only in Terminal Classic and Post­classic texts such as codices in which there are examples of the substitution ofT252 by other b'a signs. 
Although there is no secure direct historical con­nection among the three occurrences of the chak tok wayaab' title (but the first two may represent one individual), these are the only cases in the East­ern Peten with firm archaeological provenience. The sacrifice of a notable individual carrying this title and from the Eastern Peten region ("seven provinces') was recorded on altars 1, 8, and on the Rock Sculpture at Tikal in A.D. 748, at the end of a lengthy Tikal-Naranjo war (Figure 10; Martin and Grube 2000:50). It is also striking that this title was in use at Holmul from the Early Classic to the Ter­minal Classic. It is therefore likely that the chak tok wayaab' title in the Eastern Peten was specific to the Holmul and Naranjo elites. 
The Significance of the La Sufricaya Palace in Maya Dynastic Politics 
Murals 7 and 9 together with their associated archi­tecture help identify the function of Structure 1 as a multiroom elite palace. According to the avail­able ceramic evidence, it was built by A.D. 350 and was expanded until its termination inA.D. 450/500. As such, this complex represents one of the earli­est known palaces in the Maya Lowlands (cf. Coe 1990; Traxler 2001). The additional fact that sev­eral Early Classic monuments with dates from AD. 375/396 to A.D. 422 have been found in the imme­diacy of this acropolis (Estrada-Belli 2001; Grube 2003), suggests that the Structure 1 complex served the function of a ruler's house and household in accordance with Inomata and Houston's (2001:9) definition of a royal palace. Its use was relatively short-lived and the non-Maya iconography on its architecture and on the artifacts found within denote stylistic choices that persisted at the site for only about a century. 

The mythological character of Mural 9 and its position within room Sub 13 are consistent with the decor of a Maya elite residence. The mural was the backdrop to the occupants sitting on mats and cush­ions in front of the room's central doorway. Its con­tent likely referred to a mythological episode involving Itzamnaaj of the sort that often appears on elite painted ceramic vessels (Beliaev and Davletsin 2006) As an artistic composition, this was certainly created by a Maya author with elite taste and esoteric knowledge. 
On the other hand, the iconography of the graf­fiti figure on Mural 9 represents a completely dif­ferent theme, that of warriors in Central Mexican style, which also occurs in another room's mural (Room 1) in the same palace. Moreover, the epig­raphy of Mural 7 presents supporting evidence on

the unique significance of an arrival event at Tikal that is often associated with Teotihuacan imagery. It is likely very significant that this historical event was celebrated, and widely recognized as a defin­ing moment in a Peten polity of much lesser impor­tance than Tikal such as Holmul, within whose urban ea the La Sufricaya palace is located. This text may make direct reference to the establish­ment of a new political order in connection with the arrival event at Tikal (Coggins 1979; Prosk­ouriakoff 1993; Stuart 2000ab ). More indirectly, it may also hint at the transient political situation at Tikal only one year after the event itself. Mural 7 was painted during the 2-year interregnum between the death of Chaak Tok /ch' aak(on the day of Sihyaj K'a hk's arrival) and the accession of Ya x Nuun Ahiin while presumably there was no king on the Tikal throne, officially. The dedication date at La Sufricaya is 204 days prior to the new ruler's acces­sion on 8.17.2.16.17 5 Kaha n 10 Yaxk'in (Sep­tember 13, A.D. 379). The narning ofSihyajK'ahk' on a monument (Stela 6) and the possible indirect reference to Sihya j K 'ahk' as the K 'awiil in Mural 7 at the peripheral La Sufricaya palace at this time 

corroborate the notion that this figure, who was also accompanied by the title of kaloomte' other­wise reserved to the most powerful overlords, was "the" higher power at Tikal during the interregnum period and during the reign of the young Ya x Nuun Ahiin (Martin and Grube 2000; Stuart 2000b ). 
The iconographic motifs on architecture and arti­facts found in the La Sufricaya palace are strongly associated with Teotihuacan imagery, similarly to coeval elite compounds at Tikal and at a few other Lowland sites. Among the most salient features are painted figures wearing the costume of Central Mex­ican warriors in the murals of Room 1 (Figure 12), ceramic vessel forms such as cylinder vessels dec­orated with Central Mexican and Maya iconogra­phy (Figure 13), scores of green obsidian blades from Mexican sources, chert spearthrower-dart points, and architectural decorations reminiscent of Central Mexico (Figure 14; Estrada-Belli 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006; Estrada-Belli and Foley 2004; Hruby 2006). The scenes depicting warrior figures seemingly refer to events occurred at this same location or nearby, as it is common in Maya iconography (Stuart and Houston 1994). Fur-

thermore, the La Sufricaya warrior figures are por­trayed in peaceful postures and next to an equal number of standing Maya figures; the iconography on the vessels shows a blend of Maya and Teoti­huacan forms (Figure 13); a form of recessed panel framed by tenoned stones similar to a Teotihuacan tablero is used on the upper frieze of buildings as in Group 6C-XVI at Tikal, but not to decorate the basal platforms as is the norm at Teotihuacan (Fig­ure 15); and the inscription from Mural 7, although it mentions an "arrival" at Tikal, it celebrates the rit­ual of a local lord (with a local title) and gives no hint to any direct relationship with the outsiders. In sum, the La Sufricaya iconography and artifacts represent a peculiar blend of Lowland Maya and Teotihuacan traits that is otherwise best represented at Tikal during this time (Coggins 1975; Culbert 
1993; Laporte and Fialko 1987). From archaeological deposits we know that prior to the construction of the palace acropolis La 

Sufricaya saw no elite activity, whereas at Holmul, there had been elite buildings beginning in the Mid­dle Preclassic period (since 800 B.C.) in Bul.lding B of Group II (Estrada-Belli 2005, 2006; Merwin and Vaillant 1932; Neivens de Estrada 2006). This temple's rooms became the burial place for a num­ber (15) of elite individuals including a chak tok wayaab' of the Early Classic period (coeval with Manik 2 and Tzakol 2 phases ofTikal and Uaxac­tun; Laporte and Fialko 1990; R. E. Smith 1950). It is still unclear if the chak tok wayaab' interred in Building B is the same person who dedicated Mural 7 in the La Sufricaya palace. There is the additional uncertainty on whether we are dealing with a title or a personal name. So we cannot, with the present evidence, determine if chak tok wayaab' was the ruler ofHolmul or a high-ranking member of the site's elite. The first alternative is more likely given the exclusivity of hieroglyphic inscriptions dealing with historical events and

period endings to royal contexts, especially in the Early Classic period. The long sequence of burials in Building B shows that there had been a ruling lineage firmly rooted at Holmul long before A.D. 
350. However, commemorative texts on stone mon­uments and buildings at La Sufricaya between A.D. 375 and A.D. 422 indeed represented a new fea­ture oflocal ceremonialism and possibly a new sta­tus reached by the ruling elite. 
The La Sufricaya palace, with its associated ball court, carved monuments, and two funerary tem­ples was a place of royal residence and ritual situ­ated 1 km from the ceremonial core of Holmul for perhaps only a century. It was sufficiently close to the main ceremonial core to be considered part of the ruling Holmul elite but too close to be an inde­pendent political entity. To date, no carved monu­ment from this time period has been found in the Holmul center, so we hypothesize that centraliza­tion shifted to La Sufricaya, at least in the A.D. 350-A.D. 450 period most closely marked by the buildings and monuments dedication. One may wonder why the Holmul rulers would move out of the center only to move back to the original loca­tion after a few decades. Indeed, this happens to be the only period in the Holmul sequence in which we have evidence of interaction with Tikal. The interaction is thus correlated with the move, was an equally short-lived phenomenon. Finally, it 

appears that the connection with Tikal had ended by the time the seat of power returned to the Hol­mul hill. 
The political changes that involved the founda­tions of Classic Maya dynasties either ex novo or as a result of a shift from a political faction to another are often accompanied by changes in the physical location of dynastic buildings, including the founder's burial structure. Laporte and Fialko ( 1990) argue that at Tikal a shift in power from one lineage to another and the advent of Yax Nuun Ahiin inA.D. 379 was associated with changes in the loca­tion of ritual activity and royal burials. Beginning with the arrival of foreign traits at the site (decades prior to Sihyaj K' ahk's own arrival) the function of the Mundo Perdido plaza changed from being mainly related to calendar rituals to becoming the burial ground of a high elite family, possibly includ­ing the last ruler of the Jaguar Paw lineage, in A.D. 378 (Laporte and Fialko 1990). By contrast, the next ruler in the sequence, Yax Nuun Ahiin, whose lineage was evidently associated with Teotihuacan and Sihyaj K'ahk', and mostofhis successors were subsequently buried in the North Acropolis with the earlier dynasty's ancestors. At the same time, the eastern-focused astronomical layout of Mundo Per­dido's "E-Group" was altered by the addition of new temples in foreign style creating a new plaza to its west. Some ritual activity also occurred in an

elite residential location, Group 6C-XVI, espe­cially related to elite burials and the ball game. There, and in Group 6D-V the highest concentra­tion of Teotihuacan traits from burials, offerings, and residential refuse contexts in all of Tikal was found. Eventually, in the sixth century AD., the associations between Tikal and Teotihuacan faded away (Coe 1990; Laporte and Fialko 1990; Laporte et al. 1992 ). Tikal entered into a costly conflict with the rival city of Calakmul and suffered a major defeat in A.D. 562 (Martin and Grube 2000). The destruction and/or dispersal of monuments related to Yax Nuun Ahiin and his successors, including Sihyaj Chan K'awiil, date to this period (Jones 
1991; see also above discussion oflacunae in Sihyaj Chan K' awiil' s record). A period of diminished rit­ual activity at Tikal known as the "hiatus" ensued until the renewal of Tikal's power with the ruler Jasaw Chan K'awiil's victory over Calakmul in AD. 695 (Martin and Grube 2000). Although the North Acropolis had remained the most important area for dynastic rituals throughout the Classic period the process of renewal of the Tikal dynasty by Jasaw Chan K'awiil involved repeated refer­ences to the glorious past associations with Teoti­huacan (Martin and Grube 2000; Stuart 2000b ). 
At Copan, the arrival of K'ihnich Yax K'uk' Mo' resulted in the foundation of the first dynastic palace and ritual buildings on new ground. This occurred in a new location a couple of hundred meters away from the previous focus of ritual activity at the site (Traxler 2004). Once established, this location maintained its significance for dynastic rituals until the end of the Copan dynasty in the ninth century. Hunal, the structure containing the burial of the dynastic founder underneath temple lOL-16 remained the focal point for subsequent dynastic temples and burials. This pattern continued through the reign of the 16th ruler, Yax Pasaj Chan Yopaat who inaugurated the last version of the lOL-16 temple with portraits of K'ihnichYaxK'uk'Mo' and Teotihucan-related imagery (Agurcia Fasquelle and Fash 2005; Fash and Fash 2000; Sharer 1997, 2003; Taube 2004; Traxler 2001). 
At Uaxactun, during the middle part of the Early Classic period (Tzakol 2 phase, Ledyard A Smith 1950) and in connection with the erection of mon­uments commemorating Sihyaj K' ahk' himself, the ruler's palace compound was moved to a new loca­tion, Group A-V. In this group, five rulers with links to Tikal and Teotihuacan were interred dur­ing the next phase (Tzakol 3, Laporte and Fialko 1990:57; R. E. Smith 1950; Valdes et al. 1999). 
There is one important difference in the paral­lels between Tikal, Uaxactun, Copan, and Hol­mul/La Sufricaya. At U axactun and Copan, the seat of power continued to be the same during the Late Classic Period. Whereas its rulers continued to have close ties to Tikal and its historical record experi­enced a similar hiatus as Tikal, the integrity of the site was maintained throughout that period. On the other hand, Tikal and Holmul/La Sufricaya were affected by a destructive episode that correlates with Tikal's defeat by Calakmul in AD. 562. It is thus not coincidental that the La Sufricaya palace was buried and its monuments destroyed during the 
. 
latter part of the Early Classic period (post AD. 500 and prior to AD. 600; and to the end of Uax­actun Tzakol 3 and Tikal Manik 3 phases, Callaghan 2006; Bernard Hermes, personal com­munication 2002; R. E. Smith 1950; Laporte and Fialko 1990) at the same time as and in the same way as Tikal's Group 6C-XVI was buried and its dynastic monuments associated with Teotihuacan imagery destroyed. In connection with these events, any ties between the Tikal and Holmul polities were terminated. 
During the Late Classic period, the Holmul elite became closely tied with the Naranjo kingdom, according to later inscriptions at Holmul (Tokovi­nine 2006). Naranjo itself was at that time an ally of Calakmul and the target of repeated attacks by Tikal in the eighth century (Martin and Grube 2000). 
In sum, there are several direct parallels with Tikal's Group 6C-XVI in the chronology of occu­pation, use of motifs inspired by Teotihacan mixed with local styles and textual references to suggest that La Sufricaya's Early Classic occupation was because of a political connection with those Tikal elites. The palace and associated ritual plaza at La Sufricaya were subsequently abandoned as those political ties were lost. As at Tikal, at Holmul/La Sufricaya the use ofTeotihuacan imagery was inter­rupted by the early sixth century. In AD. 562, as Tikal suffered its major defeat by Calakmul (Mar­tin and Grube 2000) its stelae were destroyed, the residential groups most closely associated with the use of Teotihuacan imagery were deeply buried and their memory erased. Similarly, La Sufricaya' s

early monuments were destroyed and the buildings buried at this time. We hypothesize that the move from Holmul to La Sufricaya was originally because of a shift in power from one Holmul lin­eage to another, and perhaps more significantly to a political alliance with a pro-Teotihuacan Tikal ruler. In the sixth century A.D., as the La Sufricaya palace was abandoned, all connections with Tikal and/or Teotihuacan were obliterated and the seat of power likely returned to the Holmul center and a pro-Naranjo/pro-Calakmul and anti-Tikal lin­eage. 
Conclusions 
The murals and associated artifacts from the La Sufricaya palace discussed in this article are best viewed as contributing to our understanding of the political dynamics among Early Classic Maya cities at different levels in regional hierarchies while also offering few details on the relationship between the Maya and Teotihuacan. Recently, the debate has been reinvigorated by new evidence and publica­tions dedicated at summarizing datasets and inter­pretations that bridge the fields of archaeology, epigraphy, and iconography (Andrews and Fash 2005; Bell et al. 2004; Braswell 2003; Carrasco et al. 2000). The interpretative positions on this issue range from those models that include the presence ofTeotihuacan military enclaves in the Maya Low­lands, Highlands, and Pacific Coast, suggestions that new rulers were imposed onto the locals by mil­itary force, and that foreign enclaves were kept at key places (e.g., Tikal and Kaminaljuyu; see Adams 1986; Bove and Medrano 2003; Coggins 1975; Cowgill 2003; Martin and Grube 2000; Proskouri­akoff 1993; Sanders and Price 1968; Stuart2000b) through more moderate positions according to which combinations of political factionalism, rit­ual visits, intermarriage, and political alliance or intervention resulted in the mixing of Maya and Central Mexican traits during the Early Classic period (Fash and Fash 2000; Fash et al. 2004; Sharer 1997, 2003, 2004). Yet others interpret the use of Central Mexican iconography in Maya art as a result of emulation of foreign styles by Maya Low­land elites claiming real or imagined exotic con­nections with distant centers of higher learning (Braswell 2003; Carrasco et al. 2000; Demarest and Foias 1993; Laporte and Fialko 1990; Schele 
and Freidel 1990; Stone 1989). According to Joyce Marcus (2003), among the various types of con­tacts possible between the Maya and Teotihucan, a direct protracted foreign presence in the Low lands has been overstated, and other types of contacts are more likely to have been the norm. These include single event interaction (as at Altun Ha, Belize; Pendergast 1971 ), multistage interaction initiated by marriage/alliance, simple dyadic interaction with Teotihuacan as the sole foreign culture inter­acting with the Maya, and finally interactions medi­ated by cities such as Tikal and Kaminaljuyu within their respective regions. As many have noted, there is such a degree of variability in the evidence of contact between Teotihuacan and the Maya that no single model can account for all instances. In the case presented here, the La Sufricaya evidence does point to a specific time and mode of interaction through which foreign traits are channeled. 
The La Sufricaya dataset combines epigraphic and archaeological data from a confined, single­phase location and shares many similarities with coeval datasets at Tikal, U axactun, and Copan. These qualities may help give insights into the chronology and historical significance of the inter­actions among certain Maya cities with and with­out Teotihuacan-style iconography: 
(1) 
At La Sufricaya, elite architecture and for­eign traits are in use for a short period of time between A.D. 350 and A.D. 450 and are part of a shift in political power from the Holmul center. 

(2) 
The construction of the first rooms and murals with foreign traits in Structure 1 may pre­date by a few years the arrival event of A.D. 378, according to ceramic, architectural, and text data. Similarly, the use of foreign traits in architecture and iconography at Tikal and Uaxactun is believed to predate the arrival event (Laporte and Fialko 

1990; Valdes et al. 1999). 

(3) 
The La Sufricaya Mural 7 text is unique in celebrating the arrival event at Tikal just 1 year after it had occurred. This is a time in which the political and stylistic impact of Teotihuacan con­tacts was presumably strongest at Tikal. 

(4) 
The iconography and style of Mural 9 are purely Maya and the text of Mural 7 speaks of a Maya lord whose name included the title chak tok wayaab dedicating a monument in this location to celebrate a new foundation on the anniversary of a Tikal event. This title is linked to a contemporary

elite individual buried in Building B at Holmul and is used in the Holmul region throughout the Clas­sic period. Therefore, this chak tok wayaab' was likely a high-ranking member of the Holmul rul­ing elite who assumed a new role at La Sufricaya. Holmul as a seat of a ruling lineage predated and outlasted the episode of ritual activity at La Sufricaya. In all likelihood, this episode was initi­ated by one of several competing lineages. There­fore, the erection of carved monuments and a palace there cannot constitute the establishment of a dynasty ex novo but a shift of power (royal or sub­royal) from one local faction to another backed by outside intervention. 
(5)After the recording of the event on the Mural 7 inscription, the La Sufricaya complex maintained its palatial functions for several decades until approximately A.D. 450/550, at which point it was terminated and buried completely. 
(6) 
The objects found in the fill of the rooms, which were likely redeposited from nearby mid­dens, denote a blend of Maya and Teotihuacan styles and proveniences (only attested for Mexican and Guatemalan obsidian). 

(7) 
Subsequent architecture at La Sufricaya was neither elite nor ritual in character. The following Late Classic period was characterized by the absolute absence of any iconographic references to Central Mexico from the entire Holmul regional assemblage. 


One possible inference to be made from the La Sufricaya dataset is that during the period between 
A.D. 350 and A.D. 450, the rise of a new lineage to power at Holmul and La Sufricaya was backed or sanctioned by outsiders linked to the Sihyaj K'ahk' figure, the kingdom of Tikal and, however indirectly, the distant city of Teotihuacan. This alleged political alliance was certainly a short-lived affair and it is not clear whether it could have been an imposition or an intervention welcomed by the local faction. Interestingly enough, the dates of La Sufricaya monuments correlate with the lifespans of Sihyaj K' ahk' and Tikal rulers Yax Nuun Ahiin 
(A .D. 379-A.D. 404?) and Sihyaj Chan K'awiil 
(A.D. 41 1-A.D. 450) (Martin and Grube 2000:32). Only two Early Classic period figures are known from inscriptions at Holmul, one is most likely a nonroyal title, chak tok wayaab, the other possibly a ruler by the name of Aj Wosaaj (Estrada-Belli 2001; Grube 2003). Both figures appear to have exercised their power from the off-center palace of La Sufricaya and therefore their power may some­how be linked to Tikal. It is fairly clear that once the political connection with Tikal/Teotihuacan was severed, chaak tok wayaab's and Aj Wosaaj's suc­cessors ruled from the main Holmul palace com­pound (Group III), whereas commoner's houses stood above the buried La Sufricaya palace. The Holmul polity thereafter continued to be in the sphere of the Naranjo kings until its demise. 
The epigraphy and archaeology of La Sufricaya support the hypothesis that the so-called influx of Central Mexican traits in the southern Maya Low­lands in the Early Classic did not directly emanate from Teotihuacan but was largely related to Tikal's expansion of its political influence at a number of sites, such as Uaxactun, Copan, and Holnrul/La Sufricaya. Furthermore, it appears that if any con­tingent of Central Mexicans was present at La Sufricaya, this was very small and highly accul­turated with the Maya. Future investigations will determine whether the use of Central Mexican traits was more socially widespread. Unfortunately, the La Sufricaya evidence offers little to elucidate the conditions and events that brought Teotihuacan material culture into Tikal, although a higher order of political intervention or alliance is likely there, as well. 
At La Sufricaya, which was in the outskirts of a kingdom of tertiary significance in the Southern Maya Lowlands, Holmul, the appearance ofTeoti­hucan material culture was likely a result of Tikal rulers' military and trade partnership with the Cen­tral Mexican urban center (Cowgill 2003 ; Culbert 2004). As the above model also implies, the Teoti­huacan cultural manifestations were less marked at La Sufricaya, as they had already been filtered by the Tikal elites. Subsequently, in the sixth cen­tury, as the Tikal kingdom suffered major defeats, the La Sufricaya faction likely lost its support and suffered the negative repercussions of its associa­tion with Tikal. After the La Sufricaya palace's bur ­ial, never again were signs of ties with Teotihuacan or Tikal visible in the Holmul iconographic record, as it remained in the sphere of influence of one of Tikal's rivals, Naranjo, and by extension ofCalak­mul. At Tikal, by contrast, once the royal lineage regained its independence and political clout, the historical arrival event and its connections with Teotihuacan were remembered and celebrated in

royal monuments as a turning point in the king­dom's history, as an era of heroic victories and new rituals forever to be reckoned (Coggins 197 5, 1979; Proskouriakoff 1993; Stuart 2000b). 
The present interpretation of the La Sufricaya evidence places a greater explanatory value on the internal dynamics of Maya interpolity alliance net­works and how they affected lower-tier sites than on generalized cross-cultural contacts. Many ques­tions remain unanswered. Indeed, the establish­ment of a new palace location away from the Holmul center at La Sufricaya ca. A.D. 350 could be because of a junior lineage aspiring to the ruler's seat, mirroring the process for the change of power at Tikal enacted by the Sihyaj K'ahk' lineage as hypothesized by Laporte and Fialko ( 1990) or as a direct intervention of an outside power into a local struggle as hypothesized by Culbert (2004). In the case of Tikal a local faction may well have won a struggle for royal succession with military aid from a higher power, Teotihuacan, or through the acqui­sitions of symbols of power from a center of higher learning, but the La Sufricaya data do not shed light on this point. At Holmul, the political struggle among local lineages appears to have been resolved in favor of a local lineage allied to the Teotihuacan­backed Tikal rising power. Direct military inter­
vention from Teotihuacan remains elusive and unlikely. The occurrence of some Central Mexican iconography at La Sufricaya could be the result of brief visits by the new Holmul ruling lineage to Tikal or other site with Teotihuacan-style material culture as part of a new form of accession process, as it may also have been the case in the accessions of Yax NuunAhiin at Tikal and K'ihnich Yax K'u k' Mo' at Copan. Frequently, in Postclassic Mesoamerica, symbols of power were invested onto a ruler from an outside higher power, or cen­ter of religious "higher learning" (Carrasco et al. 2000). This ceremony would serve to de-emphasize any break in the expected line of succession. As the record of the K'iche' kings indicates, obtaining the tools of kingship from a Tollan was often part of the Maya ritual of royal accessions (Fash and Fash 2000). Such visits abroad likely resulted in an attempt by Maya artists to emulate foreign objects and symbols by melding them with local styles. 
At Holmul, the alleged break from the tradi­
tional power lines did not have a lasting impact. At 
the onset of the Late Classic period, the Holmul 
ruling lineage rapidly returned to power inflicting damnatio memoriae on its rivals. This is one impor­tant point in which the Holmul record diverges from that ofTikal. There, too, the references to the arrival from Teotihuacan were erased in connec­tion to Tikal's VI century demise, but the Early Classic period" 11 Eb" arrival event was celebrated again as soon as the Tikal's dynasty regained its power over other Maya kingdoms (Coggins 1975; Fash and Fash 2000; Martin and Grube 2000; Sharer 2004; Sharer and Traxler 2006). 
As Marcus's (2003) multistage interaction model predicts, the Holmul case of interaction with Teotihuacan was indirect, mediated by another Maya center, and involving visits with multiple functions. It likely included ritual interaction and political alliance, stimulated by processes internal to the Maya political system, and is an example of how rapidly political ties can change. 
In conclusion, the proposed scenarios are likely to be improved on as excavations in the Holmul region and elsewhere continue. The current evi­dence relates to a few of the many modes of inter­action that may have existed between the Maya and Central Mexico during the Classic period. The time-specific data from the La Sufricaya palace, Uaxactun, Copan, and Tikal support the hypothe­sis that the appearance ofTeotihuacan traits at least at those sites in the Early Classic period was fun­damentally because ofTikal's political expansion­ism and that smaller sites such as Holmul/La Sufricaya across the Southern Maya Lowlands lacked any direct connections with Teotihuacan.

Notes 
1. 
As in Mural 7, the plaster and paint of Mural 9 were first cleaned and stabilized by conservator Alberto Semeraro. Subsequently, Gene Ware documented the text with multi­spectral digital imagery (in 2005) and Heather Hurst traced each block on acetate film. The Mural 9 text was drawn by Alex Tokovinine, while the figures were traced by Alberto Semeraro and Francisco Estrada-Belli. 

2. 
We refer to this Tikal monument as the "Marker" throughout the article following its published denomination as Tikal Marker or Marcador by Laporte and Fialko (1990) because of its resemblance to a similar object found at Teotihuacan even though no examples of this type of object have been attested in ball-court contexts anywhere.
