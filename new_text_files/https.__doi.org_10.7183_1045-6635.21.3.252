VESSELS FOR CEREMONY: THE PICTOGRAPHY OF CODEX-STYLE 
MIXTECA-PUEBLA VESSELS FROM CENTRAL AND SOUTH MEXICO 

Gilda Hernandez Sanchez 
An excellent illustration of the strong intertwinement of the art, image, text, and ritual characteristics of the ancient Amer­icas is the codex-style pottery of the Mixteca-Puebla style. These ceramics, together with painted books and murals, were manifestations of an artistic style and iconography known as the Mixteca-Puebla style, which developed in central and south Mexico during the late Postclassic period (A.D. 1250-1521). Scholars have long recognized the motifs depicted on these vessels as part of the iconographic corpus of the Borgia group and Mixtec codices, and they have proposed that these ves­sels had ceremonial uses. A recent study of a large sample of these artifacts from the Puebla-Tlaxcala Valley, central Ver­acruz, the Mixtec region, the Valley of Oaxaca, and the Basin of Mexico confirms both suggestions, showing that the vessels' painted images were more than mere decoration; they conformed to a pictography that referred to essential notions of Mesoamerican rituality. It is proposed that the meaning of this pictography was related to the context in which the vessels were used. Most likely the painted signs conveyed meanings by using stylistic devices of Mesoamerican ceremonial lan­guage. Addressed here are the mechanisms of this pictography, the progress made in reading it, and insights into the ves­sels ' use context. 
Una excelente ilustracion de la fuerte relacion entre arte, imagen, texto y ritual que caracterizo a la America antigua es la certimica tipo codice del estilo Mixteca-Puebla. Vasijas de esta certimica, }unto con libros pintados y murales, fueron mani­festaciones de un estilo artfstico e iconogrtifico hoy conocido coma estilo Mixteca-Puebla. Este se desarrollo en el centro y sur de Mexico durante el Postcltisico Tard{o (1250-1521 d. C.). Desde inicios del siglo XX los especialistas han reconocido que los motivos pintados en estas vasijas fueron parte def corpus iconogrtifico de Los codices del grupo Borgia y mixtecos, y ademtis han propuesto que estas tenian un uso ceremonial. Un estudio reciente de una muestra grande de estos artefactos proveniente del Valle de Puebla-Tlaxcala, el centro de Veracruz, la region Mixteca, el Valle de Oaxaca, y la Cuenca de Me­xico, no solo confirma ambas ideas, sino que tambien muestra que las imtigenes pintadas en las vasijas eran mas que simple decoracion. Las imtigenes conformaban una pictografia que hacia referencia a nociones esenciales de la prtictica ritual mesoamericana. Aqui se propane que Los significados de los signos pintados estaban relacionados con el contexto en el que las vasijas eran usadas. Muy probablemente Los signos pintados transmitfan infonnaci6n usando recnicas estilfsticas del lenguaje ceremonial de Mesoamerica, coma difrasismos, paralelismos y repeticiones.

he strong intertwinement of art, image, text, Tand the ritual characteristics of the ancient Americas is best exemplified by the Mesoamerican tradition of painted books, such as the Mixtec and Borgia group codices. These codices registered, through systems of painted ele­ments, historical, calendrical, and religious infor­mation that played an important role in ceremonial life. Today these books are excellent primary sources to explore precolonial rituality. They not only give important insights into indigenous world­view but also show how art, pictorial representa­tions, and registers of information were combined in ceremonial contexts. These books were made and used by specialists and thus evidence these specialists' particular view of ritual practices. In some places, in addition to these books, fine ceramic vessels with ritual-related iconography were also used in ritual contexts. These vessels offer the possibility to explore other perspectives of ceremonial life that may be considered more inclusive and representative than the codices. They also had wider distribution than codices, had direct involvement in ritual praxis, and have been better

Codex-Style Pottery of the 
Mixteca-Puebla Style 

On Bernal Dfaz del Castillo's visit to Cholula it seems that he was impressed by the "very good ves­sels of red, dark and white clay, with diverse paint­ings" (1980:149) produced there, as they deserved a mention in his chronicle of the conquest, which other wise lacks references to indigenous clay arti­facts. He probably had in mind one of the finest and most elaborate ceramic traditions of Mesoamerica, which today is known as the codex­style pottery of the Mixteca-Puebla style. These vessels were produced in Cholula but also in sev­eral other places in the Puebla-Tlaxcala Valley, cen­tral Veracruz, the Mixtec region, the Valley of Oaxaca, and the Basin of Mexico during the late Postclassic period (A.O. 1250-1521; Figure 1). Nowadays they are referred to as codex-style because they use the same representational tech­nique as the ancient native painted books, specifi­cally the Borgia group and Mixtec codices (Robertson 1963:156-157). 
The vessels, together with these codices and several mural paintings, were manifestations of a colorful artistic style andiconography known as the Mixteca-Puebla style (Boone and Smith 2003a; Nicholson 1960, 1966, 1982; Nicholson and

Quinones 1994; Smith 2003). This style was char­acterized by geometrical precision, standardiza­tion, and conventionalization of symbols, as well as the use of color to convey information (Nichol­son 1960). Following the parameters drawn by Michael Smith (2003:182), the Mixteca-Puebla is today seen as a substyle of the more inclusive Post­classic International Style, a broad group of regional painting styles with similar use of form, line, color, spatial arrangement, and figural con­ventions that extended throughout Mesoamerica during the Postclassic period. The Mixteca-Puebla iconography, in contrast, was a particular set of images and signs. It was able to represent histori­cal information, as is the case with the Mixtec codices made in this style (e.g., Anders et al. 1992; Caso 1960; Jansen and Perez Jimenez 2000; Smith 1973), as well as calendrical, divinatory, religious, and ritual information, as is shown in the Borgia group codices (e.g., Anders and Jansen 1993; Anders et al. 1993; Boone 2007; Nowotny 1961). Such iconography can be considered a pictography, since the painted elements are signs representing objects and actions that conform to a system of images to communicate information (Dibble 1971:324). 
Polychrome vessels similar in style to the Mixteca-Puebla pottery have been found as far as the Greater Nicoya region in Costa Rica (Day 1994; McCafferty and Steinbrenner 2005) and western Mexico (Ekholm 1942; Meighan 1971:761), indi­cating that this style had a broad sphere of influ­ence. Such Mixteca-Puebla-like vessels also had a wide temporal distribution: they have been found in late and early Postclassic and even Epiclassic contexts (McCafferty 2001; McCafferty and Stein­brenner 2005; Smith and Heath-Smith 1980). These vessels, however, although ostensibly similar in style, are not so similar in terms of iconography to the codex-style vessels studied here. As Boone and Smith (2003a: 189) argue, the Mixteca-Puebla style-as manifested in codices, murals, and ceramics-appears after A.D. 1200 and is almost always accompanied by a particular iconography called the late Postclassic International Symbol set. Pottery in this style and iconography was confined to the Mixteca-Puebla region, the Valley of Oax­aca, central Veracruz, and the Basin of Mexico. 
The current interest in codex-style vessels stems from the beginning of the twentieth century, when Eduard Seler (1908:522) recognized that the motifs depicted on these artifacts were part of the icono­graphic corpus of the Borgia and Mixtec codices. Later, Hermann Beyer ( 1969:469) proposed that the high quality and decoration of such vessels suggest ceremonial use. Both ideas have been supported by other specialists (Chadwick 1971 :240; Contreras 1994: 12; McCafferty 1994: 72; M tiller 197 8; Nicholson 1982:243; Noguera 1954:141; Pohl 1998, 2003, 2007a; Quinones 1994; Ramsey 1982; Smith and Heath-Smith 1980:33). They were also confirmed by the first extensive study of these' ceramics conducted by Michael Lind ( 1967, 1994 ), who compared samples of vessels from different areas in the Mixteca-Puebla region. These ideas were again supported by my recent analysis of a large sample of codex-style vessels, an investiga­tion that aimed to explore the meaning of their painted motifs (Hernandez 2005). 
Thanks to these studies the early ideas of Seler and Beyer have been elaborated upon. As I will comment upon here, it is now recognized that the vessels' decoration was a pictography. Further­more, I will discuss the progress made in reading the information and the evidence for the vessels' use context. The pictography and vessel shape sug­gest that codex-style ceramics were created for rit­ual purposes, especially for feasting, but probably also for other ceremonial activities. This pictogra­phy referred to essential notions of Mesoamerican ritual practice. It is most likely that the painted signs conveyed meanings by using stylistic devices of the ceremonial language of Mesoamerica. These meanings were related to the context in which the vessels were used. 
Vessels with Ritual-Related Iconography in the Ancient Americas 

In the ancient Americas various traditions of fine pottery with ritual iconography were developed. A few of them have been studied in detail, so that they are a good reference for exploring Mixteca­Puebla pottery. Well known today is the Maya codex-style pottery of the Classic period (A.D. 300-900). It was decorated with pictorial images and a few glyphic texts. The images were highly varied, representing gods and both public and pri­vate rituals of the nobility (Reents-Budet 1994:12-14). The glyphic texts were mainly pho-

netic, with some signs representing the sounds of 
syllables and others representing whole words in 
a particular language (logo grams). However, they 
were also pictographic (word signs picturing the 
object recorded [Coe and van Stone 2005:18; 
Schele and Grube 1994:4 ]). The texts were used 
as compositional devices in order to create an aes­
thetic balance with the painted decoration but were 
generally independent of the painted images 
(Reents-Budet 1994:12-14). These glyphic texts 
were often the well-known Primary Standard 
Sequence (PSS), a formula that used a dedicatory 
statement referring to the act of painting the pot, 
followed by the mention of its shape and original 
contents, the name of the patron or owner, and the 
artist (Grube 1990:322-325; Houston et al. 
1989:720). Images and texts were in some cases 
remarkably redundant and used coupled struc­
tures, a device common in Maya oral traditions, 
consisting of paired clauses that relate the same 
information in a slightly altered manner (Schele 
and Grube 1994:68, 71). According to Dorie 
Reents-Budet (1 994:74), Maya codex-style ves­
sels functioned as funerary wares, had a central 
role during important ritual events, and served as 
a social currency. 
In Teotihuacan (ca. A.D. 150-650), in central Mexico, polychrome pottery vessels in codex style were also manufactured. They were decorated with pictorial images and conventionalized signs that were separated from their natural context and often formed clusters (Langley 1986, 1991). This nota­tion, however, is still poorly understood. For George Kubler (1967:5), depictions on these vessels show the characteristic structure of litany. That is, most of the signs seem to be nominal expressions for beings, substances, and concepts; there are few adjectives, and verbs are very scarce. The themes represented on the vessels were religious and mil­
, itaristic (Langley 1991 :296), which suggests that 
they were involved in various uses and contexts. 
In the Andean region, the Moche of the North 
Coast of Peru (ca. A.D. 100-800) also created poly­
chrome codex-style ceramics. According to Mar­
garet Jackson (2008:3, 155), they depict 
pictography that communicated cultural narratives 
like sacred history, legends, and moral tales. This 
pictography was composed of individual signs and 
clusters of signs, which in some cases may have 
had limited linguistic correlates, although they do appear to have been arranged according to syntac­tic structures of the Muchic language, spoken in the region at that time (Jackson 2008:88-91). 
It is notable that Maya, Teotihuacan, and Moche codex-style ceramics depicted signs arranged according to certain structures of the spoken lan­guage. Even signs that do not seem to be phonetic show this pattern. Also common to these vessels are the diverse ritual themes that were represented, which suggests that they were not restricted to a specific ceremonial procedure. As it will be shown, these two observations also apply to Mixteca­Puebla ceramics. 
The Study of Codex-Style Pottery 
A first challenge in the study of codex-style ves­sels is that although information usually exists with respect to place or region of origin, it is in few cases that the available data specify the context of depo­sition. Moreover, early colonial documents do not provide concrete references to this type of mater­ial culture. In consequence, the key to approach­ing these vessels is to interpret their painted decoration. Today this is possible because we are able to assign a specific word or a meaning to many of the Mixteca-Puebla-style pictographic motifs that corresponds to their original significance, since several existing early colonial painted books and documents illustrate, in similar style, prehispanic objects and activities with their explanations. For example, the Codex Mendoza (Berdan and Anawalt 1992), created around 1540, shows lists of motifs with explanatory glosses in Spanish, and the Codex Telleriano-Remensis (Quinones 1995), dated from ca. 1565 (Leon Portilla 1992: 155), represents images of gods and ceremonies with glosses and descriptive texts in Spanish. 
Between 2000 and 2005 I studied a large sam­ple of codex-style vessels of the Mixteca-Puebla style in order to explore the meaning of their painted decoration (Hernandez 2004a, 2004b, 2005). For this purpose, I sought in archaeological collections, museums, and publications polychrome vessels with painted decoration in the style of the Mixteca­Puebla codices. They should be dated to the sec­ond part of the Postclassic period and proceeded from the Mixteca-Puebla style region, where the most characteristic examples of these vessels were manufactured and used. Thus, the data set con-

sisted of 467 objects, which were all known, acces­sible codex-style vessels or large fragments of the same, from several sites in the Puebla-Tlaxcala Val­ley ( 43 percent of the sample), central Veracruz (13 percent), the Valley of Oaxaca (11 percent), the Mixtec region (6 percent), other areas in Oaxaca (5 percent), and the Basin of Mexico (3 percent; see Figure 1).1 Nineteen percent of the sample did not have provenance. Information existed about the place or region of origin of many of the artifacts, but only in a few examples was there detailed data about their depositional context. Codex-style pot­tery is characterized by a very lustrous surface fin­ishing. In the regions where it appeared, it was more elaborate than other contemporary local pot­tery; that is, it was of higher quality and the only type with decoration in the style of the codices. 
The first step for the iconographical analysis was to identify individual elements painted on the vessels and their associated meanings. Then I looked at clusters of signs and their relationship to certain vessel forms and provenance. Readings for these clusters of signs were offered. Finally, I explored the manner, or grammar, in which mes­sages were constructed. 
The Pictography Painted on 
Codex-Style Vessels 

The analysis of codex-style vessels showed that their painted motifs were more than mere decora­tion; they were signs representing objects and actions that conform to a system of images known as pictography. This pictographic system has sev­eral characteristics that make it suitable to transmit complex information. It is iconic, since the major­ity of the signs resemble the objects represented (Boone 2000:32). It is also ideographic, since depicted objects stand for ideas or traits associated with them. Signs can be metaphors; for example, the depiction of an eagle may refer to a warrior. Signs can also be metonyms (when a part is painted to represent the whole); for example, the drawing of smoke volutes may refer to the use of incense and its associated concepts, such as the search for contact with the gods or ritual purification. In this particular pictographic system it seems that the majority of the images were not phonetic symbols to fix spoken texts, as was the case in Maya writ­ing. It is recognized, however, that at least a few of 
them had phonetic associations (e.g., Jansen and Perez Jimenez 2005:15; Smith 1983:241). Inde­pendently of the degree of phonetism, the high con­ventionalization of pictographic images suggests a conventionalized reading, as Maarten Jansen (1992:20) has shown. This would have been espe­cially useful in a multilingual region, like that in which the Mixteca-Puebla style was contextual­ized. 
In these vessels signs are standardized-that is, they have a standard arrangement on the vessel's surface. They form complexes of signs. In the sam-, ple studied at least 12 complexes were found. These were often related to specific vessel shapes and to specific regions of provenance. For example, the cluster of signs most common in the sample, the "solar band complex," appears close to the vessel rim; it mostly appeared on plates, tripod bowls, and craters; and it was associated with the Puebla­Tlaxcala region (Figures 2 and 3). In contrast, the "complex of white flowers" appeared only on tri­pod bowls and jars, goblets, and censers and has been related to Oaxaca (Figures 4 and 5). Another illustration of this is the complex I referred to as "the death and Tlillan," which mainly occurred on vases but also on craters and censers and was more frequent in Veracruz and so far absent in Oaxaca (Figures 6 and 7). Other complexes of signs in the sample studied were also associated with certain vessel shapes and/or certain provenances. One should note, however, that vessels with the same complex of signs were not necessarily the product of a single workshop. A neutron activation analy­sis conducted by Hector Neff and colleagues (1994:120-121, 124) on a sample of codex-style pottery from several regions shows that objects with similar complexes of signs were manufac­tured in different localities. 
The signs were generally painted in bands around the vessel surface. Most of them were part of the common iconographic corpus that was used to pre­serve ritual and historic information in Postclassic central and southern Mexico. However, it was not only the signs that were meaningful; the background on which they were painted also conveyed infor­mation. Two main background colors were used: orange or black. In general, signs with meanings related to the sun, light, and festivity appear on an orange background, while signs associated with death and topics suggestive of darkness and mys-

tery are on a black background. For example, signs representing the sun, eagles and warriors, or flow­ers and songs were painted on an orange background (Hernandez 2008). On the contrary, signs repre­senting death and death gods, Tezcatlipoca, smoke and darkness, or animated flints appear on a black background (Hernandez 2008). It seems that arti­sans, and maybe also users, categorized many of the vessels' messages following the fundamental Mesoamerican notion of duality: light/darkness. 

Also some background decoration transmitted religious concepts, such as those suggested by the pattern of red vertical lines on white (Figure 8). In codices this pattern occurs in different contexts: as body painting of Chichimec warriors (e.g., Histo­ria Tolteca-Chichimeca l 989:20r), of Mixcoatl and Tlahuizcalpantecuhtli (e.g., Anders et al., eds. 1993:25;Anders andJansen,eds. 1993: 19), on per­sons to be sacrificed (e.g., Anders et al., eds. 1993:18-19; Anders et al., eds. l 992a:21), and on

temple platforms (e.g., Anders et al., eds. 1993:3, 50; Anders and Jansen, eds. 1993:15). It possibly indicated paper on which blood had been dripped, a well-documented offering in central Mexico (Motolinfa 1988:87; Sahagun 1997:74). There are representations of white paper with red lines in codices, which seem to be such offering papers (e.g., Caso 1964; Anders et al., eds. 1992b:31; Anders et al., eds. 1992a:44), and some vessels are even decorated with them (e.g., Anders et al., eds. 
1993:63, 65; Figure 8f). Since this pattern occurred in different contexts, it seems that it represented a widely understood religious concept. Very possi­bly it referred to notions associated with the offer­ing of blood, and accordingly, it complemented the messages painted on the vessels. 
Furthermore, signs on the vessels often appear in pairs. A few of them are well-known Mesoamer­ican difrasismos, or diphrastic kennings, that is, couplings of words, usually concrete, that in com­bination produce new meanings that are usually abstract (Garibay 1987:67). For example, in the Nahua region "the face, the heart" was a diphrastic kenning for "person" (Leon Portilla and Silva 199 1:40). Difrasismos, together with repetitions and parallelisms of ideas, were rhetorical devices used for ceremonial and formal occasions in Mesoamerica. This is shown by ancient indigenous sacred histories and prayers documented after the conquest in alphabetic writing. For example, the Maya sacred book Popol Vuh (Tedlock 1996) and the prayers registered in 1629 by Hernando Rufz de Alarcon ( 1987) in Guerrero were constructed using such poetic devices. These techniques appeared not only in speech but also in writing. Maarten Jansen and Aurora Perez (2000:68) have also found their use in the Mixtec codices. Timo­thy Knowlton (2002) argues that diphrastic ken­nings were already present in Classic Maya texts. Known pairs on the vessels are "the shield, the arrows," which stands for "warrior"; "the flower, the song," which stands for "poetry" (Leon Portilla 1970:75); and "the eagle, the fire serpent," which stands for "nahual priest."2 Although I am not yet able to associate many pairs of signs on the vessels to known difrasismos, I do recognize that the mes-

sages painted on them were constructed using the pairing of concepts, repetitions, and parallelisms characteristic of the ceremonial language. 
Messages were depicted on the vessels in a stan­dardized, simplified, and repetitive manner. This suggests that the original users of the artifacts must have understood them, at least on a certain level. However, it may also be that some complexes of signs, which look simple, were in fact obscure and metaphorical ritual concepts, the meanings of which were difficult to access since they were rep­resented using the conventions of the ceremonial language, like diphrastic kennings. As Friar Diego Duran, a Nahuatl speaker since youth and a person deeply interested in precolumbian religious prac­tices recognized: "Los cantares de estos son com­puestos por unas metaforas tan oscuras que apenas hay quien las entienda, si muy de prop6sito no se estudian y platican para entender el sentido de ellas" (1980:233 ). 3 If this also applied to codex-style ves­sels, it may have been the case that beholders who were not familiar with such conventions were not able to understand some of the vessels' messages. Today this is the main challenge in the interpreta­tion of this pictography. 
Reading the Pictography 
In the sample studied I did not find dates, calen­drical data, geographical places, or personal names, which are central components of historical accounts and ritual prognostication. 4 John Pohl (2005a, 2005b, 2007 a, 2007b ), however, has detected a few dates. Consequently, it seems that a vessel's painted information referred only sporadically to these top­ics. In addition, I have not made any clear recog­nition of scenes that describe well-known historical events or important episodes in Mesoamerican sacred history. 
Rather, the signs depicted on the vessels formed thematic complexes. The themes seem to be cen­tral concepts in the context of Mesoamerican rit­ual practice. Some themes were related to ritual activities in general, like the often represented "solar band complex." Other themes seem to be associated with certain kinds of ceremonies like the propitiation of agricultural fertility or the cult of the dead and the ancestors, as will be presented below, but other common Mesoamerican ceremonies were also alluded to. For example, the "complex of war­riors" referred to actions concerning warfare; the "complex of pulque," to activities where this bev­erage had a central role; and the "complex of pow­erful beings," to the invocation of powerful nahuales and other supernatural beings (for a detailed description of all the complexes found in the sample, see Hernandez 2005). Moreover, some themes refer to common notions in ceremonial con­texts such as nobility, luxury, beauty, darkness, or smoke (Figure 9). 
"Solar Band Complex" 
The "solar band complex" is distinguished by an orange band close to the vessel rim with red verti­cal lines and hooks representing the sun (see Fig­ure 2; Hernandez 2005:95-109). The sun in Mesoamerica not only was the principle of life but also symbolized the sacred and the affairs of the gods. In the Codex Mendoza, several place-names, which included the Nahuatl particle teotl, "god," or teoyotl, "sacred thing," were pictographically represented by a sun (Berdan and Anawalt 1992:208).5 On the vessel's solar band, agave thorns and bone awls were usually painted. The signs also occur as a pair in religious codices (e.g., Anders, Jansen, and Perez-Jimeenez, eds. 1994: 11, 14, 32;Anders et al., eds. 1991 :5;Anders et al., eds. 1993:18-19, 22-23; Anders et al., eds. 1992a:21). Thoms and awls were typical self-sacrificial instru­ments in prehispanic Mesoamerica; consequently they were most probably an ideographic reference to piety, penitence, and ritual purification (Jansen 1998a: 144; Nowotny 1961 :27). In the vessels, these signs sometimes appear in combination with ears of com, precious stones, flowers, solar rays, and pheasant heads, all of them common signs of pre­ciousness or abundance in central Mexico during the late Postclassic period (Anders and Jansen 1993: 120; Nicholson and Quinones 1983: 37; Seier 1963:72, 103). Beneath this band, there is a band with feathers and/or a band of step-fret motifs. 
Feathers were widespread symbols of pre­ciousness and nobility; step-frets appeared in con­texts related to nobility and important lineages (Jansen and Perez Jimenez 2000: 14; Sharp 1981 :7). Thus, the "solar band complex" can be interpreted as a reference to piety and penitence, qualified as precious, noble, and sacred. Therefore it is possi­ble that vessels with this pictography were created for ceremonies in which ritual purification was an

essential component. Furthermore, on the bottom of open-mouthed vessels central signs, often eagles, feathered serpents, corn offerings (Nicholson 1994), butterflies, or jaguars and less frequently images of gods as Xipe or Xochipilli, were depicted. A possibility is that these illustrations were a specific reference to the piety and penitence that were depicted by the rest of the vessel. This complex mostly appeared on plates and tripod bowls, which, according to their form, could be used for serving food in individual portions (in feasts but also for offerings). There were also some craters (for containing drinks or other liquid offer­ings?) and a few hemispherical bowls, goblets, and tripod bowls (the last two were designed for drink­ing). These vessel shapes suggest that the idea of ritual purification was important in activities where food and drink were involved, in terms of feasting and offering. 
"Complex of Propitiation of Agricultural Fertility" 
Vessels with the "complex of propitiation of agri­cultural fertility" are distinguished by an orange band, close to the rim, with eagle feathers (Figure 10). Beneath this appears an orange band with a pattern of rhombuses and hooks used to represent serpent's skin and the earth's surface (e.g., Anders et al., eds. 1993:22, 27; Anders, Jansen, van der Loo, eds. 1994: 11; Hernandez 2005: 155-157). This band seems to indicate dried earth, since in the section of the five manifestations of the rain god in the Codex Borgia (Anders et al., eds. 1993:27) dried earth is painted in the color yellow/orange. In this scene in the codex, the directions where sun­rays are strong and Tlaloc sends axes (a reference to punishment according to Anders and Jansen [1993:150]) show a yellow soil or earth, and harm­ful animals destroy the harvest. In opposition, the directions where. Tlaloc sends rain and the sky is cloudy show a fertile-looking brown soil with maize. On this band of dried earth on the vessels were painted several signs, such as an aztaxelli, the Nahuatl name of the warrior's adornment of heron's feathers; a white banner and shield, typical of the iconography of sacrifice; or an axe. All of these signs are depicted in the codices in battle or sacri­ficial contexts (e.g., Anders et al., eds. 1993: 18-19). 
Beneath this band a wider white band was painted with a pattern of red vertical lines that very possibly referred to the offering of blood, as sug-

gested above. On this band night symbols (the so­called stellar eyes) were usually painted; a few examples of these include the typical protuberances of hearts and smoke volutes. Thus this complex of signs can be interpreted as the offering of sacrifice in relation to dried and damaged earth; it is there­fore possible that vessels with this pictography were created for ceremonies related to the propitiation 

of agricultural fertility. This complex appears on '.vases and censers, which suggests that in such cer­emonies codex-style vessels were used for drink­ing and the use of incense. 
"Complex of Death and Tezcatlipoca" 
Vessels with the "complex of death and Tez­catlipoca" are characterized by a white band close to the vessel's rim with black vertical lines and stripes (Figure 11; Hernandez 2005: 159-166). This sign is related in some contexts to Tezcatlipoca, as in the CodexMagliabechi (Boone 1983:33), where a personage is seated on an altar with the same pat­tern of lines and stripes. The associated text explains that such an image referred to the feast of Toxcatl dedicated to Tezcatlipoca. In the Codex Borgia (Anders et al., eds. 1993: 15, 17, 21, 69), unlike any other god, Tezcatlipoca is mostly represented in a loincloth with this sign on the tips. This band prob­ably indicated one of his attributes, blackness or darkness. In the Codex Mendoza (Berdan and Anawalt 1992:42v, 43r) a blanket is depicted with this pattern, which is labeled as tlilpapatlavac in the Matricula de Tributos, a black wide cloak in Nahuatl (Berdan and Anawalt 1997:104). On this band on the vessels agave thorns, eyeballs out of their sockets, animated flints, or lungs (Berger 2004: 109) were painted. 
Beneath this band appears an orange band with red dots similar to the representation of sectioned skin in the codices (e.g., Anders et al., eds. 1993:31-32, 50); as such, it was part of the iconog-

raphy of the death gods and the undeiworld. The next band has stellar eyes on a black or gray striped back­ground, which in codices often symbolizes dark­ness, night, mystery, the atmosphere of ritual trance, and the place inhabited by the gods and the dead (Anders and Jansen 1993:229; Jansen 1998b:294). On the widest band of the vessels, on a black back­ground, appear skulls, hearts, eyeballs out of their sockets, hands, or lungs, all of them signs associated with the iconography of death, the death gods, and the undeiworld (e.g., Boone 1983:76r; Anders et al., eds. 1993:7, 50, 52, 73;Anders, Jansen, and van der Loo, eds. 1994:13; Anders et al., eds. 1992a:84). Accordingly, this group of signs is also associated with the Tzitzimime, death spirits of the undeiworld, as several specialists have recognized (Boone 1999; Klein 2000; Pohl 1998:191, 2007a:13-14; Taube 1993:4-7).6 
Thus, this band referred to affairs of the other world, such as the dead, the death gods, and the undeiworld, but it is possible that it was also a ref­erence to Tezcatlipoca. Sahagun mentions that in the feast of Toxcatl dedicated to Tezcatlipoca the image of Huitzilopochtli wore a cloak "en la cual estaban labrados los huesos y miembros de una persona despedazada; a esta manta labrada de esta manera, llamaban tlacuacuallo" (1992:II: 109).7 Similar cloaks decorated the images ofTezcatlipoca according to Duran (1980: 106) and were also used by newly elected lords in their initial penitence (Sahagun 1992:VII:473). These signs of death were also related to Tezcatlipoca in other contexts. For example, in the Mixteca-Puebla-style mural paint­ings ofTizatlan (Caso 1927) and Ocotelulco (Con­treras 1994) they appear in bands associated with images of this god. 
Thus the vessels' pictography seems to refer to death, death gods, and the undeiworld and in con­sequence to the dead and the ancestors, in relation to Tezcatlipoca, in a context of darkness and mys­tery. It is possible, therefore, that vessels with this complex of signs were created for ceremonies regarding the cult of the dead. Tezcatlipoca, the omnipotent lord (Nicholson 1971; Olivier 2003:16), with his changing character (Sahagun 1992:1:32), was evidently involved. This complex mostly appeared on vases and goblets but also on a few censers and a tripod bowl. This suggests that in ceremonies around the cult of the dead these ves­sels were often used for drinking.

"Complex of Crossed Bones and Skulls" 
A few complexes of signs on the codex-style ves­sels were common visual formulas that were also represented in other ritual media in central Mex­ico. A good example is the "complex of crossed bones and skulls" (Figure 12), which also appears on painted altars in Tlatelolco (Villagra 1971 :Fig­ure 33), Tenayuca (Villagra 1971:Figure 29), and Tenochtitlan (Batres 1979). Mictlantecuhtli­Cihuacoatl (Anders et al. 1994:286), in the Codex Fejervary-Mayer (Anders, Jansen, and Perez Jimenez, 1994:37), and Lady 9-Grass, priestess of the death cult (Anders et al. 1992: 184 ), in the Codex Nuttall (Anders et al., eds. 1992a:44 ), wear 
'black cloaks with similar bones and skulls. Also in the Codex Tudela (Tudela de la Orden l 980:50r) a woman with the gloss vieja hechichera (old witch) wears a similar cloak. Another appears in an illustration by Diego Mufioz Camargo (Rela­ciones Geograficas del Sig lo XVI 1984:Figure 13) on the burning of objects belonging to "idola­trous" priests. This shows that some messages on the vessels referred to common notions of the rit­ual practice of central Mexico. 
The Use of Codex-Style Vessels 
Codex-style pottery was scarce. Lind (1994:86) reports that in the Puebla-Tlaxcala Valley and the Mixtec area it represents between 2 and 5 percent of the ceramic artifacts recovered in domestic con­texts. Their scarcity and high cost suggest that they were used more frequently in ritual and high-status contexts, which is supported by archaeological evi­dence. They have been recovered in excavations of public and ceremonial areas such as the Great Pyra­mid at Cholula (Marquina 1970), the Great Plat­form in Tizatlan, and various rooms close to the polychrome altar of Ocotelulco (Contreras 1994; Table 1 ). Also they have been found in fills and trash pits in high-status neighborhoods in precolonial times, like the barrio of Tianguiznahuac, a sector inhabited by nobles and merchants in Postclassic Cholula (Rojas 1985: 129), and in small palaces such as in Yucuita and Chachoapa in the Mixtec highlands (Caso et al. 1967:465; Lind 1987). It is notable that the vessels from Chachoapa were recovered from a trash pit containing around 10,000 pottery fragments that included other kinds of painted ceramics (Caso et al. 1967 :465).

sels come from an offering cache in the Templo Mayor in Mexico City (Lopez Lujan 1993, 2005). Moreover, some vessels were offerings in the fine tombs at Monte Alban and Zaachila (Caso et al. 1967:447; Gallegos 1978) and in a multiple burial on the periphery of Cholula (Suarez 1989). A few vessels also came from tombs in Huitzo, Ayotzin­tepec, Coixtlahuaca, and Yagul, although I have not found more information about their specific location. On the other hand, in domestic areas on the periphery of Cholula, fragments of codex-style vessels have been found in trash pits and building fills (Hernandez 2005:42; Suarez et al. 1992). This evidence suggests that not only a restricted sector of the population had access to them. However, the nature of these Cholultecan domestic deposits still requires more analysis (see Plunket and Uruiiuela 2005). In general, codex-style pottery was more common in ritual and high-status contexts (it prob­ably had different uses within this context). 
Ten percent of the vessels studied come from burials in Oaxaca. Note, however, that complete vessels are more frequently conserved in this kind of archaeological deposit. Notably there does not seem to be a relationship between their pictogra­phy and their funerary use. On these vessels vari­ous thematic complexes were depicted, including the "solar band complex." The "complex of death and Tezcatlipoca," which is the cluster of signs that most clearly refer to the dead, however, did not appear. This suggests that these vessels were cre­ated not to be mortuary offerings but, rather, to be part of different ceremonies and that later they were deposited in burials. On the other hand, vessels with known specific contexts do not demonstrate a clear correspondence between high-status areas and certain thematic complexes. Although a rea­son for this may be that few vessels have detailed information about their provenance; this can also suggest that pictographic compositions were not exclusive to certain sectors of the population. This implies, for example, that vessels with symbols of nobility and luxury were created not for the nobil­ity but for ceremonies in which such concepts were important.

The vessel shapes also suggest different uses. A number of them are censers, well-known ritual paraphernalia in ancient Mesoamerica. However, the majority of the artifacts were designed as serv­ing vessels (Figure 13). Some are appropriate for drinking, like goblets, jars, vases, and hemispher­ical bowls. Other vessels would have been appro­priate for individual consumption, such as plates, tripod bowls, and hemispherical bowls, and some would have been used for the collective serving of food and drink, such as pitchers, craters, bottles, and big bowls. From their shape and high quality, codex-style vessels were probably serving wares for feasting-namely, ritualized events in which food and drink functioned as the main means of expression (Bray 2003; Dietler 1996; Dietler and Hayden 2001 :3 ). In Mesoamerica feasting was, and still is, an essential element of community life. Early colonial documents describe festivities of the ritual calendar, the government, and other public celebrations in which big communal meals with special food, speeches, songs, and other prescribed activities played a part. 
Codex-style vessels were, however, not only serving wares. It is also very possible that some were containers for offerings of food, beverages, or other substances, given the fact that in codices,

prehispanic burials, and present-day traditional communities serving wares are used as receptacles for offerings during diverse ritual activities. In the Codex Borgia (e.g., Anders et al., eds. 1993:8, 24, 45) and the Mixtec codices (e.g., Anders et al., eds. 1992a: 12 ), vessels with shapes similar to the codex­sty le ceramics appear as containers for food, burn­ing resins, pulque, cacao, or blood in diverse ceremonies. Thus, with regard to their shape and quality, codex-style vessels were used for ceremo­nial purposes, be they feasting or other ritual activ­ities, where offerings were involved. The pictog­raphy on the vessels also suggests this. It is notable that some clusters of signs do not seem to be restricted to a specific vessel form, while others are more consistent with the shape. This implies that some thematic complexes had wider meanings and consequently were appropriate for several uses, while other complexes had more specific meanings and uses.

Conclusions 

Codex -sty le vessels were more than just fine arti­facts. They were objects for ceremony. The motifs painted on them conformed to a pictography that referred to essential notions of Mesoamerican rit­ual practice. Most likely the meanings of the painted signs were related to the context in which the vessels were used. For example, vessels designed for feasting, in general, were painted with symbols of nobility and luxury, while vessels cre­ated for specific ceremonies, like the cult of the dead or agricultural propitiation, included well-known motifs related to those ceremonies. A central part of feasting is the use of symbols to distinguish feasts from daily meals (Dietler and Hayden 2001 :9). For example, consuming special food, using particular decoration, or presenting certain dances distinguishes a ceremonial meal from a common one. Codex-style vessels were most prob­ably used as such a symbol. Not only did they have a practical use during the feast, but their decora­tion also communicated important concepts in the context of those events. 
The high quality and scarcity of these vessels, and their higher frequency in palaces and upper­class residential areas, show that the original users were frequently noble people. However, they have also been found in temples and public areas, and even in peripheral domestic areas, which suggests that there were also other users and beholders. This wide distribution, with emphasis in public and high­status contexts, supports the idea that these vessels were seen as elegant ceremonial ware for special occasions. Furthermore, it seems that some of these vessels were one-of-a-kind pieces and therefore may have been gifts for certain events. As such, they could have been involved in nobility networks and political alliances, as Pohl (2003) suggests. 
In comparison to codices and mural paintings of the same sty le, the messages depicted on the ves­sels look simple and repetitive. This was not only due to the limited painting space on the vessel sur­face but also due to the kind of messages repre­sented and the context of use. Codex-style vessels were created as containers for ceremonial occa­sions. To reinforce their special character, they were painted with essential ritual concepts using the poetic style characteristic of the ceremonial Ian­guage of Mesoamerica. This language was highly metaphorical, involving repetitions and paired con­cepts. The Mixteca-Puebla-style pictography was able to convey, in that manner, short messages that were recognized, at least on a certain level, by the participants of those events. 
Some clusters of signs possibly served as mnemonic devices for prayers. For example, the "complex of death and Tezcatlipoca" includes a band of stellar eyes on a black or gray striped back­ground. This may have indicated night and possi­bly also wind (Jansen 1997:26). In the Nahua i speeches registered by Sahagun in his Book 6, both concepts are often used as part of invocations of Tezcatlipoca and other gods: "O master, 0 our lord, O night, 0 wind" (1969: VI:2). Nevertheless, whether such vessels were, in fact, used as a guide for public recitation remains speculative. It is also possible that the reduced cluster of signs was sim­ply a listing of ideas that were important in certain ceremonial contexts. 
The evidence indicates that in Cholula more codex-style vessels were used and distributed than in other places-24 percent of the study sample came from there. This corresponds well with the religious character of the city and its regional importance as a center of pilgrimage. However, the fact that vessels with similar style and iconogra­phy were also produced and used in other places in central and southern Mexico shows that during the late Postclassic period, and throughout a wide area of Mesoamerica, people shared both feasting wares and paraphernalia related to offerings. This suggests common ritual practices, at least on acer­tain level. Moreover, this corresponds well with the greater religious integration observed in Post­classic times. In contrast, the presence of codex­style pottery similar in style but different in terms of iconography in places outside of the Mixteca­
Puebla core area suggests another kind of interre­gional interaction. It is now recognized that the Postclassic was a period of greater political con­tact and commercialization throughout Mesoamer­ica (Boone and Smith 2003b:8). In this Postclassic world system, as Boone and Smith call it, various regional traditions of codex-style pottery existed. They shared stylistic canons, but their images and texts were adapted to the particularities of regional, or even local, ritual life.

Notes 

I. I include a few examples from sites in north and south Oaxaca (Ayotzintepec, Cuicatlan, Sola de la Vega, and Teojomulco). 
2. 
In Mixtec yaha yahui, translated by Alvarado in his vocabulary as "eagle fire serpent" and nigromantico senor (lord sorcerer), was a title equivalent to nahual priest (Anders et al. 1992:184-186; Jansen and Perez Jimenez 2003). 

3. 
Their songs are composed of such obscure metaphors that hardly is there anyone who understands them, if they are not very purposefully studied and well conversed enough in order to understand their sense" (Duran 1980:233; my trans­lation). 

4. 
Although some of the signs painted on the vessels were also day names of the Nahua ritual calendar, they were not

depicted to represent calendrical information. This is because not all day names appear on the vessels, numerals are not rep­resented, and those signs on the vessels that are also day names appear in contexts that do not suggest a calendrical use. To date, I have knowledge of only one vessel with an unambiguous depiction of a date. It is a pitcher deposited in the Gilcrease Museum in Oklahoma and published by John Pohl (2007b:Figures 18-19). In this vessel two personages are giving offerings to a place. At least one of them has an associated date: 6 Serpent. 
5. For example, Teoa9inco, the "small sacred water," is depicted with half a solar disc, a water basin, and the lower limbs of a man (Codex Mendoza 1992: l 6r). 
6. 
These signs appear as well on various sculptures repre­senting Coatlicue, a goddess identified as a Tzitzimitl by Elizabeth Boone (1999: 190-191 ). 

7. 
"On which were embroidered the bones and limbs of a sectioned person; this cloak, embroidered in this manner, they called tlacuacuallo" (Sahagun 1992:II: 109; my translation). Garibay (1992:953) translates this Nahuatl word as manjares, i.e., "fine food."
