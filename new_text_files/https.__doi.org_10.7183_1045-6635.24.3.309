CUEVA LA CONGA: 
FIRST KARST CAVE ARCHAEOLOGY IN NI CARAGU A 

Suzanne M. Baker and Ruth Ann Armitage 
Cueva la Conga, recorded in June 2006, is the first limestone cave in Nicaragua reported to contain prehistoric rock paint­ings, culturally modified natural formations called speleothems, and artifacts. Located in northcentral Nicaragua in the Department of Jinotega, Cueva la Conga is the farthest south on the Mesoamerican periphery that a cave of this type has heen reported, and it extends our knowledge of ritual cave use, including cave painting and speleothem modification, to include Nicaragua. Radiocarbon analysis of charcoal in five samples of the paint, the first such dating of Nicaraguan rock art, yielded calibrated dates from cal AD. 680-905 to cal A.D.1403-1640. The baseline data provided by Cueva la Conga are of great importance for regional rock art analysis and for our growing understanding of regional and Nicaraguan pre­history. More archaeological survey and excavations in the area will be key in establishing a firm cultural context for the rock art and ritual cave use found at Cueva la Conga. 
Cueva La Conga, registrada en Junia de 2006, es la primera cueva de piedra caliza encontrada en Nicaragua con pintura rupestre de tiempos prehistoricos,formaciones naturales culturalmente modificadas, llamadas espeleotemas, y artefactos. La Conga, ubicada en el departamento de Jinotega, en la parte centro-norte de Nicaragua, es la cueva de este tipo que se ha encontrado mas al sur, ya en la periferia mesoamericana, y el sitio amplia nuestros conocimientos sobre una tradici6n de ri­tuales en cuevas al incorporar Nicaragua, incluyendo las pinturas rupestres y espeoletemas. El andlisis de radiocarbono en el carbon hallado en cinco muestras de la pintura, la primera dataci6n de arte rupestre en Nicaragua realizada con este m1'todo, arro)<5 fechas que abarcan desde 680-905 cal d.C. hasta 1403-1640 cal d.C. Los datos de Unea base obtenidos de la cueva La Conga son de mucha importancia para el andlisis de! arte rupestre y para nuestra creciente comprensi6n de la pre­historia en la region yen Nicaragua. Es fundamental que continzien las investigaciones y excavaciones arqueol6gicas en el drea de La Conf?a para estahlecer un solido contexto cultural de[ arte rupestre y el uso ritual de cuevas.

ueva La Conga is Nicaragua's first reported 
Climestone cave in karst formation that has not only numerous pictographs in ochre and charcoal paints, but also four culturally mod­ified natural limestone formations, called speleothems, two of which are carved and two, painted.1 Radiocarbon analyses on five charcoal samples have produced the first dates for pic­tographs and, indeed, the first radiocarbon dates for northern Nicaragua, which range from cal AD. 680-905 to cal A .D. I440-I520.The greatest inten­sity of painting seems to have occurred in the ear­lier period. Other physical data and images provide some social information about the ancient people who utilized the cave in a region about which vir­tually nothing else is known archaeologically. 
Whereas prehistoric ritual cave use, involving paintings and modified speleothems, has been widely reported in karst regions in Mesoamerica, Cueva la Conga extends southward the known distribution of sites representing ritual use of underground caverns. It is the farthest south that such a cave has been found on the Mesoamerican periphery. This discovery and accompanying radiocarbon dates are thus of consid­erable importance to Nicaraguan and to regional pre­history and rock art studies. 
Archaeological and Ethnographic Background 
Cueva la Conga lies in the north-central part of Nicaragua, about 50 km south of the Honduran border in the Department of Jinotega (Figure 1).

Figure 1. Regional map with location of Cueva la Conga. 
This is a rugged, mountainous region forming a part of the northwest to southeast trending highlands running through the center of the country. The region is cut by many rivers and was once heavily forested. There has been no previous archaeologi­cal work in the immediate region of the cave, and, in general, the north-central and eastern portions of Nicaragua have seen very little substantive archaeological or ethnographic research. Until recently, virtually the only study in northern Nicaragua had been that of Fletcher et al. (1993), conducted between 1990 and 1992 along the Hon­duran frontier in the departments of Estell and Madriz (to the west of Jinotega) . Their survey recorded 90 sites and found a complex settlement pattern exhibiting a "hierarchy of sites," including possible regional centers, local centers, smaller vil­lages and hamlets, as well as petroglyph sites (Fletcher et al. 1993: 103). They also constructed a ceramic typology that suggested that there was "a greater influence or interaction with groups to the north than with those to the south or with Pacific Nicaragua" (Fletcher et al. 1993: 103). 
The National Autonomous University of Nicaragua (UNAN) undertook the most recent archaeological work in northern Nicaragua from 2006 to 2009 (Balladares and Rivera 2011). An archaeological survey in the Departments of Mata­galpa and western Jinotega recorded 126 sites of various types from mounds to petroglyphs. Site descriptions indicate a similar range of complex­ity and site types as those found by Fletcher et al. (1993). The Jinotega portion of the survey, located 50-100 km to the southwest and west of the Cueva la Conga area, found 19 sites, encompassing mounds, a rock shelter, and ceramic and lithic scat­ters. The predominant diagnostic ceramic was the Sulaco or Segovia Naranja Type (A.D. 300-1430) (Balladares and Rivera 2011: 17--67). No rock a1t was reported. 
Linguists include the Jinotega region within the northern area of speakers of a small family of lan­guages called "Misumalpan" for the Miskitu, Sumu, and Matagalpan languages and various dialects, which, along with Rama, a Chibchan lan­guage or dialect in southeastern Nicaragua, are the main languages of eastern and central Nicaragua. Misumalpan speakers extended somewhat north of the present Nicaraguan-Honduran border into eastern Honduras (Constenla 199l: 16, 22-23). Speakers of the Misumalpan languages are located between the Rama and the Paya of Honduras, who speak another Chibchan language. Misumalpan languages generally have been considered con-

nected to Macro-Chibchan and thus affiliated with Chibchan languages and populations found mostly in more southerly parts of Central America (Camp­bell 1979:944; Constenla 1991:16,32, 1994; Healy 1974; Holt 1975). Early chroniclers also mention a people in the northwest mountains of Nicaragua in today's Departments of Estelf, Madriz, and Nueva Segovia (west of the Department of Jinotega) called the Chondal or Chontal. Although some researchers believe that the Chondal were affiliated with the Matagalpa or Lenca (now mainly in Honduras), there is evidence that some of these people may have been Putun Maya (Fowler 1989:57; Werner 2000:12-13, 17-18). 
In general, there is considerable ambiguity about Nicaragua's overall cultural affiliations. The country lies in a region between Mesoamerican peopl es to the north and Chibchan-speaking groups to the south. One source has placed the approximate eastern boundary of Mesoamerica at a north-south line running roughly through cen­tral Honduras, with Pacific Nicaragua to northwest Costa Rica sometimes included in this division (the Greater Nicoya Archaeological Subarea). Eastern Honduras and most of central and eastern Nicaragua, the rest of Costa Rica, and Panama are included within Lower Central America (Stone and Ktinne 2003: 196, Figure I). 
The general lack of archaeological data for northern Nicaragua, as opposed to southwest Nicaragua, where much of the significant previous archaeological research has been conducted, leaves little room for posing or answering questions about cultural affiliation.2The Cueva la Conga region is in a now grey area near the hypothetical border of the two cultural traditions, and the archaeological and ethnohistoric affiliations of Cueva la Conga and its surroundings are simply uncertain at this point. 
Rock Art in Nicaragua 
Nicaragua has abundant and often impressive rock art, which has been at least briefly reported in many regions of the country (see Baker 2003, 201O; Matill6 1965; Stone and Ktinne 2003). Only a few formal rock art studies have, however, been conducted, most concentrated in Pacific Nicaragua or Chontales (Baker 2010; Mati116 1973; Navarro 1996; Rigat 1992). The north and north-central parts of the country have been par­ticularly devoid of formal rock art research, with only brief mention of rock art in most archaeo­logical studies (Balladares and Rivera 2011; Fletcher et al. 1993). Previous reports have emphasized petroglyphs, which are ubiquitous in Nicaragua. Paintings or pictographs have only been reported in eight locations, including Cueva la Conga, the first site in a karst cave. The other seven were found in rock shelters or on ravine walls. These include the Icalupe site, near Somoto in the Department of Madriz; Cueva de los Ladrones in the municipality of Matagalpa; loca­tions near the town of Chagtiitillo in the Sebaco Valley; at LagunaAsososca in Managua; and three other sites in the Pacific zone-Montelimar, Los Sanchez, and Cueva de los Negros (Baker 2010: 16; Balladares and Rivera 2011; Navarro 1996:24; Squier 1856: 402-405; Nestor Davila, personal communication 2009). 
Cueva La Conga Site Description 
Site History 
Cueva la Conga was first reported in 2004, when Pablo Yoder, a local Mennonite missionary, and a friend, Paul Kaufman, visited the cave. They con­tacted one of the authors, Suzanne Baker, who vis­ited the cave with Yoder and Kaufman and two other colleagues, Jerry Doty and Karla Kaufman, in June 2006, when the site was formally mapped and recorded (Baker et al. 2006). Unfortunately, two weeks before initial recording in 2006, a group of young people led by a local teacher visited and vandalized the cave during Easter week, leaving various carved and inked grafitti on the walls, although none covered the paintings. The original carving and pecking on Speleothem 1 was also marred by new abrasion or scratching. A second episode of graffiti, resulting in a carved name, pre­sumably of the grafitti maker, occurred sometime between 2006 and 2008. 
Because of the unique nature of the rock art at Cueva la Conga, Suzanne Baker and Dr. Ruth Ann Armitage of Eastern Michigan University, a chemist specializing in rock art dating, returned to the cave in January 2009 to take paint samples for radiocarbon dating and for determining the chem­ical composition of the pigments. Eleven paint samples-five charcoal and six ochre-as well as eight background substrate samples were collected

Description 
Cueva La Conga is in a remote area that has a con­voluted topography of low mountains (between 400-900 m in elevation) interspersed with small valleys and perennial and seasonal drainages. The cave itself is at an elevation of approximately 380 m at the north end of a double-peaked hill. Two small valleys, formed by the El Tigre River, part of the Rfo Bocay watershed, flank the cave loca­tion to the northwest and southeast. Until relatively recently, the region was heavily forested, but the agricultural frontier has been advancing rapidly. The immediate environs of the cave are still in for­est, but small agricultural holdings are now found at lower elevations. 
La Conga, a horizontal limestone cave, is in an area of karst formation. Karst is a limestone land­scape, characterized by caves, fissures, and, often, underground streams. Such geological formations are well known in Eastern Mesoamerica, espe­cially within the Mexican States ofYucatan, Quin­tana Roo, and Chiapas, in Belize, and in the Peten of Guatemala, as well as in eastern Honduras, and many karst caves with evidence of ritual use have been reported in those areas (Brady and Prufer

2005; Kueny and Day 2002:Figure 1; Stone and Kiinne 2003). The presence of karst in the Jinotega area was itself a surprise in that most of the geo­logical maps available show the Cueva la Conga region with volcanic formations or as unmapped. A recent study of karst landscapes in Central America does not include the Cueva la Conga area, although it does show some karst to the south in east-central Nicaragua (Kueny and Day 2002:Figure 1). 
The cave is moderately active geologically, with active drip and formation building in some areas; this may become more active during the rainy sea­son. The majority of the cave is, however, quite dry and, the floor is covered with very fine dry dirt. For­mations include dripstone (stalagmites, stalactites, and pillars), flowstone, small curtains, soda straws, and a number of eccentric shapes located on walls, ceilings, or floor of the cave. 
The cave has two entrances (Figure 2). The larger entrance leading to the cave's main cham­ber is approached via a steep uphill climb and is partially screened by vegetation and large boul­ders. This entrance opens into the main chamber, which is approximately 20 m x 16 m in size and is divided by a long, curved hanging wall. A very small side chamber, measuring 1 .5 m x 1.5 m in area, is found behind the hanging wall. An approx-

imately 35 m long tunnel, which varies in width 
along its length, leads roughly southward from the 
south side of the main chamber to a second, smaller, entrance that overlooks a steep slope. 
The cave contains 14 pictograph panels with motifs drawn in ochre or charcoal, as well as four culturally modified speleothems; the modified speleothems and a majority of the paintings are in the main chamber. Two unmodified speleothems (Speleothems 2 and 6) were also given numbers because of their close association with pictographs or other cultural remains. The tunnel contains only painted handprints and charcoal smudge marks. 
The Entrance and Main Chamber 
Just inside and to the left of the main entrance is Speleothem I, an animal-like formation, covered with an eye-catching blue-green algae (Figure 3). Its "head" was modified with pecked eyes and par­allel curving grooves on top, and natural dripping 
has created claw-like "feet". There is a faded ochre 
abstract pictograph on the wall above the formation. 
The hanging wall of the main chamber is located 
6 or 7 m from the entrance (see Figure 2). The side 
that faces the entrance is the location of the major­ity of pictographs and receives a little ambient light (the "twilight zone"). A series of three small speleothems, resembling small crouching animals or animal-like heads, also hang high on the wall in close proximity to paintings. Although difficult to inspect closely because of their height above the ground, photographs show that at least two of these are modified with paint (Figure 4). 
Most of the paintings on this wall are quite high; either the painters would have required scaffold­ing or the floor was much higher at one time, which seems less likely. The wall is extensively and densely painted with motifs in predominantly orange ochre, as well as some in red and reddish purple ochre and charcoal. Both positive and neg­ative (or stenciled) ochre handprints are located here, while only positive handprints are in other locations. For recording convenience, the side of the hanging wall facing the entrance was divided

It is unfortunate that no organic binders for radiocarbon analysis were found in the ochre paints in this area during chemical analysis (Li et al. 2012), but we believe that these motifs are prob­ably the oldest since much of the ochre on this wall tends to be well-bonded to the surface, evidence of considerable time depth.
