DURING THE MIDDLE FORMATIVE MACHALILLA PHASE 

Philippe Bearez, Patrick Gay, and Richard Lunniss 
Formative Ecuadorian coastal societies possessed the technologies and skills necessary not only for fishing, but also for deep-sea navigation. Although marine shellfish are acknowledged as significant both for dietary and religious purposes, the importance of sea-fishing is rarely highlighted or explored. In order to help evaluate more fully the significance of the sea in the Ecuadorian Formative, this paper presents recently studied evidence, excavated at the Salango site, in the Province of Manabf,for local off-shore tuna fishing during the Middle Formative Machalilla phase (ca. 1500-900 B.C.), where Scom­brids constituted 80 percent of recovered fish remains. The results are then compared with those obtained from other Macha/ilia sites. Finally, data from the subsequent Late Formative Engoroy phase (ca. 900-100 B.C.) indicate that while Scombridfish­ing continued to predominate at Salango, species capture changed through time, with a shift from yellowfin tuna in the Macha/ilia phase to black skipjacks in Engoroy times. It is suggested that the decline in tuna capture reflects not so much change in fishing strategy as change in the populations of fish species reaching the local marine environment. 
Las sociedades costeras de/ Formativo ecuatoriano poseyeron las tecnologias y las habilidades necesarias no solo para la pesca, sino tambien para la navegaci6n de altamar. Pero a pesar de que los recursos marinas se reconocen coma significa­tivos en relaci6n a los aspectos dieteticos y religiosos, raramente se destaca o se explora la importancia de la pesca. Para evaluar con mas claridad el valor y el significado del mar durante el periodo Formativo ecuatoriano, el presente trabajo aporta nuevas evidencias, excavadas en el sitio Salango, Provincia de Manabi, sabre la pesca de atun y especies afines durante lafase Macha/ilia (ca. 1500-900 a.C.). Se pone en evidencia una pesca de grandes peces pelagicos, donde los esc6mbridos constituyen el 80 por ciento de los restos de pescados recuperados. Luego, se comparan los resultados con aquellos obtenidos en otros sitios Machalilla de/ litoral ecuatoriano. Los grandes anzuelos circulares recuperados en los niveles Macha/ilia proba­blemente Jueron utilizados para la pesca de/ atun. Para terminar, los datos de la siguiente Jase a Engoroy (ca. 900-100 a.C.) indican que mientras la pesca de los Scombridae continuaba predominando en Salango, hubo un cambio en cuanto a la cap­tura de especies: mientras el atun a/eta amarilla predominaba en la Jase Macha/ilia, fueron los barriletes negros los que prevalecieron en tiempos Engoroy. Se sugiere que la baja en la captura del atun no refleja un cambio en los patrones de pesca, sino mas bien cambios en el comportamiento de los pecesfrente a la explotacilin. 
he Ecuadorian coastal Formative is cur­principal pioneering study of Valdivia and Trently understood in terms of a complex Machalilla led to the initial conclusion that these process of uneven development contingent sedentary pottery-making cultures were essentially on a wide range of environmental and historical fac­supported by a sea-fishing economy (Meggers et tors. Succeeding the Archaic Las Vegas culture al. 1965). Countering this interpretation, which not (Stothert 1985, 1988), it comprises early, middle, only based itself on a material sample derived prin­and late stages represented respectively by the Val­cipally from coastal sites, but also drew inspiration divia (4400-1450 B.C.), Machalilla (1450-800 from a hypothesis of trans-Pacific origins for the B .C.) and Chorrera cultures (1300-300 B .C.)

then posited (Damp 1979; Lathrap et al. 1975). In an influential summary account, Lathrap made ref­erence to the presence of sea-fish bones and shell­fish at both shoreline and upriver inland sites, and placed Valdivia fishing with shell fishhooks in the context of a circum-Pacific tradition (Lathrap et al. 1975: 19, 22t). Nonetheless, since then the value of the sea for Valdivia and Machililla has tended to be underexplored. 
Early investigation of the Formative cultures of coastal Ecuador may indeed have been overly biased in favor of the more easily accessible shore­line sites (Marcos 2003: 15). But while agriculture and hunting by land were clearly highly significant subsistence base components, there is ample evi­dence in favor of the importance of the sea as a source of food also (Stahl 2003; Staller 2001: 209-213). Indeed, study of pre-ceramic Las Vegas sites of the Santa Elena Peninsula shows that sea­fishing was a major subsistence activity well before Valdivia times (Stothert et al. 2003). 

In addition, it is clear that the sea was a funda­mental cosmological symbol and source of sacred materials in the Formative (Stothert 2003). Early Formative long-distance trade in Spondylus and Strombus shells and their incorporation in ritual offerings and iconography are attested most recently by finds at the Mayo-Chinchipe site of Palanda, on the Atlantic watershed to the south of the Ecuadorian Andes (Valdez et al. 2005). By the time of the Spanish conquest, balsa raft navigation and long-distance maritime trade in Spondylus were to be defining characteristics of groups in the area (Anderson et al. 2007; Currie 1995a, 1995b; Mar­cos 1977-78, 1995; Marcos and Norton 1981, 1984; Norton 1986). 
Meanwhile, the presence on La Plata Island of a Valdivia ceremonial structure with associated imported artifacts (Damp and Norton 1987; Mar­cos and Norton 1981) demonstrates not only that the skills and technology for deep-sea navigation were in place by the Early Formative, but that the sea itself had been claimed as an arena for religious practice. La Plata continued to be visited for ritual purposes by Machalilla people. By Late Formative times, mother-of-pearl fishhooks were being "sac­rificed" and buried as offerings on the island, and images of fish were being crafted out of stone and buried at related mainland ceremonial sites (Lun­niss 2008:Plate 7.12). 
But while the coast of Ecuador is probably the best-known region of the country from an archae­ological point of view (Meggers 1966; Raymond and Burger 2003), of its various precolumbian phases, the Machalilla culture has received rela­tively little attention. In particular, Machalilla sub­sistence resources have not been well studied-no published papers exist that treat the subject specif­ically, and few relevant data are to be found in the­ses, reports, or other general publications (e.g., Byrd 1976; Lippi 1983; Norton 1992; Sanchez Mosquera 1990, 1991; Stahl 2003). 
One interesting exception is a report by Van der Merve et al. (1993) on an isotopic analysis of bone collagen from Machalilla human skeletons from the coastal site of Salango, in which it was concluded that diet was dominated by marine food with possibly some maize. The present analysis of fish remains recovered from the Machalilla lev­els at Salango now brings forward further evi­dence for the dietary importance of the sea, and provides the opportunity to investigate both Machalilla marine resource exploitation and its changes over time. 
Archaeological Context: 
The Machalilla Culture and Salango 

The Formative Period Machalilla culture princi­pally occupied the central coastal strip of Ecuador, an area of dry scrub and deciduous tropical forest between the Rio Chone (0° 36' S) and the Punta Arenas Peninsula (2° 44' S), during the period ca. 1450 B.C. to 800 cal B.C., with unattached settle­ment zones occurring also in the area of north Man­abf and south Esmeraldas (Villalba et al. 2006), and in El Oro Province (Staller 2001; Zeidler 2003, 2008). Machalilla ceramics compare with those of the Cotocollao (Villalba 1988) and other highland sites, perhaps as the result of long-distance trade (Zeidler 2008:467). 
First isolated at La Libertad on the Santa Elena Peninsula (Bushnell 1951), Machalilla was then defined and named after excavations at the type site at the modem fishing port of Machalilla (Estrada 1958; Meggers et al. 1965)(Figure l). Various stud­ies indicate that Machalilla developed directly out of the Early Formative Valdivia culture that pre­ceded it, though its range is decidedly more restricted (Staller 2001; Zeidler 2008).

Machalilla has received much less attention than either Valdivia or the Late Formative Chorrera cul­ture and its variants. This is in part due to the lesser frequency of Machalilla sites visited, though the chronological priority of Valdivia on the one hand, and the extraordinary brilliance and quantity of Chorrera ceramics (Cummins 2003; Lathrap et al. 1975) on the other, are also important factors. 
Nonetheless, Machalilla is significant as an expression of sociocultural adaptation to the spe­cific historical and ecological conditions of its time and place. In particular, its littoral range points to an orientation toward the sea and a likely heavy dependence on marine resource exploitation. Detailed studies of Machalilla fish remains can provide insights into the early history of this fish­ing specialization and coastal marine resources management. 
Fieldwork since the initial definition of the Machalilla culture has been limited. But excava­tions have been carried out at an inland agricultural village at La Ponga (Lippi 1983) and at a fishing village on the shore at Salango (Norton et al. 1983); and sites ranging from small farms to villages of perhaps up to 6 hectares, have been documented through survey for the valleys of the Rfo Verde (Zeidler 1986) and the Rfo Valdivia (Schwarz and Raymond 1996). 
While Machalilla evolved out of Valdivia, there were significant changes in settlement pattern and social structure (Zeidler 2008:467). In particular, no architecture has been discovered to date that might indicate the presence of ceremonial centers such as characterized Valdivia. However, a variety of archaeological features such as human burials, as well as artifacts such as small solid and large hollow ceramic figurines (Cummins 2003:Figure 7), and small quantities of obsidian and other semi­precious stones imported from the Ecuadorian highlands (Norton et al. 1983), constitute evidence for Machalilla religious beliefs and practices. The imported materials, of course, point to the existence of long-distance exchange networks, in which Spondylus and other locally gathered marine shells were most likely important outward-moving ele­ments (Paulsen 197 4). 
Subsistence practices were based largely on agriculture (Pearsall 2003), hunting, and fishing (Stahl 2003), and appear to have been little differ­ent from those of the preceding Valdivia culture (Staller 2001; Zeidler 2008). Small sets of fish remains are reported by Byrd (197 6) for the La Car­olina site, OGSE-46,atLa Libertad (Bushnell 1951; Ferdon 1941), and for the Rfo Perdido site OGCh­20, in the Chanduy Valley (Lippi 1980). Lippi ( 1983) reported marine fish found at the inland La Ponga site. Sanchez Mosquera (1990, 1991; see also Cooke 1992) has presented data on the Machalilla fish remains for the Salango site; and Van der Merve et al. (1993) determined on the basis of an isotopic analysis of bone collagen from sev­eral Machalilla human burials at Salango that human diet was dominated by marine food. 
Salango is a modem fishing community on the south coast of the Province of Manabi (Figure 1). A small but complex precolumbian site lies at the south end of its sandy bay, in an area now largely occupied by a fish-meal factory (Figure 2). Over the period from 1979 to 1989, detailed investiga­tion there of a five meter deep sequence of cultural stratigraphy provided evidence of continuous occu­pation from Valdivia times in the late fourth mil­lennium B.C. through to contact with the Spanish. One large component identified consisted of the remains of a Machalilla fishing village (Lunniss 2001:44-53; Nortonet al.1983). TheseMachalilla contexts overlay material relating to a small Val­divia settlement or camp, and were in tum suc­ceeded by remains of a fishing village and then a ceremonial center of the Late Formative Engoroy culture, Engoroy (ca. 900-100 B .C .) being the local variant of Chorrera (Beckwith 1996; Lunniss 2001, 2008). 

The Machalilla fishing village at Salango occu­pied an area of perhaps .75 ha and lay next to the beach at the base of the headland Punta Piedra Verde (Figure 3). It is represented by an approxi­mately 75-cm thick sequence of dark grey to black sandy midden, with a base at a little over 3 m below present ground level, i.e., about 2 m as!. Occasional thin yellow clay layers are suggestive of prepared surfaces or floors, while post holes and linear fea­tures suggest house structures. Also encountered were 26 human burials, including both primary and secondary, single and multiple interments. Artifacts included abundant pottery fragments, stone and shell tools and ornaments, marine shells, and marine fish remains. Among the tools were found shellfish hooks, stone net sinkers, and a bone spearthrower hook.

coast of Santa Elena and southern Manabf Provinces for the 1964-1993 period ranges between 260 and 360 mm (Figure 1). These values might be multiplied by ten or even more during El Niiio years (Rossel et al. 1999). Most of the potable water is derived from the surrounding hills whose forests are sustained by garua (foggy light rain). 
The marine fauna mostly corresponds to that of the warm, low salinity water of the Tropical Eastern Pacific biogeographic realm (Bearez 1996). How­ever Ecuador is situated in the southernmost part of this realm, next to the Warm Temperate Southeast­ern Pacific province. Indeed, the zone from Cabo San Lorenzo (1° S) to Punta Aguja (6° S, Peru), called the Gulf of Guayaquil sub-province (Jimenez­Prado and Bearez 2004) or Guayaquil ecoregion (Spalding et al. 2007), is an area of transition between the two larger biogeographic provinces. As the area of Salango is situated within this sub-province, it undergoes marked seasonal variations and is subject to high environmental variability, especially in rela­tion with ENSO events (El Niiio and La Nina), which periodically strongly affect the wildlife and the peo­ple living in the area. It is thus of special interest for studies of fish distribution and human adaptation to changing environments. 
The marine fish biodiversity of Ecuador is high, with 784 species recorded for the continental (i.e., excluding Galapagos) waters (Jimenez-Prado and Bearez 2004). Productivity is also high due to upwelling and the influence of the nearby Hum­boldt Current ecosystem (Bakun and Weeks 2008), one of the richest of the world (Carr 2002). The main fish species landed along the Manabf and Santa Elena coast are, for the demersal (bottom dweller) or benthopelagic group: cusk eel or cor­vina de roca (Brotula clarkae, Ophidiidae); snook or robalo (Centropomus spp., Centropomidae); grouper or cherna (Mycteroperca xenarcha), rock bass or perela (Paralabrax callaensis), sand perch or camotillo (Diplectrum spp., Serranidae ); tilefish or cabezudo (Caulolatilus spp., Malacanthidae); snapper or pargo (Lutjanus spp., Lutjanidae); and weakfish or corvina ( Cynoscion spp., Sciaenidae). Coastal pelagic fishes are represented by amber­jacks or huayaipes (Seriola spp.), jacks or burro, caballa (Caranx spp.) and lookdown or caras (Selene spp., Carangidae); while small pelagic species consist mainly in thread herring or pinc­hagua (Opisthonema spp., Clupeidae). The large pelagic (open ocean) fishes include wide ranging dolphinfish or dorado (Coryphaena hippurus, Coryphaenidae); yellowfin tuna or albacora (Thun­nus albacares) and skipjack tuna or barrilete (Kat­suwonus pelamis, Scombridae); and sailfish or bander6n (lstiophorus platypterus, Istiophoridae). All these species are typical inhabitants of the trop­ical eastern Pacific.

Material and Methods 
Investigation of the Machalilla levels at Salango was achieved mainly in sector OMJPLP-141 A dur­ing the early months of 1982.1This 6 m by 6 m sec­tor was divided into 6 units, each of 2 m by 3 m, designated units A82, B82, C82, 082, E82 and H82 (Figures 4 and 5). Full analysis of the Machalilla contexts still has to be carried out. Meanwhile, for the purposes of this paper and in order to gain an overview of the stratigraphic sequence for the area as a whole, the levels exca­vated in those six units were correlated on the basis of soil descriptions, levels, and other observations recorded in the field notes.2 It is also worth noting that the dark gray to black sandy layers of the Machalilla village were clearly different, both from the relatively sterile clay sands of the underlying Valdivia occupation and from the overlying yellow clay Engoroy floors. 
The resulting interpretative scheme was a sequence of 11 main layers that broadly fell into two stages. A lower, earlier stage is represented by four layers with an overall depth of about 25 cm, and a higher, later stage is represented by seven lay­ers totaling about 50 cm deep. The results of an unpublished study (Everett ca. 1990) of the pottery suggest that there were gradual transitions first from Valdivia into Machalilla, and then from Machalilla into the succeeding Engoroy phase.3 The Salango sequence probably corresponds, then, to the entire span of Machalilla history. 
Eight samples of charcoal and human bone taken from one midden layer and seven human graves cut into those layers were assayed in 1982 at Cam­bridge (UK). The results, unfortunately, have never been published or given official laboratory numbers. However, following calibration with the Ox Cal Pro­gram v3.9 (Bronk Ramsey 1995, 2001), their com­bined ranges at 68 percent probability are 1520--1010 cal B.C., and at 95.4 percent probabil­ity, 1610--970 calB.C. (Table l).ltis interesting that these results suggest start and end dates slightly ear­lier than those proposed by Zeidler (2003). Further analysis is required before these differences can be properly assessed.
