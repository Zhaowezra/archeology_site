MOBILITY A,ND TERRITORIAL OCCUPATION OF THE ASURINI DO 
XINGU, PARA, BRAZIL: AN ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE RECENT PAST 
IN THE AMAZON 

Fabfola Andrea Silva and Francisco Silva Noelli 
In recent decades, archaeology has provided evidence of the diverse nature of colonialism as well as of the specific local histories associated with this globalizing process. Archaelogists have also investigated the strategies of interaction and resistance adopted by indigenous peoples when faced with attempts at economic, political, and social domination. This article presents data about the dynamics of mobility and territorial occupation in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries of the Asurini do Xingu, an indigenous group living on the middle Xingu River in the Amazan rainforest, in the southern portion of the Brazilian state of Para. We show that these dynamics represent a conscious and strategic choice by the Asurini to preserve their way of life in the face of colonialism and the expansion of capitalism. 
En decadas recientes se han llevado a cabo estudios arqueol6gicos para proporcionar evidencias de la diversidad y de las especificidades hist6ricas y locales del colonialismo. Estos tambien han investigado las estrategias de interacci6n y resistencia de los pueblos indigenas a lo largo de este proceso, caracterizado por relaciones de poder y tentativas de dominaci6n econ6mica, politica y social. Este articulo presenta datos sabre las dinamicas de movilidad y ocupaci6n territorial de los Asurini do Xingu en los siglos diecinueve y veinte. El objetivo es mostrar que esta dindmica representa una opci6n estrategica para asegurar el mantenimiento de suforma de vidafrente al colonialismo y la expansion capitalista en el rio medio Xingu, en el Amazonas. 
uring the first decades of the twentieth Dcentury, historical archaeologists exam­ined indigenous histories on the Ameri­can continent mainly by studying post-contact sites (e.g., forts, trading posts, missions, ranches, European settlements, etc.). They sought to un­derstand the relationships between newcomers and native populations, searching for evidence of continuity and change in indigenous cultural practices after contact with Europeans. This led to the ethnocentric notion that indigenous peoples were victims of their own incapacity to confront the consequences of colonialism. In this perspec­tive, the colonial encounter resulted in the disap­pearance of some indigenous peoples and in cul­ture loss and acculturation for those who survived (Lightfoot 1995, 2006; Mayne 2008; Rubertone 
2000; Silliman 2006). Nevertheless, with the ad­vent of indigenous archaeologies in the second half of the twentieth century and the incorporation of new theoretical perspectives, the study of in­digenous histories has focused on understanding the complexity and brutality of the experiences of these peoples during colonialism (Silliman 2005). Thus, archaeologists are conducting re­search to show: (1) the diverse nature of colo­nialism and the specific local histories associated with this process; (2) the strategies of interaction and resistance adopted by indigenous peoples when faced with attempts at economic, political, and social domination, with effects that are felt until today (Funari et al. 1999; Kristensen and Davis 2013; Lightfoot 2006; Mills 2008; Oliver 2010; Silliman 2001, 2006, 2009).

An essential aspect of this new agenda is its criticism of the assumption that indigenous pop­ulations responded passively to colonialism. It is increasingly evident that most indigenous peoples did not passively succumb to contact with Euro­peans. Rather, they quite consciously re-elabo­rated their identities and cultural traditions. Thus, the explanatory model of acculturation was re­placed by the notions of indigenous agency, cul­tural dynamics, and transformation (Silliman 2001, 2009). Adopting a view of indigenous his­tory over the longue duree, recent studies have highlighted the complex processes through which indigenous identities and ways of life both per­dured and transformed themselves, from the pre­colonial past until the present (Lightfoot 1995). Currently, historical archaeology is committed to constructing a more inclusionary and less Euro­centric narrative about the process of colonialism on the American continent. 
This article contributes to this new agenda for the historical archaeology of indigenous peoples by presenting the results of a collaborative ar­chaeological study currently underway among the Asurini do Xingu. Our objective is to show that the dynamics of territorial mobility and oc­cupation of this group during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries can be understood as a strat­egy of resistance by the Asurini to preserve their way of life in the face of colonialism and the ex­pansion of capitalism in the middle Xingu River region of the Amazon. 
The Asurini do Xingu 
The Asurini are an indigenous Amazonian people whose subsistence is based on agriculture, hunt­ing, fishing, and gathering natural resources (Silva 2008). They speak a language of the Tupi-Guarani linguistic family (Rodrigues and Cabral 2012). They call themselves awa ete (real humans be­ings), but have also adopted the name Asurini. This name was given to them as early as the late nineteenth century due to the custom of applying a reddish coloring to their hair and bodies with pigment extracted from urucum (Bixa orellana L.). The denomination of Asurini do Xingu arose when the group was officially contacted in the early 1970s, to distinguish them from the Asurini do Trocara who had been known since the 1950s 
and who live along the Tocantins River (Fausto 2001:85; Laraia 1967:35, 37). Currently, the Asurini do Xingu live in the Terra Indfgena Koat­inemo (Koatinemo Indigenous Land) in the east­ern Amazon, in the Brazilian state of Para. They inhabit the villages of Kuatinemu and Itaaka on the southeastern bank of the Xingu River (Figure 1). 
A notable aspect of the history of the Asurini do Xingu is a recent population decline caused by attacks from enemy groups and epidemic dis­eases, which have resulted in an imbalance in their age distribution. More than half of the 
Asurini are now younger than 25 . Consequently, there are few adults capable of transmitting tra­ditional knowledge and many youths and children who have diverse experiences of socialization and cultural participation, as well as intense con­tact with Western goods and ways of life (Mi.iller 2002). According to the Asurini themselves, this situation creates an urgent need to preserve the knowledge of the older generations about their history and way of life. 
Historical Sources 
The oldest historical information about the 
Asurini do Xingu dates from the late nineteenth century. It includes few and sparse references collected during the mapping expedition on the Xingu River by Henri Coudreau ( 1977), comple­mented by data gathered by German ethnologist Curt Nimuendaju (1993) after 1917. Other men­tions of interest come from two other expeditions to the Xingu: that of Prince Adalbert of Prussia ( 1849) in 1842 and that of German ethnologist Karl von den Steinen (1942) in 1884. The two men recorded different phases of the colonization of the Xingu River in the search for rubber, cacao, and other rainforest products below Volta Grande, between the city of Altamira and the Ipixuna River. Nearly a century earlier, in 1750, Jesuit priests had established a mission among indige­nous peoples below Volta Grande, but it lasted briefly and its written sources have yet to be pub­lished or studied. 
In 1842, Adalbert met with the first extrac­tivists who had gone beyond Volta Grande at pro­visional encampments within territory dominated by the Juruna indigenes. When Steinen descended

people, extending from the margins of the Xingu to a number of its affluents where rubber extrac­tion took place. 
In December of 1842, Adalbert and his expe­dition navigated the Xingu River from its mouth up to the confluence with the Piranhaquara River (see Figure 1). One of the members of the expe­dition was Father Torquato Antonio de Sousa, vicar of Souzel, who, according to Adalbert (1849:215), "was just the man we needed, and the more so from his position, and the respect in which he was held by the Indians," given that he had served as a missionary in the Volta Grande region since 1841. Adalbert repeats a few times that the Europeans in his expedition were the first white people to reach the Piranhaquara, reporting that few Brazilians had gone beyond Volta Grande at that time. Nevertheless, there are records of locals having gone from there to Souzel to trade, exchanging indigenous products for industrially produced goods. He also wrote about the func­tioning of the extractive systems at locations "widely scattered on the banks of the river," with periods of concentration in Souzel in the winter, from June to December, to observe religious hol­idays and to collect rubber. The extractivists left "during summer to collect sarsaparilla, balsam of copaiva, clove-cassia, cocoa, etc. The men likewise hunt and fish, while the women remain at the 'sitios' [sites], and preparefarinha [flour] with which they trade" (Adalbert 1849:219). 
To go beyond Volta Grande, the expedition traveled by land on a trail opened by Father Torquato, more or less over the same route that the Jesuits originally cleared for their mission in 1750. According to Adalbert, there was a Juruna village at a location called Tavaquara, where Fa­ther Torquato founded the Missao da Imperatriz and brought together some 300 Juruna from a population he estimated at 2,000 people. He also described other locations inhabited by the Juruna: the Ilha dos Taconhapes (where they planted), Cavitia, Martinho's house, Pintateua, Ponta (Pas­saf), Carlos's house (at the mouth of the Iriri River), Castanhal (Muruxitema), Jacuf, Piran­haquara, Araraquahapunhum, and Uaquefuoga. 
Along the margins of the Xingu River, beyond the Jacuf River, Adalbert (1849:300) reported the presence, "in considerable groups," of jauari palms. We now know that these plants were there because of indigenous agroforestry. The settle­ment of Piranhaquara was on a small sandy island, where there was 
one of the Malocas called Piranhaquara, or Piranhosucuar. Upon a sandy island stood three Juruna huts, surrounded with plantations of mandioca, cotton, plantains, and melancias [a kind of water-melon] . These patches of culti­vated ground are usually met with near the Indian huts, but they have no hedges and are greatly neglected. Opposite to the landing­place, from which the bank rises gradually up to the chieftain's hut, lay another islet, sepa­rated from the former by a narrow channel [Adalbert 1849:300] . 
Up the Xingu River, an hour from this location, were the villages of Araraquahapunhum and Uaquefuoga, or Uaqueouocha (Adalbert 1849:309). Adalbert also makes an interesting and intriguing description of a scene that occurred in the "casa [house] de Martinho," during a mo­ment of trading between his companions on the expedition and the Juruna. It involved his com­panions' interest in a ceramic vessel, whose owner does not appear to have made the trade: 
[It was a] vessel used to hold the oil of the Uauassu-palm, with which the women anoint the hair and bodies of their husbands, to protect the skin against the stings of insects: this vessel was made of a gourd, stained dark-brown by the oil, and ornamented with Greek arabesques carved round it: who would have dreamt of meeting with figures from the antique in an Indian hut? [Adalbert 1849:277]. 
The description reveals that it was not a Juruna vessel, but one typical of the Asurini do Xingu. Despite the scant information, this is an indication of a possible contact between the Asurini do Xingu and the Juruna. 
The presence of extractivists and hunters had become constant by 1884, when Steinen's expe­dition passed through the region. At that time the rubber-gathering period was from September to January, and the tappers came from Souzel, camp­ing and clearing areas for planting along the Xingu and its larger tributaries (Steinen 1942:328). In his report, the ethnologist affirms that the last encampments of the extractivists and

hunters were 20 km north of the Iriri River and that "Brazilians" worked there, considered to be "new in the surroundings, rubber purchasers" (Steinen 1942:328). Another Brazilian lived on Itapaiuna Island, a "businessman farmer" who was absent when the German expedition passed through. The location had previously been occu­pied by Arara indigenes who had already passed away when Steinen reached the location. The eth­nologist reached the Piranhaquara region in Oc­tober 1884, and considered it to be the limit of the land already known by Brazilians. Steinen encountered the abandoned habitations of a Ju­runa indigenous leader. In addition, as he de­scended the Xingu, Steinen (1942:320-325) recorded the presence of locations dominated by "slender and swaying tucuns" and the frequent presence of other species, including taquarais (bamboo groves) and inaj<i palms. These were obviously marks of anthropogenic forests that characterize this region to this day. Some obser­vations from the ethnologist can help understand the indigenous occupation of that area of the Xingu River. Steinen reports on the presence of the Peuas orTucunapeuas at the approximate lat­itude of 3° 30' S, about 30 km south of the city of Altamira, and comments that about 500 of them descended from the upper Iriri River due to pressure from other indigenous groups. Many died from "swamp fever" (malaria), and the group was reduced to 70 people in 1884 (Steinen 
1942:325) . This is an example of the external pressures that forced population shifts in the re­gion and of the impacts of epidemics on indige­nous demography in that period. 
Coudreau (1977:37) wrote in 1896 that the Asurini inhabited "exclusively the right bank" of the Xingu River, "from the proximity of Piran­haquara to Praia Grande" and the inlands to the middle Bacaja River. However, Coudreau (1 977:44) did not report on any indigenous set­tlement on the Piranhaquara River, although he mentioned that the Asurini circulated in the vicin­ity. He reported that the Asurini had a village in the middle Ipixuna River, above the second wa­terfall (Coudreau 1977:48). This area is consid­ered to be one of the richest in the region. It has most of the extractivist products of the Amazon, and the islands close to its mouth were an "arch­ipelago of rubber." This bounty of products at­tracted various extractivists, creating a violent social environment that still persisted in 1915, when Nimuendaju (1952) reached the region. 
Coudreau (1977) and Nimuendaju (1948:225) reported on a series of attacks by the Asurini against those invading their territories. In 1894, at Praia Grande (just south of Altamira), they at­tacked a transport boat. In 1896 and in following years there was news of Asurini attacks on the cove of Passaf, once again at Praia Grande, and in the settlement of Triunfo. According to Nimuendaju, around 1917 indigenous attacks on the right bank of the Xingu River diminished be­cause of the increase in the Brazilian population in the region, but their hostility increased against those who went up the Bacaja River and came close to their villages. In 1920, the Asurini were located between the Xingu and Bacaja, where they waged "war against the civilized" (Nimuen­daju 1993:150). Thus, around 1922 the local res­idents incited the Arara indigenes, giving them arms and munitions for a "war of extermination" against the Asurini. At this time, part of the Asurini were occupying the region of the head­waters of the Rio Branco, a tributary of the Bacaja River. In 1932, they killed a local at the mouth of the Born Jardim River (south of Altamira). These reports confirm Coudreau's information on the presence of Asurini in the region of the middle Ipixuna River, and later in the region close to the upper Bacaja River (Fig. 2). In 1936, they were attacked by a group of Gorotire-Kayap6 who came from the upper Bacaja River. Finally, Nimuendaju (1948:225) reports that by the end of the 1930s the Asurini were "almost annually attacking whatever rubber tappers ventured into their territory." 
The toponymy of the waterways that persists until today appears to be of Juruna origin. The name for the Piranhaquara or Piranhosucuar River was recorded for the first time in 1842 by Adalbert and has persisted until today. Nonetheless, the Asurini call it /pium yh, "River of the gnats" (Miiller 1990:38). The lpia9ava River is mentioned for the first time in Coudreau's book (1977:44) as "Pia9aba Island"; the Asurini call it Bauref (Miiller 1990:38). The name of the Ipixuna River appears for the first time in Coudreau (1977:48), spelled as "ltapixuna," while the Asurini call it /pirauyh (Millier 1990:39). Millier (1990:40) records the

names that the Asurini gave the other affluents on the right bank of the Xingu, to the north of the Ip­ixuna River: Uruvuy, Tukunareyh, Maritaoho, Auarabe, Arapesing{ and Tapikwauar( (probably the Born Jardim or Sao Jose River). 
Historical records, therefore, show that the Asurini occupied the area from the middle to up­per Bacaja River, that they circulated through the headwaters of the Piranhaquara and Ipias;ava rivers and the middle course of the Ipixuna River, and that they had probable contact with the Ju­runa. In fact, during the twentieth century the ter­ritory between the left bank of the Bacaja River and the right bank of the Xingu River down to the Ipixuna River (Figure 2) was known as the "land of the Asurini" (Lukesch 1976: 1 I).

The Places of Memory 
During the colonialization process and the capi­talist expansion that followed in the Xingu River basin, various indigenous groups were pushed from their territories in the direction of other in­digenous groups based on a geopolitical domino effect. These territorial invasions triggered con­flicts and more deaths among indigenous peoples, followed by further territorial shifts. This was the case of the Parakana, Kayap6, and Arawete, who launched mutual attacks on each other in the first decades of the twentieth century, and whose ter­ritorial movements deeply affected the life of the Asurini do Xingu beginning in the 1920s (Fausto 2001:39-101; Fischer 1991:62-74; Muller 1990:36-37; Viveiros de Castro 1986:166-167). 
The oldest memory of the Asurini leads us to the area of the affluents on the left bank of the Bacaja River. This history was initially recovered by Betta Ribeiro (1982:27) through statements from 20 people who were born there. Later, Fabiola Silva (20 I 3) interviewed a woman who was born in Bacaja and provided more detail to this history. She related that the Asurini moved from there to the upper courses of the Ipia9ava and Piranhaquara rivers due to pressure from rubber extractivists and attacks from the Gorotire-Kayap6. In the area of lpia9ava, they were attacked by the Xikrin-Kayap6. This led them to settle in the region of the upper Piran­haquara River, where 16 people were born (Ribeiro 1982:27). Based on information gath­ered by William Fisher (1991:62, 72), it is pos­sible to situate the movement of the Asurini out­side the region ofBacaja between 1925 and 1927, when the Gorotire, pressured by extractivists, at­tacked the Xikrin, the Asurini, and the Arawete. We conclude that it is possible to define the pe­riod of the Asurini departure from Ipia9ava for Piranhaquara at around I 930 or a bit earlier (Fig­ure 3). 
The Asurini established various villages in the area of the Piranhaquara, including Ipukui, Tapipiri, ltapytiuu, and Myiryna. Because of new attacks from the Xikrin in the mid-1950s, they moved to the lpixuna River, in what is now the Arawete Indigenous Land (Fisher 199 I :76; Muller 1990:36--40). Some Asurini in their fifties say that they were born in the villages on the Ip­
ixuna River. They stayed there until the early 1960s, at which time they were expelled by the Arawete, who moved there in the late 1950s, pushed by the Xikrin-Kayap6 and Parakana (Fausto 2001:39-101; Fisher 1991:78; Viveiros de Castro 1986:135-144, 166-169). TheAsurini returned to the region of the Piranhaquara River, where they remained until the late 1960s, when they were once again attacked by the Xikrin and Arawete (Fisher 1991:78; Viveiros de Castro I 986:44). They then moved to the Ipia9ava River, where they dispersed into small groups consisting mainly of relatives. At this time, their population was quite reduced, and they occupied only one village, known as Taiuviaka, and various encamp­ments, with smaller and more scattered planted areas. Given the frequent conflicts and concerned about the population loss suffered over the years, the Asurini opted for contact with white people, believing this would be the best strategy to avoid continued attacks and more deaths (Silva 2013). 
The Asurini were officially contacted in 1971 , first by the priests Anton and Karl Lukesch and later by the National Indian Foundation (FUNAI) (Lukesch 1976; Mtiller 1990:40). Soon after con­tact, the Asurini established themselves in the village of Akapepugi, on the right bank of the Ip­ia9ava River, in the same location where they had first seen the Lukesh priests and their expe­dition. The site is considered dangerous and sad by the Asurini because many of them died there from diseases acquired from contact with the priests' expedition. Some of those who died at 
Akapepugi were buried in a small tavyva (com­munal house) and others were transported to the village of Taiuviaka. This settlement lasted until 1972, when they came to occupy the village of Kwatinemu Velho on the same river, at a place chosen by FUNAI to begin the definitive process of their settlement and "pacification." They re­mained there until 1985, when they were trans­ferred to the right banks of the Xingu River, first to the village of Avatikirera, which was soon abandoned, and then to the current village of Ku­atinemu (Muller 1990:35--40; Silva et al. 2011). 
The first years of contact represented a new phase of population loss that began to revert only in the late 1990s. In 1982, the Asurini do Xingu numbered 55 people, and in 2014 they totaled some 180 people. In 2011, stronger in numbers,

with young political leaders, and with greater au­tonomy in relation to FUNAI's guardianship, they founded a new village called ltaaka in the far north of the Koatinemo Indigenous Land, on the banks of the Xingu River (Silva 2013). 
Collaborative Archaeological Research 
In 2008, following a request of the Asurini, we formulated the project Territ6rio e hist6ria dos Asurini do Xingu. Um estudo bibliografico, doc­umental, arqueol6gico e etnoarqueol6gico sabre a trajet6ria hist6rica dos Asurini do Xingu ( seculo dezenove aos dias atuais) (Territory and History of the Asurini do Xingu. A Bibliographic, Docu­mentary, Archaeological, and Ethnoarchaeological 
Study of the Historical Trajectory of the Asurini Do Xingu [from the Nineteenth Century until To­day]). The general objective of this collaborative archaeological research was to understand the "history of territory formation" (Zedefio 2008)­that is, the dynamics and vicissitudes of the Asurini occupation of the Koatinemo Indigenous Land over time. The specific objectives were: (1) to locate and establish geographic references for the former and current locations of Asurini occu­pations on the Ipiac,;ava River; (2) to examine parts of the Indigenous Lands that had not been visited in years and that could be invaded by land grab­bers, lumberers, squatters, etc.; (3) to document the autobiographical reports of the elders about their experience of the contact event and their life in the different locations they occupied on the Ip­iac,;ava River; and (4) to conduct a survey of the archaeological potential of this region of the Xingu River, including non-Asurini sites. 
Over 12 days in 2010, we traveled 70 km up the Ipiac,;ava River, camping on its banks. In this period, we located four former villages (Awatikir­era, Kwatinemu Velho, Akapepugi, and Taiuvi­aka) and an encampment site (ltapemuu) (Silva et al. 2011). When we returned from the expedi­tion on the Ipiac,;ava, the Asurini immediately ex­pressed an intention to continue with the project, and we soon planned to go up the Piranhaquara River, where there were larger and older villages. The words of a youth named K wain reveal the Asurini's motivation for continuing the study: "What we really want is to find the oldest villages about which our people speak. It is a difficult 
journey to reach these places, but it is very im­portant that we see up close what is happening with our lands." 
In 2012, we prepared the project Territ6rio e mem6ria dos Asurini do Xingu. Arqueologia co­laborativa na T 1. Koatinemo-Pard, Brasil (Ter­ritory and Memory of the Asurini do Xingu. Col­laborative Archaeology in the Koatinemo Indigenous Land, Para, Brazil), which was similar to the first project, but with the objective of lo­
cating the villages from the period prior to 1971. In the first stage, we traveled for 16 days in May 2013, about 140 km from the mouth of the Pi­ranhaquara River. We found the villages of Ipukui, Tapipiri, Itapytiuu, and Myiryna, along with nine more non-Asurini archaeological sites (some located in the T.I. Arawete). 
The Asurini do Xingu: (1) participated in the 
elaboration of the project's proposals; (2) were 
responsible for the research dynamics, defining 
the routes to be taken, choosing the locations for 
camping, and indicating the location of the sites 
to be studied-that is, the old villages in which 
the elderly Asurini lived during their childhood; 
(3) made decisions and participated in the survey of the archaeological potential of the area and in the logistics of the expeditions; ( 4) indicated the possible locations to be prospected in the ancient villages, based on their knowledge about the dis­tribution of activity areas and domestic and col­lective structures; (5) made decisions about whether or not to remove the most significant 
Asurini archaeological materials; and (6) defined which archaeological material would remain on the Indigenous Land, in the schools, or in their homes. 
During the study, we noted different percep­tions of what we were doing on the part of the Asurini, and this allowed us to better understand the reasons for their effort during the fieldwork. One day, when we returned from our prospecting activities at the village of Tapipiri, a youth who held a kavio{-a vessel used to carry water that has not been produced in years-made the fol­lowing comment: "Fabiola, we can see this pro­ject as a type of recovery. I am going to take this pot and save it for my daughter. When she grows up, she can learn to make this pot the way the el­ders did." This statement reveals that the study allowed the Asurini to revive their relations with

their ancestors. The ceramic pots and the old vil­lages are vestiges of the activities and way of life of the peoples of the past. At the same time, they help give meaning to the lives of the Asurini in the present and the future. 
Field Research 
The field research adapted survey methods and techniques to the context of the tropical forest. The inspection methods taken in the survey in­cluded: (1) visual inspection of the areas studied, using as geographic references the Ipia,ava and Piranhaquara Rivers, based on travel by boat or foot; (2) location of the former Asurini settlements and other archaeological sites using an oppor­tunistic and probabilistic strategy, considering in­dications by the Asurini about the managed areas and the locations of the old villages (Banning 2002: 113); (3) the archaeologists and the Asurini conducted visual inspections at the hunting, fish­ing, and rest encampments that we used along the rivers; (4) the procedures for identifying land­scape elements and site locations, as well as the collection of surface and subsurface material and soundings-test pits and shovel testing-were conducted randomly in the areas studied (Ban­ning 2002:42-43, 89-94, 116-121). In addition to these procedures, the visual inspection of the surface and subsurface could also be comple­mented by in loco observations of ecofacts (e.g., dark earth, raised land, etc.) or bio-disturbances (fallen trees, animal dens, etc.; Schiffer 1987: 199­234). Our priority in the survey was to locate the 
former Asurini villages and to undertake prelim­inary archaeological research of the area. 
The Koatinemo Indigenous Land is covered by dense vegetation. This did not negatively af­fect the investigation because all the archaeo­logical sites and former villages are located in places where forest management had occurred in the past and continues to take place in the pre­sent, providing good visibility for the archaeo­logical approach. The Ipia,ava and Piranhaquara rivers have fluvial channels that oscillate from broader and deeper portions with good naviga­bility to narrow portions with many igap6s­flooded forests with dense vegetation over the flu vial channel-and rocky outcroppings and long gravel beds where navigation is difficult. 
The latter are present especially in the mid-course and closer to the headwaters. It is important to mention that the navigability of both rivers is seasonal, which influenced the scheduling of the research. The studies on both rivers were con­ducted in May because at the peak of the rainy season (December-May) the volume of rain would impede the archaeological interventions, whereas in the dry season (June-November) the scarcity of water would make navigation impos­sible along various portions of the rivers. During the research, it was necessary to carefully observe the flow of the waters each day because of the risk that some stretches would be shallow, im­peding navigation on the return. It was also nec­essary to establish a very precise schedule for locating the villages and conducting archaeolog­ical interventions. 
In the work of identifying the former Asurini villages and encampments, the elders indicated their locations and showed the youths the marks that confirmed the existence of the former places of occupation (secondary vegetation/ capoeiras, dark earth, old trails in the woods, remains of posts from tavyvas [communal houses], ceramics, lithic material, and cemeteries). The youths con­ducted the heavy work, such as opening trails in the woods, clearing passages for the canoes, mounting the camps, and finding and preparing food. They also learned to use the equipment (e.g., GPS, compass, excavation tools), collected the archaeological material, and translated infor­mation from the elders who are not bilingual about the locations of settlements and archaeo­logical materials (Figure 4). 
Another important factor that had to be con­sidered when making decisions about the method­ologies used during the study was the number of participants: 55 people on the Ipiaava River (49 
Asurini, 3 archaeologists, 1 healthcare assistant, and 2 teachers) and 98 people on the Piranhaquara River (91Asurini,4 archaeologists, I anthropol­ogist, 1 healthcare assistant, and I cook) . The Asurini participants included men, women, and children, with ages ranging from 2 months to 85 years old. For this reason, it was essential to reg­ulate the research activities with the dynamics of the encampments, finding food (hunting and fish­ing), eventual health problems, interpersonal con­flicts , and willingness (or not) to work.

Former Villages and Archaeological Sites in the Koatinemo Indigenous Land 
The Koatinemo Indigenous Land has a diverse terrain, including plains, hills, flat-topped hills and inselbergs. In the portion that surrounds the Piranhaquara and lpiaava rivers, the terrain is composed of small plateaus, creating gradually inclined slopes. Flat areas resulting from fluvial accumulation are common and subject to periodic flooding. They include floodplains, oxbow lakes, alluvial channels, and dikes parallel to the current bed of the Xingu River. The area is classified as climate zone A (tropical rainforest), variation tropical monsoon (Am). This climate type is char­acterized by intense monsoon-type rains from December to May and a dry season from June to November. In general, the entire region is part of the Amazon forest ecosystem on terra firma. The middle Xingu River region is dominated by rain­forest with sparse undergrowth, including palm forests (e.g., babas:u, inaja, paxiuba, bacaba) and woody lianas (vine forests) associated with deep latosol and podzolic soils (Silva 2012). In the middle Xingu River, there also are secondary forests on patches of red and yellow latosols with a clay-sandy texture. In this region, the palm and vine forests are considered indications of envi­ronmental management related to the establish­ment of the Tupi-Guarani populations, which for much time has been the subject of studies in his­torical ecology (Bahe 2000, 2013; Balee and Campbell 1990; Smith 1980). These studies have demonstrated a correspondence between the area in which these forests occur and the distribution of archaeological sites and anthropogenic soil in the region between the Xingu and Tocantins rivers, confirming the existence of ancient forest management. These practices were undertaken by the Asurini and other indigenous populations, and they continue to this day (Figure 5). 
We observed that all the old villages, garden areas, and other archaeological sites are associated with secondary, palm, and vine forests in ad­vanced stages of regeneration (Silva et al. 2011). In addition, we also observed the presence of cul-

tivated species and, in most places, of dark earth. The old villages are located preferentially along the upper courses of the rivers. They are on non­ftoodable terraces and hilltops, generally sur­rounded by rock outcroppings where we found lithic workshops with polishing and sharpening stones. The archaeological sites and the old vil­lages are located in "cultural forests" (Balee 2013) and present diverse materials (e.g., ceramic ves­sels, lithic artifacts, and house posts; Figure 6). The multicomponent sites (the villages of Kwatinemu Velho, Akapepugi, lpukui, Tapipiri, Myiryna, ltapytiuu, and the ltapemuu encamp­ment) have on their surfaces associations of ma­terials from two different occupations: (1) non­Asurini occupation (e.g., ceramic material, polished and flaked lithic material, organic re­mains, posts from various structures, and char­coal); and (2) Asurini occupation (e.g., ceramic vestige material, industrialized material, organic remains, and various structures) (Figure 7). The single-component sites have Asurini materials 
from before (the Taiuviaka village) or after con­tact (the Awatikirera village) . Some settlements are located on non-floodable floodplains (the vil­lages of Kuatinemu Velho, Akapepugi, Ipukui, Tapipiri, and Itapytiuu) or partially floodable ar­eas (the village of Awatikirera). Others are close to hill areas (the Itapemuu encampment and the village of Myiryna) or far from the rivers (the village of Taiuviaka). All the sites are associated with lithic workshops located on the banks of the Xingu River or on the Ipiaava and Piran­haquara rivers, and most have dark earth. The currently occupied villages are also associated with non-Asurini occupations; Kuatinemu is on a non-floodable river delta, and Itaaka is on top of a hill. Both are associated with lithic work­shops. The other nine non-Asurini archaeological sites located along the Piranhaquara River (lta­
juara, Maritaiva'pija, Kumanuyka, Araypij a, Araypija II, ltatatu, Uirasimbe, Cachoeira, Uirasimbe, and Myrina II) are on terraces and hilltops (see Figure 3).

Figure 6. Asurini collaborator describing the characteristics of Asurini ceramics to an anthropologist at Myiryna village. Various similar statements were recorded during fieldwork. 
Walking through the former Asurini villages, the older residents soon tried to locate the tavyva (communal house). They also recalled events ex­perienced by themselves and their relatives, the 
powerful pajes (shamans), the grand rituals, as well as the conflicts with other indigenous peo­ples, the escapes, the disease, and the deaths. For example, when we reached the village ofltapipiri, the oldest Asurini shaman picked up a ceramic vessel that he said was his aunt's, and from which he had often drank porridge. During the entire time that we were at this village he carried the vessel in his arms, talking about his memories and singing the songs that he heard at the time of the grand rituals. Following the example of the old shaman, a number of youths began to look for other vessels, and soon various whole or nearly whole vessels were recovered. Some whole vessels were taken to the current villages and a large vessel for cooking porridge was taken to the indigenous school. Other whole vessels, or those that could be reassembled, were entrusted to the Museu de Arqueologia e Etnologia of the Universidade de Sao Paulo. 
Mobility and Territory of the 
Asurini do Xingu 

Understanding the movements of human popu­lations is important for archaeology because it 
allows us to contextually understand the concepts 
of expansion, migration, abandonment, mobility, 
and territoriality. In recent decades, various stud­
ies dedicated to the issue (Barnard and Wendrich 
2008; Bowser and Zedeiio 2009; Cameron et al. 
1996; Sellet et al. 2006; Snead et al. 2009) have 
demonstrated that: ( l) the spatial distribution of 
populations is based on their notions of explo­
ration, maintenance, perception, and signification 
of the landscape; (2) the technological organiza­
tion of populations results from their strategies 
for exploration, transformation, and maintenance 
of natural resources; (3) social and ideological 
factors influence the spatial distribution of set­
tlements and the locations of specific activities, 
strategies for exploitation of natural resources, 
and the extent of territories; and ( 4) the notion of 
territory presupposes continued and significant 
use of a space over time. Specifically in relation

history of the Asurini do Xingu allows us to dis­cuss a few key questions: (1) How can the notion of mobility be applied to the situation of the Asurini? (2) How can their process of movement and territorial occupation be analyzed in the con­text of colonialist expansion and the advance of capitalism? (3) What is the role of archaeological research in complementing and testing available historical and oral information about their move­ments in these Amazonian lands? 
As we have discussed, historical sources and oral narratives situate the Asurini territory be­tween the middle Bacaja River and the upper lp­ia9ava, Piranhaquara, and Ipixuna rivers since at least the nineteenth century. This situation led Nimuendaju (1948:213) to describe the Asurini as one of the "tribes of the central pristine forest." Coudreau (1977:37) affirms that the Asurini had "always [lived] in the central forests, never on the margins" of the large rivers. The data reveal that, over the past 120 years, the Asurini have been establised in a well-defined area. Little is known about the historical processes that led to this conjuncture in the late nineteenth century. 
The Asurini did not live in complete isolation, given that there were other populations around them (Fausto 200 I; Fisher 1991; Nimuendaju 1948; Viveiros de Castro 1986). The banks of the Xingu River were the domain of the Juruna indi­genes, who lived there until 1916. On the Iriri River lived the Shipaya, and on the Curua River the Curuaya. The Tacunyapes indigenes lived on the lower Bacaja River and on part of the Volta Grande until the end of the nineteenth century. The Arawete lived on the Upper Bacaja. From the right bank of the Bacaja to the Tocantins River lived the Parakana, the Asurini do Trocara, and the Kayap6 (Gorotire and Xikrin). All of these in­digenous populations have a history of territorial and demographic losses and passed through cycles of forced mobility until their lands began to be of­ficially defined in the 1980s and 1990s. This al­lowed them to recover demographically and to at­tain greater autonomy, as in the case of theAsurini. 
The demographic and geopolitical situation of the indigenous peoples in the region was greatly affected by the arrival of the Europeans in the late sixteenth century. An overview of the indige­nous populations of the lower and middle Xingu River (Nimuendaju 1948), showed a continuous 
demographic decline caused mainly by epi­demics, and to a lesser degree by war and slavery. These two threats did not occur systematically in the area above Volta Grande, close to the Asurini territory, because that portion of the Xingu River was considered one of "the most difficult to nav­igate in Brazil" (Nimuendaju 19848:213). We be­lieve that this natural barrier truly reduced access by colonists in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Nevertheless, the information available also suggests that the presence of large indigenous populations was the main impediment to colonial advance above Volta Grande. Unfortunately, ge­ographic and demographic factors did little against the advance of epidemics, which led to the demographic collapse of the indigenous pop­ulations and allowed access to extractivists in the second half of the nineteenth century. Epidemics have continued to affect the size of various pop­ulations during the twentieth century, as in the case of the Asurini, and have led others to com­plete extinction, as in the case of the Tacunyape (Milller 1990). The combination of demographic reduction and conflicts with extractivists also led some surviving indigenous populations to aban­don the area. This was the case of the Juruna, who traveled approximately 1,000 km up the 
Xingu River to settle in what is now the Xingu Indigenous Park (Parque Indfgena Xingu). 
Given this context, there are two main reasons for the mobility of the Asurini do Xingu. The first is as a reaction to the advance of extractivists in the region above Volta Grande, up the affluents of the Xingu and approaching Asurini territory, due to the growing demand for rubber. It is prob­able that the attacks by the Asurini recorded in historical sources resulted from conflicts with ex­tractivists and were a strategy to keep them away from Asurini villages. The second reason is to escape attacks by the Gorotire, Xikrin, and Arawete, who invaded Asurini lands to establish themselves there. 
Our collaborative archaeological research was planned based on oral narratives, and guided and supported by the statements collected in loco from the Asurini on the Piranhaquara and Ipia9ava rivers. This allowed us to piece together a histor­ical narrative showing that the Asurini had their origins in various local groups. It is also possible to affirm that, in the first decades of the twentieth

century, they were more numerous and had vari­ous villages. According to reports from the Asurini, the villages of Ipukui, Tapipiri, Muiryna, and Itapytiuu, which possibly date to the 1930s and 1940s, were contemporary and lasted for a number of years. They were relatively extensive settlements with tavyvas from 20 m to 40 m long encircled by houses and surrounded by large plan­tations and trails that linked the villages. People used the trails to visit relatives, establish new res­idences, or participate in subsistence activities or rituals. Our archaeological prospections found an abundance of ceramic materials, along with ex­tensive and deep layers of dark earth. Among the 
Asurini today, the few elders who lived in these villages did so as children. For this reason, the chronology and dynamics of the territorial occu­pation have yet to be established precisely. These villages were abandoned for strategic reasons in the second half of the 1950s. In order to avoid confrontations with the Xikrin, the Asurini vil­lages moved to the area of the Ipixuna River. 
The settlements along the Ipia9ava River date from the 1960s and 1970s, and their occupational dynamics are understood more precisely. The memory of former residents is clearer, especially concerning the settlement system and the causes of population loss. The settlements are propor­tionally smaller and have a less abundant archae­ological materials than those on the Piranhaquara River. For example, the village of Taiuviaka was strategically located for greater protection 4 km from the right bank of the Ipia9ava River. It was occupied by some 15 people for a short time be­fore contact. It had a large tavyva built to shelter the grave of a youth who died from disease. Dur­ing archaeological prospections, we identified the posts of the tavyva and limited archaeological materials, confirming the short duration of the occupation. The other local groups were dispersed in small encampments close to the margins of the Ipia9ava River, such as the Itapemuu encamp­ment. All of these locations were linked by trails to permit constant contact. According to the 
Asurini, this strategy of dispersion was necessary 
to remain less vulnerable to attacks by their ene­mies, especially the Arawete. 
Nimuendaju's definition, reported above, that the Asurini were residents of the interior of the "pristine forest" can no longer be considered valid. The Asurini constantly call our attention to the managed locations that served for them as points of reference in the landscape. This land­scape is easily distinguished from the non-man­aged landscape, giving direct indications of past occupations. 
In the mid-1970s Miiller (1990) recorded more than 57 places named by the Asurini, situated in time and place, including trails, rivers, encamp­ments, and old villages. These villages were es­tablished between the first half of the twentieth century and the 1970s and are mostly located in the regions of the headwaters of the Ipia9ava, Pi­ranhaquara, and Ipixuna rivers. Some of these places were mapped based on the memory of the elder Asurini during the process of demarcating the Koatinemo Indigenous Land. Of the 22 vil­lages mapped in that period, we were able to locate only six during this study, demonstrating that there is still much work to be done in the field. 
All of the data presented demonstrate that the Asurini knew and controlled this territory. Our study in the area of the Ipia9ava and Piranhaquara rivers shows that the establishment of the Asurini in this region cannot be understood as settlement by refugees. Although they lived through episodes of forced mobility, the Asurini passed through lands known to them for generations, as is 
re­
vealed in the archaeological and historical data and their oral reports. 
Finally, it should be noted that the post-contact villages (Akapepugi, Kuatinemu Velho, Avatikir­era, and Kuatinemu) were established or aban­doned for reasons related to the process of "paci­fication" (e.g., to eradicate epidemics, receive health assistance, facilitate administrative control and logistics for the village from FUNAI, or en­hance accessibility to urban centers and their re­sources). The material record indicates that all of these villages were occupied for a short duration by small numbers of people. In recent years, with a growing population and free of the threat of at­tack, the Asurini have returned to their cultural practices of mobility and territorial occupation and have become independent of FUNAI guardianship. The village of Itaaka is an example of this: it was 
founded by descendants of one of the local Asurini groups from the pre-contact period to establish their political and economic autonomy from those who live in the Kuatinemu village.

Conclusion 
We are still far from reconstucting the history of indigenous occupation in the region of the middle Xingu River and its transformations in the context of colonialism and capitalist expansion. Historical sources are scarce and further study of the reli­gious missions is needed, as is research on the colonial and state bureaucracy since the sixteenth century (Chambouleyron and Alonso 2010; Lorimer 1989; Souza and Cardozo 2008). Ar­chaeological studies must likewise be expanded. Existing data reveal intense human presence in the region since at least 1700 cal B .P. (Garcia 2012; Silva et al. 2004). Finally, it is necessary to place greater emphasis on the oral tradition and memories of the indigenous peoples of the region. It is essential for us to know their cultural history based on their own narratives. 
Various studies have demonstrated that a con­fluence of historical, ethnographic, and archaeo­logical perspectives is useful for approaching the long-term history of indigenous populations (Col­well-Chanthaphonh and Ferguson 2008; Ferguson and Colwell-Chanthaphonh 2006; Flexner 2014; Oliver 2010; Silliman 2008). An archaeological study of the recent past, such as the one we are conducting, can critically reflect on historical sources and interpretations and show the relevance of the oral tradition and memory of the indigenous peoples for an understanding of the dynamics of colonialism and capitalist expansion. Indigenous peoples resisted in a variety of ways the attempts at domination made by colonialist agents. Instead of disappearing, indigenous peoples were resilient, reaffirming their identities and reinventing their traditions and ways of life based on a dialectical process of continuity and cultural transformation (Kristensen and Davis 2013; Lightfoot 2006; Sil­liman 2001, 2005, 2006, 2009). 
The Asurini do Xingu have a dramatic history of contact that involved intense mobility, conflicts with other peoples, abandonment, and loss ofter­ritories and depopulation. Nevertheless, they were able to survive these misfortunes and, over the years, have been able to recreate their way of life. The archaeological study of their former set­tlements contributes to this process because it al­lows them to relive a portion of their history and revitalize their memory, oral tradition, and iden­tity. For the Asurini, the locations and material record of former occupations not only speak of events in the past but also give meaning to their current reality. To name and visit these places, and thus attribute meanings to them, is one way of making their own history. At the same time, to recount and relive the histories of the places and those who lived in them produces and reinforces a sense of belonging to these places. Like other peoples (Basso 1996; Bowser and Zedefio 2009; Carrol et al. 2004; Ingold 2000; Stewart et al. 2004; Whitridge 2004), the Asurini also inscribe their narratives in the landscape and in places, and in this way establish their ties with the land that they call ure yvi (our land) -the land of the 
Asurini do Xingu. In tum, these ties are reinforced to the degree to which they leave the tracks of their lives on these lands, following those of their ancestors. Thus, the territory of the Asurini do Xingu can be defined as a constructed landscape constituted by significant places. It presents a his­tory that has resulted from their activities and particular sociocultural interactions, including the occupation, reoccupation, territorial maintenance, and transformation of landscape. 
The trip on the Ipiaava and Piranhaquara Rivers not only allowed the Asurini to revisit the places of their ancestors, but also gave them the opportunity to inscribe in them their own experi­ences, interlacing past and present (Silva 2013). As a young Asurini said: 
Later we will be able to tell our children how our ancestors lived, what they ate, where they slept, where they planted, where Mureyra, Tacamui, Mwaiva [elder Asurini] and all the ancestors lived. It is very good to know our villages and recall our ancestors, what they did, how they escaped attacks, and how was their meeting with the whites. It is very impor­tant to know about our past [Fabiola Andrea Silva, Field Notes, May 2010]. 
From an archaeological perspective, to under­stand the territorial occupation of the Asurini is part of the construction of the history of the Tupi­Guarani peoples in the region between the To­cantins and Xingu Rivers since the precolonial period (Almeida 2013; Correa 2014; Garcia 2012). It is important to remember that in addition to former Asurini villages, all established above

non-Asurini occupations, we also located nine other archaeological sites. Therefore, the Koat­inemo Indigenous Land is a palimpsest where the Asurini represent the most recent register of a continuous process of indigenous occupation. It involves evidence of an indigenous history where there are no breaks between prehistory and history, but cultural continuities and transforma­tions over the long term. 
To conclude, we want to emphasize that an archaeology of the recent past of indigenous peo­ples based on collaborative archaeological prac­tices can provide the opportunity to attain a broader, more complex, multivocal, and non-colo­nialist understanding of the historical trajectories of indigenous peoples over the longue duree .
