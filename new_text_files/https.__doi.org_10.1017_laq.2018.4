THE LOST HALF OF ANDEAN ARCHITECTURE: 
EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY ROOFING TRADITIONS AND 
ENVIRONMENTAL USE AT CHINCHERO, PERU 

Stella Nair, SoniaArchila, and ChristineA.Hastorf 
This paper examines an eighteenth-century roof in Chinchero, Peru to show the critical role played by roofs in Andean communities across time. Roofs can reveal identity constructions, continuation of traditions, adaptations to new in.uences, and relationships to local environments and the sacred. We present a discussion of the importance of roofs in architectural history, the critical role played by roofs in Inca architecture, and a description of the colonial period roof in Chinchero, along with its facture, dates of construction, botanical identi.cation, and the environmental zones from where these items could have been gathered. 
En este artículo se analiza un techo del siglo dieciocho en Chinchero, Perú, con el objetivo de mostrar la importancia que tuvieron los techos en las comunidades andinas a lo largo del tiempo. Los techos revelan construcciones de identidad, continuidad de tradiciones, adaptaciones a nuevas in.uencias y relaciones con los ambientes locales y con lo sagrado. Presentamos aquí una discusión sobre la importancia de los techos para la historia de la arquitectura y el papel fundamental que estos desempeñaron en la arquitectura Inca. Asimismo, describimos el techo del periodo colonial en Chinchero y discutimos su fabricación, fechas de construcción, identi.cación botánica de los materiales y las zonas ambientales donde estos elementos podrían haberse obtenido.

thnographicstudieshaverevealed thecru­cial role that roofsplayinmodernAndean life, from design and material selection, to construction, renewal, relationship to the sacred, and reiterationoflandscape and commu­nal ties(Arnold 1991;Gose 1991;Leinaweaver 2009). Studies of structures built before AD 1532 indicate that this practice has had a long tradition(Agurto Calvo 1987;Bouchard 1983; Gasparini and Margolies 1977;Lee 1988). Despite this compelling evidence, our knowl­edge of indigenous roof-making traditions in the Andes remainsremarkably understudied. Hence, thegoalofthisprojectisto demonstratethevital evidence that one heavily damaged eighteenth-century roof can provide. Through this case study, we will show how roofs can furnish critical insight into constructionpractices, design preferences, and the long-term, entangled rela­tionship between a community and its environ­ment. A study of roofs can divulge modes of adaptation, resiliency, and knowledge transfer of traditional indigenous practices during an extended colonial occupation. 
Fromthestone carving tourdeforceofChavín de HuantarandTiwanaku,tothetapiaand adobe masterpieces of Chan Chan and Huaca de la Luna, scholarly attention has been given to a diversity of Andean structures, in particular to stones, earthen blocks, walls, platforms, and plazas. Far less attention has been given to roof design and construction. Hence, although we may know about the acoustic properties of Caral’s sunken courtyards, the construction sequences of Chavín de Huantar raised plat­forms, the labor division of adobe-making at

Huaca del Sol, or the stone carving process at Tiwanaku, we know relatively little about the historyofAndean roofs. 
Roofs are important in any architectural tra­dition that needs enclosed space. However, in some cultures, roofs were elevated to being one of the most, if not the most, important element ofabuilding.Forexample,inKorea, theroofis a visibly dominant design element that is con­sidered to be a symbol of national identity (Kim and Jeon 2012).Throughout East Asia thereisan emphasis on roof design and construction, such thatin China,Japan,andKorea,theroofhasbeen considered “the essence in architectural design” (Guo 2005:58).Roofswerestructurally complex and visibly prominent, often taking up a large partoftheexteriorofabuildingand de.ningthe interior’s character. Thus, roofs easily came to de.ne a structure and its users. Although there was exchange across time and space, distinct roo.ng traditions emerged acrossAsia, revealing local innovation as well as cultural entangle­ments(Steinhardt 2011). Manyroofsweremade of timber, and some were thatched, but others had ceramic tiles. No matter what their con.gu­ration and materials, roofs were often “the most dif.cult part of design and construction,” and hence to understand the design and construction challenges faced by builders in East Asia, one must understand the roof (Guo 2005:66). 
Studies of roofs have been instrumental in revealing culturaldevelopmentandexchangein many regions. For example, during the Roman empire, residents of Petra created distinctive roofscapes for their city by drawing from Hel­lenistic modelsofarchitecture(Hamari 2017).In Iran, residentsusedlocal materials and engineer­ing knowledge to create very distinct roof tra­ditions that conveyed identity (Regateiro 2014). In Greece, a new roof type was used to address local environmental concernsbut soon cameto symbolizereligiousaf.liation(Goldberg 1983). In Mughal architecture, roofsreveal the complex entanglements between vernacular and palace architecture and their associated communities (Nath 1987). In sum, the study of roofs can highlight designpriorities, constructionhistory, the transfer of technological knowledge and skills,the struggle between maintainingtradition and innovation, the ways communities and indi­vidualsvisualized identity,and thewaysbuilders responded to their environment (Holzer 2008; Yeomans 1986). In some parts of the world, timber roofs and their diverse truss systems have been theprimary focus of scholarly study (Yeomans 1986),but roofsof all materials and design can foster intense debates (Cheng and Shih 2008; Kim and Jeon 2012; Maki 1988; Pommer 1983). 
Although therehave been relativelyfewroof studiesin theAndes,the research that has been conducted reveals the profound role that roofs have played in community and domestic life (Arnold 1991;Gose 1991; Leinaweaver 2009; Mayer1977).Ethnographicstudiesof timberand thatched roofshighlight the complex andvaried ways in which roofs reiterated the inhabitants’ relationshiptomusic,play, ritual,history,fam­ily, community, animals,landscape, sacredness, and the cosmos. For example, in Qaqachaka (Bolivia), residents often build a single room, adobe structure with a stone foundation and a timber trussed, thatched roof(acommonAndean house type). These buildings usually have one doorway, few to no windows, and occasionally, interior niches. These residential structures are primarily used for cooking, sleeping, or forfood storage. Portions of the buildings’ walls and ceilings are often blackened from soot from the cooking .res. During initial construction, the house “becomesarepresentationofthe cosmos, a metaphor for the world mountain, and axis mundi,andanorganizing structurearound which other structures revolve” (Arnold 1991:5). Much of thesymbolismofthebuilding liesinthe roof and its structural components.Forinstance, the roof relatestotheheavens (Arnold 1991:14).The top ofthe roof, or the ridge, is interpreted as “a liminal zone between the heaven and the earth, between human body and spirit, and between theinsideandthe outsideoftheroof mountain” (Arnold 1991:24). The different parts of the roof are perceived as gendered, bothintermsof materials and the people who should work with them. During the house construction process, special libations are offered to the “source and origin” of the roof components, which include the timbers, ridge beam, rafters, tie beams, straw,and thatch roof covering (Arnold 1991:21– 22).Hence, thesacred andphysical connections

between the roof and natural environment are celebrated. 
Evenin cases whereindigenous peoplemove to thecity, and theroof materialsinclude steel and concrete, roof making and its related rituals continue to reiterate social bonds and personal relationships in theAndes (Leinaweaver 2009). Roofs also re.ect historical events, such as colonization.Forexample,in song and naming practices, the Inca are associated with both thefoundation stones and therooftops (Arnold 1991:53), and in playful and creative ways, the various structural components of the roofs have both Spanish and Aymara names (Arnold 1991). These diverse meanings expressed in a roof are particularly potent for community memory because roofs need maintenance, espe­cially thatch, which has a short lifespan and has to be periodically renewed. When a house is re-thatched, the roof’s connection to its household, history, community, and the cosmos is reiterated and remembered through rituals (Gose 1991). 
Despite these tantalizing insights into the importance of the roof in Andean cultures, therehave beenfewstudiesof indigenous roof-making practicesinthe colonial periodorbefore European arrival. Onefactorin thisoversightis the issue of durability. Traditional roofs were frequently made of organic materials that need regular renewal. By contrast, walls were more oftenmadeof durable materials that couldlast for extended periods, some even with neglect.1 A second factor is the scholarly ambivalence towards roofs, which sees them as a minor, functional aspect of a building, with relatively littletoaddto our understandingofa culture.A thirdfactor is the limited number of researchers whohavethe specializedknowledgeof structural engineeringprinciples,such as dead load, uplift, and thrust, needed to reconstruct how a roof system was designed and built, and how it withstood the harsh environmental traditions that characterizemanypartsof theAndes. 
Fortunately, there are a small but excellent collection of studies that provide tantalizing clues into the design and construction of Inca roofs(Agurto Calvo 1987;Gasparini and Mar­golies 1977;Lee 1988). These studies, which draw from surviving physical remains and colo­nial documents, highlight theimpressivenessof imperial Inca roofs, which were typically four to sixfeet thick,expertly laid and cut,sophisti­cated in their construction, visually dominated the façade of a building, de.ned the distinct character of the interior, and amazed viewers (of the exterior and interior). In effect, these large-scale, intricatelywovenand elaborateroofs (often with large eaves which obscured much of the surrounding walls) took up most of the visual experience of the building, as well as a considerable part of the construction effort. Hence, imperialInca roofs appear to have been the de.ning feature of an architectural tradition in thesameway thatKorean roofsare. 
ImperialInca roofswouldhavevaried accord­ing to the structure being covered as well as the spatial characteristics desired. Most roofs wouldhave been hipped orgabled.Forhipped roofs, theInca likelyusedtripods and tetrapods (bunchingof rafterstosupportaridgebeaminthe absenceofgables forsupport).Forgableroofs,a similar system may have sometimes been used, buttrusseswerelikelyoften employed(regularly spaced rafterswith ties and crossbeams). Gables add strength to a roof because they can hold up ridge beams, and along with trusses, can transfer tensile forces.2 Inca roof pitch ranged from 40– 60degrees.The stouteraroof became, themore tensile forceitexerted and thus thegreater the need for tension members. The steeper a roof became, the more tension force was converted into compression force, and thelesserthe need fortension members(Lee 1988:2, 20).Impe­rial Inca hipped and gabled roofs consisted of a ridgepole, timber rafters, purlins, decorative ceilingmat,lath,rope(grassor leather),reed,and grasses. Trussed roofs also had tension beams. The roof needed to be tightly sealed to prevent uplift, and this, combined with the need to transferforcestothesupportingwalls,meant that the bottomof rafters,especially thoseinstouter buildings, would usually need to be anchored to thesurroundingwalls (Lee 1988:10, 20).These thick-woven structures could carry high dead loads (the weight of the roof materials) as well as accommodate signi.cant live loads (weight of people and equipment on topofthe roof)for when the roofs were made and remade. These huge roof structures wouldhavetaken as much

as sixty to ninety percent of the visible façade of an Inca building. Although they were part of distinctly different architectural traditions,the Inca and East Asian roofs shared manysimilari­tiesinmaterials, construction, quality,and visual dominance.Likethe ShintoshrineroofsinJapan, imperial Inca thatched roofs would have been impressive and dominated the visual experience of thebuildings. 
Therenewal requirementof thatched roofsis one reason that roofs can be important to schol­ars. Materials come from grasslands, forests, and other ecological zones. Hence, by study­ing centuries old roof designs, materials, and construction techniques, we can obtain a more re.ned and temporally focused understanding of past design and construction practices as well asa community’s environmental knowledge and use. Also, understanding these architectural and environmental practices cangiveus critical clues about the constructionofhousehold and commu­nity identities, as well as cultural resilience and resistance during colonization. 
Such architectural, environmental, and cul­tural understandings can be gained in our case study of an endangered roof in Chinchero, in the central Peruvian highlands. This house is in a state of partial collapse. But what remains revealsthat this colonial periodstructureshared many similarities with Inca and other Andean roof-making practices, illustrating a resiliency of technological knowledge. The structure also reveals the community’s re.ned understanding of, and continued engagement with, the sur­rounding landscape. The latter is particularly important,asthisroofwasmade aftertheSpanish invasion in 1532, which resulted in centuries of disease, warfare, and technological change, as well as the dislocation and dispossession of indigenous people from their homelands. The impact this trauma and loss had on communities was immense and often resulted in a dramatic shiftin culturalpractices and knowledge inher­itance. As is demonstrated in this paper, roof-making practices in Chinchero continued well after the European invasion, albeit with some modi.cations,revealinghow community mem­bers maintained key construction, design, and material practices, engaging with neighboring environmental zones to harvest roof components. 
Hence,this survivingroofrevealsthe unexpected waysin whichacommunity maintained accessto critical environmental zones in order to continue and adapt their architectural traditions, despite thetraumaofthe Spanishinvasionand coloniza­tion. Although this is a case study of one roof, it has broader implications for understanding theways indigenous communitiesinthe Andes reacted to the restrictions and societal impacts wrought by the invading Iberians, when they seized lands from natives, forced indigenous peopletoworkfor Spanish individuals and insti­tutions, and introduced new designs, construc­tion technologies, and materials to the Andean world. 


Location, Site and Its Importance 
The Inca ruler Topa Inca built Chinchero in the late .fteenth century. Situated in the south-central Andes (3,762 m above sea level) Chincherowas withina day’swalktothe impe­rial Inca capitalofCuzco(Figure1).Unlikemost royal estatesthat werebuilt along thelush and warm Urubamba-Vilcanota Valley .oor, Topa Inca decided to place Chincherohigh above,at the edge of the windswept and vast Anta plain. This unusual sitingofaretreatwasprimarily due to complex political andfamily dynamics(Nair 2015), yet, as we shall see, its placement also showed acute environmental awareness. 
Imperial Inca royal estates were made up of disparate landholdings that served distinct functions.These parcelswereoften chosen due to their strategic locations and/or the environ­mental bene.ts provided. Topa Inca’s royal estate included a highly valued salt mine, a keystorage center, sacred outcrops, a lake, rich and diverse farming lands, and a residential and performativecore, Chinchero(Franquemont 1988, 1990;Nair 2003, 2015).Theresidentsand workers of the lands of this estate would have included Inca nobles as well as groups from other regions of the empire, speci.cally yanacona. Itwaswithin thegrand open spaces(pata and pampa)and aroundthemagni.cent structuresof Chinchero in which visiting dignitaries would have sought an audience with the sapa inca (ruler) and whereimportant imperialstate rituals wouldhavetaken place.

Visitors would have traveled from Cuzco, the imperial capital, to the southeast, and the estates of Topa Inca’s father, Pachacuti, in the lowerUrubamba-VilcanotaValley, to the north. Althoughtheroad between Cuzcoand Chinchero was not yet completewhenTopa Inca died, the roads from theUrubamba-VilcanotaValleywere .nished. Hence, visitors to Topa Inca’s estate wouldhave had to makeajourney of several hoursthat ledthem through theUrquillosValley, eitherupabreathtakinglysteepravineor alonga windswept,exposed hillside. When theyreached Chinchero, visitors would have walked along an imperial Inca road that led to an impres­sive terraced hillside, upon which sat majestic buildings (outlined in yellowin Figure2). The carefully paved road and impressive masonry terraces weretheworkofthe pircacamayoc (wall specialists) and mit’a (rotational laborers) who were brought in to build this estate. Chinchero wasbuiltasaplaceforTopa Incatolivewith one ofhisfavoritewives, Chequi Ocllo,and theirson Capac Huari(Nair 2015). Itwas herehespent thelast yearsofhis life and likelydied. 
Chinchero’s architecture was impressive (Nair 2003, 2015). The majority of the walls were constructed with .nely carved polygonal blocks made of limestone (quarried at or near the site), but a small portion of buildings had walls that consistedofexquisitelyworked ashlar blocks carvedfrom andesite (likely quarried from a neighboring mountain). All of these stone structureswouldhavebeen coveredbyimmense, steep roofs, bothgabled and hipped. Thereare no survivingimperialInca roofstoday,but colonial writings describe the visitor’s amazement upon seeing Inca roofs at other sites, which were intricately woven, sometimes vibrantly colored, geometrically cut, and often made up over two thirdsof the heightofabuilding. ImperialInca roofs couldimpresseven as late as thenineteenth century, when George Efrain Squier wrote, “I shall probably shock my classical readers, and be accounted presumptuous, when I venture a comparison of the [Inca] Azangaro dome, in style and effect, with that of the cella of the Temple of Venus, facing the Coliseum, in the Eternal City”(Squier 1877:395).The visitor’s

Chinchero changed dramatically after the arrival of European diseases and the ensuing years of civil war, invasion, and colonization. The population ofTopa Inca’sroyal estate was reduced drastically, and indigenous people from surrounding areas movedintoshareChinchero and its local fertile lands with Topa Inca’s remaining relatives and servants. Spanish land grants quickly surrounded Chinchero, cutting Topa Inca’s residence off from the diversity of lands that once were part of his large royal estate.Although diminishedin numbersandpos­sessions,the population ofChinchero endured. During the Spanish colonial period, Chinchero’s community consistedofInca elites, the descen­dantsofformerservants, and thediverse indige­nous immigrantsfromthe surrounding area and beyond (Nair 2015:171–198). This population created an indigenous town, one that continues today as a center for indigenous communities acrossthe Anta plain.

of functions. The typical cancha had several single-roombuildingsfacingasingle courtyard. A cancha could vary in building number and sometimes have an exterior wall (Nair 2015). At Chinchero, existing cancha units are usually made of two or more single-room, rectangular buildings with an enclosing exterior wall. These walls were particularly prevalent in the colonial townand protectedprivatespacefromthepublic streets. Inside one of these cancha is our case study house(Figure3). Thelong western wall of this house(approximately8 m) also doubled as part of the street façade. One did not enter directly into this house, but instead, one .rst entered the cancha viaadoorwaycoveredbythe carvedlintel. Once inside the central courtyard, one could enterthe casestudy houseviaamodest doorwayonthelong easternwallofthebuilding. 
Thepresentownersofthecasestudy houseare Genovevoand Simeona Sallo.This house, which has been in the Sallo family for many genera­tions,isthe oldeststructureintheir cancha and is partially destroyed. The house once contained afamily hearth that had been used for cooking, resultinginthick, blackened soot covering parts of the interior walls and ceiling. The structure waslaterusedtohouse domestic animals,andits roofwaslefttodecay.Duetoacivic construction projectnextdoor,thenorthgablewalloftheSallo housewastorndownandhalfofthe interiorofthe housewas partially .lledwith dirt.Thisrendered the Sallo house uninhabitable and vulnerable to collapse. In response, all of the long, lower tension beamsinthe roof trusssystem(whichare highlyprized) were severed and removedsothat they can be repurposed elsewhere(Figure4a). Thus,allthetensionforcesexertedbytheroof are now carried solelyby the upper cross beams and thelone survivinggable. That theremainsof the roof surviveunder these conditionsisatestament tothehigh qualityofits constructionand design. The one fortunate aspect of this destruction is that the roof’s construction system is exposed, rendering its surviving materials accessible for study. 
The surviving walls of the Sallo house are approximately 52 cm thick and are built on a stone foundation that is continued with adobe

blocksofvaryingsizes.This house,likemanyof its surroundingbuildings,isbuilt on theremains of an imperialIncabuilding(Nair 2003, 2015). For example, an approximately 8-m segment of thelong westwall liesonanimperialInca foun­dationand linesthemain(imperialInca) street.A roughly3-msegmentoftheshort northwalllies on imperialInca foundations that lie below the now-destroyed gable end of the structure. And halfoftheSallohouse’sfar southeasternhasbeen built upon several coursesofimperialInca stone masonry. The present house has one window (easternwall) and twointeriorniches (southern and northernwalls).Thetruss systemoftheroof consisted of two rafters and two tension beams (upper and lower); the rafters are anchored into the adobe about20 cm below thewalltop. 
Theroof rises1.24m above thewalls.Itisa gabletruss systemwithfourmajorstructural(and twosupporting) components:1.A ridgepole isa long beam that runs horizontally along the roof topfrom onegable end to theother(Figure3). 
2. Rafters arewooden poles that rundiagonally down to the supporting walls(Figure4b).In the Sallo house, large-and medium-sized rafters connect under theridgepole atthe top(where theyare tiedtogether).Bycontrast,atthe bottom therafters areburiedintheadobewalls.TheSallo raftersarelaidoutinan alternating pattern.The large rafters serve solely as roof supports, while the medium rafters also anchor the purlins with roof ties(Figure4c).3. Tension beams arelarge beams that run horizontally across the interior space of thestructure(perpendicular to theridge­pole), connecting opposite sides of the roofs. (A lowertension beamis also calleda ceilingjoist or rafter tie.Anupper tension beamis also called a collar tie or cross tie.) In the Sallo house, long tension beamsoriginally ran between thelowest ends of the rafters, and short tension beams ran between the upper portions of the rafters, about one-third of the way down from the ridgepole. Becausethe long, largetension beamshave been cutand removed,onlytheirends protrudingfrom the adobe walls remain(Figure4a).4. Purlins arewooden membersthat run horizontally along the sides of the roof, between and on top ofthe rafters, providing structural support to the truss system(Figure4b).3 The purlins and raftersin the Sallo houseare visibleinthe interior,creat­ing a ceiling pattern for the house inhabitants.

Outer layers (reed, grass, clay and tile): On the outsideof this structurewas placedaseriesof materialstoprevent wind and rain from entering the house, as well as tokeep heat from escaping (Figures3,4b).These outer layers consisted of bundles of reed (laid vertically) that are today approximately 25 cm in length. On top of the reeds were placed layers of clay, grass, and baked red tiles.Itis unclearin whichorder these materials wereplaced. 


Because we still know little of indigenous roo.ng practices in the colonial period, we cannot say with certainty from what tradition(s) it draws, but this particular roof shares many similaritieswith imperialIncagabled roofs. The Sallo roof(Figure4a) has a slightly less acute angle(35degrees)than imperialInca roofs(40– 60 degrees). This would have increased the

tensile forces on the Sallo roof.However,tensile forces were mitigated by a smaller dead load, because the roof was much thinner (and thus lighter)than an imperialInca roof.The latterwas about 1.2 m (on average) in thickness(largely made up of the outer layers). It is likelythat the Sallo house’s original owners could not afford such a lavish roof layering, which also would need frequent replenishing. 
In the Sallo house, as in imperialInca roofs, purlins were placed on top of, and running horizontally between, the rafters and tied with twine(Figure4b).Inanimperial Inca roof, purlinswouldhavebeen spacedinwide intervals, revealing a .nely made woven rattan mat that would have been placed on top of, and thus clearly visible between, the purlins and rafters (Lee 1988). Thiswovenmatwouldhavegiven the ceilingits decorative .nish,whichis missing in the Sallo house. Instead, purlins are placed very closetogether,givingthe ceilinga different visual character,ofindeterminate origins.Why thematis missinginthe Sallo houseis unclear, butgiven that thematis notastructural element andis primarily decorativein naturemeans that the mat is the one item that could easily be eliminated with no structural consequence. This is another sign that the original patrons of the Sallo house may not have had the extensive accesstolabor and/or materialsthat an imperial Inca patronwouldhave had. The design change would nothave madeadramatic impact on the visual characterofthe Sallo roof.Thisisbecause the builders of the Sallo house, like those of imperialInca architecture, did not use nails,but instead, relied upon tiestofasten each elementof theroofto one another.Inthe Sallo house,asin imperialInca structures,theabundanceof .nely twisted roof ties decorating the ceiling would have also given the interior room its distinctive character(Figure4b). 
Inan imperialInca structure,alathwouldhave beenlaidontopofthecorestructural components of theroof.The lathwasa supportingelement; it was a grid of sparsely woven or thin slats of organic materials to which the outer coverings ofaroof couldbe tied.Inan imperialInca roof this outer coveringwouldhave been composed of multiple layers of thick reed bundles and grasses (Lee 1988), although this may have varied across time and place. For example, a late Inca structureattheYuracRumishrinewas burnedtothegroundbytheSpanish around1572, and it does not appear to have had purlins nor lath,but instead had battens (Bauer et al. 2012). In the Sallo house, this organiclayer is greatly deteriorated, because the outer layer of the roof has not been maintained. Despite beinginastate of decay, large bundles of totora reed, along with evidence of ichu grasses, are visible, as are thatch ties. Layers of reeds and grass that were heldtogether with tieswouldhave been typical of imperialInca roofs. In addition, in the Sallo house, layers ofearth have been added, as has a coveringofredclay tiles. Althoughitis unknown if imperial Inca roofs also had earthen layers, the additionof clay tilesisclearlyaEuropean­derived roo.ng material. 
In summary, there are many similarities between the Sallo house and imperialInca con­structioninthe coreroof structure and interior aesthetic,but thereare also notabledifferences, primarily in the outer roof layers. Theselayers are not structuralbutinstead provideprotection and insulation, as well as help de.ne the outward appearance of the house. What continued from theimperialInca (and perhaps other indigenous) traditions in the Sallo house was the underlying structural system and interior design aesthetic. In particular,the numerous roof tieswouldhave giventhe interiorofthe Sallo houseits distinctive Andean character. This made it very different fromIberian-inspired interiors, whoseroofs and ceilings were constructed with nails.After being introducedby the Spanish, nails,along with clay roof tiles, became common in many colonial periodbuildings.Nails wereeven foundinafew of the early colonial buildings in Vilcabamba, wherethe Inca setuptheirnew capitalafter the Spanish took over Cuzco (Bauer et al. 2015). Despite their rapid spread and usefulness, nails were not used in the Sallo house. Thebuilders continued to useindigenous roof ties.

they built the house and then how they were able to. Signi.cant population decline forced technological changes, and thelossoftraditional lands would have transformed Chinchero and its engagement with the surrounding landscape. Hence,wewonderedhow and forhow long the builders of the Sallo house continued to have accesstoTopa Inca’slands that heldthediversity of resources needed to build a house. To .nd answers to these questions, we collected several samplesfromthe structuralroof elementsandthe building and ran absolute dates on them. 
Todatethe load-bearingwalls upon whichthe roof sits, we needed to know when the adobe blocks were laid and the doorway made. To date the roof, we needed to know when its core elements(i.e.,thetruss system)werelaid.Given that the ridgepole was likely one of the oldest elementsofthe roof,wewantedtodatethisand compareittothewallsto seeifthe roof elements were original or later replacements. Therefore, weextracted threespecimens from theplant col­lectionsand sentthemtotheNSF-ArizonaAMS Laboratory for dating. These dates are listed inTable1 with theirOxCal calibrations using the southern hemisphere calibration (graphed in Supplemental Figure 1). The three wood specimens included one each from: the main ridgepole, thelargewooden linteloverthe door entrance, and an adobe brickinthe house con­struction. As seen from the calibrations, these three dateranges are quite similar: themean age of theridgepoleisAD1723, the lintelAD1766 and thewoodin an adobe brickAD1734. This evidence informs us that the core structural ele­mentsoftheroof were addedwhenthewalls were built,andit placesthe constructionofthebuild­ing between 1720 and 1750, two hundred years after the Spanish invasion. It shows that roof construction techniques found in imperial Inca architectureofthe .fteenth century continuedin Chincherowellintothe eighteenth century. 


The Region and Its Plants 
Armed with the knowledge of how and when this housewasbuilt, we had more questions as tohowChinchero’sresidentswere abletobuild this house. In the eighteenth century, Chinchero wouldhave been relatively isolated, cutofffrom much of its previous imperial Inca territories that couldgrowadiversityof crops. Surrounded by Spanish landholdings, the former Inca royal estate and current indigenous town had accessto onlyalimitedsetof lands thatextended out from Chincheroproper.Toanswerthe questionofhow this housewasbuiltinthemidto late colonial period,weinvestigatedthematerialsofthe Sallo house. Hastorf completed a focused study to identify the trees and grasses used in the roof construction and from whereinthe environment they might have been collected. To do this, Hastorf, Nair,and Andy and Dino Sallo collected samplesofconstructionmaterials from the Sallo house as well as surveyed and collected plant taxa in the environmental zones surrounding the settlement in August 2011. Hastorf and Archila conducted the laboratory processing and made the descriptions and identi.cations of the wood thefollowing year. 
Chinchero hangs over the edge of a narrow, steep ravine of the Urquillos Ravine, draining water from the Anta plains down to join the Urubamba River at 2,870 m asl downslope of Pisacinthe Urubamba-VilcanotaValley, at the communityof Urubamba(Figure1).Thisravine dropsdown rapidlysuch that one canwalkdown inahalfadaytothevalley.oor.The ecological range down this valley changes rapidly from the grassy suni hillsides and the quechua plain through copses of Lambran and Queña trees down to the Vilcanota river side of the valley (Pulgar Vidal 1946). Chinchero is on a south-facing hillslope at the edge of the Anta plain, overlooking thelarge openvalley thatexpands

to the south with small lakes, grasslands, and .elds.This undulatingplain ranges from 2,800 to 3,200 m asl and spans roughly 1,800 km sq.It encompassesmarshy zones along streams and smalllakes, encircledby totora(Schoeno­plectus tatora) as well as a range of grasses, scattered shrubs, and agricultural .elds. The hillsides surrounding Chinchero are scattered with both indigenous and foreign trees. The tree species present suggestthat Chincheroisa moderatelyprotected area in the quechua grow­ing zone (Pulgar Vidal 1946). The indigenous trees we sampled within 500 m of the settle­ment are Colle (Buddlejia coriacea), Quish­wara(Buddlejia longifolia),Tast’a/Chachacoma (Escallonia resinosa), Queña (Polylepis sp.), Capuli(Prunus serotina), Huaramway(Tecoma sambucifolia), and Sauco(Sambucus peruviana). Lambran (Alnus acuminate) was collected by Genovevo Sallo 1000 m down the Urquillos Ravine that empties into the Urubamba River Valley to the north. Cedro (Cedrela sp.) and Tast’a(Escallonia myrtilloides), thought to have been common in the region were not found locallybut weresampled fromtrees growingin theUniversity of CaliforniaBerkeleyBotanical Garden. 
Thelocal treestodaygrowin copsesor around .elds. There used to be forests in the region before the European arrival, when there was deforestationinarelativelyshort periodoftime. Much of this deforestation was architecturally driven, due to the Spanish need for trees to build two-story houses and toburn limestone to extract limefor stucco. The nearby agricultural .elds today yield the traditional crops of this region: maize(Zea mays),quinoa(Chenopodium quinoa), potatoes (Solanum tuberosum), oca (Oxalis tuberosa)and tarwi(Lupinus meyenii).

Wood Identi.cation 
Methods 
To identifythewoodusedinthe houseroof,we .rst created a type collection of key common local tree species by making thin sections and applying theInternational Association ofWood Anatomists (IAWA)methods of description, also seen in Insidewood(2004;Wheeler 2011).We cut themodern uncharredwood into4by4 cm fragments and soaked them in water for at least24hours. Once softened, we then mounted each block in a manual sledge microtome in the McCown Archaeobotany Laboratory at the University of California Berkeley. The block then was sliced in 0.25-micron slices on three orientations of wood—tangential, radial, and transverse sections. Once cut, sections were mounted and viewed on theBX51microscopeof the McCown Archaeobotany Laboratory using MicroSuite software to photograph the wood images.The sections were further viewed on the Zeiss Microscope Axio Imager of the Tropical Palaeoecology laboratory at the Universidad de LosAndesin Bogotátocreatethe .nal descrip­tions and identi.cations. 
Results: Identifying House Construction Materials 
We made descriptions and three orientation images for each of ten locally collected Chinchero wood taxa with which to compara­tively identify the roof wood: Sambucus peru­viana, Buddleja longifolia, Buddleja coriacea, Escallonia resinosa, Escallonia myrtilloides, Alnus acuminata, Polylepis sp., Prunus serotina, Cedrela sp., and Tecoma sambucifolia.Thethree modern taxa that identi.ed the three roof wood specimens arepresentedinSupplemental Figures 2–4 for comparison. 
With these type collections and tree habitat data, we thin sectioned wood fragments of the ridgepole, rafter, and purlin to identifythem and fromwhereinthe environment theycouldhave been harvested. Our identi.cations were based upon microscope features identi.edin thewood thin sections of the samples, comparing these to the thin section images of the wood type collection, collected in Peru, in addition to the identi.ed images from the Inside Wood online database.

Grass. Figure8bshows thethatchof Sallo house. Figure8cdisplays another late colonial roof that is better preserved. This thatch is composedoflocal grassesfromtheregion;much of the sloped landscape is covered in grass today.The indigenous grassusedisoften Festuca ichu (kusiniwa, oroconiwa). The roof twine (Figure4c)wasalsomadeof this grass,several strandsof twistedgrass, further twistedtomake asturdytwine. Thus,the most distinctiveaspect of the Sallo house ceiling andacoreelement that thebuildersmaintained despite theintroduction of European style nails, was harvested from a local landscape(Figure2).Consequently,wesee howthe eighteenth-centurybuildersofthe Sallo house chose a range of roof materials from the local region and used indigenous technology. 
This study of materials used for the eighteenth-century roof in Chinchero is partic­ularly remarkablewhen we compareit with the timber materialsthat imperialIncabuildersare believed to have used. Santiago Agurto Calvo, in his book on Inca construction methods, listed the woods that the Inca likely used in roof construction(Agurto Calvo 1987:193–198).Our studies reveal similar materials chosen for roof construction. Lambran(Alnus)was a common structural wood used in imperial Inca roofs and was also used in the eighteenth-century Sallo house as its ridgepole. Agurto Calvo gives the scienti.c name as Alnus jorullensis, a related species (1987:196). Tast’a was used by the Inca and in the Sallo house for some of the purlins. Agurto Calvo lists this being locally called Chachacomo (1987:196). The imperial Inca used Quishwara (Buddlejia)in their roofs. In the Sallo house, Quishwara was used for some of the purlins. Agurto Calvo lists the scienti.c name as Buddleta Incana (1987:196). 
Material and Environment Summary 
The construction style and components of the Sallo housedisplayhowthe residents continued their building tradition from imperial Inca rule in the .fteenth century through Spanish colo­nization into the eighteenth century, revealing enduring engagement with and knowledge of the resources within theirlandscape.

(b) Close-up of the broken end of the Sallo roof. Note the projecting purlin, with perpendicular laid thatch bundled. Also evident are layers of earth and a layer of clay tiles. On top, the remnants of the ridge pole protrude. (c) Colonial period roof in Chinchero, revealing the practice of adding and embedding (and thus making invisible) clay roof tiles. The result is a roof with the added protection of the clay tiles, retaining the appearance of a traditional highland Andean-style thatch roof (with the exception of tiles above the thatched ridge pole). (Color online) 
rafters, purlins, reeds and grasswerelocal,mak­ing this eighteenth-century structure entirely of local origin, harvested exclusively from Topa Inca’s former local lands. Hence, the dramatic land grab undertaken by the Spanish did not cut Chinchero residents off from the critical microclimates’ resources in which they could harvest roof construction materials. Access to these diverse environments enabled residents to continue making traditional roofs with only minor modi.cations. 


Design and Construction Choice 
When we could determine that the house was built in the mid to late colonial period, and that its roof was made in a similar way as imperial Inca roofsby its indigenous residents, and that thebuilders had accesstoa limitedbut suf.cient set of environmental zones that grew the needed roof supplies, we could ask, why?Itis one thing to have the necessary material,but it is another to choose to continue making architecture in a similar fashion over centuries, especially in a time of radical upheaval and change. Initially, we found this date for the roof puzzling. We had assumed based on the continuity, that the roof constructionwas anexampleofavery early colonial context, not one thatwasmorethan two hundred years after the Spanish invasion. 
This house highlights key issues regarding the context in which this roof was made (and maintained).First,the roof revealsa longstand­ing, continuous handing down of environmental and architectural knowledge from generation to generationoverseveral centuries.Giventhe vio­lence, diseases, and forced change that marked indigenous communitiesinthe Andes duringthis time, the determined choice to continuously pass thisknowledgedowneach generationis notable.

Second, this building reveals many of the builders’ choices, but we need to know more about what they were choosing between. To begin with, indigenous men were often forced tobuild forthe Spanish,who brought with them their own architectural traditions (design, con­struction, and materials).In addition, Chinchero residents were ethnically diverse, tracing their ancestrytoInca,Ayarmaca,and other indigenous groups, each with their own roof-making tradi-tions.Hence, Chinchero’sresidentswouldhave been exposed to the imperial Inca architecture that de.ned the armature of Chinchero, but also toadiversity of indigenous and European architectural traditions.Tofully understand the choices that thebuildersofthe Sallo house had, we need to know more about the other roof-making practices that the residents could have beenfamiliarwith.Hence, thisisareminder that more studiesneedtobedoneon ancientandearly modernroof-making practices acrossthe Andes (and Amazonia). 
Third,tobegintounderstandwhythebuilders ofthis housemayhavechosentobuildtheroofin this manner,wehavetolookto twentieth-century ethnographies forclues, namely, theimportance that some twentieth-centuryindigenous patrons place on the making and remaking of roofs as a deeplymeaningful ritual that tiestheirfamily to their community,local environment, and the sacred (Abercrombie 1998;Arnold1991). Thus, the act of making (and remaking) a roof in the eighteenth century may have involved a host of players whose speci.c acts over several days of construction, were understood as imbuing the house, its inhabitants, and the local landscape withasacred blessing and connectiontothe land and theirkin past and present. 
Finally,wehavetoconsider the timeinwhich this house was built, the mid-1700s. Though it is possible that this house simply was made withoutovert purpose,giventhe tensions among indigenous people and thoseofIberian descent, itis likelythisroofwasinherently charged with meaning, whether its occupants meant it to be or not.Around this time, revolts and rebellions became more frequent, and Spanish authorities becomeincreasingly concerned that indigenous practices were a threat to the Spanish empire. Thus,whether designed to or not,thisInca-(or indigenous-) styleroofover timemayhave been considered an act of de.ance in its process of making, materials, ceremony, its meaning, and aesthetic declaration. 


Conclusions 
This case study of a deteriorating eighteenth-century house in Chinchero, Peru allows us to gain insights into local environmental prac­tices from the imperial Inca period through the Spanish occupation, as seen through roof construction. It shows the choices made as well as thebuilders’ training. Theychoseto construct a single space, rectangular house and woven, thatched, gabled roof, with a soft pitch and, eventually, clay tiles. Our study reveals that roof-making (and relatedenvironmental) knowl­edgewas being passeddowninthisindigenous community. The local landscape and the tradi­tional plants served as valued resources for roof construction, revealing the ecological resource availability and choices of the local house builders. 
The choices that the Sallo house builders made were likely bothpragmatic and meaning­ful. Theyrejected theuseof costly nailsinfavor of a time-consuming practice of making and usinggrass twine. Although this mayhave been in.uenced by .nancial choices, ethnographic studies have shown that the stages and mate­rials of traditional thatch rebuilding are deeply meaningful,reiterate ayni (reciprocity)practices within the community, and encourage engage­ment with the landscape. Thus, the process of making the Sallo thatch roofwaslikelyasimpor­tant as its material elements and .nal outcome. In terms of the latter, the result was an interior space that hadadistinctiveindigenous aesthetic character. Subtle differences from the imperial Inca roof repertoireareevident;forexample, the Sallo housebuilders optedto createastouter roof withamuch thinner layerof thatch. Despite these changes,the roofof the Sallo houseexpresseda continuing relationship with the land and with Inca (Andean) roo.ng traditions, (despite the violence and dispossession of local lands during Spanish colonization), as well as clearly visu­alized and performed indigenous identity and practices.

The architect Vince Lee referred to roofs as “the lost half of Inca architecture,” to call attention to the vital role those roofs played in Incadesignandtheimportanceof studyingthem (Lee 1988).We followhis lead with the title of our paper, to call attention to the importance of Andean roofs in general. We hope that more studies will be conducted in other parts of the Andes on roof design and construction prac­tices. It is only with many more case studies, past and present, that we can gain a broader understanding of the role that roofs played in de.ning identity for indigenous households, their connection to indigenous (and imported) traditions, and their relationship to local land­scapesin theformofknowledge and continuing practices.
