AT MINANHA, BELIZE, USING THE STABLE ISOTOPES OF CARBON 
AND NITROGEN

We present the results of stable carbon and nitrogen isotope analyses of bone collagen and bone bioapatite from the ancient Maya center of Minanha, Belize (ca. 100 B.C. to A.D. 1260). The purpose of this research was to reconstruct diet and investigate the in.uence of sociopolitical and environmental factors. Overall, diet was relatively stable over time, with maize being a staple in all periods. Maize consumption reached its peak in the transitional Early to Middle Classic periods and decreased over time. When isotope data from dry periods were compared to normal periods, there were no signi.cant differences, although comparisons of isotope data by burial location and type suggest that the apical or ruling elite consumed a more diverse diet, with more animal protein, relative to the lesser elites. The temporal variability in maize consumption seems best explained by sociopolitical factors documented at Minanha and within the Vaca Plateau. This study demonstrates the resilience of ancient subsistence practices in the face of climatic instability and highlights the impact that social and political factors can have on diet and subsistence economy. 
Este trabajo presenta los resultados del análisis de isótopos estables de carbono y nitrógeno de colágeno y bioapatita óseos del antiguo centro maya de Minanha, Belice (aprox. 100 a.C. hasta 1260 d.C.). El propósito de esta investigación fue reconstruir la dieta de la población e investigar la in.uencia de factores sociopolíticos y ambientales. En general, la dieta fue relativamente estable a través del tiempo. El consumo de maíz alcanzó su pico durante la transición entre el Clásico Temprano y el Clásico Medio y disminuyó con el tiempo; sin embargo, se mantuvo como alimento básico a lo largo de la historia del asentamiento. No se registraron diferencias signi.cativas entre los datos de isótopos de períodos secos y normales. Comparaciones de los datos de isótopos con base en la ubicación y el tipo de entierro sugieren que los individuos pertenecientes a las altas élites consumieron una dieta más diversa y con más proteínas de origen animal que las élites menores. La variabilidad temporal en el consumo de maíz parece estar relacionada con factores sociopolíticos documentados en Minanha y en la Meseta de Vaca. Este estudio demuestra la capacidad de recuperación de las antiguas prácticas de subsistencia frente a la inestabilidad climática y destaca el impacto que pueden tener los factores sociales y políticos sobre la dieta y la economía de subsistencia. 
D
eclining natural resources and the desta­bilization of the geopolitical environ­ment caused by climate instability and environmental change are two of the biggest challenges faced by modern human populations (Barnett 2009). 
Although 
the 
current 
pace 
and 
magnitude of climate change are unique to mod­ern populations, climatic instability has been a persistent challenge since our earliest human ancestors dispersed across the landscape. Over time, humans have adapted both biologically and culturally to environmental pressures and challenges. Studying these adaptations helps us better understand the context in which human behaviors evolved. Thinking of adaptation as capacity informs us of the resilience of speci.c communities and community segments when confronted by signi.cant socioecological per­turbations (Walker and Salt 2012). 
Thus, 
the 
study of past populations can provide a wealth of information relevant to modern society (e.g., Demarest et al. 2004;

Chase, 
et 
al.

Investigations 
of 
how 
climate has changed, the impact of anthropogenic forces on local climate, and the social and politi­cal impact of climate change on past populations can inform our understanding of and response to contemporary climate change (Van de Noort 2011). 

Human diet studies are an excellent way to investigate the impact of climate change on sociopolitical contexts because food is related to and constrained by environmental factors and social dynamics (Gumerman 1997:106–107). 
Chemical analyses of human tissues can be used to infer diet. We report the stable carbon and nitrogen isotopic compositions of human bone. We use these data to reconstruct the paleodiet of the ancient Maya center Minanha, located in the north Vaca Plateau of west-central Belize. Speci.cally, our research is designed to deter­mine how and why diet changed over time. In order to understand the causes of the temporal patterns we identify, we compare the isotope data to paleoenvironmental and archaeological datasets for Minanha and its surrounding region. Our comparisons, although based on small sam­ples, suggest that diet changed over time because of sociopolitical rather than environmental factors. 


Theoretical Principles 
The stable carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios of ancient human tissues can be used to infer diet because the isotopic compositions of plants and animals vary and these differences are passed on to consumers in known and predictable ways (Katzenberg 2008). 
The 
isotopic 
composition 
of 
photosynthetic pathway C4 plants (e.g., maize, sorghum, millet) is distinct from C3 plants (e.g., wheat, rice, root crops, fruits; –16 to –9‰ vs. –34 to –20‰; Deines 1980). 
Nitrogen 
isotope 
ratios 
exhibit a well-documented trophic level effect: d15Ncol increases by approximately 3‰ with each successive step in the food web (Hedges and Reynard 2007). 
Nitrogen 
isotope 
ratios 
also 
dif­
fer between legumes and nonlegumes. Legumes 
15N
are depleted of relative to nonlegumes (Virginia and Delwiche 1982). 
Marine 
organisms 
are enriched in 15N and 13C relative to terrestrial organisms (Schoeninger and DeNiro 1984). 

Controlled feeding studies demonstrate that the stable isotope composition of bone collagen and bioapatite re.ect different aspects of the diet (Schwarcz 2000). 
Collagen 
carbon-isotope 
com­
position (d13Ccol) re.ects the protein component of the diet when protein is suf.ciently available (Ambrose et al. 1997), 
whereas 
structural 
car­
bonate carbon-isotope composition (d13Csc)in bioapatite re.ects the whole diet (lipids, carbo­hydrates, and any proteins left over from collagen maintenance and synthesis; Jim et al. 2004). 
The difference between d13Csc and d13Ccol (i.e., 
13Csc-col) has been used to infer the relative contribution of protein to the diet (i.e., herbivore vs. carnivore; Lee-Thorp et al. 1989). 
Recent 
research has questioned the utility of 13Csc-col for paleodietary reconstructions (Kellner and Schoeninger 2007:1113), 
especially when the diet is mixed and the protein source is unknown (Froehle et al. 2010:2664). 
A 
bivariate 
regression 
model using d13Ccol, d13Csc, and a multivariate analysis of d13Ccol, d13Csc, and the nitrogen isotope composition of collagen (d15Ncol) appear to be more useful for reconstructing paleodiet. 


Site and Sample 
Minanha 
The ancient Maya center of Minanha, located in the north Vaca Plateau of west-central Belize, was the setting for a small city-state in the eighth 
century 
A.D. 
(Figure 
1; 
Iannone 
1999, 
2005). 
The 
remains 
of 
the 
ancient 
community 
are located 520 m above sea level, on top of one of the highest hills in the north Vaca Plateau. Minanha is situated at the nexus of three different ecozones: the Belize River valley to the north, the Mountain Pine Ridge and Macal River to the east, and the Petén Department of Guatemala to the west. 
Archaeological research at Minanha was con­ducted annually from 1998 to 2013 by the Social Archaeology Research Program, directed by Gyles Iannone (Iannone, Chase, et al. 2014:283). 
This extensive research program has produced a detailed cultural sequence from 500 B.C. to 
A.D. 1200 (Iannone, Chase, et al. 2014; 
Schwake 
and Iannone 2010). 
The 
Vaca 
Plateau 
is 
home 
to numerous important Maya centers, including

Caracol, Camp 6, Ixchel, Caledonia, and Caballo. Minanha occupies a strategically important posi­tion on the border of the political territories of two large Maya polities—Naranjo to the northwest and Caracol to the south—so its history was strongly shaped by the con.ict and interaction of these two polities (Iannone, Chase, et al. 2014; 
Schwake 
and 
Iannone 
2016). 
The 
Minanha 
royal court was established in the Late Classic period (A.D. 675–810) and possessed several attributes suggesting that the ruling elite modeled their architecture and practices on the nearby center of Caracol. This and the speed of building suggest nonlocal participation in its construction (Iannone 2005:31–32). 

The presence of individuals who consumed a distinct, nonlocal diet could confound our investigation of chronological trends. Sutinen (2014) 
conducted 
a 
strontium 
isotope 
analysis 
of 
20 individuals from Minanha in order to identify such foreigners. Five had strontium isotope ratios outside the local range and were identi.ed as nonlocal. All nonlocal individuals have similar strontium isotope ratios consistent with sites in the Belize River valley, elsewhere in the Vaca Plateau, or northern Yucatán (Sutinen 2014:95). 
Nonlocals were identi.ed in most time periods and in all grave types. Ritual burials (i.e., caches) as well as burials with multiple individuals con­tained local and nonlocal individuals. Of the 20 individuals 
sampled 
by 
Sutinen 
(2014), 
.ve 
were 
also 
included 
in 
Stronge’s 
(2012) 
analysis 
of 
sta­
ble carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios. Of these .ve overlapping individuals, four are classi.ed as local and one as nonlocal based on strontium isotope ratios. The isotope data for the four locals show substantial variability: d13Ccol values vary from -13.5 to -9.8‰ (mean =-11.3 ±1.6‰) and d15Ncol varies from +8.0 to +10.7‰ (mean =+9.1 ± 1.1‰). The one nonlocal individ­ual falls within these ranges: -12.6‰ (d13Ccol) and +9.5‰ (d15Ncol). Freiwald’s (2011:307– 
309) research demonstrates that for the Belize River valley, long-distance migration was rare and most mobility was on a regional level. It is unlikely that sites separated by short distances within the same region are in vastly different ecozones with distinct, non-overlapping carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios. For this reason, the presence of nonlocal individuals is an unlikely explanation for the dietary diversity observed at Minanha. 
The Vaca Plateau is characterized by subtropi­cal to tropical rainforest and a rugged topography of dry karst valleys and residual limestone hills. The dry valleys have deep soil deposits and dense vegetation, while the hills have shallower soils and sparser vegetation (Iannone et al. 2010; 
Reeder et al. 1996). 
The 
climate 
is 
somewhat 
unpredictable, with irregular recurring cycles of normal rainfall and dry periods. Highly fertile Rendoll soils are irregularly distributed across the landscape. Because of the karstic landscape and the depth of the water table, meteoric rainfall was the primary source of water for the inhab­itants of Minanha (Reeder et al. 1996). 
This 
is supported by the archaeological evidence of a complex system of water management that included a large and small reservoir and natural springs and basins (Macrae and Iannone 2011; 
Primrose 2003). 
The 
land 
around 
Minanha 
was 
intensively cultivated using agricultural terraces (McCane et al. 2010; 
Macrae 
and 
Iannone 
2011). 
There is evidence that the water management system and agricultural terraces were expanded in response to dry periods during the occupation of Minanha (Iannone, Chase, et al. 2014:291). 

Sample 
The ancient Maya were a highly strati.ed society and although there is debate around the num­ber, type, and relationships among social strata (Chase 1992), 
researchers 
agree 
that 
it 
is 
often 
possible to identify social status using archae­ological data. Schwake (2008:303) 
identi.ed 
three social strata at Minanha using settlement location, degree of architectural elaboration, and associated portable material items. Generally, the apical elite at Minanha were interred in the site epicenter (i.e., the main agglomeration of monu­mental architecture that served as the ritual, eco­nomic, political, and royal-residential hub of the polity), the lesser elites in the site core (i.e., the settlement zone immediately surrounding the epicentral royal court complex), and the commoners in the periphery. Nonetheless, it is possible that some burials are exceptions to this pattern. 
Thirty-three individuals from the Minanha epicenter (n = 14), site core (n = 16), and

periphery (n = 3) were sampled for stable carbon and nitrogen isotope analysis (Stronge 2012:22– 
25; summarized in Table 
1). 
The 
age 
at 
death 
has been determined for 25 individuals, and the sex of .ve is known (Schwake 2008; 
Snetsinger 
2013). 
Radiocarbon 
dates 
were 
determined 
for 
32 
of 
the 
33 
individuals 
(Table 
2); 
the 
date 
of 
the remaining individual is based on ceramic associations. These data con.rm that the sample spans all periods of occupation (speci.cally, cal 100 B.C. to A.D. 1260). The Minanha sam­ple size is similar to other single-site isotope studies throughout Mesoamerica (e.g., Coyston et al. 1999;Freiwald 
2011; 
Rand 
et 
al. 
2015; 
Somerville et al. 2016; 
White 
and 
Schwarcz 
1989; 
White 
et 
al. 
2001; 
Williams 
et 
al. 
2009), 
although it is important to recognize that small samples may not always be representative of the larger population. 


Methods 
All isotopic results are reported in d-notation, relative to international standards: VPDB for carbon and AIR for nitrogen. Bone collagen was isolated using the whole bone method (Sealy et al. 2014) 
followed 
by 
a 
20-hour 
soak 
in 
1 
percent NaOH (Ambrose 1990; 
see 
also 
Stronge 
2012:72–74). 
Bone 
collagen 
samples 
were 
ana­
lyzed using the continuous .ow mode of the Thermo Fisher Deltaplus XL isotope ratio mass spectrometer (IRMS) interfaced with a Costech Elemental Analyzer (ECS 4010). A two-point calibration curve based on NBS-22 and IAEA­CH-6 was used to calibrate d13Ccol to VPDB. Two-point calibration of d15Ncol to AIR was accomplished using USGS-40 and USGS-41. Precision and accuracy of the calibration curves were evaluated using the laboratory keratin stan­dard (MP Biomedicals Inc., Cat. No. 90211, Lot No. 9966H). The preservation of bone collagen was assessed using collagen yield, C/N ratio, and carbon and nitrogen concentrations following standard criteria (Ambrose 1990; 
Van 
Klinken 
1999). 

Bone bioapatite was isolated using a four-hour treatment in 0.1M acetic acid (Garvie-Lok et al. 2004:774; 
Stronge 
2012:74–75). 
The 
d13Csc of bone bioapatite samples was analyzed by reaction with orthophosphoric acid at 90°Cusing a Micromass Multiprep autosampling device con.gured for sealed vessel reaction conditions coupled with a VG Optima IRMS operated in dual-inlet mode (Metcalfe et al. 2009). 
Two-point 
calibration of d13Csc to VPDB was accomplished using NBS-19 and the laboratory standard cal­cite Suprapur. Precision and accuracy of this calibration curve was evaluated using NBS-18 and the laboratory standard calcite WS-1. The preservation of bone bioapatite was assessed using the crystallinity index (Garvie-Lok et al. 2004:768). 

Individuals sampled for this research were placed into different temporal categories that form the basis of the chronological comparisons (Table 
1). 
Chronology 
was determined using three criteria: (1) evaluation of radiocarbon data including the intercept, 2-sigma dates, and prob­abilities associated with multiple dates (using Calib 7.1); (2) stratigraphy; and (3) ceramic seriation. Most individuals were assigned to nonoverlapping temporal categories, but data for six individuals overlapped two time periods: the end of the Early Classic (A.D. 250–550) and beginning of the Middle Classic (A.D. 550–675). These individuals were placed into a temporal category identi.ed as transitional Early Classic to 
Middle 
Classic 
(Table 
1). 

The climatic reconstruction for the north Vaca Plateau is based on a new multiproxy analy­sis of the Macal Chasm speleothem, collected approximately 10 km southwest of Minanha (Akers et al. 2016; 
an 
earlier 
and 
much 
less 
detailed analysis was reported in Webster et al. 2007). 
The 
reanalysis 
of 
this 
speleothem 
yields 
a 
chronology of environmental .uctuations from 5250 cal B.P. to the current day (Akers et al. 2016:275). 
This 
spans 
the 
entire 
ancient 
occu­
pation of Minanha. The environmental record was based on the following sources of data: 11 new U-Th dates, 660 isotope (d18O and d13C) samples (with intervals ranging from 0.25 mm to 5 mm), ultraviolet-stimulated luminescence (UVL) intensity, and petrographic examination (Akers et al. 2016:274). 
Akers 
and 
colleagues 
(2016:280–281) 
compared 
the 
Macal 
Chasm 
data to other local paleoclimate records from southern Belize (Kennett et al. 2012) 
and 
Mex­
ico (Hodell et al. 2005; 
Medina-Elizalde 
et 
al. 
2010;

ratios for individuals dated to an MDE were com­pared with individuals dating to non-MDE times. Additionally, the isotope ratios of individuals dating to the Late to Terminal Classic MDE were compared to the isotope ratios of individuals dating 
to 
the 
Early

MDE 
(Figure

The radiocarbon dates for individuals and MDEs lack precision, so we did not attempt .ne-grained comparisons of climate or isotope data using the temporal categories of the other analyses. 
The construction sequence of Minanha is related to a variety of events that have been identi.ed from archaeological data collected at Minanha and other sites within the region (Ian­none et al. 2010; 
Iannone, 
Chase, 
et 
al. 
2014). 
The 
Early and Middle Classic are characterized by a gradual intensi.cation of processes, including agricultural intensi.cation, population growth, and increased social strati.cation, rather than a stark contrast of events, such as abandon­ment, war, the destruction of monuments, or the creation of a new royal center (Iannone et al. 2010; 
Longstaffe 
and 
Iannone 
2011; 
Macrae 
and 
Iannone 2011). 
For 
this 
reason, 
our 
comparison 
of isotope data considers the isotope data from the Early Classic, transitional Early to Middle Classic, and Middle Classic periods together. 
Because the sample sizes are small and unequal, we analyzed the data using nonparamet­ric statistics. Groups with only a single individual were excluded from these analyses. The accepted p value for statistical signi.cance was =0.05; nonetheless, when multiple pairwise compar­isons were made, the p value was adjusted using the Bonferroni correction (e.g., 0.05/number of comparisons). We used the regression-based model for dietary reconstruction developed by Kellner 
and 
Schoeninger 
(2007) 
to 
infer the sources of dietary protein and the ratio of C3 to C4 foods in the whole diet. To better understand the protein sources in the Minanha diet (in particular, to differentiate between marine and C4 protein), we 
employed 
Froehle 
and 
colleagues’ 
(2012) 
multivariate diet reconstruction model. Froehle and 
colleagues 
(2012:357) 
identi.ed 
.ve 
clusters 
associated with speci.c diets and then used linear discriminant function analysis to generate two discriminant functions (F1 and F2) that can be used to assign individuals to a cluster based on d13Ccol, d13Csc, and d15Ncol. The .rst function (Carbon: F1 =0.322* d13Csc +0.727 * d13Ccol +0.219 * d15Ncol +9.354) is most in.uenced by the carbon-isotope variables; as carbon isotope ratios decrease, F1 decreases. In contrast, the nitrogen variable exerts its strongest effect on the second function (Nitrogen: F2 =-0.393* d13Csc 
+ 0.133 * d13Ccol + 0.622 * d15Ncol - 8.703); as nitrogen isotope ratios decrease, F2 decreases. We calculated Minanha-speci.c F1 and F2 val­ues and used them to assign individuals to the .ve dietary clusters identi.ed by Froehle and colleagues 
(2012:357). 
We 
also 
used 
Minanha­
speci.c F1 and F2 values to better understand dietary patterns over time (e.g., increased maize consumption over time is evident as an increase in F1 over time). 


Results 
Sample Integrity, Accuracy, and Precision 
Thirty-three samples were prepared for stable isotope analysis. During collagen isolation, nine samples dissolved; the remaining 24 samples did not show evidence of contamination or alteration (Supplemental Table 1; Stronge 2012:81–82). 
All 33 samples survived bioapatite preparation. The preservation of bioapatite was assessed for a subset of 10 individuals, four of whom had an FTIR crystallinity index outside the acceptable range and were removed from further consid­eration (shown in bold in Supplemental Table 1; Stronge 2012:82–85). 
The 
.nal 
bone 
colla­
gen and bone bioapatite datasets included 24 and 29 individuals, respectively. Twenty-three individuals yielded both collagen and bioapatite data (i.e., 13Csc-col; Supplemental Table 1). Reproducibility based on three duplicate anal­yses of samples was ±0.04‰ for d13Ccol and ±0.08‰ for d15Ncol. Reproducibility based on three duplicate analyses of bone bioapatite was ±0.03‰ for d13Csc. Accuracy of the isotopic data was better than 0.2‰ for d13C(n =5) and 0.4‰ for d15N(n =4), based on standards not included in the calibration curves. 
Isotope Data Summary 
The mean d13Ccol for the sample population was -10.9 ± 1.7‰ (n = 24) with a range of -14.1 to -8.2‰. The mean d15Ncol was +9.0 ±0.8‰

(n = 24) with a range of +7.2 to +10.7‰.The mean d13Csc was -5.0 ± 1.6‰ (n = 29) with a range of -7.6 to -2.4‰. The mean 13Csc-col was 5.8 ±1.7‰ (n = 23) with a range of 2.1 to 9.0‰. There were no statistically signi.cant differences between individuals buried in the epicenter versus the site core, except for d13Csc (Supplemental Table 2). This means that indi­viduals buried in the epicenter were signi.cantly depleted of 13C relative to individuals buried in the site core. Ideally, in subsequent tests, d13Csc would have been compared separately for the epicenter and site core, but the sample sizes were too small to permit such statistical analysis of the data. Sex and age data were available for some individuals but not others, prohibiting a comparison of isotope ratios across these categories. 
A total of six burial types, signifying different degrees of complexity and labor investment, were identi.ed at Minanha (Snetsinger 2013). 
There are statistically signi.cant differences in d13Csc, 13Csc-col, and F2 among burial types (Supplemental Table 3). Post hoc comparisons using Dunn’s test demonstrate that the d13Csc of chultun burials (bodies placed in excavated cisterns) was depleted of 13C and F2 was lower relative to all other burials, with the difference in d13Csc and F2 between chultun and crypt or elaborate burials being statistically signi.cant (respectively, z = 2.982, p = 0.003, Bonferroni corrected p = 0.003; and z = 3.113, p = 0.002, Bonferroni corrected p = 0.005). Post hoc comparisons using Dunn’s test demonstrate that 
13Csc-col for human remains in cache contexts is much larger relative to other burials, with the difference in 13Csc-col between cist and cache offerings being statistically signi.cant (z = 2.823; p = 0.005; Bonferroni corrected p = 0.005). 
There are statistically signi.cant differences in d13Ccol and F1 over time (Supplemental Table 4). Post hoc comparisons using Dunn’s test demonstrate that d13Ccol and F1 in the transitional Early to Middle Classic sample is enriched in 13C and has a higher F1 value relative to all other time periods. The difference in d13Ccol and F1 between the transitional Early to Middle Classic and the Early Postclassic is statistically signi.cant (respectively, z = 3.468, p = 0.001, 
Bonferroni p = 0.005; and z = 3.193, p = 0.001, Bonferroni p = 0.005). With respect to climate (e.g., MDEs vs. normal climate), when individuals are grouped and compared there are no statistically signi.cant differences in isotope ratios or discriminant functions (Supplemental Table 5). Interestingly, when the isotope data for the Terminal Classic MDE is compared to the Early Postclassic MDE, there are statistically signi.cant differences in d13Ccol and F1 (Supple­mental Table 5). 
When the pooled Early/transitional/Middle Classic isotope data are compared to the other temporal categories, there is a statistically sig­ni.cant difference in d13Ccol (Supplemental Table 6). Post hoc comparisons using Dunn’s test demonstrate that d13Ccol in the pooled Early/transitional/Middle Classic is enriched 
13C
in relative to all other time periods. The difference in d13Ccol between the pooled Early/transitional/Middle Classic and the Early Postclassic is statistically signi.cant (z = 2.742; p = 0.006; Bonferroni corrected p = 0.008). 


Discussion 
Population-Level Diet at Minanha 
Figure 
3 
shows the d13Ccol and d15Ncol values of a variety of plants and animals that characterize the food web in Belize. The d13Ccol from Minanha are consistent with a mixed diet including both C3 and C4 plants and lower-level terrestrial herbi­vores or omnivores (such as deer, rabbit, agouti, peccary, and paca) that consume these plants. The statistical analyses of the isotope data similarly indicate a mixed diet, with the majority derived from C4 energy 
sources 
(Figure 
4a, 
b); 
the 
mul­
tivariate model indicates that the population at Minanha was consuming a 3:7 C3:C4 diet, with most of the diet coming from C4 plant proteins or 
animals 
that 
consume 
such 
plants 
(Figure 
4a). 
It should be stressed that the dietary clusters of the multivariate model are not exact representa­tions of dietary input and should be viewed as general dietary types. Moreover, because there is considerable variation within each cluster, not all individuals in a given cluster will have precisely the same diet. Marine protein was not a 
component 
of 
the 
Minanha 
diet 
(Figure 
4a).

Figure 3. Maya subarea isotope food web (adapted from Williams et al. 2009). 
The

square 
represents 
mean 
collagen isotope data from Minanha. The gray square represents diet (i.e., bone collagen d 13Cand d13Nare adjusted by -5‰ and -3‰ respectively to account for fractionation [reviewed in Katzenberg 2008]). 
Isotope 
data 
for 
both 
collagen and diet are provided in recognition of the fact that there is some uncertainty about the actual fractionation between diet and tissue (e.g., Vanderklift and Ponsard 2003). 

The Early Classic to Terminal Classic diet at Minanha, particularly maize consumption and reliance on terrestrial proteins, is consistent with the diet of many other Maya sites (e.g., Chase et al. 2001 
[Caracol]; Gerry and Krueger 1997 
[Baking Pot, Barton Ramie, Holmul, Uaxactun]; Scherer et al. 2007 
[Piedras Negras]; Whittington and Reed 1997 
[Copan]; Wright 1994 
[Altar de Sacri.cios, Seibal, Dos Pilas, Aguateca, Itzan]; Wright 2003 
[Tikal]). 
The fact that isotope ratios vary among burial locations and burial types (Supplemental Tables 2 and 3) is intriguing, but the small size of the commoner sample does not permit it to be compared with the elite sample. Furthermore, there are insuf.cient data to determine if gender played a role in dietary choice or access. Given that the isotopic data that show signi.cant dif­ferences across burial type and location (d13Csc, 
13Csc-col, and F2) are not the same as those that show signi.cant chronological differences (d13Ccol and F1), it is unlikely that variability among burial types and locations are due to chronological changes in diet. Put another way, maize was the dietary staple regardless of status or period. Nonetheless, the isotope ratios of the apical elite at Minanha are consistent with a diet containing relatively more C3 plants, protein, and animals from higher trophic levels than is sug­gested for the diet of the lesser elites (Supplemen­tal Tables 2 and 3). Preliminary faunal analysis at Minanha suggests that elite feasts were com­posed of a variety of animal resources (Stanchly et al. 2008) 
and 
were 
likely 
complemented 
by 
a variety of plant resources (e.g., maize, beans, squash, tubers). Similar differences in isotope ratios have been documented among social strata at other Maya sites from various time periods (Chase et al. 2001; 
Coyston 
et 
al. 
1999;Emery 
2002; 
Scherer 
et 
al.

White 
et 
al. 
1993; 
White 
et al. 2001; 
Whittington 
and 
Reed 
1997). 
In 
particular, elite individuals generally had access to a more varied diet containing more rare foods than nonelites (e.g., Sharpe and Emery 2015). 

Temporal Changes in Diet 
Recent research in the southern Maya lowlands demonstrates that while elite diet decreased in maize consumption and increased in animal protein over the Classic period, commoner diet was relatively constant (Somerville et al. 2013). 
Commoners had access to local-level resources (e.g., forests, house gardens, milpas), so they were buffered from larger economic, political, and environmental factors that in.uenced the subsistence strategies used by the elite. As for other sites in the Maya lowlands (Somerville et al. 2013), 
the 
isotope 
ratios 
of 
Minanha 
elites 
suggest a similar change over time, but the sample size for Minanha is small. The signi.cant decrease in d13Ccol and F1 over time is consistent

with decreasing consumption of C4 resources (e.g., maize or C4-fed animals). Although the overall diet (d13Csc), amount of animal protein (F2, 13Csc-col), and trophic position (d15Ncol) did .uctuate over time, there is no evidence for a dramatic shift or alteration in diet that can be tied to famine or a failure of the agricultural system. 
The period of highest maize consumption (transitional Early to Middle Classic) predates the rise of the Minanha kingdom but corresponds with signi.cant growth of the local population and concomitant expansion of agricultural terrace construction (Supplemental Table 6; Iannone, Chase, et al. 2014). 
Similarly, 
the nearby site of Caracol reached its apogee of power during this time, and Calakmul expanded its hegemony through warfare, conquest, and alliances (Dahlin and Chase 2014:153). 
In contrast, the agricultural productivity at nearby Ixchel decreased, the ritual activity at the Chechem Ha Cave (a site of ritual activity near Minanha) increased (Iannone, Chase, et al. 2014), 
and

consumption at Minanha declined after the transitional Early to Middle Classic, coinciding with the emergence of the royal court, it remained relatively high in the Late and Terminal Classic but dropped during the Postclassic period (Figure 
4; 
Supplemental 
Table 
4). 

The major dry event of the Late to Terminal Classic (cal A.D. 750–875) was associated with a serious decline at Ixchel, the practice of a drought cult at Chechem Ha Cave, and changes to the sociopolitical landscape of the Vaca Plateau, such as power sharing (Iannone, Chase, et al. 2014:291–292). 
In 
contrast, 
there 
are 
examples 
from other regions of success in the face of drought (e.g., northeastern Yucatán [Hodell et al. 2007:234–235] 
and 
the 
site 
of 
Cantona, 
Mex­
ico [Bhattacharya et al. 2015:1695]). 
There 
is 
evidence for unrest at Minanha and Caracol toward the end of the Late Classic. The royal residential courtyard at Minanha was burned ca. A.D. 775 and Caracol went to war against Ucanal and B’ital in A.D. 800 (Iannone, Chase, et al. 2014:291–292). 
These 
events 
culminated 
in 
the abandonment of the royal court at Minanha during the Terminal Classic. 
The Early Postclassic follows the fall of the Minanha kingdom; it is marked by a decrease in agricultural productivity and diminished agricul­tural centralization (Iannone, Prufer, and Chase 2014; 
Macrae 
and Iannone 2011). 
The 
Early 
Postclassic also coincides with an MDE (cal 
A.D. 1000–1175). The changes in agricultural practices appear to have in.uenced diet; the Post-classic isotope ratios are indicative of the lowest maize consumption (aside from the Preclassic, see below) in the history of the site. The decrease in maize consumption between the Terminal Classic and Postclassic periods is documented at various sites throughout the Maya subarea (e.g., Coyston et al. 1999; 
Emery 
and 
Thornton 
2008;

has 
not 
been universally observed (e.g., Coyston et al. 1999; 
Emery 
et 
al. 
2000; 
Scherer 
et 
al. 
2007; 
White and Schwarcz 1989; 
White 
et 
al. 
2001; 
Wright 2006). 

The Terminal Classic fall of the Minanha kingdom primarily affected the two extremes of society: the relatively new and presumably non­local ruling elites of the eighth-century Minanha kingdom, and the lower-status commoners who did not control land and either abandoned the community or were forced out (Iannone, Chase, et al. 2014; 
Lamoureux-St-Hilaire and Ian-none 2012; 
Lamoureux-St-Hilaire 
et 
al. 
2015). 
In contrast, the long-standing, highly resilient, founding lineages reasserted their control of the agricultural lands and perennial water sources, fostering this control using their traditional kin-based power structures (Iannone, Chase, et al. 2014; 
Longstaffe 
and 
Iannone 
2011). 
The 
court­
yards associated with founding lineages demon­strate continued use from the Preclassic into the Postclassic (Schwake and Iannone 2016). 
The 
Postclassic populations left an archaeological “footprint not that dissimilar to their Preclassic and early Classic ancestors” (Iannone, Prufer, and Chase 2014:163). 
The 
Minanha 
Late 
to 
Terminal Preclassic sample includes isotope data for just one individual; however, his or her d13Ccol is very close to the Early Postclassic average (Supplemental Table 4). The Postclassic F1 and F2 averages are most similar to those for the Late to Terminal Preclassic individual (and also the Early Classic mean; see Supplemental Table 4). 
In the Terminal Classic, the Minanha king­dom collapsed and the royal court complex was abandoned. Several long-standing family groups remained and even .ourished in the region into the Early Postclassic period, only to abandon the site slowly over time (Lamoureux-St-Hilaire et al. 2015). 
The 
lack 
of 
immediate, 
total 
site 
abandonment after a series of dry periods in the region implies that the collapse of Minanha was fueled by political events, the effects of which were felt most strongly by the apical elite (Iannone 2005). 
This 
implies 
that 
the 
cyclical 
dry periods at Minanha, although undoubtedly a dif.cult environmental problem to mitigate, did not impede the inhabitants to the point of total site abandonment. 
The isotope data align well with this assertion. When isotope data for all MDEs combined are compared to isotope data for all normal climate periods, there are no signi.cant differences in diet. Nonetheless, when the isotope data for the two MDEs with more than one individual are compared (i.e., Late to Terminal Classic MDE

vs. Early Postclassic MDE), it becomes apparent that maize consumption was lower in the early Postclassic MDE than in the Late to Terminal Classic MDE. This could indicate a shift in agriculture to a drought-resistant crop such as manioc (Sheets et al. 2011), 
but 
it 
also 
could 
be due to decreased maize availability due to the collapse of local markets. Although maize consumption during the most severe dry event recorded during the habitation of Minanha (cal 
A.D. 1000–1175) was lower relative to earlier periods, maize remained the dietary staple and comprised approximately 70 percent of the over­alldiet(Figure 
4). 
Given 
the 
long 
history 
of 
occupation at Minanha and the ritual evidence that has been identi.ed at the site for long-term cultural memory spanning between 425 and 750 years (Schwake and Iannone 2010), 
it 
stands 
to 
reason that the population would have developed the adaptive capacity (e.g., agricultural terraces, water management, crop diversi.cation, etc.) to mitigate the cyclical dry periods that charac­terize the Vaca Plateau. Therefore, it is overly simplistic to suggest that the decrease in maize consumption was exclusively due to a decline in agricultural productivity due to drought. 
Although drought is often thought to be a causative agent in the process of collapse and sociocultural decline among ancient Maya com­munities (e.g., Gill 2000), 
there 
is 
an 
increasing 
awareness that the relationship between drought and collapse is not straightforward (Iannone, Yaeger, and Hodell 2014:61–62), 
and 
the 
evi­
dence that drought or climate change caused collapse is limited (Yaeger and Hodell 2008). 
A 
drought may be detectable in the paleoclimate records, but it may not negatively impact agri­culture or natural resources. Various researchers have proposed a series of drought de.nitions with the aim of quantifying the effect of droughts on the natural environment and populations (e.g., Iannone, Yaeger, and Hodell 2014:65–66; 
Me-Bar and Valdez 2003; 
Wilhite 
and 
Glanz 
1985). 
One way to understand the localized effect of droughts is by evaluating their impact on natural resources (Emery and Thornton 2014:318). 
Stud­
ies of faunal remains from Mexico, Guatemala, Belize, and Honduras suggest that the Late to Terminal Classic drought was present but not suf.cient to negatively impact natural resources (Emery and Thornton 2014:319–320; 
Repus­
sard et al. 2014:243). 
Although 
the 
magnitude, 
effect, and timing of droughts can vary across locales within and between regions (Webster 2014:336–337), 
there 
is 
widespread 
evidence 
for 
a progressive drying trend over the period of Maya cultural development (Emery and Thorn­ton 2014:305). 
There 
is 
also 
growing 
evidence 
that the climatic oscillations that impacted Maya cultural development became more pronounced and unpredictable from the Late Classic onward (Akers et al. 2016:285). 



Conclusion 
The isotope data from Minanha are consistent with a mixed diet incorporating a variety of C3 and C4 resources. The large ranges of d13Ccol, d13Csc, and 13Csc-col values suggest that the diet at Minanha was diverse. Social status likely accounts for some of this diversity. Apical elites buried in the epicenter enjoyed more varied diets than lesser elites buried in the surrounding site core. Signi.cant differences in 13Csc-col and F2 observed among different burial types further suggest that the amount and type of animal protein consumed was related to factors such as social position, lineage, and perhaps occupation (e.g., administrators, agriculturalists, or merchants; Sharpe and Emery 2015). 
Con­
sumption of certain foods, such as puma, jaguar, crocodile, and marine resources, is known to have often been restricted to elite contexts among the ancient Maya (Emery 2002; 
Pohl 
1985; 
Sharpe and Emery 2015). 
Although 
our 
conclu­
sions are based on a small subset of the Minanha population, the results are consistent with the widespread evidence for social differences in diet (e.g., Chase et al. 2001; 
Coyston 
et 
al. 
1999;Emery 
2002; 
Sharpe 
and 
Emery 
2015; 
Somerville et al. 2013; 
Somerville 
et 
al. 
2016; 
White et al. 1993; 
White 
et 
al. 
2001; 
Whittington 
and Reed 1997). 

Comparisons of isotope ratios over time sug­gest that the diet at Minanha was relatively constant. Nevertheless, we acknowledge that our temporally strati.ed samples are very small and not well suited to rigorously testing whether environmental or social factors in.uenced changes in diet. Although the amount of maize

in the diet varied over time, it remained a staple throughout the history of Minanha, even during the MDEs. Maize consumption was at its highest during the transitional Early to Middle Classic, an important period that saw the expansion of the community, increasing social strati.cation, growth of the periphery, and expansion of the agricultural terrace system. The expansion of the terraces may have been a response to cyclical dry periods, especially the one postulated to have occurred at the end of the Preclassic (cal. A.D. 150–250; Akers et al. 2016:281). 
Such 
terraces 
increase water retention and soil fertility (Beach et al. 2002:373–374). 
The 
continued 
expansion 
of agricultural terraces and the growth of water management systems in the Late Classic may have been stimulated by cyclical dry periods, but also likely were responses to the popula­tion growth and increased social strati.cation that characterized the .orescence of Minanha during the Late Classic. The timing of this .orescence and the isotope data suggesting that maize consumption reached its peak when other sites (e.g., Ixchel) were experiencing agricultural downturns, demonstrate the effectiveness of the adaptive strategies and the success of the leaders of Minanha at this time. 
Maize consumption returned to a lower level during the Early Postclassic period. This is consistent with archaeological evidence for a shift in the organization of food procurement from the Terminal Classic to the Postclassic (Macrae 2010:163–164) 
and 
broader 
regional dietary trends (Somerville et al. 2013). 
Macrae 
(2010:163–164) 
suggests 
that 
terrace 
construc­
tion and food production were decentralized (i.e., characterized by nonhierarchical, household-level control over production) prior to the Late Classic, heterarchical (i.e., a combination of hierarchical and nonhierarchical control over production) during the Late Classic period, and decentralized again during the Terminal Classic and Postclassic periods. This idea is supported by archaeological research at the site core, which suggests that after the collapse of the royal court the Minanha Maya shifted back to a more tradi­tional rural lifeway. Speci.cally, long-standing family groups with ties to the best agricultural lands and perennial water sources reasserted their authority over the community (Longstaffe and Iannone 2011:54). 
Given 
the 
archaeological 
similarities between Preclassic and Postclas­sic assemblages, gradual site abandonment, the resilience of the subsistence economy, and the dismantling of the market economy at nearby Caracol, the decrease in maize consumption associated with the Early Postclassic at Minanha probably was more closely related to political factors than to environmental factors. There is good evidence that Minanha was resilient to environmental perturbations for much of its existence. Rather than simply adapting to their environment, the Minanha Maya built into their lifeway an adaptive capacity that allowed them to exhibit high levels of resilience to climate change, shifting land-use strategies, and demo­graphic .uctuations.
