CORPORATE POWER STRATEGIES IN THE LATE FORMATIV E TO 
EARLY CLASSIC TEQUILA VALLE YS OF CENTRAL JALISCO 

Christopher S. Beekman 
Corporate political strategies (Blanton et al. 1996) that privilege power-sharing over exclusionary tactics are recognized to be important yet understudied forms of political behavior in early complex polities. I present the case of the Tequila val­leys of western Mexico to illustrate several points about this corporate system: that the component descent groups can be 
f
recognized through their diferent approaches to architectural construction and burial patterns; that they form groups of counterpoised lineages that shared power; that the relationships between these groups become more fixed and hierarchi­cal across different scales of architecture; and that there are distinct strata within the burial patterns that separate power­sharing groups from the rest of the community. It may be easier to identify and trace aspects of political organization here than in complex and layered urban settings that have been the focus of similar research.

age-grades, and sodalities in diffusing exclusion­ary power, the presence of multiple hierarchies with delimited tasks, control over ritual knowledge, and the role played by the shifting membership of for­mal positions of political power. Application in the American Southwest has singled out the role of control over ritual knowledge, coordinated labor, modularity of social groups, and inequalities between groups or communities rather than between individuals (Feinman 2000:219-220; Feinman et al. 2001; Mills 2000:6-10). Near East­ern specialists have simultaneously applied the cor­porate and network concepts to Early and Middle Bronze Age communities from the Euphrates val­ley, where assemblies of elders counterbalanced royal lineages, placing the two strategies side by side in dynamic tension (Cooper 2006; Fleming 2004; Porter 2002). Blanton ( 1998) has recognized this variability and has outlined several factors that distinguish different corporate systems, some of which will surface in this paper. Among them group assemblies (Blanton 1998: 154-155), or what Crumley ( 1995) has referred to as heterarchy, can encompass various forms of more inclusive deci­sion making groups. I also find useful Blanton's "ritual sanctification of the corporate cognitive code" (Blanton 1998: 163-166), in which religious ideals or highly structured political interaction may enforce a kind of egalitarianism among those under its terms. These observations make it clear that we are not engaging in a typological exercise, but con­sidering variations on a theme. 
It is worth considering corporate strategies in more detail in the region where Blanton and col­leagues proposed the model, particularly since they are defined at least partly by what they lack, e.g., royal imagery. One feature that may be common with Mesoamerican corporate strategies is the pres­ence of multiple social groups existing in segmen­tary opposition to one another at the subcommunity level. These have been referred to by some Mesoamerican ethnographers and ethnohistorians as Customary Subdivisions, which are variously territorial or kin-based social groups that are the basis for the mobilization of labor, and often for other activities (Mulhare 1996; see also Brumfiel 1994). The most familiar example is the Postclas­sic calpolli of central Mexico (e.g., Van Zantwijk 1985). There are indications of this modular pat­tern still earlier at Classic period Teotihuacan, where most of the city's population was organized into apartment compounds occupied by the fami­lies of related males (Cowgill 2004; Manzanilla 1996; Millon 1981; Sempowski and Spence 1994 ). Nonetheless, stratification existed and elite lineages held privileged locations and competed with one another in the ceremonial core of the city (Head­rick 1999). This underlines two points taken as a given in this study and already noted elsewhere (Blanton 1998; Feinman 2000)-that corporate systems are not devoid of competition between the constituent social groups, and corporate arrange­ments can be called egalitarian only in the sense that no one group maintains long-term dominance over the others. 
The Late Formative to Early Classic period political system of the Tequila valleys of central Jalisco has previously been identified as a likely example of a corporate political strategy (Beekman 2000), and this paper aims to expand upon that claim. I propose here that the Tequila valley polit­ical landscape during this period was organized around similar yet counterpoised lineages arrayed in opposition to one another. Together they formed an elite social stratum that built and maintained dedicated ritual spaces within the ceremonial cen­ters, and whose special treatment at death included interment beneath the public architecture. Non­elite lineages were buried in rural cemeteries. Finally, I outline how the relationships between these groups become more fixed and hierarchical as they are traced from small architectural arenas to large ones. Archaeological identification of the corporate groups in question necessarily forms a central element in this study, and current evidence suggests that details of political organization may be easier to trace here than in complex and layered urban settings like Teotihuacan. 
The research discussed here combines a con­sideration of existing data on burial distribution with new construction evidence from public archi­tecture, and not the patterning of group craft pro­duction (e.g., Manzanilla 1996) or epigenetic skeletal characteristics (e.g., Sempowski and Spence 1994) analyzed by other researchers for similar questions. This is due to the nature of the available evidence from the Tequila valleys rather than any conceptual biases, and future research should incorporate other lines of investigation for their relationships to the data discussed here. In fact,

by establishing the relevance of specific contexts for these questions, I hope to make such future studies easier to pursue. 
The Central Jalisco Setting 
West Mexico's best-known archaeological features have been, first, the deep shaft and chamber tombs known for their accompanying offerings of realis­tic and charming hollow ceramic figures (e.g., Kan et al. 1970), and second, the distinctive Teuchitlan circular arrangements of public architecture known as guachimontones (Weigand 1996a). Both archae­ological patterns have wide distributions across West Mexico, and have been used by scholars of different generations to define that region (e.g., Kan et al. 1970; Weigand 1985). The greatest time depth and most hierarchical expressions of each are found in the Tequila valleys of central Jalisco during the Late Formative through Middle Classic periods. Past culture-historical syntheses (Weigand 1985, 1996b) and theoretical interpretations (e.g., Beek­man 2000) of the region have considered the two datasets separately, due to preliminary chronolog­ical alignments that considered them to be more sequential than contemporaneous. Recent improve­ments to our understanding of chronology have clarified that the overlap in the tomb and temple traditions is nearly total (Beekman and Weigand 2008) (see Table 1), hence freeing us to consider 
jointly the evidence for sociopolitical organization from these two datasets. The Tequila valleys are closely linked highland 
lake basins and valleys ringing the Tequila volcano, in the central lakes district of modem Jalisco (Fig­ure l ). The area is known today for its history of haciendas, the origins of tequila, and a major con­tribution to Mexican maize agriculture even in the modem era of declining national production. Shaft tombs, whether as isolates or in cemeteries, occur in surprising densities throughout the area, and most of the toponyms associated with the hollow shaft tomb figures in museum and private collec­tions (Etzatlan, San Sebastian, Ameca, San J uanito, Tala, etc.) are found within these valleys (see Townsend 1998 for a modern discussion). The region also quite probably held the largest Late Formative to Classic period population concentra­tion in western Mexico. Densely urbanized centers are not known from the periods in question, and population instead followed a dispersed and con­tinuous distribution across the valley bottomlands (Weigand 1996b). Population density increased locally around ceremonial centers that included the circular temples of the Teuchitlan tradition, ball­courts, and residential buildings. The only popula­tion estimates made for the valley (Weigand 1996b:Figure 14) are qualified by aggregating the unpublished residential settlement from across the Late Formative through Middle Classic periods (300 B.C.-A.D. 500). Even so, the severe correc­tions employed by Weigand for contemporaneity mean that his peak population estimates of 40,000 for the valley should receive serious consideration. 
It has been previously argued that the Tequila valley political system could be characterized as

a corporate strategy (Beekman 2000). There are no buildings that might be interpreted as palaces during the period under consideration (see Nel­son 2004). Hollow ceramic human figures are known primarily from tomb contexts, and most represent daily or ritual activities by various social persona (see Townsend 1998; von Winning 1969; von Winning and Hammer 1972). While imagery of elites or even rulers may be present among them (Beekman 2003a:Figure 13; Graham 1998), they tend to be on the same order as those at Teoti­huacan, in that the images are more abstract and without individualizing features or monikers. As at Teotihuacan (Headrick 2002; Pasztory 1997), the rituals carried out within public architectural spaces in the Tequila valleys reflect broad-based concerns of world renewal and agricultural suc­cess (Beekman 2003a, 2003b ), topics of interest to commoner and elite alike. The performative aspects of ancestral ritual (Barrett 1996) remain unclear, but do seem less well-evidenced relative to the highly public rituals on the surface (Beek­man 2000). Blanton et al.'s (1996) definition of corporate also underlines the importance of the visual codification of group-oriented ideology, most clearly demonstrated in this region through the formulaic reproduction of cosmological prin­ciples in both public architecture and ceramic design (Beekman 2003a, 2006). 
But how did individuals and groups contribute to these broader patterns? I intend to use existing mortuary data as evidence for lineages or similar corporate descent groups in the Tequila valleys, and to illustrate that some of them held privileged access to sacred knowledge and privileged posi­tions in the public arenas where political power was enacted. A consideration of new data on con­struction patterns in these public spaces follows, in which I argue that these elite lineages occur only in multiples and without a clear "royal lineage" holding exclusionary power. As the scale of these public architectural spaces increases, the relation­ships between the corporate groups alter in two major ways. First, fluid status relations give way to more fixed internal stratification into junior and senior lineages. Second, lineages within large archi­tectural spaces command more labor or even the labor of multiple lineages.

Mortuary Data 
Evidence for the role of lineages or similar social groups within this cultural milieu emerged first in the mortuary data. 2 Much early research relied upon the study of looted tombs (e.g., Corona Nunez 1954, 1955; Furst 1965; Long 1966; Weigand 1985), and was only sufficient to conclude that the tombs were highly differentiated in terms of their depth and elaboration, often included multiple interments, and that many tombs probably remained open and in use for extended periods. The publication of the Tabachines cemetery of two dozen unlooted shaft tombs by the Instituto Nacional de Antropologfa e Historia (INAH) pro­vided an excavated body of data that supported these findings (Beekman and Galvan 2006; Galvan 1976, 1991 ). The presence of sequential interments even at this small rural cemetery (e.g., Galvan 199l:see tombs 1, 2, 3, 6, 8, and 1 I) drives home the point that the tomb size and wealth of offerings do not speak to the status of a single occupant, but that of their social group. 
A major break for our understanding was the excavation by INAH investigators of a wealthy and intact first century A.D. shaft tomb within a settle­ment context at Huitzilapa (Lopez and Ramos 2000; Ramos and Lopez I 996). Apart from the unprecedented details of the excavation itself was the tomb's location beneath a platform from a sim­ple architectural circle of the Teuchitlan tradition. The osteological analysis of the six individuals within the tomb found evidence for a close genetic relationship between five of them (Pickering and Cabrero I998), and hence membership in a close breeding population. The suggestion here is that these individuals either come from a class­endogamous elite, or a smaller social unit defined by descent (cf. Christensen 1998 for similar data from Oaxaca). Several publications dating since this analysis have proposed a lineage basis for Late Formative social organization (e.g., Beekman 2000; Lopez and Ramos 2000; Ramos and Lopez 1996), a trend reaching its recent culmination with an art catalog seeking to reinterpret various well-known themes from the shaft tomb art tradition within this framework (Butterwick 2004). For example, But­terwick (2004:e.g., Items 13, 14, 33, 34, 35, 36) interprets paired male and female figures from the tombs as "lineage founders." 
The tombs have much to offer those espousing the lineage interpretation, beginning with some well-known cross-cultural data on cemeteries. Some years previous, Saxe (1970) proposed a link between formal, demarcated areas for the burial of the dead (cemeteries, burial mounds), and corpo­rate descent groups using those spaces. The act of burial and the associated attachment to place enabled the transmission of group property across generations. The correlation of formal burial spaces and corporate groups has been supported in cross­cultural analyses by O'Shea (1984) and Goldstein ( 1981 ), with the caveat that corporate groups answering this description may also legitimize rights to critical resources through means other than the use of cemeteries. The study has been cri­tiqued (Barrett 1996; Morris 1991) as unhelpfully lumping ancestral ritual with mortuary ritual, the former defining corporate property ownership and the latter contesting it. Numerous authors continue to find support for the link between cemeteries, corporate groups, and group property (e.g., Buik­stra and Charles 1999; Chapman 1995; McAnany 1995; Parker Pearson 1999:28-31), although sub­tlety of application may vary. 
Formally defined burial spaces first emerge in western Mexico in the Early Formative, with the earliest precursors of repeated interment shaft and chamber tombs in northwestern Michoacan and central Jalisco (Oliveros 2004; Weigand I985:6 1 ). Known examples occur in spatial and temporal proximity to one another and may have formed a cemetery, while one isolated example occurs beneath the remnants of a platform of unknown function (Weigand 1985:61). Middle Formative cemeteries of individual burials are known from Jalisco (Liot et al. 2006; Mountjoy 1989; Moun­tjoy, et al. 2004 ), Coli ma (Kelly 1980), and Gua­najuato (Porter 1956). Occasionally they occur in conjunction with curation practices in which human remains receive special treatment and may be moved from place to place (e.g., Liot et al. 2006). In central Jalisco, Middle Formative burials could occur beneath small circular constructions in bottle­shaped tombs, and larger numbers of the dead could be interred in circular or oval burial mounds at San Felipe and other sites in the Tequila valleys (Weigand 1985:60--63). Ifthe occurrence ofnumer­ous burials within formally defined spaces may be taken to indicate the presence of descent groups,

then lineages may have considerable time depth along the path of the Rfo Lerma. 
The use of deep shaft and chamber tombs was widespread by the Late Formative period. Although shaft tombs are commonly thought of as distinc­tively West Mexican, it is understood today to be a much more internally diverse phenomenon than previously believed (Fowler et al. 2006), and even the cremation urn clusters at Loma Alta (Michoacan) share some characteristics (Carot 200 1 )I limit my discussion strictly to evidence

from the Tequila and Atemajac valleys of central Jalisco, where the tombs take on the characteris­tics already introduced: repeated interments, wide variation in offerings and labor investment, and the presence of hollow ceramic figures and imported wealth among the offerings. Tombs in central Jalisco also present a number of additional pat­terns. First, shaft tombs occur in association with the circular public architecture in ceremonial cen­ters, with isolated structures of uncertain function, and in rural cemeteries (Beekman and Galvan V. 2006:68). Second, the deepest, wealthiest, and most labor-intensive shaft tombs are located directly beneath the satellite platforms of the circular guachimontones or other buildings, while the less­complex shaft tombs are associated with fewer offerings and are typically grouped into cemeter­ies away from the major settlements. Without pre­senting a full quantitative analysis (explored in Beekman 1999), we can use tombs such as those of El Arenal (Corona Nunez 1955:9-11 ; Long 
1966:248-278, Figures 8-10) and Huitzilapa (Ramos and Lopez 1996:126-129,Figures3,4, 12, Tables 1 and 2) as examples found beneath guachi­montones, and the well-published tombs from Tabachines (Galvan 1991) as an example of a rural cemetery. Groups that make greater use of mov­able wealth and labor are therefore associated with locations within the religious and political realm, while groups that use these resources less are found on the broader landscape.3 Control over sacred knowledge likely separated these two groups, and formed the basis for stratification. 
Shaft tombs from the Classic period are distinct and suggest a decline in the importance oflineages, at least among the farming populace. The only pop­ulation of shaft tombs that has been excavated and can be examined for trends over time is that at Tabachines (Galvan 1991). The Tequila IV (A.D. 
200-500) shaft tombs at this rural cemetery are characterized by decreasing size of the tomb, decreasing number of occupants, and decreasing number of offerings. No shaft tombs associated with the public architecture are known from this period. A number of explanations are possible, but a decline in the importance of lineages seems to be a component (Beekman 2007). 
Architectural Evidence 
The lineage thesis has also been applied in recent years to the surface architecture. Weigand (1974) had early on postulated a relationship between the distinctive form of the guachimontones and social organization based on architectural morphology. The circles typically consist of eight rectangular platforms symmetrically arranged around a circu­lar altar or pyramid (Figure 2), although examples exist that include four, or occasionally 10, 12, or even 16 platforms. A banquette, or low terrace, forms a ring around the patio in the larger and more formal examples, and links the surrounding platforms (Weigand l 996a). Weigand (1974:126-127) postulated on the basis of these repeated surface data that each platform might rep­resent a lineage, and that a possible chronological trend toward a larger number of platforms thus spoke to changes in social organization. Any such trend has been discarded with the recent chrono­logical realignment mentioned above, but a num­ber of other researchers have also projected a 
lineage interpretation "upwards" from the tombs to the surface architecture (Beekman 2000; But­terwick 2004; Cabrero and Lopez 1997, 2002; Lopez and Ramos 2000; Ramos and Lopez 1996), particularly as these are the built foci for political power. A discussion of new evidence for this inter­pretation forms this section. 
The Tequila Valley Regional Archaeological Project (TVRAP) was formed in 2000 to examine the activities taking place within the circular com­plexes. I had proposed that lineage heads arrayed around the temple architecture competed through public performance for supporters and their labor (Beekman 2000). My expectations were that pub­lic spaces would retain evidence for the use of more elaborate material culture (highly decorated ceram­ics, imports, etc.) as part of competitive display. These expectations were not borne out, and my

attention instead became drawn to the evidence for asymmetries within the architecture. As already mentioned, one of the curious features of the cir­cular complexes is their geometric symmetry, and surface studies of the guachimontones had tended to emphasize pattern at the expense of variation (e.g., Weigand 1996a, 1996b). While the project originally took an approach emphasizing the com­petitive aspects of individual aggrandizers (clearly indebted to the model in Clark and Blake 1994 ), field results have instead tended to stress the pres­ence of multiple social groups and their separate contributions to architectural construction. No shaft tombs have been identified beneath these circles. The importance of lineages varies at the three sites recently excavated in the Tequila valleys-Llano Grande and Navajas, excavated by the TVRAP, and Guachimont6n, excavated by the Proyecto Guachi­mont6n (Weigand 2002, 2008). No chronological trends for the role of lineages have yet been dis­cerned across these sites. Rather, it is the scale of the architectural group that is most significant for discerning differences in social interaction. Lin­eages have flexible relationships to one another at the small circles of Llano Grande and Navajas, they form a more rigid status hierarchy at a larger cir­cle at Navajas, and have become embedded within wider social networks at Guachimont6n. 
Llano Grande Group 14 
The TVRAP carried out fieldwork at Llano Grande in 2000 (Figure 3). The site is located on the west­ern edge of the Tequila valleys, strategically block­ing a pass leading through the mountains to southern Nayarit and the Pacific coast. A study of Teuchitlan tradition sites that compared the respec­tive volumes of their public architecture (Ohner­sorgen and Varien 1996) did not include Llano Grande as it fell outside the limits of their map, but its small circle would place it in their lowest site size category "D." This is thus a small center with one circle and an array of well-preserved residen­tial buildings. Successive defensive walls crossing the pass from one side to the other are strongly ori­ented toward control over access from the west. Llano Grande has been interpreted as a modest, spe­cialized boundary fortification tied to an overarch­ing political authority (Beekman 1996, 2003c ). 
The 2000 fieldwork consisted of excavations in the single architectural circle (Figure 4), an adja-

cent group, and the cleanup of a defensive wall damaged by modem roadcutting. An evaluation of the 38 calibrated AMS dates against the architec­tural stratigraphy places the entire sequence from construction to abandonment of the circle within the periodA.D. 200--300 (Beekman 2003d, 2003e; Beekman and Weigand 2008), and the remainder of this small site probably falls within this brief time span as well. No tombs were encountered or even suggested within the settlement, but a badly looted cemetery lies on the valley floor below. 
Some summary details on the circle are as fol­lows. The diameter of the circular patio, measured from the face of opposing structures, was 25.9 m between partly excavated structures 14-2 and 14­6, and 24.8-27 .0 m between the others. The diam­eter of the entire circle, measured to the rear walls of opposing structures, was 36.9-41.1 m. Empha­sizing the excavation data, the shared patio would have had an area of approximately 527 m2 for pub­lic ceremony. The patio was resurfaced once dur­ing the period of occupation with a poorly preserved puddled clay mixture. A small depres­sion excavated in antiquity in an exposed promi­nence of bedrock in the center of the patio was most likely used for the pole climbing ceremony depicted in ceramic models from the region (e.g., Kan et al. 1970:Figure 35; Von Winning 1969:Fig­ure 155) and is discussed elsewhere (Beekman 2003a). The artifact assemblage within the patio and the structures was relatively limited and dis­proportionately focused within Structure 14-5, but more striking was the variation in the structures themselves. Since excavation was targeting activ­ity areas rather than construction details, data on the latter are less thorough, but are sufficient to make my point. Each structure displays evidence for distinct sizes, construction methods and histo­ries, and probably activities. 
Even prior to excavation it had become clear that the surrounding platforms were quite different from one another in size and elaboration, but excavations further highlighted this fact. Structure 14-2 (with an estimated 16-17 m2 of floor area) was con­structed atop a natural slope 50 cm above the level of the patio using little labor and little raw mater­ial (Figure 5). A floor made of a prepared clay mix was in poor condition, but one preserved patch sug-

The small quantities of fired daub (bajareque) suggest that only portions of the super­structure received this covering treatment, and the building may well have been open sided. There were very few artifacts present, namely undeco­rated ceramics and small quantities of obsidian debitage. Structure 14-2 would probably have been accessed from a level area behind the structure rather than from the central shared patio. 
Structures 14-5 and 14-6 (each at least 25 m2) were more substantial constructions, with stacked stone foundations encased in another artificial earth mix. Fired daub was more abundant, particularly in front of Structure 14-6. The floors were again of a well-prepared clay mix, and that within Structure 14-6 displayed variability in preservation that sug­gested a more finely finished front room. Structure 
14-6 was remodeled on three occasions over the century of occupation, with flat stones flanking the entryway during the middle stages, while Structure 14-5 was not. At the time of Llano Grande 's aban­donment, Structure 14-5's floor would have been a significant step downwards from the patio level. Yet the daub collapse sloping out of Structure 14­6 indicate that this structure's interior floor had been built up to just above the level of the patio. Although few artifacts apart from lithic debitage were found in Structure 14-6, Structure 14-5 had several burned and shattered but largely complete fine and utilitarian bowls of Tabachines Cream and Oconahua Red on White, and jars of Colo rines Red on Cream and Pseudo-Cloisonne (types defined in Beekman and Weigand 2000). While the promi­nence of Structure 14-5 may be overemphasized by the presence of the whole vessels, this same structure also contained the widest array of ceramic sherds that were not part of the complete vessels

(Beekman 2003d). Thus, even its more gradually accumulated debris indicates a different pattern of use. A palynological sequence constructed from the excavations (Schoenwetter and Benz 2004) sug­gests that Structure 14-5 may have been added to the circle later than the other two. 
The numerous maps of guachimontones from throughout the Tequila valleys and beyond vary in the exact number of structures and in other features (cf. Weigand 1975, 1985), but they are recogniz­ably circles and do not occur as half-circles, cres­cents, pie-slices, or some other incomplete form that would suggest that they were constructed piecemeal over time. Their singularly symmetrical morphology strongly presupposes that the basic circular form was built as a single unit as a single event, the only exception perhaps being that circles with four structures might have later been expanded through the insertion of an additional four struc­tures between the founding examples. The Llano Grande circle might represent an example of this if it can be substantiated that Structure 14-5 was indeed added in a later episode. But the disparity between Structures 14-2 and 14-6 (directly oppo­site one another and hence almost certainly built at the same time) makes it clear that significant struc­tural variation existed from the circle's initial trac­ings. Thus variations between structures in a single circle are not solely chronological in nature. 
The construction methods that distinguish each structure around the circle are most parsimoniously explained if each was built by different construc­tion groups with different resources, skills, and practices. Distinct labor groups were working on their individual structures even as they were coop­erating to create the wider circular template. Some of the variation may result from routine approaches to construction, but other evidence points to ongo­ing competition and active signaling of group mem­bership. In contemporary ceramic architectural models from the region, the artisans of the period often depicted the perishable superstructures of guachimontones with varying roof forms and painted designs, even within a single circle (e.g.,
