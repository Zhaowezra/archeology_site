DEDICATION AND TERMINATION RITUALS 
IN SOUTHERN MOCHE PUBLIC ARCHITECTURE 

Jorge Gamboa Velasquez 
This paper assesses a set of ideological practices related to the growth and abandonment of ceremo.ial and administrative buildings from the southern Moche area of the north coast of Peru. The archaeological record at Huacas de Moche, El Brujo, and Guadalupito, three of the main settlements in the region, includes evidence for the deposition and manipulation of animal and human bodies, burning, and the alteration of wall iconography. These activities took place in the period between A.D. 300-750, and were related to either the construction and renovation of structures or the abandonment of mon­umental built spaces. The analysis of this data contributes to a better understanding of Moc he ritual dedicatory behavior, contextualizing it in a broader perspective on place making and the marking of time in precolumbian South America. 
El presente art(culo evalua datos procedentes de Huacas de Moche, El Brujo y Guadalupito, tres asentamientos Moche inves­tigados intensivamente en las ultimas decadas. Este analisis revela una serie de procedimientos de celebraci6n del ciclo exis­tencial de las espacios religiosos y de interacci6n polltica de la costa norte peruana entre los afios 300-750 d.C.

(spaces used in ritual propitiation and social in­teraction) platforms. 
Did the Moche of the north coast of Peru also perform these activities? As archaeological re­search has demonstrated, the construction of au­thority in Moche polities was closely related to public performances and the control of material expressions of ideological power, including the elaboration and use of public architecture (Bawden 2001:288-289; DeMarrais et al. 1996; Swenson 2011). The understanding of Moche public build­ings has deepened in recent years, with notable advances in the study of architectural designs and sequences and the symbolic power of mural art. Nonetheless, rituals related to Moche architectural renovation have not been a frequent subject of comparative analysis, with the exceptions of Haas (1985; Shimada 1994:238), Uceda (1997, 2008: 160-169)2, and Uceda and Canziani (1998:157­158). Recent contributions by Chauchat and Gutie­rrez (2013),Prieto (2008), Swenson (2012), Swen­son and Warner (2012), and Trever et al. (2013) offer a set of new contextualized data and interpre­tations of the linkage between architectural se­quences, offerings, and intentionally destroyed im­ages in Moche public and household architecture. 
This article examines data from Huacas de Moche, El Brujo, and Guadalupito, three primary sites in the southern Moche area-a territory ex­tending from the Chicama to the Huarmey Valleys-from which there exists a great deal of recently published contextual data. The recogni­tion of the ideological practices associated with the physical and symbolic transformation of pub­lic architectural landscapes in these settlements provides a detailed understanding of ritual be­
haviors associated with the construction, use, and abandonment of public spaces on the north coast of Peru. This evidence leads us to evaluate the issues of integrity, materiality, and alteration of public architecture for this ancient society. At the same time, this approach highlights the connec­tion between the Andean concepts of growth and rebirth and the broader precolumbian ideology. 
Theory of Dedication and Termination Rituals 
Public architecture is an extensive category that includes built spaces used for social interaction on a larger scale than the household unit, and that 
are central to representations of social order. Public 
spaces are vital for the display of class, rank, or 
status distinctions, becoming both sites of en­
counter of different socioeconomic groups and 
arenas for the development of social institutions 
(Moore 1996, 2005; Smith 2003; Swenson 2011). 
This is particularly obvious in precolumbian urban 
centers such as Cuzco, Chan Chan, or Teotihuacan, 
where public buildings were organized in sacred 
built landscapes intended to express statements 
of cosmological and sociopolitical order to a mas­
sive and inherently diverse audience.3 Public 
buildings in use over long periods of time experi­
enced changes in design and meaning that could 
be highlighted by means of consecratory activities 
loaded with political and religious symbolism. 
Reflecting an interest in understanding process 
and agency in the past, the establishment, use, 
and termination of domestic and public buildings 
have become important subjects in precolumbian 
research over the past few decades. The following 
paragraphs will present the conceptual categories 
employed in my analysis of the consecration of 
Moche public architecture. Some of the concepts 
incorporate information drawn from the southern 
Andes and Mesoamerican studies. These cases 
have been selected with the aim of analyzing 
Moche ideology in a wider context which inte­grates information on place-making events from different regions in the Americas. 
Consecration events generally have a ceremo­nial character, articulating space and temporality in special environments that engage architecture, visual representations, and performance. Archi­tectural dedications can be defined as founding events identifiable in the material record through artifacts, bodies, or special items deposited below or on the first occupational levels of a structure, which later may be subject to remodeling and re­construction. Conducted at the beginning of a construction project, the initial consecratory cer­emonies of a building may aim to grant life and power to a building. Architectural dedications can also make a statement about the connection between social leaders, divinities, and ancestors. As such, dedications publicly reaffirm the claim of a bond between a particular social group and the meaning of a structure. 
Evidence from different regions of the Americas suggests that the majority of dedications conducted

in residential structures and public buildings were intended to mark the initial construction of those spaces-and the political negotiations associated with initiating such construction project-as well as encouraging the correct "ensouling" of spaces seen as animate entities. Although some authors have stressed the inherently animistic character of nature and its material components for indigenous societies of the Americas (Monaghan 1998), the majority of studies on architectural dedications have emphasized the propitiatory and political character of these practices (Arriola and Tessar 2011: 33-34; Meddens et al. 2010). 
Termination is usually defined as a ceremonial event marking the end of the use of a space. Ter­mination events are identifiable in the archaeo­logical record through the recovery of special materials placed intentionally on the floor of a structure or through cultural deposits overlaying structures that have been partially or completely dismantled. Such indications of termination events include the presence of scattered and pur­posefully smashed artifacts, the systematic de­facement of architectural faades and sculptures, and the partial or complete burning of a building (Chauchat and Gutierrez 2013:154-160; Pagliaro et al. 2003; Topic et al. 2002: 312, 323-324; Williams 2001:78-79). As the counterpart to ded­ications, termination rituals may have contributed to reaching a state of consensus on the end of use of a built space, becoming a "precondition" for the rebirth of a community and its ceremonial settings (Mock 1998:119). Alternatively, the ter­mination of public buildings may have been car­ried out by opposite political factions or by local inhabitants under coercion in the aftermath of warfare engagements, acquiring a desecrative na­ture aimed at appropriating or erasing the identity and prestige of a meaningful structure and its oc­cupants (Inomata 2003; Lopez Lujan et al. 2006; Walker 1998). 
The ending of the original function of a build­ing could mean the starting point of a new cycle of meaning. Some acts of architectural consecra­tion can acquire a compound nature consisting of both the termination of certain spaces and the propitiation of spaces subject to renewal. Such cases are more difficult for archaeologists to in­terpret, but the meaning of these complex events can be better understood by recognizing the con­junction of sacred time and space in the religious ideology of ancient populations (Swenson 2012: 15; Topic 2008). Viewed from this perspec­tive, dedications and events consecrating archi­tectural renewal appear as integral parts of the continuous functional and symbolic value attrib­uted to socially meaningful built environments. Although carried out at different times in the oc­cupational history of a structure, both types of ritual activities contributed to legitimize-through performances and the manipulation of religious paraphernalia and special materials-distinct lev­els of power and authority before the members of a community. 
Available data for the ancient Americas indi­cate that human and animal sacrifice were asso­ciated with processes of renovation of ceremonial settings originated in time cycles, dynastic change, or natural disasters (Lopez and Lopez 2009; Wester 2010:57-108). To identify the sym­bolism of a sacrificial context requires, without doubt, a thorough analysis of its depositional characteristics as well as the artifacts associated with sacrificial remains. A human or animal sac­rifice located in the initial level of a building can be positively identified as part of a founding event if the successive construction stages reit­erate the location, architectural design, and func­tion of the early structures. The absence of su­perimposed or similarly designed architectural levels atop the sacrificial context may indicate, on the contrary, its correspondence to a ritual termination. On the other hand, the recovery of sacrificed individuals within or near tombs of high-ranking individuals can be interpreted as part of the funerary practices of a population and not necessarily as an indicator of the marking of time within a ceremonial space. 
Eventually, some buildings that undergo con­stant renovation and expansion are no longer sub­ject to this process. The abandonment of built spaces can be established from two types of ar­chaeological observations: the absence of mate­rials from later occupations and the evidence of anomalies such as burning, the closing of door­ways, or the mutilation of decorations (Darras 2003: 12). Later attitudes of local settlers towards ancient buildings are highly variable in time, in­cluding manifestations of homage, appropriation, and avoidance (Stanton and Magnoni 2008), as

illustrated by the current modalities of reuse for public buildings destroyed during the 1980s and 1990s in the wake of political violence in the Pe­ruvian highlands.Abandoned structures can even­tually be subject to reoccupation with new reli­gious, economic, or situational purposes, which are expressed through activities as different as the quarrying of the building, its transfonnation into a burial ground, or the carrying out of com­memorative and propitiatory ceremonies. 
Data on Consecratory Activities in Southern 
Moche Public Architecture 

From A.D. 100-800, the territory stretching be­tween the Piura and Huarmey Valleys on the North Coast of Peru was occupied by Moche polities (Figure 1). The major Moche settlements are currently considered examples of early An­dean urbanism. Interaction between elite groups and commoners took place in urban centers

through public gatherings in walled plazas and platforms conspicuously decorated with poly­chrome murals and clay reliefs (Franco et al. 1994a, 2003; Gamboa 2014; Morales 2003; Uceda 2001 ). Rituals and related activities re­viewed in this paper were conducted in public buildings used for public and private religious performances or to accomplish administrative functions and elite interaction. The Old Temple at Huaca de la Luna and Cao Viejo belong to the first group, sharing architectural traits, decoration patterns, and a series of similarly organized con­texts that reflect religious behavior. The Guadalupito platforms stand apart from these buildings, displaying different growth processes and contextual evidence for their functioning as palatial buildings. 
Located in the Lower Moche Valley, the site ofHuacas de Moche was an extensive settlement composed of two massive adobe platforms, Huaca del Sol and Huaca de la Luna, surrounded by large residential areas (Chapdelaine 2008; Uceda 2001). From the fifth to the early eighth century A.D., the leaders of the settlement were at the head of a political and economic interaction 
sphere that extended from the Chicama Valley to the Santa Valley (Chapdelaine 2010a). Archaeo­logical excavations demonstrate that Platform I, the main building of the so-called Old Temple of Huaca de la Luna, was periodically rebuilt, with successive constructive events in which old struc­tures were filled with adobe to create the foun­dations for a new precinct (Uceda and Canziani 1998:157-158). Renovations of Platform I fin­ished around A.D. 650, when elite competition within the polity led to a shift in power to the Huaca del Sol compound and the New Temple of Huaca de la Luna (Uceda and Morales 2009). 
The site of El Brujo emerged around the third century A.D. as the principal ceremonial center of the lower Chicama Valley and the center of a powerful autonomous polity. Excavations at Huaca Cao Viejo (Figure 2), one of the two main platforms of the site, have revealed several con­struction phases dated between A.D. 300-650. During its early occupational phases, the site was ruled by military and priestly elite lineages and 
Huaca Cao Viejo presented idiosyncratic forms 
of mural decoration. The last phase of occupation 
at Cao Viejo reveals a strong relationship with

the Old Temple at Huaca de la Luna, with both 
buildings sharing architectural features and icono­
graphic programs (Franco et al. 1994a, 2003; Mu­
jica 2007:155-171). 
From A.D. 600-750, Guadalupito was the 
main Moche settlement in the Lower Santa Valley, 
presenting an urban landscape dominated by two 
massive platforms: Huaca Tembladera and Huaca 
Chica (Chapdelaine 2011; Wilson 1988:207, 211­
212). Excavations by the Santa Valley Project of 
Universite de Montreal at the main platforms of 
Guadalupito revealed evidence related to activi­
ties of conspicuous consumption and redistribu­
tion. Both buildings were constantly remodeled 
until their abandonment at the end of the eighth 
century AD. 
The current scarcity of data on ceremonies 
aimed at marking the initial foundation of south­
ern Moche buildings can be attributed to the chal­
lenges of excavating the deepest levels of monu­
mental architecture. A noteworthy exception is 
the excavation of the first construction level in 
the Cao Viejo plaza, which recovered the body 
of a vulture-possibly a black vulture, Coragyps 
atratus (Regulo Franco, personal communication 
2014)-placed beside two semicircular sunken 
rooms (Figure 3; Franco et al. 1994b:57). Carrion 
birds were considered by the Moche to be emis­
saries of death and companions of the gods during 
mythical journeys. The symbolic importance of 
vultures in Moche beliefs regarding sacrifice, 
death, and the afterlife (Benson 1975:132-133) 
supports the interpretation of this context as evi­
dence for the ritual consecration of the first of a 
series of semicircular structures built on the same 
section of the plaza during successive episodes. 
Data from the Lurin Valley shows that the body 
parts of Andean condors (Vultur gryphus, another 
carrion bird with an important role in Andean re­
ligious beliefs) were used in ceremonial settings 
since at least the Late Formative period (400­
100 BC; Jave 2013). Recent excavations at the 
Early Intermediate Period site of Mango I, Cule­
bras Valley, revealed another instance of dedica­
tory practices in a public building located in the 
southern extreme of the Moche territory. At 
Mango I, the building was dedicated by sacrific­
ing two camelids, which were wrapped in mats and placed beneath the floor of an entry courtyard (Giersz 2011:281). 
Some Moche consecratory acts performed dur­ing the ending of use of a building can be con­sidered to reflect interrelated termination and ren­ovation propitiatory practices. One of the earliest examples of this behavior comes from an offering cache found in the Second Building of Cao Viejo 
(A.D. 300--400). This cache, placed over the floor of a corridor in the summit of the platform, was composed of three wooden clubs without their gilded metallic coverings, organic remains, char­coal, and roofing materials (Franco et al. 1999, 2001). The subsequent recovery of complete, finely crafted clubs in tombs (Franco 2009) indi­cates that these objects were symbols of high so­cial rank and participation in religious and martial ceremonies. Renovation rituals related to the Sec­ond Building of Cao Viejo also included the set­ting of wooden sculptures within structures filled with adobe (Franco et al. 2001; Mujica 2007). A large sculpture representing a human figure with two animal beings above its head was found placed over a level of soil and organic remains covering the floor of a pillared room. It is un­known whether this monument originally stood in the room where it was discovered, but a second wood sculpture representing the head of a bird of prey was found nearby. In both cases, the place­ment of the sculptures was preceded by the re­moval of metal coverings. 
Several caches recovered in Platform I at Huaca de la Luna also suggest the performance of renovation-related religious practices intended to propitiate the foundation of new structures. Excavations in Unit 16 at Platform I revealed several adobe receptacles within the fill of a room complex from Buildings B and C. These features were filled in with organic remains, metallic re­galia, and ceramic objects, with a special cache of gilded copper diadems and ornaments located over the uppermost row of adobe blocks sealing the sector (Zavaleta 2005:49-52, 55, 2006: 19­27, Figure 6). Another adobe receptacle contained a ceramic mask, guinea pig (Cavia porcellus) bones, and organic remains (Zavaleta 2005:51­52, Figure 67). Given the artistic quality and the ideological and economical values inherent to some of the offered materials, these acts can be 
considered a manifestation of the symbolic ap­propriation of meaningful loci by particular elite groups (Figure 4). The nature of the materials

found in caches from Cao Viejo and Huaca de la Luna also indicate that the architectural renova­tions were preceded by activities such as the ma­nipulation of high-prestige items, the dismantling of roofs, and, possibly, ritual meals. 
At the Old Temple at Huaca de la Luna, Build­ing D (dated around A.D. 400-450) is the first construction stage that provides evidence of ar­chitectural remodeling. Niches, columns, and roofs in the main court were intentionally de­stroyed prior to completely filling the building (Montoya 1997:26-27). The transition between Building C and Building B did not involve a ma­jor process of infilling, but rather the extension of existent structures in the so-called Upper Sector (Tufinio 2006:Figures 9-10). Renewal of that area resulted in the physical destruction of some previously extant mural decorations from Build­ing C (Mackey and Hastings 1982; Morales 2003:Figure 14.13). 
This is not an isolated example of the partial destruction of imagery at Huaca de la Luna. Dur­ing the Building C occupation period, the main court of the platform was decorated with relief depictions of the faces of divinities (Uceda 2001:53-55; Uceda et al. 1994:271-274). During the construction of Building B, some friezes on 
the north wall were shattered and were subse­quently plastered and painted white (Uceda and Tufinio 2003:208, Figure 20.19). Similarly, at Cao Viejo the covering of the Second Building by later architecture involved the partial removal of clay reliefs covering the front side of the south­east comer room at the summit of the platform (Franco et al. 2001, 2004:168; Mujica 2007:116, 118-119). In this case, the faces of two large im­ages of a fanged god were shattered and taken apart from the supporting wall when the structure was filled with adobe (Figure 5). 
Excavations in Moche public buildings suggest that particular procedures characterized every episode of the covering of decorated walls. At the Old Temple of Huaca de la Luna, relief faces in the east side of the Building D courtyard were carefully covered with adobe blocks, receiving almost no damage. A section of the east side of the main courtyard of Building C presents reliefs that were destroyed beyond recognition or com-

pletely removed from the wall, while on the south side of the same patio, the friezes are preserved in good condition (Figure 6). A late repercussion of the partial destruction of the friezes in Building C can be detected in Tomb 2, a funerary chamber located in the fill between Buildings A and B-C. This burial of a high priest contained the fragment of a polychrome frieze depicting a god face in the style of the Building C patio. This element was placed beneath the cane coffin during the mortuary rituals (Uceda 1997: 178). 
An important but unclear aspect of the data on southern Moche consecratory practices is the low frequency of offering contexts in architectural settings that include the body parts of domestic camelids. This contrasts with the recurrence of these animals in Moche funerary contexts from the Lambayeque to Santa Valleys (Goepfert 2010). In the sites reviewed here, as well as in other Moche settlements with public architecture such as El Castillo de Santa, Mocollope, and Pafiamarca, the evidence of offerings of animals in monumental buildings are scarce or absent, al­though this situation may change with additional excavations. The exceptions are the Mango I site (Giersz 2011) and, for the northern Moche region, Pampa Grande (Haas 1985), where sacrificed camelids were part of dedicatory offerings in pa­tios and platforms. It is worth mentioning the dis­covery by Swenson (2012:16) of offerings of a dog and a guinea pig in a ritually terminated cer­emonial structure identified at Huaca Colorada, Jequetepeque Valley. 
Found in tombs and caches, Spondylus princeps and Co nus fergusoni equatorial shells were cere­monial items relatively common at northern Moche sites (Alva and Donnan 1993; Cordy­Collins 2003; Haas 1985; Chapdelaine et al. 2009:186). Nonetheless, these tropical shells are not particularly abundant in southern Moche fu­nerary and architectural contexts, and are com­pletely absent in tombs from Cao Viejo and Hua­cas de Moche. The number of publications mentioning southern Moche contexts for camelid and tropical shells offerings in built spaces is no­tably small, especially when we consider the higher frequency of these materials during the Chimu period (A. D. 1000-1450) (Pillsbury 1996). 
Burning and closing of accesses are two pos­sible Moche termination behaviors. Excavations at the main plaza of Huaca de la Luna in 1999 revealed that the north portal had been blocked by an adobe wall crudely plastered on the outside, an element that contributed to isolating the plaza from the surrounding areas (Armas et al. 2004:84, 92). Although there are currently no radiocarbon dates for this event, it seems to mark the aban­donment of the precinct around A.D. 650 (Uceda and Morales 2009:91-107). At the comer room of the same plaza, Moche and Chimu offerings have been recovered (Tufinio 2007). Data from

the Santa Valley shows evidence for the sealing of doorways into public spaces in a settlement coeval with Huacas de Moche. At Huaca Tem­bladera, the entrances to a massive ramp and to a storage area on the west side of the platform were found blocked by unplastered walls built by the latest Moche occupants of the settlement (Chapdelaine 20ll:Figure 16). It is worth men­tioning that the excavation of the latest architec­tural phases of Moche domestic compounds at the nearby Cerro Temblador sector also revealed sealed doorways. 
Excavations at Huaca Chica in Guadalupito focused on its northwest courtyard (Chapdelaine 2011 :Figure 19). The main portal was found blocked with an unplastered adobe wall (Figure 7), which retained non-stratified soil fill containing fragments of Moche vessels and Wari-style poly­chrome wares (Chapdelaine 2010b: Figure 12.3). This deposit can be interpreted as evidence for an event of termination and abandonment in which the entrance to the ceremonial court was closed and sherds of high-quality local and foreign-pro­duced ceramics were scattered through the fill. The secondary entrance to the courtyard was also found blocked with an unplastered adobe wall. 
Other evidence from Guadalupito corresponds to burning events carried out next to special struc­tures and accesses. The main patio of Huaca Chica presented on its eastern side a peculiar structure with steps on two sides. The west and north sides of the bench and surrounding floor areas contained evidence of a burning event dur­ing which the plaster was reddened by the com­bustion of organic materials (Figure 8). The west fa9ade of Huaca Chica also showed evidence of burning near the blocked main portal, with sec­tions of wall plaster and floor reddened by a fire that happened before a rainy period. The fill over both burning features indicated those areas were left uncovered and open to the accumulation of sediments and debris.

The Practices of Architectural Consecration in Southern Moche Public Buildings 
The available evidence suggests that Moche ar­chitectural consecration behaviors should be un­derstood as activities associated with stages of renewal and termination rather than of dedica­tional character. Despite the recognizable bias in the sample, there is the possibility of recognizing patterned activities associated with particular mo­ments in the construction sequences of platforms and plazas. 
Liminal Rites and Material 
Integrity of Architectural Decoration 
Research on the architectural sequences of public and residential architecture in the precolumbian Americas has defined patterns of physical in­tegrity for materials used in the ritual consecration of public monuments and buildings, with differ­ence in the treatment given to offered materials during foundational dedications and terminations 
(Garber 1983; Walker 1998). In the case of the 
Moche, artifacts, organic materials, and human bodies recorded in dedicatory caches and termi­nation contexts at Huaca de la Luna and Cao Viejo were found in either complete or fragmen­tary condition. Animal offerings recorded for foundational ritual practices at Cao Viejo and Mango I stand as evidence for a possible pattern of deposition of complete materials during dedi­cation rites. Despite these lines of evidence, the southern Moche consecratory events do not reveal a clear-cut difference between dedication and ter­mination contexts in relation to the integrity of items used. 
Even as the database on Moche and early Mid­dle Horizon (A.D. 700-900) buildings with wall decoration has expanded significantly in recent years, the known examples of intentional destruc­tion of murals do not seem to correspond to an­cient vandalism but to the renewal or termination of ceremonial spaces. The filling in of decorated walls at Huaca de la Luna and Cao Viejo demon­strates the efforts made to protect the integrity of the ceremonial spaces being buried, an attitude that can be interpreted as a maintained respect toward their symbolism. Walls decorated with friezes and mural paintings were in some cases cut through or plastered over during a later occu­
pation, which indicates that the design and aes­
thetics of ceremonial architecture could be sig­nificantly modified when changes in the meaning and experience of a space required it. An out­standing example of this renovation practice is the partial destruction of murals in the northwest

comer room of the Second Building of Cao Viejo, beside which were discovered the burials of the "Dama de Cao" and her companions (Mujica 2007:210-211). The decorated north exterior fa­cade of that structure was cut to make room for a pair of large niches probably used to contain of­ferings and mortuary paraphernalia for the nearby tombs-an action that resulted in the partial de­struction of six of the eight squares containing painted images of a divine character (Figure 9). In this case, the asymmetrical modification of the decorated wall would have displayed the new meaning acquired by the chamber during the mor­tuary rites conducted in the patio. The importance of the niches in ceremonial courtyards of later precolumbian socieLies in northern Peru is noted by Moore (1996:134-135), who, based on eth­nohistorical data, suggests that they were used for the placement of offerings and body parts of sacrificed animals. 
Demonstrating another facet of Moche con­cepts of integrity of images and buildings, the re­covery in a priestly tomb at Huaca de la Luna of a clay face extracted from a frieze panel indicates that icons recovered from terminated buildings were occasionally preserved. The defacing of vi­sual representations was not limited to architec­
tural termination. Metallic mortuary masks de­picting human and supernatural faces could be subject to the extraction of one inlaid shell eye (Campana 1999; Donnan 2008), a practice that Bourget (2006:56-57) argued reflected an em­phasis in Moche ideology on representing the tran­sition between complete and incomplete natures (something seen, for example, in ceramic vessels portraying one-eyed and mutilated individuals). Regarding the reasons for the occasional destruc­tion of reliefs at Huaca de la Luna and Cao Viejo, it is possible to propose that this behavior was occasionally performed to represent the liminal condition of images representing supernatural en­tities during the burial of architecture and, as seen above, in association with changes in the sym­bolism of the building. Why this behavior was not performed on a larger number of wall decora­tions is not clear, but it could be linked to historical processes particular to each ceremonial center, as the case of Cao Viejo suggests.4

tion and termination of ceremonial public spaces: 
a group of individuals sacrificed during the aban­
donment of the plaza of Cao Viejo around A.D. 
600, the wooden human sculpture from Cao Viejo 
placed in horizontal position before the Second 
Building was filled in, and the offering of a cer­
emonial shield recovered in Platform II at Pafia­
marca, Nepefia Valley, dating to around AD. 650. 
This last artifact, excavated by the author and 
Lisa Trever during the 2010 season of the Pafia­
marca Project (Trever et al. 2013), was found 
within a decorated niche covered with adobes 
dating from an early phase of the constructive 
sequence of the building. 
These contexts provide evidence of a regional 
pattern of ceremonial termination that involved 
as a central episode the offering of artifacts and 
human bodies placed in inverted position and 
covered beneath intentional filling. The face­
down position of materials can be interpreted as 
a means to materialize the passing of symbolically 
charged objects into the condition of unseen or 
hidden entities. After A.D. 800, Tanguche and 
Early Chimu peoples popularized the use of ce­
ramic offerings in inverted position during mor­
tuary rites, placing mold-pressed bowls on the 
cranium of the deceased during the burial process 
(Donnan and Mackey 1978:242-251). 
Human Sacrifice and Termination Activities 
Some examples of Moche termination rites come from walled plazas. The termination of the plaza of Cao Viejo involved human sacrifices and burial activities in its southeast sector. Excavations con­ducted in 1993 revealed the incomplete and dis­articulated remains of several individuals buried inside a large cavity breaking the floor of the plaza (Franco et al. 2001:151, 153-154, 2003). This cavity was covered with sediment and eroded adobes, and the plaza lacked evidence for subsequent constructive activities by the Moche. The context included the incomplete and disar­ticulated remains of two children, a young adult, and two adults, some subjected to special peri­mortem and postmortem treatment. For example, one child was buried near a ramp in extended position, facing downwards, and with a fracture on the upper right side of the skull. The body po­sition and the cranial trauma indicate that this in­dividual was sacrificed, with postmortem removal 
of the left femur. Nearby the articulated upper 
body of an adult was found, also face down, with 
its arms in an unusual position. Partial remains 
of a vulture and two incomplete bodies of canids 
(Regulo Franco, personal communication 2014) 
were found as part of this complex ritual of sac­
rifice and body manipulation. 
The contexts identified at the plaza of Cao 
Viejo stand as evidence of a termination process 
that included the sacrifice of young and adult hu­
mans and the dismantling of structures. Other 
data suggest that sacrificial behavior during south­
ern Moche terminations was not limited to public 
monumental buildings. Rituals comparable to 
those from the plaza of Cao Viejo, although on a 
smaller scale, were enacted in Residential Com­
pound 9 at Huacas de Moche, where a young 
woman killed by a blow to the head was buried 
without any ceramic vessels in a room that was 
subsequently sealed (Chapdelaine 2004:180, 183, 
2008:74). In yet another case of ritual termination 
of ceremonial spaces, recent excavations at Huaca 
Colorada, Jequetepeque Valley, revealed the de­
position of human bodies-some of individuals 
who suffered intentional death-and animals in 
the architectural public settings of that northern 
Moche community (Swenson 2012:15-16, Fig­
ures 4, 5b; Swenson and Warner 2012:329-330). 
It should be mentioned that for later precolumbian 
periods there are references of human dedicatory 
and sacrificial burials associated with the creation 
of architectural spaces, for example, in the cere­
monial and administrative buildings of Batan 
Grande, La Leche Valley (Shimada 1990:341, 
Figure 25). 
Burning of Architectural Features 
and Closing of Accesses 
Although it could be argued that fires such as those observed in the monumental buildings of Guadalupito do not necessarily indicate ritual ac­tivity, it should be noted that these features were associated with special architectural components and occurred directly over the last occupational floors. The burning events recorded at Guadalupito seem to reflect a type of termination behavior rec­ognized elsewhere in the North Coast. At Pacat­namu, Jequetepeque Valley, a room containing Late Mochica ceramics also preserved evidence of libation, the deposition of human bodies and

camelid bones, and incineration of valued com­modities. These features are interpreted as part of a consecratory ceremony (Cordy-Collins 1997: 288). Additional data on burning events associated with ceremonial architecture comes from one of the early buildings of Cao Viejo, for which Franco et al. (2003: 146) mention the presence of rooms with traces of fire. Information recently published for the Middle Horizon site of Cerro La Cruz, Chao Valley (Vogel 20 12:94, 141-145) reveals that the settlement abandonment was marked by the planned and extensive burning of residential and public buildings, increasing our reference base for the relationship between termination processes and burning events, and at the same time indicat­ing local differences in the practice and meaning of incinerations. 
The closing of accesses is relatively common in North Coast archaeological sites of the first millennium A.D., having been recorded in Huaca Colorada, Huancaco, and Plataforma Uhle at Hua­cas de Moche (Swenson 2012). The blocking of doorways does not appear to have been carried out only as a practical gesture to prevent entry into a public space. On the contrary, the contexts of Guadalupito and Huaca de la Luna suggest that the closing of the accesses was associated with the ceremonial termination and intended isolation of public buildings. Concerning Guadalupito, the combined burning and closure of access ways into main buildings support the argument of a planned withdrawal from built environments symbolizing authority, a process that included the accomplish­ment of particular ritual and practical activities. The abandonment process of Guadalupito also shows different features from those observed dur­ing the fall of Pampa Grande (Lambayeque Valley) around A.D. 750. At Pampa Grande, the aban­donment event was marked by the selective de­struction of ceremonial and elite settings, espe­cially those at the summit of Huaca Fortaleza (Shimada 1994:247-248). 
Final Remarks 
The analysis of data on architectural sequences offers the opportunity to identify a set of social behaviors directly related to the creation, renewal, and termination of ancient built environments. In the past decades these kinds of processes have not received systematic attention, but are fre­quently overlooked as part of a general approach to ancient cultural dynamics. Previously, much of the evidence now recognized as indicators of consecratory behavior was registered as "waste layers" or "evidence of squatters." Nonetheless, current improvements in recording techniques and a broader anthropological approach reveal the importance that research on the organization and meaning of architectural consecration prac­tices acquires in our understanding of Moche conceptions of time, space, and materiality. 
There is a growing set of evidence for behav­ioral patterns associated with the foundation, re­newal, and abandonment of public buildings. At Huaca de la Luna and Cao Viejo, and also at Huaca Colorada and Pafiamarca, a cycle of phys­ical and symbolic transformations of the ritual space seems to have occurred during the use of each building. The stages of creation, change, and termination of the architectural space at these ceremonial complexes involved the intentional covering or destruction of mural icons, the place­ment of offerings on floors and in caches, the de­position of inverted effigies, and human and ani­mal sacrifice. The termination activities carried out at the platforms of Guadalupito focused on controlled burnings carried out near conspicuous architectural features and on the sealing of entryways-activities that symbolized withdrawal from the main buildings. Foundational dedica­tions have yet to be reported at Guadalupito. 
As we have seen, among the ancient Moche some acts of architectural termination appear linked to the dedication of construction activities, becoming ritual gestures potentially intended both to celebrate the past and to promote the renovation of a built space. Votive contexts found at some of the platforms discussed here designate the burying of an old structure and the beginning of a new construction project as times for per­formances aimed at propitiating the physical reenactment of the sacred precincts. Our current level of knowledge of Moche public architecture and ideology does not permit us to associate these ritual activities with the celebration of cal­endrical cycles. Instead, the available evidence points toward the association of events of dedi­cation, renewal, and termination with political changes and responses to natural phenomena.

The identification of ceremonial practices as­sociated with the architectural growth of southern Moche buildings supports the assumption that early Andean built spaces were thought of as im­bued with animate identities (Swenson 2012: 16­17). Moc he architectural consecrations can be considered an early manifestation of the late pre­columbian and modem belief in the enqa or ca­maquen, the vital force that can arise, be con­tained, and be manipulated to produce welfare and animal fertility (Bray 2009; Flores 1977; Taylor 2000). In a general sense, ritual propitia­tions enacted in the monumental architecture of the Peruvian north coast between A.D. 300 and 800 can be compared with the pagapu propitia­tory practices known through historical sources and ethnography (Nachtigall 1975; Tomoeda 1994). Nonetheless, in spite of their apparent conceptual and symbolic relationship with mod­em Andean dedications, consecration practices conducted in Moche public buildings differed from the pagapus not only by their chronological precedence but also by their nature as events ar­ticulating religion, time, public, and scenery on a larger scale (DeMarrais et al. 1996:24-26). Southern Moche architectural consecrations also appear different from those of Chimu society, which developed in the north coast between the tenth and fifteenth centuries A .D. In view of the available evidence, it is possible to assume that the placing of sacrificed camelids and Spondylus shells was not a recurring component of the ded­ications and terminations of the southern Moche area, a situation that apparently began to change after A.D. 700. 
Moche art does not show explicit represen­tations of consecratory acts as those discussed here. The main difficulty in identifying these practices in the iconography is that images do not show unfinished buildings or places in the process of construction (see Wiersema 2012). Does this exclude the consecration of public spaces from the Moche pictorial corpus? Per­haps we should appreciate the painted and mod­eled architectural representations from new per­spectives, considering that some scenes could have been created to celebrate the initial conse­cration or the termination of an edifice. Given the importance to the Moc he of the creation and use of spaces aimed for social interaction and ideological negotiations, this possibility should continue to be investigated. 
Who were those responsible for the perfor­mance of consecration rituals in the monumental Moche built spaces? The practices discussed here had different goals, with each ideological practice possibly related to the status, role, and purposes of people in charge of the rites. At Huaca de la Luna and Cao Viejo, architectural dedication, re­modeling, and termination rituals would have been conducted by rulers and priestly officials, and these practices marked transitional periods in the long-term existence of ceremonial compounds. At Guadalupito the termination ceremonies were possibly executed under the direction of local leaders within a programmed withdrawal from their political stages. In each of these sites the dedication, renovation, and termination cere­monies should also have had repercussions for the broad population of craft specialists and com­moners, groups whose role in the development of the Moche ideological system and structures of power and authority has yet to be fully evaluated (see Lohse 2007 for a discussion on this topic). Additionally, different processes of termination and abandonment of monumental edifices at Moche capitals present a challenge for scholars who, beside identifying the causal factors for the transformation of specific political institutions and ideologies, must take into consideration how the social memory of regional peoples interlinked with the perception and use of physical remains of the past (Stanton and Magnani 2008:5). 
Without doubt, the recording and analysis of evidence for Moche ceremonial conduct associ­ated with the creation of built spaces will broaden our understanding of the ideology and organiza­tion of that society. As demonstrated in this paper, the careful recording of the remains of consecra­tory ceremonies and the increase of comparative information on those rituals and associated prac­tices is crucial to improving our understanding of the function and meaning of ancient buildings. At first sight, evidence of burned floors, sealed doors, and defaced friezes can be interpreted as the results of secular activities or accidental events. However, when considered as part of the human experience of built spaces, these contexts provide a particu­larly rich source of information on the nature of precolumbian public architecture.

Notes 
1. 
Pagapu rituals are usually carried out in open areas and courtyards . Offerings can include vessels, foodstuff, coca leaves, corn beer, and conopas or illas (small stone animal sculptures). 

2. 
Uceda (1997) considered the incomplete human remains found within adobe chambers at Platform I to be offerings linked to the renovation of the temple. 

3. 
Andean cases of urban planning based on principles of cosmological representation and sacred landscape are analyzed by Zuidema (1 964) and Sakai (1998), among others . 

4. 
The systematic recording of the destruction of faces and other body parts of characters represented in Moche friezes and murals may provide major illumination in this regard (see Houston et al. 2006:76 and O'Neil 2013 for references on the mutilation of images in Classic Maya sculpture).
