QUEST FOR THE ORIGINS AND IMPLICATIONS 
FOR SOCIAL RIGHTS OF THE MAPUCHE 
IN THE SOUTHERN CONE OF SOUTH AMERICA 

Tom D. Dillehay and Francisco Rothhammer 
Debates over the cultural and biological origins of some indigenous groups in the Americas have fueled discussions about cultural identity, political justice, and resource rights. A historically high-profile case of rights and origins has involved the Araucanians or Mapuche of the southern cone of South America. This article examines, for the first time, the recent interdisciplinary archaeological and other anthropological evidence for the Mapuche of Chile and Argentina. It suggests that the ethnic and territorial origin of the Mapuche is in central and south-central Chile, although biological and cultural influences from north Chile and western Argentina also are present. It briefly discusses the implication of this study in rela­tion to the indigenous status of the Mapuche in present-day Chile and Argentina. 
Los debates sobre los origenes culturales y biol6gicos de algunos grupos etnicos indigenas en America han conllevado a la discusi6n en torno a cuestiones tales como la identidad cultural, la justicia politica, y los derechos sobre los recursos. Un hist6rico e importante caso sobre los los origenes y los derechos de grupos indigenas ha sido el de las comunidades arau­canas o mapuches en el cono sur de America de! Sur. Este articulo analiza desde una perspectiva interdisciplinaria, la evi­dencia tanto arqueol6gica como antropo/6gica referente a /os mapuches de Chile y Argentina. Se concluye que el origen etnico y territorial de! pueblo mapuche estd en Chile central y centro-sur, a pesar de algunas influencias biol6gicas y culturales del norte de Chile y Argentina. La implicaci6n de estos hallazgos se discute brevemente en cuanto a la condici6n social de los mapuches en Chile y Arfientina hoy dia. 
n the study of indigenous groups in the Amer­Iicas, a major issue concerns origins and initial cultural development. Interest in explaining the original territory and geographic expansion of these groups relates to differentiating them through dis­tinct historical and cultural processes and to a close examination of their contemporary ethnic status (Dean and Levi 2003; Hunefeldt and Sussex 2011). Today, all indigenous people live in socially com­plex, multilayered nation-states. They often have the burden of seeing their cultural perspectives romanticized or denigrated, and their ethnic status usually is such that they are disempowered to argue against how their image and resources are exploited within the state. At the same time, through today's globalized media and institutions, many groups are finding new sources of empowerment, one of which is reconsideration of their rights as pueblos 
originarios or the first people of the land (see Boc­cara and Bolados 2008; Haughney 2006). Despite these sources, most indigenous people still strug­gle with social justice, for full recognition of their ethnic identities and rights, and with the politics of resource and territorial control. There are many reasons for these injustices (Brysk 2000). One is that indigenous ethnicity often is seen as the prod­uct of European conquest and colonialism, whereby different groups fragmented by warfare came together to defend their territories, often resulting in no or only partial recognition of their original lands. Other reasons relate to relations of power, racism, and class struggles. In this article, we dis­cuss the interdisciplinary cultural and biological data that link the late prehistoric and historic Mapuche people to the Araucania region of south­central Chile and central Argentina along the bor-

We hope that the data and discus­sion presented here, which are representative of long-term historical processes, will be utilized by scholars to continue to more accurately define the Mapuche ethnic collective as a subject of social rights in Chile and Argentina. 
For the Mapuche, or Reche, Aucas, and Arau­canians, as they were called during different his­toric times, there have been a number of hypotheses on their origins-however, without a clear con­sensus and understanding. There has been general consensus as to where their historic original ten-i­tory was located and where the routes of external influence and ethnic expansion during the sixteenth

to nineteenth centuries (e.g., Barros Arana 1909; Bengoa 2003; Cooper 1946; Latcham 1924, 1928b; Menghin 1962) passed. Archaeologists have gen­erally viewed the ethnic culture of the Mapuche as beginning among the indigenous hunters and gath­erers of the late pre-Hispanic period in south-cen­tral Chile (e.g., Mostny 1971; Willey 1971). Other scholars have pondered the extent to which this cul­ture developed through the migration and diffusion of peoples from regions to the north in central Chile and to the east in Argentina and perhaps in the lower Amazon basin (Aldunate 1989; Dillehay 1990a; Menghin 1962). Although most of these perspectives were based on scarce data and tradi­tional models of diffusion and migration, they are still valid for suggesting geographic vectors of pop­ulation movement and culture contact and influ­ence. Most historians, on the other hand, have viewed the Mapuche as an amalgamation of scat­tered groups that ethnically formed in the sixteenth century to resist the European conquest (e.g., Boc­cara 1998, 1999, 2002; Goicovich 2002, 2006; Villalobos and Pinto 1988; Zavala 2000). As Boc­cara notes: "the attempts [by the Spanish] to sub­due and colonize south-central Chile produced what we might call a 'perverse' effect in the sense of an unwanted or unexpected result-the birth of a new unit of ethnic identity: the Mapuche" (Boc­cara 1999:6). Given the prior scarcity of archeo­logical and biological data on the late pre-Hispanic Mapuche culture, this view, held by historians, is partly understandable. Most ethnographers also have generalized Mapuche culture history, uncrit­ically accepting the viewpoint of historians and romanticizing the Mapuche as people with only a recent history (c.f., Boccara 1999; Foerster 1993; Zapater 1974). The Mapuche themselves believe they originated in south-central Chile, although a few coastal populations consider their origins to lie to the west across the Pacific Ocean (Dillehay 2002a). A primary reason for the more recent lack of consensus and understanding is that researchers have not taken into account the most recent inter­disciplinary data available on the origins of the Mapuche. 
As presented in the discussion that follows, in the past two decades, numerous archaeological, genetic, bioarchaeological, and linguistic studies have independently provided new insights into the original territory and geographic expansion of the Mapuche. The question now is how these different data sets can be integrated to reach a consensus. Here we review the current state of the evidence and the prospects and possibilities for a better under­standing of the origins of Mapuche culture and eth­nicity. This topic is of special interest because the Mapuche constitute the largest ethnic group in the southern cone of South America; they resisted Euro­pean influence more successfully than most other indigenous people in American history (e.g., Ben­goa 2003; Dillehay 2007; Padden 1993); and their ethnic origins and rights have never been formally defined by scholars and fully recognized by the Chilean and Argentine governments. In Argentina, for instance, the Mapuche are still considered to be extranjeros (foreigners) (Trentini et al. 2010). 
In recent decades, the issue of Mapuche eth­nicity has produced a politicized discourse con­cerned with social and resource rights, which has culminated in contemporary controversies over property rights to original ethnic lands (Carruthers and Rodriguez 2009; Dillehay and Herrera 1993) and to social rights in general. Full recognition of their indigenous rights would likely grant the Mapuche more direct control over their resources and lands (Anonymous 1993, 2008; Haughney 2006; Mariman 2003). Politicized though it may be, the discourse of rights in both Chile and Argentina has adhered strongly to the objectivist conception of historical claims and privileges. This is necessary, given the goal of defining indigenous rights as an entity subject to statutory recognition and framed within Chilean and Argentine laws. The Mapuche case, however, makes clear what is still only dimly perceived in both Chile and Argentina-namely, that the destiny of the major­ity in the state is intimately linked to the fate of the indigenous and other minorities. Before presenting an overview of the interdisciplinary evidence, it is helpful to discuss some fundamental ethnographic characteristics of the contemporary Mapuche. Fur­thermore, the vast majority of the Mapuche today live in south-central Chile, with a small population of roughly 25 ,000 residing across the international border in Argentina. Although the Mapuche prob­ably had some origins in Argentina, we focus our study primarily in Chile. 
Due to space limitations, a detailed presentation and critique of the data specific to each discipline is not possible (Dillehay 2007). Thus, for our pur-

pose, a summary of the major recent findings and their implications are discussed and compared. Each discipline has its advantages and disadvan­tages in providing information on ethnic origins. For instance, ethnography relies primarily on oral traditions and historical records, which do not extend far enough back in time to reliably address late pre-Hispanic affiliations. However, as dis­cussed later, the presence of certain surviving social and religious beliefs and symbols can be hypothe­sized to historically relate to Andean and perhaps tropical lowland societies farther north and north­west, respectively. The historical archives are most useful for establishing late pre-Hispanic and early Hispanic population movements, biological link­ages, and cultural exchange relations, but these too are biased because they primarily focus on mili­tary, theological, and organizational issues of con­cern to the Spanish Crown, and they generally discuss specific periods and places and thus are lim­ited in terms of general coverage and circumstance. The linguistic record also is biased and confined to a relatively short timeframe, reliably extending back no further than a few hundred years before the Spanish invasion. Furthermore, little work has been carried out on the origin of the Mapuche lan­guage and its affiliates. While archaeology has the advantage of a deep time perspective and of relat­ing the migration and diffusion of people and ideas to the spread of selected material traits, it too is lim­ited due to little research on proto-Mapuche and early Mapuche sites and on interpretative biases of the origin and meaning of local and exotic mater­ial culture. The biological data are particularly important for linking cranial morphology and sourcing genetic signatures, but the database is scarce and the demographic history of modem and ancient biological data generally are not well doc­umented and thus often speculative as to the place and time of origin of archaeological skeletal pop­ulations. Due to sampling biases and different cul­tural or biological patterns inferred from each discipline, the advantages of each must be com­bined to reconsider ethnic and biological origins within a wide spatial and temporal setting. 
The Ethnographic Perspective 
This brief ethnographic description of the Mapuche is meant to highlight some of the fundamental prac­
tices of these people today. Although there have been profound historical changes in their society over the past 500 years, there still are some basic characteristics of the traditional Mapuche lifeway that have not been completely affected by these changes-for instance, kinship ideologies, general land use and subsistence patterns, ethnic identity, and relations to the Chilean and Argentine states (Carruthers and Rodriguez 2009; Dillehay 2007; Stuchlik 197 6; Trentini et al. 2010). The geography, environmental features, and natural resources that encouraged their way of life, as well as their reli­gious beliefs and ceremonies, have been less sub­ject to historical and evolutionary changes in some areas, especially in isolated or marginal environ­ments of the Andes and the Pacific coastal cordillera. Today, the Mapuche number between six and seven hundred thousand and are the largest indige­nous group in southern South America. They were and still are a patrilineal, patrilocal, and bilateral society that resides in dispersed communities or reducciones (c.f., Faron 1962, I 964; Titiev I 951 ). In the anthropological literature, the historical Mapuche are best known as mixed economists of pinon collectors in the Andean highlands (also the Pehuenche) and fisherfolk, hunters, gatherers, and horticulturalists in the central valley and foothills of the Andes in Chile and Argentina and along the Chilean Pacific coast. Past political organization was characterized by small to large autonomous chiefdoms, except in times of war with the Span­ish and Chileans, when more formally semi-cen­tralized political units formed to defend their lands. It was not until the end of the nineteenth century that the Mapuche were defeated by the Chilean and Argentine armies and confined to indigenous lands (Bengoa 2003) where they have since suffered var­ious atrocities and loss of social and resource rights. It is important to note that there are external cul­tural traits in the historic and contemporary ethno­graphic culture that are late pre-Hispanic Andean and possibly tropical lowland (e.g., Dillehay I 990b; Latcham 1928a, 1928b; Menghin 1962). Andean and perhaps lowland influences are suggested in the dual spatial and political organization of Mapuche political and religious space; in Mapuche art and iconography of ceramics, wooden statues, and textiles; and in Mapuche myths, tales, and leg­ends (Casamiquela 1960; Dillehay 1992b, 1998, I 999b, 2007; Gonzalez I 998; Latcham 1924;
