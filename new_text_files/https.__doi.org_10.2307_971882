AN INITIAL CONSIDERATION OF OBSIDIAN PROCUREMENT AND 
EXCHANGE IN PREHISPANIC ECUADOR 

Richard L. Burger, Frank Asaro, Helen V. Michel, Fred H. Stross, and Ernesto Salazar 
We have examined the role of long-distance trade in Prehispanic Ecuador using X-ray fluorescence (XRF) and neutron-activation analysis (NAA) of obsidian artifacts from the archaeological sites of El Inga, Chobshi Cave and Site OGSE-46 on the Santa Elena Peninsula. Results indicate that two geological sources east of Quito, Yanaurco-Quiscatola and Mullumica, were the principal source of raw obsidian at these sites. We situate our findings within a broader archaeological context through a review of the literature and a discussion of an earlier provenience study undertaken by us. We express concerns about recent attempts to apply ethnohistoric models to early periods of Ecuadorian prehistory, and argue that despite early exploitation of the principal obsidian sources, long-distance trade in obsidian was initiated at a relatively late date and remained at a surprisingly low level in southern Ecuador during most of prehistory.

Expresamos preocupaci6n acerca de los recientes intentos de aplicar modelos etnohist6ricos a los perfodos tempranos de la prehistoria ecuatoriana, y planteamos que, a pesar de la explotaci6n muy temprana de la obsidiana en ambas canteras, el comercio de obsidiana a gran distancia se inici6 en fechas relativamente tardfas, permaneciendo sorpresivamente a un bajo nivel de intensidad en el sur de Ecuador durante una gran parte de la prehistoria. 
Long-distance trade has occupied center stage almost from the initiation of archaeological studies in Ecuador. Jij6n y Caamano ( 1941-194 7), the dominant figure in the developmental years of Ecuadorian archaeology, wrote eloquently about a Prehispanic "league of merchants" that sponsored lengthy voyages along the coast of western South America and Middle America in their balsa-wood watercraft. Like many later investigators, Jij6n y Caamano was strongly influenced by sixteenth­and seventeenth-century historical documents that describe indigenous maritime activity off the shores of Ecuador and Colombia (Samano-Xerez 1968 (1524]; cf. J. Estrada 1990). Subsequent scholars have sustained interest in long-distance exchange by demonstrating cultural similarities between ancient Ecuador and the Prehispanic cultures of Mesoamerica and Peru that are presumed to be the result of direct contact between these two areas (e.g., Anawalt 1992; Coe 1960; Evans and Meggers 1966; Grove 1982; Hosler et al. 1990; Lathrap 1966; Lathrap et al. 1975; West 1961). After reading Betty Meggers's synthesis of Ecuadorian archaeology, one reviewer concluded that what makes the societies of prehistoric Ecuador so intriguing is the intensive and long-term contact they maintained with Mesoamerica, Colombia, and Peru (Coe 1967). More recently, scholars have traced the ancient trade in Spondylus shell from the Ecuadorian shoreline to Peru and beyond (Marcos 1977-1978, 1980; Paulsen 1974, 1977). The excavations at La Plata Island and Salango

have confirmed the great antiquity of maritime sailing technology, and have shed light on the production and storage of goods for subsequent long-distance transport (Marcos and Norton 1981; Norton 1984). 
Although it was the trading activities of Prehispanic coastal groups that originally attracted attention to the role of exchange in prehistoric Ecuador, colonial accounts of highland peoples in the Quito area have underscored this emphasis. According to Salomon (1977-1978, 1986), spe­cialized traders, called mindalaes, were commissioned by chiefs to procure exotic sumptuary goods for high-status individuals. These merchants, analogous in some respects to the pochteca of the Aztecs, have been interpreted as functioning within an archaic economic institution indigenous to the Northern Andes that provided highland groups with essential and highly valued foreign items critical to the functioning of chiefly organization. In the early sixteenth century, these hereditary traders maintained extensive formalized commercial networks that connected the coast, highlands, and montafia and linked the patchwork of small-scale political units into which the Northern Andes were divided. 
There is also documentary evidence of interzonal exchange by nonspecialists in market places (tiangueces) for the barter of commodities (Hartmann 1971; Salomon 1986), as well as the apparent use of special purpose hatchet-shaped copper currency known as axe-monies, recovered in large quantities by archaeologists in Ecuador, West Mexico, and the extreme northern coast of Peru (Holm 1967; Hosler et al. 1990). The mercantile mode ofinterzonal articulation present in late Prehispanic Ecuador has been widely viewed as representing a distinctive northern Andean economic logic, one that contrasted with the nonmarket organizational principles of the Central Andes (Murra 197 5; Salomon 1977-1978). Salomon (1986: 186) sees this mercantile mode as having great historical depth, and as having been too fundamental for the Inka conquerors to dismantle completely during their brief reign. 
The view that long-distance exchange was the key feature of ancient Ecuadorian cultures has had a profound influence on recent writings on Ecuadorian archaeology. This impact is evident, for example, in a synthesis of northern Andean archaeology by Feldman and Moseley (1983:143, 146). They argue that during much of prehistory the Ecuadorian area comprised a series of independent nodes interconnected by wide-ranging trade networks; this pattern, in their opinion, should be viewed as a cultural response to northern Andean environmental diversity, in which the landscape is composed of small, fragmented ecological zones. 
Although documentary evidence leaves little doubt that long-distance trade was an important factor in the economies of some portions of late prehistoric Ecuador, can we presume that it was also significant in much earlier societies, such as those of the Formative or Regional Developmental Period (Doyon 1988; Feldman and Moseley 1983:159; Marcos 1980; Paulsen 1974, 1977; Villalba 1988:328-329, 36 1-363)? Archaeologists have the tools to determine when mercantile activity first 
emerged as a major force and at what point, if ever, Prehispanic Ecuadorian societies began to engage in significantly more long-distance exchange than did the neighboring societies in Peru. At the present time, however, it remains to be established whether the pattern of merchants and native marketplaces was characteristic of the entire Ecuadorian area even for the late prehistoric period. 
Based on his interpretation of the Colonial documentary evidence, Patterson (1 988) suggests that the mercantile pattern was limited in extent, and perhaps absent altogether from southern Ecuador. On theoretical grounds, he challenges the assumption that the mercantile character of northern Ecuador during Inka times was primarily the result of ecologically adaptive archaic economic arrangements. As an alternative, he proposes that the mercantile mode described for Quito may be understood as a historically contingent response of societies located on the fringe of a vast empire. Rather than simply a reflection of archaic organizational principles, this commercial behavior is viewed as an intentional and innovative activity designed to take advantage of the unique oppor­tunities presented near Tawantinsuyu's northern frontier. 
Ifwe are to avoid the tyranny of the ethnohistoric analogy, we need to use archaeological evidence to evaluate rather than illustrate the models generated from contact-period societies in Ecuador. The organization of pre-Inka cultures of Ecuador may prove to have been significantly different from the kind reported by the early Spanish observers. To begin to understand the role of commerce in

these pre-Inka societies, it will be critical that we trace the sources of exotic artifacts encountered in well-documented archaeological contexts. Unfortunately, the methodological tools that would permit the study of the movement of goods across long distances have only recently begun to be applied to Ecuador's archaeological record. This study offers the final results of a pilot project that has explored the application of provenience analysis to Ecuadorian obsidian artifacts. 
Obsidian studies will not in themselves be a sufficient basis for evaluation of the changing role of long-distance exchange in ancient Ecuador, but they do constitute an effective approach to one frequently mentioned component of this exchange system. The special utility of obsidian for studies of long-distance and local-level exchange has been demonstrated in many parts of the world, and the physical principles that permit the provenience analysis of volcanic glass are well understood. The abundance of obsidian artifacts in some Ecuadorian archaeological sites has been appreciated for some time. In fact, some of the first attempts to establish an absolute chronology for Ecuadorian prehistory were based on obsidian hydration (Evans and Meggers 1960). Pioneering provenience studies of obsidian artifacts were also carried out at the University of California at Los Angeles (Mayer-Oakes 1986:14-15, 32), but they did not result in published chemical characterizations of Ecuadorian obsidian sources or artifacts. 
The present study includes the final results of an elemental analysis utilizing neutron activation (NAA) and X-ray fluorescence (XRF) of 40 obsidian artifacts collected at three archaeological sites in Ecuador: El Inga, Chobshi Cave, and OGSE-46. By drawing upon the analyses of 11 6 obsidian artifacts from 10 other Ecuadorian sites reported in the accompanying study (Asaro et al. 1994) and the existing literature on the distribution of obsidian artifacts in Prehispanic Ecuador, we are able to incorporate the results described here into a more general discussion of changing patterns of obsidian procurement and exchange. Finally, we explore the implications of the conclusions for modeling long-distance exchange in Prehispanic Ecuador. 
GEOLOGICAL SOURCES OF ECUADORIAN OBSIDIAN ARTIFACTS 
In the accompanying study of obsidian from 16 sites in central and northern Ecuador (Asaro et 
al. 1994), 96 percent of 116 Ecuadorian artifacts measured are shown to come from two sources 
east of Quito in the Cordillera Real of northern Ecuador. One, responsible for possibly 75 percent 
of the artifacts measured, is named for the glacial valley of Mullumica, where a large silicic lava 
flow is located (Bigazzi et al. 1992:22-24; Salazar 1980). Mullumica is thought to be a "variable 
source," in which the hot magma appears to have mixed imperfectly with rock of different com­
position and consequently produced obsidian with varied but systematically (linearly) related com­
positions. Such variable sources have been described elsewhere (Bowman et al. 1973), but appear 
to be rare. 
The other major source of archaeological obsidian was sampled at two outcrops 5 km apart on 
Cerro Yanaurco and Loma Quiscatola, only 10 km south of the Mullumica source. Both are breccia 
deposits near the top of an ancient volcanic succession that consists mainly of andesitic lavas (Bigazzi 
et al. 1992:24; Salazar 1980). As shown in the accompanying article (Asaro et al. 1994), the two 
obsidian outcrops are chemically indistinguishable by NAA and XRF and consequently are con­
sidered one homogeneous source referred to here as Yanaurco-Quiscatola. 
A third possible obsidian source has recently been discovered by Salazar (1992:123; see also 
Bigazzi et al. 1992:24) 3 km east of the Mullumica flow. Referred to as the Callejones source, its 
obsidian is chemically distinctive (Frank Asaro and Ernesto Salazar, personal communication 1993), 
but additional analyses are needed to determine whether from a chemical perspective it could be 
related to the Mullumica source. Callejones does not appear to have been as intensively exploited 
as Mullumica and Yanaurco-Quiscatola, and it has yet to be identified as the source of Prehispanic 
artifacts. Other geologic deposits of obsidian exist in Ecuador, but most were not appropriate for 
the production of artifacts. This appears to be the case with El Tabl6n, a large lava flow on the west 
flank of the Cordillera Real, which consists of perlitized obsidian bedded with completely hydrated 
material (Bigazzi et al. 1992:24). 
In summary, the most important geological deposits of obsidian utilized in Prehispanic Ecuador 
were clustered in a small section of the Guamani highlands in northern Ecuador. The three known

obsidian sources are located within 15 km of each other at high elevations between 3900-4200 m asl. Secondary deposits of obsidian blocks sometimes appear nearby at slightly lower elevations downstream, as in the case of Rodeo Corrales, located 4 km from Cerro Yanaurco. 
PROVENIENCE ANALYSIS OF OBSIDIAN ARTIFACTS 
Sample Preparation 
The preparation of the samples for NAA is the same as described by Asaro et al. (198la). For the XRF measurements encapsulated pills were prepared, as described by Asaro et al. (198la), for five samples (BUR-55,-56,-57 ,-68, and-59). Other XRF determinations were carried out nonde­structively. 
Measurements 
X-ray Fluorescence. The XRF methods used have been described in the reports cited. It should be remembered that in using the nondestructive XRF procedure, sample thickness and shape affect the measured abundance values, which consequently are not as accurate as those obtained when the samples are ground and fashioned into pills of well-defined dimensions. The errors resulting from the nondestructive mode of operation are, however, largely cancelled out by use of ratios of abundance, i.e., Rb/ Zr and Sr/ Zr, and consequently these are the more diagnostic parameters. Of the 40 samples, five (BUR-55-59) were measured by destructive and the remainder by nondestructive XRF. 
Neutron activation analysis. Thirty-three samples were also examined by abbreviated NAA, and 13 of these were examined by the complete sequence of NAA analyses in order to obtain measure­ments for additional elements. The methods used were the same as those described by Asaro et al. (1 994). 
ARCHAEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND OF SAMPLES 
Before we present a summary and discussion of the results of this study, we offer a short description of the three sites from which the analyzed artifacts were recovered (Figure 1). All of the sites are relatively well known, and readers are referred to earlier publications for a more detailed treatment. Two of the sites, El Inga and Chobshi Cave, are highland Preceramic sites that date to a time when nomadic hunters and gatherers occupied the Northern Andes. El Inga is located near the three known geologic sources of obsidian in northern Ecuador, whereas Chobshi Cave is in the southern highlands near the modern city of Cuenca. The third site, OGSE-46, is situated on the southern Ecuadorian coast ·and was occupied by agriculturalists who also took advantage of the rich marine resources nearby. The selection of these three sites for study was guided by the availability of materials for analysis and by our desire to test a range of samples from different regions and periods. 
El Inga (Bell 1965; Mayer-Oakes 1986). Located in the province of Pichincha about 5 km southeast of the town Tumbaco and 22 km east of Quito, near a tributary of the Guayllabamba river system, the site is situated on a low promontory in a highland valley at an elevation of 2,549 m asl. The area is cut by deep canyons and gullies, and erosion has been responsible for the destruction of much of the site. El Inga appears to have once covered an area approximately 150 m by 228 m, but only a small portion of the site remains (Bell 1965). Excavated in 1961 by Bell and Mayer­Oakes, the deposits at the site have a maximum depth of about 50 cm, and owing to plowing and other disturbance they display little stratigraphic differentiation (Mayer-Oakes 1986; Karen Stothert, personal communication 1989). 
El Inga has been interpreted as a camp utilized by highland hunter-gatherers. The investigations there attracted international attention because of the discovery of fishtail projectile points, believed by some scholars to be technologically and temporally related to the Clovis points ofNorth America. Fishtail points similar to those from El Inga have also been found in Peru, Argentina, and south­ernmost Chile, and most scholars agree that they are Paleoindian in age and may constitute a horizon marker for South America (Bird 1969; Dillehay et al. 1992:182-187; Lynch 1983). The additional presence of broad-stemmed points and ovate or leaf-shaped points suggests that the occupation of

El Inga may have been lengthy, perhaps spanning several thousand years. The site was not occupied in later prehistoric times. Inconsistent radiocarbon and obsidian hydration measurements have not helped to clarify the site chronology, although a radiocarbon date of9030 BP± 144 (R-1 070/ 2) from the lowest layer of the site is frequently cited as a plausible indicator of the site's age. 
The obsidian samples analyzed in this study come from surface collections made at El Inga. Because there is little evidence of stratigraphy at the site and the types of obsidian artifacts found on the surface do not differ significantly from those recovered during excavation from subsurface deposits, the surface collection is no more problematic than most of the excavated lithics from El Inga. 
Chobshi Cave (Lynch 1989; Lynch and Pollock 1980, 1981). Located 4 km from the village of Sigsig and 35 km southeast of Cuenca, at an elevation of 2400 m asl, this rock shelter is only 8 to 9 m deep and 15-20 m wide, but it is large enough to give protection from the elements to a small group and could have served as a seasonal base camp, particularly in light of its location near the headwaters of streams that drain into the valley. Excavations were initiated at the site by Bell in 1970 and continued by Lynch in 1972. The cultural deposits at Chobshi Cave were badly disturbed, but they yielded abundant lithics and bone. The stone tools include stemmed and barbed projectile

points similar to those from the Paijan assemblages of the north coast of Peru. Four uncorrected radiocarbon dates range from 10,010±430 (Tx-1133) to 7535±295 B.P. (Sl-1506) and, like the style of the points, they suggest that the shelter was occupied during the transition that followed the Paleoindian horizon (Lynch 1989:6-1 1). Typological similarities suggest partial contemporaneity with El Inga's later occupation. The obsidian flakes analyzed in this study came from Lynch's excavations. 
Site OGSE-46. Also referred to as GI or La Carolina, this site was originally excavated by Bushnell (1951:22-74) and Ferdon (1941), and reported on by Simmons (1970). It is located on the Santa Elena Bay in what is now the western portion of the modern town of La Libertad. The site consists of several low mounds and an extensive deep midden that spans several millennia. The materials recovered indicate the presence of Valdivia, Machalilla, Engoroy, and Guangala components, as well as a much later and smaller Manteno/ La Libertad occupation. 
Excavations in 1969 in sector U of the site revealed a Guangala midden approximately 1.15 m in depth, interpreted as the remains of a large village, now partially destroyed by modern construction activity (Stothert 1974:104-105). The obsidian flakes and blade fragments analyzed in this study come from Stothert's investigations, and were associated with Phase 4 and 5 Guangala ceramics. Utilizing the chronology proposed by Allison Paulsen (1970:134-136), the pottery and associated obsidian should date to A.D. 450-600. 
SUMMARY OF THE RESULTS 
Tables l through 3 record theXRF measurements made on the 40 samples studied. Table l lists the samples that XRF determinations suggest are identified with the homogeneous Yanaurco­Quiscatola source (Asaro et al. 1994). Table 2 presents the results on 10 samples that fall within the Mullumica pattern developed on the basis of data presented by Asaro et al. (1994). Table 3 lists the data on three artifacts that match no known source. BUR-57 is not like any of the others, but the abundances of eight elements strongly resemble those of the Callejones source (Table 2, footnote t). There appears to be a distinct difference in the abundance of potassium (K) (Robert D. Giouque, personal communication 1992), so the assignment is only tentative. 
Tables 4a, 4b, 5a and 5b record the NAA abundances. Tables 4a and 4b show the results obtained in the abbreviated runs as well as the additional values obtained by the completed runs, which matched the Yanaurco-Quiscatola deposits designated "Group A." Table 5 shows the results of five abbreviated and five completed NAA determinations that fall within the Mullumica pattern, and also the NAA results on three unassigned artifacts. Table 6 is the sample concordance and summary. 
Of the 40 artifacts studied, 27 match the composition ofYanaurco-Quiscatola. Ten artifacts were fo.und·to fall within the "variable" Mullumica source. The composition of one artifact bears some resemblance to both the Callejones and Mullumica sources, but because the K and Na values do not match we still consider BUR-57 unassigned. Two additional artifacts (BUR-56 and BUR-59), making up 5 percent of total analyzed, remain unassigned; they are similar to each other, but to no other source or artifact known to us. It is likely that these "unassigned" samples come from a geologic source of obsidian other than Yanaurco-Quiscatola, Mullumica, and Callejones. 
In summary, 92.5 percent of the obsidian artifacts analyzed in this study were made from raw materials from Yanaurco-Quiscatola and Mullumica. Of the 12 artifacts from El Inga, eight come from Yanaurco-Quiscatola and four from Mullumica. Five of the 11 samples analyzed from Chobshi Cave are ofMullumica obsidian, three come from the Yanaurco-Quiscatola deposit, and one anom­alous piece may come from either the Mullumica or the Callejones source. Finally, 16 of the 17 samples studied from the Guangala Phase 4 and 5 layers at OGSE-46 on the Santa Elena Peninsula come from the Yanaurco-Quiscatola source, and one from the Mullumica deposit.

al. 1994) are 19 sites and 156 samples. The sites are situated in various parts of Ecuador, and they date to different periods in the country's prehistory. Integration of the findings with discussions of obsidian artifacts in the literature on Ecuadorian prehistory makes possible some general obser­vations about the changing nature of obsidian exploitation and exchange in Prehispanic Ecuador. The conclusions presented here are very preliminary in nature, and we hope that they will serve to stimulate additional research. 
Our research indicates that Yanaurco-Quiscatola and Mullumica were the principal sources of raw obsidian for most of Ecuador. Analysis of artifacts from archaeological sites in the Quito and Chillos valleys demonstrates that this was true for areas close to the two natural deposits (Asaro et al. l 994:Table 5), and judging from the results of the Chobshi Cave and OGSE-46 analyses, it was the case for sites in the southern highlands and coast as well. 
There is no evidence that any of the 13 or more obsidian sources exploited in Prehispanic Peru was ever utilized by groups in ancient Ecuador (Burger and Asaro 1979). The prehistoric peoples in central and southern Ecuador who used obsidian apparently acquired all of the material through direct or indirect exchange links with the people of the northern Ecuadorian highlands.

The abundances of Ba, Rb, Sr and Zr appropriate to the mixed Mullumica flow were calculated from the mean Fe abundance of .S 14 percent. 
According to Salazar's investigations, the pattern of obsidian exploitation at both major Ecua­dorian sources was one of massive production of blanks, ready-made for transportation to coastal settlements. Once at their destination, blanks were put to use with little edge modification, as a comparison between Quiscatola and coastal site blanks shows. At Mullumica, ready-made blocks were 0btained from cave-ins, and knapped into flakes and blades for transport. Given the hetero­
geneous nature of the flow, a more careful selection of raw material was necessary than at the more homogeneous Quiscatola flow. Quarrying was done at Quiscatola by digging out obsidian nodules and blocks from the few localities where the flow resulted in outcrops. It is apparent that the smoky transparent variety of obsidian typical of the Quiscatola flow was highly appreciated on the coast, where it was imported from the very beginning of the exchange activities. 
Judging from the samples analyzed to date, most sites utilized obsidian from both the Mullumica and the Yanaurco-Quiscatola deposits, although Mullumica, the larger of the sources, tends to predominate at most of the sites. One of the more intriguing results is that 16 of the 1 7 artifacts sampled from the Guangala occupation ofOGSE-46 on the Santa Elena Peninsula are ofYanaurco­Quiscatola obsidian, a nearly exclusive pattern that has no parallels among the other sites we studied. It contrasts sharply with the consumption pattern of the roughly coeval Guangala occupation at La Ponga in the Valdivia Valley, only 40 km away, where all 19 artifacts tested matched the Mullumica chemical signature. The number of our samples is not large, but the data strongly suggest that differences in patterns of procurement existed between nearby sites of the same culture. One possible explanation of the difference may be that the OGSE-46 samples were mostly prismatic blade frag­ments struck from prepared cores, a type of specialized lithic production for which it is possible that the more homogeneous Yanaurco-Quiscatola obsidian was preferred.

c Unassigned artifact which has abundances for many elements measured by NAA similar to those in Callejones or Mullumica obsidian. After the sub­mission of the present paper, it was found that the abundances of 8 elements in sample BUR-57 (Ce, Cs, Eu, Hf, Sb, Sc, Ta and Th) had an average deviation of only 2.1 percent form those of a new Ecuadorian source, Callejones, recently discovered by E. Salazar (unpublished). The Callejones source is about 3-4 km east ofMullumica and is similar in composition to part of the latter. (Two elements, Fe and Co, in the Callejones source area also demonstrate variable abundances like Mullumica.) BUR-57, however, has much more Kand much less Na than expected for Mullumica obsidian. The same is true with respect to K for the Callejones source, so a positive assignment cannot be made from the present data.

Besides the important Yanaurco-Quiscatola and Mullumica sources, several minor Ecuadorian obsidian sources were exploited in Prehispanic times. The existence of two other types of obsidian is implied by the analysis of three unidentified flakes from Chobshi Cave; one resembles both the Mullumica and Callejones source but does not match either one, whereas the other two have a chemical signature for which the geologic source has yet to be determined. 
The source for the two unidentified Chobshi Cave flakes (BUR-56 and BUR-59) may be located farther north than the Yanaurco-Quiscatola and Mullumica deposits. Our study of artifactual ob­sidian from the Late Formative site of La Chimba, 55 km northeast of Quito, concludes that none of the five pieces analyzed matches the chemical composition of the Yanaurco-Quiscatola, Mul­lumica, or Callejones sources (Asaro et al. l 994:Table 4; Athens 1990:69). Four of the samples form a coherent chemical group, whereas the fifth does not match any of the known chemical groups (Asaro et al. 1994). These findings, along with those from Chobshi Cave, suggest that there may be geological sources in the northern Pichincha and Imbabura provinces. Athens (1 990:67; cf. Myers 1976) suggests that because obsidian at the La Chimba site occurred in such large quantities, there was probably a geologic source in the immediate vicinity. 
Obsidian artifacts have been recovered at archaeological sites in Colombia (Duque Gomez 1964: 402; Mendez 1985:75-83; Reichel-Dolmatoff 1965:93, 105; Uribe 1976, 1977-1978:121) and it is conceivable that the sources for the unidentified obsidian used in the far northern highlands of Ecuador might be located in the volcanic regions of neighboring Colombia. This possibility cannot

be eliminated, but it does not appear strong. Recent work by Gnecco at the Missouri University Research Reactor indicates obsidian from sources at Rio Hondo and Sotara near Popayan, some 300 km north of La Chimba, were used in Colombia during Prehispanic times (Gnecco et al. 1993), but none matches the "signature" of the unidentified artifacts from La Chimba or Chobshi Cave. 
No obsidian from the Mullumica or Yanaurco-Quiscatola sources has been encountered thus far in the extensive studies of archaeological obsidian from Peru. Even Peruvian archaeological sites relatively close to the Ecuadorian obsidian sources have yielded artifacts made from material from the more distant southern sources (Burger l 984a; Burger and Asaro 1979), and hence it appears that the procurement of obsidian from northern Ecuador was restricted in scope. 
Compared to the situation in Mesoamerica or Peru, the Ecuadorian obsidian sources were few 
in number, and the major ones were all clustered within the Cordillera Real east of Quito. As a 
result, a study of obsidian distribution at Ecuadorian archaeological sites sheds light most directly 
on changing contacts between the peoples of the Guamani highlands and the neighboring Quito 
valley and those in other regions; consequently, the study of obsidian artifacts may be of limited 
use in elucidating other long-distance linkages. Nevertheless, the geographic specificity of the ob­
sidian offers advantages, particularly compared with studies of Spondylus shell, a raw material that 
can be collected in deep waters off much of Ecuador's shoreline. 
With this background, we will now briefly review the pattern of obsidian procurement and 
exchange in Prehispanic Ecuador. The results of the El Inga analyses demonstrate that both of the 
major types of Ecuadorian obsidian were already being utilized early in the Prece1amic. El Inga is 

located only about 8 km west of the Mullumica and Yanaurco-Quiscatola sources, and the inhabitants 
of this open camp probably visited the obsidian outcrops directly or recovered obsidian cobbles 
from secondary deposits still nearer the site. Not surprisingly, obsidian was the preferred raw material 
for stone tools at El Inga, and predominates in all levels at the site (Bell 1965:Table 1 ). Twenty of 
the 21 fishtail points found at El Inga (Bell 1965:265-269) are made of obsidian, as are 93. 7 percent 
of the roughly 80,000 lithics recovered (Mayer-Oakes 1986:32). At another nearby Preceramic site, 
San Jose, 95.9 percent of the tools are made of obsidian (Mayer-Oakes l 986:Table 4). Salazar (1979) 
has investigated still other Preceramic sites in the Ilal6 region, located even closer to the two flows, 
and they likewise show a rich lithic inventory in which obsidian is the dominant material. A short 
distance farther east, Porras (1 980:49) encountered obsidian artifacts in an apparently Preceramic 
context at a site in the Cotundo-Jandachi area, on the forested eastern slopes in the headwaters of 
the Napo River. 
Although both major obsidian sources were known and appreciated early in Ecuadorian prehistory, 
perhaps prior to 7000 B.C., the material was not exchanged in quantity over a wide area. For 
example, the Preceramic peoples of the Las Vegas culture (8,000-5,000 B.C.) on the Santa Elena 
Peninsula did not acquire even a small amount of obsidian, but relied exclusively on chert for raw 
material (Stothert 1985, 1988). 
Some obsidian did reach Chobshi Cave, some 300 km from the sources, but it comprises less 
than I percent of the lithic assemblage (Lynch 1989). With its conspicuous appearance and superior 
flaking qualities, it may have been viewed as a prestigious raw material. It could have been acquired 
as the result of multiple "down-the-line" exchanges between neighboring bands of hunter-gatherers 
occupying the highland valleys and grasslands. It may be significant in evaluating this possibility 
that the small sample of flakes (n 11) represents four different geologic sources. The minute 
= 
quantity and the multiple sources seem inconsistent with a model of direct acquisition from the 
geologic deposits, and the diversity of sources, which is greater than for any of the later sites studied, 
may reflect the less rigid noninstitutional character of obsidian procurement during this very early 
period. 
Despite the precocious exploitation of two high-quality obsidian sources during the Preceramic, 
long-distance trade of this raw material was not carried out on a significant scale with the peoples 
of southern Ecuador until the Late Formative or even later. In the highlands north of Cuenca, the 
site of Cerro Narrio has an important Formative component, but investigations there by Bennett 
(1946) did not encounter obsidian artifacts or debitage. Although the site has been badly disturbed, 
archaeologists have not found surface obsidian during visits, and J. Scott Raymond (personal

• After the submission of the present paper, it was found that the abundances of 8 elements in sample BUR-S7 (Ce, Cs, Eu, Hf, Sb, Sc, Ta and Th) had an average deviation of only 2.1 percent from those of a new Ecuadorian source, Callejones, recently discovered by E. Salazar (unpublished). The Callejones source  
is about 3-4 km east of Mullumica and is similar in composition to part of the latter. (Two elements, Fe and Co, in the Callejones source area also demonstrate variable abundances like Mullumica.) BUR-S7, however, has much more K and much less Na than expected for Mullumica obsidian. The same is true with  respect to K for the Calljeones source. So a positive assignment cannot be made from the present data.

communication, 1982) concluded that "The site has been so thoroughly churned up by pothunters that obsidian would most certainly be appearing if there were any in the midden." 
Three seasons of excavation at the site of Pirincay, 32 km south of Cerro Narrio, have shown that obsidian is much less than 1 percent of the lithic assemblage. The five pieces recovered were all apparently associated with Late Formative materials (ca. 1000-300 BC) (Bruhns 1986: 17). Most of the lithics at Pirincay are basalt, quartz, chert, rock crystal, and other materials. The site continued to be occupied during the early years of the Regional Developmental Period (ca. A.D. 100) and although there is abundant evidence of interzonal exchange with the adjacent coast, there is no evidence of obsidian in strata of the period. Other highland Formative sites that have been inves­tigated in the Loja region, farther south near the Peruvian border, are apparently marked by a lithic assemblage produced exclusively from basalt, jasper, and chalcedony (Guffroy et al. 1987:99). 
The scarcity of obsidian at early agricultural sites in the southern highlands is paralleled on the neighboring coast. The extensive excavations of the Proyecto Real Alto in the Chanduy Valley on Ecuador's south coast, directed by Lathrap and Marcos, show that obsidian was apparently com-

pletely absent for most of the occupation from ca. 3500 to 1500 B.C. Obsidian occurred only in very small quantity in a single nondomestic context in association with exotic thin-orange pottery dating to Terminal Valdivia times, ca. 1500 B.C. (Marcos 1988; Jorge Marcos, personal commu­nication 1991 ). 
On the nearby Santa Elena Peninsula, one of the more intensively studied areas in Ecuador, obsidian appears to have been almost absent throughout the Formative. Most archaeologists have failed to encounter any obsidian in Valdivia, Machalilla, or Engoroy (the local Late Formative phase) sites, although John Staller (personal communication, 1993) discovered three obsidian flakes in a Valdivia 6 burial at the OGSECh-150 site. Despite this rare find, the currently available evidence suggests that obsidian only began to be imported to the peninsula in any quantity by communities of the Guangala culture during the Regional Developmental Period sometime after 100 B.C. (Bush­nell 1951: 15; Jackson et al. 1992; Paulsen 1974:602; Stothert 1974). During the early phases of the Guangala culture, a very modest amount of obsidian appears to have been obtained by the residents of the peninsula. For example, at the early Guangala site of OGSE-MA-172 almost all of the raw material for lithics was a local chert; although a small number of obsidian flakes were recovered, none appeared in the deepest stratigraphic layers (Stothert 1993:29). The acquisition of obsidian by the coastal groups of Santa Elena increased sharply during the middle phases of the Guangala Culture (i.e., A.D. 450-600) when it accounted for approximately 17 percent of the lithic assemblage (Stothert 197 4: l 7 4, 266). 
Surface survey in the Rio Tambo drainage, located some 20 km south of OGSE-46, encountered obsidian with Guangala ceramics of the middle phases at a number of small sites. Excavations at one confirmed the association of obsidian and Guangala pottery at a household where grinding tools were being produced (Karen Stothert, personal communication 1989). This led Stothert to conclude that obsidian use was widespread among the populace and not restricted to an elite group during mid-Guangala times. However, her investigations indicate that obsidian use declined sharply in late Guangala to only about l percent of the assemblage (Stothert 1974:318), and remained extremely rare in later Integration Period sites of the Manteno/La Libertad culture (Paulsen 1974:603; Karen Stothert, personal communication 1989). 
On the Ecuadorian coast south of the Santa Elena Peninsula, the pioneering studies in El Oro rarely reported any obsidian (Estrada et al. 1964:497-50 l; Meggers 1966:78). Several obsidian flakes occurred in Terminal Valdivia deposits at the regional center of La Emerenciana (John Staller, personal communication 1993), but the material is extremely scarce at the site. Even the shoreline communities of the Regional Developmental Period Jambeli apparently did not continue to have access to obsidian (Estrada et al. 1964), although it appears to have been utilized by coeval inland farmers of the coastal plain (John Staller, personal communication 1993) . 
. In contrast to El Oro and Santa Elena, the neighboring riverine peoples of the Guayas drainage imported significant amounts of obsidian during both the Late Formative and the Regional De­velopmental Period, known locally as the Daule and Tejar phases (Alvarez et al. 1981; Meggers 1966:82; Michael Muse, personal communication 1991; Parducci and Parducci 1973:112). For example, excavations at Peii.6n del Rio, a site within a large zone of Prehispanic raised fields near the modem city of Guayaquil, yielded 240 pieces of obsidian, most of which were from Late Formative contexts. Obsidian was also common in Regional Developmental Period contexts (Buys and Muse 1987; Michael Muse, personal communication 1992). 
Formative Period obsidian is scarce in the Valdivia valley, directly north of the Santa Elena Peninsula. No obsidian was found in the Valdivia or Machalilla sites at the mouth and nearby shoreline of the Valdivia River (Meggers et al. 1965:26-33, 152). At the site of Loma Alta (Raymond et al. 1980), 8 km from the ocean on the southern bank of the Valdivia River, excavations produced low quantities of obsidian in Chorrera contexts, but little if any obsidian with Valdivia associations 
(J. Scott Raymond, personal communication 1992). Across the Valdivia River at the ancient set­tlement of La Ponga, excavators documented a significant sample of Formative lithics (n 3,354),

in which obsidian was absent from both the rich Machalilla (ca. 1500-1 000 B.C.) strata and the 
preceding Valdivia strata; most of the stone artifacts were chert and quartzite flakes (Lippi 1983: 176-179). A small number of obsidian flakes and blades (n = 19) were recovered from the uppermost

Guangala levels and surface (Lippi 1983: 179-180). Provenience analysis of the 19 reveals that the Mullumica flow was the source of the raw material for all (Asaro et al. l 994:Table 5). The fact that artifacts from three of the four chemical subtypes (Mullumica A, B, and C) were represented in the analyses indicates that the material was probably derived from several portions of the geologic deposit. 
The occurrence of obsidian flakes in Late Formative assemblages at Loma Alta and Peii.6n del Rio suggests that groups in the Valdivia and Guayas drainages may have had access to small amounts of obsidian several centuries earlier than their contemporaries on the more peripheral Santa Elena Peninsula. Yet throughout the south coast, obsidian was rare during the Early and Middle Formative (i.e., prior to 1,000 B.C.), and the existing evidence suggests that in the Valdivia drainage, like Santa Elena, it was only during the Regional Developmental Period that obsidian acquisition and use dramatically increased. 
It should not be forgotten that southern Ecuador is a substantial distance from the main sources of obsidian. Both the Valdivia drainage and the Cuenca basin are over 300 km away from the obsidian deposits of the Guamani highlands, and the Santa Elena Peninsula and Loja are even farther away. As one would expect, the pattern of obsidian procurement and distribution is quite different in northern Ecuador. 
Extensive utilization of obsidian by the early hunters and gatherers of the northern highlands by perhaps 9,000 B.C. has been documented at El Inga and nearby sites. Obsidian from both the Mullumica and the Yanaurco-Quiscatola flows was exploited for utilized flakes, scrapers, an:d finely flaked bifaces, and it constituted more than 90 percent of the raw material at early sites in the region (Salazar 1979:97). The use of obsidian apparently continued without interruption throughout the Preceramic (Salazar 1992). 
The first known sedentary farming communities in the northern highlands date to the Middle Formative. The most extensively studied is the 26-ha village of Cotocollao in the Quito valley, founded ca. 1500 B.C. and occupied continuously until it was buried by volcanic ash around 350 
B.C. In addition to the remains of domestic architecture and an elaborate ceramic assemblage, the excavators recovered abundant stone tools and flakes (n 144,583), of which obsidian comprised 
= 
86.7 percent (Villalba 1988:269). As in the Preceramic, many types of tools were manufactured from obsidian including burins, scrapers, and awls. On rare occasions, obsidian also was used in the production of items for personal ornamentation, such as beads and ear plugs (Villalba 1988: Figure 142). 
It appears that all of the obsidian utilized at Cotocollao was procured from the Mullumica and Yanaurco-Quiscatola sources, 35 km to the east. Forty-three artifacts from Cotocollao were analyzed at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory using long and abbreviated NAA and XRF. Eight (18.5 percent) proved to be from the Yanaurco-Quistcatola source, whereas the other 35 (8 1.5 percent) come from Mullumica. Once again, the presence of four different Mullumica compositions suggests that multiple sections of the source were being exploited. The late Emil Peterson (personal communication, 1977) observed that Cotocollao sits on a low pass leading into the Occidental area, and that the site may have served as a redistribution point for obsidian into the northwestern coastal area. Five analyzed samples from Nay6n Sur No. 2, a nearby Formative site east of Cotocollao, all come from the Mullumica source (Asaro et al. l 994:Table 5). 
Obsidian utilization apparently continued to be widespread among the farming communities of the Quito valley until the arrival of the Spaniards. At the Regional Developmental settlement of La Florida (ca. A.D. 100-400), on the edge of modern Quito, test pits covering a 12 m2 area designed to sample domestic refuse yielded 1,686 pieces of chipped stone, of which 56 percent is obsidian. As at Cotocollao, a wide range of tools was produced (Doyon 1988; Leon Doyon, personal com­munication 1993). Survey of 67 sites between the towns of Guayllabamba and El Quinche directly east of Quito and slightly north of the two major obsidian sources showed that obsidian is the primary component of the regional lithic assemblage at sites of the Regional Developmental, In­tegration, and Inka periods (Bray 1991: 1 10, 464). These findings are consistent with the abundance of obsidian tools and flakes recovered in the excavations at the Integration Period site ofCochasqui (Zalles-Flossbach 1989). The continuation of obsidian usage into Inka times is also supported by

the numerous obsidian flakes found associated with local and Cuzco Inka ceramics at the site of Rumicucho, 25 km northeast of Quito (Almeida and Jara 1984:91, 94-95). We have yet to test obsidian from Inka sites in Ecuador, but four of the five obsidian flakes studied from Quito 48B2, an Integration Period settlement in the Quito area, come from Mullumica and one from Yanaurco­Quiscatola (Asaro et al. 1994:Table 5). 
Highland obsidian was sought after by groups living directly west of the source area along the forested slopes and coastal plain of northern Ecuador. Small quantities were being brought into the northern coast of Ecuador by Terminal-Valdivia times; its presence has been documented for the Piquigua phase (ca. 1680-1550 BC) at San Isidro in the Jama Valley (Zeidler et al. 1994), and two of the artifacts were shown by XRF to be from the Mullumica source (Zeidler et al. 1994). Obsidian was apparently common throughout prehistory in the Jama Valley, judging from preliminary results ofregional survey and excavations. Artifacts and debitage encountered at 22 sites (Wolford 1991) show that obsidian continued to be used during the Late Formative, Regional Developmental, and Integration periods. Single samples from Regional Developmental (Jama-Coaque I) and early In­tegration (Jama-Coaque II) contexts come from Mullumica and Yanaurco-Quiscatola, respectively (Zeidler et al. 1994). Cherts and other raw materials were more common than obsidian in the Jama drainage, but obsidian constituted more than 15 percent of the utilized flakes and debitage recorded. The exchange of obsidian from the Guamani highlands with coastal groups is not surprising, although its volume and longevity are in marked contrast with those in areas farther south. 
Santa Marta, a Regional Developmental site on the forested lower western slopes of Santo Do­mingo de los Colorados, lies midway between the two major highland obsidian sources and the coast centers in the Jama Valley. Of six obsidian artifacts from Santa Marta, five are from Mullumica and one is from Yanaurco-Quiscatola (Asaro et al. l 994:Table 5). It is likely that Santa Marta and other similarly located sites played an important role in the movement of volcanic glass from the highlands to the coast. Considering the apparent scarcity of obsidian in the southern highlands even during the Late Formative and Regional Developmental periods, it appears that the obsidian ac­quired by south-coast peoples may have been carried along this east-west trade route and then transported south along the coast, rather than being moved southward through the intermontane valleys and/or moist paramo (grasslands). 
By the Late Formative, obsidian also was being utilized by communities north of the Jama Valley 
near what today is the Ecuador-Colombia frontier. In Esmeraldas, obsidian use has been well 
documented for the Chorrera-related Tachina phase in Esmeraldas (ca. 1,000-100 B.C.). Two test 
pits at the Tachina phase site of La Cantera on the north coast of Esmeraldas yielded 222 obsidian 
tools and flakes (Lopez y Sebastian and Caillavet 1979:210; cf. L6pez y Sebastian 1986). A similar 
pattern of obsidian utilization existed during the Late Formative along the southern coast of Es­
meraldas at sites such as Chevele (Guinea 1986:25). 
Along the forested coastal plain of far northern Ecuador, obsidian was used extensively at the 
major Regional Developmental center of La Tolita (Valdez 1987), and was relatively abundant at 
small rural inland settlements of the Regional Developmental Period (Tolstoy and DeBoer 1989: 
304). A large block of obsidian from La Tolita comes from the Mullumica source (Asaro et al. 1994: 
Table 5). Significantly, obsidian procurement by groups in the Santiago-Cayapas river basin upstream 
from La Tolita declined precipitously during the subsequent Integration Period (Tolstoy and DeBoer 
1989:302), and long-distance trade of obsidian to groups in the Esmeraldas region virtually ceased 
in late Prehispanic times, despite continued utilization of the material nearer its natural sources. 
This brief review of the literature suggests that, although present knowledge is limited, there is 
enough evidence to indicate that obsidian rarely was acquired by Preceramic and Early and Middle 
Formative cultures outside the source area. Even in Late Formative times some of the peoples of 
the southern coast and highlands remained unable to procure this raw material in significant quan­
tities, despite its popularity in northern Ecuador among coeval coastal and highland societies at 
sites such as Chevele, Cotocollao, and La Chimba. After 100 B.C., the pattern appears to have 
changed as obsidian use became more widespread in the Regional Developmental Period, only to 
decline again after A.O. 600 in many areas. Long-distance exchange of obsidian during the Integration

Period (A.O. 600-1 532) appears to have been limited or nonexistent in many areas outside of the northern highlands and parts of the adjacent coast. 
OBSIDIAN AND TRADITIONAL MODELS OF LONG-DISTANCE TRADE: 
SOME CA YEATS 

What implications does the pattern of prehistoric obsidian distribution described above have for a better understanding of long-distance exchange among the pre-Inka peoples of ancient Ecuador? Before we explore the ramifications of our findings, some words of caution are in order. Archaeo­logical research in most of Ecuador is still in its infancy and few sites have seen large-scale excavation. Much of our current understanding derives from surface survey or small-scale test excavations, and consequently some generalizations concerning the patterning of obsidian distribution presented here may be substantially modified by intensive research. It is clear, furthermore, that no study of a single material, even if it were in greater depth than the present one, would be adequate in itself for evaluating the applicability of the popular ethnohistorically inspired model that emphasizes the importance of specialized traders and markets among Ecuador's prehistoric societies. 
According to most accounts, the mindalii.es of sixteenth-century Ecuador were concerned with low-weight high-value materials that could serve as emblems of chiefly authority (Salomon 1986). Because obsidian appears to have had an almost exclusively utilitarian role in Prehispanic Ecuador, it probably would not have been one of the items distributed over long distances by such specialized traders. Moreover, most late Prehispanic trade described in historic documents dealt in perishable goods such as ajf (chili pepper), salt, and cotton, to name just a few-goods that were probably much more important items of exchange than obsidian. The analysis of durable goods, such as Spondylus shell, copper, rock crystal, and special types of ceramic vessels and figurines that were also more highly valued than obsidian, might provide a very different picture of changing trade relationships in ancient Ecuador. We hope that this article will help to stimulate pan-regional studies of other raw materials and manufactured products. 
Although almost all of the artifactual obsidian recovered in Ecuador consists of simple tools, this pattern of obsidian utilization was not inevitable. Rather, it was the product of cultural and socio­economic forces and decisions. Cultures elsewhere in the world created a host of nonutilitarian objects from obsidian. For example, in the Near East craft specialists produced obsidian vases, mirrors, seal stamps, tables, and necklaces that were traded over long distances (Dixon et al. 1968: 46; Wright 1969:39-41, 79). In ancient Mesoamerica obsidian ritual and sumptuary items such as the well-known monkey-effigy bowl (Covarrubias 1966), a rattlesnake wand (Townsend 1992:Plate 115), and a mirror set in an ornate wooden frame (Coe 1962:Plate 67), as well as items of personal adornment such as ear spools, labrets, and pendants (Porter Weaver 1972:Plate 14a,b,c), are among the most finely crafted objects produced by the Aztecs. Indeed, the unusual visual qualities of obsidian lend themselves to the production of extraordinary items. 
There is in fact some evidence from Ecuador that obsidian was occasionally employed to produce nonutilitarian items, including the bead and ear spool from Cotocollao. At least three finely polished obsidian mirrors recovered at La Tolita and the northern Ecuador coastal Esmeraldas area sur­rounding it (Uhle 1927:248; Valdez 1987:87) have been interpreted as objects of ritual power utilized by shamans (Salazar 1992: 1 26). Clearly, obsidian had the potential to become a much more im­portant material for fabrication of the kinds of highly valued items associated with the specialized traders mentioned in the chronicles. Although the potential was not exploited, the technology necessary to produce sumptuary and ritual objects of obsidian apparently existed during the For­mative and Regional Developmental periods. Should we ascribe the almost exclusively utilitarian use of obsidian in Ecuador to cultural values that remain poorly understood, or could this be a function of the political economy of the northern highland societies that controlled the natural sources of obsidian, and of their relationships with coeval societies on the coast and southern highlands? It can be suggested that if specialized production for long-distance trade had been well developed in the Quito area, it might have led to the manufacture of a broader range of non utilitarian obsidian objects for exchange with elites elsewhere.

Even given the primarily utilitarian role of obsidian, which may have placed it outside the scope of the native merchants, an active system of local markets such as that proposed for sixteenth­century Ecuador (Salomon 1986, Hartmann 1971) still should have resulted in the widespread distribution of raw obsidian, prepared obsidian cores and/or obsidian tools. But as we have seen, this expectation was not met. Although groups distant from the source area were occasionally able to procure obsidian, particularly during the Regional Developmental Period, distribution of obsidian in Prehispanic Ecuador was not comparable in scale or scope to the well-developed markets in areas such as Mesoamerica or the Near East. 
The lack of comparability can be illustrated by a comparison between the situation on the Santa Elena Peninsula and that on the Isthmus ofTehuantepec on the Pacific coast of Mexico. Provenience studies (Zeitlin 1982; Zeitlin and Heimbuch 1978), show that obsidian was a significant import to the southern Isthmus from about 1500 B.C., the beginning of the documented sequence. As a raw material for tools it never comprised less than 10 percent of the flaked lithic assemblage, and by the Late Classic it made up over 90 percent of the flaked assemblage. At least 17 different obsidian sources were represented, the closest 385 km away and the most distant 1,050 km away. Even at the beginning of the sequence two of the main sources, Guadalupe Victoria and El Chayal, were 400 km and 525 km away. The contrast with the ecologically similar Santa Elena Peninsula is striking. Despite Santa Elena's greater proximity to major obsidian sources (ca. 375 km) and the availability of advantageous modes of land and sea transportation (llama caravans and balsa-wood boats), the peninsula's cultures made much less use of obsidian, which was completely absent on the peninsula during most of prehistory and never constituted more than 20 percent of the lithic assemblage. The Tehuantepec case demonstrates the potential scope and volume of obsidian trans­port in societies with highly developed exchange networks. 
What factors other than an underdeveloped system of markets and long-distance exchange might account for the limited distribution of obsidian in Prehispanic Ecuador? One possibility evident to those who have done archaeological work in Ecuador is that technological factors could be at least partially responsible. By far the most common obsidian and other lithic artifacts recovered through­out Ecuador are shattered pieces, often with some evidence of use as tools. Crude unretouched percussion flakes and chunks greatly outnumber chipped tools, and in some regions of Ecuador pressure-flaked bifaces and unifaces appear to be absent, particularly after the Preceramic. The technological and morphological simplicity of this "smash and bash" lithic tradition compared to those of North America, Mesoamerica, and the Central Andes may have led to a lack ofappreciation for obsidian's chipping qualities. A tradition of producing fine bifaces or blades can be seen as creating conditions that encourage long-distance exchange of raw materials, such as obsidian, that are suitable for precision lithic manufacture. Conversely, a simple lithic technology like the one that characterized much of Ecuadorian prehistory can be seen as discouraging the acquisition of nonlocal 
lithic material. 
The foregoing argument is plausible, but not entirely satisfying. It does not take into account the advantages offered by the exceptionally sharp edges of obsidian fragments, whether on chunks, percussion flakes or more elaborate tools. It also does not consider the distinctive appearance of obsidian that would have made it easily identifiable as an · import and consequently a potential symbol of prestige or status even in its utilitarian role. Finally, until we have a better understanding of the function of Ecuadorian stone tools and the reasons for employment of limited lithic tech­nologies, it will be difficult to judge how such factors affected the procurement of obsidian. 
Some scholars have argued that the simplicity of lithic technology in Ecuador may have been the result of the availability in Ecuador's abundant lowland and montane forest environments of wood and other organic materials for tool production (Stothert 1974, 1985; cf. Ranere 1976). This may be so, but the abundance of imported obsidian, often worked using sophisticated lithic technology, in the tropical forests of the Guatemalan Peten (Moholy-Nagy et al. 1984; Potter 1993), illustrates that the environment in no sense determines the lithic technology employed or the raw material utilized. Moreover, the waxing and waning of obsidian distribution in Ecuadorian prehistory suggests that obsidian was valued in a variety of ecological settings when it could be obtained. If obsidian offered no advantages over local organic and inorganic materials, why would it have been acquired

from sources hundreds of kilometers away by the occupants of the tropical forest of Esmeraldas, the thorny scrub forest of the Santa Elena Peninsula, and the highland basin of Cuenca? 
We recognize that the broad-brush description of lithic technology we offer may be premature. Few Ecuadorian lithic industries are well understood; detailed descriptions of stone-tool assemblages remain rare, and knowledge is particularly limited for later prehistoric cultures. There is evidence, however, that finely chipped tools were characteristic of the Preceramic in much of Ecuador, and examples of high-quality bifaces have been documented for later times (e.g., Marcos 1970; Stemper 1989:Figure 215). In some sites where the lithic assemblages have been systematically studied, scrapers, burins and other tools have been encountered along with the more common crude expedient tools (e.g., Villalba 1988:272). 
A sophisticated coastal lithic technology involved the pressure-flaking of parallel-sided blades from a prepared core (Figure 2a). This lithic industry sometimes coexisted with the. older stone­working tradition of crude unretouched flakes and the production of pressure-flaked bifaces (Figure 2b), and in some areas the different lithic industries are found in association with each other. The blade tradition seems to have appeared first in northern Ecuador during Late Formative times (Lathrap et al. 1975:51, 108, Figures 571-575; Meggers 1966:56, 63; James Zeidler, personal com­munication 1993). Wolford's (1991) study of the blade-making industry in the Jama River drainage demonstrates technological continuity in the production ofmicroblades from the Middle Formative through the Integration Period. Both Meggers (1966:56) and Lathrap et al. (1975:51) describe the blade tradition as similar to that of Mesoamerica, and Meggers even asserts that the Ecuadorians outstripped the Mesoamericans in terms of the quality of the blades produced. As in Mesoamerica, the predictable chipping qualities of high-grade obsidian made it the preferred raw material for this lithic technology. 
The production of blades from prepared cores was characteristic of the subsequent Regional Developmental Period culture of the Santa Elena Peninsula, including our lithic sample from OGSE­46 (Figure 2a). The blades from the south coast are technologically similar to those in the north, but they are significantly larger than those documented for the Jama drainage. In the Santa Elena Peninsula, the widespread consumption of obsidian and the introduction of the sophisticated north­ern lithic technology seem to be linked. But whereas the blade tradition in the Jama drainage on the north coast appears to have continued until the Spanish invasion (Wolford 1991 ), it seems to

have been abandoned on the south coast before the Integration Period. One wonders whether the difficulty of obtaining high-quality obsidian on the southern Ecuadorian coast contributed to the disappearance of blades from late lithic assemblages. 
The availability of cryptocrystalline silicate rocks (such as chert, flint, or chalcedony) throughout much of Ecuador does not explain the limited exchange of obsidian. An analogous distribution of alternative high-quality raw materials for lithics existed in Mesoamerica, Peru, and the Near East, yet it did not preclude long-distance exchange of obsidian. Importation of obsidian despite the availability of excellent alternatives has been documented for Chavin de Huantar in northern Peru, where at the height of the center's pan-regional influence (ca. 400-250 B.C.) locally available chert and quartzite were almost entirely replaced by obsidian brought from a source located 475 km to the south. Obsidian was used for utilitarian purposes throughout the settlement, and small test excavations regularly yield hundreds of unretouched obsidian flakes as well as occasional flaked tools (Burger 1984b:l88-192, 236, 263-266). 
CONCLUSIONS 
At the outset of this article we observed that many contemporary archaeologists have viewed long-distance exchange as a key feature, perhaps the key feature, in understanding the integration of Prehispanic Ecuadorian cultures. As Feldman and Moseley wrote a decade ago: 
The cultural response to environmental diversity was the development of a multitude of small regional chiefdoms that were politically isolated yet materially interconnected by extensive trade networks [Feldman and Moseley 1983: 143]. 
Ethnohistoric accounts of specialized merchants and markets, combined with archaeological and documentary evidence of long-distance maritime trade, led scholars to view ancient Ecuador as analogous to Mesoamerica and fundamentally different from cultures of the Central Andes, where specialized traders and markets were thought to have been of little importance. Within this eth­nohistorically based model, the presence of obsidian artifacts on the Ecuadorian coast was interpreted as concrete confirmation of the central role of interregional long-distance trade in the integration of the Prehispanic cultures of the Northern Andes. With the discovery of the major sources of raw material for artifactual obsidian and the application of compositional fingerprinting techniques to a sample of 156 artifacts from 19 sites in Ecuador, it has become possible for the first time to provide a tentative tracing of the procurement and distribution of obsidian and the way they varied through time and space. 
As anticipated, the results confirm the importance of long-distance exchange of obsidian in northefl). Ecuador during the Formative and Regional Developmental periods. Large quantities of obsidian were quarried at the Mullumica and Yanaurco-Quiscatola sources in the Guamani high­lands of the Cordillera Real east of Quito and distributed by yet unknown mechanisms to the more densely occupied adjacent highlands, western slopes, and forested littoral. The recovery of substantial amounts of obsidian from both major geologic sources at Cotocollao suggests that Quito-valley settlements may have played a key role in procuring raw obsidian for exchange with more distant communities that possessed complementary resources in other ecological zones. In the Ecuadorian Andes, as in most mountainous regions, the locations of subsistence resources are generally deter­mined by the altitude above sea level. Because the Andes run north-south, interzonal cooperation was most efficiently organized along an east-west axis that included a range of complementary small, fragmented ecological zones (Oberem 1978). It is likely that a sphere of exchange along one such transect thrived in northern Ecuador during the Formative and the beginning of the Regional Developmental Period, and that obsidian was among the items exchanged by highland peoples for lowland items such as cotton, chili pepper, fish, and salt. 
Similar coeval interregional exchange networks apparently existed in southern and perhaps central Ecuador. For example, a drilled rock-crystal industry was developed during the Formative by the inhabitants of Pirincay in the Cuenca area, and they traded items to groups on the adjacent coast, possibly for Spondylus shell and mother-of-pearl artifacts as well as perishable materials (Bruhns

1989:71-72; Bruhns et al. 1990:232-233). Yet despite such long-distance exchange, obsidian re­mained very rare at sites on the southern Ecuadorian coast during the Early and Middle Formative, and it still was not common in most of the southern highlands and coast during the Late Formative. 
In other parts of the world, such as the Aegean and Melanesia, the introduction of ocean-going vessels led to the development of extensive seaborne obsidian trade over hundreds and even thousands of kilometers (Ambrose and Green 1972; Dixon et al. 1968). Maritime trade along the Pacific coast of Ecuador was under way by the Early Formative (Marcos 1980; Marcos and Norton 1981; Zeidler 1991 ), but it did not result in the extensive interregional distribution of northern highland obsidian. The introduction of llamas to Ecuador from Peru early in the Regional Developmental Period (Miller and Gill 1990) likewise did not lead to the high-volume transport of obsidian by caravans to the southern highlands. As we have seen, there were instances in which obsidian was procured and distributed in significant quantities outside its source area (e.g., the Guangala culture), but these exceptional cases highlight by contrast the scarcity of obsidian in earlier and later times along the south coast and adjacent highlands. Even along parts of the northern coast, obsidian utilization appears to have declined sharply after the Regional Developmental Period. 
Our preliminary findings on obsidian procurement and distribution do not fit comfortably with the popular model of ancient Ecuador as a politically fragmented area interconnected by extensive trade networks. At face value, the obsidian data indicate that during much of prehistory groups in northern Ecuador were not closely linked by interregional exchange to those in the southern part of the country. This interpretation of the distributional information assumes that the absence or scarcity of obsidian in southern Ecuador was mainly the result of sociopolitical and economic obstacles, rather than of a lack of demand for the raw material as the result of technological, ecological, or functional considerations. We tentatively interpret the occasional increase in obsidian consumption far beyond the source area, as in the case of the Guangala and La Tolita cultures, as reflecting the formation of more centralized sociopolitical and economic systems capable of procuring obsidian through exchange with northern highland groups. Because complex sociopolitical forces underlay the acquisition of obsidian, a patchy distribution pattern is evident even in this preliminary study that probably reflects the uneven development of neighboring small-scale societies in prehis­toric Ecuador. In this light, it is interesting that small-scale excavations at Salango, a site involved in the long-distance maritime trade, yielded obsidian flakes in a Machalilla context (Norton et al. 
1983:49), whereas more extensive excavations of Machalilla strata at the nearby inland site of La Ponga failed to encounter any obsidian. 
Our preliminary synthesis of the existing obsidian data point to major changes in the patterning ofinterregional exchange during the course ofEcuadorian prehistory. A model based on the sixteenth­century ethnohistorical accounts of markets and specialized traders cannot adequately account for such shifts, and does not satisfactorily explain why obsidian exchange was so much more attenuated in Ecuador than in Mesoamerica or the Near East. Our preliminary view of obsidian exchange suggests that although problems of poor organic preservation will continue to frustrate archaeological studies, a more aggressive utilization of the surviving archaeological record in conjunction with geochemical analyses may result in radical revision of the ethnohistorically inspired models currently popular in discussions of long-distance trade and interaction in prehistoric Ecuador.
