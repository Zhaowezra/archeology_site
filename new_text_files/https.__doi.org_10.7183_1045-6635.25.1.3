
MOBILE COMMUNITIES AND PASTORALIST LANDSCAPES DURING 
THE FORMATIVE PERIOD IN THE CENTRAL ALTIPLANO OF 
BOLIVIA 

Jose M. Capriles 
The domestication of llamas and alpacas was fundamental for the cultural and economic development of Andean societies, but the origins of came lid pastoralism as a distinct mode of socioeconomic organization remain little understood. Whereas most archaeological interpretations ofprehispanic highland societies emphasize the transition from hunting-gathering to agriculture as a process marked by the establishment of agricultural sedentary villages, other subsistence and mobility strategies have been for the most part overlooked. A case in point is the Wankarani cultural complex from the Central Alti­plano of Bolivia, which has been interpreted as an example of an early village-based sedentary society. Here, I argue that a model of mobile pastoralism based on ethnoarchaeological research better explains the Central Altiplano's Formative period archaeological record. Recently collected data support this proposition. Settlement patterns consisted of multiple dispersed camps attached to residential bases occupied recurrently. Horizontal excavations from a residential base revealed structures and features analogous to pastoralist landscapes documented around the world. Fauna! identification confirmed the preponderance of domesticated came/ids. Based on this evidence, I argue that we need better explanatory frameworks for approaching the origins, organization, and variability associated with early food producing societies such as mobile 
camel id pastoralists.

Sin embargo, el origen de/ pastoreo de camelidos como un distintivo modo de organizaci6n socioecon6mica permanece poco entendido.

Como ejemplo estd el complejo cultural Wankarani def Perfodo Formativo del altiplano central de Bolivia, que ha sido previamente caracterizado como un ejemplo de sociedad temprana basada en aldeas. En contraste, aqui se propane que un modelo de pastoreo m6vil basado en investigaci6n etnoarqueol6gica y etnogrdfica explica mejor el registro arqueol6gico del Perfodo Formativo en altiplano central. Datos recientemente recolectados de prospecci6n, excava­ci6n y andlisis de fauna apoyan es ta proposici6n. los patrones de asentamiento consistieron de multiples campamentos dis­persos conectados a bases residenciales ocupadas recurrentemente.

La identificaci6n de fauna confirm6 la preponderancia de camelidos domesticados coma la base dietetica, pero tambien el consumo generalizado de recur sos silvestres, probablemente procurados durante paseos de pastoreo .

camelid pastoralism. How did increased reliance on animal herding affect processes of population aggregation and sedentarization? Was early camelid pastoralism related to specific mobility strategies? How were early pastoralist landscapes structured? 
Situated above 3 ,600 m asl and spanning from Lake Titicaca to the Atacama Desert, the Altiplano forms the broadest continuous highland terrain in 
the Andes (Figure 1). The shores of Lake Titicaca have the most productive conditions for agricul­ture, and during the Formative period (1 500 
B.C. -A.D. 500) witnessed the emergence of 
sedentism and sociopolitical complexity (Alba­rracin-Jordan 2007; Hastorf2008; Janusek 2008; Kolata 2003; Stanish 2003). Toward the south, the central and southern highlands are increasingly arid and possess comparatively inferior environ­mental conditions for plant cultivation, but his­torical ly sustained some of the largest popula­tions of llamas in the Andes (Bonavia 2008; Cardozo 1981; Nielsen 2009). Unfortunately, the significance of camelid herding in the Central Altiplano has been understated in archaeological narratives, which emphasize the role of agricul­

search associated with the Wankarani cultural complex provides a good example. 
Carlos Ponce ( 1970) defined the Wankarani culture by the presence of mounded settlements 
formed by overlapping layers of domestic occu­pations composed of circular houses wit h stone foundations and adobe walls, undecorated ce­ramics, and the occurrence of large stone sculp­tures probably representing llama heads (Figure 
2). Because some Wankarani sites had a mound­like appearance and deep stratigraphy, Ponce ( 1980) used the analogy of Near Eastern tells for interpreting these sites as ancient overlapping vil­lages. In fact, extrapolating from Gordon Childe's ( 1951) theory of the origin of civilization in the Near East, Ponce (1970 , 1972, 1980) speculated that the Wankarani, along with Chiripa (a culture distributed on the southeastern shores of Lake Titicaca), formed the village (i. e. , Neolithic) stage and societal substrate that preceded the emer­gence of the Tiwanaku urban revolution. 
More recent research regarding the Formative period of the Central Altiplano has focused on un­
derstanding the spatial distribution and early res­idential life ofWankarani settlements (Ayala et al. 2008; Bermann and Estevez 1995; Fox 2007; McAndrews 1998; Rose 2001a). This work has broadened our comprehension of the Wankarani cultural complex by providing new insights into its settlement location, material culture, and chronology. Nevertheless, the assumption that Wankarani settlements consisted of permanently occupied sedentary agricultural villages remained unchallenged as the predominant interpretation of this society (e.g., Bruhns 1994; Janusek 2004; Kolata 1993; Moseley 2001). 
In this paper, I revisit current interpretations of the Wankarani cultural complex by utilizing a theoretical perspective that emphasizes the mate­rial correlates of pastoralist societies. Based on a comparative framework for approaching the ar­chaeology of pastoralist landscapes, I analyze settlement patterns, site structure, and fauna] data recently collected from the region of lroco in the 
Central Altiplano of Bolivia. As a result, I suggest that the Wankarani cultural complex was an ex-

ample of early herding society, constituted not by aggregated sedentary agriculturists but by com­munities of mobile pastoralists. 
Mobile Pastoralism as a Social and Economic Subsistence System 
Pastoralism is an economic subsistence system based on animal husbandry and mobility (Cribb 1991; Dyson-Hudson and Dyson-Hudson 1980; Ingold 1980; Khazanov 1994; Salzman 2004). The most important product of pastoralism is the transformation of plant cellulose into energy, which herders can directly utilize as meat protein, fat, marrow, blood, and milk. Other animal hus­bandry-derived products and services include milk by-products, animal power for transportation and traction, dung for fuel and fertilizer, and raw material from fiber, hides, bones, and horns. Al­though pastoralist societies generally comple­ment their subsistence activities with other tasks such as cultivation, exchange, and even hunting and gathering, their primary goal is to secure for­age and protection for their animal herds. Conse­quently, pastoralism is more than an economic ac­tivity and includes other ecological, social, political, and ideological aspects (Chang 2006; Gifford-Gonzales 2005). 

Different pastoralist strategies evolved in di­verse regions of the world, especially in environ­ments where agriculture was risky, unproductive, or altogether unfeasible (Frachetti 2008). Because cultivation in arid and semi-arid grassland envi­ronments is hampered by (among other factors) poor soils, low water availability, and low and un­predictable year-to-year rainfall, pastoralism in these ecosystems is generally a more efficient subsistence strategy than farming (Marshall et al. 2011). Moreover, pastoralism is often considered an optimal risk management strategy in certain environments because it allows coping with en­vironmental variability by relying on mobile liv­ing animals rather than on spatially bounded an­nual harvests (Browman 1987, 1997). 
Through mobility, pastoralist communities uti­lize their landscape in diverse ways and accord­ing to different economic, social, and environ­mental constraints. Variable levels of residential and logistical mobility characterize pastoralist societies because herds require different feeding grounds or pastures as previous ones become de­pleted (Abdi 2003; Cribb 1991). These move­ments often involve repeated residential reloca­tion that can occur at different time scales, from seasonal to yearly to decadal and even centennial, depending on a combination of ecological and so­cial factors. Khazanov ( 1994) identified mobility as one of the central aspects associated with pas­toralist societies, and therefore classified it in a continuum that ranges from fully nomadic to al­most sedentary. Moreover, Binford's (1980) hunter-gatherer strategies of residential and lo­gistical mobility have also been successfully ap­plied to mobile pastoralist groups (Chang 2006). A more recent conceptualization of mobility in­volves assessing combinations of variables in terms of moment (length of movement), motion (pattern of the movement), motivation (reason for movement), and segment (social groups in­volved) (Wendrich and Barnard 2008). 
Andean herding communities share a number of similarities with pastoralist societies around the world. In the Andes, indigenous peoples pro­vide an outstanding source of comparative analo­gies for reconstructing ancient pastoralism. Ethno­graphers and ethnohistorians have described the basic features of a number of herding communities in the Andes (Abercrombie 1998; Browman 1974; Dedenbach-Salazar 1990; Dransart 2002; Flores 1979; Medinacelli 2010; Orlove 1977; Wachtel 2001). Of course, as with every other source of analogy, not all of this information can be directly applied to the archaeological record. Modern An­dean communities have not persisted unchanged, yet ethnoarchaeological studies provide a major source for constructing well-informed relational analogies about specific aspects of the archaeo­logical record left behind by ancient societies (Wylie 2002). Certainly, ethnoarchaeological re­search has been carried out on a number of mod­ern herding communities addressing aspects as varied as organization of domestic space, demog­raphy, landscape management, formation processes, and caravan exchange (Aldenderfer 2001; Caracotche 2001; Flannery et al. 1989; Kuz­nar 1995, 2001; Lane 2009; Nielsen 2000; Nunez and Nielsen 2011; Tomka 1994; Tripcevich 2007). 
Together these data can be used to infer a gen­eral model of Andean mobile pastoralism that, in terms of regional configuration, would be charac-

terized by dispersed residential bases, usually oc­cupied by single nuclear households, and associ­ated with logistical and seasonal occupied herding camps and miscellaneous landscape features such as roads, trails, and religious sites. In contrast to permanently settled agricultural villages, these settlements should be small, dispersed, and pro­visional. At the settlement level, features present in contemporary and historic pastoralist residential bases typically include a residential compound attached to animal handling facilities such as cor­rals. Residential compounds consist of dormitory and storage structures, indoor and outdoor work­ing and cooking areas with hearths, animal butchering areas, windbreaks, trash disposal mid­dens and pits, and piles of fuel (Kuznar 1995:55-56; Tomka 1994, 2001; Yacobaccio and Madero 2001). Animal penning facilities usually include one to a few corrals of different sizes, as well as piles of animal dung. Herding camps should typically include features such as small sheltered areas, corrals, caches of artifacts, and a preponderance of discarded domesticated camelid bone remains (Kuznar 1995:56; Tomka 1993). In addition, given the high rate of mobility that char­acterizes most herding societies, the location of these features will shift and involve frequent aban­donment and reoccupation cycles that, in time, should result in the creation of a pastoralist land­scape (Frachetti 2008). 
The aforementioned attributes are present in ethnographically observed Aymara herding com­munities of the Central Altiplano (Cuenca et al. 2005). Here, pastoralists move between their jach'a uta, or main residences and attached cor­rals, and their anaqa, or pastures, which are spread throughout different seasonally variable microenvironments where they keep different temporary camps known as janta (L6pez 2003). These places frequently contain material accu­mulations of many generations of use and have names and stories that document the long-term history of their utilization memorialized through various rituals (Abercrombie 1998). 
Archaeological sites that were created and oc­cupied by pastoralist groups in the Altiplano are hypothesized to include a settlement organiza­tion and site structure that resembles attributes of the model outlined above. More specifically, if the Wankarani cultural complex was an example of early camelid pastoralist society, I expect to ob­serve intersite settlement patterns and intrasite structure features consistent with a cross-cultural pastoralist model of spatial organization. Alter­natively, the presence of sedentary villages should include evidence of large nucleated settlements composed of multi-room residential compounds, corporate architecture (i.e., temples), and land­scape features such as large storage facilities, agricultural fields, and terraces (Bandy and Fox 2010; Flannery 1972, 2002). Furthermore, early settled agricultural village life has been connected to the Neolithic demographic transition, a process characterized by a sharp increase in population growth variously manifested in the archaeologi­cal record as sharp increases in settlement num­ber, size, and frequencies of buried individuals (Bandy 2005; Bellwood and Oxenham 2008; Bocquet-Appel 2002). 
Materials and Methods 
I carried out survey and excavations in Iroco, a re­gion located within the Central Altiplano of Bo­livia, and the known distribution area of the For­mative period Wankarani cultural complex (Capriles 2011 ; Capriles et al. 2011 ) . The Iroco landscape consists of alluvial plains, foothills, and hill-slopes covered by open grasslands and shrublands, which produce optimal visibility and accessibility conditions for carrying out archaeo­logical research. I implemented a high-intensity full-coverage survey to characterize the settle­ment patterns of the study area for the entire pe­riod of human occupation but primarily for the Formative period. The survey boundaries were constrained by the extent of the communities of Cochiraya, Iroco, and Chuzekery, and the north­ern shore of Lake Uru-Uru. 
During survey a "site" was operationalized as a discrete concentration of archaeological arti­facts with a density greater than one artifact per square meter and/or visible evidence of architec­ture such as terraces, walls or burials. Spacing be­tween surveyors varied between 5 and 15 m. The perimeter of every site was determined in the field and recorded with the track function of a GPS. Each site was assigned to one or more of the following cultural components: Archaic, Forma­tive, Tiwanaku, Carangas/Sora (Late Intermediate

period), Inca, Colonial, Republican, and indeter­minate. To specify the layout and activities that took place in the Formative period settlements, I carried out horizontal excavations in one settle­ment, KCH21. Faunal analysis involved identifi­cation of all the bone specimens recovered from the excavations to the most specific taxonomic level (Reitz and Wing 2008). 
Iroco Formative Period Settlement Patterns 
An area of 38 .35 km2 was surveyed and a total of 45 Formative period sites were recorded (Figure 3). The cumulative surface area of these sites is 
14.51 ha. The average site size is .32 ha (s= .48), and the density of recorded settlements amounted to 1.17 sites per km2• The nearest neighbor aver­age distance between sites was 212 m, suggesting a strong clustering pattern (expected mean dis­tance = 508 m, nearest neighbor ratio = .42, Z score= -7.48,p < .001). 
The Formative period settlements at Iroco con­sisted of relatively dense surface scatters of ce­ramic sherds, stone tools, and eroding architecture (Capriles et al. 2011). Only 10 sites were larger than .5 ha, and these have substantial evidence of domestic occupation. If just these 10 large sites are analyzed, the results of the nearest neighbor analysis suggest a pattern of dispersion (observed mean distance = 1018 m, expected mean distance 

= 592 m, nearest neighbor ratio= 1. 72, Z score = 4.34,p < .001) and support the interpretation of these sites as residential bases. In fact, large set­tlements typically include surface architecture, including wall foundations of circular and semi­circular structures composed of large boulders, patches of burned ground, and high densities of fragmented ceramics. Some of the larger sites seem to have formed as a consequence of redun­dant occupation and reoccupation of the same lo­cation over time. The average height of the 10 largest sites is 1.25 m (s= .82), and in this respect they strongly resemble the mounds typically as­sociated with the Wankarani cultural complex elsewhere (Figure 4) (Hermann and Estevez 1995; Ponce 1970; Walter 1966; Wasson 1967). 
The rest of the Formative period sites (n= 35) were mostly identified as artifact dispersions and were probably occupied as logistical temporary or seasonal herding camps. Although several of these sites are located very close to larger sites, this is consistent with temporary logistical mobility. Be­cause of their composition and content, it is also unlikely that all of these sites were occupied si­multaneously and continuously throughout the Formative period. Nevertheless, some of the small sites clearly had significant and dense occupations suggesting recurrent reoccupation. The distribu­tion of settlements suggests the existence of five to seven clusters of residential bases associated with herding camps. These clusters follow the eastern shore of the Karakollu River and the west­ern foothills in strategic and intermediate loca­tions for utilizing various microenvironments. 

During survey, no evidence of large settle­ments or visible corporate architecture was noted, and the only terraces discovered seem to be dated to the subsequent Tiwanaku period. More impor­tantly, the settlement pattern associated with the Formative period seems to reflect a broad use of the available space to optimize access to grazing areas. Sites are located in relation to accessibility for key resources such as springs and seasonally available pastures. The spacing between residen­tial sites and the scattered distribution of small camps is compatible with a model of camelid pastoralism. 
Site Structure and Composition in Iroco 
Site KCH2 l, also known as Irucirca, is a one-me­ter high mound that roughly covers .55 ha. The site was discovered in 2002 and excavated in 2005 and 2007 (Albarracin-Jordan 2005: 110-144; Capriles 2008:33-50). In total, 413 m2 were ex­posed in a single continuous block (Figure 5). Ex­cavations emphasized horizontal exposure, so whenever floors and well-preserved features were discovered, excavations proceeded in adjacent blocks (Figure 6). The exposed occupation layout corresponds to structures and features from three overlapping components or occupation levels. Stratigraphically, the site overlays sandy-clay loam strata of graded bedded natural alluvium and illuviated oxidized reddish clays. 
The Lower Level is composed of a series of cir­cular to sub-circular structures along with a num­ber of additional features and outdoor activity ar­eas. Although the presence of actual adobe blocks suggests that these structures were built with mud

bricks, because of preservation it is not clear whether some walls might have been built also with tapia and/or sod blocks. At least eight circu­lar to semicircular structures were identified and exposed during excavations. These structures vary between 2.4 and 3.7 min diameter and 3.7 and 8.8 min surface area (Table 1). Dark and organically rich fill overlay the slightly concave compacted clay floors of these structures, giving them the ap­pearance of semi-subterranean buildings. Only three of the circular structures contained a central hearth, but there seems to be no correlation be­tween structure size and presence of heart hs. In­terestingly enough, the smaller and more regularly shaped structures have hearths in their interior, whereas the larger more amorphous structures contain pits in their interiors and exteriors. A pre­liminary interpretation of this pattern suggests that the circular structures included residential do­mestic activities such as sleeping, heating, and possibly cooking. The larger semicircular struc­tures might have served mostly storage purposes. 
Small (20-70 cm) circular pits are located both inside and outside the structures and surround most structures. The diversity in size, shape, dis­
tribution, and contents of the pits, suggests mul­tiple functions, including storage, trash disposal, and even supporting large concave jars. Some pits are located immediately adjacent to the walls, suggesting that these might have been post molds and that some pits were excavated after aban­donment. Even though the distribution of the structures throughout the excavated portion of the Lower Level seems uneven, at least three groupings or clusters of two to three structures were identified (west, center, and east). The in­termediate spaces between these groupings con­tain a number of features suggesting that several activities occurred in the exterior of the struc­tures. Outside activity areas are delimited by the structures themselves, as well as by collapsed adobe walls, suggesting the presence of addi­tional structures and/or patio walls. Outside areas also include the presence of circular pits, organic stains, middens, ground stones, and hearths, al ong with varying densities of cultural materials, sug­gesting that various activities took place in these locations.

A final occupation level recorded at KCH21 includes two linear north-to-south collapsed walls of rock boulders located in the northeast, an as­sociated occupation surface, and a dog burial in the northwest of the site. The rocks for the walls seem to have been reutilized from dismantling the walls of Structure I. Although the chronology of this level is uncertain, the sporadic presence ofTi­wanaku ceramics suggests that following the abandonment of the Upper Level, the site might have continued to be used as a temporary or short duration herding camp. 
A set of 11 radiocarbon dates (Table 2) bracket the lower and upper occupation levels of KCH21 between 202 cal B.C. and 231 calA.D. The over­lap between these levels is not completely verti­cal, an attribute typically observed in Wankarani settlements (Fox 2007; Rose 200la). Considering that the entire occupation of the site did not extend over a long period of time, the frequent remodel­ing of the site suggests dynamic cycles of occu­pation and abandonment possibly related to sea­sonal, yearly, or intergenerational residential mo­bility patterns. Furthermore, excavations suggest that, although a few additional structures might be present towards the northeast, less than ten struc­tures were occupied in the entire settlement at any given time. 

Faunal Remains from Jroco 
The fauna! assemblage from KCH21 included21 non-overlapping taxa, dominated by camelids (Table 3). Other frequent taxa included killifishes, coots, ducks, flamingoes, deer, tuco-tuco gophers, and various aquatic and terrestrial birds. A scallop and a mussel from the Pacific Ocean that were as­sociated with ritual offerings were the only iden­tified non-highland taxa. With some exceptions, such as tuco-tuco gophers and dogs, most speci­mens of wild fauna had evidence of direct human consumption, such as cut or burning marks, sug­gesting that procurement of wild resources from

different highland microenvironments comple­mented came lid herding ( Capriles 2011). Fish are surprisingly abundant using the number of iden­tified specimens (NISP) as the quantification unit, but if weight is used instead, camelid bones rep­resent over 90 percent of the identified taxa. Moreover, fish remains are mostly found in a few specific trash pit features, as opposed to camelids, which are ubiquitous throughout the site. 

Given the difficulty of identifying camelid bone fragments to a species level, I relied on morphometric approaches to assess size varia­tion and ultimately interspecific determination. Figure 8 compares a modem average llama stan­dard (Kent 1982) to log-transformed measure­ments from various postcranial elements (Meadow 1999). The results suggest that most an­imals in the assemblage group were of the aver­age size of modem llamas, but also that a wide va­riety of smaller and larger individuals (such as wild vicufia and guanaco) are present in the as­semblage. 
In sum, fauna! identification shows several things, most importantly, that camelid, and more specifically llamas, dominate the lroco Formative period assemblages. In correspondence with pa­leoclimatologic reconstructions, fauna! data also verify that the local environment was seasonally humid (Rigsby et al. 2005), which would have fa­vored the abundance of locally available wild re­sources in tandem with the expansion of pas­toralist communities. 
Pastoralist Landscapes, Mobility, and 
Wankarani Villages 


Ethnographically and ethnoarchaeologically doc­umented modem pastoralist settlement systems in the Andes and elsewhere in the world are charac­terized by residential bases located near high­quality grazing areas and complemented by a complex set of temporal and seasonally occupied logistical herding camps (e.g., Bernbeck 2008; Cribb 1991; Flores 1979; Kuznar 1990, 1995; Tomka 1994, 2001; Vining 2011; Wendrich and Barnard 2008). In contrast to this expectation, Formative period Wankarani cultural complex sites have been described previously as strati­graphically complex mounds and interpreted as permanently occupied agricultural villages (Bermann and Estevez I 995; Fox 2007, 2010; McAndrews 1998, 2005a; Ponce 1970; Rose 200 I a, 200 I b). Comparing the results of the Iroco survey with those of the La Joya survey carried out by Timothy McAndrews (2005b), currently the only other available regional survey from the Central Altiplano, I illustrate why the Wankarani intersite spatial organization is better explained by a pastoralist model than by an agricultural one. 
The survey carried out by McAndrews ( 1998, 2005a) covers an area of 427 km2 (comprising the areas of La Joya, Rfo Kochi, and Belen) in which 18 Formative period sites were identified, pro­ducing a density of .04 sites per km2 (Figure 9). These sites have a mean size of I .12 ha (s = .53), height of 2.72 m (s = 1.9), and distance to their

The mean site size and distance to the nearest neighbor was also signifi­cantly different between the La Joya and Iroco surveys. If the smallest sites recorded in Iroco (< .5 ha) are excluded from the comparison, several differences between the two datasets persist and some important similarities are underscored.

vary considerably among sites recorded in the two surveys, and this is probably a consequence of the much larger area sampled in La Joya. 
The spacing between sites is also substantially greater in La Joya than in Iroco. Unlike the dis­persion observed within the Iroco settlement pat­tern, the Formative sites in La Joya­independently of the actual distance between them-show an evenly spread distribution (ob-

served mean distance = 3 ,518 m, expected mean distance= 4,092 m, nearest neighbor ratio= .85, Z score= -1.13, p = .255). Moreover, although several sites in Iroco have the shape of mounds, the sites in La Joya are on average a meter and a half taller than sites in Iroco. 
The strongest similarity between the two areas is the size of the sites themselves. However, this equivalence disappears if all the smaller sites ( < .5 ha) recorded in the Iroco survey are included in the comparison. Given the available information, it seems that methodological differences between the studies accentuated the observed variation. Notable differences between the two studies in­clude the absence of sites smaller than .5 ha in La 
Joya and the closely spaced distribution of sites in Iroco. I attribute these dissimilarities to differen­tial survey intensity, mostly consisting of closer spacing between surveyors and detailed mapping of artifact distributions during survey, providing an increasingly detailed settlement dataset for the Iroco study area. The survey intensity employed in Iroco permitted the identification of both large residential sites and smaller camps (see Alden­derfer 2002). In addition, observations from the Iroco survey suggest that some of the large resi­dential sites were not particularly tall mounds 
and that some of the camps included especially dense material accumulations. These results im­ply that some Formative period sites in La Joya, 

Rfo Kochi, and Belen might have been over­looked during survey, and also may explain why the recorded sites (x = 2.72 m) are about 1.5 m taller than the Iroco sites (x = 1.25 m). 
McAndrews (200 l) hypothesized that 

Wankarani "villages" fissioned before reaching the carrying capacity of their individual catchment areas and, consequently, that settlement densities were related to social stress, as opposed to eco­logical productivity. The catchment areas esti­mated by McAndrews were, however, derived from archaeological agricultural village settle­ment systems from the Mantaro Valley in Peru and the central Valley of Mexico (i. e. , Hastorf 1993; Sanders et al. 1979 ), and not on more ap­propriate ecological requirements such as those of Altiplano herding communities (see Vining 2011 ). Furthermore, Fox (2007) has tested McAndrews's model of Wankarani village fissioning and found no evidence to suggest that a hypothesized mother (and larger) village of Chuquifia was older than a hypothesized daughter (and smaller) village of Pusno. Instead, Fox (2010) proposes a peer-com­munity system in which pastoralism constrained

population growth by requiring greater mobility 
and larger catchment areas. In tum, higher mo­
bility would have inhibited aspects associated 
with village life, such as reduced birth spacing 
and increased demands for agricul tural labor (Fox 2010:203). Although these propositions are plau­sible and testable, they rely on the settlement pat­tern postulated by McAndrews (1998, 2005a), which the Iroco results suggest is an artifact of survey intensity. 
The Iroco survey provides some interesting insights into the Wankarani cultural complex set­tlement system. Based on the collected data, it seems unlikely that the Wankarani cultural com­plex settlement system corresponded to a village system. Most of the previously identified Wankarani "villages, " I argue, were actually res­idential bases, which, due to their specific loca­tion, tended to be reoccupied more frequently than other sites (see Bernbeck 2008). Perma­nently occupied villages with evidence of corpo­
rate architecture, cemeteries, plazas, and other such features were probably few, if not com­pletely absent. The fact that the majority of doc­umented sites are smaller than two hectares and possibly occupied by as few as a single household during any given time further supports the infer­ence that multi-household settlements were ex­tremely uncommon. In effect, Bandy (2008), in a recent comparative study, used the Wankarani as an example of a society in which large villages (defined by the existence of 300 people occupy­ing an area of at least 3 ha) never developed. Fi­nally, the Wankarani settlement system strongly contrasts with previous Archaic period hunter­gatherer modes of economic organization 
(Capriles et al. 2011). However, I hypothesize that the apparent Neolithic demographic transition in the Central Altiplano during the Formative pe­riod is an artifact of recurrent residential mobility associated with increased reliance on camelid pastoralism.

Wankarani Settlements as Pastoralist Residential Bases 

Modem pastoralist residential bases are charac­terized by the presence of diverse structures and features related to domestic, storage, and animal penning activities (e.g., Delfino 2001; Kuznar 1990, 1995; Nielsen 2000, 2001; Tomka 1994, 2001; Yacobaccio and Madero 2001). Based on these ethnoarchaeological expectations, I hy­pothesized that the layouts of the Wankarani sites included features that were the locus of analogous activities. Based on structure size and function, the identified features can be classified into three comparable categories: domestic structures, stor­age features, and corrals. 


Evidence from KCH21 suggests that domestic structures were used for various purposes. The presence of multiple structures, including resi­dential habitation, as well as storage, is apparent. For instance, structures that included hearths on their interior were probably used for residential activities such as food processing and tool main­tenance. These structures also probably articu­lated broader residential space. There also seems to be an association between shape, contents, and function. For instance, the structures associated with hearths from the Lower Level had more cir­cular shapes than those that were not associated with hearths. Furthermore, the structures that did not have hearths had, on average, more pit fea­tures and comparatively more irregular shapes. A possible interpretation for this pattern is that cir­cular structures with hearths were used as do­mestic residences, whereas the other structures were mostly utilized for storage. In this sense, the Formative period settlements were not occupied by various individual households, but possibly by single households that used several structures for different purposes. 
The complex layout of KCH2 l also included a number of other features, including interior and exterior pits, hearths, and outside activity areas. The pits were probably produced for a number of reasons, as they show a great deal of variability in size, shape, and content. However, the most im­portant processes related to pit production were probably storage and trash disposal. Pits used for storage contain caches of tools, including large ce­ramic storage jars with round bases, lithic hoes, ground stone implements, and camelid bone tools. As part of the settlement use and in connection with abandonment processes, several of these pits were transformed into disposal features. Some of these features included high densities of lithic flakes, camelid bones, and/or thousands of fish bones and scales (Capriles 2011). 


Moreover, the construction, abandonment, and reconstruction dynamics associated with these structures suggest short-term (and probably sea­sonal) cycles of residential mobility. Indeed, at KCH21, most structures have a thick, often lam­inated, fill on top of the floors. These could be a consequence of post-abandonment dumping of successive layers of trash, but they could also be related to reoccupation events (see Schiffer et al. 1987). Although people seem to have reoccupied the same building over and over again in a num­ber of cases, evidence from KCH21 suggests that multiple structures were abandoned and con­structed on a regular basis. Interestingly enough, recurrent reoccupation is a typical pattern ob­served in the stratigraphy of previously studied Wankarani sites. 
Several ethnoarchaeologists have shown that herding residential bases have multiple structures and are frequently abandoned and reoccupied. Delfino (2001) has shown empirically that the size of these compounds is not necessarily corre­lated with the number of people that inhabit them, but with the age of the head of household. Cycles of residential bases are initiated with the estab­lishment of new nuclear families. Eventually these sites are abandoned, effectively completing a household life cycle. Because of the strategic ecological and social location of these sites , it does not take long before a new household reoc­cupies the location , yet most of the infrastructure is entirely rebuilt. Comparable processes describe the occupation of pastures and seasonal camps. 
Archaeologically, Wankarani sites are charac­terized by recurrent reoccupation, and the Iroco data suggest that some of the factors that could have favored occupation redundancy included access to good pastures, benefiting from existing infrastructure, and herd territoriality. The repeti­tion of this process for several generations would have resulted in formation of deep, stratified, and relatively dispersed mounds, along with remains of residential and logistical camps scattered

throughout the landscape. Furthermore, reoccu­pying the same locations over time, as well as burying their dead at these sites, could have con­stituted a strong symbolic referent for legitimiz­ing territoriality by constructing and reinforcing social memory (Hastorf 2003). 
During the excavations at KCH2 I, the remains of at least one large architectural feature, Structure I , were identified as exhibiting the attributes of a herding corral. Structure 1 is delimited by large boulders of calcite, several of which had circular perforations that might have served for attaching poles. The interior fill of the structure is mostly clean of artifacts, but a few bones, ceramics, and lithics were recovered from its interior. Struc­tures of similar size, construction material, and layout have been identified in Formative period sites in the neighboring La Joya area. Rose (200la, 200lb) exposed at least three of these structures in her excavations at La Barca, and Fox (2007) documented a few partial circular walls of structures larger than 5 m in diameter in his deep excavation trenches at Pusno and Chuquifia. In addition, Beaule (2002) documented the foundations of several large circular struc­tures in her site plan of the Tiwanaku period site of Jachakala. 
Rose (200 I a:97-99) compared the three large features she found in La Barca with Kuznar's (1990) ethnoarchaeological expectations, but re­jected the possibility that these were corrals. Ac­cording to Rose (200 l a:98), the La Barca features were too small (less than 68 m2), did not include distinctive floors of compacted clay of blocky structure, were relatively clean of faunal remains, and were sometimes associated with human buri­als. The area outside these structures included dense middens that contained high densities of artifacts such as ceramic tubes and figurines, which led Rose (2001a) to believe that the struc­tures were used for ritual purposes. Nevertheless, I argue that the size, shape, and construction ma­terials fit with modem examples of corrals. The use of large boulders as foundations and even the attachment of poles to enlarge the structure are common throughout the Andes. The clean interior is also common because having artifacts around could harm herding animals, especially juveniles. Furthermore, these structures were probably kept clean by recurrent collection of dung for fuel and fertilizer. The fact that the structure floors of the corrals at Iroco and La Barca were not composed of hard compact clay with blocky structure (as suggested by Kuznar 1990, 1995) is a consequence of site formation processes characteristic of the study area, including the combined action of bio­logical activity, precipitation, and weathering. 
All of this is not to say that ceremonial activi­ties did not take place in corrals-in fact, ethno­historic and ethnographic information suggests they are primary loci for ritual activities (Aber­crombie 1998; Bonavia 2008; Browman 1974; Flannery et al. 1989; Flores 1979; Kuznar 1995; Medinacelli 2003; Mengoni-Gofialons 2008; Nielsen 2001; Tomka 1994). For instance, corrals and patios are the places where animals are grouped before ceremonies such as marking rites, when they are decorated with ear tassels. The spe­cific ceremonial meaning of corrals is also im­portant in Andean culture. Two words in Aymara describe corral, uyu and cachi (Medinacelli 2003:22). The word cachi also associates the meaning of corral with enclosure and cemetery. In­terestingly enough, some burials attached to cor­rals in Iroco and La Barca have been documented. 
Nevertheless, the primary role of corrals is economic. Corrals are used for protecting herding animals from predators during nights and as bases for sleeping. Camelids are territorial, and having specific sleeping grounds is one of their behav­ioral traits (see Franklin 1983). In addition, cor­rals are used as locations for accumulating dung (used both for fuel and fertilizer). Medinacelli (2003:21), based on ethnohistoric information, also points out that corrals were used for group­ing and separating herds. Animals were often classified into groups according to sex, age, color, and fiber quality. Sorting animals by these or any other visible trait is one of the most common forms of artificial selection. Corrals are also used for curing and separating sick animals. At a land­scape level, corrals are regularly used as territor­ial markers for separating herds, households, and even communities. Corrals in this sense are in­strumental in the process of animal management, and their presence in Formative period sites pro­vides strong support for economic reliance on camelid mobile pastoralism. 
In addition, faunal evidence verified that llama herding was the central subsistence activity, albeit

complemented with a diverse meat diet, including a range of small prey, which could have been procured opportunistically during logistical herd­ing trips. Wankarani herders could have opti­mized herd growth and use of derived products and services with occasional hunting and gather­ing. A broad diet breadth is frequently related to resource stress but can also be the consequence of opportunistic hunting during herding trips. Op­portunistic and even seasonally planned procure­ment of wild resources is a common practice among many ethnographically documented pas­toralist societies (Cribb 1991; Khazanov 1994). Moreover, camelid newborns are rarely present, and migratory birds such as flamingoes are fre­quent in the analyzed assemblages, which sug­gests that some of KCH21 was probably occupied during the dry season. Nevertheless, more re­search is required to fully explore the potential of these and other datasets (see Capriles 2011). 
From a comparative perspective, the site struc­ture documented at Iroco (Figure 10) is similar to that reported in other Formative period Wankarani cultural complex sites such as Huancarani, Chuquiiia, La Barca, Pusno, San Andres, and Uspa Uspa (Bermann and Estevez 1995; Condarco et al. 2002; Fox 2007; Rose 200 lb; Ponce 1970; Walter 1966; Wasson 1967). Each of these sites was prob­ably occupied by a single household at a time. In­deed, a recent comparative study using multidi­mensional scaling analysis of artifacts from domestic structures at Chuquiiia and Pusno pro­duced small inter-household variation, strongly suggesting very low levels of social differentiation (Drennan et al. 2010). These results might also be related to residential mobility, as narrow assem­blage variation can be a consequence of recurring seasonally scheduled activities. 
Wankarani sites also share some attributes with other Altiplano settlements such as Chullpa Playa in Potosi (Lecoq 2001) and some sites in the Puripica and Tulan valleys of northern Chile (Nunez 2005), as these settlements seem to have been occupied by a few families that relied on an­imal herding. Tulan 54 is an exceptional case be­cause even though it is a mounded settlement, its architectural and ritual features suggest complex ceremonial behavior, albeit strongly related to

camelid pastoralism (Nunez et al. 2006). In con­trast, the well-preserved multi-room sites of Guat­acondo, Ramaditas, Tulor 1, and others located in the Tarapaca and Atacama deserts are signifi­cantly larger and organizationally more complex than most Wankarani sites (Ayala et al. 2008; Graffam et al. I 996; Nunez 2005; Nunez and Santoro 2011). This is also true about most For­mative period settlements from the southern Lake Titicaca basin, such as Chiripa, Kala Uyuni, and Khonko Wankane, where survey and excavation data support the emergence of large villages oc­cupied by several families and complex ceremo­nial architecture during the Formative period (Bandy 2004; Hastorf 2008; Janusek 2008). Not surprisingly, all of these sites are associated with strong agricultural components during the For­mative period, and the southern Lake Titicaca basin witnessed primary state formation at the end of this time. 
Conclusions: Wankarani Pastoralist Landscapes from a Comparative Perspective 
The results of the archaeological survey and ex­cavations at Iroco suggest that the spatial config­uration of the Formative period Wankarani cul­tural complex resembles that of typical herding communities around the world (Abdi 2003; Chang and Koster 1986; Cribb 1991; Frachetti 2008; Wendrich and Barnard 2008). Intersite vari­ability in settlement patterns consisted of resi­dential bases complemented by temporarily oc­cupied logistical camps, and excavations at a residential base revealed well-preserved evidence of animal herding and residential mobility. Pas­toralist mobility and the creation of different kinds of sites are usually related to different micro-en­vironmental conditions (or resource patches). Be­cause of the longitudinal variation of the survey area (with Lake Uru-Uru to the west and a range of hills to the east), the documented distribution of sites seems to correlate well with the environ­mental distribution of aquatic environments, al­luvial plains, and hill slopes, with most residen­tial bases located in intermediate places such as foothills. Consistent with the dynamism of pas­toralist settlement systems, it seems that the lo­cation and contents of these sites reflect the ac­cumulated remains of many generations of various sizes, containing several superimposed herding occupations. The excavation of KCH21, where a minimum of three discrete levels with different configurations were documented, con­firms the complexity of intrasite formation processes influenced by herding mobility. It is not surprising that mobile pastoralism developed in the Central Altiplano, as it has been proven to be an effective economic system to manage envi­ronmental and social risk. 
To recognize that Wankarani settlements were occupied by mobile pastoralists is significant for a number of reasons. First, it helps to make sense of the archaeological record of a society that was previously seen as anomalous but is actually char­acterized by different processes of organizational and institutional complexity. Secondly, it facili­tates framing the variability associated with these occupations not in terms of truncated develop­ment, but as dynamic adaptations to fluctuating environmental and social constraints. Thirdly, it allows us to ask general comparative questions about specific trajectories and processes associ­ated with early pastoralist societies in the Andes and around the world. 
From this new perspective, there are many di­rections for future research, including addressing significant questions about the origins of pas­toralism in the Central Altiplano (Capriles and Albarracin-Jordan 2013) and the subsequent in­tegration of camelid herders into the Tiwanaku political economy. For instance, was mobility used as a resource to enhance or limit the control of the expanding state? Preliminary research from Iroco and other Central Altiplano settlements sug­gests that Altiplano pastoralists expanded the role of mobility to facilitate and even control interre­gional exchange through the establishment of traffic nodes (Bermann and Estevez 1993; Brow­man 1981; Michel 2008; Nunez and Dillehay 1995; Nunez and Nielsen 2011). But how this process took place and what tradeoffs were in­volved remain open questions. 
Finally, the currently accepted interpretation of the Formative period Wankarani cultural com­plex as made up of permanent villages is artificial. The present state of knowledge regarding the Al­tiplano Formative period is biased by a failure to utilize adequate relational analogies and appro­priate archaeological correlates for understanding

herding landscapes and their evolution through time (Frachetti 2012). Disregarding the signifi­cance of mobile pastoralists and emphasizing the role of agriculture in the interpretation of the Al­tiplano people's past, archaeologists have created a narrative that has proven intellectually unpro­ductive for improving our understanding of these societies. Kevin Lane (2010) and Tom Dillehay (2011) have identified and labeled this research bias as "agrocentrism." Moving beyond this standpoint, the by-products of the Wankarani's presence are materialized not as large tumuli com­posed of collapsed villages of fully sedentary agriculturalists, but as cyclically occupied and abandoned compounds, dispersed herding camps, intermittently revisited seasonal pastures, and re­dundantly trampled pathways, still calling for fur­ther research.
