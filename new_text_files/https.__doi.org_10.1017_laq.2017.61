We explore the transformation of a site into a place of remembrance by evaluating the life history of an urn.eld at Cerro de Trincheras, Sonora, Mexico. Prehispanic inhabitants used this cemetery as a cremation burial ground ca. AD 1300–1450. Memory of the cemetery persisted into historical times among inhabitants of the area, but its use changed. We argue that critical and contextualized approaches to cemeteries are needed to understand the complexity of how burial spaces are used through time. 
Exploramos la transformación de un sitio en un espacio de rememoración mediante la evaluación de la historia de vida del cementerio de cremaciones en Cerro de Trincheras, Sonora, México. Los habitantes prehispánicos utilizaron esta área como un cementerio de cremaciones en torno a 1300–1450 dC. El recuerdo del cementerio continuó en tiempos históricos entre los habitantes de la zona, pero su uso cambió, y sólo fueron enterrados unos pocos infantes. Argumentamos que los acercamientos críticos y contextualizados a los cementerios son necesarios para reconstruir la complejidad del uso del espacio funerario a través del tiempo.

erro de Trincheras is a regional center in northern Mexico on the Magdalena River,Sonora(McGuire andVillalpando 2007, 2011, 2015; Villalpando and McGuire 2009). The site has over 900 terraces that sup­ported habitation structures as well as areas for production, rituals, and social gatherings (McGuire and Villalpando 2007, 2011). Cerro deTrincheras was occupied approximatelyAD 1300to1450andwascontemporarywith similar terraced hill sitesin northwest Mexico and the southwestern UnitedStates(Fish et al. 2007). AfterAD1450, population declined drastically; groups continued to occupythe area throughout theprotohistoric period,buttherewasa general abandonment of prehispanic cultural patterns. In AD 1694 Spanish captain Juan Mateo Mange (1993;Manje1954)reportedthe archaeological sitein hisexpeditiondiary. 
Previousexcavations on thehill documented 10 inhumations (McGuire andVillalpando 2011; Villalpando and McGuire2009). Recent archae­ological research located an urn.eld cemeteryat the baseof the hillinasmall mound calledLa Lomade lasCremaciones(Figure1;Villalpando et al. 2009;Watsonetal. 2015). Watson and colleagues (2015) explored formation of the cemetery and theimportance of its creationfor prehispanicinhabitants. 
Webuild andexpand on these early .ndings to investigate transformations of this cemetery space. UnlikeWatson and colleagues(2015), we explore the repurposing and transformation of this cemetery from the prehispanic to historic

periods.Rather than adoptinga static approach, we evaluate how the space was for centuries an area of social negotiation and integration. Cemetery use changed signi.cantly through time, but the special quality of the space as a place of remembrance persevered as it was transformed. We explore these transformations by evaluating different modes of disposal of the dead through time and the repurposing of space. 


Creation of The Cemetery 
Both inhumationburialand cremationwereprac­ticedat CerrodeTrincheras,although cremation was the prevalent mode of interment (Watson et al. 2015). The urn.eld sample comprises 141 prehistoric cremations and three historic infant inhumations.Cremationusually includedatrans­formational process and secondary treatment; remains were often placed in urns and interred away from theplaceof cremation. 
Cremationisan actof deliberatetransforma­tion, going beyond theburning of .esh(Kuijt et al. 2014). There are changes in the percep­tionof the deceasedby society. Theindividual, formerly a living member of the society, is transformed into a new materiality as small, burned bone fragments. 
Followingburningata locationtothe north­westofthehill, remainsweregatheredandplaced insideavesselwith associatedburned objectsand buried in the cemetery at the northern base of thehill. Cremated bones are easily manageable, allowing formanydifferent treatments—as seen in some modern and past societies (Williams et al. 2017). Through the actions of collecting remains, transportingthemtoanewlocation,and buryingthem,a “second body”is created forthe deceased in their ancestral or transformed state (Williams 2004). Remains are more than just fragments; theytell stories andevokememories. TheTrincheras remainsmayhave been usedto constructanewsocial persona forremembrance. Vesselsin whichremains were placed couldhave served asa“newbody,”butdistinctvesselshapes andburial objectsmaintained individuality and personhood. 
Cremated bones of an adult usually weigh 
1.5 kg or more (Cerezo-Román 2015). At

Figure 2. Bone weights and age groups. (Color online) 
Trincheras, cremation bone weights average 721 g per individual. This value is consider­ably higher than the mean masses of Preclas­sic (99.97 g) and Classic period (362.70 g) Hohokam secondary cremation deposits in the Tucson Basin, southernArizona (Cerezo-Román 2015), and some other ancient cremations (e.g., McKinley 1993) where remains are fragmen­tary.Theaveragebone weightoftheTrincheras sample is consistent with complete adults and children(Figure2). Moreover, theinventoryof osteological elements also suggests that most deposits containthe remainsofnearly complete bodies.Thismay indicatethat individualswere transformedby .reintoa different kindof self, but that the individual and individuality were maintained. 


Cemetery Transformations 
Watson and colleagues (2015) proposed that homogeneityinthetreatmentof remainsisasso­ciated with ritual,emphasizing collectiveidentity rather than theindividuality of the deceased. In contrast,wesuggestthata complex sequenceof performances, concerned with transforming and then reconstituting the dead into a new materi­ality, served to mediate remembrance. Through theseprocessesandthe passageoftime,individ­uals were transformed into part of an ancestral collective memory. 
Memorycanbethoughtofaslinkedtoactions, meanings, and experiences (Kuijt 2008), sug­gestingthat thereare general patternsindevelop­ing social memory and commemoration. These include repetitionin observance, reenactmentof some former circumstances, social sanctions for the ceremony, and formality.Kuijt notes thatby reenacting the events, they are legitimized and given authority and meaning. In this way the eventsare understood, coherent, and meaningful to participants. Memory is also time sensitive and dynamic.Its creation occursthrough actions of peoplethat intersect at different social scales. Events and interactions of peopleinvolvedhelp to shape long-term, intergenerational meaning and convert them into a form of collective or communal memory (Kuijt 2008). Memory also changesovertimefromexperientialand personal to abstract and referential. For mourners who knewthe deceased,that memorybeginsasexpe­riential and personal. Through time, however, memory becomes depersonalized and abstract, and the dead merge into an ancestral memory

that is anonymous and collective.Kuijt(2008) further notes that remembrance, regeneration, and forgettingare complementaryinthe creation of secondary mortuary deposits. 
Urn burials are secondary deposits, and we can seethemas symbolic actsthathave complex sets of social, political, and personal meanings. Removing bones from pyres and placing them in highlyvisible locations preservesthe memory ofthe dead.AtTrincheras,the cemeteryisnext to the main settlement, and its location at the northernhill base canbeviewedfrommost points in thesettlement.Mourners alsowereafforded physical views of the cremation .re and subse­quentburial.Fromthesettlement,residentslikely sawsmoke fromcremation.restothe northwest and the emplacement of urns in the cemetery to the north.Thisvisibility suggestsa personal, active, and direct memory and remembrance. 
It alsois likelythatfamiliesof the deceased knew exactly where their family member was buried. Vessels in the urn.eld cemetery were placed near each other (Villalpando et al. 2009; Watson et al. 2015). Occasionally, rocks were placed around the vessels, suggesting that they delimited burial space, although how is not always clear.If viewed fromthe hillside, differ­ences betweeneachurnwouldnotbeas apparent. This suggests that through timethe memoriesof individualsburiedinthe urn.eld becameindirect and referential, transformed into a collective ancestry. Individuals could be reimagined as more general ancestors forthe entire community. 
Vessels were placed closetogether,increasing community cohesion and shared social mem­bership through time. This certainly was not a rapidprocess.Asnewcremations occurred,they engendered memoriesof previous funerals,over time creating a tradition of how to remember and commemorate the dead. It is uncertain when thelasturnswereplacedinthe cemetery,butin historical times the urn.eld was no longer used asacremationburialground,and useofthe space wastransformed. 
Three infant inhumations were deposited in the urn.eld after AD 1450 but their exact chronology is unclear.NavaMaldonado(2013) notes that eachof theseinfantburialswas found underasmallpileof rocks.Associated material included wood fragments and metal screws and nails, and one of the individuals had two shell buttons found on its sternum.NavaMaldonado (2013) compares these with Tohono O’odham and lower Pima infant burials from Arizona, Sonora, and Chihuahua, and suggests that the closestmatchis with O’odhamburial customs. Forexample, atPaloParado (Arizona),Quito­vac(Sonora),ElDivisadero(Chihuahua), and El Olote (Chihuahua), small rock piles were placed over burials, similar to those found at the infant inhumations at Cerro de Trincheras (NavaMaldonado 2013). Other scholars(Brew and Huckell 1987; Hanlon 1972) mention the placement of rocks to cover burials as part of O’odham burial customs in Arizona. The relationship between prehispanic occupants and laterhistoric populationsintheareaisuncertain. Nonetheless, since the urn.eld continued to be used forburials,itislikelythat the ancient useof thespacewasrememberedby thelocal popula­tion.Wickholm(2008)argues that monuments and speci.c sites evoke memories of historic events. Certainly,remembranceof ancestorsfalls within this description.Attheurn.eld cemetery, no monumentswerefound,butitis possiblethat the site still held some remembrance—mainly relatedtodisposal of the dead—to historic pop­ulationsofthearea,and perhapseven relatedto prehispanic occupants. 
There are other possibilities, however, as to whyinfantswereburiedinthe urn.eld.InAD 1539 Emperor CharlesV,whooversawthe Span­ish colonization of the Americas, declared that members of indigenous groups must be buried in Catholic monasteries or churches if possible (Rodríguez Álvarez 2001). In cases wherethere wasnomonasteryor churchinatownorvicinity, individuals could be buried in a consecrated Catholic space. Unbaptized infants and children, however, wereexcluded andburiedin unconse­crated land.Itis conceivablethatthethreeinfants foundatthe cemeterywere unbaptized.Itisalso possiblethat themournerswere not Catholic and claimedaconnectionwith prehispanictraditions. Unfortunately, current data do not allow us to exclude either of these possibilities. Regardless, itis probablethatthefamilieswhoburied these infants had some connectionwith thelandscape and that this connectionin.uenced their choice of location. Burial locations on the landscape

are generally carefully chosen by mourners and thus become embedded with different memories through time(e.g.,Wickholm 2008). 
Placing these three infants in the cemetery createda linktothe pastprehispanicinhabitants of the hill, or at least to a sacred or important place; CerrodeTrincherasisaveryprominent landmark and occupies a unique space on the local landscape. 


Conclusions 
In this reportweexploretransformationsin use oftheurn.eld cemeteryatCerrodeTrincherasto analyze ideas about remembrance and commem­oration. This was accomplished by evaluating how the space was used though time by local populations. In prehispanic times homogene­ity in funeral treatments of cremated remains and cemetery use suggest commemoration acts imbued with symbolic and signi.cant value. In historical times the space continued to serve for burials and remembrance. Eventually, the cemeterywas abandoned altogether and its com­memorativeand remembrance qualitieswerefor­gotten.Acontextual approach to cemeteries and landscapes is necessary to begin to reconstruct the complexity of practices performed through timeinthiskindof space. Rather than viewing cemeteries as static, it is useful to evaluate the different kinds of activities performed in them andhowthey weretransformed through time.
