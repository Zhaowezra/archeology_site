"LET'S DRINK TOGETHER": EARLY CEREMONIAL USE OF MAIZE 
IN THE TITICACA BASIN 
Amanda L. Logan, Chri stine A. Hastorf, and Deborah M. Pearsall 
Since the Formative times, maiz.e is and has been a highly valued social cornmodity in the Andes, particularly in the form of a traditional beer called chicha. While chicha production is well attested in the archaeology and ethnohistory of Andean states, the emergence of maize symbolism in earlier societies has not been systematically addressed. In this study phytolith and starch grain analyses are used to trace production, processing, and consumption of maize at sites on the Taraco Penin­sula of Bolivia and thus the entrance of maize into the region. We systematically examine the role of maize by addressing its rarity, use contexts, and preparation. The pattern of plant part representation and use suggest that maize was being con­sumed in the form of chicha at its earliest introduction to the Titicaca Basin (800-250 B.C.). Drinking of alcohol in cere­monial spaces embodies the process of commensality of public ceremony and the establishment of reciprocal relationships during the Formative period. These results demonstrate that contextual analysis of microbotanical remains has great poten­tial to answer anthropological questions surrounding food, ritual, and identity.

Aunque la producci6n de chicha esta bien documentada en la arqueologfa y la etnohistoria de las esta­dos andinos, la emergencia de un simbolismo relacionado al ma{z en las sociedades anteriores no ha sido sistematicamente investigada.

El consumo de alcohol en espacios ceremoniales representa el proceso de for­ma/izaci6n de las ceremonias publicas y el estahlecimiento de relaciones sociales recfprocas durante el perfodo Formativo. Estos resultados demuestran que el analisis contextual de los restos microbotdnicos tiene un gran potencial para responder a las interrogantes antropol6gicas acerca de la comida, los ritos y la identidad.

reciprocity, whether in the form of payment for work or in food-sharing feasts. A person's social status is marked by the order in which they are served chicha, and whether they act as giver or receiver. In this way chicha drinking reinforces the standing social hierarchy. Chic ha is also used as an important offering to mountain deities (such as modem day apus) or given to the ancestors (Bolin 1998; Chavez 2006; Cutler and Cardenas 1947; Hastorf2003a; Hastorf and Johannessen 1993; Jen­nings 2005; Jennings and Bowser 2009; Staller 2006; Weismantel 1991). In all cases, both the drinking and offering of chic ha point to shared ide­ologies of what is important in Andean culture. 
Perhaps in part because of the centrahty of maize and chicha to notions of a pan-Andean identity, scholars have devoted considerable energy to track­ing the spread of maize throughout the Andes (e.g., Johannessen and Hastorf 1994; Perry et al. 2006; Pipemo and Pearsall 1998; Raymond and DeBoer 2006; Staller 2006; Tykot et al. 2006). These data suggest that maize was adopted for different rea­sons and at different times across the region, as a subsistence crop (Pearsall 1999, 2002), as a minor vegetable (Chavez and Thompson 2006), and/or for ceremonial uses (Burger and van der Merwe 1990; Hastorf 1999; Staller and Thompson 2002). Lim­ited consumption of maize has been presented as evidence for the presence of chicha (Burger and van der Merwe 1990), but it is only when we see the development of large-scale breweries (e.g., Moore1989; Morris 1979) or widespread brewing operations (Hastorf and Johannessen 1993) that we have conclusive evidence of beer. This means that earlier, small-scale production and consumption events have remained largely invisible (Hayashida 2008; Morris 1979),hampering our ability to under­stand whether or not maize spread throughout the Andes in the form of chicha. 
In this paper, we employ phytolith and starch grain analyses to determine the cultural role of maize at its first introduction to the Titicaca Basin. We evaluate how maize was used and valued by investigating three variables: (1) the rarity or dif­ficulty of procurement, (2) its use contexts, and (3) the ways in which it was prepared.Analysis of four sites on the Taraco Peninsula (Bolivia) demon­strates that maize first appeared in the Titicaca Basin during the Middle Formative (Late Chiripa) period (800-250 B.C.) during a time of growing sociopolitical negotiation. We suggest that the pat­tern of plant part distribution across ceremonial contexts and on artifacts indicates that maize was being consumed in the form of chicha. 
Maize in the Andean Past 
To evaluate the antiquity and symbolic power of maize in the Andes, we must understand how its different uses developed over time. This brief review focuses on the highlands of Peru and Bolivia. In modem Andean highland diets, maize is complemented by tubers, qui noa, legumes, and beans, which are better suited to the constraints of high altitude agriculture. Maize is typically pre­pared through roasting, toasting, boiling, sprouting, and/or fermentation. Toasted kernel s (kancha, 
jampi) can be parched in a clay vessel over a fire until crunchy. Boiling can be accomplished in sev­eral ways: either soaked first with wood ash or cal­cium carbonate to loosen the grain skin (mote), or simply thrown into soups and stews. To prepare chicha, maize is sprouted, dried, ground, boiled, and then strained and fermented (Goette et al. 1994; Hastorf, Bandy, Whitehead et al. 2006; Ramirez et al. 1961). 
In the Andes, the best-known archaeol ogical and ethnohistorical information on maize comes from the Late Horizon Inca (A.O. 1450-1540) (Cobo 1979; Morri s 1979; Murra 1980, 1986; Pizarro 1965[1571]; Poma de Ayala 1987[1615]; Staller 2006). To the Inca, maize was valuable as a storable surplus that could easily be extracted as tribute and mobilized to feed troops and laborers. It could also be transformed readily into chicha, which was an important instrument of political power as payment for services rendered and as liba­tions. Chicha was supplied to laborers as compen­sation for participation in state-sponsored work projects (Bray 2003, 2009; Costin and Earle 1989; Morris 1982). It was also offered as libations after harvest ceremonies, during feasts, and at the end of the life cycle, to ancestors (Cummins 2002; Has­torf and Johannessen 1993; Staller 2006), who dur­ing imperial celebrations were brought out in their finery and offered toasts of chicha (Cobo 1979:218; Cummins 2002; Hastorf and Johannessen 1993; Pizarro 1965[1571]:192; Staller 2006; Valdez 2006:57). So central was chicha to the Incas that it was produced in nearly every Inca town by cho-

sen women (allqas) (Hastorf 1991; Jennings 2005; Morris 1979) and the Inca capital Cuzco was referred to as aqa mama or mother beer (Espinoza 1987 in Valdez et al. 2010:25). To the Inca, then, maize financed the construction of the state in both its physical and spiritual forms. Chicha was also an important focus of pre-Inca polities. Hastorf and Johannessen ( 1993) document an increasing focus on the production and consumption of chic ha from Wanka 1 (early Late Intermediate) to Wanka II (late Late Intermediate). Large-scale production of chic ha is also well attested to in the north coast Late Intermediate Period polity of Chimor (A.D. 900-1470) (Moore 1989). 
Maize played some of the same roles in the Mid­dle Horizon polities of Wari and Tiwanaku (ca. AD. 500-1100).Astudy by Finucane et al. (2006) suggests that maize was important in Wari subsis­tence based on remains from Conchopata, where isotopic analysis suggests that people subsisted pri­marily on maize and/or maize-fed animals. The Wari also consumed and underwrote large-scale production of maize beer, as suggested by the pres­ence of a grinding facility at Marayniyoq close to the Wari capital (Valdez 2006), as well as a ceramic assemblage that includes large "oversized" and kero-like vessels at other Wari sites (Valdez 2006; Valdez et al. 2010). The location of many Wari sites near prime maize production areas is also presented as evidence of the importance of chic ha to the state (Schreiber 1992). Wari beer made of Schinus molle berries was also produced on a large scale (Gold­stein et al. 2009). At Tiwanaku, maize was the sec­ond-most ubiquitous crop, an importance achieved only by acquisition of large quantities through trade, as it cannot be grown in the immediate vicin­ity (Hastorf, Bandy, Whitehead et al. 2006; Wright et al. 2003). Such large-scale importation as well as the contexts of the archaeobotanical finds sug­gests a subsistence function. Like Wari, the pres­ence of liquid holding kero-like vessels and large pots suggests that chicha was probably consumed throughout the highlands at this time, and was inte­gral to the expansion of Tiwanaku identity (Gold­stein 2003). Thus in the Middle Horizon maize appears to have been consumed in both food and alcoholic forms, and produced on a sufficiently large scale to accommodate both purposes. 
Maize is also well attested in the Early Inter­mediate Period Moche (200 B.C.-A.D. 600) record. Special varieties of maize are found as offer­ings in burials (Gumerman 1994). On pottery maize is the most commonly depicted plant, and is often associated with a Moche deity, suggesting its sym­bolic importance (Eubanks 1999). Gero (1990) found evidence of chicha production and use in public feasts at Callej6n de Huaylas during the Early Intermediate period via clusters of ceramic strainers found in plazas (200 B.C.-A.D. 500). From this evidence, it is less clear what role maize played in daily subsistence, but it is apparent that maize was an important part of various rituals, as attested to by its presence in burials, and its asso­ciation with Moche and other Early Intermediate Period polity deities and public feasts. 
Before the Early Intermediate Period, evidence for maize is patchy and its function less clear, par­ticularly in the highland Andes. Based on isotopic studies, there is some suggestion that maize was consumed but did not form a major part of the diet during the Early Horizon at Chavfn de Huantar (850-200 B.C.). These low maize signatures have been interpreted as representing ceremonial con­sumption of chicha (Burger and van der Merwe 1990). A comparative isotopic study by Tykot and colleagues (2006: 193) shows that during the Late Initial Period ( 1000-800 B .C .)/Early Horizon tran­sition, maize formed 25 percent of diet at the high­land site of Pacopampa (bone apatite o 13C= -10 .3), while less was consumed at coastal Carda! in the Lurin valley (bone apatite o13C= -12.8) (Tykot et al. 2006: 194), despite the presence of one cupule and maize leaf phytoliths (large variant 1 crosses) in 7 of 12 soil samples tested from domestic and ritual/ceremonial contexts (Umlauf 1988). Tablada de Lurin, a coastal Early Horizon/Early Interme­diate Period site, shows much higher maize signa­tures (bone apatite o 13C= -5 .7) (Tykot et al. 2006: 192). Based on this selection of sites, it appears that maize consumption in the northern Peruvian Andes and coastal regions was significant starting in the Late Initial Period, and may have increased through time to become a staple, but that there is considerable local variability (Hastorf 1998). However, with little contextualized archaeobotanical data available from the central Andes, it is difficult to evaluate how maize was used, and if it was ceremonial or domestic in nature. The earliest well-accepted claim thus far for maize in the highlands is from a western valley site in

Seeds are often the focus of inquiry because soft plant parts such as underground storage organs and leaves rarely survive in identifiable form (Pearsall 2000). 
In contrast, phytoliths are composed of silica, which is a very durable substance that survives in all but the most basic (i.e., very high pH) environ­ments. Ratherthan being restricted to burning activ­ities, phytoliths can be preserved anywhere a plant part is left to decay (e.g., floors, middens, fields, artifact surfaces). Phytoliths are found across many plant families, but especially the grasses, which often produce diagnostic 1 forms in both leaf and inflorescence material. Starch grains are not pre­served in as many circumstances as phytoliths, but are an important source of data on certain plants and plant parts that otherwise are untraceable. They are found in most seeds and underground storage organs (Pearsall 2000; Pipemo 2005; Reichert 1913). For the purposes of this study, application 
of microfossil techniques is important because charred maize remains are rare to non-existent in Andean Formative period contexts (Bruno 2008; Whitehead l 999b), and it provides the opportunity to trace several different plant parts across a wide variety of contexts, allowing us to address the role of maize in the Formative period Taraco Peninsula (Figure 1). 
Phytolith production in maize has been inten­sively studied in South, Central, and North Amer­ica (see Pearsall 2000:378-392 for a review; e.g., Hart et al. 2003; Mulholland 1992; Pearsall 1978; Pipemo1984 ). Phytolith methods exist for the iden­tification of maize leaf (Pearsall and Pipemo 1990) and inflorescence ( cupule and glume) (Pearsall et al. 2003; Thompson 2006) material. As maize leaf is a byproduct, leaf phytoliths can indicate pro­duction and initial processing (e.g., shucking) of maize. Cupules attach the kernel to the cob and are also a byproduct material, but glumes are often accidentally incorporated into foods, especially in the course of grinding. Pearsall et al. (2004), in a study of residues from stone tools from Real Alto, infer this mechanism from the presence of both maize starch and cob phytoliths on grinding stones. Raviele's (2010:74-79) experimental study of incorporation of starch and phytoliths into cook­ing vessel residues showed only residues made with green com on the cob contained abundant phytoliths. Incidental inclusion of glumes with mature kernels did not produce phytolith-rich residues in these experiments. Diagnostic starch grains are produced in maize kernels (Pipemo and Holst 1998), which are the focus of human con­sumption. Both of these microbotanical remains provide evidence for production, initial processing, 

food preparaltion, and consumption (Hastorf 1988) (Figure 1). Documenting the distribution of these parts in various contexts should allow for the recon­struction of how maize was used and prepared in different parts of a site. 
In addition to plant part representation, micro­fossils can also be used to identify a specific plant across a number of different contexts (e.g., grind­ing stones, ceramic vessels, human teeth, soil sam­ples from ceremonial and domestic areas). This approach allows for detailed consideration of the use of particular plants at several sites and contexts,

erable effort to testing whether or not existing maize phytolith diagnostics could be applied in highland environs, as most have been developed for use in theNeotropical lowlands (i.e., Pearsall andPipemo 1990; Pearsall et al. 2003), which are home to very different plant communities. This is important because there is often considerable overlap among phytoliths produced in the grass family (to which maize also belongs), so other potential contributors to an assemblage in a region must be ruled out to establish the presence of maize definitively. Con­sequently we examined phytolith production in leaf and inflorescence material from every grass fam­ily genus that occurs today above 3,000 m asl. in the Andes (36 genera, 52 species), and compared those phytolith forms to those produced in seven different varieties of Andean maize (Logan 2006). 
Our results indicate that the Andean maize vari­eties tested do not produce the diagnostic large and extra-large cross-shaped phytoliths found in the leaves of lowland maize varieties as described in Pearsall and Pipemo (1990). Perry et al. (2006) also found this to be the case. While not all Andean maize varieties have been studied, these results suggest that the cross-body method may not be an effective way of identifying maize in highland envi­ronments. Andean maize leaves have a character­istic panicoid phytolith assemblage (i.e., abundant bilobates and related forms). 

Maize cupules and glumes produce considerable quantities of rondel (round to oval or square) bot­tomed short cells, forms that characterize grasses belonging to the Pooideae, the grass subfamily that dominates in the Andean altiplano. In our com­parative grass study, we found considerable over­lap between rondel types produced in maize cobs and those produced in Pooideae grasses of the area, indicating that methods that rely on rondel forms for identification (e.g., Chavez and Thompson 2006; Thompson 2006) need to take wild grasses into account explicitly. Charred wild grass seeds are recovered from Andean highland sites (e.g., Bruno 2008; Hastorf 1993; Lee 1997; Pearsall 1989), and any artifact that is exposed to sediments comes into contact with phytoliths deposited by wild grasses. Based on our exhaustive study of highland grasses, we found two phytolith forms that are unique (produced only) in maize glumes and cupules: the ruffle top rondel (Bozarth 1993; Pearsall et al. 2003; Pipemo and Pearsall 1993), and a new diagnostic form, the narrow elongate rondel (Figure 3) (Logan 2006; and see Bozarth 1996:401). Maize starch was positively identified on TAP artifacts based on previously published identification criteria (Pearsall et al. 2004; Pipemo and Holst 1998; Reichert 1913). 
The Study Region 

Based on this method, we set out to evaluate the role of maize on the Taraco Peninsula as a means to address the timing of its introduction into the Lake Titicaca region and its role in subsistence and ceremony. The Titicaca basin is an especially inter­esting focus, as at 3 ,800 m asl, it lies above the zone of successful maize cultivation, yet maize was an important staple of Tiwanaku (Hastorf, Bandy, Whitehead et al. 2006; Wright et al. 2003). We focused on the period immediately preceding the rise of the Tiwanaku state, when we see the devel­opment of multi-community polities on the nearby Taraco Peninsula and throughout the basin during

the Middle and Late Formative periods (1500 B .C.-A.D. 500) (Bandy 2004, 2006; Hastorf2008; Hastorf, ed. l 999; Janusek 2007; Kolata 1993; Kolata, ed, 1996, 2003; Stanish 2003). 
The beginning of the Formative period in the Titicaca basin ushers in the first settlements along with small ceremonial centers and the emergence of territoriality and domesticated crops. By the Middle Fonnative period (800-250 B .C.), clusters of settlements with civic-ceremonial architecture that included a sunken court and raised platform mound emerge in at least eight different regions around the lake (Hastorf 2008). A form of nested kin-based allyus may have been developing at this time and it is postulated that the consolidation of 
these groups may have formed the foundations of the laterTiwanaku state (Albarracin-Jordan 1996). As part of this consolidation, certain styles of fer­tility imagery along with ritual paraphenilia-like ceramic trumpets and burners and temples with sunken courts appear, a complex oftraits designated the "Yaya-Mama Religious Tradition" (Chavez 1988) or Pa'Ajano (Portugal Ortfz 1981). Along with these stylistic elements there is an increasing focus on communication with far-flung groups, materialized in the form of exotic goods like beads, copper, salt, stone, and warm valley plants (Has­torf 2008; Janusek 2008), perhaps including maize (below). The development of long-distance trade may have played a critical role in facilitating inter-

action and development of economic surplus (Browman I 978b). Ceremonialism seems to have escalated first in the southern part of the basin at sites like Chiripa, but by the Late Fornrntive these activities intensify at sites like Pukara in the north­ern part of the basin. In the first half of the Late Formative (250 B.C.-A.D. 375) people accumu­lated into multi-community ceremonial centers, whose stylistic influence spread and developed into elaborate ceremonial performances with ritual para­phernalia and imagery. One manifestation of this process is increasing investment in ceremonial architecture as illustrated at Pukara where stepped platforms with multiple sunken enclosures are con­structed (Chavez 1988; Klarich 2004). Imagery shifts to scenes of power over bodies, such as dis­articulated human heads, bodies, and weapons­beliefs that also appear in the form of human remains in courts (Chavez 2002; Hastorf 2008; Janusek 2008). This evidence suggests increasing status differentiation and elaboration of ritual that may be designed to accumulate power through dead enemies (Arnold and Hastorf 2008; Chavez 2002). By the latter half of the Late Formative (A.D. 300-475) political authority based upon earlier reli­gious traditions and kin-based ancestor worship solidifies, particularly at Tiwanaku (Hastorf 2008). 
Was maize adopted as part of the changes sweeping across the basin in the Formative period, or was it a later development associated with Tiwanaku? Previous studies suggest that maize was extremely scarce in the south central Andes during the Formative (Bruno 2008; Whitehead l 999b). A single kernel and cupule was recovered from the Copacabana Peninsula (Lee 1997), and recent phy­tolith data from the same sites suggest the presence of maize in residues on four ceramic sherds from ceremonial contexts dating to 2750 ± 40 B.P. and later (Chavez and Thompson 2006:425). However, maize has been noticeably lacking in macrobotan­ical samples from the well-sampled site of Middle Formative Chiripa (Whitehead l 999b), and has been found in only very small quantities in the Late Formative contexts at Kala Uyuni (Bruno 2008). It is not until the emergence of the Tiwanaku state 
(A.D. 475-1100) that maize becomes an important part of subsistence and economy (Hastorf, Bandy, Whitehead et al. 2006; Wright et al. 2003). In fact, archaeobotanical analysis at Tiwanaku and related sites suggests that maize is the second-most com­mon identified taxon, occurring in 25 percent of the samples (Wright et al. 2003). Based on a study of maize varieties recovered at Tiwanaku, this maize was probably imported from low-lying regions, including Cochabamba and Moquegua (Hastorf, Bandy, Whitehead et al. 2006). While some isolated microzones along lake edges permit cultivation of small-cobbed maize today, it was probably never viable on a major scale, and such crops cannot be grown at all in the inland Tiwanaku Valley (Hastorf, Bandy, Whitehead et al. 2006; Wright et al. 2003). Instead, it appears that domes­ticated quinoa and tubers, which are adapted to and probably domesticated in the altiplano region, were probably the focus of prehistoric agriculturalists (Browman 1986; Bruno 2008; Bruno and White­head 2003; Wright et al. 2003). 
To evaluate the role of maize in Formative soci­ety more fully, we employed phytolith and starch grain analyses on soil samples and artifacts from four sites on the Taraco Peninsula. Research at sites on the Taraco Peninsula has been conducted by the Taraco Archaeological Project (TAP) directed by Christine Hastorf and Matthew Bandy since 1992. The Taraco Peninsula is a narrow stretch of land that juts into Lake Wifiaymarka, the southern arm of Lake Titicaca, which lies about 20 km northwest of Tiwanaku (Figure 4). The first phase of the pro­ject focused on the excavation of Chiripa (1992-1999) (Hastorf, ed. 1999), which had been excavated previously by others (e.g., Bennett 1936; Browman 1978a; Kidder 1956). 
A full-coverage survey of the peninsula was completed by Bandy in 2000 (Bandy 2001, 2004). In this survey he identified other important sites of the Formative period and established the existence of dense populations in a circumscribed area he referred to as the "Taraco Peninsula Polity." Bandy's survey suggests that important shifts in set­tlement patterns were occurring on the Taraco Peninsula during the Formative period (Bandy 2004). In the Early and Middle Chiripa (Early For­mative) periods, villages fissioned once they reached a population threshold of about 150 peo­ple. By the Middle Formative period, villages con­tinued to grow as fissioning ceased. About the same time, there is evidence for the emergence of the "Yaya-Mama Religious Tradition" (Pa'Ajano) (Bandy 2004; Chavez 1988; Hastorf et al. 2005). Bandy (2004) hypothesizes that the Yaya-Mama

Religious Tradition, with its emphasis on public ceremonialism, served a socially integrative func­tion. By Late Formative (Tiwanaku 1) times the pat­tern changed as many villages suffered major population losses. One settlement, Kala Uyuni, grew significantly, perhaps signifying that it was politically dominant over the peninsula during this time (Bandy et al. 2004; Hastorf et al. 2005). The second phase of TAP's research focused on defin­ing this Late Formative polity and these settlement shifts through excavation of three village sites near the tip of the peninsula: Kala Uyuni,, Sonaji, and KumiKipa (Tables 3 and4). We discuss these sites and the results of phytolith and starch grain analy­
ses at each below. 
Archaeological Results 
To date, a total of 27 artifacts, 18 charred ceramic residues, and 20 soil samples have been examined from this region, from the sites of Chiripa, Kala Uyuni, Kumi Kipa, and Sonaji. Table 3 lists the results in detail by type of sample analyzed (soil, artifact residues, charred pot residues) and site. Here we provide background information on the sites examined and discuss our results from each. 
Chiripa 
Chiripa is known as one of the earliest village cen­ters in the Titicaca Basin due mostly to the archae­ological research history. Its primary Formative architecture is a stepped platform mound with 14 distinct double walled structures around a central sunken court. Hastorf's (ed. 1999) team has inves­tigated outlying structures that date to the Middle Formative (Early through Late Chiripa) periods (1500-200 B.C.). Phytolith and starch samples reported here come from two off-mound locations at Chiripa. One is the sunken enclosure Quispe, a Middle Formative (Late Chiripa) structure with stone architecture interpreted as a ceremonial enclosure (Paz Soria 1999; Roddick 2002). Also studied were charred residues from pot sherds from Santiago, an enclosed civic area dating to the Mid­dle Chiripa period (1000-800 B.C.) (Dean and 
Kojan 1999).
