Mates:CorpusIconográficoPerúPrehispánicoputsfor-wardaveryrarelyinvokedartformthatwaswidespreadintheancientAndes. Gourds (alsoreferred to as mates)are among the oldest domesticated plants in the ancientAmericas, and, as dried containers, they have the dis-tinctionofbearingsomeofPeru soldestknowncompleximagery the incised line and pyroengraved gourd jarsdiscovered at Huaca Prieta, dated by Junius Bird toroughly 1950 B.C., are a famous case in point.
Theprimarystrengthofthepublication,andpresum-ably its main point, is the presentation of an enormouscohort of images. In its sheer volume of examples, theworkisimpressive.Theauthorhasattemptedadetailedsampling of engraved gourds primarily representingcoastal cultures; the production of such a large numberofillustrationsrepresentsaconsiderableamountofeffort.Asagroup, the images do not dwellonanthropologicalor art historical concerns, but, rather, they highlight theplayfulness and variety of prehispanic Andean gourdmotifsacrosstimeanddistance.Variousphotographsoftruly exceptional pieces bear mention, among the mosthighlyunusual,aParacasgourdembellishedwithpoly-chrome resin paint, very much like the distinctive elite waresmadeofceramic.Thissmallvesseldepictsarangeof characters perfectly attuned to Paracas iconography.
The introductory essay by Jeffrey Quilter comple-mentsthematerialandraisesimportantquestionsaboutthe ubiquity of carved gourd containers, as well as thestatus associated with them. It is often suggested thathighly refined pictorial motifs are one of the signaturesof elite arts. In many of the traditions reflected in thisbook, Moche, Nasca, and Inca, for example, complexiconographyisgenerallyfoundincombinationwithmoreprecious materials or fine and delicate workmanship.Gourds, in contrast, are considered to have beenabsolutelypedestrian,amongthemostcommonofmate-rials, and, yet, many of the incised and pyroengravedgourdsdepictedherereflectknowledgeofsophisticatedmotifs. This fact suggests not only that complex motifswere in common circulation, but that they were notstrictly limited to elite contexts.
Several aspects of the publication inhibit deeperresearch, making the work problematic as a referencetool. The text is brief and the author includes very littlecritical analysis. More extensive research on ethnohis-toric sources would have been welcome for example,thebriefmentionthatnorthcoastwomenplantedgourdseedsatthetimeofthefullmoon,apparentlybecauseofa conceptual parity between the fullness of the moon,femalefertility, andthe roundfullness of ripe gourds, isintriguing but unexplored. Readers are left to wonderaboutthesourceoftheinformationanditsimplications.Likewise, the text wouldbenefit fromgreater contextu-alization of the gourd motifs themselves. The centralplacement of approximately 420 consecutive pages ofdrawingsofengravedgourdmotifsessentializesculturaldifferences,giventhatthesegourdmotifsrepresentmorethan a dozen different culture groups, across a span of3,500 years. Such a large cohort of images needs moreconspicuous differentiation between groups.

Thebooksstatedmission istopulltogetherintoasingle,coherentaccountthebasicmethodsofregionalsettlementdemography, beginning at square one (p. v). Drennanandhiscolleaguesnotonlyhavesucceededbrilliantlyinthis task, but have accomplished a great deal more. Thebook represents a spirited defense of the possibility ofreconstructing regional settlement demography and acompelling argument for the central importance ofdemographytofundamentalarchaeologicalquestions.Itisatestament tothepowerof archaeological surveyanda demonstration of what well-designed research canaccomplish with the surface archaeological record.
The brief initial chapter, Regional SettlementDemography:WhyBother?, presentsashorthistoryofregional demography, centered on the seminal work ofWilliam Sanders, Jeffrey Parsons, and their colleaguesintheBasinofMexico.Then,asthechaptertitlesuggests,it argues convincingly for the centrality explicitly or implicitly ofregionaldemographytoabroadrangeofarchaeological questions and the need to tackle demo-graphic reconstruction, despite the difficulties and theinevitable imprecision of the results. Drennan et al.rightly note that, while there is no single right way todo demographic reconstructions, there nonetheless arebad or even wrong ways to go about it.

nanandhiscoauthorsemphasizethosethatcombineareaand artifact density.
Startinginthischapter,thebook sclearverbalargu-ments are enhanced through the use of well-chosen andwell-illustrated examples drawn from both archaeolog-ical cases and modern data. Several of these examplesare followed, to good effect, through the methods dis-cussedinsubsequentchapters.Examplesaredrawnfromdiverse New and OldWorld archaeological contexts, inmany cases from the authors work. Drennan, Berrey,and Peterson do not shy away from dealing with uncer-tainty and the less than ideal circumstances thatarchae-ologiststypicallyface.Whilenotingthattheirdiscussionand comparisons are often presented as contingent on
other things being equal, they face, head-on, the factthatotherthingsarenotoftenequalandoffersuggestionsfor coping with that reality.
