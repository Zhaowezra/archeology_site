AN AZTEC PALACE AT CHICONAUTLA, MEXICO 
Christina M. Elson 
The results of George Vaillant's 1935 excavation at the Postclassic site of Chiconautla are presented. Vaillant suggested that the structure he excavated, Casas Reales, was the palace of an elite family. My analysis of the architecture and associated arti­facts supports his proposition. The Postclassic (A.D. 1150-1520) artifacts from the palace provide evidence that the elites at Casas Reale.1· engaged in household rituals, obsidian working, and cotton-cloth production. This analysis contributes to a bet­ter understandinf? of elite behavior in the Basin of Mexico and enables us to evaluate the degree of fit between archaeological and ethnohistoric data. 
Se presentan los resultados de la excavacidn hecha en 1935 por George Vaillant en el sitio Postcldsico de Chiconautla, Mexico. 
Vail/ant propuso que el edificio que habfa excavado, Casas Rea/es, era un palacio de una familia de elite y mi andlisis de la arqui­tectura y los elementos culturales apoya SU propuesta. Durante la epoca Postcldsica ( d.C. 1150-1520), las elites de Casas Reales participaron en actividades rituales y ceremoniales y invirtieron su tiempo en la produccidn de obsidiana y tela de algoddn. El tecpan provee datos hacia un mayor entendimiento def comportamiento de las elites en la Cuenca de Mexico y sirve como una evaluaci'5n arqueoldf?ica de fuentes etnohistdricas. 

ost of what we know about the Aztecs is Mfrom the rich sixteenth-century documen­tary record. In the Basin of Mexico, we know that there were 50 to 60 polities, each called an altepetl. James Lockhart ( 1992: 14 ), based on his analysis of Nahua documents, defines these as "an organization of people holding sway over a territory," led (usually) by a hereditary ruler or tlatoani (pl. tla­toque) or "one who issues proclamations and com­mands" (Karttunen 1983:226). These altepetlformed between A.O. I 100--1350 (Hodge 1991:113). How­ever, by the mid 1400s the Triple Alliance (composed of Tenochtitlan, Texcoco, and Tlacopan) had estab­lished firm control over the altepetl that composed most of the Basin of Mexico, thereby undermining the autonomy of local tlatoque in favor of the over­arching leadership of huehuetlatoque at Triple Alliance capitals. We know a lot about elite behavior and the economy from the documents, but have much less information from excavations. Notable excep­tions are Michael Smith's projects at Yautepec and Cuexcomate (de Vega Nova 1996; Smith 1992, 1993, 1997; Smith and Berdan 1992; Smith et al. 1999) and Evans' project at Cihuatecpan (Evans 1988, 1991 ). These new excavation data from palaces and elite residences are of vital importance in understanding altepetl economic organization. 
My objective is to contribute new data on elite architecture to develop a better understanding of activities associated with elite residences. Such an objective can be addressed by examining the exca­vations conducted by George Vaillant in 1935 at Chiconautla, a polity located on the eastern edge of Lake Texcoco (Figure 1). Vaillant was a pioneer in Mesoamerican archaeology (see Willey and Sabloff 1980). His early excavations at the Formative sites of Zacatenco (Vaillant 1930), Ticoman (Vaillant 1931 ), and El Arbolillo (Vaillant l935a) were pub­lished, but his later work at the Postclassic sites of Chiconautla, Los Melones, and Nonoalco were never fully analyzed or published. Rapid urban expansion in the Basin of Mexico has destroyed many archae­ological sites and Vaillant's collections continue to be a valuable source of data from excavation. 
Chiconautla was part of the Acolhua domain and politically under the Triple Alliance capital of Tex­coco. Vaillant's excavation yielded the remains of an Aztec palace (tecpan in Nahuatl), a set of rooms around a large interior courtyard. The palace can be compared with ethnohistoric data on palaces (cf. Anonymous Conqueror 1917; Berdan and Anawalt 1992; Ixtlilx6chitl 1975/1 977;Mapa Quinatzin 1920; Sahagun 1950) and with recently excavated Aztec elite structures. Information from the Chiconautla

hart, the minimum requirements for an altepetl were a set ofnamed and ranked parts (called calpolli), each with its own god and temple, and a tlatoani. Each calpolli had a leader (the teuctlato) whose position was not always hereditary. The tlatoani was the leader of the highest-ranking calpolli and ruler of the altepetl. His palace or tecpan was the center for tax collecting, the focus for calpolli rotation labor, and the gathering point for other nobles from the altepetl. The core res­idential area of the leading calpolli was the location of the tlatoani-controlled market, and the location of the temple of the calpolli god who often served a dual role as the most important god of the altepetl. Michael Smith ( 1996: 189-191 ; Figure 8.1) provides us with archaeological plans of the ceremonial core of four Aztec urban centers that illustrate the close relation­ship between the Temple-Pyramid and the Palace of the Tlatoani. Lockhart argues that the trend towards nucleation of some of these constituent parts was mis­taken by the Spaniards for urbanization, but a "dom­inant central city was not really compatible with the principles of altepetl organization." The Spaniards mistook the constituent parts for the barrios of a pueblo, viewing them as a cabecera with sujetos.Mary Hodge (1997:210-220) does document a trend towards the concentration of decision-making and other polity functions at major urban centers and the appearance of a more rigidly hierarchical political and economic structure with the expansion and consoli­dation of political power by the Triple Alliance in the Late Aztec period. In fact, in the Relaciones geogr<i­ficas, Chiconautla was said to be comprised of four distinct barrios. Vaillant excavated at the ruins known locally as Casas Reales, which he believed was the barrio of Calpulpan Yacanqui, translated in the Rela­ciones geogrqficas (Acuna 1985:230) as "caserfa 
principaI'' or "noble residence." Vaillant identifies the earliest occupation as dat­ing at least to the Mazapan or Early Postclassic period 
(A.D. 950-1 150). By the Early Aztec or Middle Postclassic period (A.D. 1150--1350), Chiconautla was one of several large villages in the area (Sanders et al. 1979), but it is unclear how many, if any, other villages were under its control. Ethnohistoric docu­ments record that during Netzahualcoyotl's reorga­nization of the Acolhua state between 1430--1434, Chiconautla's ruling dynasty maintained their posi­tion thereafter through blood relations or marriage to the Texcocan rulers (Gibson 1964:43; Hodge 1991:134-135; lxtlilx6chitl 197511977:2:89-90). 
Interestingly, the gloss on the depiction of Mote­cuhzoma's palace in the Codex Mendoza (Berdan and Anawalt 1992:3:f69r) lists Chiconautla as one of the three polities called "friends ofMotecuhzoma." The precise meaning of this gloss is not clear but one suggestion is that Chiconautla had ties of blood or marriage with Tenochtitlan (Berdan and Anawalt 1992:2:222). While a 1519 relaci6n for Chiconautla states that Ecatepec, Xaltocan, and Tecama fell under its jurisdiction, the preconquest polity probably included only one or two dependencies (Hodge I 996:Table 2-8), and its territory (and agricultural base) could not have been very extensive. Chico­nautla itself was a tributary ofTexcoco, and its oblig­ations to the Triple Alliance capital included the provision of labor and building material to the cap­ital for six months each year (Ixtlilx6chitl 
1975/1977:2:89-90). 
Much of Chiconautla's importance was due to its geographical location (Blanton 1996; Santley 1986; Smith 1979). Positioned at the eastern edge of Lake Texcoco and the mouth of the Teotihuacan Valley, Chiconautla was important as an embarkation point (Blanton and Hodge 1996; Gibson 1964:361; Linne 1948; Sanders 1965:81-82). Water-borne traffic would have passed between Tenochtitlan and Chico­nautla and then overland through the Teotihuacan Valley and on to the Gulf Coast-an important source of many exotic goods including cotton, cacao, and feathers. Local elites may have benefited from increased trade and economic stabilization. As with much of the rest of the north and northeastern part of the Acolhua domain, economic specialization by the Late Aztec period would have focused on lake products such as salt, fishing, duck hunting, and xero­phytic plants such as maguey (Gibson 1964:318, 340--342). 
Excavation at the Palace of Chiconautla 
Now a suburb of modem Mexico City, Chiconautla was first visited by Vaillant in October 1934. The ruins were located east of the modem town and west of the Colonial road to Veracruz. Vaillant noted an area with substantial mounds and concentrations of Postclassic material. Unfortunately, Vaillant did not leave a map that showed the location of Casas Real es within Chiconautla. Mounds south of the Colonial road had modem occupation and were badly dam­aged; he did not dig there. Vaillant excavated for six weeks in February and March 1935. The collection,

stored at the American Museum of Natural History in New York, contains a substantial amount of mate­rial as well as field notes, drawings, photographs, and a manuscript prepared by Vaillant. As noted before, his collection was never fully published. 1 In The Aztecs of Mexico (1962(1941]), Vaillant presented a partial plan of the Chiconautla structure he exca­vated, and linked the ceramic data to ethnohistoric descriptions of middens that were created by the cyclically occurring celebration of the Aztec New Fire ceremony (every 52 years). Vaillant stated that Casas Reales was the palace of a noble, but his analy­sis did not attempt to interpret Chiconautla within the context of the expanding Aztec empire. Never­theless Chiconautla did attain a prominent position both politically as an altepetl and economically as a point along the trade route connecting the Aztec heartland with the Gulf Coast (Blanton 1996; Sant­ley 1986; Smith 1979). 
The material excavated at Chiconautla ranges in time from the Classic to Postclassic to Colonial peri­ods, the majority falling in the Postclassic period. Using Vaillant's notes and the American Museum of Natural History catalogs, I was able to identify 184 excavated proveniences. Most were from the struc­tures Vaillant dug, and their location relative to one another could be determined from his field map. Vaillant's manuscript described the architectural ele­ments (such as hearths and storage units) and con­struction materials. 
During his excavations and analysis in Mexico, Vaillant created lists of sherd counts from each of the original provenience units for types such as Black on Orange, Black on Red, utilitarian, and others; however, he brought back to New York only a rep­resentative sample of the ceramics. Using Vaillant's field tabulations for the Black on Orange ceramics, I assigned the structures to either the Early or Late Aztec period. It should be noted that in Vaillant's day, the archaeological consensus was that Aztec I and Aztec II ceramics followed each other in time (see, for example, Griffin and Espejo 1947, 1950). Vail­lant dated Aztec I to A.D. 1247-1299, Aztec II to 
A.D. 1351-1403, Aztec III to A.D. 1403-1455, and Aztec IV to A.D. 1455-1507. Vaillant based this sequence on his work and Alfonso Caso' s work cor­relating the Christian and Aztec calendars (Caso 1939; Vaillant 1962(1941]). During the 1980s, researchers showed that Aztec I and II were coeval types, rather than chronologically different ones (Whalen and Parsons 1982:437-438). Analysis of Black on Orange motifs clearly supports their con­temporaneity (Hodge 1993; Hodge and Mine 1990; Mine et al. 1994 ). Some of the most recent chrono­logical work on Postclassic ceramics suggests that the beginning of Aztec I may date to the ninth or tenth century A.D., predating Aztec II in some parts of the valley (Parsons et al. 1996:227). Therefore, although Vaillant referred to Black on Orange "phases," Black on Orange I-IV are actually "types." Vaillant deter­mined that the earliest houses he uncovered were 
2
built on a fill of Aztec II Black on Orange sherds.In this study, I use the date of A.D. 1350 as the divid­ing line (Smith and Hodge 1994:7) to separate the Early Aztec (with Black on Orange I/II pottery) from Late Aztec (with Black on Orange III/IV pottery). This division allows us to compare early and late phases of construction and renovation of the Chico­nautla tecpan and activities associated with the Early and Late Aztec periods. 
The other artifacts addressed in this study-spin­dle whorls, figurines, and obsidian (it should be noted that there is no obsidian debitage smaller than approximately 2 cm in the collection)-are assumed to be the total number Vaillant recovered because he brought even small fragments of these objects to New York. Spindle whorls and figurines were recorded with exact provenience information. Obsid­ian bifaces, lip plugs, ear spools, and eccentrics from the Aztec-period structure also were recorded with exact provenience information, but flakes, blades, cores, and debitage were not. In a database, I recorded artifacts for each provenience unit. Because of Vail­lant's method of excavation-he started with large trenches to define the outermost walls of the struc­tures and, as he worked inward and down, created smaller, more precise provenience units-many excavation units do not correspond well with par­ticular architectural units. Thus, some material ( espe­cially the obsidian) can only be treated as an excavated collection; however, it was possible to identify a series of provenience units inside the walls and above the floors of certain rooms or patios. By correlating the material from units associated with these structures, I could determine some of the activ­ities associated with the Early and Late Aztec peri­ods. Vaillant's (1935b) architectural analysis (presented in greater detail below) clearly states that houses were built and razed as wholes rather than added to (or destroyed) a room at a time, and the

ceramic material from provenience units associated with each structural unit demonstrates contempo­raneity. The five houses I discuss in this paper are the West, Early East, North, South, and Late East Houses. Next, the architectural history of the site is described. This is a first step in understanding the site within the context of the Basin of Mexico's polit­ical economy. 
Architecture 
Vaillant's description of the architecture is essential in determining function. This summary draws mainly on his unpublished manuscript. Vai\lant determined that there was a definable relationship, both chrono­logical and spatial, between the structural units he excavated. He proposed that they were part of a palace modified over time to fit the changing needs of its inhabitants (Figures 2, 3, and 4 ). The sequence of construction at Casas Reales shows some time depth. The earliest platforms contain Black on Orange sherds identified as Aztec II, dating the ini­tial period of construction to the Early Aztec period 
(A.O. 1150-1 350). In addition, Black on Orange sherds from the fill in the West and Early East Houses are mainly Aztec II, placing these houses within the Early Aztec period. In contrast, the fill from the North, South, and Late East Houses is composed mainly of Aztec III sherds, dating their occupation to the Late Aztec period (A.O. 1350-1520).

According to Vaillant, the Early Aztec West House was incorporated into a platform, the Early East House was tom down and rebuilt as the Late East House, and the South House was converted into a massive platform. The very last phase of construc­tion included rebuilding the North and East Houses. Vaillant encountered these final construction stages in a very eroded state and could discern only part of the final plan. Vaillant defined two kinds of structures. 
Platfomis. In general, buildings were placed on top of platforms. Large platforms had an interior consisting of honeycomb walls of stone or adobe filled in with earth. On top of this was a packed earth and crushed stone subfloor. Exterior platform walls were built of roughly dressed tepetate or "lava" boul­ders, and comers had dressed stone slabs. Most exte­rior platform walls and floors were plastered.

Buildings.Walls had stone foundations upon which adobe bricks were laid. They were plastered both inside and out. Many rooms contained internal pillars made of solid stone cobbles or stone rings (into which wooden beams could have been inserted). The floors of rooms were either plastered or made from a brownish, hard­packed (2-6 cm thick) lime and sand mixture. 
Chronology of the Tecpan 
Here I present the chronology of construction for Casas Reales. Each structural unit is discussed sep­arately and salient architectural features indicated. This discussion helps identify the structure as an elite residential palace or tecpan. By comparing the frequency of Black on Orange ceramics (Table 1 ), it appears that the heaviest occupation of Casas Reales was in the Late Aztec period (after A.D. 1350). Taken in conjunction with Vaillant's architectural analysis, the West and Early East Houses can be dated to the Early Aztec period. The North and South Houses date to the Late Aztec. The Late East House also dates to the Late Aztec period, indicating that it does not overlap with the West House (or the Early East House, which it replaced). 
West Sector. The western area was an elevated platform accessed by a south stair. The interior of the platform yielded Aztec II Black on Orange ceramics. Two houses were placed on the western edge of the platform; between these western struc­tures and the North House, Vaillant found no sign of

construction and suggested it was an open patio. The West House, one of the earliest, was reached by an east stair. Vaillant (1935b:9) believes this may have been a house, because there is evidence for a hearth against the west wall of Room 1. However, later in the sequence, the West House was converted into an open platform, "ceremonial in purpose for in the zone around the northwest comer ... there was an abundance of charcoal, obsidian blades, and sahu­madores [incense burners], as well as fragments of big tiles, which like crenellations adorned the tops of temples. Many elongated cones of stone and baked clay were found in this sector." Vaillant recovered three elongated cones, the ends covered in plaster projecting from an unspecified stone-faced platform wall. 
East Patio Group. The North and Early East/Late East Houses were built facing an open, sunken plas­tered patio. Beneath the earliest level of the patio floor, Vaillant uncovered Aztec II Black on Orange sherds as part of the refuse that had been used to level a natural grade sloping from west to east. 
Vaillant suggested that the North House was con­structed as two separate units. Rooms 1, 2, 3, 5, and 11 were constructed first. Access to these rooms was through the two rooms on the north end of the patio. 

Figure 6: Possible sweatbath or temazcalli in northwest corner of Room 2, North. Vaillant suggests Room 2 was an open patio (photo by George Vaillant). 
This set of rooms was well preserved and yielded several interesting features (Figure 5a). In the north­west comer of Room 2 was a shallow circular con­struction of plastered cobbles (Figure 6). A review of the literature discussing circular constructions in Mesoamerica (Finsten et al. 1996) and some possi­ble archaeological examples (Evans 1988, 1991; Smith 1992) leads me to suggest that this construc­tion was a sweatbath or temazcalli like Evans' (1988:34-35) structures in Rooms A and Kat Cihua­tecpan. Due to light and ventilation requirements, Vaillant suspected this room was an open patio. Against the west wall of Room 1, Vaill ant uncovered a complete square-shaped hearth or tlacuilli (Figure 7) lined with stone slabs projecting through the floor. Inside the hearth was sandy fill covered by stone slabs and a bed of fine white ash (Vaillant was informed by his workmen it was maguey ash). Vaillant found another tlacuilli against the east wall of Room 5. In the northwest comer of Room 11 was a bee­hive-shaped storage structure-possibly cuexcomatl or stor­age structure-con­structed of rings of straw liberally coated with mud. 
The second seg­ment of the North House consisted of Rooms 6, 10, 7, and 9, which opened directly onto the east patio (and were con­nected to Rooms 1,

2, 3, and 5 through Room 11 ). The plan of Rooms 6, 7, 9, and 10 is similar to that of the Early East and Late East Houses: an outer room (open on one side) and an enclosed back room with a hearth. In the Early Aztec Early East House, the enclosed Rooms 4 and 6, which have hearths, open up to Rooms 3 and 5 in a plan similar to Rooms 6 and 7 North. Sub­sequently, the Early East House was razed and the Late East House was built (the floors of this house rested on 40 cm of fill). In addition, the level of the east patio was raised and the patio extended south­ward. The outer room of the more ambitious Late East House was an open terrace. Rooms 6, 7, and 8 were supported by columns and had hearths along the eastern wall. Both Rooms 7 and 8 had small rooms attached to them, perhaps storage rooms (a small step led up to Room 9 East). In front of Room 8, Vaillant found a small "altar" that was used even after the Late East House was leveled and rebuilt, leading him to suggest important ceremonial rites might have been conducted there. 
East of Room 8 Late East and south of Room 7 and 9 North was an elevated platform that Vaillant named the Central Platform. He encountered this plat­form in a very eroded state, but hypothesized that it might have held a set of rooms like that of the Early East House. He dated it to the Late Aztec period. 
South Patio Group. The South House, similar in design to the east patio group, was built around a sunken patio named 3 South (Figure Sb). Room I 0, open on the south side, was reached by a short flight of steps. Rooms 9 and 14 also were completely open (making it less likely they served as storerooms), but Room 13 (like Room 9 East) may have served this purpose. Both Rooms 12 and 5 had hearths against the east wall. Sometime during the Late Aztec period, the entire house was destroyed, filled in with large 
3
sherds and ash, and covered with a large platform that extended north to join the constructions of the east patio group. 
Let us now look at the dimensions of the Chico­nautla tecpan. The Early Aztec structure (excluding the enormous West Platform but including the Open 
2
and Sunken Patios) has 663.75 m	of floor space. 
Excluding patio spaces, the total covered room area 2
is 518.25 m. In the Early Aztec tecpan, rooms, including corridors (such as Room 3 North) and stor­age spaces (such as Room 13 South), average 17.87 
2
m • The Late Aztec tecpan (excluding the massive 
South and West Platforms but including the patios) 2
has 631.50 mof floor space. Excluding patios, the 
total covered room area (including storage spaces and 2
corridors) averages 21.2 m(Table 2). 
Casas Reales was the only elite residence exca­vated at Chiconautla. However, Vaillant's claim that Casas Real es was a tecpan can be evaluated by com­paring the structure with other Postclassic elite res­idences. Before conducting this comparative analysis, it is important to evaluate evidence regard­ing activities conducted by the palace's residents.

activities, which include cloth production, house­hold ritual, and obsidian working. 
Besides the usual range of utilitarian ceramics, many houses contained a high frequency of Texcoco Fabric Marked ceramics commonly thought to have been used as containers for transporting salt (Table 1). A recent publication by J. Parsons (1994:280) sheds new light on the uses of salt in prehispanic Mexico. Besides its importance as a dietary condi­ment, different kinds of salt could be used to pre­serve animal flesh, as a medium of exchange, and as a component in soaps and cleaning agents. The form of salt called tequesquite has been described in ethno­graphic and ethnohistoric sources as a mordant for textile dyes (Gibson 1964:339; Johnson 1989). Sanders et al. ( 1979: 172) note that the lakeshore between Chiconautla and Ixtapan had a high density of Texcoco Fabric Marked pottery. At Casas Reales, I believe that salt was consumed as part of the diet and used as a mordant in textile production. 
Cloth Production. M. Parsons (1972a) andJ. Par­sons and M. Parsons (1990:330-332) suggest that spindle whorls can be divided into three categories based on whorl diameter, hole diameter, and weight, which relate to the type of material spun. Of the 224 
excavated whorls available for study, 182 
weigh under I I g, 8 weigh between I I and 
4
30 g, and 34 weigh over 30 g.Their stud­ies suggest that whorls under 11 g are most suitable for cotton spinning; whorls weigh­ing between 11 and 30 g fall into the "opti­mal range" for producing fine maguey fiber; and whorls over 30 g are most suit­able for producing coarse maguey fibers (Figure 8). Given our current understand­ing of the uses and value of cotton cloth in the Postclassic, in an elite residence such as Casas Reales, I would expect cotton­cloth production to be more important than the production of coarse maguey fiber (Anawalt 1990; Dfaz 1977; Hicks 1994). And, in fact, there are more whorls under I I g than over 11 g. Based on excavated proveniences, the frequency of cotton whorls increases over time (Table 3). Unfortunately, the eight whorls that fall into the 11 to 30 g category do not occur in units clearly associated with houses, making it difficult to date them. Two whorls in this category are typologically "Huastec" whorls, which could indicate ties to the Gulf Coast lowlands (Ekholm 1944:464). Twelve whorls over 30 g cor­respond to M. Parsons' ( l 972a, 1975) Type I whorl, stylistically representative of the Teotihuacan Valley. 
Household Ritual. I classified the figurines (Table 4) into the same types distinguished by M. Parsons ( l 972b ). At Chiconautla, the vast majority of fig­urines are Aztec-period Type II solid figurines or Type I hollow rattle figurines representing female deities, or containing elements of female deities such as Coatlicue (associated with spring), Cihuacoatl (invoked in childbirth), and Xochiquetzal (patroness of love, flowers, and embroidery) (Figure 9). 
Solid temple models are the second most frequent type of clay figure. There is a heavy concentration of material in the South House, but the uniform dis-

tribution of figurines throughout Casas Reales indi­cates these figurines played a role in household rit­ual. The house is the sphere of female-dominated activities such as childbearing, child rearing, and spinning. But the presence of temple models, war­rior figurines, and representations of Xipe might indi­cate other rituals were conducted, and these were not related to activities in the female domestic sphere. 
Obsidian Working. Obsidian from Casas Reales was analyzed following Clark's (1986:Figure 17) Mesoamerican blade reduction sequence that identi­fies tool types. I made a second division (Table 5) based on color-gray versus green. Bifaces are knives, scrapers, or other large tools retouched by per­cussion around one or both edges; they can result from an early phase of blade core preparation. Blades extracted from a core through percussion are part of the final shaping of the core before the removal of long, thin prismatic blades through pressure. One large unworked gray obsidian core was found in direct association with Room 9 Late East. Exhausted green cores at Chiconautla result from blade manufacture. They often are smashed bipolarly or show abrasion ridges. More than 43 prismatic blades were inten­tionally retouched (perhaps after initial use) to have

serrated edges. William Parry (personal communi­cation 1995) has pointed out that such implements have the right shape and size for shaping wooden dowels that could have been used in spinning. 
Gray obsidian accounts for less than 20 percent of the Casas Reales obsidian, and almost all occurs as large percussion blades, bifaces, and flakes. Green and gray pressure blades account for over 60 percent of the assemblage, with green blades preferred over gray by a ratio of36: I. Five examples of green bifaces from the collection have at least X to X cortex on the dorsal side. The presence or absence of cortex indi­cates what type of raw material is being used as the basis for manufacture at a particular site (Clark 1986). William Parry (personal communication 1995) has identified a large flake with cortex as a good example of a "platform preparation flake." The presence of cortex and a "platform preparation flake" suggests that the residents of Chiconautla were not importing finished green blades, but rather mini­mally prepared cores from which they were manu­facturing several types of implements. In addition, much of the green obsidian has been reworked in dis­tinctive ways. Blade cores show abrasion ridges and/or bipolar smashing to extract rejuvenation flakes. Several bifaces were smashed to extract flakes. Blades (both pressure and percussion) appear to have been reworked into serrated blades, points, eccentrics, and lip plugs. Therefore, it is reasonable to propose that all the green obsidian implements in the collection, excluding perhaps the button-shaped lip plug and ear spool, could have been manufactured as by-products of prismatic blade manufacture. Green obsidian was imported from the Pachuca source; the best known, but not the only, source of gray obsidian was Otumba, located at the opposite end of the Teotihuacan Valley from Chiconautla. The residents demonstrate a marked preference for green obsidian, which they rejuvenated in several ways.

Two different kinds of labrets appear. One type conforms to the button-shaped lip plugs known to have been produced in Otumba (Figure lOc) (Otis Charlton 1994). Brumfiel et al. (1 994:124) have argued that the second type was worn by the Otomi. The Chiconautla collection contains one example of a finished Otomf-style plug (Figure lOb) and one example of a partially finished plug (Figure lOa). Brumfiel et al. suggest that the use of these plugs may have declined over time as Otomi ethnic groups were incorporated into the Late Postclassic empire and sought a closer affiliation with the ruling Mexica elite. 
Polity and Economy in Postclassic Chiconautla 
Using the data from Chiconautla, I can address the function of the structure Vaillant excavated, deter­mine the range of activities carried out there by its residents, and suggest how social and economic changes taking place during the Aztec period are reflected at Chiconautla. During the course of the Postclassic in the Basin of Mexico, there was a tran­sition from small, independent city-states to greater political and economic integration under the leader­ship of the Triple Alliance. By the Late Aztec period, some altepetl "achieved much greater political power, population size, and wealth than others" (Hodge 1997:226). 
I agree with Vaillant's hypothesis that Casas Reales is the palace of a noble family. Could it be the house of the tlatoani of the altepetl? The Flo­rentine Codex (Sahagun 1950:270-271) tells us that the ruler's house (referred to in the document as a tecpancalli) would have been both his residence and an important civic-ceremonial center. The tecpan is described as "well-made ... good, fine ... a product of skill" and a structure that would have included "ser­vants' halls, [rooms] pertaining to women, [rooms]

pertaining to men ... an audience room." An example of this kind of house can be seen in drawings of the royal palace of Texcoco (lxtlilx6chitl 1975/1977; Mapa Quinatzin 1920) and the palace of Motecuh­zoma (Berdan and Anawalt l 992:3:f69r) and has been further elaborated upon in descriptions of a tec­pan (Anonymous Conqueror 1917). These docu­ments inform us that the layout of a tee pan consisted of open elevated rooms around a large, interior court­yard and often had a C-shaped layout. 
Susan Evans' review of these and other ethno­historic documents allowed her to deduce the archi­tectural manifestations that could be expected from a tecpan. High-quality construction, including cut stone and stucco, and the inclusion of decorative disc motifs painted on plaster or constructed from plas­ter-covered pumice stones might distinguish a tec­pan from an ordinary residence (Evans 1991 :71-74; cf. Berdan and Anawalt 1992:3:f69r; 2:222-225). The inclusion of large open patio spaces would per­mit the gathering of people, and the incorporation of features such as a sweatbath would reflect the impor­tance of the tecpan as a community center. Features such as hearths would identify the structure as domestic, while multiple residential rooms could identify it as a noble residence. Aztec elite were polygamous, and each wife and her children may have had separate living rooms providing multipur­pose areas for storage, cooking, sleeping, and activ­ities such as spinning (Evans 1991:77; cf. Carrasco 1964, 1971, 1972, 1976). 
We can compare Casas Reales with other exca­vated elite and commoner residences at Cuexcomate, Yautepec, and Cihuatecpan. Cuexcomate's Group 6 and Yautepec's Structure 6 were elite residences placed on platforms; they display a greater quantity of dressed stonework and lime-plastered walls and floors than other types of residences. The mean area

Casas Reales: Otomi and button-shaped. The two Otomi 
labrets at left include one unfinished (a) and one finished

area of the Yautepec structure is 425 m2• Some urban commoner houses at Yautepec do have plaster floors and are built on low platforms but their average floor

space is only about 77 m(Smith 1992: 187; Smith 
et al. I 998:Table 2). The average floor space of com­2
moner houses at Cihuatecpan is only about 88 m-less than that of Casas Reales' central sunken patio (Smith et al. l 999:Table 2; cf. Evans 1993). Signif­

icantly, the size of Casas Reales (between 443.50 m2
and 518.25 m) is well within the range of elite res­
idences, and the C-shaped layout is further support 
for identifying it as an elite residence. The quality of 
the construction; the inclusion of a sweatbath, stor­
age spaces, and plaster covered-pumice stones; and 
the evidence from the West Platform for ceremonial 
activities suggest Casas Reales was the residence of 
an important noble family. 
What kinds of domestic activities are associated 
with the tecpan? The figurines indicate that a range 
of domestic rituals took place within the tecpan and 
there is evidence that the large West Platform was 
used for important ceremonial activities, perhaps 
involving many community members. We also have 
evidence for change over time in household craft 
production based on the importation of nonlocal 
goods. 
Mary Hodge ( 1992) suggested that, with the advent of the Triple Alliance and political stabiliza­' tion within the Basin of Mexico, the Aztec built upon 
and expanded existing market systems, which led to 
intensified exchange between polities and steady 
access to nonlocal goods. This hypothesis is sup­
ported by changes in the spatial distribution of Aztec 
ceramics between the Early and Late Aztec periods, 
which suggest that the Late Postclassic market sys­
tems did provide greater access to a wide range of 
nonlocal staple and exotic goods (Hodge 1993; Hodge and Mine 1990). Chiconautla's elite were in a good position to exploit increased trade and exchange opportunities by capitalizing on their posi­tion on a trade route connecting the Aztec heartland with the Teotihuacan Valley and the Gulf Coast. 
By the late 1400s, the ruler Ahuitzotl had extended the empire considerably. During his reign and increasingly until the arrival of the Spaniards, the acquisition of elite valuables, centralized patronage, gift giving, and more ostentatious displays of wealth were emphasized as elites became enmeshed in a sys­tem of competitive wealth display (Brumfiel 1987 a). Part of the competition between elites would have stemmed from a desire to capture marketing territo­ries, since tributary flows would not have been ade­quate to fund political activities. Elites able to attract specialists and fund the production of elite goods would be better able to participate in competitive con­sumption, wealth display, and gift exchange (Blan­ton 1996:83). 
Do we have any evidence for the intensification of production of elite goods at Chiconautla? Obsid­ian production, not just the importation of finished products, certainly took place at Casas Reales. Unfor­tunately, Vaillant's excavation does not provide the data to address changes in obsidian working over time, but it is possible to address changes in cloth production over time. 
Before Aztec domination of low land areas and the importation of spinning technology, cotton cloth was imported to highland Mexico as a finished product and elite valuable (Hicks 1994 ). However, by the Late Postclassic, ethnohistoric documents show cotton was imported as fibers and spun into cloth by both noble and commoner households (Diaz 1977:275-276; Hicks 1994:43,95). Archaeological evidence supports the idea that both nobles and com­moners in Late Postclassic communities such as Huexotla and Otumba were spinning cotton (Brum­fiel 1980, l 987b; Charlton et al. 1991). But we must note that commoners and nobles perceived cotton cloth differently. By the mid-fifteenth century, com-

moners were not allowed to wear fine cotton man­tles (Duran 1967); furthermore, the color, decoration, and style of garments took on added importance in expressing position within the social hierarchy (Anawalt 1990). By the Late Postclassic, probably under pressure from elites, cotton-cloth production became part of the domestic economy of common­ers but was not worn by them. Rather, it was used to fulfill tributary payments and as a medium of exchange. In elite households, both noble and ser­vant women were involved in coi:ton-cloth produc­tion, some of which was used internally but much of which was used to fulfill gift-giving and tribute expectations to othernobles (Hodge 1991: 126-127). The importance of cotton cloth as an elite valuable is clearly illustrated in accounts such as Diaz's (1977), where conquistadores were often presented not only with gold but also with finely made cloth. 
Casas Reales provides good evidence for the spin­ning and weaving of cloth and a marked preference for cotton spinning over maguey spinning-a pref­erence that increased over time. Locally produced salt could have been used as a mordant agent in dye­ing the textiles. The elite women of Casas Reales as well as their servants would have participated in cot­ton-cloth production that was used to fulfill tribute obligations, and to construct and maintain social rela­tionships with elites at sites like Texcoco and Tenochtitlan. 
Conclusion 
My analysis of Chiconautla is based on the structure Vaillant excavated and the associated spindle whorls, obsidian, and Fabric Marked and Black on Orange ceramics. The structure Vaillant excavated, Casas Reales, underwent remodeling from Early to Late Aztec times. Based on its size, layout, and quality of construction, it is best interpreted as a noble residence or tecpan. Activities associated with the tecpan include obsidian working, cloth production, and both public and domestic ceremonial activities. Compet­ing elite families would have had an interest in con­centrating important activities such as religious ceremonies, local politics, and markets around their tecpan. Cotton-cloth production is the one activity associated with the tecpan for which we have data indicating temporal changes in production. With the expansion of trade and exchange routes in the Late Aztec period, Chiconautla's nobles were able to cap­italize on their location, which was situated on an important trade and exchange route linking the coastal lowlands with the core of the empire, and they evidently intensified their production of cotton cloth.

Notes 
1. 
Some artifacts of the Chiconautla collection have been stud­ied. See J. Parsons (1966) on ceramics; Tolstoy (l 97 l) on obsid­ian and stone; and Kaplan (1958) and M. Parsons (1972b) on figurines. 

2. 
Parsons et al. (1996) also suggest a partial overlap of Aztec I and II and Mazapan (AD. 950-1150) ceramics in the eleventh and twelfth centuries. Vaillant believed that at Chiconautla, the Mazapan occupation was spatially separated from the Aztec part of the site represented by Casas Reales. In his unpublished man­uscript (Vaillant 1935b:3) he states "Mazapan ceramics were unmixed with any strong Teotihuacan elements and the [few] Aztec [II] elements found associated may be the result of later

dumping on the site." Although the area suffered from extensive plowing, Vaillant believed the area contained an Early Postclassic midden. He was unable to identify any structures associated with this period. 
3. In fact, Vaillant (1962[ 1941 ]:200) suggests that the destruc­tion and renovation of the South House was the result of a set of ceremonies occurring every 52 years with the conjunction of the ritual and solar calendars. As part of the festivities celebrating the rebirth of the world, "cyclical dumps" were created. There is a dense concentration of material in the South House. For exam­ple, 88 whorls were found inside the South House compared with only 18 from other houses. This pattern also is evident with the figurines. Note the overall quantity of ceramics from this location (Table 2). A preliminary comparative analysis of the 
North and South Houses using multidimensional scaling (Schiffman et al. 1991) and cluster analysis (SYSTAT 1994) found that they contain roughly the same range of materials (Elson 1996), implying the difference is quantitative, not quali­
tative. 
4. When researching my MA thesis, only 210 whorls were avail­able for study. Recent curatorial work on the Mesoamerican col­lection has located 12 additional whorls from Chiconautla which raised the total number analyzed for this work to 224.
