1.0 EDITORIAL POLICY 
American Antiquity is a quarterly journal that publishes original papers on the archaeology of the New World and on archaeological method, theory, and practice worldwide. Because the Society for American Archaeology supports another journal dedicated specifically to the archaeology of Latin America (see below), American Antiquity publishes papers on Latin American archaeology only if they address broad methodological, theoretical, or comparative issues that extend beyond Latin America. Authors submit manuscripts to the editor for consideration as ARTICLES, REPORTS, COMMENTS, or FORUM essays. REVIEWS, BOOK NOTES, and OBITUARIES are solicited by the respective associate editors; volunteered manuscripts for these sections are rarely accepted. Contributors should contact the associate editors of the respective sections, as listed in the most recent issue, for further information. Contributions for CURRENT RESEARCH are submitted yearly to the assistant editor for the appropriate region by the dates listed at the beginning of the CURRENT RESEARCH section.

prehistory, and ethnohistory of Latin America-Mesoamerica, Central America, and South America­together with culturally affiliated adjacent regions. The journal publishes contributions in method and theory, field research, and analysis that use a Latin American data base. REVIEWS and BOOK NOTES are solicited by the associate editor for that section. Except where circumstances dictate otherwise, submissions should be in English or Spanish. 
The categorization of a manuscript as an ARTICLE or a REPORT in either journal is left to the editors' discretion. ARTICLES are usually longer than REPORTS and address topics of major importance in a way that reaches out to a broad audience of professional archaeologists and the informed public. REPORTS, on the other hand, may be more technical, address a specific topic, and be of primary interest to a relatively narrow audience. COMMENTS correct major errors of fact or provide new information directly relevant to a paper published previously in the journal. COMMENTS do not address differences of interpretation or opinion. Those whose work is being commented upon are given the opportunity to reply to the specific points raised in the COMMENT, and the COMMENT and accompanying reply are usually published together, at which time the exchange ends. A FORUM contribution is an essay of opinion on current issues or topics of immediate significance to a broad audience. 
The editors reserve the right to reject (with or without peer review), or return for revision, any material submitted on the grounds of inappropriate subject matter for the scope of the journals, or on the grounds of poor quality or of excessive length. Manuscripts may also be returned for refor­matting when they do not comply with the journals' style provisions. 
Both journals adhere to the 1973 American Anthropological Association statement on gender language, which discourages the employment of male third-person pronouns and the use of generic "man" in reference to non-sex-specific semantic categories. More comprehensive terms (e.g., "one," "person," "people," "humans," "humankind," "they") are to be used, in gramatically correct con­structions, as a matter of equity. 
Before a manuscript can be published in either journal, the author must submit written permission from anyon whose unpublished works (e.g., manuscripts on file, papers presented at meetings, personal communications, in-press items) are cited or used in the paper in question. For multiauth­ored papers, the communicating author must submit written evidence that all coauthors are willing to release for publication the draft accepted by the journal editor. 
Neither journal will knowingly publish manuscripts that rely on archaeological, ethnographic, or 
historical-period objects that have been obtained without systematic descriptions of their context; 
that have been recovered in such a manner as to cause the unscientific destruction of sites or 
monuments; or that have been exported in violation of the national laws of their country of origin. 
Neither journal pays authors for manuscripts, nor does it provide manuscript retyping, copying, 
preparation of illustrations, abstracting, translations, or other such services, which are the respon­
sibility of the author. 
2.0 INFORMATION FOR AUTHORS 
2.1 Editors ' Responsibilities 
Manuscripts are evaluated by the editor in consultation with peer referees, or by the associate editors for Obituaries and History of Archaeology, Current Research, and Reviews and Book Notes, as appropriate. Authors may suggest potential reviewers; the editors, however, are not bound by these suggestions. Referees' substantive evaluations are solicited with editorial guarantees of ano­nymity. Referees may, however, waive anonymity. Editors have responsibility for all final decisions regarding manuscripts. The evaluation process generally takes a minimum of two to four months. Authors are notified as soon as a decision is reached to accept or reject a manuscript. Acceptance may be offered on the condition that revisions be undertaken. Rejection may be outright or with the possibility of reconsideration after revision, which may entail a new round of evaluations. 

2.2 Authors' Responsibilities 
Authors, and not the Society for American Archaeology, are responsible for the content of their

papers, for the accuracy of quotations and their correct attribution, for the legal right to publish any material submitted and the appropriate handling of issues of coauthorship, and for submitting their manuscripts in proper form for publication. Authors bear the responsibility for securing written permission, when necessary, for figures, tabular materials, or any other material protected by U.S. or international copyright laws. As noted above in section 1.0, the author must submit written permission from anyone whose unpublished works are cited or used. All permission letters must accompany a submission. Attribution for figures, etc., should be given with the manuscript, pref­erably in the caption for each figure. A manuscript submitted to either journal must not be under consideration by any other journal or publication medium at the same time, or have been published elsewhere. After a manuscript has been accepted, and before it is published, the author or authors (in cases where papers are coauthored or jointly authored) will be asked to sign copyright-release forms, which must be received before actual publication takes place. 

2.3 Submissions 
Manuscripts for the ARTICLES, REPORTS, COMMENTS, or FORUM sections should be sent to the appropriate editorial office at the address given on the inside front cover of the most recent issue of the journal. They should be well packaged and be sent via a reliable method to ensure safe arrival. Original artwork should be placed between two pieces of heavy cardboard for maximum protection. For American Antiquity, submit an original and four copies of the manuscript; for Latin American Antiquity, submit an original and three copies of the manuscript. The original should be accompanied by original artwork, and each of the copies should include xeroxes of all of the figures at the end of the paper, with figure number noted. The author should retain a copy of the manuscript. Do not submit a manuscript in diskette format. Acknowledgment of manuscripts upon receipt does not imply their acceptance. 
Publications for review should be sent-normally by the publisher-to the appropriate Associate Editor for REVIEWS AND BOOK NOTES (for either American Antiquity or Latin American Antiquity), and information for CURRENT RESEARCH to the appropriate American Antiquity assistant editor for a particular region. Addresses for associate editors appear on the inside front cover of the most recent issue of each journal. Assistant editors for CURRENT RESEARCH are listed at the head of that section. 

2.4 Page Proofs 
Page proofs for ARTICLE$, REPORTS, COMMENTS, OBITUARIES, and FORUM contri­butions are sent to the senior author of a manuscript or to the senior author's designee, who checks them for typographical errors. No text may be rewritten at this stage, but editorial errors may be corrected, and significant new data or an absolutely essential correction sometimes may be added. All changes and additions by an author are suggestions only; they may be disregarded at the discretion of the editors. Corrected page proofs should be read and returned to the managing editor within 48 hours of receipt by authors, preferably via express mail or Federal Express. Later returns may be too late to be considered. Revised proofs with corrections shown are not sent to authors. Copies of CURRENT RESEARCH sections are sent to the assistant editors by the managing editor; these also should be returned immediately with corrections noted. 

2.5 Reprints 
Copies of the journal and reprints are not distributed to authors free of charge. Reprint order forms are mailed directly to the senior author or designee (see above) along with the authors' copies of the page proofs and are handled by Allen Press, Inc. If reprints are desired, the form should be completed immediately and returned to Allen Press. Payment in U.S. currency must accompany the reprint order form. 
3.0 STYLE GUIDE 
The specifications given here codify current style guidelines for both American Antiquity and Latin American Antiquity, and supersede all previous style guides. Authors are, therefore, urged to consult this guide carefully; additional details can be found in the references listed in section 3.11, 
Downloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core. YBP Library Services, on 22 Aug 2018 at 18:43:17, subject to the Cambridge Core terms of use, available at https://www.cambridge.org/core/terms. https://doi.org/10.1017/S1045663500012074 

below. In cases of conflict between this style guide and other sources, the instructions given here are to be followed. 
Stylistic considerations for manuscripts prepared in Spanish are essentially the same as those presented here, with substitution of Spanish terms for those used in English, e.g., "Figura" for "Figure," "editado por" for "edited by," "Tabla" for "Table," "REFERENCIAS CITADAS" for "REFERENCES CITED," etc. 
3.1 Preparing the Manuscript 
Print the manuscript on one side only of 8.5-x-11-inch good-quality paper, preferably on a laser printer. Double space all sections of the manuscript, including abstracts, block quotes in the text, Acknowledgments, References Cited, Notes, figure captions, tables, and table titles. Margins at top, bottom, and sides should be about 1.5 inches (3.7 cm). Use only 10 or 12 pitch type, do not hyphenate words at the ends of lines (i.e., turn off word wrap), and do not right justify the text. Any word processor can be used for initial submission, but if a manuscript is accepted and a diskette containing the paper is requested, DOS-compatible formats (WordPerfect 5.1 or lower, or WordStar 
4.0 or lower) are preferred. 

3.2 Sections of the Manuscript 
Each of the following sections of the manuscript should be on a separate page or should start a new page. Arrange the parts of the manuscript in the following order (see below for more information on each section): 
Title page (separate page, number as page 1) 
English abstract (separate page) 
Spanish abstract (separate page; in reverse order if paper is written in Spanish) 
Text (begin new page) 
Acknowledgments (should immediately follow end of text) 
Appendix or appendixes (begin new page; used in rare cases only) 
References Cited (begin new page) 
Notes (begin new page) 
Figure captions (new page, captions listed sequentially, not paginated) 
Figures 
Tables (separate page for each) 

Pages are numbered consecutively through notes, only. Examples for form of title and abstract pages are given here. 
3.2.1 Title page.

3.2.2 Abstract. 
An abstract in English and in Spanish (see below) must accompany all articles (including historical pieces such as autobiographies and biographies, but not obituaries), reports, comments, and forum contributions. The abstract should not exceed 200 words in length, although it is usually preferable that the "second" abstract (i.e., the one written in the language in which the paper is not written) be a somewhat expanded version. 
Given the many places that journal contributions are indexed and abstracted, as well as the fact that most readers judge whether to read an article from the abstract, the abstract may well be the most important part of the paper. It should be a factual summary of the contents and conclusions of the paper, refer to new information that is being presented, and indicate its relevance. The abstract should not be an introduction to the paper or an outline of it with each section being reduced into a sentence. Avoid the use of passive voice. See section 3.11 for more information. 


3.3 Textual Elements 
3.3.1 Headings. 
Primary heads should be typed in all capital letters and centered, with two lines of space above and below. Do not use "INTRODUCTION" or "ABSTRACT" as headings. Secondary heads should be typed flush left, using initial capital letters on "significant" words (excluding articles, prepositions, and conjunctions less than five letters long), and underlined (will be set in italics), with space above and below. Tertiary heads should be typed as part of the paragraph, that is, with a paragraph indentation, the head underlined, capital letters on significant words, followed by a period, followed by the beginning of the text of the paragraph. Example: "Acknowledgments. Fieldwork since 1986 has been supported by National Science Foundation grant ... " 

Note that REFERENCES CITED and NOTES are primary-level headings. 

3.3.2 Numbers. 
When cardinal numbers are used, all numbers above nine should be expressed with Arabic numerals (except as noted below); spell out numbers zero through nine. On a paragraph-by-paragraph basis, when the majority of numbers is above nine, the numbers zero through nine are often expressed numerically as well. Use commas to indicate places in Arabic numerals: e.g., 5,000; 10,000; 240,000; 1,000,000. Exceptions to these general rules are as follows: 
1. 
Spell out any number that begins a sentence. Examples: Twelve of the vessels (or can be rephrased as "A total of 12 vessels was analyzed ... ") or "Five hundred years ago ... " 

2. 
Spell out numbers that are used in a general sense in the text. Example: "Several hundred sherds were recovered ... " 


Ordinal numbers are always spelled out in text. Examples: "During the seventh cycle," "In the eighteenth century," "In the fiftieth percentile." In the References Cited section, use ordinal numbers to indicate at which annual meeting a paper was presented. Example: "Paper presented at the 54th Annual Meeting of the Society for American Archaeology ... " 
Dates should be expressed as follows: 250 years; on October 3, 1952 (but see subsection 3.9.12 on citation of newspapers); in the nineteenth century (not 19th); during the 1970s (not 1970's); 1921-1925 (not 1921-5 or 1921-25). (See subsection 3.3.5 on the expression of radiometric dates.) 
Official site numbers should be included with site names whenever possible. Smithsonian Tri­nomial System (STS) site numbers are preferred (e.g., 23SG5); do not use hyphens between com­ponents of the trinomial and use only capital letters for the county designation. Where the STS is not employed use the accepted numbering system for that region. 

3.3.3 Metric measurements. 
All measurements of distance, area, volume, and weight should be expressed in the metric system unless reporting an older excavation conducted in the English system, in which case the English 
Downloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core. YBP Library Services, on 22 Aug 2018 at 18:43:17, subject to the Cambridge Core terms of use, available at https://www.cambridge.org/core/terms. https://doi.org/10.1017/S1045663500012074 
equivalent should follow the metric, in parentheses. Thus, centimeters, meters, kilometers, liters, grams, and hectares are used, not inches, feet, gallons, acres, miles. The metric units are abbreviated without periods; liters, however, is not abbreviated to avoid confusion with the Arabic numeral "1." Examples: 18 cm, 3 m, 12 km, 28 ha, 6 m2, 2 liters. Leave a space between the number and the abbreviation. All measurements should be expressed with Arabic numerals and abbreviated except when they are used nonspecifically, appear at the beginning of a sentence, or as noted above. Examples: "Several cubic meters of fill," "Three kilometers from the site." A metric conversion table can be found in Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary. 

3.3.4 Mathematical and statistical copy. 
Mathematical copy is difficult and expensive to set into type and should be used judiciously. For displayed equations, allow ample space above and below the equation (setting it off from the text) and between elements of the equation or formula (around equal signs, for example). All letters that represent mathematical variables should be underlined (to be italicized). All symbols that might be ambiguous or confusing to the editorial staff should be noted in the left-hand margin and identified by the name of the symbol. Example: For "x," indicate whether a lower-case Greek chi, a multi­plication sign, or a variable is intended. For "B," indicate whether a capitalized Bee or a Greek Beta is meant. 
Statistical expressions should be typed as follows: 
F = 13.67; df = l, 24; p < .05 
Never use leading zeros (e.g., 0.05) in text, figures, or tables. 

3.3.5 Radiometric ages and dates. 
In all instances (ARTICLES, REPORTS, COMMENTS, CURRENT RESEARCH, etc.) where radiocarbon dates are reported for the first time the following conventions must be employed. However, if the date was first published elsewhere, it is only necessary to cite that reference (with page number[s]). 
The uncalibrated radiocarbon age must be given in the first direct citation. Uncalibrated radio­carbon ages must (1) be based on the 5,568-year half-life of 14C (divide radiocarbon ages based on the 5,730-year half-life by 1.03); (2) be expressed as years B.P.-do not convert to radiocarbon years A.D./B.C.; (3) be followed by the 1-sigma (lo) standard error as given by the laboratory; (4) include the sample identification number given by the laboratory (use conventions established for laboratory abbreviations used in the journal Radiocarbon); (5) state what material was dated (e.g., wood cliarcoal, com cob, bone apatite); and (6) state whether the date has been corrected for isotopic fractionation. If a o13C value was given by the laboratory, then this correction has been made. The best way to indicate this is to provide the o13C value. Example: 3680 ± 60 B.P. (Pta-3964; wood charcoal; o13C = -23.8%0). 
Calibrated dates must always be identified as such, using the conventions cal A.D. or cal B.C. 
(note the placement of cal and the punctuation). Authors must identify the particular calibration 
used, must state whether the calibration is made for 1 sigma or 2 sigma (2 sigma preferred), and 
present the calibrated age as a range of calendar age (or ranges where more than one is possible). If 
there is more than one possible range of calendar age, and the calibration program assigns proba­
bilities to each, these must be cited. Example: For the date 3680 ± 60 B.P. the two possible calibrated 
age ranges are 2279-2232 cal B.C. (p = .05) and 2209-1905 cal B.C. (p = .95). (Calibrated at 2 
sigma with the program CALIB 2.0 [Stuiver and Reimer 1986].) If many calibrated dates are included 
in a manuscript, then presentation in the form of a table is advised (see, for example, Table 1 in 
Andrews and Hammond, American Antiquity 55:570-584). 
The Spanish equivalents for these conventions are illustrated in the following examples (note 
carefully the placement of the letters in relation to the numbers): for 3000 B.P., use 3000 A.P.; for 
500 cal B.C., use 500 cal A.C.; and for cal A.D. 1200 use 1200 cal D.C. 
The atomic weight of an isotope is indicated as a superscript preceding the atomic symbol-thus 
1•c, not C-14 or C1•.

266 

3.3.6 Quotations. 
Quoted matter of less than eight typed lines in length should be run into the text, between (double) quotation marks. Use single quotation marks only when it is necessary to have quotation marks within a quotation. After the quotation, cite author, year of publication, and page number(s) in parentheses. Example: Mental life, as such, cannot be grasped, but we can grasp the intention through the intentional product, "the objective and identical correlate in which mental life surpasses itself' (Ricoeur 1981 :50). 
Quoted matter that runs to eight or more typed lines should be set off from the text as a block quote and double spaced, with two lines of space above and below. Example: 
Most of the area is true savannah, the most difficult vegetation for the primitive farmer to cope with, and also the rains in general are undependable .... The only incentive for heavy settlement would be on the basis of irrigation agriculture, and ... [at Zempoala] this incentive was presented [Sanders 1953:76]. 
Note: Brackets are used instead of parentheses within the excerpt for author-added material and for the citation. When emphasis is added or was already in the original material, the source of the emphasis should be noted after the citation, within the brackets. Example: [Sanders 1953:76; em­phasis added] or [Sanders 1953:76; emphasis in original]. When a translation of material is made, it should follow the quotation, with translator noted. Example: [translation by Rowe ( 1980: 15)] 'or [translation by the author]. Refer to the The Chicago Manual of Style, 13th ed., Chapter 10, for more information on quotations and for the correct use of ellipsis points. 

3.3.7 Spelling. 
The authority for spelling in both journals is Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary. For anything not in the New Collegiate, consult Webster's Third New International Dictionary (una­bridged). Use American English spellings only (except in quotations and references and in referring to an institution when it is imperative to preserve the original spelling). When more than one spelling is offered for a word, use the first spelling listed, e.g., labeled, not labelled; archaeology, not archeology; artifact, not artefact; acknowledgments not acknowledgements. Preferred spellings for some words commonly used in archaeological parlance include: fieldwork, rockshelter, ear spool, posthole, post mold, plow zone, use life, ball court, ground stone, pithouse, pit structure, room block, field house, X-ray (noun), x-ray (verb), cross section (noun), cross-section (verb). Spell out percent, except in tables, where % should be used. 
The primary Spanish dictionary used by bothjournals is the Vox New College Spanish and English Dictionary, which contains many more of the words used in archaeological writing than do the other commonly available Spanish-English dictionaries. It also features special sections on Spanish grammatical conventions (e.g., capitalization, numerals, syntax). For authors writing in Spanish, the authoritative work is the latest edition of Diccionario de la Real Academia Espanola. 

3.3.8 Italics. 
Words in languages other than the primary language in which the manuscript is written are italicized (underlined in manuscript). Use standard orthographies, including diacritical marks, and explain unusual symbols (also see subsection 3.3.12 on accents, below). Generic, specific, and varietal names are italicized: e.g., Homo sapiens sapiens, Spondylus sp. All other taxonomic designations are printed in Roman type. Titles of books, journals, poems, and other literary works are italicized when mentioned in the text; article titles mentioned in the text are in roman type, set offby quotation marks. Letters that represent mathematical variables are italicized (see subsection 3.3.4, above). Foreign words and phrases in common use, or anglicized, should not be italicized. Consult Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary: Any word or phrase that appears in the main section of the dictionary should not be italicized (e.g., in situ, a priori, et al., vis-a-vis, milpa); any word that appears at the end of the dictionary in the section on "Foreign Words and Phrases" should be italicized (e.g., anno mundi, caveat lector).

3.3.9 Capitalization. 
For capitalization of nonarchaeological terms, consult the Chicago Manual, Chapter 7. Capitalize the names of specific archaeological and geographical areas. Examples: Mesoamerica, Lowland Maya, Gulf Coast, the Southwest, the Midwest. Directional, topographical, and general geographic terms are in lower case unless they are derived from proper names of political, ethnic, or taxonomic entities. Examples: mesoamerican, southwestern, north coast of Peru, central Mexico; but Maya Lowlands, Sonoran Desert, Eastern Woodlands. 
Capitalize taxonomic names of generic and higher rank. Examples: order Artiodactyla, family Bovidae, genus Bison, Pinus ponderosa. Names of mountains, rivers, oceans, and so forth are capitalized, along with the generic terms-such as lake, mountain, river, valley-when used as part of a name. When a generic term is used descriptively rather than as part of the name, when used alone, or when plural, it is lowercased. Examples: the Mississippi River, the valley of the Mississippi, the Mississippi River valley, the Mississippi and Missouri rivers, but Lakes Michigan and Huron. 
Capitalize proper names, including Lower, Middle, Early, and Late when they are part of the name, of chronological, cultural, and geological divisions, but give taxonomic division names and restrictive modifiers in lower case. Examples: Upper Paleolithic period, late Holocene, Classic period, Koster site, Anasazi culture, Upper Republican aspect, Olmec horizon, Riverton phase, Denali complex. Capitalize the names of archaeological classes, but place generic terms in lower case. Examples: Clovis point, Cody knives, Hardin Barbed point, Salado polychromes (which include types Gila Polychrome, Tonto Polychrome, etc.). 

3.3.10 Hyphenation. 
For rules governing hyphenation of nonarchaeological compound words, consult Table 6.1 in the Chicago Manual, or Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary. Compounds are spelled without hyphens if they can be considered permanent combinations. Examples: rockshelter, preceramic, Postclassic, Precolumbian, Prehispanic, Paleoindian, Preconquest; but pre-Basketmaker, mid-Pleis­tocene, etc. Prefixes in common use are not hyphenated. Examples: noncultural, reanalyze, infra­structure, intercommunity, intrasite. Hyphenate descriptive terms that are combinations of words including a preposition. Examples: red-on-buff pottery, 1-x-1-m unit. Hyphenate fractions when they are spelled out. Examples: one-third, seven-tenths. A general rule is to hyphenate paired words serving an adjectival function (termed compound modifiers). Examples: obsidian-hydration dating, heat-treated silicates, two-story pueblo, 5-m depth but depth of 5 m. Never hyphenate a combination of an adverb ending in -ly plus a participle or adjective, e.g., highly developed species. 

3.3.11 Abbreviations. 
Abbreviations are used infrequently in the journals. Exceptions (especially in CURRENT RE­SEARCH) include acronyms for long titles of agencies, institutions, etc., which will be mentioned frequently in the text (they are always introduced following the full name). Examples: Bureau of Land Management (BLM), Instituto Nacional de Antropologia e Historia (INAH). Metric units are given in abbreviated form when they follow numbers. Examples: 7 km, 2,000 m asl, 23 cm. See subsection 3.3.5 for information on placement of abbreviations pertinent to dates. A few other abbreviations are permitted. Examples: et al., e.g., i.e., ca., cf. ("compare against"; does not mean "see"), vs. (not versus), rev. ed., 3 vols. Never use ibid. or op. cit; follow the conventions for in­text citations given in section 3.4. Always spell out percent except in tables. 

3.3.12 Accents. 
For both journals, include all common accents for French, Spanish, Portuguese, German, etc. in the text and in the References Cited section. Be sure the accents are clearly marked, accurate, and consistent. Pay particular attention to proper names and titles of works (the rules for placement of accents in Spanish hold for all place names in Spanish, even on words that were hispanicized from

other languages such as Nahuatl or Mayan). Examples: Teotihuacim, Chichen Itza, Copan, Ka­minaljuyu. Foreign book titles set in all capital letters will not display accents, except for letters such as N in Spanish. However, because the titles in the References Cited section of the journals are set with initial capitals only, the author is responsible for adding accents to a title ifaccents are used throughout the book or article (even if accents do not appear in the all-capitals title). Never add accents to initial-capitals-only titles that do not have them in the original. 


3.4 In-Text Reference Citations for ARTICLES, REPORTS, etc. 
There are two different formats used for text citations in the journals, and these are discussed below. Note that CURRENT RESEARCH and REVIEWS AND BOOK NOTES follow a different format than that used for ARTICLES, REPORTS, COMMENTS, and FORUM contributions. 
In-text year citations always immediately follow the name(s) of the author(s). All of the examples make use of parentheses in their ordinary format. However, when reference citations are used in textual material set off in parentheses, the parentheses in the citations convert to brackets. Example: (see, e.g., Shapere [1985] on the constitution of "observations" in physics, and Kosso [ 1989) on observation in science generally). For examples of citations in quoted material see subsection 3.3.6, above. 

3.4.1 Simple citation, with no page numbers, etc., specified. 
(Wylie 1991) or Wylie (1991) 

3.4.2 Two authors. 
(Barnes and Fleming 1991) or Barnes and Fleming (1991) 

3.4.3 Three or more authors. 
(Co bean et al. 1991) or Co bean et al. (1991) 
Note: Use of "et al." is limited to in-text citations. The only time all names should be listed for a paper with three or more authors in a text citation is when a person is senior author of more than one jointly authored item in the same year. Example: Barnosky, Anderson, and Hartlein ( 1987) and Barnosky, Grimm, and Wright (1987) would appear as shown, not as Barnosky et al. (l 987a, 1987b). Whereas the use of et al. is permissible in text citation, in the References Cited section all names must be listed following the senior author's name. 

3.4.4 	Several different authors cited in one place and/or several references by the same author. .
(Ashmore 1986; Coe 1965; de Montmollin 1988; Fox 1987, 1991; Freidel 1986; Freidel and Schele 1986; Freidel et al. 1990) 
Note how semicolons are used to separate works by different authors and how commas are used to separate distinct, chronologically ordered works by the same author. References are always ordered alphabetically within strings, by author. Note that de Montmollin is alphabetized here under "d," as the name would also be alphabetized in the References Cited section. 

3.4.5 Two or more references by the same author or authors in the same year. 
(Jones and Brown 1972a, 1972b; Wilson 1973c) or Jones and Brown (1972a, 1972b) and Wilson (l 973c) 
Note: When an individual or individuals have both authored and edited (or compiled) publications with the same date, and both are cited, the edited (or compiled) volume is to be distinguished in citation as follows. Example: (Adams, ed. 1977) or Adams (ed. 1977). Edited (or compiled) volumes are so identified in the text only when potential ambiguity occurs. The authored publication precedes

the edited (or compiled) one in both citation and reference. Example: (Flannery 1976; Flannery, ed. 1976) or Flannery (1976) and Flannery (ed. 1976). 

3.4.6 Two authors, same surname, same year published. 
(J. Smith 1982; N. Smith 1982) or J. Smith (1982) and N. Smith (1982) 

3.4.7 Two authors, same surname, different years published. 
(Smith 1982; Smith 1987) or Smith (1982), Smith (1987) 

3.4.8 Citation of government agency, company, etc. 
(United States Department of Agriculture, Soil Conservation Service [USDA, SCS] 1975) 
Note: State the complete name of the agency, company, etc., as with any other citation, but if the citation will occur more than once in the text, then abbreviate names to their commonly accepted acronyms and place in brackets. Thereafter when mentioned in the text the citation will be, e.g., (USDA, SCS 1975) or USDA, SCS (1975). 

3.4.9 Citation with pages, figures, or tables specified. 
(Smith 1977:3), (Jones and Wilson 1971 :Figure 2), (Johnson et al. 1970:Table 1), (Taylor 1964: 23, 72-78) or Smith (1977:3), Jones and Wilson (1971:Figure 2), Brown (1968:533-534), Johnson et al. (1970:Table 1), Taylor (1964:23, 72-78) 
Note: Use a colon to separate date of publication from additional information. There should be no space between colon and additional information. Page numbers must always be given when direct quotations are used in the text or when other authors' ideas are directly paraphrased. Always use full page numbers in a citation, e.g., 312-315 not 312-15. Never use ff. or passim (however, it is permissible to use "ff." as an abbreviation for folios). Spell out and capitalize such words as Figure, Table, Plate, etc. If citing a figure, table, etc., do not include the page number on which it occurs unless additional, separate textual information from that page is being cited as well. 

3.4.10 Citation to multivolume set. 
(Thwaites 1896-1901: 17:232-236, 19: 197) or Thwaites (1896-1901: 17:232-236, 19: 197) 
Note: In this example, "17'' and "19" refer to the volume numbers. Volume number should be cited exactly as it appears in the series, i.e., in Roman numerals or in Arabic numerals. 

3.4.11 Citation to forthcoming book, or article in journal issue in press. 
(Kuttruff 1992) or Kuttruff (1992) 
Note: Everything has a date. Never use "n.d." or "in press" with in-text citations. Give date either of manuscript completion (in the case of a manuscript that is "on file" somewhere), or of manuscript submission or anticipated publication date for an item that has been accepted for publication. Also see subsection 3.9.20, below. Written permission must be supplied from any author whose in-press work is being cited. 

3.4.12 No author specified. 
Cite the group or agency issuing the report, or the publisher. 
(United Nations 1963), (Committee on Ethics 1977) or United Nations (1963), Committee on Ethics (1977) 
Note: Also see subsection 3.9.6, below.

3.4.13 Citation of primary-source materials (e.g., unpublished archival materials including admin­istrative records, letters, etc.). 
Citations for much primary-source material will be archive specific, so that it is impossible to devise a rote formula for citation. It is important to include the name of the archive, title of the work (if named), nature of the material (e.g., letter [optional]), collection name, identification number (legajo, fascicle, folio, etc.), date (if known), and geographic location of material. Consider the following examples: 
(Archivo General de la Nacion, Lima [AGN], Juzgado de Aguas 3.3.7.23, f. 3v); note that sub­sequent citations would use only the acronym AGN and the shortened "Aguas" (e.g., AGN, Aguas 3.3.4.39, 3.3.9.9) 
(Archivo General de Indias, Seville [AGI], Papeles de Cuba, legajo 2365, f. 345); subsequent citation = (AGI, Cuba, legajo 2365, f. 523) 
(McHenry County Courthouse, Woodstock, Illinois [MCC] 1880: Deed Book [DB] 1:5); subse­quent citation= (MCC 1890:DB 2:10) 
(Raimond Quenel, Etienne Govreau, and Marie Louise Quenel to de Gruys Verloins, sale of property, 8 February 1752, Kaskaskia Manuscripts [KM], Office of Randolph County Clerk, Chester, Illinois); subsequent citation= (KM 52:2:8:1) 
(F. Boas to E. B. Howard, letter, 9 May 1935, Boas Papers, American Philosophical Society, Philadelphia) 
Note: Primary-source citations appear only in the text and are not duplicated in the References Cited section. If you are citing primary-source material from a published source, you must follow conventional citation rules in the text and in the References Cited. It is preferable to cite Latin American codices by the editor of the particular edition of the codex used (unless the actual document was consulted), e.g., (Dibble 1980) for the sixteenth-century Cadice Xolotl. See corresponding ex­ample in subsection 3.9.3. 

3.4.14 Citation with earlier edition specified. 
In cases where many years separate the original publication of an item and a reprinted edition, and where it is important to the author's argument to indicate the use of period sources, the original date of publication should be placed in brackets following citation, in usual fashion, of the reprint edition. 
(Cobo 1956:169 [1653]) 
(Russell and Erwin 1980 [ 1865]) 
Note: See corresponding examples in subsection 3.9.5. 
3 .4.15 Citation of newspapers. 
(Weekly Missouri Courier [WMC], 7 July 1838:page numbers [if available]) 
Note: After first mention, simply use WMC with date and page. Also see subsection 3.9.12. 

3.4.16 Personal communication, no publication involved. 
(Katharina Schreiber, personal communication 1990) or Katharina Schreiber (personal com­munication 1990) 
Note: Give full name and date. Personal communications should be used sparingly and should never be used when a published citation is available for the same information. Written permission to use
