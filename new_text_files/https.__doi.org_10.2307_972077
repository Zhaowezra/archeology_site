development during the Valdivia period on the coast of Ecuador as a model for the "Neolithic Revolution" in the northern Andean area. The absence of any effort to compare settlement and subsistence changes with those on the coast of Peru reduces the value of his reconstruction. Dillehay describes the role of cere­monial places among the modem Mapuche of Chile in regulating land use among lineages as a possible model for interpreting similar kinds of sites elsewhere in the Andean area. Ardilla reviews paleoclimatological and archaeological evidence for the peopling of northern South America. His assertion that the evidence for early adaptation to diverse habitats and the absence of the traditional distinction between hunting (Paleoin­dian) and fishing-gathering (Archaic) stages require re­vision of traditional models based on North American data is well taken, as is his complaint that North Amer­icans rarely consider the views of their South American colleagues. 
Part III contains three interesting contributions on nontraditional applications of archaeology. Members of the Equipo Argentino de Antropologia Forense de­scribe their efforts to identify victims of political per­secution, particularly in the Southern Cone countries, and to evaluate other kinds of human rights violations from skeletal remains. Lopez Mazz agues that the 10,000-year archaeological record and survivals of in­digenous elements in rural communities provide es­sential ingredients for defining Uruguayan national identity. Finally, Vasco Uribe describes the collabo­ration between archaeologists and members of the Guambia indigenous community in south highland Colombia in the recuperation of their cultural and his­torical antecedents. His account of disagreements over field methods, identification of features, criteria for classifying pottery, and other matters illustrates im­portant differences and calls into question the assump­tion that indigenous behavior and beliefs can be in­
ferred from surviving material remains. Equally 
interesting are the extensive quotations from members 
of the Guambia community concerning the role and 
content of the resulting museum, particularly in the 
context of similar projects underway in the United 
States. 
Having begun my own archaeological career during 
the 1940s, when prospects for employment and fund­
ing for fieldwork were similar to those encountered in 
most of South America today, and having maintained 
close relations with colleagues in the countries repre­
sented in this volume for decades, I may be in a better 
position than most other North Americans to appre­
ciate the magnitude of the obstacles and the sacrifices 
required to overcome them. Professionals must often 
hold two or more jobs to earn a living wage, foreign 
scientific publications are rarely available (a subscrip­
tion to Latin American Antiquity may be half a month's 
wage), a few hundred dollars is a bonanza for fieldwork, 
funds for radiocarbon dating are unavailable, and op­
portunities for publication are scarce. In spite of these 
drawbacks, students flood the universities, and much 
important fieldwork is being done. The least we can 
do is accord their efforts and accomplishments the re­
spect and attention they clearly deserve. 
Chavfn and the Origins of Andean Civilization. RICH­ARD L. BURGER. Thames and Hudson, New York, 1993. 248 pp., 245 illustrations, chart, appendix, notes, bibliography, index. $49.95 (cloth).

For several years, Thames and Hudson has been producing many fine, highly readable books on a va­riety of archaeological topics and regions. With the publication of Chavfn and the Origins of Andean Civ­ilization by Richard Burger, this tradition continues in admirable fashion. 
Richard Burger, a leading scholar on the early cul­tures of ancient Peru, has produced a stimulating book on the origins, development, and collapse of the Chav­in culture-a topic he has personally been investigating for the past 20 years. The book contains seven chapters plus a short epilogue thoroughly documenting early Andean civilization between 3000 and 200 B.C. 
Chapter one provides background information on 
the chronology and environmental setting that sets the 
tone for the rest of the book. The chronology is a ver­
sion of the Rowe-Lanning chronological scheme, mod­
ified by the use of calibrated dates that become signif­
icant for radiocarbon assays predating 1000 B.C. The 
environmental section is a particularly useful summary 
of significant environmental zones and climatological 
factors in the Andean area. 
Chapter two provides a detailed overview of the Late 
Preceramic period (3000-2000 B.C.). A strong feature 
of this chapter is its even-handed coverage of the coast, 
the highlands, and the tropical forest as well as possible 
connections with Ecuador. However, some controver­
sial issues are avoided. The existence of preceramic 
maize on the coast is only briefly noted, and the pos­
sibility that some "preceramic" sites, such as El Paraiso 
and Salinas de Chao, may actually be "aceramic" be­
cause published radiocarbon dates from those sites do 
not support a pre-2000 B.C. date, is not mentioned at 
all. 
In Chapter two Burger introduces one of his main 
themes-the absence of sumptuary grave goods reflects 
a lack of accumulated personal wealth, which in tum 
means to Burger that no significant social differences 
exist during the Late Preceramic period. Some lead­
ership in an essentially egalitarian society is acknowl­
edged in order to account for the mobilization and 
direction of labor to build public monuments. Nev­
ertheless, this leadership is viewed as a minor factor 
compared with the pervading religious ideology of the 
whole community, which is seen as the driving force 
behind the construction of monumental architecture. 
Chapters three and four deal with Initial-period so­
cieties respectively on the coast, in the highlands, and 
in the montane forest along the eastern slopes of the 
Andes. These chapters represent the best summary of 
Initial-period societies published to date. Most of the 
information reported appears to be accurately por­
trayed, although, given the size of the manuscript, there 
are inevitably some errors. For example, at Huaca de 
los Reyes in the Moche Valley, Burger reports that 12 
large feline head friezes were uncovered. In fact, only

4 of 6 such heads have been excavated to date. In addition, he assumes that there is a long construction history at the site when excavations have shown that most of the site was built during one major construc­tion phase. 
To Burger's credit, he portrays the Initial period as a much more important time period in Peruvian pre­history than most previous scholars. He correctly as­signs most of the major coastal monumental sites (Gar­agay, La Florida, Carda!, Sechin Alto, Pampa de las Llamas-Moxeke, Punkuri, and Huaca de los Reyes) to the Initial period and acknowledges their immense size and careful planning. As recently as a few years ago, many scholars would still have dated these monuments to the Early Horizon and associated them with the Chavin phenomenon. 
In our opinion, however, he has not gone far enough in portraying the cultural dynamism of the Initial pe­riod. While acknowledging that Initial-period monu­ments are some of the largest ever built in Peru, Burger insists that such monuments, no matter how large, could have been built by relatively small groups of people over long periods of time using a generalized religious ideology and collective will as guiding forces. Clearly, he has used his personal excavation data from Carda! and Mina Perdida on the central coast as the basis for a comprehensive reconstruction of ancient coastal so­cieties. These sites contain multiple, relatively small, construction phases that coincide with such a model. Nevertheless, he is in error in trying to apply such a model to all monumental construction along the coast. 
For example, at Pampa de las Llamas-Moxeke, Hu­aca A contains two construction phases, an earlier one containing ca. 85,000 m3 of construction fill and a later one of about 38,000 m3. At Caballo Muerto, Huaca Cortada contains an estimated 192,000 m3 of fill, all belonging to a single construction phase. In both cases, coordinated direction of substantial amounts of cor­porate labor over a relatively short time period was necessary. It is evident that one single model for Initial­period societies will not account for the variation in the archaeological record. 
For the Initial period, Burger again uses the relative 
lack of exotic grave goods to argue for a lack of social 
class distinctions during that time period. It should be 
noted that where exotic items do appear in burials at 
sites such as La Galgada, Burger goes to great lengths 
to downplay their potential importance. He is not the 
first archaeologist to rely heavily on burial-pattern ev­
idence to reconstruct ancient social organization, but 
he does so almost to the exclusion of other evidence. 
Clearly, more work needs to be carried out at Initial­
period sites, especially in domestic contexts, to clarify 
the situation. Based on the available data, however, 
we would argue that the size and careful planning of 
Initial-period monumental architecture necessarily re­
flects a certain degree of social differentiation and cen­
tralized control. 
Chapters five and six focus on Chavin de Huantar, 
the type site for the Chavin culture. The descriptions 
and illustrations are excellent. Many of the interpre­
tations concerning the architectural layout and asso­
ciated sculpture are interesting and provocative, par­
ticularly the hypothesis that the numerous and varied tenoned heads at the site represent various stages in shamanistic transformations into jaguars, eagles, or monkeys. Burger sees both coastal and montane forest influences in the architecture, ceramics, and iconog­raphy of the site and postulates that the site served as an important trade and religious center serving the highlands, coast, and montane forest. 
Much information in these chapters is presented con­fidently-as if there were no doubt about interpreta­tions of the available evidence. Such is not the case. Many theories concerning Chavin de Huantar and the society that built it rest on very shaky evidence. For example, Burger presents the traditional Old Temple-­New Temple architectural sequence and sculptural se­riation postulated by John Rowe in the 1960s. Close examination of the supporting evidence for both the architectural sequence and the sculptural seriation, however, shows that neither is solidly grounded. Ad­ditionally, Burger sees class stratification at Chavin de Huantar based on differential distribution of Spondy/us shell and stone artifacts as well as fish, shellfish, and. llama-bone remains. Again, this evidence is not es­pecially convincing. 
Chapter seven discusses the florescence and collapse ofChavin civilization. Here, Burger runs into difficulty. His idea that Chavin was a regional cult somewhat akin to examples ethnographically documented in Af­rica is intriguing, but it is also deceptive because this view includes the idea that the symbols of such regional cults can be extensively modified by local cult leaders to suit local needs. When applied to Chavin this means its iconography could be substantially altered yet sup­posedly mean more or less the same thing. Such flexible interpretation of Chavin iconography has always been a major problem within Chavin studies, and Burger's interpretation does not solve the problem. Neither does he offer a definition of what the Chavin art style is. To his credit, he has reefined the time span of the Early Horizon and the spread of the Chavin cult to 500-250 B.C., thus making the Early Horizon more of a horizon in a temporal sense. However, with the reassignment of most of the monumental coastal sites with friezes to the Initial period, the "Chavin cult" hardly exists along the central and north coast. Burger is reduced to citing examples from looted or isolated contexts, such as the Chongoyape gold or the Karwa textiles, to doc­ument the spread of the Chavin cult. Clearly there is 
still a definitional problem concerning the Chavin phe­
nomenon, but the question now is not how widespread 
was its "horizon" style, but rather, is it widespread 
enough even to be called a horizon style? We agree 
with Burger that much more work needs to be done 
on Early Horizon sites to resolve this problem. 
Despite our reservations about some interpretations, 
Burger's book is truly a superb volume that belongs on 
all Andeanists' bookshelves. The book is probably too 
detailed for textbook use except in specialized upper­
level undergraduate and graduate-level courses. The 
price tag is quite high for Thames and Hudson, but the 
illustrations and information provided make it worth 
the price.
