of a fertile place, source of all foods and water, has remained well anchored in contemporary myths, even if today its aspect as a netherworld seems secondary" (p. 140). The scarce information concerning Cincalco, "the house of corn," describes a fertile place, akin to Tlalo­can, with its marked lunar connotations (its master is none other than Huemac, patron of suicide). A little known netherworld, Chichihualcuauhco was reserved to the children who died young. Ragot quite rightly empha­sizes the multiple associations of this place where the chil­dren suckle the milk of a nursing tree. This tree evokes Tamoanchan, a place of creation dominated by Ometeotl. Chichihualcuauhco also maintains close links with Tlalo­can and Cincalco (the children are buried close to the grain silos) as well as with the solar paradise of the war­riors, who are compared to birds just like the dead chil­dren. This leads the author to examine the delicate problem of the possible existence of a belief in reincar­nation, a notion she refutes even if certain indications might allow us to consider the possibility of reincarna­tion in the case of children assimilated to "images" (ixiptla) of the ancestors. Following Lopez Austin (Tamoanchan y Tlalocan, 1994 ), Ragot examines the data relating to Tamoanchan, place of abundance and happi­ness, in particular the poetic sources. 
The last chapter is devoted to Cihuatlampa, "land of the women" and with khan Tonatiuh Ilhuicac, "sky house of the sun." Close to the earth and to the moon, the first netherworld was populated by women who died in labor and who accompanied the sun in the western part of its course. Ragot describes in detail these Cihuateteo, divine women assimilated to warriors, frightening seductresses associated with dirt, sexual transgressions, and diseases. As for the solar paradise of the warriors, it is conceived as a desert plain identified with a battlefield. Accompa­nying the sun to the zenith, transformed into birds and butterflies in the afternoon in Tamoanchan, the warriors killed in war or on the stone of sacrifice are carrying the sky aloft but are also menacing stars in the night. Start­ing from this cyclic model worked out by Graulich, Ragot specifies the functions of these dead, the "divine food" of the star, and examines in detail the Tzitzimime, little­known malefic creatures who originated in the transfor­mation of the warriors and the Cihuateteo. 
Precise and well documented, Ragot's book fills in a gap in the Mesoamerican literature. One can only regret that the iconographic approaches, outlined for example in connection with Mictlantecuhtli, were not developed more fully. In spite of this minor reservation, Les au-de las azteques constitutes an indispensable reference on one of the most fundamental topics for understanding Mesoamerican cosmovision.

Tezcatlipoca is one of the most important figures of the Nahuatl pantheon, if not the most. Yet, as Guilhem Olivier stresses in his introduction, the fascination Quetzalcoatl (the priest god of Tollan and counterpart of Tezcatlipoca) long exerted on scholars has left this no less-attractive god in relative obscurity. Olivier's work is thus a welcome one for the studies of Mesoamerican ancient religion. 
The study is organized in a very "classical" way, mostly by area of investigation (name analysis, represen­tation, ritual, etc.) and some sections present a synthesis of previous works on the topic. Chapter I is a review of the various names of the god and contains useful infor­mation on the less-often mentioned "calendar names." The representation of the divinity is the subject of chap­ter 2. This overview of colonial written sources and icono­graphic data (both prehispanic and colonial) is impressive. Yet, the reading of table 1 (iconographic elements asso ­ciated with codices' representations of Tezcatlipoca) is made difficult by the lack of direct references to the (fine) illustrations, which are grouped together at the end of the book. A short discussion of all the iconographic elements listed, and of the criteria for their identification, would also have been appreciated. I hope the author will carry out his wish to offer a more comprehensive version of this useful table. Chapter 3 presents an analysis of the rela­tion between the god and various elements of Nahuatl symbolism, through the mythic and iconographic mater­ial. The well-known myths telling the end of the city of Tollan are analyzed in chapter 4. In chapters 5 (cult places and priests) and 6 (Toxcatl, the feast dedicated to Tez­catlipoca), Olivier offers interesting information and inter­pretation on understudied or poorly understood and yet essential topics. Among the noteworthy themes of this book are the relation between the tlaquimilolli (sacred bundle) and the enthronement of the king, the role of music in myths and rituals, the ritual use of body paint­ing, and the significance of the momoztli altar. 
The most original contribution of the study is proba­bly the hypothesis on Tezcatlipoca's mutilated leg pre­sented in chapter 7 (which I summarize only in part). The mutilated leg is not an easy issue. The motif may be con­nected to the limp theme, present in both the New and Old Worlds. Following Olivier's analysis, it seems to appear in Mesoamerica in the Toltec period. Although the mutilation is a primordial element in the iconogra-'

REVIEWS AND BOOK NOTES 
phy ofTezcatlipoca, very scarce information on this strik­ing feature is to be found in the written sources. Going beyond hypotheses on the astral meaning of the mutila­tion, the author convincingly and brilliantly argues that the god's foot is cut by the Earth (sometimes represented as a biting crocodile) in a metaphorical sexual relation­ship that can be related to the conception of the com-child. This could be (in my opinion) the Mesoamerican "miss­ing link" that would connect together Claude Levi­Strauss's interpretation of the limp as related to the periodicity of the seasons (Du miel aux cendres, 1966) and Fram;oise Heritier' s identification of the half-man or limping man as a "super male" concentrating the essence 
of masculinity (Masculin-feminin: la pensee de la dif­ference, 1996). 
This book presents an outstanding compilation of 
information on Tezcatlipoca; it seems that nothing 
escapes the author's attention. Yet, perhaps due to the pre­
sentation of the material by area of investigation, the 
reader is often confronted with a juxtaposition of dis­
parate data that are not sufficiently integrated among the 
chapters; this problem also stems from the extremely 
polyvalent and diverse nature of the god. Unfortunately, 
the portion of the conclusion dedicated to the discussion 
of some important themes of the study is too short to 
really redress the situation. 
In other respects, the reader could also wish for more 
attention to gender issues. Tezcatlipoca is an ambiguous 
character, presented as the archetypal male warrior, the 
seducer of the love goddess and the father of the com, 
and yet also sometimes referred to as a homosexual divin­ity. Gender relations and gender identity seem to be at the heart of Tezcatlipoca symbolism, but no chapter is specifically dedicated to this topic. Moreover, some assumptions are quite rapidly taken for granted, such as Tezcatlipoca being a "provider of women" because he is the god of war. Ruiz de Alarcon (Tratado de las super­sticiones, 1987) reports a seducer spell in which the cou­ple appears as Tezcatlipoca and Xochiquetzal, and where the seducer presents himself as a young man weeping for the beauty of the women he wants to enchant. Is he not acknowledging that he is not a warrior (ahmo nelli niyaotl, "I am not really Yaotl" [Enemy, a name of Tez­catlipoca related to war])? Is there a source stating that the ahuianime, the female companions of the warriors, are prisoners of war? What is the marrying pattern between members of conquering and vanquished cities? These issues are complex and certainly deserve a metic­ulous inquiry in the sources and scholarly works. On a broader perspective, this type of shortcoming may be an effect of the tendency shared by many symbolic analy­ses to underplay the social context in which these sym­
bols are created, transformed, and used. 
These few criticisms should not prevent one from reading Moqueries et metamorphoses. On the contrary, there is a need for more work of this kind and quality. Nahuatl symbolism is extremely rich and multivocal and is layered by centuries of symbol building and borrow­ing. Exhaustive studies of narrow and well-defined aspects of this fascinating religious thought, like Olivier's work on one god, are indispensable for a better under­standing of ancient Nahuatl religion.
