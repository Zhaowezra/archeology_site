Over 30 funerary bundles were excavated in 2005 from a large chamber tomb at the prehispanic religious center of Pacha­camac on the central coast of Peru. The largest and most elaborate bundle was found in the innermost part of the tomb. tightly surrounded by other bundles. We hypothesized that this bundle contained the deceased leader of a social group whose members collectively cared for their ancestor's bundle (for example, by rewrapping it) and continued to use the tomb to inter deceased individuals from subsequent generations. We tested this hypothesis by dating samples from different 
layers of the wrapping materials and soft tissue from the bodies and conducting a Bayesian analysis of the resultant dates. We determined carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios in the diet of the interred individuals to correct for marine reservoir effects. Our findings suggest that (1) rewrapping did not occur; (2) the tomb was used for over 500 years starting at cal A.D. 1000; and ( 3) existing bundles were reshuffled each time new bundles were introduced. Overall, diverse lines of evidence indicate that the tomb had a complex use history and contained individuals with diverse geographical and social origins. This chal­lenges conventional thinking about the social and chronological significance of coexisting bundles in large tombs.

hroughout the prehispanic Central Andes, Troughly corresponding to the extent of modem Peru, religious centers played a critical social integrative role from at least 3000 B.C. until the Spanish conquest in A.D. 1532­1535 (Bonnier 1997; Pozorski and Pozorski 2008; Shady 2008). The Spaniards documented that Pachacamac was one of the most revered religious centers in all of Peru (Cieza de Leon 1932 [1554]; Estete 1985 [1534]; Garcilaso de Ia Vega 2006 [ 1609]) . Spanish eyewitnesses and other Colonial writers left accounts of the fame and power of the oracle who resided at the Temple of Pachaca­mac (known today as the Painted Temple) , which was dedicated to the dualistic , tellurian pre-Inca patron deity (Calancha 1976 [1638]; Cieza de Leon 1932 [1554]; Cobo 1964 [1653]; Dulanto 2001; Duviols 1967, 1983; Estete 1985 [1534]; Gisbert 1990; Rostworowski 1973, 1992). Upon conquering the coast around A .D. 1460, the Inca constructed their Sun Temple adj acent to the Painted Temple, attempting to co-opt the oracle for their own ideological and political ends (Pat­terson 1985). The fame of both the oracle and the deity attracted many pilgrims from near and distant regions, and the privileged few who were allowed access to the inner sanctuary of the Painted Temple had first to endure a year-long fast in the adjacent forecourt, according to Pizarro (1959 [ 1553]). Not surprisingly, since the pioneering work of Max Uhle (l 903) toward the end of the nineteenth century, the site has been investigated by various Peruvian and foreign projects (see Daggett 1988; Eeckhout 1999; Shimada 1991 for summary dis­cussions of earlier fieldwork at the site). However, most archaeological work conducted at the site has been poorly published, limited in scope, scale, and duration, and overly concerned with highly visible late prehispanic monumental, elite, and religious constructions (Kaulicke 2000; Shimada 1991; Shimada et al. 2010). Additionally, heavy reliance on stylistic dating of excavated materials and features-primarily ceramics and funerary customs-has resulted in an inadequate occupa­tional chronology of the site, particularly for the Early Intermediate period and the Middle Horizon (Segura and Shimada 2010). Since 2003, the Pachacamac Archaeological Project (www.pachacamac.net), codirected by Shimada, Segura, and Maria Rostworowski, has conducted fieldwork at the site with the primary aim of elucidating the social foundations of Pachacamac-i.e., the social identity, composi­tion, roles, and organization of the individuals responsible for the daily operations, longevity, and power of Pachacamac (Shimada et al. 2005). To achieve this aim, the project excavated pre­sumed residential areas and searched for intact burials (Shimada et al. 2010). 
A ground-penetrating radar survey revealed a relatively undisturbed area located within the Uhle Cemetery, directly in front of the Temple of Pachacamac. Excavations in this area, designated Trench 7-'05 and measuring 7 m by 6 m, revealed a nearly intact keyhole-shaped chamber tomb (Tomb 1-2) that contained at least 34 complete funerary bundles. Each bundle contained the com­plete or partial remains of a tightly flexed indi­vidual. This group grave was similar in form and contents to large tombs found in the Paracas Necropolis of Wari Kayan (Dwyer and Dwyer 1975; Tello and Mejia 1979). There, tombs con­tained relatively small funerary bundles arranged around one or a few centrally placed large bun­dles. Based on this historical antecedent, we hy­pothesized that Tomb 1-2 was built by a commu­nity or lineage that shared a single ancestor and whose descendants used the tomb repeatedly but intermittently. Although it is uncommon for so many funerary bundles to be methodically placed in a single tomb at Pachacamac, our excavation of Trench 7-'05 also documented two similarly large chamber tombs in the adjacent area just to the north of Tomb 1-2. Subsequent to our exca­vation, Peter Eeckhout and his team recovered numerous dispersed human burials that were in a poorer overall state of preservation in three suc­cessive layers below the walls built just north of the Uhle Cemetery (Eeckhout 2010; Eeckhout and Owens 2008). Their contexts and treatments suggest individuals of lower social positions than those described here. 
The excavated funerary bundles and associated human remains and offerings were subjected to a variety of archaeometric analyses to define their chemical and mineral composition, radiocarbon date, geographical provenience, and biological features (e.g., age, sex, mtDNA, and develop­mental health), as well as their social position

and ethnic identity (Shimada et al. 2010). A key component of our interdisciplinary study was the systematic radiocarbon dating by accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) of the funerary bundles and their human remains, together with complemen­tary carbon and nitrogen stable isotope analysis. We have already reported on the exploratory 14C dates from the clothes in the bundles (Shimada et al. 2010). 
However, samples of the cloth and other or­ganic materials that wrapped or otherwise encased the corpse do not always provide an accurate date for the death of the individual or for the original preparation of a bundle. Ethnohistorical docu­ments record widespread ancestor worship among many societies in the Inca Empire; in the high­lands, mummified corpses were carefully pre­served in caves and other protective shelters and cared for by the living (Betanzos 1987 [1551]; Guaman Poma de Ayala 1980 [1615]; Isbell 1997; Kaulicke 2000; Maccormack 1991; Salomon 1995) . Ancestors periodically received food, drink, and new clothing or wrappings. In the case of the Paracas Necropolis, elaborate bundles used stylistically different textiles for the inner and outer layers (Dwyer and Dwyer 1975). Addition­ally, there is now ample archaeological documen­tation of the widespread pre-Inca practices, preva­lent along much of the Peruvian coast, of delayed interment, tomb visitation, and alteration of hu­man and other tomb contents long after original interment (Arriaza 1995; Hecker and Hecker 1992; Millaire 2002; Nelson 1998; Shimada et al. 2004, 2012). 
A further complicating factor is that direct '4C dating of human tissue does not always provide an accurate date for the death of the individual. The heavy consumption of marine protein by the prehispanic inhabitants of coastal Peru can lead to a significant disparity between the 14C age and the true age of the remains due to the marine reser­voir effect (Stuiver et al. 1986; Stuiver and Braz­iunas 1993). This reservoir effect, which results in anomalously old radiocarbon ages, is caused in part by the upwelling of very old oceanic waters in the Humboldt Current. This effectively distorts the 14C content of the surface water, and hence of the organisms that live and feed in it. The marine reservoir effect in fauna from the Peruvian coast can be as large as 550-650 radiocarbon years and may affect the measured age of human remains due to their high consumption of seafood (Jones et al. 2007; Owen 2002). 
It is apparent that the active and lasting rela­tionship between the living and the dead, the at­tendant manipulation of the funerary process or of the bundles themselves, and the marine reser­voir effect could all pose a significant barrier to our attempts to accurately determine the chronol­ogy of funerary bundles and activities associated with the tomb. 
In this paper we determine the "biography" or use history of the tomb by ( 1) establishing the timing of the death of each one of the individuals encased in the funerary bundles and (2) evaluating the possibility that rewrapping occurred. We do this by comparing the 14C dates obtained from the tissues of the mummies with samples obtained from their clothes and by refining the dates of the bundles through the use of Bayesian statistics. 
The Site of Pachacamac 
The site of Pachacamac is located on the central coast of Peru , .5 km northeast of the Pacific and 25 km southeast of Lima (Figure 1) . Standing ar­chitecture and other cultural remains occupy an area of about 5 km2 on a sand-covered pediment overlooking the Pacific, the mouth of the Lurfn River, and the Urpi Kocha lagoon (Shimada et al. 2012; Winsborough et al. 2012). Based pri­marily on pottery and architectural styles, the cul­tural chronology of the site has been divided into four periods: Lima (ca. A.D. 350-650), Pachaca­mac (ca. A.D. 650-1000), Ychsma (ca. A.D. 1000-1470), and Inca (ca. A.D. 1470-1533) (Shi­mada 1991; Shimada et al. 2010). 
Reflecting the emphasis of nearly all prior pro­jects, most of the reported 14C dates for the site of 
Pachacamac are from monumental architectural contexts (Paredes and Franco 1985, 1987; Ravines and Alvarez 1967).Additionally, the small number of samples and their dispersed contexts do not al­low statistical analysis of their reliability. Accord­ing to Paredes and Franco ( 1985, 1987) , Pyramid with Ramps II, constructed during the Y chsma period, dates to between 654 ± 80 B .P. and 600 ± 70 B .P. based on samples from a wooden lintel and a wooden post, respectively. The Painted Tem­ple, built in the Pachacamac phase, was dated to

1180 ± 70 B.P. based on a sample from a lucuma (Pouteria obovata) post inside the circular pedestal base on top of the temple. 
As an extension of their detailed investigation of the Y chsma-period occupational history at Pachacamac, Eeckhout and his colleagues, espe­cially Adam Michczynski, dated many samples from different pyramids with ramps. Michczynski et al. (2003) report on dates obtained from sam­ples (wood, charcoal, grains, and other macrob­otanical remains) derived from excavations at Pyramid with Ramps III, located in the north­eastern sector of the site. Their dates, calculated with Bayesian methods, show that Pyramid with Ramps III was built around the same time as Pyramid with Ramps II and saw subsequent use and rebuilding until the end of the Y chsma period or the beginning of the Inca period. 
More recently, Michczynski et al. (2007) dated samples derived from the Temple of the Monkey, which was built before Pyramid with Ramps III and was used for 150 years until Spanish conquest in A.D. 1535. Based on the intensity and extent of construction and occupation at Pachacamac, the modification of the series of monumental pyramids with ramps, and the greater size and quality of these pyramids relative to others of the same type found elsewhere, Eeckhout (1999, 2003) argues that the site served as the capital of a multi-valley Ychsma ethnic polity and that the period of its regional political dominance repre­sented the pinnacle of the long site history of Pachacamac. 
The site of Pachacamac was divided into four sectors (see Figure 1). The two southernmost sec­tors (I and II) housed all of the site's major adobe mounds and temples. The well-known Inca Sun Temple, the Painted Temple, and the earlier Lima Temple were found in the most sacred area, Sector 
I. According to written records from the Spanish Colonial period (Cieza de Leon 1932 [1554]; Es­tete 1985 [1534]; Garcilaso de la Vega 2006 [1609]), many pilgrims came from all over Peru, and some waited for up to a year in the outer areas of the site to be close to the deity that they venerated. However, only members of the elite could enter Sector I and have the privilege of be­ing buried close to the Painted Temple. 
However, our excavations in 2003 and 2005 of the pre-Inca levels (predominantly from the Y chsma period) of the Pilgrims' Plaza yielded ample and diverse lines of evidence of early spring ritual activities and offerings, suggesting that members of diverse ethnic and social groups had access to the sacred ground immediately in front of the Painted Temple (Shimada et al. 2010).

mummies analyzed in the present study were ex­cavated from the very sacred ground immediately in front of the Painted Temple (see Figure 1) . 
Tomb 1-2 and Its Funerary Bundles 
Given the sacred nature of the area close to the Painted Temple, it was not surprising that our excavation of Trench 7-'05 revealed that it had been intensely used as a burial ground for cen­turies and that there had been competition for the privilege of being buried there . In addition to Tomb 1-2, our excavation exposed various fu­nerary bundles adjacent to the south side of the tomb (Shimada et al. 2010) . Some of these were intact, while others had been disturbed in both prehispanic and modern times. The burial cham­ber measured 2.25 m wide, at least 3.27 m long, and 1.53 m deep. It was defined by walls made of small adobe bricks and rectangular stone blocks and was covered by a roof of superim­posed layers of cattail (Typha sp.) leaves sup­ported by 12 lucuma beams and posts. The rooftop was only 15-20 cm below the original surface of the cemetery. 
Tomb 1-2 was apparently built during the early Ychsma period, based on the style of associated ceramics and the fact that it intruded upon and disturbed a late provincial Wari (stylistically Mid­dle Horizon Phase III) burial, as well as two ear­lier Lima-period burials. The tomb contained at least 34 relatively well-preserved funerary bun­dles divided into lower and upper levels by a layer of interlaced junco (rush; Juncus sp.) mat­ting (Figures 2 and 3). The eastern end of the tomb remains unexcavated and may contain a few additional funerary bundles. The lower and upper levels contained 27 and 7 tightly packed bundles, respectively. 
Although a detailed description of the materials and construction of the bundles is beyond the scope of this paper, they can be briefly summarized here. Bundle size (excluding artificial ["false"] heads) varied considerably: the largest measured roughly 80 cm in both diameter and height, while the small­est measured 25 cm in diameter and 45 cm in height. Analysis of the skeletal remains found in­side the bundles that we unwrapped or that were exposed in decomposed bundles suggests that 19 large bundles contained adults, while the remaining 17 smaller ones encased the corpses of fetuses, newborns, or juveniles. 
The adult bundles were prepared in a nested manner starting with a tightly flexed mummy or articulated skeleton, often with some preserved soft tissue, most commonly wrapped in a cotton shroud. In the case of Fardo B, the largest and most elaborate funerary bundle, the mummy was dressed in a fine-quality decorated tunic of camelid fiber (Figures 4 and 5). Particular care had been taken to protect the heads by wrapping them with one or more pieces of cloth, often dec­orated. The cloth-wrapped mummy was then en­cased in a coarse sack or net woven from thick ropes of junco or reeds (Scirpus sp.) that were knotted together to create a spherical form. Bun­dledjunco or reed, unprocessed cotton bolls, and other plant materials were stuffed inside and out­side the sack or net. The resulting bundle was covered by a cotton bag (usually plain-weave) or wrapped in a large cloth that was formed by sewing together smaller pieces of cloth (Figure 6). The preceding steps were repeated with some degree of variation until the desired form and size were achieved. 
After three or four layers were formed, one or two wood or cane poles, roughly 60 to 70 cm in length, were placed vertically for support along each side of the encased corpse (see Diaz and Vallejo 2005:297-300). The use of these lateral supports seems to have been restricted to the Y chsma funerary bundles and provided stability to the body, assuring that it stayed upright, and helped with transport of the bundle before and after the primary interment (Shimada et al. 2010:134). Additionally, a large, shallow gourd plate ringed with bundled junco or reed was placed at the bottom of the flexed mummy for greater stability. 
The final steps of bundle preparation included encasing the whole bundle in a large cloth bag that seems to have symbolized a tunic, as well as placing one or more small cloth bags on the ex­terior. Some bundles (e.g., Fardos B and U) also had a "false head" formed with bundled junco or reed ropes and other plant materials placed inside a cloth bag and sewn onto the top of the bundle. 
Fardo B was exceptional not only for being the largest in size, but also for having the most elaborate construction. It had a pair of decorative

cloth strips sewn onto its exterior "tunic," a cinnabar-painted wooden mask, and a headdress (see Figure 4; Segura et al. 2006; Shimada et al. 2010). The feathers used in the headdress appear to be from the guacamayo (blue-yellow macaw; Ara ararauna) (George Olah, personal commu­nication 2011), which is widely distributed in the Amazon. The presence of a mask, a feather head­dress, and cinnabar paint was indicative of high status on the pre-Inca north and central coasts (Shimada et al. 2004; Degano and Colombini 2009). Cinnabar paint prepared from finely ground reddish mercuric sulfide (HgS) was widely used for centuries in the funerary prepa­ration of deceased elites among prehispanic coastal cultures and may have come from the well-known mercury mine of Huancavelica in the south-central highlands of Peru (Cooke et al. 
2009, 2013; also Brooke et al. 2013). The con­temporary Sican culture (A.D. 900-1375) of the north coast reserved cinnabar for elite burials, while reddish hematite (a form of iron oxide, Fez03) was used for commoners (Shimada I 995). 
Osteological analysis of human remains was possible for I 0 of the funerary bundles and for the burial (Entierro AH) adjacent to Tomb 1-2, also included in this sample. Human remains were unwrapped from all bundles that remained only partially intact at the time of excavation, and in two cases (Fardos B and W) completely intact bundles were unwrapped in the laboratory at the Pachacamac Site Museum. Preservation was excellent, with most bundles containing com­plete or nearly complete individuals that retained some hair, skin, and muscle tissue. Even the small bones of the hands and feet were present, sug-

gesting that most individuals were tightly flexed and then bundled as fully articulated corpses soon after death. In the sandy matrix immediately south of Tomb 1-2, we documented a series of roughly circular bundle bases that had decomposed, each with a partially preserved gourd vessel and du­plicate hand and foot bones, providing further support for the hypothesis that Tomb 1-2 had been subject to occasional episodes of rearrange­ment and alteration throughout its use history. As corpses decomposed and bundles were relocated, the small bones of the hands and feet would be the most likely to scatter and become incorporated into the surrounding matrix. 
The age and sex of each individual analyzed are reported in Table 1. Infection, osteoarthritis, and dental problems including carious lesions, extreme dental wear, and antemortem tooth loss were the most common pathologies observed in this sample. Surprisingly, the presumed elite in­dividual in Fardo B did not seem to experience any discernible advantages in terms of health compared with the rest of the sample and was similarly affected by dental wear and decay, in­fection, and osteoarthritis. Several crania pre­sented flattening of the occipital region that was often asymmetrical (more pronounced on the right side) and varied significantly between individuals in terms of severity and extent. The observed morphologies are more consistent with uninten­tional cranial changes that result from cradling or swaddling during infancy than with changes caused by intentional shape-altering practices, and, therefore, in this sample, cranial shape is not useful as a marker of ethnic identity or as­cribed social status. 
There is good evidence that the funerary pro­cessing of at least some individuals included in­tentional commingling and disarticulation. Bun­dles 0 and W contained nearly complete individuals as well as duplicate elements of the spine and pelvis, respectively. In the case of bun­dle W, it is interesting to note that the duplicate bone was placed in the innermost layer of the bundle, directly on top of the primary individual, and in correct anatomical position. Bundles Q, R, and W were missing crania, but otherwise con­tained complete or nearly complete post-cranial skeletons. It remains unclear whether these crania were removed via decapitation prior to the bundling of the corpses or at some point after initial funerary preparation, although the latter option seems more consistent with the data. While the crania were not present for observation, other skeletal elements likely to be affected by decap­itation, such as the cervical vertebrae, were free of cut marks. In one case (Bundle Q), it was ap­parent that the cloth wrappings were cut at the upper frontal region of the bundle, perhaps to re­move the head cleanly after the bundle had been completed (Shimada et al. 2010). This is a rare documented instance of intentional cutting of pre­hispanic Andean cloth (Mary Frame, personal communication 2006) . There was no evidence of the cut having been sewn back together. 
The removal or exclusion of certain skeletal elements and the inclusion of remains from mul­tiple individuals in a single bundle could certainly have taken place during rewrapping events, and yet there is little additional osteological evidence to suggest that such rewrapping occurred. In fact, the largely intact skeletons found within nearly all bundles are in direct contrast to what would be expected if individuals were wrapped and/or dressed multiple times over an extended period of time . Rewrapping seems unlikely from the os­teological data; if it did in fact occur, it would have taken place before significant decomposition of the soft tissues of the corpses. 
Samples and Methods 
Forty-seven samples of wrapping materials (cot­ton cloths, plant fiber ropes, and bundle stuffing), and 35 samples of muscle tissue were collected from the funerary bundles excavated from Tomb 1-2 and adjacent areas within Trench 7-'05. Of these, 22 cloth samples and 5 soft tissue samples underwent radiocarbon dating at the University of Tokyo, 2 cloth samples were dated at Beta An­alytic, Inc., and 6 muscle samples were dated at Yamagata University. Values of 813C and 815N were also obtained from six samples at the Na­tional Institute for Environmental Studies, Japan. 
Plant Pretreatment 
Pretreatment methods for cloth, rope, and net samples followed those outlined by Brock et al. (2010). Between 100 and 200 mg of the organic sample material were subjected to ultrasonic

cleaning to remove surface dirt and then soaked in methanol and chloroform (2:1 v/v) for two to three hours to remove lipids. Samples were then rinsed with ultra-pure water (Milli-Q). Following that, they were soaked in 1.2 M HCl at 80 °C for up to 12 hours to remove inorganic carbonate. The cloths were then either steeped in .2 M NaOH at 80 °C for 3 to 5 hours or in hot .5 M NaOH for 1 hour to remove any fulvic and humic acids (de­rived from soil organic matter) adhering to the samples. Finally, the samples were soaked in 1.2 M HCl at 80 °C to remove C02 that was blended into the NaOH solution. 
Pretreatment of Human Soft Tissue 
The methods described by Brock et al. (2010) were also used to pretreat the preserved human soft tissue (i.e., muscle and hair) samples. After soaking in methanol and chloroform (2: 1 v/v), tissue samples were soaked in .5 M HCl and heated to 20 °C for 12 hours, then soaked in .2 M NaOH for 4 to 5 hours or .5 M NaOH for 1 hour. Finally, samples were soaked in .5 M HCl at 25 °C for 3 to 4 hours. 
Graphitization and Radiocarbon Measurement 
All samples, containing 1 mg of carbon, were burned in air-evacuated tubes at 850 °C using the dual quartz tube method (Minagawa et al. 1984). The gas generated was cryogenically purified to C02 gas in a vacuum line. The C02 was converted to graphite by heating to 650 °C in the presence of H2 and 1 mg of iron powder (Kitagawa et al. 1993) . 
Samples were measured for radiocarbon con­tent using a series of standards of known age at the University of Tokyo Micro Analysis Labora­tory Tandem Accelerator (MALT), the Yamagata University Kaminoyama Research Institute AMS Center (YU-AMS), and Beta Analytic, Inc. (Mat­suzaki et al. 2007; Tokanai et al. 2011) . We used the weighted average efficiency for cases in which two 14C dates were proven indistinguishable ac­cording to the x2 test; otherwise, we calculated the arithmetic mean value . To calibrate conven­tional radiocarbon ages, we used the OxCal 4.1 calibration program and the IntCal09 dataset (Bronk Ramsey 2009a; Reimer et al. 2009). Al­though SHCal is the calibration curve most com­monly used for the Southern Hemisphere (Mc­Cormac et al. 2004), we consider the Northern Hemisphere IntCal09 curve to be more appropri­ate because the site of Pachacamac is located close to the Intertropical Convergence Zone (lat­itude 12°S), while SHCal was created using data based on a latitude of 55-30°S (Michczynski et al. 2007) . To correct for the marine reservoir ef­fect in human tissues, a local correction value (LiR) from the nearby Callao Bay (183 ± 18 and 194 ± 23 14C years) was partially applied (Jones et al. 2007). In this case, an arithmetic mean value (187 ± 29 14C years) was added to the Marine04 data, and a mixed calibration curve was generated by OxCal that incorporated an estimate of the proportion of seafood in the diet derived from the 013C and 015N analysis. 
Measurement of Stable Isotope Ratios 
Carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios preserved in human soft tissue were measured using a Carlo­Elba EA 1500 (combustion system), Finnigan Conflo II (interface), and Finnigan MAT252 (Iso­tope Ratio Mass Spectrometer) at the National Institute for Environmental Studies, Tsukuba, Japan. The samples , weighing .2-.3 mg, were packed into tin cups and loaded by an auto sam­pler. The standard deviations estimated from run­ning standards are .2%o and .4%0 for o13C and 015N, respectively. 

Results 
We first compared the apparent 1•c ages of soft tissue and cloth samples from the mummies to determine the timing of their deaths and the extent of any rewrapping (Table 2). The 1•c dates ob­tained from muscle tissue samples from five fu­nerary bundles-Fardos Q, R, U, W, and an in­trusive bundle (Tomb 1-2 Fardo E, labeled I.T.E.)-and a hair sample from the largest bundle (Fardo B) were older than those obtained from the wrapping materials of the same bundles. Based on the local marine reservoir age (ca. 550­650 14C years), the age gap between body and wrapping (14C age gap: 183-392 14C years) could have been caused by the marine radiocarbon reservoir effect through seafood consumption. 
We also quantitatively assessed the probability of rewrapping by estimating calibrated and cor­rected 14C ages of the human remains. In general, the apparent 14C age of marine organisms can be

calibrated using the global reservoir value re­flected in the Marine04 dataset (McCorrnac et al. 2004), together with a local marine reservoir correction (LiR: 187 ± 29 14C years in the case of coastal Peru). For human tissues containing both marine and terrestrial proteins, we applied a mixed calibration curve that combines terrestrial and marine datasets based on the percentage of marine protein in the diet. As marine protein also contributes significantly to the enrichment of 1'N, and because 013C can be affected by maize con­sumption, we estimated seafood consumption us­ing values of o 1'N and 013C in the lsoconc diet mixing model (Phillips and Koch 2002; Table 3; Figure 7). We assumed three end-members: C3 plants (011C: -24.5%0, 015N: 2.4%0, %C: 40.2, %N: 2.6; average value estimates based on potato and beans), maize (011C: -I0.4%0, 01'N: 6.9%0, %C: 40.4, %N: 1.2), and fish (o 13C: -14.7%0, 01'N: 18.8%0, %C: 40.7, %N: 10.6) and correlated iso­topic fractionation between human tissues (mus­cle and hair) and consumed foods (Arneson et al. 
2006; DeNiro and Hastorf 1985; Huckstadt et al. 2007; Szpak et al. 2013; White et al. 2009). The calibrated and corrected 14C ages for the human remains and calibrated data for the wrapping ma­terials are shown in Table 2. 
We compared the calibrated ages of the wrap­ping cloth with the marine-reservoir corrected and calibrated ages for each individual and found little difference. The dates agree within a range of 2a for the cloth and corrected soft tissue sam­pies (Table 2). The calibrated ages from Fardo R and I.T.E. agreed within la, while samples from Fardos Q, W, and B agreed at the 2a level. De­spite large errors associated with the 14C ages of muscle samples from Fardo U, the calibrated ages of the cloth and muscle corrected for the marine reservoir effect generally agreed with each other. Consequently, we believe that rewrapping either did not occur or was completed within a short period after death. 
The largest and most elaborate funerary bundle (Fardo B) was hypothesized as the principal ("an­cestor") bundle and the first to be placed in Tomb 1-2, with the other funerary bundles subsequently placed around it. We carefully examined the pos­sibility that Fardo B was rewrapped by measuring distinct samples from three layers of wrapping. We measured the exterior layer twice and also took samples from the second and fifth layers. The fifth layer was not the innermost one, but rather a plant fiber net very close to the body that prevented the mummy bundle from collapsing. A x2 test, carried out with the Combine function within the Oxcal program, on the dates obtained from the three layers of cloth-exterior layer: 667 ± 28 B.P. (MTC-12440); exterior layer: 705 ± 43 B.P. (MTC-12546); second layer: 760 ± 40 
B .P. (Beta-244629); and fifth layer: 690 ± 40 B .P. (Beta-244628)-confirrned that these four dates can be regarded as contemporaneous (T = 3.7; df

the Outlier Model function within Oxcal (Bronk Ramsey 2009b). We used the s-type outlier model with a probability of .05 for each outlier, with the exception of one of the cloths, which was suspected of being wrapped in a later period. The results of the test indicated that there were no outliers present within the dates obtained from the wrapping materials of Fardo B (agreement index: 90.9 in this model). Therefore, both the inner and outer materials wrapping the mummy can be interpreted to be of the same age, sug­gesting that Fardo B had not been rewrapped since original interment. 
Based on this evidence, we can assume that 1•c dates obtained from cloth wrapping at this site serve as good estimates of the timing of mummi­fication. The absence of pupae and maggots of sarcosaprophagous flies inside the bundles (see Faulkner 1986) suggests that the corpses were ei­ther bundled soon after death, before the onset of putrefaction, or after natural mummification was completed. On this basis , we propose a chrono­logical framework for the intact burials in Tomb 1-2 based on the dates obtained from the cloths of each mummy. We calibrated the 1•c ages to calen­darages and simulated the start and end boundaries using a Bayesian analysis with a group model, employing the Oxcal software program (Figure 8; Bronk Ramsey 1995, 2009a) . The oldest funerary bundle, Fardo W, was dated to 1185 ± 51 B.P. (cal AD. 930-990 at Is) and was found close to the rooftop entrance to Tomb 1-2. In contrast, the most recent funerary bundle in Tomb 1-2 was Fardo D, dated to 459 ± 49 B.P. (cal AD. 1410-1450 at 
la). Therefore, the series of mummies placed in Tomb 1-2 represent a wide time period of 470­580 years (la), or 435-670 years (2a), suggesting a long and complex history of tomb usage. 
mies were synchronous using the Outlier Model within Ox cal (Bronk Ramsey 2009b). The results confirm the hypothesis that the preparation and inferred entombment of 11 bundles from Fardo B to Fardo X were almost contemporaneous (Agreement Index: 73.8). 
We divided the calibrated ages into three pos­sible groups based on notable cultural transitions. Group I, with three individuals (Fardos Q and W and Entierro AH), corresponds to a transitional period between the earlier Pachacamac (Middle Horizon) and the initial Ychsma periods. Group II, composed of 16 individuals, is consistent with the Yschma-period culture. Group III (Fardos D, F, and A) is assigned to the late Y chsma and initial Inca periods. To determine the inferred or­der in which the mummies were placed in Tomb 1-2, we plotted the positions of the individuals within these three groups (Figures 9, 10). Two mummies in Group I were found near the en­trance, while Fardos D, F, and A of the younger Group III were placed around Fardo B, in the in­nermost area of tomb. This pattern does not agree with the supposition that the chronology of Tomb 1-2 started with the ancestral burial of Fardo B. 
Discussion 
Rewrapping of Mummies 
As noted above, prehispanic Andean funerary practices were quite diverse and complex, often involving delayed interment, curation, and rebur­ial (see Millaire 2002; Rakita et al. 2005; Shimada and Fitzsimmons 2012) . Prolonged interaction between the dead and the living thus raises the possibility that funerary bundles could be rewrapped. 
At Pachacamac, Michczynski et al. (2007:568) used Bayesian methods to test this possibility for the reburied bundle of an adult woman recovered at the Temple of the Monkey (Eeckhout 2002).

Using the Span function within the Oxcal pro­gram, they estimated a rewrapping time span of fewer than 50 years with a probability of 68 .2 percent. They did not, however, carry out a test with the Combine function to see whether radio­carbon dates all related to the same event-in other words, to test whether all of the organic samples were formed with the same radiocarbon reservoir at the same time. A x2 test on the two radiocarbon dates reported in Michczynski et al.

(2007)-430 ± 45 B.P. for the first burial and 400 ± 40 B.P. for the second burial-confirmed that these two dates can be regarded as contem­poraneous (T= .2; df= l, 3.8;p <.05). Therefore, as with our study of Fardo B, it cannot be said with confidence that this bundle from the Temple of the Monkey was rewrapped. 
In the case of Fardo B in Tomb 1-2 we esti­mated the time span between layers by carrying out a Span function on our radiocarbon dates

from the exterior layer (678 ± 24 B.P. , which combined dates of 667 ± 28 B .P. and 705 ± 43 B.P.) and from the fifth layer (690 ± 40 B.P.). The timespan between wrapping periods had a value of less than 25 years, with a probability of 
68.2 percent. If the bundle was rewrapped, this had to have happened within a very short span of time . Thus, it is unlikely that the Fardo B was taken care of for generations as an ancestor's bundle. On the contrary, it appears that many other bundles were placed in the tomb around the same time as Fardo B. 
"Biography " of Tomb 1-2 
While the oldest funerary bundle (Fardo W) dates to cal A.D. 870-1020 (2u), and corresponds to a still poorly understood period of occupation at the site (see Segura and Shimada 2010) , almost all the rest of the funerary bundles date from around the middle to the late Y chsma period. It is thought that Pachacamac had its most intensive and extensive occupation during the Y chsma pe­riod (cal. AD. 1000-1470) when Pyramids II and III were in use (e.g., Eeckhout 2003; Michczynski et al. 2003; Michczynski et al. 2007; Paredes and Franco 1987). The latest individuals, included in Group III, span the late Ychsma to early Inca oc­cupation . It is difficult to determine whether they relate to former occupation or to the latter, when the site was significantly altered and partially abandoned, because the degree of uncertainty as­sociated with our calibration curve is larger than the short span of Inca-period occupation (fewer than 100 years). 
Based on the documented locations of the bun­dles and on their dates, it appears that the bundles in Group I were the first to be placed in this tomb, followed by those in Group II, including Fardo 
B. The innermost placement of Fardo B, however, suggests that Group I bundles were temporarily removed and then re-deposited in a different con­figuration. Subsequently, Group III bundles were deposited around Fardo B in the lower layer, sug­gesting that existing bundles (excluding Fardo B) were once again rearranged. The thin roof of the burial chamber, about 15-20 cm thick and just below modern ground surface -and thus nearly at ground level in the Ychsma period­would have provided relatively easy access to the interior of the tomb (Shimada et al. 2010) . 
The presence of the abandoned nest and excre­ment of a burrowing owl inside the tomb supports this inference. Clearly, the final configuration of funerary bundles that we documented in our ex­cavation resulted from a series of rearrangements carried out at different times during the long use history of the tomb. 
However, the interment sequence outlined above should be regarded as tentative largely due to the fact that delayed interment was commonly practiced in coastal Peru (Millaire 2002: 172; Shi­mada et al. 2004:384; Shimada et al. 2012) . The death of an individual, the preparation of the fu­nerary bundle , and its interment may each have been separated by considerable spans of time (Hertz 1960; Buikstra and Nystrom 2014). Bun­dles may not have been interred immediately after completion but placed on display (i.e., curated), for example, until a specific set of post-mortem rituals had been performed. If some bundles were brought to Pachacamac from distant locations, as discussed earlier, this would have added an additional element of temporal dis juncture. 
Throughout the prehispanic Central Andes, elites were often accompanied in death by sacri­ficed individuals (Benson and Cook 2001; Donnan and Cock 1997; Shimada et al. 2004). In this re­gard, some of the bundles in Group II may repre­sent persons sacrificed to accompany the elite in­dividual in Fardo B. However, we found no osteological evidence of violent or unnatural death. The analysis of C and N isotope ratios, mtDNA, and Sr isotopes shows that the people buried in Tomb 1-2 had varied diets, belonged to distinct haplogroups, and appear to have grown up in distinct areas (perhaps three) of the coast and highlands of central Peru. These findings are supported by unpublished ceramic analyses with Mossbauer spectroscopy, XRD, and INAAA (Knudson et al. 2008; Shimada et al. 2010; Takigami unpublished data). Thus, it appears that these individuals were brought in at different times from far-flung areas of the Y chsma territory, per­haps to accompany the elite Y chsma leader in Fardo B. The individual in Fardo B does not con­form to the traditional model of prolonged ances­tor worship. He did not seem to have had access to a better diet than other individuals in the tomb; rather, we suggest that he was a powerful indi­vidual whose influence extended to later periods.

Conclusions 
In this paper, we used systematic 14C dating of a group of intact funerary bundles at Pachacamac to define their age and depositional sequence, as well as to determine whether the bundles had been rewrapped as a sign of prolonged ancestor worship and care. The sequence in which the bundles were deposited, although tentative and approximate, does not support the hypothesis that the most elaborate and largest funerary bundle placed in the innermost area of the chamber, Fardo B, was the first to be deposited. The fact that the privileged location of Fardo B did not change even at the time that the latest group of bundles (Group III) was introduced to the tomb , however, suggests the respected status afforded to this individual and his continuing importance. 
Dates obtained from wrapping materials and soft tissue samples, corrected for the marine reser­voir effect using o13C and 015N values, generally agree well, indicating that no rewrapping of the bundles occurred. Radiocarbon dating of the wrapping materials shows that the funerary bun­dles spanned the initial Y chsma to early Inca oc­cupations (A.D. 1000 to the fifteenth century) , with the majority ofYchsma-period bundles dat­ing to the fourteenth century. Fardo B dates to the fourteenth century, as do many of the smaller bundles. The large size, mask painted with cinnabar, feather headdress, and high quality of wrappings and offerings placed inside all suggest that Fardo B contained a high-status individual, possibly a chief in this region; however, it seems that he was not the first to be placed in this tomb and, by extension, does not represent an "ancestor bundle." These dates also reveal that there was a considerable degree of mixing of bundles dating from different phases of the tomb chronology. It seems likely that bundles that were already in the tomb were moved around whenever a new bundle or a group of bundles was deposited. How­ever, it is important to remember that bundle preparation and its interment may have been sep­arated by a considerable span of time. 
Overall, our study has demonstrated the im­portance of systematic dating of varied, well-con­textualized samples in attempting to define the funerary customs, history, and social identities of individuals interred at the prominent prehis­
