COPPER EARRINGS IN LA ARAUCANIA: 
EARLIEST EVIDENCE OF METAL USAGE IN SOUTHERN CHILE 

C. Rodrigo Mera, Benoit Mille, Doina Munita, and Valentina Figueroa 
We report on the archaeometallurgical analysis of eight pieces of copper recovered from the Villa JMC-1 cemetery (Pitren Complex, Early Ceramic period) in the locality of Labranza, La Araucanfa. These artifacts provide the earliest evidence of metal use in southern Chile. They are also the southernmost prehispanic metal artifacts ever found in South America. These contextualized results complement those obtained from the analysis of an earring from Kil6metro 0-Enlace Temuco (El Verge! Complex, Late Ceramic period), an archaeological residential site dated to almost 500 years after the Labranza cemetery. Particle Induced X-ray Emission, X-ray radiography, and stereomicroscopy analyses allow us to offer an elemental characterization of the pieces, an assessment of their manufacturing process, and a comparison between the metals and 
alloys discovered. We follow with a discussion of proposals regarding cultural relations in the Araucanfa region during dif­ferent time periods. 
Los resultados obtenidos de los analisis arqueometalurgicos realizados a ocho piezas de cobre recuperadas en el cementerio Villa JMC-1 en la localidad de Labranza (Complejo Pitren,perfodo Alfarero Temprano ), han permitido describir las evidencias mas tempranas de la utilizaci6n de meta/es en el sur de Chile. Ademas, estos son los artefactos metalicos mas meridionales del extrema sur de America para el perfodo Prehispanico. Estos resultados se complementan con los obtenidos del analisis de un aro proveniente del sitio Kil6metro 0-Enlace Temuco (Complejo El Verge!, perfodo Alfarero Tardio). Los analisis rea­lizados (PIXE, rayos X radiograffa, estereomicroscopfa), nos permiten describir una caracterizaci6n elemental de las piezas, evaluar las tecnicas utilizadas en su proceso de manufactura y hacer una comparaci6n entre los meta/es y aleaciones hallados en los diferentes perfodos alfareros prehispanicos de la Araucanfa, estableciendo propuestas acerca de relaciones culturales.

Because no metal objects have been associated with the Pitren Complex prior to now, this dis­covery has provided insights into the earliest use of metalworking technology in the zone. Such insights can help us to better understand the social and symbolic significance of metal in funerary contexts among Formative-period groups in the south of Chile (Dillehay 1990).2 The initial iden­tification of the raw materials and manufacturing techniques was carried out by means of non-de­structive archaeometallurgical analyses, as these were considered the most suitable techniques for such unique pieces. These investigations yielded concrete results while ensuring the conservation of the artifacts. 
The Pitren Complex and 
Labranza Cemetery: Villa JMC-1 

Existing information about the Pitren Complex reveals the scarcity of occupational contexts and the prevalence of cemeteries dated to this period in southern Chile (Aldunate 1989; Dillehay 1990). Pitren cemeteries have been reported in the Cautfn, Tolten, and Valdivia river basins and at Lago Ranco, in some cases through excavation but primarily through studies of existing museum collections (Adan 2000; Adan and Alvarado 1999; Adan and Mera 1997, 2011; Gordon 1986; Menghin 1962; Ocampo et al. 2004). The Pitren Complex was spread over the Pacific Coast, the longitudinal valleys, and the lakes region on both sides of the Andean divide (Hajduk et al. 2007). 
The traditional chronology of the Pitren Com­plex places it between the first and the twelfth centuries A.D. and also includes an Oriental Phase (Aldunate 1989) or Late Pitren Lake Tra­dition (Reyes et al. 2004), which lasted until the sixteenth century. Although evidence of rock shelters and open-air camps has been found, re­cent systematic studies in the area of Lago Vil­larrica (Munita et al. 2010) have also led to the identification of a residential settlement in a for­est setting. This site, Flor del Lago 1 (Mera et al. 2011 ) , has produced a radiocarbon date that extends the age of this complex to around 2000 
B.P. (2110 ± 40 B.P.; 350-4 cal B.C. at 2a [Adan and Mera 2011]).3 
The Villa JMC-1 site was discovered during the construction of a public housing complex. After an initial reconnaissance visit, it was iden­tified as a cemetery associated with the Pitren Complex. After three seasons of archaeological excavations and simultaneous monitoring of the

construction work, the cemetery was found to cover an area of around 700 m2 and to contain at least 43 well-defined tombs, as well as 10 other locations with finds. In all, close to 190 ceramic and I 00 stone artifacts were recovered from the site. The bioanthropological analysis determined a minimum of 22 individuals in a poor state of preservation. Tombs 15 and 45 at the Villa JMC­
1 Labranza cemetery were radiocarbon dated to between 1100 and 800 B .P. ( 1060 ± 40 B .P.; Beta­241265; wood charcoal; cal A.D. 892-1028 at 2a; and 900 ± 30 B.P.; Beta-296450; wood char­coal; cal A.D. 1039-1210 at 2a). 
Particular finds recorded as part of the funerary context included monospecific ritual burning 
( Gevuina avellana, Aristotelia chilensis, Nothofa­gus obliqua-alpina) associated with some tombs and a paleosurface of volcanic origin with conti­nental plant remains as a base occupational stratum. Notable elements found among the offerings in­clude complete vessels with amphibian, animal, and human shapes and a variety of stone artifacts and instruments, including a stemmed obsidian projectile point, necklace beads made of lutite, and others of Pacific scallop shells (from the Pecten genus of bivalves) strung together with twisted cords of a plant fiber similar to hemp (Bracchitta and Seguel 2009). Also recovered was a portion of textile made of camelid fiber corresponding to Lama pacos .4 Several of these new contributions have helped establish the importance that these groups assigned to the Andean mountain environ­ment (e.g., as a source of lithic raw materials). 
In addition to the aforementioned artifacts, the site also contained the first known evidence of copper ornaments in a Pitren Complex archaeo­logical site. These have been identified as earrings owing to their position in the tombs, south of the 
funerary features, in accordance with the Pitren mortuary pattern. Some of them (as is the case with the pair of spiral earrings found in Tomb 5 and C2RMF67525) were found in direct associ­ation with the so-called "stone pillows," polished round stones positioned in the area of the head of the deceased and possibly used to fix his head and gaze. Given their shape, some can be clearly identified as earrings, while others, particularly 

the ring-shaped ones, are more questionable in appearance and could well have been nose rings or other items of jewelry. 
Due to the antibacterial properties of copper, some soft tissue that came into contact with the ornaments also has been preserved. Investigation of the organic remains found on C2RMF67524 (ring-shaped ornament) under a microscope at the Centro de Conservaci6n y Restauraci6n (CNCR) in Santiago confirmed that fibers closely associated with the soft tissue were of animal ori­gin, while the tissue itself displayed features sim­ilar to human skin. Given this association and their position in the tomb, the organic remains found on C2RMF67524 may correspond to hu­man hair (Bracchitta and Segue! 2009). Additional organic evidence, found under the copper item associated with Tomb 23 (circular, not subjected to analysis), corresponds to a fragment of human bone, probably the auditory meatus (Bracchitta and Segue! 2009), which would confirm the item as an earring.
