Excavations at Abreu Garcia provide a detailed case study of a mound and enclosure mortuary complex used by the southern proto-Jê in the southern Brazilian highlands. The recovery of 16 secondary cremation deposits within a single mound allows an in-depth discussion of spatial aspects of mortuary practices.

he deadoffera windowintothe history of the individual and the community because of the encoding of fundamental social institutions into mortuary practices. The patterns and variability of mortuary treatments re.ectthesocioreligious beliefsofacommunity, which delineate conceptions of the dead. But they may also re.ect the social identity of an individual as de.nedby theform and organiza­tionof social systems(Binford 1971;Dillehay 1995;O’Shea1984;Pearson1999;Tainter1978; Tarlow and Stutz2013). 
In southernBrazil, modernsouthernJêgroups are characterizedbyasocialorganizationrevolv­ing around dual, exogamous, asymmetrical, patrilineal moieties. All people, objects, and natural phenomena are divided between the two moieties as dual oppositions. Public events overtly emphasize moiety membership through visual symbols and the performance of speci.c tasks. Funeraryritual,in particular,re.ectsthis system,withburials conscriptedas community-wide integrativeeventsthat reinforcesocial hier­archy, the dual organization of the group, and the individual’s social identity (Baldus 1937; Crépeau 1994;Métraux1946;Nimuendajú1993 [1913];Veiga 2006). 
Althoughweneedtobeawareofthe potential differences between the earlier archaeological contexts and those reported during the seven­teenth through twentieth centuries, especially in the face of European colonization of the region, there are general ideological and struc­turalarrangementsthat appeartobeconstantover time.AstheworkofIriarteand coauthors(2013) has shown,itis possibletointerpret thehighly structured archaeological patterns of southern proto-Jê mound and enclosure complexes(here­afterMECs)through reasoned analogiesfromthe ethnohistorical and ethnographic record, draw­ing on the historical continuity that exists in the organization of ritual space. In particular, records of highly structured, spatially de.ned ritual activity in the funerary landscape and ethnographically documented useofmounds for theintermentofthe deceasedbymodernsouthern Jê groups provide a rich source of analogical information. 
The southern proto-Jê employed MECs as funerary monuments to bury the cremated remains of select members of the community circa A.D. 1000–1700. Recent excavations at Abreu Garcia, an MEC near Campo Belo do Sul, SantaCatarina state,inuse from themid­.fteenth centurytothe late seventeenth(Table1; Figure1), suggestthat dual social organization waswellestablishedandanintegral featureofthe funerarylandscape, manifesting acrossmultiple spatial levels of (1) a paired MEC, (2) twin mounds within an MEC, and (3) the internal division of the mounds.

ModernJêOrganization and Mortuary Practice 
The prevalence of dual social organization has been documented ethnographically throughout South America, with an increasing number of examples from archaeological contexts (Horn­borg 1988; Lévi-Strauss 1944; Moore 1995; Nimuendajú and Lowie 1937; Turner 1996; Zuidema 1964). That the moiety system is ancient among the southern branch of the Jê family is attested by the fact that it is found in virtually all northern Jê societies in central Braziland among someof theirMacro-Jê neigh­bors(Maybury-Lewis 1979). TheJê linguistic family was .rst recognized in the nineteenth century(Martius 1867).Together witha num­ber of smaller families, it is now considered part of a broader Macro-Jê stock, one of the largest of South America (Davis 1966, 1968; Ribeiro 2006; Rodrigues 1999). Notable mem­bersof the Macro-Jê stock include theBororo, Kayapó, Xavante, and other central Brazilian peoples whose dualorganizationwasafocusof anthropological studies in the 1960s (Maybury-Lewis 1979). Beyond the southern highlands, Jê speakers are distributed over a vast territory

of the central Brazilian cerrados (savannas), an area of high ethnolinguistic diversity where the homeland of this family is thought to lie. Glottochronological estimates place the initial split of theJêlanguages around 3000 B.P.,the southernbranchbeingthe.rsttodiverge (Urban 1992). The two remaining modern southern Jê groups, the Kaingang and the Xokleng, also exhibit dual organization. The moiety system of the Kaingang is rooted in the lineages orig­inating from two mythological twin brothers, Kamé and Kairu(Veiga 1994). In theKaingang origin myth,afteracataclysmic .ood, Kamé and Kairuindependently createdallbeingsof nature, setting the stage for a dually divided world in which everything is assigned to one brother or

the other in an all-encompassing classi.catory system (Borba 1908;Nimuendajú1993 [1913]). Before thebrothersascended into the heavens as the Sun (Kamé) and Moon (Kairu), theydictated theorderby whichsocietyshouldbestructured, establishing the division into complementary moietiesaswellasthe rulesfor moiety recruit­ment through patrilineal descent andexogamous marriage. Thebrotherslend their names and their associated traits to the two moieties. Kamé is associated with the Sun, west, day, thick body, high, persistence, and permanence, while Kairu is associated with east, Moon, night, slim body, low, impermanence, and transformation (Silva 2002). The mythology points toward a comple­mentarybut asymmetrical relationship, with the successesofKamé contrastingwiththeimperfect and un.nished attempts of Kairu. Possessing stronger souls, members of the Kamé moiety can demand more lavish ritual and privileged locations, such as higher elevations (Crépeau 1994, 2002;Veiga 2006). 
TheXokleng (morerecently self-identi.ed as the Laklãnõ) are divided into three exogamous patrilineal clans called Mê-vidn, Mê-calêbn, and Mê-kúi-ken. As Métraux (1946) showed, however,this systemwasoriginallydual,withthe .rst clan (Mê-vidn) corresponding to theKairu moietyoftheKaingangandthesecond clan(Mê­kúi-ken) being equivalent to the Kamé moiety. Thefunctionof the thirdclanispredominantly ceremonial, and membership is not necessarily inherited (Silva 2001;Veiga 1994). Modern anthropological studies document a Xokleng culture that has undergone radical social transfor­mationinthefaceof near ethnocideintheearly twentieth century(e.g.,Cruz Conceiçáo 2015; Henry 1964;Hoffman2010;Santos1973;Urban 1978, 1985;Wiik and Mota2014). Dispossessed of theirland, previously sedentary communities were forced into smaller, mobile groups (Henry 1964; Loch 2004; Noelli 2000), resulting in social, economic, subsistence, political, and ritual adaptation to a new way of life. Modern accounts of the Xokleng are therefore particu­larly problematic for analogical application to archaeological contexts (Noelli 2000), and as such this paper reliesondata fromthe Kaingang. 
Mortuary rituals associated with mound buildingbythe southernJêhave been recorded in European accounts since the seventeenth century (Baldus 1937; Becker 1976; Crépeau 1994;Henry1964;Maniser1930;Métraux1946; Nimuendajú 1993 [1913]; Paula 1924;Veiga 2000,2006).Thepracticeofinterringin mounds continuedintothetwentieth century. Ceremonies at mounds were themostimportant ritual prac­tices for the community and were public events that speci.cally emphasized the dual organiza­tionof the group (Baldus 1937;Crépeau 1994; Métraux 1946;Nimuendajú1993 [1913];Veiga 2006). Both halves have integral roles to play in the structure of public ceremony. Moiety af.liation is marked through body ornamenta­tion: members of the Kamé moiety paint their bodies with black stripes, lines, and open shapes usingburned pine chips(Araucaria angustifolia [Bertol.]Kuntze),whereas Kairumembers paint red circles and closed shapes using Symplocos parvifolia (DaSilva 2011).During theKaingang kiki funeraryritual,the ceremonyinthe cemetery adheres to an organized east-west spatial and conceptualdivision (Crépeau 1994;Veiga2000). For example, two .res are lit, one in the east for Kairu, and one in the west for Kamé. The eventsalso demonstratethe complementarityof the moiety system; each .re and the accom­panying prayers may only be performed by membersofthe opposite moiety(DaSilva 2011; Veiga 2006). 


Archaeologyof the SouthernProto-Jê 
Southern proto-Jê culture covered a vast area (more than 600 km north-south) encompassing diverseenvironments acrossthe southernhigh­landsand Atlantic forestofthemodernBrazilian states of southern São Paulo, Paraná, Santa Catarina, and RioGrande do Sul and Misiones province,Argentina.Thehighland plateau(700– 1,850masl)is dominatedby mixed Araucaria forest and high-altitude grasslands (Campos de Cimada Serra)(Klein 1975). 
Ancestraltothemodernspeakersofthe south­ernbranchoftheJêlanguagefamily,and sharing abroadly de.ned material culture known as the Taquara/ItararéTradition, thesouthernproto-Jê are characterized by the use of diagnostic small, thin-walled ceramic vessels, pithouses, MECs, and rock art (e.g., Araújo 2007; Beber 2005; 

Downloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core. YBP Library Services, on 22 Aug 2018 at 17:08:33, subject to the Cambridge Core terms of use, available at https://www.cambridge.org/core/terms. https://doi.org/10.1017/laq.2017.11 
De Masi 2009;Iriarte et al.2013;Noelli2005; Riris and Corteletti 2015). The territorial extent of theTaquara/ItararéTradition—covering most of the southern Brazilian highlands, adjacent escarpment, and parts of the Atlantic coast— coincides with thehistorical distributionof the Kaingangand Xokleng(DaSilva 2001;Jolkesky 2010;Noelli2005).Beyondthespatialoverlap, the datesof occupationof manyTaquara/Itararé sites continue into the early colonial period, and thereiscontinuityin material culture (ceramics), burial practices (earthen mounds), and decorative motifs in rock art and ceramics between the precolonial Taquara/Itararé Tradition and the historical Kaingang and Xokleng (Da Silva 2001). For those reasons, most archaeologists agreein attributingtheTaquara/Itararé material culture to the ancestors of the extinct Kimdá and Ingáin groups and the direct ancestors of modernKaingang and Xokleng (Jolkesky 2010). Following that reasoning, and to emphasize the continuity, in this paper we refer to the Taquara/Itararégroups as thesouthernproto-Jê. These communitiespracticedamixed economy, which combined harvestingtheParaná pine nut 
(A. angustifolia), hunting,gathering, and .shing with the cultivation of domestic crops. From a pithouse context, recent microbotanical studies have documented the consumption of manioc (Manihot esculenta Crantz), beans(Phaseolus sp.),maize(Zea mays L.),and squash(Cucurbita sp.), implying a degree of sedentary farming (Corteletti et al. 2015). 
TheTaquara/ItararéTraditionbeganto spread after A.D. 1, reaching new levels of regional organization and political complexity around 
A.D. 
1000 (Iriarte et al. 2013). The .rst major earthworks, in the form of domestic pithouses, begin to appear circa A.D. 400. Pithouses range in size from 2 to 20 m in diameter and range from solitary pits to clustered “villages” containing more than 100 structures. Around 

A.D. 
1000, oversized pithouses and MECs begin to appear on the landscape (Copé 2006; Corteletti 2012;Iriarte et al.2013;Schmitz et al. 2013). Interestingly, pollenrecords document an expansion of Araucaria forest coinciding with these innovations (Behling 1995, 1998; Biten­court and Kraspenhar 2006;Iriarte and Behling 2007). 


Mound and EnclosureComplexes 
MECs are funerary monuments, occurring in isolation and in groups, concentrated along the Pelotas and Canoas river basins and typically occupying themostprominent hilltops with wide viewsheds (Corteletti 2012;Corteletti et al.2015; De Masi 2009). Just over 50 MECs have been documented, althoughfewhave beenexcavated (Beber 2005; Chmyz 1968; Copé et al. 2002; Corteletti 2012;DeMasi 2005; De Souza and Copé 2010;De Souza et al.2016;Herberts and Müller 2007; Iriarte et al. 2008, 2010, 2013; Müller 2008; Naue et al. 1989;Reis 2007; Ribeiro and Ribeiro 1985;Rohr1971; Schmitz etal. 2010).PublisheddatesofMECsarelimited, with the earliest dated to circaA.D. 1000 (Posto FiscalandSC-AG-75)andanabundanceof dates inthe.fteenththroughseventeenth centuries(see Iriarte et al. 2013;Iriarte et al.2016). 
The complexes are characterized by circu­lar, elliptical, rectangular, and keyhole-shaped earthworks surrounding one or more earthen mounds. Both raised rings and ditches were used as the encircling earthworks. Raised rings are up to 1 m high, 6 m wide, and 10–180 m in diameter. Ditches are typically shallow and narrow. More complex features,including entry avenues and attached ringlets, such as thoseatEl Dorado, Misiones,Argentina(Iriarteetal. 2008, 2010) and SC-CL-37 in Santa Catarina (Reis 2007), are occasionally present. The mounds themselves arepredominantly circular,although thereare rectangularexamples (e.g., SC-AG-12; De Masi 2009). Whenasinglemoundis present, it occupies the center of the enclosure. Two mounds typically follow a dual architecture pat­tern of distinctly different sizes on a southwest-to-northeastalignment,with thelarger structure inahigher elevationtothe northeast(see Iriarte et al. 2013). Iriarteet al.(2013)argue that such MECs demonstrate a high level of spatial orga­nization, where paired complexes of distinctly different sizes represent a dual ranked social structure. 
The mounds are funerary, containing single and multiple crematedburials.Inafewinstances, excavation has determined that a mound was erected on topof the cremationpyre(De Masi 2009; De Souza and Copé 2010), although in most instances the cremation was transported

fromanoff-site funeralpyre (Copé and Saldanha 2002;DeMasi 2009;De Souza and Copé2010; Müller 2008; Müller and Mendonça de Souza 2011). The most common grave goods, when present, are small ceramic vessels (rim diameter nolargerthan15cm), possiblyrepresentingfood and drink offerings. 


AbreuGarciaSite and Excavations 
The Abreu Garcia site is located on an elon­gated basaltic plateau with commanding views acrossthe surrounding landscape(Figure1).The archaeological site is on the northwestern edge of the plateau, consisting of two MECs and a solitary pithouse(Figure2). MEC1 is the larger of the two. It incorporates a primary central mound and a secondary small mound to the northwest, both within an enclosure. The 
0.4m high, circular enclosing earthworkis50m in diameter and 4 m wide. The central mound (MoundA)measures10mindiameterand0.8m in height.The smallermound (MoundB),tothe northwest,measures4 min diameterand0.2m in height.MEC2is much smaller, consistingof asinglemound within an enclosingditch anda small bank measuring10 min diameter.There is a single central mound (Mound C), 0.4 m in height and 5 m in diameter. The pithouse, measuring 5 m in diameter, is located 200 m along theplateau to the north.Each structureis in alignment, positioned closetothe edgeof the plateau.Astone chapelisarecent additiontothe landscape. No further structures havebeen found on theplateau. 
In 2014,a2 × 5munitrunning paralleltothe plateau’sedgewasexcavatedonthe northeastern half of Mound A of MEC1. The recovery of cremated deposits promptedasecondexcavation in 2015. Excavations were also undertaken in Mound B of MEC1 and Mound C of MEC2. Test pitting was carried out on the enclosure rings, the inter-mound areas, and the internal off-mound space. Osteological analysis of the cremated remainsisina preliminary stage. As such, this paper focuses on spatial aspects of the mortuary context. In-.eld observation of MNI (minimum number of individuals), age, and faunal inclusions shows variability across contexts that does not appear to re.ect prescribed practicesof thesocial system and therefore does notaffect theinterpretations presented here. 
MEC1—MoundA 
Excavation over the two seasons con.rmed the presence of two construction phases(Figure3). The mound was constructed on the original ground surface, 20–30 cm above bedrock. The initial mound construction, consisting of a largely sterile clay matrix (Munsell 5YR 3/4), wascappedbyalayerofdegraded yellowbasalt. Ourexcavationshave encountered similar basalt caps de.ning construction phasesin bothmound and pithouse architecture in the Campo Belo region. A second construction phase expanded the mound with the addition of a coarser red sandy clay matrix from a distinctly different source (Munsell2.5YR 3/6). 
Sixteen secondary cremation deposits were encountered acrossthetwo yearsof excavations in MEC1, with a spatial separation between the northeastern and southwestern halvesparalleling thedirectionofthe edgeof theplateau(Figure4). Nine cremation deposits (Clusters 1–9) were recoveredinthe southwest and seven(Clusters 10–16)inthe northeast.Thesegregationishigh­lighted by the absence of deposits along the central axis andbyadistinct difference between the two sides in burial contexts, with those in the southwest subject to more formal inter-ment.The basalt cap also remainslargelyintact along the central axis, but is broken or absent above all cremation deposits except Cluster 
16. The broken cap suggests these 15 deposits were later additions made by reentering the mound after the construction of the cap, with Cluster16 potentially representing an early (or initial) burial as part of the original mound construction. 
The seven cremation deposits in the north­eastern half are located throughout the body of the mound below the level of the basalt cap. The interments include both well-de.ned and scattered deposits.Bioturbation alone does not appear to account for the difference in the concentration of the deposits because it is limited, with major root disturbance primarily located above the basalt cap. Themorescattered cremation deposits do not show clear evidence of dispersalfromanoriginal concentration, with

In comparisontotheintermentsofthe north­east, the nine cremation deposits in the south­western half are spatially distinct and decidedly more formal. Eight of the deposits are located in four bedrock cut pits, while the ninth is placed abovethe basalt cap associated with stone gravearchitecture. Thefour pits areina linear arrangement(Figure6a), parallelingthe edgeof theplateau to the northeast and emphasizingthe internal mound division. The basaltlayer above thepitswasfragmentary, suggestingthat some, ifnotall,ofthepits were entered afterthe second constructionphaseofthemound.PitsB,C,andD all contained single cremated deposits, whereas .ve separate cremated contexts were placed in PitA(Figure6b) alongside a single complete incised ceramic vessel. 
Overlapping material between all contexts in Pit A (Clusters 2, 6, 7, 8, and 9) suggests that the .ve deposits are from a single interment event and thepitwassealed witha cap that pre­vented sediment penetration, allowing time for thecremation containerstodisintegrate and the contained materialto spread.The ceramicvessel, athin-walled cup with zigzag incised decoration (Figure6c), appearstohave been depositedasa separate event sometime after the interment of thecremation deposits.Thevesselsits on2 cm of sedimentbuildup above the collapsed spread of Cluster9andtheedgeofthespillfrom Cluster 7, implying that enough time had passedfor the cremation containers to disintegrate before the ceramicwasdeposited.Eachofthe.vecremated depositsin PitAshowed distinct characteristics, enabling separation of the contexts.

A constructed wall separates Pit C from Pit D(Figure6d), with skeletal material from Pit C spread beneath the wall. As such, the wall postdates theinterment of Cluster4and is most likelyafeaturethatwas added at thesame time as Cluster3 to maintain spatialseparationafter PitC was cut. 
Just as the bedrock cut pits mark an interment choice distinct from the choices marked by the cremation deposits in the main body of the mound in the northeast, Cluster 1 also differs from the other locations as the only interment placed above the basalt cap. Cluster 1 also contains formal stone architecture(Figure7). Clusters 1 and 16 are the only contexts that include dentition. 
A deposit of charcoal was present in the southern halfoftheexcavation unit.

MEC1—EnclosureRim 
A1 × 10 m trench excavation was under­taken across the outer rim with the aim of understanding form and construction history. The continuous circular rim showed a single construction phase, unlike the mounds. A total of 13 ceramic sherds were found between 10 and 40 cm depth, located in the bank or immediately on the outer side. The excavated area between themounds and therimwasdevoidof artifacts. This positioning suggests that at least some of the material represents the remains of activities performed atop themound and discardedoffthe back, perhaps with deliberate clearance of theinner enclosure.A separate4 × 1 m trench inside theMEC1 enclosurerecovered zeroarti­facts, further suggestingthat theinternal enclo­surewaskept cleanof debris. 
MEC2 
MoundC of the smallerMEC2 revealedasin­gle construction phase. A 2 × 2 m unit was established over the center of the mound, with an8 × 1 m trench extending off the northwest side, acrossthe interiorofthe enclosure, through the encircling ditch and terrace toward MEC1. Alow-density scattering of bone fragments was present in the eastern corner of the excavation between20and30cm belowthemodernground surface; nevertheless, no distinct clustering or concentrationwas present.Two ceramic sherds were present within the mound .ll(density = 1.67/m3). Eight ceramic sherds found in the trench within the enclosure(density = 7.92/m3) lack distinct contextual information but may be vestiges of activities performed within the enclosureormayhave been swept from atop the mound. Although stillinsmall numbers,thepres­ence of material within the enclosure contrasts with MEC1,whichwaskept perfectly clean. 
External Area. A3 × 2mexcavationwas estab­lishedtotestthearea betweenMEC1andMEC2. Thirty1 × 1mtest units(notshownonmap) were dug in the southern sector outside of MEC1 to sampleatotal areaof180m2.Interestingly,the highest densityof ceramic material acrossthe site was encountered within these areas (density = 10.83/m3). The quantity of ceramics is distinct from the limited material in the internal area of MEC1 and hints at less-controlled activity outside of the enclosure. No other material or features were recorded.

although they are distinct in terms of form, interments, and associated activities. Mound A of MEC1 is particularly interesting, revealing two construction phases andahistoryof reentry, with the interment of 16 cremation deposits. Most startlingisthe distinct difference between the two sides of the mound interior, aligned to the plateau’s edge, adding yet another level of dualism to the paired MECs and twin mounds of MEC1. 


Discussion 
In thediscussion that follows we draw parallels between thearchaeologyof thesouthernproto-Jê and the sociopolitical organization of the southern Jê Kaingang groups. The comparison serves as a point of departure to explore the historical continuityof general underlyingideo­logical and structural arrangements that have survivedovertime. Nonetheless,weareawareof the pitfalls associated with direct transposition of theethnographicpresent into thearchaeolog­ical record. From here on we refer to Alpha and Beta moieties, rather than the Kamé and Kairumoieties,tofacilitate discussionandavoid implying direct association through the use of Kaingang terminology. Alpha represents the more dominant moiety. 
DualisminSite Plan 
Iriarte et al. (2013) argue for a pattern of dual social organizationinthe southernproto-Jê funerary landscape, noting the common occur­rence of paired MECs. Paired complexes are asymmetric, with the larger complex almost always occupying a slightly higher topographic position, typically to the southwest, in a southwest-northeastalignment.These character­istics correlate with the associations attached to the dominant Kamé moiety of theKaingang (Crépeau 1994, 2002, 2005;Iriarte et al. 2013; Silva 2002;Veiga 1994, 2000). 
The southwest-northeast arrangement is par­ticularly apparent in Pinhal da Serra, where .ve of the six paired structures follow the pattern (Iriarte et al. 2013). The main structure of site PM-01inMisiones also contained twomounds with marked disparities in size, the larger of which was located to the west (Iriarte et al. 
2008). The architectural placement corresponds to the shadow alignment of sunrise during the winter solstice and sunset during the summer solstice,whichcouldrepresentanearly reference to the Sun and Moon as embodied by Kamé and KairuinKaingang. It is perhaps of signi.­cancethatanineteenth-century account mentions that the shadow of an upright arrow was used bytheKaingangtoalignthebodyofthe deceased (Mabilde 1983). 
Deviations from the southwest-northeast pat­tern can be explained by other landscape fea­tures, such as plateau orientation and topography superseding thedirectional layout.The distinct plateau of AbreuGarciais one such deviation, withtheAlphaMEC(MEC1) occupyingahigher positiontothe northeast and bothMEC and the pithouse paralleltothe edgeof theplateau, sug­gesting that viewshed and landscape symmetry were more important criteria than directional layout.Itisimportant to notethat the opposition between high and lowplaces is more important in modern Kaingang cemeteries than the east-west division (Crépeau 1994, 2002). SC-CL­94 (Schmitz et al. 2010), another paired MEC over50kmfromPinhalda Serra,alsodeviates fromthe southwest-northeast pattern,raising the possibility that the feature may be a localized traditioninthe Pinhalda Serra region. 
Whether the paired structures were reserved for,or controlledby,therelevant moiety,orifthe structures werearepresentationofcosmological structure and usedby thewhole community,is dif.cult to discern with the limited excavated samples. In a paired complex at SC-AG-12, De Masi (2005, 2006, 2009) documented the crematedburialofan adultandaninfant, accom­panied by a well-preserved, complete ceramic plate and cup in the central mound of the larger enclosure. Six collectivecrematedburials were recovered in the smaller MEC. Based on thisevidence,De Masi(2009)positedthat the two individuals in the larger enclosure had a higher status than the multiple burials in the smaller enclosure, with the funerary landscape re.ecting societal divisions. At Abreu Garcia, MEC2 contrasts with MEC1 in terms of form, interments, and artifact distribution. Thesmaller and topographically lowerMEC2 contains only ascattering of bone in themoundbuta higher

density of ceramics within the enclosure, sug­gestingdifferencesin ritual practice,at least.The difference between the enclosingditchofMEC2 and the ring of MEC1 is another disparity and may re.ect moiety-speci.c architectural styles. 
DualisminMaterials. Althoughagreater den­sity of ceramic material was recovered from MEC2 than MEC1, the only distinctly interred offerings were the vessels recovered from the southwestern half of MEC1. These vessels are strikingly similar in form to the ceramic cups retrieved from other MECs (De Masi 2005; Müller 2008; Rohr 1971; Saldanha 2005). The bandof zigzag decorationonthe cup from PitA is comparable, in particular, to the ceramic cup fromthe mound of thelarger enclosure atSC-AG-12(De Masi 2009; Figure8). Here again, it is enlightening to compare the archaeological data with the ethnographic record. Among the historical Kaingang, the same design style was used in the body painting of the Kamé moiety (DaSilva 2001),and the equivalent Xokleng clan used similar linear decorations (Métraux 1946). These designs werein oppositiontothe dotsand circleswornby the other Kaingang moiety and Xokleng clan.

the moiety system. Possessions of the deceased arebroken and includedin theburial; petsmay even be sacri.ced so that the dead do not return, seeking what is theirs (Veiga 2000). This last point is particularly pertinent considering the presenceof animal bonesmixedwith humaninat leastsomeofthe cremation deposits as observed in the .eld. 
DualisminInternal Mound Space 
Perhaps the most intriguing feature at Abreu Garcia is thedistinct disparity between the north­eastern and southwestern halves of Mound A. The division is epitomized by the absence of cremated deposits along the centerline of the mound and thestark contrast between theformal bedrock cut pitsofthesouthwestern halfand the dispersed interments in the northeast. As well as a distinction made by the formality of the bedrock pits,avertical spatialdivision between thetwo halvesisfurther emphasizedby Cluster 1inthe southwestern half being the only deposit positioned above the basalt cap. 
The spatial division (and the alignment of the bedrock pits) parallels the alignment of the threestructures at AbreuGarcia, whichinturn parallels the edgeof theplateau. Although there have been relatively few excavations elsewhere inthesouthernBrazilianhighlands,weknowthat the split into a southwest and a northeast half is analogous to the arrangement of other paired MECs, with the more extravagant offerings and themoreformalintermentsinthe western por­tion, equating to the Alpha moiety (De Masi 2009). Likewise,the smallermound (MoundB) ofMEC1 does not containanycentralinterments, with thetwo cremation deposits bothlocated in thewestern halfofthe mound. 
Thewhole complexat AbreuGarciamay thus represent threelevelsofintegrated dual organi­zation, manifestingin(1)the pairedMEC,(2)the twin mounds within MEC1, and (3)the internal division of the mounds. The multiple levels of dualism are both overt and subtle, perhaps sym­bolizing the cohesive and mutually dependent nature of the moiety system. Alternatively, the apparent dualismmay re.ect subdivisions within moieties, enmeshing multiple levels of hierarchy and social division within spatial aspects of mortuarypractice. 
Grave Architecture 
Architectureislimitedtothree stone associations and the bedrock pits. The four pits dug into bedrock in the southwestern half of Mound A clearly show a distinct pattern in comparison to the other interments, requiring the concerted decision to excavate into the hard basalt rather thanstopandplacetheburialatopitasinthe case of Cluster 16. This marked distinction, located in the west, correlates with the associations of the Alpha moiety. 
The stone additions to Clusters 1, 10, and 12 take different forms. The stone slabs of Cluster 1 contrast with the single rectangu­lar cap of the well-de.ned Cluster 12 and the loose pebble accumulation associated with thespreadof Cluster 10.In thesethree cases the type of stone association mimics the dispersal of the cremation deposit, whereby the more tightly clustered cremation deposits have a clear and direct stone association, and the loosely clustered cremation deposit is associated with a loose concentration of stones, although there are not enough examples to con.rm a pattern. Stone architecture accompanying mound inter­ments has been documented elsewhere, including bothlarge slabs (Borba 1908)and smallerrock concentrations (Müller 2008). The reasoning behind the presence or absence of architecture in these cases is also ambiguous. The more formal architecture of all the interments of the southwestern half does offerfurther supportfor the interpretation that this side and the more elaborateburialriteswerereservedfor theAlpha moiety. 
Hierarchy 
Ethnographic accounts of Kaingang funerary mounds indicate that the burial of chiefs and the accompanying ceremonies passed chie.y of.ce to their successors; interment of other high-status individuals and actors with speci.c social rolesisalso noted (DaSilva 2001;Man­iser 1930; Métraux 1946;Veiga 2006). Larger Xokleng mounds were also reserved for high-status individuals(Vasconcellos 1912). Among the Kaingang, only the death of a paramount chief required the construction of a new mound (Mabilde 1983). Interestingly, collective burial in mounds for warriors who died in battle was

reported in the nineteenth century (Mabilde 1983). These mounds were built side by side, with individual mounds reserved for deceased chiefs. 
MECs certainly did not accommodate the remainsof the whole community, and thepres­tige associated with commanding ceremonies at a prominent public landmark such as Abreu Garcia was likely reserved for higher-status individuals or those associated with speci.c social functions. Although multiple individuals aresometimes present withinasinglecremation deposit, the core of each deposit appears to have been conspicuously separate. This is made apparent by the distinctly different material of each deposit in Pit A and the reconstruction of the wall separating Pit C and Pit D. While thetreatmentof each context asa distinct entity is perhaps not surprising, it does reveal con­ceptualizations of the sacred and profane and indicates an inherent respect for the remains of the deceased. 
The dual organization existent among many lowland South American societies has been hypothesized to favor the development of inequality,withthemoieties becomingasymmet­ricalover time(Spencer and Redmond 2015).In fact,asthe classicalworkof Lévi-Strauss(1963) .rst pointed out, dualistic ideologies usually maskasubjacent asymmetrical structure. Thisis manifest in theKaingang moiety system:Kamé burialgroundsareplacedinhigher positions,and they are considered ritually “stronger”(Crépeau 1994, 2002). 
Bone Removal. The absenceof dentitioninall but two contexts at the complex suggests a practice of selective bone collection from the pyre,with some material either separated foruse or curation elsewhereor abandoned at thepyre site. No pyre location has been discovered to date, makingitimpossibletoassess whether teeth were left at the cremation site; nor has skeletal material been encountered in other contexts, whichwould con.rmaseparate caching practice. Archaeological and ethnographic data regarding practices of bone removal for the southern Jê arescant.Borba’s(1908)ethnographic account notes the removal of the cranium for burial within cemeteries or mounds in Paraná. De Masi’s(2005)archaeological analysis indicates that teeth were present for the two cremated individuals in a mound at SC-AG-12, dated to the.fteenth century.Teethwerealsoreportedby Müller(2008)for a crematedburial atSC-AG­
108. Cranial fragments, including mandible and maxilla fragments, were present in the deposits at Abreu Garcia, con.rming that crania were not removed. Teeth will often pop out during the cremation .re, and the small size of the individual teethmayexplainwhysome were not collected with therestofthe bone; nevertheless, the durability of teeth and their distinctiveness wouldsuggestthat their absencewasabehavioral choice. 
Thelackof detailregarding elementsofskele­talrecovery such as teethat other sitesprevents substantivediscussion at this time, although the absenceof teethin14of16intermentsinMound A may represent a localized tradition. Perhaps of relevance, Henry(1964)explicitly notes the bad dentition of the modern southern Jê he studied, further recording thatin theirmythology many malevolent supernaturals were explicitly characterized with good teeth as a sign of their corrupt power. Whether the removal of teeth from the burial contexts is an early concept of profanity associated with dentition has yet to be determined. Ongoing osteological analysis is assessing whether certain bones, or types of bone, were preferentially collected or avoided, and whether any pattern correlated with social organization exists. 
Variability in CremationDeposits 
Despite the spatial division within the mound, a degree of variability in the characteristics of the cremated deposits precludes the identi.ca­tionoffurther mortuaryritesspeci.c to moiety attachment or social role. Variation in grave architecture, number of individuals, presence of faunal bones, and absence of speci.c bones lacks distinct spatial patterning. Although thelocation of the interment within the mound and, to a certain extent, the degree of formality in the burial maybeindicativeof the Alpha and Beta moieties, the variability and overlap in the char­acteristics of the individual cremation deposits appear to reveal either (1) a nonstandardized

cremationpracticethat does not represent com­munity structure; (2) rites that were in .ux, lacking codi.cation for an extended period; or 
(3) personal associations that supplant general­ized social categories, with the deceased’s more nuanced identity re.ected in mortuary rites. A combination of these factors is perhaps most likely, with certain aspects of mortuary ritual considered mandatory and other aspects being optional or non-codi.ed. 
Chronology. Chronological changeinritualover the 170-year span of radiocarbon dates from MoundA(Table1)may account forsome of the variability among cremation deposits. The chronological relationships among the bedrock pits are particularly interesting. The post­depositional stratigraphicrelationshipofthecon­tainer collapseinPitAcon.rms that theremains were deposited in a single event within the sealed pit, but did the individuals die at the same time?Were theycremated at thesame time (albeitindifferentpyres)?Orweretheycurated until the burial event? Despite the similarities among the four pits, the stratigraphic relation­ship between Pit C, Pit D, and the constructed wall impliesa chronological separation between the two interment events. More re.ned dating may help tease out the relationships among the cremated deposits, although the error ranges in radiometric dating, old wood issues, and prob­lems with dating cremated bone could easily obscure and con.ate separate interment events overthe relatively shortspanof occupation. 


Summary and Conclusions 
AbreuGarciaprovidesa detailed casestudyof a mound and enclosure mortuary complex used by the southern proto-Jê. The discovery of 16 cremation deposits within Mound A allows an in-depthdiscussionof mortuarypracticewithina singlemonument.MEC1wasbuiltintwophases. The initial construction included the enclosure rim and the two basalt-capped mounds. After thesecond construction phase, multiple reentries that deposited cremations continued the active use of the mound. Throughout its history, a distinct separation between two halves of the moundwasrespected—adivisionthat paralleled the direction of the edge of the plateau. The smallermoundof MEC1,MoundB, lackedany central deposits, potentially also followingadual separation. Contrasting practices at the single­phaseMEC2 maybeamonumental re.ectionof the asymmetric dual social structure. 
Although thereisa distinct differencein the formality of the cremation deposits between the northeastern and southwestern halves of Mound A, with the bedrock cut pits in the southwestinstark contrasttothe depositsofthe northeast, there is a level of variability among thecremation deposits that lacks distinct pattern­ing. Cremation deposits acrossthe complexshow variabilityin thepresenceof gravearchitecture, faunal remains, number of individuals, and post-cremation treatment. A lack of patterning and replication of the interment characteristics pre­cludes theidenti.cationoffuneraryritesattached to distinct social identities. The absence of stan­dardized practice among the cremation deposits is made more acute when contrasted with the highlevel of structured spatialdivision bothon thelandscapeandintheinternal mounddivision. Mortuary rites may therefore re.ect a combina­tionofnonstandardized and mandated practices, with certain ceremonies and elements deemed essential and other rites considered optional or in .ux as the codi.ed norms of funerary ritual develop and evolve. 
TheAbreu Garcia complex provides another southern proto-Jê example of site planning revolving around spatial alignments as well as the use of distinct size differences in structures within paired arrangements. Excavation at the siteadds anotherlevelofdualismtothe mortuary landscape, however, extending spatial organiza­tionintothe interior of Mound A. Thepresence of pairedMECs on theplateau, pairedmounds within MEC1, and a spatial division within MoundA revealsmultiplelevelsof nested dual­ism. The nested natureofthe dualismhighlights both the opposition and the complementarity of the moiety system. Exactly how the complex was used by the moieties and by society as a wholeremains ambiguous,but theincorporation of asymmetryatthree nestedlevels demonstrates the necessity for bothmoietiestoberepresented as part of a complementary whole, just as the Kaingang kiki ritual requiresthe participationof

bothmoietieswhile also maintainingspatial and practical divisions. 
The .ndings at Abreu Garcia offer new insights into fundamental aspects of southern proto-Jê social organization, including the dual nature of the community, the manifestation of social structure on the landscape, and the incorporation of duality into mortuary ritual. Theidenti.cationof multiplelevelsof dualism, down to an internal mound division, raises important considerations for the excavation and interpretation of archaeological contexts. The .ndings have implications for research design and the development of appropriate method­ologies to answer culture-speci.c questions. Futureresearchcanbe designedthroughanemic lens, testing for dualism within archaeological contexts. Furthermore, the parallels among the archaeological record, ethnohistorical accounts, and ethnographic examples enable an under­standingofthefoundationofmodern descendent groups and an assessment of the continuity in indigenous culture beyond European contact.
