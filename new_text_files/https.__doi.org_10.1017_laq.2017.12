and political transitions.Incomparing Mesoamerican practices with hunting among other Native Ameri­can groups, particularly groups in the Amazon, he indicates that through the hunt, hunters take on the identityoftheirprey.Ontheonehand,this transforms the hunters into virile beings and makes the group morepowerful, while on theother hand their quarry becomesinsome sensethe hunter’s substitute at the climax of the hunt, when the animal’s life ends. At thesame timethisreminds them that substitutions are temporary, and that one day the hunter will also be sacri.ced.Moregenerally (and again,ifIunderstand him correctly), hunting is a paradigmatic process whereby new kinds of people, that is, new kinds of identities, arecreated.Itthus gets deployed to frame and understand transitions acrossavarietyofcontexts, frompregnancyand childbirthto pubertyand entryto high of.ce. Hunting is also a process that is funda­mentally re.exive.While it is generally true that our senseofwhoandwhatweareis createdandsustained through interactions with others, this interaction, as Irving Hallowell pointed out long ago, is mediated by particular languages,values,beliefs,and symbols. Oliviershows thatin Mesoamerica, discourse,values, beliefs, andsymbolsrelated to huntingare fundamen­tal to the interactions that create warriors, mothers, productive adults, and other essential identities. He makesthisveryclear whenhe returnstothe question with whichhebegan,arguing thatMexica rulers de.ne themselves through the mirror of Mexica enemies. These enemies are a source of sacri.cial victims, are associated with prey—captured with the same techniquesusedtotakedeerinthe hunt—and become, likedeer,intimatelyassociated with their captors who, upon sacri.cing them,takeonnewidentitiesbut know that somedaythey may wellbevictimstoo.

West Mexican archaeology encompasses more than shafttombs and.gurines,and ShaftTombs andFigures inWest Mexican Society:A Reassessment is just the volume to make that case. Though focused on these better-known materials as an organizing device, this striking book appliesavarietyofdisciplinaryperspec­tivestoaddresscurrent researchintheregion. Readers whoare merely curious aboutWestMexican archae­ologyorhave abidingprofessionalinterestinthe area will .ndthatthiseditedvolumeisahigh quality,beau­tifully illustrated, andhighlyrecommendabletext. 
The careful use of “reassessment” in the title is appropriate. A primary goal was to confront the stereotypeofa monolithicWestMexican “shaft tomb culture.” In so doing the contributors highlight the dynamic cultural variability of the region through speci.c archaeological cases, regional syntheses, and careful collectionanalyses. Theexcellent introduction offers a cogent historical essay on regional research. It situates the cultural variability of West Mexico in relation to widespread assumptions about Mesoamer­ica and provides an extended discussion of how the various chaptersinthevolume illustratelarger,current research trends.The summary chapterisalsooriented to the.eldbeyond thevolume.Though notasynthesis ofWestMexican archaeology,this bookis engaging as bothanintroductionand assessmentof researchin WestMexico. 
Thevolumeisorganizedintofour sectionsof three chapters each.The chapters are wellconceivedand are forthe mostpartextremely readable.Astrengthofthe volumeis the multidisciplinarygroupof contributors, whichincludesMexican,U.S., andEuropean scholars at various stages in their careers who are af.liated withavarietyof academic,government,and industry institutions. As a whole, the book is diachronic, dealingwith theFormative,Classic, and, toalesser extent,Postclassicperiods. 
The.rstsectioncontextualizes newresearchin the region through casestudiesdrawnfromthree disparate areas,withafocus on archaeology andbioarchaeol­ogy. Even within single sites, variation in mortuary treatmentisnotable.Becausemanytombsintheregion havebeen looted,theseexcavations,skeletalanalyses, anddescriptionsof funerary patternsprovide missing social contextfor larger culturalinterpretations.The chaptersinthesecond sectiontakea slightly broader perspective. From extensive excavations in Colima and two synthetic discussions of survey and related research in Jalisco, these chapters compare variation in tomb architecture, .gures, and grave goods more generally. Notable patterns include the discovery of “mortuary” ceramics in non-mortuary contexts and the variability of burial context, tomb architecture, andtomb placementindifferent social contexts.For example, shaft tombs can be found in both public and residential locales. Clearly, people in ancient West Mexico made manydifferent choices regarding funerary treatment, taking into account seasonality, social status, and gender.

LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 28, No. 2, 2017] 
The third section shifts to museum sciences with material andstatistical analysisofextant archaeologi­cal and museumcollections through theapplicationof noninvasivetechniquessuchaspXRF,ceramic authen­tication techniques such as identi.cation of mineral staining and insect pupae, and statistical analysis of social identity markers. 
The fourth section draws from art history; the chapters form a set of careful, minutely observed studies of three different .gurine styles focusing on their production and the social information they communicate.Allthree contributors address questions of representationandthe presentationofindividuality, but as de.ned by unique skin modi.cation, body paint, and status markers rather than speci.c bodily biological features as is typical in Western art. Like the earlierchapters, thoseinthissectionsuggest that speci.c .gurines do not necessarily representthe sex of theinterredindividuals andtherefore are actingin otherwaysinthe funerary context. 
The editors and contributors of the volume are undoubtedly conscious of the ongoing concern that these materials are known primarily through collec­tions because theyareoften looted andattimesfaked. Theeditors addressthisissueinthe introduction and throughPickering’schapterinthethird section;Robert Pickering makes a good case for the ef.cacy of his techniquesinrelationtothe large numberofauthenti­cated ceramicshehas studiedin museumcollections. This issue is also a theme in the more synthetic chapters, as the contributors grapple, successfully, with this burden in terms of sample selection and culturalpatterns. 
This is a terri.cally well-illustrated volume, with high-quality,full-color photographsofthearchaeolog­ical materialsdiscussedinthetext,includingacopious number of .gurines. The introduction contains two useful orientation maps; a number of other chapters also have maps and large data tables. Published in conjunction with the exhibition West Mexico:Ritual and Identity at theGilcreaseMuseuminTulsa,Okla­homa, June 26 to November 6, 2016, the book is a compilationofpapers froma symposiumheldatthe 2016 Societyfor American Archaeology meetings and “commissioned” chapters. 
ChristopherBeekmanand Robert Pickeringhave deliveredastriking, informativevolume thatisexactly what the title promises:adata-driven,culturally sen­sitive reevaluation of the most famous of the West Mexican archaeological materials. With its interdis­ciplinary approach and its emphasis on integrating thecontributions with current researchinWestMex­ico, the volume can serve as an introduction to the complexity of research and cultural expression in the region. But the text is also a springboard for future researchinaregionthatstillhas numerous interesting and unanswered questions.
