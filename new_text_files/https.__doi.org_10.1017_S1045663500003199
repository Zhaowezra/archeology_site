LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 1, No. 1, 1990] 4 
The article by Webster and Freter on obsidian-hydration dating at Copan presents not simply a revised chronological scheme for the collapse of this important lowland Maya site. Of wider sig­nificance are the questions it raises concerning the value of traditional ceramic sequences for dating archaeological deposits, and its successful application of obsidian-hydration dating to a large lowland Maya data set. 
The final contribution to this first issue-the short note by Bonavia on the authenticity of one of the paintings at Cerro Sechin, an Initial period site on the north coast of Peru-represents a very recent change in editorial policy. Originally the board of editors decided that for the first volume of the journal we wanted to publish only "article-length" manuscripts, as opposed to shorter research reports, comments, notes, and so forth. We found, however, that a large proportion of the manu­scripts submitted to the editorial office were shorter contributions, and concluded tardily that our original editorial decision might cause us to reject papers and data that otherwise would be significant to readers. The distinction between a "report" and an "article" is sometimes rather arbitrary; length is only one criterion, but it is an important one. In any case, Latin American Antiquity will now include a reports section featuring shorter contributions. 
The articles appearing in this and future issues of Latin American Antiquity may be controversial, and some readers may disagree with either the approaches used or the conclusions reached. Such controversy is all to the good. Like editors everywhere, the board of editors and I are looking· for papers that are original, clearly written, carefully reasoned, and factually correct. If such articles also prompt readers to indulge in their own critical thinking, so much the better! 
My comments here are an effort to explain some of the thinking that the Society, the board of 
editors, and I myself have employed in starting this new journal and in preparing the first issue 
from the manuscripts submitted. I hope these remarks will prove informative to potential authors, 
letting them know what we expect from them and giving them a clear and positive image of what 
we all hope this journal will be. I would also like authors to know what they in turn can expect 
from us: quick turnaround time between submission and publication! On average, reviewers have 
returned manuscripts and comments in four weeks. 
The subject of reviewers deserves special mention, because one of the real pleasures I have had 
during my first few months as editor has been my dealings with manuscript reviewers. I have found 
them to be enthusiastic about the new journal, eager to read the papers, thoughtful and responsible 
in their comments, and dependable about meeting deadlines. As I contact potential reviewers, it 
has been satisfying to know that I can count on old colleagues and friends to perform this sometimes 
burdensome task, and it has been especially rewarding to make new friends. I wish I could thank 
all of the reviewers by name here, but space does not permit me that luxury. 
While on the subject of thanks, however, I must add my own expression of gratitude to President 
Jerry Sabloff's in acknowledging the contributions of Society officers, committees, advisors, and 
colleagues, and particularly the members of Latin American Antiquity's editorial boards. Without 
their enthusiasm and commitment, this journal would still be only a dream. 
Many people have worked very hard to put this issue of Latin American Antiquity into your 
hands. We hope that you, the reader, appreciate their efforts. Please submit high quality manuscripts 
to the journal for publication! Please subscribe to the journal! Please encourage your library to 
subscribe! Please help make Latin American Antiquity a success!
