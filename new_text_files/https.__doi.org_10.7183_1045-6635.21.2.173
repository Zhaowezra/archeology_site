
INCA "STONE ANCESTORS" IN CONTEXT 
AT A HIGH-ALTITUDE USNU PLATFORM 

Frank M. Meddens, Colin McEwan, and Cirilo Vivanco Pomacanchari 
Recent investigations at mountaintop sites around the Ayacucho Basin in the central Andes have identified a distinctive cat­egory of isolated Inca stone-faced platforms. Test excavations of the three-tiered platform at one site, Incapirqa/Waminan, revealed a narrow vertical shaft penetrating from the original surface through the fills to a small basin cut into the under­lying andesite bedrock. A carefully arranged deposit of three unusual stones was found in this basin. Early Spanish chron­iclers give firsthand accounts of a variety of Inca solar rituals observed in Cuzco in which revered objects were deployed, including some sculpted in stone. The detailed descriptions of these stone objects are corroborated by the excavated finds at Incapirqa/Waminan and offer suggestive analogies for interpreting their context and significance. 
£studios recientes en sitios de alta puna en la cuenca de Ayacucho, en las Andes Centrales, han identificado una categoria particular de plataformas incaicas. Las excavaciones en una pirdmide truncada de Ires niveles en un sitio, Incapirqa!Wamanin, revelaron un estrecho pozo vertical que penetraba la superficie original de la estructura, atravesando el relleno, hasta llegar a una pequefia concavidad cortada en la roca madre de andesita.

n 1534 Atahualpa, the Inca ruler fated to meet Ithe Spaniards led by Francisco Pizarro, met with his future executioners in the great plaza of the town of Cajamarca, northern Peru (Jerez 1947:330-334 [1534]). Atahualpa himself chose the meeting place at afortaleza de la plaza, a type of platform that is the most visible aspect of a con­stellation of elements that together are encom­passed by the Quechua term usnu (Zuidema I 989a). The usnu embodies the notion of a sacred central space. The defining, even if least conspic­uous, element is a vertical conduit into the body of the earth designed to receive liquid offerings 1 (Zuidema l 989a; see also Staller 2008). Adjacent to this stood a stepped dais or platform along with other significant elements including a basin and stones, though these are not always well described 
or completely understood. It was at the usnu in Cuzco as capital of Tawantinsuyu (the Empire of the Four Quarters) that the Inca king conducted the solemn state religious rituals designed to maintain cosmic order and social stability (Meddens et al. 2008). It was no coincidence, therefore, that Atahualpa chose the usnu platform at Cajamarca as an appropriate site to define his position and power in relation to the approaching strangers. 
The definition and description of the usnu have been discussed previously in works by Coben (2006), Meddens ( 1997; Meddens et al. 2008), Pino Matos (2004), Staller (2008), and Zuidema (1989a). They all draw on a wide range of ethno­historical sources as well as archaeological data that provide partial glimpses into the form and function of Inca usnus. According to the particular settings

and circumstances in which the observations were made these accounts are uneven and selective. In effect they are but snapshots of a wide range of state ceremonies and religious rituals that varied greatly in character and purpose in the course of the year. The Spanish colonial sources are also inevitably freighted with the cultural baggage brought by their respective authors-their background, their office, their motives for recording and their sources and informants, and not least their own preconceptions and biases. 
The early ethnohistoric documents inform us that usnu platforms are found in the plazas of the major Inca provincial administrative centers as well as along the roads connecting the far-flung provinces and towns of Tawantinsuyu (Albornoz 1989:176 [1581-1585]). Within Inca settlements they are clearly architectural features of focal sig­nificance, being positioned within, or immediately adjacent to, the central plaza, and many have sur­vived more or less intact to the present day. They are said to have been used by the inca and his gov­ernors to communicate with their subjects, as well as with the deities and the ancestors. The Incas used these locations to make libations of chicha (maize beer) to Inti (the sun) and to sacrifice capac hucha or children representing royal obligations or "royal messengers" on significant occasions. The usnu platforms were the setting for the festivities marking zenith and anti-zenith events, the begin­ning of the agricultural calendar and the first full moon following the summer and winter solstices when special celebrations also took place (see below). 
Preeminent among the extant examples is the elaborate stepped pyramid at Vilcashuaman, Department of Ayacucho, in the Central Highlands (Hyslop 1990). It comprises four to five levels ris­ing to a height of some 8 m and measuring 18 x 16 m at the base. The fifth level is only present on the east side, where there is a ramp rising from the third to the upper fifth level with the ramp accounting for the extra stage along this side. The edifice is surrounded by a wall and appears to have been a protected precinct, access to which, we may sup­pose, would have been carefully regulated. It com­mands visibility to the northern, eastern, and southern horizons. The main approach from the east is made through an impressive gateway. The view to the west is more limited by the rising topog­raphy. The west side has a stairway leading to a monolithic double seat or throne at the top of the structure. Similar well-known platforms are found at Huanucopampa, comprising three levels. about 
3.5 min height and measuring 48 x 32 m at the base, with a staircase on its south face; Pumpu, comprising three levels, 2.9 m high and measuring 
25.5 x 20.5 mat the base, with a staircase on its east face; and Tambo Colorado, comprising one approximately square level, ca. 1.7 min height and measuring 10.4 x 12.7 x 13.7 x 13.3 mat the base, with a ramp on its northern face. Sites farther afield include El Shincal in northwest Argentina with a single level, 2 m high and measuring 16.5 x 16.5 m at the base, with a staircase on its west face; and Ingapirqa in Ecuador (Figure 1 ). 
The ethnohistoric sources underline the central role of these structures as the settings for signifi­cant ceremonial activities and events-a combina­tion of political, administrative, and religious functions serving a state-ordained agenda. At the imperial capital, Cuzco, there are no visible sur­viving physical remains of the usnus that were once located in each of the two main plazas. But con­temporary eyewitness accounts have enabled researchers to infer the original location of the prin­cipal usnu in Haucaypata, the central plaza (Zuidema l 989a). When the central fountain in Haucaypata was refurbished in 1995 a wall that may have been part of the footing of this structure was exposed. Associated with this were large quan­tities of Inca ceramics together with four camelid figurines aligned toward the southeast, one in gold, two in silver, and one of Spondylus shell (Farring­ton and Raffino 1996). A secondary usnu is thought to have stood in Limaqpampa to the southeast (Zuidema 1989a:407). 
It is clear that the usnu in Haucaypata in Cuzco was used in the course of horizon observations of movements of the sun around the time of zenith and anti-zenith events in relation to two pillars on Mt. Sucanca (Zuidema 2008:249, 261, 263-264 ). More recently Pino Matos (2004) has demonstrated that the usnu platform at Huanucopampa was also prob­ably used for making solstice and lunar observa­tions.

LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 21 , No. 2, 201 O 
these theatrical public displays, the formal seating of the king on the platform established a powerful symbolic vertical connection among the sky and mountain deities (wamanf or apu), the contempo­rary world of the Incas, and their ancestors in the world below (Meddens 1997; Zuidema 1989a). 
The written and graphic evidence from the Inca capital offers unequivocal testimony to the signif­icance of the usnu complex, including the platform, as a material expression of key aspects oflnca cos­mology. Other accounts support the role played by the usnu as the locus for a range of vital political and religious activities enacted on designated dates in the agricultural calendar at provincial adminis­trative centers (Hyslop 1990; Staller 2008). 
The earliest sources that describe the rituals and activities associated with usnu platforms are by Juan de Betanzos (1987:185-186 [1551]) in 1551 and Pedro Cieza de Le6n (1947:435 [1553]) in 1553. Other native and Spanish authors wrote in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries, soon after the collapse of the neo-Inca state in Vil­cabamba. This was a time when native quipuca­mayoc record keepers still maintained credible accounts of Inca traditions. There is demonstrable overlap among the different accounts of the uses of usnu platforms, and this enhances our confi­dence in the reliability of the source material. 
The indigenous chronicler Guaman Poma de Ayala explicitly describes the usnu as "a throne of the Inca" (1980:239, 357 [1583-1615]), an inter­pretation also made by Joan de Santa Cruz Pacha­cuti Yamqui (1993:200 [1613]).Albornoz specifies tower-like structures that were built in beautiful stonework, citing examples at Vilcas, Pucara, Huanuco Viejo, and Tiahuanaco. He (1989: 176 [1581-1585]) states that these were to be found in the plazas of Inca towns and along the imperial roads. These were the places where the Inca lords sat and drank and made sacrifices to the sun (An6n­ima 1968:157 [1580-1621]). Such sacred locales were also marked by what is called a pilon­variously interpreted as a post of stone or gold or a stone basin in the town plaza. This may represent a conflation of elements-a large stone perhaps having a sculpted "basin" to receive liquid offer­ings and channel them into the earth. 
These accounts are complemented by other descriptions of the usnu as a "'sitting' stone" (Albornoz 1989:176 [1581-1585]) serving as a boundary marker (Gonzalez Holgufn 1952 [1608]) and as a stone found on ceque lines (Cobo 1895:27, 45 [1653]). The usnu is noted as a site for making solar observations (An6nima 1968 [ 1580-1621 ]), and it is also identified as a site for undertaking human sacrifice (Carabajal 1965:218-219 [1586]; Cieza deLe6n 1947:435 [1553]; Guaman Poma de Ayala 1980:236 [1583-1615]). In the Huarochirf manuscript there is explicit mention of walling an "usnu" (Salomon and Urioste 1991:102). 
We will only ever have a partial glimpse of the whole round of ritual activities practiced at such sites. Inevitably it is early ethnohistorical docu­ments pertaining to Cuzco that provide the best possibilities for reconstructing Inca cosmology as expressed in ritual practice, and we will consider them in more detail below. What is less well known is how far such practices were extended beyond urban settings into the rural hinterland that provided the agricultural production underpinning the vig­orously expanding Inca state, and it is this that pro­vides the focus for the present study. 
Background to the Present Study 
John Hyslop's (1984, 1990) seminal field research on the Inca royal highways and their supporting infrastructure was carried out in the 1980s, open­ing up an exciting new chapter in the study of the rural hinterland in the Inca provinces. Well-known elements integrally related with the Inca road sys­tem include tambos (Inca state lodgings) and apa­chetas (stone cairns), which frequently marked the highest point of a pass, where small offerings such as stones, coca leaves, and other personal tokens were left by passing travelers. 
Hyslop's pioneering investigations have since been amplified and extended in the Capac Nan sur­veys that commenced in 2003 in the Department of Ayacucho under the auspices of the Instituto Nacional de Cultura. In Ayacucho these surveys, together with the more recent fieldwork on which this article is based, have identified a new category of isolated Inca usnu platforms originally referred to by Albornoz (1989:176 [1581-1585]) and recently rediscovered and recorded from the 1990s onward by Cirilo Vivanco Pomacanchari. The area selected for study in the Department of Ayacucho comprises some of the earliest territory to come under the imperial control of Tawantinsuyu. Our

fieldwork between 2003 and 2008 embraced some 20platform sites, all of which were directly linked with significant elements of the ancient road sys­tems. These affirm the close association between the isolated platforms and the Inca road network observed by Albornoz. One of the most important surviving usnu plat­forms in an Inca provincial administrative center is located at Vilcashuaman (Figure 1), where the road leading northward to Chinchasuyu intersects with the road that runs eastward from Cuzco and on to Chincha territory on the co&st. The Incas are said to have thought ofVilcashuaman as the actual geographical center of their empire ( Cieza de Leon 1947:435 [1553]), whereas Cuzco has been referred to as its symbolic center (Garcilaso de la Vega 1723:1. xviii 22 [1609]). A recent discrimi­nating study by Carolyn Dean (2006) notes that the vast puna hinterlands of the Inca Empire have long been perceived as essentially empty and underutilized spaces through which people and animals transited. She uses hitherto unknown rep­resentations of the puna landscape from the recently published Galvin manuscript to argue that many of our assumptions about the cognition and marking of these "wild" landscapes need to be reassessed. This manuscript was written by Munia, was completed in 1590, and was probably illus­trated by the same hand responsible for Felipe Guaman Poma de Ayala's illustrated El Primer Nueva Cor6nica y Buen Gobierno (1980 [1583-1615]). It includes pictorial references to stepped-cut stone platforms identified by the term apacheta rather than usnu. This demonstrates the need for a more detailed study and analysis of fea­tures currently subsumed under terms ranging from usnu and apacheta to saywa and huanca. These designations embrace diverse categories of _cultural constructions including platforms, 

'.stacked-stone structures, and large upright mono­liths. All are closely associated with the notion of boundary or liminal space, and the apacheta and saywa structures (stacks of stones of varying com­plexity with sacred connotations, denoting bound­ary elements in the terrain) appear to be particularly linked to the movement of people through the high puna landscape. A full analysis of these structures and their role in cognizing and marking the landscape will be considered in a sep­arate article. 
Survey and Excavation in 2007 
This article is an outcome of a research project called "Inca Ushnus: Landscape, Site and Symbol in the Andes," conducted collaboratively by Royal Holloway (University of London), the Universidad de Huamanga, and the British Museum; it was funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Coun­cil. The goals are to investigate high-altitude usnu platforms in the Department of Ayacucho using topographic mapping, sample excavation, soil sci­ence, palynology, and soundscape analysis, com­bined with ethnographic fieldwork as well as documentary and collections research. The princi­pal aim of the project is to improve our knowledge and understanding of both the symbolic and the practical principles underlying usnu construction, the rationale for their placement and function within the landscape, and the activities that took place at these sites. The project has so far identified and mapped some 20 platforms across the department and completed sample excavations at 11 of these (Figure 1). This article focuses on the excavations carried out at one of the sites, Incapirqa/Waminan (Figure 1). Here, at the bottom of a steep-sided shaft that cut through the internal fills of the plat­form, a placed deposit of three distinctive sculpted stones was discovered in a small circular basin excavated in the bedrock. 
Of the 20 platforms investigated to date, 14are located on altiplano mountaintops surrounding the Ayacucho Basin at altitudes of between 4,200 and 4, 700 m asl. The rationale for their location appears to depend on several factors. Most of the high­altitude mountaintop platform sites (9out of 14sur­veyed platforms on high mountaintops) are positioned at vantage points that maximize the all­around view of distant mountains on the horizon. Sixteen of the surveyed Inca platforms lie in close proximity to both local and interregional road net­works (four have insufficient data). Although paths and roads have a long history of use and are noto­riously difficult to date accurately, where we have a high degree of confidence in our data we believe that most of them can be assigned to the late Hori­zon. Our broad hypothesis is that these high-altitude Inca usnu platforms and their associated roads and supporting infrastructure were intended to assert effective control over puna pastoral populations. Visual links with apachetas and saywas are fre-

quent. Regional differences are apparent in their ori­entations, the masonry used, the presence or absence of stepped access, and the presence or absence of corbels (Figure 2).Most of the platforms stand alone, although occasionally roughly built chullpas (stone built burial structures, usually square or circular, sometimes resembling squat towers with a single small entrance) or rustic cir­cular structures are found in the vicinity. Some are paired, with the two platforms lying within several hundred meters of each other. An outstanding example of a pair of platforms can be found at the major late Intermediate/late Horizon shrine of Usc­cunta (Figure 1), where, unlike most of the other usnu sites, the platforms lie .5 km apart flanking a plain. Behind the northernmost platform there is an imposing cliff. Immediately above this lie a series of Inca kallankas and chullpas together with a large number of associated circular structures. This unusually extensive high-altitude settlement is distinct from all the other sites so far surveyed, and our initial impression is that the resident pop­ulation probably fluctuated seasonally. 
Our field observations reveal marked regional variation in some of the characteristics of the plat­forms on either side of a boundary approximately defined by the Rio Pampas (Figure 1). North of the Rio Pampas the high-altitude platforms are usually constructed out of roughly modified field­stone, whereas the top tier of the southern ones is typically built of cut stone ashlar. The orientation of the long axis of the northern platforms varies from north-northwest-south-southwest to east-west, while the ones south of the Rio Pam­pas are mostly aligned near north-south. Nearly all of the northern platforms lack corbels, whereas almost all of the southern platforms have a corbel level. All of the southern high mountaintop plat­forms are at higher altitudes than the northern ones. Most of the southern platforms have a stepped access abutting their northern fa!;ade, whereas many of the northern ones lack steps, and where they do exist, their orientation varies (two on the southeast facade, one on the east facade, and one on the north side). These data will be reported in more detail in another article. 
Excavations at the Site of lnkapirqa!Waminan 
One of the sites where we have conducted test excavations is Inkapirqa/Waminan, lying at an altitude of 4,374 Ii1 asl on a rounded mountaintop ca. 27 km southeast of the city of Ayacucho (Uni­versal Transverse Mercator [UTM] 588680­8522340; Figures 1, 3-4). The platform was erected upon the very summit of the mountain on which it stands and commands outstanding unin­terrupted vistas to the distant horizon on all sides. To the north, south, and east all the most impor­tant mountains in this part of the Andean cordillera can be observed over distances of up to 1 I 0-130 km. These include Rasuwillka (north-northwest), Qarawarasu (south-southeast), Qomullawe

east). Two (Rasuwillka and Qarawarasu) feature 
as named mountain deities in early historical doc­
uments. All are still actively venerated as sacred 
sites by rural inhabitants. 
The fncapirqa/Waminan site comprises three 
superimposed platforms. The basal one is little 
more than a rectangular outline of rocks, measur­
ing ca. 32.7 x 18. 5 m and surrounding the main 
platform itself. At best it is a very low double­
faced fieldstone wall, .6 5 m wide and barely a sin­
gle rock in height, constructed directly on top of , the ground surface (Figure 4 ). The second platform '.

consists of a single-faced wall, ca. 1 m in height and measuring ca. 24.5 x 11. 4 m. The third and uppermost platform is contained within a doubie­faced wall, ca. 1.3 5 m in height and .6 5 m wide. This stage measures 22. 8 min length x 9.6 min width. The walls of the platform are built out of selected and minimally modified fieldstone, pre­dominantly a gray andesite, which appears to have been quarried from rock outcrops in the immedi­ate vicinity of the monument. The rocks deployed measure from ca .. 3 x .3 m to ca . .4 x . 7 m. 
The structure's long axis is aligned on a 
northeast-by-southwest orientation of 73° (Figure 
3). There are no steps or stairs facilitating access 
to the top. A large shallow-angled cut close to the 
center of the platform suggests that an attempt at 
looting was made at some point in its later history, 
though it is hard to specify when this intervention 
took place. Taking advantage of this cut, we opened 
an excavation unit (2 x 2 m, later expanded to 3.5 
x 3. 5 m) to obtain information on the internal com­
position and construction history of the platform. 
Since it was originally erected approximately 500 
years ago, a 5 to I 0-cm layer of vegetation and top­
soil has developed across the upper surface. 
Beneath this the platform fill comprises a sequence of intercalated layers. From top to bottom these begin with a pale brown grit and gravel derived from bedrock followed by a black sandy silt, a fur­ther layer of light brown grit and gravel, another layer of black sandy silt, an orange-brown silty gravelly material from a subsoil, and a light brown grit and gravel followed by a deep black sandy silt layer (Figure 5). With the exception of the orange layer, all the fills are derived from soils, subsoils, or bedrock in the immediate vicinity of the plat-

form. The orange-brown material derives from a completely different parent material for which no parallel has been found anywhere close to the plat­form (Kemp, in Meddens et al. 2008; Millena Frouin, personal communication 2009). In the course of the excavations, evidence of three nar­row, steep-sided deep cut features became appar­
ent in the northern and eastern section profiles (Figure 5). These appear to have been fashioned fairly soon after the completion of the construction of the platform. Two of them were positioned side by side, and the shallower one (13) cut the deeper one ( 19). These features do not represent looting pits, for they were evidently carefully dug, steep sided, and meticulously executed. The first mea­sures . 7 5 min diameter at the top and .10 min diam­eter at the base and has a depth of .92 m (13). This feature recuts the second (19), which has a diam­eter of .65 m at the top and a depth of 1.8+ m, at which point it reaches the underlying andesite bedrock. Here it measures ca .. 61 min diameter, and the shaft continues to cut directly into the bedrock, forming a basin .66 m deep (Figure 5). Its fill comprises black sandy silts with some lenses of crushed bedrock material. The basal fill was notably moister than any of the surrounding plat­form fills or the fill of the cut above. Within this basin three elongated stones had been placed in a tripod configuration, with the tips pitched against each other and the bases resting against the sides of the cut (Figures 6-8). 
The Shapes of the Three Stones at Incapirqa!Waminan 
The three stones are of similar sizes, one sculpted in white andesite and the other two in red andesite. In general all three are roughly worked, although particular attention has been paid to dressing the bases of two of them. The stone in white andesite is 40.7 cm high, 17.8 cm wide at its widest, 12 cm at its narrowest midpoint, and 1 cm at its tip. It is best described as "conical," and its base, which measures 12.2 x 10.4 cm, has been carefully squared off and flattened, thus enabling it to stand vertically upright (Figure 9). The first stone sculpted in red andesite is 31. 7 cm high. Its widest point is 24.4 cm up from the base, where it mea­sures 20.9 x 13.2 cm, and its top is slightly pointed so that it may best be described as "trapezoidal." Its base measures 12.2 x 10.3 cm (almost precisely the same dimensions as the first) and is also squared off and flattened, enabling it too to stand vertically upright (Figure 10). The other stone in red andesite is 36 cm long and 13.8 x 10.1 cm at its widest mid­point and has a flat circular modified base with a diameter of 5.1 cm. It is best described as roughly crescent shaped, but unlike the other two it cannot be easily stood on one end (Figure I I). The long axial orientation of the stones within the roughly circular cut was approximately 260°W for the white stone, 330°N for the smaller of the red stones, and 90°E for the larger red one (Figure 6). 
The fact that the sizes of the squared-off bases of the white and red stones match each other within a I-mm tolerance is unlikely to be a coincidence. The shape of the bases of these two stones, analo­gous to a tenon, suggests that they were fashioned in this manner to fit into a kind of standardized opening or socket, perhaps analogous to the sock­ets noted for the conical stones found at the site of Cochasquf in Ecuador (see below). 
The top of the third steep-sided cut was observed near the base of the west-facing section in the trench. Its upper portion was destroyed by the later looting pit, and its bottom part remains unexca­vated. The only other finds recovered from the exca-

vations included two unmodified stones, one bar shaped in gray andesite and a smaller elongated one in red andesite. These both came from the shallower of the two shaft features (13), which recut the deeper one. 
The "Vertical" Shaft-Like Cuts 
The Incapirqa/Waminan platform was built by first constructing the walls, probably accompanied by the placement of offerings in specific locations around the base of the structure, although this has not yet been positively demonstrated due to the limited extent of the excavations. This would then have been followed by carefully laying in the plat­form fills. These have evidently been deposited in a predetermined sequence of structured layers. Fol­lowing completion of the construction, and for rea­sons that we will discuss below, we suggest that the subsequent excavation of the steep-sided pits above the location of the original stone offerings is likely to have been designed to "feed" them with libations at appropriate times. 
We surmise that the basin incised into the under­lying bedrock is likely to have been cut prior to the construction of the platform overlying it. It would then have been necessary to locate its position with some precision following the deposition of the fills. This would not have been difficult to achieve: a long wooden pole standing upright in its base and left to protrude above the top level of the fills would have served the purpose. This would have enabled the digging of the subsequent steep-sided shaft to be aligned with the top of the hole cut into the underlying bedrock with the placed deposit of stones at its base. Alternatively the steep-sided cut might have been excavated down to the underly­ing andesite bedrock, which was then itself exca­vated to form the basin in which to place the stones. Considering the diameter of the cut (61-66 cm), its depth of ca. 2.5 m, and the complexities of cut­ting into the andesite bedrock, we believe that the latter is the less likely alternative.

literally and metaphorically. From an Andean per­spective, the compact hardness of stone and bone is visible evidence of an earlier stage of creation recounted in myths-life crystallized, as it were. Hard, unusual stones (such as illas and istrillas) and bare bones (like the skull kept for khuyay [protec­tion]) are held to be potent sources of energy. They are intimately connected with lightning and sun­light, whose power they absorb and condense (Allen 1988:63). The focus of indigenous worship on particular mountains in the landscape is deeply embedded in contemporary consciousness and rit­ual practice and represents a long-lived tradition of considerable time depth, significantly predating the Incas. Early Spanish chroniclers, such as Juan de Betanzos, Molina, Antonio de Vega, Garcilaso de la Vega, and Guaman Poma, among others, recorded detailed accounts of a variety oflnca solar rituals observed in Cuzco in which revered objects, including some sculpted in stone, were deployed. The stone objects are variously described as resem­bling a "sugarloaf," "pineapple," "pinecone," or "bowling pin"; we will suggest that these offer sug­gestive analogies for identifying the find at

Incapirqa/Waminan as well as helping to interpret its context and significance. 
Portable sacred stones may represent huacas, deities, ancestors, and stone equivalents or "broth­ers" of the living. Ayar Auca, one of the original mythical Inca ancestors, changed into a stone pil­lar and remained in the central plaza of Haucay­pata in Cuzco (Urton 1999:5 l). He forms part of the symbolic confirmation of the Inca dynasty's mythological right to rule. Staller (2008:289, 292) notes that the "sugarloaf' -shaped stone of the usnu is a direct reference to Ayar Auca. The concept of huauque or brother refers to idols of stone or gold who were held to be the "brothers" of the Inca kings and were revered and treated accordingly (Meddens 2006; van de Guchte 1990). 
Betanzos gives an eyewitness account of the use of a stone object similar to those discovered at lncapirqa, in a context closely associated with the central sacred space of Haucaypata (and therefore its usnu). This description merits detailed quota­tion, as it includes extensive elements of the ritual activities surrounding the deployment of this revered stone object: 
And there [in the temple] they made their sac­rifices, their reverences and worship.... And so that the common people could worship out­side as they were not allowed to enter there 
[into the temple] if they were not lords, they worshiped in the center of the main square of Cuzco, where at present is the royo { (sic) rollo, pillar or post for public punishment} there was a stone made in the form of a "sugarloaf" with a pointed top and wrapped in a band of gold. This stone was used the same day that the wrapped idol of the sun was, and served so that the commoners could worship it, while the wrapped idol in the House of the Sun, was worshiped by the lords. Not only was this wrapped idol and its servants held in high regard, so were these stones. They were held to be blessed and sacred. At the time that this particular stone was erected and seated a piece measuring circa three thumbs in length and width was broken off and Inca Yupanqui had a piece of molten silver placed and molded to fill the gap and this was done so precisely that it appeared as if nailed in the rock. In this house the principal lords were interred in the patios and rooms except where the idol was. The day that the idol was {put} in the House of the Sun, the stone was put in the center of the plaza and ten days later the wrapped idol [of the sun] was placed on the seat. It is said that Inca Yupanqui ordered the adorning of several small litters wrapped in gold cloth and, so decorated,

instructed that the principal lords of the city, who were his three friends and the head priest of the sun should take these litters. The Inca Yupanqui himself entered in the presence of the idol, took and presented the litters and had them taken [in procession] through the town, instructing the residents to worship the sun, and the lords said that the litters carried the sun who blessed the people and their sons. And so when a native of the city of Cuzco left the town he was worshiped in the provinces as a son of the sun and so they were respected, revered and esteemed. They make sacrifices to them, which they call "arpa." And what was given to eat and in service they did with the same solem­nity as with which they made their offerings to their idols. And with the stone, which they placed in the middle of the plaza, they made a large pit first into which all the people of the city offered pieces of gold to the sun. When this offering was complete they sealed the pit and on top they erected a stone font, a little over 2.5 m high. And around this they buried some golden bundles a little over a thumb high and wide. These bundles which they so buried they interred in the same number of sets as there were lineages in Cuzco. With each lineage there was one bundle representing its princi­pal. So arranged and in that order they were placed under ground. In the font in its center they placed the stone representing the sun and this arrangement of bundles around it was an offering of the generation and lineages of Cuzco from Manco Capac's foundation of it to those who were there then, who then placed the stone and bundles in the manner described. 
All those of the city made sacrifices of a great many llamas and alpacas from then until the 
moment that the Spaniards entered the town

When Betanzos describes the stone "made in the form of a 'sugarloaf'" he clearly has in mind the cone-shaped loaves of sugar that were known in the early sixteenth century. The sugary syrup was gath­ered in conical pottery molds in which the sugar crystallized and hardened. The mold was inveed and removed, leaving the sugarloaves standmg upright on their flat bases (Figure 12). 
Betanzos 's eyewitness testimony highlights the significance of locating the stone in the middle of the plaza as a symbolic gnomon or "axis mund" 
_
and its association with an excavated basm or pit, as well as making an explicit connection with ancestor worship. Zuidema ( l 989a:419) first drew attention to Betanzos's observation that the sugar loaf-shaped stone represented the sun as wor­shiped by the common people in Haucaypata. The portable gnomon as described here would only be placed on its bench at the times when it served an astronomical role, such as when the sun or moon passed through its zenith (Zuidema l 989a:419). In one passage Zuidema (1989b:251) describes the gnomon as a symbol of the Inca king himself as 
the axis mundi. 

Recent references to platform sites in the area of our fieldwork, particularly in the southern sector of the Department of Ayacucho, frequently include the terms mesapata and intihuatana. The former appears linked to the mesa used in th e area or the

sun's annual journey along the horizon and the times of stasis or standstill. Guaman Poma, for example, frames his account in a very descriptive manner, which seems to draw on the underlying structure of the language (Quechua) from which he derived the details of the narrative. His informant was a native astronomer (Juan Yunpa from the vil­lage of Uchuc Marca in Lucanas). The sun is said to travel, sit, rest, and rule. It travels six months to

the left followed by six months to the right. This chronicler notes and marks out all the months of the year and highlights that the sun has its "rest­ing" places linked in with this monthly sequence. It is stated that the sun has its "principal seat" in August as well as a "secondary seat" (Guaman Poma deAyala 1980:884 [898] [1 58 3-161 5];McE­wan 2004:494-495). These solar movements and the perceived moments when the sun "took its seat" were linked to specific horizon positions at the standstill points associated with the June and December solstices. 
Cristobal de Molina, in his Relacion de las Fa­bulas y Ritos de los Incas, discusses the month of August when the Incas celebrated their citua fes­tival, and Garcilaso de la Vega (172 3:7.VI 227 [1 609]) notes that the festival of citua was held on the first day of the (full) moon in September fol­lowing the equinox. He states that the Incas had richly carved stone columns placed in the patios and plazas of Cuzco to verify the precise moment of its occurrence. They decorated these pillars with

flowers and fragrant herbs, and it was on top of these that they put the "seat of the sun." On that day at the equinox the sun would "completely flood" these pillars (Garcilaso de la Vega 1723:2.XXII 61 [ 1609]). Citua served to purify the state from the accumulated dirt, disease, and disorder of the year gone by (Molina 1989:73-96 [1576]). Not only did it cleanse the Inca nation itself, but on the fifth day of this celebration all the subject nations of the Inca came with their huacas in their national dress, and they and their priests came to pay homage to the creator, sun, and thunder deities (Molina I 989:94 [1576]). This festival therefore operated on a much wider scale to purify the empire at large and was designed to affirm the divine authority oflnca rulers and to assert their hegemony over conquered terri­tories and subject peoples. On that day they gave thanks to the creator for allowing them to partici­pate in the festival and pleaded that there would fol­low another year without disease. They also honored the sun and the thunder. The inca drank with them; he had the sun in front of him, a large beaker that held chicha, and the priest would take it and pour it into the usnu, which as already noted is described as a stone pillar wrapped in gold that had an abujero(?) (Molina I 989:78-79 [ 1576]). 
In a similar vein Molina mentions a small "pil­lar or basin of gold" as the focus of worship: 
In the middle of the plaza ( Haucaypata), where stood the golden usnu, which was in the fash­ion of a little pillar or basin, where they made libations of chicha, when they drank there were four hundred Indians around that pillar or basin in full battle dress. One hundred facing Col­lasuyu where the sun rises and another hun­dred facing west, which is the road to Chinchasuyu, and another hundred with their face towards north, which is the road to Anri­suyu, and one hundred with their faces south, and they had all of the types of arms which they knew. By the time that those who came from the temple of the sun arrived all chanted in loud voices "be gone evil." They carried this cry to all four directions, passing it on to other groups along the way,. who carried it onward to spec­ified locations such as maj or rivers and bod­ies of water, where they washed their weapons for the evil to be carried away from the nation [1989:74 (1576); emphasis added]. 
These great state festivals were also the occasions for bringing the productive capacity of the high puna grasslands in the form of huge herds of lla­mas into the capital and under Inca control:

four quarters. There were so many that it was said there were more than 100,000 head. All these animals had to be perfect and clean. Later the priest of the sun would select and sacrifice 4 of the cleanest, whitest and most perfect examples, one to the creator, one to the thun­der, one to the sun, and one to Huanacauri. They had on some large gold plates the r;anco (special maize dough made up with the [red] blood of the llamas). These plates with said 
·anco were in front of the seat of the sun and the high priest in a loud voice so all could hear [stated]: "See how this r;anco, is eaten for those who are with sin, and insincerity the sun our father will observe and punish" [Molina 1989:79-80 (1576)]. 
Other early chroniclers, such as Zarate, also make particular mention of the use of stone idols. He states that in place of the sun they had in their tem­ples some stones, which they worship and which they call huacas, which is their word for crying, and therefore they cry when they enter these temples 
Antonio de Vega describes the cone-shaped pil­lar as being composed of different materials: 
The great Punchao stood in a chapel of better workmanship and decor, than all the rest; it was made of very fine gold fashioned as a human figure in the likeness of an Inca, it was seated on a chair, or throne, which the Indians call hana (i.e.tiana), all of the finest solid gold. Its ears pierced with ear-spools or zarcillos inserted, which we see worn to this day by Indian lords and those of Inca descent: it had its crown and tassel arranged in the way which the kings here used to wear them (as shown on a diorite stone head found at Amarucancha in Cusco) .. . and which nowadays the Indians wear, which they call llautus, but without the reddish tassel, for that is a royal insignia; from the back and shoulders there emerged some rays of solid gold, and what is most admirable in the composition and craftsmanship of this idol was that in the middle of the seat or hana (sic) there was [something] like a pineapple,

or sugarloaf, whose end was lodged from beneath in the entrails or intestines of the idol, and this sphere, like a pinecone or sugarloaf, was composed of the burned livers and hearts turned into powder and ashes, of those Inca kings who had died, and who would die, cov­ered and preserved by a layer of fine gold on top [1948:4-5 (1600); translation from McE­wan 2004:498; emphasis added) . 
Recent work undertaken by Andrew Nelson on Inca-period mummies from the Laguna de los C6n­dores site in the northeastern Andes of Peru docu­ments these kinds of practices in revealing detail. Key diagnostic features of the mummies include the evisceration of abdominal (and sometimes tho­racic) organs through the anus (see Antonio de Vega's reference to a "pinecone" or "sugarloaf' composed of burned livers and hearts); the anus being plugged with a cotton "tampon" analogous to the "pinecone" or "sugarloaf' object that was lodged from below into the entrails of the sun idol Punchao; and the bodies being hyperflexed (knees to chest, hands at chin), perhaps the kind of object referred to in Spanish colonial sources as a bulto, in which the dried-out ancestor may be perceived as turning into a condition of stone similar in shape to the stone objects described. Finally, the inten­tional mummification itself draws the bultos into the domain of ancestor worship (Guillen et al. 
2009). 
Cristobal de Albornoz makes note of the con­nection to outlying usnus beyond the confines of major Inca cities and administrative centers: "There is another general huaca along the royal roads and in the town squares which they call 'uznus.' They were in the manner of a bowling pin made of many different kinds of stone as well as gold and silver" (1989: 176 [1581-1585); translation by Frank Med­dens). Together these accounts point to the idea of the platforms being used as an instrument of state­craft to appropriate and incorporate newly con­quered territory into the expanding Inca hegemony. They also underline the significance of the placed deposit of conical stones at Incapirqa/Waminan as "stone ancestors." 
Axiality and Seating 
These accounts all allude directly and indirectly to the way in which axiality, seats, and seating are inextricably linked and find material expression in specific objects. The conical stone pillars form an "axis mundi" linking the sun to the realms of hanan pacha, kay pacha, and uku pacha at certain times of the year (McEwan 2004:499, 508). The tiana stool or seat was the quintessential symbol of authority and power for Andean native rulers. Fol­lowing the Spanish conquest the right to be seated on a stool or to be carried in a litter was repeatedly noted in early colonial documents as confirming an individual's right to govern. Restrictions on native rulers' rights to use these outward symbols of their power rnsulted in persistent complaints lodged with the colonial authorities (Ramirez 2005:166-187). Only when at rest and seated was an indigenous leader empowered and able to give structure, command, and rule. Likewise Andean deities sat at rest following their mythical journeys, and the places where the huacas sat were wor­shiped. For both rulers and deities these places of rest were raised, as were mountaintops. In move­ment founding ancestors were hazardous and linked to aspects of disorder (Ramirez 2005: 169, 172, 176). The seat of the sun therefore represents a

powerful physical representation of the sun's sacred power and its entitlement to authority, its presence in the world below or uku pacha, reflecting the sun's power in this realm. 
The nature and meaning of tripartite divisions in different domains in Inca cosmology are addressed in an extensive and detailed literature (Bauer 1998; Zuidema 1962). The Inca ceque sys­tem, for example, used tripartition as an organiz­ing principle ordering space, social divisions, and the temporal cycle. As.a result of our work at other usnu platforms we have become aware of the way in which red and gray-white andesite have been selectively deployed. At Incapirqa/Limaqawarina (Quinoa), for example, the natural bedrock is black basalt, in stark contrast to the platform walls, which are constructed of red and gray-white andesite that had been quarried from glacial erratics found in close proximity to the structure. 
The two platforms at the site of Usccunta are situated approximately .5 km apart on the plain on the south side of the site. Intiwatana (2 [UTM 588109-8418974]) is constructed with gray andesite wa11s positioned topographica11y some 14 m higher than the second platform, at 4,495 m asl. It is purposefully situated on a gray/white bedrock material, whereas the lower Intwatana (3 [UTM 588373-8418523]), also built with gray andesite walls at 4,482 m as!, is built atop a bright red bedrock material. The contrast between the higher, gray/white bedrock of lntiwatana (2) and the lower, red bedrock platform of lntiwatana (3) may be con­strued as a visible expression of a Hanan.Burin complementary opposition. 
The color symbolism of white as the sun itself and red associated with the inca as the son of the sun reflects seasonal changes in the position and strength of the sun in the sky. Some of the current Ayacucho Quechua terminology associated with the yearly movements of the sun includes qapac inti or tayta inti (powerful or lord sun), llullu inti (sma11 or baby sun), rupay inti (red hot or burning sun), and sullu inti (monstrous or abortive sun). Qapac or tayta inti can perhaps be most easily asso­ciated with white, and rupay inti, with red. Like­wise, white can be directly linked to Capac Raymi, December and the summer solstice, and apu inti or the lord sun (Demarest 1981 :27), daylight and the celestial realm (Sta11er 2008:284), and the strong sun. Viracocha, the mature sun, is described as a white figure by Cobo (1892:111, 149 [1653); Demarest 1981 :32). Red is associated with the win­ter solstice in June, Inti Raymi, Churi Inti, and Pun­chao, when the sun is weakest and young (Demarest 1981 :26-27), linked to its cyclical rebirth. Red in certain contexts is directly associated with the Inca royal lineage and the Inca king (as son of the sun [Antonio de Vega 1948:4-5 1600]), red being the color of the llautus or royal fringe (crown). 
Antecedents and Parallels 
A hint of the potential time depth of the ritual tra­dition revealed at Incapirqa/Waminan is indicated by the find at the middle Horizon (Wari) site of Con­chopata consisting of a similar group of stones in a deep, steep-sided cut feature penetrating bedrock. Conchopata is located on the eastern outskirts of the city of Ayacucho, immediately adjacent to and under the modem airport. Here a stone-lined cist of a size and configuration similar to that frequently associated with burials of early middle Horizon date has been recently excavated. This feature was centrally placed in a large stone-walled circular structure at the site. The building has been inter­preted by its excavators as a precursor to the later

LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 21, No. 2, 2010 
"D" -shaped temples found here. The cist is cut into the underlying bedrock, and at its base four coni­cally shaped stones were found vertically placed, three of them positioned around the central and largest stone. The stones appear to be river cobbles, with at least one of them having been modified and shaped by polishing and having a notch added around its waist. They are similar in size or a little larger than the stones found at Incapirqa/Wami­nan. Anita Cook suggests that these may represent "ancestor stones" (personal communication 2008). 
Following the excavation of the three conical stones in context at Incapirqa/Waminan we became alert to the possibility that other comparable stones might exist. A reconnaissance survey was carried out toward the end of the 2007 field season by Cir­ilo Vivanco Pomacanchari and students from the Universidad Nacional de San Cristobal de Hua­manga at the site of Accoccasa/ Aquqasa/Mesap­ata/Mesayocpata near Circamarca in southern Ayacucho (Figure 1). Here another conically shaped stone of gray andesite with a carved base was found. This stone was similar in both size and shape to those found at Incapirqa/Waminan. It mea­sures 23 .4 cm in height by 13. 9 cm in width by 11.4 cm in depth. Its worked base is oval and measures 
7.3 x 5.9 cm. It was found on the surface some 30 m southwest of the platform. This site is on a moun­taintop at 587682-8472614 (UTM), 4,349 m asl, and comprises a single-tier platform measuring 
18. 1 x 9.8 m with a wall width of ca .. 65 m. The walls stand . 7 4 m above the level of the turf, and its long axis is orientated on 3 l 9°W. The structure is built of polygonal stone ashlars, and a row of cor­bels projects from the top of the wall. The stonework is characteristic of the late Horizon Inca tradition. Two circular chullpa structures, made of modified fieldstone, lie nearby, west and south of the platform. In one of these, fragments of a human femur and skull were found. 
The major Inca center of Huanucopama is located at ca. 3,800 m asl some 150 km northwest of the modem city of Huanaco (Figure 1). Here excavations by Jose-Luis Pino Matos have uncov­ered the remains of four child burials individually placed in grave or offering cuts in the top of the usnu platform in the central plaza. These burials are likely to represent capac hucha interments. A conically shaped stone similar to the lncapirqa/Waminan ones was recovered from a layer of rubble found in the platform, possibly serv­ing to increase drainage of libation offerings (Jose­Luis Pino Matos, personal communication 2008). 
At the site of Cochasquf, located ca. 50 km northeast of Quito (Figure I) at an altitude ranging from 2,960 to 3,080 m asl, a series of 15 rectan­gular earth built truncated pyramids ( tolas) are pre­sent, nine of which have access ramps up to 200 m long on their south sides. The site dates to the late Intermediate period and late Horizon and includes burial mounds and habitation remains. It is located in a region where numerous Inca hill forts are found, many of which are associated with usnu-type plat­forms. The largest pyramid (E) was first recorded by Max Uhle in the 1930s and interpreted by him as an Inca sun temple. Excavations at pyramid E by Oberem and Wurster in the 1960s uncovered a pair of circular structures, 9.7 m and 16.7 m in diameter, respectively, on its summit. These had pairs of fire-baked linear features measuring 1.94, 2.92, 5.74, and 6.39 min length and between .35 and .5 min width. In cross section these are stepped with a central trough-like depression. The troughs lie on opposing sides of the structures and have identical orientations, with the longer ones being near north-south and the shorter ones on a north­northeast by south-southwest alignment. The shorter ones had two groups of small circular pits in a triangular configuration, and the larger ones had similar cut features in groups of four and five. Several of these still had conically shaped stones of similar dimensions to the ones excavated at Incapirqa/Waminan inserted into them. The exca­vators interpreted these as hearth stones, although they do not preclude the possibility of other rea­sons for their presence (Oberem and Wurster 1989:58-60). Albert Meyers (2007:225-238) in a later essay suggests that these troughs and a simi­lar feature at the site of Samaipata in Bolivia served as a focus for a libation or a burning ritual. 
In the British Museum's collections there is a large circular stone cocha, 50 cm in diameter (67 cm including the handles) and 18 cm high, bear­ing carved and engraved scenes on opposing sides of the vessel (AM1909, 0403.1 [Figure 13; McE­wan 2009:92-93]). The first comprises 12 human figures-six frontal and six in profile. Centrally placed in the upper register is the sun, animated with a "face." Directly below this are two profile kneel­ing figures with their hands clasped before them

on either side of a trapezoidal cult object also with a "face" replicating that on the sun above (Figure 14 ). The other figures include both male and female attendants with hunchbacked parasol bearers at the extremities. The scene depicted on the opposite side of the vessel shows seven standing figures flanked by two camelids. The central figures are a high-status male and female couple. All the frontally placed individuals wear large ear orna­ments. The shape of this large monolithic vessel is characteristically Inca. The style of the decorative scenes on the vessel suggests a postconquest date. 
The scene may represent the deployment of a stone cult object as the focus of a solar ritual similar to those described by the early chroniclers. 
Concluding Discussion­
Materializing Cosmology 

We have noted some of the early ethnohistoric accounts that describe revered stone objects vari­ously said to resemble a "sugarloaf' (Betanzos), a "pineapple" or "cone" ( de Vega), and a "bowling pin" (Albornoz). The shape and size of the conical stones found at Incapirqa/Waminan, Aquqasa, and Huanucopampaclosely match these descriptions of the stone forms oflnca ancestors such as Ayar Auca (Staller 2008:289). The context and significance of the objects excavated at Incapirqa/Waminan are illuminated by the chroniclers' descriptions of the stone sculptures as deified ancestors. These are inti­mately linked to the usnu complex as a focus of the annual round of solar rituals, specifically the sol­stitial celebrations in June and December and the equinoctial festivities in August/September. In these settings the objects were intimately linked to the times when the sun was resting or sitting. An identification of this form of effigy with the usnu itself has been made by Protzen and Rowe (1994). 
. 
The discovery of the offering stones in archae­ological context at the Incapirqa/Waminan plat­form corroborates the association of the conical stone and the usnu described by Betanzos in Cuzco. Likewise the vertical shaft at Incapirqa/Waminan archaeologically confirms Zuidema's identifica­tion of this as an integral aspect of the usnu com­plex. At the Inca capital the "stone ancestors" were deployed in the performances enacted around the usnu at key moments in the ritual calendar. They served to reinforce the vertical connections among celestial, earthly, and chthonic realms, linking the deities of the sky above (the sun, moon, thunder, and creator deity, among others) with the people and contemporary world and with the world of the ancestors down below. These performances revolved around the inca in his role as the "axis mundi" or, in his place, the stone ancestors. 
At Incapirqa/Waminan the excavation of a deep shaft through the platform fills down to the deposit of sacred "stone ancestors" can be understood within the wider context of Andean concepts of rec­iprocity and public generosity. The hole cut into the bedrock can be viewed as an eye into uku pacha­the world of the ancestors-and analogous to the way in which cave shrines are used to facilitate con­tact and communication with the subterranean ancestral realm (see van de Guchte 1990: 162-165). An essential function of the usnu was to feed the ancestors in uku pacha; by fulfilling their obliga­tion the populace could expect support, protection, and fertility in return (Ramirez 2005:94). The cir­culation of sacred essence or camaquen, sami, samay or wasisami, or enqa is fundamental to Andean culture (Allen 1988:207-208; Bolin 1998:xiii, 9, 36, passim; de la Vega and Stanish 2002:270; Flores Ochoa 1977:211-237; John Staller, personal communication 2008). The latter term appears to be a variant of the word Inca, appro­priated by the Incas as an expression signifying "source of well-being or abundance" (Cavern 2001:160; Flores Ochoa 1977:84; Staller 2008:275). The circulation of this animating essence is instrumental in forging the bond between the populace and the animating forces of the envi­ronment. The bond between descendants and their ancestors is considered vital to maintain the stability and benefits of this relationship. The provision of libations at Haucaypata in Cuzco to both dead ancestors and the sun can be seen in a similar light. It also reinforces the legitimacy of the claim that people can make on vital subsistence resources in the landscape. Openhandedness and gifting create obligation; rulers were required to show conspic­uous generosity to their subjects in order to assure loyalty and secure tribute. Failure to do so can result in dire consequences, as illustrated when Guayna Capac's nobles came out in open rebellion against him at the time of his campaign against the Carangui. The reason for the upheaval lay in the perceived lack of generosity on the part of Guayna

Capac, who was not just a ruler but, as son of the sun, also a deity (Cabello Valboa 1951:371-379 [1586)). Invested with divine authority the ruler acts on the same plane as the huacas, apus, and ancestor deities. We suggest therefore that the inca's relationship with provincial lords and their sub­jects was mediated through the agency of the usnu in order to secure and manage local labor and resources. 
Confirmation of the existence of "stone ances­tors" at other usnu sites at Aquqasa/Mesayocpata and Huanucopampa establishes a link between rit­ual performance at usnu platforms in plazas in provincial capitals and administrative centers and the isolated high-altitude platforms on mountain­tops. This corroboratesAlbomoz's assertion that the stones functioned within the context of public plazas at major settlements as well as at remote, far-flung locations along the Inca road system. We suggest that the high-altitude platforms were empowered by the buried stone ancestors who needed to be respected and fed. Rituals and offer­ings are instrumental in the maintenance of cos­mological equilibrium and enable the circulation of animating essence among spiritual entities through space (Allen 1988 :49-50; Staller 2008:276). The stone trinity placed at the opening into the world of the ancestors metaphorically demonstrates this purpose and is designed to main­tain cosmological equilibrium between the trans­formative aspects of the sun Inti and the ancestors. Collectively the usnu platforms played a vital role in Inca imperial strategy and were instrumental in appropriating the rich resources of the high puna pastoralists and bringing this productive capacity under effective Inca control.
