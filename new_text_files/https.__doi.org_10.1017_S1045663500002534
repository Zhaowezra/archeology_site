THE ECONOMIC GEOGRAPHY OF CHERT LITHIC PRODUCTION IN 
THE SOUTHERN MAYA LOWLANDS: A COMPARATIVE 
EXAMINATION OF EARLY-STAGE REDUCTION DEBRIS 

C. Scott Speal 
It has been known for several decades that certain regions of the Maya Lowlands were characterized by specialized pro­duction of chert tools in ancient times. The extent, intensity, organization, and net social effects of centralized lithic pro­duction in the Maya area as a whole, however, are not well understood. In order to address issues of broader relevance to social and economic processes, lithicists working in the Maya region need to develop analytical approaches suited to the study of complex economies. The research presented here attempts to establish simple baseline measures for use in com­paring the production of siliceous stone tools, both formal and expedient, at different 
scales across the Maya area. Schol­arship in this region has been chronically plagued by prolonged, unresolved debates-mostly a factor ()f the multitude of single-site-focused projects employing different 
methodologies and research emphases. The present study therefore pro­poses a new direction in Maya lithic studies with the goal of enhancing comparability of data on ancient economic struc­ture through the use of standardized statistics that facilitate spatial analysis. Using the proportion of early-stage core reduction debris to the total of all debitage from a given context, for instance, enables the analyst to roughly assess the amount of tool manufacture taking place locally. By extension, inferences can be made about the degree of economic integration and inter­dependence characterizing any given geographic scale, including the architectural group, site, region, and so on. Prelimi­nary analysis of patterns in early-stage reduction illustrates differential spatial distributions ()f chert tool production and consumption at several scales from across the southern Lowlands, allowing for the refinement of current models of ancient Maya lithic economy. 
Se ha sabido por varias decadas que en tiempos antiguos ciertas regiones de las tierra bajas Mayas estuvieron caracterizadas por la producci6n especializada de herramientas de silex. Los alcances, la intensidad, la organizaci6n, y los efectos sociales de la producci6n centralizada en el drea Maya coma una totalidad, sin embargo, no son bien comprendidos. Para poder intro­ducir en temas de mayor importancia a las estudiantes de antiguas organizaciones socioecon6micas, las investigadores de tecnologfa Utica que trabajan en la regi6n Maya necesitan desarollar acercamientos anaUticos adecuados al estudio de economfas complejas. Este estudio intenta establecer algunas mediciones sencillas que pueden ser usadas para comparar la producci6n de implementos de Utica lasqueada, ya sea de maneraformal o rdpida, a diferentes escalas geograficas. De esta manera, se propane tomar una nueva direcci6n con el prop6sito de aumentar la comparaci6n de los datos sabre las antiguas estructuras econ6micas mediante el uso de estadfsticas estandardizadas que faciliten el andlisis espacial. El andlisis entre la proporci6n de residuos que resultan de las primeras etapas reducci6n de! nucleo y la totalidad de! dehitage en un determi­nado contexto, permite al especialista en Utica determinar de manera burda la cantidad de herramientas que fueron manu­facturadas localmente. Con base en ello, se pueden hacer inferencias sabre el grado de integraci6n econ6mica y de interdependencia que caracterice a cualquier escala geogrdfica, incluyendo el grupo arquitect6nico, el sitio, la regi6n, etc. El 
andlisis de las patrones de las primeeras etapas de reducci6n ilustra las diferencias espaciales de producci6n y consumo de herramientas de silex a diferentes escalas par todas las tierras bajas.

economic structure in precolumbian times. Despite well over a century of archaeological and epi­graphic research, the organization of production of basic goods and extent of economic specialization in craft manufacture during the Classic period and earlier remain poorly understood. 
Questions regarding economic integration and interdependence directly pertain to the level of sociopolitical complexity that should be afforded to Classic Maya polities (Fox et al. 1996; Freidel 1981; Masson and Freidel 2002; Sanders and Sant­ley 1983; Websterand Sanders 200 I). The presence of centralized exchange systems and specialization in craft production have been long-standing marks of social complexity (Childe 1951; Durkheim 1984 [1884]; Smith 1976 [1776]). But issues have been raised in recent years about exactly what is consti­tuted by these terms, their saliency as an indicator of complexity, and sometimes even the value of employing them altogether (Clark and Parry 1990; Costin 199 1, 200 I). It has become increasingly clear, for example, that scale, intensity, context of production, and organizing principles of the pro­duction system-among other things-are impor­tant considerations in ascertaining how specialization is constituted and what its exact ram­ifications are for the wider economic system. Fur­thermore, we cannot assume ancient Maya economies to have been uniform across space or static through time (Blanton et al. 1996; Marcus 
1993). Only dynamic studies that can evaluate diachronic and synchronic variation will be ade­quate in the long run. 
Clark and Parry (1990) argue that elite control over craft manufacture is one potential causal fac­tor in the rise of class-based social stratification cross-culturally. Given that patronized and attached production arrangements-in which artisans are beholden to high-ranking individuals or households-are known to occur in less complex, rank-based political systems, intervention in a local economy by an elite class is likely to pose a criti­cal element in the evolution of specialized pro­duction. Unfortunately, the classification of craft specialists as independent vs. attached, as with the nature of specialization itself, is neither simple or straightforward (Lewis 1996). Furthermore, there are some forms of specialization that do not nec­essarily imply any type of hierarchical organiza­tion. Community-based specialization, for instance, the most commonly documented type of special­ized arrangement in the Maya area, can arise even in the absence of hierarchy between distinct ethnic groups as independent communities come to com­plement one another economically (0'Shea 1989). 
Over the years, there have been a number of studies of ancient Maya economy treating basic diachronic changes and regional relationships (Braswell and Glascock 2002; Masson 200la; Rathje 1972; Sidrys 1976; Tourtellot and Sabloff 1972; West 2002). Many of the more influential early examples were necessarily simple and gen­eralized, as they were conducted before large amounts of archaeological data from many sites and contexts were available. Since then, such research has tended to focus upon either ceramics or obsid­ian (but see Potter and King 1995 and Rice 1987 for more synthetic approaches). Yet ceramics are notoriously difficult to source, making them a poor medium for investigating the context of production. Obsidian, on the other hand, is an exotic import everywhere in the Maya Lowlands and therefore of lesser use to those interested in studying the organization of local or regional production sys­tems. 
Previous Research and Models of Ancient Maya Chert Lithic Economy 
Specialized production of chert lithic tools in the Maya area has been thoroughly documented, at least along the Classic period political periphery of modem-day northern Belize, since the late 1970s (Hester and Shafer 1984, 1994; Shafer and Hester 
1983, 1991 ). Yet discoveries of large specialized lithic workshops in other regions have been few and far between (Ford and Olsen 1989; Lewis 2003; Potter 1993 ), leaving scholars to wonder at how rep­resentative this region was of the Maya area as a whole in terms of economic organization. In fact, broad comparative studies of chert lithic assem­blages in the Maya area are almost completely absent (but see Rovner 1975). 
This is unfortunate, as there are a number of advantages to the employment of chert lithic analy­sis as a method of insight to ancient economic processes. To begin with, siliceous stone is a remarkably stable material of low perishability, which reduces problems of preservation that adversely affect so many other media, including

ceramics with regard to surface treatment. Second, lithic manufacture is a reductive technology­meaning that the knapping process invariably leaves archaeologically recoverable waste. Differ­ent stages of productiion and maintenance leave distinct diagnostic elements that provide informa­tion on various aspects of the manufacturing process through inspection of debitage (Andrefsky 1998, 2001; Whittaker 1994). Third, distribution and exchange can be traced through raw material sourcing (Andrefsky 1998:40-44; Luedtke 1992:Appendix A), and this can often be achieved through visual assessment by a lithicist familiar with the geology of the region. Fourth, artifact con­sumption can be evaluated using methods of use­wear analysis (Hayden 1979; Keeley 1980; Sala 
1996; Vaughn 1985), meaning that systemic roles of particular artifact types can be directly investi­gated. In spite of all these advantages, the study of chert tools and debitage remains an afterthought in the research design of most projects in the Maya area. 

Considerable progress in the understanding of Maya chert lithic economies was made during the 1980s and 1990s, with a basic model of regional exchange formulated based upon research at the site of Colha (Gibson 1986; Hester and Shafer 1984; Shafer and Hester 1983). Since that time, the "producer-consumer" model-an analytical para­digm developed by the senior investigators at Colha-has become the prevailing theoretical rubric of chert lithic analysis in the Maya area. Northern Belize is characterized by a large region of high-quality chert outcrops, known as the North­ern Belize Chert-Beruing Zone (NBCBZ), which produce a very distinctive, fine-grained deep brown, tan, gray, or banded material that has proven to be visually sourceable (Cackler et al. 1999; Tobey 1994). The distinctiveness of the raw material, along with careful examination of the morphology of local products (Hester 1985; Michaels 1987; Shafer 1991 ), allowed the geographical distribution of workshop implements to outlying sites to be established. This led to the classification of settle­ments into lithic "producers" and "consumers" based upon evidence for formal tool production in specialized workshops at Colha and a few other sites sitting atop the NBCBZ, along with the pur­ported lack thereof at outlying sites in the sur­rounding region (Dockall and Shafer 1993; Hester 
et al. 199 l; Hult and Hester 1995; McAnany 1989; Shafer 1980, 1983). Using this approach, the Colha Project was the first to establish the presence of spe­cialized production of crafted goods in the Maya area. Subsequent studies used these same basic principles to distinguish between separate spheres of luxury and utilitruian consumption (Hester and Shafer 1994; Santone 1997; Shafer and Hester 1991). 
Yet, while it has served well to elucidate these issues, the producer-consumer model has also given rise to new analytical problems. For instance, the term consumer has come to imply a lack of local formal tool production, begging the question of what constitutes a "formal" tool. Given that the typology for northern Belize was developed based upon research at Colha, it is perhaps unsurprising that many of the implements found at outlying sites are not classified as such. Second, establishing a site's "consumer" role often consists of demon­strating the statistical similarity of its debitage assortment to an idealized nonproducer assemblage (e.g., Aoyama 1999; Dockall and Shafer 1993), when it is systematically established at all. This approach tacitly assumes that ancient Maya com­munities are easily dichotomized into sites that pro­duce formalized implements and those that do not. 
The producer-consumer model also gives min­imal regard to the production of informal imple­ments for expedient use, though acknowledging its presence at virtually every site, implying that for­mal tools were of greater economic importance. As illustrated elsewhere (Speal 2006), this approach tends to spotlight a single regional locus of formal tool production while local, domestic manufacture is downplayed at any site that does not manifest evidence of specialized workshops. Because it does not adequately consider expedient production of ad hoc tools, its conclusions are likely to not reflect the whole lithic economy. Moreover, the producer­consumer approach in its present form lacks a quan­titative dimension. How much local production makes a site a producer ? How much constitutes a consumer ? What kind of vruiation is there within the two categories? 
A simple dualistic approach also does not artic­ulate well with more sophisticated ethnographic and historically based models of economy designed for cross-cultural compruison (Costin 1991, 2001; Smith l 976a, I 976b ). Such models consider alter-

native organizational modes and scales of produc­tion, intensity of specialization, and the manner in which these are related to exchange practices. In this sense, the producer-consumer model as it is cur­rently formulated is not well suited to addressing issues of current interest to most Mayanists-such as the organization of production, the nature and degree of elite involvement in the economy, and the relative importance of various mechanisms of exchange. Still, producer-consumer thought has served lithicists well in the past on many levels, is simple to grasp, and is firmly entrenched in the minds of many researchers. Rather than discarding it altogether then, this article attempts to modify it in order to address the weaknesses laid out above. 
One sense in which the producer-consumer approach has advanced lithic research in the Maya area is through study of site interaction at a regional scale. Archaeological perspectives in this part of the world are notoriously site specific. Models designed to explain patterns or processes are most often based upon work at a particular Maya center and tend to reflect the experiences and preferences of one set of investigators. Arguments for or against certain characterizations of ancient Maya society are often made in a grab-bag fashion-selectively including particular examples while conveniently ignoring others. With regard to economic structure and process, standards of quantification have not yet been presented that might permit interregional and diachronic comparison of fundamental eco­nomic data. The present study aims to help fill this gap by examining local chert lithic production from the perspective of debitage assemblages at multi­ple scales from across the Maya region. It attempts to methodologically establish quantifiable "gauges" of lithic production, consumption, and exchange that can be easily derived at any level of analysis. 
Early-Stage Reduction Debitage and Its Util­ity in Modeling the Geography of Production 
Because of its value in establishing the locus and context of initial tool production, the primary mea­surement to be examined here is the proportion of early-stage reduction (ESR) debris to total diag­nostic flakes in an assemblage. There are a num­ber of commonly used methods of quantifying ESR. These include measurements of the frequency 
of cortex on flakes, typological studies that clas­sify on the basis of morphology, and grading on the basis of flake size. All of these analytical systems, and others, can be found in use in the Maya area. 
Proportions of cortical debitage are widely acknowledged to be informative with regard to the presence of initial core reduction and the earliest stages of stone tool production (Ahler 1989:90; Andrefsky 1998:103-104; Johnson 1989; Shott 1994 ). This principle is based on the relatively sound assumption that the rough exterior of a nod­ule of siliceous stone must be removed before the smooth, more malleable interior can be reached in the process of manufacturing a biface. Interior flakes also manifest sharper cutting edges (Andref­sky 2001: 11 ), often making them a more desirable target for expedient tools. Furthermore, the reduc­tive process of resharpening and recycling in the manufacturing sequence of any lithic object gen­erally results in the elimination of cortex from a core earlier in the life history of an artifact. While this does not mean that the amount of cortex on any particular flake is necessarily indicative of the stage of manufacture in which it was removed, experi­mental studies have shown that higher frequencies of cortex generally correlate with the earlier stages of core reduction (Magne and Pokotylo 1981; Mauldin and Amick 1989; Odell 1989). 
Yet there are other important factors to be taken into account in the interpretation of this value. Besides stage of reduction, proportions of cortex in an assemblage may be expected to vary accord­ing to initial cobble size and shape, reduction strat­egy, desired product form, and extent of tool curation and recycling (Bradbury and Carr 
1995:112; Dibble et al. 2005; McAnany 1988; Sul­livan and Rozen 1985:756;,Tomka 1989). Tapho­nomic influences such as the removal of large flakes from an assemblage for use, exchange, or further reduction at another locale are another potential consideration. Larger flakes, which tend to be pro­duced in the earliest stages of reduction, may be underrepresented if they were collected for expe­dient use elsewhere and/or further reduced into other tool forms (Magne 1989: 17). Yet these com­plications need not be a liability in analysis, for if other factors can be assumed constant, or changes in their influence can be estimated, then one can be reasonably confident that variability in stage of pro­duction taking place locallly is the phenomenon

being measured. And vice versa, if the degree of initial reduction can be assumed to be a constant­as at quarry loci or formal tool-production work­shops, for instance-then inferences can be made to the relative importance of other variables (Fig­ure 1). 
Typological approaches are more precise, allow­ing for the differentiation of a number of further factors in the significance of a particular flake, such as whether it was removed from a biface or a spher­ical core and what proportion of the surface is cov­ered with cortex. Additional considerations of flake morphology-such as platform angle and size, number of previous flake scars on the dorsal sur­face, and overall flake size-make for the greatest accuracy in inferring the point in the reduction process at which flakes were being removed. Typo­logical definitions, however, vary markedly and are more time consuming, and simple rates of cortex on flakes are more commonly reported than other, more detailed information. In the end, of course, measures of cortex and morphological assessment ofearly-stage reduction are highly correlated since amount of cortex present is the dominant criterion in classification of a flake as primary or secondary debitage. Estimates of ESR on the basis of pro­portion of cortical debris, morphology, and size 
have all been considered in this study. Proportions of early-stage reduction based upon a full range of criteria have been employed wherever possible. Still, debitage data can be presented in many dif­ferent ways, and it was often necessary to perform a few calculations in order to put the values in equivalent formats. The study was further limited by the few sites and regions for which published chert debitage data of a comparable nature could be located. 
Data 
John Clark's (1991) ethnoarchaeological investi­gation oflithic production among the Lacandon liv­ing in the small towns of Naja and Mensabak, Chiapas, provides a convenient departure point. His data provide information on the frequencies of ESR debris deposited archaeologically as by­products of chert tool manufacture under docu­mented conditions among the Maya themselves. Clark conducted analyses of debris from a number of inhabited and recently abandoned households under consultation with the current and former occupants, so circumstances of manufacture and disposal are known. In the Lacandon case, raw material was quarried and tested for quality at the

source, with suitable nodules then selected and car­ried back to the village. Knapping was generally performed within the domicile or upon an outdoor patio surface. Debitage was typically discarded in waste dumps away from the residence. 
Five different workshop contexts were sampled, representing three different craftsmen (Table 1). Frequencies of cortical debitage ranged from 23 to 44 percent, with a median value of 37 percent (Clark 1991 :26 1-264 ). The goal ofknapping activ­ity was projectile points for use in the manufacture of bows and arrows for the tourist trade, though such items were supposedly still principal hunting implements as late as the 1950s. The reduction technique involved indirect percussion of short blades, from which small stemmed points are pro­duced through retouch. Though no specific infor­mation on initial core size was available, there are indications that this did not vary much among indi­viduals (Clark 1991:264 ). The craft is best described in organizational terms as a cottage industry, defined as part-time specialization under­taken in the household for limited trade purposes or domestic production for exchange (Clark and Parry 1990). 
Diachronic Examination of Archaeological 
Patterns in ESR from Northern Belize 
Table 2 presents proportions of early-stage reduc­tion debris in archaeological chert debitage assem­blages compiled for comparative purposes from across the Maya Lowlands. These data have been extracted from various sources in the literature, each cited within the table. In order to maintain comparability to the greatest possible extent, early­stage reduction was defined as total primary and secondary flakes when multiple lines of morpho­logical inference are available and total cortical flakeage when they are not. Some data, such as those from Lewis (1995) on the Programme for Belize grounds in the Three Rivers region, are based upon flake size. Percentages are of total diagnos­tic flakes, broken down by raw material type when such information was available. The geographic location of these sites and areas can be examined using Figure 2. 
The earliest well-documented lithic assemblage from a settlement in northern Belize that we might confidently call Maya comes from Cuello, which developed over the course of the Middle and Late Formative periods. It has been suggested that chert cores entered the community in unprocessed or minimally processed form and that raw materials were acquired from multiple sources, including the NBCBZ (McSwain 199 la, 1991b:Tables 9 .2-9 .3). Members of the Colha Project disputed these find­ings based upon the formal tool assemblage, argu­ing that Cuello-even during this early period-was a typical "consumer" site (Hester and Shafer 1994:56). They maintain that NBCBZ flake debris was strictly a product of recycling Colha workshop products. High proportions of cortex on both NBCBZ chert and local stone during the Mid­dle Formative, however, make this position prob­lematic. Cortical frequencies do decrease slightly through time, and increased standardization in tool form reveals a higher order of integration into a regional economic sphere by the Late Formative period (McSwain 1991b). But overall, the propor­tions of early-stage reduction debitage suggest a low dependence upon the Colha workshops for tool needs at Cuello during the Formative relative to northern Belize sites from later periods. 
Santa Rita Corozal is another Formative period "consumer" site. A relatively high frequency of cortical debitage is found in Late Formative con­texts here as well. Dockall and Shafer found "no aborted preforms or bifaces broken in various stages of manufacture, nor is there evidence for the manufacture of blades or macroblades. No poly­hedral blade cores, plunging blades, or core­rejuvenation flakes are present in the assemblage" (1993: 168). Though cores of both chert and chal­cedony were recovered from Santa Rita, indicat­ing some amount of local lithic production, the analysts ( 1993: 170) argue that those of chert are less numerous and can be identified as recycled biface fragments. Yet this is curious given that NBCBZ chert debitage retains a considerably higher proportion of cortex at the site than does

locally available chalcedony (Dockal! and Shafer 1993: 168). 
Judging from the lower proportions ofESR deb­itage at Cerros, this predominantly Late Formative site was reliant to a greater degree on external lithic production loci than either Cuello or Santa Rita Corozal (Mitchum 1991:Table 1). Even so, the site was not completely dependent upon finished for­mal tools from specialized workshops. Informal, ad hoc implements form the majority of stone tools at Cerros; and cores, bifacial blanks, macroflakes, and blades are all present (Lewenstein 1987 :Table 25), some ofNBCBZ material (Mitchum 1994). Lewen­stein (1987:202) surmises that households gener­ally produced and maintained a wide range of lithic implements for their own use. While the chert­bearing zone is about 37 km away from Cerros at its closest point, there are outcrops of chalcedony within 20 km of the site (Mitchum 1991 :45). Either way, any raw material reduced locally would have to be imported or directly procured. 
While its coastal location probably gave Cerros easier access to trade routes than inland sites like Cuello, this does not explain its contrast with the equally coastal site of Santa Rita-only a few kilo­meters farther from the chert-bearing zone on the same bay. Cerros's enhanced political standing, as reflected in ornate architectural facades with regal iconography (Freidel et al. 2002; Lewenstein 
1987:202; Schele and Freidel 1990:96-129), there­fore better explains its greater access and reliance upon externally produced tools. Participation in lithic exchange networks at Cerros is thought to have decreased after the Late Formative as the site went into decline (Lewenstein 1987: 165)-even as the Colha workshops continued to boom­further suggesting that political prominence was playing a larger role in product distribution than local raw material availability. Cerros also mani­fests some interesting intrasite spatial variation in ESR, in that contexts closer to the site center (Oper­ations 1 and 34) reveal lower percentages of corti­cal debris than outlying areas (Operation 107). 
In comparison, however, ESR statistics from the definitive "producer" community in northern Belize, Colha, show an immense degree of intra­site variability. Late Formative workshops at the site yield a surprisingly low proportion of primary and secondary decortication flakes for formal tool­production contexts. A sample of complete and platform-bearing flakes from Operation 2024, a Late Formative workshop, produced about 9 per­cent of these debitage classes (Dockal! and Shafer 
1993:162). This is corroborated by two column samples from excavations at the Operation 2006 workshop middens (Nash 1980:Table 6; Shafer l 979:Table 6). Both workshops produced formally defined Tranchet adzes, Stemmed blades, and Oval Biface celts. The relative dearth ofESR at the Colha workshops has traditionally been explained through decortication activity at outlying quarry sites (Shafer and Hester 1983). 
Such quarry loci were eventually documented in the Colha Operation 4040 excavations, both of which produced extremely high frequencies of early-stage reduction debris dating to the Late Clas­sic period (Masson 1989, 200 1b). Cortical fre­quencies of as high as 55 percent were recovered from certain lots in these workshop contexts asso­ciated with a potential quarry pit/water-retention basin (Masson 2001b:Figure 7). Taken as discrete entities, SubOperations 5 and 9 from Operation 4040 produced frequencies expected of initial reduction at 32 and 40 percent, respectively (Mas­son 1989:Table 8). SubOperation 1 and the nearby Operation 4045 SubOperation 2 manifested pro­portions more typical of the Colha workshops at 
16-18 percent (see also Nash 1980:Table 6). 
A composite proportion of ESR debris statistic for Colha as a whole is presented in Table 2 based upon data extracted from Shafer 1979, Nash 1980, Masson 1989, and Dockal! and Shafer 1993. This rather low proportion of ESR for the Maya flag­ship producer site (24 percent) may partially reflect the larger nodule sizes available from the area of high-quality chert-bearing soils in the vicinity of Colha (Hester and Shafer 1984). It is in all likeli­hood, however, predominantly a consequence of the lack of excavated quarry loci at the site. Oper­ation 4040 is the only confirmed initial reduction locus at Colha to date (Masson 200lb:38), though alone it would certainly not have been capable of completely supplying even the Classic period work­shops. It therefore seems reasonable to postulate the existence of other nearby quarry sites with high proportions of early-stage reduction that remain uninvestigated, including some that were operat­ing during Formative times. Furthermore, there is no evidence for changes in raw material selection or reduction technology between Formative and

Classic times, and final target products are known to have remained essentially the same (with the exception of a trend of decreasing size in Stemmed blades and Oval bifaces [Hester 1985]). Assuming that the organization of production remained the same, we might also deduce that there were work­shop contexts with extremely low proportions of early-stage reduction during the Late Classic akin to those known from the Late Formative. Their absence here may be a reflection of the small num­ber of workshop contexts available for this study. The same reasoning may apply to contexts with moderate frequencies of cortical debris in the For­mative period, which are well documented during the Late Classic. 
Pulltrouser Swamp was one of the first estab­lished consumers of Colha lithic tools (Shafer 1983) and is probably the best case for a depen­dent site from a lithic perspective in northern Belize. The strong economic relationship between the two sites was apparently a result of reliance upon imported stone implements for intensive local raised-field agricultural production (McAnany 1986, I989). McAnany ( l 989:Table 4) points out that while only 6 percent of NBCBZ debitage manifests cortex, it remains on 42 per­cent of chalcedony flakes. While she ( 1989:Table 2) asserts that primary lithic reduction is indicated for chalcedony only, cores and complete nodules of both NBCBZ chert and chalcedonies are reported from Late to Terminal Classic deposits at the site. Furthermore, a considerable number of expedient flake tools were apparently produced at Pulltrouser Swamp despite its close exchange rela­tionship with Colha, raising the question of why it would be necessary to produce large amounts of ad hoc tools if the specialized workshops were supplying adequate numbers of formal ones. 
The sites of Ambergris Caye, Cabbage Ridge, and Northern River Lagoon are all coastal com­munities oriented toward the procurement of marine resources such as salt, fish, and shell (Mas­son and Mock 2004 ). Each is located within the Late-to-Terminal Classic primary consumer sphere of Colha and manifests tool forms indicative of trade with the northern Belize workshops (Hult and Hester 1995; Mock 1994a; Speal 2000, 2006). Unsurprisingly, all have very similar proportions of ESR debris (I4 percent, 15 percent, and 15 per­cent, respectively). These aggregate frequencies, however, are not as low as at Pulltrouser Swamp (12 percent), even though the latter site is known to have had access to local chalcedony. Since none of the coastal sites lies in immediate proximity to any known outcrops of siliceous stone, the pres­ence of ESR suggests at least some trade in, or direct procurement of, raw material from inland deposits. Cores of NBCBZ chert have been recov­ered from Cabbage Ridge (Speal 2006:Figure 12). 
The only Early Postclassic workshop at Colha for which appropriate debitage data could be located was at Operation 2001, where Oval biface production was the main emphasis. Two separate analyses of this same context were available, how­ever, yielding cortical debitage frequencies of 13 and 16 percent (Nash 1980:Table 6; Shafer 1979), which is only slightly lower than frequencies found at the Late Classic workshops. Again, there is an absence of known quarry loci. The continuity in sta­tistical modes of ESR is interesting given the idea that there is a major break in technology, reduction strategy, and product emphasis with the previous period-blade technology disappears, chal­cedonies become the preferred raw material, and pointed bifaces become common tool forms (Hes­ter 1985:201). This came at a time when Colha underwent at least one and possibly two episodes of violence during the Terminal Classic period apparently directed at the site's ruling elite (Bar­rett and Scherer 2005; Mock 1994b), reflected in mass deposits of human remains found within the site center. Barrett and Scherer (2005) argue that this violence was aimed at disrupting a flow of lithic "weaponry" from the Colha workshops. 
One potential confounding factor in compara­tive analysis arises from current understanding of Terminal Classic/Early Postclassic chronology in the Maya area, which has been thrown into a state of flux by a recent wave of revisionism. These views call into question the very existence of an Early Postclassic period on the basis that the two periods are not archaeologically distinct (Andrews et al. 2003). It is not immediately clear how this will eventually affect the older site-based chronology of Colha, but from the perspective of ESR propor­tions there are indeed no evident distinctions between the two periods, and they will be treated jointly here. It may also be noted that there is a lack of significant change in frequencies of cortical deb­itage at Colha between the Late Classic and Early

Postclassic despite the documented changes in raw material and product emphasis at the site. This may be related either to the dating issues just outlined or imply that such changes do not necessarilyresult in significant corresponding fluctuations in pro­portions of ESR debris. 
Occupation at the small northern Belize lagoon site of Caye Coco spans the Terminal Classic "col­lapse." Though the site has been labeled a "con­sumer" community, with reference to the proportion of tertiary reduction as "overwhelm­ing" (Oland 2000: 134 ), analyses reveal an increas­ing reliance on local siliceous materials by Postclassic times (Oland et al. 2000:142). In fact, imported northern Belize chert makes up only 15 percent of the flakes recovered throughout the Post­classic, with all the rest coming from local chal­cedonies. The major break with earlier conditions seems to appear in Middle and Late Postclassic contexts in northern Belize, when the proportion of core reduction at Caye Coco increases substan­tially (McGreevy 2001). 
Yet the Colha workshops are thought to have been abandoned in Late Postclassic times (Hester 1985), rendering the consumer designation of a Late Postclassic settlement problematic in the absence of a known producer site. The effects of Colha's demise can be most readily observed in the debitage assemblage of Late Postclassic Laguna de On (Masson 2000). The high frequencies of ESR debris demonstrate the complete realignment of the regional economy in northern Belize away from reliance upon specialized workshops. Their extreme values probably also reflect changes in reduction strategy, as small side-notched projectile points and core tools came to dominate the assem­blage and chert blade technology fell out of use. Proportional differences in early-stage reduction debris between the historic Lacandon and Late Postclassic Laguna de On are attributable to vari­ation in the range of desired target products and, in all likelihood, the raw material at hand. The Lacan­don were almost exclusively interested in projec­tile points for sale to tourists, while woodworking tools and core choppers were also important to Late Postclassic Belizeans. Unfortunately, little infor­mation was found regarding the raw material employed by the Lacandon, but given the geo­graphical distance and the geological differences between the two landscapes, there are likely to have 
been significant disparities. 
There is a clear diachronic pattern to the north­ern Belize data. The wax and wane of regional eco­nomic interdependence in flaked chert implements are apparent in a simple diachronic arrangement of specialized workshop (all Colha) vs. nonworkshop contexts (Figure 3). Empirically undocumented Formative period quarry contexts that theoretically must have existed, and middle-range workshop contexts that were postulated above, are presented as "missing Colha" and differentially shaded. When relative placement within each chronological period was ambiguous, contexts were iteratively placed in the position that best smooths the graph. It can be seen that, beginning in the Late Forma­tive, initial core reduction becomes increasingly scarce at most sites in northern Belize, while pro­portions and intrasite variability in ESR grow at Colha as a specialization in production intensifies there. This trend persists throughout the height of the Classic period and into the Terminal Classic. 
Higher rates of cortical debris return to outly­ing sites during the Postclassic period, postdating the episodes of violence directed at Colha's cere­monial center and its resident elite. The highest fre­quencies of ESR are found during the Late Postclassic, when the Colha workshops are quiet. This figure illustrates the almost complete collapse of the northern Belize chert lithic economy by Late Postclassic times. Aside from political disruptions at Colha, this situation was probably aggravated by the increased distance of the region from new eco­nomic core polities located in the northern Yucatan. Wider access to obsidian through long-distance trade during the Postclassic may also have been a factor. 
Furthermore, the substantial proportion ofESR at consumer sites calls into question the idea that virtually all NBCBZ flakeage in these contexts is a product of the recycling of Colha-produced for­mal tools (Dockall and Shafer 1993: 171; McAnany 1989:341 ). At some sites, such as Cabbage Ridge, primary and secondary flakes of NBCBZ chert occur even though the material does not outcrop locally. At others, including Santa Rita Corozal, proportions of cortex are actually greater on NBCBZ debitage than on local chalcedonies. This poses a dilemma, particularly if "bifaces manu­factured at Colha retained little to no cortex at the finished stage because cortex was removed early

in the manufacturing process" (Dockall and Shafer 1993: 170-171 ). In addition, raw NBCBZ chert has been recovered from contexts as distant as the cen­tral Peten, where Aldenderfer has suggested that "small whole nodules of northern Belize-zone cherts were shipped into center communities and were reduced by local craft specialists" (199 1: 139). Similar arguments have been made for the local reduction of NBCBZ chert at Tikal as well (Moholy-Nagy 199 1: 190). Evidence for a certain degree of local reduction of this material, mostly in domestic contexts for expedient or specially tai­lored tools, has also been documented at other sites just outside of the chert-bearing zone in several parts of northern Belize (McSwain 199lb:l94; Mitchum 1991 :5 1; Oland 1999: 100; Speal 2006). All of these facts suggest some degree of regional, and even supraregional, trade in raw NBCBZ chert. 
Comparing Regional Patterns of Early-Stage Reduction During the Late Classic 
A synchronic comparison of northern Belize early­stage reduction patterns with other regions during the Classic period stands to inform with regard to variation in economic structure across the Maya area. Above the coastal plain of northern Belize in the political core of the upland Peten, there is also evidence of considerable variation in amounts of local chert lithic knapping activity by site. In this part of of the Southern Lowlands, where popula­tions were large and monumental centers numer­ous, there are at present only two known loci of intensive lithic production that may have been of a magnitude similar to Colha-El Pedernal and El Pilar. Unfortunately, detailed lithic data have not been published from either site, leaving the orga­nization and intensity of specialized chert tool pro­duction poorly understood for the Classic period core regions. Little energy has been invested in chert lithic research by projects working in the Peten, and therefore much fewer data are available in comparison to northern Belize. There are, how­ever, a few relevant studies from which we can glean some insight. 
Aldenderfer ( 1991 ), for example, examined deb­itage from a series of sites in the Peten lakes region. Contexts around the monumental site core of Yaxha, politically the most prominent center in his (199 1:138-139, Table 6) study, are characterized by relatively high frequencies of 30-36 percent decortication flakes. Outlying settlements in the Yaxha area, excluding a few exceptional contexts, tended to have very low percentages ofESR. A very limited amount of production was found in smaller

outlying communities, such as Saknab and Salpe­ten. These potential "consumer" communities appear to have been much more dependent upon outside tool manufacture than those of northern Belize, despite the lack of known intensive work­shops in the immediate area. Thus, it appears that lithic production in the region may have nucleated around the monumental center, with considerable variability in degree of local production found in outlying rural contexts. 
Such findings are corroborated by research at nearby El Pilar, a large monumental center (albeit without stelae or other indications of political pri­macy) with substantial chert debitage workshop deposits right off the main plaza (Ford and Olsen 1989:202-203). While El Pilar is situated geo­graphically in close proximity to Naranjo and is likely to have been under the political sway of that major center, it is not inconceivable that some tools manufactured at El Pilar could have found their way to sites in the Pe ten lakes region. Y axha was, in fact, a political subordinate to Naranjo during much of the Late Classic period (Martin and Grube 2000:69-83). The dearth of lithic research at sites in the Peten precludes any statements about pat­tern of tool distribution there. 
Using somewhat different methods, Fedick (199l:Figure 2) obtained contrasting results from a transect between Yaxha and Tikal. His findings suggest that more early-stage reduction took place away from the urban centers and that "early stages of lithic reduction were more prevalent at house­holds located farther from major centers, while those situated closer to major centers were rela­tively more involved with the later stages of reduc­tion" (1991: 111 ). Unfortunately, his debitage data are presented in an ordinal system that does not per ­mit comparative use of them in this study. Spe­cialized lithic production workshops have not been documented at Tikal, though they are posited to have existed there (Moholy-Nagy 1991, 2003). 
Data from the Three Rivers region in the north­east Peten reveal a similar pattern to that found around the Peten lakes. Several intensive lithic workshops have been located near Rio Azul at a site known as El Pedernal (Black 1987; Black and Subler 1986; Lewis 2003). Enticing reports of spe­cialized production at this Late Classic minor cen­ter continue to go without in-depth investigation. The bulk of production there is thought to have been oriented toward bifacial celts for local distribution to support raised-field agricultural activity; the site is thought to have been the main provider for the Rio Azul regional polity. Other, smaller groups of lithic workshops in the Three Rivers region have been found near the minor center of Chan Chich on the Rio Bravo in western Belize (Meadows 2000). The focal products of these workshops were the Small Oval biface and General Utility biface­both utilitarian agricultural and land-clearing implements-and the Narrow biface, which, in addition to possible utilitarian functions, poten­tially represents an offensive weapon. Cortical fre­quencies in samples from these workshops calculated using data from Meadows's (2000:Appendix B) excavations produce a result very similar to the contexts around Yaxha. 

Lithic production at smaller communities on the grounds of the Programme for Belize ecological preserve in the Three Rivers region has been exam­ined by Brandon Lewis (I995). Seven sites in this area were tested, ranging from single isolated house­holds to larger settlements with multiple patio groups. Lewis analyzed both tools and debitage for signs of local production, and five contexts are pre­sented in Table 1 based upon relative proportion of early-stage reduction debris as calculated from his ( 1995 :Table F.3) data. Though Lewis estimated ESR on the basis of flake size-the proportion of large (>1.5-in-long) flakes recovered through size grading-it is interesting to note that his results pat­tern rather well with the rest of the sites in this study. Most small communities in the Three Rivers region proved to be fairly dependent upon exchange for agricultural tools, though it is of interest that there are two rather distinct tiers ofESR among Lewis's sites, low (6--11 percent) and very low (-I percent). 
Though regional data from outlying sites in other parts of the Maya area are less detailed or alto­gether absent, a few studies of debitage assem­blages from large centers were found to complement this study. Clark and Bryant (1991) examined the lithic assemblage from the Late Clas­sic site of Yerba Buena on the western fringes of the southern Lowlands. They conclude that, although this large minor center was without any immediately available sources of raw material, the craftsmen at Yerba Buena were part-time produc­ers of lithic tools, primarily large projectile points, for their own households or those in nearby com-

munities only (Clark and Bryant 1991: 101). Using a composite of decortication flakes, primary flakes, and large bifacial flakes and subtracting tool frag­ments, preforms, cores, and raw material from their artifact total (Clark and Bryant 1991:Table 1), a fig­ure of 34 percent early-stage reduction debris was derived. This estimate is strikingly close to per­centages of early-stage reduction at the other Clas­sic period Peten major and minor administrative centers presented in Table 2. 
High frequencies of cortexed flakes found in a secondary midden near the urban core of Copan, Honduras, suggest lithic production within the con­fines of an administrative monumental center. Based upon application of a flake-size distribution analysis, a cache of 272 flakes recovered from beneath an altar was interpreted as having been displaced from a workshop dedicated to the man­ufacture of bifacial projectile points (Aoyama 1999: 167). Some 34 percent of the debitage from the deposit manifests cortex (Aoyama 1999:Table 
8. 16). In comparison, 26 percent of the intact flakes recovered from outlying excavations conducted by the Harvard Copan Valley Settlement Project retained cortex (Valdez and Potter 199 1 :Table 1 ). This assemblage from smaller communities repre­sents all stages of biface manufacture, suggesting an absence of specialized production of utilitarian chert tools in the region. Land-clearing and ground­working tools were apparently obtained instead in the form of ground-stone celts of serpentine and basalt. Our data therefore give only the scantiest notion of the organization of production in this region. While there is no evidence for centralized manufacture of utilitarian stone tools in the Copan region, it does appear that certain tool forms of greater concern to the elite-namely, pointed bifaces that could be used as weapons-were at least occasionally produced within the ceremonial center (see also Aoyama 2005). 
Statistical "Tiers" in Proportions of Early-Stage Reduction 
From the data presented in Tables 1 and 2, pro­portions of ESR debitage in the Maya area can be seen to aggregate around a number of different sta­tistical modes or "tiers." The highest rates of cor­tical debris are found at sites where either tool production or initial core reduction was taking place locally, such as ethnographically documented domestic production middens among the modem Lacandon, certain quarry locations at Colha, and workshop loci at a number of major and minor cen­ters. Percentages of ESR debris from these contexts tend to fall in the range of 30-40 percent and occa­sionally higher. Such sites are found across the Lowlands from times of the earliest sedentism­Middle Formative Cuello, Chan Chich and Yaxha in the Classic Peten, Yerba Buena on the western margin of the Maya area, Copan to the east, and Late Postclassic Laguna de On. Many of these sites, which we might call self-sustaining producers, pro­cured for themselves or imported raw siliceous stone for local reduction. Contexts characterized by this scale of early-stage reduction probably reflect either (a) independent production of stone tools autonomously sustaining local needs or contribut­ing to the support of a single polity or (b) localized contexts of specialized craft manufacture under the political influence of high-ranking houses or courts for the purpose of satisfying elite-mediated demands for particular goods. 
Not all producer sites can be considered equal. The multiple tiers of production at Colha have already been mentioned above but might better be observed graphically (Figure 4). If my previous conclusions are correct-that neither raw material nor reduction strategy changed, changes in target product form were insignificant, and the organiza­tion of production was essentially the same during the Classic as in the Formative-then there are three distinct statistical modes of ESR at Colha. These three modes-or "tiers," as we might call them-support the idea of a complex internal divi­sion of labor at Colha suggested by some of its orig­inal excavators (King and Potter 1994:75). These different levels of decortication debris potentially reflect particular households or household groups primarily involved in different stages of the pro­duction process. Some (with proportions of ESR above 30 percent) were devoted to quarrying and initial core reduction, while others (with less than 10 percent and averaging about 8 percent) focused more specifically on final products. The interme­diate tier (ranging from 13 to 18 percent and aver­aging 16 percent) may reflect a combination of the two tasks in the same location or may be the result of yet a third stage in the process. This is compli­cated, however, by the fact that there are temporal disparities in the distribution. Further contextual

infonnation would be necessary to resolve the issue. 
There are a number of technological factors that may also help to explain the three-tiered pattern of ESR debitage at Colha. Biface production in gen­eral has been shown to result in smaller amounts of cortical debris than does multidirectional flake/blade core reduction simply because biface manufacture creates so many waste flakes (Tomka 1989), so the reduction strategies of particular workshops specializing in different target products could be to blame. Prismatic and Stemmed blade technology, as it was implemented in northern Belize, often leaves an entire facet of cortex upon the finished product (Speal 2006:Figures 6 and 9), and this may also have contributed to the extremely low frequency of cortical debitage at many of the Colha workshops. It is also quite possible that large flakes produced by initial core reduction were reg­ularly removed from workshop debris at Colha for use, further reduction, or even exchange purposes. 
The similarity in proportions of ESR between middle-tier workshop contexts and some northern Belize consumer sites shows that this measurement alone is not always capable of differentiating pro­ducer from consumer contexts. The use of com­plementary statistics, however, such as an aggregate density of debitage, can easily distinguish special­ized workshop contexts from domestic ad hoc pro­duction. An estimated almost five million lithic items per cubic meter, for instance, were recovered from Operation 2007 at Colha (Roemer 1991 :58), compared to 297 per cubic meter from marine resource-extraction midden contexts at the coastal site of Cabbage Ridge. 1 Of course, no excavator needs such a statistic to distinguish between the intensive workshops at Colha and the middens of a small coastal community, yet it may prove use­ful in more equivocal situations. Other foci of lithic workshops in the Maya area also manifest contexts with a very high debitage density, although Colha thus far remains without demonstrated peer in this regard (Potter and King l 995:Figure 3-2). 
Those few other known Maya lithic workshop centers that are candidates for regional-level pro­ducers appear to evidence a much greater degree of elite involvement in the organization of produc­tion than does Col ha. At El Pilar, substantial work­shop deposits are located off one edge of the main plaza and unassociated with any individual resi­dential units (Ford and Olsen 1989:202-203). This site was potentially a major exporter of chert tools, though there remains a lack of consumption data from the surrounding environs. Workshops at El Pedernal in the Three Rivers region seem to have been capable of supplying the needs of that com­munity and the overarching Rio Azul polity (Lewis

2003). The concentration of workshops within one portion of El Pedemal and the presence of manu­facturing debris on the side of a former Late Pre­classic/Early Classic temple mound may also indicate some type of elite involvement at that site. Xkichmook in the Puuc area (Potter 1993:288-290) also awaits more complete investigation. Though the organization of production at these sites is still not well understood, they were clearly oriented 
toward exporting formal tools at least to the sur­rounding region. We might then call such sites, including Co Iha, exporters to distinguish them from the more "self-sustaining" lithic producers like Chan Chich, Yaxha, and Yerba Buena. 
Turning now to consumer contexts, Figure 5 presents proportions of early-stage reduction from three different regions of the Maya Lowlands­northern Belize, the Peten lakes, and the Three Rivers region. There are considerable differences by site in all three regions examined, revealing a 
significant degree of economic interdependence in each. All sites within the primary consumer sphere of Colha during the Classic period can be seen to fall within a fairly narrow range when compared to other regions. These communities exhibit mod­erate frequencies of ESR, ranging from 12 to 16 percent and averaging about 15 percent. Such sites could apparently obtain most of their formal tools through exchange yet continued to perform a con­siderable amount of domestic production in expe­dient tools and implements of specific local importance. The widespread availability of siliceous materials in northern Belize seems to have resulted in extensive production of informal and expedient lithic tools in all communities. Similar proportions also characterize Cerros (12-18 per­cent) during the Late Formative, as well as a few small upland Classic Peten communities, such as Macanche and El Intruso (both 11 percent). Most indications are that many other upland sites, such

as Dos Barbaras, Quexil, Saknab, and Salpeten, were in a similar economic position in the sense that they manifest a considerable amount of local domestic production even though producer sites were present in their region. Their somewhat lower proportion of ESR debris (5-8 percent) is likely a function of resource scarcity-which leads to increases in recycling flakes brought on by pro­longed tool recycling and curation (McAnany 1988). As a group, these upper-tier consumer sites might be referred to as importers, since they con­tinued to manufacture tools locally despite access to exchange systems that could deliver prefabri­cated formal implements. 
In the Three Rivers region, however, there appears to be a distinct lowest tier of production that manifests extremely low ESR frequencies of around 1 percent. It is possible that this pattern is simply a manifestation of the different method (i.e., flake size) of measuring early-stage reduction in Lewis's (1995) analyses. But distinctions in deb­itage assemblages suggesting extremely low degrees of participation in the lithic economy have also been reported by several projects in the Upper Belize River Valley region (Ford and Olsen 1989; VandenBosch 1999: 192-194 ).2 This lowest tier of consumer sites may have gone undocumented in the Peten lakes region due to an underrepresenta­tion of smaller communities in that study or some other, unknown methodological difference. The heavy coverage of lithic studies in northern Belize makes it unlikely to have been missed there. If it is, in fact, a real phenomenon, this level of extremely low amounts of local early-stage reduc­tion implies a tier of fully dependent consumer sites that undertook an absolute minimum of tool pro­duction for themselves. Such sites may represent either impoverished communities whose lack of access to raw materials resulted from heightened conditions of resource scarcity accompanying large population densities and more centralized control or affluent/politically powerful settlements reaping the benefits of full economic integration and find­ing no need to flake their own stone. In either case, the presence of this lowest tier of local production suggests a qualitative difference in either economic organization or structure between the core Peten and northern Belize. It is somewhat surprising that such sites are not found in the primary consumer sphere of Colha, where evidence for intensive spe­

cialization in lithic production is at its peak. 
Though the number of regions for which data are available is small, the present findings are not consistent with the idea that lithic craft specializa­tion was a factor in the economies of some regions of the Maya area but not in others (Potter 
1993:282-283). Nonetheless, when the economic geographies of northern Belize and the two regions of the Classic period core are compared, there are indications that the economy of northern Belize was rather unique. There appear to be four distinct tiers in the economic geography of the Maya Low­lands at the site scale during the Classic period. These can be characterized as follows: ( 1) exporters oflithic tools to an entire region-characterized by a complex organization of production and a multi­tiered intrasite pattern of ESR debris-of which Colha is as yet the only demonstrated example; (2) self-sufficient tool-producing sites, with loci of high frequencies of ESR (30 percent or greater), capa­ble of sustaining their own lithic needs; (3) importers, those sites well connected to formal tool exchange networks but not overwhelmingly depen­dant upon them (5-18 percent cortical debris); and (4)fully dependent sites, consumer sites that were overwhelmingly reliant upon external production for their lithic needs (1 percent early-stage reduc­tion). This modification in terminology and refine­ment of definition aims to enhance applicability of the producer-consumer model to the range of lithic data in the Maya area, as well as provide a better framework for comparative analysis. When com­bined with studies of tool morphology and distri­bution, the present results can be used to make some important inferences to ancient Maya eco­nomic structure. 
Discussion of Findings for 
Ancient Maya Political Economy 

Comparative examination of patterns in ESR debris suggests that divergent political environments and resource distributions fostered specialization in chert tool production to differing extents across the Maya area, with varying organizations of produc­tion in different regions. The erratic fluctuations and lack of patterning between northern Belizean sites in frequencies of chalcedony vs. chert ESR sug­gest that raw material was obtained through vari­ous channels that differed significantly by locality.

Flake attribute analyses at Pulltrouser Swamp have revealed that chert and chalcedony tools were in some cases the products of two very distinct reduc­tion technologies, the first associated with formal tool manufacture and the latter typical of expedi­ent flake core reduction (McAnany 1989:340). This implies that some sites did not participate in the exchange in NBCBZ raw material, either because oflocally available sources of siliceous stone (even though these were of decidedly lower quality) or possibly because they were not connect ed to the exchange network that regularly delivered it. 
As discussed above, there is evidence that raw 
material from the NBCBZ was finding its way into 
interregional exchange systems during the Classic 
period. Exchange in this material may in some 
cases have been more closely associated with long­
distance mechanisms than with regional networks. 
Based upon the proportions of ESR debris pre­
sented in Table 2 above, Classic period coastal 
transshipment points for long-distance exchange 
such as Cabbage Ridge and Ambergris Caye appear 
to have had greater access to raw northern Belize 
chert than inland farming communities such as 
those at Pulltrouser Swamp. This has strong impli­
cations for how we should view the structure of 
Maya exchange net works. 
Spheres of Lithic Consumption and 
the Prestige/Utilitarian Contrast 
Producer-consumer research has been very suc­cessful in outlining the distribution and spheres of consumption of various formal tools in the eastern Maya Lowlands. Formally defined tool products of the Colha workshops-such as Stemmed blades, Oval and General Utility bifaces, Thin bifaces, Tranchet adzes, and Eccentrics-also take on mul­tiple distribution patterns, apparently correlated with the spheres in which the products were con­sumed (Gibson 1986; Hester and Shafer 1994; San­tone 1997). Archaeologists dealing with complex societies have long distinguished between subsis­tence (utilitarian) and prestige (wealth/luxury) goods (Brumfiel and Earle 1987; Clark and Parry 1990). Mesoamerica is no exception (Clark and Blake 1994; Feinman and Nicholas 1991; Hester and Shafer 1994; Joyce 2000; McAnany 1993). Such distinctions are made primarily because cer­tain art ifacts and material types are routinely found in some types of contexts but not others, luxury 
goods typically being defined in Mesoamerica by their association with other indicators of "elite­ness" such as monumental architecture, elaborate burial, and so on (Chase and Chase 1992). This dichotomy also holds up to emic classifications documented ethnographically and ethnohistori­cally, both cross-culturally and among Mayan peo­ples (Feldman 1985; Malinowski 1922), and has been found to have considerable explanatory power with regard to the evolut ion of socioeconomic com­plexity (Frankenstien and Rowlands 1978). 
The production of most luxury items in the Maya area during the Classic period-such as jade, pyrite, and obsidian regalia; shell, bone, and antler ornaments; and polychrome ceramics-appears to have taken place in or near palace contexts within the major political cent ers (Ball 1993 ; .Inomata 200 1 :35-36; Reents-Budet 1994). Under condi­tions of rapid abandonment, workshop debris from these activities is occasionally found within a prin­ciple elite architectural group or in its immediate vicinity (Aoyama 2007; Emery andAoyama 2007; Inomata and Stiver 1998). The craftsmen them­selves were often members of the nobility, as sculp­tors of ornate stone lintels and painters of drinking vessels with elaborate scenes occasionally signed their names with elite titles (Reents-Budet 1998; Stuart 1995). The scant data available suggest that the bulk of utilitarian goods, on the other hand, were produced in the hinterlands of the major cen­ters (Fry 1980; Rands and Bishop 1980 ; Rice 1987), though no organization within this pattern has been documented. There also appears to be considerable spat ial and temporal variation in the organizat ion of utilitarian production pot ent ially related to fluc­tuation in political or economic circumstances (Masson 200 la; West 2002). 
The prestige/utilitarian contrast may well be less an essential characteristic of the material and more a reflection of different channels for the flow of dif­ferent products, reflected archaeologically in the different geographic scales at which they move. Distinct patterns of distribut ion are pot entially related to both alternative mechanisms of exchange through which artifacts moved and the socially reg­ulated availability of the two classes of item (McAnany 199 1:287). The structure and organi­zation of an exchange network have a significant effect upon its capacity to move various types of goods and therefore contribute to patterning in their
