PIEDRAS NEGRAS AND YAXCHILAN: DIVERGENT POLITICAL 
TRAJECTORIES IN ADJACENT MAYA POLITIES 

Charles Golden, Andrew K. Scherer, A. Rene Munoz, and Rosaura Vasquez 
In this article we present a synthetic overview and preliminary analysis of the data collected by members of the Sierra del Lacand6n Regional Archaeology Project ( SLRAP) during four field seasons of research from 2003 to 2007. We examine the growth, development, and transformation of the Classic Maya polities of Piedras Negras, Guatemala, and Yaxchilan, Mex­ico, located in the Middle Usumacinta Basin. This analysis uses a conjunctive approach, incorporating analyses of iconog­raphy, epigraphy, settlement patterns, ceramics, mortuary patterns, and architectural styles. During the Late Preclassic period (c. 250 B.C.-A.D. 350) settlement was scattered widely across the study region and Piedras Negras and Yaxchilan were only two of a number of other equally powerful Preclassic communities. Jn the Early Classic period ( c. A.D. 350-600) royal dynasties were established at both Piedras Negras and Yaxchilan and the population of the region became concen­trated at these two sites. During the Late Classic period (c. A.D. 600-810) the political frontier between Piedra.1· Negras and Yaxchilan was repopulated and transformed into a contested border zone surrounding a political boundary. This terri­torial expansion culminated in endemic warfare by the eighth century A.D., which may have ultimately led to the demise of these two Maya polities.

Proyecto Arqueol6gico Sierra del Lacand6n (PRASL) durante Los cuatro temporadas de campo, desde 2003 a 2007. Discutimos el crecimiento, el desarrollo, y la transformaci6n de las entidades poUticas mayas del periodo Clasico de Piedras Negras, Guatemala y Yaxchilan, Mexico, ambos ubicados en la cuenca media def Rio Usumacinta. Utilizamos un metodo conjuntivo, que incluye Los analisis de iconograj(a, epigraffa, patrones de asentamiento, la ceramica, patrones funer­arios, y estilos arquitect6nicos. Durante el periodo Preclasico (c. 250 a.C.-d.C. 350) los asentamientos fueron ubicados en un gran parte de la region del estudio, y Piedras Negras y Yaxchilan constituyeron solamente dos sitios entre varias comu­nidades Preclasicos sin una jerarqu(a poUtica entre ellos. Durante el periodo Clasico temprano ( c. d. C. 350-600) las dinast(as reales fueron establecidos en Piedras Negras y Yaxchilan, y las poblaciones regionales abandonaron el gran parte del paisaje y se concentraron dentro de nucleos y las alrededores del Los dos sitios. Durante el periodo Clasico tard(o ( c. d. C. 600-810) el limite poUtico entre los reinos fue reocupado y transformado, volviendolo una zona fronteriza contestada.

architectural styles to reconstruct the precolumbian sociopolitical geography of the region that today constitutes much of the Sierra del Lacand6n National Park (SLNP) in Guatemala and adjacent areas of Chiapas, Mexico. We will first provide an overview of our reconstruction of political devel­opments in the study region, then we will discuss previous epigraphic and archaeological research in the region, followed by the details of our own research, and concluding with preliminary inter­pretations of these data as they pertain to the polit­ical dynamics of the Piedras Negras and Yaxchilan polities. 
Since this project is ongoing, we stress that our political reconstruction is very much a work in progress. Further, for lack of space in this forum we only briefly address the theoretical underpin­nings of our research, which we will expand in sub­sequent publications. Nonetheless, we believe that the present article offers a substantive preliminary synthesis of the disparate data sets provided by our own and earlier research projects. Moreover, this research underscores the strength of regional sur­vey that crosses ancient political boundaries, con­siders regional data from the Preclassic through the Classic periods, and in so doing provides impor­tant data for the ongoing debate regarding the dynamic nature of Classic Maya polities (Marcus 2003: 109). In particular, we highlight how politi­cal organization can vary substantially between two Maya polities within a single region and illustrate how those polities transformed themselves over the course of the Classic period. 
Overview of Political History in the 
Middle Usumacinta Region 

Archaeological data that we have collected with our Guatemalan and North American colleagues, together with previously published epigraphic research, allow us to present a preliminary recon­struction of the Late Preclassic to Terminal Clas­sic period sociopolitical organization for a large portion of the Middle Usumacinta River basin. Our model describes the Preclassic period political land­scape that gave rise to the Piedras Negras and Yax­chilan polities, the transformation of these once diminutive centers into regional powers, and ulti­mately their demise and collapse. What follows is a brief overview of our model. 
Late to Terminal Preclassic Period ( c. 250 B.C.-A.D. 350) 
At the end of the Preclassic period, occupation was scattered widely across the study region (Fig­ure 2). Several sites had public architecture and Piedras Negras and Yaxchilan were only two such settlements. During the Late Preclassic these sites were probably centers of small chiefdoms, and their ruling elite did not exercise any political hege­mony over sites and populations much beyond their immediate vicinity. By the end of the Pre" classic period the region was wracked by warfare that resulted in the development of small fortified centers. 
Early Classic Period (c. A.D. 350-600) 
The beginning of the Early Classic period in the region is defined by the establishment of royal dynasties at both Piedras Negras and Yaxchilan. Populations flowed into the political centers and the countryside was largely depopulated (Figure 3). A political frontier existed between Piedras Negra5 and Yaxchilan that was not directly controlled by either polity. Warfare between Piedras Negras and Yaxchilan was limited to a few, unusual episode' of direct conflict between the rulers of the two poli­ties. Conflict was somewhat buffered by the inter­vening frontier zone. 
Late Classic Period (c. A.D. 600-810) 
During the Late Classic period the political fron­tier between Piedras Negras and Yaxchilan wm repopulated and transformed into a contested bor­der zone surrounding a political boundary (Figure 4). Warfare between the two polities during the eighth century A.D. was probably more frequent and involved the more pronounced and epigraphi­cally visible role of secondary nobles who goveme( hinterland centers. 
Terminal Classic Period (c. A.D. 810-950) 
Piedras Negras suffered the loss of its ruler to Yax­chilan at about A.D. 808 (Stuart 1998b), but b) about A.D. 810 both polities were in decline anc political control of the region began to fracture. B) 
A.D. 930 the region was essentially depopulatec with no significant occupation identified in an) known settlement.

Previous Research in the 
Middle Usumacinta Basin 

Epigraphy and Iconography 
The research of the SLRAP has been primarily archaeological, augmented by the documentation of texts by epigraphers (Fitzsimmons 2004; Hous­ton, Escobedo, Golden, Scherer, Vasquez, Arroy­ave, Quiroa, Melendez et al. 2006; Houston, Golden, Munoz, and Scherer et al. 2006; Martin and Grube 2008; Proskouriakoff 1960, 1963, 1964; Stuart l 998b ). Epigraphy cannot drive the cart in archaeology, but neither can we deny the signifi­cance of epigraphic data in structuring archaeo­logical research questions or interpretations. The two data sets offer different methods of access to historical events that are not always in agreement, but are nonetheless complementary. The hiero­glyphic record of the Middle Usumacinta Basin is a valuable source of data concerning the often vio­lent political contests waged by the dynasties of Piedras Negras andYaxchilan throughout the Clas­sic period (see Maitin and Grube 2008: 116-153 for a synthetic overview) and facilitates interpretation of the archaeological data that we have collected. Historical reconstructions of the political rela­
tionship between Piedras Negras and Yaxchilan 
remain incomplete. It seems that though one polity 
may have interfered with, or even dominated, the 
other for short periods of time, in the long term they 
were not involved in a hierarchical relationship 
with one another. Throughout the Early Classic 
period, the rulers of Piedras Negras and Yaxchilan 
maintained the prerogative of iconographic and 
textual representation as a privilege and tool of roy­
alty not shared by subordinate nobles. By the sev­
enth century A.D., though, nonroyal lords began to 
appear on monuments. Among the most important ; 
of these newly historical figures were the sajal. 
These individuals were often members of the royal 
court, and some governed smailer, secondary polit­
ical centers in the zone between the polity capitals 
(see Chinchilla and Houston 1993; Houston and 
Stuart 200 1 ). 
Some sajal, such as those at El Cayo, part of the 
Piedras Negras polity, had a relatively long history 
of perhaps five generations oflocal rulership. Mem­
bers of this sajal "dynasty" at El Cayo were able to 
pursue political relationships with several polities. 
For the governors of El Cayo, the rulers of Piedras Negras were only the most important among a series of allies (Anaya Hernandez 200 1 :77; Chin­chilla and Houston 1993; Houston et al. 2008.; Martin and Grube 2008: 151; Mathews 1998). The complexity of the relationship between the sajal of El Cayo and monarchs of Piedras Negras is evident on monuments from El Cayo, on which local rulers often appear without their overlords (Figure 5). Nonetheless, monuments such as El Cayo Altar 4 were created by nobles from Piedras Negras, pre­sumably sent by the ruler of the primate site (Hous­ton et al. 2008; Martin and Grube 2008: 150; Mathews 1998). This same iconographic and tex­tual pattern is repeated throughout the Piedras Negras polity: nobles typically appear without their overlord, and acknowledgment of political subor­dination is restricted to textual references, some as unobtrusive as the name of a Piedras Negras spon­sored sculptor. 

In contrast, there is no evidence of multigener­ational sajal dynasties for the Yaxchilan polity. Epi­graphic evidence suggests instead that the Yaxchilan rulers exercised a more direct and fun­damental control over their subordinates than did the rulers of Piedras Negras (Chinchilla and Hous­ton 1993; Martin and Grube 2008). As part and par­cel of this control, the sajal at La Pasadita and other sites in the Yaxchilan kingdom were almost always depicted in the company of the ruler ofYaxchilan in the performance of dances, the display of cap­tives, and the delivery of tribute among other rit­ual activities (Figure 6). The ruler of Yaxchilan dominates these paired scenes. Like the sajal mon­uments from the Piedras Negras kingdom, many of the monuments in the Yaxchilan polity were carved by the same sculptors who produced mon­uments at the capital, suggesting that the dynastic ruler maintained control over those few scribe­sculptors capable of producing finely wrought text­bearing monuments. 
Archaeology 
Previous archaeological research in the study region focused heavily on the polity capitals of Piedras Negras (e.g., Coe 1959; Houston, Escobedo, Child, Golden, Terry, and Webster 2000; Houston et al. 1998; Houston et al. 1999; Houston, Escobedo, Terry, Webster, Veni, and Emery 2000; Weeks et al. 2005) (see http://www.famsi.org/

Prior to the start of the Sierra del Lacand6n Regional Archaeology Project, very little archaeological research or explo­ration had been conducted in the region beyond the dynastic centers (Aliphat 1994; Anaya Hernandez 2001; Golden et al. 1999; Golden et al. 2000; Hous­ton, Escobedo, Child, Golden, Terry, and Webster 2000; Houston et al. 1999; Lee and Hayden 1988; Maler 1901; Mathews andAliphat Fernandez 1997; Morley 1937-1938; Shook 1998). 
Sierra del Lacand6n 
Regional Archaeology Project 

To provide a regional perspective on political dynamics in the Middle Usumacinta Basin, we ini­tiated the Sierra del Lacand6n Regional Archaeol­ogy Project (SLRAP). To date, the SLRAP has con­ducted five field seasons (2003 to 2007) of recon­naissance, mapping, and excavations in Guatemala's Sierra del Lacand6n National Park (Golden and Scherer 2006; Golden et al. 2005) (see www.sierralacandon.org/resources-pubs.html for additional publications and reports). This area cov­ers much of the terrain on the Guatemalan side of the Usumacinta River between the capital centers of Piedras Negras and Yaxchilan (Figure 1 )Mem­
. 
bers of the SLRAP have identified at least 23 pre­viously undocumented archaeological sites, and further documented five previously known sites (Table 1 ). Here we summarize our most significant findings for understanding regional political devel­opments. 
Settlement Patterns and Hierarchy 
Although the development of site hierarchies can be problematic (de Montmollin 1989:85-87; Ian­none 2004; Yaeger and Robin 2004), we use a four-

tier site hierarchy in the Sierra del Lacand6n to conceptualize settlement differences during the Late Classic period (Marcus 2003:103, 2004:359; Spencer and Redmond 2004) (cf. de Montmollin 1989; Iannone 2004; Wright 1984; Wright and Johnson 197 4 ). This hierarchical typology does not reflect all of the archaeologically observed vari­ability and almost certainly does not precisely fit the perception of settlement held by the Maya them­selves, but it facilitates archaeological discussion. 
Primate Centers. Only Piedras Negras andYax­chilan can be classified as first-tier dynastic capi­tals in the study region (see Table 1). Both sites are characterized by numerous text-bearing monuments and extensive site cores (1 krn2 or greater) with monumental and vaulted masonry architecture. 
Secondary Centers. Four sites in our zone of fieldwork on the Guatemalan side of the U sumac­inta are classified as secondary political centers: Tecolote, La Pasadita, Oso Negro, and Texcoco. These sites are characterized by vaulted masonry architecture confined to relatively small site cores (less than lkm2), typically surrounded by abundant settlement. Secondary centers were probably gov­erned by high-ranking members of the nobility, including sajal, that were subordinate to the lords of the primate centers. For example, looted monu­ments indicate that the sajal who governed La Pasa­dita was subordinate to the paramount ruler at Yaxchilan (Kamal et al. 1999; Martin and Grube 2008:135; Schele 1991; Schele and Mathews 1991). In the absence of monuments, political affil­iations can be assigned to secondary centers based upon their proximity to primate centers and stylis­tic affinities in material culture with the primate and other secondary centers. Based on this evidence, La Pasadita, Tecolote, and Oso Negro are secondary centers subordinate to Yaxchilan (Figures 7-9). We consider Texcoco to be a probable secondary cen­ter in the Piedras Negras polity based on its prox­imity to the polity capital and shared material culture (Figure 10).

• Sites without documented inscriptions; recent archaeological research, size, and proximity to primate center used to infer 
political affiliation. 
§ Ranking based upon reported site size and proximity to primate center; no inscriptions and no current archaeological data 
available. 

Although research at Mexican sites in the region is limited, some can be linked to a capital on the basis of inscribed monuments and proximity to either Piedras Negras or Yaxchilan. The best doc­umented is the Piedras Negras allied El Cayo (Chin­chilla and Houston 1993; Lee and Hayden 1988; Maler 1903; Martin and Grube 2008; Mathews 1998; Zender 2002). South of El Cayo, across the river from Tecolote, inscriptions from El Chicoza­pote indicate that its rulers were subordinate to the kings of Yaxchilan in the Late Classic period (Anaya Hernandez 2001, 2005b; Maler 1903; Mar­tin and Grube 2008). We assume that additional sec­ondary sites exist along the Piedras 
Negras-Yaxchilan border in Mexico, but are either undocumented by archaeologists or are known from reconnaissance but cannot be positively linked to one or the other polity for lack of appropriate information. 
Tertiary Centers. Tertiary centers are charac­terized by a definable core of public masonry archi­tecture, though this core lacks vaulted structures. 
Settlement consists of dense clusters of ten or more patio groups, probably governed by minor nobil­ity or local household and lineage heads. The polit­ical affiliation of these sites is determined largely by proximity to primary and secondary centers, but can in some cases be further substantiated by mate­rial culture, particularly ceramic styles and archi­tectural patterns. Tertiary settlements include the greatest diversity of site plans, and the ancient res­idents of these sites probably performed a wide range of sociopolitical roles within the polity (see Yaeger and Robin 2004). 
Esmeralda and El Tunel are examples of tertiary centers in the Piedras Negras and Yaxchilan poli­ties, respectively. Both sites have well-defined cen­ters with dense clusters of masonry structures. The center of Esmeralda, for instance, includes more than 20 large masonry platforms (many are 2-3 m high, and over 20 m long) that supported perish­able superstructures, arranged in formal patios (Fig­ure 11 ). Public/ritual architecture at Esmeralda includes a ball-court that is part of the largest, most

formalized patio group at the site. Surrounding set­tlement is dense, with dozens of large patio groups spaced at intervals of no more than 50 m. The core of El Tunel consists of at least one small (c. 5 m) pyramidal platform as well as a series of large plat­forms (1-2 m high, approximately 20 m long) and surrounding settlement is as dense as that of Esmer­alda. 
Quaternary Centers. These sites are character­ized by loosely organized clusters of fewer than ten patio groups with no definable site center, proba­bly representing rural hamlets or individual house­holds. Architecture consists of low, rough-cut masonry platforms that supported perishable super­structures. Sites such as Rabano, Tejon, and Limon are typical of fourth-tier centers, and are situated at the margins of fertile low-lying wetlands ( bajos). The paucity of published data concerning small third and fourth tier settlements on the Mexican side of the river make it difficult to consider them in this discussion, although we assume they must be abun­dant. 
Unranked Centers. Four of the sites that we have identified were primarily occupied only in the Pre­classic period and thus do not fit into the Classic period hierarchy: La Tecnica, Zancudero, Maca­bilero, and Fideo. Evidence for Classic period use is limited to a thin scattering of ceramics in the near­surface strata, and there is no evidence for Classic period construction fill. We cannot say if the sites were reoccupied in the Classic period, or merely venerated as part of the ritual landscape. Two of these sites have significant ceremonial centers: La Tecnica is centered on an E-Group (Aimers and Rice 2006), and Fideo has two small pyramids at its center. The remaining two are defensible posi­tions; one perched on a cliff top (Macabilero ), the other surrounded by fortifications (Zancudero). 
Ceramics 
We use ceramics for reconstructing chronology in the study region and for exploring sociopolitical affiliation. Analyses of ceramics from hinterland contexts are ongoing and our interpretations of materials from these sites represent qualitative rather than quantitative assessments. Project mem­bers have conducted test-excavations at Tecolote, La Pasadita, Esmeralda, Ana, Chichicua, Fideo, La

Tecnica, Zancudero, Arroyo Yaxchilan, and El Kinel. Surface collections have been also made at Macabilero, Oso Negro, Union Maya Itza, Retal­teco, La Colina, Arroyo El Mico, La Fortuna, Tzimin, and in caves scattered across the study region (see http://sierralacandon.org/resources­pubs.html for seasonal reports detailing the nature, location, and quantification of excavated units and the ceramic sample). 
Occupation at many sites can be dated as early as the mid-first millennium B.C. Middle Preclas­sic materials are securely dated to 500 B.C. at Piedras Negras through radiocarbon dates (Munoz 2006; Perez Robles 2006), and at Fideo, Esmeral­ada, Ana, Chichicua, La Tecnica, and Zancudero through stylistic comparisons (Golden and Scherer 2006; Lee and Hayden 1988; Mathews andAliphat 1997). Ceramics during the Preclassic period across the region appear to be local variants of the Mamon 
(c. 600-300 B.C.) and later Chicane! (c. 300 B.C.-A.D. 250) ceramic spheres, differing from other parts of the Maya Lowlands at the level of mode rather than type. Middle and Late Preclassic ceramics are widely distributed, with greater abun­dance of Late Preclassic materials. Late Preclassic ceramics are found in many caves and in con­struction sequences at most sites where SLRAP members have excavated test pits. 
During much of the Early Classic period (c. 
A.D. 250-550), producers in the Yaxchilan and Piedras Negras kingdoms participated in the Tza­kol Ceramic sphere. At Piedras Negras, Early Clas­sic ceramics have been found in well-stratified contexts within all sectors of the site (Acuna Smith

2005; Munoz 2006).The distribution ofEarly Clas­sic ceramics at Yaxchilan is more difficult to ascer­tain, but these materials appear to have been found in significant quantities across the site (Lopez­Varela 1989). 
Elsewhere in the Sierra Lacand6n, Early Clas­sic materials are exceedingly rare, and have been recovered in only a few of the excavations and sur­face collections conducted by SLRAP personnel, primarily in caves (Golden, Romero, Dardon, and Rangel 2005). At sites where they have been found in excavations, Early Classic ceramics reflect a minority of materials (constituting fewer than 100 sherds), typically immediately preceding site aban­donment, as at Fideo and La Tecnica. Small quan­tities of late Early Classic (Tzakol 3) materials are also occasionally found in construction fill mixed with abundant early Late Classic (Tepeu 1) mate­rials at sites including Ana, Esmeralda, Tecolote, and El Kinel, suggesting that construction at these sites began sometime in the late sixth or very early seventh centuries A.D. However, apart from Piedras 
Negras and Yaxchilan, building phases securely predating the late sixth century have been identi­fied in the region only at El Cayo (Mathews and Aliphat Fernandez 1997:200-205).

The Early Classic ceramics recovered from all areas of the Sierra Lacand6n, including Piedras Negras, are represented by monochrome and poly­chrome types similar to contemporary ceramics found elsewhere in the Southern Maya Lowlands. However, some differences in form and surface decoration of polychromes that distinguish the ceramics of the Middle Usumacinta region from those of the Central Peten (Acufia Smith 2005; Mufioz et al. 2002). A preliminary study by Mufioz comparing the Early Classic assemblages from Piedras Negras and published materials from El 
Cayo suggests these materials may be more simi­lar to each other than to contemporary materials from Yaxchilan. Interestingly, caves at La Pasadita yielded materiais, including a three-quarter com­plete polychrome tripod vessel, identical to a type and variety (Otatal Orange Polychrome: Garza Gorda variety) found at Piedras Negras, but not Yaxchilan, a fact that we will return to in discus­sion below (see Mufioz 2006: 147). Overall, though, the nature and degree of variability in the Early Classic assemblages of sites in the Sierra Lacand6n is difficult to discern due to the paucity

of Early Classic ceramics. In fact, this lack of Early 
Classic ceramics suggests that much of the regional population was concentrated in the immediate vicinity of Piedras Negras and Yaxchilan from about A.D. 350 to at least 600. 
Beginning at about A.D. 550, ceramic assem­blages produced at the polity capitals began to diverge more widely in terms of styles and tech­nologies used. Ceramic producers at Piedras Negras developed a distinct ceramic tradition emphasizing

elaborate resist decorative techniques (Figure 12). Although resist decorated ceramics are known from other Maya sites, nowhere else are they represented in such quantity or by such modal and typological diversity as at Piedras Negras. The tradition of pos­itive painting that characterizes most Classic period Lowland Maya polychrome ceramics was a minor­ity technique for much of the Late Classic at Piedras Negras, where between A.D. 630 and 750, resist decorated ceramics account for 64 percent of the total polychrome assemblage (Muiioz 2006:290). 
In contrast, potters at Yaxchilan never devel­oped a significant polychrome resist tradition, and most of the Late Classic polychrome ceramics from Yaxchilan are typologically identical to their analogs in the Central Peten and Pasion River regions in decorative technique, motif, and palette (Lopez-Varela 1989). Thus, by the Late Classic period the polychrome ceramic traditions at the sites of Piedras Negras and Yaxchilan are distin­guished not by a few modal or typological varia­tions, but by fundamentally different decorative technologies. 
Late Classic ceramic assemblages at sites in the Piedras Negras domain, including Esmeralda, Ana, and Fideo, yielded resist-decorated polychrome ceramics that are typologically identical to those from Piedras Negras. Moreover, other positive painted polychromes associated with the Piedras Negras assemblage were also found at these rural sites. These hinterland ceramics were found in con­struction fill and middens adjacent to structures (Muiioz 2004b). This suggests that producers and consumers of ceramics in the Piedras Negras hin­terland participated in the ceramic sphere centered on Piedras Negras itself during the seventh and eighth centuries A.D. 
Surface collections and test-pits in the elite architectural precincts at the secondary sites of La Pasadita and Tecolote have produced ceramic assemblages similar to published assemblages from Yaxchilan (Lopez-Varela 1989). These assem­blages are notable for their emphases on positive painted polychrome decoration that, in terms of palette and motif, are nearly identical to poly­chromes from the Central Peten and Pasion regions. Resist decorated ceramics are completely absent from these collections, even though they appear to date to the period when resist decoration was most widely distributed at Piedras Negras (A.D. 630-750). 
In contrast, surface collections in caves in the vicinity of La Pasadita produced some ceramics decorated using a resist technique similar to that observed at Piedras Negras (Golden et al. 1999; Muiioz 2004b, 2006), though they are typologi-

cally distinct. In a cave near the epicenter of Tecolote, however, resist decorated polychrome sherds that are typologically identical to those from Piedras Negras (Santa Rosa Cream Polychrome) were found. Neither La Pasadita nor Tecolote have yielded resist-decorated ceramics from architec­tural construction sequences or other stratigraphic contexts. 
Only in a very few instances have resist deco­rated ceramics been identified in the Yaxchilan gov­erned zone. A single Piedras Negras style resist decorated sherd (from the Santa Rosa ceramic group) was found in excavations at the Arroyo Yax­chilan, a small settlement a few kilometers to the southeast ofYaxchilan. Two complete, and another mostly complete, resist decorated vessels were found in burials at El Kine! (Perez Robles and Arroyave 2006: Figures 5.10 and 5.11). These objects, though, post-date the period during which resist ceramics were most common at Piedras 
Negras, and are radically different from the Piedras Negras resists in terms of vessel form, palette, motif, and technological style. Indeed, these ves­sels seem to represent developments unique to the Yaxchilan zone and unrelated to the Piedras Negras resists. 
Architecture 
Our research suggests that architectural styles and technologies at secondary and tertiary centers emu­lated those of the primate centers. This pattern of emulation is most obvious at secondary political centers on the Yaxchilan side of the Late Classic border zone, where palace structures closely resem­ble one another and those of the polity capital. 
Tecolote, La Pasadita, and Oso Negro all have palaces that exhibit multiple architectural modes common to Yaxchilan-style palaces, characterized by multidoor facades with beveled cornices and insets for tenoned sculpture above the doorways (see Golden, Scherer, and Munoz 2005:Fig. 2; Tate 1992: Fig. 103, 148). Moreover, Structure D3-l at Tecolote and Structure 1 at La Pasadita are mirror images, rotated 180 degrees from one another (Fig­ures 7 and 8). They are virtually identical in terms of masonry and interior and exterior dimensions, and both were decorated with polychrome murals. In contrast, palace structures at Piedras Negras and other sites in its vicinity lack beveled cornices and sculptural insets above the doorways. 
Decorative elements, such as carved lintels and painted murals, further linked secondary centers to the polity capitals. As we have already noted, sculp­tors were apparently sent from the polity capitals to subordinate centers to create these iconographic elements (Martin and Grube 2008; Montgomery 1995). The style of calligraphic script in the murals at Tecolote suggests that the painters responsible for some of the murals at Bonampak, themselves possibly sent from Yaxchilan, also worked at Tecolote (Stephen Houston and David Stuart, per­sonal communication, 2004 ). The similarity in style and color palettes of murals at La Pasadita and Yax­chilan further highlights the epigraphically docu­mented ties between these two sites (Kamal et al. 1999:1393). 
The site of Texcoco has been less thoroughly examined, though there is tentative evidence for emulation of Piedras Negras architectural styles. The presence of a monumental sweatbath at Tex­coco parallels those at Piedras N egras, a site unique in the Maya area for eight such sweatbaths (Child 2006; Golden et al. 2004). Moreover, buildings with square colonnades in the site core ofTexcoco are reminiscent of structures in the West Court Plaza and Acropolis at Piedras Negras and lack obvious analogs at Yaxchilan. 
Observed similarities between architecture at Esmeralda and Piedras Negras suggest that resi­dents of lower-order centers may also have sought to emphasize their political affiliation through architectural expressions. The most common Late Classic plaza plan at Esmeralda and surrounding sites consists of three structures organized in the form of a "U" on top of a large platform mound. The "U" patio pattern is repeated within the hypo­thetical boundaries of the Piedras Negras polity at sites including Fideo, Ana, Fajardo and Piedras 
Negras itself, but similar patio layouts do not occur frequently at sites in the Yaxchilan kingdom. At sites in the Yaxchilan polity, open plaza plans and individual mounds are much more common. 
Greg Borgstede and colleagues (2004) also sug­gest that a ballcourt at Esmeralda, and the 30 degree orientation of the site as a whole, indicates further connections with Piedras Negras. The orientation of this ballcourt provides a major axis in the site core of Esmeralda, and may be based on the South Group ballcourt, Str. R-11, at PiedrasNegras. Both the Esmeralda and South Group ballcourts are ori-

ented 30 degrees east of north (Satterthwaite 1933; 1944: figs. 2, 4, 10), which is an important axis over­all at Piedras Negras. Architecture, burials, and other features at sites in the Yaxchilan kingdom (including Yaxchilan, La Pasadita, Tecolote, and El Kinel), in contrast, tend to emphasize an orienta­tion of approximately 118 degrees (Harold Green, personal communication to Golden, 2007; Golden et al. 2007; Tate 1992: 112) 
Mortuary Patterns 
The largest and best-studied mortuary sample in the 
region comes from Piedras Negras. At Piedras N egras, a combined 122 burials were excavated by the University of Pennsylvania project in the 1930s (Coe 1959) and the later joint Brigham Young­Universidad del Valle project in the 1990s and 2004, all of which were analyzed by Scherer and col­leagues (Houston, Escobedo, Scherer, Fitzsim­mons, and Child 2003; Scherer et al. 2007; Scherer et al. 1999, 2001). Further evidence comes from accounts of mortuary practices in Piedras Negras' hieroglyphic record (Fitzsimmons 1998, 2002). 
Elite mortuary ritual at Piedras Negras was char­acterized by the placement of tombs below plazas, rather than within pyramids or other structures. At Piedras Negras, 76 of the 122 burials (62.3 percent) were located in plazas or other outside areas. All known or suspected burials of Late Classic period rulers were located in plazas, and only two poten­tially royal burials were located within structures (Fitzsimmons et al. 2003). The placement of tombs and other burials below plaza floors permitted re­entry on auspicious dates for ritual activity, such as the burning of the tomb and its contents (Fitzsim­mons 1998; Stuart l 998a). At least one of these re­entry episodes has been verified archaeologically for Burial 13, the probable tomb of Ruler 4 (Escobedo 2004). 
Royal and nonroyal burials at Piedras N egras are characterized by a paucity of ceramic vessels (Houston, Escobedo, Scherer, Fitzsimmons, and Child 2003). In the five known and probable royal tombs the number of ceramic vessels ranged from zero to two (mean of .8 vessels per tomb), pre­senting a dramatic contrast to other Maya sites. At Tikal, for instance, a mean of 16.6 vessels was reported for the tombs excavated by the University of Pennsylvania Project (Welsh l 988:Table 72). In the total Piedras Negras burial sample, only 18 of 
the 122 (14.8 percent) burials contained ceramic 
vessels, even though finely made polychrome 
ceramics are abundant in other contexts at the site 
(e.g., middens, construction fill). Furthermore, 
royal Piedras Negras burials demonstrate a stan­
dardized set of burial furniture that includes bun­
dles of bloodletting lancets placed at the right hand 
and bloodletter handles carved to depict the deity 
"chaak" (Fitzsimmons et al. 2003). Finally, Late 
Classic kings at Piedras Negras were each interred 
with two accompanying adolescents (Coe 1959; 
Escobedo 2004). 
Funerary traditions at Yaxchilan differed sig­
nificantly. Royal burials at that site were placed 
beneath the floors of temple structures rather than 
plazas (Garcia Moll 1996, 2004a). The symbols 
associated with royal bloodletting in the Yaxchilan 
tombs were linked to the deity k' aawil, rather than 
chaak (Fitzsimmons 2002:203). It also seems that 
tombs were more opulently adorned at Yaxchilan. 
For example, Tomb 3 contained 435 pieces of jade 
and other greenstone and 34 ceramic vessels (Gar­
cia Moll 2004a). 
Preliminary data from Yaxchilan-related settle­ments suggest mortuary patterns that are similar to those at the primate center and wholly unlike the burial patterning at Piedras Negras. At Tecolote and La Pasadita, looters' trenches have revealed at least seven finely prepared masonry crypts below the floor of interior room spaces of palace struc­tures. The location (interior room spaces) and sty le of these crypts mirrors the royal burials ofYaxchi­lan (Garcia Moll 2004a) and are unlike those of Piedras Negras. Moreover, within-structure burials at the Yaxchilan-affiliated El Kinel are abundant. A single excavated structure revealed eight graves in an exposure measuring approximately 5 x 2 m (Arroyave Prera 2007; Perez Robles and Arroyave 2006). Similar groupings of burials at Piedras 
Negras have been found primarily in plazas (e.g., Monterroso 1998). 
Burial furniture of non-elite burials, too, varies between polities. At Tecolote, a simple child bur­ial was excavated that included an inverted tripod plate with a "kill hole" drilled through the base (Arroyave Prera 2004). Similarly, six of the ten unlooted burials excavated at El Kinel contained inverted tripod plates with "kill holes" placed over the heads of the deceased (Golden and Scherer 2006:10; Morales 2001 :9), and in some cases mul-

tiple vessels were interred with the deceased. In contrast, vessels are rarely present in burials at Piedras Negras, and of the entire mortuary sample, only one grave, dating to the Terminal Preclassic period, contained a body with a plate placed over the face (Monterroso 1997:32-33). 
Defensive Features 
Defensive features in the study region are material remnants of the epigraphically evident conflicts between the Piedras Negras and Yaxchilan polities, as well as of conflicts that preceded the rise of those polities. Classic period fortifications are concen­trated around the border zone between the two poli­ties, but appear to be more heavily concentrated and elaborated on the Yaxchilan side of the political divide. Five sites associated with free-standing stone walls have been identified in the study zone: La Pasadita, Tecolote, El Bayal, El Tunel, and Zan­cudero. We presume that these identified features represent only a subset of defensive features actu­ally present in the study area. 
At La Pasadita, most settlement is perched on defensible hilltops overlooking steep cliffs and ravines (Golden 2003). At least one stone wall spans a valley entrance to the site core. Situated across a low rise between two hills, this 1.5 m high wall would have provided an effective barrier with or without a palisade. Another stone wall is located to the east of La Pasadita, closer to the site of El Tunel. This feature is 1 to 1.5 m high, and mea­sures at least a 100 m in length, though its termini have yet to be found. 
At Tecolote, access to the site from the north is gained through a series of narrow, winding valleys no more than ten or twenty meters wide. No more than a few hundred meters northwest of the site core, reconnaissance revealed walls very much like those at La Pasadita and El Tunel. A few kilome­ters to the north ofTecolote the valleys are crossed in at least three locations by low stone walls (approximately 1 m high) near a small group oflow masonry platforms that constitute the site of El Bayal. If they supported a palisade or thorny bar­ricade, warriors defending these walls and adjacent hills could have controlled movements to and from 
Tecolote. Moreover, El Bayal is strategically posi­tioned to control a small valley (known locally as Argueta) that provides easy overland access from the river to the interior north-south valley on east-em side of the Usumacinta. This is the only such access point in Guatemala on the stretch of river between Yaxchilan and El Cayo. This same valley also has a spring, representing a critical resource if ever the area was under siege. We hypothesize that the walls date from between A.D. 600 to 810, but have yet to be excavated. 
The political role of Zancudero, located 6 km to the southeast ofYaxchilan, is unclear. The site core of Zancudero consists of a 90 m high hill sur­mounted by low platforms that supported perish­able superstructures. Surrounding the hill and its associated settlement is a massive masonry wall, at least 800 m long, 2 m wide, and in places 3 or 4 m tall. This wall surrounds more than half its adja­cent structures. The remainder of the circumference is completed by swampland and a creek, creating an easily defended outpost with a commanding view of the landscape. 
A series of test pits and surface collections of the structures inside the wall have yielded materi­als that date almost exclusively to the period from about 250 B.C. to A.D. 250, with a scattering of near-surface ceramics dating to the very Late to Ter­minal Classic period c. A.D. 600-900. This sug­gests that the site was largely built and used during the Preclassic period, abandoned during the Early Classic period, and was minimally reoccupied or reused during the Late to Terminal Classic period. Ceramics recovered in test-excavations of the wall itself indicate that it was constructed at least as early as the Late Preclassic period. This feature may also have been used during the Classic period, a pattern of reuse observed at other Maya centers (e.g., Rice and Rice 1981); however, no Classic period sherds were recovered from construction fill in the wall. 
A ditch-and-berm feature has been identified at the site of El Kinel, 8 km upriver from Yaxchilan (Golden and Scherer 2006; Morales 2001 ). El Kinel is located along a bend in the Usumacinta River, and the majority of settlement is densely clustered between the ditch (on the north and east), and the river (to the south and west). When filled with water the ditch cuts this southern sector of El Kinel off from the mainland creating a defensive system rem­iniscent of Punto de Chimino in the Petexbatun region of Guatemala (Demarest et al. 1997:238-242). A long, low berm runs along the ditch on the south side. Preliminary excavations in

the berm revealed four post molds spaced at regu­lar intervals, averaging 42 cm in diameter. These may be the remnants of a wooden palisade, though radiocarbon dates are needed to confirm their antiq­uity (Golden and Scherer 2006). Excavations of house structures at El Kinel yielded materials dat­ing to the period from approximately A.D. 500 to 
900. 
Discussion 
As outlined in the opening, we propose a dynamic political model for the Middle Usumacinta Basin. During the Late Preclassic period, the region was dotted with numerous, relatively small settlements, of which Piedras Negras and Yaxchilan were merely peers among many other sites of similar size and power. Impressive defensive sites such as Zancudero-abandoned c. A.D. 250-hint at endemic warfare in the study region at the close of the Preclassic period. 
With the establishment of royal dynasties at Piedras Negras and Yaxchilan during the Early Classic, much of the regional population moved to these centers. Such relatively rapid congregation of populations in newly established urban centers is a not uncommon process in many regions around the world (e.g., Balkansky 1998; Cowgill 1997; Demand 1990; Falconer and Savage 1995; Marcus and Flannery 1996). In the Middle Usumacinta region people may have moved to the new capitals to participate in the vibrant political, economic, and social communities that grew up around these dynasties (Houston, Escobedo, Child, Golden, and Munoz 2003), but they may also have congregated as a way of escaping the vicissitudes of a Preclas­sic countryside wracked by warfare. The two hypotheses are, of course, not mutually exclusive. 
Whatever the reasons of centralization, the result was the formation of two polities separated by an uncontrolled frontier zone during the early years of kingship at Piedras Negras and Yaxchilan. How­ever, in the Late Classic period the realms of Piedras 
Negras and Yaxchilan were extended such that the two polities met at a border, which by the eighth century A.D. was violently contested and may have ultimately contributed to the demise of these Clas­sic period powers. 
The ceramic data provide an important window into evolving sociopolitical identities in the region. 
During the Late Classic period, a fundamentally distinctive ceramic technology (resist decoration) that was widely employed at Piedras Negras is rare at Yaxchilan and from sites within the Late Clas­sic boundaries of the Yaxchilan polity, as elsewhere in the Maya area (Fome 2006: 144-151; Munoz 2004a, 2006; Munoz et al. 2002; see also Bachand 1997; Holley 1983). The distribution of material culture styles, particularly ceramic types, is not always indicative of cultural or political bound­aries or the flow of information across those bound-. aries (see Bey 2003; Cohen 1974; Johnson 1977; 
Neitzel 1994; Smith 2000). However, technologi­cal distinctions between ceramics assemblages can provide a mechanism for inferring sociopolitical identity and affiliation in archaeological contexts (Byland 1994: 122), particularly when used in con­junction with other archaeological evidence. 
Some mixing of ceramic types or assemblages is expected in rural settlements along the border zone of the Late Classic polities where the author­ity of the polity capitals was at its weakest (Bey 2003:28; Smith 2000) if economic and other social interactions between border communities was rel­atively open. Furthermore, since most secondary centers along the border zone were established de novo in the Late Classic-as indicated by data in the Yaxchilan kingdom and the lack of earlier occu­pation at these sites-we expected ceramic assem­blages associated with monumental architecture to reflect the close and political association between the ceramic consumers at the secondary centers and the primate center. 
Preliminary analyses of ceramic assemblages at sites away from the Late Classic period border zone suggest that ceramics were being produced and used that were remarkably like that of the closest primate center. At Esmeralda andAna we find resist decorated polychromes typologically identical to those at Piedras Negras. At El Kinel, Oso Negro, and Union Maya Itza (UMI), surface collections and test pits have yielded Central Peten types, and are thus more similar to Yaxchilan. Only in a very few instances-such as the whole vessels from burials at El Kinel-have resist decorated ceram­ics been identified in the southern sites near Yax­chilan, and in these cases they differ at the level of type and technological style from Piedras Negras ceramics. 
At the border sites of La Pasadita and Tecolote,

however, there appear to be two distinct patterns in the ceramic assemblage. In materials recovered from residential and monumental architectural precincts, types represented are most similar to the assemblage from Yaxchilan, and resist decorated ceramics have not yet been identified from such contexts. Caves from these sites, on the other hand, contained resist decorated ceramics. At Tecolote these include materials typologicaliy identical to the most common resist decorated Late Classic polychrome type at Piedras Negras, Santa Rosa Cream Polychrome. At a cave near La Pasadita, a partially complete tripod vessel was identical to plates (Otatal Orange Polychrome -Garza Gorda variety) recovered from Piedras Negras, and other fragmentary pieces of the same type were found in other caves in the vicinity. These plates date to the second half of the sixth century A.D. These types have not been identified in the ceramic assemblage at Yaxchilan, nor found in residential or monu­mental contexts in the vicinity of La Pasadita. 
In other words, to make a rough but apparently accurate generalization, people living in the Late Classic Yaxchilan kingdom used Yaxchilan style ceramics, people in the Piedras Negras kingdom used Piedras Negras style ceramics. However, the presence of Piedras Negras style ceramics dating fromA.D. 550-750 in caves near Late Classic Yax­chilan secondary sites suggests that consumers of Piedras Negras ceramics had access to these bor­derland caves at some point during the Classic period, perhaps as sites for ritual pilgrimage at a time when this region was a frontier zone. These caves may have constituted a significant ritual resource that was visited, and possibly contested, by people from both the Piedras Negras and Yax­chilan kingdoms. As Yaxchilan consolidated con­trol over these caves, with the establishment of secondary centers like Tecolote and La Pasadita, they may have ultimately gained control of this rit­ual resource. 
Architecture, like ceramics, can be viewed from the perspective of technology as well as sty le. Com­plex public architecture-with corbelled vaults, cornices, roof combs, and other complicated masonry-requires some expert understanding of construction techniques by a group of skilled masons, even if the majority of builders were unskilled laborers. Although we do not know whether the Classic period Maya recognized archi­tects as a distinct class of artisans, the similarity of monumental architecture at secondary sites in the Y axchilan polity, particularly Tecolote, La Pasadita, and Oso Negro, strongly suggests oversight from Yaxchilan. 
On the other hand, simple house construction­a masonry foundation supporting a perishable superstructure-does not seem to require complex methods of building technologies. Yet, construction fill, use of stabilizing construction walls, and other techniques may be indicative of local technologi­cal styles. The evidence of house form (style) gleaned from the organization of patio groups at smaller settlements suggests that sites on the Piedras Negras side of the border look different than those on the Yaxchilan side of the border. Struc­tural similarities between sites have also been used to suggest intra-polity ties among sites elsewhere in the Maya area (e.g., de Montmollin 1988; Smith 2000). 
Mortuary patterns also offer significant insight on regional patterns of polity identity. Cross­culturally, graves may serve as expressions of social memory and community identity (Chesson 200 1). In some contexts, burial sites were used to estab­lish a society's rights and connections to their land­scapes (Buikstra and Charles 1999; Chapman 1981, 1995; Goldstein 1980; Renfrew 1976; Saxe 1971). Although the significance of regional patterning in mortuary ritual is specific to cultural context (Charles and Buikstra 2002), McAnany and others (Gillespie 2002; Hendon 2000; McAnany 1995, 1998) have shown how Maya burials, be they of royalty or commoners, were used to perpetuate the memory of the ancestors and legitimize descen­dants' claims to the land. Thus, Maya burials were strategically placed in areas used by the living­within house groups, in family shrines, or within pyramids and caves (Ashmore and Geller 2005; Fitzsimmons et al. 2003). 
In light of the social significance of Maya ances­tors it is not surprising that distinct funerary tradi­tions evolved during the Classic period (Fitzsimmons 2002; Welsh 1988). The burial cus­toms at Piedras Negras and Yaxchilan are clearly distinct from one another, despite their geographic proximity. Mortuary practices at subordinate sites appear to have been influenced by those of the polity capitals, especially at Yaxchilan's secondary sites. Among elites, formalized crypts in palatial

structures were the norm at Tecolote and La Pasa­
dita. More generally, the placement of three ceramic 
vessels, including a plate with a "kill hole," was 
common at Yaxchilan subordinated sites in burials, 
in marked contrast to mortuary practices at Piedras Negras. 
Aside from being obvious indicators of military conflict, defensive features relate to evolving processes of polity formation, organization, and maintenance. In a politically fragmented landscape, it is expected that political boundaries would be spa­tially restricted. The defenses of such settlements would be "site oriented," consisting of features that were intended to defend a single settlement or a sig­nificant portion thereof. The implication is that a defended site center functioned as a fall-back posi­tion where a limited space and population could be protected. Such a situation might occur prior to the ascendancy of a dominant centralizing power, or following the fragmentation of a formerly domi­nant power. 
Given the technology of precolumbian Maya warfare, site-oriented defenses may have simply consisted of selective site placement on inaccessi­ble hills or other defensible positions such as penin­sulas (Arkush and Stanish 2005; Dahlin 2000). Such defensive positioning seems probable forYax­chilan itself (located on a tight, omega shaped bend in the Usumacinta River), and for La Pasadita and Tecolote, whose main structures are perched on hilltops ringed by cliffs (Golden 2003; Golden, Scherer and Munoz 2005). Similarly, Piedras 
Negras is defensively located at a choke point where a narrow valley meets a bend in the river. 
Dahlin (2000, following Hassig 1988) argues that virtually nothing could protect a dispersed rural population and their sustaining agricultural fields outside such spatially limited defenses to enemy attack. In many areas of the Maya region this may be the case, but it is not at all clear that such limi­tations hold in the study zone. Fortified sites iden­tified to date all have nearby access to running water sources and food sources from those water sources. Such resources could have adequately sustained the small populations within these fortifications and allowed them to weather the immediate attack and the aftermath of the destruction of agricultural resources. 
In contrast, if defenses are "landscape ori­ented"-that is they consist of features that are not necessarily associated directly with the defense of a particular settlement, but are instead intended to defend the polity as a whole and block access to large portions of the landscape-the implications are that there was a polity capable of building, maintaining, and manning such defenses. These need not be "great walls" (Arkush and Stanish 2005: 10) extending over long distances. If the land­scape is suitably restricted, a relatively small for­tification may be sufficient to block access to an entire valley, as seems to be the case in the study . zone at sites such as El Bayal, La Pasadita, El Tunel, and Tecolote. Where the combination of military technology physical landscape permits such defenses (as in the broken terrain that covers much of the study zone), it is expected that landscape ori­ented defenses would have been created as politi­cal boundaries expanded, if and when a coherent territorial polity was created through the political consolidation of the landscape. 
Within a "landscape oriented" defensive sys­tem, fortified sites may also have served as offen­sive staging areas-places where troops from within the polity could safely gather and provision themselves on the eve of an attack before ventur­ing into enemy territory. Indeed, one of the roles played by sajal was apparently that of war captain, providing prisoners as tribute to their dynastic over­lords. For instance, La Pasadita Lintel 2 com­memorates a battle in A.D. 759 and features the sajal of La Pasadita and the king ofYaxchilan stand­ing over a captive noble from Piedras Negras (Fig­ure 6). It seems quite possible that the victorious Yaxchilan war party originated at La Pasadita. 
Synthesis 
When this body of data is considered as a whole, it is clear that rulership within the Piedras Negras and Yaxchilan kingdoms followed different trajec­tories. For Yaxchilan, placement of secondary cen­ters suggests a conscious effort to build a fortified border. Viewshed analysis indicates that all ofYax­chilan's secondary centers were in sight of Yax­chilan itself. To underscore this sense of watchfulness, powerful reminders of overlordship, such as architecture styles and commissioned mon­uments featuring the king of Yaxchilan, were employed. In contrast, the relationship between Piedras Negras and its subordinate centers was rel­atively loose, in many cases maximizing previously

existing political institutions at smaller sites. 
Nonetheless, local populations in both Late Clas­
sic kingdoms expressed through material culture­
i ncl uding ceramics, architecture, and burial 
patterns-a social identification with one or the 
other polity center. 
It is difficult to suggest why these two king­
doms chose different political strategies. Perhaps 
it relates to the unique political history of each 
kingdom. Current archaeological evidence mirrors 
the epigraphic data and suggests that during the 
eighth century, Piedras Negras was maintaining 
not only a contested border with Yaxchilan, but was 
also in regular conflict with Pomona and other king­
doms to the north (Anaya Hernandez 2005a, 
2005b). As a result there may not have been suffi­
cient resources and energy for Piedras Negras to 
fully dominate its subordinate centers. If Yaxchi­
lan had the advantage of only one border conflict, 
it may have been better positioned to invest in con­
trolling lesser centers within its polity. 
Such territorial conflicts typically result from the perception of limited landscape-derived resources. What were, though, the limited resources in the study zone that sparked a competitive, territorial expansion? Mineral resources including clay for pottery, limestone for building, and chert for tools are abundant and easily accessible across the region. Agricultural lands, however, may have been limited in light of growing Late Classic period pop­ulations. Soils research has shown the value of agri­cultural lands around the border zone (Johnson et al. 2007), and stable isotope analysis of human bone at Piedras Negras has demonstrated signifi­cant dietary perturbations leading into its collapse (Scherer et al. 2007). Beyond staple crops, the fact that modem cacao grows wildly in the region sug­gests it may have been an important area for cacao 
. production in antiquity. Trade routes may also have been a significant factor, especially in regards to the flow of imported prestige goods. Finally, the ritual landscape may have represented a limited resource, such as the contested access to caves 
around the border zone. 
Ultimately, the processes that shaped polity 
growth may have contributed to the early political 
collapse in the region. The precise causes of col­
lapse in the Middle Usumacinta basin remain elu­
sive. However, it is telling that despite the collapse 
of the primate centers around the tum of the ninth century, occupation continued at some sites in the region well into the ninth century (Golden, Scherer, and Mufioz 2005). This suggests to us that the roots of the collapse in the Middle Usumacinta basin are less likely grounded ecological issues of sustain­ability (see Scherer et al. 2007), and more likely rooted in the competitive political processes out­lined here. 
Conclusions 
In this paper, we have presented a model for Clas­sic Maya political developments in the Middle U sumacinta Basin, a region that was dominated in the Late Classic period by the Maya polities of Piedras Negras and Yaxchilan. Our model high­lights (1) the alternative political strategies employed by two neighboring Maya kingdoms, and (2) the continuing need for furiher regional research in Maya archaeology. Such research has particular relevance for ongoing attempts to model the nature of Maya states, particularly the debate over whether Maya polities were "strong states" or "weak states" (e.g., Chase and Chase 1996; Chase et al. 1990; Golden 2003). We would argue that ter­ritoriality and polity expansion were only signifi­cant considerations for Piedras Negras and Yaxchilan during the Late Classic period, which suggests to us that Maya polities were dynamic and the nature of political authority changed over the Classic period, at least in our research zone. Thus, we agree with others that the dichotomy between "weak states" and "strong states" must be abandoned (Marcus 2003; Sharer and Golden 2004), and we must consider regional and diachronic variability in Classic Maya political structures. In future publications, we hope to more explicitly address the theoretical underpinnings of our research in the Sierra del Lacand6n and use the data presented here to explore the nature of politi­cal dynamics in the western Maya lowlands.
