OBSIDIAN IN SOUTHERN ECUADOR: THE CARBONCILLO SOURCE 

Dennis E. Ogburn 
The Carboncillo area in the southern highlands of Ecuador is identified as the only confirmed source of archaeological obsidian located in the country outside of the northern highlands and is the first identified in the large gap between the known Ecuadorian and Peruvian sources. With the identification of this source, it can no longer be assumed that all obsid­ian f(mnd in Ecuador came from sources in the northern highlands. Thus the Carboncillo source has significant implica­tions for interpreting patterns of long-distance exchange in the Andes, especially in southern Ecuador and the far north of Peru. A geochemical analysis of the Carboncillo material shows that it can be easily distinguished from the obsidian from other Ecuadorian sources. A provenance study of archaeological obsidian samples from the southern highlands of Ecuador using x-ray.fluorescence demonstrates that the Carboncillo obsidian was used at the Preceramic site of Chobshi Cave and at a number (4 late prehispanic sites in the Saraguro region. The results indicate a high level of sociopolitical and eco­nomic isolation in late prehistory, most likely tied to a preoccupation with warfare between neighboring groups, and pro­vide additional evidence that the economic organization of the southern highlands differed 
markedly from that of the north during 1his rime.

archaeological research in Ecuador and the far northern highlands of Peru, in comparison to regions like the Titicaca Basin, the southern high­lands of Peru, and the Peruvian coast.A few notable sourcing studies have been conducted for Ecuador, including those by Asaro et al. ( 1994), Bellot-Gurlet et al. (1999a; Bellot-Gurlet et al. 1999b), Bigazzi et al. (1992), and Burger et al. (1994). But we still have an incomplete picture of the geographical and temporal limits of the exchange networks that involved the major obsidian sources, and few of those data pertain to the south of Ecuador. In the northern highlands of Peru, the pattern of procure­ment of obsidian is known from a number of archaeological sites (Burger et al. 2006), but little is known in the far north of that country beyond the site of Pacopampa. Without a significant data set of obsidian collected from excavation and sur­vey, we have little basis on which to judge to what extent obsidian was utilized in those less explored regions, which span over 400 km, and what sources provided the raw materials. 
The basic picture we have from published data suggests that there was no overlap in usage of obsid­ian from the Ecuadorian and Peruvian sources, with a border between distribution patterns lying some­where near the modem boundaries of the two coun­tries. This scenario is consistent with Burger's ( 1984) characterization of this zone as a prehistoric frontier between the cultural networks of Peru and Ecuador, which was based in part on obsidian stud­ies. This border was perhaps long standing but was particularly evident in late Formative times (ca. 400-200 B.C.). The frontier zone limited integra­tion between societies of north and south but was not an impermeable barrier, as illustrated by the long-distance movement of Spondylus and Strom­bus shell from the Ecuadorean coast into much of Peru. However, in a synthesis of more recent research, Guffroy (2008) characterizes this border area as one of strong interactions between neigh­boring groups. Rather than constituting a barrier to relations between fundamentally different cultural areas, this region is seen as one of continuing inter­action in all directions. According to Guffroy, the only major interruption between people of the north and the south occurred after ca. 600-700 A.D. with the arrival of populations ancestral to the Paltas, Bracamoros, etc. who settled in southernmost Ecuador. Thus we have two contrasting models of the levels of permeability and societal and eco­nomic interaction across this zone, though in either scenario the level of interaction is certain to have fluctuated significantly through time. Additional analyses of obsidian provenance can help us to fur­ther explore this issue and its chronological vari­ability. 
The gap in data is also connected to the geol­ogy of the Andes, as the creation and duration of major deposits of obsidian are constrained by the tectonics of the Andean region. As a natural glass, obsidian decomposes over time through the processes of devitrification and hydration, gradu­ally reducing the size of usable nodules. There is an upper limit in the tens of millions of years, after which time the material is no longer suitable for tool manufacture. Thus, exploitable sources of large nodules of high-quality obsidian (i.e., "major" sources) are primarily limited to zones of active or geologically recent volcanism. In the Andes, there is a large inactive zone between the Northern Vol­canic Zone (NVZ) and the Central Volcanic Zone (CVZ), spanning from 2°s to 14°S latitude (Fig­ure 1). The level of volcanism, i.e., the production and extrusion of magmas, is directly related to the tectonics of the Andes, specifically the angle of subduction of the N azca Plate underneath the South American Plate. In the NVZ and CVZ, the Nazca Plate subducts at 30°, whereas in the inactive zone, the angle of subduction is much shallower, at about 10-15°. It is unlikely that major sources of obsid­ian would exist far from the edges of these active zones. Current knowledge of Andean obsidian out­crops bears this out. The major known Ecuadorian sources are younger deposits, which lie securely within the NVZ, north of 0°30'S. In Peru, most sources are located within the CVZ, with the excep­tion of the Puzolana and Quispisisa sources, which are within 1° of latitude of the northern limit of active volcanism. 
On the whole, it is assumed that people living far from the activt> volcanic zones would not have had ready access to obsidian and would have either depended on long-distance travel or exchange net­works to obtain limited amounts of the material or chosen to rely exclusively on more easily available lithic materials. As a result, the amount of obsid­ian found in archaeological sites in the inactive zone should be low, decreasing with distance away from the sources. However, this pattern would be

different if some sources of obsidian existed in the inactive zone, providing access to material that could have been exploited on a local or suprare­gional basis. This latter scenario is conceivable because a belt of active volcanism spanned the length of the Andes through Ecuador and Peru in the Tertiary period, from about 26 mya to 3-5 mya (Sebrier and Soler 1991). In Ecuador, south of where the Guayaquil fault belt crosses the Andes ca. 3°S, volcanism had mostly ceased by 5 mya (Barberi et al. 1988), although isolated small vol­canic outcrops of the Salapa Formation have been dated to 2.4 mya (Hungerbiihler et al. 2000). The tail end of volcanism is recent enough that usable deposits of obsidian could survive, although per­haps only in small-sized nodules if the material was more than 10-15 million years old. Deposits of small nodules would constitute "minor" sources because there are significant limits on the range of tools that can be produced from the material. But such sources located firmly within the inactive zone could have played a much greater role than simi­lar minor sources located close to major deposits. 
This study addresses that gap in obsidian data in the Andes by presenting research on a newly identified source in the southern highlands of

Ecuador together with a provenance analysis of obsidian artifacts in the same region. The geo­chemical analysis of obsidian from this new source, known as Carboncillo, allows for the distinction of this obsidian from material from other sources in the Andes, while the provenance study offers a pre­liminary picture of the use and distribution of the source material and the extent to which obsidian from outside sources may have been utilized in the region. 
Because the Carboncillo source is located about 380 km from the main sources in northern Ecuador and 1,250 km from the nearest source in Peru, it was the most readily available obsidian for people in southern Ecuador and the far north of Peru. Thus the source is potentially important in understand­ing the procurement and distribution of obsidian in those regions.As Burger et al. (1994) detail in their pioneering study, obsidian, as a desirable or exotic material, could have played an important role in ancient exchange networks, and thus sourcing stud­ies have the potential to elucidate the political and economic relationships between people of differ­ent regions over time. Studies of such exchange net­works that include obsidian will need to take into account this new source, as it can no longer be assumed that obsidian found in southern Ecuador originated in the northern highlands. 
Obsidian Sources in Ecuador 
Because obsidian is a rhyolitic glass produced under a very specific set of volcanic conditions, it is very rare in nature and unevenly distributed in the world (Fink and Manley 1987). So even though Ecuador has been a center of concentrated volcanic activity, obsidian deposits are still quite rare in the country. In part, this is because andesitic rather than rhyolitic volcanism has been predominant in Ecuador (Bar­beri et al. 1988), as in much of the Andes. Prior to this study, all known Ecuadorian sources of archae­ological obsidian were restricted to an area in the northern highlands of Ecuador, in the Sierra de Gua­manf 50 km east-southeast of Quito. The sources are all located within 15 km of each other, at alti­tudes between 3,900 and 4,200 m (Burger et al. 1994:231) within the large Chacana caldera (Hall and Beate 1991; Hall and Mothes 1997). Only three sources have been identified as having high-quality material that also has been found in archaeological sites. These sources, Mullumica, Yanaurco­Quiscatola, and Callejones, were identified in large part by Ernesto Salazar (1980, 1992). As a group, these are about 1,600 km away from the northern­most source in Peru, and not surprisingly, archaeo­logical patterns of distribution of material from the two regions do not seem to overlap. 
According to available data, the most heavily exploited source was Mullumica, a large flow that may have been produced via the incomplete mix­ture of two different magmas within the same chamber (Asaro et al. 1 994) . The obsidian deposits at Yanaurco and Quiscatola, although located 5 km apart, are chemically indistinguishable (Asaro et al. 1994). They are breccia deposits apparently belong­ing to the same volcanic complex and extruded around the same time (Bigazzi et al. 1992:24). Because of the essentially identical chemical com­position, the two deposits have been treated as one source, known as Yanaurco-Quiscatola (or some­times as Quiscatola-Yanaurcu). This source accounts for most of the other obsidian artifacts included in provenance studies. Together, Mullu­mica and Yanaurco-Quiscatola account for the great majority of obsidian analyzed from archaeological sites in the highland and coastal areas of Ecuador (Asaro et al . 1994; Bellot-Gurlet et al . I 999a; Bellot-Gurlet et al. I 999b; Burger et al. 1994) , as well as some artifacts from the coast (Bellot-Gurlet 1998; Bellot-Gurlet et al. I 999a; Bellot-Gurlet et al. 1999b) and highlands (Gudino et al. 2001) of Colombia. The broad pattern of exploitation of these obsidians at source quarries over time included the production of blanks, blades, and flakes for distribution to other locales (Burger et al. 1994) . In late prehispanic times after ca. 500 A.D., the production of bifaces such as projectile points seems to have declined precipitously, and obsidian became used primarily in the form of expedient flakes. 
A third source, known as Callejones, was pro­duced around the same time as the Mullumica flow and is chemically related to that material (Bigazzi et al. 1992:24, 29). Recent data (Bellot-Gurlet et al. 2008) show that, like Mullumica, Callejones obsidian is variable in composition. But use of the Callejones material appears to have been much more limited, as analyses have attributed few arti­facts to that source. Among them, Bellot-Gurlet et al. (l 999a; Bellot-Gurlet et al. l 999b) identified

seven archaeological samples (of unspecified archaeological provenience) as matching the chem­ical composition of Callejones, Ogburn et al. (2009) attribute five artifacts from sites in the nearby Pam­bamarca region to the source, and Salgado et al. ( 1995) attribute one artifact from the site of La Bocana in Colombia to Callejones. 
There are several other primary obsidian deposits recorded in the Sierra de Guamanf region, includ­ing Potrerillos, El Tabion, and Yurac Paccha (Bigazzi et al. 1992). At present, no artifacts have been attributed to these sources. The quality of obsidian from most of these sources may be unsuit­able for stone tool production, as noted for the El Tabion and Potrerillos material (Asaro et al. 1994:258; Burgeretal. 1994:230).Alsoin the region are secondary deposits of material from the Mullu­mica, Yanaurco, and Quiscatola flows, which could have been exploited for toolmaking material. 
Recent research by Bellot-Gurlet et al. (2008) has revealed additional obsidian deposits in the northern highlands, but their suitability for tool­making is unclear, and it is currently unknown whether any of those were exploited in prehistory. Along or just outside the southeast rim of the Cha­cana caldera, obsidian nodules were found in sec­ondary deposits along Rio Aliso, Rio Bermejo, and Rio Cosanga .Around the Cotopaxi volcano, 55 km to the south of Quito, two different volcanic deposits contained obsidian nodules up to 5 cm in diameter. A I-to 2-m-thick lahar at the Mojanda volcano to the north of Quito contained small obsid­ian nodules, of less than 1.5 cm in diameter; these match the chemical composition of Yanaurco­Quiscatola obsidian and are possibly secondary deposits from that source (Bellot-Gurlet et al. 2008:283). 
At least two additional archaeological obsidian sources in the northern highlands are indicated by the composition of artifacts that have been analyzed but not assigned to a known deposit. Of artifacts analyzed from the site of La Chimba, 55 km to the northeast of Quito, Asaro et al. (1 994) report one sample with a distinct chemical composition. Ogburn et al. (2009) attribute an additional seven samples to the same source, referred to as the "La Chimba type." Two possible obsidian artifacts found near the archaeological site of El Inga also have a chemical composition distinct from known sources (Bigazzi et al. 1992). These sources are likely to be located near the known deposits in the Sierra de Guamanf or elsewhere in the northern highlands of Ecuador. 
Another unidentified obsidian source accounts for two flakes analyzed from Chobshi Cave in the southern highlands of Ecuador by Burger et al. (1989; Burger et al. 1994). The authors suggest that the original source for those two artifacts may be located somewhere to the north of the major sources of Mullumica and Yanaurco-Quiscatola. However, based on published data and the results of this study, it appears that the two artifacts derived from the Car­boncillo source near Saraguro, and they are con­sidered in more detail in this analysis and discussion. 
Finally, Temme (1982) reports another possi­ble source of obsidian nodules in the southern highlands, 8 km to the northeast of Loma Cubilan, placing it about 30 km from the town of Saraguro. It is possible that this material is related to the Car­boncillo obsidian, but the exact relationship can­not be assessed yet because no additional data are available . 
The Carboncillo Source 
During settlement survey of the Saraguro region in the southern highlands of Ecuador, obsidian was found at numerous archaeological sites, in the form of small flakes and nodules (Ogburn 2001). Based on the occurrence of a number of nodules at the site of Leon Dormido, it was thought that the obsid­ian might be of local origin, possibly deriving from the volcanic rock formation of Leon Dormido itself. Subsequent survey to the north of Saraguro revealed obsidian nodules that appeared to be in a primary or secondary geological, rather than archaeological, context, and conversations with a number of local people familiar with Carboncillo confirmed that the area was in fact a local source of obsidian. 
Location and Geological Setting 
The obsidian nodules of this southern highlands source are found scattered in the area known as Car­boncillo (Figures 2 and 3), encompassing a stretch of paramo lying between the towns of Paquishapa and Ofia at elevations from 2,900 to 3,060 m. The topography comprises gently sloping land and modest hills, including one named Loma Carbon­cillo. The area is cut by creeks and rivers, all of

which drain into the river of Quebrada Apuguin or the Rio Paquishapa, tributaries of the Rio Ju bones. The name of Carboncillo derives from the local obsidian, meaning essentially "little piece of char­coal," indicating that the material was prevalent and distinct enough to be of note to local inhabitants. Because of the concurrence between the place­name and the obsidian, the name Carboncillo is adopted here as the name of the source. 
Survey in Carboncillo found the density of obsidian nodules on the surface to be quite sparse, and no significant concentrations of the material have been located. In part, the low apparent den­sity is due to the fact that most of the land is cov­ered in vegetation, including native paramo grass and shrub vegetation, and on perhaps more than half the land, stands of introduced pine trees, which almost completely obscure the ground surface (Fig­ure 3). As a result, obsidian nodules are only visi­ble along trails through the area. Surface finds of obsidian have also been depleted from centuries of collection. 
Rock outcrops are rare in the Carboncillo area, and it is difficult to discern if there are any remain­ing potential primary deposits of the obsidian. There are outcrops of rhyolite to the north and northwest, at Las Escaleras and Hueledel, but energy-dispersive x-ray fluorescence (EDXRF) analysis of samples of rock that I collected from those areas indicate that those rhyolites are not

closely related chemically to the Carboncillo obsid­

ian. Thus they are not likely to have been a prod­
uct of the same magma that produced the 
Carboncillo obsidian. It appears most likely that all 
of the material has been eroded out of the original 
deposits and that it now only occurs in secondary 
contexts. 
Outside of Carboncillo, obsidian nodules have 

been reported from the community of La Papaya . (Figure 2), which is to the west of Carboncillo and ; on the other side of the Rio Paquishapa, which forms a significant canyon along that stretch. Nod­ules have also been collected around the Saraguro Valley and at Cubilan to the northwest of Carbon­cillo (Temme 1982). All of these areas lie near or at least partly within the same geological forma­tion as Carboncillo (Hungerbiihler et al. 2000), so it is likely that the obsidian was naturally deposited in those disparate locations via the same explosive volcanic event that produced the Carboncillo mate­rial. Another possibility is that obsidian was col­
lected from Carboncillo and curated elsewhere in prehispanic times, to be rediscovered later as sur­face finds. This may well be the case around the Saraguro Valley, given the density of prehispanic habitation sites. 
Geologically, the Carboncillo area belongs to the Tarqui Formation (Hungerbiihler et al. 2000; Mi­nisterio de Recursos Naturales y Energeticos, Direc­ci6nGeneral de Geologfa y Minas [MRNE,DGGM] 1973), a sheet of volcanic deposits that covers sig­nificant territory in the southern highlands of Ecuador. The Tarqui Formation comprises a sequence "dominated by pyroclastics consisting of rhyolitic to andesitic agglomerates, tuffs, ash-flow tuffs and ignimbrites" (Baldock 1982:29). The for­mation had been assigned a Quaternary age (Bal­dock 1982; MRNE, DGGM 1973) and then a much earlier Tertiary date of 11.2-15.4 mya, which put it in the Miocene epoch (Barberi et al. 1988). Recent data (Steinmann et al. 1999) have more reliably dated the formation to the late Miocene, at 5. J-6.8 mya.

Figure 4. Examples of Carboncillo obsidian nodules showing variation in surface appearance: a) thin layer of cortex, b) etched or pitted texture, c) finely layered, d) tarry texture. Most samples exhibit some layering and fine pitting. 
The form and distribution of Carboncillo obsid­ian resemble those of the Puzolana source in Peru, which is also composed of Tertiary volcanic prod­ucts that occur in small nodules under 4 cm and were distributed in disparate locations (Burger and Glas­cock 2000b). Carboncillo is also similar to some Ter­tiary sources in the Southwest United States, such as Tank Mountains, Sand Tanks, and Sauceda Mountains, which likewise consist of small nodules of high-quality glass (Shackley 2005). It is quite likely that the Carboncillo material was originally embedded in ignimbrite deposits of the Tarqui For­mation, which subsequently eroded in certain loca­tions to expose isolated nodules of obsidian. This would explain the distribution of the nodules on the landscape and suggests the possibility of additional locales where obsidian may be encountered in the greater Saraguro area. 
Description of Material 
Carboncillo obsidian occurs only as small lapilli, varying in shape from rounded to angular, with most specimens being subrounded or subangular. In maximum dimension, most examples measure between 2 and 2.5 cm, and the largest encountered so far is 3.2 cm. Elsewhere, obsidian nodules of this size are often referred to as marekanites or "Apache tears" (Shackley 2005: 114).
The obsidian is always black in color, appear­ing a translucent gray color in thin flakes. This con­trasts with variations in color and translucency noted in Mullumica obsidian. The surface texture of the Carboncillo obsidian nodules shows a range of variability. Most do not have any significant amount of cortex; those that do exhibit a thin brownish layer. Many nodules are finely layered, others are pitted and dimpled, and occasional exam­ples have a tarry appearance (Figure 4). The exam­ples with a pitted surface texture closely resemble tektites (glass nodules produced by the impact of an asteroid or large meteor) in size and appearance, but the pitted texture of the Carboncillo obsidian is likely a product of the interface between the glass and the ignimbrite matrix in which it was embed­ded. A tektite origin of the Carboncillo material can be ruled out because the nodules lack schlieren (contorted flow lines) and lechatelierite (particles of pure silica, often drawn out in wavy trails) , two

of the identifying features of tektites; they also have 
higher concentrations of microlites (small crystals) 
than tektites. 
The obsidian is mainly free of macroscopic 
inclusions; in rare cases there are a few quartz crys­
tals imbedded in the material . The Carboncillo 
obsidian is well suited to flaking, as it exhibits 
excellent conchoidal fracture, is not very prone to 
shatter, and produces a fine, sharp cutting edge. 
However, the small size of the nodules limits the 
use of the material in terms of manufacturing 

, bifaces or other medium to large-sized tools. Pri­

marily, the obsidian is suited to making small flakes 
for use as expedient cutting tools. 
The obsidian contains several different forms of 
microlites, which are visible in thin section; aligned 
concentrations of these microlites account for the 
apparent layering in many examples. Some exam­
ples contain micro lites in the form of spiderlike or 
asteroidal trichites (Figure 5), similar to those seen 
in obsidian from Dairy Creek, Idaho (Stevenson et 
al. 1996:30 I), and Cougar Mountain, Oregon. Most 
examples contain numerous small, wavy inclu­sions, which are most likely chains of Fe-Ti oxides (Figure 6), as supported by electron microprobe measurements that indicated high concentrations of Fe and Ti. These microscopic features are not visible to the naked eye and seem to have no effect on the physical properties of the material other than contributing to the overall color. 
Chemistry 
Geochemical analysis of the Carboncillo obsidian included the measurement of concentrations of major, minor, and trace elements. Major and minor element composition (Table 1) was measured via electron microprobe analysis conducted at the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences, Uni­versity of California, Berkeley, with measurements taken from one polished thin section. The major element composition is typical of obsidians reported elsewhere in the world (e.g., Lajciikova and Kraus 1993; Shackley 2005; Stevenson et al. 1996), with the level of silica, at 77 .1 percent, being at the top end of the range.

Measurements were made using a Spec­trace Quanx EDXRF instrument at the Archaeo­logical Research Facility at the University of California, Berkeley. The samples were collected from the Carboncillo area and around the Saraguro region. The results show that the material is rather homogeneous in concentration, indicating that the obsidian originated from a single magma source and possibly from a single extrusive or explosive event. The composition of the material is also dis­tinct from that of other Ecuadorian sources, con­firming that Carboncillo represents a distinct source and should be considered in provenance studies of archaeological material. 
Provenance of Archaeological Obsidian from the Southern Highlands 
The geochemical analysis of the Carboncillo source samples was complemented by a provenance study of archaeological material from the southern high­lands of Ecuador, to determine whether this local obsidian was utilized in prehispanic times.Another goal of the analysis was to gauge to what extent material from the northern Ecuadorian sources may have been obtained and whether any obsidian from the Peruvian sources appeared in the area. The data on local vs. imported obsidian were evaluated to potentially better understand exchange networks in the southern highlands of Ecuador and the region's level of interaction with the far north of Peru.

Archaeological Sites in the Saraguro Region. For this study, 94 obsidian artifacts from 11 sites in the Saraguro region (Figure 2, Table 3), dating to the Integration period (ca. A.D. 500-1450) and Inca period(ca.A.D. 1450-1534), were analyzed. Most of the samples were collected during a regional settlement survey (Ogburn 2001) during which obsidian was usually found in low quantities on the surface and in trowel probes in about one-quarter of the sites recorded. In part the low numbers were a result of the prevalence of ground cover, which frequently inhibited visibility of all artifact types and did not allow for any reasonable measure of the frequency of use of obsidian vs. other materi­als. But in general obsidian appears to have been used for flaking much less than chert, which was frequently encountered in the form ofunretouched flakes of varying sizes. The obsidian artifacts were mostly small unretouched flakes, sometimes accompanied by small nodules, including flaked and unworked examples, as listed in Table 3. No projectile points or fragments of projectile points were found to be made from obsidian, and it seems that flaked-stone projectile points were not pro­duced during late prehispanic times, as they have not been reported from any such contexts in the southern highlands. During the survey of the . Saraguro area, two chert bifaces were encountered 

' at the site of Cochapamba, but the site lacked diag­nostic ceramics, so those pieces cannot be consid­ered representative of Integration or Inca period lithic forms. 
The obsidian artifacts were found only in hill­top settlements, the predominant site type of the area. In addition, the obsidian was primarily found in the upper habitation terraces of the settlements, suggesting that its distribution was limited to the people living in the upper parts of the sites or that usage was restricted to domestic activities. 
For this study, the obsidian samples collected during the settlement survey were analyzed, along with samples collected during later fieldwork at a similar site, Loma Shio. That site is also a hilltop habitation settlement but is located to the north of the Saraguro Valley and the Carboncillo obsidian source (see Figure 2). Data from Loma Shio can potentially illuminate whether people living in a separate area also had access to and were utilizing the Carboncillo obsidian. 
Unfortunately, few sites in the Saraguro Valley had an occupation dating to the earlier periods. It is likely that the central area around Saraguro was relatively unoccupied during earlier phases because of the high density of the original vegetation cover, which required significant effort to clear to prepare land for agriculture and permanent settlements. A numberof Precerarnic sites (ca. 13 ,000-3500 B .C .) have been recorded to the north of the Saraguro Val­ley (Temme 1982), and other sites dating to the For­mative period (ca. 3500-500 B.C.) and Regional Development period (ca. 500 B.C.--ca. A.D. 500) are also found somewhat outside the central area. 
While most of the sites have been dated to the Integration period based on ceramics, many were likely occupied into the Inca period; this has been confirmed for the site of Leon Pugllana, where Inca ceramics have been found. The situation is com­plex for two sites, Leon Dormido and Willka­marka. The two are actually part of the same site, which includes an Integration period settlement and an Inca administrative site and storage center. They were assigned separate numbers and names in the field to distinguish the local habitation site from the ruins of the Inca administrative site, Willkamarka, which lie to the east of the rock for­mation. Leon Dormido is the name applied to the early Integration period settlement, which encom­passes a large amount of land, including the vol­canic formation of Leon Dormido, the slopes of

In addition to the samples from habi­tation sites, the analysis included two isolated obsidian artifacts that were collected along the ridges above the community of Quisquinchir, which lies l .5 km to the north of the town of Saraguro. The isolated finds include one flake and a small core . In physical appearance, both artifacts are different from the Carboncillo source samples and in particular are more translucent. The core exhibits layering that differs in appearance from that of layered Carboncillo nodules. As they are iso­lates, there is no date assigned to these artifacts, but they do have the potential to reveal whether non­local obsidian was brought into the region at some point in prehistory. Chohshi Cave. Chobshi Cave is a modest-sized 


rockshelter located about 35 km southeast of the city of Cuenca near the town of Sigsig. The site was utilized in the Preceramic period, and research at the site (Lynch 1989; Lynch and Pollock 1980, 1981) has provided uncalibrated dates of ca. 10 ,000 and 7500 B.P. Looting activity at the site has been heavy; this has continued up to the present, greatly impacting the stratigraphy of the deposits. A range of lithic materials has been found in the cave, including flakes and finished tools of chert and obsidian. Of 11 obsidian artifacts analyzed from Chobshi Cave by Burger et al. (1989; Burger et al. 1994), five came from Mullumica, and three were from Yanaurco-Quiscatola. Three samples remained unassigned. The chemical composition of one of those was close to both the Mullumica and Callejones material, and it likely came from one of those sources. The other two artifacts were small flakes, with a composition unlike any of the identified sources, but they could potentially have come from the Carboncillo source, located 70 km to the south. Unfortunately, the samples are no longer available for additional analysis, so their provenance can only be assessed based on the pub­lished data from the original investigation. How­ever, concentrations for a number of elements measured for the Chobshi Cave samples were also measured for the Carboncillo source samples, suf­
ficient for comparison. 
Results 
To establish provenance of the archaeological obsidian samples, their chemical compositions were compared with the data obtained for the Car­boncillo source samples and with published data for obsidian from the sources in the northern high­lands of Ecuador: Mullumica, Yanaurco­Quiscatola, Callejones, and the La Chimba type. The comparative data for the northern sources were taken from Asaro et al. (1994) and Bigazzi et al. (1992) in combination with data from the analysis of archaeological materials by Ogburn et al. (2009). Those analyses included measurements made at least in part with x-ray fluorescence (XRF) and are thus the most compatible with the data obtained for this study; the analysis of Ogburn et al. (2009) was conducted using the same instrument as in the cur­rent study. Although the data for the northern sources come from analysis of a limited number of source samples (plus archaeological samples), they do exhibit sufficient variation from the Carbon­cillo material that obsidian from the different sources can be easily distinguished based on plots of Sr vs. Zr (Figure 7) and Sr vs. Fe (Figure 8). 
It is worth noting that there may be some lim­ited utility in visual sourcing in regard to assess­ing the presence of Carboncillo obsidian in sites in southern Ecuador. In particular, the consis­tency in color and size of the Carboncillo source may provide the potential to use visual charac­teristics to exclude archaeological obsidian sam­ples from a Carboncillo provenance. Specifically, because Carboncillo material is very uniform in color (a glossy black that is translucent only in thin flakes, wherein it appears gray) and occurs in small nodules, any flakes or tools exhibiting different colors or measuring over 4 to 5 cm may be assumed to come from other sources. But the converse does not necessarily hold true, as small black flakes of obsidian could have come from other sources in the northern highlands. Micro­scopic examination of flaked obsidian may also prove useful in distinguishing Carboncillo mate­rial, provided that adequate analysis is done for obsidian from other sources. The presence of chains of Fe-Ti oxides (Figure 6) and asteroidal trichites (Figure 5) in the Carboncillo obsidian may prove to be distinctive enough to reliably

numbers for a few elements, such as sample 18a­1, which had the highest measured numbers for both Ti and Fe. However, those samples still closely matched the Carboncillo obsidian in other ele­ments. Thus it is likely that these samples are out­liers and that for some elements, the measurements on the 33 source samples did not fully encompass the range of variation for the material. Also, for the smallest samples analyzed, there was a tendency for measured levels of some elements, notably Rb, Sr, and Zr, to be on the low end compared with 
larger flakes and whole nodules; the source sam­ples were all nodules. 
As illustrated in the bivariate plots for Sr vs. Zr (Figure 7) and Sr vs. Fe (Figure 8), the samples from archaeological sites cluster with the Carboncillo source samples. They do not fall within the ranges for the Mullumica, Yanaurco-Quiscatola, and Callejones sources, with one exception. This sam­ple, l 8a-7, fell within the range for Yanaurco­Quiscatola in the plot for Sr vs. Zr. The small size of this artifact put it close to the instrument thresh-

the composition of the Carboncillo source mater­ial. Thus all 94 samples measured by XRF can be confidently assigned to the Carboncillo source. 
One additional sample was too small to obtain useful data from XRF, but microscopic examina­tion revealed that it contains microlites typical of the Carboncillo material and was also the same color as other samples of similar thickness. On this basis, it is reasonable to assume that this sample came from the Carboncillo source rather than from any distant source. 
Of course, it would be ideal to analyze samples from excavated contexts, especially to examine changes in obsidian procurement through time. But in this case , it is much less of an issue because all of the obsidian artifacts collected from the sites were shown to derive from the Carboncillo source. Thus, there is little concern that we are missing out on detecting significant changes through time . 
Isolates. In contrast to the obsidian from the archaeological sites of Saraguro, the chemical com­position of the two isolated artifacts does not match that of the Carboncillo source. This is not surpris­ing, given that the appearance of both isolates is notably different from the Carboncillo obsidian. Furthermore, the two artifacts differ markedly in concentrations for several elements, notably Fe, Sr, and Zr. When compared with the data for obsid­ian artifacts from the Pambamarca region in north­ern Ecuador (Ogburn et al. 2009), the composition of Isolate I matches the composition of the high­Fe type of obsidian from the Mullumica source, while Isolate 2 matches that of the low-Fe type from the same source (see Figures 7 and 8). 
Chobshi Cave. In the analyses of Burger et al. (1989; Burger et al. 1994), the two flakes from Chobshi Cave, BUR-56 and BUR-59, were mea­sured by a combination of neutron activation analy­sis and XRF. Five of the elements measured in that study, Fe, Mn, Rb, Sr, and Zr, were also measured in the current study, which allows for a compari­son to the obsidian from the Carboncillo source. In fact, the values for all five elements (Table 5) lie within or very close to the ranges recorded for the Carboncillo source samples and entirely within the range measured for the artifacts assigned to the Carboncillo source. The bivariate plots (Figures 7 and 8) show how well the Chobshi samples corre­spond with the Carboncillo material and how dis­tinct they are from the northern Ecuadorian obsidians. On this basis, it is realistic to conclude that the two flakes from Chobshi Cave derived from the Carboncillo source, rather than from an unknown source in the northern highlands, as orig­inally suggested by Burger et al. (1994). 
Discussion 
Distribution of Obsidian in the Southern Highlands 
In their initial study of obsidian distribution in Ecuador, Burger et al. conclude that "the prehis­toric peoples in central and southern Ecuador who used obsidian apparently acquired all of the mate­rial through direct or indirect exchange links with the people of the northern Ecuadorian highlands" (1994: 234). Now, with the identification of the Car­boncillo source and the geochemical analysis of artifacts from Saraguro, we know that a significant amount of the obsidian exploited in the southern highlands derived from a local source, while very little material was brought from distant sources into the Saraguro region. 
The only pieces of obsidian in this analysis that were imported into the region are the two isolated artifacts, which derived from the Mullumica source of northern Ecuador, 400 km from Saraguro. This is one of the farthest distances so far documented for the dispersal of material from this source toward the south. Material from Mullumica was distrib­uted an even greater distance toward the north, as indicated by an artifact found at the Pubenza site near Bogota, Colombia (Gudino et al. 2001). Thus it is possible that Mullumica obsidian made its way even farther south than Saraguro during prehis­panic times. Nonetheless, in this case because these artifacts are isolates of an unknown date of manu­facture, they currently add little more to our under­standing of patterns of obsidian distribution in Ecuador beyond demonstrating how far material was distributed from the source. 
The assignment of the two flakes from the Pre­ceramic occupation of Chobshi Cave to the Car­boncillo source demonstrates that people using the rockshelter had obtained material from both south­ern and northern sources. This is both the earliest

known use of the Carboncillo material and the old­est site to contain obsidian from both regions of Ecuador. However, the long occupation of the cave means that the inhabitants did not necessarily have contemporaneous access to obsidian from both areas, as patterns of procurement could have shifted over time. Interestingly, they may have obtained more obsidian from the northern sources, which, unlike the Carboncillo marekanites, were suited to the manufacture of bifaces, an important compo­nent of Precerarnic lithic assemblages. 
The people using Chobshi Cave were probably acquiring lithic material based on a combination of functional needs and convenience of access. Notably, chert and other more locally available materials were used much more frequently than obsidian (Lynch and Pollock 1980). Because the Carboncillo source was about 70 km from Chob­shi, they could have had direct access to the mate­rial, choosing to curate some of the material for when they needed the type of expedient, sharp cut­ting implements that could be produced with those nodules. With the Mullumica and Yanaurco­Quiscatola sources over 300 km away from the cave, it is likely that obsidian from those sources was obtained indirectly, specifically for making more elaborate tools such as bifaces. 
In stark contrast to the situation at Chobshi Cave, Carboncillo obsidian was used in the Inte­gration period and Inca period sites in the Saraguro region to the near exclusion of material from the northern highlands. Obviously, the Saraguro sites, dating to the Integration period and Inca period, represent a sociopolitical, economic, and cultural context far different from the Preceramic period occupation of Chobshi Cave, and a number of fac­tors could explain the difference in obsidian dis­tribution. Without knowledge of the location of the Carboncillo obsidian source, the results of this provenance analysis would have led to some inter­esting interpretations because the default assump­tion was that usable obsidian deposits are only to be found in northern Ecuador. By following this assumption, as did Burger et al. (1 994) for the two samples from Chobshi Cave, this would have implied that the inhabitants of Saraguro had exclu­sive preference for a material from a distant loca­tion, one that was seldom used in other parts of Ecuador. The use of a minor northern highland source to the exclusion of obsidian from the major Mullumica and Yanaurco-Quiscatola sources also would have been hard to explain. Instead, the iden­tification of Carboncillo as a local source allows us to better assess the patterns of obsidian pro­curement in the region. 
There are several possible explanations for the predominant use of Carboncillo obsidian in the Saraguro region during late prehistory. First , changes in available technology may have led to a decrease in the use of flaked-stone tools in favor of other materials, with a concomitant decrease in demand for large-sized obsidian material but con­tinued need for expedient flakes for cutting . Bifaces and other finished flaked-stone tools of any mate­rial were rarely seen during survey of the region (Ogburn 200 1), which could indicate that the tech­nology had faded from use during the Integration period. Metal tools may well have supplanted flaked-stone implements, as bronze axes and knives were produced during the Integration period. In addition, types of weapons used for warfare and hunting may have shifted from projectiles with

flaked-stone points to clubs, slingstones, and maces with ground-stone or metal heads. 

However, archaeological evidence for such changes is mixed. Numerous stone mace heads have been found in the Saraguro region, but metal artifacts appear to be quite rare in the archaeolog­ical record. It is possible that bronze tools were lim­ited in availability, possibly restricted to ceremonial or elite usage. Also, general patterns in the Andes indicate that while flaked-stone tools such as pro­jectile points remained in use in late prehispanic times, they were not as common as before, and the occurrence of obsidian in archaeological sites in southern Peru declined noticeably (Burger et al. 2000). In the end, more data are needed from exca­vation to supplement those available from surface collection to fully assess the usage of chipped-stone tools in southern Ecuador. 
Another possibility is that a shift in cultural prac­tices, specifically subsistence strategies, led to a decline in the use of finished stone tools. The avail­ability of domesticated camelids and guinea pigs in late prehistory may have led to a decline in the importance of hunting, which was noted to be the case for the Incas (Rowe 1946:217). Such a decrease in hunting would have led to a concomi­tant reduction in the need for flaked-stone projec­tile points; but again, more excavation data are needed to assess this possibility in southern Ecuador. 
These cultural or technological changes could have singly or in combination led to the decline in the production of finished flaked-stone tools, thus limiting the demand for high-quality obsidian of large dimension. At the same time, the continued need for expedient tools for cutting could have led to the continued or increased exploitation of Car­boncillo obsidian as a utilitarian resource. 
Alternatively, the lack of imported obsidian in Saraguro could reflect a significant level of sociopolitical and economic isolation of the region during the Integration period, which could be directly tied to an increasing preoccupation with warfare in late prehispanic times. That the people in the region were concerned with warfare is sug­gested by shifts in settlement patterns to defensi­ble hilltop locations, along with reported surface finds of mace heads in those sites (Ogburn 2001). A preoccupation with warfare was widespread in the Andes during this time, and this general settle­ment pattern is also frequently noted for the con­temporaneous Late Intermediate period in Peru. Economic isolation in the Saraguro region is also suggested by the lack of surface evidence of other imported items; e.g., no Spondylus shell, exotic ceramics, or other imported raw materials or fin­ished goods have been found in the area. Likewise, excavations at the Integration period site of Ramos (also known as Cafii), located just to the south of Saraguro, revealed no imported materials (Idrovo 1996; Villon 1996). While it is not clear that obsid­ian was a high-status material in late prehispanic Ecuador (Burger et al. 1994), large nodules were still inherently valuable for the manufacture of high-quality knives, projectile points, and other tools. Thus the large-sized raw material found in the northern highlands could have been traded over long distances to anyone who desired high-quality stone for flaking, as it was in earlier times. If flaked­stone tools (as opposed to expedient unworked flakes) did not become entirely superfluous in the Integration period, then it is most likely that social and political factors, such as warfare, would explain the absence of imported obsidian in the Saraguro region. 
Obsidian data from Peru reflect a similar pat­tern of isolation during certain time periods. In the highlands of Ancash (Burger et al. 2006), analyses have shown that obsidian became available during the times of widespread influence of Chavfn de Huantar in the Early Horizon and the Wari Empire of the Middle Horizon. But the material does not appear in the intermediate periods following the decline of those two centers (the Early Intermedi­ate period and Late Intermediate period, respec­tively), indicating episodes of relative isolation. In the Jauja region of the Peruvian central highlands, obsidian may not have been imported into the area during the Late Intermediate period or during the Inca occupation (Russell 1988), even though the major Quispisisa source was only about 250 km away. Instead it appears that people were reusing material that had been imported during the Middle Horizon, as indicated by the comparison of obsid­ian hydration rinds from sites from the different time periods. This reuse indicates that obsidian was still a desirable or useful material, so the absence of new material is more likely attributable to shifts in the political and economic landscape than to some shift in tool technology away from flaked-

stone tools. The Late Intermediate period of Peru roughly corresponds with the latter part of the Inte­gration period of Ecuador, and it appears that dur­ing that time, the long-distance movement of obsidian from the sources in the north of Ecuador declined significantly after reaching its height in the preceding Regional Development period , ca. 300 B.C.-A.D. 500 (Bigazzi et al. 1992; Burger et al. 1994). 
While Carboncillo obsidian was certainly a use­ful resource for people in the southern highlands, it was one that would have been very difficult to control. There are no known concentrations of the material; instead, nodules are spread across the landscape, found over an area that could measure anywhere from 10 to 100 km2 in extent. Collect­ing nodules of Carboncillo obsidian is an oppor­tunistic event, and it would have been difficult for in di victuals to gather large amounts of the obsidian for gaining an advantage in trade. Moreover, indi­viduals or groups would not have been able to closely monitor or control the collection of mate­rial. The Carboncillo paramo was rather uninhab­ited, and people crossing through the area could have picked up obsidian nodules unimpeded. Thus it is unlikely that control of the local obsidian was a major goal in the Inca conquest of the region. However, the provision of obsidian to the state may have been part of the labor obligation of the local people, as appears to have been the case to the east of Quito in northern Ecuador (Ogburn et al. 2009). 
An interesting comparison can be made between the uses and distributions of the Carboncillo obsid­ian and that from the Puzolana source in Peru, which is another Tertiary source of marekanites of the same quality and size range. As with Carbon­cillo, Puzolana material was opportunistically exploited and limited in distribution mostly to the local region (Burger and Glascock 2000b). How­ever, there were some marked differences in the procurement and distribution of obsidian in the dif­ferent regions. Carboncillo obsidian was distributed farther, as indicated by its use at Chobshi Cave, 70 km from the source; so far Puzolana obsidian has only been found in sites located much closer to the source deposits. In the Puzolana area, significant percentages of recovered obsidian artifacts came from other sources, whereas in Saraguro, the peo­ple relied almost exclusively on the local material. Most likely, these differences can be attributed to 
the distribution of obsidian sources in the Andes. The Carboncillo source is much more isolated than other sources in Ecuador and Peru, situated 380 km from the nearest usable deposit. In contrast, there are two other obsidian sources located within 100 km of the Puzolana source, one of which is the Quispisisa source, one of the primary sources exploited in prehispanic Peru. In fact, none of the known sources in Peru is located more than 200 km from another usable obsidian source. This dif­ference in the distribution of sources provided a dif­ferent set of choices and opportunities for the people living in Ecuador and Peru when it came to procuring lithic materials. The Puzolana and Car­boncillo obsidians were used often in their respec­tive local contexts because it was convenient. However, the people living near the Puzolana source also had relatively easy access to obsidian in larger-sized nodules from another source and took advantage of that opportunity. The people liv­ing in the Saraguro region were much more con­strained in terms ofobtaining larger-sized material. 
On the whole, the isolation of the Carboncil!o source from other deposits of usable obsidian makes it likely that Carboncillo obsidian was a more important resource than similar sources in Peru. Given the absence of other sources in the gap between the Peruvian sources and those in north­ern Ecuador, it is likely that Carboncillo was dis­tributed much farther than Puzolana obsidian, certainly to other parts of the provinces of Loja and Azuay and possibly to the coast and the eastern low­lands and into the far north of Peru. The small nod­ule size of the obsidian may not have always been a drawback, as the ability to make small, extremely sharp flakes was useful throughout prehistory. For example, in the Ancash highlands of Peru, obsid­ian from Middle Horizon to late Intermediate con­texts at the settlement of Chinchawas primarily consisted of small flakes utilized for cutting (Burger et al. 2006). In addition to serving as the nearest source for a significant area, Carboncillo could have occasionally served as a substitute obsidian source over a wider area during periods when access to obsidian from the north of Ecuador became interrupted. Such interruptions could have entailed natural events like major eruptions of vol­canoes such as Quilotoa (Hall and Mothes 2008 ; Mothes and Hall 2008) or major sociopolitical changes. The extent of distribution to the south into

the far northern highlands of Peru may have been limited by a cultural frontier between Ecuador and Peru during some, if not most, of the prehispanic era (Burger 1984), or perhaps it was only restricted during later times (after ca. A.O. 600) due to the immigration of new groups into the south of Ecuador (Guffroy 2008). Further archaeological research in these less explored areas will help assess the extent of the distribution of Carboncillo obsid­ian and these different scenarios. 
Exchange Systems and Patterns of Obsidian Distribution in Ecuador 
The economic isolation of the Saraguro region dur­ing the Integration period, as indicated by the obsid­ian analysis and observations of other materials from surface collections, contrasts significantly with general patterns of exchange in earlier peri­ods of Ecuadorian prehistory and for other sites in the southern highlands. Notably, during the For­mative period (3500-300 B.C.), archaeological research indicates the existence of systems of inter­regional exchange involving much of Ecuador (Bruhns 2003; Stahl 2005). A number of different items were exchanged between coastal and high­land regions, including Spondylus and other marine shell, ceramics, fauna! materials, and rock crystal, and people residing in southern highland sites such as Pirincay, Cerro Narrfo, Chaullabamba, and Putushio were actively participating in these trade networks. On a larger scale, cultural contacts between cultures of the south of Ecuador and the north of Peru are also evident, as illustrated by ceramics and other materials (Valdez 2008). 
Obsidian from the northern highlands was among the important resources involved in those long-distance exchanges, with material first show­ing up during late Valdivia times at Real Alto on the southern coast (Marcos et al. 1998) and at San 
Isidro (Zeidler et al. 1994), on the coast to the west of Quito. But obsidian did not become very wide­spread until the late Formative, and even then it was unevenly distributed (Burger et al. 1994). The southern extent of distribution of the northern obsidians during this period is indicated by their appearance at Pirincay in the southern highlands (Bruhns 2003) and at the coastal site of La Emeren­ciana in the province of El Oro (Staller 2000). How­ever, obsidian artifacts occur in small numbers at these sites, and no material from Carboncillo has yet been identified at either one. The lack of Car­boncillo obsidian is interesting given the locations of the sites. La Emerenciana is located close to where the Rio Jubones meets the Pacific Ocean; people at the site could have had relatively easy access to Carboncillo by going up the river system. Pirincay is not too far from Chobshi Cave, and given that people at Chobshi were able to acquire Carboncillo obsidian in the Preceramic period, it would not have required much more effort for peo­ple at Pirincay to do the same. Obsidian from the northern sources may have been easily obtained through exchange in earlier periods, as, according to Burger et al. ( 1994:245-246), distribution of the Mullumica and Yanaurco-Quiscatola obsidian out­side of the northern highlands reached its maximum extent in the succeeding Regional Development period. 
While the long-distance exchange of obsidian and a variety of items reveals ongoing trade net­works in Ecuador, Burger et al. (1994:250) con­clude that during much of prehistory groups in northern Ecuador were not closely linked by inter­regional exchange to those in the southern part of the country. Obsidian from the northern highlands, while present in a number of sites in southern Ecuador during the earlier periods, only appeared in small quantities; its limited distribution in the south may be attributed to sociopolitical and eco­nomic obstacles rather than lack of demand due to technological, ecological, or functional considera­tions (Burger et al. 1994). This division between north and south became exaggerated in the Inte­gration period, when patterns of long-distance exchange of obsidian shifted dramatically. During this period, the distribution of material from the Sierra de Guamani declined dramatically, becom­ing limited to nonexistent outside of the northern highlands and the neighboring coast (Bigazzi et al. 1992; Burger et al. 1994:245-246). 
The data from Saraguro, showing a marked absence of northern obsidian in the Integration period, are totally consistent with this pattern. Of course, this raises the possibility that the use and distribution of Carboncillo obsidian increased in the southern highlands and beyond during this time to compensate for the decreased availability of north­ern material. However, an increase in sociopoliti­cal and economic isolation, as indicated for Saraguro, may have restricted its use to a smaller

area in the southern highlands than in previous eras. More data are needed to clarify these possibilities. 
The patterns of obsidian distribution in late pre­hispanic Ecuador may reflect substantial differ­ences in economic organization in the northern and southern highlands. In the north, there was a thriv­ing system of long-distance exchange, where spe­cialized traders known as mindalaes linked highland, coastal, and eastern lowland peoples through the procurement and distribution of high­value items (Salomon 1986). This system con­nected groups in an east-west direction but did not link with groups in the south, and there is no evi­dence for such a system operating independently in the southern highlands. The economic isolation of the Saraguro region is consistent with this pic­ture and indicates a markedly different form of eco­nomic organization than in the northern highlands. Overall, it appears that during late prehistory soci­eties in the north of Ecuador shared cultural modes of economic organization with people in what is now Colombia, while those in the southern high­lands may have shared forms of economic and sociopolitical organization with groups of the far northern highlands of Peru. 
Conclusions 
Carboncillo represents the first artifact-quality obsidian source to be identified in southern Ecuador and is the first such source known to have been uti­lized in prehispanic times. It is also the first archae­ological obsidian source to be identified in the large gap between the known Peruvian and Ecuadorian sources. 
The obsidian from Carboncillo occurs only in small nodules and is thus suited mainly for expe­dient flake tools rather than large flaked tools. In these terms, Carboncillo is a minor source in the Andes, but its geographic isolation from other sources may have made it a more important resource than similar obsidian deposits in Peru. Carboncillo is located 380 km from the Sierra de Guamanf deposits near Quito and 1,250 km from the northernmost Peruvian source, Puzolana, mak­ing it the only usable source of obsidian for a great distance. Thus, at various times and at different levels, it is likely to have been utilized by people in much of southern Ecuador and probably into the far north of Peru. Material from Carboncillo also could have been procured by people living in the eastern lowlands and on the coast. During the Inca period, it could have been distributed even farther from the source by people who traveled through the area. 
The identification of the Carboncillo source has significant implications for understanding the pro­curement and distribution of obsidian in Ecuador, as it can no longer be assumed that all obsidian found in the country originated in the northern high­lands. Geochemical analysis of artifacts from the Saraguro region shows that the Carboncillo obsid­ian was used frequently in the local context, and the artifacts from Chobshi Cave demonstrate that during at least one period in prehistory, some peo­ple were able to acquire obsidian from both the northern and southern highlands. 
Finally, the use of the local Carboncillo obsid­ian to the exclusion of other sources in Saraguro, in combination with the lack of evidence of other imported items, suggests a significant level of eco­nomic and sociopolitical isolation for the region during the Integration period. This is in direct con­trast to the thriving long-distance exchange system that connected peoples of the northern highlands of Ecuador. The isolation of Saraguro was likely tied to an increasing concern for warfare, which was common in much of the Central Andes in late pre­Inca times. 
On the whole, this study shows that the distrib­ution and procurement of obsidian in Ecuador were more complex than initially thought. Ideally, addi­tional work in southern Ecuador and the far north of Peru will elaborate on the points made here, explore additional questions, and help to further address the gap in archaeological obsidian data.
