The .rst systematic research on the funerary record at the Río Bote 1 (RB1) rockshelter, located next to the Bote River, a tributary of the Santa Cruz River in southern Patagonia, has revealed at least three human burial events dating to the very early Late Holocene and one dating to the middle Late Holocene. The RB1 site appears to have been used for both subsistence and inhumation activities. All of the burials uncovered postdate the deposition of a prominent volcanic ash layer. Technological information indicates that RB1 was used by groups that were also using spaces to the west and south. Mortuary evidence indicates connections with groups living in areas extending from the Última Esperanza region to the Pali Aike volcanic .eld, at least at the beginning of the Late Holocene. The selection of the same place for multiple burials may explain why so few human burials are known in southern Patagonia from the beginning of the Late Holocene and earlier periods, as it is possible that sites like RB1 are yet to be discovered. 
El abrigo rocoso de Río Bote 1 (RB1) está localizado en la margen derecha del río Bote, un a.uente del río Santa Cruz. Las primeras investigaciones sistemáticas sobre el registro arqueológico en este lugar han mostrado la presencia de al menos tres episodios de entierros humanos correspondientes a la parte inicial del Holoceno tardío y uno correspondiente a la parte media de este período. El sitio parece haber sido utilizado tanto para actividades de subsistencia como funerarias. Todos los entierros son posteriores a la depositación de un nivel de ceniza volcánica en el sitio. La información tecnológica indica que RB1 fue utilizado por grupos que también emplearon los espacios ubicados al oeste y al sur. La evidencia mortuoria señala conexiones con grupos que vivían en áreas localizadas hacia el sur, desde la región de Última Esperanza hasta el campo volcánico de Pali Aike, al menos al inicio del Holoceno tardío. La selección del mismo lugar para estos entierros múltiples podría explicar por qué se conocen tan pocos entierros humanos en Patagonia meridional correspondientes a principios del Holoceno tardío y períodos anteriores, ya que se considera posible que resten por descubrir más sitios semejantes a Río Bote 1.

espite more than 10 years of systematic archaeological research in the upper Santa Cruz River basin (USCRB), its archaeological mortuary record has remained relatively unknown untilvery recently.Knowl­edge was limited to two cave burials, the .rst being an adult burial in the Walichu Cave on thesouthernshoreofLakeArgentino, reported in the late nineteenth century (Moreno 2007 [1877]), and the second, a burial in a volcanic lava tube cave in the middle Santa Cruz basin, northoftheriver, datedto circa2500BP (Franco et al. 2010). In addition to these, an open-air burial covered by rocks and attributed to the time of Spanish contact was discovered on a hill in the middle Santa Cruz area in 1930, about 10 km from the river (Vignati 1934). This situation contrastswith other areasof continental central and southern Patagonia, where more informationonburialpracticesisavailable. The earliest human remains found in this broader region were discoveredatBaño NuevoCavein Chile, 600 km north of the USCRB and dated to circa 9000 BP(Figure1;Mena and Reyes 2001). In addition, 160–250 km to the south, burialsinexcavatedpitsin rocksheltersandcaves have provided ages from circa 3900 to 3500 BP (Bird 1988;Hedges et al.1992;L’Heureux and Amorosi 2010;L’Heureux and Barberena2008; Massone 1996;Prieto 1991,1993–94; Prieto and Schidlowsky 1992), while about 330 km north of the USCRB, Late Holocene human burials (retrieved from stone structures, locally called chenques, and natural niches) date between circa 2600 and 350 BP (García Guraieb et al. 2015; Goñi et al. 2000–2002). In the last few years, our knowledge of humanburial practices in the USCRB has increased signi.cantly due to the discoveryoftwonewburial sites:theRíoBote 1(RB1)rockshelter, and theveryLateHolocene chenque at Huyliche1(Figure1;Franco et al. 2010). 
In this paper we present the .rst systematic research on thefuneraryrecordofRB1,a rock­shelterlocated next to theBoteRiver,a southern tributary ofthe Santa Cruz River (Figure1), whereatleastthree distinct early Late Holocene humanburialevents andamiddleLateHolocene event have been discovered. Bioarchaeolog­ical, geomorphological, and paleoenvironmental informationisprovided, along with radiocarbon ages (BP). The .ndings at RB1 are discussed .rst asevidenceof the changesin thefunction and reuseofthisarchaeological site asafunerary place through time. Then thesiteis discussedin relationtotheavailablearchaeological informa­tionfromthisregioninsouthernPatagonia and the contemporaneous mortuary record ofneigh­boringareas.Finally,theevidence from RB1is used to address one of the current debates on Patagonian mortuary archaeology, namely, the reasonsfora paucityofevidenceof humanburi­alsduringtheEarlyand MiddleHolocene (Barri­entos 2002;Dillehay2000;Guichónetal.2001). 
TheUpper SantaCruzRiverBasin 
Environment and Paleoenvironment 
The SantaCruzRiverisa perennial stream with a catchment area in theAndes cordillera.Inthe USCRB,waterfromsnowand meltingglacialice .rst collects in Lake Argentino before .owing east into the Santa Cruz River. In the upper basinthe SantaCruzRiverhasseveraltributaries, including theimportant Bote River(Figure2). Human movement west of Lake Argentino both now and in the past has been limited by the extensive SouthernPatagoniaIce Field,butthe Paci.c coast can be reached via passes through theBaguales Range (upto about 1,800masl), located southofthe lake. 
The present climate is cold semiarid, with precipitation mostly produced by disturbances embedded in the .ow of the southern westerly winds (SWW) across the Andes. Precipitation is greatestonthe windwardslopesoftheAndes and decreases west-to-east on the eastern, lee side (Garreaud et al. 2009). This gradient is visible in the vegetation, which shifts from Nothofagus forestsinthe west to steppe in the east.Variations in the position and intensity of the SWW have brought varying conditions of humidity and aridity to the area, with stronger winds generally bringing more precipitation to thewesterlyslopesof theAndesbutlesstothe eastern slopes and steppe (Garreaud et al. 2009; Moy et al. 2009).

Tonello and coauthors (2009)haveshown that thelongest, more or less continuous, period of increased moisture in the Andes during the Holocenewasfromcirca4800to2900BP. Pollen records from extra-Andean Patagonia indicate lower moisture availability in the steppe at this time, particularly at circa 3750 BP, when car­bonate deposits at Laguna Cháltel, about 80 km northeast of RB1, record desiccation of the lake basin (Ohlendorf et al. 2014). Pollen from Chorrillo Malo 2, a rockshelter west of Lake Argentino (Figure2), records agrass­shrubsteppe with intermediatelevelsofmoisture betweencirca5800and3000BP(Mancini 2002). 
From circa 3050 to 2250 BP, precipitation declined steadily in the Andes and increased in the steppe before these precipitation trends abruptlyreversed around1900BP.Theperiodof higher precipitationinthe Andes andlowerpre­cipitationinthe steppewasshort-lived,however, and soon after1900BP therewasanoverallbut

Archaeology of the Upper Santa Cruz River Basin 
Previous archaeological researchin theUSCRB has focused on human peopling ofthe area and theroleoftheriverasa frontier between human groups (Belardi et al. 1992). Most research has taken place in the lowlands surrounding Lake Argentino(Figure2) and has provided evidence of human presence as early as circa 9700BPattheChorrillo Malo2 archaeological site (Franco and Borrero 2003). Occupation was discontinuous until circa 3800 BP, when both highlands (1,100 m asl) and lowlands (250 m asl) were used (Franco 2004, 2008; Franco and Borrero 2003;Francoetal.2011).Rawmaterial and technological informationsuggestthat these areas were integrated within the home range of asingle culturalgroup(sensu Bar-Yosef 2004) between circa 3800 and 1800 BP (Franco 2004; Franco et al. 2011). 
TheRío Bote1(RB1)Archaeological Site 
RB1isarockshelterinacliff onthe eastsideof thelower Bote River, which has its headwaters in theBaguales Range. It is subject to seasonal .ooding in spring due to snowmelt at higher elevations(Figure2). Before it joinsthe Santa Cruz River, the Bote River meanders along a .at-.oored, narrow valley with several cutoff meanders(Figure3).Bedloadvariesupto1min diameter,attestingtothe magnitudeof seasonal .ooding.

exposed a stratigraphic section with clear evi­denceof humanburials.Themorphologyofthe RB1 sediments and the presence of submerged sandstone blocks several meters in diameter in theriver adjacenttothesite arestrong indications thattheroofandwallsofthepresent rockshelter, and the sediments it contains, used to extend further west toward the river. This evidence, and the discovery of two incomplete skeletons projectingfromthe sedimentface, suggestedthat the remaining sediments and the archaeological material theycontained were in imminent danger of being eroded by seasonal .oods. Because of this, archaeological research focused on the recovery of the human skeletons and associated culturalmaterials,while the paleoenvironmental researchexamined thehistoryof thesite and the area nearby. 
Atotal of 10 skeletons were recoveredfrom thesite,eightof which (IndividualsA,C,E,F,G, H,I, andJ)were distributedinthree culturalpits, one nested into the other, dated between 3800 and 3600BP.They weremostly primaryburials in anatomical positions,except forIndividualE, whose bones seem to have been displaced when a fourth pit for Individual B, dated circa 2200 BP, was dug on top of the three previous pits. Although some isolated bones were identi.ed as IndividualDduringthe .eldwork, duringlab work they were matched to either Individuals E or B. Lastly, on top of the sediment strata, but2.5mtothe northof this columnofburials, an isolated human mandible was identi.ed as IndividualK.A more detailed descriptionofthe .eld and lab methods employed in the recovery andthe.rstosteological analysisof theseburials is presented below. 
Methodology 
Excavation followed sediment and cultural boundaries in the deposit but was dif.cult and slow because the fragile nature of the sediment sequence dictatedthatworkhadtobe conducted froma3 m high scaffoldbuilt out into theriver (Figure4).

paleoenvironmental historyfor thearea. Chrono­logical information for the paleoenvironmen­tal record was obtained by accelerator mass spectrometry(AMS) radiocarbon (organics) and optically stimulated luminescence/infrared stim­ulated luminescence (OSL/IRSL) (quartz and feldspar sand) datingof sedimentsinthe .ood­plain and buried or abandoned river channels near the site. Techniques used in pollen and OSL/IRSL analysis are outlined in Faegri and Iversen (1989) and Tripaldi and colleagues (2011), respectively. 
Because most human burials were found as primaryinhumations with their bonesin anatom­ical position, each skeleton and each bone was mapped in three dimensions, allowing exact orientations to be determined. In thefew cases when unarticulated bones were found in a pit, this procedure aided in the identi.cation of their provenience during laboratory work (for example, bones mapped as individualDthat then turn outto belongto eitherB orE). 
All human bones were examined in the laboratory to determine the condition of the skeletons, the minimum number of individuals, and theirprobablesex and age at death. Thefew isolated bones recoveredwerematchedto partic­ular skeletons on the basis of the absence of that elementintheskeletonand spatialproximitytoa particularskeleton mapped duringexcavation,as well as bone morphology, age, and taphonomy. Sexand age determinations for adults were based on the classic methods compiled by Buikstra and Ubelaker(1994);theuseof oneor moreof these protocols depended on the completeness and preservation of the bone structures. Age estimates for subadults were based on the sequenceof toothdevelopmentand eruption,the appearance and fusion of secondary centers of ossi.cation, and long bone length(in perinatal and infantile remains), following data compiled by Scheuer and Black(2000). No attempt was made to determine the sex of subadults. 
Achronologyfortheburialswasdevelopedby direct AMS radiocarbon dating ofhuman bone, supplemented by ages for charcoal, guanaco (Lama guanicoe), and choique (Pterocnemia pennata)bones also foundin the culturallayers.

Results 
Geomorphology and Paleoenvironment 
The RB1 sediments consist ofbasal .uvial silts depositedprior to 5768 ± 41BP(Table1), over­lain by coarser, more variable deposits trans­ported to the site by wind action, slope wash, and breakdown of the cross-bedded sandstone, and Ostrea layers that form the roof, walls, and .ooroftherockshelter(Figure5).This shiftfrom .uvial to other sediments implies a transition from moist to drier conditions at the site at this time. OSL and radiocarbon ages for .uvial sediments near RB1 demonstrate greater river .ow from circa 5800 BP (age for basal .uvial sediments at RB1) to circa 5000 BP (feldspar IRSL age of 5.31 ± 1.01 ka BP for coarse sedi­ments approximately28mwestofRB1at65cm depth;UGAOSLAr11-1),whentheriver channel waswestofits present position.

d13C
530 ± 25 BP (UGAMS03069; = -26.04‰). The channels are buried by more than 2 m of vertical accretion .oodplain sed­iments, suggesting slightly reduced stream.ow after around 500 BP but with occasional .ash .oods, oneof whichproduceda cutoff meander north of RB1 that is .lled with organic-rich sed­iments dating to 420 ±25 BP (UGAMS 03070; 
d13C 
=-26.81‰). Theseincreased discharges focused the channel on the RB1 cliff site at circa 1.89 ± 0.23 ka BP (feldspar IRSL age UGAOSLAr11-2 from75 cm depth), undercut­ting the sandstone wall between the river and thesedimentsinthe rockshelter. This protective walleventually collapsed into theriver,leading to the erosion of the exposed shelter sediments. Pollen from RB1 con.rms the .uvial evidence, recording a transition from grass-shrub steppe when the .uvial silts were deposited under wetter conditions (beforecirca 5800BP)todrier shrub steppethat predominatedfromcirca5800to4000 BP, when moisture conditions were probably similartotoday. 
Cultural Sequence 
The earliest evidence of humans at RB1 is a small hearth,with associated lithics andfaunal remains, in the upper part of the basal .uvial silts, dating to circa 5800 BP. The shelter was later used repeatedly, as indicated by a series of hearths and associated guanaco bones (with cut and percussion marks) and lithic artifacts, which arepresent at thesite until the depositionof an Aguilera volcanic ash layer (ash identi.ed by Charles Stern, personal communication 2008). Ages from the north-northeast part of the sed­iment sequence (tothe left in Figure5), where evidenceof human activityisabundant,suggests thatthevolcanicashwasdepositedoveracultural layer containing charcoal dating to 4030 ±25 BP (UGAMS 11064; d13C=-22.9‰). An age of 3900 ± 25 BP (UGAMS 7534; d13C = -23.6‰)for charcoal found inside a bone tool in loose sediment within the ash also helps to datethe ashfall.In thesouth-southwest(SSW) part of the sediment sequence (to the right in Figure5), wherethereislessevidenceof human disturbance,a guanaco bone from above thevol­canicashprovidedanageof circa3860 ±25 BP (UGAMS 21776; d13C =-19.8‰). Together, thesethreeages suggestthattheAguileravolcano erupted and deposited ash at RB1 sometime between about 4030 and 3860 BP. 
Alapa shell(Nacella magellanica)ofmarine origin, from deposits dating between 4800 and 4100 BP, suggests contact with the coast. There was a change in artifact technology by 4100 BP (FrancoandVetrisano 2014),whentheextraction of elongated .akeswasreplacedbytheLevallois method of obtaining .akes (Boëda 1993). The Levallois method continued to be used until around 3600 BP, when there is a gap in the RB1 sediment sequence (see Table1). Thereis evidence, however, that the Levallois method was used at other sites in the area during this interval (Franco and Vetrisano 2014; Franco et al. 2017). 
Pitsexcavatedintothe rockshelter .oor above theAguilera ash contained multiple humanburi­als, with individuals dated between circa 3800 and 3620 BP(Table1). Theseburialpits cut previous cultural deposits dated between 4200 and 3900 BP, as shown by the ages for char­coal and guanaco bones(Table1;Figure5). The burial pits are covered by .at rocks and there are cultural deposits above them.Charcoal and choique and guanaco bones from these cultural deposits date them between circa 3760 and 3680 BP (Franco et al. 2010). The dates are in the same chronological range as the burials, suggesting that these activities were probably penecontemporaneous with one or more of the younger burial events.

The deepest dug pit(Pit1) contained three individuals(H,I, andJ) andwas partly covered withlargeblocksof sedimentaryrock 25–30cm thick. Female adultJ(Table2)lay on her left side over a thin ash deposit and was partially exposed due to river erosion of the lower part of the sediment pro.le. The skull, some ribs, vertebrae, and bones of the upper left limb were recoveredinsitu;the right humeruswasfound on theground next to theriver.Therewerealsosome vegetal remains under this individual.Under the skullwasalarge, thick, endscraper madeof local dacite,with redpigment on itsventralside;itwas larger than other endscraperswerecoveredfrom thearea(Francoetal. 2010). 
Lying on the same deposit, and clearly asso­ciated withJ, were theremainsof perinatal Indi­vidualI(Table2; Figure6). Some bones were projecting from the pro.le and were recovered duringthe .rst rescue .eldwork(May,2008);the restoftheskeletonwasexcavatedthe following season (February–March, 2009). Bones of the upper and lower limbs, ilia, and ribs were recov­ered. IndividualH,ayoung male adult(Table2), wasinthesamepit,atthesamedepth,and closeto IndividualsJ andI. Theskullwas upside-down and the mandible was close to the pelvis. The rest of the skeleton was in anatomical position, oriented southeast-to-northwest, and lyingon its back,withlegs.exedoverthe thorax(Figure6). Theleftsideofthe thorax, left humerus, and feet were lyingonathinash layer.An accumulation of rocks (large cobbles, some of sandstone) covered the lower limbs and parts of the trunk. Thethreeskeletonshad ochreontheirsurfaces, mainly goethite, according to X-raydiffraction studies,whichwouldhave been placed directly on the corpses or on something covering them (such as an animal-hide cape), as indicated by the very small amount (less than 5%) of pigment found in the sediments surrounding the skeleton (Franco et al. 2012). There were also grassremains beneathIndividualH.

Therewas ochreonthe skull; some pigmentwas also found on the thorax and lower and upper limbs (Guarido 2014). Artifacts were found in association with this individual, including a bone instrument anda lithic sidescraper,found beneatha foot(Figure7). IndividualF wasvery closetoGandwasalsooriented north-to-south and on its left side,facing theground. Therewas ochreonthe bones (Guarido 2014)and charcoal nearby.Radiocarbon agesforIndividualsGandJ (Table2)are statisticallythesame, although their stratigraphic positionsuggests thatGwasburied afterIndividual J. Nevertheless, both appear to have died and been buried within a relatively short period. Pit2, containing IndividualsGand F,wasdugintoPit1and reachedtheburialdepth of IndividualH, causingthe displacementof the mandible and skull described earlier. The rest of this individualwasin anatomical position. 
Thelastpitdug duringthis time period(Pit3; Table2)was closertothebackwalloftherock­shelter and included IndividualsA,C,andE(note that bones originally labeled as Individual D were isolated subadultspecimens that were later assigned to IndividualsE orBduringlaboratory work). Lithic artifacts and animal bones were recovered near theskeletonsbut withoutaclear associationtothem.IndividualAisa male adult (Table2) placed at the base of the pit. The skeleton was articulated and oriented northeast-to-southwest, with the skull facing east toward the back of the rockshelter; it lay on its ventral side with thelegs tightly .exedunder thethorax (Figure6).

A partially complete subadult skeleton and an isolated adult mandible are evidence that two other individualswereburiedat RB1. Subadult IndividualBwasburiedin Pit4at theveryrearof therockshelterinsediment layersoverlying the previous burials. This burial was also covered with rocks and there was ochre on the bones; it had been disturbed by rodent burrowing and part of a rodent mandible was found inside the skull. The skeleton dated to circa 2100 BP, makingitthe youngestfoundatthesite(Table2; Figure5).The adultmandible(IndividualK)was found approximately 2.5 m north of Pits 1–3 in disturbed sediments at the top of the sediment sequence, close to large rocks that could be part of another burial pit. The sediments are substantially eroded, however, and the mandible is possiblytheonlyhuman remainleftinthispart of thesequence(Figure5). 
Discussion 
Changes in the Utilization of Río Bote 1 through Time 
There is scant evidence of human presence at RB1 or in the USCRB before about 5768 BP. At RB1, hearths are more abundant after about 4800 BP, following the period of very dry conditions that led to the desiccation of Laguna Cháltel. Associated with these hearths are abundant lithic artifacts and guanaco bones with cultural marks, suggesting that the site wasusedrepeatedlyfor subsistence activities,a conclusion supported by our preliminary lithic and zooarchaeological analyses. In terms of morphology, technological characteristics, and raw materials, the lithic artifacts at RB1 are similartoartifactsofthe same time periodfrom Chorrillo Malo2,amultiple activity site located about95km westofRB1 neartheforest-steppe ecotone (Franco and Vetrisano 2014). Faunal assemblages are mostly composed of guanaco bones, with evidence of processing and con­sumption activities(MaríaVictoriaFiel, personal communication 2016). 
Between circa 4030 and 3860 BP, a major eruption of the Aguilera volcano in Chile deposited a layer of ash at RB1. After this, RB1 was used as a burial site, .rst between approximately 3800 and 3620 BP,and then again around 2100 BP. During the earlier period, at least three pits (Pits 1–3) were excavated at the same locationinthe.ooroftherockshelter,with the younger pits penetratingthe upper partofthe older pit below. Each pit contained more than one individual, and both adults and subadults were identi.ed. At least eight individuals were buriedin thesethreepits,anexceptionallylarge number consideringthat thesewereina narrow columnofsedimentat therearof therockshelter.

Although many cultural materials (lithic and bone remains, including some tools) were found within the sediments .lling the pits, only those in direct associationwith the human remains can be con.dently considered gravegoods.Common featuresof theburials arethe presenceof ochre on most of the bones and the absence of this pigment in the surrounding sediments(Franco et al. 2012). This, and the .exed position of most of the skeletons, suggests that individuals, particularly adults, may have been contained in some kind of painted organic wrapping such as a painted animalhide. 
Above the rocks that covered the pits there were also lithic artifacts and animal bone frag­ments, mostly penecontemporaneous with the underlyingburials (i.e., 3800–3600 BP). These could have been placed there when the pits were dug as funerary rites or, alternatively, they could have been left from activities that took place immediatelyafter theburials.The lackof evidenceof human occupationfor more than one thousand years after the .rst group of burials (between circa 3600 and 2100 BP), as well as the strict contemporaneity of the dates, tends to supportthe idea that these culturalremains were related tofunerary rites or to the excavation of thepits. 
Evidence of human activity at the shelter is scarce after the 2100 BP burial, and the only date obtained sofar comes froma hearth dated to around 350 BP, with scant associated lithic or faunal remains. 
Río Bote 1 in the Upper Santa Cruz River Basin Archaeological Context 
Comparison of the sequence of events at RB1 witheventsat other sitesinthe region (Borrero et al. 1998–99; Franco 2004;Franco et al.1999) revealsdifferences in site function and chronol­ogy(Table1). Between circa 5800 and 4300BP, theonlysitesinthe USCRBwithsignsof human use are rockshelters, namely RB1 and Chorrillo Malo2(Table1;Figure2).Aspreviously noted, thereare broad similaritiesin lithic technology at thetwo sites(Franco andVetrisano 2014), with theLevallois method(sensu Boëda 1993) appearing at both sites between circa 4300 and 3800BP.The bone technologyis datedat around 3900 BP at RB1. This site shows an increased archaeological signal after about 4800 BP; it continued to be used until around 4030–3900 BP, after the eruption of the Aguilera volcano. Subsequently, remains of human activity are scarce and relate to the 3800–3600 BP burial activitiesatRB1.Chorrillo Malo2,arockshelter in the lowlands to the west, where the climate wasslightly wetterthanintheRB1 area,shows increased activity around 3800 BP, coinciding with the RB1burials. TheCerroVerlika1rock­shelter, locatedat approximately 1,100masl,in theBaguales Range(Table1),wasalsousedby humans around 3800–3600 BP. 
Thestronger signalof occupationatChorrillo Malo2 after 3800BPisevidenced not onlyby an increase in the number of artifacts but also in thetype of items recovered, such as grinding stones, some with ochre, abundant pigments, and raw materials such as gray-green banded obsidian, probably coming from the highlands (Franco 2004; Stern and Franco 2000). This evidence has been used to suggest that this period marked the beginning of the effective occupation of the USCRB (Franco 2004). The multiple burials at RB1 (including adults and subadults) reinforce this interpretation. Scholars note the technological and raw material simi­larities among these three locations (including CerroVerlika1)toargue fortheirutilizationby thesame culturalgroup(sensu Bar-Yosef 2004; Franco 2004, 2011;Franco et al.2011). 
The hiatus in use of RB1 after the multi­ple burials from 3800 to 3600 BP, until the single burial at around 2100 BP, contrasts with the regional evidence of site use. Dur­ing this time, new open-air and rockshelter sites (Campo del Lago 1, Alero del Bosque, Punta Bonita 2) begin to appear in differ­ent environments (forest and steppe) west of RB1(Figure2; Table1). Paleoenvironmental data suggest increased precipitation between about 3100 and 2800 BP in areas west of Lake Argentino, wheremostofthesesitesare located, contrasting with extremely dry conditions in the steppe to the east, where RB1 is located. RB1 may even have been abandoned during this arid period, which is recorded at Laguna Cháltel. 
RB1 was not used between around 2100 and 350BP duringwhat mayhave beenarelatively

dry phaseof climateinthe area that lasted until around 600 BP (Franco et al. 2017). In contrast, to the west, humans occupied open-air sites (Laguna Nimez, Alice 1, Charles Fuhr 2) and rockshelters (Chorrillo Malo 2 and Cerro Ver­lika1)until around 1000 BP,probably because unlike the steppe, areas closer to the Andes experienced higher precipitation at this time. Between circa1000and500BP,areas closetothe Andes were abandoned, probably becauseofarid conditions duringthe MCA(Borrero and Franco 2000), whichlastedfromcalAD130to1600.In boththe easternand western partsoftheUSCRB, archaeologicalevidenceis scarce aftertheMCA, being limited to RB1, Rincón Amigo, Alice 2, and Huyliche 1, where a new kind of human burial is recorded south of Lake Argentino, namelythe chenque (Figures1 and2). 
In summary,theavailableevidenceshowsthat therewerethree rocksheltersitesinthe USCRB that were used duringthe early and middleLate Holocene—Río Bote 1 on the steppe plateau, Chorrillo Malo2 near theforest-steppe ecotone, and CerroVerlika1inthehighlands.Atthistime theclimatewas wetteratChorrillo Malo2 and more arid at RB1 to the east in the steppe. In contrast to the western sites, which were used inavarietyofwaysthatdidnot includeburials, RB1wasrepeatedlyusedonlyforburial purposes during this time. It seems that RB1 was chosen speci.cally as a site to bury the dead between circa 3800 and 3600 BP and afterwards at around 2100 BP. 
The Integration of Burial Information from RB1 and Spaces to the South 
There are no human burials elsewhere in the USCRB comparabletothoseat RB1.Neverthe­less,asimilarfuneraryrecordisfound at sitesto the south and southeast of our study area. In the PaliAikevolcanic .eld,260kmsoutheastofRB1 (Figure1), .veindividuals(two adults and three subadults) wereburiedtogether in asinglepit in therearof theOrejasdeBurro 1(OB1) rock-shelter(L’Heureux and Barberena 2008). The bodies layinasemi-.exed position, were cov­ered with ochre, and had been placed onalayer ofgrass; afterburialtheywerecoveredwith rocks fromthe shelter.Theburialwas datedto around 3500 BP (L’Heureux and Barberena 2008). The sediments .lling the pit also contained isolated bones of at least one other individual from a previous burial (L’Heureux and Barberena 2008). Earlier research in the 1970s found two individuals in a different pit in the central part of the rockshelter (Guerra de Fretes 1977 in L’Heureux and Barberena 2008). Unfortunately, these skeletons have been lost (L’Heureux and Barberena 2008). Hearths and abundant archae­ological material were also recovered from the sediment .llingthe OB1burialpit and fromthe sediments cut by it, indicating that the shelter was not usedexclusivelyfor funerary purposes (L’Heureux and Barberena 2008). There was no evidence of subsistence activities during or immediately after the burials, however, as this typeof useofthe siteis datedat around 1700BP (Charlin 2009). 
A similar multiple burial was excavated by Bird in 1936 at Cerro SotaCave(CS), about 38 km west of OB1, in the Chilean part of thePaliAikevolcanic .eld(Figure1). Three female adults and four subadults wereburied at the rear of the cave; they were placed on grass and covered with local volcanic rocks and ochre (Bird 1988). Posterior analyses by L’Heureux and Amorosi(2010)identi.ed atotalof nine individuals, six fromtheburialat the backofthe cave and another three represented by isolated bonesfromthe anterior chamberofthecave.The burial at the back of the cave has usually been describedasacremation, although recent analy­ses found only partially or super.cially burnt bones (L’Heureux and Amorosi 2010). Three dates fortheburial range from around 3600 BP (Individual CS1; L’Heureux and Amorosi 2010) to around3400BP(IndividualCS2;Hedgesetal. 1992). 
Apitburialof threesubadults and one adult wasdiscoveredinCueva Lago Sofía1(CLS1), 145km southof RB1in theÚltimaEsperanza region of Chile. According to Prieto (1991), bodieswereplacedinthepitwrappedin guanaco hides with ochre. The pit was then .lled with grass and Nothofagus pumilio barkthat served as fuel forthe cremationofthe bodies.Twopainted shells and a sidescraper covered with pigment were also recoveredfromthe pit. Theburial has been dated to around 3900 BP.The cave shows evidenceofprevioususe, includingthepresence

of extinct megafauna; ages for the bones of extinct andextant mammals,aswellascharcoal, indicate use between circa 11,500–10,100 BP (Jackson and Prieto 2005; Massone and Prieto 2004;Prieto 1991). Thereisnoinformation on theuseof thecaveafter theburials. 
In summary,therewerepitburialsofmultiple individuals inside caves or rockshelters in the period 3900–3400 BP at severallocations south of RB1, up to 250 km. In all cases, there was the simultaneous inhumation of more than one individual,including both adults and subadults, inaburialpit coveredwith rocks,withabundant use of ochre. At most sites (RB1, OB1, and CLS1), the bodies were lying on their sides in a .exed position. At least two sites (CS and CLS1) show signs of burning as part of the funerary practice. There is also evidence that the pits were prepared in some way before the bodies were placed in them (for example, grass was placed either around the pit or around the bodies). Noneoftheburialshadabundantgrave goods, but at RB1 and CLS1 there were either lithicartifacts,bonetools,or shellsthatmayhave been deliberatelyplacednextto someofthebod­ies. These many shared characteristics suggest commonorsimilarfunerarypractices among the hunter-gatherers of southern Patagonia during the early Late Holocene, as well as connections between eastern and westerngroups southofthe SantaCruzRiver,which were probably partof thesamesocial unit(sensu Bar-Yosef 2004). 
At leastthree sites(RB1,OB1,andCS)have providedevidenceofthereuseofthe same rock­shelterfor more thanapitburial.Although these othereventshavenotbeen datedatOB1andCS, at RB1 thereisevidenceof useatthe same time or shortly after burials as well as evidence of much later use for another burial (the subadult burial dated around 2100 BP). All three sites appeartohavehad other (probably domestic)use thanthemortuary ones,butnotatthesametime theburials took place (Charlin 2009;L’Heureux and Barberena 2008;Prieto 1991).In the caseof RB1,faunal and lithic remains datetothe time of theburials, and so couldhave been relatedto thefuneral activitiesthemselves or to the period immediatelyfollowing them. 
Sofar, no similarmultipleburialshave been found northofRB1,reinforcingtheideathatdur­ingthe early Late Holocene therewasastronger connectionwith groups southofthe SantaCruz Riverthan with northern populations.Thisisalso supportedby lithic information (Franco et al. 2011). This situation changed during the last millennium when chenques became the most commonburialtype acrossPatagonia(Goñietal. 2000–2002). 
Río Bote 1 and the Debate about the Paucity of Human Remains during the Early and Middle Holocene in Southern Patagonia 
Various hypotheses have been proposed to explain the paucity of Early and Middle Holocene funerary evidence for southern Pata­gonia. Someresearchershave pointedto preser­vation issues and sampling biases as the main cause for the sparse record (Guichón et al. 2001). Others have proposed that the proba­ble .exibility of mortuary behaviors, includ­ing cremation and the abandonment of bodies, particularly in the early stages of the human peopling of the region, would also have con­tributedtothe paucityof humanburials, particu­larly duringtheLate Pleistocene–Early Holocene transition(Barrientos 2002;Dillehay 2000). In all cases, the small number and high mobility of human groups during this period has been underscored. 
The mortuary record atRB1, and similarities toburialsfurther south duringthe early partofthe Late Holocene, shed some light on the debate. In southernPatagonia, humanburials appear to be concentrated in circumscribed points in space. Not only are there several human burials in a single rockshelter, but most of the burials are at theverysame location(orvery closeto it) as previous burials within the shelters. RB1 is an extreme case of this situation, with eight individualsbeingburiedin threepitsdug oneinto theother.Theseburial characteristics minimize thespatialimpactof the humanburialsthathave been found, particularly in an area as large as southern Patagonia. The very low population densitiesinsouthernPatagonia duringmostofits prehispanic occupationhistory (and particularly during the Early and Middle Holocene) mean that the chances of .nding multipleburial sites iseven less likely. This suggestionisreinforced by thefact that the earliestburialsinthe region,

such as thoseatBaño NuevointheCoyhaique region (around9000BP;MenaandReyes 2001) and Piuquenes rockshelter (around 9100 BP), located farther to the north, in Chile (Stehberg et al. 2005), were multipleburialsincaves and rockshelters. 
Conclusions 
Throughout its occupational history, RB1 had two markedly different functions: .rst for sub­sistence activities, and then as a funerary site withseveral episodesof inhumation. Subsistence activities date from around 5800 to 3900 BP. Afterthe Aguilera volcanic eruption(between about 4030and 3860BP), whichleftadistinctive layerof ashonthe .oorof RB1,the shelterwas used repeatedly as a burial site, .rst between 3800 and 3600 BP and later at around 2100 BP, witha .nal isolated occupationfor subsistence activitiesataround350BP.Hiatusesinthe useof RB1,from about3600to2100BP,andfrom2100 to 350 BP, occurred during times when paleo­environmental information points to extreme aridityinthearea. AlthoughRB1 appearstohave been abandoned from about 2100 to 350 BP, at a timeof aridclimateinthe steppein the east, both open-air and rockshelter sites in the west continued to be used for subsistence activities, probably because of the wetter conditions, at least until MCA times,when westernareas were hitbyamajor periodofdrought leading humans to abandon the area. 
Previous work on technological similarities in the area has shown that RB1 was in the home range of cultural groups using spaces to the west and south, including the area west of Lake Argentino and probably the Baguales Range, between about 4300 and 3600BP.These similaritiesextend asfarsouthasCerro Castillo, south of the Baguales Range (Langlais and Morello 2009). Based on the new mortuary evidence from RB1, it is reasonable to argue that there were social connections with groups even further south, in the Última Esperanza region and Pali Aike volcanic .eld, as shown by strong similarities between the early Late Holocene humanburialsatthe sitesintheseareas (Bird 1988;Franco et al. 2011;L’Heureux and Barberena 2008;Massone1996;Prieto 1991).It isworth notingthat to date, not oneburial site of comparable chronology has been located to the north, between theDeseado and SantaCruz rivers. 
Evidence presented here indicates that the selectionof the same place formultipleburials may contributetoexplainingwhy sofew human burial sitesareknownin southernPatagoniaprior to the early Late Holocene, as it is possiblethat sites like RB1 remain to be discovered.
