MY STATE OR YOURS? WARI "LABOR CAMPS" AND 
THE INKA CULT OF VIRACOCHA AT RAQCHI, CUZCO, PERU 

Bill Sillar, Emily Dean, and Amelia Perez Trujillo 
The archaeological site at Raqchi is best known for the large Inka building identified by colonial sources as the "temple of Viracocha." The site also has an enclosure with 152 circular buildings that have previously been interpreted as Inka state storage: collcas. Although Inka pottery was found within some structures, the utilitarian pottery, carbonized plant remains, and hearths found on the floors of the buildings at Raqchi date their construction to the Middle Horizon. These results have caused a significant reinterpretation of the site and highlight a distinction between the political economies of the two largest Andean states. We suggest this sector of the site functioned as a Wari compound for seasonal work groups, similar to those at Pikillacta and Azdngaro, suggesting a potential coercive aspect within Wari colonization. This prompts a reevaluation of the Viracocha cult during the Jnka period, its reclaiming of Tiwanaku and Wari state sites, and the role of public cere­mony within lnka state policy. 
El sitio arqueol6gico de Raqchi es famoso por el gran edificio inka llamado el "Templo de Viracocha." Este sitio presenta tambien un sector con 152 estructuras circulares, dispuestas de manera ordenada y planificada, que son conocidas e inter­pretadas como almacenes o collcas de! estado inka . Durante nuestras excavaciones arqueol6gicas en este sector registramos fragmentos de cerdmica de ti po utilitario (sin decoraci6n), restos de plantas mezcladas y fogones, permitiendo fechar a estas construcciones en el Horizonte Medio . Estos resultados han provocado que se efectue una re-interpretaci6n del sitio y una aclaraci6n de las diferencias entre las polfticas econ6micas de los dos mayores estados andinos. Sugerimos entonces que este sector funcion6 como un complejo wari conformado por grupos de trabajo temporal, similares a los de Pikillaqta y Azdngaro, resaltando un aspecto coercitivo de la colonizaci6n wari. Esto lleva a una re-evaluaci6n del culto a Viracocha durante el peri­odo inka, y del papel de! ceremonial publico en la poUtica de! estado inka. 
oth the Wari and the Inka set out to cap­Bture the power of significant places and material remains from previous periods, but differences in the focus of Wari and Inka strategies at Raqchi illustrate significant differ­ences in the mechanisms of inclusion, exclusion, and control used by the two largest precolumbian Andean states. Raqchi, which the Inka called Cacha, is situated at the base of a small extinct volcano, Kinsich'ata, on the banks of the Vilcanota River, 3 ,480 m asl, 110 km south of Cuzco (14° 10' 488" Latitude, 71° 22' 198" Longitude) (Figure 1). Today the Inka com­plex at Raqchi includes a 12 m high wall, using fine, close-fitting, polygonal stonework at its base topped by large rectangular adobe bricks (Supplemental Figure 1). This wall formed the central partition and roof support for a 92 m long rectangular building, which Garcilaso de la Vega (1989:290 [1612: Ch. XXII]) referred to as the "temple" ofViracocha. The Inka complex includes a small, artificially enclosed lake; a raised platform; and a line of highly regular planned buildings arranged around courtyards (Fig­ure 2) (Gasparini and Margolies 1980:234-55;Niles 1999:236-253; Sillar 2002; 2013). The site also includes a large walled enclosure (designated by site code R3) with 10 rows of almost identical 9 m wide circular structures. This battery of 152 circular build-

became the focus for elite Middle Horizon activ­ity (Table 1). This has further implications for our understanding of the subsequent Inka cult of Vira­cocha , which was associated with several former Middle Horizon sites. We suggest that the capture of these Wari and Tiwanaku sites and their devel­opment as Inka cult sites contributed to the moti­vation for, and justification of, Inka expansion. However the Inka construction of monumental architecture and theatrical open spaces for large­scale public involvement is quite distinct from the earlier Wari architecture that controlled its occu­pants with a more restricted focus on elite rituals. 
Iuka Construction at Cacha 
When the Inka began to expand south toward Lake Titicaca, they formed an alliance with the Canas 
ethnic group, who retained a high level of auton­omy and prestige while supplying the Inka with cru­cial military assistance (Sillar and Dean 2004) . Various colonial Spanish and indigenous authors mention Cacha (now known as Raqchi) within the territory of the Canas, and several of them specif­ically describe the Inka construction of the "tem­ple" (Betanzos 1996: 175 [1557:Ch. XLV]; Garcilaso de la Vega 1989:290 [1612: Ch. XXII]). 
Betanzos (1996:9-11 [1557:Ch. II]) recounts the mythical origins of Cacha through the actions of the animating deity Viracocha: After Conti ti Viracocha had created all people at Tiwanaku , he sent them under the ground to each ethnic group 's individual origin place (pacarinn). When Viracocha came to Cacha he called the Canas Indians to emerge from their origin place, but they failed to recognize the deity and came out with their weapons to attack him. Viracocha saw the Canas attacking him and caused fire to fall from heaven before relenting and saving the Canas. After this, Contiti Viracocha went on to Urcos, where another Inka temple to Viracocha was built, and then to Cuzco before going on to Puerto Viejo and across the sea . Betanzos states that, prior to the Inka period, the Canas had built a great shrine at Cacha, where Viracocha had commanded the fire from heaven, and they had carved a tall stone statue of Viracocha .

Betanzos (1996: 175 [1557:Ch. XLV]) also describes when the Inka Huayna Capac visited the site and ordered the erection of a large building where the statue to Viracocha was to be relocated alongside other houses to accommodate mama­conas and yanacona. Today, we can identify the lnka-style construction in the central sectors of the archaeological site at Raqchi (particularly the "tem­ple" and a series of highly regular courtyard build­ings known today as "Yanacancha" -a name probably given by Manuel Chavez Ballon in the 1960s) (Sillar and Dean 2004). The scale of these buildings and the confident use oflarge adobe bricks suggest that they were constructed fairly late in the development oflnka architecture, and Susan Niles (1999) identifies similarities with monumental use of adobe at Huayna Capac's estate at Quispiguanca. We collected and dated two samples of ichu grass incorporated into the adobe of the temple (OxA­12146, ichu, 462 ± 21,cal. 2u AD. 1435-1497) and the mortar from one of the Yanacancha courtyards 
buildings (OxA-12145,ichu,472±21 ,cal. 2a AD. 1430-1484) (Higham et al. 2007; Sillar and Dean 2004) (Table 2). These dates appear very slightly early but are roughly compatible with Rowe's sug­gested dates for the reign ofHuayna Capac, the last great Inka ruler (AD. 1493-1528). 
In the early colonial period, the Inka buildings at Cacha were abandoned, and during the Toledo reforms the population was forcibly relocated into the reducciones of Tinta and San Pedro. But the site of Cacha was reoccupied when community members returned to build the chapel and present village two hundred years ago . Today Raqchi is a 
village of approximately 100 households (Sillar 20 13). 
Previously we suggested (Sillar and Dean 2004) that as well as being a ritual center, Cacha may have functioned as a secure site where stores could be 
kept in order to quickly respond to any rebellions from the Lake Titicaca region. Cacha appeared to include many of the crucial characteristics that we expect of an Inka administrative center: it is located on a major Inkaroad; it has a large plaza and a raised platform; and we thought it included an impressive battery of storehouses (collcas). Like other major Inka administrative sites , such as Hatunqolla (Julien 1983) and Hucinuco Pampa (Morris and Thomp­son 1985), it appeared that Cacha was built on land that was relatively unoccupied prior to the Inka landscaping and construction project. Our investi­gation of the supposed collcas has forced us to rad­ically revise some aspects of these interpretations. 
Previous Research and Restoration Work 
Modem recording and research at Raqchi origi­nates in Squier 's (1877) description of the site. Manuel Chavez Ballon (1963) worked at Raqchi on a number of occasions, including excavations at the southern end of the temple. A further pro­gram of work was undertaken during the Spanish project directed by Manuel Ballesteros Gaibrois (1981, 1982; Lopez y Sebastian 1981) in associa­tion with the Peruvian Institute of Culture. In 1978 and 1979, Oscar Nunez del Prado (1962) under­took excavations and reconstruction around the area of the Yanacancha. Further interventions by the Peruvian National Institute of Culture to reveal and restore the site have been under the direction of Pedro Taca Changa (1994-1995, and 2003-2005), Alicia Quirita Huaracha (1996) and Washington Camacho Merma (1999-2002). 
In 1864 , when Raqchi was starting to be reoc­cupied , Squier (1877:411) illustrated the site and described the area of circular structures: 
Exterior to this outer wall are one hundred and twenty circular structures, each twenty-seven feet in diameter, ranged in ten rows of twelve,

the streets or passages between them being twelve feet wide. Every building has a door­way opening on the street, but the buildings are so disposed that the doorways do not face each other. These round buildings are com­paratively rude, and built throughout of rough blocks of lava. Interiorly , they show very lit­tle attempt at ornamentation. 
However, by the 1940s the majority of the cir­cular structures had been hidden by agricultural activities and the construction of field boundaries, so that Luis Pardo ( 1946:90) could only see two of these structures, even though he was aware of Squier's estimate of 120. Since the 1960s, this area has been a strong focus for clearance, excavation, mapping and restoration, including work in the 1940s and 1960s under the supervision of Chavez Ballon. In 1978 and 1979, Oscar Nunez del Prado oversaw the restoration of three of the structures and the clearing of a large area to reveal almost 40 structures, and by the 1980s, estimations of the number of collcas had risen to 80 (Hemming and Ranney 1982:193). Pedro Taca Chunga's work in 1993-1995 was particularly significant, clearing a substantial area and revealing the foundations of many buried collcas. Pedro Taca also undertook the complete reconstruction of the walls of seven of the northern structures and substantial reconstruc­tion of the westernmost line, basing his design of the doorways and high windows on the better sur­viving structures to the east. In 2001-2002 some of the outer perimeter wall was reconstructed under the direction of Washington Camacho. 
A Review of the Site Layout 
In 2001, Bill Sillar, Hugo Reynaga, and Herbeth Reynaga mapped all visible evidence for walls and foundations (Figure 2). In the southern part of the enclosure with circular structures (designated by the site code R3), a few of the structures were iden­tified by small sections of foundation walls revealed by Pedro Taca's 2.0 by 2.0 m evaluation trenches. Although the diameter of a few buildings is diffi­cult to evaluate, there is sufficient evidence to attest to all 152 circular buildings located within the large enclosure. These are arranged in 10 rows running approximately northeast to southwest, with a fur­ther row located to the north of the compound (at 90 degrees to the 10 rows). Access is restricted to a principal corridor running down the middle of the enclosure, which can currently be entered through three gateways in the northern side of the enclo­sure wall. It is difficult to be certain whether these gateways are all original, as the outer enclosure wall has had various phases of reconstruction work. The southern wall has been largely destroyed , and we do not know if there were ever any further entrances to the south. 
In order to facilitate their identification, we gave each circular structure a unique number and letter code . Moving from north to south , each structure was identified in numerical order, while moving from the west to the east, each structure was given a letter in alphabetical order (Figure 3). Numbers 2B, 2C, 2E, 2G, 2H, 2I and 2J were not used, as at the time of starting our numbering we were uncer­tain whether there were any structures in this area

to the northeast of the enclosure; our excavation of a trench in this area,however,clearly demonstrated that no structures were ever built there. 
Each circular building is of a relatively consis­tent size at ca. 9 m external diameter and ca. 7.4 m internal diameter, with walls 1.0-.8 m wide at floor level, and the (now restored) line of struc­tures along the northeast side of the enclosure being slightly larger at close to 10 m external diam­eter. There are 59 structures where the base of the original doorway survives clearly enough to be cer­tain of its size. These vary from .55-.70 m wide, somewhat tapering to .6-.4 mat the top, but there are only three for which the height of the doors can be determined, at around 1.9 m above the orig­inal ground surface. Where the wall did not sur­vive to sufficient height to show the original door position, we indicate a continuous wall (Figure 3); however, the door positions are sufficiently regu­lar and clear to hypothesize that each line of struc­tures had all their doorways facing in the same direction. No doorways face toward the outer com­pound wall, and no doorways face toward the cen­tral corridor. A thin vertical wall ran along both sides of the central corridor, hiding the circular walls behind. Although each puilding is con­structed as a complete, separate structure, the buildings are built so close together that it is impos­sible for even the thinnest person to walk between them. At a few locations where this gap was wider, additional bonding material was added after the construction of the circular buildings to close the gap (e.g., between each of the structures from 91 to 121). Thus, movement into and around the com­pound is highly constrained. 
Only structures 3G and 3H have their walls sur­viving to sufficient height to preserve high windows (ca .. 3 by .6 m) with the probable bases of second windows. These are located symmetrically on the opposite side from the entrance way, approximately 
2.3 m above the original floor level. 
This leaves a large area in the southwest quar­ter of the rectangular enclosure that is free of the circular buildings.A "dividing wall" running along the north of this open area was built using flatter stones with mud mortar, and our clearing revealed a comer to the northeast, which suggested that it formed a rectangular building (as later confirmed by Pedro Taca's excavations). Close to this comer there is a significant gap between circular structures 11 F and 12F (Figure 3). Excavation here confirmed the absence of a circular structure and the presence of a small, rudely built, rectangular structure abut­ting 12F. This small rectangular structure effec­tively polices the point at which someone entering the compound has to decide in which direction and to which circular structures they are going. 
Our Early Hypothesis for lnka State Storage at Raqchi 
We assumed R3 to be an lnka construction due to the large quantity of lnka pottery on the surface, and because the R3 enclosure forms an integral part of the overall planning of the lnka temple and Yanacancha area (Rl). In 1999, we felt fairly con­fident about our interpretation of the R3 enclosure as an lnka storage facility, and this is how R3 has been interpreted in most previous publications (e.g., Hemming and Rarnmey 1982, 193; Pardo 1946:90; Snead 1992). Lines of regular circular or square buildings used for state storage are described by several Spanish chroniclers (e.g., Pizarro 1921 :272­273 [1571); Polo 1916:59 [1571); Sancho de la Hoz 1917:194-195 [1532) (quoted in Morris 1992:ix-x); see Murra 1975:243-254) and a num­ber of archaeological examples have been studied (e.g., D'Altroy 1992; D' Altroy and Hastorf 1984; Huaycochea Nunez de la Torre 1994; Le Vine 1992; Morris 1967, 1981, 1982; Snead 1992). 
The form and layout of the R3 enclosure resem­bled the drawing of a storehouse "accountant" pro­vided by Guaman Poma (1980:309 [1615:335)), which shows circular structures built in tightly formed lines with their doorways facing in a sin­gle direction. We hypothesized that the regular lines ofcollcas would facilitate recording their contents on khipus, as shown by Guaman Poma. Hernando Pizarro (1920:175, 178 [1533)) explained that when his men removed goods from Inka store­houses, the record keepers "untied some of the knots which they had in the deposits section [of the khipu], and they [re-]tied them in another section [of the khipu]" (quoted in Urton 2003:3). If the open area to the southwest of the Raqchi enclosure was used to sort and dry produce prior to storage, then the small rectangular building between struc­tures llF and 12F seemed the perfect position for a khipukamayoc to update records of goods going in and out of the stores. We considered it likely that distinct rows and sections were used to store dif-

ferent goods in a comparable way to the organiza­tion of stored goods recorded in the khipu from Xauxa (Murra 1975:243-254). 
On a visit to Raqchi, Gordon McEwan and Melissa Chatfield (personal communication 1999) suggested that the layout of this area had more in common with Wari architecture than normal Inka planning. Certainly, we were aware ofnotable dif­ferences between Raqchi and the better studied examples of Inka collcas. The circular structures at Raqchi are somewhat larger than most circular collcas (9 m in diameter compared to 5 m at Huanuco Viejo). Inka collcas are normally highly visible and well ventilated due to their location on hillsides where the cool dry air of the Andean high­lands helped to preserve their contents (Morris 1981; Protzen 1993; Sillar 1996:283). The circu­lar buildings at Raqchi break this model as they are located on a flat area close to the valley floor where the large enclosure wall would limit airflow and prevent people's view into the structures. Nev­ertheless, Spanish chroniclers (e.g., Pedro Pizarro 1921:272-273 [1571]; Sancho de la Hoz 1917:155-157 [1534]) reported that one of the largest zones of storage in Cuzco, where military equipment was stored, was hidden away within Sacsayhuman (Bauer 2004:98-103). Given the Inka's close alliance with the Canas, we thought it quite likely that the Raqchi collcas might also have been used as a secure location for military supplies in case of a Colla rebellion. Thus, in 1999, we felt fairly confident that deviations from the location and planning of other Inka collcas could be explained by the specific circumstances of the Canas alliance with the Inka. But we must now acknowledge and admire McEwan and Chatfield's insightful and correct interpretation. 
Investigating the C ollcas 
Excavation Strategy 

Our excavation strategy was designed in relation to our assumptions that the R3 circular structures were Inka state storage, and to make use of the earlier excavations of Pedro Taca, where almost 50 open trenches provided exposed sections. We proposed to identify floor levels within these sections and then excavate small .5 x .5 m probes with an empha­sis on the collection of artifact debris and botanical samples from each floor surface. The hope was that differences in the recovered assemblages could be used to identify the organization of storage at the site. We also proposed to undertake total excava­tion within two of the structures to see if we could identify any spatial organization, structural divi­sions, or details of floor construction, such as ven­tilation, to facilitate storage. Furthermore, we wanted to investigate the wall dividing the area of circular structures from the open quarter to the southwest, as we had identified the style of this wall construction as being similar to that at the Middle Horizon site at Yanamancha (R8, see below), and we thought it was the only evidence for pre-Inka activity in the central area. This "dividing wall" was subsequently revealed as part of a long rectangular building with subdivisions during Pedro Taca's 2003 excavations (Figure 3). 
As we began to clean the sections from previ­ous excavations, it became clear that agricultural ploughing and bioturbation had removed the floor levels from most of these structures. The apparent good survival of so many structures was deceptive, as most buildings had been destroyed to below their original ground level; it is only because the foun­dations were so substantial that remains of every structure have survived. Thus we were unable to find intact floor levels in our excavations of struc­tures 3B, 6B, 6C, 12F, 12G, 16G, and 17G. How­ever, we did identify floors to sample in structures 7B, 12B, 5E, 3F, 7G, and 121, and we concentrated our efforts on their excavation. Artifacts, primar­ily pottery, were bagged, washed, and marked prior to study by Bill Sillar and Amelia Perez Trujillo. Samples for archaeobotanical analysis were processed by flotation by Helen Garcia Luna, and the charred botanical remains were exported by permission of the Peruvian Instituto Nacional de Cultura (INC) and analyzed using the comparative collections at Berkeley by Emily Dean. A report of the excavations was submitted to the INC (Sillar et al. 2004). 
Foundations, Floors, and Hearths

make up the ground surface and floor levels. Geo­logical assessments by Ruperto Benevente and David Jordan suggest that this area had little vol­canic stone on it until people brought it over from Kinsach'ata for the construction work, although we did encounter layers of volcanic ash. This sug­gests that the area was relatively open at the start of construction, facilitating the site planning and layout of the foundation trenches. In many cases, volcanic rock was used to create a close-fitting, stone-lined floor; however, in at least one case (7G), a compacted earth floor was identified. There was no evidence for any under-floor ventilation or drainage. 
Pottery and the "Problem" of Long-lived Ceramic Traditions 
Concurrent with the fieldwork, we cleaned and documented 1653 pottery sherds from our exca­vation of R3. All of this pottery was classified by the fabric as well as the form and decoration. Much of this pottery was on or near the surface , includ­ing 393 sherds of modem pottery. The pottery from secure contexts within the collcas was in a very fragmentary condition, with most sherds under 4 cm in diameter; as many of them were undecorated body sherds from coarse jars and cooking pots, this made full identification difficult. 
Our pottery analysis starts by classifying the fabric (i.e., the appearance of the break across the sherd, focusing on clay color; color, size, and shape of the inclusions; and firing conditions), so nearly every sherd can be assigned a fabric code, which in some cases can relate to a particular period when the pottery was produced and with specific styles of decoration. However, some of the most common fabrics were produced for long periods . This is par­ticularly true for the long-lived fabrics character-

ized by abundant coarse quartz inclusions, C3 and C9 . C9 was the main fabric used during the For­mative period, usually with a characteristic bur­nished surface, often with incised or applique decoration (here we use "Formative" to refer to the Early Horizon and Early Intermediate period ceramics, as we do not yet have a clear basis for distinguishing them) . In the Middle Horizon, C3 and C9 were used to make undecorated round­based jars of different sizes, and this continued into the Late Intermediate Period (Dean 2005). Larger sherds with diagnostic features in these fabrics can be dated to specific periods, but we are unable to date small, undecorated C3 body sherds; there were 524 sherds of C3 and 19 sherds of C9 found in the excavation of R3, many of them coming from secure deposits. 
Another significant local fabric is the orange-col­ored C 11, which has a laminar structure due to the use of shale inclusions. This is used to make a wide range of forms, including large jars, cooking pots, bowls, and keros, frequently with a thin red slip and black wavy lines or loose geometric motifs such as crosshatching. This is almost certainly what Rowe (1956:144) was referring to when he wrote, "The characteristic post-Tiahuanaco style of the area around Sicuani is a carelessly painted black on red (Raqch'i style), related to the Collao Black on Red

of the northern Titicaca basin." C11 was used to make the dominant Late Intermediate period (LIP) style in this part of the Vilcanota valley; it occurs on some Middle Horizon sites and it continued in production and use during the Inka period. There were 12S Cll sherds excavated in R3. 
Another characteristic LIP fabric group has quartzite as the main inclusion (C12); this fabric starts in the early Middle Horizon and was used to make finely burnished keros. Fabrics CS and CS are soft fine fabrics with very small natural vesic­ular glass inclusions possibly due to using volcanic ash as a tempering material. These fabrics are quite specific to the production of the polychrome dec­orated pottery of the Middle Horizon, including pottery found at Yanamancha (see below); we found five sherds of CS and 14 sherds of CS in R3, many of them from secure contexts. C12 was also present at Yanamancha and was used to make some Ocros-style bowls and drinking vessels (as also identified by Bauer [1999, 2004] at Muyu Roqo). 

C32 is a pottery fabric that originates in the Inka period and is very similar to the fabric (C20) pre­pared by modem potters living in Raqchi today, with both using the volcanic stone from Kin­sach' ata as a tempering material. In the surface deposits in the area of R3 , there was a very wide range of Inka pottery fabrics and decorative tradi­tions, including Cuzco ( C43 and C44) and Lake Tit­icaca area Pacajes (C31) wares. 
The 22S sherds of diagnostic Inka pottery occur in a wide range of fabrics and decorative traditions, suggesting a lot of Inka activity in the area (see below), and our dominant impression during the excavation continued to be that the collcas were indeed Inka. However, although there were Inka sherds which we came across on or close to the orig­inal floor surfaces in some of the structures (e.g., contexts 211, 216 and 219 in SE; 270 in 7G, 232 in 1J; and 3S2 in 121), there were no diagnostic lnka sherds from primary construction or under floor contexts; indeed, there are very few diagnostic dec­orated sherds from these contexts (Tables 3 and 4). The majority of the pottery from secure contexts were undecorated jars and cooking pots in fabrics C3, C9, Cll and C12; 7S of these sherds have car­bonized deposits resulting from their use on the fire. Nineteen sherds of CS and CS (fabrics used to make Arahuay-style pottery) suggest some Middle Hori­zon activity, and some other fabrics present we believe may also be Middle Horizon (e.g., CS3, CS4). Thirty-five sherds of C 12 included an Ocros­sty le straight-sided flaring bowl found within an ash deposit (context 13) of structure 12B (Supple­mental Figure 2); this, like the variant of Ocros sty le found at Pikillacta (Glowacki 200S: 103) is slipped in a medium orange, rather than the bright light­orange of Ayacucho. 
This pottery identification confounded our expectations and raised many new questions. Did the small amount of diagnostic Middle Horizon pottery associated with the construction and use of the collcas point to prior Middle Horizon activ­ity in the area? Did the highly fragmented sherds from cooking pots and coarse jars associated with ash spreads and two hearths suggest culinary activ­ities rather than storage? Our research strategy placed a strong emphasis on the recovery and analysis of botanical evidence to clarify some of these issues.

Archaeobotany: Seeds and Tubers 
Archaeobotanical evidence obtained from Inka storehouses does not, alas, yield a checklist of cri­teria by which to identify collcas. As D' Al troy and Hastorf noted from their excavation of Inca store­houses in the Mantaro Valley: 
The variable composition of the plant remains in the qollqa is suggestive of the complexity of the storage organization. Among the six structures tested were (1) two buildings with essentially no crops, (2) two with a single crop, and (3) two with several crops. Wood and grass remains were recovered from all qollqa, per­haps reflecting either matting for storage or the thatched roofing characteristic of Inca struc­tures (Gasparini and Margolies 1980; Morris 1967). [D' Altroy and Hastorf 1984:346] 
We hypothesised that the archaeobotanical sig­nature of an Inka storehouse might have the fol­lowing pattern: 
1. 
Strongly patterned plant taxa within collca groups and individual collcas, e.g., high densities of maize in one area of collca "A" and high densi­ties of quinoa, and nothing but quinoa, in collca "B ." 

2. 
Little species diversity within a single con­text in a collca, e.g, one would not expect to find twenty different plant taxa from a single floor sur­face sample. 

3. 
Relatively clean floors. In fact, ifa collca had been well maintained, why should there be any car­bonized macrobotanical remains? Efficient stor­age facilitates the removal of goods. Only if some aspect of the use, maintenance, or abandonment resulted in the charring of organic remains should archaeologists be able to identify what was being 


stored. However, the fact that charred plant remains have been recovered from other collcas was encouraging (D' Altroy and Hastorf 1984; Huay­cochea Nufiez de la Torre 1994). 
Within the regimented lines of circular struc­tures at Raqchi we anticipated finding relatively low densities of botanical remains with little species diversity and strong spatial patterning so that "like would be grouped with like." The results surprised us on a number of levels. 
Excavators collected a total of 109 bulk soil samples that were processed with a mechanized SMAP-style flotation machine (see Hastorf 1999; Hastorf and Popper 1988:6; Watson 1976). Emily Dean then analyzed 55 samples collected from the 30 most secure archaeological contexts. We ran eight poppy seed tests (see Wagner 1982), which indicated a recovery rate of 94 percent . Dean ana­lyzed, identified, and quantified all charred mate­rial larger than .5 mm; smaller material was bagged and saved for future analysis. Plant reference col­lections housed in the U. C. Berkeley Paleoeth­nobotany Lab and botany reference works such as Martin and Barkley's (196 1) Seed Identification Manual aided in the identification of plant taxa. The resulting botanical data were quantified using three different techniques: density, ubiquity, and relative percentages (Hastorf and Popper 198 8) so that rel­ative proportions of taxa from different units can be compared (Pearsall 2000). 
Chenopodium, tubers, and wood were the most common taxa overall, with maize coming in a dis­tant fourth (Figure 7). There was a relatively high level of species in virtually all of the excavated con­texts, with a total taxonomic diversity of over 20 species and genera. This pattern is one we might

expect to see in domestic rather than storage con­texts (cf. D' Al troy and Hastorf 1984). Samples contained an array of Andean domesticated crops (tubers, maize, quinoa, legumes, oca, chili), eco­nomically useful wild plants (mint , reeds, Schinus molle sp., etc.), as well as wild grass seeds and charred wood that could originate from brush wood and dung used as fuel. Table 5 presents the com­plete list of all recovered taxa, their common and scientific names, and their potential economic uses. 
On a context-by-context basis, most of the R3 macrobotanical assemblages (Figures 8a and 8b) closely resembled the domestic assemblages Dean (2005) excavated from the nearby Terminal Mid­dle Horizon period and Late Intermediate period sites of Kinsich'ata Cocha (R22), Pukara Uhu (R 18) and Pukara Sicuani (Dean 2005). All of these sites exhibited a diversity of economically useful domesticated and non-domesticated plants. 
At first glance, there are two exceptions to this "domestic" pattern within the R3 samples (Figures 8c and 8d). Chenopodium (Chenopodium spp.) dominated the assemblage in structure SE (Figure 8c). However, the flotation samples from this con­text were associated with one of the small domes­tic-sized hearths (Figures 4 and 5) . Quinoa seeds are small, and thousands might be contained in one overturned cooking pot . The archaeobotanical con­texts from structure 3F (Figure 8d) contained a rel­atively high concentration of tubers, although other species, such as maize, were also present . Given these associations , we interpret the botanical remains from these two samples as the remnants of cooking disasters, and we assumed the some­what ephemeral hearths sitting on top of stone floors, and directly under the upper layer of rubble and topsoil,represented a final colonial reuse of the Inka structures. Frankly, we were much more excited by the presence of well-preserved tubers excavated from the burnt , compacted, earth floor of Structure 7G. 
Radiocarbon Dating: When the Facts Undermine a Perfectly Good Hypothesis 
We submitted a sample (OxA-12147) of the car­bonized tubers from the burnt , compacted, earth floor of Structure 70 to the Oxford Radiocarbon Labs (funded by Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) for AMS dating in the hope that this could identify more precisely what part of the Inka phase they dated to. We hypothesized that the density of tubers justified our interpreting this struc­ture as an Inka "collca." We were shocked when sample OxA-12147 gave a Middle Horizon date of 1240 BP± 22 (cal. A.D. 775-936) (Table 2). 
After receiving this unexpectedly early date, we began to reconsider our initial interpretation of con­text 255 and the "floor" of structure 7G. We hypoth­esized that the original lnka stone-lined floor had been destroyed and that we had inadvertently dug down to a much earlier Middle Horizon context of compacted silt . We submitted a sample of car-

bonized quinoa seeds collected from the ash deposit 
(context 201) within one of the hearths situated 
immediately below the modern overburden and constructed on top of the paved stone floor of struc­ture SE. We thought it likely that this hearth repre­sented a later reuse of an Inka structure , possibly by early colonial squatters , giving us an end-date for the use of the structures. But Sample OxA­13926 from our hypothesized "colonial" cooking disaster also gave a Middle Horizon date of 1273 BP± 25 (cal. A.D.694-889) (Table 2). These two dates leave little doubt that the so-called co/leas at Raqchi were not Inka. Our excavations had revealed hearths, utilitarian pottery, and a mixed sweep of botanical taxa suggesting a habitation rather than a storage function, while the carbonized 
plant remains and a small amount of diagnostic 
pottery recovered from secure contexts date to the Middle Horizon (probably sometime around A.D. 
700--900). Our initial assumption that these were 
Inka storage structures was completely disproved. 
The Function of the Wari Enclosures with Conjoined Buildings 
Given that the battery of circular structures at Raqchi date to the Middle Horizon, how are we to under­stand them? An obvious comparison is to be made with the Wari enclosures with "small conjoined buildings" at Pikillacta and Azangaro (Figure 9) . 
Within Sector 4 of Pikillacta there are 501 con­joined buildings with internally and externally rounded corners roughly 5 m long and 4 m wide arranged within five walled enclosures, each of 
which has an internal plaza in one comer. Early 
studies looked at the relatively small size of these

regimented structures to argue a direct analogy with Inkacollcas and suggest that these were Wari sate storage (Harth-Terre 1959; Lanning 1967; Sanders 1973 [quoted in McEwan 2005: 158]; Schreiber 1 992:270). But, after excavation at Pikillacta, McE­wan (1987, 1991: 117) interpreted these as living quarters due to the presence of hearths, ash layers, and occupation debris, including soot-marked cooking pots. McEwan ( 1991: 116) suggests that sector 4 was a latter addition to Pikillacta dating to around A.D. 800-850. More recently, Glowacki (in McEwan 2005:123) has reviewed the pottery from Pikillacta, also suggesting that its construc­tion started during Epoch lB (ca. 600-800 A.D.) and continued into Epoch 2 (from around 800 
A .D .) . McEwan (2005: 116) has provided two dates from samples of pisipita vine ropes within the walls of Unit 12 in Sector 4 at Pikillacta (Tc 3996 [1 100 

iB.P. ± 60,cal.A.D. 871-1152] and Tx 4247 [1140 
· 
B.P. ± 60, cal.A.D. 777-1099). In his more recent publication, McEwan (2005:158-160) refers to Salomon's (1995:321) analysis of colonial period ancestor worship in central Peru and reinterprets the sector 4 structures as houses for the ancestral mummies of local kinship groups. This argument is based on a small number of human remains (an arm, a few ribs, a few pieces of skull, and some teeth) from the 19 structures that have been exca­vated. Skeletal parts were built into walls of some Middle Horizon constructions (e.g., McEwan 2005:52-53). However, we would not place so much interpretative emphasis on the presence of a few human bones when interpreting the function of this entire architectural complex, especially as mobile mummies have not yet been identified as a Middle Horizon practice (Isbell and Young­Sanchez 2012: 266). We would rather emphasize the presence of small hearths and equipment for (small-scale) food preparation with virtually no decorated pottery or other ritual paraphernalia in the conjoined rooms at Pikillacta and Raqchi. This suggests that these conjoined structures were occu­pied and used as living quarters. 

In the central sector of Azangaro, Anders ( 1991: 170) mapped "forty rows of conjoined rooms arranged in two banks on either side of a central corridor." The rectangular rooms with rounded cor­ners include 304 that measure 2.4 x 9 .2 m, and 36 smaller rooms that measure 2.4 x 3.6 m. Narrow foundation trenches up to 1.0 m deep had walls fit­ted snugly into them. Both flag stone paving and packed earth floors were found in the central sec­tion (Anders 1991:178) with mud plaster on the walls. At Azangaro, water conduits ran down some corridors , and benches lined all side corridors (Anders 1991 :180-1 81). The limited artifact assemblage consisted of "nonprestigious ceramic wares and forms" (Anders 1991:192), although Sector IV (rows 19 and 20) had abundant domes­tic remains, and Anders suggested evidence for

"suprahousehold preparation, serving and con­sumption of food" (Anders 1991: 191). These rooms neighbor the largely unexcavated long "gallery rooms" next to the plaza to south of the central sector. Anders's (1991:192-194) sugges­tion that Azangaro could have expressed a calen­drical/ceremonial function has not been developed by other researchers.An (unidentified) carbon sam­ple (Beta-187 4) from a dump layer within the cen­tral sector provided an uncalibrated date reported as A.D. 880 ± 50 (Anders 1991:185). 
Unlike the rounded-comer rectangular build­ings of Azangaro and Pikillacta, the structures within the enclosure wall at Raqchi have circular building plans. Topic (1991:154) describes 5 m diameter circular structures associated with the Middle Horizon shrine at Cerro Amaru near Vira­cochapampa; these have pairs of small, high win­dows similar to those at Raqchi. Topic used evidence for raised floors to argue that these were used as storage structures, albeit with a secondary domestic occupation. Only eight survive, although Topic suggests there may have been up to 24 orig­inally and identifies two associated rectangular structures. Although lacking the higher number of con joined buildings and the walled enclosures seen at Pikillacta, Azangaro, and Raqchi, these Cerro Amaru structures have some similarity to those at Raqchi. The Cerro Amaru structures are the best contenders for specialized Wari state storage yet found, although it is difficult to compare to the other sites without a more detailed plan. 
There is a consistent reporting of exceedingly deep foundations and tight trenches at Wari sites 
(e.g., Isbell et al 1991:34; McEwan 2005:65; Schreiber 1978: 148); this is also true for R3, sug­gesting that the foundations may have been laid out to act as a pro-forma for the site plan and as a support to the characteristic high Wari walls. Excavations within the conjoined buildings at Pikillacta and Azangaro, like our excavations in Raqchi, show similar evidence for cooking and a dearth of prestige ceramics. The highly frag­mented cooking pots and jars and the diverse archaeobotanical evidence point to repetitive small-scale quotidian activities, but not state stor­age . Jennings (2006) also casts doubt on the evi­dence for centralized storage at these Wari sites, and suggests that this should prompt a reevalua­tion of current models for Wari political and eco­nomic organization. The layout of these sites greatly restricted movement , and this, along with the lack of individual activity space for each struc­ture, is counter to long-term occupation by fam­ily groups. Raqchi, Pikillacta, and Azangaro's large enclosures with conjoined buildings each include longer rectangular structures on one side of their associated internal plazas. These plazas and long buildings may have provided an area for group assembly, administration, and provision. 
All of this suggests medium-term accommo­dation for state coordinated groups, such as a sea­sonal labor force or an army cohort . We can perhaps think of these enclosures as Wari "labor camps" where inmates were forced to engage in state directed activities such as agricultural pro­duction. Or the enclosures could be a military bar­racks for a standing army, and it may be significant that the northern wall at Raqchi has a walkway and possible parapet . Indeed, the Wari may not have made a distinction between workers and fighters, with the people in this state housing expected to fulfill both roles. 
The number, size, and arrangement of this hous­ing could be one avenue to research the adminis­trative organization of the Wari state. For instance, in the case of Pikillacta, the five distinctly sepa­rate, walled-off sections within Sector 4, each with its own plaza area, could relate to labor obligations from distinct sociopolitical or ethnic groups (per­haps suggesting that the diversity of small ethnic groups in the Cuzco area recorded for the Inka period had its origins much earlier) . But we also need to consider why these three administrative sites required such housing when others did not . For example, the evidence for an immigrant work force occupying more organic family households at Cerro Mejia adjacent to Cerro Baul suggests a quite different strategy in that area (Nash 2002). The dates suggest that Raqchi 's R3 structures were in use (ca.A.D. 700-900) around the same time or possibly slightly earlier than those at Pikillacta or Azangaro (ca.A.D. 800-1000).Amore precise fix on when these conjoined buildings were con­structed and what was taking place in the long rooms and plazas also contained within these enclo­sures would help us understand a significant shift in Wari state craft.

Greater Raqchi: 
A Middle Horizon Site Complex 

We believe that Raqchi was a major Middle Hori­zon center, smaller than , but comparable to, the better known complex of sites around Pikillacta and Huaro. There are three further sites dating to the Middle Horizon located around the volcano Kinsach'ata (Figure 10). Although stratigraphic excavation, artifact analysis, and dating are ' required to fully understand the sequence and func­tion of this Middle Horizon occupation, here we offer a tentative suggestion of the relationship 
between the four sites. 
Yanamancha (R8), located 800 meters to the 
southeast of Raqchi (Figure l 0), was first reported 
by Rowe ( 1956) and has been greatly disturbed by 
centuries of farming and the constant reworking of 
the Cuzco to Puno highway. A wide range of dec­
orated Formative period pottery (primarily in the 
C9 and C3 fabrics) can be found on the surface 
(Dean 2005). There is also a dense scatter of dee­orated Middle Horizon pottery and obsidian deb­itage. This includes bow ls and drinking cups (keros) in the C5 and C8 fabrics as well as Ocros-style bowls and drinking vessels in C12 and Cl4 fabrics similar to those Brian Bauer (1999:63-65) found at Muyu Roqo.Although recent movement of stone to clear fields for agriculture has remodelled much of Yanamancha, some sections of very substantial walls from large rectangular buildings still survive. These substantial walls use long, flat stones in abun­dant reddish mud mortar, and it was this construc­tion style that we recognized in the long wall of the rectangular building within the R3 enclosure . 
Possibly contemporary with R3 is the site of Wanq 'osiki (R 11), approximately 1 km to the west of Raqchi. Although Wanq'osiki has also been greatly affected by its current use as agricultural fields, it has a clear and well-planned orthogonal layout with some walls surviving to 4 m in height. The ceramic assemblage at Wanq'osiki is charac­terized by the same undecorated C3 jars that we found at R3 and the absence of decorated pottery.

There are also a number of chakitaqlla blades, ham­
mer stones , and curpanas (round or oval river cob­
bles with a single hourglass-shaped hole in the 
center, which could have been used as mace heads 
but could just as probably have been used as agri­
cultural implements to break up clods of earth) . 
While the layout of the site suggests a state-spon­
sored construction, the limited surface material 
seems to point to a low-prestige functional site. 
Acanal brought water down to Wanq' osiki from 
Mt. Aukisa, crossing onto the flanks ofKinsach' ata 
by passing over an aqueduct with a stepped pro­
file; it then goes through the site ofWanq' osiki and 
across another stepped profile aqueduct before it 
irrigates the plane below Wanq'osiki. This Kin­
sach'ata canal and its aqueducts have some simi­
larities to the Rumiqolqa canal at Pikillakta 
(McEwan 1991; Valencia in McEwan 2005) La 
Cuchilla at Viracochapampa (Topic 1991 : 154) and 
Yacutuccyocc atAzangaro (Anders 1991:167). 

Our redating of sector R3 raises the question of whether any other parts of the "Inka" site at Raqchi need redating. From our own work we are confi­dent that all of the major buildings (the temple and Y anacancha (R 1], as well as Carce I Raqay (R5] and most of the terracing) are Inka. It is likely that the area of the enclosed pond (R2) and the platform (R4) were the focus of earlier activity, but the vis­ible surface remains are lnka. However the large perimeter wall (muralla) (R 7 -Figure 10) that sur­rounds the site could be earlier. This dry-stone wall runs along the volcanic rubble ofKinsach'ata, sur­viving up to heights of3.5 m.ltis 1.5-2.0m wide, and stretches over 3 .5 km around Raqchi with four entrances. (When Chavez Ballon was reconstruct­ing part of the muralla in the 1960s, he removed a mummified body in fetal position from within the wall at the northern entrance -placing human remains in walls is a recognised Wari activity and less common on Inka sites). Such perimeter walls were not a common feature of lnka sites, whereas the use of high walls to surround major sites is a much more common Wari trait. 
Pukara Uhu (Rl8), located on the volcanic rock south and east of the lnka complex ofRaqchi,just beyond the muralla, covers approximately 13 ha and consists of approximately 250 circular to oval structures varying from 3-5 min diameter with a few smaller 1.0-1 .5 m structures. All these are arranged "randomly" with no evidence of central planning and are interpreted as domestic houses and chullpas. There are also a wide variety of burials in the area, with multiple individuals placed in small natural caverns (Dean 2005). The architec­ture and burial pattern fits within the broad char­acteristics of Late Intermediate period sites; most radiocarbon samples date to this period, and the ceramic assemblage is dominated by the C3 fabric (Dean 2005). However, one carbon sample exca­vated from within these structures dates to the late Middle Horizon (Beta 156736, charred seed, 1330 BP± 40,cal.A.D. 660-866),suggesting that some parts of Pukara Uhu (and a few similar structures on top ofKinsich'ata) could have been contempo­raneous with the Middle Horizon occupation at R3, Yanamancha and Wanq'osiki. Excavations at Pukara Uhu have uncovered only a very small amount of diagnostic Middle Horizon ceramics, including some in the CS fabric and a puma head from an incensario (Dean 2005:338). 
A further observation may be drawn from the early colonial descriptions of the huaca at Cacha. Betanzos (1996:10 [1557: Ch.II]) describes the statue of Viracocha as being almost five varas in length and one vara in width (4.0 x .8 m). Betan­zos reports that an old Indian of Cacha described Viracocha as a tall, bearded man with a belt, hold­ing something in his hand. Cieza de Leon (1986a: 10[1556:Ch. VJ) reported seeing the huaca at Cacha in 1549, and he also describes it as a tall statue with its arms crossed, a belt around its waste, and "buttons" and that the idol had the stature of a man with a crown or tiara on its head (Cieza de Leon 1986b:270 [1556:Ch. XCVIII]). Unfortu­nately this statue no longer survives, but it is rare to have descriptions of Andean iconography from the early colonial period, and these independent, detailed descriptions of the huaca at Raqchi are from two of the most reliable cronistas. What they describe is unlike Inka or Wari sculptures , but has more in common with the Lake Titicaca area sculp­tural traditions of Tiwanaku and Yaya-Mama, although Cieza de Leon explicitly states that the Raqchi huaca was not dressed like a Tiwanaku sculpture (1986a: 10 [1556:Ch. VJ). This may point to an earlier phase of Lake Titicaca influence prior to (or possibly during) the Wari presence. 
The full sequence of construction, occupation, and abandonment of the Raqchi area sites during the Middle Horizon requires further research. Nev-

ertheless, it is clear that Yanamancha was an impor­tant ceremonial center with very substantial Mid­dle Horizon buildings, prestige artifacts, and perhaps significant statuary, with origins going back to the Formative. The planned sites at Raqchi (R3) and Wanq'osiki, as well as the hydraulic pro­ject of the Kinsach' ata canal and aqueducts, are typ­ical of Wari state-sponsored construction projects and suggest that one focus for this endeavour was agricultural production. This complex of Middle Horizon sites fits McEwan 's ( 1987 :59) concept for Wari "greater sites" with distinct functional sectors delimited by surrounding walls that separate cere­monial from administrative areas while they remain linked by roads and canals. 
Glowacki and Malpass (2003) have developed Gose's (1993) ideas that the expansion of the Wari empire was partly motivated by a concern to incor­porate and engage with pre-existing shrines, par­ticularly those focused on springs, lakes, and water sources (see also Schreiber 2004). Yanamancha's prior significance in the late Formative, and Wari activity around the volcano of Kinsach' ata and its associated springs, suggest that Raqchi provides an independent example to strengthen the argument of Glowacki and Malpass. Is it possible that San­tacruz Pachacuti Yamqui's (1993: 190 [1615: f.4v]) description of the creator deity Tonapa Vira­cochampa Cachan destroying the hill of Cacha because he took offense at a female idol kept on top of it was a local memory of the Wari usurping of the site? Schreiber ( 1992) has stressed the social difference between the restricted movement and constrained visibility at Wari sites in comparison to the accessible, highly visible, more "open plan" ritual theatres at Tiwanaku (and later Inka sites). Schreiber (1992:280) suggests that Tiwanaku "brought people in" to rituals as public spectacles, whereas Wari's high walls and more limited statu­ary suggest smaller scale rituals that commoners were excluded from viewing. Wari's focus on pre­existing cult sites shows how the Wari had a strong interest in rituals that engaged with sacred land­scapes, but this was an elite level activity; there is less evidence of Wari investment in architectural spaces or feasting equipment for large-scale pub­lic ceremonies that incorporated local populations (Jennings 2006). Thus, in spite of Wari's signifi­cant influence on subsequent Inka culture and state­craft (Isbell and Young-Sanchez 2012),lnkaforms 
of public ritual may have more in common with the practices of Tiwanaku than Wari. 
The Cult of Viracocha: Iuka State Ritual 

Recognizing that the construction of the circular structures in R3 date to the Middle Horizon, we need to reconsider the Inka strategy at Raqchi .As the lnka expanded beyond their heartland they frequently constructed administrative centers in order to coor­dinate the political and economic integration of con­quered/ assimilated people within the empire (Astuhuaman 2008; D' Altroy 2002). Previously we felt that the Inka site at Raqchi was a state adminis­trative center (Sillar and Dean 2004), however, the "loss" oflnka storage substantially alters our under­standing of lnka strategy in the area. Our reading of colonial sources should have alerted us to this: Cacha is never mentioned within lists of cabezas de provin­cias (Cieza de Le6n 1986a:56 [1551:Ch. XX), nor is it mentioned as a pueblo principal (Cobo 
1964: 114, 129 [1653:Vol.2 XXV and XXXIl]). Nei­ther is there any early colonial mention oflnka stor­age at Cacha; in fact, Cieza de Le6n (1986a: 126 [1556:Ch. XLII]) states that the Canas were not obliged to pay tribute to the Inka, and our survey work has shown that the Inka had surprisingly little impact on the surrounding area (Dean 2005). Apart from the construction of a few tambos, the area appears to have been left under the control of the local Canas elite. Spanish chroniclers only referred to Cacha in connection to Viracocha, the origin myth, or lnka religious activities. The ruins at Raqchi are probably best understood in a similar way to Pacha­camac, and the Isla del Sol as a multi-period shrine and religious center that the Inka conquered and then reconstructed for their own state rituals. 
At the end of the Middle Horizon, a sphere of interaction developed across the previous Tiwanaku/Wari boundary into the Lake Titicaca area. In the Late Intermediate period, the territory known from colonial sources to be occupied by the Colla and Canas adopted similar black-on-red pottery (Rowe 1956) and the chullpa burial tradition (Sillar 2012). Meyers (2007:244-246) refers to this period of interaction somewhat confusingly as Inka I, but it was only with the expansion of the lnka as a polit­ical force out of Cuzco (which Meyers identifies as Inka II) that the cult centers devoted to Viracocha were developed for new state-sponsored rituals.

LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY (Vol. 24, No. 1, 2013
Many of the places associated with the Inka cult of Viracocha were located at major Middle Hori­zon sites, which musthave retained some of their aura from that era. The oral tradition of the Inka offers little human history to account for the con­struction or function of Wari or Tiwanaku sites, which had been abandoned some 300 to 400 years prior to Inka conquest. There is no description of a previous period of state level societies, even though Spanish officials such as Sarmiento de Gamboa (1 960 [1 S72]) inquired about this to jus­tify his argument that the Inka were recent upstarts . Yet the cult ofViracocha is associated with the sites of Tiwanaku, Isla del Sol, Raqchi (Cacha), and Wiracochan at Urcos, thus linking Tiwanaku and Wari Middle Horizon sites in the development of Inka ritual centers visited in state-sponsored pil­grimages (Bauer and Stanish 2001; Glowacki 2002; Sillar 2002, Yaeger and Lopez-Bejarano 2004), although the site of Huari itself does not become a cult site. 
The term Viracocha can be somewhat ambigu­ous; it is applied to the animating deity Contiti Viracocha and his two brothers, to the Inka ruler prior to Pachacutec, and to other people from a pre­vious era. In the Relaciones Geograficas, when describing the Wari site of Jincamocco, Monzon 's ( 196S) Antamarac Rucanas refers to "Viracochas" who made people construct buildings and roads (we would like to thank Dennis Ogburn for high­lighting this to us). Perhaps the early confusion of referring to the Spanish conquistadors as Viraco­chas is more understandable if we think of this as a descriptor from distant memories of Wari war­riors and administrators . Is it possible that when the deity Viracocha is credited with determining the origin and placement of ethnic groups, this too is a memory of the Wari state relocating people and labor? Zuidema (1973) has argued that the Wari were the original Viracochas and that the leg­end of Pachacutec 's repulsion of the Chanka was a memory of an earlier expulsion of Wari rule (Isbell and Young-Sanchez 2012: 260). By devel­oping the cult sites dedicated to the deity Vira­cocha, the Inka brought evocative memories of ancient Wari and Tiwanaku power and primordial rituals under their state control. 
Like the Wari, the Inka also had clear state poli­cies of incorporating potent and prestigious shrines and huacas from earlier periods (e.g., Bauer and Stanish 2001, Ogburn 2010). This was probably not only a policy for subjugating conquered peoples, but, like the Christian crusades in the "Holy Land," the capture of these sites was also a motivation for conquest that influenced the direction and focus of state expansion (Gose 1993). Raqchi 's significance may originate in the particularities ofKinischata's explosive origins, the natural springs, and its loca­tion in the Vilcanota valley, but it gained impor­tance through a developing history of construction and performance of rituals at the site. While the Inka may not have recounted the human history of Wari or Tiwanaku rulers, battles, or taxation systems, the myth of Viracocha shows how that history was inscribed in the landscape and retained a power and significance that the Inka state needed to engage with and make their own. This suggests a contin­uing significance of these sites through the Late Intermediate period. However, at Raqchi, like Tiwanaku (Yaeger and Lopez Bejarano 2004), the Inka moved the spatial focus for their state rituals. 
In 1864, Squier found the circular structures of R3 comparatively well preserved, and we have found Inka pottery on or near some original Wari floor surfaces, so we must assume that during the Inka period many of these structures were in a rel­atively good state of repair. It is even possible that some of the restoration work at the site was in fact undertaken by the lnka-this is likely to have been the case for the two entranceways through the north wall of the R3 enclosure, and it is likely that the threshold to collca SE was remodelled (with lnka pottery in context 216). We have found only fairly ephemeral deposits that can be securely dated to the Inka period within our excavations ofR3 (e.g., contexts 211, 216 and 219 in structure SE; 270 in 7G; 232 in lJ; and 3S2 in 121). But, if we consider all the Inka pottery recovered (primarily from within the mixed surface deposits) as a whole, the 228 sherds are characterized by a predominance of aryballos and large jars, as well as shallow plates and bowls, suggesting the serving of chi cha and the use of offering plates (Table 6). While we could interpret this as the garbage from rituals associated with the main "temple" to the north ofR3, we sug­gest that Inka rituals may also have been enacted within the ancient space that the Wari had left behind. In the Middle Horizon, R3 provided a "labor camp" as an adjunct to the elite occupation and rituals focused at Yanamancha (R8). By the

Inka period, however, R3 had become a sacred locale in its own right. 
The planning and construction of the Inka tem­ple and Yanacancha sectors (Rl) respect and incor­porate the Wari enclosure of R3 (Figure 2). Why did the Inka adopt the area next to R3 as their focus for ritual activity, though? It is possible that Wari occupation originally stretched north beyond the R3 enclosure, but as yet we have found no evidence for that. In any event, the Inka temple is located with respect to the Kinsach'ata volcano, and the spring is canalized to form a pond (R2) with clas­sic Inka baths/fountains. This suggests that lnka rit­uals focused as much on these "natural" features as the "historic" structures at R3; in fact, Inka con­cepts may not have made a distinction between natural and ancient features . The ancient huaca statue may have been relocated, and the temple's relationship to R3, the volcano, and the spring would allow pilgrims to experience this as a pow­erful pacarina, with the flat area to the east of the temple providing an arena where large crowds could assemble. 
Inka construction at Raqchi (Figure 2 and Sup­plemental Figure 1) demonstrates a scale of invest­ment in public ceremony that was quite alien to Wari state practice (although the Inka elite also indulged in smaller scale private rituals). It is like! y that rituals and ceremonies at Raqchi, located at the origin site for the Canas ethnic group, provided a mechanism through which the Inka engaged with the Canas chiefs and coordinated their role within the empire. We have highlighted Raqchi's role as a religious rather than an administrative center, but even at Inka administrative centers, where seasonal labor groups occupied more dispersed housing, the Inka used ritual and feasting as a primary focus for integration and administration (Hyslop 1990; Mor­ris and Thompson 1985). The Inka not only incor­porated local ethnic leaders in elite rituals and gift exchange, but they also supplied workers from these ethnic groups with food, drink, tools, and the spectacle of public ceremonies to justify their labor 
tax. This does not seem, however, to have involved the tight control and exclusion that characterized Wari "labor camps." Inka state policy invested in large-scale public ceremonies and an elaborate redistribution network, which managed to persuade Inka subjects to supply their labor with limited doc­umented evidence of institutional structures for coercion. It may be extreme to argue that the restricted movement and rigid organization of the enclosures at Raqchi, Pikillacta, andAzangaro echo the labor camps that the Allies, Germans, and Japanese all used to coerce labor from prisoners during the Second World War, but these structures do point to a significant difference in the economic and social structures of the Wari andlnkaEmpires, which is worthy of further investigation.
