Exchange goods contribute to social complexity and identity construction, but our knowledge of past practices associated with the circulation and consumption of such goods is limited. We explore the polished black ceramics of the San Pedro de Atacama oasis in northern Chile, which were widely traded during the .rst seven centuries A.D. In particular, we consider the relationships established between the agricultural and pastoral communities of the highland oases and the marine hunter-gatherers who inhabited the Paci.c coast in order to examine the circulation and consumption of exotics as prestige goods. 
Sabemos que en la prehistoria los bienes de intercambio contribuyeron a la complejidad social y a la construcción de identidades; sin embargo, tenemos conocimientos limitados acerca de las prácticas humanas asociadas al ciclo de la producción, circulación y consumo de este tipo de bienes. En el presente artículo analizamos artefactos que durante los primeros siete siglos de nuestra era fueron un bien de intercambio a nivel interregional: las cerámicas negras pulidas del oasis de San Pedro de Atacama, en el norte de Chile. Nos enfocamos en las relaciones establecidas entre las comunidades agrícolas y pastoriles de los oasis del Salar de Atacama y aquellas de cazadores-recolectores marinos que habitaban la costa del océano Pací.co. Indagamos el rol de los bienes de prestigio como expresión de ese sistema de preferencias simbólicas y sociales que de.ne los valores de uso, en particular aquellos relacionados con los bienes exóticos. 
F
ood and shelter are considered the most universal and basic human needs, in contrast to prestige, luxury, and leisure. This difference has given rise to the distinc­tion between practical and prestige technolo­gies (Hayden 1998). Economic anthropologists have demonstrated the limitation of this dis­tinction, noting that the usefulness of an item is determined in relation to cultural processes and social constructs (Douglas and Isherwood 1979:59; Herskovits 1952:5-6). Thus, human needs emerge from and are satis.ed by material objects endowedwithvaluebythe imperativesof culture and social order (Marx 1987 [1847]:37). This is particularly true of goods obtained throughexchange,aprocessthatin many cases 
has a high cost associated with transportation (e.g., Malinowski 2002[1922]; Renfrew 1969). 
Exchange between communities with differ­ent cultural traditions not only contributes to complexity but also is one of the processes that actively contribute to de.ning, maintaining, and appropriating culturaldifference. Resources obtained through exchange foster the .ow of cultural knowledge and practices; they enable people to understand their existence in worlds beyond thelocal orfamily group (Lazzari 2005). This allows social distinctions and commitments to be forged through ceremonial consumption: festivitiesinwhich certain actorsostentatiously handle exotic goods (e.g., Dietler and Hayden 2001;Hayden2009).

During theFormativeperiod, goods circulated over an extensive area in the Atacama Desert andbeyond. Exchange enabledtheintegrationof communitiesinhabiting northwesternArgentina, the Bolivian altiplano, the Amazon, and the forested oases of Tarapacá (Gallardo 2009; Nielsen 2013;Núñez and Dillehay1995 [1979]; Núñez et al. 2007; Yacobaccio 2012). Study of the polished black ceramics of San Pedro de Atacama can shed light on exchange, given the characteristic technological, morphological, and decorativetraitsof this pottery.This pottery is identi.ed by its thin walls; the .ne-grained granitic paste, with quartz and mica temper, which makes it hard and gives it the tendency to fracture ina regularfashion(Uribe 2004); meticulously polished or burnished surfaces; and gray to black color achieved by smoking or coating. The pottery appears in a limited repertoireofshapes(Tarragó 1989;Uribe 2006). More than 2,000 standardized vessels have been recovered from cemeteries in San Pedro. The pottery also appears as an exchange good in northwest Argentina (Jujuy and Salta), along the Bolivian-Argentinean border,onthe eastern and southern edgesof theAtacama SaltFlat,by the Copiapó River, on thePaci.c coast nearTaltal, alongthe upperand middleLoaRiver,inthe oasis of Chiu Chiu, and at Caserones in theTarapacá Ravine (Capdeville 1928; Fernández 1978;Le Paige 1972–73;Niemeyer and Cervellino1985; Núñez 1982,2005;Oyarzún1934;Sinclaire et al. 1997;Tarragó1996).Recent studies indicatethat the marine hunter-gatherers of the Antofagasta coast were part of this same interregional net­work, and polished black ceramics are found along trade routes connecting San Pedrowith the coast(Figure1). 
Two phases have been de.ned for this pot­tery: Sequítor(A.D. 100–400) and Quítor(A.D. 400–700). The temporal ranges of the two phases were .rst identi.edby cross-datingother

artifacts present in funerary contexts and later supportedthroughextensiveand systematic ther­moluminescence dating(Berenguer et al. 1986; Tarragó1989). Nevertheless, recent radiocarbon dates have raised doubts about chronology, and so we describe the pottery as belonging to a single period (Stovel 2013). On the Antofa­gasta coast, burial patterns were constant for the .rst eight centuries of our era, support­ingthistemporal simpli.cation(Ballester and Clarot 2014). 
The study of exchange has concentrated on leaders, power,and social complexity (e.g., Ren­frew 1984; Webb 1974), including research in the Atacama Desert (e.g., Llagostera 2006a; Stovel 2005). In contrast, we examine the cir­culation and consumptionof exotic goods found in archaeological contexts with the objective of describing their value with particular reference to oasis-coast exchange. 


SanPedrodeAtacama as a 
ProductionCenter 

Around 500 B.C., the inhabitants of the oasis of San Pedro de Atacama adopted a village-based lifestyle that originated in the highland ravines where huntingwild camelids, early herd­ing, and the extraction of mineral resources led to the emergence of a sedentary way of life and theintensi.cation ofproduction. This pro­cessgreatlyexpanded with theincorporationof wild fruits (algarrobo[Prosopis sp.] and chañar [Geoffroea decorticans]) into the diet and the adoptionof horticulture (Agüero 2005;Agüero and Uribe 2011; Llagostera and Costa 1999; Núñez 2005). 
At this timethe .rst polished black (and also red, known as Toconao) ceramics were made, beginning a ceramic tradition that lasted until the end of theMiddle period, around A.D. 700 (Berenguer et al. 1986; Tarragó 1989;Uribe 2006). Artisanalwork ledtothe standardization of ceramic paste and forms(Stovel 2005). Sur­plus productionallowedtradeoveranextensive geographic area. Coastal groups of the For­mative period traded their own goods for this pottery,suchas shellinstrumentsand adornments (made of several species of clams, scallops, Argopecten purpuratus,conch,Oliva peruviana, and Littorina peruviana). Fishvertebrae arealso found in the oasis (Agüero 2005; Agüero and Uribe 2011;Llagosteraetal.1984;Núñez2005). 
Beginning in the 1960s, Myriam Tarragó has worked to systematize polished black Ata­cameño ceramics, identifying 14 forms from 1,929 pieces found at 14 different prehispanic cemeteries(Tarragó 1989:519).These ceramics are concentratedinthe upper reaches of the San PedroandVilamaRivers, whereindividualswere accompanied by a greater numbers of vessels (Figure2). According toTarragó, wholooked for patternsintheburials, the early assemblages show an association of polished black cups, bottles, and serving dishes with polished red bottles. The early dateoftheseassociated forms was supported by an independent program of thermoluminescence dating (Berenguer et al. 1986). 
The Séquitor phase is dated to A.D. 100 to 400, at the end of the Formative period. This phase is characterized by the .rst appearance of polychrome baskets, tembetá lip ornaments, stone axes and mallets, and malachite beads in burials. Polished gray or reddish ceramic pipes, usually angled, also datetothis period, although they have been identi.ed earlier, in the Con­dorhuasi and Candelaria cultures of northwest Argentina. Also appearing duringthisera arethe .rst wooden snuff tablets used for consuming hallucinogenic substances (Tarragó 1989) and copper artifacts such as plates and bracelets (Mayer 1986).The polished black ceramic pieces from this phase tend to be cups, globular or cone-shaped bowls, or double-handled jugs with lifelikefaces molded on their necks(Figure3). These are commonly found in tombs accom­panied by polished red ceramics, and very fre­quently with large amphorae. Foreign pottery of this period includes Vaquería, Ciénaga, and Condorhuasi ceramics from northwestArgentina (Stovel2008;Tarragó1989). 
The Quítor phase dates from A.D. 400 to 700 and is characterized by high-quality local and foreign craftwork. Wooden hallucinogenic tablets are very common and appear in a variety of shapes and decorative styles. Finely carved wooden items such as tubes, spoons, and mor­tars areabundant andhave anextensiveicono­graphicrepertoirethat includesTiwanaku motifs

(Llagostera 2006b;Torres and Repke2006).Typ­ical of this phase are the shells of the terrestrial snail Sthrophocheilus oblongus (Téllez 1997). The sophisticated craftwork exhibited in this periodalsoextendstobody ornamentsandawide variety of metal objects such as bronze axes, maces, and chisels.Copper ore bead necklaces also are abundant and a wide variety of textiles are known (Lindberg 1963). 
The burnished black ceramics of the Quítor periodare beautifully made.Newformsof cups and wide-bodied bowls with narrow mouths and bases became popular.Thefaces decoratingthe necksof bottlesare more stylized than duringthe previous phase(Figure3;Tarragó 1989). Bur­nished black pottery rarely appearswith polished red pieces, but Bolivian highland and north­west Argentinean ceramics are found, including someTiwanaku-likeforms (Stovel 2008;Tarragó 1989). 
Radiocarbon assayshavechallengedtheexist­ing chronology (Stovel 2013;Torres-Rouff and Hubbe 2013).Itwaspreviously thought that red polished bottles were made in an earlier period (Toconao phase, 300 B.C.–A.D. 100),but dates indicatethat red polished bottlesmayhave been

produced during the .rst seven centuries A.D. (Stovel2013). This problem may apply to sites and contexts we have dated along routes to the coast(Figure4). Thus, we need more in-depth studiesofthe chronologyofSanPedroblackpol­ished ceramic types.For this reason, we consider polished black ceramics to belong to a single, long phase. Moreover, given the wide variety of shapes in the Tarragó typology and prob­lems withworkingmainlywith sherds,wehave reduced formal classi.cation to nine morpho­functional groups calledG1toG9(Figure5). 


CoastalSites 
The desert coast of the Antofagasta region has very high marine resource productivity and has supported specialized hunter-gatherer commu­nities since at least 10,000 B.P. (Llagostera 2005). Remains there span all prehistoric peri­ods,including numerous remarkable cemeteries dating back to theFormative period. These con­tain tombswith circular moundsseveralmetersin diameter risingameter aboveground(Figure6). The cemeteries contain fromafew dozentosev­eral hundred tumuli (Ballester and Clarot 2014). 
All the cemeteries have been looted, but a signi.cant portionofnon-metallic artifactshave been left behind. For example, during excava­tionsoftwo cemeteriesatthe mouthoftheLoa River, 113burial mounds wereexamined. Eight complete and 35 partial vessels were recovered (see Spahni 1967). Pottery is scarce but reg­ularly present in the domestic middens of the Antofagasta coast, suggesting that vessels were preserved with special interest (Bittman 1984; Bravo1981).This indicates that pottery had great symbolic and social value. 
North Coast Study Area 
We have identi.ed 13 looted cemeteries north and south of the mouth of the Loa River that comprise more than 700 burial mounds. They dateto about 400 B.C.–A.D. 700 (Núñez 1976a; Núñez and Santoro 2011). Our recent work at three sites yielded fragments of numerous artifacts, including black polished Atacameño sherds.

The AMS date of a plant-.ber mat we recov­ered is 1580 ± 30 B.P. (Beta 360553; d13C = -23.8‰)or 430–591 cal A.D. (2s ;p = 0.99), consistent with ceramics and other materials collected on thesurface. Thesite seemstohave been used over a long period. 
We found a similar variety and number of black polished Séquitorbeakersandbowlsatthe Caleta Huelén7cemetery, located some 400m south ofCaH10(Figure7g–h).This site was excavatedbyNúñez(1971, 1976a), whofound some intact graves containing plant-.ber mats, polished bottles, truncated cone-shaped bowls, copper ore, marine artifacts, baskets,thick cords, knotted plant-.ber bags, cotton, gourds, quartz knives, and camelidwool.Adate obtained from amixed sampleofplant .bersandbasketsis2030 ± 80 B.P. (IVIC 788; Núñez 1976a:88;Tamers 1973:310)or397cal B.C.to53cal A.D.(2s ;p = 0.99).2 Ourinvestigationrevealsthat the bodies were buried in overlapping layers, forming a dense burial mound 20 m in diameter and just over 1 m high. We collected artifacts from the surface of no more than 20 percent of the site. Theseinclude copper laminae,wooden darts and harpoons, cactus-thorn .shhooks, and several multicolored textile fragments, one of whichis clearlyTiwanakuin style.Asmall sampleof this textile yieldsanAMSageof1450 ±30B.P. (Beta 360552; textile; d13C=-19.9‰),oracalibrated interval of 594–673 cal A.D. (2s ;p =0.99). 
Some 3 km south of these two sites is the cemetery of Caleta Huelén 20. There we collected fragments of a black polished Ata­cameño bottle and bowl. Some 150 mounds with clear evidence of recent looting are still visible. Spahni (1967) excavated 81 of these mounds. His collections reveal that the popu­lation possessed technologies for exploiting the marineenvironmentandalsohad accesstogoods fromthe inland oases,including ceramics(LCA and, toalesserextent,QTC and QRP),textiles, wood, copper metal and ore, and stone. Years later, Núñez(1971)excavatedthe same site with similarresults. Spahni obtained an absolute date of 1735 ± 100 B.P. (HV 557; Geyh 1967:207; Spahni 1967:239) for charred human bone,but

we knowthesegroups mostly consumed marine resources, so their remains should re.ect the marine reservoir effect (e.g., Sveinbjörnsdóttir et al. 2010). When calibrated, the dateyieldsa temporal interval of 29 cal B.C.–970 cal A.D. (2s ; p = 0.99) and 220–709 cal A.D. (1s ; p = 0.97).3 This is roughly consistent with other dates formound cemeteriesinthe region and the materials we collected from the surface (2percentofthetotalsite),although earlierdates are possiblefor other tombs. 
Available data therefore suggest that some of these cemeterieswere contemporary. Perhaps our most important conclusionisthe undeniable connectionwith theinlandfarming and pastoral groups of the oases. The cemeteries contained monochrome(LCA and QTC) and polished red (QRP) ceramics from the Formative period of Tarapacá as well as fragments of tunics and headdresses from the same region. They also contained Tiwanaku polychrome textiles and instruments made of stone available only in the deep desert (Blanco 2013; Blanco et al. 2010), dart and harpoon shafts made of wood from the Loa River valley, and polished black ceramics from San Pedro de Atacama. These

handcrafted items and rawmaterials were almost certainly obtained from the oasis of Quillagua, about 45 km upriver, where contemporary sites have similarartifacts(e.g.,Agüeroet al. 2006; Gallardo et al. 1993). This oasis operated as a node through which multiple routes converged, connectingGuatacondo and theTarapacáRavine to the north with Calama and the San Pedrode Atacama oasis in the south. 
South Coast Study Area 
Marine hunter-gatherers who lived between the Mejillones PeninsulaandTocopillahad accessto materials characteristic of the Tarapacá region. In contrast,theirrelations with peopleofthe Loa rivermouthwas quitedifferent.Inthatregion,we registered 37 cemeteries containing more than 600 lootedbutidenti.ablemounds. 
This strip of desert coast was occupied by humans from the early Archaic period onward, no doubt because of the presence of freshwater springs, many sheltered harbors, and extensive rocky shorelines that were home to abundant plant and animalresources.AtGualagualaCove, weregistered residentialandburialsitesdatingas farback as thelateArchaic. More thanahundred mounds thereare foundingroupsofvaryingsizes corresponding to different eras. Unfortunately, looters left very few materials. Several radio­carbon dates indicatethat themound cemeteries were used between 500 B.C. and A.D. 900 (Ballester and Clarot 2014:36).Onlytwo groups have yielded fragments of black polished San PedrodeAtacama ceramics. 
A fragment of a black polished, truncated, cone-shaped bowl wasdiscovered atMichilla 2. Thisisa cemeteryofaround40 mounds;20per­cent of its surface area has been destroyed. The scant remainsrecovered here (from40 percentof theburial units)indicatethat theinhabitantsused .shing net weights and possessedstone and shell technologies for hunting and processing marine animals. We also recovered a copper lamina and .shhook, a few camelid hair .bers, small fragmentsofbasketry,algarrobo seeds,and bird, .sh,and whale bones.The ceramicsthat aremost commonly found here are of Tarapacá origin (LCA and QTC). We date one mound to 114– 249 cal A.D. (2s ;p =0.99; Beta 322287; 1870 ±30 B.P.,plant material; d13C=-22.29‰)and 
a second to 223–367 cal A.D. (2s ; p = 0.99; Beta 322288; 1790 ±30 B.P.; d13C=-19.8‰).

Thisis asmall site witharingof17mounds surrounding an area thatiscompletelydisturbed.

(Beta 322285; plant material; d13C =-22.5‰), or 198–340 cal A.D. (2s ; p = 0.83), and 1600 ± 30 B.P. (Beta 322286; plant material; d13C = -10.8‰), or 423–576 cal A.D. (2s ;p =0.99). 
Recent archaeological salvage operations at the Mejillones Peninsula and Antofagasta Bay have yielded San Pedroblack polished ceramics from relatively undisturbed contexts. At Las Loberasonthe peninsula,Mavrakis(2003)stud­ied three mounds disturbed by motorized vehi­cles. In one of them, he recovered the body of an elderly male whose grave goods included a truncated cone-shaped bowl in the black pol­ished Séquitorstyle(Figure7e).The contextalso included cotton .shing line, camelid-.ber ropes, harpoon heads, kniveswith handles,plant-.ber net bags and bundles, ceramics typical of the Tarapacá region (QTC), harpoon shafts or oar bodies, cactus .shhooks, knives made of mus­selshells,birdskins, camelid-hairtextiles, and baskets decorated with symbolsfrom northwest Argentina.Asampletaken froma.eckof natural cottonyieldedaradiocarbon dateof1370 ±30

A.nal discoveryattheVertederosite,located in the city dump of Antofagasta, revealed an extraordinary deposit of polished San Pedrode Atacama ceramics(Ballester and Clarot 2014). There, heavy machinery uncovered seven tombs containing grave goods typical of coastal popu­lations,includingTarapacá-associated ceramics (LCA), necklaces and bracelets with seashell beads, bone harpoon heads, large stone knives with handles, tools made of sea lion ribs, and other tools made of copper laminae. What is truly surprising is the quantity and variety of goodsfrom distantplacesintheAtacamaDesert. Among these are the inverted T-shaped pipes

of theElMolle culture.These couldhave been obtained through coastal trading with groups residing on the Taltal coast, where such items arefrequently foundin mound cemeteries.Even more remarkable are the pieces that must have come fromthe oasisof San PedrodeAtacama. These include two polished bottles with dec­orated necks, a black polished beaker and a bottle with a sub-globular neck(Figure7a–d), and a small ceramic container for holding lime. Other items include two modeled tablets used for consuming hallucinogens, copper ore beads, a small wooden mortar, a freshwater shell(S. oblongus)from northwestArgentinausedtohold redpigment, anda ceramic item fromthe same region. Thesetypesof artifactsare usually dated to theQuítor phase, when there was increased circulationofsuchgoodsatthe oases (Berenguer and Dauelsberg 1989). 


Routesfrom SanPedrodeAtacamatothe 
NorthAntofagasta Coast 

Black polished ceramics made in the oasis of San Pedro were traded to northwest Argentina, thePaci.c coast,theLoaRivervalley, southern Bolivia, and the Tarapacá region (e.g., Nielsen 2006;Núñezetal.2003;Pimentel2013;Tarragó 1989). Such trade couldhave been conductedby local agents from San Pedro, by other groups capableoflong-distance transport andexchange, or—most likely—by both. Most oasis commu­nities had their own cargo animals. We also must consider that coastal groups could have traded the pottery because they made regular incursions into the desert(Knudson et al. 2012), although thesetrips were much shorterthan trips to the highlands, which could be hundreds of kilometers (Gallardo 2013). 
Evidence for caravan traf.c from San Pedro de Atacama and other oases into the desert dates back to thelateArchaic and earlyFormativeperi­ods (Núñez 1992; Núñez et al. 2007). Caravan traders would have had specialized knowledge of transportationroutes (including rest stops and resupply areas in the desert), skill in handling camelid herds, and experience interacting with other peoples.Theserelations couldhave been passed on and renewed from generation to gen­eration. 
Theprehispanictrails that connected the oasis of San Pedro to the Antofagasta coast, which stretched from the location of the present-day city to the mouth of the Loa River, formed a network that branched out considerably near the Paci.c(Figure1).Ourinvestigations along these routes have recoveredblack polished San Pedro ceramics, indicatingthat potterywastransported tovarious locations inhabitedby marine hunter-gatherers. People traveled to the Paci.c along trails that passed through inhabited regions and sites such as Calama and Quillagua, which mayhave actedasdown-the-lineintermediaries. Other, more direct trails ran through the open desert. One such route appears on old maps (San Román 1902),butwehave not inspected it. Nonetheless, theAtacameño artifactsdiscovered atElVertederosupport its ancient use.Travelers from San Pedro also could have ventured on a more direct routetothe coastthat passedthrough the ancient rest stop of Huacate, where black polished ceramics have been found. If so, they couldhavestoppedatthe freshwaterspringsof Agua Dulce and Los Ratones, both fed by the Sierra Gorda aquifer. 
Two major routes connected San Pedro to Calama, another settled oasis where polished black ceramicshave been found. From Calama, the paths branched out in different directions to the coast.Togo betweenSan Pedroand Calama, 90 km distant and at the same altitude, travelers wouldhaveascendedto 3,400maslto crossthe Cordillera de Domeyko. There are two possible routes: one to thesouththat passedbythe spring of PurilactiandtheotherovertheCerrosdeTuina range, whereAguada de laTeca is located. The .rst route passedthroughaprehistoric rest stop where use by Atacameño people has been dated to theFormative period. Also found thereisrock artwith iconographyfrom northwestArgentina. This suggestsusebytravelersofdifferentorigins and cultures(Cartajena and Núñez 2010).Similar discoveries have been made along the route to Tuina, a journey made possible by the small freshwater spring of La Teca, situated around 40 km from the Calama oasis (Núñez et al. 1997). 
From Calama, the trails where polished Ata­cameño ceramics have been found bifurcate to the west and north. The western route ran

between the Loa River and San Salvador in the direction of the historic staging posts of Huacate, Miscanti, and Chacance, from whence thewestern routedividedto reach .shingcoves southofthe portofTocopilla.Inthe .rst segment of this trail, Atacameño sherds have been found alongsidethe trail(Figure7i).From Miscanti, a branching trail runs to the .shing coves of Tamesand Michilla.Several sherdsofSan Pedro beakers,bowls,and bottleswith decorated necks havebeen discovered. Thesehavebeen recovered near the modern San Martín saltpeter mine from simple enclosures used as resting places and fromthe tombsoftravelersburied along theway (Figure7j–n; Castellón 1985). Further west on this trail,wehavedocumentedthesame ceramics inaseriesofsmall, smooth,oval-shaped depres­sions associated with small-stone alignments (Figure8).To the north, another major route winds towardthe coast fromChacance on theLoa RiverthroughPampadeTupiza. There, wehave found black polished sherdsat similartemporary residential sites and burial grounds, some of which have hundreds of small-stone parallel alignments and .gurative depictions made of the same sort,similarto geoglyph rock art(Núñez 1976b;Pimentel2009). 
One of the most demanding routes to the Paci.c runs fromthe Quillagua oasis.Between Calama and Quillagua there is a 110 km trail through the desert that is exposed to high solarradiation and strong winds.The freshwater spring of Chug Chug, about halfway along this route, offers foot travelers and their animals a much-needed rest stop. The abundant forest resourcesof Quillagua supportedalargepopula­tionfromatleastthe .rst millennium B.C., and manyof its residentialsites and cemeterieshave yielded fragments of black polished ceramics from the Atacama Salt Flat. Nonetheless, it is at Ancachi, several kilometers downriver along the Loa, where we have recovered the greatest quantityof polished black sherds.Itislikelythat Atacameño ceramicsweretransportedfromthere to coastal campsattheriver mouthalonga60km trail winding through the coastal range. This trailwas used intensively duringtheFormative period, as attested by the tombs, ceremonial mounds, and simple shelters along the route. Just as people and animals came down from the inland regions to the coast, marine hunter-gatherers went inland into the desert to gather wood, stones, minerals, and plants. Burial sites foundalongtheroute contain adultsand children, demonstratingthatfamiliessometimes made this trip (Torres-Rouff et al. 2012). 
Archaeological studies conducted between the historic rest stop of Calate and the mouth of the Loa River also have revealed ancient residential camps withalong occupational his­tory (Pimentel 2009;Pimentel et al.2011). The excavationof one such dwellingwestofCalate revealed four stratigraphic layers, including an Archaic base layer and two intermediate ones

Discussion 
The route de.ned by .nds of black polished ceramics south of Tocopilla was likely used by travelers and pack animals coming from the Atacama Salt Flat. Given the multiplicity of destinations and recipients on the coast, the travelers must have been from different family units. If trade at this early time was predomi­nantly based on personal relationships, then the mode of exchange was simpler than those of altiplano states described in the early colonial literature (e.g., Gallardo 2013). We have not determined theintensity of traf.c to thePaci.c, but discoveries of Atacameño ceramics along the route and on the coast suggest that this was a small-scale activity carried out over nearly seven centuries. The movement of goods no doubt included other craft products, as attested by discoveries at LasLoberas andVertederode Antofagasta.The enormous logisticalinvestment of thesejourneys and thefact that theyoccurred repeatedlyover timeimply that thesereciprocal exchanges were highly valued. 
All forms of polished black vessels were exchanged, even rare groups such as Tarragó (Figure5); thus we conclude that allwerepro­ducedas surplusinexcessoflocal demandatSan PedrodeAtacama. The pottery has been found in numerous tombs and residential sites in the production zone, indicating common and daily use. Nevertheless, polished black vessels also were highly valued as objects of long-distance exchange, which bestowed identity on local consumers(Stovel2005;Stovel and Echeñique 2015). We believe that ceramics of this kind were redistributedwithinthe oases,apracticenot replicated with marine products, which scarcely appear in residences or as grave goods.Access to marine resources,therefore, mayhave beena markof social distinctioninthe salt .at. 
The limited consumption of exotic goods at San PedrodeAtacama, their conservation, and thehighlaborinvestment requiredtoobtainthem makeitcertainthattheseproductshadarelatively high value. Thus, we hypothesize that those who had accesstolong-distanceexchange were privileged. Theseindividuals knewthe trails and their clients and maintained control over the balance of exchange. Such trading partnerships are also expressed in the Andes (Heider 1969; Mayer 2004). The greatest wealth of traders lies not in the materials exchanged but in the knowledgeand interculturaltiestheyacquireand maintain. 
Black polished ceramicswereusedwidelyin San PedrodeAtacama,buttheiruse on the coast was limited. Individualsburiedwith Atacameño ceramicsonthe coast had diets characterizedby a preponderance of coastal foods (Pestle et al. 2015). Some early Atacameño vessels found in coastalburials were repaired, suggestingthehigh value of the pottery. It has aesthetic attributes radically different from local ceramics(LCA and QTC),which arerougher and more sparsely dec­orated. Nonetheless, local potterywaspreferred for daily use. For marine hunter-gatherers, the utilitarian qualities of local ceramics (vessels with necksbut no handles,veryregularin shape in the case ofLCA and with thick walls, coarse surfaces, and weak walls in the case ofQTC) satis.ed cultural imperatives. In contrast, the enormously different ceramicsofthe San Pedro oasis—with their variety of shapes, thin walls, polished surfaces, and .nely .nished handles and edges—clearly werevalued fortheirdistinctive appearanceandexotic nature.Therarityof black polished ceramicsincoastal cemeteriesindicates that only a few individuals had access to these objects. We argue that although their aesthetic

properties were highly valued, possession also implied an entire set of practices, including culinary knowledge, associated witha particular group of individuals. 


Conclusion 
Thevaluesof goods arerelativeinevery formof reciprocalexchangebut become absolutewhen the goods are consumed. Rare or exotic items can confer social status on those who are able to possess or redistribute them. In the case of exchange between San Pedro de Atacama and thePaci.c coast, the oasis inhabitants had llamas and therefore couldtransportlarger quantitiesof goods to the coast than marine hunter-gatherers could carry to the highlands. This imbalance provided an advantage to theAtacameños,but the distances theytraveled, traf.cking logistics, and stressonlivestock signi.cantlyaffected transport costs.Thus,down-the-line ordirect trade from the oasis was more onerous than the simple, human-powered mode of the marine hunter­gathererswho journeyed inlandtowardthe desert oases. 
The marine hunter-gatherers of the coast transformed some of the resources available to them into goods that had exchange value: dried .sh and seashells used as instruments, contain­ers, and ornaments. Theinland agricultural and pastoralgroups,for their part, contributed ceram­ics, yarn, textiles, wooden objects, stone beads, and probably copper metal for smelting, all of which were produced by skilled crafters. This points to a .nal dissimilarity. Coastal products were comparatively simple to manufacture and made of abundant materials. In contrast, exotic ceramics and woven cloth found on the coast were repeatedly repaired rather than replaced (Cases et al. 2008). Conservationindicates that these werehighly valued. 
Thus, .ne black polished ceramics were highly prized by the marine hunter-gatherers of the northern Chilean coast. Nonetheless, seashells had great ceremonial value in the highlands (where they were needed for group ritual) and dried .sh was another highly sought­afterresource (Bresson 1875;Philippi1860).A late nineteenth-centurydictionaryofKunza, the nativelanguageof theAtacamasalt .at spoken at that time, offers a double translation for the local word ckacktchi: something that is good, pleasant, tasty, and also simply “.sh” (Vaïsse et al. 1896:16).Thisrelativelyrecent attribution of value encapsulates the desire for goods that required substantial investments of energy to transport fromthePaci.c coast.

Notes 
1. 
Allradiocarbon dates are calibrated using SHCAL13 Southern Hemisphere Calibration (Hogg et al. 2013;cf. Reimeret al. 2013), with Calib 7.0.2Software(Stuiverand Reimer 1993). Calibration data are presented in Figure4, except for IVIC 790, which is subject to the “old wood” problem.Other assays presented here arederived fromtree twigsand employthemuchmorepreciseAMS technique. 

2. 
IVIC 788 was not originally corrected for isotopic fractionation. The sample comes from a basket made of freshwater plants,soweassumea fractionationvalueof–16 ±4‰ (http://calib.qub.ac.uk/calib/manual/chapter5.html). Thecorrected ageis 2178 ±103 B.P. 

3. 
To calibrate this assay, we use the Mixed Marine Southern Hemisphere Curve, assume 70 percent marine carbon, a mean ,R =196 ±127 (Ortlieb et al. 2011), and a sample lifespan of 14 years (the median between the extremes for the collagen turnover time in humans; Sveinbjörnsdóttiretal. 2010:683).Isotopic fractionationalso may limit the accuracy of this date, and we estimate it as d13C =-12 ±2‰ (reference for bone apatite listed at www.c14dating.com/isotope.html).Ourresultis1948±105 


B.P. Yet another source of ambiguity is the likelihood of additionalvariance for GPC Laboratories (Scott et al. 1998). In Figure4,thisinaccuracyis easily spotted. 
4. Figure4 displaystwo additional dates, from other structuresand layersatthe site, that are laterbut within the middleFormative asexpected.
