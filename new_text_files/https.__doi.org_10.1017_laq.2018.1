A
nthropological interpretation of archeo­logical materials can be a tricky busi­ness, particularly when such interpreta­tions attempt to vicariously access the emotional states and embodied experiences of individuals who lived in cultural and temporal contexts far removed from our own. Nevertheless, in recent years a variety of analytical approaches have demonstrated their effectiveness in offering nuanced glimpses into the lived experience of ancient peoples (Houston 2001; 
Joyce 
2005; 
Lock and Farquhar 2007;Tiesler 
2014). 
In 
that 
vein, we argue that the postures and gestures of dancing .gures depicted in Classic Maya art offer entry into their innermost emotional states when interpreted as semiotic indices. 
Our analysis focuses on the postural and gestural vocabularies that characterize the dances of the Maize God and those of the wahy beings that inhabit the underworld. Methodologically, our examination rests primarily on iconographic depictions of dance found on Late Classic poly­chrome ceramics originating in the Maya Low­lands (Boot 2003; 
Looper 
2009; 
Reents-Budet 
1994; 
Robicsek 
and 
Hales 
1981). 
We 
use 
Laban 
movement analysis (LMA) as a methodological platform to describe various postural attitudes depicted in scenes of dance, then turn to Peircean semiotic theory to explore their potential indexi­cal qualities. Because neither of these particular analytical tools have gained widespread traction among students of the ancient Maya, we begin

Peircean Semiotic Theory 
When discussing semiotic theory, clari.cation is needed as to precisely which branch of semiotics is referenced. Confusingly, two unrelated forms of semiotic theory arose in the nineteenth cen­tury, and both have maintained a foothold in the .elds of archaeology and anthropology. The .rst came courtesy of the Swiss linguist Ferdinand de Saussure, who established the .eld of semiology (sémiologie), “a science that studies the life of signs within society” (Saussure 1966:16 
[1916]). 
The second was developed independently by the American polymath Charles Sanders Peirce, which he dubbed “a science of semeiotic” (Peirce 1998:482). 
The 
Peircean 
model 
presents 
a sweeping phenomenological approach that is rooted in categories of signs, which is con­ducive to anthropological interpretation. Preucel (2006:3–4) 
highlighted 
the 
inadequacies 
of 
the 
Saussurian model for adducing meaning from material culture and strongly encouraged archae­ologists to embrace a Peircean semiotic approach instead. 
In 
Peirce’s 
(1992 
[1894]) taxonomy of sign-forms there are three predominant modes of signs: icon, index, and symbol. These classes of signs overlap and are not mutually exclusive. A single sign, for example, might be an icon, a symbol, and an index simultaneously (Chandler 2002:43). 
Icons 
function by resembling that which is represented. Indices refer to their object via a relationship in time and space. Symbols are arbitrary; they refer to their object by means of convention, such as .ags or traf.c lights. To illustrate, an icon of a mouse would be a drawing meant to resemble a mouse. A symbol of mouse would be the word “mouse.” An index of a mouse would be the “Eek!” sound emitted by a person startled by seeing one. An indexical sign re.ects a causal relationship, one of indication, such as smoke for .re, or a broad smile indicating someone is happy. It is the index, as a sign type, with which we are most concerned throughout this paper. 
The application of Peircean semiotics to the interpretation of archaeological materials is a fairly recent phenomenon, but it has proven effective and enlightening (Hutson et al. 2012; 
Preucel 2006; 
Preucel 
and 
Bauer 
2001). 
Carballo 
(2014:197) 
highlights 
the 
utility 
of 
semiotics 
in 
archaeology but notes that the notion of indices is “particularly valuable for studying ritual as a form of differential communication saturated with signs and generated through performance.” In Mesoamerica generally and among the Maya speci.cally, the body itself “is a key symbol and a transmitter of social information through its artistic depiction, spatial positioning, and metaphorical reference” (Palka 2002:420). 
Such 
culturally speci.c metaphors have the power to shape the way individuals experience the world in very real ways (Lakoff and Johnson 1980). 
Maya art often uses a “non-verbal vocabulary of gesture” that enables emotions and attitudes to be expressed without words (Eisner 1990:100). 
Although some elements of this gestural vocabu­lary transcend cultural barriers, others appear to be speci.c to the Classic Maya (Wichmann and Nielsen 2016:301). 

Comparatively few archaeologists have em­braced semiotic interpretations, which Hutson and 
colleagues 
(2012:298) 
suggest 
may 
be 
due 
to 
wariness in the .eld of what may seem like yet another jargon-.lled theoretical trend (see also Chippindale 1993). 
We 
echo 
the 
authors’ 
asser­
tion that semiotic theory is neither a passing trend nor an uneasy .t between “exotic theory and local data” (Hutson et al. 2012:298), 
but 
rather 
a powerful and broadly applicable interpretive tool. 
Although the artistic conventions surrounding Classic Maya dance may serve as indexical markers of the context in which a particular scene was produced (Looper 2009:104), 
the 
nature 
of 
signs is polysemous–they may point to more than one meaning at a time. Our particular focus on indexicality follows the lead of a handful of Mesoamerican scholars. To highlight just a few, 
Hutson 
et 
al. 
(2012:207) 
interpret 
sacbes in the Yucatan as indices of inclusion by virtue of the physical connectedness they create between center 
and 
periphery. 
Baron’s 
(2016) 
recent 
book 
explores, among other things, the indexical link­ages between patron gods and local identity for­mation. 
Hendon 
(2009:224–225) 
argues 
that 
the 
hachas and yokes curated in a noble home at Late

Classic Copan (Group 9N-8 Patio A) served as indexical markers of “foreignness,” even if those who donned them were in fact local and only assumed a “foreign” identity for ritual purposes. Hendon 
and 
coauthors 
(2014:47) 
explore the iconic aspects of animal .gures that commonly appear on polychrome vessels in the Ulúa Valley, which also served as indexical markers of local identities when preferences for speci.c animals arose in different subregions; furthermore, they note that the general uniformity of Ulúa Poly­chromes served to index the shared knowledge of a larger cultural tradition (Hendon et al. 2014). 
Joyce’s 
(2014:17) 
semiotic 
analysis 
of 
the 
Playa 
de los Muertos .gurines from Middle Formative Honduras suggests the twined and woven textiles represented on the .gurines “would have index­ically invoked assessments of the skill and labor required to make objects such as .ne plain-weave cloth and complex twined textiles.” 


Laban Movement Analysis 
Rudolf Laban (1879–1958) developed his the­ories and descriptive systems of movement out of an express desire to help spectators not only understand but truly experience the same emotional state as the performers they observe (Burton et al. 2016:28; 
Laban 
1972). 
His 
system 
enables a close reading of the posture, gesture, and movement vocabularies of the human body. Bartenieff 
and 
Lewis 
(1980:16) 
suggested 
three 
ways in which Laban analysis could be used: the study of “body structure and morphology;” the pathways and “spatial tension” of movements; and 
the 
study 
of 
Effort1, 
which 
refers 
to 
the 
postural attitudes of an individual “in relation to space, weight, time, and .ow.” Each of the Effort elements are de.ned diametrically: Space Effort is either Direct or Indirect, Weight Effort is Strong or Light, Time Effort can be Sudden or Sustained, and Flow Effort is either Free or Bound. In Laban’s calculus, when two of these Effort factors are combined they constitute a state2. 
When 
three 
of 
the 
Effort 
factors 
combine, 
they constitute a drive3. 

It is the Effort qualities that are of particu­lar interest to this study. Bartenieff and Lewis (1980:59) 
note 
that 
“a 
variety 
of 
inner 
states 
can 
be described in the movement manifestations of two Effort combinations.” That is, the states and drives of LMA, by design, reveal inner emotional states. For example, there is little difference in the qualities of Space and Time between someone violently punching their hand forward vs. lightly “.st bumping” a friend—each is of the same duration and moves in the same direction— but the Effort quality of the two motions is dramatically different. One is Strong, the other Light. The former might register as an expression of anger or frustration, but the latter is understood to be a friendly af.rmation or greeting. We argue that such Effort qualities can be detected in Classic period depictions of dance. 
Anthropological studies of dance have gener­ally examined movement, posture, and gesture as icons (Downey 2005;Ness 
2004;Srinivasan 
2007). 
Among 
the 
Maya, 
for 
example, 
scholars 
have suggested that dances are mimetic in that they replicate “the sway of maize” (Looper 1991:54), 
the 
“motions 
of 
animals” 
(Houston 
et al. 2006:255), 
or 
the 
.ight 
of 
birds 
(Taube 
2009:46). 
Although 
proper 
identi.cation 
of 
the 
iconic mode of these dances is crucial to our interpretations, the study of other types of sign making in dance processes can amplify our over­all understanding of them (Lemos 2012). 
Ness 
(1992) 
pioneered 
the 
application 
of Peircean semiotic theory to the .eld of dance ethnogra­phy. She found that semiotic indices pointed to “something else also present or evident in the per­formance context” (Ness 2008:8), 
which 
might 
include signs of trance (indexed by shaking, shiv­ering, eye rolling), or a drunk person’s weaving walk—an index of the fact that the person is inebriated. Not only is dance representative, it is also indicative. 
We are mindful of the objections that may be raised in our effort to adduce meaning from ide­alized, static, two-dimensional images of dance produced by artists who are far removed from us temporally and culturally (see Looper 2009:103– 
106). Complicating the matter further, we lack provenience for a large percentage of these Clas­sic period ceramics because they were wrested from their original context by looters, leaving us to cobble together clues from disparate datasets (Reents-Budet 1998:82). 
Art 
historians 
caution 
that there may be a disconnect between the intended meaning as expressed by a particular

performer and the message as conveyed by the artist depicting the performance, and yet another disconnect between the artist’s depiction and meaning ascribed by observers who view art­work through different cultural lenses (Gombrich 1999:272). 
Although 
this 
certainly 
holds 
true 
for 
us in our examination of ancient Maya art, such divisions between performer, artist, and viewer may have been less pronounced in their original context. Late Classic polychrome ceramics were indisputably elite objects: elite artists depicted elite performers on vessels created exclusively for elite consumption (Reents-Budet 1998:78; 
Rice 2009; 
see also Wichmann and Nielsen 2016:307). 
Hidden 
from 
the 
gaze 
of 
the 
com­
moners, these relatively small works would have required close proximity for interpretation (see Joyce 2014:74), 
much 
like 
the 
scenes 
of 
dance 
carved into the panels and lintels in the walls of temples and palaces, with access limited to elites. 
Concerning our ability to detect emotional states from ancient works of art, Houston (2001:207) 
noted 
that 
Classic 
Maya 
depictions 
of the body are “unusually expressive, with a degree of verisimilitude or ‘naturalism’ that is deceptively transparent to Western gaze.” He pointed to the detailed depictions of both facial expressions and bodily postures that convey nuanced emotional states such as torment, fear, despair, lust, and grief. Although there were unquestionably distinctive beliefs and practices between, and even within, different Classic period polities, there appears to have been some­thing of a “codi.cation of bodily movement and position” across the Lowlands that provided the Classic Maya with a “shared, connective com­municative identity (perhaps even representing a concept of elite practice), while simultaneously emphasizing difference and inequality between individuals” (Jackson 2009:75–76). 
In 
sum, 
the 
messages Maya elites hoped to convey through their postural attitudes, both actual and those idealized in their artwork, likely came through loud and clear to their intended audiences. 
Emotional states are easily identi.ed when there is congruence between an individual’s facial expression, body language, and voice, but surprisingly, recent studies have revealed that the body alone is capable of conveying certain human emotions to virtually the same degree as isolated facial or vocal expressions (Coulson 2004; 
de 
Gelder 
2009). 
This 
holds 
true 
even 
in 
static images with limited vantage points (Coul­son 2004:132), 
or 
when 
postural 
attitudes 
are 
conveyed by faceless humanoid avatars (Klein­smith et al. 2011). 
On 
that 
note, 
LMA 
has 
rather 
unexpectedly been thrust into the twenty-.rst century by STEM .elds (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) in their quest to imbue human-like attributes into everything from video game avatars to arti.cially intelligent robots (Burton et al. 2016; 
Chi 
et 
al. 
2000; 
Zacharatos et al. 2014). 

Accurate identi.cation of emotional states communicated via physical expressions, be they human, robot, or computer-generated humanoid avatar, is further enhanced when the viewer understands the context in which the expression in question is elicited (Carroll and Russell 1996; 
Zhang and Sharkey 2011; 
see 
also 
Gombrich 
1982; 
Lakoff 
and 
Johnson 
1980). 
There 
are, of course, both similarities and differences in the meanings associated with distinct bodily posture (Kleinsmith et al. 2006), 
but 
intracultural 
identi.cation of certain emotional states based on an individual’s posture is quite consistent (Elfenbein and Ambady 2003), 
so 
much 
so 
that, 
in what may sound to some like the seeds of a dystopian future, arti.cially intelligent robots are being programmed with LMA “to create reciprocal interactive behaviors that appear nat­ural and are not restricted to simple imitation” (Lourens et al. 2010:1263; 
see also McColl et al. 2016). 

Although most of this type of research involv­ing LMA is being driven by future-oriented .elds, many of their .ndings are equally appli­cable to ancient Maya art. Combined with our emerging understanding of the consistency of elite messaging practices during the Classic period, we feel con.dent that LMA is an appro­priate, if not optimal, tool for interpreting the idealized two-dimensional static depictions of Maya dance. 


Classic Maya Dance 
Dancing was one of the most common rituals per­formed by Classic Maya rulers throughout their

reigns. 
Grube 
(1992) 
was 
the 
.rst 
to 
translate 
the T516 glyph as ‘to dance.’ Phonetically, the glyph is read as ahk’ot and may be semantically related to the term for “give,” ahk’ (Macri and Looper 2003:206). 
Ahk’ also serves as the root for yahk’a(w), “he/she gives (it),” which is used in the context of offerings made to the gods (Looper 2009:17). 
In 
essence, 
the 
dances 
may 
be 
seen 
as offerings or tributes to the gods, and dance continues to be an acceptable form of prayer among traditional Mesoamerican communities (Houston 2006:144; 
Looper 
2009:18). 

Dances were associated with a wide variety of events: deity impersonation rituals, sacri.ces, heir designation and other dynastic events, warfare, and visits by overlords (Looper 2009:5). 
Dances and public spectacles need not be seen as purely religious events, as they also served sociopolitical functions in legitimizing the power of a ruler (Houston 2006; 
Looper 
2009:5; 
Schele 
and Miller 1986). 
As Sahagún 
(1950–1982 
[1575–1578]:8:150) noted, among the Aztec, dancing was one of the primary responsibilities of the ruler and was done “in order to hearten and console all the peers, the noblemen, the lords, the brave warriors, and all the common folk and vassals.” Among the Classic Maya, public ceremonies were sometimes marked with the glyphic expression cha’nil (literally, “something being watched”; Tokovinine 2003:3). 
The expression occasionally occurs in conjunction with glyphic references to dance, which suggests that certain royal dances were intended to be performed in front of an audience (Looper 2009:18; 
Tokovinine 
2003). 

One of the earliest iconographic depictions of dance in the Maya area comes from the San Bartolo west wall mural (ca. 100 BC). The Maize God dances inside the quatrefoil carapace of the earth turtle while tapping his turtle shell drum pectoral in preparation for his resurrection (Taube et al. 2010: 
Figure 
46). 
Curiously, 
over 
seven centuries pass before the .rst known tex­tual reference to dance occurs. The earliest use of the dance glyph, found on Altar L at Quirigua, dates to AD 653 (Looper 1991:91). 
Other 
early 
references (AD 668–733) come from Dos Pilas, Naranjo, Piedras Negras, and La Corona. From AD 752–780, most dance references are limited to the Yaxchilan region. After about AD 780, glyphic references to dance are found scattered throughout the Maya area (Looper 2009:18). 

Proskouriakoff was the .rst to propose that the raised-heel motif was indicative of formal scenes of dance, noting that the dancers’ motions always appeared 
“restrained” 
(1950:28). 
Building 
on Proskouriakoff, Miller 
(1981) 
noted 
that 
this 
pose includes bent knees, horizontal “turn-out” of the feet and hips, and a single foot placed on “three-quarter” pointe. 
Looper 
(2001:118) 
sug­
gests the raised-heel motif is better understood as a “conventional reference” to dance rather than a literal depiction of speci.c dance movements, noting that even in instances when glyphic refer­ences to dance accompany the scene, the dancer typically maintains a “highly rigid pose.” 
Speci.c hand gestures are often used in con­junction with the raised-heel motif in scenes of dance, but identical gestures are sometimes used by non-dancers as well (Ancona-Ha et al. 2000), 
suggesting that hand gestures alone do not indi­cate dance (Miller 1981:133–134). 
One 
of 
the 
more common gestures involves the hand bent back sharply at the wrists with the palm facing outward and the .ngers slightly .exed (Miller 1981:134). 
In 
addition 
to 
the 
standard 
lifted-heel 
pose, many of the dancers are depicted bending at the waist (Miller 1981:133), 
the 
signi.cance 
of which we will return to below. 
Our attempt to read the bodies of dancers as multilayered repositories of semiotic infor­mation aims to complement previous studies of Maya dance that have explored dance perfor­mance contexts as well as the iconic aspects of posture, gesture, and costuming (Houston 2006; 
Houston et al. 2006; 
Looper 
2001, 
2009; 
Taube 
1985, 
2009). 
Following 
Naerebout 
(1997:234, cited in Looper 2009:103), 
we 
resist 
any 
attempt 
to reconstruct the dances themselves. Our argu­ments rest on iconography, not choreography. What follows is an analysis of two of the most common categories of Classic Maya dance— those of the Maize God and those of the wahy beings—.ltered through the lenses of both LMA and Peircean semiotics. 


The Re.ned Body of the Maize God Dancer 
One of the most widespread motifs in Maya art is the dancing Maize God (Looper 2009:149; 


Downloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core. YBP Library Services, on 22 Aug 2018 at 17:04:06, subject to the Cambridge Core terms of use, available at https://www.cambridge.org/core/terms. https://doi.org/10.1017/laq.2018.1 
Taube 2009:42). 
It 
is 
especially 
prominent 
on 
Holmul-style vessels (Looper 2008, 
2009) 
and 
on the “Tikal Dancer Plates” (Boot 2003). 
Such 
scenes are so common that Taube suggested, “if there is a Classic Maya god of dance, it would be the maize god” (Taube 2009:42). 
The 
Maize 
God 
was one of the fundamental components of the “shared vocabulary” that transcended distinctive identities formed by both political boundaries and social classes across the Maya lowlands (Ino­mata 2007; 
Jackson 
2009; 
Reents-Budet 
1998). 

As depicted on Maya polychrome ceram­ics, Maize God dancers almost always have a distinctly vertical spinal alignment (K0097, K0621, K0622, K0633, K0703, K1271, K1837, K3388, K4464, K4619, K5648, K5941, K7434, K7720, K8088, K8190, K8533). Kurath and Marti 
(1964:140) 
were 
the 
.rst 
to 
highlight 
the 
“erect posture” of a Maize God dancer “with feet in classic ballet ‘third position’—one foot half across the other—probably in a jump, with the dancer .ipping his feet, arms extended, hands down from the wrists,” depicted on one of 
the 
Tikal 
Dancer 
plates 
(Figure 
1). 
They 
use 
Labanotation to provide a detailed description of the Maize God’s speci.c posture and ges­ture, which forms a basis from which we can begin formulating qualitative statements about the depictions. How is the body of the dancer positioned within Space? What type of Effort is conveyed by the dancer’s posture and gesture? What meanings might these postural attitudes convey to the viewer? 
Meanings can often be adduced from the visual perspectives that artists chose when depicting their subjects, particularly those relat­ing to frontal versus pro.le views of the head or body (Klein 1976; 
Palka 
2002; 
Schapiro 
1973:37–49). 
In 
two-dimensional 
Classic 
Maya 
art, however, the heads of all full-length .gures are almost unfailingly depicted in pro.le view. Although frontality of the torso often denotes “peak .gures” and establishes hierarchical rela­tionships in Classic Maya art (Palka 2002), 
shifting perspectives of the Maize God dancers’ bodies may simply represent different moments from the same dance. Indeed, both frontal and pro.le perspectives of the Maize God’s dance are sometimes depicted on opposite sides of the same vase (K517, K621, K3400, K5977). 
Signi.cant variation exists within and between regional styles regarding the frontality of Maize God dancers (Looper 2009:117–131). 
Long-established conventions may have governed such artistic 
decisions. 
As 
Looper 
(2009:92) 
noted, 
“the representation of dance poses in Maya art is very much determined by the need to avoid foreshortening and oblique views of the body.” Unlike frontality, however, their vertical­ity remained remarkably consistent, which forms the foundation of our analysis here. 
Vertical posture is often used cross-culturally as an indexical marker of training, technique, poise, and regality (Miettinen 1992:99). 
Semiotic 
indices and icons are not mutually exclusive, however, so the Maize God’s postural verticality may also be an iconic sign that is representational of his identi.cation with the axis mundi. Among the Classic Maya, royal bodies in general tend to be depicted with this same erect posture, and indeed, the body of the ruler is also conceptu­alized as a living axis mundi (Houston et al. 2006; 
Schele 
and 
Miller 
1986:77; 
Taube 
1996, 
1998). 
The 
depiction 
of Pakal on the lid of his own sarcophagus provides one of the rare examples of a ruler in the guise of the Maize God whose posture is neither rigid nor vertical. To the contrary, his pose is that of a newborn infant. In this depiction, Pakal dons the garb of the Maize God not to recreate the god’s dance, but rather to mimetically enact his rebirth (Martin 2002; 
Taube 
1994). 
Importantly, 
from 
Pakal’s resurrecting body springs the World Tree. In Classic Maya cosmology, the Maize God’s resurrection as the World Tree brings order to the chaos, centers the cosmos, and provides new life to humanity (Martin 2006:179). 
As 
such, 
the 
vertical posture of the Maize God, and that of the rulers who dance in his guise, functions as an iconic sign representing the axis mundi,“the place of transformation, mediation, and balance” (Stross 1992:102). 

In addition to their verticality, the bodies of Maize God dancers are also focused and directional. There is little ambiguity in their attention to Space; their gestural focus is speci.c. Their arms appear to have a one-dimensional, sagittal, Spoke-like movement process, forward from the core of the body to the periphery of their kinesphere, pinpointing a speci.c spatial goal

with the gesturing arm. Their gaze, like their bod­ies, is typically focused and directional, although sometimes they appear to gaze into the distance, far beyond their gesturing arm. Although the spine of the dancer remains vertically aligned, the distal parts of the body (particularly the arms and hands) are typically positioned at points within an octahedral 
pattern 
(Figure 
2). 
This 
pattern is found on nearly all Holmul Maize God dancer vessels (see, for example, K0633, K3388, K4619, K5977, K7434, K7720, K7814, K8088, K8190). Such spatial clarity is one of the de.ning characteristics of the Maize God’s dance. 
Determining Space qualities from two-dimensional art has obvious limitations, so we are fortunate to have at least one well-preserved, fully in-the-round bust of the Maize God to analyze 
(Figure 
3). 
Burdick 
(2010:93) notes that such three-dimensional .gural sculptures from across the Maya area “exemplify the energy and vitality that artists aimed to evoke in two-dimensional works.” The bust (that originally adorned Structure 10L-22 at Copan) furnishes us with a dynamic, three-dimensional rendering of the Maize God’s peripheral spatial tension (de.ning the boundary around his kinesphere), as well as his engagement in an octahedral movement constellation.

The hand gestures of the Maize God dancers exhibit peripheral spatial tension by calling atten­tion to the distance between his core and the edge of his kinesphere. Although the .ngers are deployed with delicacy and re.nement, they nevertheless convey a sense of bound, contained energy (see especially K8533, K9190, K8088, K7814, K7720, K7434, K7013, K5977, K5648, K4619, K4464, K3389, K1837, K0633).

body, a person appears to project full involve­ment, conviction, and sincerity.” This is evident in the hand and arm movements of the Holmul Maize God dancers, which are always engaged in forward (sagittal) space, either directly forward or on the forward-high diagonal. Nevertheless, the Tikal Dancers often show the arms positioned on the high-side diagonal, suggesting a vertical rather than sagittal movement process. Never­theless, either pattern exhibits an attention to an octahedral Space Harmony progression. 
The Maize God dancers typically display a distinct wrist .exion and form spatially clear, exacting hand gestures. Catalogued using LMA, this wrist .exion shows a strongly de.ned kine-sphere, peripheral spatial tension, and Bound Effort. Maya scribes, both human and supernat­ural, often display this same type of distinctive hand 
gesture 
(Figure 
4). 
The 
scribal 
arts 
would 
have required similar levels of discipline, and thus their distinctive hand gestures are likewise indexical markers of their own training and proprioceptive control (see Herring 2005:24). 
By way of contrast, the individual being held up 
by 
his 
companions 
in 
K1092 
(Figure 
5) 
has 
slack hands, and his lack of distinct, spatially precise gestures stand in contrast to other .gures in the scene. He also lacks an upright vertical dimensional posture. His attention to Space is neither direct nor focused. His knees appear weak, as if he cannot hold himself upright. His posture and gestures are easily recognizable indexical signs that he is drunk. 
The two most common gestures formed by the Maize God dancers are what Ancona-Ha and coauthors 
(2000:1075, 
1081) 
have 
designated “Gesture 1” and “Gesture 14.” In Gesture 1 (Figure 
6), 
the 
palm 
faces 
outward with the .ngertips pointing down. It is commonly found in supernatural palace scenes featuring the god Itzamnaaj, where he appears to use the gesture as a salutation or greeting as he sits upon his throne, although high-ranking human elites occasionally mimic it in palace scenes as well (Ancona-Ha et al. 2000:1075). 
With 
Gesture 
14 
(see 
Figure 
4), 
the thumb either touches or almost touches the tip of one of the .ngers (Ancona-Ha et al. 2000:1081). 
Although 
rarely 
found 
on 
the 
Tikal 
Dancer plates, it is by far the most commonly used by the Holmul Maize God dancers (Looper 2009:125). 
The 
gesture 
is 
never 
sloppy 
or 
arbi­
trary. Typically, a single .nger delicately touches the thumb (K0633, K1837, K3389, K4464, K4619, K5648, K5977, K7013, K7434, K7720, K7814, K8088, K9190, K8533). Because Ges­ture 14 is used in such a wide variety of situations

and by a broad range of characters, it is dif.cult to offer any precise interpretation of either its iconic or symbolic meanings (Ancona-Ha et al. 2000:1082). 
Nevertheless, 
we 
may 
still 
glean 
semiotic information from it by exploring the potential meanings it carries as an indexical sign. 
Distinctly crystallized gestures such as these often serve as indexical signs of propriocep­tive re.nement (Kendon 1988; 
McNeill 
1992). 
Our analysis .nds that the dance of the Maize God is neither improvisational nor loose. The entire dance appears controlled, regal, and civil. The clearly de.ned hand gestures of the Maize God dancers and cultivated sense of re.nement make clear that they are exhibiting trained, choreographed dance behavior. Among the Clas­sic Maya, “re.nement was read into bodily equipoise,” and “civility lent a particular appear­ance and feel to entire performative situations and physical conditions” (Herring 2005:79). 
Ver­
ticality, upright stance, and posture are aligned to present the Maize God dancers in a sublimely human or metahuman state. Their embodied schema exhibit a rari.ed sense of movement. This crystallization of vertical alignment and directly focused Light/Bound gesture is found in many styles of dance cross-culturally and often used to portray a sense of “withheld strength” (Miettinen 1992:99). 
This 
sense 
is 
augmented 
by 
the lower bodies of many Maize God dancers, which exhibit a Strong Weight Effort. They appear to be strongly rooted into the ground, with the weight center of the body .owing downward into the earth, while the upper body .oats upward, supported by the base. 
The Maize God dancers’ combination of Weight-Effort with Bound Flow and Direct Attention to Space leads us to postulate that they are engaged in what Laban analysts call “Spell Drive,” a compelling, nearly hypnotic combination of movement efforts. As Barteni­eff 
and 
Lewis 
(1980:61) 
note, 
”Without 
Time’s 
sense of urgency or delay to loosen the stabil­ity, the steadfastness of Space/Weight becomes inescapable when Flow’s ‘goingness’ is added to it, and a spell-like intensity is created.” Clas­sic Maya elites entered into this state through dances performed during costumed deity imper­sonation rituals, wherein they believed they merged with, or even embodied, the supernatural

being in a very real way (Houston et al. 2006: 
270; Taube 2009:45). 
As 
Danielsson 
(2002:181) noted, “masks enable embodiment of disembod­ied states” in transformative situations. Although it can be dif.cult at times to determine if a scene is intended to depict an actual supernatural being or merely a human impersonator (Frei­del et al. 1993:262), 
our 
interpretive 
approach 
remains unaffected due to the perceived onto­logical unity that exists between the dancer and the gods during such ritual moments (Houston et al. 2006:270; 
see 
also 
Lakoff 
and 
Johnson 
1980). 
The 
Maize 
God, 
of 
course, 
was 
the 
most 
commonly impersonated deity during such ritual dances (Taube 2001:306). 

Previous analyses of the posture and gestures of the Maize God dancers have focused on their iconic aspects by noting that they are imitative of the maize plant. Complemented by an indexical analysis, those same scenes also reveal their pos­ture and gestures to be indicative of the dancers’ training in speci.c movement technique. This movement technique is in turn indexical of a re.ned sense of harmony and equipoise. The bodies of the Maize God dancers are thus made “literate,” .uent in the language of re.ned movement that is choreographed, speci.c, and meaning-making. It was up to the artists to make them legible to the viewer, however. Houston (2001:215, 
expounding on the work of Levy [1984]) 
emphasizes 
that 
affect—the 
subjective 
states attributed by one person to another—was “hypercognated” or “elaborated and explicitly highlighted” in Classic Maya art, noting that “by their very appearance in painting and sculpture, affect, fear and despair, drunkenness, lustful abandon and grief must have been subject to comment and dissection. In a word, they were

hypercognated by the Classic Maya. But the absence of such affect must also have been hypercognated, as part of an idealized mode of self-constraint and concealment of emotion behind stylized gesture.” Filtered through our semiotic lens, that means we may read the con­trolled, re.ned affect of the Maize God dancers not only for what they are, but also in terms of what they are not: they are expressly not wild or unrestrained, a point to which we will return. 
We speculate that vestiges of this dance may still be manifest in traditional Maya communities today. Among the Tzutujil Maya of Santiago Ati­tlan, Guatemala, for example, a powerful priest known as a nab’eysil performs a ritual dance which 
Christenson 
(2006) 
describes 
as being “stately,” “slow,” “restrained,” and “purposeful.” Signi.cantly, the priest dances while holding the sacred bundle of Martín, the patron of the maize harvest. The dance “consists mostly of small, purposeful steps with the knees slightly bent, the arms held downward and away from the body, and rhythmically leaning his body from side to side” (Christenson 2006:240–241). 
At 
the 
end of the dance, the nab’eysil holds his arms outward and slightly down in a “cruci.xion­like pose.” One of the Tzutujil men explained that the pose represented “a maize plant as it grows out of the earth with its leaves extend­ing outward away from the stalk” (Christenson 2006:241–242), 
vividly 
illustrating 
the 
concept 
that bodily posture and gesture function as iconic signs. Although this ethnographic description is tantalizingly similar to those offered by icono­graphers concerning the Classic period Maize God dancers, caution warrants we present it here by way of analogy rather than as a rubric for interpretation (Taube 2014; 
see 
also 
Bricker 
1981:130–133). 



Gestural Vocabulary of the Wahy Creatures 
In dramatic contrast to the re.ned gestures that typify the Maize God are those of the strange wahy creatures 
that 
populate 
the 
underworld4. 
The wahy are a common type of supernatural being, although they are not technically con­sidered gods. Not only are they never granted the divine epithet k’uh (sacred, holy), they are also never shown in direct interaction with such sacred beings (Grube 2004:74). 
They 
are 
gener­
ally depicted as fantastical or frightening crea­tures that combine anthropomorphic, zoomor­phic, or skeletal features (Calvin 1997; 
Grube 
2004:215). 
Although 
not 
completely 
understood, 
some Classic period wahy entities may have been personi.cations of disease, illnesses, or sorcery (Grube 2004; 
Helmke 
and 
Nielsen 
2009; 
Houston and Inomata 2009:208; 
Stuart 
2012; 
Zender 2004:72–77). 

As with the Maize God, elites commonly impersonated these entities by wearing particular masks and costume elements during their ritual performances. Scenes of dancing wahy creatures are extremely common on Classic period ceramic vessels (Grube 1992:214), 
and 
as 
with 
the 
Maize 
God dancers, their postural and gestural char­acteristics are ripe with semiotic meaning. To illustrate, we turn .rst to an elegantly executed Ik’-style vessel, the Altar de Sacri.cios Vase (Figure 
7), 
painted 
by 
the 
same 
artist 
who 
created 
K791. The artist was sponsored by the ruler K’ihnich Lamaw Ek’, and we know of at least two other vases painted by the same hand, which likewise feature wahy creatures (Halperin and Foias 2010; 
Reents-Budet 
et 
al. 
2007). 
On 
both 
the Altar Vase and K791, the wahy beings dance with a downward, internal focus, yet their bodies appear light and luminous. Their kinesphere has shrunk. The dancers look away from their hands. 
Looper 
(2009:224) 
describes 
their 
dance 
postures as “strongly hunched or agitated.” Their eyes focus downward, as if concentrating on inner processes or visions, which .nd physi­cal expression in private, personal movement processes. The internal focus of these dancers seems indicative of a remote state. They appear to be experiencing an otherworldly reality, one of trance or ecstasy. Unlike the vertical position of the Maize God dancers, the wahy dancers bend at the waist, and their torsos appear .uid and loose, engaged in a process of free-.owing energy. Their dance is wholly unconcerned with spatial precision or articulation. Their movement is not Bound or contained. Their legs and feet step lightly on the ground. In stark contrast to the Strong Weight displayed by the Maize God dancers, the wahy creatures do not appear rooted into the earth. To the contrary, they seem

to almost .oat away from it, unconstrained by gravity, perhaps indexical of an out-of-body experience or a “dreamlike vision” (Werness-Rude and Spencer 2015:19). 



Discussion 
The gestural vocabularies of the dances of the Maize God dancers and those of the wahy are qualitatively and indexically far removed from each other. Every Effort quality (Space, Weight, Time, and Flow) associated with the wahy creatures stands in polar opposition to those of the Maize God. The Effort qualities of the Maize God’s dance involve Direct Space, Strong Weight, Sustained Time, and Bound Flow. Those of the wahy, in contrast, involve Indirect Space, Light Weight, Sudden Time, and Free Flow Efforts. 
Recalling 
Houston’s 
(2001) 
discussion 
of hypercognition, we can de.ne each of their affects both in terms of what they are and what they are not. Regardless of the culture-speci.c

meanings that may be associated with these two types of dance, the message is still clear: they are diametrically opposed to each other. 
The dramatically different movement vocab­ularies of the Maize God dancers and the wahy beings has previously been recognized as repre­senting the concepts of order and chaos, respec­tively (Looper 2009:226). 
The 
tension 
between 
these opposing forces continues to frame the worldview of modern Maya peoples. Among the Yucatec Maya, for example, the word toh literally means “straight” or “truth,” but it also connotes moral rectitude and ethical correctness (as do its cognates in several other Mayan lan­guages; Taube 2003:465). 
The 
majority 
of 
the 
depictions of the dancing Maize God show him engaging in straight-line movement processes, both in the core (spine and torso) and distal parts (arms and legs) of his body. Iconically, the postural vocabulary of the Maize God is cultivated, ordered, and bounded. In this sense it resembles the milpa, which itself is a microcosm of the ordered universe. 
In contrast, the wahy dancers are unconcerned with the sort of proprioceptive control or re.ne­ment exhibited by the Maize God dancers. Out of control, the wahy demons are often depicted in positions of extreme contortion and with bizarre proportions, often to humorous effect (Taube 1989:484; 
Wichmann 
and 
Nielsen 
2016:302). 
The scenes are typically set in the underworld, which is conceptually linked to places like caves that lack “internal order and spatial divisions” (Stone 1995:16–18) 
or 
the 
wild, 
untamed 
forest 
(Taube 2003:467–468). 
Thick, 
knotted 
forest 
growth is referred to as lob’ in Yucatec, a word that is likewise used to denote that which is evil and dark in other Mayan languages (Barrera Vásquez et al. 1980:219, 
454–456; 
Ho.ing 
and 
Tesucun 1997:416; 
Taube 
2003:466). 

Although there are many depictions of wahy creatures on Maya polychrome ceramics, which we did not address in this short analysis, our sur­vey indicates that bodily contortion and distor­tion of perspective are intentionally emphasized in such scenes. Unlike the extremely rari.ed upright dance of the Maize God, the wahy move with little or no attention to space. Indeed, their posture often appears to defy the normal limits of bodily capability. It is as if they threaten to spill outside the boundaries of their own skin (as on K5010 and K1379). The wahy dancers exhibit little attention to the direction their bodies move in space and effectively embody the chaotic, unde.ned boundaries of the “forest” in contrast to the “carefully delineated world of humans” (Taube 2003:469). 

Signs are, by their nature, both polysemous and imbricative (Preucel 2006:155). 
We 
suggest 
the bodily postures of the Maize God dancers and those of the wahy creatures are themselves signs that convey multiple meanings. The body of the Maize God dancer may be iconic of multiple things at once: the maize plant itself, the milpa, the axis mundi, even the order of the cosmos. Concomitantly, their controlled, re.ned dances serve as indexical markers of their indi­vidual training and skill. As noted previously, Joyce 
(2014:75) 
emphasized 
that 
iconographic 
depictions of textiles on Mesoamerican .gures were capable of “indexing labor, skill, and social personhood,” not only of the artists who made the .gurines, but also of those who made the tex­tiles that were represented on the .gurines. Our indexical analysis of Late Classic polychrome ceramics leads us to draw similar conclusions about Maya dancers and the artists who depicted them. 


Conclusions 
Some 
.fty 
years 
ago, 
Kurath 
and 
Marti 
(1964:26) 
suggested that the movements and gestures of Maya dancers could provide a glimpse into their innermost emotional states. We have attempted to deliver on their suggestion by analyzing Classic period scenes of dance through the lenses of both LMA and Peircean semiotic theory. We believe this particular amalgam of approaches offers a unique but methodologically robust platform that can be effectively used to draw meanings from Classic period iconography, which have previously gone unnoticed. In effect, we consider these methods to be translation tools that have the potential to increase our .uency in ancient Maya body language. 
The application of Peircean semiotic analysis has allowed us to postulate that these movement processes are indexical markers of cultural training. In understanding the movements of

the Maize God dancers as indices of speci.c cultural training, we approach understanding the symbolic mode of Classic Maya dance. Why? Because cultural training is rule driven and therefore symbolic of the technical language-like aspects of the dance. It is tempting to consider the depictions of dance as “true signs” that depict social status (Ancona-Ha et al. 2000). 
However, it is the layered nature of dance—its ability to “work” iconically, symbolically, and indexically—that makes it such a rich repository of cultural information.

Notes 
1. We will follow the standard practice of capitalizing key terms from Laban movement analysis to distinguish them from common English usage throughout this paper. 
2. The states are Awake (space + time), Dream (weight 
+ .ow), Stable (weight + space), Mobile (time + .ow), Remote (.ow + space), and Rhythm (weight + time). 
3. 
The drives are Action (space + weight + time), Vision (time + space + .ow), Spell (weight + space + .ow), and Passion (time + weight + .ow). 

4. 
The orthography of way vs. wahy is unsettled. Our usage
