CERRO LAMPAY: ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN AND HUMAN 
INTERACTION IN THE NORTH CENTRAL COAST OF PERU 

Rafael Vega-Centeno 
Recent fieldwork concerning the late Preceramic!late Archaic period on the PeruvianNorth-Central Ccoast has revealed the existence of large architectural complexes, which scholars interpret as indicative of social complexity. This article is especially concerned with architectural design as an effective means to define social and political organization at Cerro Lampay. ft concludes that there was not a highly formalized hierarchy but that power positions within the community could have been negotiated through ritual practices that included the dual organization of participants. It is highly probable that the residents of the North Central Coast were in constant and intense interaction during the late Archaic, which may have resulted in displays of competitive emulationin ritual settings.

Pativilca, and Supe valleys. Architectural design can be analyzed through two dimensions: the spa­tial structure, understood as the arrangement of spaces and their access system, and the perceptual structure, understood as the sensorial experience and behavioral stimuli that it generates. 
The proposed analysis will be based on evi­dence from the site of Cerro Lampay, which I exca­vated in 2002 and 2003. The results will be compared with existing data on other North Cen­tral Coast sites such as Aspero, Chupacigarro, and Cara!, in order to define architectural patterns of regional scope. After this comparison and pattern definition, a working hypothesis is developed on the dynamics that generated the social processes that this region witnessed throughout the third mil­lennium B.C. 
The Study of Architectural Design: Spatial 
Structure and Sensorial Experience 

Large-scale buildings whose construction or use was beyond the household sphere have always been considered as manifestations of social complexity and have often been labeled as "public architec­ture." Furthermore, evolutionary approaches gave particular emphasis to the study of public archi­tecture as a relevant index of complexity (Kaplan 1963; Peebles and Kus 1977:432; Renfrew 
1974:77; Service 1975:96). A significant charac­teristic of these approaches was the emphasis on the construction process, through which public architecture was usually addressed as an outcome of energy flows (expressed in labor power and craftsmanship skills) within a sociocultural sys­tem. Consequently, research was often oriented toward quantifying labor mobilization in order to define the scale of the society involved in con­struction (Abrams 1989; Adams 1975). 
More recent archaeological studies of public architecture have addressed the qualitative vari­ables of construction processes and labor organi­zation (Cavallaro and Shimada 1988; Wills 2000) and have called attention to the active role that pub­lic architecture may play in the reproduction of a social order (Moore 1996; Nielsen 1995; Smith 1996). These new inquiries have brought new the­oretical perspectives to archeological research, addressing the classic ideas of Edward Hall ( 1969) on the role of the built space in the construction of a social and a cultural realm or the considerations of Amos Rapoport (1976:9) on constructed space as a behavioral setting and a catalyst or releaser of latent behavior. 
Within this perspective, it is necessary to under­stand the nature and spatial organization of a given architectural design, as spatial arrangements reflect not only the characteristics of a society but also a set of strategies for social interaction (Hillier et al. 1976: 180). It is reasonable to assume that a spe­cific and formalized design orients human action within it. Moreover, if such a design corresponds to a ritual space, the characteristics of its design might be more relevant in terms of acting as a "behavioral setting." 
Following the considerations of Hillier and Hanson (1984:144-146), an architectural design can be understood as a structure in which spatial units are differentiated, distributed, and interre­lated through a given access system. They have proposed an approach to understanding the spatial structure of a building as a syntactic organization in which spaces and accesses are compared to unit cells and their corresponding relations. Thus, a spatial arrangement can be translated into graphs in which spatial units are represented by circles and their accesses are represented as connecting lines. Graphics start with a circle that denotes the car­rier space and establish a certain number of lev­els, according to the relative distance (in terms of cells to pass through) or depth of the spatial units from the carrier space (Hillier and Hanson 1984: 144-146). 
Graphics are the beginning of what is called a gamma analysis and reveal the structural arrange­ment of a building, understandable on the basis of two variables: asymmetry and distributedness. Asymmetry refers to the number of spatial units vs. the number of levels in which these units are orga­nized, indicating the degree of hierarchy of the spa­tial organization. Distributedness is related to the number of spatial units and the number of relations or accesses among them, indicating the degree of centralization of the access routes within the struc­ture (Hillier and Hanson 1984: 147-155). Both vari­ables can be measured through specific indexes: the index of relative asymmetry and the index of rela­tive ringiness. 1 
It is important to note that the space syntax model is based on a binary distinction between

boundaries and permeabilities, conceived mainly as walls and doorways. Nevertheless, the differen­tiation of spaces and their access degrees might be related with other elements beyond walls and door­ways, such as mobile barriers, differences in light sources, or relative height. Thus, the results of gamma analyses should be considered as plausible scenarios of human interaction that require addi­tional data on the three-dimensional aspects of architectural design. These data can be addressed through an analysis of the perceptual structure. 
The perceptual structure of arc_hitectural 
design can be approached on the basis of Edward Hall's definition of "proxemics" (1969: 1 ), that is, the study of the observations and explanations of human use of space. According to Hall ( 1969: 181 ), a human sense of space is a synthesis of sensory inputs: visual, auditory, kinesthetic, olfactory, and thermal . Thus, experiences of a constructed space will be related to the way in which such a space provides new sensory perceptions. 
Architectural space often has the property of pro­viding appropriate contexts for displays (including actions, objects, and facilities) that transmit mes­sages through the five inputs. Among these inputs, visual and kinesthetic dimensions have the advan­tage that they are comparatively more grounded in the perception of surface elements that are more often preserved in the archaeological record. 
The visual perception of space has been addressed by Tadahiko Higuchi (1983) in relation to the study of landscapes. Subsequently, this approach has been convincingly adapted to con­structed environments by Jerry Moore (1996). Higuchi's proposal resides in the idea that visual environments can be decoded as a concatenation of surfaces, which are perceived at certain angles in relation to the observer (angles of incidence). The angle at which the line of vision strikes the observed surface determines what can be seen and how it is seen. The perceived surfaces of a visual environ­ment can be classified into two kinds of planes: frontal and longitudinal. In addition, it is noted that the human line of vision is around 10° below the horizontal and that the need to move from this line of vision is critical in the perception of elevations and depressions (Higuchi 1983: 38, 46-4 7). Hence, the combination of these factors forms the basis for the generation of three main kinds of spatial per­ceptions: width, depth, and height (Higuchi 1983:4, 24 ). These perceptions might enhance or reduce the experience of distance and also stimulate physical responses after such experience. 
The kinesthetic perception is basically deter­mined by the feasibility of displacement for a human body. Therefore, it might be inferred by identifying the physical constraints that are gener­ated during displacement through a given spatial organization. Such constraints can be evaluated in terms of the size and shape of architectural facili­ties, such as the height of steps, the length of ramps, the narrowness of corridors or entryways, and the height of roofs. This perceptual dimension has been explored previously by Donald Sanders (1990) in his study of Myrtos residential structures, noting the relevance of what he calls behavioral conven­tions such as privacy, territoriality, and visibility of space. 
The use of both syntactic and perceptual approaches has been addressed by Jerry Moore (1996:98-120, 179-205) in his study of Andean architecture, although they are not used for the same cases. In contrast, other authors advocate for the importance of combining gamma analysis with the analysis of spatial displacement (e.g., Brusasco 2003; Sanchez 1998). In addition, it has been noted that the quantitative approaches of gamma analy­sis require sufficient data, which are seldom pre­sent in the archaeological record (Cutting 2003). Nonetheless, when data are adequate, quantitative analysis has proved to be highly productive (e.g., Ferguson 1996). 
In the following sections, both spatial structure and spatial perception of public architecture in the Central Andes will be evaluated. Before this analy­sis, however, the regional scenario will be dis­cussed. 
The Regional Setting: Late Archaic Public 
Architecture in the Central Andes 

Throughout the twentieth century, the Central Andes was a major focus of research on and dis­cussion about the emergence and nature of social complexity. Information on Andean complex soci­eties was used to support general theories of sociopolitical evolution (e.g., Carneiro 1970; Stew­ard 1963:206), as well as to propose the existence of singular evolutionary developments (e.g., Mose­ley 1975).

More recently, the study of the emergence of social complexity in the Central Andes has focused on the cultural manifestations of the late Archaic period. This period is characterized by the existence of sedentary societies with a subsistence base that included an agricultural economy complemented by fishing and shellfish collection. The main char­acteristic of the late Archaic period, however, is the appearance oflarge-scale public buildings, usually considered of a ritual nature. The size and elabo­ration of several of these buildings have captured the attention of scholars who seek to define the degree of complexity of the societies that built them. It is significant that, in most cases, architectural data have been approached from the perspective of construction phenomena. Buildings have often been studied as the result of construction activities that required the recruitment of a labor force far beyond the household level, stressing the corre­spondence of buildings' scale and complexity with the scale and complexity of the human groups involved in their construction (e.g., Moseley 1975:79-80). This kind of approach was previ­ously applied to the study of the early Formative or Initial period of the Central Andes (ca. 1500--1000 B.C. [e.g., Lanning 1967:94; Pozorski 1987 :23]). Despite differences in their elaboration, these proposals resemble the theoretical models proposed by authors like Renfrew (1974) and Abrams (1989). In essence, they stressed the role of building processes under neo-evolutionary schemes like the one proposed by Service (1962). The social relevance of architectural design has been seldom addressed, with a few notable excep­tions. In his study on Huaca de los Reyes, a middle Formative period (1 100-800 B.C.) complex, Thomas Pozorski (1982:250--252) notes that the overall plan of the architecture shows a three-level hierarchy that gives evidence of status and ranking through an increasingly restricted access system. Another attempt to understand the logic of archi­tectural design in early buildings has been devel­oped by Jerry Moore (1996:98-167), who applies visual analysis techniques to evaluate the proper­ties of Formative period monuments such as Gara­gay, Cardal, and Las Haldas in orienting behavior during ritual performances. However, since exca­vation at these sites has been limited, Moore's analy­ses must rely on the identification of broad spatial units (e.g., mound summits vs. surrounding open 
areas), which limits the scope of his conclusions. 
In regard to the late Archaic sites, Robert Feld­man proposes that buildings at Aspero had an "ever­restricting" access system at their summits (1985:82), which reveals a hierarchical social orga­nization that was not paralleled by contemporary highland sites. Burger (1992:51-52) interprets these design differences in terms of access regula­tion, with maximization in highland buildings and restriction in the coastal buildings. From another perspective, Moseley (1992: 115) sees a difference between more public-oriented rituals in the coastal buildings and more private, small-scale congrega­tions in the highland chambers. Consequently, sev­eral scholars have concluded that this difference implies different sociopolitical developments, with coastal societies being larger and more complex than their highland contemporaries (Feldman 1987:13-14; Fung 1988:75-93; see Bonnier 1997, 2007, and Lumbreras 1989:89 for an alternative view). The resulting scenario shows the need to confront these well-known models with new data and comprehensive analyses of other buildings to define the design patterns that characterized late Archaic architecture in the Central Andes. 
The Late Archaic Period on the 
North Central Coast 

The increasing prominence of the late Archaic period in the debate on the rise of complexity in the Andes is undoubtedly related to the recent finds at the site of Caral and the surrounding Supe Val­ley (Shady 1997, 2001, 2006a; Shady and Leyva 2003; Shady et al. 2001 ), which have brought about a reevaluation of the scale, economy, and regional dynamics of late Archaic societies, particularly on the North Central Coast of Peru. Research in the Supe Valley has documented 17 late Archaic sites with public architecture (Shady et al. 2000). In addition, surveys conducted in the neighboring For­taleza and Pativilca valleys (Haas and Ruiz 2002; Vega-Centeno 2004; Vega-Centeno et al. 1998) have identified more than 20 contemporary sites. Thus, almost 40 late Archaic major settlements have been identified for the North Central Coast of the Central Andes (Figure 1 ). 
Extensive excavations at the site of Cara! have revealed the time depth of the site's occupation (Shady et al. 2001). They have also revealed the

complexity of the construction process and spatial organization of the Caral pyramidal mounds, as well as the existence of residential zones that can be differentiated according to their construction quality and their relation to public spaces (Flores 2006; Shady 2006a, 2006b; Shady and Leyva 2003). Although a detailed report on Caral finds remains to be published, the existing preliminary reports demonstrate the importance and complex­ity of this large center. 
In the neighboring valleys, exploratory excava­tions have provided a large sample of radiocarbon dates from different sites of the Fortaleza and Pativilca valleys (Haas et a1. 2004a). This sample confirms the late Archaic occupation of the settle­ments and the possibility of long occupational sequences at some of them. 
Due to the aforementioned projects, there has been a significant accumulation of new data on the late Archaic period for the region, resulting in a number of associated explanatory models (Haas and Creamer 2006; Haas et al. 2004b; Shady 2006a; Shady et al. 2000; Shady et al. 2001). Shady and her colleagues (2000:26-29) propose the existence of a pristine state that developed in the Supe Val­ley, with Caral as its capital, while Haas and his colleagues argue for several hierarchically orga­
nized polities spread throughout the North Central

Coast (Haas and Creamer 2006; Haas et al. 2004b ). 
It is important to recognize that these models were based originally on surface observations of the size of public architecture (Haas et al. 2004b; Shady et al. 2000) and have not been significantly modified after excavations (Haas and Creamer 2006; Shady 2006a, 2006b ). The models share the assumption that public architecture is a product of centralized decision-making entities and, conse­quently, the scale of the buildings can be understood as manifestations of centralized and hierarchical societies. While acknowledging the social signifi­cance of public architecture within the late Archaic period, the models evaluate architecture in quanti­tative terms, where volume is used to estimate the amount of labor invested in construction. Based on the assumption that a centralized authority was required for large constructions, these assessments are then used to indicate the scale of the society involved. It is significant that even though there is agreement about the religious or ritual nature of the late Archaic period public buildings, the charac­teristics of ritual activities have not been consid­ered as relevant for evaluating how complexity developed. 
Despite the current reliance on public buildings to explain the nature oflate Archaic societies, there is a general lack of detailed analyses on the spatial organization and design of this kind of architecture and the activities that took place within it. As the architectural phenomenon is treated as a simple quantitative index of "degree of complexity," there has been little attempt to obtain detailed accounts on design and construction processes. 
To address this lack of attention, I conducted research to reevaluate the role and nature of so­called public architecture during the late Archaic and its sociopolitical relevance. I chose to conduct this research in the Fortaleza Valley, located on the North Central Coast (Vega-Centeno 2004, 2005; Vega-Centeno et al. 1998). 
Survey in the Fortaleza Valley revealed the exis­tence of a distinctive architectural pattern of plat­form mounds and sunken circular courts, which also characterized the late Archaic architecture of the Supe Valley (Shady et al. 2000). 2 Thus, I decided to excavate a site that had both kinds of architec­tural features in clear association. The chosen site is Cerro Lampay, located on the south bank of the Middle Fortaleza Valley. 
Excavations at Cerro Lampay were designed to understand the original architectural design of the building, as well as its transformations through time. They were also designed to account for the nature of the construction processes that took place and the organization of building activities and to recover archaeological remains that would allow the definition of the activities that took place within the built spaces. The recovery of large samples of organic remains for radiocarbon dating was an addi­tional priority to determine the sequence and tim­ing of the building events and their duration within the site's history (Vega-Centeno 2005:121-199). 
Cerro Lampay 
Cerro Lampay is located on the south bank of the Fortaleza Valley, a narrow, coastal, fertile zone approximately 220 km north of Lima. The site is 2 km from the Fortaleza River and approximately 5 km to the northeast of Paramonga, the district cap­ital (Figure 2). 
The site is in a small dry ravine composed of three terraces and cut by several gullies. Soils in the ravine are made up of gravel and silt sediments of colluvial origin. The archaeological zone extends throughout the three terraces and includes a ca. 4­ha late Intermediate period settlement (ca. A.D. 900-1450) in the lower terrace and a 2.4-ha late Archaic period settlement (ca. 3000/2500-1500 B.C.) on the middle and upper terraces. 
The late Archaic period settlement includes an architectural complex that is oriented to the north­west with an azimuth of 304 °, as well as a ca. 50­x-30-m artificially leveled area located on the upper terrace, approximately 20 m southeast of the archi­tectural complex, that shows a distinctive accu­mulation of organic refuse (e.g., crushed shellfish) throughout its surface. The architectural complex has a 38-x-31-m and 5-m-high mound and a 47-x­3 7 -m rectangular courtyard. The courtyard includes a 21-m-diameter Sunken Circular Court. There is also a 190-m-long narrow platform oriented to the northeast that separates the complex from the upper terrace (Figures 3-4). 
Stratigraphy 
Stratigraphy in the platform mound (Figure 5) is characterized by four units. The lowest unit corre­sponds to sterile soils, over which the architectural

units were built. These soils are composed of com­pacted gravel and silt deposits that resemble the nat­ural deposits of the ravine in which the archaeological site is placed. 
The second stratigraphic unit corresponds to several architectural features built over natural soil, including floors, benches, and walls that gave shape to the original structures of Cerro Lampay. The third stratigraphic unit includes different plat­forms and fills that covered the architectural spaces of the original structure (Figure 6). Excavations revealed that those fills encompass several stages of a complex process that ended in the "entomb­ment" of the architecture.3 During the first filling stage, the rear zone of the structure was filled, and an expedient platform was raised with new rooms and benches. Then, during the second filling stage, the entire structure was covered as a single mas­sive platform. 
The fourth and last stratigraphic unit consists of three levels of medium-to large-size angular field stones mixed with loose yellow, silty sediments. These levels correspond to postabandonment strata that originated in the weathering and/or collapse of

the upper architectural features located in the mound. 

Stratigraphy in the Sunken Circular Court area (Figure 7a-b) included several postabandonment strata deposited over the court's floor and stair­ways. Excavations revealed that the court was built after removing approximately 80 cm of soil, which was in part deposited in a 3-m-wide-x-80-cm-high fill that was used to build a platform ring that sur­rounded the court's edge. This fill contained cul­tural material such as shell, fish bones, and cotton yarns. 
The Original Architectural Structures 

Excavations at Cerro Lampay revealed that the architectural complex did not include-at least in its original design-a platform mound but, rather, consisted of two-room structures built over natural soil. They also revealed a sequence of events that were related to the construction, occupation, and abandonment of an architectural complex. This architectural complex appears to be associated with a residential zone, located 20 m southeast of it, where stone alignments suggest the possible loca­tion of walls or terraces within a leveled area that

is moderately covered by shell fragments (Vega­Centeno 2005:121-125). 
At Cerro Lampay, the original walls were con­structed with large-and medium-size (from ca. 60 x 40 to 20 x l 5 cm) rocks of irregular shape. These rocks can be found in the surrounding mountains and have an angular breakage pattern. As a result, they usually have flat sides, which were used to form relatively flat wall faces. Stones were placed irregularly and joined with abundant silty mortar. They were finally covered with l to 5 cm of plaster. 
Within the double-faced walls, there is a core usually formed by mixed gravel, stone, and mor­tar fill. These walls have various thicknesses (.4, . 7, or l.2 m) and still stand 2.4 to 3.2 min height Floors are 3 to 5 cm thick and are made of silty or clayey light gray sediments deposited over sterile soils. 
After analyzing stratigraphic relations (e.g., superposition, abutment, etc.) among architectural components such as walls, benches, and stairways, it was possible to establish a growth sequence of the original architecture at Cerro Lampay. The First Structure was followed by the construction of the Sunken Circular Court and, later, the Sec­ond Structure. 
The First Structure. The first construction at Cerro Lampay is a two-room structure built over the compacted gravel soils of the ravine and ori­ented to the northwest (azimuth 304° [Figure 8)). These rooms are labeled as Rooms I and 2 .

Figure 6. View of construction fill that covered the original architecture. 
Room 2 has a 12.2-x-11.4-m inner space, and its walls are 2.4 to 3.2 m high. The northwestern wall is built in a single section, while the lateral walls are composed of at least two sections. The walls of Room 2 show traces of red paint. 
The floor plaster is 3 cm thick and was prepared over sterile soil. There is a difference of 85 cm between the identified floor levels at the north­western and southeastern sides of Room 2. This dif­ference suggests the existence of at least one bench within the unexcavated portion of Room 2. Room 2 has a front, a back (connecting both rooms), and a lateral entryway. The main entry, placed in the northwestern wall, is 2.4 m wide and lacks steps or other access restrictions. Excavations revealed one lateral entryway, in the northeastern wall, which is 85 cm wide. The possible existence of another lat­eral entryway is suggested by the similarities in design between Rooms 1 and 2. 
Room 1 has an 8.7-x-4.4-m inner space that is delimited by walls 2.4 to 2. 7 m high. The walls are composed of two to three horizontal sections only seen from the interior (Figure 9). 
Room 1 has a 30-cm-high bench oriented north­east-southwest that bisects the room into front and back halves. Both halves have 3-to 5-cm-thick plastered floors prepared over sterile soil, which show few use-related alterations. Room 1 also has four entryways. The main one connects Room I with Room 2. It is l .7 m wide and has a .5-m-high two-sided step. There are also two lateral entry­ways. The excavated entry is .95 m wide and has a .53-m-high step. Finally, there is a fourth entryway, located in the southeastern wall, approximately 95 cm wide. The walls of Room I had traces of a pale yellow paint. 
The Sunken Circular Court. A Sunken Circular Court was built approximately 20 m northwest of the First Structure (Figures 7, 10). As seen before, its construction implied the excavation and removal of soils and their partial disposal as a fill that was used to build a platform ring that surrounds the court's edge. The presence of cultural material in the ring fill reveals the disturbance of occupational levels during the court's construction, suggesting that this construction might have been preceded by an earlier occupation. In contrast, the construction of the First Structure over sterile soil suggests an

original, foundational event. Therefore, it is possi­ble that the first architectural project only included the First Structure and that the Sunken Circular Court was built as a later addition. Nevertheless, the general design indicates that both buildings functioned together after the sunken court's con­struction. 
The Sunken Circular Court has an inner diam­eter of about 15 m, and according to the floor level and ring summit, it might have had a 1.3-m-high 

inner wall (Figure 7c ). The court has two stairways on its northwest and southeast sides, aligned with the First Structure compound's axis. Stairways have a "trapezoidal" shape and are composed of five steps. 
The Second Structure. Excavations revealed a second construction project, built at the northeast of the First Structure (Figure 11). Its construction blocked the lateral entryway of Room 2, indicat­ing a spatial reorganization. This new project is

named the Second Structure and consists of a two­room compound, oriented to the northwest (azimuth 304°). The rooms of this compound are labeled as Rooms 3 and 4. 
While the southwestern part of this structure might have been built over sterile soil, the north­eastern one required the construction of a 1-m-high platform, in order to keep the floor level. This plat­form was also connected to a prepared outer floor, which possibly surrounded both compounds. In addition, a two-section wall was built over this plat­form, adjacent to the Second Structure compound walls. 
Room 3 has a 5.9-x-2-m inner space. Its walls are 2.1 to 2.4 m high. The southeastern and north­eastern walls have two sections, while the south­western wall is shared by Rooms 3 and 4. Finally, the northwestern wall has a single section and is 25 cm thick. 
Room 3 has a 40-cm-high bench that bisects the excavated space into a northeastern and a south­western section. It is possible, however, that this platform only covered the central area of the room. Both sections have plastered floors prepared over a gravel layer deposited over a fill of shicra bags. Room 3 also has four entryways. Two entryways are placed at the northwestern wall, connecting this room with Room 4. One entryway is 90 cm wide,

while the other is only 45 cm wide. There is another 75-cm-wide entryway in the northeastern wall. Finally, a 50-cm-wide entryway is placed in the southeastern wall, with a lintel composed of an algarrobo beam. 
Room 4 has a 5.9-x-4.1-m inner space. As in Room 3, its walls are 2.1 and 2.4 m high. The north­western wall has three sections. The northeastern wall was badly eroded, preserving the lower sec­tion, which is 1 m high and 70 cm wide. The south­western wall has two horizontal sections. One 
:section is the continuation of Room 3 's southwest­ern wall, which connects with the northeastern wall of Room 2 of the First Structure. The other section consists of a single-faced wall built over the First Structure's outer face, in order to level the inner wall of Room 4. This wall seems to resemble the three­section structure identified in Room 3. 
Room 4 has a 40-cm-high bench that divides the inner space into a small southwestern zone and a large northeastern one. Both zones have plastered floors, possibly of the same characteristics as those of Room 3. This room also has five entryways. The main one is placed in the northwestern wall and is 75 cm wide. The southwestern wall has a narrow 50-cm entryway with a lintel made of two willow (Salix humboliana) beams covered with plaster. On the opposite side, the northeastern wall has a 70­cm-wide entryway. Finally, the back zone has the two entryways shared with Room 3. From Room 4, the larger one has a 40-cm-high step. 
Three rectangular niches were identified in Room 4. One is placed in the northeastern half of the northwestern wall, while two incomplete niches appear in the northeastern wall. Niches are located at a height of 80 cm and are 40 cm wide, 35 cm high, and 35 cm deep. If the niches have a sym­metrical distribution, there might be three more niches in the room's southwestern half. 
The Second Structure was the last architectural project built on the northeastern side of the archi­tectural complex of Cerro Lampay. After its con­struction, the complex acquired its final configuration (Figure 12). Nonetheless, since no extensive excavations were conducted on the south­western side of the mound, the possibility of other structures at the site cannot be discarded. 
Radiocarbon Dating 

In order to get a precise idea of Cerro Lampay's chronological position, as well as the length of time between the construction of the original compound and the entombment process, 27 radiocarbon sam­ples recovered from the excavations were ana­lyzed.4 Five correspond to the original compounds, and 22 correspond to the entombment process. 
The resulting 14C dates and their calendar year ranges are displayed in Table l. With the exception of two samples (AA 58788 and AA 58783), the resulting dates are consistently grouped in a time range between 2400 and 2200 B.C. (Vega-Centeno 2005: 189-199). Consequently, it is possible to con­clude that Cerro Lampay architecture was in use for approximately two centuries. Apparently, the construction events for the first and second com­pounds were close in time, and the entombment process was also conducted in a short time span. We can assume that by 2150 B.C., the site was totally abandoned.

Constructed Space and Human Interaction: 
Spatial Organization of the First Structure 

As noted before, the architectural complex identi­fied at Cerro Lampay was not built in a single event but grew over time, transforming during its devel­opment. Each construction stage implied the mate­rialization of a specific design, which might reveal different patterns of human interaction through the built space. Consequently, each architectural design will be analyzed separately; this will be followed by a synthetic view of Cerro Lampay's architecture. 
To address the behavioral implications of the First Structure design, the defined spaces and their later additions and transformations will be ana­lyzed through two different approaches. One approach is related to the spatial structure, defined by the number of built spaces and their access sys­tem. The second approach is related to the sensor­ial experience of built spaces and, in particular, to the visual and kinesthetic experience of space. 
Spatial Structure and Space Syntax 
The spatial structure of the first compound can be addressed using the gamma analysis proposed by Hillier and Hanson (1984 ). As noted before, the sig­nificant variable of this analysis is the degree of per­meability among the spaces in a building, which is manifested in four properties: symmetry, asym­metry, distributedness, and nondistributedness. Both sets of properties can also be addressed through specific indexes that measure the relative asymmetry (RA) and relative ringiness (RR) of a given building. 
The Carrier Space 
Gamma analyses at Cerro Lampay require a pre­vious discussion of the carrier space. According to Hillier and Hanson ( 1984:66-67), the carrier space is the continuous and infinite space that surrounds the finite spatial units defined by a building. While this concept provides a "container" that allows eval­uation of the architectural units within a larger spa­tial milieu, it presupposes that all the nonbuilt surroundings of such units form part of a plain and undifferentiated landscape. The application of this notion of carrier space might simplify the nature of the space that surrounds the standing architec­ture at Cerro Lampay. As seen before, Cerro Lam­pay's buildings stand on a dry ravine, looking to

the northwest, toward the valley plain. The moun­tain ranges that form the ravine appear on its sides, and a residential zone spreads behind the building over a higher terrace that was delimited at a certain moment by a long wall that ran across the ravine. 
The location of the residential zone as well as the wall construction suggest that the area behind the architecture was more than just a part of an undifferentiated carrier space. Furthermore, the entryway placed on the southeast side of Room 1 allowed direct access to the First Structure from the residential zone. This articulation between the res­idential zone and the architectural units strongly suggests that the former was a significant area that might be differentiated from the carrier space. 
In addition, if the rear entryway defines a sig­nificant area, we can also consider that the lateral entryways in Rooms 1 and 2 might have served to define other areas. The areas that extend on both sides of the structure correspond to ravine sections that are oriented toward the surrounding moun­tains, featuring a totally different landscape than the one observed toward the valley. The distinction between these areas was enhanced when the square courtyard that surrounded the Sunken Circular Court was delimited and defined the new area in front of the First Structure. 
Consequently, for analytical purposes, I evalu­ate the spatial organization of Cerro Lampay build­ings using different scenarios for the carrier space. 
Downloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core. YBP Library Services, on 22 Aug 2018 at 17:33:19, subject to the Cambridge Core terms of use, available at https://www.cambridge.org/core/terms. https://doi.org/10.7183/1045-6635.21.2.115 

In addition to a scenario based on the original def­inition, I will also consider several scenarios in which the carrier space corresponds basically to the area that extends to the northwest, between the architectural structures and the valley plain. In such scenarios, the areas that spread to the sides and behind the structures can be treated as spaces that need to be differentiated for a gamma analysis. 
The First Structure 

In the previous section, the architecture of the First Structure was described, noting how Room 1 and Room 2 are articulated by several entryways that include both frontal/rear and lateral entryways. Five scenarios are proposed in order to evaluate the spa­tial organization of the First Structure. One of them (Figure 13a) assumes a surrounding carrier space, while in the other cases the carrier space is restricted to the area in front of the structure. Among these four scenarios, two of them include rear and lateral zones (Figure 13b-c ), while the other two assume a subdivision within the lateral zones, according to their articulation with the lateral accesses of Room 1 or 2 (Figure 13d-e). I have also distinguished between scenarios where access from the carrier space to the lateral zones is allowed (Figure 13b, d) or denied (Figure 13c, e). 
RA indexes for these scenarios (see Table 2) show a tendency for low to moderate degrees of asymmetry (from .2 to .5), with the exception of the scenario illustrated in Figure 13a that shows a total lack of asymmetry. In contrast, RR indexes show mainly moderate degrees of distributedness (from .54 to .57), with a case of high dist1ibuted­ness (of .85 [see Figure 13b]) and an extremely dis­tributed case (Figure 13a). 
The First Structure and the Sunken Circular Court 
The building of the sunken court also implies the building of a larger, leveled courtyard, as well as a low platform between the courtyard and the First Structure. As a consequence, a new spatial orga­nization appeared. The new architectural config­uration was evaluated through gamma analyses that considered the same five scenarios suggested for the First Structure (Figure 14a-e ). As a result, it was possible to note an increase in RA indexes, which ran from .46 to .6, as well as a decrease in RR indexes, now ranging from .38 to .54 (Table 3). Noticeably, the scenario that assumes a sur­rounding carrier space shows an RA of .1 and an RR of 1.

Built Space and Sensory Experience 
Human interaction within the built space is deter­mined not only by the boundaries and internal access systems but also by the perceptions gener­ated in the experiencing of space. In archaeologi­cal contexts such as Cerro Lampay, the visual and kinesthetic experiences can be feasibly addressed. 
The visual experience of the Room 1 space, when accessed from the frontal or the rear entry­way, is dominated by the perception of wideness

and low depth (Figure 15). In contrast, access from the lateral entryways is dominated by a perception of narrowness and a heightened sense of depth. In addition, the bench that bisects the inner space is low enough ( .30 m) to allow passage over it but high enough to provide a perception of elevation or depression, according to the viewer's position. 
In terms of kinesthetic experience, the frontal access of Room 1 is wide enough ( 1. 7 m) to allow easy displacement toward the inner space. The lat-

eral and rear accesses are considerably narrower (.95 m), suggesting a more restricted flow; access width does not seem to appear as a significant ele­ment for displacement restrictions. In contrast, it is significant that frontal and lateral accesses are asso­ciated with .5-m-high steps, which could also exist in the rear entryway. They contrast with common steps, which tend to be .2 to .3 m high in order to facilitate human displacement. Consequently, the particular height of the entryways' steps seems to have been deliberately designed to restrict the access through a physical constraint on human movement. 
Due to its square plan, the visual structure of Room 2 provides a more balanced experience of width and depth (Figure 16), which might have been complemented by the perception of elevated or depressed plans, through one or more benches. The increase of depth experience from the frontal access is also enhanced by the more distant loca­tion of the lateral entryways, which are closer to the rear wall. Within Room 2, Room 1 becomes a distant, rear zone, which also can be distinguished through color, as Room 1 was painted with yellow pigments and Room 2's walls were painted with red ones. It is also noteworthy that the frontal access for Room 2 is wider (2.4 m) and has no steps or other kinds of physical constraints on displace­ment. 
The addition of the Sunken Circular Court area enhances the perception of depth within the com­pound through the alignment of the front and rear court stairways with Room 2's frontal access, which forms a visual central axis (Figure 17). From this axis, other spaces are also included, as Room 2's frontal access is wide enough to allow the percep­tion of Room l's frontal access and some of its inner space. In contrast, the lateral entryways of both Room 1 and Room 2 are not perceived from the axis. Consequently, the visual structure perceived from the sunken court outlines the unity of the com­pound, within a deep and centralized space. 
Changes and Continuities with the 
Construction of the Second Structure 

The Second Structure addition implies the disuse of lateral entryways in Room 2. In addition, spa­tial organization became more complex, with the addition of new rooms and lateral terraces.

The cancellation of lateral accesses in Room 2 was reproduced, in a certain way, in the design of lat­eral entryways to Room 3. The southwest entry­way was 1.5 m high and .5 m wide, also having a .5-m-high step. Both its size and its location imply several constraints for physical displacement. In the case of the northeast entryway, the access is even more difficult, as Room 3 stands over a 1-m-high platform and no stairway exists to reach the entry­way's floor. Therefore, kinesthetic constraints seem to suggest that lateral entryways in Room 3 might have had little flow or movement, and they were perhaps just symbolic devices that retained former organizational patterns. Apparently, the increased horizontal differentiation of main spaces, followed by a more centralized inner organization of such spaces, was the consequence of the addition of the Second Structure. 
Cerro Lampay's Design: 
Behavioral and Social Implications 

The above analyses set the stage to evaluate the role of Cerro Lampay's architecture in the interaction that took place between its facilities and those who used them. This interaction was manifested in dif­ferent activities in which the scale, intensity, and nature of individuals' participation reflected and reinforced social identities and social relations (Kertzer 1988; Rappaport 1999; Turner 1969). While it is obvious that one cannot reconstruct the whole set of activities conducted at Cerro Lampay, 
5 7 7 .385 .4118 .4118 
the architectural design allows definition of at least two spheres of human activities. One is related to the movement between spaces and the possibilities of moving to and from certain areas. The other is related to the possibilities of movement and posi­tioning within a certain space. Both spheres pro­vide information on the scale and degree of differentiation among the participants in an activ­ity and their interaction. 
In regard to the movement and accessibility

between spaces. gamma analyses reveal that the original design of Cerro Lampay architecture had a low degree of spatial hierarchy and centralization in its access system. The existence oflateral entry­ways, as alternative paths to entryways located on a central axis, is a major factor for such a situation. 

As seen before, Room 1 has an access system with four different and alternative entryways. Rather than a random, nonregulated access sys­tem, this system seems to be a device to differen­tiate groups of participants, according to the entryway they use to enter or exit Room I. Entry­ways can only bring participants into two inner subspaces: the upper plane defined by the bench or the lower plane in front of the bench. Only those entering Room 1 through the rear entryway were directly on the bench plane, while the lateral and frontal entryways conduct to the lower plane. Therefore, the location of entryways leading toward different planes might indicate a vertical differen­tiation among participants, while the alternative entryways for the same plane reinforce the exis­tence of horizontal distinctions in the same sce­nario. 
In addition, Room 1 seems to have been a highly significant space, which implies devices for restrict­ing access, with high steps that provided the expe­rience of a dramatic spatial displacement from outside to inside. Inside the room, the wide visual structure might have oriented individuals to stand­ing positions (unlike deep visual structures that invite frontward movement), possibly promoting a

close face-to-face relation between individuals above and below the bench. 
Both horizontal and vertical differentiations seem to be reproduced in Room 2's design, as is also suggested by gamma analyses. Nevertheless, there is a significant differentiation in the location of lateral entryways, which are closer to the rear entryway. Furthermore, according to the inferred floor levels, the rear and lateral entryways might have been at an upper plane in relation to the frontal entryway. In addition, the size and shape of Room 2 increase the distance between the front entryway and the other ones. Thus, several devices reinforce the separation of the frontal zone of Room 2, reached from the front access, and the rear zone associated with the lateral entryways and Room 1 access. 
This separation might have enhanced the dis­tinction between those participants who could reach the rear zone and those who could not. More­over, the square shape of Room 2 provides a more neutral scenario for standing or moving. Therefore, it seems to have been designed for a different set of activities, probably involving more movement and a larger number of individuals than those who could get into Room I. It is noteworthy that no spe­cific devices constrained the movement through Room 2's front entryway, and no recognizable physical remains of barriers were recorded. This suggests that Room 2 was a less restricted space than Room 1. 
If the Sunken Circular Court area was added to the First Structure in a second construction stage, it would imply that important changes took place in the nature of participation within the architec­tural space. As gamma analysis indicates, its pres­ence increased the hierarchy and centrality of the spatial structure, particularly for those who entered the compound from the carrier space. Its access sys­tem oriented participants toward a central axis, without lateral alternatives, providing only a verti­cal distinction. Furthermore, horizontal distinctions that existed within the structure could not be appre­ciated from the outside. It seems that such distinc­tions only worked inside the structure but not within the Sunken Circular Court area. 
In sum, the original architecture of Cerro Lam­pay consisted of three different spatial spheres, probably built during a short-term sequence, which involved not only different numbers of participants but also different degrees of vertical and horizon­tal differentiation among them, as well as different sets of activities. The articulation of different spaces suggests that participants were divided into sub­groups as they entered different spheres. Thus, after certain activities were conducted in the Sunken Cir­cular Court, a subgroup was able to access the First Structure through Room 2's main access. Other subgroups might have entered the same room through the lateral entryways. Inside Room 2, spe­cific activities might have taken place, including the movement toward the rear zone to get into Room 1. Room 1 could also be reached by two other groups using the lateral entryways and a final group entering through the rear entryway. Then, the room's size and shape oriented a face-to-face stand­ing position of participants for the conduct of another set of activities. 
According to gamma analyses, the architectural changes produced by the building of the Second Structure involved an increased centralization in the access systems within compounds but a less hier­archical organization of the overall architecture. Both the First and Second structures' facades and entryways could be observed and reached from the Sunken Circular Court area, but lateral entryways were hard to reach, when still in use, in the com­pounds' front rooms (i.e., Rooms 2 and 4). 
These changes can be understood as the shift of horizontal differentiation devices to a more visible area. Such a shift indicates new dynamics in the nature of individuals' participation while passing through the Sunken Circular Court area, with alter-

native pathways toward the First and Second struc­tures, where, in contrast, horizontal differentiation devices were reduced through abandoning lateral entryways or transforming them into mere figura­tive or symbolic elements. Thus, the former hori­zontal differentiation among individuals seems to have been transferred to more open, public spaces, a change that might imply a different organization of the activities conducted within rooms and court­yards. 
As discussed above, Cerro Lampay architecture is located within a ravine, limited by mountain ranges on its lateral sides, while its frontal zone faces the Fortaleza Valley floodplain. It is also closely related to the residential zone, placed behind Room l. Furthermore, there is a direct connection between the Room 1 rear entryway and this domes­tic zone. These characteristics cast doubt on the applicability of the notion of carrier space­understood as an undifferentiated surrounding landscape-for gamma analysis and suggest the possibility of alternative scenarios, where the car­rier space was differentiated from nonbuilt areas that, according to the relation to social or natural landmarks, might have acquired specific signifi­cance. 
One possibility is that the inclusion of several entryways within Cerro Lampay structures was related to differential access patterns for two pos­sible kinds of participants: the local inhabitants of Cerro Lampay's ravine, who were able to access the buildings from the rear entryways, and the inhabitants of other settlements from outside the ravine, who could come from the valley floor or even farther and faced the frontal zone, with the sunken court and the frontal access of Room 2. 
I propose that this distinction between partici­pants fits the inferred vertical differentiation out­lined by gamma analyses. In addition, the repetitive horizontal differentiation in access systems for Rooms 1 and 2, with a decrease of such differen­tiation as one moves toward the sunken court, sug­gests that these spaces were more related to the local participants than to outsiders. It is noteworthy that such differentiations started with devices placed within the rooms of the First Structure and then acquired more visible manifestations through the construction of the Second Structure. In both cases, the Sunken Circular Court appeared as the first architectural space for outsiders, with a consistent structure of unity and centralization. 

Room 1 is the spatial unit most intimately related to the local sphere. As noted above, it outlines not only horizontal distinctions but also vertical ones according to the displacement and location of par­ticipants. These distinctions suggest the existence

of heterogeneity within the local group. Nonethe­less, the patterns of congregation activities per­formed in the structures show a contrasting scenario, in which unity and homogeneity were reinforced for outsiders while horizontal differen­tiation was outlined for local members. Such behav­ior can be representative of a community, understood as an ever-emergent social institution that generates and is generated by suprahousehold interactions that are structured and synchronized by a set of places within a particular span of time (Yaeger and Canuto 2000:5). 
As a community, Cerro Lampay inhabitants might have built a ritual facility in order to host and interact with neighboring communities. Such a facility displayed to outsiders the idea of unity and homogeneity held by residents of Cerro Lampay. At the same time, the facility provided spatial devices to outline horizontal and vertical differen­tiation among the community members. It is sig­nificant that devices such as paired entryways suggest that participants were organized into halves for accessing the rooms. If ritual organization repro­duced social organization, these devices suggest that the community might have had a dual struc­ture. 
It is significant that dual devices always appear as attachments to a central, unitary or "consensual" space, as the lateral entryways complement the front/back entryways that constitute the central axis of the complex. This pattern suggests that the archi­tectural design expressed the idea of communal unity while including devices to denote divisions within the whole. 
It is important to note that, due to its polysemic nature, dualism needs to be evaluated within the specific behavioral contexts in which it appears, before assuming broad social implications of its presence. In the case of Cerro Lampay, dualism seems to appear within ritual performances, in what seems to be the statement of participants' social sta­tus or position. Thus, it appears to be strongly related to self-referential messages about individ­uals' membership, but the significance of dualism in other dimensions of the Cerro Lampay commu­nity's life still remains to be evaluated. 
For the moment, based on the architectural design of Cerro Lampay structures, I propose that the social group that built and used such structures constituted a self-identified community with an emergent leadership and an internal division that suggest a dual organization during ritual perfor­mances. The possible existence of a dual organi­zation within the Cerro Lampay community is particularly significant because it may imply a par­ticular scenario for the emergence of leaders, power positions, and centralization. It is well known that the ritual roles played within a dual structure usu­ally imply competition and cooperation scenarios among the involved groups and their leaders. More-

over, dualism is usually a mechanism that regulates and controls the centralization of power and wealth within communities. 
A Regional Perspective 
To evaluate the social scenario inferred from Cerro Lampay within a regional context, it is important to assess whether the architectural design defined at Cerro Lampay, a two-room structure with mul­tiple entryways, corresponds to a broader archi­tectural tradition within the late Archaic occupations of the Peruvian North Central Coast. Unfortunately, although there are some 30 late Archaic sites with public architecture in the For­taleza, Pativilca, and Supe valleys that can be related to Cerro Lampay, most of them remain unexcavated, and surface evidence is in most cases insufficient for comparative analyses. Information on architecture from excavation is available for the sites of Aspero, Chupacigarro, and Cara!, all in the Supe Valley. 
A.spero 
The Aspero settlement spreads over 13.2 ha and is composed of an extensive midden area interrupted by at least six major platform mounds (Moseley and Willey 1973:460). Excavations were conducted in three of these mounds by Robert Feldman ( 1980), who reported significant results for the mounds named Huaca de los fctolos and Huaca de los Sacri­ficios. 
A main feature of Huaca de los fctolos's design is the presence of three rooms with shared walls and independent, east-oriented entryways. The stratigraphic correlation of these rooms with other architectural features is difficult to establish due to limited excavations beyond the rooms themselves (Feldman 1980:79). The most significant feature is a set of 2.25-m-high walls defined as "D" walls, which had foundations built at the same level as the lower floor of Room 3-5 (Feldman 1980:79-81). These walls form a 13.6-x-13.4-m courtyard, with a 2.5-m-wide central access and two mmower, lateral entryways. 
Feldman's (1980:80) excavations revealed the existence of several cross walls between the court­yard access and Room 3-5. However, it is not clear if the foundations of these walls lay at the same floor level as the original Room 3-5 or the large room walls. By assuming that they corresponded to the original design, Feldman ( 1980:82, 107) considers that access to the central rooms showed highly con­trolled admittance through a "circuitous route," as presented in his isometric reconstruction. 

By contrast, if we consider the possibility that those walls were later additions, the original archi­tectural design appears as containing a front, large room with three entryways, associated with three rooms and perhaps only one at the beginning. The overall structure may have covered a ca. l 9-x-15­m area. 
Chupacigarro 
The site of Chupacigarro, formerly known as Chu­pacigarro Centro (Williams and Merino 1979:209-210), is a 9.4-ha settlement composed of several platform mounds. The largest architec­tural complex has been named the "Temp lo Mayor" and is composed of several rooms, recently exca­vated by a team directed by Ruth Shady (2001:13-15). As of yet, no complete report on the Chupacigarro excavations has been published. Nev­ertheless, an approximate idea of its architectural design can be inferred from brief reports and a scale model prepared by the Archaeology Museum of San Marcos University (Shady 2001: 15, 2006:56-57). 
At the complex's southern extreme, there is a rectangular room with a bench that divides the inner space into a southern and a northern half. Another structure was built in front of this room and is divided by a central bench. There is a third large room, which is also divided by a wall into a rear and a front space. The rear area is a narrow room with one front entryway, two lateral entryways, and three back entryways. The front area has lateral benches and, apparently, only a front and a back entryway. A circular fire pit was placed in the mid­dle of this room. There is a third section composed of a long platform that connects the compounds to a sunken circular court (Shady 2001:15; Shady et al. 2000:36; Williams and Merino 1979:209-210). 
Caral 
Cara! (formerly Chupacigarro Grande) is one of the largest late Archaic settlements in the Supe Valley, with seven major platform mounds and several minor compounds spread throughout a 58-ha area. Excavations conducted by Ruth Shady (2001,

2006; Shady and Leyva 2003) have provided important data on Caral architecture and particu­larly on three buildings: the Templo de la Ban­queta, the Temp lo del Anfiteatro, and the Piramide Mayor. 
At the Templo de la Banqueta, excavations revealed a small two-room structure associated with two rectangular courts. The structure covers a ca. 6-x-6-m area and is also composed of a rear and a front room. The front room had frontal, lateral, and rear entryways. The rear room has a central bench and a thinner wall section at the center of the back wall, as well as a false entryway (Shady 1997:39-40, 2001:23-24). 
The Templo del Anfiteatro is the most promi­nent building of the southern sector of the Caral complex, having the largest sunken circular court at the site. This court has two stairways, one of which connects it to the central structure at the back zone (Shady 2001:18-19; Shady et al. 2003a:Fig­ure 1). 
The central structure at the Templo del Anfiteatro has a rear and a front room. Neverthe­less, in contrast to other buildings, the connection between these rooms includes a stairway, because of the rear room's higher location. Excavations within the front room revealed several construction levels. During the last construction stage, the room had a ca. 20-x-20-m area and included at least three low platforms or benches of a U-shaped form. There is a circular fire pit at the center of the front room, close to the room's frontal access (Shady 2001:20; Shady et al. 2003b:Figure 1). 
The Piramide Mayor of Caral is the largest building in the northern half of the settlement. It is composed of a 20-m-high stepped platform asso­ciated with a sunken circular court (Shady 2001:25-27,2006a:37-39). Excavations atthe plat­form summit revealed a complex set of rooms and entryways that are only partially understood (Shady 2001:25-27; Shady and Machacuay 2003). There is a room at the center of the summit, ca. 9 x 5 m, with niches in its walls (Shady 2001 :27). In front of this room, an 18-x-17-m room defined as an "atrium" (Shady and Machacuay 2003:Figure 2) was built facing a large stairway that connects the pyramid's summit with its base. It also has lateral entryways, as well as a back entryway. Its inner space is divided into several levels through the con­struction of at least five low platforms or benches built in a U-shaped plan around a fire pit area. The summit was connected to the ground via a 9-m­wide and 18-m-high stairway, which reaches the sunken circular court after a 30-m drop (Shady 200 1:26). 
Architectural Patterns and Traditions 
The prior review reveals that the architectural design identified in Cerro Lampay structures can also be identified in sites of the Supe Valley (Fig­ure 19). Arrangements like the one identified at the First Structure of Cerro Lampay (CLl) appear at Huaca de los fdolos (A-HI) and Huaca de los Sac­rificios (A-HS) at the site of Aspero. Similarly, they appear at Chupacigarro (Ch) and at the Templo del Anfiteatro (C-TA) and the Piramide Mayor (C-TM) of Caral. 
The sizes and proportions of the rear rooms are quite similar within these structures (see Table 5). They frequently include benches that divide the inner space into halves ( CLl, A-HI, Ch, C-TA) and can have more than one entryway (CLl, Cb). 
Front courts also show regularity in their pro­portions, as square spaces. Their size, however, can vary significantly. They always have a front and a back entryway and frequently show lateral entry­ways (CLl, A-HI, A-HS, Ch; C-TM). Their floors are seldom uniform and include back and lateral benches. They tend to have a circular fire pit located close to the front entryway (A-HS, Ch, C-TA, C­TM). In the case of the largest rooms, inner plat­forms are arranged in a U-shaped plan, surrounding the central front area and the fire pit (Ch, C-TA, C­TM). 
Buildings that resemble the Second Structure of Cerro Lampay (CL2) appear at A-HI and Ch, as well as at the Templo de la Banqueta (C-TB) of Caral. These structures show similar scale and pro­portions (Table 6), with the exception of one struc­ture at Chupacigarro, which is significantly larger and seems to have been a former "front court," sub­divided into two areas in a later building stage. The structures of this type can have multiple entryways (CL2, Ch, C-TB). They can also show niches in their walls (CL2, A-HI) and benches that divide the inner space (CL2, C-TB). 
Apparently, sunken circular courts are related to the first type of structure, although they do not always appear, like at the site of Aspero. There is

Analyses of the spatial structure and the perceptual 
structure of the architecture of Cerro Lampay pro­
vided significant insights into the behavioral impli­
cations of the building's design. 
These behavioral implications support a sce­nario in which ritual activities were accomplished through community organization on the basis of a rising leadership. Nevertheless, the architectural evidence does not suggest a highly formalized hier­archy but, rather, that power positions within the community could have been negotiated through ritual practices that included the dual organization of participants. In addition, ritual activities were the arena in which the local community interacted with neighboring populations. For these populations, the facade of the building displayed a message of the community's unity. This scenario offers new possibilities for the study of the emergence of com­plex forms of sociopolitical organization on the North Central Coast of the Andes. 
It has been noted previously that Cerro Lampay is one example of a larger phenomenon in the devel­opment of large-scale architecture within the Peru­vian North Central Coast. Indeed, more than 30 sites with large-scale architecture located in the valleys of Fortaleza, Pativilca, and Supe can be assigned to the late Archaic period. Although the number of excavated sites is still limited, the 

reviewed cases indicate that the two-room struc­
ture identified at Cerro Lampay might correspond to a basic architectural arrangement that charac­terized the late Archaic public buildings of the North Central Coast. Hence, it is necessary to eval­uate the applicability of the inferred scenario of Cerro Lampay to other cases. 
In that sense, it is significant that, besides the presence of the two-room structure, public build­ings like the Templo Mayor of Chupacigarro, the Templo del Anfiteatro of Caral, or the Piramide Mayor of Caral show very complex arrangements. At Chupacigarro, several spaces are connected to the original structure along a longitudinal axis. At the Templo del Anfiteatro, a perimetric wall encloses an area in which the two-room structure appears. This area includes restricted spaces for ritual and residential uses (Shady 2006a:40; Shady et al. 2003b ). A similar case appears at the top of the Piramide Mayor, where several ritual spaces with restricted accesses are placed on both sides and behind the two-room structure (Shady 2006b: 18; Shady and Machacuay 2003). 
It seems clear that the inferred scenario for Cerro 
Lampay results is insufficient to explain more elab­
orated ritual buildings such as those of Caral or 
Chupacigarro. These buildings suggest the exis­
tence of more formalized elite groups, with exclu­
sive ritual spaces located in restricted areas. The 
association of these spaces with elite residences 
(Flores 2006) supports the idea of a more clear dif­
ferentiation between elite and commoners within 
ritual buildings at Cara!. 
This architectural comparison reveals that it is a mistake to homologize the social organization of the human groups that inhabited the North Central Coast during the late Archaic period as a single type. On the contrary, it seems to be more productive to search for the different trajectories that led to these contrasting scenarios. 

In regard to these trajectories, radiocarbon dates at Caral indicate that it had a much longer occu­pation than Cerro Lampay (up to 1,000 years since 3000-2000 B.C. [Shady et al. 2001]). Nonethe­less, the dates that come from the reviewed archi­tectural contexts correspond to the second half of the third millennium B.C. and, thus, are roughly contemporaneous with those of Cerro Lampay (Shady et al. 2001; Vega-Centeno 2005:310-312). This means that the structures of Cerro Lampay might have coexisted w1th the last cons trnction stages of buildings like the Templo del Anfiteatro and the Piramide Mayor. A tentative explanation for the possible relationship among these sites is proposed in the following lines. 
As mentioned before, survey has allowed the identification of up to 40 sites with platform mounds and sunken plazas within the Fortaleza, Pativilca, and Supe valleys. Based on these archi­tectural characteristics, sites in the Fortaleza Val­ley were placed into two categories: isolated structures and architectural complexes. The latter consist of more than one structure within each site (Vega-Centeno et al. 1998:223). A similar scenario has been reported for the Supe Valley. Shady and her colleagues (2000: 17-20) defined 17 late Archaic sites with large-scale architecture and note that they could be divided into five categories, according to their size and construction activities. 
If the architectural units identified in the Fort­aleza or Supe sites are also manifestations of com­munal entities like the one inferred from Cerro

Lampay, two possible scenarios should be consid­ered for the concentration/dispersion of architec­tural units within settlements and throughout the valleys. In one, there might have been a process of aggregation of different communities within a sin­gle site, as a product of specific social and/or polit­ical factors. The other scenario is of the gradual growth of a communal entity and the rise of "daugh­ter communities" that started to build their own rit­ual spaces nearby or far away from the original communal emplacement. These scenarios are nei­ther exclusive nor contrary but. require a clear assessment of the history and chronology of each of the studied sites in order to be tested. 
Finally, the widespread occurrence of public architecture during the late Archaic period in this region is a remarkable phenomenon that requires further commentary. It is highly probable that the residents of the North Central Coast valleys dur­ing the late Archaic were in constant and intense interaction, which may have resulted in displays of competition and emulation (Renfrew 1986) in rit­ual settings. This dynamic process explains the for­mal homogeneity of ritual architecture within the region, as well as the scale and complexity of sites such as Caballete, Porvenir, Cara!, and Pueblo Nuevo, which appear as some of the most dynamic and/or successful peers within the North Central Coast. Even a relatively small site like Cerro Lam­pay was significantly oriented toward outsiders, with specific architectural features that displayed messages of community unity within a wide con­gregational space. In other words, the design of rit­ual architecture at Cerro Lampay provided a means to assert the community's identity and status to neighboring groups. Further exploration of con­temporary sites will allow further testing of these ideas about public architecture and sociopolitics in this dynamic period and region in Andean history.

Notes 

1. 
The index of relative asymmetry (RA) is defined as RA = (2[MD -l])/(K -2), where MD is the mean depth (calcu­lated after adding the number of spatial units weighted by their depth level) and K is the number of spatial units or cells in the structure (including the carrier space). The index of rel­ative ringiness (RR) denotes how, when there is more than one pathway connecting two units, the second pathway is rep­resented by an encircling ring, indicating how distributed (i.e., noncentralized) the spatial organization is. RR = r/(2p ­5), where r is the number of rings identified in the structure and p is the number of unit cells in the structure (Hillier and Hanson 1984:108-!09, 152). 

2. 
This pattern was latter identified in the Pativilca (Ruiz et al. 2007) and Huaura (Aguilar 2006; Chu 2008). 

3. 
The term entombment was originally used to explain the burying of ritual structures at the site of Kotosh (Izumi and Matsuzawa 1976) before new buildings were con­structed. In the case of Cerro Lampay, this "entombment" process was followed by the site's abandonment, a phenome­non that has been reported for middle Formative period sites such as Huaca Lucia (Shimada et al. 1982).

Samples were analyzed in the AMS Laboratory of the University of Arizona, in Tucson.
