Changes in various architec­tural complexes symbolize evolving political practices.The urban renewal manifested in the ubiquitous apart­ment compound reflects interactions between the city’srulershipanditscitizens;however,someoftheinterpre­tationsaretenuous.Excavationofmoreapartmentcom­pounds throughout the city will surely reveal a clearerpicture of the interaction between various segments ofsociety.
In Chapter 7, Bryce Davenport and Charles Goldentacklethematerialmanifestationofpowerandauthorityas expressed in landscape boundaries of the Maya andMixtec peoples. The rich historical and ethnographicrecords are effectively used in combination with thearchaeological record to elucidate an understanding oftheconsistenciesandcontradictionswithinancientpoli­ties. The boundary concept nicely connects the periph­eral household and milpa to the center, and commonersto elites. This chapter was one of the most useful in thevolume. 
Helen Perlstein Pollard’s research on the Tarascans of Western Mexico (Chapter 8) expands the geograph­icalandchronologicalcoverageofthevolume.Thoughthere is evidence for human occupation that spans cen­turies in the Pátzcuaro Basin, the Tarascan empire wascentralized only just before the area was conquered bythe Spanish. The judicious use of ethnohistoric docu­mentsandarchaeologicalevidencestrengthenstheinter­pretations of how ruling elites manipulated ethnicidentity and religion as political weapons to controlaccess to leadership and how commoners fared duringthe evolution of the polity.
Simon Martin (Chapter 9) concludes the volumewithathought­provokingsynthesisoftrendsinstudyingancientpoliticalsystemsthatisoneofthebestsummarychapters I have seen for an edited volume. Rather thansimply acknowledging each contribution, he takes uson a journey that situates the authors’ contributionswithin the larger framework of archaeological thoughton ancient politics. Martin’s critique of the usual sus­pectsinprocessualandpost­processualcampsprovidesa succinct review of how archaeologists use, and haveused, theory to further our understanding of culturalphenomena. This reflective chapter serves the readerwell,asitgoesfaraboveandbeyondthesubjectmatterof the volume.

InClassicMayaPolitiesoftheSouthernLowlands:Inte­gration, Interaction, Dissolution, Damien B. Markenand James L. Fitzsimmons bring together “a group ofyoungerscholars”toexaminethenatureofClassicperiodMaya polities at multiple scales (p. 4). The chapters inthevolumesprungfroma2009DumbartonOaksround­tableandcoveravarietyofthemesandtopics.Asestab­lished in the introductory chapter by Marken andFitzsimmons, the editors situate the volume at the endofacentury­olddebateabout“towhatdegreewereMayapolities centralized or decentralized” (p. 3), and theauthors explore themes “from internal polity identitiesand organization to polity boundaries and larger extra­polity networks” (p. 4).

The rest of the volume is clearly organized along aspectrum from bottom­up to top­down approaches tostudying various aspects of Maya polities. Serving asbookends to the two extremes of this spectrum areBrigitte Kovacevich’s examination of household craftspecialization at Cancuen (Chapter 2) at one end andSarahE.Jackson’sstudyofroyalcourtsandwrittenland­scapes(Chapter9)attheother.FollowingKovacevich’schapterareTimothyMurtha’scomparisonofsettlementand spatial organization at Tikal, Guatemala, and Cara­col,Belize(Chapter3);aconsiderationofpoliticalinter­action as seen from the farming community of Chan,Belize, by Cynthia Robin and colleagues (Chapter 4);andMarken’sstudyofthespatialpatterningoftheurbancoreandperipheryofElPerú­Waká,Guatemala(Chapter5). These chapters proceed from a bottom­up approachwith Marken’s chapter serving as a natural segue to thesecond half of the volume.

Although the volume embraces both bottom­up andtop­downapproachestostudyingMayapolities,thereisasubtleundertonethatseemstofavortheformer.Infact,Jackson in Chapter 9 seems both apologetic and defen­sive in her introduction andconclusion for employing atop­down approach.
For the most part, the individual contributions arestrong; they are well presented, well argued, and wellwritten. They also provide new insight into variousaspects of Maya political and social organization andexplorethequestionofMayacitiesandsettlementsfrommultiple scales and perspectives. In other words, thereis something for every Mayanist in this book. Scholarsinterested in household archaeology and craft special­ization, settlement patterning, and how agrarian com­munities related to larger political institutions will findplenty to consider in the Chapters 2 though 5. Thoseinterestedintherelationshipbetweensiteplansandpol­itics, concepts of urbanism, political history, epigraphy,and royalcourts willlikely findChapters5through9 tobe most useful. 
Thevolume,however,isnotwithoutitsweaknesses.Edited volumes are their own form of agony, as it isoftendifficultfortheeditorstoachieveacoherentfocus and avoid assembling a group of loosely related chap­ters. Classic Maya Polities of the Southern Lowlandwrestleswiththischallenge.Severalstructuralproblemsset the stage for this situation—the introduction doesnot include an overall map showing how the varioussites discussed are distributed across the southern low­lands, which would have been an easy way to situatethem together for the reader, and the volume lacks anintegratedbibliography,whichcontributestotheimpres­sionthateachchapterismeanttostandaloneratherthancontribute to a unified effort—but the chosen context seems to present the biggest challenge to the volume and its authors. As Marken and Fitzsimmons note in Chapter1, therearemany problemswiththedecentral­ized­centralizeddebateandnumerousstudiesshowthat bothhierarchicalandheterarchicalformsofintegrationand organization operated independently and concur­rently in Classic Maya polities. Most of the authors ofthe individual chapters attempt to embrace to variousdegrees the centralized versus decentralized debate.Robin and colleagues present the best treatment of theissue in the introduction to Chapter 4—in many waysthissectionwouldhavemadeastrongerintroductiontothe debate than the one in Chapter 1—ultimately con­cluding, and representing the bottom­up perspective,that“whatismissinginbothpoliticalmodelsistherolesof commoner households and local communities and theirrelationswithlargerpoliticalinstitutions”(p.102).Atthetop­downendofthespectrum,Jacksonconcludes,“Ultimately,thecentralized/decentralizeddichotomyisnotterriblycompellingor,forthatmatter,revealing”(p.259). I think all the authors agree with this statementbutarelefttryingtosituatetheirstudieswithinadebatethat has evolved beyond the original dichotomy in thepast few decades.
Despite these criticisms, the volume is an importantcontributionthataddressestwocurrentlypopulartopicsin Maya archaeology: cities/urbanism and householdarchaeology. Its multi­scalar studies and diverse rangeoftopicswillhavebroadappealtoMayanistsinparticularand scholars of ancient cities in general.
