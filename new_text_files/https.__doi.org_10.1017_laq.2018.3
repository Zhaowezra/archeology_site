Given 
their 
cross-cultural 
and longstanding signi.cance, they are an ideal faunal class through which to study many aspects of prehistoric life. 
Despite their explanatory potential, avifaunal remains are seldom the focus of zooarchaeo­logical analyses. Their identi.cation to species takes greater-than-average effort because birds as a class are species rich, because morphological variation between species is relatively less pro­nounced than in some other classes, and because analysis requires an extensive comparative col­lection. Taphonomic processes can decrease the likelihood that avifaunal remains—which are often less robust than mammalian remains— can be identi.ed to the species level. Avifaunal remains also are susceptible to being overlooked in excavation due simply to inadequate screen sizes. We hope here to demonstrate their analyt­ical value. 
This paper addresses avian use at Paso de la Amada, an Early Formative period (1900– 1000 BC) site on the coast of Chiapas, Mexico. We seek to elucidate what motivations drove bird capture and to understand how bird use articulated with emerging social inequality. The residents of Paso de la Amada were interested in local birds as a food source, for their feathers and bone, and for use in ritual. Although the .rst two of these uses does not appear to have been affected by emerging social inequality, the latter was an avenue through which aggrandizers could af.rm their status at the most elite residence at the site. Here, the taxonomic identi.cations of previously reported avifaunal material from Paso de la Amada (Lesure et al. 2009; 
Steadman 
et al. 2003) 
are 
updated 
with 
newly 
identi.ed 
specimens and are analyzed to address new questions. 


Site and Study Region 
Paso de la Amada is located in the Mazatán municipality 
of 
the 
Soconusco 
region 
(Figures 
1 
and 2;Clark 
1994). 
Occupied 
from 
the 
19th century BC until the beginning of the Late Early 
Formative 
(Figure 
3;Clark 
2004; 
Lesure 
2011a:13), 
it 
is 
recognized 
as 
one 
of 
the 
earliest 
ceremonial centers in Mesoamerica. Clark has argued that the site layout required signi.cant planning, involving standard units of measure, with attention to orientation, alignment, spacing, and size of the buildings, plaza, and ball court (Clark 2004:59). 
A 
quadripartite 
vision 
may 
have informed the construction of a southern plaza, foreshadowing a prominent cosmological organizing principle in later Mesoamerican ide­ology, guided by the belief that the world was structured by four corners and an axis mundi (Clark 2004:59–60). 
The 
earliest 
known 
ball court marks Paso de la Amada as participant in broader Mesoamerican traditions (Hill et al. 1998; 
Lesure 
2011b:119). 

In Mazatán, ranked society is evident by the Locona phase (1650 BC), indicated by the onset of a two-tiered settlement pattern, craft specialization, differential mortuary practices, unequal access to sumptuary goods, and elite and nonelite domestic architecture (Clark 2004:53; 
Clark and Blake 1994:22). 
Hereditary 
status may have developed as a result of aggran­dizers attempting to increase their own pres­tige (Blake and Clark 1999; 
Clark 
and 
Blake 
1994). 

That status was architecturally expressed at Paso de la Amada has been demonstrated by an analysis of platform and non-platform resi­dences, which are generally—but not strictly— synonymous with higher-and lower-status (Blake 1991; 
Lesure 
and 
Blake 
2002). 
Mound 
6(Figure 
1) 
has 
been 
interpreted 
as 
a 
chie.y 
residence with six or more sequential structures, occupied for at least 300 years, and is the most elaborate example of a platform residence at the site (Blake 1991, 
2011:99–109; 
Blake 
and Clark 1999). 
The 
continual 
reinvestment 
in residences at Mound 6, and maintenance of their position and orientation through time, has been taken to suggest the presence of hereditary inequality (Clark 2004:57). 
Although 
the 
struc­
tures at Mound 6 possessed domestic features and refuse deposits like those of neighboring households, they received greater architectural investment than non-platform residences (Blake et al. 2006). 
Their 
features, 
coupled 
with 
their 
large size, suggest that they were both resi­dences and the loci of chief-sponsored gather­ings and ceremonial events (Blake and Clark 1999:67).

Previous research on the vertebrate fauna from Paso de la Amada has indicated that hunting was not highly organized (Wake 2004). 
High 
species richness1 
and low minimum number of individuals (MNI) values suggest that res­idents relied opportunistically on local fauna to supplement the unpredictable availability of agricultural products. Avifauna formed a small part of this supplement. 


Birds in Ancient Mesoamerica 
Birds in prehistoric Mesoamerica were sources of food, bone for raw material, and feathers for decoration. They were incorporated into dedi­catory, foundation, and closure deposits, served as components of ritual performance (e.g. López Luján 1994; 
López 
Luján 
et 
al. 
2012), 
and 
were 
domesticated, tamed, and kept as pets (Álvarez et al. 2005; 
Corona 
Martínez 
2013). 
Their 
sig­
ni.cance is evident in ethnographic and contact-period literature, their depiction in the codices, their iconographic representation through time, and their incorporation in primary archaeo­logical deposits (Aguilera 1985:45–70; 
Benson 
1997:68–92; 
Careta 2001:113–116; 
Corona Martínez 2002, 
2008, 
2013; 
Sharpe 
2014). 

Different types of birds in Mesoamerican religion and mythology symbolized characters, deities, places, abstract ideas, days, and indi­viduals. Early Spanish chroniclers recorded in detail the ways in which they were used in Mex­ican society (Sharpe 2014:318; 
see 
Hernández 
1888 
[1615]; 
Sahagún 
1963 
[1569], 
1997, 
2001 
[1577], 
2002 
[1569]). 
Their signi.cance is clearly demonstrated in the Aztec and Mixtec codices, where they were depicted in association with directions, in day signs and in name signs for people and locations, and as companions of the 13 Day Lords (Boone 2000; 
Sharpe 
2014). 

The Soconusco region is particularly rich in bird species. The Codex Mendoza details that feathers made up the bulk of the tribute exacted by the Aztec empire from this region, with 8,000 “bunches” of feathers required yearly (Códice Mendocino 1964:102–103).

Like other material resources, birds and their primary and secondary products are controllable. Sumptuary rules prohibit the consumption or use of certain types of animals by subsets of the population, and non-local birds acquired through long-distance exchange can be controlled as prestige goods. Restricting access is a means of excluding others, in order to create and maintain social differences. All taxa recovered from Paso de la Amada are presently or were likely to have been locally available. If sumptuary rules were employed, we should expect access to the most desirable birds (i.e., the ‘tastiest,’ those with the most desirable feathers, or those of symbolic signi.cance) to have been controlled by social aggrandizers. 
Three Motivations of BirdCapture 
The three strategies discussed here—sub­sistence, social, and ritual—are seldom com­pletely distinct. Although each motivation for bird capture may be unique, capture is often motivated by more than one goal. This can result in a confusing amalgam of the material correlates of more than one strategy in an assemblage, making it dif.cult to isolate these motivations. To distinguish among them, we distilled a series of material correlates for each use strategy from reports of the avifaunal remains from a number of archaeological sites; examples are provided below. For analytical purposes, we give four aspects of data particular attention: species selected, body part distribution, modi.cation of

Table 1. Archaeological Correlates of Three Motivations for Bird Capture. 
Subsistence  Social  Ritual  
Species  Selection based on caloric value and ease of capture. Focus on large-bodied, gregarious, and/or ground-dwelling species.  Selection based on color or perceived qualities of species, (e.g. sharp talons, hunting prowess, sharp vision, or quick and agile movement).  Selection based on color of feathers, perceived qualities of species, or symbolic associations (e.g. with directions, omens, characters in myth, etc.). Harder-to-procure species may be present (solitary, arboreal, nonlocal).  
Body part  Disarticulated elements. Whole skeleton represented OR bias towards one portion that indicates processing for food (e.g. breast meat removal).  Abundance of elements carrying desirable feathers (e.g. wing) OR distinct lack of these indicating processing and removal to another location.  Whole birds. Articulated parts of a bird (e.g. foot, wing).  
Modi.cation  Butchery and burning.  Cut marks on feather-carrying elements or evidence of skinning. No burning.  Little modi.cation, except in manufacture of ceremonial objects from bird bone. No butchery, unless in removal of articulated  
portions of the individual. No burning, unless in deposit indicating ritual burning.  
Context  Trash. Deposition informal, relatively unstructured. Surrounding matrix contains no evidence of “sacred”  Trash. Deposition informal, relatively unstructured.

material.  material.  

the remains, and the context from which remains were recovered. For each strategy, these criteria form a set of expected material correlates that can be identi.ed in the archaeological record (Table 
1). 

Subsistence Pursuits. Both ecological and nutritional factors motivated the capture of birds for subsistence. Large-bodied, easier-to­capture species are the most desirable relative to the energy expended in capture (Serjeantson 2009:231; 
Tivoli 
2010:133). 
Less 
time 
is 
spent 
processing one large bird than is spent processing many small birds, and it is more ef.cient to cap­ture birds in multiples (Serjeantson 2009:233­
236; Ugan 2005). 
Considerations 
in 
ease 
of 
cap­
ture include sociality, habitat, and seasonality. Ground-dwelling, gregarious species that .ock in large numbers, or that are available year-round, are the easiest and most ef.cient to capture (e.g. certain quail, doves, grebes, ducks). Fattier than other birds, seabirds may be targeted in coastal settings (Serjeantson 2009:233). 
At 
Quebrada 
Tacahuay, on the south coast of Peru, nearly 99 percent of identi.ed avifaunal remains are cormorant (Phalacrocorax spp.), booby (Sula spp.), or pelican (Pelecanussp.; deFrance et al. 2001:420; 
Keefer 
et 
al. 
1998:1833–1834). 
Sim­
ilarly, procurement at Watmough Bay in the Paci.c Northwest focused on ducks (Anatidae; Bovy 2012). 
At 
Tlacuachero, 
an 
Archaic 
period 
shell-mound on the coast of the Soconusco, bird procurement targeted cormorants (Wake and Voorhies 2015). 

Because most birds weigh less than 100 pounds, captured individuals are easily trans­ported. We expect, therefore, to .nd all portions of the skeleton represented in collections resul­tant from subsistence pursuits. Remains should be recovered in a disarticulated state because of cooking and consumption processes. When birds (especially large-bodied) are captured in num­bers, we may expect differential body-part rep­resentation indicating separate processing and consumption areas. At Watmough Bay, a pre­ponderance of wing elements and an absence of

other portions indicate that birds were processed and consumed at the capture site, while their skins were brought back to the community (Bovy 2012:2057). 

In a collection resultant from subsistence pursuits we may .nd evidence of both butchery and heat treatment, but these may be relegated to the remains of large birds. Large birds may be dismembered with tools, leaving cut marks (Serjeantson 2009:132). 
Subsequent 
cooking 
may leave burn patterns indicative of heat treatment. Many small birds, however, can be dismembered by hand or cooked whole without dismemberment (Serjeantson 2009:144, 
153). 
Cooking methods such as boiling and stewing leave no visible traces on bones (Serjeantson 2009:153; 
Steadman 
et 
al. 
2002). 
At 
Quebrada 
Tacahuay, an abundance of butchery marks on forelimb and axial elements indicates the removal of breast meat (deFrance et al. 2001:241; 
Keefer et al. 1998:1834). 
Avifaunal 
remains 
from 
a subsistence strategy should be encountered in a disarticulated state in unstructured trash deposits, re.ecting informal refuse disposal. 
Social Use. The term “social use” is employed here to indicate the capture and use of birds for their feathers or bone for the manufacture of objects of personal adornment. These objects can be involved in the creation and reaf.rmation of status through social dis­play. Feathers and bird bone also may be used in the manufacture of utilitarian objects, rit­ual paraphernalia, and in ritual practice. These uses should be considered apart from a social strategy. 
Although feathers are rarely preserved in archaeological contexts, evidence of an inter­est in feathers can be inferred. In an avifau­nal assemblage resultant from a social strategy, species selection should be based on color or the perceived qualities of a given bird. Birds may be subjected to “selection by association” (Serjeantson 2009:186), 
where 
a 
bird 
is 
chosen 
because it is believed that in wearing its feath­ers, its qualities are bestowed upon the wearer. Eagle feathers, for example, have been prized throughout the world because they reference skill in hunting (Serjeantson 2009:186). 
In 
the 
Pueblo 
world, raptorial birds have been revered for their power, sharp vision, and hunting prowess, and are associated with the world above (Tyler 1991). 

Another equally strong selection criterion is feather color, particularly where color is symbolic of a meaningful idea (Serjeantson 2009:186–187). 
The 
extensive 
use 
of 
feathers 
in social display has been documented in the Paci.c Islands, where feathered clothing became a chie.y symbol, and access to feathers was controlled (Kirch 1985:6; 
White 
1985:57). 
Red 
was highly valued because it was associated with chie.y status and prestige (McGovern-Wilson 2005:210). 
At 
Kahikinui 
on 
the 
Hawaiian 
island 
of Maui, bird remains are more densely con­centrated in elite areas, where certain colorful, passerine species were exclusively found (Kirch and O’Day 2003:493). 
At 
the 
Washpool 
Midden 
site in New Zealand, birds with red and white feathers were valued (Leach 1979; 
McGovern-Wilson 2005:212). 

Evidence of the processing of birds for feathers can be seen in the proportional pres­ence or absence of feather-bearing elements in a collection. An overabundance of feather-bearing elements, especially from the wing (ulna, elements of the manus), may indicate the removal of portions of the body to create portable units of feathers. These elements may also include the cranium (supporting crest semi-plumes) and the pygostyle (supporting rectrices). Similarly, a lack of feather-bearing elements may indicate the removal of body portions from a processing location to a consumption area (Serjeantson 2009:200-201). 
Such 
was 
the 
case 
at the Washpool Midden site, where parakeet crania were preserved for their red feathers, and the mandibles of Tui birds were disarticulated to preserve white throat feathers (Leach 1979; 
McGovern-Wilson 2005:212). 
The 
differential 
distribution of the remains of desirable birds across elite and nonelite areas, as well as the exclusive presence of certain species in elite areas, suggests control over access to feathers (Kirch and O’Day 2003:493). 

Modi.cation of avifaunal remains associated with a social strategy should include evidence of skinning or the disarticulation of feather-bearing elements (Serjeantson 2009:202-205), 
and remains should be characterized by little burning. In general, a social strategy should

limit the deposition of avifaunal remains to trash contexts as a byproduct of feather collection. 
Objects manufactured from bird bone can also be used in social display. Many avifaunal elements are thin-walled and hollow, making them ideal for the manufacture of cylindrical objects such as beads. Production waste from the manufacture of these objects may be found in trash, while .nished objects may be found in a variety of contexts as personal belongings. 
Ritual Engagement. The primary motivation of this strategy is to obtain birds for use as offerings in ritual, or whose feathers may be used in the manufacture of ritual costumes and para­phernalia. When involved in ritual performance, birds can be an important component of the visual display of social prestige and the af.rmation of authority. 
Avifaunal assemblages in a ritual strategy should be dominated by species intentionally selected for their color, the qualities they possess, or their symbolic associations. Energy may be directed towards harder-to-procure birds, such as those that are arboreal, solitary, or even nonlocal. These may include birds of prey and brightly colored species such as parrots, two types of birds valued in the Americas (Serjeantson 2009:186– 
187; Tyler 1991). 
An 
assemblage 
resultant 
from 
ritual activity should be dominated by species that are colorful, raptorial, nonlocal, or that held important symbolic associations. At the Templo Mayor of Tenochtitlan, at least 252 birds were buried in temple .ll or placed in boxes. The majority are quail, falcon, and golden eagle (López Luján 1994:307–424; 
2005:102, 
237–338). Raptors and quail were sacri.ced as offerings in the Moon and Sun Pyramids at Teotihuacan (Sugiyama et al. 2015), 
and 
are known from the codices to have been particularly signi.cant to the Aztecs (Sharpe 2014:327–333). 

In a ritual strategy where birds are interred as offerings, complete or nearly complete artic­ulated skeletons should be present in primary, undisturbed contexts. Alternatively, portions of the skeleton may be offered, such as wings or feet. Evidence of modi.cation such as burning or butchery should be minimal. Remains may receive special treatment, placed as foundation or abandonment offerings, treated with pigment or accompanied by other objects, or incorporated with human burials (Russell 2012:54, 
80). 
At 
Pueblo Bonito in Chaco Canyon, scarlet and mil­itary macaws (which are nonlocal) were buried in pits or placed on room .oors (Judd 1954:263– 
264, Pepper 1920:194–195; 
Watson 
et 
al. 
2015). 
In general, the deposition of bird remains in a ritual strategy re.ects a level of planning and intentionality absent from a subsistence or social strategy. 
The three strategies outlined here are often interrelated. A bird may be captured for the use of its feathers but subsequently eaten. Likewise, a bird may be plucked before being interred. Where evidence of one strategy exists, evidence of another may follow. 


Materials and Methods 
The majority of taxonomic identi.cations for the Paso de la Amada avifaunal collection were reported together with those from the nearby site of El Varal by Steadman et al. 
(2003). 
Since that study, an additional 142 specimens (32 percent of the total sample) were located and identi.ed by Bishop and Wake. Two comparative collections were used, both at the University of California, Los Angeles: that maintained by the Zooarchaeology Laboratory at the Cotsen Institute of Archaeology, and the Donald R. Dickey Bird and Mammal Collection. This paper provides an updated report of the entire avifaunal sample—all avifaunal remains recovered—from Paso de la Amada, without the inclusion of the El Varal remains (reported separately in Wake and Steadman 2009). 

The material discussed here was recovered from excavations between 1985 and 1995, and was screened through four or .ve millimeter screens or hand-collected (Clark 1994; 
Richard 
Lesure, personal communication 2014; Stead-man et al. 2003). 
The 
sample 
is 
small, 
species 
richness high, and preservation in this environ­ment relatively poor. For these reasons we rely on number of individual specimens (NISP; see Emery 2004; Lyman 1994; 
Marshall 
and 
Pilgram 
1993; 
Reitz 
and 
Wing 
2008:202–213).

or right, or the highest number of an unpaired element, of a given taxon. MNI was calculated by time phase within each mound. The sample was divided by mound, then further subdivided based on the assigned temporal phase of each excavation context, with the assumption that remains from the same species recovered from the same mound and from contexts with the same temporal assignment could realistically have been from the same individual. 
Supplemental Table 1 presents the sample, differentiating between primary and secondary context. Primary contexts are structured, undis­turbed deposits associated with original surfaces, usually containing partially or wholly articu­lated bird skeletons. Secondary contexts include mound and platform .ll mined from midden material, moved from its original context of deposition and redeposited elsewhere, usually containing disarticulated and unassociated bird remains. 


Results 
Modern coastal Chiapas is home to at least 487 bird species (Howell and Webb 1995). 
The 
inhabitants of Paso de la Amada exploited only 46, less than 10 percent of those likely available to them. The sample is composed of 437 NISP, 173 of which make up four cases of partially or wholly articulated skeletons. All avifaunal remains comprise 1.52 percent of the vertebrate collection (calculated as NISP avian remains over NISP total vertebrates), with an MNI of 79 (Supplemental Table 1). We examine evidence for each strategy in terms of the correlates in Table 
1. 
Unless otherwise noted, we adjusted the NISP value for each of the four articu­lated cases to one, in order to avoid in.ated representation. 
Subsistence Pursuits 
We found scant evidence for intense dietary interest in birds at Paso de la Amada. High species richness suggests that residents did not target a few productive species. Nonetheless, the relationship between intensity of capture (measured as NISP) and distance from the habi­tats from which birds were collected implies some dietary interest. Four general ecological zones surround the site in decreasing proximity: the coastal plain, the savanna, the littoral/estuary, and 
the 
freshwater 
Cantileña 
swamp 
(Figure 
4; 
Clark 1994:58–80; 
Feddema 
1993:8–14). 
Inten­
sity of procurement (measured as the proportion of the avifaunal collection that comes from each ecological zone) decreases with distance from the 
site 
(Figure 
4). 
Half 
of 
the 
taxa 
exploited 
came from the coastal plain (immediately sur­rounding the site), while the other half were acquired from the other three, slightly more distant, zones. 
In the coastal plain, capture focused on what was available at any given moment. High species richness relative to NISP 
(Figure 
4) 
suggests that no particular type of bird was the focus of procurement in this zone; each species is rep­resented by only one to four NISP. A more intentional selection is evident for the savanna, where capture was biased towards members of the genera Colinus and Ortalis (quail and chachalaca), comprising 86 percent of savanna NISP. Quail are gregarious birds that forage on the ground in groups, making them relatively easy to capture. 
In the littoral and estuarine zones, bird capture was more targeted than in the coastal plain, but less than in the savanna. Most of the species from this zone are relatively large-bodied and gregarious, with a focus on migratory winter residents, particularly heron. Procurement from the Cantileña swamp was limited. The majority of specimens representing this zone are muscovy duck, black-bellied whistling duck, and lesser scaup, indicating that ducks were a priority. Birds from the swamp may have been captured during trips to the area for other resources, such as freshwater .sh. Overall, capture adja­cent to the site was ad hoc, while that in fur­ther zones was focused on particular types of birds. 
Because all body portions are well repre­sented in the collection, whole birds were likely brought to the site. Table 
2 
compares body portion representation to expected values by considering the number of elements in each portion of the body of a whole skeleton. Axial elements make up the largest portion of a com­plete skeleton, but they appear to be underrepre­sented at Paso de la Amada. This discrepancy

may in part be due to the differential surviv­ability of more fragile elements like ribs and vertebrae. 
The largest bird (harpy eagle) in the col­lection weighs a maximum of 10 kg, thus all species identi.ed at Paso de la Amada were transportable. Only 19 percent of specimens (n=51) are burnt, while 4.5 percent (n=12) exhibit cut marks. Rather than being associ­ated with gamebirds (e.g. quail, chachalaca), cut marks are instead evident on the remains of two raptors (Accipiter striatus, Harpia harpyja) and one parrot (Ara militaris). Sixty-eight percent of all burning (excluding those identi.ed only as Aves), however, is on the remains of water birds, quail, and chachalaca. Cut marks and burning are found throughout the body, rather than focused on particular elements. An absence of burning or butchery does not mean that birds were not consumed, especially in the case of small birds.

Note: aExpected percent of skeleton was calculated by taking the number of elements expected for each portion of the body in a whole animal, and dividing that number by the total number of elements in the body. The skeleton of Colinus virginianus (northern bobwhite), the most abundantly represented species in the assemblage, was referenced to generate these numbers. 
Rather, most birds that were consumed were likely cooked whole. 
The remains of a single sharp-shinned hawk (Accipiter striatus) support the idea that a bird can be used for its feathers and eaten. As meat is heated by .re, it shrinks away from the bone, producing an exposed portion that becomes discolored (Serjeantson 2009:153). 
A 
unique burning pattern on the right tibiotarsus of this individual indicates roasting of the leg with the meat on. We found a series of scrape marks indicating the removal of skin on the right proximal humerus of this same individual. Because birds possess a desirable layer of fat directly beneath the skin, they are more often plucked in preparation for cooking. Evidence of skinning indicates an attempt to remove the skin for the preservation of feathers (Serjeantson 2009:138). 

Standard zooarchaeological correlates of sta­tus include differential access to type, quality, and quantity of food (deFrance 2009;Emery 
2003; 
Masson 
1999; 
Pohl 
1994; 
van 
der 
Veen 
2003). 
Residents 
do 
not appear to have had differential access to birds based on status during the Locona and Ocós phases. Overall, more bird remains, and a greater richness of species, were recovered from platform (elite) contexts (Table 
3), 
but 
these 
values are biased by the fact that nearly all excavated Cherla phase mate­rial came from platform contexts. When Cherla phase remains are excluded, bird remains are more evenly distributed between platform and non-platform contexts, and species richness is greater in non-platform contexts. These patterns also hold true when values are standardized by excavation volume. Based on these comparisons, there is no evidence of sumptuary rules. 
Social Use 
Several indicators suggest that the inhabi­tants of Paso de la Amada were interested in feathers, although it is unlikely that industri­ous feather procurement was a goal of bird capture. Many of the species in the collec­tion have blue/green feathers. In comparing the proportion of blue/green species at Paso de la Amada to those available in the local environment, a two-sample independent pro­portions test revealed that the difference in the proportion of blue/green birds at Paso de la Amada (11/46 = 23.9 percent) compared to the proportion of blue/green birds locally available today in the Soconusco (96/487 = 
19.7 percent) is not statistically signi.cant at an alpha of .05 (p = .4966, df = 1, X2 = .4622). Thus, it is unlikely that the inhabitants of Paso de la Amada exploited blue/green birds for their feathers signi.cantly more than these birds were available in the wild. Similarly, the difference between an elevated proportion of rap­torial species—which may have been revered for certain qualities—at Paso de la Amada (7/46 = 
15.2 percent) compared to those locally available (37/487 = 7.6 percent) is not statistically signif­icant at an alpha of 0.05 (p= 0.07, df = 1, X2 = 3.2222).

forelimb NISP is normalized by the total num­ber of elements in the wing of a complete bird, these elements have by far the high­est representation. This may indicate an inter­est in the collection of remiges (wing .ight feathers). 
Cutting on the elements of blue/green birds and raptors is not limited to feather-bearing elements, and their remains were not exempt from burning. Birds can, however, be plucked and disposed of or released, leaving no evidence of feather use. The tibiotarsus of one military macaw, recovered from Mound 1, provides evi­dence of an interest in feathers. The placement and nature of a series of parallel cuts on this bone indicate an attempt to detach the skin from the mid-shaft, which would have then been pulled upwards and off of the body, creating a preserved unit of feathers. 
Platform residents do not appear to have had greater access to raptors or blue/green birds than non-platform residents. Although a greater number of remains from these types of birds were 
recovered 
from 
platform 
contexts 
(Table 
3), 
these values are again biased by Cherla phase material. Standardized by excavation volume, platform and non-platform contexts yield similar densities of these types of birds. When Cherla phase remains are removed, and values stan­dardized by excavation volume, non-platform contexts have a greater density of blue/green birds than platform contexts, and the two have identical densities of raptor remains. Feather collection was likely important to the inhabitants of Paso de la Amada, but the use of feathers may have been egalitarian.

The

of 
a

eagle, 
scored 
and snapped on both ends, was recovered from Ocós phase deposits at Mound 6. A series of vertical striations on the bone re.ect the removal of the periosteum, a layer of connective tissue, suggesting that this bone was worked fresh. This indicates that this species was intentionally selected to provide the raw material for the manufacture of a cylindrical object, potentially for symbolic associations related to power or hunting. 
Ritual Engagement 
Four birds at Paso de la Amada were deposited wholly or partially articulated as offerings and were recovered from primary contexts, either on or beneath structure .oors. Structure 4 in Mound 6, dating to the Locona phase, contained three of these individuals (Blake 2011:105; 
Blake 
et 
al. 
2006:197). 
This 
structure 
consisted 
of 
a 
well-prepared, rectangular clay .oor, 20 postholes, and two hearths, situated atop a 1-meter-tall platform. A low clay wall .anked the perimeter of the .oor, forming a semicircle at either end

the

(Figure

and 
on 
either 
side 
was constructed a porch and a long step (Blake 2011:103–105). 
As 
Structure 
4 
was 
closed 
and 
the platform for Structure 3 that overlaid it was prepared, three birds were deposited on top of the clay .oor. The nearly complete skeleton of a green heron (Butorides virescens) was found on the southwest step, and that of an Inca dove (Columbinainca) came from the southern area of the building. The left foot of a northern crested caracara (Caracaracheriway) was placed on the northeast porch (Clark 1994: 
Figure 
95). 
Two 
other offerings were recovered from Mound 6: a greenstone celt from beneath Floor 5 or 6, and a carved deer scapula covered in red pigment from beneath Floor 2, both placed in the center of the building and dating to the Locona phase (Blake 1991:39–42, 
2011:107). 

An additional bird offering comes from Mound 13, where the left and right wings of a yellow-headed or yellow-naped amazon (Ama­zona oratrix or Amazona auropalliata)were

deposited immediately prior to the preparation of a clay .oor (Floor 1). This .oor appears to overlie a 1-meter-tall Locona phase platform (Richard Lesure, personal communication 2014). The ele­ments present and the absence of cut marks suggest that the wings were removed by hand and involved in a dedicatory ritual related to this .oor. 
Layout of theOfferings. The signi.cance of a quadripartite directional system and a lay­ered cosmos in Mesoamerican cosmology is well established (Rice 2004:19–20; 
Thompson 
1970:194–196). 
These 
organizational 
principles 
were routinely and ritually re.ected in the built environment at many levels, through the deposition of artifacts, in building and site lay­out, even on a regional scale (Broda 1982, 
1987;Coe 
1965:107–109; 
Jones 
1998:69–101; 
Mathews and Garber 2004;Rice 
2004:20), 
through intentional alignments and the use of symbolically associated materials (Rice 2004:19–20; 
Thompson 
1970:194–196). 

The vertical ordering of the cosmos was often expressed in the organization of arti­facts and space in ancient Mesoamerica (Broda 1987; 
López 
Austin 
and 
López 
Luján 
2009; 
Mathews and Garber 2004:51–53). 
The 
depo­
sition of the three birds at Structure 4 may have been intended to map the three most basic vertical layers: the upper, middle, and lower realms. In Maya cosmology, north symbolized the sky and the celestial realm, and south was associated with the watery underworld (Ashmore 1989; 
1991:201; 
Coggins 
1980; 
Mathews 
and 
Garber 2004:50). 
On 
the 
front, 
northeast 
porch 
of 
Structure 4, facing the Sierra Madre Mountains and the Tacaná Volcano, was offered the foot of the caracara. The green heron was placed on the back step, facing its watery habitat to the southwest. The Inca dove, a ground-dwelling species, was placed in the interior of the build­ing. Thus, a sky-soaring species was offered to the north (NE), facing the mountains, the volcano, and the direction associated with the celestial realm; an aquatic species was offered to the south (SW), facing its watery habitat and the direction associated with the watery under­world; and a ground-dwelling species, occu­pying this world, was offered in the interior of the structure between these two conceptual layers. 
After their deposition, Structure 4 was cov­ered with a meter-tall platform that served as the foundation for Structure 3. Vertical layering and the division of the world into four quadrants are important components of Mesoamerican cre­ation stories. The recreation of the vertical cos­mos beneath Structure 3 would have marked its inhabitants as incredibly powerful, “animating” or “activating” this sacred space and legitimizing the authority of its re-creators (Mathews and Garber 2004:53, 
56). 

Ritualization atPasodelaAmada. Ritual is one means of both creating and enforcing dif­ferences in status. The location of ritual activity can distinguish it from other acts, and ritual activity can distinguish the physical space in which it occurs. In an analysis inspired by the work 
of 
Catherine 
Bell 
(2009a, 
2009b), 
Lesure 
(2011b) 
reframes 
the 
traditional 
public/private 
and temple/residence dichotomies as formal and informal space. Space can be formalized through the differential use of certain architectural fea­tures (e.g., size, platforms). This formalization elevates the status of the activities taking place in these spaces, and certain activities further distinguish the space as special. In turn, both the nature of the space and certain activities dif­ferentiate the inhabitants of that space. The for­malization of space can thus promote authority and reproduce social power (Lesure 2011b:122). 
All four bird offerings were deposited in formal (platform) spaces, creating a contrast with infor­mal spaces that would have distinguished their deposition. 
Bell 
(2009a) 
considers 
ritual 
through 
the 
eyes 
of practice theory, as ritualization, a process through which particular social actions are dif­ferentiated in relation to other actions (Bell 2009a:74). 
In 
this sense, ritual is constituted in contrast to other activities in strategic ways. Action is ritualized through six potential mech­anisms, including formalism mentioned above. Five of these mechanisms are discernible in the bird offerings at Paso de la Amada: for­malism, traditionalism, rule-governance, sacral symbolism, and performance. The use of these mechanisms con.rms that the deposition of the

offerings was an act strategically distinguished from other acts, marking the bird offerings as products of ritual action. We refer the reader to Bell

each 
of 
these 
mechanisms, 
and

(2014)for

Bird Imagery. The manufacture of ceramic bird ef.gies at Paso de la Amada also illustrates their symbolic importance. That these ef.gies are “naturalistic” rather than stylized (Lesure 2000) 
allows 
them 
to 
be 
identi.ed 
as 
depicting 
certain types of birds, often showing great detail in the eye and beak. Birds depicted at Paso de la Amada include owls, waterfowl, crested birds, 
turkeys, 
vultures, 
and 
raptors 
(Figure 
6). 
Lesure 
(2000) 
concludes 
that 
the 
frequency 
with 
which different types of animals (bird, mammal, .sh, reptile) are modeled as ef.gies does not match their proportional representation in the faunal sample. A preliminary analysis of the bird ef.gies supports this conclusion. The most frequently depicted bird types, for example, are raptors, turkeys, and crested birds. This lack of correlation suggests that bird depiction was not a simple re.ection of subsistence reliance, but of a more symbolically signi.cant intent. At least one ef.gy likely represents a resplendent quetzal (Pharomachrus mocinno; Figure 
7). 
Later, 
quet­
zal feathers became an important tribute item from the Soconusco region paid to the Aztec empire (Gasco and Voorhies 1989:88–89). 



Interpretation and Discussion 
Local bird capture at Paso de la Amada was driven by three different motivations to varying degrees: subsistence, social display, and ritual performance. Comprising less than 2 percent of the vertebrate sample, birds were not a signi.cant contribution to diet. Typically, they were brought to the site and cooked whole, and residents of platform contexts do not appear to have had greater access to or control over birds in either quantity or type.

A social strategy is dif.cult to isolate, because some correlates overlap with those of subsistence and ritual strategies, and indirect evidence must be used to infer feather use. Intensive processing for the feathers of colorful birds or raptors did not occur at Paso de la Amada. Nonetheless, because feather use was so important in later time periods, it is probable that they were valuable in the Early Formative period as well. If so, access to certain types or colors of birds was not restricted by any subset of the population. 
In a site-wide artifact analysis comparing platform and non-platform contexts, Lesure and Blake 
(2002:22) 
tentatively 
suggest 
that 
inequal­
ity at Paso de la Amada was encoded in residential architecture and control over ritual activity, rather than based on the distribution of wealth goods. The lack of control over birds as a source of food and feathers supports their conclusion. 
That birds were an important component of ritual at Paso de la Amada is evidenced by the presence of four whole or partially articulated individuals in primary contexts at Mounds 6 and 
13. The deposition of these birds was differ­entiated from other activities through many of the mechanisms of ritualization outlined above (Bell 2009a, 
2009b). 
The 
use 
of 
these 
birds 
at 
Structure 4 to represent the vertical cosmos also supports 
Lesure 
and 
Blake’s 
(2002:19) 
sugges­
tion that claims to authority were based in control over ritual activity and sacred knowledge. This ritual activity was a public af.rmation of status through performance, sanctifying the space in which it was performed, and the authority of its performers. 
Five of the six offerings recovered from Paso de la Amada (including the celt and scapula) were found at high-status residences at Mound 6, again supporting the suggestion that authority was ritually based and architecturally expressed. These residences were the largest and most architecturally substantial at Paso de la Amada. 
That all known offerings date to the Locona phase is signi.cant in consideration of tem­poral changes in the nature of ceremonialism at Paso de la Amada (Lesure 2011b). 
During 
the Ocós phase, the differential formalism that characterized architectural space in Locona times began to “erode” (Lesure 2011b:140). 
Spaces 
that were previously formal became largely informal (Lesure 2011b:137–140). 
At 
the 
same 
time, the prestige of the inhabitants of formal spaces continued to increase, and specially built structures replaced high-status residences as the loci of public ritual (Lesure 2011b:144). 
This 
change explains the decrease in the intensity of offering activity at Mound 6 near the end of the Locona phase, and an absence of Ocós offerings. As the venue for public ritual changed, fewer offerings were made at high-status residences. The offering of animals and objects appears to

have ceased at this time, indicating that it was a domestic practice intended to display the status of platform residents. 


Conclusions 
Birds as a resource are susceptible to manipu­lation by potential aggrandizers and can be a means of creating and af.rming status differ­ences. At Paso de la Amada, the use of birds in ritual was an important tool for prestige building. In these early stages of the emergence of hereditary inequality, however, bird consump­tion and feather use were still relatively infor­mal, rather than tools used by platform-resident aggrandizers to create and af.rm their status. In any situation of emergent inequality, we might expect some combination of the three strategies, rather than a full-.edged system of their manip­ulation, to have been used for the creation and maintenance of social prestige. 
Analysis of the avifaunal remains from Paso de la Amada shows a combination of the three bird-use strategies, with a focus on the involve­ment of birds in ritual activity. An extensive, encompassing, and repetitive ritual complex such as that at Tenochtitlan is not mirrored at Paso de la Amada, but we may see the beginnings of a ritual interest in birds for the creation and maintenance of status and prestige in the Early Formative. 
The approach used here is intended to be holistic, and its value is three-fold. First, it focuses on an under-studied class of fauna. Second, too frequently, faunal studies focus on only one of the three strategies explored here, usually dietary, to the exclusion of others. This limited scope does not do justice to the explana­tory potential of animal bones. Examining all three strategies in zooarchaeological analyses provides a more comprehensive understanding of human-animal interaction. Lastly, studies of the emergence of inequality are often limited to one avenue of inquiry. An artifact-(or ecofact-) centered approach that explores all possible uses of that material can explain the various ways in which prestige may have been accumulated by social aggrandizers. The approach used here explores three possible motivations for the use of birds to provide a holistic understanding of how one class of artifact may have been manipulated in multiple ways to suit the needs of aggrandizers. This approach highlights the different ways— not just economic—that prestige could have been accumulated. 
We hope that this demonstration, along with other studies discussed here, of the importance of avifauna in prehistory and the explanatory potential of their remains will inspire otherwise disinclined researchers to give adequate time to their identi.cation. With these identi.cations, avifaunal collections can inform research on many aspects of prehistoric life. Studies of avifaunal collections can contribute to a more robust understanding of the early ritual, sym­bolic, dietary, and social importance of avifauna in Mesoamerica.

Notes 
1. 
Species richness is a simple measure of biodiversity that refers to the “total number of species identi.ed” in a sample or assemblage (Maurer and McGill 2011:56). This is often referred to as “species diversity” in archaeobiological studies, though it is distinct from the biological concept of the same name. The con.ation of the terms “diversity” and richness” in the archaeological literature has already been noted 
by 
Cruz-Uribe 
(1988). 
Throughout 
this 
paper 
it 
is 
used to discuss the number of different species present in an assemblage or subset thereof (sensu Maurer and McGill 2011:56). 


2. 
Only tube beads from excavations by Richard Lesure were analyzed; thus the data discussed here are incomplete and need further analysis.
