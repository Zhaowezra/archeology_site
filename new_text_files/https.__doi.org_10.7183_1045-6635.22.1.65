THE LA TOLITA-TUMACO CULTURE: 
MASTER METALSMITHS IN GOLD AND PLATINUM 

David A. Scott 
The archaeological setting of the La Tolita-Tumaco culture is briefly discussed as a framework for the examination of the metallurgy of the area, in particular the gold-platinum alloys used to make platinum-coated gold objects, platinum-gold sintered alloys, and platinum-gold foil-plated objects. The sophisticated approach to the manipulation of metallic materi­als resulted in several notable advances being made by the La Tolita-Tumaco culture: the production of extremely fine rec­tangular wire, bimetallic tumbaga alloys, small lead spheres inlaid with platinum, soldering, granulation, and a degree of sophistication to metalworking that is very impressive and, in some cases, unique in the world. Some selected examples are discussed, and the microstructure of a representative selection of the La Tolita material, bimetallic tumbaga construction, the initial sintered gold-platinum product, platinum-plated gold, and heavily worked gold-platinum composite artifacts are presented. 
Se discute brevemente el panorama arqueol6gico de la cultura La Tolita-Tumaco como una introducci6n para el examen de la metalurgia del area, en particular, las aleaciones de oro-platino usadas para hacer revestimientos de platino en objetos de oro, las mezclas para aleaciones de oro-platino, y objetos de oro-platino laminados. La sofisticada manipulaci6n de materi­ales metalicos result6 en varios avances notables hechos por la cultura La Tolita-Tumaco: la producci6n de alambre rectan­gular muy fino, las aleaciones bimetalicas de tumbaga, las pequefias esferas de plomo incrustadas con platino; el so/dado; la granulaci6n y el grado de sofisticaci6n del trabajo en metal es muy impresionante y algunas veces representan casos unicos en el mundo. Se discuten algunos ejemplos seleccionados, y se presenta aqui una muestra representativa de la microestruc­tura de! material de La Tolita, la estructura bimetalica de tumbaga, las mezclas iniciales producidas en oro-platino, el platino­enchapado en oro, y artefactos sumamente elaborados compuestos en oro-platino.

During the Regional Development period, between about 600 B.C. andA.D. 350, the inhab­itants lived by the shore among the mangrove swamps and small estuaries, inhabiting the lit­toral between the area of Esmeraldas in Ecuador and as far north as Buenaventura in the Colom­bian region of Valle del Cauca, which is a con­siderable reach along the Colombian coast. The chiefs, who controlled the economic, religious, or shamanistic aspects of life, were buried in earth mounds, called tolas; wore gold and gold-plat­inum alloy necklaces, diadems, nose rings, lip plugs, and other miniature ornaments; and were buried with ceramics, gold, and other grave goods. Some of the to/as at La Tolita may contain super­imposed, column-shaped pots called timburas. Ceremonial centers occurred at La Tolita Island, at El Morro, and in the Santiago-Cayapas region in Ecuador (Museo del Oro 2009). These centers appear to have been simultaneous Iy trading ports, centers of cultural diffusion, and political and reli­gious headquarters .

La Tolita 

La Tolita is the most important site for any discus­sion of the metallurgy of the region. Valdez ( 1992: 230) maintains that there are four phases of development in the growth of La Tolita as a cere­monial site. Occupation appears to have begun around 600 B.C., referred to as the early Tolita period, with settlements along the Rio Santiago, many on raised banks of earth. Abundant fresh­water and marine ecosystems were available, with numerous villages along rivers and marshes. Many species of edible mollusks and crustaceans were caught, along with cultivated maize, beans, squash, and yucca. Utensils and figurines have affinities with the Formative or early Regional Development periods of the Machalilla phase (1800-1500 B.C.) and the Chorrera phase (1500-300 B .C.) along the central Ecuadorian coast. The La Tolita-Tumaco culture is also closely allied to the Jama-Coaque culture, which flourished along the Pacific coastal lowlands around the Ecuadorian border regions adjacent to that of La Tolita itself. 

Excavations at the site of Las Balsas, immedi­ately to the south of La Tolita, has produced evi­dence of worked gold alloy artifacts dating to the Formative period, including perforated sheets joined with metallic hooks or vegetable threads (Valdez et al. 2005:1-3). Calibrated radiocarbon dates for these artifacts from a well-stratified con­text gave 918-780 B.C. (GIF 11900: 2670 ± 35 B.P.; Beta 181458: 2660 ± 60 B.P.). This is the ear­liest evidence for the use of worked gold alloys from the La Tolita area. The two analyses given by Valdez et al. (2005:7) show that these objects are made in gold-copper alloy, one with 75 .l per­cent gold, 8.93 percent silver, and 15.7 percent copper and the other with 79.8 percent gold, 9.74 percent silver, and 9.48 percent copper (percent­ages given are by weight). These analytical results are significant, as they show that prepared gold-copper alloys were already in use in the region around 900 B.C. Comparison with trace elemental analyses for native gold from the Rio Santiago and from La Tolita (Valdez et al. 2005:7) shows comparable amounts of bismuth, lead, rhe­nium, antimony, tin, palladium, ruthenium, arsenic, and platinum to the tumbaga objects from the site, proving the use of locally available gold in their fabrication. 
Around 400 B.C., known as the Transitional period in La Tolita, the population increased as a result of reclaimed marshland, with land clearance and filling to raise some areas nearly 1 min height, while settlements expanded into the hinterland. Artifacts in shell, bone, wood, obsidian, and stone were common, and metallurgical developments in gold, copper, and platinum occurred. By 200 B .C., the importance of La Tolita was well established (Valdez 1992:230). In La Tolita itself, the Classic phase of occupation lasted until about A.D. 400. The center of the cultural region grew in size to occupy about I km2, with a resident population estimated to be about 2,000. The center was laid out according to a well-conceived plan, already noted by Max Uhle (1924). The site had a rec­tangular plaza about 190 m wide surrounded on three sides by important to las. The great quantity of funerary remains suggests that the site func­tioned as a regional burial ground. Ceramic mod­els of houses show that a variety of huts, houses, and specialized buildings existed. Artistic pro­duction in ceramics, metallurgy, wood, weaving, leather, and basketry produced superb examples of craftsmanship. Trade in shells, emeralds, quartz, sodalite, and obsidian took place, and provenance studies of the obsidian from La Tolita show that it originated from the area of Mullu­mica (Asaro et al . 1994). 
La Tolita became the preeminent ceremonial center on this part of the Ecuadorian-Colombian coast, with maritime contacts that extended as far afield as Central America and western Mexico (Anawalt 1992) . Agricultural activity included ridge-and-swale raised fields, which greatly expanded crop production. During the late Tolita Classic period, from A.D. 90 to 400, the site grew to 2 km2, with a socially stratified population of about 5,000 composed of theocratic rulers, artists, farmers , fisherman , and workers . Borderland marshes were filled in, and new tolas were created . 
The site of La Tolita has been looted almost continuously from AD. 1600 to the present (Alcina Franch 1979:15;Ferdon 1940),andmostofthearti­facts come from alluvial deposits that seem to be the result of redeposition of objects from eroded and washed-out archaeological zones (Saville 1908). The fragility of this part of the coast is con­firmed by early reports of the Spanish friar Fray Juan de Santa Gertrudis in 1756:

They call this village La Tola, because it is full of "to las" or earth mounds, and it really is like that because I have seen it. ... These are the burial mounds of ancient Indians, and as they were buried with everything they possessed, a lot of valuable articles have been found in some of them. The sea leaves its marks there, and when the tide goes out, a piece of beach is left opposite the village, and the Indians go there to see if they can find anything from the edge, and you can see that the sea is gradually eat­ing them away every time the tide comes in 
[1756:123]. 
Because of this coastal destruction and pro­longed looting, it is not certain that all of the metal­lic artifacts found at the site are contemporary with thetolasof La Tolita. Excavations at La Tolita have produced three radiocarbon dates: A.D. 90 (CSIC­2145: 1860±60B.P.),A.D. 150(CSIC-2414: 1800 ± 60 B .P.) for materials sti II not described, and A .D. 270 (M-735: 1680 ± 200 B.P.) for a "chimney bur­ial" of superimposed urns with a clay figurine of the La Plata type (Alcina Franch 1979: 109; Estrada l 962:Table 5; Stirling 1972: 163). Pottery and fig­urines similar to those reported from La Tolita occur only in the first two periods at the site of Inguapf (Bouchard 1977-1978), while in western Esme­raldas, the connections are mainly with the later Tiaone phase, which has five radiocarbon dates from site E-13 at La Propicia at the junction of the Rio Timme and the Rio Esmeraldas. These dates (Alcina Franch 1979:109, 114) span the period from A.D. 50 ± 60 (CSIC-240: 1900 ± 60 B.P.) to 
A.D. 260 (CSIC 241: 1690 ± 60 B.P.). The other connection is with the early Atacames phase (Scott and Bray 1994), which is radiocarbon dated to between A.D. 310 and A.D. 970 (CSIC 291: 1640 ± 50 B.P.; CSIC 280: 980 ± 50 B.P.). By the third 


;. or fourth century A.D., copper objects were in use at La Propicia, in Esmeraldas (Alcina Franch 1979), and at about the same time, sophisticated metal­work in gold, copper, silver, and other alloys became widespread throughout Pacific Ecuador (Meggers 1966; Saville 1907-1910). 
Guinea ( 1995) describes the Tiaone phase as dat­ing from A .D. 1 to 500, characterized by dispersed houses of extended families, which is followed by the Transitional phase, A .D. 500-700, leading to a depopulation of the coastal regions for reasons that are still poorly understood. Possible causes are still under discussion: Valdez (1 986) believes that diminishing food productivity may have led to social deterioration, while Bouchard ( 1995) sug­gests other hypotheses such as natural events (e.g., earthquakes, coastal erosion) or social-political fac­tors, leading to a loss of centralized power. 
During its Classic period, the La Tolita culture excelled in a number of crafts, such as metals and ceramics, the latter usually finely modeled by hand or mold-made. Gertrudis writes: "Various small figurines made of clay to a high degree of perfec­tion are normally found there .... There are also others made of gold, with eyes of emeralds, and small filigree gold beads, as small as the head of a pin" (1756:127). The miniature size of much of the goldwork is confirmed by the numerous examples of very delicate metallic artifacts from the region, something of a La Tolita specialty. Some 200 years earlier, Francisco Lopez de Gomara, writing of the Esmeraldas area in 1552, records: "The people wear many gold studs in their faces. They pierce the flesh in many places, and in each hole they put a grain or stud of gold, and many of them put turquoises and fine emeralds" (1852 [1553]:224). 
Bray ( 1979) reports the existence of a portrait of the leaders, the Mulatos of Esmeraldas painted by Adrian Sanchez Galque in 1552, the same year that Francisco Lopez de Gomara made his obser­vations. This portrait shows typical La Tolita jew­elry, which therefore must have continued to be in use up to the sixteenth century (Lane 2002:23), despite the loss of La Tolita as a center in its own right. This raises doubts as to the origin of the mulatto jewelry, for which there is no good post-La Tolita archaeology to help answer the questions regarding its origin. 
At La Tolita, the first conquistadors met with Indians who said that they were not indigenous inhabitants of the island but that they were there to guard a place that must therefore still have had some special significance. Bouchard (1984) notes that after about A.D. 50 a cultural diversification appeared, which may have continued for several centuries until the beginning of the Integration period. This seems not to have lasted until the Span­ish conquest because the first Europeans who dis­covered this region reported the existence of several Indian groups with individual cultural identities (Bouchard 1984), a possible return to the organi­zation oflocal power, probably similar to the caci-

cazgosor chiefdoms that were to be found in many Andean areas at the time of the conquest. 
Masucci (2008) draws attention to the impor­tance of Spondylus in long-distance trade; and in La Tolita, the prominence of gold (and platinum) may have been an important factor in the territor­ial expansion of the culture (Masucci 2008:494) . Bouchard (1995:79) also believes that the search for raw materials in the littoral and western foothills is a likely explanation for extended colonization. 
Inguapi and Cancha: Tumaco 

At Inguapf, near Tumaco, Department of Nariiio, small pieces of cut and hammered gold wire of astonishingly small diameters were recovered from a stratum with ceramic figurines of the Tolita type (Bouchard 1979). The location of some of the rel­evant sites is shown in Figures 2 and 3. The lnguapf deposit gave a radiocarbon date of 325 B.C. (Ny­
642: 2275 ± 85 B.P.). Bouchard (1984) also exca­vated the site of Cancha, located near the small modem village of Pampa de Oro, constructed on the remains of an archaeological site that may have lain parallel and contiguous to the bank of the Rfo Santiago. Cancha itself may have been part of this larger site. The second archaeological phase from Cancha was dated to about A.D. 90 (GIF 6818: 1860 ± 60 B.P.) from wood charcoal, and among this refuse were small fragments of gold sheet and wire that are typical metalworking products of the La Tolita-Tumaco culture (Scott and Bouchard 1988). 
In the Tumaco area as a whole, a variety of set­tlements have been found. The first occupations of many sites from this area originated during the late Formative period, as the radiocarbon dates and the salient characteristics of the ceramic vessels clearly demonstrate. Radiocarbon measurements from the site of Mataje on the pacific littoral of Colombia (Reichel-Dolmatoff 1965 , 1978) gave an age of about 400 B.C. (M 1480: 2350 ± 180 B.P.) for the end of the Mataje I period, which is comparable with the date obtained by Bouchard (1982) for the first period of occupation of the site of Inguapf, while farther north a tola at lmbilf has been dated to A.D. 1000 (H1481: 950 ± 150 B.P. [Reichel­Dolmatoff 1965:111-114]). Other finds include coastal trade artifacts from sites in the Nariiio high­lands (Uribe 1976). 
Some sites are of considerable size, such as Isla del Morro near the port of Tumaco, which runs for a kilometer along the beach and was inhabited until the Spanish invasion (Bray 1979). Houses were often rectangular with gabled roofs and built on arti­ficial platforms to protect them from coastal flood­ing. Other sites such as Monte Alto consist of small middens, low tolas, and simple pit graves (Cubil­los 1955). The La Tolita-Tumaco culture extended along the Colombian coast, into the Valle del Cauca. Relationships, particularly in cosmological sym­bols, may have existed between La Tolita-Tumaco and those of the Barna phase of the Calima area and of the SanAgustfn region in Colombia. Cardale de Schrimpff (2000) traces the image of the crocodile in ceramics, gold, and other materials in Tumaco to those of Calima, outside of the natural habitat of the crocodile. The more closely the iconographies of Tumaco and the llama phase of the Calima area are compared, the more similarities there are to be seen (Cardale de Schrimpff2000:85), such as mod­els of rectangular houses or the depiction of snakes on ceramic canasteros. 
Goldwork and Imagery 

The sacred character of much La Tolita art is shown by its depictions of powerful predators in earth, water, and sky such as caimans, serpents, felines, eagles, and bats and in the goldwork, small insects and flies. Imagery is divided by Valdez (1992:234) into nine principal categories: deities or anthropo­morphized animals; persons in formal poses, usu­ally without specific attributes; priests or shamans engaged in ritual acts with artifacts; men and women engaged in daily activity; trophy heads and masks; sacred animals; common animals of the region; houses or temples; and figures combining animal and human forms with headdresses, pec­torals, or masks. This categorization seems to underestimate the extent to which depictions of aging, disease , sexual expression , and phallic imagery were employed in Tumaco art. Fertility was important, the phallus being represented in the form of a handle on ceremonial jars , rollers , fish descalers, and censers. Pottery jars depict a variety of sexual acts, and some show the mother in the act of birth or with her baby just following birth, breast-feeding, or carrying the baby in her arms or on her shoulders (Museo de! Oro 2009). Many

ceramic objects appear to have been decorated with 
tiny nose ornaments and earrings made of gold, 
which adds another spectrum of gold usage to the 
art of the area, not just for human use as ornamen­
tation but for the decoration of ceramics (Lathrap 
et al. 1975). 
Old age and the changes in appearance with ill­
ness were portrayed in detail so precisely on the 
ceramics that the afflictions ofleishmaniasis, tuber­
culosis, syphilis, dwarfism, facial paralysis, 
Morquio's disease (Pachajoa et al. 2009), and 
Down's syndrome can readily be identified (Bernal 
and Briceno 2006; Calvopina et al. 2004). Cranial 
deformation was practiced in the Tumaco area to 
elongate the skull, and several of the ceramic jars 
show figures with this kind of elongated head. The 
origins of cranial deformation are already to be 
found in the Ecuadorian Formative period 
Machalilla phase (Munizaga 1976:690). 
Certain symbolic materials carried varying sig­
nificance at different times in La Tolita, and before 
A .D. 200, the conch shell (Strombus), the mollusk (Malea), and the bivalve shell (Spondylus) were especially important. A deposit in the subfloor of the principal plaza is composed of a great mass of seashells, and during the existence of the site, great accumulations of shells occurred in many areas, some being washed out in various deposits, such as those reported by Marshall H. Saville during early reconnaissance in 1908. The objects found during this expedition form part of the collections of the Museum of the American Indian, Heye Foun­dation, New York, now known as the National Museum of the American Indian (NMAI), Wash­ington, D.C. Much of this gold and gold-platinum assemblage consists of small dangles, granulated gold necklace beads, penannular nose ornaments, pins, needles, awls, appliques, masks, miniature 

. pectorals, wires, studs, dangles, and zoomorphic 
1 and anthropomorphic figurines. 
Saville ( 1908) examined the whole coastline from Cojimies, in Manabf, northward as far as La Tolita. In Esmeraldas itself, Saville noted over 40 localities where archaeological material, mostly ceramics, was to be found. Objects in terra-cotta and gold were the most numerous, and at La Tolita, Saville ( 1908) mentions the find of a crouched bur­ial with pottery and a gold egg containing a small fragment of an emerald. The crushed remains of a gold "egg" in the collections of the NMAI were examined and conserved by me and Jeffery Maish at the J. Paul Getty Museum, Malibu, in 1994 and proved to be composed of a few fragments of gold-platinum sintered alloy sheet and an ovoid­shaped tumbaga applique probably for attachment to a textile, which may have been crushed around the emerald found by Saville, misleading him into thinking of it as an egg-shaped golden artifact. No enclosed, egg-shaped gold objects have been found at this site, to the best of my knowledge. 
During the Tolita Classic phase, the marine sym­bols that had been important earlier became less predominant and were replaced with the jaguar, serpent, felines, and eagle; together with mixed animal-human figures and birds, such iconography was common to most of the cultures of the region. Stone weights were used on nets, and gold fish­hooks have been found in the rivers. Some of these hooks were made of copper plated with gold by the fusion gilding technique, which will be discussed here later. Excavated or salvaged gold and gold-platinum artifacts have made their way to the National Museum of Denmark, Copenhagen (Bergs0e 1937, 1938),andtotheNMAI, whose col­lections have formed the basis of several studies already published regarding this material (Scott 1984, 1986, 1987, 1992, 2004; Scott and Bray 1980, 1994, 1999; Scott and Doehne 1990), along with excavated finds from the sites of Cancha and Inguapf (Bouchard 1977-1978, 1979, 1984; Bouchard and Usselmann 2003; Scott and Bouchard 1988). Some material has been examined from the collections of the Museo Nacional del Banco Central de! Ecuador, Quito (Estevez de Romero 1998; Meeks et al. 2002), while other experimental work on gold-platinum sintering has been reported by Handwerker et al. (1991) and Noguez et al. (2006) . 
Gold and Platinum: 
The Geological Environment 

Gold 
In general, the gold ores of Colombia and Ecuador are to be found along the Central Cordillera, a minor source existing in the Eastern Cordillera. The min­eralization occurs in relationship with rocks of an acid-intermediate nature that are of igneous origin. The events, metallogenetically, are pre-Tertiary and

Tertiary. The pre-Tertiary events are associated with igneous rocks of plutonic type such as granites, granodiorites, and monzonites that intrude princi­pally in metamorphic rocks. The pre-Tertiary rocks of the batholith of Antioquia are the principal exam­ple; similar intrusions are present in the Central and Western Cordilleras in the Departments ofTolima, Cauca, Narifio, and Choc6. The Tertiary events occur in relation with rocks of the dacite and andesite type, formed in metamorphic processes. These are typical of the regions of volcanic activ­ity of the Central Cordillera from Antioquia and Narifio and the area of Choc6. 
There are many ways in which the nature of gold deposits can be classified (see, e.g., Emmons 1937:4; Scott 1982). There are extensive placer gold deposits in many parts of Ecuador and Colom­bia that were worked by Indians; an attractive woodcut illustrated by Plazas and Palchetti (1978:23), taken from Oviedo (1959 [1535-1548]), shows Indians panning gravels in a stream that they are taking from terrace deposits to one side of the riverbank. 
The gold deposits are impregnation zones and fissure veins in rocks of the basement complex, in Tertiary sediments and andesite . The gangue removed in the Indian mining operations would have been quartz, calcite, and dolomite. Grosse (1932) states that the fineness of the gold varied between 750 and 800 and that the andesite masses are oflate Tertiary age. Most of the placer deposits of Colombia and Ecuador are formed by the weath­ering of these veins, and X-ray diffraction studies (Juleff 1981) have found both quartz and calcite inclusions in ancient Colombian gold objects, both of which might be expected from the geological evidence. 
Some interesting information on alluvial work­ings is recorded by several cronistas (Balboa 1951 [1513]; Chaparro I 889 [1583]; Enciso 1895 [15 I 9]; Oviedo 1959 [1535-1548]; Vadillo 1872 [1537]). The basic technique is still in use today-that of gravel washing and panning in the batea. 
In the area of Tumaco, the main deposits are to be found in alluvial deposits along the Pacific slopes, particularly in the beds of the rivers Mira, Petia, and Telembi, located in Figures 1 and 2. Gold mineralization in veins is associated with quartz and porphyry of the Upper Tertiary, in the area from San Pablo to La Cruz, Department ofNarifio. Most of the alluvial deposits, therefore , will be found in the La Tolita-Tumaco area and probably supplied the highland areas. The area ofEsmeraldas, includ­ing the Island of La Tolita, shares the same basic geological nature, the Rivers Santiago and Esme­raldas and tributaries being rich in gold in alluvial terraces. 
There are many varieties of native gold; all invariably contain silver but sometimes apprecia­ble palladium, rhodium, mercury, tellurium, and lead as well as a common range of impurity ele­ments. Both the geological evidence and recent analyses point to a fairly simple gold mineraliza­tion in Colombia and Ecuador (Scott 1982) in which low levels of impurities, apart from silver and copper, are found. 
Platinum 
The source rocks for the platinum minerals in Colombia and Ecuador are thought to be pre-late Tertiary mafic-ultramafic intrusives (Mertie 1969), although the host rocks have never actually been located. Most Tertiary period rocks outcrop along the Western Cordillera in areas that, to some extent, correlate with alluvial platiniferous deposits. The most abundant placers are those of the Department ofChoc6, in the region of Pacific Colombia, where platinum is found disseminated in ultramafic rocks such as pyroxenes, serpentines, and dunites (Mon­roy 1978). The Choc6 area today produces about 98 percent of the platinum of Colombia, the other 2 percent being obtained from the Departments of Antioquia and Narifio. A detailed geological examination of worldwide platinum deposits has led to a better understanding of the occurrence of platinum based on two principal metallogenic regions: 
1. 
Alaskan-type concentrically zoned intrusions. 

2. 
Alpine-type mafic-ultramafic intrusions. 


Cabri and Feather (I 975) have listed occur­rences of these types of deposits based on data from the literature. 
The Tertiary deposits of Colombia are of the Alaskan type (Mertie I 969); the two types are char­acterized by values of R, where 
R =Pt weight percent x I 00 I [Pt weight per­
cent+ Ir weight percent+ Os weight percent] 
In Alaskan-type intrusions R has a high value

(> 85), compared with the Alpine type in which R 
is low (< 40). Cabri, Harris, and Weiser (1996) 
have suggested that the Au/Ir ratio may also be of 
significance, and this ratio as well as R give the 
Colombian and Ecuadorian deposits a particular 
character in which R has been estimated at about 
95 (Me1tie l 969:Table 27) and where the Au/Ir 
ratio is also high. 
The original mafic source rocks have suffered 
severe erosion resulting in alluvial deposits rich in 
platinum in the Choc6 area of Colombia and in the 
Pacific littoral crossing the Colombian-Ecuado­
rian border; some salient geological features are 
shown by Weiser and Schmidt-Thome (l 993:Fig­
ure 2).Alluvial platinum, then, is encountered along 
the western flanks of the Western Cordillera, while 
in the Eastern Cordillera platinum is rare. The geo­
logical evidence helps to explain the relative 
paucity of platinoid inclusions in the goldwork of 
most of the Colombian area, such as the Tairona, 
Quimbaya, Muisca, Tolima, and Zenu regions, for 
the gold mineralization belts are found principally 
along the Central Cordillera and to a minor extent 
in the Eastern. 
Mixed gold and platinum placer deposits must 
have been the source of the platinum used in pre­
hispanic times. Modem methods of gravel dredg­
ing operate on a vast scale compared with Indian 
methods of mining and gravel washing by means 
of the batea, so it is hard to equate modem depo­
sitional studies with those used by prehispanic pop­
ulations. Primitive methods, however, would have 
possessed the virtue of close personal observation 
of the nature of the sands in which gold and plat­
inum may occur. Castillo (1909) found during 
investigations in the San Juan Valley that it was pos­
sible to tell from the color of the gravel whether it 

might be gold-bearing or platinum-bearing. The 
. gold gravels were "whitish and reddish in colour, ' 
while the platinum, owing to the gabbro, has a bluish-black colour ... the separation of the gold from the platinum gravel being so sharp that the writer was able to trace the platinum to its source­rock " (Castillo 1909:827). By panning operations alone, however, it is unlikely that Indians could have separated gold and platinum if they were found together, for the specific gravities of both range from about 14 to 19, with most of the gold containing some silver and copper, while native platinum may contain varying quantities of iron , copper, rhodium, palladium, and iridium, the lat­ter three being representatives of the platinum group metals (PGM). 
The area between the Cordillera de Toisan and the Pacific coast in Esmeraldas contains occur­rences of the PGM, especially between the Rivers Cayapas, San Miguel, and Santiago. Ecuador is divided into three very distinct physiographic belts, the Costa, the Sierra, and the Oriente . The PGM from this region was studied by Weiser and Schmidt-Thome (1993). 
The area of Esmeraldas to the Colombian bor­der lies in the geological area called "The Costa. " This Pinon Formation comprises basaltic lavas and breccias of submarine origin in which pillow struc­tures are common and may represent oceanic crust. The age is pre-Senonian and is older than the Macuchi Formation to the west. These are overlain by Tertiary and Quaternary sediments, which reach a maximum thickness of several thousand meters in the Borbon Basin. The youngest deposits are compacted fluviatile and estuarine sediments of Quaternary age derived from erosion of the Sierra to the east. 
The placer deposits of platinum and gold occur in these sediments (Weiser and Schmidt-Thome 1993: 62-63), and those of the platinum metals were found to be exclusively of platinum-iron alloy. The small grains are mostly well rounded by abrasion during transport. The platinum-iron alloys and especially the ruthenosmiridium inclusions are characterized by a very low content of ruthenium. On the other hand, the platinum-iron alloys always contain remarkable amounts of rhodium, and the most common inclusions are the rhodium sulfides bowiete and cuprorhodsite.All other PGM contain rhodium, which indicates a ruthenium-depleted and rhodium-enriched source for the platinum from the Santiago River. A similar trend was found by Weiser and Schmidt-Thome ( 1993) in unpublished data from placers in the Condoto River area, Department of Choc6. A sketch map showing the principal locations of present-day platinum deposits in Ecuador and Colombia is shown in Figure 3 (after Scott and Bray 1994:Figure 1). 
The basic to ultrabasic rocks that occur in the Macuchi Formation have been interpreted as part of an ophiolite complex and as possible source rocks for the platinum placers. The composition of the Ecuadorian placers compares closely with those

from Burma, which are also Alaskan-type intru­sives, and those from Alaska, British Colombia, and France. 
Alluvial platinum is known from other parts of the world such as Yugoslavia, Madagascar, the Urals of Russia, etc. Alluvial platinum was dis­covered in Madagascar by Europeans during the nineteenth century (Auge and Legendre 1992:984). 
Isoferroplatinum predominated, as in the Ecuado­rian and Colombian deposits. Johan et al. (1990) also found platinum nuggets in the Durance River, France, and conclude that they were also from an Alaskan-type deposit.

ferroplatinum region and distinct, sensu stricto, from native platinum by the criteria of Cabri and Feather (1975). 
The Platinum Artifacts 
The first report of ancient objects made of platinum from this area was that of Wolf (1879, 1892), who discovered them in alluvial gravel deposits while undertaking geological investigations in the Ecuadorian Department of Esmeraldas. In 1912, Verneau and Rivet (l 912-1922:Plate 24, Figure 2, 323-324) described a gold figurine with one eye made of silver alloy and the other of platinum alloy. An examination byd'Harcourt (l948:325) gave an analysis for the platinum eye of 50 percent Pt, 25 percent Ag, and 20 percent Au. The silver was, in fact, alloyed with some copper, so the overall com­position is still not clear, especially since gold must be greater than silver in Colombian and La Tolita material . Further examples of small gold and plat­inum objects were found at La Tolita in 1912 and published by Farabee in 1921; in this collection, now in the University of Pennsylvania Museum, were objects of native platinum, sintered gold-plat­inum alloys, and gold objects coated with platinum on one side. However, little metallurgical interest in this remarkable use of platinum was raised until a number of small objects were obtained from the area of Esmeraldas by Paul Bergspe in Denmark. The collection comprised face studs, tweezers, nose ornaments, aw ls, small ornaments, and other mate­rial from La Tolita and various sites in the area of Esmeraldas. In 1937 and 1938, Bergsoe published two monographs on the metallurgy of the Esmer­aldas area, the first of these dealing with gold and platinum and the second concentrating on the gild­ing method and the metallurgy of copper and lead. 
The 1937 report gives the first account of the use of sintered gold-platinum alloys in antiquity. The investigations carried out subsequently have confirmed the accuracy of Bergspe's findings, and his monographs remain classics. A historic photo­graph of part of this collection in the National Museum of Denmark, Copenhagen, is shown in Bergsoe's 1937 monograph and illustrates some of the miniature penannular nose rings, crescentic nose ornaments, dangles, ingots, beads, wire, fish­hooks, sintered lumps, platinum-plated gold, ear ornaments, face studs and other small beads, tubes, and other ornaments in the collection. Two later publications resulted from Bergsoe 's work: a study by Reichlen (1941, 1942) of metalwork from Esmeraldas in the collections of the Musee de I 'Homme and the Terver Collection and a note by d'Harcourt (1948) that gives analyses of two plat­inum objects in the same museum. 
One of the few omissions in Bergsoe's work is the lack of any analyses for iron in the native plat­inum. He did not seem to be aware that many of the gold and platinum sintered alloys could be picked up with a hand magnet, showing that they are ferromagnetic as a consequence of their plat­inum-iron content. The analysis of platinoid inclu­sions was considered by Bergspe but rejected at that time, since the destruction of many objects would not necessarily have resulted in any worthwhile analytical conclusions. This statement holds today: we can correlate the detailed analyses with geo­logical data, but since we know no more of the loca­tion of the original deposits than was known in 1938 , there is little point except for the purpose of characterization. Analytical studies show that the La Tolita artifacts are composed of five principal elements: gold, platinum, silver, iron, and some­times copper. The copper content of gold alloys that have been clad with platinum appears noticeably higher than in the sintered gold-platinurv alloys, which is highly significant, as we will see later. 
The size of the alluvial grains is similar to that of gold (McDonald 1959, 1960), and the separa­tion of mixed deposits would have required hand sorting, although if the native platinum is ferro­magnetic, which it often is, some clumping together of the platinum might be expected on washing in the batea. Larger nuggets of platinum are some­times encountered; a specimen from the Choc6 area now in the Royal Museum of Madrid weighed nearly 700 g (Heuland 1818). According to some geological writers, unaware of the use of platinum by Indians, the sources of the platinum in placers in Colombia had never been exploited (Noble 1976:228)! 
There are additional phases that may be present such as Au-Cu-Pt (Johan et al. 1990) that are rarely encountered. The nomenclature for the alloys of iridium, platinum, ruthenium, osmium, rhodium, and palladium (the PGM) used to follow that of Harris and Cabri (1973); however, in 1991, Harris and Cabri revised the nomenclature for this min-

era! group and adopted the recommendations of the Commission on New Minerals and Mineral Names, relating to solid-solution series, that the 50 percent rule be followed, where the mineral name is given to the dominant end member. Nickel (1992) revis­ited this question again and has suggested a partial series of name changes to redefine the revision of Harris and Cabri (1991). Minerals in the Ru-Os-Pt-Ir group are either cubic (iridium and platinum) or hexagonal (osmium, ruthenium, and rutheniridosmine). The preferred terminology is now as follows: osmium is the mineral name for the hexagonal alloys; iridium, for all cubic alloys; rutheniridosmine, for all hexagonal alloys with irid­ium as the major element; and ruthenium, for all hexagonal alloys with ruthenium as the major ele­ment. Ideal limiting compositions of rutheniridos­mine have been determined using the miscibility gap as shown by Harris and Cabri ( 1991). Cabri et al. ( 1996) collated the data for the ternary Os-Ir-Ru system, where hexagonal alloys follow the bound­ary of the miscibility gap while alloys of cubic irid­ium generally show no trend. 
I have described the composition of the PGM inclusions within the gold-platinum artifacts in detail (Scott 1982), and a synopsis of the data is shown in Figure 4, where worldwide occurrences are plotted in small dots, after Harris and Cabri ( 1991), and the Ecuadorian data are marked with a letter E. Data are plotted in atomic percentages, with the ternary miscibility gap shown in gray. The Ecuadorian inclusions in the Pt-Os-Ir field mostly cluster toward the high iridium, low platinum, and low osmium area, while in the Os-Ir-Ru system, they are all ruthenium deficient and are spread across the osmium-iridium field with less than 20 atomic percent of ruthenium. 
In the platinum-iron grains themselves, the material from Ecuador and Colombia may also contain copper, nickel, and antimony, usually pre­sent only in very small amounts; the presence of small percentages of copper in the platinum ( .1-2 .0 percent by weight) is common (Scott 1982), but no nickel or antimony were detected. The platinum laths usually have a small percentage of rhodium, occasionally of iridium as well, broadly in keep­ing with the results from the geological work of Weiser and Schmidt-Thome (1993:62-63). I have given one analysis of a cuproplatinum sample from the Choc6 area of Colombia (Scott 1982); no exam-pies of this type of native platinum were found in the examination of the Esmeraldas material. This one small penannular nose ring made in a native cuproplatinum nugget is a unique object and is, so far, the only example published showing the use of cuproplatinum in antiquity. There are many exam­ples of platinum-gold alloys being exported as trade items from the La Tolita area: and these have been found at Convento, at El Angel , in a Recuay crown , and in areas of the Colombian cordillera, especially in the Calima area. 
The Sintering of Gold and Platinum 
Antoine Lavoisier demonstrated the melting of platinum before King Louis XVI of France and Marie Antoinette in 1782, 12 years before his exe­cution by the state (McDonald and Hunt 1982:71). The metal had never been molten before in human history. This is because l ,772°C (Weast 1978) is impossible to reach with charcoal and a forced draft of air. There is a large gap between the melting points of the pure components: gold at l ,06 l .4°C, which can readily be molten , and platinum at l ,772°C, a difference of 708°C. Of course, the native gold will contain some silver, and the native platinum will contain some iron, both of which will lower the melting point slightly. The usual method for melting metals in Colombia and Ecuador was to use a charcoal fire and blowpipe, with hammer­ing carried out using polished stone blocks, held in the hand. There is, for example, an Esmeraldas ceramic figurine, thought to be from the fourth to seventh centuries A.D., which shows a seated fig­ure holding a rectangular block (Emmerich 1965:Figure 200). Resting on the block are a penan­nular nose ring and a bead. Spanish cronista accounts are also given of metalsmiths hammering out gold using smoothed stone blocks and tum­baga using shaped stone hammers on large stone anvils, some shaped like a Majorcan cheese (see Bray 1971:28). 
Using a charcoal fire and blowpipe, it is not nor­mally possible to attain temperatures higher than l ,200°C, and usually less than that. ln the gold-platinum equilibrium diagram there is a wide, two-phase field between 25 percent platinum and 97 percent platinum by weight. This area of spin­odal decomposition cannot be intersected with a line drawn from the liquidus curve until a temper-

ature of about l ,500°C is reached. The gold can be liquefied, since Indians could obtain temperatures higher than 1,100°C, but the platinum will remain undissolved, apart from small amounts entering into solid solution through the process of interdif­fusion. But did the Indian metalsmiths actually reach a temperature of l,l00°C for this purpose? Such a temperature would have been unnecessary when the small objects were being worked and annealed to shape, as otherwise they would undergo incipient melting. Handwerker et al . (1991) exam­ined the microstructure of gold-platinum compos­ite wire assemblages used as replicas in laboratory studies that were heated to l ,100°C for two min­utes, held at that temperature forthree minutes, and then water-quenched. An other experiment was car­ried out at 1 ,200°C, with the same materials, hold­ing the alloy at l ,200°C for seven minutes and then water quenching. In both cases, the degree of inter­diffusion of gold and platinum was far greater than that seen in the artifacts under study, which were loaned to Handwerker et al. by the Museo Arque6­logico del Banco Central del Ecuador, Quito. Parts of these objects were dissolved for atomic absorp­tion spectroscopy, one of which (MIT 3407-2) gave the following overall composition (by weight): 74.6 percent Au, 10.6 percent Ag, 12.7 percent Pt, and 
3.4 percent Cu, totaling 101.3 percent. This result is useful but not complete, as no analyses for iron are given, which would bring the total to well over 102 percent. 
In the initial stages, then, we can assume that either the gold was only momentarily liquefied to stick the little pieces of platinum together or the sintered mass never really contained a liquid phase and all of the work was carried out by solid-state diffusion. However, if the platinum grains were mixed with some gold grains and placed on a char­coal lump to be heated together with the blowpipe, we can assume that the gold must have been liq­uid at some stage in order to create the homoge­neous gold-rich matrix between the platinum grains to be seen in National Museum of Denmark No. NMD158, shown in Figure 5 and drawn in Figure 6, No. 3. The sintered mass that results from the initial stage of fusing the gold and platinum together is lumpy, porous, and difficult to work without breaking off small pieces of the unalloyed mass in the process. Successive annealing and careful working will eventually produce a sintered alloy

heated to about 1 ,000-l ,100°C,judging by the data obtained by Handwerker et al. (1991). What this penannular nose ornament shows, in fact, is that considerable variation existed in the degree to which the ancient metalsmiths sintered their native gold and native platinum together, with a wide range of microstructures being possible, all the way from platinum particles showing very little disso­lution to extensive interdiffusion of the different components. Melting may not have been necessary in order to achieve the latter; indeed, after the ini­tial components are mixed together, there would be no need.

Platinum and Lead 
Worked and hammered platinum grains or gold-platinum composites were used to decorate the surface of small lead spheres or ornaments by impressing the platinum into the surface of the lead. Lead has a microhardness of 25-40 Hv, so the plat­inum grains can be depressed into the surface eas­ily. The La Tolita culture is, again, the only one in the world to have made use of platinum-lead com­posite artifacts . The subject of lead in the context of La Tolita is itself mysterious, since at present we have no idea where this lead comes from. Since lead is badly corroded in warm, moist soils with access to air and rainfall, it is quite possible that there has been substantial loss of small lead artifacts to cor­rosion as they convert to cerussite or hydrocerus­site in burial. Small pieces of native lead had been found in platinum sands in Colombia; Bergs0e ( 1938:21) also mentions that Root reports metallic lead, in the form of 60-to 80-g nuggets on the west coast of Guatemala, although in general terms the use of native lead is considered a very rare event as the metal is readily smelted from its ores. 

An analysis by Bergs0e of one lead nose ring showed the presence of .1-.2 percent copper, .05 percent bismuth , and .01 percent silver, with no detected tin, arsenic, or antimony. Reichlen (1942:227) examined three small lead fragments in the Terver coll ection and came to the concl u-

Neither Bergspe nor Reichlen appears to have made any determination of sulfur in their exami­nation. The analyses shown in Table 2 reveal a con­siderable sulfur presence. Bergspe noted that if a small piece of galena, lead sulfide, is heated with a charcoal fire and a blowpipe, a small bead oflead could very easily be produced. The presence of rather high levels of sulfur in this nose ring sug­gests that he may well have been correct and that the lead was made from smelted galena rather than from native lead, especially given the environ­mental conditions around La Tolita; but further research is needed to shed light on this interesting question, as the sulfur content could be influenced by subsequent corrosion of the lead. 
Platinum-Plated Gold 

The use of platinum to coat one or both sides or selected areas of one side of gold artifacts is another La Tolita achievement unparalleled anywhere . Some artifacts have a dual surface: with half coated with platinum and the other coated with gold, this duality was probably of significant symbolic, reli­gious, or shamanistic importance. A well-known example consisting of an ear ornament half in plat­inum-gold alloy and half in gold alloy with a sodalite bead incorporated into the assemblage is in the collections of the Museo del Oro, Banco de la Republica, Bogota. It is said to come from the Inguapf River area of Tumaco and is only datable to between 500 B.C. and A.D. 300. Sodalite or other beads joined to a gold or gold-platinum orna­ment are a feature of La Tolita metalwork whose cultural significance remains to be unraveled. 
If fine platinum laths are placed over a strip of hammered gold and heated at 800-l ,000°C, some dissolution takes place and the platinum will tend to sink through the gold, some of it becoming bro­ken down to fine globules. This was carried out in a laboratory experiment using pure gold and filings of a 96 percent platinum/4 percent iron alloy (by weight). Similar! y, if the unalloyed laths are forced onto the surface of the gold with a hammer, they tend to be driven into the surface and to become covered with the softer gold matrix. However, a platinum-coated surface was produced by the Indi­ans, so the question arises as to how this was achieved. Bergspe suggests the following method: 

It is extremely easy with a hammer and anvil to make a piece of platinum plated gold. A small piece of the hammered-out plate made of the artificially produced [sintered] alloy is placed above a little bead of gold alloy, heated until coherence takes place and then hammered out with a few intervals for annealing. When the two metals have attained the same degree of hardness they are hammered out together, and we now have a gold plate with a thin coat­ing of platinum alloy [1937:27]. 

Metallurgical examination of some of the small objects coated with platinum shows that in some cases, extremely thin platinum-clad surfaces have been produced, consisting of gold with a single layer of small platinum laths, as in the microstruc­ture of a small dangle from the National Museum of Denmark collections shown in Figure 8 and in Figure 6, No. 4. 
Very little sintering has occurred, and the plat­inum could not have been applied as a sintered mixture subsequently fused to a gold alloy base. The method of manufacture can probably be recon­structed as follows: first, a gold alloy was ham­mered out approximately to shape, followed by the addition of fine platinum particles to one side. With careful heating, these platinum additions will just fuse with the gold at the surface. When this alloy is hammered out, the platinum surface cannot be driven into the gold to the same extent as unalloyed

inclusions can be, and they will tend to flatten out along the surface of the gold as both are defonned. Since the platinum will still be appreciably harder than the gold matrix, some embedding of the plat­inum would be expected on heavy working. But if further platinum grains are added, and the process is repeated, then a substantial coating of platinum can be built up that will give a smooth silver-gray surface on burnishing. 
A laboratory experiment was performed on a gold sheet coated with filings of the 96 percent platinum/4 percent iron alloy. The initial color of the filings was silver, but after heating under char­coal in a muffle furnace to about 900°C for 15 min­utes, the sintered surface of the platinum assumed a dull gray-silver color. As the platinum enters into solution with gold, the color of the resulting alloy changes from gold to gray-yellow to gray-white as the platinum content increases. The change in color on the outer surfaces of the platinum here, how­ever, is due to some oxidation of the iron compo­nent. If the platinum-iron alloy filings are heated in a blowtorch with a blue, oxidizing flame, the fil­ings are rapidly covered in a thin layer of iron oxides, which interfere with the sintering process. The Indians, with a charcoal fire and blowpipe, had the means of avoiding this excessive oxidation, since the atmosphere in a charcoal fire will not usu­ally be an oxidizing environment. The laboratory alloy was lightly hammered and annealed at bright red heat, with further cycles producing a flat sheet with gold on one side and platinum on the other. A little of the platinum broke up and sank through the gold through gravity separation; the major part remained on the surface to produce a platinum­coated gold sheet. 
Meeks et al. (2002) examined a miniature zoomorphic mask from the La Tolita culture, in the collections of the Museo Nacional de! Banco Cen­tral del Ecuador, Quito (Inv. 1-53-75), which had previously been described by Estevez de Romero ( 1995, 1998). It is made of a number of different components, and many were found to have a plat­ing of platinum on one side of about 20-30 µ thick, with a high density of flattened platinum grains fused within a gold-silver alloy matrix. A typical analysis for this coating found 9 percent platinum, 34 percent silver, and 54 percent gold. There are several indications that the platinum-gold coating was applied as an already formed thin applique. First, the plating stops at the top of the pendant in an abrupt fashion. Second, the diffusion of the plat­inum into the gold-silver alloy of the applique foil is much greater than the diffusion into the gold of the body of the pendant. Third, the gold-silver alloy used in the foil has a significantly higher silver composition than the gold of the pendant itself. 
This kind of thick, platinum-gold foil coating was probably also used for another small dangle in the National Museum of Denmark, Copenhagen, collection whose microstructure is shown in Fig­ure 9 and drawn in Figure 6, No. 5. In this dangle, the composition of the gold substrate is 77 .9 per­cent gold, 9.6 percent copper, 8.7 percent silver,and 2 percent platinum (by weight); while the compo­sition of the thick coating is 43.3 percent gold, 1.2 percent copper, 4 .9 percent silver, 38 .3 percent plat­inum, .7 percent rhodium, and 3.8 percent iron (by

weight). The copper content is too high to be a native gold and suggests that it is a prepared gold­rich tumbaga alloy. The surface appears slightly rough, as ifthe platinum has been fused to the gold without appreciable surface finishing, which may be a significant observation if this is due to the fusion of a separate platinum-gold alloy foil to the surface . 
One of the most extraordinary examples of the great skill in platinum coating over gold is that of a small gold arm or leg bangle in thin hammered gold strip that has a platinum-coated central band with a border the color of the gold substrate on either side of the platinum-gold surface. This La Tolita specimen is in the collections of the National Museum of the American Indian and is discussed further in Scott 2004. For the past 100 years, this masterpiece has been languishing in storage, coiled up in a test tube, its superb and subtle craftsman­ship having gone unnoticed or unappreciated. 
All the platinum-clad objects examined from La Tolita have some copper content, but only 55 per­cent of the sintered gold-platinum alloys have any copper content. The evidence suggests that copper additions were made to the gold-platinum alloys but that these additions were controlled. The indis­criminate use of scrap tumbaga alloy fragments, for example, would give rise to high levels of cop­per that would be undesirable in gold-platinum alloys. One reason for this is that oxidation of cop­per, on heating sintered gold alloy and platinum grains together, would interfere with the sintering process. 
To approach the same argument from the per­spective of gold content, it is quite evident that where gold and gold-copper alloys have been pre­pared, platinum has been excluded or efforts have been made to keep platinum to low levels. Several of Bergs0e's results support this argument. The gold used to make the sintered platinum alloys con­tains some silver, whose presence appears vari­able; however, examination of the Ag/ Au ratios reveals that they fall in the range between .10 and .15, indicating some consistency in the Ag/ Au ratios for the Esmeraldas material. From the National 
Museum of Denmark collections is a small rec­tangular platinum alloy block with pale silver­yellow colored surfaces (Bergs0e 1937:Plate 3, Figure 49; Scott and Bray 1980:Figure 7). The block is smoothly finished on all sides except one, where it has been cut, probably with a chisel, from a longer strip of metal . The rough and defonned face of the cut shows the same pale silver-yellow as the surfaces. The alloy is ferromagnetic. The sampled section was etched for 30 seconds in a cyanide/persulfate mix, which revealed a heavily worked and annealed rnicrostructure. The grains can be seen to be recrystallized and well worked with very little porosity. There are only a few larger platinum grains; one of these, toward one edge of the section, shows the incipient dissolution of the platinum along grain boundaries, isolating globu­lar areas of platinum as some enters into solution with the gold. The rnicrostructure of this small rec­tangular ingot is remarkable for the fine grain struc­ture and the regular dispersion of small platinum-rich globules that it contains. The pho­tomicrograph is shown in Figure 10 and in Figure 6, No. 2, while microhardness readings gave the results shown in Table 3.
