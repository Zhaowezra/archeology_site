GEOPHYSICAL SURVEY ON THE COAST OF PERU: THE EARLY 
PREHISPANIC CITY OF GAL LINAZO GROUP IN THE VIRU VAL LEY 

Jean-Frarn;ois Millaire and Edward Eastaugh 
Recent geophysical survey at the early urban center of the Gallinazo Group in the Virzi Valley highlights the potential for a multifaceted approach to remote sensing on the desert coast of South America and underscores the value of these well-estab­lished techniques for the rapid and detailed mapping of complex urban architecture. The Gallinazo Group (JOO B.C.-A.D. 700) was an early city home to a population of between 10,000 and 14,400 people living in a network of agglutinated houses, plazas, public buildings, and alleyways. In 2008, detailed analysis of the site was undertaken, integrating traditional excavation techniques, soil coring, magnetometry, and ground-penetrating radar to gain a better understanding of the urban morphology of the site. The results of this fieldwork were extremely successful, with large areas of the urban layout being mapped in great detail. This article presents results from our survey, highlighting the potentials and limitations of each technique. 
Los nuevos estudios geoffsicos en el centro urbano del Grupo Gallinazo en el Valle de Virzi resaltan el potencial de un enfoque multifacetico en la teledetecci6n en esta costa desertica de Suramerica, ademas de subrayar el valor de estas ya probadas ticnicas para el mapeo r<ipido y detallado de arquitectura urbana compleja en la region. El Grupo Gallinazo ( 100 a.C.-700 d.C.) consiste en una ciudad antigua con una poblaci6n de entre 10.000 y 14.000 personas viviendo en una red de casas aglu­tinadas,plazas, edificios pziblicos y callejones. En 2008 se llev6 a cabo un analisis detallado del sitio agregando a las tecnicas tradicionales de excavaci6n la extracci6n de muestras por calicata, la magnetometr(a y el georadar para mejorar nuestra comprensi6n de la morfolog{a urbana del sitio. Los resultados fueron un gran ixito, revelando grandes areas de la trama urbana de la ciudad con gran detalle. Este trabajo presenta los resultados de nuestro relevamiento y destaca el potencial y las limitaciones de cada tecnica.

rchaeologists conducting research onAearly urbanism share with other social scientists an interest in addressing spe­cific questions about life in the big city (Cowgill 2004; Marcus and Flannery 1996; Rowe 1963; Smith 2007). To what extent were early cities planned or left to expand organically? Was urban sprawl tolerated or regulated? How did it impact city life and administration? Did civic institutions morph to take on new roles associated with the management of growing communities? How did people adapt to life in crowded spaces? Were early city dwellers able to mitigate some of the negative effects of living in close quarters by modifying their living environment? How did each one of these cities come to be abandoned? To answer such questions, archaeological infor­mation is needed on city size, morphology, build­ing types, materials used, population density, and chronology. 
In characterizing incipient urbanism, An­deanists have traditionally relied on mapping only the visible above-ground structures with land sur­veying equipment or through the use of aerial photographs (e.g., Moseley and Mackey 1974; Willey 1953) and, more recently, satellite imagery (e.g., Contreras 2010; Lasaponara et al. 2011). Although these approaches have proved successful for the larger and better-preserved sections of ar­chaeological sites, they are often unable to provide information on buried archaeological features. Surprisingly, despite their non-destructive nature and well-established potential for site mapping, only a handful of Andean projects (e.g., Williams et al. 2007) have integrated near-surface geophys­ical survey techniques to map and assess the nature

of buried features . The utility of these techniques in archaeology is well documented (Aitken 1961; Clark 1990; Gaffney and Oater 2003; Johnson 2006; Scollar et al. 1990) and they have been used extensively in the mapping of large archaeological landscapes (e.g., Gaffney et al. 2000; Keay et al. 2005; Keay et al. 2006; Summers et al. 1996; Tsokas et al. 1994). Recent advances in both in­strumentation and processing now allow for ex­tremely detailed mapping of large areas, which can include accurate plans of streets, buildings, rooms, and even individual features within rooms . This has pushed geophysical investigation beyond its traditional role, which focused on prospection, to a more problem-oriented approach that better integrates geophysical techniques into archaeo­logical research designs (Conyers and Leckebusch 2010; Kvamme 2003, 2006; Thompson et al . 2011). Geophysical survey has even become a re­search method in its own right, offering alterna­tives to excavation (Conyers 2010). 
Taking into account the potential of geophysics at the planning stage of projects (Keay et al . 2009), it is first essential to establish which meth­ods are most appropriate to the research questions . Given that each technique exploits a different physical property of the earth, the visibility of any given buried cultural feature will vary de-

pending on its physical environment. As a result, it is often the case that some features of a site are readily identifiable by one technique but invisible to another (Clay 200 1; Piro et al . 2000). For ex­ample, a small mud brick hearth might be missed by an earth resistance survey but be easily iden­tified using close-interval ground-penetrating radar survey (GPR) or a magnetometer. Nonethe­less, while the GPR might reveal the shape of the hearth, its function might remain unclear, whereas the magnetometer has the potential to indicate that it was originally used for heating or cooking . These results taken together provide in­formation on the shape of the features, as well as the possible function, allowing for a more nu­anced interpretation. Thus, the most successful results usually arise when more than one method is used and the results are integrated (Drahor 2006; Keay et al. 2009; Kvamme et al. 2006; Piro et al . 2003). 
In this article, we present results from a mul­tifaceted survey at the Gallinazo Group, an early urban centre in the Vini Valley in northern Peru (Figure 1). The survey integrated soil coring, magnetometry, and GPR to reveal a dense and agglutinated urbanscape around the monumental civic-ceremonial platform mound (Huaca Galli­nazo) that dominates the site. 
The Gallinazo Group 
Throughout prehispanic times, the coast of Peru was at the center of early civilization develop­ment . A desert environment interspersed with several river oases, the region provided ideal con­ditions for the emergence of mixed economies based on marine resources and irrigated agricul­ture and for the materialization of complex forms of sociopolitical organization. This was also a fertile context for the development of early urban settlements and associated monumental civic ar­chitecture. Distinct from ceremonial and pilgrim­age centers that were often intermittently occu­pied, early Andean cities featured extensive residential areas and boasted large permanent populations and diverse civic institutions. 
The Gallinazo Group is a large settlement in the lower Viru Valley believed to have been the capital of the Vini state during the first half of the first millennium A.D . (Figure 2; Millaire

2010a, 2010b; see also Millaire and Morlion 2009). It is composed of 30 tells, ranging from small low rises to impressive mounds of eroded adobe bricks and refuse, spread over an area of ca. 600 ha of flatlands. The site was first investi­gated early in the twentieth century by Wendell 
C. Bennett (1950) as part of the Vini Valley Pro­ject (see Ford 1949; Willey 1953). Bennett con­ducted fieldwork on a number of mounds, but concentrated his efforts on the presumed core of the city: Huaca Gallinazo. Excavations in the open areas immediately adjacent to the mound exposed a dense agglomeration of agglutinated buildings, plazas, and passageways. Test pits on the mound revealed the presence of deep stratified deposits (up to 7 m)-the product of centuries of occupation (Millaire 2010b). 
Although important, Bennett's initial work was restricted to a few excavation areas, and only limited data were available on the morphology of the ancient city. Although some information can be gleaned from his excavation plans, little is available on the form and extent of individual houses and nothing was known about their pos­sible arrangement into architectural compounds -a typical feature of north coast urban architec­ture (see Chapdelaine 2009). Similarly, until re­cently very little was known about access patterns inside residential spaces, the thoroughfares that must have existed to access the different residen­tial compounds, and the nature of the open plazas identified throughout the site. 
In 2008, our team from the University of West­ern Ontario undertook fieldwork at the Gallinazo Group in order to obtain data on the city mor­phology as part of ongoing investigations into ancient statecraft in the northern Andes (Millaire 2010a, 2010b). The extent of the visible ruins and surrounding landscape were first mapped us­ing a differential GPS unit to produce a detailed 3D elevation model of the site. This was followed by an attempt to map large areas of the buried city through shovel shining: removing the upper 10-15 cm of surface deposits with the shovel blade and large paint brushes to reveal the top of the walls. Although effective, this process is both time consuming and moderately intrusive, and the resulting map contains several gaps where the walls were buried under deeper deposits. We therefore turned to remote sensing and coring to produce a seamless map of the settlement and to explore specific questions about life in this an­cient city. 
City Size 
Although today the Gallinazo Group site is con­fined to the mounds that dominate the lower val­ley area, Heidy Fogel (1993) hypothesized that it once extended to the inter-mound area and that only the tallest structures had survived centuries of sediment accumulation and agricultural activity in the lower valley. According to Fogel 's calcu­lations, the Gallinazo Group would have been a city of exceptional size, covering an area of ca. 600 ha. In 2008, field walking and shovel test pitting were carried out to test this hypothesis, but the results were inconclusive (Millaire 20 IOb; Millaire and Eastaugh 20 I I). No evidence of oc­cupation was uncovered beyond the limits of the mounds, but the presence of a city deeply buried below the agricultural fields could not be ruled out due to the high water table that prevented ex­cavation of deep test pits. Soil coring and mag­netometer survey offered alternative ways to test Fogel's thesis and to assess the extent of this set­tlement, a first step in evaluating the population size and density of the ancient city. 
Soil coring is an effective method for assessing the stratigraphy of known archaeological sites, while also offering great potential for site dis­covery (Bouma I969; Boyer et al. 2006; Cannon 2000; Martindale et al. 2009; Stein I986). At the Gallinazo Group site, we extracted 45 cores to an average depth of 2 m with a JMC Environ­mentalist's Sub-Soil Probe from the flat area be­tween the mounds (Figure 3). An undisturbed la­goon stratigraphy and no archaeological levels were visible, although fragments of baked clay were found in three cores. This finding appeared to confirm previous surveys, suggesting that the settlement did not extend to the inter-mound area, although the resolution was admittedly coarse. 
In 2009, a magnetometer survey was also un­dertaken on and around Huaca Gallinazo to obtain a more continuous coverage around the tallest mound of the group. Magnetometer survey in ar­chaeology measures tiny differences (usually re­ferred to as anomalies) in the magnetic field of the earth that are created by human activity. Ob-

servable anomalies can result from a wide variety of cultural processes, including burning, the in­troduction of building materials such as stone and brick to an area, the decomposition and for­mation of rubbish pits, and the movement of top­soil. For this reason, magnetometry has become one of the most widely used and productive geo­physical methods used in archaeology today (Kvamme 2006). Seven areas covering 22,500 m2 were surveyed using a Geoscan FM256 Flux­gate Gradiometer (Figure 4). A broad-interval survey method was used to investigate the settle­ment edge and surrounding flats, with readings logged every 12.5 cm along parallel traverses spaced 50 cm apart within 20 m2 grids. On the mound, we used a close-interval survey method with readings logged every 12.5 cm along parallel traverses spaced 25 cm apart within 10 m2 grids. This allowed us to cover large areas quickly while still maintaining a high degree of resolution in key areas. All survey grids were laid out using the differential GPS unit. Readings were down­loaded into Geoplot 3 .0 and processed into images suitable for display. Individual images were sub­sequently imported into the geographic informa­tion system (GIS) we prepared for the site. 
In the fallowed lands surrounding Huaca Galli­nazo, the magnetometer survey results displays many parallel, linear positive anomalies running approximately northeast to southwest (Figure 5). These are the furrows and irrigation canals from a recent agricultural system. Also visible is a dirt trackway that runs across the southwestern comer of the survey area. In the southeastern corner of the survey area are the remnants of an earlier field system (Figure 5: Field system B), which is visible as a much weaker series of linear positive anomalies. Despite the many modern features visible in the surveys between the mounds, no evidence of archaeological remains relating to the city architecture was identified. This is in stark contrast to those survey areas abutting Huaca Gallinazo (Figures 5 and 6), where nu­merous orthogonal linear positive (seen as dark gray to black) and dipolar (seen as black and white) anomalies are visible. These clearly rep­resent the walls and other ar chaeological features relating to the city architecture already identified on the mound through shovel shining. Indeed, as many of our geophysical survey areas were im­mediately contiguous to-and in some cases over­lapped with-the shovel shining areas, walls and room layouts could easily be traced from one area to another. The results of the shovel shining thus provided a convenient and immediate source of information for ground trothing our magne­tometer results. 
From the magnetometer results we learn that there is an abrupt end to the settlement at the edge of the mound, confirming the results ob­tained through field walking, test pitting, and sub­soil coring. These all show that the ancient set­tlement was confined to the mounds. This new evidence suggests a more modest urban agglom­eration of ca. 40 ha, compared to Fogel's original estimate. Our results show that buildings were confined to the mounds and were possibly sur­rounded by agricultural fields. Based on these results, we have argued that the city once held a population of between 10,000 and 14,400 people

A Ground Plan for Huaca Gallinazo 
One of the key objectives of our research program is to characterize the ancient cityscape of the Gal­linazo Group. Moving beyond the simple di­chotomy of planned versus organic cities, we wish to document the coordinated arrangement of buildings and spaces (Smith 2007) and the in­terplay of top-down planning and bottom-up self-organization (Cowgill 2004) . Documenting such questions rests on acquiring new data on the ground plan of this ancient city, including infor­mation on the arrangement of houses, residential compounds, neighborhoods, districts, and possi­bly sprawls (Smith 20 10a, 20 10b), and their evo­lution through time . Because of the sheer scale of the ruins, in 2009 and 20 11 work focused on Huaca Gallinazo (Figure 4), the largest and tallest mound of the group believed to have been the seat of the highest state authorities (Millaire 20 10a, 20 10b). A strategy integrating magne­tometer and GPR surveys was adopted .

work was carried out around the mound of Huaca Gallinazo. As detailed above, the geophysical re­sults (Figure 6) together with the shovel shining survey show numerous adobe walls of the ancient city. Particularly clear are the walls that divide the residential area into separate compounds, which excavations have shown to be thicker (on average 60 cm wide) and more robust than those used in the construction of individual rooms (on average 30 cm). We also identified areas of dis­turbance most likely resulting from the looting of the site (Figures 5 and 6: D), as well as a num­ber of strong, circular, dipolar anomalies that are discussed in the following section. The results highlight the effectiveness of the magnetometer in the investigation of adobe architecture and should encourage its continued use in this region and in similar environments . 
In 20 11, a GPR survey was also undertaken in areas already surveyed with the magnetometer to test the effectiveness of this technique at the site. It was hoped that the GPR would identify more deeply buried architecture and enable us to investigate different depths separately, which we hoped would allow for an investigation of urban development over time. The GPR survey was carried out with a GSSI 400 MHz antenna with SIR 3000 controller. Thirty-four grids in three areas were surveyed over 10 days, covering 5 ,600 m2• The survey was conducted along parallel tra­verses spaced 25 cm apart with a scan density of 50 scan per meter within grids of various sizes to suit the uneven topography. The survey grids were laid out using the differential GPS unit. The radar data was processed in RAD AN 6.6 into im­ages suitable for display. GPR raw reflection data

are collected as a series of individual vertical traces, each made up of a series of waves of vary­ing amplitude, depending on the buried deposits (Conyers 2006, 2013). These can be manipulated through computer software to display horizontal amplitude slice maps at specified depths, allowing archaeologists to investigate different depths in plan view. The depths of these individual time­slice maps are calculated through velocity analy­sis, which estimates the speed at which the radar wave can propagate through the ground. The ac­curacy of these depth estimates can later be tested and modified through excavation. These processed images were subsequently imported into the GIS we made for the site, allowing for the direct comparison of the architecture identi­fied in the GPR survey to architecture identified with the magnetometer and shovel shining. 
The results of the GPR survey (Figure 7) were exceptional and clearly show the adobe walls, detailing the ground plan of the ancient city. Also identified were many floors and smaller archi­tectural features, including benches, doorways, and alcoves within individual rooms. Although interpretation of the GPR survey results could be achieved to some degree through comparison with the shovel shining survey, in some cases, further test excavations were required to fully understand the data. For example, the observed difference in the amplitude of the return radar signal within rooms (viewed as different shades of gray) was clearly related to differences in the deposits in the rooms. Excavations in one area (Figure 8) revealed that, while the variation in the amplitude of the return signal resulted from the interface between different fills, including clay floors, sand, crumbled adobe, ash, refuse, wind-blown sand, or different combinations of the latter, there was no simple correlation between observed amplitude and deposit type. For exam­ple, although beaten clay floors produced high amplitude reflections (seen as black in our re­sults), they could not be distinguished from nat­urally occurring saltpeter patches caused by the efflorescence of salts from within the clay. These leave crystalline deposits on the surface of the bricks and floors. 
Features that were more readily identifiable included looters' pits excavated through room floors and subsequently filled with windblown sand. This proved invaluable when choosing sub­sequent excavation areas because it allowed dis­turbed deposits to be avoided. Numerous other anomalous features identified in the results have yet to be ground truthed in the coming years, in­cluding two elongated features (ca. 1.5 m x 30 cm) inside individual rooms (Figure 7: B), strongly reminiscent of sub-floor household burials-a typical grave form on the Peruvian north coast (Millaire 2002). 
Overall, the GPR data reveal the presence of a number of large residential compounds with walls that share similar orientation, often surrounded by thicker perimeter walls and bounded by alleyways. These architectural compounds feature aggluti­nated units of different forms and sizes, including large, open, court-like spaces, medium-sized rooms, and small-sized cubicles. Some rooms were apparently accessed through doorways, while oth­ers featured a check entrance: a typical architectural form on the Peruvian north coast. A number of spaces have no noticeable entry point. However, they do have something that suggests the use of high thresholds between rooms (often eroded off), another typical feature of north coast architecture. The alleys are relatively narrow (1.3 m wide) and follow labyrinthine patterns. 
Apart from a general north-south alignment of the residential and civic structures at the site, there is no obvious sign of central planning. In­stead, the ground plan suggests that the people responsible for the construction and maintenance of individual compounds (members of extended families?) followed a semi-orthogonal urban block design in which individual house blocks abut neighboring compounds. The overall layout results from the actions of individual builders making additions to existing rectangular houses or building new houses adjacent to a standing structure (Smith 2007). 
Test excavations also allowed us to establish the degree to which the GPR could identify more deeply buried deposits. Given that one of the goals of this survey was to acquire data on the evolution of the city through time, we hoped to identify changes in the layout of the urban plan (see Leckebusch 2003). Figure 9 shows four am­plitude slice maps for the same area at different depths (0-10 cm, 10-20 cm, 20-30 cm, 30-40 cm). The image sharpness decreased rapidly from

top to bottom as the radar signal became attenu­ated, despite the relatively shallow depth (ca. 50 cm). This is due to the high concentrations of salt in the deposits at Huaca Gallinazo, as well as the complex mud brick architecture that is in­creasingly damp with depth, all of which attenu­ated the radar signal. Although this shallow pen­etration limited our ability to investigate changes in architecture over time, some alterations can be observed. These tend to be more transitory features, such as internal dividing walls or smaller architectural features like benches , rather than the main compound wall, as observed in the dif­ferences between the 0-10 cm and 10-20 cm am­plitude slices (Figure 9). Thus, while few changes in the overall layout of the main urban plan can be observed, the GPR data do allow us to inves­tigate changes at a smaller level, both spatially and temporally, within individual rooms. 
The full potential of the GPR data becomes apparent in three-dimensional space, which offers unparalleled possibilities for visualization, inter­pretation, and dissemination to the general public. Figure 10 presents an entire dataset collected from Architectural Compound 2 that displays the results as a three-dimensional isosurface rendered in Voxler 3. The volumes (walls and other ar­chaeological features) are generated by ascribing thresholds beyond which the voxels (data cube with value corresponding to the reflected radar signals) are set to transparent-a first step in in­terpretation (Leckebusch 2003). Taking advantage of the three-dimensional nature of human visual perception, this isosurface delivers a large amount of information on the general layout of an ancient residential compound, including room size, access patterns, and potential presence of platforms and side benches. This type of data will be an essential building block for creating accurate computer­generated renderings of the ancient cityscape of Huaca Gallinazo. 
Room Function and Activity Areas 

The combined use of magnetometer and GPR techniques at Huaca Gallinazo also proved to be a very successful recipe for investigating room function and activity areas. The magnetometer survey results in area A (Figure 8) revealed a num­ber of strong, circular, dipolar anomalies (seen as

black and white) aligned approximately north to south. This type of anomaly is often indicative of in situ high temperature burning, when the ferro­magnetic substances in the materials being heated become completely demagnetized as they reach their Curie point (675 °C for hematite and 565 °C for magnetite). On cooling, the compounds are re-magnetized en masse to the earth's geomagnetic field (Clark 1990). This results in a dipolar anom­aly, reminiscent of a yin-yang symbol oriented north-south, with the negative aligned to the mag­netic north at time of firing. The position of these anomalies along room walls identified by the GPR strongly suggested that they were kitchen hearths, something that was confirmed through excavation. Having the capacity to identify the location hearths from the magnetometer data in conjunction with a detailed plan view provided by the GPR data prior to excavation allows us to better estimate the location of kitchens at the site-a significant advantage for our ongoing food procurement, stor­age, and consumption study projects (Masur 2012; Szpak, Longstaffe, et al. 2012; Szpak, Millaire, et al. 2012; Szpak et al. 2013; Szpak, Longstaffe, et al. 2014; Szpak, Millaire, et al. 2014; Venet­Rogers 2013). 
Discussion 

This article explored the potential of geophysical survey techniques for studying early urban life on the north coast of Peru. Data collected at the Gallinazo Group site in the lower Vini Valley provided invaluable information concerning the size of the city, population density, and the mor­phology and growth patterns characteristic of in­cipient urbanism. Moreover, our study points to the value of integrating geophysical survey as part of archaeological research design, while highlighting the importance of a multifaceted ap­proach integrating various techniques that to­gether contribute to a more accurate characteri­zation of the subsurface deposits and underlying archaeological features. The GPR was pmticularly valuable in providing extremely detailed visual­ization of the urban plan down to individual fea­tures within rooms, but the magnetometer was better able to characterize their nature, identifying hearths and areas of burning. The magnetometer was also able to map areas of the site where ground conditions were not suitable for the use of the GPR, such as low scrub and agricultural fields featuring furrows and irrigation canals. 
Data from the soil coring and magnetometer surveys also revealed that the widely accepted figures for the city size and population estimates needed to be revised. Based on our latest assess­ment, the city spread over an area of ca. 40 ha at its peak and had a population of 10,000 to 14,400 individuals (Millaire and Eastaugh 2011). Mag­netometer and ground-penetrating radar surveys on the largest and tallest mound of the group gen­erated a ground plan for this ancient city, reveal­ing the presence of an agglutinated cityscape fea­turing civic buildings, plazas, and residential compounds connected by a complex network of narrow alleyways. The surveys also suggested that, although the internal plan of individual rooms evolved through time, the footprint of res­idential compounds generally remained constant. This was confirmed by excavations in different sectors of the site. 
These surveys were extremely successful and highlight the benefits of a multifaceted approach that integrates a variety of techniques (in our case magnetometry, GPR, soil probing, shovel shining, and test excavations) applied to the study of early urban life. These mostly non-intrusive techniques are not only heritage-friendly, but also capable of generating large quantities of data quickly (of­ten visualized in real time), helping archaeologists to strategize field interventions so as to minimize site destruction while maximizing results. Despite recent advances in instrumentation and process­ing, until now only a few Andeanists have inte­grated remote sensing into their research designs, but, even in these cases, the use of these instru­ments is often ad hoc, based on episodic collab­oration with geophysicists. This strongly contrasts with other areas of the world, such as the United Kingdom, where remote sensing has come to rep­resent an integral component of any archaeolog­ical intervention, from prospection to problem solving (Conyers and Leckebusch 2010; Kvamme 2003, 2006; Thompson et al. 2011). 
Work is ongoing on the analysis of the results, and further survey is still needed at Huaca Galli­nazo and on other mounds in the group to estab­lish whether similar urban architecture can be an­ticipated or functional differences can be

observed. Additional techniques, including resis­tivity and magnetic susceptibility survey, are planned to establish how these complementary methods can add to our knowledge of the site. Much of this work will be possible with minimal impact to the site, and as our knowledge increases, our need to excavate will inevitably diminish, enabling us to investigate larger areas of ancient urbanscape in the same amount of time and with the same level of funding. This will allow for the creation of large-scale three-dimensional visual­ization that will be critical for investigating life in Viru residential compounds, activities carried out inside specialized buildings, movements through space, and the use of public places. These three-dimensional renderings will also be instru­mental in promoting knowledge mobilization by providing the general public with direct visual evidence on how those who once lived here went on with their daily lives. 
At Huaca Gallinazo, remote sensing went be­yond generating data-rich visual representations and was used to address specific research prob­lems, including evaluating the size of the settle­ment, generating a detailed ground plan for the ancient city, and addressing the function of indi­vidual rooms within each residential compound. Our survey techniques also helped identify areas with high archaeological potential for answering specific questions about life in a big city, therein saving significant amounts of time, labor, and pub­lic funds. It also generated large quantities of data on the geomorphology of the area, on the nature of settlement patterns, on ancient urban morphol­ogy, and on Early Intermediate period architectural design in Viru. We hope that, in the coming years, close-to-ground geophysical techniques will be used more broadly on the Peruvian north coast and in similar environments around the world.
