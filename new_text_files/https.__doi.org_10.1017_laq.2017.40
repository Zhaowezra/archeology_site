A corps of talented Andean bioarchaeologists, com­prehensively addressing multiple lines of evidence from large North Coast skeletal samples with often-excellent preservation, have arguably brought the study of ritual violence on ancient human bodies to a more advanced point than anywhere else in the world. In a signi.cant new book, originating in a 2011 SAA symposium, Haagen Klaus and J. Marla Toyne collect 12 studies to showcase this rapidly expanding body of research. The resulting volume is comprehensive and well organized, and the overall quality of the individual papers is high. Some document new samples that have not been published before, such as the Matrix 101 large-scale sacri.ce deposit from the heart of Sican’s central precinct (in a chapter by Klaus and Izumi Shi­mada). Others apply meticulous new analyses to well-known cases. The chapters are organized into sections spotlighting variation and continuity over time, the question of victims’ identities, and forms of animal and object sacri.ce. Concluding discussions by Tif.ny Tung and Vera Tiesler, scholars working outside the North Coast, round out the volume. The overall thrust of the book is empirical rather than programmatic; attending closely to evidentiary patterns, contributors develop a number of fruitful insights. 
Chapters on Moche captive warriors and sacri.ce in the Lambayeque-La Leche region stand out for their depth and richness. Laurel Hamilton’s detailed study of sharp force trauma on sacri.ced bodies at the Huaca de la Luna brings into focus complex sequences of torture and postmortem mutilation, and how they changed over about four centuries. Along with Heather Backo’s taphonomic study documenting the selective removal and repositioning of body parts at Plaza 3A, this new analysis highlights the extended, multistage process of Moche sacri.ce, with multiple occasions for display and manipulation of the victims and their corpses. 
Several strong chapters consider diversity over time and across contexts in the Lambayeque area, where recent excavations have recovered sacri.cial deposits on an unprecedented scale. They include a contribution by Klaus and Shimada exploring the contrast between Middle Sican sacri.cial practices in elite monumental contexts versus nonelite communi­ties; a chapter by Klaus and colleagues on a long­term program of sacri.ce at Chotuna-Chornancap, spanning the Chimu-to-Inca timeframe; and one by Toyne on the scores of accumulated sacri.ces at Túcume’s Templo de la Piedra Sagrada. 
As an edited book, the volume is unusually coher­ent. Not only are there many overlapping threads between chapters, from methodological techniques to the perennial question of victim identity and the distinction between violation and veneration, but the papers in combination highlight fascinating patterns of continuity and diversity in sacri.cial practice in this region. Toyne, Klaus, and John Verano have made a strong case for a coherent North Coast tradition of blood sacri.ce using speci.c bodily practices that must have been handed down, perhaps by specialists, through the rise and fall of political regimes. With others such as Hamilton, they have established that, for more than a thousand years, the preferred technique of blood sacri.ce in this region was repetitive throat slitting with a sharp metal knife on the anterior surface of the throat, performed by a sacri.cer who was posi­tioned behind or above the victim. By at least AD 850, chest opening was also performed on victims whose throats had been cut, and this practice persisted for over 500 years. However, the victims of these convention­alized acts of violence shifted from captive warriors at the Huaca de la Luna and Pacatnamú to local com­moner children and men at Cerro Cerrillos, Chotuna-Chornancap, and Túcume in Lambayeque, who were given simple but respectful burial after their violent deaths. Throat cutting was also selected as the mode

of execution for enemy villagers who were swiftly killed but not evidently sacri.ced in a religious sense at Punta Lobos, discussed in a chapter by Verano and Sara Phillips. As victims’ identities changed, so did the premortem and postmortem treatment of sacri.ced bodies. Scale – the number of victims – and tempo – the frequency of sacri.ce events – also seem to have been quite malleable. These remarkable paradoxes of conti­nuity and change are on full display in this book. While the physical motions of killing remained essentially the same, the victims, the context, the audience, the rulers, and perhaps the supernatural beings, changed radically and so, we must assume, did the meanings of these violent performances for those involved. 
Standing in contrast with blood sacri.ce are forms of killing that kept the body intact, such as strangula­tion or live interment. They are discussed in several of the chapters, including one by David Chicoine for Huambacho in the Nepeña valley, and by Sylvia Bentley and Klaus for retainer burials over time. These “quieter” kinds of sacri.ce were usually associated with different categories of victims than blood sacri.ce (e.g., women versus men), with different social classes of practitioners (as Klaus and Shimada argue for Sican versus Muchik sacri.ces in Lambayeque), with different contexts (retainers and dedicatory burials versus offerings), and with speci.c ritual meanings, as in Inca capac hucha sacri.ces. Chicoine argues that, for the Moche, different metaphors of animal preda­tion informed blood sacri.ce (felines) and ligature (constrictor serpents). Given the lasting importance of blood sacri.ce, bloodless sacri.ce may have been performed in deliberate counterpoint to it, constructing distinct categories of victims for distinct kinds of occasions. These correspondences shifted over time and space, however, and are still poorly understood. Retainer burials, which may have been quite variable in practice, pose a particularly dif.cult challenge for interpretation. Two chapters, by Catherine Gaither and colleagues on Santa Rita B (in Chao) and by Elsa Tomasto-Cagigao and colleagues on San Jose de Moro, address Late Moche to Transitional period interments that accompanied principal individuals. A few bear perimortem blunt-force trauma, and atypical body positions and postmortem manipulation suggest retainer sacri.ce while defying easy categorization. 
One particularly interesting angle of the book is the explicit consideration of the link between human sacri.ce and the destruction of non-human beings. Paul Szpak and colleagues offer a thoughtful discus­sion of sacri.ced camelids at Huancaco in Virú and beyond. Sacri.ced camelids were sometimes treated in very similar ways to human victims, possibly con­sidered analogous. The smashing, “decapitation,” and “wounding” of ceramics, especially anthropomorphic vessels, also accompanied human sacri.ce, and in some cases may have stood in for it (discussed in chapters by Jean-François Millaire and others). These points reinforce the notion that while sacri.cial liturgy on the North Coast appears conservative in some respects, it was in many ways highly amenable to substitution and innovation. 
Through the meticulous documentation of sacri.­cial violence that took place over more than a thousand years, these authors have achieved remarkable insights and amassed material for a deeper understanding of how ritual tradition works and how it evolves. It is therefore slightly disappointing that Klaus and Toyne do not attempt a more ambitious synthesis with their introductory chapter. While they lay out some conceptual tools from general theoretical literature on sacri.ce, these tools remain mostly unused. However, perhaps it is premature to desire synthesis from a .eld in such rapid .ux, treating such a multivalent phenomenon. This new volume impressively captures the current state of knowledge about North Coast sacri.ce in all its hair-raising speci.city.

The link between objects and the social and cultural behaviors responsible for their manufacture, distri­bution, meaning, and use remains one of the most dif.cult, if not contentious, parts of archaeological interpretation. This book presents case studies about the social dimensions of learning that lie behind objects. Centered around the notion of ‘communities of practice’, the book crosses disciplinary boundaries: six are archeological, two are ethnographic, and one uses a historical approach. Only two use data from Latin America; the remainder uses data from the Southwest (N = 2), the Southeast (N = 2), and Africa (N = 3). 
As the book covers such diverse areas and disci­plines, it might seem that it would not be relevant to the readers of Latin American Antiquity. To the contrary, the theme of the book focuses on the concepts of com­munities of practice, situated learning, constellations of practice, and associated concepts that can be applied in any area.
