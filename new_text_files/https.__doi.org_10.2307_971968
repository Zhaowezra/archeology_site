REVIEWS AND BOOK NOTES 
struction and communication of Inka history. The chap­ters on architecture present the archaeological evidence to indicate that architectural styles varied with different Inka kings. 
The book is well organized. The first two chapters discuss how the events of Late Inka history-from the ascension of Pachacuti until the appearance of the Spaniards-must be understood in the context of the politicization of that history by its principal participants, the Inka kings. In the absence of written records, the kings were able to forge a place in history through the manipulation of verbal and material indicators of their deeds and importance. Because much of Inka history was presented verbally by specialized individuals, the rulers and the descendants who venerated their memory could define the material that composed these oral histories. The detailed discussion of the specific sources of histor­ical information (cantars, poems, speeches, quipus, deathbed orations) is therefore illuminating, as it shows the manipulation of each of these sources. This informa­tion, in tum, could be manipulated by the Spaniards who wrote down the histories. An extended example of the latter is presented in the first chapter in a comparison of Sarmiento de Gamboa's history of the Inkas with that of Juan de Betanzos. Chapter 3 focuses on the material record of the rulers that was used in the service of record­ing and remembering the deeds of a particular king. The chapter ends with a discussion of the architectural fea­tures that were used for these purposes, such as palaces and royal estates. 
Chapters 4 through 8 focus on Huayna Capac, the eleventh Inka king and the last to rule a united empire. Chapters 4 and 5 deal with the ethnohistory of Huayna Capac's rule and his royal estate in the Urubamba Valley. Chapters 6 and 7 describe the extant architecture on the estate, while Chapter 8 summarizes the salient features that define an architectural style for Huayna Capac. The final chapter provides an excellent summary of this style in relation to other Inka kings and the work of others on Inka architecture. 
This volume provides a rare glimpse into the kinds of interpretations that can result when there is both a rich ethnohistorical record and significant archaeological remains for a particular region. Niles has done an excep­tional job of comparing the Spanish accounts pertaining to the royal estate in Urubamba to the archaeological remains. She clearly identifies the extant architecture as it relates to the Spanish documents and notes where there are discrepancies, usually ethnohistoric descriptions with no remaining architecture. Her broader interpretations of Huayna Capac's style, drawn from this estate and other built remains from Cuzco to Tomebamba in Ecuador, are convincing. The distinctive features of this style are best displayed at Quispiguanca, the main architectural com­pound and residence of the king on his Urubamba estate. These include symmetric towers and external niches overlooking an artificial lake, plus a Great Hall and other buildings within the compound. Similar features at other sites-notably the Casana palace in Cuzco, the Temple of Viracocha at Raqchi, and certain features at Tomebamba in Ecuador-also are said to pertain to the rule of this king. 
What is more valuable than the definition of this style, however, is the discussion of its rationale. Niles' concise arguments support her position that Huayna Capac (or his architect, Sinchi Roca) deliberately invent­ed a style of his own as a visual symbol of his authority and as a means of securing his place in Inka history. This relates to the information presented in the earlier chapters of the book. 
Niles' book is a monument to the extraordinary kind of information that can be gleaned from a careful reading of detailed Spanish documents about an Inka site, cou­pled with a detailed architectural study of the remains of that site. It is a model of such studies. Unfortunately, as the author herself notes, such detailed documents are sel­dom available for other sites, and so comparative studies will be difficult. This point is not meant to detract from this study, but to lament the lack of documents of com­parable detail for other areas and kings. Archaeologists also will lament the lack of a more detailed survey and testing program that might provide some of the missing parts of the estate, such as the towns of the original inhabitants of the valley or the villages of the 2,000 miti­maes (colonists) brought to work the estate for Huayna Capac. Surely some remains must be present that could be identified, and such additional research would aug­ment the work reported. 
Editorially, The Shape of Inca History is well pre­sented, with excellent drawings and photographs. The reconstructions of Quispiguanca and other structures, drawn by Robert Batson, are helpful in visualizing the actual architecture as it may have appeared to its inhabi­tants. This volume will be an important addition to the literature on both Inka ethnohistory and architecture. Its explanation of the architectural remains is consistent with the modem view of the Inka kings, their descen­dants, and the Spaniards who all manipulated history for their own purposes.
