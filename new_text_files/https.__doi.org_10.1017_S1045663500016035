Based on four cri­teria,thisnewtypologyisbothagglomerativeandpoly­thetic.Thefirstcriterion,rawmaterial,isusedtosorttheassemblage into groups and variants.Technology is thesecond criterion, and the core of this typology relies onit as over a hundred individual pastes are initiallydescribed and later arranged into a series of 13 wares,which have chronological validity. A third criterion ofanalysisincorporatesmorphologyandfunctiontocreatevessel classes and categories, and a fourth and final cri­terion introduces decoration. The result is a typologythat relates wares and vessel types with temporalcogency. The final result is noteworthy, although thedetailed descriptions of the pastes and the drawings ofthevesselsaretedious,ofvariablequality,anditisoftendifficult to sort apart some pastes without recourse tothin­sections and other analytical and visual aids. Thenew typology is a welcome addition to Titicaca basinarchaeology, considering that most scholars working inthebasinhavepassivelycontendedwiththemultifacetedvariabilitythatcharacterizesoverthreemillenniaofsoci­eties occupying the region by opting to use longer tem­poral periods, which conceal all but the most obvioussociopolitical changes (i.e., the expansion of theTiwanaku state or the advent of Inca conquest). I hopethat new studies will test and improve its effectiveness.
The third chapter includes the description of thenearly 500 archaeological sites documented during thesurveyofHuancanéandPutina.Twolargetablesincludesitedescriptions,elevations,temporalphases,andotherdataforallhabitationandcemeterysites.Thesitedescrip­tions, often illustrated by photographs, are succinct butotherwise suitable.

Two diagnostic sherds were used to assigna temporal phase to a site, except for late intermediateperiod wares, which required three.
The fourth chapter uses the theoretical frameworkdeveloped at the beginning of the book to describe theregion’ssettlement system and itschangethrough time.The authors use broad­scale maps to show the changesin the distribution of habitation sites over 13 phases. In addition,theArchaicperiodisbrieflydiscussed,asmanysites associated with this period were recorded, but nomaps for this period are provided. This chapter is briefand mostly notes either major trends or impressionistichypotheseswithoutquantitativeanalysis,whichremindsthe reader that the volume is mostly a presentation ofdata, leaving broader analysis and interpretations forlater publications. In this respect, the book is comple­mentedbytwoappendicesthatconsistofpictures,draw­ings, and tabular data of diagnostic ceramic sherds andlithic bifaces (mostly consisting of projectile points).
Given theimportance ofthe LakeTiticaca Basin forunderstandingtheemergenceandconsequencesofsocialcomplexity, the data contained in this volume are sub­stantive. Moreover, the data sets presented here willguideandcontextualizefutureresearchintheregionforyears to come.

LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 27, No. 2, 2016] 
like a regional studies journal than an edited volume.Nevertheless, the introduction of new research andintriguing findings makes this book a must­have forMesoamerican scholars. 
Some of the most informative papers in the volumepresent synthetic coverage of recent research initiativeswithin the state of Oaxaca. For example, Blomster pro­vides an overview of his research relating to Formative­period Etlatongo, in the MixtecaAlta. Similarly, Levineand Joyce present an interesting summary of their workat PostclassicTututepec on the Oaxaca Coast.Althoughbothcontainsubstantive,clearlywrittendiscussions,theyappeartofunctionmostlyasanopportunityfortheauthorsto summarize already­published research in a Spanish­language venue. While this is commendable and neces­sary, the broader audience may be more attracted to thecomprehensive overviews of archaeological research inthe underreported regions of the Sierra Mazateca andIsthmusofTehuantepecprovided byMunn and MontielÁngeles and colleagues. In a classic style, Munn placestherelativelyscantarchaeologicalrecordfromtheSierraMazateca, which consists mostly of reconnaissance andearly­to mid­twentieth­century salvage projects, in itsgeographic, ethnographic, and historic context. Perhapsby design, this paper demonstrates the rich potential forresearch­oriented projects in the region and leaves thereader asking for more. For their part, Montiel Ángelesand colleagues deftly summarize temporal shifts in set­tlementpatterns,residentialorganization,burialpatterns,andartifactassemblagesfromtheirresearchintheJalapadel Marqués Valley on the Oaxacan side of the Isthmusof Tehuantepec. This work is well supported with clearand relevant graphics (maps, drawings, etc.) and willserve as an important reference for scholars working inMesoamerica, especially Oaxaca andVeracruz.
In addition to the summary works, there also areseveral chapters addressing a wide range of particulartopics. Urcid employs his characteristically exhaustiveiconographic analysis to reinterpret the narrative of thefamouscarvedstonesatDainzúandtheirimportanceinLate­Terminal Formative Oaxaca. Although I do notfully agree with his conclusions, he does provide animportant discussion that should be seriously consid­ered. Similarly, Martínez López and Markens revisitarchaeologicalandhistoricevidencefromHuitzointheEtla Valley. Rivera Guzmán contributes an intriguinginterpretationfortheprehispanicuseofacarvedhumanmandiblefromtheMixtecaBaja,butIwouldpointinter­ested readers to a more in­depth treatment of the samematerialbyRiveraGuzmán(HablandoSobrelosAnces­tros: Una Mandíbula Humana con Grabados del Estilo Ñuiñe.ContributionstoNewWorldArchaeology7:141– 158, 2014). In a continuation of his extensive work onPostclassic polychrome ceramics from Oaxaca and Puebla, Lind explores the function of vessel formsdepicted in scenes from the Mixteca­Puebla stylecodices, while Sánchez Santiago and Diego Lunaemploy the Mixtec codices to explore connectionsbetween ceramic effigy vessels and ancestor worshiprituals. I enjoyed Sánchez Santiago and CortésVilchis’archaeomusicologicalstudyofthemusicalinstrumentsrecovered from the Jalapa del Marqués project, a greatcombination of experimental and contextual evidence.
Due to their somewhat speculative nature, the threemostintellectuallyprovocativecontributionstothevol­ume involve caves. First, Pohl and Urcid examine pre­hispanicwallpaintings,aswellasanincisedbonescepter,from a cave in the Mixteca Baja. They compare theimages to pilgrimage myths from various ethnohistoricsourcestoultimatelytracktheimportanceofthecavetovarious ethnic and political groups over time. Second,PohlandWinterdiscusspossiblesyncreticimplicationsfortheimagesdepictedonthreepeculiarartifactsrecov­eredfromacaveintheMazatecaregion,whichcontainedvariousofferingsandhumanburials.Ofalltheworksinthis volume, however, the one that will undoubtedlyreceive the most attention describes the recent findingsin the Cave of Rey Kong­Oy in the Sierra Mixe.

Inaninformative butfrustratinglyshortpaper,Hut­son analyzes a private collection of artifacts from theSierra Mixe. Interestingly, several of these materialsbear strong resemblance to objects found in the centralvalleysandtheMixteca,suggestingsignificantinterac­tionacrossgeographicandlinguistic boundaries.Like­wise, Markens and Winter’s report of the salvageexcavationofatombfromthesameregiondemonstratessimilarities in mortuary practices with other areas ofOaxaca. This gets to the heart of my only major sub­stantive criticism: the editors’ concept of “two Oaxa­cas,” which aims to refocus Oaxacan archaeologytoward examining the distinct prehistoric trajectoriesbetweenspeakersoflanguagesinthetwomainfamilies:Otomanguean and Mixe­Zoque. While they laudablyargueagainstassociatingartifactassemblageswithpar­ticular linguistic or ethnic groups, their reconceptual­ization misses the mark in that it merely moves thegoalposts to contain larger geographically and linguis­tically defined “culture areas.” I think a far betterapproachwouldenvisiontheprehispanicinhabitantsofOaxaca as members of various interconnecting socialnetworks,whichwecanexplorethroughtheidentifica­

As stated by both the editors and the discussant, JoelPalka,thisvolumerepresentsatimelyadditioninEnglishto a little understood but major Mesoamerican culture.It will certainly mark a before and after for the non­Spanish reading audience. It clearly states how the“Huasteca” must be understood primarily as a coastalregion,tothenortheastofMexicoCity,alwaysinhabitedby a variety of linguistic groups, agriculturalist andnomads, that were in contact with their Mesoamericanneighbors both from the South (Gulf and Maya) andfrom the central Mexican highlands, as well as with thenorthern highlands and southeastern United States. Italso makes clear how it must be separated, analytically,fromtheHuastec,Wastekan,orTeneek(Mayan)speakersthat may or may not have been present in the region fora long part of the culture sequence.
Theintroductionbytheeditorssummarizesboththehistory of research and the major notions developedaround the Huasteca, emphasizing that, culturally, theregionalwaysmaintainedadistinctcharacter.Theobjec­tives stated are threefold (p. 6): to understand theHuastecainintra­andinterregionalcontext,toinvestigatecontinuityandchangefromthePreclassictotheColonialperiods, and to counter the misconception that theHuastecawasisolatedorperipheral.Theauthorsachievethis using an interdisciplinary approach, including con­tributions from archaeologists active in Huastec fieldarchaeology (Ahuja, Alarcón, Zaragoza, Dávila) andiconography(Faust,Richter),aswellasagronomistandsocialanthropologistRuvalcaba;therestofthe contrib­utorsarearthistorians(Koontz,Wyllie),aswellasotherspecialists:Taube(iconographer),Houston(epigrapher),Robertson (linguist), and Palka (archaeologist).

Refuting the early Maya Gulf coast continuum model,theypositthepossibilityofaLateClassiccoastalmove­mentfromSouthtoNorth,basedonlinguisticsimilaritieswith Western Mayan Tzeltal/Ch’olan.

A.D. 100–500 and the recent reevaluations that some ceramic diagnostics, like Prisco Negro, may not be asearly as originally thought. This could suggest that thesite had the disrupted sequence common in the region,with a long sequence culminating in a Late Preclassicapogee, followed by a near abandonment, occupationresuming in the Late Classic and Early Postclassic withNorth Central Veracruz and Maya connections, laterreplaced by the distinctive Late Postclassic Huastecassemblage.
