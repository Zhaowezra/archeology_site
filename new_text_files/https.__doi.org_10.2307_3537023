nate the process of formation and to characterize the emergence of the singular Tarascan state, which is dif­ferent from the Mexica state, as characteristically Mesoamerican. Pollard's articles expand and develop the original substantive and interpretative scholarship she offered in her book, Tariacuri's Legacy: The Prehispanic Tarascan State. The penultimate articles in the book are on obsidian sources and on production and use, the former by Efrain Cardenas Garcia and the lat­ter by Dan M. Healan. The final article, by Francisco Valdez and Catherine Liot, is on the salt beds on the western Tarascan frontier in the Sayula Basin. 
My message to readers of Latin American Antiquity is to seize the opportunity to read about west Mexico. The publications are now at hand. You will find new information on Mexico, challenges to current ideas about civilization, and fresh insights on the formation of states. Once you read them, Mesoamerica will never look the same. 
The Politics of Symbolism in the Mixtec Codices. 
JOHN M. D. POHL. Vanderbilt University, Nashville, 1994. xii + 171 pp., 56 figures, footnotes, bibliography, appendix. Price unknown (paper).

As the largest corpus of Late Postclassic manuscripts in existence, the Mixtec codices preserve a wealth of information pertaining to every aspect of society and culture. Codex studies have traditionally focused on genealogical constructs and toponymic decipherments, but new analytical methods have transformed our com­prehension of these codices. In this book, Pohl uses the symbolic features of costuming to isolate four specific political roles, supported by archaeological data, colo­nial documentation, and modern ethnographic accounts. Further, Pohl outlines aspects of Postclassic political competition based on codical accounts of the tactics used by rival elites claiming succession to the same hereditary titles. 
In the first chapter, Pohl summarizes the literature on Mixtec sociopolitical organization, and lays the methodological groundwork for his analysis of political maneuvering as reflected in the costume symbolism of rival elites and the costumes of individuals giving sup­port to elite competitors, including ritual arbitrators, >tewards, oracles, and foreign ambassadors. Chapters 2 through 5 each focus on one of these supporting roles. fhe sixth and final chapter is a brief summary. 
The ambitious scope of Pohl's book is also a signif­
cant weakness. By this I mean that the average length of each chapter is about 25 pages-much too brief to adequately cover any of the four topics. A collection of four large monographs would be more appropriate. Therefore each chapter is like an analytical "pilot study," using only two or three codical examples to establish the diagnostic symbolic features of an institu­tionalized sociopolitical role. Although Pohl initially acknowledges the tentative nature of each construct, subsequent references tend to present these constructs as firmly established postulates. 
Another significant problem lies in Pohl's transla­tion and interpretation of Mixtec terminology. Lexical data must be treated like any other systematic database; Pohl uses only terms that agree with his constructs, ignoring alternative forms and meanings that do not "fit." This is comparable to an archaeologist who asserts that "the occupants of Building X used poly­chrome ceramics" but fails to say only two polychrome sherds were found among five hundred other sherds. Worse, some terms are contextually inappropriate and a few translations are incorrect. Readers should ignore Pohl's use of Mixtec terminology and evaluate each chapter accordingly. Fortunately, this adjustment is of little consequence in chapters 2, 4, and 5, but half of the analysis in chapter 3 is affected by this problem. 
Chapter 2 examines evidence for the existence of a council of four priests that functioned in an advisory and judicial capacity within each Mixtec kingdom. Pohl demonstrates that the council helped settle dis­putes between local elite factions when legitimate inheritance or succession is contested. Pohl also claims the council had a responsibility to maintain certain "sacred bundles." These bundles appear to represent tangible proof of ancient elite origins and, in some sense, the bundles sanctify the territorial rights of local elite lineages. Pohl's argument is convincing, although he never explains how the council of four priests can be distinguished from scores of other priests who appear in Mixtec codices. 
Chapter 3 considers individuals who wear the tor­toise-shell costuming of the fire-serpent. Examples of this costume are quite rare in the codices, but we know these individuals are called "sorcerers that fly in dark­ness" in sixteenth-century language sources. Using data from the 1544 Yanhuitlan Inquisition trial together with fascinating examples of Spanish symbolism asso­ciated with St. Dominic, St. Francis, and St. John, Pohl constructs an excellent argument that associates the fire-serpent costume with a priest that carries out ritual acts of human sacrifice. The office is often given to a ruler's sibling. Pohl also claims the fire-serpent priest was something like a steward, managing tribute, food stores, and the market, but these economic functions

LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 7, No. 1, 1996] 
are analytically dependent on problematic translations 
of important Mixtec terms. 
Chapter 4 discusses evidence for sacred oracles and 
their use during periods of political instability. Oracles 
regulate regional political conflicts beyond the "juris­
diction" of local priestly councils. Impersonators of the 
earth-deity, Lady 9-Grass, are an example of oracle­
priests; the codices indicate that rulers from different 
kingdoms consulted with 9-Grass during a period of 
dynastic failure at Tilantongo. Likened to "popes" by 
the Spanish, the sanctified authority of an oracle was 
superior to that of any paramount. 
Chapter 5 also deals with regional political relation­ships, but the emphasis here is on sources of ritual alliance and oracular support (i.e., nonmarital) origi­nating from non-Mixtec kingdoms. In a genuinely mas­terful synthesis, Pohl uses documentation from the Cholula region and the Chocho area immediately north of the Mixteca Alta to explain the identity of a foreign ally named 4-Jaguar in the codical biographies of Lord 8-Deer and Lord 4-Wind; the codices indicate Lord 4­Jaguar is from a place called "Tula." 
Despite the limited scope and problematic use of Mixtec terminology, this book illuminates several important facets of the information contained in the Mixtec codices. Pohl's thought-provoking work should inspire others to view native texts in a new light, and stimulate others to explore their rich content. The book is required reading for Oaxaca and Puebla specialists, and is highly recommended to anyone interested in Mesoamerican politics.

Propone al lector un analisis de la situaci6n de la poblaci6n indigena americana desde los tiempos colombinos. Los textos incluyen bulas papales y trata­dos, opiniones de juristas (Vitoria), documentos admin­istrativos (ordenanzas reales, instrucciones a las autoridades americanas sobre el tratamiento de los nativos de America, etc), e informes (Garces, Castro). Asimismo trae textos de cronistas (Pedro Martir [era clerigo, no fraile], Acosta Uesufta, no fraile], Oviedo, Las Casas, Cortes, Diaz de! Castillo, Sahagun, Cieza de Leon y el an6nimo de Tlatelolco).

Response to Claude-Frarn;ois Baudez 
Submitted by Marilyn Beaudry-Corbett and John S. Henderson 
We are pleased that Baudez acknowledges that our vol­ume, Pottery of Prehistoric Honduras: Regional Classfjication and Analysis (Latin American Antiquity 
6:282-283), is sul'cessful in summarizing an extraordi­narily complex set of ceramic descriptions and classifi­cations from Honduras, a region in which investigations have produced an avalanche of disparate typologies. Like Baudez, we wish that it had been fea­sible to include more illustrative material. We are also delighted that he recognizes the importance of Joyce's key for classifying Ulua polychromes. At the same time, we believe that readers interested in learning what
