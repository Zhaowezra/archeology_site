DIMENSIONING AT THE EPICLASSIC SITE OF CACAXTLA, 
TLAXCALA, MEXICO: AN EXPRESSION OF PAN-MESOAMERICAN 
COMPLEX THINKING 

Genevieve Lucet 
This article discusses the measurement system used at Cacaxtla, Tlaxcala, Mexico. It addresses the ideological concepts this system may have expressed, its relationship to other systems used in Mesoamerica, and its implications for evaluating the hypothesis of a Maya presence at Cacaxtla during the Epiclassic. Measurements used at Cacaxtla combine the practical needs of builders with symbolic expression reflected in architecture. Two moduli served as the basis for the dimensioning: the unit of .488 m and its triple, 1.465 m. This measurement was in turn multiplied by 3, 4, 9, and 12 to obtain the lengths of the main spaces, which served as the basis for the dimensioning system used during different 
phases of construction. Jn specific places, three anthropometric measures were used. Additionally, the spatial distribution of pillars according to their sizes confirms the coexistence of two zones within the site that express a duality also present in mural paintings. The moduli and units used at Cacaxtla agree to a considerable degree with those identified for the Maya area and, in some cases, with Teotihuacan and the Nahua culture. I hypothesize that this system was shared by several Mesoamerican cultures and lasted 
from the Classic to the Postclassic periods.

he dimensioning of architectural compo­are innate to humans independently of their cul­Tnents involves two related elements: the tural origins (Morley 2010; Morley and Renfrew use of a system of measurement with pat­2010; Urton 201 0). Nevertheless, being based on terns or units and the logic followed by the units that vary from one person to another, such builders for laying out walls, porticos, and patios references generate inaccurate systems -hence that define buildings and open spaces.

and its multiples-ensures the accuracy indis­pensable for all building projects (Lee 1996). 
Units for measuring distances may differ de­pending on the object measured. A measurement system may also be defined on the basis of a com­bination of different units of different sizes with or without an arithmetic relationship between them. Likewise, when analyzing ancient buildings to identify the dimensioning units used, a degree of uncertainty and inaccuracy must be taken into account. Several elements come into play that add variations between the ideal initial measurements and those recorded in the present. These may in­clude: ( 1) approximations made during construc­tion when an anthropometric measure based on parts of the body was used; (2) lack of precision during the building process (a tolerance of a few centimeters is generally expected, and even more so in preindustrial societies); (3) subsidence and building deterioration caused by natural processes or human activities. Furthermore, (4) current mea­surements, even when taken with laser systems, add one final source of possible error. 
The first of these factors is built into the system and will be multiplied proportionally in relation to the overall dimensions involved. If the modulus used is small, the multiplying effect upon repeti­tion is greater than if a larger modulus is involved. Hence, the larger the modulus identified, the lesser the margin of error. The remaining factors (2-4) are related to the measurement taken as a whole and represent an absolute error that in most cases does not exceed a couple of centimeters. 
The manner of counting also exerts an influ­ence on measurements. In a decimal system, mul­tiples of IO or 5 are preferred, whereas Mesoamer­ican systems were vigesimal. Divisions become unwieldy when having to handle non-integer re­sults, which are not intuitive; in contrast, this prob­lem disappears if a tool such as a string is used instead of numerical values: to divide one only has to fold the string onto itself, so that the mea­surement becomes "a string folded into x equal parts." 
Among Mesoamerican cultures, numbers also may be considered a symbolic representation re­lated to worldview. The meanings of the symbolic essence of constructions would be expressed through the use of specific numbers (Clark 2008, 2010; Sugiyama 1983, 1993, 2010). 
Cacaxtla 

Cacaxtla is located at a distance of 100 km from Teotihuacan, and some of its substructures indicate the influence of the metropolis. Nonetheless, its period of splendor was around A.D. 700-800 and the settlement was abandoned during the tenth century (Garcia 1978; Garcia et al. 1995; Molina 1977). The site belongs to the Epiclassic, a period characterized by complex political, social, eco­nomic, and cultural movements resulting from the abandonment of Teotihuacan, the great city of the Classic period. Far from the altiplano, Maya cities survived several centuries more before disappear­ing toward the end of the millennium. Cacaxtla is distinguished by its extensive murals that cover several walls, a long batter or talud, a bench, and two pillars inside a room. 
The mural paintings were carefully protected when the inhabitants decided to carry out archi­tectural modifications resulting in their burial (Brittenham 2009). They have been an invaluable source of information for studying the history of the site. Extensive debates have arisen regarding their unmistakable similarities-but also consid­erable differences-with the mural paintings of the lowland Maya during the same era. Some au­thors think that the artists came from the Maya area (Graulich 1988; Mc Vicker 1985), while oth­ers (Brittenham 2009, 2011) believe they were from the altiplano and would have learned their trade in the Maya area and hence developed skills that enabled them to set forth a local discourse using Maya styles and techniques. Most scholars recognize that the rulers who commissioned the work were from the central highlands of Mexico; a more marginal hypothesis is that a Maya group could have conquered Cacaxtla and established a Teotihuacan-Maya shared government (Graulich 1988, 2001). 
If the rulers were local people, their interest in using a Maya style of painting has been interpreted as a public declaration of affiliation with the dom­inant culture of the period and as a way of casting a veil over their previous affiliation with the cul­ture of Teotihuacan through the use of an eclectic style of art (Kubler 1978; Nagao 1989). In any case, the absence of Mayan writing would be ex­plained by the position of the site in a zone in­habited by speakers of a non-Mayan language

(Walling 1982). According to the latter studies, 
available evidence indicates a mixture of cultural 
expressions. The most visible elements are not 
systematic indicators of an origin: some could 
have been copied, sometimes with a deep knowl­
edge of their meaning and at other times by being 
reinterpreted with varying degrees of syncretism. 
New codes of expression may be adopted for a variety reasons. Pictorial representations, with their high degree of visibility and various expressive components-such as style, icons, and forms of writing-are ideal means of conveying a message and so new elements may be imported for political purposes. On the other hand, the use of a system of measurement in building is anchored to a complex and traditional practice that includes planning, de­sign, geometry, and calculation. It is a type of knowledge that is transmitted via practice and man­ifests ancestral cultural heritage. It is part of the way of thinking of the builders, and it may well prove extremely complicated for them to adapt to new systems of measurement.1 A system of mea­surement in architecture is a cultural good that may be regarded as a parameter of identification. 
Different systems of measurement have been reported for Teotihuacan and the Maya area. If comparable systems could be attested for other sites, this would offer proof of the existence of cultural connections. At Cacaxtla, such informa­tion would provide new parameters for under­standing the complex system of relationships in the Mesoamerican Epiclassic, in particular regard­ing Maya presence in the central highlands after the fall of Teotihuacan. 
Methods 
Architectural composition and style, the arrange­ment of buildings, and the dimensions of the site are elements that support the hypothesis that a particular measurement system was used for build­ing Cacaxtla. The monumental core of the site is characterized by the presence of many porticos surrounding plazas and on the edge of the plat­form. This is evidence for the builders having sought a regular pattern by using a constant in measurements to establish recurring rhythms (Fig­ure l). In the same way, the regularity of the build­ings and the proportions of inner and outer space indicate that these buildings were thought out and 
planned before construction. In addition, most 
structures conserve their original lime plaster fin­
ish, which facilitates taking measurements re­
quired in order to know their original dimensions. 
A question of methodology that had to be con­sidered at the outset was to determine whether one should start by seeking to apply a known sys­tem of Mesoamerican measurement or by working empirically on the basis of the measurements found. I opted for the latter approach so as not to bias results with preconceived ideas and not to rule out the possibility for the existence of a sys­tem that was peculiar to Cacaxtla. 
Initial analyses involved applying statistical calculations to all measurements, but this method was not useful because it ignored the fact that de­grees of variation between the original design and what is currently measured are not invariable for all categories of architectural elements. In addi­tion, it was necessary to take into account several other variables in measuring the buildings ­whether, for instance, the layers of finishing ma­terials applied on the core of the structural ele­ments were taken into account, or just the distances between structural elements. The solu­tion for the analysis of data was to group mea­surements by building type. The first category chosen for study was one of the most easily con­trolled. Moreover, it was a category in which the builders might conceivably have been most inter­ested in the careful application of dimensions­namely, the measurements of porticos, the pillars forming them, and the spaces separating them. The measurements taken were analyzed and com­pared arithmetically in search of repeating moduli; once such units were identified and verified, they were applied to the remaining building types. The measurements were weighted according to their role in the logic of construction and the importance of the object or the space where they were taken. 
Prehispanic Dimensioning Systems 
There are several sources available for the study of measurement systems. Sixteenth-century texts can serve as a basis for understanding the Nahua measurement system. The main source is found in the archaeological sites themselves; however, some studies have added anthropological and eth­nohistorical data.

The Nahua measurement system has been ex­tensively studied by Victor Castillo (1972) and Marcos Matias Alonso (1984) using information found in the narratives of missionaries and their indigenous pupils. The system was built upon multiple anthropometric measures. Understanding its operation and establishing its metric equiva­lencies is a complex undertaking because there are contradictions among the sources. At times, it is difficult to tell when the authors refer to Pre­hispanic or to Spanish units, since some measures-such as the arm-span, the rod, or the foot-occur in both cultures. 
Conversions to the metric system may vary greatly (Table 1). For instance, according to Bar­bara Williams and Maria del Carmen Jorge y Jorge (2008) the "bone" measured .5 m, whereas for Dehouve (2011) it has a length that varied between .23 and .334 m. Dehouve relates several measures to the palm and comments that the yollotli (rod), measuring approximately .83 m, seems to have been a modular base. In the measurements for the Tlaltecuhtli stone, Lopez Lujan reports that the sculpture measures 4.17 m x 3.62 m, i.e., 5 yollotli or 15.01 tlaxcitamachihualoni (measuring one third of a yollotli) by 4 yollotli plus 1.03 tlaxcita­machihualoni or 13.03 tlaxcitamachihualoni (Lopez 2010). 
There were also instruments such as the octd­catl, a measuring rod; the cemmecatl, a length of twine or string made from braided fiber; and the tlalmecatl, a string for ground measurements (Castillo 1972). Francisco Guerra (1960) mentions a stick called tlacaxilantli that would have corre­sponded to the distance between the human navel and the floor and that would have been divided into halves and fifths to obtain smaller measures. More than references to a precise measure, these standards were instruments used in various ways depending on the object being measured. The use of twine has continued until the present time, as shown by research carried out in the Maya area (Powell 2010). 
Exact measurement, recording, and quantifica­tion were of concern to the Aztecs, as shown in documents such as the Codex Vergara and the Santa Maria Asuncion Codex, dated to around AD. 1539­1543, where information on plots of land is ac­companied by ground features and a census of the families and owners in the Texcoco zone of the Valley of Mexico. These documents have served as a source for understanding how the Aztecs com­puted the surface of plots of land with remarkable accuracy (Jorge et al. 2011; Williams and Jorge y Jorge 2008; Williams and Harvey 1988). 
Bruce Drewitt ( 1987) finds a measurement sys­tem with a modulus of .805 m as the basis of the urban layout at Teotihuacan, according to infor­mation obtained from the survey of the city (Mil­lon 1973; Millon et al. 1973). He also shows the use of multiples of this unit in correspondence with the calendar system. Saburo Sugiyama (1983, 1993, 2010) extends that study and proposes a measurement unit based on a modulus of .83 m that is equal to the N ahua yollotli and the Spanish vara. In addition, he shows that the units used for the layouts of the great pyramids and complexes correspond to calendric quantities, so that the ur­ban space is related to cycles of the Sun, Venus, and the Moon, as well as the 260-day ritual cal-

endar. This is evidence for precise, large-scale planning of the city with a complex vision of space-time relationships. Following the same line of work, a value close to this modulus and a world­view representation with the use of significant numbers from a symbolic point of view have been sought in the architecture of Teotihuacan (Hasel­bach 2003). 
In the Maya zone, Patricia O'Brien and Hanne Christiansen (1986) have studied ten Puuc-style structures at the sites of Chichen Itza, Uxmal, and Kabah, dated to AD. 750-1 000. Following careful measurement and rigorous mathematical study, they identify a double measurement system and validate it with ethnohistorical data. They name the principal unit of 1.47 m the zapal, divided into 16 kab of 9 x6ot each or 9 oc of 16 x6ot each. Thus, there were 144 x6ot in each zapal, and a x6ot is almost exactly equivalent to 1 cm. Using ethnohistorical data, the authors identify a system of length measurements related to the foot, the hand, and other body measurements, so that 9 x6ot could be one hand, 16 a foot (without the toes), and 1.47 m the distance along outstretched arms. In addition, ancient Mayan texts refer to several numbers used in measurements: 3, 4, 9, and 12 appear in the Chilam Balam ofChumayel, 4 in the Popol Vuh, while 9 was a sacred number related to the training of artisans according to Landa's Relacion de las cosas de Yucatan. 
A modulus of 70 cm (Royall 2010) is reported from Paquime, a site outside Mesoamerica in the north of Mexico. 
Layout and Geometry 
The dimensions of buildings are in most cases the result of the method and instruments used to lay them out. Thus, the use of a string as a ground layout tool may lead to solutions that do not al­ways correspond to the base units of measurement. For traditional dwellings, present-day Maya peo­ple start their layout with a generally square base, and the string is folded in two to draw the circular ends (Powell 201 0). There are variants to this sys­tem, which result from moving the center of the arc being traced, thus varying the final proportions of the building. While the initial form may have been based on measurements and geometry, the final result is the consequence of tracing a layout and no longer adheres to measurements. 
Geometry has served as the basis for the com­position of paintings, bas-relief, or architecture (Chanfon 1979; Clancy 1994; Harrison 1994; Vinette 1986). The square was a recurring form and expressed the conception of the universe with four points oriented along the cardinal directions, in addition to the vertical axis that unites the var­ious levels of the universe (Lopez and Lopez 2001). This spatial perception was part of the con­ceptual scheme that became generalized in the Mesoamerican world, especially for ritual spaces. Thus, the plazas and principal interior spaces of Cacaxtla have the proportions of a square or a double square (Lucet 1999, 2013). In architectural composition, the geometric properties of figures served to arrange buildings in a hierarchy, taking advantage of axes of symmetry and reflecting a complex, conscious handling of the spatial quali­ties of shapes. 
In spite of its close connection to architectural dimensioning, the manner of applying measure­ments on the ground has been little studied. Ques­tions remain regarding the elements considered and the order followed in measuring out structures and plazas, whether measurements were taken from the inside or outside of a building, or whether the rhythm of a fa9ade was paramount and took precedence over the dimensions of the rooms. Data recorded by Sugiyama (1993, 2010) at Teoti­huacan correspond to the edges of large structures and to the axis of symmetry of the Avenue of the Dead. O'Brien and Christiansen (1 986) measure the exteriors and interiors of buildings without distinction, as well as doorways and fa9ade stones. According to Powell (2010), a layout is effected to define the inside or outside, and additional con­trols ensure that diagonals have equal lengths. 
Data Selection and Collection 
The assignment of architectural measurements follows a process in which the main elements take precedence over secondary elements, which must conform to relative or residual measurements of the former. What are the elements that are likely to provide useful information on the system of measurements used at Cacaxtla? 
The importance of each building or room within the complex is one criterion. For instance,

LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 26, No. 2, 2015 
a space used for religious functions transcends the status of an ordinary building. It is the habitat of a deity or the place for rituals, and it is very likely that this will be reflected in its location, di­mensions, and geometry, exhibiting the builders' ideal of perfection. In this hierarchical order, the elements surrounding a main plaza-namely, the building's fac;ades-may have received special attention in following aesthetic standards. 
Builders would have given special attention to the width of building, as this is limited by the re­sistance of the materials that support the roof. They knew, at least empirically, that the length that should not be exceeded for specific beam section. For the same reason, the measurements of lintels above openings are controlled. 
Measurements collected at Cacaxtla were clas­sified into simple architectural categories: the height of pillars, the space between them, the space between central pillars when different from the lateral spaces, the width of doorways, the in­terior length and width of rooms, the measure­ments of open spaces, and those of staircases, in­cluding their balustrades. With the exception of Building B, structures at Cacaxtla are not isolated and do not have a well-defined exterior dimen­sion. 
In the case of long bays that were subdivided into rooms, only the initial lengths of the spaces were included in order not to artificially multiply a measurement that actually corresponds to a sin­gle structure. Where dimensions of all four sides of a room were available, those corresponding to opposite sides were kept without averaging in or­der to deal directly with the initial measurement and not a mathematically derived quantity. 
Finally, the structural transformations of the site during the centuries it was inhabited were taken into account (Lucet 1999, 2007, 2013). Mesoamerican cultures tended to renew their buildings regularly so that dimensions or place­ments of spaces may have depended on the exis­tence of previous walls or buildings. 
When the system of construction involves su­perimposing several material layers, it is pertinent to ask whether the measurement should include the entire resulting thickness or only the structural core. At Cacaxtla, the system consisted of erecting a structural core with tepetate stone and earth, ap­plying a layer of earth, sand, and lime to a thick­ness of between 5 and 8 cm, and covering it with lime mortar 1 to 2 cm thick and a fine layer of white plaster (Magaloni et al. 201 3). This tech­nique results in a significant difference between measurements taken before and after the applica­tion of covering layers and is a variable that needs to be considered. 
In order to achieve representative data of the original measurements, only references to com­ponents with original finishes in good condition, presenting few deformations, were considered. Structures were measured from points on the wall surfaces because in most cases the comer arrises were damaged or severely rounded. Measurement points were chosen close to the floor to avoid ver­tical deformation in the structures. For each dis­tance, care was taken to record the data from the same position of the total station to prevent an in­crease in measurement errors due to translation of the coordinate system. A laser scanner was used for Building B. To define the constructive modulus of Cacaxtla, the data originate exclusively from the laser record and, to corroborate the modulus found, some distances measured with a tape mea­sure were included. 
Data Analysis 
Recurrent Measurements in Pillars and Spaces between Pillars 
The width measurements of pillars (P) were found to cluster into two ranges (Table 2): (1) 1.175­


1.226 m (µ 1.199 m; <T = .014 m; 30 pillars in 
= 
11 porticos) and (2) 1.437-1 .505 m (µ = 1.467 m; <T= .016 m; 28 pillars in 10 porticos). The dis­tances between pillars (I) clustered into three ranges. The first two roughly correspond to the ranges of P identified above: (1) 1.171-1.21 1 m (9 spaces from 5 porticos) and (2) 1.431 -1.494 m (12 spaces from 5 porticos). The largest number of I values, however, cluster in the range 1.895­
2.02 m (µ = 1.953 m; <T = .03; 35 spaces from 10 porticos). 
These ranges of P and I were taken together to compute their representative means. The values obtained-1.198 m, 1.465 m, and 1.953 m­represent 44 percent, 40 percent and 0 percent of P measurements, and 20 percent, 20 percent, and 40 percent of I measurements, respectively. In the
