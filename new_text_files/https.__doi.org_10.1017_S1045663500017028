Correction: In the December issue, there was an error on page 41 l, Figure 12 (The Southeastern Inka Frontier against the Chiriguanos: Structure and Dynamics of the Inka Imperial Borderlands, by Sonia Alconini). Within the figure, the text "Based on Lee 1992 and Piirssinen and Siiriiininen 1993" should have read "Based on Lee 
1992 and Piirssinen and Siiriiiinen 1998."
