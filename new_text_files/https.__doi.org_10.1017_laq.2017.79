Thisvolume focusesexclusively on thePuuc region, which rarely gets this kind of attention in academic literature. It contains 11 chapters, 3 of which are in Spanish. The .rst seven chapters have an archaeolog­ical focus, and the last four discuss art and writing. Written for an expert audience, this book provides a much-needed update from an array of projects at various research stages across the states of Yucatán andCampeche. 
Michael Smyth and colleagues discuss the site of Xcoch, whose architectural center clusters around water resources, highlighting the signi.cance that water management played during the Preclassic and Classicperiods.Using settlement pattern studies,sed­imentcores,speleothemanalysis, anddatingmethods, they argue that the site experienced multiple popula­tiondeclines despitetheconstructionand modi.cation of various water catchment features in the face of intense and recurring droughts. Meanwhile, at nearby Uxmal, where they engaged in more intense water management,the populationthrived foracentury after Xcoch’s decline. 
Ken Seligson and colleagues examine lime pow­der(Spanish cal) production, which has been hard to identify in the archaeological record due to the dif.cultyof identifying kiln structures.The discovery of seven possiblekilnsatKiuic provides insight into cal manufacture, the resources needed to create it, andwhatroleitplayedinthe ancientPuuc economy. Forexample,powerfulfamilies likelycontrolledlarger kilnslocated within elite residentialcompounds,while non-elitesmayhave used smallercommunalkilns.

Thus,the façadebecame ceremonial trashusedina termination ritual that symbolizedatransitional political period. 
Luis Raúl Pantoja Díaz investigates the site of Kabah, one of the largest centers, nestled within the highest elevations of the Yucatán. Despite early attentionbyJohn LloydStephens andminor projects in the 1920s, ’50s, and ’80s, INAH did not initiate a major project there until 1990. Like other sites in the region, Kabah is comprised of dispersed settle­ment on the highest points of terrain, strategically surrounded by water sources such as aguadas and chultunes, quarries for sascab, and rich agricultural lands. Kabah’s positioning of large elite structures on high terrain made this architecture very public, while also restricting accesstoritual space. 
Gustavo Novelo Rincón discusses the restoration work done on theCodz PopbuildingofKabah,which served as theresidence forthe rulingfamily duringthe Terminal Classicperiod. Theproject hasfocused on conserving oneof thebestexamplesof an elaborate Puuc façade, while also attempting to understand thebuilding’siconography,associated materials, and placementwithinthe site.Although theresearchisin progress, theyhave been able to detect sevendistinct construction phases, the presence of ritual activities in theinterior of thebuilding, andevidencethatthe elaborate façades were altered as political powers changed. 
Lourdes Toscano Hernández and José Huchim Herreraexaminethe abandonmentof domestic items in what they call “Architecture ofPower” across the Puuc region during the Terminal Classic period. In buildings onceoccupiedby rulingfamilies, theyhave detected a pattern of trash heaps, including animal bones, brokenbuildingornaments,broken ceramics, lithics, and ash intentionally placed along destroyed stairways. The rituals appear similar at distinct sites and were likely done to show reverence to a space before or afterbeing occupied.

MeghanRubensteinandPhilipp Galeevrevealnew interpretationsof thehieroglyphicplatformatKabah, a low, four-sided structure covered with a carved inscription. In an attempt to overcome the issues of worn panels and missing blocks, the authors created a catalogue, compiling photographs and drawings fromthe nineteenth andtwentieth centuries combined with detailed documentation conductedin 2013. The resultingworkallowsfor newinterpretations,includ­ing the presence of calendrical dates and glyphs that suggest royal accession and military activity. Although these characteristics are shared with other Puuc inscriptions, they also detected three separate writing styles, which may suggest an evolving struc­ture that was enlarged over time.

is botha surprise anda delight.Fromthe main title, I mistakenly believed this to be a standard edited volume on a current “hot topic,” presenting a series of loosely related articles. When I then noted the subtitle, I assumed this hefty topic was the focus of research at a single archaeological site, dealing primarily with activities of Maya elites within the monumental core.Thevolumeisfar morecomplex. Although focusedprimarily on the northernlowland siteof Chunchucmil, its reach encompassesthe entire ChunchucmilEconomicRegion(CER) andbeyond, considering multiple socioeconomic strata of ancient urban and hinterland communities. 
The goal of the volume is to explore the role of commerce—de.nedinthe bookas marketexchange, as opposed to reciprocity and redistribution—in the development and maintenance of Early Classic life­waysat Chunchucmilandin theMayaworldin gen-eral;thatistosay,itstrivestoprovideanunderstanding of how households supported themselves in what is generally characterized as an agriculturally barren region of theYucatan Peninsula. In essence, it sum­marizes thedecades-longPakbehRegionalEconomy Program initiatedbyBruceH. Dahlinandcolleagues in the 1990s,and also successfully incorporates results of earlier and ongoing research in the region. What differentiatesthisexamination fromsimilar endeavors is a focus on a broad variety of actors involved in commerce, as regards geographic distribution (the urban center and beyond), socioeconomic status, and gender. Although muchofthe data andinterpretations have been previously presented elsewhere, all of the related streams of inquiry are brought together in a combinedand updatedformat. Thevolumeis touted asa multidisciplinary pursuit, anditdoessuccessfully incorporate scholarship from archaeology, ethnogra­phy, ethnohistory, history of commerce and industry, andenvironmental sciences (geomorphology,biology, hydrology). The contributing authors are all well-regarded in their respective .elds.
