For decades, individual scholars working on the precontact Americas have been analyzing clothing, hairstyles, bodily adornment, and accoutrements for clues to personal and group identity. It is only recently, however, that some have started coming together in major institutional settings to address the problem collectively. The 2017 volume Dressing the Part: Power, Dress, Gender, and Representation in the Pre-Columbian Americas grew out of a session of similar name held at the 2012 annual meeting of the Society for American Archaeology. It is ironic, however, that although most of the articles in the volume re.ect a ready willingness to draw from a variety of disciplines, including archaeology, the session organizers and editors, as well as all but two of the other contributing authors, are art historians. Moreover, the majority of those art historians are iconographers—that is, they carefully examine complex visual forms and images in search of their original meanings. 
Dressing the Part focuses on what depictions of dress and accoutrements tell us about gender across the Americas. The 11 chapters that follow the short introduction are arranged geographically, from North America to Mesoamerica, then to Central America, and from there, to the Andes. As the volume’s title indicates, all of the chapters deal with precolumbian art forms, but what it does not tell us is that all of the cultures discussed either were early, predating the arrival of Europeans by at least several centuries, or are relatively poorly known due to minimal archaeological work and sparse ethnohistorical documentation—or both. The authors have therefore tackled some of the most recalcitrant types of artworks in the Americas. 
Representing the only case of an overlap of spatial and temporal focus, two chapters deal with the Classic Maya. Both Matthew Looper and Karon Winzenz had an advantage over the other contributors, given that Mayanists can now at least partially read most Classic-period Maya hieroglyphic inscriptions. Like many Mayanists, Looper and Winzenz tend to speak primar­ily to other Mayanists, at times neglecting to de.ne coded terms and explain complex concepts for readers who work on other times and places. Nonetheless, they each make an important contribution. Looper, supported by .ve pages of tabulations, shows that although the earliest known so-called netted garment appears at Early Classic Teotihuacan on a female, both men and women, whether human or divine, appear in netted garments in Late Classic Maya art. Winzenz, in contrast, shows that the so-called Quadripartite Badge, mostly seen with males in Early Classic Maya imagery, later appears largely with females in the context of issues such as birth and procreation. Cherra Wyllie, in her chapter on gender in the Classic-period Las Higueras murals in Veracruz, similarly suggests that elite women increasingly played important roles in local religious ceremonies and politics, eventually coming, as she points out, to “[dominate] the narrative” (175). 
Laura Wing.eld’s chapter, albeit highly specula­tive and somewhat confusing in places, aligns with Looper’s in arguing that precontact Costa Rican sculp­ture shifted emphasis over time from female to male. Costa Rica’s famous greenstone axes, which appear to be ambiguous with regard to gender and were most likely made for women, ultimately gave way to the use of metal images to reinforce male dominance. Wing.eld’s chapter would have bene.ted, however, from a clear statement of her methodology like that provided by Ann Peters and Elsa Tomasto-Cagigao in their careful, highly descriptive analysis of the layers of textiles wrapped around the Paracas Necropolis funerary bundles in Peru. Supported by two multipage tables, Peters and Tomasto-Cagigao document the diversity of the textile patterns in the bundles and identify their relevance to the sex of the individual they covered. The authors further show that gendered garments and designs sometimes appear on the bundle of a person of the opposite sex, and that some bundles defy a single gender identity. Although male burials predominate, those of females indicate that at least some women played important social and religious roles. 
Evidence of female power in Native North Amer­ican artworks is also underscored by Alice Kehoe, the only contributor to the volume to focus on a surviving art form—that of twining as represented by Great Lakes Osage twined bags. Concentrating on two motifs, the Panther and the Thunderbird, Kehoe notes that the wealthy and highly respected women who created the bags did not “dress up” as we might expect; rather, they wore minimal clothing to signal their power. “Abnegation of dress,” as Kehoe puts it, can and often does re.ect high status. Kehoe also points out that earlier, male ethnographers seldom inquired into the art of twining, a glaring example of the all­too-frequent gender biases of some investigators.

Buford makes a related point. In a lengthy and devas­tating critique of the scholarship on the subject, they home in on the inaccuracies of previous drawings and resulting misinterpretations of what used to be called the “birdman” motif on the Mississippian Eastern Woodlands Rogan plates. Four pages of tabulated data show exactly who has said what regarding the sex and gender of what is now better referred to as the “bird­human” because, as the authors convincingly argue, drawing on earlier works by Catherine Brown and several others, at least some of the winged .gures featured on the plates are actually female. 
Follensbee, in another strong chapter, applies simi­larly careful observation to human .gures in Preclassic Olmec art. From her analysis she concludes not only that typically male clothing could be appropriated by women and vice versa, but that some Olmec garments were clearly “gender neutral.” Nonetheless, in the end it was lineage rather than sex or gender that determined which garments an Olmec elite chose to wear to re.ect his or her power. This contrasts with Sarahh Scher’s study of the dress of the so-called High Priestess in Moche art, which shows that the Priestess often appears wearing male ornaments, whereas Moche men are never depicted in female dress. Power among the Moche people seems to have been exclusively expressed via male attributes. Kim Richter, on the other hand, demonstrates that many Huastec sculptures long thought to be male actually represent powerful women whose elaborate headdresses relate them to an international ideology and network. Richter also notes two sculptures of ambiguous gender. Clearly, evidence is mounting that precontact cultures had diverse and multiple under­standings of gender and gender roles. 
The only essay in the volume to deal with West Mexico is Melissa Logan’s study of Late Formative capes seen on .gural ceramics from the region. Although Logan’s analysis is impressively thorough, including six tables (four of which appear as an appendix), she cannot draw many conclusions beyond showing that capes were worn by both men and women of elite status and mature age. Logan’s chapter therefore highlights the dif.culty we face in under­standing the relation of dress to gender in early and/or largely undocumented societies. As a result, some readers may .nd much of Dressing the Part rather dry, descriptive, and even arcane in places, and others may complain that some of the authors indulge in a little too much “cloud reading.” Nonetheless, the volume overall proves that painstaking looking, combined with careful comparison and contrasting of art forms— the “grunt work” that iconographers, who are all too often denigrated for their trouble, contribute to our common knowledge—can indeed shed light on the interrelationships of gender, power, and change in undocumented and previously misunderstood pasts. And that is good news for all of us.

The essays in this volume are prime examples of a novel direction in colonial Latin American his­tory, archaeology, and art history: a broad rethinking of convergences and multidirectional links between classical antiquity and indigenous cultures of the Americas. These essays, based on papers presented at a symposium held at the J. Paul Getty Museum, feature an exemplary and thoughtful dialogue among spe­cialists in history, archaeology and classical studies, and art history. Common strands regarding imperial dominance and its representations are .rst laid out in an introduction by John M. D. Pohl and Claire 
L. Lyons, while an initial chapter by Walter Scheidel reviews methodological issues about the comparative analysis of empires. 
Two chapters address imperial iconographies. Eulogio Guzmán scrutinizes “the image” of Mexico­Tenochtitlan’s Templo Mayor, which anchored col­lective memories about the consolidation of Mexica might; ingeniously, he compares Mexica objects and architecture to the iconography of the sovereign in Hobbes’s Leviathan. Jonathan Edmonson chronicles the imperial architecture of the mighty Augusta Emerita (Mérida). After citing Mérida’s memorializa­tion by Antonio de Nebrija (as lofty ruins) and by Francisco de Montejo the Younger (who bestowed its name on colonial Yucatan’s administrative cen­ter), Edmonson explores how the victorious Romans erected this city to memorialize their victory over Asturian and Cantabrian forces. 
Although interspersed, chapters 4, 5, 8, and 9 carry out a lively art historical dialogue. Emily Umberger deftly reviews Mexica monuments that represent imperial might. Moving swiftly between well-known sculptures, such as the Teocalli of Sacred Warfare and the Tizoc stone, and other works in subject Nahua polities, Umberger locates a narrative of environmen­tal disaster and renewal in the iconographic record, beginning with the disastrous .ooding of the Mexica capital in 1499, and ending with renewed fertility at the
