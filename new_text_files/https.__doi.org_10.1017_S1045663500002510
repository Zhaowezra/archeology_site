STRONTIUM ISOTOPE EV IDENCE FOR PREHISTORIC MIGRATION 
AT CHOKEPUKIO, VALL EY OF CUZCO, PERU 
Valerie A. Andrushko, Michele R. Buzon, Antonio Simonetti, and Robert A. Creaser 
Although Spanish chroniclers referred frequently to coerced migration in the Inca Empire, these migrations have been dif­

ficult to document archaeologically. One approach to migration studies, strontium isotope (87Srfl6Sr) analysis, has emerged as an effective technique. Until now, however, this method has not been applied to the Inca heartland region of Cuzco, Peru. In this study, we use strontium isotope analysis to examine patterns of prehistoric migration in the Cuzco Valley. Human dental enamel samples from the Cuzco Valley site of Chokepukio are analyzed and compared to the local 87Srfl6Sr signa­ture established through fauna[ specimens. Though tentative due to a small sample size, the isotope results do not provide evidence for migration at this site from the time periods preceding the rise of the Inca Empire (200 B.C. to A.D. I400). In contrast, there is substantial evidence for migration during the time of Inca imperialism (A.D. I400-l 532). Among these migrants, variation in 87Sr/86Sr values suggests that individuals emigratedfrom geologically diverse locations, while sex differences in the migrant group include a higher percentage of females and a greater diversity in female 87Srfl6Sr values. These data, along with ethnohistoric evidence, reveal how Inca labor policies reconfigured the composition of populations in the imperial heartland.

bounded material categories, may not reflect the fluid and dynamic boundaries of ethnic groups (Emberling 1997; Jones and Graves-Brown 1996; Stanish 2003:222). Consequently, the archaeolog­ical identification of migration has remained a chal­lenge. 
One alternative approach, strontium isotope (87Sr/86Sr) analysis, has emerged as an important method to investigate migration (e.g., Ericson 1985; Montgomery et al. 2000; Montgomery et al. 2005; Price et al. 1994; Price et al. 2000; Price et al. 2002; Price et al. 2004; Price et al. 2006; Sealy et al. 1991). Strontium studies involve the analy­sis of teeth and/or bone to identify variations in 87Sr/86Sr values, which differ based on local geol­ogy (specifically, the age and composition of local rocks).1 By comparing human isotope values to a region's local biogeochemical signature, strontium analysis can be used to identify migrants living in a new locale. This technique has been successfully applied in the Andes at sites in northern Chile, Bolivia, and Peru (Knudson 2004; Knudson and Price 2007; Knudson et al. 2004; Knudson et al. 2005; Tung 2003). 
However, the Cuzco region of Peru has not been investigated for strontium data until now. Cuzco-­the capital of the Inca Empire-hosted a variety of migrant groups, according to colonial documents (Betanzos 1996 [ 1557]; Cieza de Leon 1985 [1553]; Cobo 1979 [1653]; Garcilaso de la Vega 1986 [ 1609]; Helmer 1955-1956:40). Yet no iso­topic analyses have been completed to verify these accounts or to document how these migrations restructured the composition of Cuzco populations. The present study was therefore developed with three goals: obtain preliminary local strontium val­ues using fauna! teeth, analyze human dental enamel to identify prehistoric migrations into the Cuzco Valley, and explore resulting social and polit­ical implications. The site chosen for study, Chokepukio, was occupied from the Early Inter­mediate period through the Late Horizon (200 B.C.-A.D. 1532), providing the opportunity to doc­ument migration before and after the rise of the Inca Empire. 
The resulting data offer a diachronic view of migration into the Cuzco Valley. The results sug­gest that migrants were not present among indi­viduals sampled from the time periods preceding the Inca Empire (200 B.C.-A.D. 1400). In con­trast, there is clear evidence for migration duriDI

Identifying Past Migration in the Andes 
Migration in the Andes 
Migration has long played a key role in shaping the Andean social landscape. At times, highland Andean groups have exploited ecological niches at different altitudes, maintaining a base population in one location and sending off smaller groups to exploit other "vertical islands" (Murra 1968, 1972, 1985). While maize agriculture is most successful at lower elevations, higher elevations are better suited for potatoes. The highest grassland regions (puna), where plant cultivation is ill-suited, are pri­marily used for herding. By moving among eco­zones, Andean groups, both past and present, have maximized their resource options and developed a system of reciprocal exchange (Brush 1976, 1977; Guillet 198 l ; Masuda et al. 1985). 
One well-documented example of resource­based migration is found in the Middle Horizon state of Tiwanaku (A.D. 500-1000), where colonists migrated to the Moquegua Valley, Peru, from the capital near the Bolivian shore of Lake Titicaca (Blom et al. 1998; Goldstein 1993, 2000; Knudson et al. 2004; Kolata 1993; Owen 2005). Described as "diaspora communities" (Goldstein 2000), the colonists remained both biologically and culturally affiliated with the Tiwanaku core (Blom 1999; Blom et al. 1998; Goldstein 1989a, 1989b, 2005:266; Owen 2005:64; Stanish 2003:291). In Moquegua they cultivated and exported resources-such as maize, cotton, peppers, and coca-that were either unavailable or limited in the capital region (Goldstein 2005:237). 
In the Late Horizon (A.D. 1476-1532), the Inca adopted this pattern of ecological migration as a tool of state control (Goldstein 2005:48; Wachtel 1982:200). This tactic proved invaluable for impe­rial success: as Stanish notes, "Forcible movement of populations for strategic and economic purposes is perhaps the most intrusive, nonlethal means of

control for a premodern empire" (2001:224). In one example of coerced migration, detailed in colo­nial documents, the Inca established mitima colonies in the fertile valleys of Cochabamba, Bolivia (Wachtel 1982). To exploit this agricultural opportunity, the Inca removed local ethnic groups and shifted all arable land to the state. Foreign groups were resettled to work the fields and build administrative centers., roads, and storehouses to support production (Gyarmati and Varga 1999). An estimated 14,000 individuals-originating as far away as Chile-worked the state fields in Cochabamba (Wachtel 1982:214). 
Identifying Migrations 
Despite the recognized importance of migration in the ancient Andes and elsewhere, its identification presents challenges (Burmeister 2000:540; Snow 1995 :72). In the absence of written records, archae­ologists often rely on stylistic differences in mate­rial culture to distinguish groups, based on the premise that groups retain unique symbols of their ethnic unity (Blom 2005:2). However, many vari­ables complicate the differentiation of ethnic groups based on material culture (Jones 1997; Smith and Schreiber 2005:208). Ceramic style has been used to distinguish Andean ethnic groups, yet we know that differences in style may relate to regional, tem­poral, or status-based differences (Conkey and Has­torf 1990; Odess 1998; Plog 1983; Shennan 1994: 13 ). In addition, critical symbols of ethnic identity such as apparel may be absent from the archaeological record; for example, only in rare circumstances do archaeologists recover the dis­tinctive hats worn by various ethnic groups in pre­historic Andean times (Cock 2002). 
Further complicating the matter, ethnic identity is not static but, rather, fluid and varied, such that material assemblages may not properly reflect its multidimensional nature (Bernardini 2005:32; Eriksen 1992; Jones and Graves-Brown 1996). Eth­nic identity incorporates both self-ascription and ascription by others, influenced by external cir­cumstances and internal agency (Barth 1998; Nagel 1994). Rapid shifts in ethnic identity can result from changes in the physical or social environment (Reycraft 2005:5), such as in Late Intermediate period Chile, where Atacameiios created a unified identity in response to social encroachment fol­lowing Tiwanaku collapse (Torres-Rouff 2003: 142). Ethnic identity may also be manipulated for personal gain, as seen with Nubian individuals co-opting foreign Egyptian styles for status eleva­tion (Buzon 2006:692; Smith 2003). Due to the active, responsive nature of ethnic identity, the use of bounded cultural assemblages to identify past groups and their movements can be problematic (Chapman and Dolukhanov 1993; Emberling 1997; Singleton 1998: 174). 
Bioarchaeological methods offer promising approaches to some of these problems. In particu­lar, strontium isotope studies have been successful in distinguishing subgroups within a population (Ambrose and Krigbaum 2003; Katzenberg 2000). Although these studies do not specifically address issues of ethnic affiliation, strontium isotope analy­sis can document geographic origins and migration by establishing a local signature and identifying deviations representative of migrants (Burton et al. 2003). This technique is employed in the current study to identify migrants at the Cuzco Valley site of Chokepukio. 
Principles of Strontium Isotope Analysis 
Migration studies based on strontium isotopes rely on the principle that 87Sr/86Sr values in dental enamel reflect the local geological composition (Price et al. 1994 ). Geological 87Sr/86Sr values are a function of varying strontium (Sr) and rubidium (Rb) concentrations (i.e., Rb/Sr values) and the age of the bedrock within a given region. The only radi­ogenic isotope of Sr, 87Sr, is produced by the slow radioactive decay of the rubidium isotope 87Rb (Faure 1986). Because the 87Rb decay rate remains constant, the relative amount of 87Sr to 86Sr will reflect the composition of subsurface bedrock (i.e., its Rb/Sr value) and the time elapsed since forma­tion or deposition. Thus, regions containing older rocks with very high 87Rb/87Sr values (e.g., gran­ite) are characterized by higher 87Sr/86Sr values than areas containing younger basaltic rocks with lower Rb/Sr values (Faure 1986). Consequently, the geological composition influences the ratios of strontium isotopes in groundwater and soil, which are taken up by local plants and animals. 
Strontium is incorporated into the body's hard tissues through consumption of plant and animal products and water. Following consumption, stron­tium substitutes for calcium in the hydroxyapatite

of teeth and bone (Bentley 2006; Ericson 1985; Nelson eta!. 1986; Schroeder et al. 1972:496; Sealy et al. 1991 ). During the processes of consumption and substitution, the ratio of strontium isotopes remains constant-a prerequisite for migration studies. In some elements this is not the case: iso­tope amounts may change when moving from plants to animals to humans. Changes in isotope abundance result from their differences in mass, a process known as isotopic fractionation. While this process can affect isotopic analyses, it does not apply to strontium. With regard to the four stron­tium isotopes (84Sr, 86Sr, 87Sr, 88Sr), the relative mass difference is small, so isotopic fractionation does not occur through the food chain (Faure and Powell 1972). Because strontium isotope ratios are not altered by isotopic fractionation, an individual's 87Sr/86Sr values will mirror the original ratios pre­sent in the soil and groundwater of his or her local area, assuming that local food was eaten. 
Strontium isotopes become integrated in teeth during development in the first 12 years of life. After this phase of dental enamel formation, stron­timn isotope ratios do not change with additional intake. Minerals may be taken up by the surface of the tooth during life or after burial, yet these mate­rials seldom penetrate deep into the enamel (Budd et al. 2000; Price et al. 2002; Wright 2005). As such, individuals' dental strontium isotope ratios reflect their childhood environment, given that they consumed local foods (Burton et al. 2003:91). Strontium isotope analysis can therefore be used to detect migration, as a migrant's strontium value may differ from that of the local populace (if he or she lived in a geologically different region in early life [Price et al. 1994:327; Price et al. 2004)). In comparing individual values to the local isotope sig­nature, deviations may signify the presence of migrants. 
Strontium Isotope Analysis in the Andes 
The Andean region presents an ideal setting for strontium isotope analysis due to its varied geol­ogy. The Cuzco Valley and the adjacent Vilcanota Valley constitute an inter-Andean basin separat­ing the Andean hills to the south and west and the higher-range slopes to the north and east. The val­ley floor, formed by the Quaternary Pleis­tocene-aged San Sebastian Formation, consists of sedimentary gravels, alluvial fan sands, mudflows, extended diatornite, loams, clays, and peats. Within the district of Cuzco, igneous intrusive plutonic bodies of Paleocene origin have been identified. One such complex located north of the city of Cuzco, the Stock of Sacsayhuaman, is character­ized by medium-to-coarse fractured gray-green quartz diorite (Salvador and Davila 1994 ). Though no strontium isotope values have been published on geologic material from the Cuzco region, 87Sr/86Sr values for the Arequipa volcanics located just to the south range from .70714 to .70794 (James et al. 1976:Table 1; Lebti et al. 2006). In contrast to the Cuzco region, the southeastern Lake Titicaca area ofTiwanaku contains bedrock of pri­marily andesites and igneous basalts beneath a layer of Quaternary lacustrine and fluvial sedi­ments (Argollo et al. 1996; Binford and Kolata 1996). A third area, the Moquegua Valley, features 
a late Cenozoic volcanic composition that differs from Tiwanaku, with a geologically defined 87Sr/86Sr range of .7055 to .7068 (Hawkes worth et al. 1982; James 1982; Rogers and Hawkesworth 1989). 
Though geological sources may be used to determine the 87Sr/86Sr value of a region, faunal sources are preferred (Price et al. 2002; Sillen et al. 1995). Faunal sources more accurately mea­sure biologically available 87Sr/86Sr values, while water and soil sample 87Sr/86Sr values do not always have a direct 1: 1 relationship with animal tissue. Figure 1 shows the biologically available 87Sr/86Sr signatures of several locations in the Andes. The Tiwanaku 87Sr/86Sr signature, based on analysis of local cuy (guinea pig), shows a mean value of .7097 (n = 3; sd = .0006 [Knudson et al. 2004]). The Moquegua Valley exhibits a fau­na! 87Sr/86Sr mean value of .7063 (n = 3; sd = .0001 [Knudson et al. 2004]). In the San Pedro de Ata­cama region of northern Chile, faunal analysis produced a mean 87Sr/86Sr value of .7076, which does not overlap with either the Tiwanaku or Moquegua Valley regions (n 3; sd .0001
= = 
[Knudson 2004: 165)). 
Based on their unique geology, the strontium signatures of these areas can be used to explore ancient migrations between regions. However, two factors complicate this endeavor. First, strontium isotope ratios can differ within a region due to geo­logical microvariation. Because zones are rarely

homogeneous, single 87Sr/86Sr estimates cannot characterize an entire geological zone. Therefore, it is important to sample more than one location in an area. Second, several areas in the Andes may share the same 87Sr/86Sr signature, reflecting a sim­ilar geological composition. As a result, determin­ing the original residence of an immigrant is a complex undertaking. Particular areas can be elim­inated based on their 87Sr!86Sr signatures, but the specific location of an immigrant's homeland may be difficult to ascertain. 
Materials and Methods 
Strontium isotope (87Sr/86Sr) analyses were com­pleted on dental enamel from 59 individuals buried at Chokepukio (Table 1 ), a stratified site located 30 km southeast of the city of Cuzco (McEwan et al. 1995). The site is situated in the Lucre Basin, the easternmost basin of the Cuzco Valley that includes the Cuzco and Oropesa basins. Excavations from 1994 to 2005 uncovered architectural, artifactual, and skeletal remains from the Early Intermediate period (EIP, 200 B.C.-A.D. 700) through the Inca Imperial period/Late Horizon (LH, A.D. 1400-1532).2Though the site lacks a distinct ceme­tery section, certain spaces around Late Interme­diate period (LIP, A.D. 1000-1 400) and Late Horizon buildings were preferentially used for interment; from these site sectors, 176 burials were recovered. 
Of the 176 burials, 59 individuals were selected for strontium isotope analysis based on two crite­ria: age and the availability of teeth. Only adults were sampled for this initial study, and teeth (Table 2) were not available for several adults due to ante­mortem and postmortem loss. (Age and sex deter­mination followed Buikstra and Ubelaker 1994; these methods are described in Andrushko 2007.) The individuals were classified by time period using radiocarbon dates, stratigraphy, architectural asso­ciation, and material culture (when available). The burials contained few associated artifacts with lit­tle differentiation in mortuary treatment (Andrushko et al. 2006), such that group differences were rarely identifiable using material culture.

likely a result of diagenesis, as the 87Sr/86Sr values display no covariance with the Sr concentration in each sample (Figure 3; Budd et al. 2000; Hom and Mi.iller-Sohnius 1999). 
The traditional method for identifying migrants uses the faunal average ±2 standard deviations as the local range, with values outside of the range considered migrants (Price et al. 1994; Price et al. 2002). However, this method may not be appro­priate for the Chokepukio sample. Given the minute standard deviation of the Chokepukio faunal val­ues (sd .00013), the resulting local range com­

value (.70826) would be considered nonlocal. Because the traditional method does not account for the variation in 87Sr/86Sr values between Chokepukio and Tip6n, alternative techniques merit consideration. Accordingly, we have taken a more conservative approach to the identification of migrants, to account for the apparent local vari­ability of87Sr!86Sr values in this region of the Cuzco Valley. 
A different technique-using descriptive statis­tical analysis of the human data (Wright 2005)­appears better suited for the Chokepukio material. In this method, the data are analyzed for outliers (migrants), which are then separated from the main ("trimmed") body of data (locals). The trimmed data, when observed spatially, should conform to a normal distribution (Wright 2005:560). For
