ECONOMIC CONSUMPTION AND DOMESTIC ECONOMY 
IN CHOLULA'S RURAL HINTERLAND, MEXICO 

Kenneth Hirth 
The limited excavation of rural houses in the Mexican highlands has made it difficult to understand the structure of urban­rural economic relationships during the Classic period (A.D. 150 to 650), when many of the large cities at Teotihuacan, Cholula, and Monte Alban first developed. This paper examines economic consumption at Operation 7, a Late Classic rural residence located 11 km outside of the large center of Cholula, Puebla. The results show that Cholula was not the only, or even the primary, distribution center for goods consumed at Operation 7. Multiple procurement networks were operating during the Late Classic period to provision rural households with the goods they used. The recovery of a large number of imported ceramics and other goods with strong Teotihuacan affinities suggests integrated market networks, rather than solar market systems, operated to circulate goods throughout rural areas in Central Mexico. Comparative analysis of domes­tic assemblages is employed to identify differences 
in economic consumption that can be used to reconstruct the participa­tion of rural households in regional distribution networks centered on their urban neighbors. 
La limitada excavaci6n de unidades habitacionales rurales en el Altiplano Central de Mexico, ha hecho diffcil comprender la estructura de las relaciones econ6micas urbano-rurales durante el periodo Cldsico ( 150 a 650 d.C.), cuando se desarrollaron muchas de las primeras grandes ciudades en Teotihuacdn, Cholula y Monte Albdn. Este trabajo examina el consumo econ6mico en la Operaci6n 7, una residencia rural del Cldsico Tardio localizada a II km del gran centro urbano de Cholula, Puebla. El material recuperado en la Operaci6n 7 sugiere que el estudio del consumo econ6mico ha sido subutilizado como perspectiva analitica para reconstruir la organizaci6n de redes de distribuci6n econ6mica prehispdnicas, tanto a nivel domestico como no domestico. Aunque la Operaci6n 7 se hallaba cerca de Cholula, los resultados muestran que esta no era su unico, y ni siquiera su principal centro de distribuci6n de productos cerdmicos. La recuperaci6n de un gran numero de cerdmicas impor­tadas,figurillas, braseros con tapa con decoraci6n elaborada y candeleros con fuerte influencia teotihuacana, sugiere la exis­tencia de una red de mercado integrada que distribuia una amplia gama de productos en las zonas rurales del centro de Mexico. Esta red abasteci6 de bienes a las hogares rurales, lo cual result6 en una relaci6n econ6mica mds estrecha de la Operaci6n 7 con Teotihuacdn, que con Cholula. Aunque la Operaci6n 7 era una pequefia residencia rural, los materiales cerdmicos y liticos que se consumian alli dan una idea de los bienes que circulaban entre las zanas urbanas y rurales durante el periodo Cldsico. Este estudio demuestra que el andlisis comparativo de conjuntos domesticos puede ayudar a identificar diferencias en los patrones de consumo econ6mico que resultan utiles en la reconstrucci6n de la participaci6n de las unidades domesti­cas rurales en las redes de distribuci6n regionales.

and social hierarchy, it often lacks the contextual control necessary for comparative regional eco­nomic analysis. Comprehensive regional analysis of rural-urban economic relationships requires information from stratigraphic excavations in rural areas that can be compared with information from urban settings.1 While there are a number of rural residential excavations from the Mexican high­lands, most of these date to the Formative (Carballo 2009; Flannery 1976; Hirth et al. 2009; Plunket and Urufiuela 2005, 2012; Santley 1993; Serra Puche 1988; Serra Puche and Lazcano 2011) and Post­classic periods (Charlton 1972; Cobean and Mas­tache 1999; Darras 2009; Evans 1988; Smith 1992, 1999). Notably absent are studies of rural domes­tic economic activities during the Classic period coincident with the emergence of early states at Teotihuacan, Cholula, and Monte Alban (but see Charlton 1994, 2000; Charlton et al. 2002; Fein­man et al. 2002, 2007). 
This study examines patterns of resource con­sumption in a single rural household in Central Mexico during the Late Classic period. Here I use the term household to refer to the social unit of eco­nomic consumption and the term residence to iden­tify the homestead or physical locale of residence for this dynamic social group (Hirth 1993a). The residence excavated at Operation 7 is located on the northern edge of the modem town of San Bue­naventura Nealtican, 11 km west of the large Clas­sic period center of Cholula, Puebla (Figure I). Cholula was a very large urban center that domi­nated the densely populated Valley of Puebla dur­ing the Classic period (Dumond and Mtiller 1972), coexisting alongside the larger and more powerful center of Teotihuacan located 95 km to the north­west in the Basin of Mexico (Millon 1973; Sanders et al. l 979) (Figure 1). This study explores the eco­nomic relationship between rural Nealtican and the nearby center of Cholula during the Late Classic period. Fundamental to this discussion is the nor­mally untested assumption that the consumption of local and non-local goods in rural contexts is a reflection of household procurement networks and the regional distribution networks through which goods move. The discussion begins with an exam-

ination of domestic economy and why household consumption is useful for archaeological research. It then describes the rural residence excavated at Nealtican and the domestic material assemblage recovered there. These materials are then compared to what is found at Cholula and interpreted in terms of what they indicate about regional distribution networks and urban-rural economic relationships in Central Mexico during the Classic period. 
Consumption and the Domestic Economy 
Households were the backbone of all ancient eco­nomic systems,just as they are for societies today. Households produced and consumed the bulk of all the food, fuel, and fiber resources in ancient soci­ety. If they did not, their members would not have survived. An important comparative difference between ancient societies is the degree of movement of goods between where they were produced and where they were consumed. Societies where the volume of goods moving between households was low are often characterized as being self-sufficient. Conversely, societies where there is greater move­ment of goods between households are considered to be more commercialized (Smith 2004). The effi­ciency and cost of transportation strongly affected the volume and distance over which goods moved 
,(Drennan l 984a; Morley 2007; Silver 1995). While ancient societies are characterized as non-com­mercial in comparison to modem ones (Finley 1973; Polanyi 1957), they can display a significant level of commodity movement that often is not examined from a comparative perspective (Smith 2004). The reality is that ancient households were never really self-sufficient. The myth of household self­sufficiency has been dispelled by 90 years of ethno­graphic research on the economic systems of small-scale societies (Beals 1975:56-57; Mali­nowski 1961; Posposil 1963; Pryor 1977; Sahlins 1972:83-85; Sundstrom 1974; Wiessner 2002). Likewise, archaeological research has identified the movement of resources through exchange net­works as early as the Upper Paleolithic period (Kuzmin and Glascock 2010; MacNeish et al. 1967; McBrearty and Brooks 2000; White 1986) and which increased as groups became more sedentary (Dixon et al. 1968; Flannery 1976). Nowhere were households social and economic isolates unto themselves (Flannery 1976). The rea­
son for this was a matter of survival. While house­holds may strive to produce the majority of the resources they consume, economic autonomy is very risky. Even households with the capacity to meet all their consumption needs eventually face resource shortfalls that may need to be resolved though exchange with others (O'Shea 1989). Fur­thermore, diverse ecological landscapes often cre­ate inter-household exchange relationships between groups residing in different environmental zones (Malinowski 1961; Steward 1938). Even in homogenous environments, economic specializa­tion by age, group, and gender can increase the diversity and efficiency of products available through exchange. 
The formation and use of inter-household exchange networks is essential for household sur­vival (Hirth 2009a; Wiessner 2002). There are few formal safety nets in pre-industrial societies, and households minimize their risk by establishing rec­iprocal networks with family, friends, and distant kin. These informal networks form the social sys­tem in which domestic units operate, and their maintenance normally involves the movement of food and other goods between interacting parties (Dalton 1977; Mauss 1990; Mayer 2005). These networks account for why goods and resources move between domestic units even in rich natural environments where resource shortages are rare. 
Households, therefore, regularly consume goods produced by others. The level of exchange and external resource consumption is reflected by the range of local and non-local goods recovered in domestic assemblages.Archaeologists have rec­ognized this and regularly utilize domestic archi­tecture and their associated material goods to examine household consumption patterns (Dou­glass and Gonlin 2012; Gonlin 2012; Hirth 1993b; Sheets 2006). The Classic period residence at Nealtican provides an opportunity to examine household consumption in the Cholula hinterland and what this reflects about the broader regional distribution networks in which it participated. 
Nealtican and the Tetimpa Region 
The town of San Buenaventura Neal ti can is located in the Tetimpa region on the western edge of the Valley of Puebla (Figure 2). Tetimpa is not a nat­ural physiographic region, but refers to the area on

the northeast flank of the Popocatepetl volcano, where two recent Holocene eruptions deposited a series of thick ash and pumice deposits across the landscape, disrupting prehispanic occupation and burying archaeological sites (Panfil 1996; Panfil et al. 1999; Plunket and Urufiuela 1998a, 2006; Siebe 2000; Siebe et al. 1996). These deposits covered the landscape between the modem towns of Xal­itzinta on the west and San Buenaventura Nealti­can on the east (Figure 2). Both Holocene eruptions disrupted prehispanic occupation, resulting in rapid abandonment followed by a gradual reoccupation of the region as agricultural fertility was restored. The Nealtican household examined here dates to the period between these two major eruptions of Popocatepetl. The first eruption was a large Plin­ian-style volcanic episode that occurred during the first century A.D. This eruption deposited yellow ash and pumice over more than 240 km2 extend­ing at least 25 km due east of the Popocatepetl crater (Figure 3) (Panfil 1996: 16; Panfil et al. 1999; Plunket and Urufiuela 2006). These deposits blan­keted two thirds of this area with between 50 and 100 cm of ash (Figure 3), covering houses and agri­cultural fields (Lopez 2000; Plunket and Urufiuela 1998a) and resulting in the immediate abandon­ment of the region (Plunket and Urufiuela 2000). 
Erosion and soil building processes gradually restored partial agricultural fertility to the region, resulting in the establishment of a small dispersed village atNealtican aroundA.D. 500 along the east­ern edge of the pumice ash fall (Figure 3). This vil­lage was occupied until the initiation of the second series of volcanic eruptions beginning in the sev­enth to eighth centuries A.D. These eruptions deposited between 40 and 110 cm of pink and white andesitic pumice over a 200 to 250 km arc east and northeast of the Popocatepetl crater (Figure 4), cov­ering Nealtican and its agricultural fields with 35 to 40 cm of pumice (Figure 5), after which the region was again abandoned. 
Excavations at Nealtican undertaken by this author were part of the Proyecto Tetimpa directed by Gabriela Urufiuela and Patricia Plunket, which rescued archaeological remains in danger of being destroyed by local pumice mining (Seele 1973). The rapid expansion of the nearby city of Puebla in the 1980s created a demand for pumice from the Tetimpa region for use in the manufacture of light­weight cement block. A series of small-scale fac­tories sprung up in the town of Nealtican that used this material as binder to manufacture block. As a result, farmers began selling the pumice underly­ing their agricultural fields to contractors, who

stripped it off with front-end loaders to supply local block making workshops. By the early 1990s, this had escalated into a fairly large-scale enterprise. Contractors would strip off the pumice down to the first century A.D. agricultural surface, where farm­ers would replant their fields anywhere from 50 cm to 2.0 m below the previous contemporary agri­cultural surface. In the process, all archaeological remains covered by volcanic deposits were bull­dozed and destroyed. 
Although pumice deposits around Nealtican are relatively thin (30 to 40 cm) compared to those fur­ther to the west, their removal was economically viable given their proximity to local block making workshops. Removal of pumice from an agricul­tural field on the north side of the modem town exposed a portion of a Classic period residence in the profile of the adjacent field. This house was brought to the attention of the author, along with the news that the field where it was located was

targeted for pumice removal. With the permission of the contractor, archaeological excavations were conducted to uncover the residential architecture and to salvage any associated archaeological remains. The residence was excavated as Opera­tion 7 and, upon completion of the investigation, the area was mined for pumice and its Late Clas­sic period structure was destroyed. 
The Prehispanic Nealtican Community and Domestic Architecture at Operation 7 
Prehispanic occupation was relatively light throughout the Tetimpa region during the Classic period because good agricultural land was in rela­tively short supply. The prehispanic village of Nealtican probably contained between 15 to 20 residences; although small, it appears to have been the largest settlement in the region. Houses were dispersed over approximately 12 ha (Figure 2) and were separated from one another by intervening agricultural plots. Residents apparently employed a form of infield-outfield agriculture (Sanders 1976) , where the plots adjacent to residences (infields) were cultivated along with outfields fur­ther outside the community. A set of outfields cov­ered by pumice from the second volcanic eruption were located 2.5 km west of Operation 7 (Hirth and Andrews 1998). Excavations here did not identify an associated residential occupation, suggesting that they were outfields for households in or near the Nealtican community. 
The house encountered was excavated as Oper­ation 7. It consisted of five preserved rooms that opened onto three enclosed patios. Because the north side of the residence was destroyed by pumice mining, its complete floor plan remains unknown. Nevertheless, a total of 197.5 m2 were excavated, and its preserved rooms and patios are illustrated in Figures 6 and 7. 
All the rooms in this residence were built directly on the yellow pumice of the first-century eruption. Walls were constructed of unfired adobe blocks that were set either on the ground surface or on a foundation of unfaced rock 15 to 20 cm in height. The adobes used throughout the residence

were 52 to 65 cm long, 32 to 35 cm wide, and 14 to 15 cm thick. Floors in both rooms and patios con­sisted of compacted earth laid over a layer of small rock and pumice fragments. Floors of rooms open­ing onto patios were elevated 15 to 25 cm above the floor of the patio to prevent water from enter­ing the structure. Fine mud plaster was used to fin­ish the surface of walls throughout the house. Two episodes of construction could be discerned in Operation 7: the initial construction of rooms in the South Patio, followed by the construction of rooms 4 and 5 in the Central and North patios. 
The South Patio is 5 .8 m wide and contained four room structures. The largest preserved room within this patio is Room 1, which is 8.4 m2 in size. It is located on the north side of the patio and was probably used as a dormitory room. Room 1 had two doorways: one at its SE corner that provided access to the South Patio and another along its east­ern side, providing egress to the east. The contin­uous floor surface across Room 1 and into both doorways indicates that the room was constructed with two original doorways. Located at the SE cor­ner of the patio, Room 3 is 6.7 m2 in size and was used as a kitchen area, based on the presence of a floor-level hearth (R3) along its northern side and a refuse deposit of organic waste and charcoal in the SE comer of the patio alongside Room 3 (R4). Room 2 is located in the NE comer of the patio and probably functioned as an auxiliary sleeping and/or storage room witli only 3 .1 m2 of floor area. A sec­ond refuse concentration of ceramic and lithic debris (R49) was found in the NE comer of the patio adjacent to Room 2. 
One important feature of the residential archi­tecture at Operation 7 was the construction of low benches along the front of buildings, where peo­ple could sit or recline within the patio. Bench R5 was constructed along the south side of Room 1, with the west end of the bench wrapping around its SW comer. Similarly, bench Rl l was con­structed along the west side of Room 3, ending in a small, wrap-around element at the room's south­west comer.

Figure 7. Structures in the South Patio of Operation 7. Room 1 is in the foreground. 
The second construction episode consisted of remodeling and expanding the size of the residence by adding Rooms 4 and 5. It was at this time that the South Patio was enclosed with adobe walls along its north and south sides. The north wall was constructed as an extension of the south facade of Room 1, and bench RS was extended along the entire length of the South Patio. Furthermore, it was during this remodeling episode that the south door­way of Room 1 was closed with an adobe wall, making it a separate storage or dormitory room without access to the South Patio. 
The construction of Rooms 4 and 5, with 11.0 and 11.3 m2 of floor area, significantly expanded the size of the residence and may reflect its transi­tion from a nuclear to an extended or conjoint fam­ily residence as offspring married but continued to reside in their natal household. These two rooms were constructed simultaneously at, or shortly after, the enclosure of the South Patio. Room 4 was ori­ented so that its south wall paralleled the north wall of the South Patio, forming a second interior area called the Central Patio (Figure 6). The simultane­ous construction of Rooms 4 and 5 was evident from 1) the identification of interlocking adobes spanning adjacent and adjoining walls at their west-em corners; 2) their construction on the same ground surface; and 3) the construction of bench feature R25 as a single feature along the exterior walls of Rooms 4 and 5. 
The doors of Rooms 4 and 5 open onto the North Patio. The excavation of an adobe wall at the NW comer of Room 5 established that the North Patio was an enclosed space. Rooms 4 and 5 were both large rooms with small hearths (R6, R7) along their northern walls; each of the rooms was sufficiently large to have housed a separate nuclear family. Not enough of the residence is preserved to determine whether the three patios were connected or had sep­arate entrances. Whatever the situation, they reflect the enclosure of exterior spaces that were associated with individual family units within the residence. On the whole, ceramic and lithic materials were recov­ered in low to moderate densities across occupation surfaces, especially along the southern and eastern sides of Operation 7, where both features and dis­carded refuse were identified (Figure 6). 
As mentioned above, Operation 7 predates the initiation of the second series of volcanic eruptions of the Popocatepetl volcano (Figure 4). During the excavation, several undisturbed patches of the white tephra from the second eruption were iden-

tified on the east side of the residence, confirming that ash from this eruption reached the Nealtican area (Panfil 1996:Figure Sc). These eruptions cer­tainly made life in Nealtican more difficult. Agri­cultural outfields further to the west were abandoned as the thicker ash deposits there made maize cultivation untenable (Figure 5). Approxi­mately 30 cm of white pumice tephra fell on Nealti­can over a relatively short span of time, degrading the agricultural landscape and leading to the com­munity's abandonment. 
Domestic Consumption: The Ceramic and 
Lithic Assemblages at Operation 7 

All rural and urban households have the same basic resource needs: food to eat and the artifact assem­blages to process, cook, and serve it to its mem­bers. While food remains are highly perishable, the lithic and ceramic inventories associated with their preparation and service are not. It is through this imperishable artifactual record that household con­sumption patterns are most easily studied. Here I examine what the ceramic and lithic assemblages indicate about household consumption patterns at Operation 7. 
Ceramics were the most ubiquitous material recovered in the excavations at Operation 7 .A total of 4,467 sherds were recovered, of which 4,412 
(98.8 percent) were Late Classic in date (AD. 450 to 650); they are summarized in Table 1.2This sam­ple reflects the composition of the household's ceramic assemblage over the length of its Late Clas­sic occupation. Nevertheless, the density of ceram­ics across the excavation was low, suggesting that the occupation at Operation 7 was relatively brief, perhaps not exceeding two or three generations. There is no indication that any of the vessels were made within the Nealtican community.3 Instead, all ceramics appear to be brought into the community from both near and far, providing an excellent opportunity to examine how households like Oper­ation 7 were linked to Cholula and/or other pro­duction and distribution centers. 
The majority of the ceramics are utilitarian wares manufactured within the nearby Valley of Puebla, IO to 15 km to the east. Local manufacture was determined on the basis of paste, and these

wares constitute 86.7 percent of the Late Classic assemblage. Locally manufactured ceramics were medium-coarse tempered bodies and, as expected, included the full array of cooking, storage, and ser­vice vessels, as well as some special-purpose items like ritual braziers, censers, miniature vessels, and figurines. While the forms of storage and cooking vessels reflect local preferences, service wares share stylistic similarities that conform to Teoti­huacan 's Late Classic ceramic tradition that was widely distributed across Central Mexico between 
A.D. 450 and 650 (Dumond and Mi.iller 1972; Martinez and Jarquin 2006; Mi.iller l978a, l 978b; Rattray 2001). These include a preference for ser­vice ware in three primary vessel forms: flat bot­tom outflaring wall bowls, sub-hemispherical ring base bowls, and the vertical wall cylindrical vases. 
Imported wares constitute the remaining 13.3 percent of the ceramics at Operation 7 (Table 1) and deviate from local pastes in composition, texture, and/or firing. Not surprisingly, the majority of imported vessels were service wares ( outflaring flat bottom bowls, sub-hemispherical ring base bowls) and specialty vessels (vases,floreros, small footed ollas); a few light weight jars are also found.4 What is most surprising about the imported vessels is the range of areas from which they originate. 
Thin Orange is the most common imported ceramic ware at Operation 7. This ceramic, also called Regular and Rfo Carnero Thin Orange by other scholars, is one of the most widely distrib­uted trade wares in Mesoamerica and a hallmark of the Classic period (Kolb 1977, 1986; Rattray 1981, 2001; Sotomayor and Castillo 1963). While it is often associated with Teotihuacan, Rattray (1990a, 1990b; Rattray and Harbottle 1992) has established that it was manufactured in the Rfo Carnero region of southern Puebla (Figure 1). Thin Orange was exported across Central Mexico by regional merchants or by its own producer-ven­dors (Hirth 2013; Kolb 1986). The hallmark form for this ware was the sub-hemispherical ring base bowl that enabled vessels to be efficiently stacked for transport. Because of its transportability, Thin Orange occurs in small amounts as far afield as Copan, Honduras (Fash 2002) and Kaminaljuyu, Guatemala (Kidder et al. 1946). Thin Orange occurs in three forms at Operation 7: sub-hemi­spherical ring base bowls, cylindrical vases, and small ollas with nubbin supports. 
A related imported ceramic also manufactured in southern Puebla is the type known as Coarse or Thick Thin Orange (Lackey 1986). This ceramic type made its appearance in the Valley of Puebla during the Late Classic period as a strong, light­weight ceramic vessel manufactured primarily in jar forms (Anderson 2009). This ceramic may not have been the object of trade. Instead, it is believed that it moved as a shipping container (Lackey 1986) forother goods such as salt, honey, resin, or maguey syrup. 
Two other forms of Thin Orange were also iden­tified at Operation 7 and can be distinguished from one another on the basis of paste. The first of these is Buff Thin Orange, which is manufactured from a heavily tempered ceramic paste with quartz and hematite inclusions. This ceramic is evenly and completely fired and, like regular Thin Orange, occurs as sub-hemispherical ring base bowls. Although its locus of manufacture remains unknown, its distinctive paste and vessel form underscores its role as an import at Operation 7. One possibility is that it was manufactured in the Valley of Toluca, where orange-buff ring base bowls have been identified in quantity as a form of imitation Thin Orange (Gonzalez de la Vara 1999:66; Sugiura 1981). 
Micacious Thin Orange is the other distinctive, but relatively rare, imported ceramic. Like Buff Thin Orange, it is an imitation of the better known Rio Carnero Thin Orange type (see above). Its paste is distinctive because it contains large quantities of mica and quartz inclusions. It occurs primarily in sub-hemispherical ring base bowls and its likely source of manufacture is the Mixteca Baja region of northwestern Oaxaca, where micaceous pastes are very common (Winter 2006: 108-I 11). My own research indicates that this ceramic was traded in low amounts from eastern Puebla to western More­los. This ceramic is not one of the three types iden­tified by Sotomayor and Castillo ( 1963) in their study of Thin Orange pastes, nor has it been iden­tified at Teotihuacan (Rattray 2001). It is an inter­esting trade ware because it documents long distance trade between the Mixteca Baja and areas of Central Mexico during the Late Classic period. 
Two other non-Thin Orange imports were also found at Operation 7: Manzana Greyware and Teot6n Red-on-Brown. Manzana Greyware was fired in reducing atmosphere to create a dark gray

(7.5YR 5/0) to bluish gray (SB 5-6/1) color. This type occurs both in bowls and in small, tall-neck jars. While reduced ceramics are rare in Central Mexico, they are very common in the Valley of Oaxaca and the Mixteca Alta during the Classic period (Caso et al. 1967). Nevertheless, compositional analysis reveals that reduced wares were produced in the northeast Basin of Mexico during the Late Forma­tive period (Plunket et al. 2005). Greywares are often associated with groups from Oaxaca, and its pres­ence at Operation 7 suggests contact with groups that moved into the Valley of Puebla (Hirth and Swezey 
1975) and the Basin of Mexico at Teotihuacan (Spence 2005) during the Classic period. 
Like Manzana Greyware, Teot6n Red-on­Brown occurs in low frequency but is notable for its paste, form, and stylistic characteristics. The paste fires to a distinctive reddish brown to light reddish brown (SYR 5-6/3-4) and occurs primar­ily as cylinder vases and outflaring wall bowls. This red-on-brown bichrome employs both spec­ular and non-specular red pigments to create sur­face designs on vessel exteriors. Stylistically it resembles other ceramics from the Basin of Mex­ico, making this region a likely source of origin. 
An array of other ceramic paraphernalia was recovered in Operation 7 that includes mold-made figurines, candeleros, and elaborately decorated lidded braziers commonly associated with domes­tic ritual at Teotihuacan and other sites in the Basin of Mexico. Mold-made figurines manufactured in Teotihuacan style are common in the Tetimpa region (Figure 8) and were used in domestic ritu­als and/or incorporated in domestic shrines. They are identical to figurines found at Teotihuacan, three of which are semi-conical, mold-made figurines with back supports to enable them to stand upright on a floor or altar surface. Sullivan (2007:206) observes that figurines at Teotihuacan were prob­ably distributed through the marketplace. This is an important feature of the broader consumer-dis­tribution system, since it would have made these goods broadly available to consumers in Teoti­huacan's regional hinterland, including the Valley of Puebla. 
Candeleroswere also part of Late Classic period domestic ritual at Operation 7. Most archaeologists believe that candeleroswere small portable incense burners used to bum copal within residences dur­ing domestic rituals (Kolb 1988; Sejoume 1966:32, Figures 17-20). The most common type of can­delero at Teotihuacan was the double-hole variety, which is rare outside the Basin of Mexico (Figure 9). One double-hole candelero was recovered at Operation 7 (Figure 10), which was probably an import from the Basin.

Elaborate lidded braziers are a hallmark ofTeoti­huacan culture (Figure 11). Excavations at Teoti­huacan indicate that these items were manufactured both in a special workshop in the Ciudadela cere­monial complex (Munera 1985) and in at least one non-ritual, domestic context (Cosotlan 23) on the NW sector of the city (Sullivan 2007). The wide­spread distribution of adomos from these braziers across the city suggsts that they were a common feature of domestic ritual at Teotihuacan (Sullivan 2007:207-208). Several ceramic appliques and a decorated brazier chimney were also recovered at Operation 7 that came from the lid of at least one, and possibly two, elaborately decorated ceremo­nial braziers (Figure 12). The presence of elabo­rate lidded braziers at Operation 7 was a surprise

since they previously have been interpreted as evi­dence for "strong contact" with Teotihuacan (Hell­muth 1978). 
Stone tools used for cutting and grinding tasks were an indispensable component of Mesoamer­ican domestic assemblages. Grinding stones used to process maize and other foods were manufac­tured from basalt which outcrops 7 km west of Nealtican (Figure 2). Flaked stone tools, on the other hand, were manufactured from imported obsidian and chert. Seventy-three obsidian and 20 chert artifacts were recovered from Operation 7 (Table 2). Green and gray obsidian occur in equal proportion, although in different forms. Green obsidian reached the residence primarily as prismatic blades, while gray obsidian was con­sumed in the household both as finished prismatic blades and as small nodules used to produce expe­dient flakes. A few bifacial and unifacial obsid­ian artifacts also entered the household in finished form. Chert also is an import at Operation 7 and was brought in both as nodules to produce expe­dient flakes and as finished bifacial and unifacial artifacts.

Obsidian artifacts were sourced using a combi­nation of visual and chemical techniques. Visual sourcing was used to identify the green obsidian, since only the Sierra de Pachuca, Hidalgo, pro­duces the highly distinctive green obsidian that was widely distributed throughout Central Mexico dur­ing the Classic period (Cobean 2002; Pastrana and Dominguez 2009). Gray obsidian can be obtained from multiple sources in Central Mexico (Cobean 2002) and cannot be accurately sourced using visual techniques. Thirty-three artifacts (32 gray, 1 green) were analyzed using abbreviated instru­mental neutron activation analysis (INAA) (Glas­cock et al. 1994) at the Missouri University Research Reactor (MURR). 
The results show that obsidian entered Opera­tion 7 from four different sources in Central Mex­ico (Figure 1). The majority of the obsidian was green ( 50. 7 percent) and INAA analysis confirmed that this material came from the Sierra de Pachuca source. The results of the analysis of the gray obsid­ian are summarized in Tables 3 and 4. Gray obsid­ian represents 49 .3 percent of the total obsidian assemblage and is divided evenly between three

sources: Otumba, Mexico (18. 7 percent), Pared6n, Mexico (15 .3 percent) and Zaragoza, Puebla ( 15 .3 percent).5 All four sources contributed prismatic obsidian blades to the household assemblage, although fully two-thirds of the obsidian blades and blade artifacts (65.4 percent) were manufac­tured from obsidian from Sierra de Pachuca, fol­lowed by Zaragoza (15.4 percent), Pared6n (9.6 percent), and Otumba (9.6 percent). Bifaces and uni faces were imported in finished form from both the Sierra de Pachuca and Pared6n source areas. Operation 7 conforms to the pattern seen elsewhere during the Classic period, whereby green obsidian from the Pachuca source dominates the assemblage (Clayton 2009: 170; Santley 1983; Spence 1981, 1996). The presence of gray obsidian from Otumba, Pared6n, and Zaragoza at Teotihuacan (Carballo et al. 2007: 176) is more difficult to evaluate since, although these sources occur, they frequently are used in the production of bifaces, which are rare at Operation 7 (but see Gazzola 2008). 
Rural-Urban Domestic Assemblage Comparisons with Cholula 
One of the striking features of Operation 7 is that, while it was a small rural residence, it was remark­ably well supplied with non-local goods. Had it been absolutely necessary, the residents of Nealti­can could have manufactured their ceramics from local clay and shaped their flaked stone cutting tools from locally available fine-grain basalt. But they did not. Instead, all of the ceramics, obsidian,

and chert utilized at Nealtican were imported either from the nearby Valley of Puebla or beyond. The question is, how were regional distribution net­works structured to enable the residents of Opera­tion 7 and other households in the Nealtican community to meet their consumption needs? 
As mentioned above, one reason that excava­tions were undertaken at Operation 7 was that they provided an opportunity to explore a Late Classic household in Cholula's rural hinterland. Based on regional survey, Garcfa Cook ( 1981 :Figure 8-27) proposed that Cholula dominated and controlled all of the Valley of Puebla during the Classic period, including the Tetimpa region (also Sanders et al. 1979; Schmidt 1975:218). Cholula's civic-cere­monial architecture underscores its regional impor­tance (McCafferty 1996a). The initial construction of the Great Pyramid began toward the end of the first century A.D. (Urufiuela et al. 2009: 147) and grew to 180 m (N-S) x 200 m (E-W) and 35 m high by the end of the third century A.D. (Urufiuela et al. 20 13). The subsequent construction history of the Great Pyramid is unclear, although Marquina estimated that it continued to expand during the Late Classic and/or Epiclassic period, eventually reaching 400 m on a side and 62 m high by the end of the phase IV construction sequence (Marquina 1964:123-124, 1970a). 
The extent of the Classic period urban zone is difficult to map because the modem town overlies the prehispanic settlement. Analysis of test pitting information from the Proyecto Cholula by Floren­cia Mi.ill er (I 973:Cuadro 3) suggests that Cholula's urban population covered somewhere between 3 .0 and 3 .5 km2. Surface reconnaissance conducted by the University of the Americas in 1977 revised this estimate upward to 6 km2 for A.D. 500 (Peterson 1987:73-74). Recent recalculation of the Muller (1973) site estimates place Cholula's size some­where between 7 to 8 km2 (Plunket, personal com­munication, May 2013; Plunket and Urufiuela n.d.). While these studies do not present the data on which 
Downloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core. YBP Library Services, on 22 Aug 2018 at 17:23:57, subject to the Cambridge Core terms of use, available at https://www.cambridge.org/core/terms. https://doi.org/10.7183/1045-6635.24.2.123 
their estimates are based, it is likely that Cholula ranged between 6 and 8 km2 during its Classic period apogee. Cholula remained a major political­religious center through the Spanish Conquest, when it was an important religious pilgrimage cen­ter for all of eastern Mesoamerica (Kirchhoff et al. 1976; Olivera 1970). It was also one of the most important market centers in Central Mexico at the time of the Spanish Conquest (Peterson 1987:73), and its merchants probably traversed the far reaches of Mesoamerica as early as 900 A.D. The size of Cholula's resident population, the scale of its Clas­sic period ceremonial architecture, its occupation since the Middle Formative period, and its role as one of Mesoamerica's most important religious and pilgrimage centers suggest that the city was a major regional market center by at least the beginning of the Classic period, if not earlier.6 
Given these conditions, it was logical to expect that Cholula would be the location where many of the goods consumed at Operation 7 were obtained. The Nealtican community is located 11 km west of Cholula, which represents one day's round-trip journey on foot for household provisioning. Fur­thermore, there is no other large Classic site closer to Nealtican than Cholula that could have func­tioned as an intermediary market or distribution center supplying goods for rural populations (Schmidt 1975:218). Nealtican's small size and location suggest that it should have been an inte­gral part of Cholula's economic hinterland. The excavated materials suggest that this was not nec­essarily the case. 
Examination of Operation 7's domestic assem­blage suggests that Cholula was not the sole (or even the primary) source for many of the goods that it consumed. While ceramic and lithic assemblages from Cholula remain understudied, enough work has been conducted to make general assemblage comparisons with Cholula. For example, similari­ties in the composition of their imported and region­ally manufactured ceramic assemblages would suggest that Nealtican was incorporated into Cholula's economic hinterland, while differences would imply that it was not. What is evident is that the residents of Nealtican had access to, and con­sumed, imported products not widely available at Cholula. This suggests that a complex distribution system was operating in rural areas that circulated goods that did not enter large urban places like Cholula. The fact that these are imported goods cre­ates interpretive problems for how or why imports should have bypassed a large urban center like Cholula, whose large population and sociopoliti­cal complexity certainly would have created a greater demand for non-local exotic goods than a small rural community like Nealtican. 
Table 5 summarizes the similarities and differ­ences in material assemblages between Operation 7 and Cholula. Six imported ceramic types were recovered at Operation 7 (Table 1), only four of which are reported from Cholula. Common Thin Orange imported from the Rfo Camero region of southern Puebla represents 6.8 percent of the total ceramic assemblage by count and 11.2 percent of the vessel count in the domestic assemblage of Operation 7 (Table 1). This contrasts with the sit­uation in Cholula, where common Thin Orange is relatively rare 7 (McCafferty 2001: 140; Plunket and Urufiuela 1998b:l06). Although Noguera (1954: 192) and Miiller (1978a) note the presence of common Thin Orange at the Great Pyramid in Cholula, excavations throughout the city normally report low frequencies in the range of .4 to 4.0 per­cent of assemblages, rarely exceeding this level even in special contexts (Plunket and Urufiuela l 998a:Figure 4). Low Thin Orange frequencies are likewise reported from Cerro Zapotecas, located 3 km west of Cholula (Mountjoy 1987; Mountjoy and Peterson 1973), where it constitutes only I.I percent of its total Classic ceramic assemblage (Plunket and Urufiuela 1998b:108). 
Coarse Thin Orange occurs at both sites, but appears more commonly in Cholula than Nealti­can. At Cholula, Coarse Thin Orange is more abun­dant than regular Thin Orange, averaging 3 to 4 percent of deposits, but reaching frequencies as high as 5 to 7 percent in some contexts (Plunket and Urufiuela 1998b:Figure 4). The same is true in the Valley of Atlixco at the site of Hacienda San Lorenzo (AT-1), located 20 km southwest of Cholula (Plunket and Blanco 1989). Here Coarse Thin Orange can be as high as 16 percent of total collections (Plunket and Urufmela l998b:Figure 4). These levels are much higher than those found at Operation 7, where Coarse Thin Orange consti­tutes 2.6 percent of the total assemblage by sherd frequency and 4.3 percent by vessel count (Table 1). Clearly it was not as abundant here as it was at Cholula and in the Atlixco region.8

Of the imports recovered at Operation 7, nei­ther Micaceous Thin Orange nor Manzana Grey­ware are reported for Cholula for the Late Classic. Although Miiller ( l 978a:54-55) reports micaceous paste bowls for the Cholula II period (A.D. 200 to 350), they are not the Micaceous Thin Orange type discussed here. Likewise, no ceramic type similar to Manzana Greyware has been identified at Cholula.9 A form of imitation Thin Orange has been reported for the Early Classic at R-106 in Cholula (Mccafferty 1996b:Table 3) that could be similar to the Buff Thin Orange found at Nealtican. Red­on-brown ceramics that may be similar to Teot6n Red-on-Brown have been found at Cholula (Miiller 1978a:60, 73), although their frequency remains unreported. 
The vessel forms found at Operation 7 resem­ble the Late Classic materials at Cholula with two notable exceptions: the presence of cylinder vases and bowls with tripod nubbin supports. Cylinder vases with tripod supports are a common compo­nent of Late Classic assemblages in Central Mex­ico but are rare at Cholula (Plunket and Urufiuela 1998a:108). When they occur at Cholula, they do so without supports (e.g., Miiller 1978a:75; Noguera 1954:179, Figure 1). In contrast, vases were common enough at N ealtican to represent 2 .2 percent of total service ware, a low but respectable frequency given their near absence in Cholula. Flat bottom bowls with outflaring sides were common at Cholula, but like vases, normally lack supports. This contrasts sharply with Operation 7, where

fully 20 percent of all flat bottom bowls had small 
tripod nubbin supports, an occurrence rate consis­
tent with that found in the Basin of Mexico and else­
where in Central Mexico during the Classic period. 
Another important difference between Nealti­
can and Cholula was observed in the area of domes­
tic ritual. Household ritual was an important part 
of domestic life throughout Mesoamerica 
(McAnany 2002; Monaghan 1995) . It served to 
integrate household economic activities while it 
strengthened the corporate and religious identities 
of their members (Plunket 2002a, 2002b). Domes­
tic ritual is reflected both in the physical spaces 
where rituals were performed and in the material 
paraphernalia used to perform them (e.g., White­
house 1996). Since ritual reinforces the ideologi­
cal identity of the practitioners, it provides 
archaeologists with the opportunity to identify dif­
ferences in both ethnicity and household-based 
belief systems that are fundamental to defining and 
differentiating between groups at the most funda­
mental cultural level (McAnany 2002). 
A comparison of ritual paraphernalia at Opera­
tion 7 and Cholula suggests some fundamental dif­
ferences between them in domestic ritual. Classic 
period domestic ritual in Cholula appears to have 
revolved around the use of figurines as possible 
ancestor effigies and ritualized drinking of alco­
holic or hallucinogenic pulque (McCafferty 
1996b:308). In Nealtican, the pattern was some­
what different. Here the Late Classic domestic rit­
ual assemblage is very much like that found at
