REGIONAL VARIATION IN THE IMPORTANCE AND USES OF MAIZE 
IN THE EARLY AND MIDDLE FORMATIVE OLMEC HEARTLAND: 
NEW ARCHAEOBOTANICAL DATA FROM THE SAN CARLOS 
HOMESTEAD, SOUTHERN VERACRUZ 

Amber M. VanDerwarker and Robert P. Kruger 
This article presents an archaeobotanical analysis from the site of San Carlos, a small Early/Middle Formative period homestead situated in the Coatzacoalcos River basin in the southern Veracruz lowlands, approximately 9 km southeast of San Lorenzo. Although archaeobotanical datafrom the Olmec heartland have become more widely reported in recent years, we still lack sufficient data to capture regional and temporal variation in plant foodways. Thus, we report the macrobot­anical data from San Carlos and provide a quantitative comparison with existing data sets from other southern Veracruz sites with Early and Middle Formative components (La Joya and Tres Zapotes). Comparative analysis reveals that these three sites vary dramatically in terms of the ubiquity and abundance of maize, in addition to the frequencies of different 
fruit types. We interpret these differences in terms of (I) settlement location with respect to geographical positioning in terms of access to riverine wetlands and their resources and (2) their association with areas of developing sociopolitical power structures.

the southern Veracruz lowlands, approximately 9 km southeast of San Lorenzo (Figure 1). We report these data and provide a quantitative comparison with data from the Early and Middle Formative occupations of La Joya and Tres Zapotes (Peres et al. 2010; VanDerwarker 2006, 2012). 
We frame our analysis within the context of early research that posited a maize-based farming econ­omy as the basis for the development of social com­plexity among the Early Formative Olmec (e.g., Coe and Diehl 1980; Heizer 1962, 1971; Velson and Clark 1975) and more recent research that argues for a mixed subsistence economy focused around aquatic resources, with maize becoming a funda­mental part of the diet only in the last stages of the Early Formative period (Arnold 2009; Borstein 2001). Ultimately, our analysis suggests that maize production and consumption during the Early and Middle Formative periods correlate more closely with proximity to centers of developing sociopolit­ical power than to ecological positioning or to the chronological displacement of natural resource pro­curement strategies by maize agriculture, as would be predicted by Arnold's and Borstein's proposals. 
Given the limited data sets at our disposal, however, we cannot at this time discount the possibility of changing economic strategies playing an important role in the major population shifts from the latter part of the Early Formative through the Middle For­mative periods, as noted by these authors. Never­theless, we provide a starting point for modeling regional plant subsistence that can be tested as new data are published. 
Farming in the Early and Middle Formative Olmec Heartland 
Early discussion of Olmec subsistence revolved around the importance of maize in both the devel­opment of social inequality and a burgeoning trib­ute-based political economy. Maize was the cornerstone of Coe 's (1981; see also Coe and Diehl 1980) levee land hypothesis, which posits that lead­ers rose to power because their control over prime agricultural river-bottom lands allowed them to produce greater surpluses in a form of ecological niche dominance. These surpluses would have then been funneled up to the leadership centered at San

Lorenzo and La Venta, who would have invested them in the construction of temples and monu­ments (Heizer 1962, 197 1 ; see also Velson and Clark 1975). Implicit in this scenario is the idea that maize constituted the basis for daily food ways ­if maize was only a supplementary resource, then it could hardly be a causal factor in social inequal­ity or the primary currency for tribute-based labor projects, at least not in the way proposed above. 
Recently, Arnold (2009) and Borstein (2001) have questioned the farming assumption of Coe's levee land hypothesis, noting that Early Formative populations first settled the lowland riverine/allu­vial areas less suitable for open-field maize agri­culture and rose to prominence not because of the land's potential for farming but, instead, because of the prime access those locations afforded for the continuous exploitation of abundant aquatic food sources. Arnold (2009) notes a major shift in set­tlement patterns from aquatic riverine environ­ments toward upland settings more suitable for early maize agriculture near the end of the Early Formative period in several regional studies in the Coatzacoalcos River basin (Borstein 2001; Kruger 1996; Symonds et al. 2002). He therefore argues that maize did not play a prominent dietary role until at least the San Lorenzo B phase, at which time maize passed a productivity threshold that would have warranted increased production (see also Borstein 2001; Kirkby 1973; Rust and Ley­den 1994). Thus, much or most of the Early For­mative period would have been characterized by a highly mixed subsistence economy marked by min­imal maize dependence (e.g., small-scale horticul­ture), followed by a shift toward a greater focus on dry land farming ca. 1000-900 B .C. If Arnold's the­sis is correct, then competition for highly produc­tive maize agricultural levee lands could not have played the primary causal role in the initial devel­opment of social inequality and political complex­ity in the region. 
Recent investigations in the Soconusco region of Chiapas have indicated a similar pattern of socioeconomic development there during the Early Formative to early Middle Formative periods. While maize was clearly being cultivated by the beginning of the Early Formative, multiple lines of evidence such as macrobotanical remains, stable carbon iso­tope analysis of human bone, settlement pattern data, and artifact assemblages strongly point to an economy based primarily on the exploitation of local natural resources with only secondary use of domesticated crops through most of the Early For­mative period (Blake et al. 1992; Clark and Blake 1994; Clark et al. 2007; Rosenswig 2006). Not until the early Middle Formative Conchas phase did maize agriculture become a fundamental part in some (but apparently not all) geographical regions of the Soconusco. Thus, subsistence strategy pat­terns now being described for the Gulf Coast Olmec region during the Early to Middle Formative peri­ods seem to be part of a much larger trend through­out the early Mesoamerican coastal tropics. 
Ultimately, understanding the role that maize played in the development of regional political complexity along the Gulf Coast requires that we have sufficient botanical and other supporting archaeological data from occupations dating to con­secutive phases during the Early Formative period (Ojochi, Bajfo, San Lorenzo A, and San Lorenzo B), in addition to subsequent Middle Formative sites. Until recently, it has not been possible to ade­quately test these hypotheses with direct botanical data. Indeed, such botanical data are still limited, but the state of archaeobotanical research in the region has nevertheless advanced to the point where we can make preliminary quantitative comparisons between sites and temporal periods. That being said, we still lack published macrobotanical data from lowland sites that can be attributed to specific chronological phases within the Early Formative period (but see our discussion of Tres Zapotes below). This is absolutely crucial as the debate regarding the timing of maize reliance hinges on whether farming became a significant subsistence activity during the first or second half of the Early Formative period. Nevertheless, we can come closer to addressing this issue by beginning to doc­ument broader regional and temporal variability in plant subsistence during the Early and Middle For­mative periods. To this end, we begin by review­ing the scant data that have been published in the broader Gulf Coast Olmec heartland. 
Rust and Leyden (1994) offered the very first analysis of botanical data in the region, focusing on maize pollen and maize macrobotanical frag­ments. Their findings show an increasing density of maize fragments (kernels and cu pules) from the Early to Middle Formative periods at La Venta. A more recent discussion of maize in the La Venta

settlement system by Rust (2008) reports kernel and cupule measurements, observing an increase in kernel size from the Early to Middle Forma­tive periods (see also Rust and Leyden 1994). Although the published plant data from La Venta and its surrounding region are minimal (but see Pohl et al. 2007), the patterns of increasing maize density and kernel size suggest a change in maize during the Early/Middle Formative transition that made it more productive. This pattern may sug­gest that maize did not become a significant or primary resource until the Middle Formative period. Another possibility, however, is that increased maize production occurred in a stepwise fashion, with several sequential production increases throughout the Early and Middle For­mative periods. 
Unfortunately, the only published botanical data from San Lorenzo are from Zurita-Noguera's (1997) phytolith study, which simply confirms the presence of maize at the site. Thus, we know that Early Formative residents of San Lorenzo were growing and eating maize, but we do not know the importance of maize relative to other foods. More recently, Wendt (2005) documents the presence of maize phytoliths from the site El Remolino, an Early Formative (San Lorenzo phase) village situ­ated about 5 km north of San Lorenzo. He reports fairly low ubiquity values for maize, as it was only positively identified in two of 13 samples. 
Published analyses of macrobotanical remains from Early and Middle Formative contexts include data from La Joya and Tres Zapotes (Peres et al. 2010; VanDerwarker 2006, 2012). Located approx­imately 60 km northwest of San Lorenzo in the neighboring Sierra de los Tuxtlas, La Joya repre­sents a multicomponent village with a maximum extension of around 20 ha, located in the Upper Catemaco River valley at an altitude of approxi­mately 200 m asl (Arnold 1999, 2000, 2003). The Early Formative period spans several phases (Tulipan [ 1300-1150 B .C.], Coyame A [ 1150-1000 B.C.],andCoyameB [1000-850B.C.]), which cor­respond to the Ojochi-Ba jfo and San Lorenzo A and B phases at San Lorenzo. Arnold argues that occu­pation at La Joya was probably seasonal during the Early Formative period but became increasingly sedentary by the Middle Formative. The closest Olmec center to La Joya during the Early Forma­tive would have been Laguna de los Cerros, some 33 km to the south, though it probably had little influence on this small and mobile community. 
Tres Zapotes is situated approximately 30 km from La Joya in the lowlands just beyond the west­ern foothills of the Tuxtlas and is well known as a Late/Terminal Formative political center-but this site was also inhabited during the Early and Mid­dle Formative periods, with the latter occupation fairly substantial in size (Pool 2000, 2007; Pool and Ortiz Ceballos 2008; Pool et al. 2010). The Early Formative occupation at Tres Zapotes corresponds with the San Lorenzo B phase and represents the period during which Arnold (2009) argues that maize production would have increased. Unfortu­nately, evidence of this early occupation at Tres Zapotes is deeply buried below later occupations and volcanic ash deposits, making the extent and scale of this settlement difficult to determine. Pool reports evidence for Early Formative Arroyo phase settlement distributed across several sections of the site, with an estimated size of between 7.5 and 17 ha -though we cannot currently rule out a larger population there, now hidden under meters of allu­vium and later occupational deposition. Some researchers have suggested that the two colossal heads found at the site (monuments A and Q) belong to the Early Formative occupation (Clewlow 1974:26, 28; Drucker 1981:39-40; Lowe 1989:43, 51), though Pool (2007:249-251, 2010; Pool and Ortiz Ceballos 2008; Pool et al. 2010) believes that they more likely date to the beginning of the Middle Formative period. Sev­eral settlement pattern surveys in nearby areas of the eastern lowland Papaloapan River basin paint a general picture of scattered villages and hamlets, most of them no larger than a couple of hectares in size across the landscape during the Early and Middle Formative periods (Kruszczynski 200 l; Leon Perez 2003; Loughlin 2004; summarized in Pool et al. 2010; see also Loughlin 2012). There­fore, while Tres Zapotes was most certainly not a major Olmec center on the scale of San Lorenzo during the Early Formative period, it probably did dominate a substantial portion of the sociopoliti­cal landscape within the eastern lowland Papaloa­pan River basin at the time. 
The most abundant macrobotanical species identified at both La Joya and Tres Zapotes include maize, bean, coyol, avocado, and sapote, with maize being the most abundant and ubiquitous

taxon during all periods. Indeed, it appears that maize was a significant crop during the latter part of the Early Formative period in both of these upland and lowland settings, a fact that stands in contrast to interpretations drawn from phytolith studies in the wide alluvial floodplains around San Lorenzo (Wendt 2005; Zurita-Noguera 1997). That being said, it is difficult to assess the relative impor­tance of maize among these sites without a direct quantitative comparison. Moreover, the original analysis of the La Joya plants included very few samples from Middle Formative features because there were very few features dating to that com­ponent. Fortunately, recent analysis of column sam­ples from nonfeature contexts has allowed us to increase the Middle Formative sample at La Joya by a factor of six; these revised data will be pre­sented as part of our comparative analysis. 
Various studies from San Andres, a site located in the La Venta settlement system in neighboring Tabasco, have recently expanded our knowledge of regional plant foodways during the Early and Middle Formative periods. Although macrobotan­ical analyses are still forthcoming from the San Andres project (but see Lentz et al. 2008), recent microbotanical studies have yielded interesting results (Pohl et al. 2007; Seinfeld 2007; Seinfeld et al. 2009). Pohl et al.'s (2007) analysis of phy­toliths and Pope et al.'s (2001) analysis of pollen from sediment samples near San Andres have allowed for the documentation of maize in the region by 7 ,000 years ago, in domesticated form. Maize has also been identified from residues extracted from pottery vessels from Middle For­mative ritual contexts at San Andres (Seinfeld 2007; Seinfeld et al. 2009). Interestingly, fancy serving wares have elevated evidence of maize residue in comparison with utility wares; this finding leads Seinfeld (2007:81; Seinfeld et al. 2009; see also Smalley and Blake 2003) to conclude that serving vessels were used to serve maize beverages. More recent evidence from San Lorenzo reveals the pres­ence of cacao (theobromine) residues in a variety of vessel types from an elite mortuary context (Powis et al. 2011). Thus it appears that special events in the Olmec world called for the con­sumption of both maize and cacao beverages. Indeed, the cacao study is particularly significant as cacao has yet to be documented in macrobotan­ical form in the region. 
The addition of the San Carlos macrobotanical analysis to this growing body of ancient plant data in the Olmec heartland fills a significant gap in our knowledge of everyday, nonelite plant foodways in a lowland, riverine setting. The plant data from sites in the vicinity of the Tuxtlas suggest that the importance of maize varied widely between dif­ferent ecozones and site types during both the Early and the Middle Formative periods, though it is unclear if maize reliance was stable or increased during this time. A comparison of the San Carlos macrobotanical data with those from Early /Middle Formative La Joya and Tres Zapotes will allow us to document plant subsistence in these different environments, which will bring us closer to under­standing broader variation in subsistence strate­gies. Indeed, it is important to keep in mind that southern coastal Veracruz is not a homogeneous environment (Arnold 2009; Grove 1994; Pool 2007). Below we provide relevant background information on the site of San Carlos, field meth­ods for the collection of flotation samples, and lab­oratory methods for the sorting/identification of carbonized macrobotanical fragments. We then report the San Carlos plant data, followed by a comparative quantitative analysis that includes data from La Joya and Tres Zapotes. 
Materials and Methods 
The site of San Carlos is located midway between the sites of San Lorenzo and El Manati, approxi­mately 9 km from each. The site sits atop a wide gravel elevation at the southern edge of the Coatza­coalcos River floodplain; at present, the river chan­nel is about a kilometer west of the site, but a large paleochannel of the river dating to before the end of the Early Formative period skirts the northern edge of the gravel elevation (Kruger 1997). The site was originally identified during Kruger's (1996) archaeological survey of the region; a modem gravel pit was in the process of being mined for gravel when Kruger discovered evidence of archae­ological features and artifacts in the exposed pro­file. In order to mitigate damage to the site and assess the extent of the occupation, Kruger (2000a, 2000b) conducted fieldwork in three stages. First, the profile wall of the gravel pit was cleaned, exam­ined, and mapped, producing a 53-m-long profile drawing (Figure 2). Second, the site was auger-

tested by placing 167 auger probes ( 10 cm in diam­eter) at 5-m intervals across a 30-x-60-m grid; in areas of high artifact concentration, probes were placed at 2.5-m intervals (Figure 3). Finally, nine excavation units of varying sizes were opened up across the site (see Figure 3), and all features that were encountered were excavated, with flotation samples taken for botanical recovery. Flotation samples were also periodically taken from general (nonfeature) excavation levels. Analysis of the ceramic assemblage from excavation contexts reveals that the timing of the main occupation at San Carlos straddles the end of the Early Forma­tive and beginning of the Middle Formative peri­ods. A single radiocarbon date from these contexts yielded an uncalibrated date of 2920 ± 40 B .P. (GX#25529-AMS), giving a calibrated single­sigma range of 1128 ± 70 B .C. A light Early Post­classic occupation detected on the western side of the study area slightly impacted some areas of the Formative remains. 
Investigations at San Carlos documented a rel­atively simple stratigraphic profile with a single Formative period horizon (see Figure 2). The occu­pation of the site appears to consist of a single household unit of relatively short duration, oriented with the main structure or structures in the west­ern section of the site (Kruger 2000a, 2000b, 2006). While no structure floors were identified, a section of a burned and collapsed wattle-and-daub wall was excavated (see Figure 2). Directly east of this spot was an open area approximately 10 m across. 
While auger testing showed this area to be gener­ally clear of debris (probably from sweeping or other cleaning activities), several features, includ­ing trash pits, stone pavements, and earth ovens or fire pits, were located within this vicinity, sug­gesting that this was an area of high activity. Far­ther to the east and north, auger testing revealed a zone of discard and specialized activities, where concentrations of both ceramics and burnt clay were found. Excavations within this zone uncov­ered a series of shallow elongated fire pits con­taining high levels of carbonized wood and small pieces of burnt clay. While the function of these fire pits is not clear, they do represent a repeated activity at the site and were probably placed well away from the structure(s) to avoid accidental fires, and perhaps smoke, within the main living areas. These features may have contributed a larger amount of carbonized wood to the collected flota­tion samples than might have been present in sam­ples taken from other contexts or from the other sites considered in this study. 
The ceramics from this short occupation have traits associated with both the Early Formative San Lorenzo B phase (e.g., Tatagapa Red, Yagua Orange) and the Middle Formative Nacaste phase (e.g., everted rims with double-line break patterns) as described by Coe and Diehl ( 1980: 159-200) for San Lorenzo, indicating that this occupation occurred during a gradual transition between these two ceramic phases. The ceramic assemblage was dominated by tecomates, almost exclusively of

coarser wares, and open plates and bowls made of 
a fine to medium sand temper. Bowls and plates var­
ied greatly in diameter, from small individual-sized 
vessels with diameters as small as 8 cm to large serv­
ing or communal vessels with diameters greater 
than 40 cm. While heavy erosion often precluded 
the preservation of ceramic surfaces, several small, 
straight-walled serving bowls with fancy decora­
tions were recovered, indicating that this rural 
household did have access to, and rights to, the use 
of more elaborate ceramics and, perhaps, their asso­
ciated iconography (Figure 4) (Kruger 2006). 
A total of 95 flotation samples were taken dur­
ing excavations, from both feature contexts and 
general (nonfeature) excavation levels. Of these 
samples, 42 derive from 15 features including trash 
and fire pits, stone pavements, material dumps, and 
a collapsed wattle-and-daub wall, and 53 come 
from nonfeature contexts consisting of general 
excavation layers. We restrict our analysis to sam­ples that fall clearly within the Formative occupa­tion of the site (n = 79). Flotation samples were 
collected as 4-liter soil samples and floated at the University of Veracruz campus by emptying the soil samples into a fine-meshed plastic window screen suspended within a large barrel of water. The water was carefully agitated by hand until the soil passed through the lower screen; all floating organic mate­rial was captured by a fine-meshed strainer. All material too large to pass through the window screen was saved as a heavy fraction and sorted for organic material and artifacts. 
Laboratory Procedures 
All materials from both light and heavy fractions were sorted, identified, and combined for reporting and analysis. All samples were weighed and then sifted through 2.0-mm, 1.4-mm, and .7-mm geo­logical sieves. Carbonized plant remains were sorted in entirety down to the .7-mm sieve size with the help of a stereoscopic microscope (10-40x). Residue less than .7 mm in size was scanned only 

for seeds, which were removed and counted. While most archaeobotanical analyses do not usually iden-

tify plant taxa beyond the 1.4-rnm or 2.0-mm sieve sizes, many of the maize kernel and cupule frag­ments identified in the samples were smaller than these sieve sizes. Data from La Joya and Tres Zapotes were collected using the same methods, which makes quantitative comparisons possible. 
Modem botanical guides were used to determine the natural ranges for plants identified in the assem­blages (Ibarra Manriquez and Sinaga Colin 1987; Soriano et al. 1997); the serial journal Flora de Ve­racruz was extremely helpful in this pursuit. Iden­tifications were made with reference to modem comparative specimens housed in the paleoeth­nobotanical laboratory at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill. Together, we collected most of the relevant comparative specimens during a plant collection trip to southern Veracruz in May 2000. Several specimens were also sent to Dr. Lee Newsom at the Pennsylvania State University for identification. All plant specimens common in the assemblages were identified to the lowest possible taxonomic level. Once they were sorted and iden­tified, analysis of plant specimens included the recording of counts, weights (in grams), portion of plant (e.g., maize kernels vs. cupules), whether or not the specimen was carbonized, provenience, and

volume of soil floated. Wood was weighed but not counted, and no wood analysis was conducted. Generally, seeds were counted but not weighed. Larger palm seeds and avocado pits were identi­fied only as fragments and were thus counted and weighed. Other than counts and weights, no other measurements were taken on any specimens. Nearly all maize kernels were too fragmentary either to obtain length or width measurements or to determine variety. Although a few cob fragments were identified, they came from a Post-Classic period context and were too fragmentary to deter­mine number of rows, thus prohibiting additional observations regarding variety. 
Quantitative methods in archaeobotany have 
developed significantly over the past several 
decades and, as a result, have been a subject of 
much critical discussion (Hastorf and Popper 1988; 
VanDerwarker and Peres 2010). The most common 

measures for recording and quantifying plant remains are counts and weights. When deciding on basic measurements, it is important to choose those most appropriate to the taxa we intend to summa­rize. For example, we use counts as our basic mea­sure because many of the specimens from San Carlos are too small to yield appreciable weights. In terms of the data considered here, specimen weights would not be as useful an analytical mea­sure as specimen counts. 
Methods of Quantification 


Beyond the recording of counts and weights, we quantify our data using several measures, includ­ing ubiquity, density, and standardized counts. Ubiquity analysis is essentially a presence/absence analysis that measures the frequency of occurrence (Godwin 1956; Hubbard 1975, 1976, 1980; Pop­per 1988; Willcox 1974). Ubiquity measures are calculated as a percentage of the number of sam­ples in which a taxon was identified in reference to the total number of samples (Popper 1988). For example, if avocado is present in four out of IO sam­ples, then its ubiquity value is 40 percent. Because different types of plants are disposed of differently, absolute comparisons of ubiquity values between taxa are problematic (Hubbard 1980:53). For exam­ple, a 70 percent ubiquity value for avocado pits would not be equivalent to a 70 percent ubiquity value for beans, as these categories are not directly comparable-avocado pits represent a processing 
by-product often used as fuel, while beans repre­
sent edible portions. 
As with any quantitative measure, ubiquity 
analysis has its disadvantages. A sufficient number 
of samples is necessary to provide meaningful 
results, as using too few samples creates a high like­
lihood of sampling error. Hubbard ( 1976:260) sug­
gests a minimum of 10 samples. Moreover, 
although ubiquity analysis may mitigate for preser­
vation biases, it is not immune to them (Hubbard 
1980:53; Scarry 1986:193). Most importantly, 
because ubiquity deals with occurrence frequency 
and not abundance, it can potentially obscure pat­
terns where occurrence frequency does not change 
but abundance does (Scarry I 986). As Scarry 
(1986: 193) notes, "The frequency with which a 
resource is used may remain constant, while the 
quantity used varies." For example, a family may 
consistently eat maize on a daily basis, but the 
quantity they consume may vary from day to day. 

Despite these weaknesses, ubiquity analysis is a 
good starting point and can provide meaningful results when used alongside other measures. 
In order to assess relative abundance of plants, we use density measures, standardized counts, and mean counts. Density measures standardize data in terms of soil volume-the absolute count or weight of carbonized plant material (for individ­ual taxa or for larger collapsed categories, e.g., maize kernels or maize) is divided by total soil vol­ume for each sample or summed and reported for the site as a whole. Density measures calculate the abundance of plants per liter of soil, and it is gen­erally assumed that larger volumes of soil will yield more plant remains. However, differences in the context and manner of deposition between soil samples structure the relationship between soil volume and the size of the plant assemblage. For example, a 10-liter soil sample from an intact house floor would probably yield a smaller sam­ple of carbonized plant remains than a 10-liter soil sample from a refuse midden, because people tend to keep their houses cleaner than their trash dumps. Thus, density measures tend to reflect spatial pat­terns regarding the organization and layout of activities, differential occupation intensity, and the intensity of fire-related activities (Miller 1988; Scarry 1986). 
While standardizing plant data by soil volume provides valuable information regarding relative

abundance as it relates to contextual and deposi­tional differences between samples, it can obfus­cate overall relative abundance (Scarry 1986: 195). In other words, if the analyst is interested in deter­mining the importance of maize relative to the other plants in a specific sample or context, then density measures may be inadequate. Rather, standardiz­ing by plant weight might be more appropriate­we refer to this measure as a standardized count (Scarry 1986). As a quantitative category, plant weight is a sum of weights recorded for all car­bonized plant specimens per sample or context. Thus, for each sample, there is a total weight of plant material -this figure is the denominator used to standardize the variable of interest. So, if we are interested in questions regarding the relative dietary contributions of different plants as opposed to the intensity of use, then plant weight may be a more suitable standardizer. 
Finally, we also calculate a measure we refer to as mean counts; this index is calculated as the total maize per site/period divided by the total number

of samples in which plants were identified in that site/period. With respect to the regional maize com­parison, we use these multiple independent mea­sures as a means to more confidently assess patterning in the data. 
Results 
We begin by presenting the San Carlos data and discussing the relevant uses of the plants identified in the assemblage (Table 1). The most abundant plant foods identified in the San Carlos assemblage are maize and sapote, although coyol fragments are also fairly abundant. We group maize and beans together as field crops, though whether the beans were intercropped with maize in the fields is uncer­tain. While intercropping beans with maize would have provided benefits to both plants through nitro­gen fixation (Giller 2001), beans may also have been grown in smaller garden plots near the habi­tation. Moreover, while maize fragments were numerous in the samples, few bean specimens were

identified-those beans that were identified could not be identified beyond the level of genus (Phase­olus sp.). 
Tree resources also appear to have contributed significantly to the Formative diet at San Carlos. Seed fragments from sapote (Pouteria sapote), avo­cado (Persea americana), coyol (Acrocomia mex­icana), and coyol real (Schee/ea liebmannii) fruits were all identified at the site. The frequency with which sapote fragments were identified in the assemblage speaks to its importance as a food resource at the site. In addition to the edible fresh fruit (which is generally eaten by hand), the seed from the sapote fruit has a variety of uses. In mod­em times, the seed is sometimes boiled, roasted, and mixed with cacao for making chocolate or mixed with cornmeal, sugar (or honey), and cin­namon to make a drink called pozol (Balerdi et al. 1996:8; Morton 1987:401). The seeds also yield a white oily substance that has been used in foods, soaps, and cosmetics and to fix colors on painted gourds (Morton 1987:401). This seed oil also has a variety of medicinal uses, including use as a skin ointment, a hair dressing (for hair growth), an eye/ear ointment, and a remedy for coronary prob­lems (Morton 1987:401). 
Coyol palm fruits also appear to have con­tributed to the diet-these fruits likely provided an important source of oil for cooking and other tasks. Use of this palm has been documented for groups throughout Mexico and Central America (Lentz 1990). Coyol fruits are high in fat, protein, and caloric value (Lentz 1990:189). Coyol can be used for a variety of purposes, including food, medicine, and wine production (Balick 1990; Greller 2000; Henderson et al. 1995; Lentz 1990; Quero 1992). The fruit itself is edible and is used to prepare sweet dishes (Quero 1992:32). Oil can also be extracted from the endosperm for use in cooking and hair tonics (Henderson et al. 1995: 166). Ethnographically documented medic­inal uses include cooking the fruits for remedies for colic and diabetes (Quero 1992:32). Moreover, coyol tree trunks can be used in construction, and palm fronds may be used for thatching and weav­ing (Greller 2000:74). While it is the fruit of the coyol that is an ingredient in foods and medicines, wine can be produced from the sap of felled trees (Balick 1990:86; Quero 1992:32). Fruits can be gathered and returned to camp for processing, but sap is gathered at the tree stands. The process of "cracking" coyol fruits results in broken fragments of the hard outer pericarp, which, if carbonized, may preserve archaeologically. Coyol tree sap, however, will not be preserved archaeologically, and thus, coyol wine production is less likely to yield an archaeological signature. 

Avocado is represented in the samples by a sin­gle specimen, suggesting its relative unimportance. Nevertheless, avocado fruits are high in nutritional value, boasting the highest fiber content of any fruit. They are a source of antioxidants, and the oil is rich in vitamins A, B, C, and E and essential amino acids (Morton 1987: 100; Nakasone and Paull 1998:99). Roots and seeds from the plant contain an antibiotic that prevents the spoilage of food by bacteria (Morton 1987: IOI). For this rea­son, avocado plants have also been used for a wide variety of medicinal purposes. Because of the antibiotic quality of the fruit skin, leaves, and seeds, these portions of the plant have been used to pre­pare treatments for dysentery, diarrhea, sore throats, hemorrhages, menstrual cramps, dandruff, toothaches, and other wounds (California Rare Fruit Growers, Inc. 1996:4; Morton 1987: 102). 
Other fruits identified include a possible coco plum specimen ( Chrysobalanus icaco) and coyol real (Scheelea liebmannii). The coco plum was likely important for its edible fruit (Heywood 1993: 148; Newsom and Pearsall 2003). Coyol real is a large palm tree that produces hard and fibrous fruits, yielding one to three oily seeds (Mason and Mason 1987 :268). Like the coyol (Acrocomia mex­icana), the coyol real is a valuable source of veg­etable oil (Mason and Mason 1987:268). Moreover, the palm leaves can be used for thatching. 

Other taxa identified at San Carlos include achiote (Bixa orellana), a possible evening prim­rose specimen ( Oenothera sp. cf.), a possible spec­imen from the spiderwort family (Forrestia sp. cf.), and a trianthema seed (Trianthema sp.). Achiote is a shrub or tree that grows well in secondary vege­tation and is sometimes grown in gardens (Coe and Diehl 1980; Newsom 1993).Achiote seeds can be used as both a food coloring/dye and a seasoning (Coe and Diehl 1980:159; Heywood 1993: 105-106; Newsom 1993). Evening primrose and Forrestia may have been cultivated as orna­mental and/or edible garden plants (Heywood 1993:162, 279; Newsom 1993). The entire evening

In addition, Oenothera seeds are a source of trypto­phan, an amino acid that acts as a mild sedative (Newsom 1993:140). Trianthema is an herb that grows well along the borders of secondary growth-it can either grow wild or be cultivated in gardens (Newsom 1993; Rico-Gray 1979). In modem times, trianthema is sometimes used as fodder for pigs (Rico-Gray 1979: 13), but it proba­bly served as a seasoning in prehistoric times. 
Quantitative Analysis 
The counts of plant remains identified in the San Carlos samples indicate that maize and sapote were the primary plant foods consumed, at least in terms of raw abundance (see Table 1). This pattern is also demonstrated through ubiquity values, which reveal that maize and sapote also occur in the high­est number of samples (with the exception of wood, which is present in 100 percent of samples); after wood, maize is the most ubiquitous (65 percent), followed closely by sapote (47 percent; Table 2). The next most ubiquitous plant is coyol, but with a value of 11 percent, it has a significantly lower frequency of occurrence. 
A consideration of the density measures of wood and non wood plant materials from both feature and nonfeature contexts reveals differences in the dis­posal of plant food refuse at the site (Figure 5; see also Table 3). We display these density measures as box plots, which summarize distributions of data using several key features. The median or center value of the distribution is marked by the area of maximum constriction at the center ofthe box. The edges of the box, or hinges, represent the twenty­fifth and seventy-fifth percentiles of the distribution -the approximate middle 50 percent of the data fall between the hinges (Cleveland test for statistical differences between distributions through a comparison of the notched areas that ,' 


characterize the 95 percent confidence interval around the median. The notches are recognizable in that they give the box plot a characteristic hour­glass shape. If the notches of any two box plots do not overlap, then the medians of the two distribu­tions are significantly different at about the .05 level (McGill et al. 1978:14; Scarry and Stepon­aitis 1997: 113; Wilkinson et al. 1992: 198). 
Our box plots reveal different patterns for wood and nonwood plant remains (see Figure 5). While there is no difference in the abundance of wood in features vs. nonfeature contexts, the difference for nonwood plants is statistically significant, with fea­tures yielding more non wood plant refuse than gen­eral nonfeature contexts. The lack of difference in wood deposition is not surprising, as it is ubiqui­tous across the site during this period. Moreover, wood is used for a variety of purposes, and hearth fires would have been used for more than simple food preparation. The majority of nonwood plants are food resources, primarily maize and sapote. Maize was likely carbonized as a result of cooking accidents, and sapote seeds were likely thrown into hearth fires deliberately as an added fuel source after the outer fruit was consumed. The higher den­sity of these food remains in features indicates that an effort was made to dispose of organic food trash in discrete contexts-an effort that was not made for carbonized wood. 
In order to understand the relative importance of maize in the San Carlos diet, we make compar­isons with published data from Early and Middle Formative plant assemblages from La Joya and Tres Zapotes (see Peres et al. 2010; VanDerwarker 2006, 2012). The macro botanical data sets from La Joya and Tres Zapotes are comparable in the sense that the data were collected in the same manner and analyzed by VanDerwarker (2006, 2012) using the same methods. In addition to the published La Joya
