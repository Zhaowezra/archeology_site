WARFARE, GENDER, AND SACRIFICE IN JEQUETEPEQUE, PERU 
Edward Swenson 
Archaeological data from the Jequetepeque Valley suggest that Late Moche warfare and religious sacrifice were embedded in a particular cosmological and gendered construction of the world. As a consequence, the pragmatic motives implicated in violent conflict were mediated by structures of practice specific to the Moche. An analysis of the archaeological record points to the existence of this cultural schema, the identification of which better explains the ascendancy of the famed priest­ess cult based at San Jose de Moro and the general decentralization of power in the Jequetepeque region. The evidence indicates that political relations in the valley were informed by a religious ideology that structured feasting, warfare, and sacrifice as specifically gendered but complementary domains. The spatial delimitation and sequential unfolding of ritual events were likely deemed essential for both socio-cosmic renewal and legitimate political advancement. This gendering of political and religious practices is reflected archaeologically in the division of centered and rural space and in the differ­
ential distribution of architectural forms, parochial feasting arenas, and iconographically charged artifacts. Ultimately, the archaeological record demonstrates that the political machinations of rural communities amplified this gendered sac­rificial system within the context of the environmental upheavals of the Late Moc he Period. 
Los datos arqueologicos del Valle de Jequetepeque sugieren que durante el periodo Moche Tardio la guerra y el sacrificio religioso fueron incorporados en una cosmologia particular de la complementariedad de los sexos. Como consecuencia, los motivos pragmdticos en conflictos violentosfueron mediados por las estructuras de prdcticas especificamente moche. Un andli­sis hermeneutico del registro arqueologico apunta a la existencia de este esquema cultural, datos que pueden explicar la ascen­dencia del culto de la famosa sacerdotisa en San Jose de Moro y la descentralizacion general del poder en la region de Jequetepeque. Las evidencias indican que las relaciones politicas en el valle fueron informadas por una ideologia religiosa que estructuraba festines, guerra y sacrificios como dominios masculinos y femeninos distintos pero complementarios. La delimitacion espacial y el secuencial despliegue de los eventos rituales probablemente estuvieron relacionados con la reno­vacion sociocosmica y el legftimo adelanto politico. Esta vinculacion a genero de las prdcticas religiosas y politicas se refleja arqueologicamente en la division de espacios centralizados y rurales, yen la diferenciada distribucion de formas arquitec­tonicas, arenas festivas parroquiales, y la iconograffa representada en artefactos. Por ultimo, el registro arqueologico demues­tra que las maquinaciones polfticas de las comunidades rurales ampliaron este sistema sacrificial dentro del contexto de trastornos medioambientales del periodo Moche Tardio. 

rchaeologists have long recognized that Aviolence secured a central place in Moche political and religious culture. However, there is considerable disagreement on the varying roles played by militarism, state coercion, and sanc­tified homicide in the structuring of Moche power relations (Alva and Donnan 1993; Bourget 200 l, 2006; Castillo 2000a; Donnan 1978, 1997, 2001; Quilter 2002, 2008; Shimada 1994; Sutter and Cortez 2005; Topic and Topic 1997, 2009; Uceda 2008; Verano 1998,2001 ,2008; Willey 1953; Wil­son 1988). This critical issue will defy elucidation if the debate continues to be defined in terms of whether Moche warfare was primarily "ritualistic" or "secular" in nature. In truth, this is a false dichotomy that betrays a Western cultural sensi­bility (see Nielson 2009:242; Topic and Topic 2009:27). Just as many ethnographers have repu­diated the purported universality of the sacred and the profane (Bruck 1999; Goody 1977; Quilter 2008:226), the archaeological and iconographic data strongly suggest that Moche communities made little distinction between the religious and pragmatic dimensions of violent confrontations (Topic and Topic 2009). Indeed, arguments that Moche warfare was shaped exclusively by the

unvarnished political or economic needs of the actors in question completely disregards the unique cultural context of Moc he conflict and fails to rec­ognize that practical rationality and regimes of practice exist in the plural and are largely the prod­uct of the values and expectations of historically specific ideological traditions (Nielsen and Walker 2009; Pauketat 2009; Topic and Topic 2009). Fore­grounding the "secular" aspects of Moche mili­tarism as an institution devised solely to aggrandize power and secure economic and political advan­tage even runs the risk of imposing a uniformitar­ian (Hobbesian) human nature onto culturally distinct societies, an interpretive move that inevitably downplays the likely theological and historical dimensions of Moche ritual violence. Despite increased attention to problems of agency in archaeological theory (Barrett 2000, 2001; Dobres and Robb 2000), more often than not, the motives and intentions of past subjects are reduced to neo-liberal inspired theories of the agent, where everyone past and present behaves like an invest­ment banker-the economizing and scarcity-driven 
"man" of indigenous Western anthropology, as crit­icized by Sahlins (1996a, 1996b) (see also Meskell 2001; Nielsen 2009:220; Nielsen and Walker 2009:6; Smith 2001). 
In this paper, I do not presume to resolve fun­damental ontological or philosophical questions concerning issues of power, structure, and agency. Instead, I adopt a practice-inspired and hermeneu­tic approach (Hodder and Hutson 2003; Swenson 2008) to demonstrate that violent political strug­gles in the Jequetepeque Valley were embedded in a peculiar cosmological and gendered construction of the world. The motives of varied agents involved in militarized conflicts were conditioned by widely shared ideological precepts, and speculation on agency must take into account these Moche struc­tures of practice. More specifically, I offer an inter­pretation of the archaeological evidence for warfare, feasting, and sacrifice in Late Moche Jequetepeque that can explain both the ascendancy of the famed priestess cult and the politically frag­mented nature of power relations in this region. 
More than 15 years of archaeological research directed by Luis Jaime Castillo Butters and students at San Jose de Moro in the Jequetepeque Valley have revealed that women, the famed "priestesses" interred in elaborate tombs, secured the highest 
positions of authority in the region during the Late Moche Period (A.D. 650-850) (Castillo 2000b, 2001, 2006, 2007, 20JO; Castillo and Donnan 1994a; Castillo and Rengifo 2008; Castillo et al. 2009; Donnan and Castillo 1994). Much of their power rested on their presumed direction of elab­orate spectacles of human sacrifice that constituted the heart of Moche political theology (Alva and Donnan 1993; Castillo 2006). Interpreting the archaeological data from the Jequetepeque coun­tryside, I suggest that the priestesses formed the lynchpin of a sacrificial cycle of political power legitimized by a dualistically gendered conception of social, agricultural, and cosmological repro­duction. Both ritual and pragmatic military cam­paigns contributed to the sacrificial program, and this overarching conceptual scheme shaped polit­ical and economic conflict in Jequetepeque. As a hypothesis that requires further testing, I contend that masculine-defined tournaments of festive hos­pitality and warfare, staged in the countryside, pre­ceded the feminine consecration (and possibly sacrifice) of warriors at San Jose de Moro. Male­dominated feasting rites and military contests pos­sibly were legitimized by bestowing war captives to the priestess, who symbolized a female force of death, metamorphosis, and renewal. Sacrificial rites or the reconciliation of warring parties in a decid­edly feminine forum possibly conferred new sta­tus on the victors and reconstituted the world socially, cosmically, and ultimately politically. Therefore, the evidence indicates that political rela­tions in the valley were informed by a religious ide­ology that structured feasting, warfare, and sacrifice as specifically gendered but complementary domains. The sexually defined dialectic under­writing the politics of sacrifice in Jequetepeque is reflected archaeologically in the division of cen­tered and rural space and in the patterned distribu­tion of architectural forms, parochial feasting arenas, and iconographically charged artifacts. Ulti­mately, the archaeological record reveals that the political machinations of rural communities, who appropriated the once exclusive religious author­ity of urban male elites, amplified this gendered sac­rificial system in the Late Moc he Period, thus elevating the prestige of the priestess cult. The Jequetepeque database demonstrates the futility of separating raw political intentions from the reli­gious and cultural matrix in which they were

embedded, and interpretation of Moche warfare demands consideration of the structures that enabled or constrained its realization. 
Women, Sacrifice, and Political Authority: 
General Theory and the Andean Context 

A number of social theorists contend that blood sac­rifice ritually engineers men's dominion over life in general and women in particular by securing ceremonial mastery over death and destruction. For instance, Jay ( 1992) observes that animal sacrifice is a male ritual prerogative cross-culturally, and she argues that blood sacrifice served to appropri­ate and subvert the reproductive power of women in patrilineal societies. Other anthropologists have argued that rites involving premeditated "killing, unlike child birth, grant men wilful control over the processes of nature, and in particular, over the nat­ural processes of life and death" (Rosaldo and Atkins 1975:70; see also Eilberg-Schwartz 1990:141-194; Valeri 1985). 
Even if one accepts the profound political impli­cations of sacrificial ritual as founded on a viscer­ally real dialectic of bodily transformation, women's participation in such rites and their sym­bolic association with sacrifice varied significantly in different cultures, as has been suggested by ethnographic, historic, and archaeological research (Bowen 1992; Hamoudi 1988; Sered 2002; Stone 1988). Although important cultural differences must be considered, positive female engagement in sacrificial rites appears particularly prevalent where ritual violence, viewed as a dialectical cat­alyst of empowerment, fertility, and regeneration, pivoted on reconciling life-forces defined dualis­tically as male and female (Arnold and Hastorf 2008:47-58; Hoskins 1996; McWilliam 1996: 147-148). Sacrificial cosmologies and ritual programs predicated on principles of gender com­plementarity have been documented in many regions of South America including the ancient Andes (Arnold and Hastorf 2008; Arnold and Yapita 2006; Conklin 1993; Ossio 1996, 2002; Platt 1986; Silverblatt 1987; Vogel 2003). 
It is in light of the creative power of blood sacrifice-as a vehicle of regeneration, fertility, and social renewal realized through the ritual inter­change of gendered elements-that I base my inter­pretation of the political authority of the priestesses 

of San Jose de Moro in Late Moche Jequetepeque (Topic and 1bpic 2009). However, this theoretical position constitutes simply a basis for analysis, and I avoid reducing Moche political ideologies to structuralist universals or lo andino historical frameworks by tacking strategically between gen­eral theory, historically documented Andean tradi­tions, and the Jequetepeque archaeological record. To be sure, archaeological and iconographic data strongly suggest that Moche belief systems can be understood in relationship to a historically dynamic "macro-tradition" (Topic and Topic 2009:22), a tongue duree of shared cosmological and social precepts specific to the Andean region; thus eth­nohistoric data on gender, sacrifice, and warfare provide both a useful springboard and analytical foil from which to interpret Moche-specific prac­tices and conceptual schemes. The Topics (2009), for instance .. have argued convincingly that artis­tic depictions ofMoche battle scenes closely resem­ble ethnographic accounts of ritual tinku battles of the Andean highlands. Others have commented on the ritualistic characteristics of Moche war clubs and iconographic representations of warfare more generally (Verano 2001). Furthermore, Moche political theology was grounded in a sacrificial and reciprocal ethos, also characteristic of later Andean cultures. Nevertheless, even though ritual perfor­mances in specifically gendered spaces structured political action in much of the Andean world, the archaeological landscape inJequetepeque points to historically distinct permutations of this larger tra­dition, an important argument of the article. 
The Priestesses of San Jose de Moro and the Moche Sacrifice Ceremony 
The visita of the early Spanish chronicler Don Cristobal Vaca de Castro (1541-1544) records the account of Inka quipucamayocs (keepers of the knotted ropes) that Andean coastal society was dis­tinguished by the presence of minor chiefs and rulers who were often women (called tallaponas or capullanas) (see Castillo and Rengifo 2008:27; Means 1931:84). Nearly 1,000 years earlier on the North Coast of Peru, the rich iconographic corpus of the Late Moche Period (A.D. 600-800) was characterized by a dramatic upsurge in the depic­tion of divine female figures, often referred to as Figure C or the Priestess Deity by Moche archae-

These feminine notables, clearly representing powerful supernaturals or their mortal impersonators, are most often associated with maritime subjects such as the crescent and tule boat theme and the spiral wave narrative-themes that became increasingly popular in the Late Moche Period (Castillo and Rengifo 2008; McClelland et al. 2007) (Figure 1) . The sacerdotal women are also commonly linked with portrayals of mortuary ritual and sacrificial rites (Castillo and Rengifo 2008) . In the earlier Middle Moche Period (A.D. 400-550), stylistically related to the Moche IV Period in the southern val­leys, this divine complex of females, though not as ubiquitous as in the Late Moche Period, also played an important role in the so-called Presentation Theme or Sacrifice Ceremony (Bawden 1996; Donnan 1978) . The principal religious narrative in Moche iconography, it was depicted on fine ceramic and metal objects and constituted an important subject of adobe murals discovered in the

main ceremonial precincts of great Moche temples such as Huaca de la Luna, Huaca El Brujo, and Paiiamarca (Franco et al. 1994; Swenson 2003; Uceda 2001a, 200lb; Uceda et al. 1994). The pro­tagonists of the Presentation Theme are important actors in other scenes that clearly make up an inte­grated mythological narrative (Quilter 1997). The Sacrifice Ceremony shows the fanged deity or his priestly avatar being presented a special goblet of human blood by a supporting troupe of three sub­sidiary deities (the bird priest, the priestess or female divinity, and the god with the serrated head­dress streamers) (Alva and Donnan 1993; Bawden 1996; Donnan I 978)(Figure 1 ). Naked warriors are shown in the margins having their throats cut by zoomorphic figures (who are collecting blood in goblets), and the Presentation Theme is commonly associated with scenes of warfare. The priestess with her characteristic plumed or tasseled headdress appears to be presenting a goblet of sacrificial blood to the main "Fanged" or "Rayed" deity of the 
Moche pantheon, as he has been variously denoted 
(Benson 1972; Donnan 1978; Donnan and McClel­
land 1979; Makowski 2000, 2003). The discovery by Luis Jaime Castillo and his team of seven elaborate tombs of elite women at the important site of San Jose de Moro in the lower JequetepequeValley, which date to different sub­phases of the Late Moche period, has revealed that these female supernaturals illustrated in Moche art were not simply mythical characters (Castillo 2006, 2010; Castillo et al. 2009; Castillo and Donnan 1994a; Castillo and Rengifo 2008; Donnan and Castillo 1994) (Figure 2). Rather, living women who possibly assumed divine or semi-divine sta­tus adopted the personae and performed the roles of these divinities. The headdresses, clothing, and attendant artifacts of the interred individuals closely resemble those of the aforementioned Figure C and her various incarnations as represented in Moche art. Other prominent figures of the Sacrifice Cere­mony have also been identified in elite North Coast tombs, including the spectacular burial of the war­rior priest at Sipan and more recently a female priestess at the site ofHuaca Cao Viejo in the Chi­cama Valley (Alva and Donnan 1993; Donnan 1992; Williams 2006). These burials date to the ear­lier Middle Moche Period. Significantly, the explo­sion of depictions of powerful women in Late Moche fineline ceramics, much of it thought to 

have been produced by craft specialists at San Jose de Moro, coincides with the foundation of the cult of the female supernatural based at this prominent Jequetepeque settlement (McClelland et al. 2007). The tombs of the priestesses represent not only the most extravagant interments for the Late Moche Period as a whole but also the richest female buri­als ever excavated in the New World (Castillo 2006, 2010; Castillo et al. 2009; Castillo and Donnan 1994a; Vogel 2003). 
San Jose de Moro was unquestionably an impor­tant ceremonial and mortuary center (see Castillo et al. 2009). This 10 ha site consists of a series of 14 low adobe mounds and public plazas, and it was a sacred burial ground as early as the Middle Moche Period. It continued to thrive as a central node of funerary rites into the later Transitional and Lam­bayeque eras (to roughly A.D. 1200) (Castillo 2000b, 2001, 2007; Castillo and Donnan 1994b:96). Interestingly, elite female interments also charac­terized these post-Moche periods (Castillo 2006). The three most prominent priestesses, interred in the vicinity of Huaca la Capilla and Huaca Chodoff, were buried in well-constructed adobe chamber tombs roughly 7 m below the ground surface (Castillo and Rengifo 2008). They were accompa­nied by sac1ificed attendants, most often females, and an array of copper masks and adornments, sil­ver body sheaths, spondylus shell, and numerous ceramic offerings. These offerings include fineline vessels and an even greater quantity of intermedi­ate and utilitarian wares. The strong associations with sacrifice are evident in the distinctive goblets and tumi knives interred with the priestesses, the characteristic plumed headdress of the buried elites worn by female divinities portrayed in the Moche Sacrifice Ceremony, the sacrificed burial attendants, and the prevalence of militaristic iconographic themes decorating their offerings (Castillo and Don­nan 1994a; Castillo and Rengifo 2008; Donnan and Castillo 1994). These themes include weapon bun­dles, supernatural warriors, and combat between divine figures wielding sacrificial tumi knives (McClelland et al. 2007). Moreover, representations of the Burial Theme common on Late Moche ceramics are suffused with sacrificial symbolism and violence (Donnan and McClelland 1979; McClelland et al. 2007). The prominent role played by female deities in this particular narrative, and the possibility that the coffin being buried in such depic-

corroborates this view (Castillo 2001, 2010). The female supernatural is also shown on ceramic art riding reed boats transporting captured warriors for sacrifice or jars that have been interpreted as con­taining sacrificial blood (Cordy-Collins 2001; Vogel 2003:123) (Figure 1). 
San Jose de Moro represented one of the pre­mier ceremonial centers of the Late Moc he Period, and it is likely that the priestesses were venerated by far-flung populations from both within and out­side the Jequetepeque Valley. Castillo (2000b: 148-149) argues that diverse communi­ties congregated at San Jose de Moro to partici­pate in coordinated religious festivities that entailed the large-scale production and consump­tion of chicha (com beer). He bases these inter­pretations on the discovery of a series of semi-subterranean adobe-lined chambers that were filled with the tools and ceramics needed to man­ufacture and ferment com beer (Castillo 2007:68). Feasting plazas, located between the platforms, have also been identified. As described below, sim­ilar banquets were among the most important rit­uals conducted at ceremonial sites in rural zones of the valley. The discovery of fine foreign ceram­ics interred with the female elites, including Wari, Niveria, and Cajamarca wares, further attests to the long-distance ties and political influence of the priestess cult (Castillo 2000b, 2001). 
Indeed, the Late Moche Period, beginning approximately A.D. 600-650, was a time of wide­spread social, ecological, and political change (Bawden 1996; Shimada 1994). Geoarchaeologi­cal data suggest that a combination of environ­mental factors, mainly severe droughts, El Nifio induced floods, and sand invasion, led to the col­lapse of the southern Moche state (or states) and drove settlement and agricultural reorganization throughout the North Coast, including rapid re­urbanization in the valley necks in Moche and Lam­ba yeque (Bawden 1996; Dillehay and Kolata 2004a, 2004b; Dillehay et al. 2009; Donnan and Cock 1986, 1997; Eling 1987; Shimada 1994; Swenson 2004, 2007 -but see Chapdelaine 2001, 2002). Moche religious ideology and iconographic themes disappear or were radically modified in the southern valleys, while Moche political and reli­gious culture, presumably centered on the perfor­mance of the Sacrifice Ceremony, shifted north to Jequetepeque and Lambayeque, two agriculturally 
productive regions that had long been character­ized by independent Moche polities or "royal dynasties" (Castillo and Donnan 1994b; Donnan 2007). This era of environmental hardship and sociopolitical reconstitution coincided with the emergence of the priestess cult in San Jose de Moro and the great increase in female divinities in Moc he religious art. As Vogel suggests (2003: 122), "the sudden proliferation of [the priestess's] image [and the notable decrease in depictions of the main fanged deity or his mortal representatives] could represent a change in ideology, corresponding with a rise in elite competition and factionalism." In fact, the Late Moche Period in the Jequetepeque Valley is defined by notable intensification of polit­ical conflict and internecine warfare, and the rise of the priestess cult must be understood in this par­ticular sociopolitical context, a subject to which we now tum. 
Decentralized Power and the 
Popularization of Moche Ideology in Late 
Moche Jequetepeque 

Unlike the Moche and Lambayeque Valleys, Jequetepeque did not experience rural collapse and reurbanization during the Late Moche Period. Instead, polycentric urban nodes, rural settlement, and population expanded in the lower valley while the temple center of San Jose de Moro continued to thrive as an important arena of elite-directed reli­gious celebrations (Castillo 2000b, 2001, 2006, 2010; CastiUo and Donnan 1994b:l 71-172; Dille­hay 2001:268-274; Dillehay and Kolata 2004a:4328--4329, 2004b; Dillehay et al. 2009; Eling 1987; Hecker and Hecker 1985, 1990; Swen­son 2004:406--411) (Figure 2). However, it is appar­ent that the Middle to Late Moche Period transition in Jequetepeque was also characterized by pro­found transformation and dislocation. By A.D. 650 a combination of a severe ENSO event and subse­quent sand encroachment led to the demise of the paramount center of Dos Cabezas (Moseley et al. 2008; Shimada et al. 1991). This was accompanied by the shift of political and economic power from the south to the northern half of the Valley (Dille­hay and Kolata 2004a, 2004b; Donnan 2007; Mose­ley et al. 2008). The large settlements of Cerro Chepen, Tallambo, and Pacatnamu were founded or expanded north of the river, while Huaca Colorada

in the Pampa de Mojucape emerged as an elite cer­emonial center in the heavily dunated south valley (Castillo 2010; Castillo et al. 2009; Dillehay at al. 2009; Donnan and Cock 1997; Shimada 1994; Swenson, 2012; Swenson et al. 2010, 2011). The ascendancy of the priestess cult in the north and the general decentralization of political power were undoubtedly related to these environmental and demographic fluctuations. It is also noteworthy that the most lavish elite tombs excavated in the 
Jequetepeque Valley during the preceding Middle Moche Period (A.D. 400-650) housed exclusively male interments, as has been documented at the large ceremonial center of Dos Cabezas (Donnan 2007). In contrast, with the advent of the Late Moche Period, the most extravagant tombs were those of the priestesses of San Jose de Moro, a tra­dition that lasted well over 300 years. Therefore, the famed priestesses of San Jose de Moro likely attained a level of pan-regional prestige and reli­gious authority despite presiding over a cult that was located in a divided and conflict-ridden polit­ical landscape (Castillo 2001, 2010). In fact, Moc he religious practices became remarkably widespread throughout the valley. Deregulated feasting rites, celebrated through the medium ofMoche political and religious symbols, were conducted on cere­monial structures at numerous rural sites dispersed throughout the region. As I have argued elsewhere, these ritual events likely negotiated decentralized political and economic relationships (Swenson 2004, 2006, 2007, 2008). 
Typical ceremonial constructions identified at rural settlements in Jequetepeque consiist of ter­raced platforms with front patios and prominent ramps that lead to higher daises (Figure 3). Despite their modest size in comparison to Moche urban architecture, these structures symbolized religious and political authority. The platforms appear to be scaled-down versions of the massive pyramids that dominated Moche cities, and structures of this kind are commonly portrayed on Moche pottery (Don­nan 1978; Makowski 2000; Swenson 2006) see (Figure 4). For instance, the fanged deity of the Moche pantheon is commonly shown presiding over ritual acts such as the presentation of a gob­let from dais-ramp complexes. Perhaps signifi­cantly, male deities are almost exclusively associated with this type of edifice. The discovery of statistically high concentrations of chicha (com 
beer) jars in the vicinity of these structures indi­cates that feasting rites were conducted on the numerous platforms, notwithstanding their idio­syncratic forms (Swenson 2004, 2006, 2008) (Fig­ure 5) .1 Both the ceramic corpus and excavation of select platforms at different sites further cor­roborate that the staging of feasts constituted one of their principal functions (see Swenson 2006). Hearths filled with com cobs and other organic remains were exposed adjacent to ramps in the lower patios of these constructions. In effect, these earthen ramped structures compressed productive, consumptive, and varied performative activities into a relatively small space (where feasting items were prepared, exchanged, and likely consumed). 
The multiple ceremonial settlements in Jequetepeque exhibit site-specific architectural variability, suggesting that ritual production became the prerogative of local communities and possibly rural kin groups (Swenson 2004, 2006). This is especially significant given that the archi­tectonics of the platforms prescribed set modes of ritual performance and communication that differed notably at the inter-settlement level of comparison (Figure 6). Thus the content of cer­emony appears to have varied little between the settlements despite divergent experimental frameworks structuring ritual performance. The evidence suggests that feasting rites mediated competitive and fluctuating political relations in the lower Jequetepeque Valley during the Late Moc he Period (Dillehay 200 I; Swenson 2004). The fact that many of these sites are fortified and cluster with specific irrigation networks further indicates that Jequetpeque was politically balka­nized into a number of competing polities (Castillo 2010; Dillehay 2001; Dillehay and Kolata 2004a, 2004b; Dillehay et al. 2009; Swen­son 2004, 2006; Topic and Topic 1987). Cer­tainly, the ostentatious burials of the priestess cult at San Jose de Moro attest to hierarchy and pronounced disparities in material wealth; how­ever, power relations and political identities appear to have been fluid and at times highly con­tested. Indeed, the Jequetepeque political terrain is best described as polycentric and heterarchi­cal (Dillehay 200I; Castillo2010, Swenson 2006, 2007, 2008). Communities actively defined them­selves as "Moche," while promoting decidedly local social identities and economic interests.

several sites (Portachuelo de Charcape, JE-3 10, JE-335) overlook agricultural infrastructure, or are located immediately adjacent to canals; agricul­tural production and fertility rites may have been associated with these dispersed ceremonial locales (Dillehay et al. 2009; Johnson 2008; Swenson 2004, 2007). Moreover, the platforms with ramps are built of mounded earth and gravel, in contrast to the adobe constructions and chamber tombs at San Jose de Moro located on the flat Pampa south of the Rfo Chaman. In addition, despite imitating elite ceremonial architecture associated with mor­tuary rites, the excavated ceremonial platforms in the countryside were devoid of burials; in fact, for­mal cemeteries are absent at these rural settlements. As we have seen, San Jose de Moro served as a mausoleum for both elite and commoner burials for nearly l ,000 years, and, as previously stated, the priestesses appear to have been symbolically linked to death and mortuary ritual. 
Many of these rural sites are fortified and asso­ciated with sling stone piles, as were larger centers in the valley, including the urban settlement of Cerro Chepen (Figure 7). In fact, the proliferation of both ceremonial architecture and fortifications in the Late Moche Period has been widely cited as evidence for intra-valley political balkanization in Jequetepeque (Castillo 2010; Castillo et al. 2009; Dillehay 200 1; Swenson 2004). San Jose de Moro is a notable oddity, for it lacked fortifications and a defensive position. These settlement data may very well suggest that the priestesses transcended local military and political struggles or that their religious powers insulated them from military raids. The evidence might indicate in tum that authority at San Jose de Moro was defined by but limited to a narrowly conceived religious office, a rank that could not be freely manipulated to secure greater political and economic control in the region. Cer­tainly, this center was likely the seat of religious festivals involving the performance of traditional mythological events associated with the principal female divinity, including variations of the Sacri­fice Ceremony. Enacting myths and fulfilling pre­scribed roles undoubtedly conferred noble status and material advantages to avatars of the divinity and their elite attendants. In an earlier article (Swen­son 2008), I surmised that communities in the hin­terland probably venerated the female supernatural and paid respects to the noble priestess of San Jose, but that the direct influence of the latter seemed to have been confined to the center. In other words, the authority of the San Jose lords was limited to their predetermined roles in a manner much more restrictive than among the priestly elite of the Mid­dle Moche Period. However, this interpretation is

not entirely satisfactory, for the status and even class distinctions separating San Jose de Moro from the countryside are manifest and difficult to down­play (Castillo 2001, 2010; Castillo et al. 2009). This is not to deny the likely autonomy of hinter­land communities, but these notable status differ­ences raise the question of how these societies interacted among themselves at the regional level and with the elite figures of San Jose de Moro. This question is particularly relevant considering the widespread acceptance of Moche religious values in a decentralized political landscape (or in a multi­polity locale as argued by Castillo [2010]). An in­depth exploration of feasting and military events that occurred at these sites sheds light on this cen­tral problem and the likely conceptual schemas mediating intra-regional interaction and warfare in 
the region. 
It is significant that feasting and decorated ceramics from the hinterland valorize male status as reflected in mortal notables adorned with ear spools, nose-pieces, and moustaches, as well as male divinities with fangs and snarling mouths 
(Figures 5 and 8). As mentioned, iconographic depictions of ceremonial platforms that resemble those documented in the Jequetepeque hinterland are usually associated with male divinities as well. The unmistakably masculine valence pervading iconographic expressions of power and religious mythology in rural Jequetepeque diverges remark­ably from the new-found emphasis on female deities on Late Moche fineline ceramics produced at San Jose de Moro (McClelland 1990; McClel­land et al. 2007) (Figure 8). On first inspection, the iconographic data suggest that the authority of San Jose de Moro bore little direct relevance to the political feasts and competitive ritual spectacles sponsored by hinterland communities. In fact, of the thousands of analyzed pot sherds, only one female figurine and two sherds explicitly showing the priestess have been identified at just two of the hillside ceremonial sites.Almost 99 percent of other decorated vessels depict men, male divinities, or zoomorphs ofunspecified gender (Swenson 2004). This notable emphasis on masculine imagery may be related to the hypothesis that feasting was a

male-dominated ritual in Moche society. Indeed, iconographic evidence suggests that a privileged corps of male religious specialists manufactured chicha and organized banquets sponsored by Moche state officials (Arsenault 1992). At the time of the conquest, an elite cadre of male chicheros served paramount kurakas and lesser chiefs, prepar­ing and then distributing com beer to their follow­ers (Ramirez 1996, 1998). The close association of chicha production with men on the coast differs markedly from the female supervision of com beer fermentation in the highlands and in the Inka state (Ramirez 1998). Of course, this is not to say that women did not contribute to the production of chicha in Jequetepeque or later coastal societies; rather, both com beer consumption and production appear to have been linked to masculine political authority and religious values. In fact, the dissem­ination of Wari !Tiwanaku architecture and mate­rial culture during the same period has been correlated with the explosive dissemination of com beer consumption and "festive modes of produc­tion" in the highlands of southern Peru (Cook and Glowacki 2003; Goldstein 2003). Goldstein asserts that the chicha revolution was a consensual and locally negotiated development linked to a partic­ular form of collective but hierarchically mediated kinship politics. Interestingly, isotope analysis reveals that men were the primary consumers of com beer in Middle Horizon sierra sites. 
Indeed, the decidedly masculine portraits and symbolism depicted on feasting jars point to male status competition and the androcentric context of local commensal politics. To reiterate, masculine

connotations of rural ritualism in Late Moche tives of specific genres of commensal ritual in the Jequetepeque differ from the celebration of female region (Castillo et al. 2009; Hecker and Hecker divinities and imagery at San Jose de Moro.

say, feasting vessels are distinguished not only by their representation of human notables but of men in particular, a point that is relevant to understand­ing the religious framing of intra-regional political relations in Jequetepeque. 
Feasting in the Jequetepeque countryside also appears to be directly associated with warfare that was likely of both a ritualistic and pragmatic nature. Representations of warfare in Moche art often occur against a backdrop of coastal hills and cacti (Fig­ure 9). It thus seems that battle, removed from the fertile valley bottoms, was waged in the vicinity of littoral mountains (Alva and Donnan 1993; but see critique of this thesis by Quilter 2008).The high con­centration of ceremonial sites built on the coastal ranges of the lower Jequetepeque valley indicates their militaristic ritual functions. Furthermore, an unusual combination of ritual platforms, defensive walls, and piles of stone projectiles distinguishes many of the rural ceremonial sites built on coastal hills (Figures 7 and 9). Certainly their construction on steep slopes may very well have been motivated by defensive considerations. Sling stone piles are even found on the terraces of several of the ritual constructions themselves (mainly at the sites of Catalina and San Ildefonso; Swenson 2007, 2008). Given the environmental disruptions of the Late Moche Period and the heightened competition evi­dent in the Jequetepeque Valley, it is tempting to interpret the signatures of warfare as an indication of intensified conflict over increasingly scarce resources. Many of these sites are built near agri­cultural and irrigation infrastructure that may have been dictated by a concern for safeguarding eco­nomic interests. In fact, the close association of rit­ual space and defensive constructions at many of the hinterland sites suggests that intra-valley hos­tility was cloaked in the mantle of religious legiti­macy. Communities and their respective chiefs may have justified war against rivals through the manip­ulation of Moche tenets of "violent" cosmic order­ing. Of course, for many Andean communities, agriculture and warfare were intimately linked (Gose 1993). In other words, battle suffused with religious meaning was likely implicated in politico­economic struggles in Late Moche Jequetepeque. (see Swenson 2008). It is even possible that differ­ent social groups or warrior organizations at larger sites maintained distinct platforms and feasting cir­cles, ritually waging battle among themselves within 
the confines of the site. Such an arrangement could explain why the larger of the settlements are char­acterized by a "competition between stages." The site of San Ildefonso alone consists of 17 platforms with ramps dispersed throughout the site and posi­tioned behind each of the four concentric fortifica­tion walls (Figure 7) . 
Ethnnohistoric and ethnographic evidence show that feasting, the consumption of com beer, and warfare are still closely wed in many regions of the Andes (Platt 1986; Sallnow 1987; Skar 1985).As Arnold and Hastorf (2008:93) note: "In this sense Andean feasting practices were not simply con­cerned with a redistribution of ayllu wealth (as oth­ers would have it); what was at stake was the victorious celebration of war and the domination over and empowerment of lands, food crops, and other produce of an adversary." Ethnographic accounts from the South-Central Andes also doc­ument the grinding of corn into chicha as a metaphor for the softening of enemies in tinku bat­tles (Harris 1994). 
There are currently no data to suggest that chiefs sacrificed war prisoners and subsequently con­sumed their blood on the numerous ramped struc­tures in the hinterland (Swenson 2008). Certainly the idiom of sacrifice is manifest in depictions of predatory owls, the fanged deity, and typical war­rior figures (Figure 8). However, no human offer­ings were excavated from the platforms, and equipment such as goblets and copper blades (tumi knives), prominent at San Jose de Moro, has not been recovered from hinterland sites. In fact, Moche art usually shows warfare occurring in rugged hinterland terrain, followed by the trans­portation and procession of warriors to centered ceremonial spaces, such as Moro (Figure 9). The rich organic remains, sling stones, and decorated ware associated with many of the platforms also signal the p1imacy of feasting events and warfare. Therefore, dramatized spectacles of human sacri­fice appear to have been de-emphasized in the Jequetepeque countryside in contrast to San Jose de Moro. To be sure, the proliferation of this type of settlement exemplifies the unprecedented expan­sion of the chic ha political economy and the appro­priation and deregulation of commensal rites. 
The above analysis details a series of salient contrasts between rural sites and San Jose de Moro that appear to relate to the gendering of political,

ritual, and militaristic activities in Late Moche Jequetepeque (see Table 1 fora breakdown of these contrasts). Drawing on analogies from both the Andes and elsewhere, I conclude by offering a hypothesis that power relations, linking the priest­esses of San Jose de Moro with the Jequetepeque hinterland, were structured by a sacrificial interac­tion sphere incorporating feasting, warfare, and ultimately male-female cosmological principles. As I will argue, regional political interactions appear to have been conditioned by a patticular cos­mological understanding of political empowerment and social reproduction predicated on fusing male and female creative energies. 
Sacrifice, Feasting, and Gender 
Complementarity in Late 
Moche Jequetepeque 

Scholars have shown that diverse Andean world­views are commonly grounded in a dualistic frame­work of gender complementarity (Eeckhout 1999; Makowski 2005; Ossio 1996, 2002; Salomon and Urioste 1991; Silverblatt 1987; Platt 1986; Zuidema 1962). The universe is suffused with opposing but complementary male and female energies. The bringing together and ritual synthe­sis of these energies in festivals, ceremonial events, and day-to-day practice have long been funda­mental to Andean social reproduction. Indeed, myr­iad sacrificial rites were performed in the Andes to engineer "binary compression" (Smith 1987) and thus to ensure harmonious relations ainong social members, ancestors, and divine forces. Unsurpris­ingly, such rituals frequently demanded the partic­ipation of both men and women and the explicit 
deployment of gendered symbolism. For instance, in ritualized headhunting raids in Bolivia and var­ious regions of the Amazon, women played a sig­nificant role in curating and metamorphosing heads of enemy victims captured by men (Arnold and Hastorf 2008; Arnold and Yapita 2006). The prepa­ration and embalmment of these disembodied heads by women would transubstantiate enemy spirits residing within the severed skulls into the souls ofnew babies of the women's respective com­munities. Headhunting by men thus required the transformative power of women to consummate marriage, ensure pregnancy, and promote both human and agricultural fertility (Arnold and Has­torf 2008). Interestingly, the conflation of head­hunting and fertility within a framework of gendered ritual complementarity has also been recorded in other regions of the world, especially island southeast Asia (see Hoskins 1996). Indeed, the feminine connotations of transition, exchange, and creative transformation, often expressed in sac­rificial metaphor and practice, have long been rec­ognized by anthropologists (Douglas 1966; Jamison 1996; Levi-Strauss 1969; Turner 1977). 
As summarized in Table I , the architectural and artifactual differences distinguishing San Jose de Moro from the rural feasting settlements in Jequete­peque correspond to a gendered symbolic and rit­ual divide. The majority of high elites buried at San Jose de Moro are women, and the finest ceramics commonly depict powerful female divinities. Funerary ritual, spectacles of sacrifice, large pub­lic festivals, and centered space showcasing adobe constructions prevail at this important ceremonial nucleus. In contrast, the hinterland sites were the scenes of parochial competitive feasting and war-

fare overwhelmingly associated with symbols cel­ebrating masculine divinities, militarism, and male political authority. It deserves mention that battles in Moche iconography are shown to have been an exclusively male pursuit (Arsenault 1989:321; Hocquenghem 1978). As described above, feasts were also closely linked to masculine values in Moche society, and feasting in San Jose may have been directed by male chiefs who congregated at the center when ceremonially presenting captives to the priestesses. 
The archaeological evidence suggests that the Moche priestess' sacrificial responsibilities in Jequetepeque resembled the transformative and mediating roles of women documented ethno­graphically in certain South American cultures (Arnold and Hastorf2008; Conklin 1993). In soci­eties such as the Qaqachaka of Bolivia alluded to above, decapitated heads embalmed in elaborate woven cloth made by women were analogized to seeds. The nurturing of these seed-heads by women promoted fertility and biological and community reproduction (Arnold and Yapita 2006). Makowski (2005:74) also notes that in Moche iconography women are never depicted in the act of sacrifice. The seemingly passive, even gestational half of the sacrificial process directed by women appears to have characterized feminine involvement in Late Moche sacrifice as well, as suggested by archaeo­logical and iconographic data (Figure 10). It mer­its mention that such "passivity" should not be construed negatively, but rather as metamorphic, liminal, and (pro)creative. For instance, the prepa­ration of sacrificial victims by women is depicted in Middle Moche ceramics. Non-elite women are shown holding, feeding, and grooming victims before their execution in several decorated ceram­ics (Arsenault I 989:3 19-320). 
In Late Moche Jequetepeque, male warrior chiefs and their entourages fighting in the hinter­land may have been envisioned as the active ele­ment in the complementary system; warfare staged on the hills, accompanied by feasts extolling male authority and military prowess, diverges from the mortuary and feminine associations of the priest­ess. If death is understood as the ultimate form of transition, then women's association with both death and transformation (rebirth), common in many cultures, becomes readily apparent (Jamison 1996). As we have seen, in the Late Moche Period 

priestess figures are symbolically connected to death, burial, and sacrifice. Of course sacrificial death as a socially controlled vehicle of regenera­tion, fertility, and empowerment connotes even more forcefully ideas of metamorphosis and cre­ative transition. The fineline ceramics produced at San Jose de Moro allude to such feminine roles and symbolism in Late Moche Jequetepeque. Women are commonly portrayed sitting passively on water­crafts transporting bound victims, and the boats likely symbolized passage, transition, and sacrifi­cial death (Figure 10). Iconographic depictions of warfare, however, are usually restricted to male divinities, including Wrinkle Face and Iguana, who actively battle marine monsters and supernaturals (McClelland et al. 2007). As Cole (2009) demon­strates, there is a conspicuous absence of depictions of mortal warfare in fineline ceramics produced at Late Moche Jequetepeque, a feature that distin­guishes the Moro substyle from Middle Moche iconography. Instead, supernatural themes, most often relating to the female divinity, predominate. Again, this emphasis contrasts with representations of mortal and divine male elites rendered on "mid­grade" ceramics commonly found at rural settle­ments (including depictions of warriors) (Figures 5 and 8). It is even worth considering that the dis­appearance of warrior elites from the Moro artis­tic corpus was related to the dilution of rank among a plethora of competing chiefs in the Jequetepeque countryside. Therefore, Late Moche iconography appears to reinforce the separation of roles and activities distinguishing San Jose de Moro from the numerous feasting centers in the Jequetepeque countryside. In fact, the Topics' combined analy­ses of fortification sites and shifts in iconographic themes indicate that the Late Moche Period was dis­tinguished by the large-scale participation of non­elite warriors in armed conflict throughout much of the North Coast. This scenario contrasts with the preceding era, defined by "celebrity warfare" waged between elites engaged in hand-to-hand combat (see Topic and Topic 2009). As described above, the popular participation in warfare coin­
cided with the notable decentralization of com­mensal politics and feasting arenas in Jequetepeque. 
It also significant that the pronounced contrasts in material culture, settlement, and iconography differentiating the hinterland sites from San Jose

de Moro intriguingly resemble the gendered oppo­sition of highland and coastal populations recorded at the time of the conquest, a cultural geography that many archaeologists have argued coalesced during the early Middle Horizon (Duviols 1986; Eeckhout 1999; Gose 1993; Makowski 2005; Platt 1986; Zuidema 1962). The common association of feminine powers with the plains, night, and the sea, and masculine values with mountains, day, and sky might even account for the distinct geographic dis­tribution of the settlements in question. As noted in Table 1, San Jose de Moro is located on the flat plain and is defined by funerary rites, sacrifice, feminine authority, lunar symbolism, large-scale inclusive feasting, and sea worship. In contrast, a good number of the hinterland sites are built on rocky hills that may very well have simulated the high Andean peaks in miniature (Figure 2). The development of this local geo-cosmological com­plex in Jequetepeque could have been complicit in the appropriation and recontextualization of high­land political ideologies which spread throughout the Andes during the Late Moche Period. Perhaps significantly, the great celestial god and male ora­cle Catequil of the Huamachuco highlands was symbolically linked to sling stones, which sym­bolized lightning bolts hurled down to the earth by this masculine deity (Topic 2008; Topic et al. 2002). The Staff God of the Wariffiwanaku defining the Middle Horizon is also closely related to lightning and maize and is often interpreted to be holding an onda (spear or projectile thrower) (Demarest 1981). Perhaps Moche warriors performing at the hinter­land sites identified with such masculine values, martial roles, and divinities. 
In light of the archaeological data, it could be argued that warfare and raiding in Moche Jequete­peque were often followed by celebratory rituals at the undefended center of San Jose de Moro, including possibly the offering of captured victims

to the priestesses. The bringing together of adver­saries in a more inclusive festive arena, the conse­cration of both victors and sacrificial victims (perhaps drawn from both warring sides), and their ritual purification or feminine transformation at the center, may have served to legitimize the precari­ous and shifting authority of competing chiefs in the hinterland. In Late Moche Jequetepeque, it seems that the mediating presence of a feminine power was increasingly demanded to secure the transformative efficacy of warfare, feasting, and sacrifice as a single ritual complex. Warfare con­ducted by men in the hinterland could only effect the well-being of their people and the fertility of agricultural fields through the metamorphic power of feminine energies emanating from San Jose de Moro. This complex of sociopolitical relations thus seemed to be propelled by an ideological expecta­tion to separate and then possibly fuse distinct sym­bolic and political domains construed as masculine and feminine. These domains appear to have been associated with peripheral and centered space as mediated by cycles of parochial and more inclu­sive feasting ceremonies. 
The Gendered Political Landscape in Late Moche Jequetepeque: Assessing the Evidence 
As mentioned above, ethnographers have long noted that drinking and fighting are central to the expression of Andean religious worship (Harris 1994:49-50). It is of particular significance that these fundamentally important political and reli­gious rites are performed in explicitly gendered spatial fields; ritual tinku engineers symmetry and complementary opposition, and scholars have iden­tified "a metaphorical equivalence between tinku as battle between balanced adversaries and the ·amorous encounter' of a woman and a man" (Har­ris 1994:44, see also Allen 1988). Andean moieties pitted in ritual warfare are structured socially and spatially as male and female, victor and vanquished, upper and lower, high mountains and low plains (Bouysse-Cassagne 1986; Platt 1986; Urton 1993). In describing the gendering of ritual violence in Andean societies, the Topics note (2009:26): "In cosmological terms, yanatin [the principle of the conjugal pair] would refer to the masculine and feminine elements that are necessary for the renewal of the world, while tinku would describe the union of those gendered elements that enacts the renewal." The spilling of blood on the field of battle was perceived ultimately as a sacrificial offer­ing to Pachamama, promoting social reproduction and agricultural fertility. 





It is fascinating that a pronounced gendered landscape pivoting on sacrifice, warfare, and feast­ing similarly characterized Late Moche Jequete­peque. However, the differences with the ethnographilc record are equally intriguing, as exemplified by the unprecedented ascendancy of female elites in the valley. Tinku battles are fought in liminal spaces, including town plazas or mar­ginal and barren pampas (Harris 1994:47). In con­trast, the liminal and sacrificial interplay of male and female elements in Late Moche Jequetepeque was not confined to any one space (for instance, a plaza situated between a male hanan moiety and its female hurin equivalent), but involved separa­tion, movement, and unification across the broader ritual landscape. Warfare, as a distinct form of lim­inal encounter, was identified with masculine val­ues and dispersed hillside settlements, while the mortuary and sacrificial connotations of San Jose de Moro point to a separate liminal nexus of cre­ative transformation and rebirth, one linked more specifically with feminine and possibly ancestral powers. The apparently protracted and geograph­ically extensive "rite of passage" constituting the larger ritual cycle thus involved a double experi­ence of the liminal; separation, division, and inter­group conflict celebrated in military skirmishes in the hinterland were followed by the sacrificial uni­fication of likely disparate peoples at the priestess center. All stages of this complex ritual round were underwritten by feasting and com beer consump­tion. Significantly, even among contemporary Andean communities, it has been observed that "all violence is unleashed in the liminal state of drunkenness, when everyday life is suspended and normal inhibitions are lowered" (Harris 1994:49). In fact, comparing the much larger scale of public commensal events at San Jose de Moro with the multiple and diminutive feasting arenas in the hin­terland provides further evidence of a pulsating gendered lm1dscape animated by the cyclical frag­mentation and reunification of warring communi­ties. Perhaps we can understand the priestess center in terms of the cross-cultural symbolism of women as unifiers of unrelated and often hostile kin groups,

a symbolism that rested not strictly on associations of marriage and childbirth but on conceptions of sacri ficial creation particular to the Moche. 
Of course, it could be argued the evidence for human sacrifice at San Jose de Moro is only indi­rect and circumstantial. Sacrificial iconography, artifacts, and attendant offerings accompanying elite burials distinguish the priestess center, but evidence for the actual ritual killing of male war­riors is presently lacking. To be sure, even though the archaeological database strongly indicates that a gendered religious landscape pivoting on warfare, feasting, and sacrificial ideologies constrained and enabled military engagements in Late Jequete­peque, the actual ceremonies constituting this wider field of political action elude full interpretation. Perhaps male victims were sacrificed at sea under the direction of the priestess, as indicated by the iconographic corpus, a scenario that would explain the general dearth of male victims at Moro. It also cannot be discounted th at sacrifice retained a vital symbolic importance in the figure of the priestess, but that its actual execution was largely replaced by warfare and feasting directed by local male elites (as characterizes modem-day tinku). Recent exca­vations at the Late Moche copper production cen­ter ofHuaca Colorada in the southern Jequetepeque Valley have uncovered seven sacrificial offerings, all of women or adolescents (Swenson 2012; Swen­son et al. 2010, 2011). The evidence suggests a possible correlation between the rise of the priest­ess cult and a shift from male (warrior) to female sacrifices. In any event, the available data indicate rather unequivocally that women became closely identified with political authority, death, sacrifice, and rites of fertility in Late Moche Jequetepeque. Indeed, the mortuary record demonstrates the religious and political integration of the hillside sites and San Jose de Moro and thus lends further support to the regional gendering of dist inct cere­
monial spaces. Unfired clay models of ramped rit­ual platforms, closely resembling known structures in the hinterland, were found interred in a number of elite tombs at the priestly center (Castillo et al. 1997: 124; McClelland 20 10). Several of these maquetas are nearly identical in form and layout to ceremonial platforms mapped at Portachuelo de Charcape, San Ildefonso, and Huaca Colorada (Castillo et al. 1997; McClelland 2010; Swenson 2006: 121). Therefore, the greater Jequetepeque 
region defi es interpretation as a political landscape balkanized into independent high and low church variants of Moche religion. These miniature rep­resentations of ceremonial space suggest that the built places indexing particular individuals and their communities were ritually and politically reliant on the priestess cult. It is interesting to con­sider that miniature house compounds ritually offered to venerated peaks in contemporary Andean communities represent more than iconic votives; instead, they serve as generative "prototypes" or "seeds" that vitalize the spaces and people they represent (Allen 1998:24--25). Perhaps the elabo­rate models, fabricated of unfired clay (thus in a pre-cooked, liminal, and generative state), simi­larly functioned as life -giving seeds. Literally "planted" with deceased warriors or respected local elites, their incorporation in the domain of the priestess -a sacred place of sacrificial regeneration-ensured the soc ial reproduction and future military success of local lineages while fer­tilizing the agri cultural fi elds of the community in question. Of course, structuralists have long argued that by processing raw materials into finished prod­ucts (cooking, weaving, making babies, etc.), women secured an important symbolic position in rituals of destructive creation (Levi-Strauss 1964). The striking clay models appear to encapsulate just such religious roles and meanings. 
Evidence for a regional political and religious interaction sphere centered on San Jose de Moro is furt her supported by valley-wide settlement data that point to the regular internal movement of peo­ple. In truth, rotating feasts and peripatetic settle­ment defined Middle Horizon Jequetepeque. Shifting and overlapping floors intercalated with short episodes of abandonment point to periodic occupations at a number of settlements; temporary residence at different types of sites (agricultural hamlets, fortified ceremonial sites, religious cen­ters) was perhaps dictated by a ceremonial calen­dar or related economic and military cycles (Dillehay et al. 2009; Swenson 2004; Swenson et al. 2011; Swenson and Warner 20 12). The priest­ess center is also largely devoid of domestic con­texts, and people congregated here in large numbers only at specific moments in time to participate in funerary and feasting rites (Castillo et al. 2009). Therefore, it is important to note that the gender­ing of distinct places did not presuppose the exclu-

sion of men from feminized locales or women from symbolically male landscapes; rather, the evoca­tive spaces actively and variably gendered partic­ipating celebrants. Women no doubt assisted in com beer production and military preparations at the hillside ceremonial sites, and they may have assumed masculine identities within specific spa­tial contexts (as is the case in modem-day tinku­see Harris 1994). Similarly, burial rites at San Jose de Moro possibly entailed the feminization of men as they completed their passage to an ancestral state, which in the Andes was inextricably linked to agricultural fertility (Gose 1993). The important point to consider is that the dynamic gendering of political subjectivities was likely consummated through the active experience of different places; movement to and between ceremonially charged loci no doubt shaped and reinforced ideological constructions of place in Late Moche Jequetepeque, as did the activities prescribed by the sites in ques­tion, from heated battle to funerary ritual to feast­ing from jars celebrating elite male personages. 
Discussion 
It would be a mistake to assume that the gendered geo-cosmological schema hypothesized for Late Moche Jequetepeque formed an uncompromising dominant ideology that deterministically structured the field of political action and military struggles. Rather, this particular religious complex appears to have been elaborated and transformed by diverse parties in the midst of the environmental and polit­ical turmoil inaugurating the Late Moche Period. In other words, I wish to temper what would seem to be an uncompromising structuralist argument with a consideration of the culturally dynamic polit­ical history of Late Moche Jequetepeque (see Pauketat 2009: 24 7). The particular "structure of the conjuncture" (Sahlins 1985) leading to the rise of the priestess cult was evidently related to the devo­lution of power in the region and perhaps the spread of certain highland practices and ideologies includ­ing the popularization of maize beer consumption. In the Middle Moche Period, female priestesses are known iconographically and archaeologically on the North Coast of Peru, but they are interpreted to have played a supporting if not subservient role to the principal male divinity (Bawden 1996; Makowski 2003). The notable competition between multiple ceremonial stages showcasing male-dom­inated feasting and military rites in Jequetepeque points to the dilution of power among a number of petty chiefs or lineage heads (see also Topic and Topic 2009). These individuals appear to have appropriated the ceremonies of urban elites whose authority was once defined by performing the roles of the principal (masculine) Moche divinities (Alva and Donnan 1993; Bawden 1996; Castillo and Rengifo 2008). Local groups maintained their autonomy by engaging directly in warfare, feast­ing, and possibly sacrifice-ceremonial and polit­ical events that were more tightly monopolized by royal notables in the Middle Moche Period. The prestige and religious mission of the priestesses clearly benefited from the fragmentation of power, although their authority and amplified sacrificial duties (either real or largely symbolic) may have been dependent on the political machinations of petty lords living within and outside the valley. 
It is more difficult to explain why the female pole of the politico-religious spectrum was mag­nified in the Late Moche Period. The elevation of the priestess and the presumably concomitant iden­tification of sacrificial transformation, creation, and ancestralization with female powers were likely driven by complex historical forces, includ­ing political fragmentation, the reformulation of encroaching highland belief systems, the popu­larization of warfare and com beer consumption, and even religious revitalization movements. In fact, archaeologists have argued that the ecologi­cal perturbations inaugurating the Late Moche Period might explain the new found emphasis on female divinities and maritime themes and the foundation of the priestess cult in Jequetepeque (Cordy-Collins 2001; McClelland 1990; Shimada 1994). The priestess is commonly associated with the ocean and lunar symbols, and scholars have argued that the main female god may be the moon herself (Benson 1972, 1988:65; Cordy-Collins 2001; Hocquenghem 2008:30). McClelland ( 1990) suggests that disruptive El Nifio events are first detected in changes in sea temperature and marine life. Therefore, the Moche reoriented reli­gious devotion toward the sea and moon, privi­leging female divinities given the ocean's important role in environmental prognostication (see also Cordy-Collins 200 1). At the time of the conquest, North Coast communities held the moon

in higher regard than the sun, and moon worship was actually based in the Jequetepeque Valley (Calancha 1977 [1638]; Means 1931:60-61; Rowe 1948). This lunar focus may very well have had its origins in the Late Moche Period. 
Concluding Remarks 

An important objective of the article was to demon­strate how archaeologists can interpret power rela­tions as meaningfully constituted by the actual people who reproduced, contested, or were affected by such relationships. An investigation of the con­textual interrelationships of distinct artifact assem­blages, built environments, and settlement locations in the Jequetepeque Valley permitted an approxi­mation of the culturally embedded and symbolic dimensions of past politico-religious traditions including military conflicts. As a result, it was pos­sible to avoid reducing ideology to a simple tool of domination or to the universal intentions of econ­omizing and ahistorical agents (Smith 2004). 
To conclude, we can state with confidence that Moche military conflicts were suffused with reli­gious meaning in Jequetepeque. In many instances, they may even have conformed to traditional def­initions of "ritualized combat," wherein fighting was deemed sacred and battle tactics followed cer­tain prescribed conventions. However, this is not to argue that the Moche blindly followed a rigid liturgy of divine warfare. Warfare in Late Jequete­peque was no doubt waged to defeat foes, appro­priate resources, and avenge perceived wrongs. Nevertheless, armed conflicts were conditioned and given significance by specific regimes of prac­tice, including gendered constructions of cosmol­ogy, sacrifice, and legitimate social intercourse. In fact, ritual adherence to the conventions of war as religious process not only legitimized the decision to engage in armed conflict but was perhaps vital in guaranteeing victory-both on the battlefield and in the larger political arena of the Jequetepeque Valley. In the end, political "aggrandizement" as achieved through military campaigns conformed to particular ideological expectations and cultural val­ues specific to Late Moche Jequetepeque.

Notes 
I. In total, 10 Moche settlements were fully mapped, sur­face collected., and test-excavated (Swenson 2004). In con­trast to domestic terraces within these sites, statistically higher concentration of musical instruments and decorated feasting jars were recovered from the surface of the ramped platforms. The settlements were also lacking cemeteries as confirmed by intensive site survey, excavation, the inspection of looters' pits, and subsequent research conducted by other archaeological teams (Castillo 2010; Dillehay et al. 2009; Johnson 2008). In fact, settlement data confirm that the Moche buried their dead in distinct mortuary sites including Pacatnamu and San Jose de Moro.
