FROM TULA CHICO TO CHICHÉN ITZÁ: IMPLICATIONS OF THE 
EPICLASSIC SCULPTURE OF TULA FOR THE NATURE AND TIMING
OF TULA­CHICHÉN CONTACT 

Keith Jordan 
In the last four decades, a number of archaeologists and art historians have posited that “Toltec” Chichén Itzá (Yucatán,Mexico) flourished during the ninth and tenth centuries A.D. They argued that because the “Toltec” style in Yucatánpredated the Tollan phase at Tula (Hidalgo, Mexico), most of the style features shared between the cities originated withthe Maya. Here, I examine the relevance of the Epiclassic relief sculpture of Tula Chico for the timing and nature of contactbetween Tula and Chichén Itzá. The presence of reliefs of reclining figures in clear “Toltec” style at Tula Chico in contextspredating their occurrence at Chichén Itzá suggests that claims for a predominantly Maya origin for that style stand in needof revision. Such a rethinking is supported by other fragmentary images from Tula Chico (eagles and Venus symbols), aswell as by new studies of ceramic materials and chronology at Chichén Itzá. It is clear that Tula was an active participantin whatever interactions led to similar visual arts at Chichén Itzá, and at least some of the shared iconography has temporalpriority at Tula. 
En las últimas cuatro décadas, un número de arqueólogos e historiadores del arte han propuesto que el estilo “Tolteca” deChichén Itzá (Yucatán, México), floreció durante los siglos nueve y diez A.D. Estos investigadores argumentaron que, dadoque el estilo “Tolteca” en Yucatán precedió a la fase Tollan en Tula (Hidalgo, México), la mayoría de los rasgos compartidosentre las ciudades se originaron de los Mayas. En este trabajo se examina la relevancia de la escultura relieve de Tula Chicopara el tiempo y la naturaleza del contacto entre Tula y Chichén Itzá. La presencia de relieves de figuras reclinadas de estiloclaramente “Tolteca” en Tula Chico, en contextos anteriores a su existencia en Chichén Itzá, sugiere que las afirmacionesacerca de que el origen del estilo fue predominantemente maya necesitan ser revisadas. Este replanteo es apoyado por otrasimágenes fragmentarias de Tula Chico (águilas y símbolos de Venus), así como también por nuevos estudios de la cerámicay la cronología de Chichén Itzá. Es claro que Tula fue un participante activo en cualesquiera que hayan sido las interaccionesque llevaron a las semejanzas del arte visual en Chichén Itzá.Además, al menos una parte de la iconografía compartida tieneprioridad temporal en Tula.

In one per­spective, the cities are viewed as largely contem­poraneous, with the florescence of Chichén Itzábeginning in the Terminal Classic but extendinginto the twelfth century and overlapping with theTollan­phase (A.D. 900–1150) apogee at Tula.Alternately, “Toltec” Chichén Itzá is interpretedasapredominantlyTerminalClassicphenomenon,decliningbyA.D.1000–1050,andthereforecoevalwith only the beginnings of the Tollan phase.

Kowalski andKristan­Graham admit that this dichotomy is aheuristic abstraction, given the wide variationamongmodelsandthepresenceoffeaturesofbothpoles of opinion in most, but it remains a usefuldevice for categorizing the range of explanationsput forward over the long controversy.

ABrief Historiography 
Ashortsynopsisofthecurrentstateofthedebateis in order to briefly bring this epic of Epiclassicstudiesuptodateandestablishthecontextforthesignificance of the new materials. For a greaterpart of the last century, it was enshrined in text­books that resemblances between the two cities were the result of art styles brought to Yucatánfrom Tula as a result of a Toltec invasion inA.D. 987, the date set by questionable readings of thepostconquest Books of Chilam Balam. That this entradaleftnotracesinthevastexpansebetweenTula and Chichén Itzá bothered few if any of itsproponents. Versions of this migratory scenariodiffered only in degree of complexity, withTozzer’s (1957) saga of repeated invasions andMaya revolts being the most intricate narrative.This consensus began to disintegrate withKubler’s (1961) seminal paper arguing for Mayaorigins for the “Toltec” style shared by Tula andits Yucatec counterpart. Although still framedwithin a story of Toltec invasions of the Mayaregion, Kubler’s controversial contributionpointed to possible Classic Maya precursors forsome “Toltec” motifs, and their alleged lack ofantecedents atTula, to hypothesize thatTula wasmerely a crude frontier copy of a style that orig­inated at ChichénItzá. In the words of ClemencyCoggins(2002:41),Kubler’spaperwas “theshot that was heard around the small world of Mesoamerican archaeology, resounding still.”
The traditional Tula­to­Chichén Itzá model was abandoned by almost all Mayanists in the1980s and 1990s. This rejection was facilitated

Some of thesemodels(e.g.,Jones1995)drewonJ.EricThomp­son’s (1970) hypothesis of the Gulf Coast PutúnMaya as the innovators of the eclectic art ofChichén Itzá.Although Thompson also includedaToltec incursion intoYucatán in his reconstruc­tions, by the late 1980s Toltec invaders were nolongerapartofmostmodels.ThislefttheMaya—albeit a Putún group with strong central Mexicanconnections—as the primary synthesizers of artand architecture at Chichén Itzá and, often byextension, Tula. Eventually, even the Putún van­ishedfrommosthistoricalnarratives.TheMayanlanguagereflectedininscriptionsat Chichén ItzáprovedtobetheCholanoftheClassicMayaratherthan Chontal, and the eponymous Itzá foundersof the city were identifiedas the results of a dias­pora from the Classic cities of the Petén (e.g.,Schele and Mathews 1998). Although muchrefuted (e.g., Kremer 1994), Thompson’s Putúnstill make their appearance as the MexicanizedMaya rulers of Chichén Itzá in some textbooksand in the occasional paper.
A number of contributors to the debate in the 1980sand1990sarguedthatthenorthern“Toltec”sector of Chichén Itzá partially or completelyoverlappedintimewiththeLatetoTerminalClas­sic “Maya” component, the Pu’uk­related rangestructuresofsouthChichénItzá,andthuspredatedtheTollan phaseatTulabyat least half acentury.Lincoln (1990), based on the settlement patternanalysis presented in his doctoral dissertation,arguedforcompletecontemporaneityof“Toltec” and “Maya” Chichén Itzá. His reappraisal ofceramicdatasuggestedthesame:theSotutacom­plex, traditionally associated with the “Toltec”monuments, seemed also to be associated withMaya­style buildings like Las Monjas. SotutaappearedtooverlapwiththeearlierCehpechcom­plex wares in the early stages of construction of the “Toltec” Temple of the Warriors and theCastillo.Inaddition,interpretationofradiocarbondates from the Castillo and inscribed Calendar Round dates from within k’atun 10.3 from the “Toltec”­styleHighPriest’sGraveandMaya­styleCaracol (Bey and Ringle 2007:416; Ringle et al.1998:190–192) seemed to support this revisedsequence. If, according to these reconstructions,the main phase of “Toltec” construction atChichén Itzá ended byA.D. 1000 and perhaps asearlyasA.D.950,thischronologywouldleaveatmosta50­yearoverlapbetweenChichénItzáandTollan­phase Tula.
In this context, some archaeologists and arthistorians claimedvictory fora moreradical ver­sionofKubler’ssuggestions;theyarguedthatthesupposed temporal priority of Chichén Itzá gaveit creative priority and positioned it as the sourceof the style and iconography of Tula. For Ringleand colleagues (1998:184), these chronologicalrevisions made it a “near impossibility that Tol­lan­phaseTulastoodasadonorculture,” because thebeginningsoftheTula­relatedstyleatChichénItzá ostensibly predated its appearance at Tula.Dating all major sculpture at Tula to the Tollanphase but placing the beginning of “Toltec”Chichén Itzá around A.D. 850–880, Bey andRinglefoundmoreevidenceoftheearlyevolutionof the Toltec style at Chichén Itzá than Tula(2007:397; Ringle and Bey 2009:345). Similarlyreversing the direction of earlier models, ScheleandMathews(1998:200)attributedthevisualpar­allels between Tula and Chichén Itzá to Maya“influence”oncentralMexicoduringtheEpiclas­sic, reflected in the eclectic art styles of Cacaxtlaand Xochicalco. 
By2010,thesemodelswereincreasinglychal­lenged. Michael Smith (2007:581) criticized therevisionist views of Chichén Itzá, as well as thehypotheses they replaced, for their one­sideddependence on epigraphic and art­historical evi­dence due to deficiencies and gaps in the archae­ological evidence (and its publication) fromChichén Itzá. Reevaluation of and additions to thatevidencewouldnotbelongincoming.Garcíaand Cobos (2009) emphasized the distinctionbetween the early Sotuta complex, which theyplace between A.D. 700/750 and A.D. 900, andlate Sotuta, which they date to A.D. 900–1050.They criticize Lincoln’s total Cehpech­Sotuta

overlapmodelforitsfailuretotakethisdistinctionintoaccount(GarcíaandCobos2009:60).Onthebasisoftheirrevisedceramicchronology,Garcíaand Cobos (2009:48, 115) date the Maya­stylebuildings of south Chichén Itzá to the ninth cen­turyorearlierintheLateClassic,andthebuildingsoftheGranNivelaciónofnorthChichénItzá(andtheheightofthepowerofthecity)mostlytoA.D.900–1100,withconstructionendingbythebegin­ning of the twelfth century (see also Cobos2004:520, 533, 537).
In his 2010 doctoral dissertation, Pérez(2010:138–142) argued for further and very dif­ferent revisions to the ceramic chronology ofChichén Itzá. He confirmed that earlierYabnal— but not Sotuta ceramic wares—were associated withthefoundationsandarchitecturalfillofMaya­stylestructuresinthesouthernhalfofthesite;theHouseofthePhalli,CasaColorada,andHouseoftheThreeLintelsthuspredateSotuta.Furthermore,Cehpech pottery was found in the fill of theAkabDzib,alsoincontextslackingSotuta.Thus,Pérez(2010:178)rejectsanysignificantoverlapbetweenthe Cehpech and Sotuta ceramic complexes. HedatesthebeginningsofCehpechtoA.D.830–850and attributes to this complex a duration of aboutacentury.HeplacesthebeginningofSotutaaroundA.D.920–930anditsterminusbetweenA.D.1100 andA.D.1150,possiblyaslateasA.D.1200(Pérez2010:269).The Castillo and other “Toltec” struc­tures on the Gran Nivelación are associated with Late Sotuta and thus get pulled forward to A.D.1000–1150, making them coeval with Tollan­phase Tula (Pérez 2010:205). In this reconstruc­tion, building activity at Chichén Itzá tapered offand ceased between A.D. 1150 and A.D. 1250– 1300(Pérez2010:333),sothattheendof“Toltec” Chichén Itzá roughly coincides with the end ofTula Grande. 
TherecentworkofBraswellandhisassociates (Braswell2011;BraswellandPeniche2012;Voltaand Braswell 2014) also raises significant ques­tionsforthechronologyofChichénItzá.Braswellandhisteamconductedstratigraphicexcavationsin 2009 on the Gran Nivelación east of the Castillo, between that structure and the WesternColonnade of the Group of the ThousandColumns. Their results indicate that the last remodeling of the Castillo and the final floor ofthe Gran Nivelación to the east were completed in the Early Postclassic, around A.D. 950–1000(Braswell and Peniche 2012:238). Because theTemple of the Warriors and the Great Ball Courtanditsassociatedtempleswerebuiltafterthecon­struction of the Castillo and its associated floor,they also must be Early Postclassic. Volta andBraswell(2014:364–365)alsoquestionthevalid­ity of the Cehpech ceramic complex, which waskeytopriorattemptsatsortingoutthechronologyof Chichén Itzá. They note difficulties in distin­guishing among the slate wares of this complexandraisethequestionofwhetherCehpechrepre­sentsarealphaseoragroupofwidelysharedelitewaresintegratedintootherregionalceramiccom­plexes across Yucatán. On the basis of theirBayesian analysis of radiocarbon dates fromChichénItzá,VoltaandBraswell(2014:380–383)place the full development of the Tula­relatedstyle (which they prefer to call “International”ratherthan“Toltec”)atChichénItzábetweenA.D.950 and A.D. 998. While observing that this isaround the same date as the traditionalA.D. 987 placementoftheToltecentrada,theynonethelessagreewithallotherrecentcommentatorsinreject­ing the mid­twentieth­century invented saga ofToltec (or Putún) invaders. For them, ChichénItzá is a Maya site. Its similarities to Tula (andother Mesoamerican regions) is best explainedthough the “emulation of foreign styles, wide­ranging trade relations, and a shared world reli­gion” (Volta and Braswell 2014:393). AlthoughBraswell and associates note that architectural traits associated with their International Style(e.g., columns) appear on the Gran Nivelación asearly as the second half of the ninth century, andpossibly as early as A.D. 800 (Braswell andPeniche 2012:253), for them, the heyday of“Toltec” Chichén Itzá is a Postclassic phenome­non that took place between A.D. 950 and A.D.1050 (Braswell 2011; Braswell and Peniche2012:258; Volta and Braswell 2014:372, 382–383,389–390).TheydisputePérez’sdatingoftheend of construction as late as A.D. 1100–1200,instead placing the decline of Chichén Itzá priorto the demise of Tula Grande.

early art of Tula prior to the Tollan phase wasalmost completely unknown until very recently,and the Epiclassic art (ca. A.D. 650–900) of thesite is represented only by very incompleteremains.MastacheandCobean(1989:58,Figure8)arguedthatafragmentofreliefsculptureshow­ing a feathered headdress from La Mesa, a sitenear Tula dated to around A.D. 650, resembledthe headgear of the composite creature imagesonPyramidBatTulaGrande,thusdemonstratingthat the art of Epiclassic Tula was stylisticallysimilar to later Tollan­phase developments.Cohodas (1989:225), however, saw the closestparallelstothisfragmentinTeotihuacanart.Beyand Ringle (2007:406) later suggested that theincompletenessofthefragmentrendereditincon­clusive, at best, as evidence for the roots of theToltecstyle,whichtheyattributedpredominantlytoChichénItzáintheabsenceofclearantecedents at Tula. Nonetheless, they also commented thatrecent and, at that time unpublished, discoveriesbyCobeanatTulaChicomightforcearethinkingof their position (Bey and Ringle 2007:418).Cobean and associates have indeed since pub­lished reliefs from an Epiclassic context at TulaChico, rendered in a style very close to that oftheTollanphaseanddisplayingthesameiconog­raphy (Jiménez 2010:Photos 20–21, Drawings6–11;Mastacheetal.2009:313–314,Figures20–24; Suárez et al. 2007).
TulaChico(Figure1)wastheoriginalpolitical­religious core of Tula, dating to the Prado (A.D.650–750) and Corral (A.D. 750–850) phases.Both phases are characterized by the presence ofCoyotlatelcopotterytypes,andbothweredefinedmostly on the basis of test excavations by theInstituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia atTula Chico in the 1970s, three in the ceremonialcomplexitselfandanother180mtothesouthwest(Healan 2012:78). Since the distinction betweenthese phases is based more on differences in thefrequencyofceramictypesratherthancleartran­sitions, it has been questioned as somewhat arbi­trary,andHealan(2012:78)suggeststhatperhapsthey might be better understood as early and latesubphases of a single phase.
Tula Chico is one of 10 large, nucleated Epi­classic hilltop sites in the Tula region, whichincludetheaforementionedsiteofLaMesa.These sites represent a radical discontinuity in settle­mentpatternswithearlierTeotihuacan­associatedsites in the area, probably reflecting an intrusivepopulation, perhaps of northern or western Mex­ican affiliation as evidenced by ceramic similar­ities to Classic pottery traditions from the Bajío(Cobean 1990:500–501; Healan 2012:80–81;Mastache et al. 2002:69–71). The chronologicalrelationshipofTulaChicowiththeothernineset­tlements remains unclear. The latter may be ear­lier, associated with the first Epiclassic La Mesaphase (ca. A.D. 650–700) in the Tula region(Healan2012:76).Prado­phaseceramicmaterialsare associated with the earliest constructions at Tula Chico (Cobean et al. 2012:42; Mastache etal.2009:311–312).Nevertheless,theextantradio­carbondatesfromTulaChicoandLaMesashow analmosttotaloverlapinfourofthefivesamplesfrom each site, suggesting that the two centerscould have been contemporaries, although thesmall number of samples from both makes thisuncertain (Healan 2012:80). Four radiocarbondatesfromaplatformeastoftheTulaChicoplaza,calibrated to two standard deviations, rangebetween A.D. 700 and A.D. 900. Although thisdoesnot permit thebuildingto bedated withanygreater precision, the excavators interpret this asevidencethatconstructionbeganaroundA.D.700because there was another building stage beforethe one that is dated (Mastache et al. 2009:314;Suárez et al. 2007:50).

In the end, TulaChico was burned and destroyed ca. A.D. 800–
850. After this violent termination, it was aban­doned and never reoccupied—a significant factforanyunderstandingoftherelationshipbetweenits art and that of Chichén Itzá.

Theirpose appears related to pan­Mesoamerican con­ventions for the depiction of elite ancestors iden­tifiedbyUrcid(2010)andthatIrelatetotheTulaexamples (Jordan 2013). The similarity of theTula Chico examples to the Tollan­phase imagessuggests to the excavators that the same dynasticinstitutions and ideology reflected in the art ofTula Grande already were present at the time ofthe construction of Tula Chico (Mastache et al.2009:322).

Besidesthe eagle noted above, Jiménez (2010:Drawing11)reproducesareliefofafelinefromTulaChico(Figure 6a) that may have formed part of such afeature, and notes its resemblance to the jaguarsof the Pyramid B frieze. Finally, a slab sculptureofanelitepersonagewithcrossedarmsfromTulaChico is executed in a style recalling Early Post­classic Tula stone carving (Jiménez 2010:Photos13–14;comparetodelaFuenteetal.1988:Figures4,5,7,9,11).Columns,aprominentsharedfeatureofTollan­phasebuildingstylesatTulaand“Toltec”Chichén Itzá, are already present at Tula Chico(Kristan­Graham 2007:541).

Reliefs of reclining elites of the kind found atTula Chico are paralleled in several architecturalcontexts at Chichén Itzá: on the Platform of the Eagles (Figure 7b; Tozzer 1957:Figure 243), the“Toltec” annex to Las Monjas (Figure 7c;Tozzer1957:Figure575),andonthetablerosoftheTem­pleoftheWarriors(Figure8a;Tozzer1957:Figure

431). The similarities of the Temple of the War­riors to Pyramid B have made it the “lynchpin of the Tula­Chichen relationship” (Kristan­Graham2007:557), the ground zero of the scholarly con­flicts of the last century and a quarter. Based ontheresemblanceofreliefsontheTerminalClassic Temple of the Warriors and on the Palacio Que­mado,BeyandRingle(2007)arguedthattheTem­ple of the Warriors came first. But the presenceof similar images at Tula Chico considerablyundermines this argument, even if the TerminalClassic placement of the Temple of the Warriorsis correct, and the more recent evaluations of thechronology of Chichén Itzáindicate that it is not.

These features distinguish them fromsimilarimagesatthePalacioQuemadoandotherlocales at Tula, to which we now must add TulaChico.Despitetheabsenceofthedistinctiveeye­wear of the storm god, Jiménez (2010:18) sug­gests that the reclining figures from Tula Chicoare “possibly tlaloques,” hinting at a possibleconceptual link between the Epiclassic TulareliefsandtheirYucateccounterparts.Tlalocgog­gles appear on a pillar relief from Pyramid B aspart of a similarly costumed standing figure,either representing the deity himself or a Tularuler impersonating him (Jiménez 2010:95,Drawing 3; Mastache et al. 2009:300, Figure 9).Cobeanandcolleagues(2012:75)explicitlycom­pare this image to reliefs of goggled figures atChichénItzá.InaPalacioQuemadobenchfrieze,armed human figures march behind Tlaloc or an impersonator of that deity (Mastache et al.2002:124,Figure5.37).ItseemslikelythatTlalocwas considered a patron of royalty at Tula, andthat Toltec rulers perhaps were viewed as incar­nationsofthisdivinity(Mastacheetal.2002:104,125, 142).Although such goggles are part of thewidely disseminated complex of TeotihuacanStorm God and martial imagery that formed ashared Classic inheritance for both Tula and ChichénItzá,recliningfiguresofthistypeandinthisstyleandmediumaretodateunknownintheart of Teotihuacan.

Nonetheless, in other respects—pose,costume,staffs,andweapons—theyareveryclose to their Tula Chico counterparts. Urcid(2010:Figures 28–29) demonstrates the pan­Mesoamerican distribution of reclining ancestorimagery from the Olmec through the Late Post­classic, but the Classic Maya examples he repro­duces (Figures 8d–e), although conceptuallyextremelysimilar,areverydifferentinstylefromthose at Tula and Chichén Itzá. The first occur­rence known to date of such ancestor images in abroadly“Toltec”styleisatTulaChico,increasingthelikelihoodthatthisversionofthisthemeorig­inated there. 
The reclining ancestor motif occurs alongsideeagles (Tozzer 1957:Figure 431) and jaguars onthree bands of relief on the cornices above each level of the outer walls of theTemple of theWar­riors(Figure8a).Tula­styleeaglesalsoappearonthefaçadeoftheNorthColonnadeatChichénItzáand are depicted eating hearts (paralleling thoseonPyramidB)ontheTzompantliandthePlatformof the Eagles (Figure 5b), along with jaguars. Afragmentary image of an eagle in a quite similarstyle occurs in association with the reclining fig­uresatTulaChico,althoughitis unclearwhetherthey are part of the same composition. We there­fore now have two related images with a contextsuggestive of a longer history and developmentatTulathanatChichénItzá.Thejaguar fragmentfromTulaChicomakesthree.Sincethesubstruc­ture of the Castillo has two reliefs of prowlingjaguarsin“Toltec”style,alongwithentwinedser­pents, Bey and Ringle (2007:412) maintain thattheseimageshavealongerhistoryatChichénItzáthan atTula (also Ringle and Bey 2009:346, Fig­ures 10b–10c). The jaguar fragment from TulaChico,however,isquitesimilarinstyleandolder,oratleastoverlapsifweaccepttheirdatingoftheCastillosubstructuretoA.D.850–880(RingleandBey 2009:345). If Braswell and Peniche’s(2012:254, 259) tentative placement of theCastillo­sub in the early tenth century is correct, its feline sculptures postdate Tula Chico by atleast half a century. The Venus symbols found atTulaChicoarealsoparalleledatChichénItzá,forexampleontheMercadodais,onacolumnoftheSouth Temple of the ball court, and on the VenusPlatform, which also bears reliefs of eagles,felines, and reclining figures (Tozzer 1957:121;seeMiller1989foranextendedtreatment).Com­pare,forexample,Figure4b,astarfromtheVenusPlatform, with its Tula Chico counterparts. Thismakes a suite of four images with demonstrablyolder occurrence at Tula. 
A compounding difficulty is that processionsoffelinesandraptors,likesomeothertraitssharedbetween the “twin cities,” predate both centers inthe art of Teotihuacan (e.g., Miller 1973:Figures22,26,250–252).TheVenusstarsarealsoofTeoti­huacan origin and prominent in the Epiclassic artofCacaxtlaandXochicalco.Itisconceivablethat theeagles,jaguars,andVenussymbolscouldhavereachedbothTulaandChichénItzáindependentlythrough the shared Classic legacy of Teotihuacanin central Mexico and among the Maya. Never­theless, as previously noted, the reclining relieffigures of the kind found at the twin Tollans arenot known at Teotihuacan and apparently maketheirfirstappearanceatTulaChico.Thisincreasesthelikelihoodthatthisgroupofimages,withtheirassociated range of styles, was appropriated as apackage from Tula by the elite patrons and artistsof Chichén Itzá. 



Discussion 
As is almost always the case with discoveriesbearingontheTula–ChichénItzádebate,thenewmaterialsfromTulaChicoraiseasmanyquestionsas they answer. If significant aspects of the Tulastyle and at least that part of the iconographicrepertoirepresentatTulaChicooriginatedatEpi­classicTula, did they reach Chichén Itzá throughinteraction with later Tollan­phase Tula Grande,or was there already a relationship between thetwincities,withdirectcontactbetweenTulaChicoand Chichén Itzá? The incomplete (in the senseof both excavation and publication or documen­tation)natureofthearchaeologicalrecordatbothsitesmakesthisissueasmurkyasmostoftheoth­ers related to the Tula–Chichén Itzá exchange. Itmight appear that Epiclassic Tula was a small,

insignificant center, not a polity likely to play animportantroleinthelong­distance exchange thatcharacterizestheEpiclassic.Nonetheless,thesizeandextentofthecityduringthePradoandCorralphases is at present unknown (Cobean et al.2012:46). Prado ceramic material is mostly con­finedtoTulaChico,althoughit is alsoassociatedwith burials excavated near the present sitemuseum.MostoftheEpiclassicsettlementatTuladates to the Corral phase (Healan 2012:77–78).The surface distribution of Corral­phase ceramicsherds at Tula indicates a settlement of at least 4 and as many as 6 km2 in extent, with Tula Chicoas its civic­ceremonial nucleus(Healan 2012:78;Mastache et al. 2009:312).
There is evidence for construction at Tula Grande during the Epiclassic. Mastache et al.(2009:321)notetracesofpossiblePrado­to­Corralconstruction found by Jorge Acosta under thePalacioQuemadoand,morerecently,byCobeanunder the vestibule of the same structure and under Building K. Although the nature of thesestructures is hard to determine, they may repre­sentasecondEpiclassicceremonialcenterinthecity (Cobean et al. 2012:47), indicating greatersize, complexity, and possibly prestige for Tuladuring this period. Healan (2012:79), however,dates the earliest construction levels at Tula Grande to the Terminal Corral phase (A.D. 850–950), immediately after the fiery demise of TulaChico.Sterpone’s(2007:18,26–27,38–39)morecontroversial reinterpretation of architecturalstratigraphy and other archaeological data fromTula Grande attempts to push back the first con­structions and associated carvings at Pyramid Btopossiblyasearlyasca.A.D.700–750.Hepro­poses that the stages of Pyramid B currently vis­ible in the restored version predate the Tollanphase and represent an earlier core exposed bythelootingoftheTollan­phaseconstruction(Ster­pone 2007:26–27). Sterpone (2006) bases hisrevised chronology largely on a proposed Epi­classic ceramic phase, the Tula­Mazapa, whichhe defined from his excavations of the substruc­tures of Pyramid B and the Palacio Quemado.This complex displays similar types to the laterTollanphasebutamorerestrictedrangeofwaresand forms. He also reports an Epiclassic radio­carbon date from Tula Grande (Sterpone2006:275). Sterpone’s chronology is consistent with George Cowgill’s suggestion, based onradiocarbondatesfromMazapanburialsatTeoti­huacan, that Mazapan ceramics and the Tollanphase at Tula may date toA.D. 800–1000 ratherthanA.D.950–1150(Smith2007:583–584).Ster­ponehasnotyetpublishedthedetailsofhisstrati­graphicdata,andhisrevisedsequenceisrejectedby Cobean (Smith 2007:583–584). Healan(2012:84) criticizes Sterpone’s Tula­Mazapaphasefor not offering any improvement over theconcept of the Terminal Corral phase. Healan(2012:85)alsooffersastrongrebuttalofboththequantitative methodology behind Sterpone’sinterpretation of the radiocarbon evidence andhis assessment of the stratigraphic context of thesample.
However the controversy over the beginningsofTulaGrandeisresolved,thestyleand imageryof the sculpture at Tula Chico suggest ties toXochicalco and Cacaxtla and participation in theinterregional elite political­pilgrimage networkthatRingle,Bey,andNegrón(1998)identifiedasthe Epiclassic feathered serpent cult. Ringle andBey(2009:332)suggestthatChichénItzábecamearegionalTollaninthesameeliteideologicalnet­work around A.D. 700. Part of the iconographicevidence for their arguments, the “feathered ser­pent”imageryatbothPiedrasNegrasandChichénItzá, is questionable because it consists in part ofrepresentations that Taube (1992, 2000) has con­vincingly identified as the Teotihuacan War Ser­pent. This was part of Teotihuacan wariconography present in the Maya area since theEarly Classic. Nonetheless, Ringle et al. (1998)suggestanearlydate(ca.A.D.700)fortheincep­tionofthecenotecultatChichénItzá,whichtheyassociate with Teotihuacan war imagery (what­everthespecific identity of theassociatedophid­ians), and observe that Tula­style atlatls, darts,andfendingsticksareamongtheearliestofferings(RingleandBey2009:333–334).Thiswouldsup­port contact with central Mexico during the Epi­classic heyday of Tula Chico.
If there were interactions between Tula and Chichén Itzá at this early date, how, if at all, isthis reflected in the archaeological record? Beyand Ringle (2007:378) note that there are fewceramic imports in Epiclassic Tula, except forVeracruz materials, and they date all importedMayaceramicmaterialatTulatotheTollanphase.

Nonetheless, there may be evidence for ceramicconnections between Tula and Chichén Itzá as earlyastheTerminalCorralphase(KowalskiandKristan­Graham 2007:43). Hourglass braziersappear at Tula in Terminal Corral contexts,althoughtheyaremorecommonduringtheTollanphaseandareassociatedwiththeSotutacomplexatChichénItzá(BeyandRingle2009:391).Addi­tionally,accordingtoSterpone(2007:41),Maya­style ceramics—either imports or local imitations—that date toA.D. 850–950 were dis­coveredinthe1980sduringexcavationsofupper­class habitations and burials in the area of the current site museum. On this basis, as well as onthe basis of artistic parallels, Sterpone (2007:6)suggeststhatTulawastherecipientofbothmate­rial artifacts and symbols from southeasternMesoamerica during the ninth century. Unfortu­nately, the specifics of wares, forms, and modesarelackinginSterpone’sdiscussion,andhissug­gestionscontradicttheassessment oftheexcava­torswhodatethesameburialstotheTollanphaseand identify only one import—Tohil plumbate—with one interment (Gómez et al. 1994:77–108).The sparse ceramic evidence for an EpiclassicconnectionbetweenTulaChicoandChichénItzá seems consistent with (and equally puzzling as)the scant evidence of ceramic exchange duringthe Postclassic, when central Mexican ceramics,with one or two exceptions, are not found atChichén.ThishasledBeyandRingle(2007:391,395) to conclude that “direct [ceramic] exchangebetween the two sites was almost nil.” The same authorssuggestthattheformsoflocallyproducedceramicsatbothsitessuggestsomesortofcontact,buttheirexamplesarenotplentiful,withtheonlyunequivocallyclearceramicevidenceofChichénItzá–Tula contact being the Tlaloc censers fromBalankanché (Bey and Ringle 2007:378).
Severalotherkindsofdatasupportthesugges­tion of early contact between the two centers. Acarved shell plaque showing a seated Maya rulerin Late Classic style was collected at Tula in thenineteenth century (McVicker and Palka 2001),and a Classic Maya polychrome vessel bearinganother image of a seated lord was excavated atthe site in the 1980s (Cobean 1990:488–493,lámina 222). Bey and Ringle (2007:378) suggestthatthe vasewasacquiredatTula during theTol­lan phase. Thus, these objects may have been antiquesorheirloomswhendeposited(andthere­fore doubly exotic, potent prestige objects).Together, these observations hint at Epiclassic/Late Classic contact between Tula and the Mayalowlands. Some art­historical evidence points inthisdirection,aswell.Inherdoctoraldissertation,Kristan­Graham (1989:7, 172) argued that theTula Toltec drew upon Late Classic Maya royalimagery and costume elements (like the afore­mentioned bloodletting knots) to create a visuallanguageofindividualrulershiplackingintheartofTeotihuacan.Ifthishypothesisiscorrect—andher comparisons are persuasive—such contactshad to occur during the Epiclassic because suchroyal figures are present in the art of Tula Chicodating to that time.
The reclining figures, raptors, felines, andVenus symbols at Tula Chico join other traitsshared by Tula and Chichén Itzá for which Tulahascleartemporalpriority,supportinga model ofreciprocalinteractionbetweenthetwocitiesratherthanmakingtheTulaabackwater,asKublerstig­matized it. It has been two decades since Taube (1994:214, 239) pointed out that objects ofturquoise and gold appear at Chichén Itzá in bothartistic representations and in the archaeologicalrecord. The use of these materials represents aclear discontinuity with Classic Maya traditionsand is both Postclassic and pan­Mesoamerican incharacter.AlthoughthethoroughAzteclootingofTula has apparently prevented the survival ofactual gold ornaments there, they are representedin the sculpture of the site. Moreover, turquoisemosaicshavebeenrecoveredinexcavationssince Acosta’s day and are depicted in painted reliefs.In Taube’s words, “arguments for the contempo­raneityofToltecChichenandClassicMayaortheMaya originsofTolteciconographymust explainthe widespread presence of turquoise at ToltecChichen” (1994:239).Another trait with possiblenorthern origins at Tula and Chichén Itzá is thechacmool.Nochacmoolshavebeendiscoveredto date at Tula Chico, but a Chalchihuites culturesculpture found at Cerro del Huistle, Jalisco, in acontext dated to around A.D. 550, is interpretedby its discoverer as the oldest known chacmool(Hers1989:63–85,Figures7–12).Itssimpleformsuggeststhatifitistrulyachacmool,itisanearlymanifestationofthissculpturaltype.Itsearlydateand the apparently strong connections between

Tula and the Chalchihuites culturemanifestedin art, architecture, and religion (e.g., Diehl1983:50;Jordan2013:251–253;Kristan­Graham2007) make a northern rather than Maya originfor this form likely and its appropriation byChichén Itzá from Tula possible (López andLópez 2000:25, 27).
All of this is not to argue for a shift from a“Mayacentric” model of the origin of the sharedfeatures of Tula and Chichén Itzá back to the old scenario of a Toltec invasion of Yucatán. In the age of social network theory and other complexmodelsofregionalinteraction,suchunidirectionalmodels look increasingly antiquated. Smith(2007:597) notes how improbable a Toltec inva­sion of Chichén Itzáwould have been given whatweknowofMesoamericanwarfare.BoththeTula Chico discoveries and the new chronologies forChichén Itzá again make possible a Tula Toltecpresence at the Yucatán center—not as invaders,butaselitevisitors,allies,andpilgrims.Thissug­gestionechoespreviousliterature.TauberejectsaToltecinvasionbutstillholdsstronglytoaphysicalTulaToltec presence at Chichén Itzá, although heagrees with almost all recent commentators that“[t]he iconography of Toltec Chichen suggests aself­conscious synthesis of Maya and Toltec tra­ditions” createdbytheItzáwho,liketheirClassicprecursors in the heyday ofTeotihuacan, activelyappropriated central Mexican iconography asso­ciated with warfare (Taube 1994:244). Kowalski(2007:276), likewise rejecting invasion, cautionsthat “we should not discount the idea that central MexicansfromTulamayhavevisitedorevenset­tled”atChichénItzá.LikeTaube,heinterpretstheshared architectural forms of the sites to be the result of Maya borrowing of ideas from Tula thatultimately originated in the Chalchihuites region(Kowalski 2007:296).

I have endeavored in this paper to beginthisprocess.Althoughmoredetailsregardingthe early history of the Tula style must await furtherexcavations at bothTula Chico andTula Grande,the Tula Chico evidence serves as a potentreminderthat,after130yearsofscholarlydebate,the perennial problem of the Tula–Chichén Itzáconnection is still far from resolved.

Note 
1. I use the term “Toltec” in quotes when referring to theTula­related art and architecture at Chichén Itzá to avoid the connotations of an equation of style with ethnic identity orputative evidence of foreign invasion that plagued much ofthe literature on the two sites in the last century. I employ theword without quotation marks to refer to the builders and in­habitants of Epiclassic through Early Postclassic Tula.
