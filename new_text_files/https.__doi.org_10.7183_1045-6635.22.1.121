
QUARRYING EVIDENCE AT THE QUISPISISA 
OBSIDIAN SOURCE, AYACUCHO, PERU 

Nicholas Tripcevich and Daniel A. Contreras 
Artifacts made from Quispisisa obsidian are widely disseminated in the Peruvian Andes, but the geological source of the Quispisisa geochemical type was only recently located in southern Ayacucho. Following the positive identification of the source in 1999 by Richard Burger and colleagues, we found evidence of broad quarrying activities in unexplored portions of the source area. We describe 34 quarry pits, some as large as 80 m across, together with evidence of early-stage lithic reduction at the source. We encountered high concentrations of reduction debris associated with more extensive knapping in two localities, but our preliminary evaluation of surface evidence suggests that much of the material quarried was removed from the area as intact nodules or after minimal reduction at the source area. 
Los estudios geoqufmicos de la obsidiana en los Andes Centrales han demostrado que la gran mayor(a de los artefactos pre­hispanicos hechos de obsidiana se produjeron utilizando materia prima de ocho fuentes, cada una de las cuales es distinta en tenninos de composici6n geoqufmica. De las ocho fuentes, material de Alea, Chivay, y Quispisisa predomina en las colec­ciones de todas las epocas prehispanicas. El tipo geoqu(mico de obsidiana llamado Quispisisa ocupa una posici6n importante en la historia de/ Peru prehr1panico, pues herramientas hechas de este material se han encontrado en muchos sitios de la costa y sierra de la parte norcentral de! pafs. Esos sitios se caracterizan par encontrarse dispersos en un amplio marco espa­cial y temporal, pues algunos se ubican en lugares distantes de lafuente y corresponden a epocas diver.ms, inclusive, algu­nas de ellas tan antiguas como el Preceramico Temprano. A pesar de esa importancia evidente, hasta lafecha solo se habfa uhicado la fuente, y faltaba cualquier exploraci6n y registro detallado de las ajloramientos de obsidiana y de las rasgos de explotaci6n humana de la wna. A partir del afw 2007 Tripcevich y Contreras visitaron la fuente ubicada par Richard Burger y sus colef{as en la wna de Huanca Sancos, Ayacucho; posteriormente en el aiio 2009 los autores, con el apoyo de unas cole­gas. ampliaban las investigaciones y como producto de ello han revelado que el area geograjica que abarca lafuente de obsid­iana tipo Quispisisa es mucho mas extensa de lo que se habfa pensado. Asimismo, han logrado documentar la existencia de varios rasgos de explotaci6n de lafuente tales coma: pozos de cantera, lascas de reducci6n inicial de material, y caminos, las mismos que evidencian la presencia de la actividad de la canter(a de obsidiana a una escala unica en los Andes.

American obsidians, a geochemical type known as "Quispisisa," which was first identified in the late 1970s in a broad study by Richard Burger and Frank Asaro (1977). This initial research demonstrated that the Quispisisa type was preva­lent in obsidian artifact assemblages from north­ern and central Peru. More recently, Richard Burger and Michael Glascock (2000, 2002) definitively identified the geological source area using samples collected from southern Ayacu­cho, Peru. However, in spite of its importance in Andean prehistory, the Quispisisa source area remains minimally explored. Here we report the results of recent reconnaissance trips during which we documented evidence of prehispanic obsidian quarrying at the Quispisisa source on a scale not previously described anywhere in South America.

Tripcevich & Contreras I QUARRYING EVIDENCE AT THE QUISPISISA OBSIDIAN SOURCE 

History of Research into the 
Quispisisa Obsidian Type 

In the 1970s Andean archaeologists began to sys­tematically examine the prehispanic distributions of portable artifacts made from nonperishable and geochemically distinct materials like obsidian (Burger and Asaro 1977; Burger et al. 2000; Glas­cock et al. 2007). Early research into the use of x­ray fluorescence and neutron activation analysis for geochemical sourcing of archaeological obsidian in the Central Andes by Burger and Asaro (1977) at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory identified an obsidian source that contributed the majority of the obsidian in archaeological collections from north­ern and central Peru throughout the duration of the prehispanic period. This geochemical type was first recognized in artifactual samples and named "Quispisisa type" from the Quechua term for shat­tered glassy stone (Burger and Glascock 2002:342-343). The geological source of this obsidian was initially thought to be located in the San Genaro area of Huancavelica in south-central Peru, but in 1999 the correct location of the geo­logical source of Quispisisa obsidian was identi­fied by Burgerand colleagues inAyacucho (Burger and Glascock 2000, 2002), 130 km to the south­east of the originally assigned location (Figure 1).1 Quispisisa obsidian is remarkable for its preva­lence in sites throughout north and central Peru, as well as for the long distances that it was transported in prehistory. Artifacts made from Quispisisa obsid­ian are encountered in small but persistent quanti­ties at sites many days' travel from the source beginning ca. 1800 cal B.C. For instance, at the second-millennium B .C. site ofHacha, 156 km dis­tant from the source in the coastal valley of Acarf, two-thirds of the 53 obsidian samples tested came from the Quispisisa source, and by the first mil­; Jenni um B .C. Quispisisa obsidian is found consis­tently at Chavfn de Huantar, 580 linear km to the north of the geological source (Burger and Asaro 
1977; Burger and Glascock 2009; Burger et al. 
1984:264; Burger et al. 2006:107; Nado 2007). 
Quispisisa obsidian was transported as far as the 
site of Pacopampa, nearly 1,000 km north of the 
source (see Figure l; Burger 1984; Burger and 
Glascock 2009). 
The actual location of the Quispisisa source was 
identified in 1999 during a brief reconnaissance trip (Burger and Glascock 2000, 2002) among lava flows south of the towns of Sacsamarca and Huanca Sancos, in the south-central Peruvian department of Ayacucho. Burger's team visited one major out­crop of obsidian in the area and collected samples that eventually confirmed the geological origin location of the Quispisisa obsidian type. However, due to time limitations they were unable to further explore the source area. A regional geological sum­mary (Castillo M. and Barreda A. 1973; Castillo 
M. et al. 1993:12) describes the formation con­taining the obsidian as corresponding to the Plio­Pleistocene geological unit known as the Barroso Group (TQ-ba), where it contacts the underlying Lower Miocene Castrovirreyna Formation (Tm-c). The Barroso Group consists primarily of lavas with breccias and volcanic agglomerates, while the top layers of the underlying Castrovir­reyna Formation are described as containing brown breccias in a tuffaceous matrix atop a sandy light tuff (Burger and Glascock 2002:355; Castillo M. et al. 1993:50-55). 
In July 2007 and August 2009 we visited the Quispisisa source area in order to collect geologi­cal samples of obsidian and explore any associated archaeological features. The goal was to conduct further archaeological exploration in the area of the deposit encountered by Burger's team and to inves­tigate outcrops in the region and better document the extent and variability of the Quispisisa type. The broad distribution of Quispisisa obsidian through­out the Central Andes is testament to its importance in prehistory, and we sought evidence related to pre­hispanic intensification of activities at the source and the type of labor involved in obsidian extrac­tion and initial reduction. 
The Cerro Jichja Parco Outcrops at the Quispisisa Source 
The 1999 reconnaissance trip led by Burger iden­tified a single exposure of Quispisisa-type obsid­ian, eroding from a bluff on the east side of the Urabamba River (Figure 2), referred to locally as "Queshqa" (Burger and Glascock 2002). During field visits in 2007 and 2009 we were able to con­firm that this exposure is part of a larger rhyolite dome complex, and artifact-quality obsidian match­ing the Quispisisa geochemical signature is avail­able in multiple locations. In addition, we have

documented evidence of obsidian extraction on a scale not previously reported anywhere in South America. 
In the Quispisisa source area the east bank of the Urabamba River contains multiple obsidian­bearing exposures. Accessing the source involves hiking for several hours along a prehispanic route from Chuecopampa, on the gravel highway that links the modem towns of Nasca and Huanca San­cos, to the Urabamba River (see Figure 2). Fol­lowing this prehispanic route, one enters the Urabamba River valley from the east after climb­ing through a band of rhyolite and approaching the Urabamba River from the east. The first obsidian deposits we encountered along this path were thin (< 5 cm) bands of heavily fractured obsidian in a matrix of tephra and perlite; we collected samples here but did not encounter any nodules of sufficient size to be useful as toolmaking material. Continu­ing west, the path crosses a low ridge that forms a
