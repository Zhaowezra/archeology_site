
INSIDE THE SUN PYRAMID AT TEOTIHUACAN, MEXICO: 2008-2011 EXCAVATIONS AND PRELIMINARY RESULTS 
Nawa Sugiyama, Saburo Sugiyama, and Alejandro Sarabia G. 
After more than a century of explorations at the Sun Pyramid in Teotihuacan, many uncertainties about the function, mean­ing, chronology, and use of the monument remain unresolved. Here we present preliminary results from excavations and mapping conducted by the Sun Pyramid Project to address some of these issues. We focus particularly on describing the architectural features excavated in the interior of the pyramid as well as the subterranean tunnel. This evidence is used to argue that the subterranean structure was artificially constructed for ritual activities, including the placement of royal buri­als and/or offerings in its interior. We define three stages in the construction sequence of the Sun Pyramid: ( 1) a Pre-Sun Pyramid phase, (2) the establishment of the main corpus of the monument, and, finally, (3) the adjoining of the adosada platform. In each phase, we discuss the presence of burials, offerings, or other features uncovered. Furthermore, we pre­sent the results of new ceramic and radiocarbon dates that transform our understanding about the construction of the cer­emonial center, where the Sun Pyramid and the subterranean tunnel are dated to a later phase than previously thought, from A.D. 170-310 and A.D. 140-240, respectively. 
Despues de mds de un siglo de exploraciones en la Pirdmide del Sol en Teotihuacan, muchas inc6gnitas acerca de la funci6n, el simbolismo, la cronologfa y el uso def monumento permanecen sin re so/verse. Aquf presentamos las resultados preliminares de las excavaciones y el mapeo realizados por el Proyecto Pirdmide de/ Sol para desentrailar algunas de estas cuestiones. Nos concentramos particularmente en la descripci6n de algunos rasgos arquitect6nicos excavados en el interior de la pirdmide, as[ coma en la estructura subterrdnea, conocida coma la "cueva sagrada," que corre par debajo de dicha pirdmide. Uti­lizamos esta evidencia para argumentar que la estructura subterrdnea fue construida artificialmente para actividades rituales, incluyendo la colocaci6n de tumbas reales y/u ofrendas en su interior.

sequence of production, and use of the monument remain unresolved. 
One of the main reasons why such information was not gathered systematically was because many of the materials recovered from the pyramid con­sisted of fragments primarily from superficial lay­ers, including post-pyramid constructions or disturbed layers, except for some discoveries in the interior that we discuss later. Similarly, many ini­tial interpretations were based on fragmentary data , often from poorly published or unpublished explo­rations. The possibility of a royal grave at the Sun Pyramid remains uncertain and earlier structures , burials , or offertory caches that have been said to exist are not well defined (Batres 1906a; Millon and Drewitt 196 1; Noguera 1935; Perez 1935 , 1942). Consequently, the site has been interpreted as a religious center with a sacred "cave," refer­ring to the subterranean tunnel that was claimed to be the central feature that oriented the urban lay­out of this exceptionally populous city (Heyden 1975; Taube 1986). 
A contrasting perspective has been derived from new explorations at other major pyramids in Teotihuacan. Intensive investigations were carried out at the Feathered Serpent Pyramid (FSP) in 1988-1989 (Cabrera et al. 1991) and at the Moon Pyramid in 1998-2004 (Sugiyama and Cabrera 2007; Sugiyama and Lopez 2007) , both providing substantial information concerning state ideology and political organization. Results from both pro­jects suggest that the ruling group was highly con­cerned with materializing their worldview by incorporating astronomical movements and a cal­endar complex into monumental constructions and sacrificial rituals. The dedicatory and sacrificial deposits found in these monuments directly allude to the centralized rulership involving powerful individuals, which was symbolically proclaimed through ritual activities at the major monuments , emphasizing militarism (Sugiyama 2005, 2010). These explorations also suggest that the Sun Pyra­mid contains similar data about the nature of the ruling entities and that, combined with the data from the Moon Pyramid and the FSP, we would be able to gain a diachronic perspective on how the Teotihuacanos constructed and embedded political messages into the highly dynamic sacred landscape at the ceremonial core throughout its development. 
With these objectives in mind, a team led by Saburo Sugiyama re-explored the interior of the pyramid and the "cave" under it in 2008-2011 with specific objectives and strategies as a part of the Sun Pyramid Project directed by Alejandro Sara­bia G. The project obtained data about building episodes and a series of burial and dedication offer­ings, as well as information about the functions of the ancient tunnel , complemented with abundant chronological information. We present the results from radiocarbon samples taken from primary con­texts from the excavations and discuss their impli­cations within the context of the rising ceremonial center at Teotihuacan. 
Objectives and Strategies 
The project goals were inspired by long-term research interests during the excavation and map­ping at the ceremonial center. However, despite the long trajectory of research at the Sun Pyramid, data from these excavations were scarce and did not contextualize the Sun Pyramid within the greater ceremonial core. By excavating the interior spaces of this monument and the subterranean tunnel, we hoped to develop a more holistic understanding not only of the construction and meaning behind these large pyramidal structures, but also of its rela­tion to the highly dynamic socio-political land­scape of Teotihuacan during a period of rapid growth and concretion of state power. Thus , our fieldwork was carried out with concrete objectives by means of pit, trench , and short-tunnel excava­tions at specific locations. Because the pyramid has been explored intermittently during the past century, we tried to accomplish our goals effec­tively based on previously uncovered structures or tunnels excavated by former researchers. 
Batres ( l906b) described the monument as com­posed of a single stage built of a homogenous fill. He further discussed some of the key discoveries , including the presence of child burials in seated positions at every comer of every level of the pyra­mid. Based on these observations, some researchers inferred that the Sun Pyramid was dedicated to the rain god called Tlaloc in Aztec times , referring to postclassic mythologies and traditions associated with child sacrifice to that deity (Heyden 197 5, 
198 1). However, it seems that only one individual was preserved well enough to document in any

great detail, and there is a possibility that Batres's sketch was a hypothetical reconstruction. In addi­tion, major monuments continued to be used for mortuary practices in post-Teotihuacan periods, as demonstrated by Burial 1, found at the northwest comer of the Moon Pyramid, which dates to a post­colonial period or modem times (Sugiyama and Lopez 2007:127). At any rate, the association of the monument with the rain deity was not based on clear archaeological evidence. This large-scale pro­
ject by Batres ( 1906) ended with the consolidation of the pyramid in its present form. 
Following this initial project, several researchers explored interior spaces in pursuit of tombs or spe­cial features, all of which attempts ended in vain (Matos 1995b). Manuel Gamio (1922) began exca­vations of a tunnel into the main body of the pyra­mid from its posterior,eastem fa<;ade-at the height of the sloped surface at that time. Thus, his tunnel ran approximately 6.8 m higher than the current sur­face level, penetrating the monument along the east-west axis. Later, George Vaillant (1932, 1938) excavated a short tunnel running northward near the end of Gamio's tunnel. Another tunnel was excavated by Eduardo Noguera (1935) in 1933 along the central east-west axis, this time initiating the tunnel from the western fac;:ade of the adosada platform at the height of the present plaza floor. Noguera 's tunnel reached close to the center of the pyramid, where this tunnel was connected with Gamio 's tunnel by a flight of stairs. Another short tunnel, around 9 m in length, was excavated by Remey Bastien (1947) at the end of Noguera's tun­nel, running northward. These excavations revealed that the pyramid core basically consisted of earth layers without special features, although a series of post holes, and certain concentrations of ceramics and other materials that could have been parts of offerings, were reported. 
Rene Millon and his team conducted excava­tions in 1959 to re-examine possible early struc­tures in the Sun Pyramid. As a result of recording old profiles from Noguera's excavations and con­ducting some test pit excavations, Million's team was able to define the presence of an early wall (see following discussion) (Millon and Drewitt 196 1) . In the early 1960s, a large-scale national project led by Ignacio Bernal (1963) further excavated asso­ciated buildings around the Sun Plaza complex when many other structures in the city's central area were uncovered to create the Teotihuacan archae­ological park as a major tourist attraction. Three areas were excavated by this project: (1) a tunnel running north-south, crosscutting Noguera's east­west tunnel at 57 m from the western entrance for 
2.2 m; (2) a tunnel 31 min length along the upper­most sector of the pyramid in an east-west orien­tation; and (3) a trench 11.5 m long along the north side of the pyramid at the base (Smith 1987). Sub­sequently, in 1968, Teotihuacan Mapping Project (TMP) members dug a trench 3 min length and up to 4.25 m deep from the floor of this upper tunnel (TE 22) (Rattray 1975, 200 1 :55-57). These exca­vations not only demonstrated the presence of later ceramic assemblages than those from its base (Rat­tray 1975; Smith 1987), but also delineated previ­ous building episodes of the Sun Pyramid (Millon 1992:360-36 1; Smith 1987). 
When a "cave" was found accidentally under the Sun Pyramid in 1971, the possibility of finding a royal grave was again explored, among other pos­sibilities (Heyden 1975) . Unfortunately, there is very scant documentation of the archaeological investigations that took place in this tunnel, mostly because it was heavily looted in antiquity, and the archaeologist Jorge Acosta, who was in charge of clearing and consolidating the materials from the excavations, passed away soon after the discovery without publishing the project 's findings. Thus, speculations as to the function of the subterranean tunnel as a royal grave remain unresolved. Instead, Mesoamerican myths of sacred caves, mainly described in postclassic documents, were attached to the pyramid (Heyden 198 1; Millon 1992; Taube 
1986). 
The information gathered through Heyden 's ( 1975) work, and later from small scale excavations and mapping conducted within the subterranean tunnel by the TMP members, demonstrates that there was a strong emphasis on water/rain sym­bolism due to the presence of stone drainage chan­nels, manhole-type covers, shell, and tiny fish spines (Millon 1992:387). This explanation, apply­ing cave origin myths at Teotihuacan, is weakly based on archaeological data with no direct chrono­logical assessment. Nonetheless, the idea influ­enced subsequent interpretations concerning the city's origin, planned city-layout, and the meanings and functions of the Sun Pyramid itself . Recently, researchers also have suggested that the "cave"

was a man-made tunnel, stressing its function, which parallels the use of many other quarry tun­nels located on the east side of the pyramid that were created to extract construction materials (Barba, et al. 1990; Manzanilla, et al. 1994). 
Later, the Sun Pyramid complex was again explored extensively by Eduardo Matos (1995a), particularly on its north and east sides and the sur­rounding platforms, leaving the pyramid almost completely free from post-Teotihuacan layers. Small-scale excavations took place around the pyramid continuously in the 2000s (Sarabia 2002). Consequently, the Program of Investigation and Conservation at the Architectural Complex of the Sun Pyramid, Teotihuacan (hereafter called the Sun Pyramid Project), of the Instituto Nacional de Antropologia e Historia was formed in 2005 under the direction of Sarabia to explore buildings in the Sun Pyramid complex, with a strong focus on the preservation of the monument (Sarabia 2008). 
Despite the continuous investigations on the Sun Pyramid, some of the major questions con­cerning the construction and use of the space remain unresolved. In particular, it has not been demonstrated conclusively when the Sun Pyramid was constructed, although many authors have sug­gested the relatively early construction of the mon­ument, dating to the Tzacaulli period (A.D. 1-150) or earlier (Millon 1960; Millon, et al. 1965; Noguera 1935; Vaillant 1938). There is also a need to define the building sequence of this monument, including if and where ritual activities such as the dedicatory caches and burials took place. 
Explorations 
This paper concentrates on preliminary results of two field seasons (2008-2009 and 2010-2011) con­ducted in the interior of the monument. Sarabia began excavations at the Sun Pyramid complex in 2005, focusing on architectural units surrounding the pyramid. Starting in 2008, with the incorpora­tion of S. Sugiyama and his team, this project ini­tiated new excavations inside the monument, concentrating on two major areas. A series of strati­graphic pits were placed along the archaeological tunnel excavated by Noguera (Front C), and the project conducted preliminary exploration of the ancient tunnel that runs under the Sun Pyramid (Front D). Excavations outside the pyramid were conducted continuously by Sarabia at various areas (Front A, B, E, and F) until the fall of 2013 (Sara­bia 2002, 20 12; Sarabia and Sugiyama 2009), but those excavations will not be discussed in this arti­cle. This project was also complemented by the three-dimensional map of the ceremonial center that had been created by the Moon Pyramid Project, including the Sun Pyramid complex and these two excavation areas (Sugiyama and Cabrera 2007). 
Front D 
Only minor excavations were carried out in Front 
D. Our exploration was based on the systematic and detailed mapping of the subterranean tunnel uti­lizing a total station, distinguishing architectural features from the carved bedrock shape of the struc­ture. The result of this precise three-dimensional mapping led us to conclude that this tunnel was completely artificially constructed, contrary to pre­vious interpretations that this was a natural feature that was later modified (Heyden 1975). Our argu­ment is heavily based on consistent patterning and intentional directionality of this subterranean fea­ture in each of its three sections (Figure 1). Section A includes the entrance and the four large rectan­gular spaces connected to each other (42.2 m long along the east-west axis of the city, not taken diag­onally; all measurements will be given in this for­mat). Section B is where small enclosures are defined by walls along the meandering tunnel ( 43 .7 m). Finally, this narrow passage leads to a large opening at the end, named section C, that sprouts into a four-petaled chamber ( 11.4 m). 
The entrance of the tunnel, roughly square with rounded comers (2.8 m north-south by 2.9 m east­west), is set into the tepetate (volcanic tuffbedrock) layer and extends vertically for 6.5 m, reaching the hard basaltic layer. On the superior walls of this entrance in several locations, one can still appre­ciate the carved hand ledges that were probably used to enter or exit this space. From the tunnel floor, a steep talud (a slopping wall) was con­structed facing east to form the western base of the entrance. This wall is currently 2.5 m high and cov­ers 1.5 m, the total width of the entrance atthe base. It is made of a prepared fill with basalt rocks, tezan­tle (porous volcanic rock), tepetate, and some lajas (flat stones) placed on its exterior face that were cemented together with a mixture of mud and gravel (crushed volcanic scoria), covered with a

smooth aplanado (typical Teotihuacan cement) fin­ish. The degree of inclination and the location of the taludwall, connected to the western wall of the entrance, suggests that the wall once functioned as the main staircase. 
From this square entrance, a horizontal tunnel­similar in form to the shaft tombs recorded else­where in Mesoamerica -travels eastward, meandering for 97.4 m until it reaches the four­petaled terminus. Section A is represented by four elongated open areas that were never filled in, and thus possibly continued to be utilized even after the closure of the walls in section B. This is supported by Sload's (2007 :25) report, which describes car­bon concentrations in a test pit dug by the TMP, including samples from a fire pit that was enclosed by a concrete floor, suggesting that activities took place in this open area. The dividing walls from sec­tion B were sealed, prohibiting access to its inte­rior, but it is apparent that these walls were later

destroyed, and the fill was disturbed by looting practices during the Teotihuacan occupation. 
Section B demonstrates standardized dimen­sions, with the average width of the tunnel mea­suring 2.3 m wide with approximately .6 m maximum variability in each of the 18 sections, delineated by the 17 dividing walls along the length of this sector. As discussed elsewhere (Sugiyama 2005, 2010; Sugiyama and Lopez Lujan 2007), the number 18 has been repeatedly emphasized as important in Teotihuacan cosmology, particularly in relation to offerings and burials, and it is no sur­prise to find this number represented in this sub­terranean structure. Very little information is left on the function of Section C, as it was the area most heavily disturbed, and we still have not conducted any additional excavations in this area. 
Upon mapping this horizontal tunnel, it became apparent that its shape, width, and height were too standardized to be natural. Both the height of the floor and roof demonstrate minimal variation: the floor averages 2,287 .8 m asl with .5 m fluctuation, and the roof averages 2,289.9 m asl with .6 m variability. 

A general inspection and cleaning of the tunnel was conducted to look for any significant features or artifacts on the surface to recover what looters might have left behind in disturbed layers, partic­ularly focusing on the entrance of the tunnel. Despite the small amount of soil removed, a few prominent artifacts were documented during this surface survey and cleaning, including two rec­tangular greens tone objects -one that was 2 .3 x 1.3 cm and another, 1.4 x .7 cm, that were polished on both sides. There was also a pentagonal fragment of a pyrite disc with slate backing (7 .5 x 6.4 cm) with a conical perforation on one side. The only artifacts described in detail from Acosta's explo­rations are slate disc fragments identified as parts of tezcauitlapilli, pyrite mirrors with engraved slate backings (Heyden 1975:Figure 3; Villa-C6rdoba et al. 2012). The current example from the Sun Pyra­mid Project excavations confirms that multiple discs were placed in the subterranean structure. Two small mica fragments (3-5 cm long), small bead pendants, and a projectile point were also recovered from the disturbed layers. These small scraps of artifacts remaining at the entrance of the cave in the disturbed layers were apparently left during looting activities, possibly taken from buri­
als or offering caches located further inside the ancient tunnel. 
Subsequently, two pits were excavated at the entrance of the tunnel -one placed within the talud structure from its superior surface, and another just in front of the wall along the floor of the tun­nel. This first pit, Pit I, was dug to a depth of 4.18 m to collect artifacts for dating (ceramics and radiocarbon samples) and to characterize the fill of the structure. This pit confirmed that the talud was the western limit of the subterranean tunnel and was probably constructed to place the stair­way to access this sacred space. The fill of this wall consisted mainly of tepetate fragments mixed with some rocks and stones, sometimes with lenses of dirt. The fill itself was generally soft and can be distinguished from natural tepetate sediments due to intrusions of earth, sand, carbon, and artifacts (mainly ceramics). 
In addition, a small 1 m2 pit (Pit 2) was placed immediately in front of the talud wall in order to understand the relation of the structure to the cave floor. This led to the di scovery of yet another frag­ment of a pyrite disc (7.35 x 9 cm). At least two layers of prepared surfaces were present -one that was a packed earth floor and another that was a pre­pared floor with mixed gravel and surface finish­ing. The latter was probably what the TMP members identified as the "Teotihuacan concrete" floor (Sload 2007 :5). Most likely these floors would have been utilized for various activities in the open areas of Section A. 
Despite the incomplete nature of the investiga­tion from this front, several general interpretations can be reached about the function and use of this subterranean tunnel. We argue that this feature is artificial, was constructed during the Teotihuacan occupation, and does not represent a natural "cave" as originally interpreted, as several scholars have demonstrated from a geophysical argument (Man­zanilla et al. 1994). Whereas these authors stress the importance of subterranean features as a quarry site, just like the series of extraction tunnels exca­vated to the east of the Sun Pyramid, we suggest that the ancient tunnel underneath the Sun Pyra­mid was utilized for the placement of special deposits, possibly as a location where high-status (royal) individuals were buried. This is supported by previous researchers who utilize ethnohistoric sources to demonstrate a close association between

the "cave" at Teotihuacan and ancestor bundles, child sacrifices, oracles, and elite tombs (Headrick 2007:62; Heyden 1981). More detailed interpreta­tions as to the function and use of this subterranean feature can be read in Sugiyama (2011). 
On a final note, we add that recent explorations of a different subterranean tunnel in the Ciudadela complex, led by Sergio Gomez Chavez (20 13), may help us understand their meaning and func­tion. This tunnel starts several meters in front of the FSP and runs directly toward the interior of this structure. Like the one inside the Sun Pyramid, this tunnel is artificially constructed, and several strik­ing parallels can be drawn despite the scarce infor­mation published to date. In the fill of the entrance of this structure, as Gomez (2013) reported, there were elaborate artifacts, including some green­stone, shell, slate, and ceramics that were also iden­tified at the Sun Pyramid. Furthermore, Gomez has access to a more pristine context. While we wait to hear more about their excavations, we can only roughly highlight these similarities that suggest that these two features were probably constructed in relation to each other and for a similar function. 
Front C 
The focus on excavations at this front was toward opening test pits along the floor level of Noguera 's tunnel (Figure 2). This was because Noguera 's tun­nel had been placed a couple of meters above bedrock level, leaving intact the area where the foundations of the monument or any burials or caches would have been placed. With only descrip­tions of the fill from Millon and colleagues (I 965) and general profiles published based on pho­tographs, the Sun Pyramid Project focused on char­acterizing several aspects of the construction sequence of the Sun Pyramid.

The field season began by opening a tunnel to the center of the monument along the bedrock layer. The three-dimensional maps demonstrated that Noguera 's Tunnel had failed to reach the central north-south axis because the central point was cal­culated taking into consideration the adosada plat­form, which was a later construction. Thus, this tunnel excavation was meant to characterize the center of the monument itself, obtain artifacts to date this construction, and to verify whether offer­ing-burial complexes such as the ones discovered in the FSP and the Moon Pyramid tended to be located along axial lines (Cabrera, et al. 199 1; Sugiyama and Lopez 2007). After excavating a pit (Pit 2) at the very end of Nogera's tunnel to reach the tepetate layer, a tunnel (Tunnel 1) 9.6 m in length, was dug eastward. 
The center was marked by a carpet of coarse stones nearly 5 min length that were horizontally laid out directly above the tepetate layer, with a large boulder placed at the core of this concentra­tion (Figure 3). The stratigraphy clearly demon­strated that it was from this point that the soil was mounded on top to initiate this monumental con­struction (Figure 4). The pyramidal structure was created by mounding dirt fill layers mixed with tepetate fragments, with hardly any stone or adobe bricks. The prepared fill is made of varying ratios of soil, ground bedrock chunks, and sand mixtures, alternating with several layers of silty sand, inter­preted by Millon as water-laid deposits (Millon, et al. 1965). This is in contrast to previous researchers ' characterization of the pyramid as being con­structed with adobe blocks (Batres l 906a; Millon, et al. 1965). In fact, despite thorough sampling along the tunnel's length, we have yet to identify adobe bricks within the fill of the pyramid. The high concentration of artifacts and carbon fragments in the fill suggests that it was brought in from surface debris. 
The characteristics of the Sun Pyramid fill are very different from those of the other two major monuments. Temporal variability occurred within the Moon Pyramid fill. The first three phases were built by mounding earth and rocks, whereas sub­sequent buildings were constructed by filling in cells with large volcanic rocks (basalt, andesite, and tewntle), earth, and crushed tepetate fragments. Building 4 of the Moon Pyramid was unique because prepared adobe bricks and tepetate blocks

were neatly stacked to enlarge the previous mound (Sugiyama and Cabrera 1999). 
The FSP was constructed using a series of roughly made walls of stone, set in mud mortar strengthened with zacate (plant material), which crossed perpendicularly to each other, in some cases forming cells that were then filled in (Cabrera et al. 1991:81). The highly prepared and organized core of the FSP was drastically different from the Sun Pyramid fill, with lower densities of artifacts and evidence that the fill refuse was quarried for constructing a particular and highly homogeneous mud substance. 
After confirming the lack of any offering/bur­ial complexes at the central point, we began by sys­tematically sampling pits along Noguera's tunnel every 1.5 to 3 m, allowing us to characterize the fill of the pyramidal structure, obtain datable artifacts, find activity areas where rituals such as offerings and burials took place, and attempt to reconstruct the construction sequences within the monument. Based on what was discovered in these pits, tun­nel excavations targeted specific architectural units and burials/offerings. In total, these project objec­tives and strategy led to the exploration of sixty stratigraphic pits and three short tunnel excava­tions. This sampling methodology has defined sev­eral architectural features, four burials, and two offering complexes, and we consider it sufficient to characterize any major changes within the con­struction sequence. One of the most important results of this investigation was the discovery of pre-Sun Pyramid structures that allowed us to reconstruct three phases: (1) a pre-Sun Pyramid phase; (2) the construction of the main corpus of the Sun Pyramid and the associated destruction of pre-Sun Pyramid structures; and (3) the erection of the adosada platform and later enlargement pro­grams. Particularly relevant is that the pre-Sun Pyramid structures held a non-domestic function, implying that the location chosen to construct the Sun Pyramid was where other previous public structures had stood. 
Phase 1: Pre-Sun Pyramid Structures 
It is becoming evident that the ceremonial center of 
Teotihuacan was not an open space that was abruptly transformed into the monumental religious locus that we see today, but that it was preceded by other public structures and smaller mounds that woulc have made this monumental transformation possi ble. For example, in the Ciudadela complex Sugiyama (l998a) and Gazzola (2009) have iden tified the presence of pre-Ciudadela structure: including a canal system that was contemporru; with a major avenue that eventually became the Avenue of the Dead before the FSP was built. Sim ilarly, the Moon Pyramid was initially a mino mound during the earliest phases, and it was on! during the fourth construction sequence that i reached a monumental scale (Sugiyama and Cabr era 2007). At the Sun Pyramid, we identified three architectural units that preceded the construction o the Sun Pyramid: they are called Wall Consolidate< by Millon, Floor 2, and Structure 1 (Figure 2). Al of these features were cut or destroyed prior to thei being buried completely during the erection of th monument. Thus, in all three units, it was impossi ble to record the complete dimensions of the struc tures. Nevertheless, we were able to confirm th antiquity of this locus as an important center wher1 other structures had stood. 
Wall Consolidated by Millon 
One of the first architectural units defined was : wall that was previously excavated by Millon am his team in 1959 (Millon et al. 1965). It was placee at 57 m from the entrance of Noguera's tunne where we uncovered both sides of the wall that run north-south. Currently, it stands only about I m higl and around 70 cm wide and is made of large cob bles and boulders that were consolidated witl cement by previous excavators. Millon and hi team (Millon and Drewitt 196 1 :374; Millon, et al 1965 :25) mentioned that Mexican archaeologis Jorge Acosta and other members of the IN AH sub 

sequently excavated two tunnels approximately I m long to the north and south of this wall. How ever, they reported that the wall was cut on th< northern limit of the area defined by Millon am that the wall continued only for about 5 m south ward in a badly degraded state. Millon conclude< that this wall probably represented an earth-fillec structure that was not particularly grand and tha there is no information about the correspondini eastern wall (Millon, et al. l 965). During our exca vations, we did not identify the other side of tht wall, apparently because it was complete!) destroyed.

Floor 2 
Another architectural unit that pre-dates the con­struction of the Sun Pyramid is a well-prepared floor that extended 33 to 40 m from the entrance of Noguera's tunnel, measuring at least 7 min an east-west direction. This floor sat approximately 55 cm above the natural bedrock and was a typical Teotihuacan-style floor prepared with gravel that was smoothed and would have been plastered. It was composed of two flat surfaces that were joined by a sloping step 7 cm in height. It also contained two post holes and a large concentration of carbon that was burnt in situ (Figure 5). There were many microstrata of burnt carbon layers of varying inten­sity in this block, and some ceramic fragments were found inside this concentration. Upon abandon­ment, the floor was deliberately cut on both ends, and, in particular, we noticed the large concentra­tion of broken ceramics and other artifacts deposited just beyond the eastern limit. There is very little we can infer from these features, as we found no associated structure that would have ver­ified if this was an interior or exterior surface. The post holes, one round and another square, suggest that they supported poles, but to what purpose is not clear. Similarly, the altitudinal change along the floor smface is puzzling, and no logical functional 
purpose can be attributed at this point. Based on the high concentration of broken artifacts along the eastern limit, this sequence of events can be inter­preted as possibly being part of a termination rit­ual or linked to the subsequent construction of the Sun Pyramid. 
Structure 1 
The largest pre-Sun Pyramid structure identified thus far is Structure I , located at 108 m from the entrance of Noguera 's tunnel and only 12 m to the west of the center of the pyramid. This structure, defined by a vertical wall and an associated floor (Floor I), is characterized by a talud extending from the vertical wall on both sides. At the base of the structure, where the talud connects to the floor, the wall is up to 2 m wide, while the vertical wall measures approximately 90 cm wide (Figure 6). The construction of this wall was first marked by defining two vertical rows of stones that were filled in with mixed stone, bedrock chunks, and dirt to construct the vertical wall. Then the talud surface was attached by filling in the sloping wall at the

base on both sides with dirt and large bedrock chunks that were covered by a prepared gravel and an aplanado finish. 
This structure was first identified during test pit excavations. This led to our extending the excava­tions westward (Pit 18) to characterize the fill of the structure, which to our surprise resulted in the discovery of the western face of the wall. Thus, the second tunnel (Tunnel 2) was dug to the east of Structure 1 to further characterize the wall, partic­ularly the dimension and orientation of the struc­ture, and to obtain artifacts to date this construction. 
At a distance of 1.6 m into the tunnel, we suc­
cessfully exposed the well-preserved eastern face 
of Structure l with its associated floor (Floor I) and 
several features of interest. There were two breaks 
in the wall: (1) at 4.9 m from the entrance of Tun­
nel 2 where there was a comer, and (2) at 6.4 m 
where the wall abruptly stopped, only to re-appear 
at 7.8 min depth (Figure 6). Finally, at a distance 
of 12.5 m, the taludbase trickled off and could not

be traced further (Figure 7). At this point, we char­acterized the wall of Structure I for at least 13 .5 m, but we know this structure extends northward for an undetermined length, which remains to be explored. 
Several preliminary conclusions can be drawn from this excavation. First, this structure was not a filled structure, such as a pyramid or altar, judg­ing from its distinct architectural design, which includes a well-finished aplanado surface on the taludand vertical walls on both sides. Second, the size of the structure was substantial, not only because of the length documented so far (13 .5 m), but also because of the massiveness of the foun­dation with its thick vertical walls. Third, there was at least one comer of a wall that was either an entry­way or was later expanded by the continuation of a wall, suggesting a rebuilding phase of Structure 
l. Last, this architectural style is unique to Struc­ture I -unlike other walls with talud and vertical walls finished on both sides, this one did not con­tain a narrow flat shoulder where the taludsurface joins the vertical wall. All of these conclusions led us to understand Structure 1 as a non-domestic structure that served a public function; it was unique in both dimension and architectural style. 
Unlike other early structures at Teotihuacan, such as the Pre-Ciudadela structures and Building 1 of the Moon Pyramid that deviated from the later standardized Teotihuacan orientation (Gazzola 2009; Sugiyama and Cabrera 2007), Structure l is aligned along the standard Teotihuacan north-south orientation. What is puzzling-similar to the case of the wall consolidated by Millon-is that we found only one wall with these characteristics throughout all the pit and tunnel excavations that had been conducted thus far. This raises several interpretations: it was a free standing wall; the other parallel wall was completely destroyed; the wall stands to the east of Tunnel I; or, despite the sys­tematic sampling, the other side remains unex­plored. Although we cannot resolve this issue, we hypothesize that Structure 1 probably delineated a public and/or sacred space. 
Burial 2 
Excavations in Tunnel 2, along with a series of intensive pits dug in the vicinity of Structure 1 , led to the discovery of several features, including an offering complex (Offering 1) and three burials. Most of these features probably date to when Struc­ture I was terminated or cut and were covered to construct the Sun Pyramid. Therefore, they will be discussed in more detail in the subsequent section. However, one burial was found fairly close to Struc­ture l, where we stratigraphically confirmed the antiquity of the burial that pre-dates the construc­tion of this structure. 
The burial was found 106 m from the entrance of Noguera 's Tunnel to the west of Structure 1 in Pit 17, named Burial 2 .1 Burial 2 contained a complete peri­natal infant deposited in a flexed position, accompa­nied by a small effigy vessel placed near the neck (Figure 8) (Archer 2009). The burial was excavated in the deepest levels, right above the bedrock layer that continues underneath Structure 1.

recovered from the systematic test pit excavations and was the phase to which the majority of the offerings and burial complexes dated. All of these features demonstrate that the body of the pyramid was erected during one construction phase. How­ever, this was a long process that included the place­ment of ritual offerings and burials both in the foundation and in the fill of the structure. Some of these deposits were associated with several pre-Sun Pyramid structures as well as the location of the sacred "cave" that runs underneath the monument. 
Burial 3 
Burial 3 was a secondary burial, placed 110 m from the entrance of Noguera's Tunnel, just to the west of Structure 1. It consisted of a portion of the cra­nium (temporal, parietal, frontal, and occipital bones) placed upright inside layer Via, an intrusive, mixed-fill layer above the floor of Structure 1. The bones of this individual were very small and unfused, identifying it as an infant between one and two years of age (Archer 2009). This burial was placed right next to the cut floor associated with Structure 1 when it was being buried to construct the monument. The context and the element dis­tribution suggest that this may be a fill inclusion. However, as multiple offerings and burials from the Sun Pyramid are found in the fill, this cranium is associated with a pre-Sun Pyramid structure, and because two other child burials were found in the vicinity, we designate this as a burial. 

Burial 4 
Burial 4, located 10 1 m from the entrance of Noguera's Tunnel (Pits 22 and 23) (Figure 9), was the only burial that was discovered within a pre­pared circular orifice around 70 cm in diameter. This burial was deposited in a sandy layer that cut into the sterile hard stratum just above the bedrock. The cranium presented a tabular-erect cranial defor­mation that was slightly altered postmortem due to the weight of the pyramid (Archer 2009). The den­tition demonstrated that this individual was between four and six years old. As the burial was uncovered 7 m to the west of Pit 5 where Structure 
1 was discovered, it was impossible to directly define the stratigraphic relationship between this burial and Structure 1. However, comparing char­acteristics of the soil, we hypothesize that this indi­vidual was most likely deposited when this structure was cut, digging the burial pit into older layers (Layers Vb and VI). After deposition, this child was buried with the fill of the Sun Pyramid during its construction. 
Offering 1 
We detected the presence of an offering cache (Offering 1) slightly to the east of Structure 1, placed in the middle of the fill that covered the structure entirely to construct the Sun Pyramid. Offering 1 was located in Tunnel 2, between .9 and 
1.4 m from its entrance (southern profile of Pit 4). The materials offered included several obsidian blades, a large marine conch shell, a group of pro­jectile points of various sizes, one pyrite disk, a large quantity of organic materials, and an obsid­ian anthropomorphic figurine. Underneath the disk, abundant organic materials were carefully laid out. Although the deteriorated state of the organic fibers made it difficult to reconstruct pre-

cisely, they seemed to form across close to the cen­ter of the disk. 
Offering 2 
Offering 2 was located 85 m inside of Noguera's Tunnel right along the bedrock layer where a large fossa (1.75 m north-south and 1.75 m east-west) was excavated. This offering was discovered while sampling pits along the length of the tunnel, where a concentration of obsidian blades, abundance of organic fibers, and several spiral shells appeared in the comer of Pit 59 within the fill. Excavating this pit to the bedrock layer, it soon became appar­ent that the offering chamber extended southward; therefore, we began to excavate the third tunnel, Tunnel 3, to fully expose the offering chamber. 
Artifacts included in this rich offering were com­posed of multiple layers of objects superimposed in concentrated areas. A diversity of material types and manufacturing techniques were represented in this offering cache such as obsidian, green stone, shell, pyrite , ceramics, and animal bones (Figure 10). The most abundant material was obsidian, including prismatic blades, miniature and large pro­jectile points, bifaces, and an anthropomorphic fig­
urine. Three pyrite disks with slate backings of dif­ferent sizes were placed along the bedrock surface of the pit, ranging from a little more than I 0 cm to 45 cm in diameter, representing the biggest disk dis­covered in situ at Teotihuacan. Underneath this large disk , a sizable rectangular slab , possibly of slate in the form of a seat, rested along the south­ern boundary of the offering chamber. 
A total of 11 complete Tlaloc vessels were deposited throughout the cache. Three exceptional greenstone objects were recovered from this offer­ing, including two full-body figurines and a mask (Figure 11). Two small spheres identified as pyrite were found very close to the mask and probably functioned as the eye inlays.2 Closely associated with this artifact was a series of miniature projec­tile points, almost graphically piercing the cheek/eyes of the mask. 
Several faunal remains were uncovered from the offering chamber, including one complete eagle (Aquila chrysaetos) that had consumed two rabbits (Sylvilagus sp.), a puma (Puma concolor) skull with its associated claws, a wolf (Canis lupus bai­leyi) skull, and the skull and extremities of a red­tailed hawk (Buteo jamaicensis).

objects were uncovered , including one large worked marine conch shell and eight small worked spiral shells.Abundant organic materials were also deposited, including a series of strips laid out in crosses, apparently indicating Teotihuacan 's east­west , north-south axes. 
Other Architectural Features 
A test pit (Pit 38) was excavated 14 m from the entrance of Noguera 's tunnel , where the western fa<;ade of the Sun Pyramid should appear if the adosada platform was a later construction. As expected , the foundation of the grand taludwall of the Sun Pyramid was recorded in this pit; it was defined by three large prepared stones placed as the foundation , coated by an aplanado made of gravel that connected it directly to the floor (Figure 12). Unfortunately, this area was poorly preserved. In particular, the aplanado was greatly degraded , making it difficult to delimit this layer more accu­rately. The profiles from this pit clearly demon­strated that part of the outer layers of the corpus of the pyramid were cut , leaving only the very bot­tom foundation stones in place , before the entire western faade of the pyramid was covered with the fill of the adosada. 
Phase 3: Adosada Platform 
By closely examining the ceramic and figurine assemblages from the fill of the pyramid, Noguera ( 1935) recognized a different assemblage in the first 16.5 m of the tunnel, corresponding to the location of the adosada platform , that consisted of a mixture ofTzacualli (A.D. 0-150) andMiccaotli 
(A.O. 150-200) ceramics, while the rest of the monument contained mainly very early forms of ceramics dating to Patlachique and Tzacualli (150 B.C.-A.D. 150) phases (Millon , et al. 1965). This indicated that the adosada platform was a later con­struction , added sometime after the completion of the corpus of the Sun Pyramid. Furthermore, it became apparent that a very complex construction sequence had taken place in the area immediately in front of the body of the pyramid before the adosada platform was annexed. 
During their excavations , Perez ( 1935) and Noguera ( 1935) highlighted the presence of a series

of architectural features, either platforms or stair­ways, within the present adosada platform. Millon and his team (1965:30) confirmed the location of various low stone walls within the platform recorded on the tunnel profiles and interpreted them to have possibly been independent structures in front of the main body of the pyramid. Unfortu­nately, all the original tunnel profiles were already consolidated by concrete walls in the 1960s, mak­ing it impossible to confirm the stratigraphic rela­tionship between our excavations and the position of the walls. Nevertheless, we have been able to independently confirm the presence of a complex construction sequence with multiple superimposed structural foundations, as recorded in our test pit 
excavations. 
Pre-Adosada Features 
Several feature s were identified during our excavations -some that may correspond to the low-lying walls discussed by Perez (1935) and Mil­lon et al. (1965); however, many of these features were composed of a single alignment of rocks, making it difficult to interpret their functions. For example , 12.5 m from the entrance of Noguera's tunnel, in Pit 31, among the concentration of rocks in layer III, there was a single row of prepared rocks in a talud form (Figure 12). Noticeably, this feature was placed higher in altitude (approxi­mately 25 cm) than the floor level of the body of the Sun Pyramid, and, more surprisingly, the talud was facing eastward. This means that this archi­tectural element was placed after the main pyra­mid body was built and that it stood independently in front of it. As only one row of this feature was conserved, its function or morphology cannot be defined. 
A few meters to the west of this feature in Pit 32 a slab alignment was identified (Figure 12). It was situated around the same height as the talud feature in Pit 31. The stratigraphic information sug­gests that they were contemporaneous, subse­quently covered by a rock-filled layer. With only one row of slabs present , it was unclear if it was a floor, wall , or some other architectural feature. 
Very close to the entrance of the tunnel, 4.5 m away, seven rocks were arranged facing west (Pit 51). This was placed around 2,294 m asl, around the same elevation as the talud surface of Pit 31. Again , only one row of well-aligned blocks was later covered by the fill of the adosada platform. Most likely, all of the features were destroyed, leav­ing only the foundation stones in place. As we exca­vated the western half of Pit 51, leaving the stone alignment in place to document the stratigraphic sequence , we came across another burial. 
Burial 5 
Burial 5 consisted of a minimum of two individu­als that were disarticulated and placed in a heap along with associated objects, including an obsid­ian flake, loose ceramic fragments, and one mono­chrome ceramic vessel (Figure 13). This burial was deposited right along the bedrock and was later disturbed by an intrusive pit. Noticeably, this stra­tum ran underneath the rock alignment previously mentioned, which suggests that the burial predates this feature. There was a very large intrusive pit, probably the result of a test pit excavated by Noguera. Its proximity to Burial 5 suggests that this excavation may have disturbed the burial, and could be the reason why one of the individuals was rep­resented solely by two articulated feet. 
The burial was excavated and analyzed with the aid of the physical anthropologist Ximena Chavez Balderas (Chavez and Quezada 2011). According to her report , the first individual represents a sec­ondary deposition of a concentration of bones including the cranium , mandible , left scapula , some metacarpals and metatarsals, and rib fragments. This individual is characterized by its robustness and is identified as a male of around 35-45 years of age. Detailed analysis by Chavez has demon­strated advanced stages of various dental and osseous deformities. The second individual was a primary burial, some of which was apparently dis­turbed during the excavations by Noguera. This individual was much more gracile than the first, but because only the two feet were discovered , the age and sex cannot be determined with accuracy. Need­less to say, the distinct depositional histories of the two individuals suggest that they did not die at the same time. There were no cutmarks or any other surface modifications to suggest postmortem treat­ment of the corpses. As neither of the two individ­uals were children, the burial contrasts drastically with the other burials discussed earlier, suggesting that its placement in the area outside of the main corpus of the Sun Pyramid corresponds to a dif­ferent burial custom.

Exterior Excavations 

Even after the completion of the corpus of the Sun Pyramid and the original adosada platform, ongoing modification, enlargement, and consol­idation efforts took place at the Sun Pyramid complex throughout the city's occupation. Exte­rior excavations, led by Sarabia (2002, 20 12; Sarabia and Sugiyama 2009) , recorded multiple enlargement and modification efforts to the adosada platform.

Similarly, the north, east, and south walls of the main body of the Sun Pyramid were covered by large talud fa<;:ades that were excavated and con­solidated by Batres ( l 906a) to its current exterior appearance. A large trench placed on the northern fa<;:ade confirmed the presence of at least two build­ing episodes (Smith 1987:Figure 2). Millon ( 1973 :Figure 17 a) dates this enlargement program to the Xolalpan period. On the western fa<;:ade of the monument, one can still observe the remains of the talud wall, which was built without sub­stantially modifying the size of the structure, as the adosada platform had already been built by this time. The Teotihuacano builders probably modified or enlarged the adosada platform, at the same time expanding the corpus of the pyramid on its north, east, and south sides. It is clear from these exterior excavations that the monument was never a com­pleted structure, but was a place where constant modification, enlargement, and consolidation pro­jects were continuously being carried out. 
Chronology 
Sun Pyramid (Front C) 
We utilized two dating techniques to establish a general understanding of the construction sequence at the Sun Pyramid: relative ceramic sequences and absolute radiocarbon dates. Most of the ceramics from the fill of the Sun Pyramid excavations have undergone preliminary sorting and analysis by Zeferino Ortega, who analyzed 37 ,746 sherds (Table 1). These are the results of a bulk sort gath­ered from all excavations from Front C, and sub­sequent detailed analysis from various key locations would further aid in our understanding of the Sun Pyramid construction sequence. As the overall abundance of Tzacualli materials represents (35,736 pieces, 94.7 percent), the pyramid was most likely constructed during this phase, which is dated from A.D. 1-150 according to Millon (1973:52, Figure 12) and Rattray (2001:53-57). 

These results are congruent with previous inter­pretations (Millon 1960; Millon, et al. 1965; Noguera 1935; Vaillant 1938). There are some Pat­lachique (5.2 percent) and Miccaotli (0. 1 percent) pieces, but their distribution must be examined in more detail. 
Here we present some of the results of new radiocarbon dates taken by the Sun Pyramid Pro­ject from the monument and the subterranean tun­nel and contextualize the results within the present discourse of the timing of the construction of these two structures. A total of seven samples from the interior of the Sun Pyramid (Front C) and one sam­ple from Pit 1 of the subterranean feature (Front D) were sent to Beta Analytic for radiocarbon dating (Table 2). Beta Analytic reported the conventional dates and calculated the calibrated dates utilizing the internationally agreed curve IntCal04 (Reimer et al. 2004) (PPS-I, 2,4-8) and Marine04 (Hughen, et al. 2004) (PPS-3). Probability distributions uti­lizing a Bayesian statistic program, OxCal v 4.2 (Bronk Ramsey 2009), were calculated with lnt­Cal09 (Reimer, et al. 2009) and Marine04 (Hughen et al. 2004) (Tables 2 and 3; Figure 14). Consider­ing that Millon and his colleagues (1965:33) were unsuccessful in obtaining any samples from pri­mary contexts from the Sun Pyramid, dating only small fragments from the fill, the seven samples taken from test pits from Front C represent the first secure dates taken from primary contexts from either pre-Sun Pyramid or Sun Pyramid contexts. Unlike the highly scattered results reported thus far, ranging from 484 B.C. ± 500 to A.D. 43 1 ± 200 (Millon et al. 1965:33), the samples taken by the Sun Pyramid Project are consistent in their results. Samples 1 and 2 were obtained from the con­centrated carbon bulk found above Floor 2 that was burnt in situ (Pits 29 and 27). The samples' inter­cept radiocarbon date is cal A.D. 240 (cal 18 A.D. 220-260 and cal 18 A.D. 290-320 [see Table 2 for 2oranges])andcalA.D.220(cal lOA.D. 130-240), respectively. The radiocarbon date defines when the wooden fragments burnt in this carbon concentra-

tion were cut. Consistent results between the two samples suggests this most likely reflects when the burning event took place, possibly as part of the termination ritual before the floor was cut on the eastern and western extremes. 
Sample 3 was taken from the fragments of a conch shell deposited in Offering 1, placed in the midst of the construction fill of the Sun Pyramid. This sample 's intercept radiocarbon date is cal AD. 220 (cal 18AD. 140-260). The fourth sample was taken from uncarbonized wooden fragments in a posthole (Pit 9) located directly on the bedrock around 80 m from the entrance of the tunnel. Sam­ple 4 's intercept radiocarbon result dates to cal AD. 350 (cal IO A.O. 260-290 and cal IO A.O. 32000) , representing the most recent date out of all samples. As the wooden beam was found sub­merged underwater, it was well preserved, but at the same time the water may have contaminated the sample , resulting in the recent date . It is sig­nificant that this sample was highly degraded and uncarbonized, requiring us to conduct AMS dating despite the large sample size. 
Two of the burials were also chosen for radio­carbon analysis. Sample 5 directly dates Burial 4, as it consists of a fragment of the tibia of this indi­vidual, which dates to cal AD. 220 (cal 10 A.O. 130-240). Sample 6, dating to cal AD. 250 (cal 10 AD. 230-330), was taken from a long bone frag­ment (probably of a tibia) of Burial 2. 
The seventh sample, extracted from an ash­enriched layer that runs underneath the floor level of Structure 1 in Pit 6, dated to cal AD. 90 (cal 10 AD. 60-130). This sample gave the earliest date, probably because the stratum either pre-dated Structure 1, or because such ash-rich strata could easily be dating old organic fragments of tertiary deposition . While this is the only radiocarbon sam­ple that agrees with the ceramic results, there is a solid pattern among other more secure primary samples that situates the monument's construction to a much later phase. 
There is a consistent pattern among secure, pri­mary contexts that the intercept radiocarbon dates range from around cal A.O. 220-250 (excluding PPS-4 and PPS-7 for reasons stated earlier). Unfor­tunately, the error ranges are far too wide, between cal 10 AD. 130-390, to be useful. In such cases, utilizing Bayesian statistics can refine a well­defined phase when a priori archaeological infor­mation is available (Beramendi-Orosco et al., 2009). Modeling all seven samples with the OxCal 
4.2 beta program (Bronk Ramsey 2009), suppos­ing that they were from the same phase , shows that the modeled dates range from cal 18 AD. 118-308 (cal 28 A.O. 79-337 28) (Table 2; Figure 14a). Sample 7 gave the earliest modeled date, probably because the stratum either pre-dated Structure 1 or because such ash-rich strata could easily be dating old organic fragments of tertiary deposition. Excluding sample 7, the modeled 18 range extends from cal A.O. 169 to A.O. 308 (cal 28 A.O. 121-39 1). 
Subterranean Tunnel (Front D) 
Unlike the Sun Pyramid, dating the construction and use of the subterranean tunnel underneath the monument presents several difficulties. Mainly, this is the result of the highly disturbed context as well as the lack of many primary contexts . Nonethe­less , recent re-analysis of the samples taken by the TMP excavations conducted in 1978 (Sload 2007), along with a single sample submitted by the Sun Pyramid Project, allows us to assess the antiquity of this structure. 
Sload's (2007) samples are derived from seven test pits in four locations in the tunnel. The ranges of the results are highly variable , with the intercept calibration date ranging from AD. 40 to A.O. 260 and 1 sigma calibrated ranges from 10 B .C. to AD. 350 (Table 3). Sload (2007:26) attributes such vari­ation to represent various stages of the construc­tion. She argues that these may have corresponded to the initial leveling of the subterranean floor and the subsequent application of the Teotihuacan con­crete along the floors and walls: the former dating to the middle of the first century and the latter not before mid-third century. However, by closely examining the context from which the samples were taken, it becomes apparent that many were carbon fragments from in between floors. It is also difficult to understand if the samples interpreted as fire pits may also be from highly carbon-rich lay­ers that were sometimes found within the fill of the Sun Pyramid, such as sample PPS-7. The fact that many of the fill fragments taken from lower levels have a later date than more superficial strata, as is the case with sample Beta-220760 (Sload 2007: 19­20) , demonstrates the problems with using tertiary fill fragments to date the construction phase.

Unfortunately, primary contexts are rare, and the Sun Pyramid Project was only able to collect a sin­gle sample from the subterranean feature (PPS-8). This sample, consisting of carbon fragments exca­vated from the nucleus of the talud structure in the entrance of the cave (Pit 1), dated to cal A.D. 130 (cal 10 AD. 80--210), suggesting an origin slightly earlier than the Sun Pyramid fill or maybe con­temporaneous with its construction. 
Similar to the Sun Pyramid materials, a model utilizing the OxCal 4.2 beta program (Bronk Ram­sey 2009) was run using solely samples that were reported from primary contexts from TMP exca­vations (Beta samples 220749, 220750, 220753, 220758, 208984, 220763, 220764). The results of the modeled dates were surprisingly consistent, ranging from cal A.D. 139-240 (lo range) (Table 3, Figure 14b), suggesting that construction of the subterranean feature was contemporaneous with or slightly earlier than construction of the monu­ment itself. In sum, radiocarbon models overlap sig­nificantly for the pyramid (A .D. 170-310) and the subterranean tunnel (A .D. 140--240), both of which were constructed around the beginning of the third century, much later than previously suggested. 
Constructing the Sun Pyramid and Subterranean Tunnel 
Excavations by the Sun Pyramid Project have led us to re-evaluate the role of this monument and its subterranean feature within the dynamic landscape of the ceremonial core at Teotihuacan. First, we were able re-evaluate the present evidence in the subterranean feature to conclude that it was artifi­cially constructed. This space was most likely built in association with the pyramid and probably held offerings and/or burials in its interior, which was sealed completely by a series of walls. There was a large talud structure at its entrance and four open areas were probably revisited and utilized for cer­emonial activities even after these walls were sealed. At some point during later Teotihuacan occupation, these walls were destroyed and the area was looted, leaving scant evidence behind when archaeologists rediscovered this feature. 
Second, excavations in Noguera' s tunnel helped characterize the construction sequence of the pyra­mid, which includes a pre-Sun Pyramid phase, the construction of the Sun Pyramid itself, and, last, the extension of the adosada platform. The pre-Sun Pyramid phase is the time period we knew least about in the development of the ceremonial center, and only recently, through extensive tunnel and pit excavations at the Moon Pyramid and the FSP, are we beginning to understand what was present at the ceremonial core of this metropoli s before the monumental explosion. Our excavations help com­plete the picture of this area, where smaller public structures would have already been central to the social landscape prior to the initial boom we see in public monumentalism so characteristic of Teoti­huacan. Two walls and one floor dating to this period were excavated, all of which were found cut and incomplete. As the presence of this structure and Burial 2 demonstrate, this area was already uti­lized for public ritual activities associated with child burials prior to the construction of the pyra­mid, suggesting the function and symbolic mean­ing of the location was present even before reaching a monumental scale. 
As the monument was constructed, pre-Sun Pyramid structures were destroyed or partially cut, possibly as part of a termination ritual, to be cov­ered by the fill of the pyramid. It is during this time that other child burials and offerings were placed in the nucleus. During this period, at least two buri­als and two offerings were deposited either in the middle of the fill or at the base along the bedrock. They included highly elaborate artifacts of finest quality, comparable to some of the offerings dis­covered in the Moon Pyramid and the FSP. Taking into consideration these ritual deposits and the scale of the monument itself, it is evident that this struc­ture played a central role in solidifying the sociopo­litical landscape at Teotihuacan. 
The monument was not a static feature once it was constructed, as exemplified by the later addi­tion of the adosada structure, and even more so by the scant evidence of multiple foundation stones in this area pre-dating the adosada platform. A bur­ial found in the adosada was very distinct in num­ber and age of the individuals from what was found inside the main corpus of the pyramid. The adosada was added sometime after the establishment of the main corpus of the pyramid, at which point the frontal fai;:ade was partially taken off, leaving only the foundation stones in place, to be filled in to con­struct the adosada platform in the form visible today. Exterior excavations along this platform also

confirm that multiple rebuilding phases of the adosada platform itself took place . Thus , we now see changes in the use and symbolism of this struc­ture with transforming architectural styles. 
To understand the role of the Sun Pyramid within the ceremonial core ofTeotihuacan, we must assess its chronological relation to other monuments . In this article , we present new ceramic and radiocar­bon results from the monument itself. We also dis­cuss the results of other samples taken from the subterranean tunnel . Some of these are the only samples taken from pristine primary contexts at the Sun Pyramid and provide us with an excellent opportunity to accurately define its construction. Utilizing Bayesian statistics to model these results , we suggest that the Sun Pyramid was constructed aroundA.D. 170-310, which pushes ahead the con­struction of the monument to over a century later than what was previously proposed. It is no surprise that the radiocarbon samples taken from non-fill strata in the subterranean tunnel indicate a similar timing, dating to around A.D. 140-240. This sug­gests that both the Sun Pyramid and its subterranean tunnel were probably constructed in roughly the same interval in association with each other. 
These results demonstrate disagreements between the few available radiocarbon dates and the ceramic chronology available from the other mon­uments. At present, the data suggest similar con­struction sequences at the Sun Pyramid (A.D. 
170-310, 95 percent Tzacualli ceramics), the Moon Pyramid Building 4 (A .D. 200--300, 87 percent Tza­cualli ceramics) (SugiyamaandCabrera2007: 120), and the FSP (A.D. 200-250, Miccaotli to Early Tlamimilolpaceramics)(Sugiyama 1998a, 1998b). Building 4 of the Moon Pyramid being the phase when this mound also reached a monumental scale (Sugiyama and Cabrera 2007), it is apparent that state monumentality at Teotihuacan occurred in a massive scale betweenA.D. 170-310. The dilemma here is why there is such a discrepancy between the ceramic distribution in the fill of the FSP and the overlapping radiocarbon dates of the other two mon­uments. A couple of suggestions that are not mutu­ally exclusive can be made at this point . 
One explanation can be derived from the dras­tically distinct characteristics of the fill matrix at each of the monuments . As described earlier, the fill of the Sun Pyramid consisted main! y of a mix­ture of soil, ground tepetate, and silty sand layers with a high concentration of charcoal and cultural remains . The fill of this structure was probably made from surface refuse mixed with varying degrees of tepetate that was quarried, sometimes forming caves. In contrast, the FSP was composed of well-prepared homogenous mud with few arti­fact inclusions to cement the rock walls that were filled in . We must keep in mind that such fill refuse represents tertiary contexts and that differences in the cultural materials found could reflect differ­ences in the sources they were extracted from . 
Another possibility is that the chronological ranges that can be defined with radiocarbon dating span much longer periods than the ceramic phases themselves , causing several ceramic phases to be collapsed into long intervals . This is the result of the relatively few radiocarbon dates available from secure primary contexts in comparison to the ceramic chronology based on a robust sample. Uti­lizing Bayesian statistics , more narrowly defined absolute dates have been successfully assigned to later ceramic sequences at Teotihuacan , including Tlamimilolpa , Early Xolalpan, and Late Xolalpan phases (Beramendi-Orosco et al . 2009) . Now it is necessary to concentrate on the early periods at Teotihuacan, utilizing areas with a priori defined phases based on multiple secure contexts in a man­ner similar to that conducted by Zeidler et al. (1998) in the Ecuadorian coast. 
This renewed understanding of when the Sun Pyramid and the subterranean tunnel were con­structed proposes that they were built during a period of rapid monumental expansion throughout the ceremonial core . The Sun Pyramid and the sub­terranean tunnel were central features in the devel­opment of the sociopolitical landscape of Teotihuacan. They were built within a complex web of meaning in association with other monumental structures at the ceremonial core that evidently func­tioned to materialize their worldview (Sugiyama 2010). Excavations at these major pyramids have brought to light the longevity of utilizing this loca­tion for public structures and have helped us recre­ate in more detail and precision , the timing , process , and built-in meanings of its construction.
