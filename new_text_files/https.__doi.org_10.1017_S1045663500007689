Intermediate Elites, edited by Christina Elson and Allen Covey, is a volume that encourages a move beyond the simple dichotomy of elites and commoners. Emphasiz­ing "intermediate elite" strata, it examines social groups that functioned to link rulers and commoners in various ways. Contributors explore archaeological and ethno­historic methods for studying these strata, and demon­strate how a more profound understanding of the past can be gained by differentiating rulers from their sub­ordinate counterparts. With this focus, the investiga­tions apply societal and agency based approaches to the study of Aztec, Inka, Maya, Wari, and Zapotec cultures. 
Elson and Covey introduce "Intermediate Elites" (Chapter 1) with a well-written discussion of elite the­ory. This chapter is insightful for numerous reasons, but is most important because it highlights what social sci­entists implicitly understand about elite variation-all elites were not the same and "intermediate elites" played an extremely dynamic role over both time and space. The volume pushes a more explicit stance in this regard as a means of substantially increasing our holistic under­standing of ancient states. 
The contributions by Alan Covey, Craig Morris and Alan Covey, Francis Berdan, Elizabeth Brumfiel, Steven Wemke, and Joyce Marcus are very informative. Covey (Chapter 6) discusses the cultural developments in the Cuzco Basin that were associated with the emergence of the Inka Empire. During initial Inka expansion, many conquered elites were left in power. However, over time, local officials were replaced by Inka royalty to both strengthen the state and provide political positions for the rapidly expanding Inka elite class. Acknowledged by the author, supporting archaeological data are lim­ited but ethnohistoric material compensates for it. Mor­ris and Covey (Chapter 7) contrast the Inka Empire's direct strategy of reorganizing the decentralized poli­ties in the nearby Huanuco region with a fairly tolerant system of "corulership" used to integrate more distant polities along the coast. The comparatively independent coastal elites were better able to work the system in self serving ways (e.g., they appear to have hidden labor con­scripts in caves to reduce imperial tribute levies!). 
Berdan and Brumfiel' s contributions provide enlight­ening discussions on the Aztec. Berdan (Chapter 8) com­pares the policies implemented by the Aztec to keep conquered intermediate elites under control with the strategies used by these individuals to maintain their positions. Reviewing ethnohistoric data, Brumfiel (chap­ter 9) presents a compelling case that Aztec imperial ide­ology was largely secondary in the minds of most of the provincial citizenry. 
Aside from distracting jargon, Wemke's (Chapter I 0) fascinating analysis of intermediate elites in the Andean province of Collagua makes a solid argument for inferring where the nucleated sixteenth-century kin groups resided during lnka times, a settlement system that reflects the agency of high-ranking individuals. Moreover, the geographic distribution of the communi­ties represents a clear case for vertical complementar­ity. Wernke adds valuable context to the debate about whether this complementarity was primarily ecologi­cally adaptive or implemented sociopolitically. 
Marcus (Chapter 11) closes the book with a strong synthetic and comparative chapter. She discusses the facility offered by early writing systems as a means of identifying intermediate elites, and the way in which hierarchies were reified and conceptualized in the minds of people in many early complex societies. 
The contributions by Charles Spencer and Elsa Red­mond, Christina Elson, Tiffany Tung and Anita Cook, and Christina Conlee and Katharina Schreiber are rel­evant to the volume, but some of the arguments are unclear or not fully developed. Spencer and Redmond

(Chapter 2) focus on the administrative ambitions of 
Monte Alban in the Valley of Oaxaca ca. 300-100 B.C. 
Specifically, they contrast the autonomy maintained by 
the nearbyTilcajete polity with MonteAlban's conquest 
of the distant Cuicatlan Canada polity. Various resistance 
strategies supposedly implemented by Tilcajete are dis­
cussed (e.g., population increase and nucleation), but the 
interpretations are largely unconvincing. Moreover, 
alternative explanations are not considered. For exam­
ple, the authors suggest that active resistance by local 
polities like Tilcajete encouraged Monte Alban's con­
quest of less populous, although more distant polities 
like Cuicatlan. However, perhaps Cuicatlan was incor­
porated first because it provided agricultural products 
not available in the Valley of Oaxaca, a motivation anal­
ogous to early Aztec conquest of Morelos where cotton 
was available. This important ecological detail comes 
to light only well into the following chapter by Christina 
Elson (Chapter 3). Elson uses archaeological data and 
sixteenth-century ethnohistoric information to discuss 
varying strategies used by Monte Alban after 100 B.C. 
to integrate local elites at three secondary centers in the 
Valley of Oaxaca. A general suggestion is made that the 
Monte Alban rulers influenced their intermediate coun­
terparts by controlling access to the material trappings 
associated with noble status. This suggestion is reason­
able, but many specific arguments are supported by lim­
ited or incomplete data, which in some cases are not 
clearly qualified (e.g., why are obsidian implements 
necessarily considered "elite goods"?). 
Tung and Cook (Chapter 4) discuss the expansion of the elite class at Conchopata, a subject of the Wari Empire. Using burial data, they demonstrate that over time the number of elite strata increased dramatically. There are many interesting points made by this study, especially the interpretations regarding local ritual prac­tices. These merits notwithstanding, the burial data need to be better contextualized in relation to the site in gen­eral; why exactly are these burials interpreted as elite? 
This question required more attention given the high level of physical stress reflected by the skeletal mater­ial, a condition acknowledged by the authors. 
Conlee and Schreiber (Chapter 5) examine sociopo­litical change in the Nasca region during and after the Wari Empire, beginning with a wonderful overview of the Nazca chronology (I recommend that readers unfa­miliar with this sequence read this chapter before Chap­ter 4). Based on settlement pattern data, the inferences regarding social factions both for and against the Wari Empire are well supported. The discussion for the period following the Wari collapse, however, is somewhat unclear. Apparently, during this time elites dispersed to many settlements, diversifying their power baes by tak­ing control over a wider range of activities (e.g., ceramic production). At one point the authors argue that this 
process created multiple elite strata, yet they conclude 
by suggesting that during this period the elites became 
less internally diverse. 
One minor general criticism of the volume is that 
some of the maps were inadequate, hard to read, or not 
labeled well enough to complement the narration. This 
point is unfortunate because it may frustrate a clear 
understanding of the arguments for readers unfamiliar 
with the local geographies. Nevertheless, this volume 
allowed me to clarify my understanding of "elites" as a 
category and the infinite variation characterizing elite 
behavior. An important and unresolved question high­
lighted throughout the chapters was whether persistent 
local elite traditions reflect active resistance to central 
authority or the calculated tolerance of ruling overlords. 
This debate is especially difficult to resolve with archae­
ological data alone, but it certainly represents a chal­
lenge worthy of future research on this captivating topic.

In his foreword, ethnohistorian Matthew Restall calls 
this book "the single most significant intellectual assault 
on the Great Wall that has divided 'Postclassic 
Mesoamerica' of archaeologists and the 'colonial Mex­
ico' of historians." While I agree with this assessment 
of the importance of the book, the chapters demonstrate some of the obstacles yet to be overcome before we can begin to claim any kind of adequate understanding of the social effects of the Spanish conquest as reflected in the archaeological record. 
Chapter 1, an informative introduction by the edi­tors, places the volume within wider empirical and the­oretical contexts. Kepecs and Alexander note that a major contribution of the chapters is documentation of the great variability in the nature, operation, and results of Spanish colonialism within greater Mesoamerica. Susan Evans follows with a systematic analysis of images of indigenous-style palaces in a Spanish map from 1550. Enrique Rodriguez-Alegria describes con­sumption patterns of ceramic serving wares at three early colonial houses in Mexico City. Thomas Charl­ton, Cynthia Otis Charlton, and Patricia Fournier pre­sent an informative synthesis of demography, settlement, and ceramics at rural and urban contexts in the Basin of Mexico before and after the Spanish conquest. Helen Pollard summarizes documentary data on the fate of the Tarascan Empire under Spanish domination. Janine
