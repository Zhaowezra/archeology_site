This attractively produced book presents chapters based on papers given at the 2012 meeting of the American Anthropological Association in San Francisco.Withastrong focusonlandscapearchae­ology, the contributors use a range of approaches to consider various aspects ofllama and alpaca herding in Peru andBolivia. 
Theeditors de.nepastoralismasa “general form of economic subsistence that is fundamentally (but not exclusively) based on the management, produc­tion, and consumption of herding animals” (p. 1). As an initial proposition, this de.nition provides a framing device for the book as a whole, but the editors also entitlethesubsectioninwhichit appears “Pastoralism and Herding Societies” because not all the contributors de.ne what they mean by pastoral-ism. At times it appears that if there is evidence that herding or “rearing” (p. 119) took place in a society, there are grounds for including the chapter in the book. The elastic term “agropastoralism” is brought into play to justify the presence of such contributions, despite the efforts of Manuel Perales Munguía, who explicitly grapples with the concept of agropastoralism and the shift in emphasis from an economy predicated on herding to one in which people put more effort into growing crops (p. 159). Axel Nielsende.nespastoralismasa social network of interacting agents consisting of the household of humanherders,theherd animalsthemselves,divinities he calls generically “deities,” and the community constitutedbythese three categoriesofagents(p. 232). This satisfyingalternativede.nition providesa good example of how to use social principles to consider both humansandherdanimalsas actors—forexample, Nielsen discusses how herders attempt to dissuade their llamas fromdispersingorleaving the homestead 
(p. 239). 
The .nal chapter consists of a commentary by David Browman. His observations are at times very rigorous.Browmanoffersgood reasonsfornotalways agreeing with the contributors. He points out inter­connections between the chapters and indicates some areasofemerging importanceinresearch into pastoral-ism. Browmandiscusseshis reservations concerning the speculative reliance on using evidence taken from pastoralists in other parts of the world (p. 246). The editors apply the secondary products revolution approach(pp.xi,2)tothe Andean case;in supportof Browman’scomments,it hastobestatedvery.rmly that this theory,whichwasdevisedforthe archaeology of Eurasia, is not applicable to the Americas. It has alreadybeen establishedthatArchaic populationsin the Andes were spinning and making fabrics from the .eece of vicuña and guanaco well before the domesticationofllamasand alpacas (Dransart, Earth, Water, Fleece andFabric, 2002).Unlikewildsheep, wild camelids already had .eece, which gatherer-hunters spun. 
Theimpositionof a notionconcerning secondary products leads Katherine Mooreto undermineherself in an otherwise good chapter on the biology of camelidsand deer as relatedtoseasonal activitiessuch as hunting. She acknowledgesthat camelid .eecewas used prior to domestication, but she contradictorily asserts the editorial line that .eece “would have been the essential secondary product” (p. 30). This assertion constitutes a categorical mistake. Another indicationofjusthow dangerousitisto attemptto apply the notion of secondary products to camelids: Browman points out that in her conference paper ClaudineVallières listedmilk as oneof theproducts taken from camelids(p. 250).Itisfortunate that this error has been corrected in the published version, because no evidence suggests that people milked camelids in the past, and they do not do so in the present.

Although Moore’sperspectiveis fromthe central Peruvian highlands,itiscommendablethatshe con­siders evidence from other parts of the Andes and does not con.ne herself entirely to the geographical remit followed by other authors. Maria Bruno and Christine Hastorf’s chapter, based on research in progress into what can be learned from a study of camelid dung, is welcome, too, in exploring the diet of camelids. They could, however, have related their .ndings to .eece production, because their analysis of samples of dungburned atTiwanaku suggeststhat the camelids had access to plants from wet zones. Alpaca herders state that in order to have plentiful supplies of.eece, it is important for alpacas to graze on moist pasture.Thelackofachapteron .eeceisa signi.cant omission fromthe book because yarnsand textilesprovide directevidence forthe primaryuseof .eece, whichhas clearly beenvaluedby people from the earliest humanoccupationsof theAndesuptothe present. 
Thethemeofwatermanagementoccursin several chapters and some contributors (Kevin Lane and JenniferGrant,as wellasPerales)refertothepractice of usingirrigation canalstoextendareasofvegetation coverfor moist pasture. This topicisimportant forthe landscapefocus of the book,butthese chapters make only cursory reference to the published literature. Thereisscope here forintegratingintothe discussion ethnographic accounts of the differing approaches agropastoralists andpastoralists usetomanage canals in ordertoexplorethe implications for understanding distinctionsin thepast. 
Highlights of the book include Nicholas Tripce­vich’sstudyofalong-distance journeyfromCotahuasi to Apurimac witha caravanof llamasbearinga cargo of salt. Membersoftheprojectmadea careful record during the journey, charting the roles of each llama within the caravan—at the front as main leaders, as occasionalleaders,inthemiddleofthe pack,orbring­ingup the rear.Not onlythe humanparticipants are namedasindividuals;the llamaparticipants are, too. Tripcevich pays close attention to the wedge-shaped con.guration of the herd when walking along a trail andapplieshisobservationstothewidthofprehispanic roads; wide roads would make it easier for large caravanstotravelquickly(p. 224).Ina poignant note in herchapter,Susan deFrance mentions that colonial-period pathologieson camelid phalangesandvertebrae fromTorataAlta indicatehowstressed llamasworking in the wineries were, suffering from illnesses and becoming lame (p. 131).Suchcontributions addtoa growing bodyof literature reportingonthe important topicofhumanrelationships with herd animalsinthe context oflandscape.

This work by Henrik B. Lindskoug—based on his PhD thesis—aims to understand the processes of abandonment of the Aguada society in the Ambato Valley (Catamarca, Argentina) through the study of the paleoenvironmental conditions associated with them.Inaccordance with this general goal, Lindskoug proposes as a speci.c objective the development of techniquesand methodsto identify.re sequencesand regimes, based mainly on the analysis of microchar­coal recoveredthrough thesamplingofthe geological sequences in the area. 
The author provides an important visual support for the analysis and results by including more than a hundred .gures,including graphics,drawings,and photographs.Theworkisorganizedin threepartsthat include nine chapters,through whichhepresentsvar­ious aspectsofhisinvestigation, plusabibliography andthree appendixes.It shouldbenoted that each part andchapter canbe read separately,but takentogether they allow a more complete view of the scenarios of occupation and depopulation of the valley. For this reason, each of these sections is reviewed separately here,followedby anoverviewofthe study. 
In part 1, after the introductory chapter, the theo­retical perspectives and analytical categories that are usedintheinvestigationofthe subject areexplained, emphasizing central concepts that supportthem, such as landscape, .re, and environment. The notion of landscape as a cultural construction, dynamic and relative, turns out to be a common thread through­out the book. Chapter 2 presents a rich discussion questioning the nature/culture dichotomy, addressing aspects related to climate perceptions and abandon­ment models,with signi.cantbackground about this problem in northwestern Argentina. 
Chapter3providesabriefoverviewofthe occupa­tion and disappearance of Aguada, with a focus on the Ambato Valley, describing the background and current archaeological researchonthesubject.Chapter 4 addresses landscape problems, considering natu­ral environment, geology, and paleoenvironmental
