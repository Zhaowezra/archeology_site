respectivemigrant populations’ economicimpact on thecityhave remained unclear.Tothisend,the book attemptsto modelasegmentoftheTeopancazco pop­ulation(byage, sexpro.le, occupation, health,etc.) as abasis for understanding theinternalsocialstructure of intermediate elitesatTeotihuacan.Drawing on her experienceexcavatinglow status (Oztoyohualco) and elite(Xalla)compounds atTeotihuacan,Manzanilla contextualizes and extrapolates these Teopancazco .ndings intoa postulationonthe natureofthesocial structures that inform and characterize the city’s dynamic socioeconomiclandscape. 
Manzanilla’s commendable strategy of sourcing acrossaspectrumofanalytical methodologies yieldsa goldmineofrawdata. Synthesizingthese.ndingswith relevant comparative data within Teotihuacan itself (chapter 5) and other Mesoamerican sites(chapters 4 and 7) reveals many features unique to Teopan­cazco.Forexample, adultmales wereextremelyover­represented(85%), while male andfemale children wereequally distributed(chapters2 and 8).Adults also featured a high incidence (29%) of nutritional stress during infancy, suggesting that the need for better quality of life (food rations andjob security) may have been a common impetus of outmigration from three separate regions along the Gulf Coast tradecorridor (chapter 10).Iwould caution,however, that the 38 decapitated individuals (~30% of the skeletal sample) mustbeinterpreted separately,asthis group is a signi.cant source of the skew toward a male-and foreign-dominatedcomposition. Thehighly specialized context means they are not necessarily representative of natural deaths nor of the resident population. 
The chapters successfully summarize each archaeometry method and its application, but they frequently lack proprietary and otherwise relevant diagnostic and technical factors as well as raw data tables. The volume would greatly bene.t from their inclusion, in appendix form if necessary. Without these, the reader must rely solely on summary .gures andtables(whichshouldhavebeen publishedincolor or corrected for proper representation in grayscale), and will have dif.culty assessing which samples were discarded due to failed diagenesis testing on bone strontium, carbonates, and dentine collagen. Nonetheless, taken in its entirety, the data in this volume form a coherent and useful guideline for many archaeologists navigating the increasingly specialized maze of archaeometry. 
In thewakeofdebates concerning thesocialstruc­tureofTeotihuacan, its ethnicmakeup, and modelsof urban population dynamics (references within chapter 10),the comprehensive approach to metadata integra­tionpresentedin thisvolumeisawelcome sight.From it, Manzanilladrawstwoimportant conclusions.First, the multiethnic nature of Teopancazco’s residents de.ned its social structure as a neighborhood center, precisely becauseofthespecial relationshipthis center hadwithGulfCoasttrade routes.Secondly,itisargued thatTeopancazco representsa “house” structure, with three main ethnic groups socioeconomically united by their common participation in activities such as rituals, feasting, craftwork, and trade (chapter 10). The portrait of Teopancazco in this volume devel­ops from its exemplary approach to multidisciplinary data acquisition. Findings fromfutureexcavationsof Teotihuacan compounds, compiled according to the strategy outlined in this volume, would serve as ideal referencesto testthe modelsadvocatedbyManzanilla and colleagues.

This book explores Classic Maya (AD 250–900) concepts of the body and the soul and how they relate to life, death and burial. The author not only draws fromarchaeology andbioarchaeologybut also fromMaya epigraphy,iconography, ethnohistory and ethnography. 
Chapter1,Lived Bodies,focusesonthelivedMaya body and introduces ethnographic Maya soul con­cepts, co-essences and supernaturals, and discusses the importance of the head as evidenced through historic and iconographic sources. Cranial shaping, tooth modi.cation, diet, sex, gender and aging, and disease are also addressed. Because the treatment of the bodyin both lifeand deathisperceived asa lens into Classic Maya conceptions of body and soul, in Chapter 2, Dead Bodies, the author looks into body treatmentssuchaswrapping andbundling, adornment of thehead,the useof red pigment on thedead body, and the symbolism of associated artifacts such as deathmasks andjadeornaments.The afterlifeofdead bodies,with theirexhumationand transformationinto objects(e.g.,bowlsmadefrom humancrania)forritual purposes, is touched upon as well. The rituals sur­rounding death,burial andthe afterlifeare addressed

in Chapter 3, Ritual, Liminality and the Mortuary Space. Herethe author investigatesburial spaces and mourning rituals.He looks into Maya cosmology,the conceptofaxis mundi,the meaningofshellsingraves and of inverted perforated vessels found over the head, human sacri.ce, bloodletting, .nger and tooth caches, animals in graves, and funerary benches and biers. Chapter 4, The Mortuary Landscape, focuses on terrestrial, celestial, and otherworldly spaces and places as well as on the placing of the dead corpse. It re.ects on the Maya custom of burying the dead in and around residences, the disturbance of graves, ancestorworship,the political usesof thedead,and the polity-speci.c orientation of the corpse, espe­cially in the western Maya kingdoms. In addition, it looks at Maya cosmology,Mayaspirits,pyramids andsacred mountains,psychoducts,ballcourts,caves, ritual killings,placesin theotherworld, E-groups and twinpyramid-groups, shell symbolism, theQuadri­partite Badge,andtheroleof sarcophagiatPalenque andTonina. 
The four chapters are divided into multiple sub-chapters that carry headings such as, “The .nished self,” “Burning bones,” “Capturing life, masking death,” “Souls at birth and death,” “Images of the soul,” “Danse macabre,” “Heart of the earth,” and “Fire and the jaguar sun.” These headings do not always alludeexactlytothecontentmatter.Forexam­ple, the subchapter “Body and self, heart and soul” (pp. 12–14) treats modern highlandMayaperceptions of therelationshipofthe self,the individual, the body, andthe soul (co-essences)by contrastingthese with those of Classic period Maya texts. The subchapter “Body andself, soulsand others”(pp. 19–23),onthe otherhand, putsemphasisonthe relationshipbetween the heart and the head as well as on the importance oftheheadasakeyto individuation.Itisnotalways cleartomewhy certain themesarestrung togetherina particular order,andthereisalso considerableoverlap and repetition between subchapters. Fortunately, the indexallowsareaderto searchforspeci.c topics more systematically. 
Whilethisis undoubtedly oneof the mostambi­tiousbooksaboutMaya attitudestowardsdeath,burial, andthe afterlifethatIhaveever come across,it has left me pondering the validity of some of its results. Because the author conducted research on human remains in the western Maya lowlands and central Petén, he gives these two regions major attention. Hisdataderive fromthe UsumacintaRiver kingdoms of Piedras Negras and Yaxchilan, and other smaller Usumacinta sites such as El Porvenir, Budsilha, TecoloteandElKinel,aswellasfromthe centralPetén sitesofTikal,Yaxha,andEl Zotz. Naturally,there are references to manyotherPreclassicand ClassicMaya sites such as Altar de Sacri.cios, Cuello, Calakmul andCopan,buttheburial data concerning theClassic period of these sites seem not to have been incorpo­ratedthoroughlyintothe analysis.Icannot shakeoff theimpression thatthesamplesizeonwhichtheauthor basedhis assumptionsistoosmallandtooregionally restrictedtoallowforthekindofbroad generalizations he strived for. For example, he states that “inverted vessels, usually found over the face, are invariably perforated” (p. 117). From a pan-Maya perspective, “invariably”is certainlyanoverstatement,becausein, e.g.,theClassicburials7,25,27,29,42,47,51, etc., of AltardeSacri.cios andtheburialsA-47and A-64 of Uaxactun, the vessels placed over the deceased’s head were not perforated (Smith, 1950, Uaxactun, Guatemala;1972,Excavations at AltardeSacri.cios). Schereralsowritesthat “nearly allthe ClassicMaya perforated mortuarydishesare tripodvessels”and that “the threevessellegsmay symbolizethe threehearth­stonesof creation, underscoring theperforationinthe vesselasanaxis mundi”(p. 119).Thisstatement does not standthe testof comparisonwiththe larger Maya region, either. Perforated (as well as unperforated) vessels of Early Classic date that were placed over thehead areusually not tripodsbut often basal.ange ring-basebowls.Oneexampleisfoundin Burial115 of AltardeSacri.cios (Adams 1971, TheCeramicsof AltardeSacri.cios,.g. 32g);for earlier,unperforated examples,see Cuelloburials139and140 (Robin1989, Preclassic Maya Burials at Cuello). In Late Classic graves, the three legs had sometimes been removed before deposition, as, for example, in Burial 6 from Seibal (Tourtellot 1990, Excavations at Seibal,p. 93). 
I also disagree with the assertion that, with the exception of Caracol, collective interment was “not widely practiced among theClassicMaya” (p. 188). AsIhavearguedinthe past (2004, Journal of Social Archaeology 4: 368–404), and as is well attested in theliterature(e.g., Hammond, Pretty&Saul 1975, World Archaeology 7, pp. 57–78; Healy, Awe, and Helmuth 1998, Journal ofFieldArchaeology25, pp. 261–274), not all of the tombs with multiple bodies should be considered the result of human sacri.ce. Hence, to the list of collective interments I would liketoadd thesitesofCaledonia, Chiapade Corzo, Guaytan, Kaminaljuyu, Lubaantun, Nebaj,Tikal,and Zaculeu,to namebut afew,aswellassome Belizean caves, whichshouldbeconsidered as collectiveburial spaces,especially thosewhere boneshavebeen stud­iedindetailand identi.edastheremainsof funerary deposits (Wrobel, Helmke & Freiwald 2014, in The Bioarchaeology of Space and Place, pp. 77–106).

to the realm of the exceptional, describing them as “re.ecting a unique social and political landscape in the eastern lowlands”(p. 216) whereas deposits of scattered human remains in caves of the western lowlands that “have not been systematically studied” 
(p. 
217) aretentatively identi.ed as places for “offer­ings to the temperamental supernaturals that dwell beneaththe earth”(p. 218). 

Although Scherer explicitly remarks on several occasions that thereis muchgeographicand temporal variability (p. 54) as well as polity-speci.c mortuary patterning(p. 189),and thedatapresentedin the book provide plenty of evidence for this, one of the core premisesandconclusionsofthebookisthatin ancient Maya society, there existed “essential commonali­ties that unitedkingand commoner, community and kingdom, into domainsof sharedpracticeand belief” 

(p. 
229).This one-size-.ts-all approach turnsintoan argumentative trap. As a result, the author considers certain mortuary phenomenaasexceptions(suchasthe funerary useofBelizeancaves),triestoexplainaway variabilityby suggestingthatother researcherserred, andentangles himselfincontradictoryarguments.For example, when discussing theissueofthe application of red pigment on dead bodies, he writes: “Some scholarshaveerroneously assumedthatthe presence of red pigment on skeletal remains means the bone wasdirectly painted.In most casesof purported post­intermentpainting,however, theevidenceisambigu­ous, as the pigmentation could just as easily have transferred duringcorpsedecomposition. Oneof the best examples of direct bone painting was noted by Lori Wrightin herstudyof theremains fromBurial PNT-019 of Tikal” (p. 79). Not only is there some obvious contradictionhere,butIalsodo not seewhy the existence of separate mortuary customs – one of paintingthedeadbodynotlong afterdeathandoneof paintingthe bones upon reentryofthe tomb or during reburial –could nothave co-existedin theMayaarea. 


On the subject of red pigment, I would like to mentionthe20 tipped-in colorplatesatthe centerof the book, which represent enlarged color versions of in-text black-and-white .gures. The hematite that is mentionedbut not visibleinthe captionsof theblack­and-white .gures 2.34, 2.36, and 3.19 can,however, be detected on colorplates8,9,and 13. Unfortunately, no reference to these plates is made anywhere in the text despite their muchbetter quality andusefulness. 
Toendonapositivenote,Ithink that this book con­tainsmanyinterestingand well-informed subchapters, new and previously unpublished archaeological and ethnographic data, and thought-provoking questions and ideas. If read with a certain amount of caution, it can be mined usefully and will undoubtedly serve as an important source concerning funerary and post-funerary ritualsand Maya attitudestowards deathfor manyyearstocome.

Rock paintingsandengravingshavealwaysfascinated westerners. Indeed, an account of a painted cave is included in Fray Ramón Pané’s An Account of the Antiquities of theIndians,produced circa 1498 at the behestof ChristopherColumbus,the .rst book written in theNewWorldinaEuropean language. Despite the generalpaucity of archaeological studies of rock art, these sites are in fact common in the Americas. As an example, over 1,500 sites have been recorded in California alone,and thesecontain(literally)millions of individual motifs.

ThePecosstyle sitesare characterizedby.nelypainted,complexpoly­chrome panels portrayingelongated anthropomorphic motifssurroundedbymyriadfantastical images: dots impaledby spears, smaller “.ying” anthropomorphs, felines,deer,birds, undulating lines andother designs, all in seemingly chaotic juxtaposition. Chronomet­ric dating places these sites between about 4,000 and 1,500 years old, within the North American ArchaicPeriod, indicatingthatthey werecreatedby nomadic hunter-gatherers.Given theage,complexity, andbeautyof thePecosstyle sites,itis not surprising thattheyhavebeen studied(evenifsporadically)since the 1930s by artists and archaeologists, making them oneof thebest-documented corporaof rockartin the Americas. 
One might conclude, from this research history, that the Pecos style rock art is well understood. TheWhite Shaman Mural,byCarolyn E. Boyd with contributions by Kim Cox, belies that assumption.
