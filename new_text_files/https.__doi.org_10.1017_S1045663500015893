Andean textile analysis was a major focus of researchthroughoutmostofthetwentiethcentury,anditcontinuesto generate enormous interest and enthusiasm as mani-fested in articles, books, specialized conferences, andNGOs.Thisunusualdegreeofacademic focusisduetoanumberoffactors.AncientAndeantextilesareamongthe most beautiful and complex in the world, and theunusuallydrycoastofPeruandChilehasresultedinthesurvivalofthousandsoftextiles,manyofwhicharecen-turiesormillenniaold.Itisalsorelevantthatvibranttra-ditionsofhouseholdtextileproductioncontinuetoexistin many Andean communities and these have attractedthe attention of ethnographers, archaeologists, and stu-dents of material culture. Finally, anthropologists suchas John V.

Thebookunderreview,TheAndeanScienceofWeav­ing, is a beautifully produced volume dedicated to thestudy of the structures and techniques of warp-facedweaves oftheAndes.Itrepresentsboththeculminationand the transformation of a century of academic textileanalysis in the Andes. The volume uses a large coffee-table book format, and it is illustrated with 450 colordrawingsandphotographs.Theabundantfiguresdepictnot merely archaeological, historic, and ethnographictextiles from museum collections in Europe and LatinAmerica, but also field photographs of the weavingprocess.The photographs illustrate little known textilesfromPeru,Chile,andBolivia,andtheyareaccompaniedby high-quality computer-generated graphic drawingsofthetextilestructure.TheauthorsarebothbasedinLa Paz, Bolivia: DeniseArnold is a British anthropologist,formerlyattheUniversityofLondonandcurrentlywork-ing as Director of the Instituto de Lengua y CulturaAymara,andElviraEspejoisaBolivianweaver,singer,and poet who speaks Quechua and Aymara and is cur-rentlyDirectoroftheNationalMuseumofEthnographyandFolklore.ASpanishversionofthisvolumewasorig-inallypublishedinBoliviabuthasbeenexpandedinthisEnglish translation. 
Thisbookfollowsinthetraditionofearlierliterature suchasAlfredKroebersandLilaO Neals1930classic Textile Periods in Ancient Peru and Rene D Harcourt s TextilesofAncientPeruandTheirTechniques(originallypublished in French in 1934). These and other worksattempted to provide a description of the remarkablediversity of archaeological textiles through a formalanalysis of their structures and the techniques used toproduce them. This approach, reinforced by scholarssuch as Junius Bird and Elizabeth King, eventually ledto Irene Emery s famous work The Primary Structures ofFabrics,firstpublishedin1966.Theterminology,def-initions,andgeneralapproachadvocatedbyEmerywereadopted on a worldwide basis, including in the Andes,andwereappliedinthewritingsofLatinAmericanschol-ars such as Rosa Fung Pineda and her colleagues in theU.S., most notably Anne Rowe. While many scholarshavebeenattractedtotherigorandeleganceoftheformalanalysis of textile structure, outlined by Emery, othershavefounditdryanddifficulttoappreciate.Someschol-ars,suchasAndreaHeckman,choseinsteadtofocusonthe role of textiles in modernAndean ritual in her book Woven Stories:Andean Textiles and Rituals, while Gail Silverman,inhervolume AWovenBookofKnowledge:Textile Iconography of Cuzco, Peru, sought to betterunderstandAndean cosmologythrough a study of sym-bols present on contemporaryAndean textiles.
Arnold and Espejo are very much in the tradition ofO Neale,Emery,andRoweintheirfocusontextilestruc-ture and technique. For the authors, Andean weavingpractices are considered to constitute an alternative tra-ditionofscience;thisideadrawsuponPaulFeyerabend sproposal that, at any one time, various competing tradi-tions generate science and that Andean weaving repre-sentsanalternativetraditiontothedominant paradigmsof established disciplines such as physics. The revolu-tionary contribution of this volume is to employ thevocabulary found in the dominant native Andean lan-guage families, Aymara and Quechua, in order toexplain the techniques used to produce the structuresfound in the textiles.Arnold and Espejo argue that cat-egoriesandtermstakenfromOldWorldsettings,appliedby Emery and others to the Andean corpus of fabrics,have impeded our understanding of them.The new ter-minologyisviewedasintroducingAndeanculturallogicinto the analysis, thereby producing a more appropriateand efficient vision of the processes.

LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 27, No. 3, 2016] 
The volume is divided into four sections. The intro-duction reviews earlier research and sets the stage forthis volume. The second short section discusses the potential of employing textile terms from modernAndean languages in order to model the structure andproductionofAndeantextiles.Itacknowledgestheprob-lems of this approach, including the powerful impactthat Spanish has had on these languages and the loss ofmany native terms as a result of centuries of culturaltransformationandlanguagechange.Athirdchapterpre-sents a fascinating summary of the stages of learning toweave amongAndean boys and girls.
Thefourthandbyfarthelargestsection,comprisingabout three quarters of the book, is devoted to TextileStructuresandTechniques.Some60differenttechniquesare described and illustrated in detail. Most of these includeasummarydescription,adefinitionofthestruc-ture,areconstructionofhowitwasdone( technique ),and comments on its historical development. The latterusually involves a shortreference tothe presence ofthetechnique in the archaeological record (both in spaceandtime).Littleeffortismadetocontextualizethepres-enceofthesetechniqueswithinspecificprehistoric,his-toric, or ethnographic cultures. In some cases, anidealizedmaquetteisprovidedtoshowhowaparticulartechnique was carried out; in other cases, ethnographic photos are used to illustrate the process. The compre-hensive descriptions of Andean textile structures andtechniques will principally be of interest to specialists.
Intheconcludingsection,theauthorsraiseanumberof interesting issues regarding the current situation andfuture of Andean textile production. They note theincreased interest in these textiles as sources of local indigenous identity, at the same time that demand forthemhasincreasedamongtourists.AsArnoldandEspejonote, local populations with their first-hand knowledgeof weaving judge textiles differently than tourists andnon-local collectors. While local populations tend tovaluecomplextextilestructureandweavingskill,touristsareattractedbycolorfulor recognizable imagery that isrelativelysimpletoproduce.Similarly,thelinkbetweencomplexweavingtechniquesandlocalknowledgesome-times results in local communities deciding not toexchangeorsellmorecomplextextiles,thusfurtherbias-ingthenatureofmuseumorprivatecollectionsofAndeanweaving. However, since museum practices do not justgathervaluableartifacts,butalsomakeartifactsvaluableby gathering them, this can result in producing a binaryvalueatanationallevel.GiventhedeepinvolvementofbothauthorsinAndeanmuseumculture,theirdiscussionofthisparadoxicalsituationisparticularlyintriguingandmerits further exploration.
