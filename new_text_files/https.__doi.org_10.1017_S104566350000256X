
EVALUATING THE DISTRIBU TIONAL APPROACH TO INFERRING 
MARKE TPLACE EXCHANGE: 
A TEST CASE FROM THE MEXICAN GULF LOWLANDS 

Christopher P. Garraty 
Over a decade ago Kenneth Hirth ( 1998, 2000) developed a "distributional approach" for archaeologically inferring the existence of marketplace exchange based on analyses of domestic artifact collections. Domestic collections, he reasoned, will be relatively homogeneous in areas where most or all households rely on marketplace exchange to acquire domestic provisions. The present study evaluates Hirth's distributional approach using a statistical measure of diversity (hetero­geneity) to quantify variability among domestic collection units over a large area. The data for this study come from the Middle Postclassic lower Blanco region of Veracruz (A.D. 1200-A.D. 1350), an unknown context of marketplace exchange. A comparison of diversity scores calculated on surface sherd collections from the lower Blanco region with scores from late Postclassic Teotihuacan (A.D. 1350-A.D. I520)-a known context of marketplace exchange-suggests the existence of a marketplace exchange system in the lower Blanco region, likely centered at the town of El Sauce. In addition, changes in intercollection diversity (sherds) and obsidian concentrations with increasing distance from the center suggest El Sauce ·s market service area encompassed a radius of approximately six to nine kilometers.

analyses of variability among domestic artifact collections. 
Hirth 's distributional approach holds a great deal of promise for better understanding the evolution of premodern economies and market systems, but a number of commentators have been critical of his approach. Smith ( 1999) argues that archaeologists cannot gauge what sort of "domestic signature" marketplace exchange will leave unless we com­pare unknown against known cases of market pro­visioning. A more appropriate test, according to Smith, is to compare Hirth's observations from Xochicalco against cases where marketplace exchange was known to be prevalent (among the Aztecs or Romans) and where it appears to have been absent or scarcely developed (Andean states). Hirth's approach underscores the need to better understand how other, noncommercial means of domestic provisioning-such as redistribution, gift giving, and small-scale barter-affect the compo­sition of domestic assemblages (Blanton 1998; Hicks 1998). 
Also crucial are the different scales at which marketplace and nonmarketplace transactions occur. Hirth (1998:456, 2000: 188-189) concen­trates on uniformity in material culture assemblages among households of different social rank. I sug­gest that an equally important indicator of market­place exchange concerns the uniformity of material culture assemblages over a large area. Localized, nonmarketplace-provisioning networks-for example, kin-based networks of exchange (Abbott 2000; Sahlins 1972)-may generate uniform household compositions among a group of house­holds but at a much smaller scale than in market contexts. Households in nonmarketplace contexts are more apt to procure domestic wares through a variety of exchange networks and/or manufacture their own wares. In the Tonto Basin of eastern Ari­zona (from A.D. 1320 to A.D. 1450), for example, Rice and colleagues (1998: 129) found that indi­vidual settlements independently and separately established external trade contacts, resulting in domestic assemblages that are uniform at a local scale (within individual settlements) but are het­erogeneous at a regional scale. In market contexts, conversely, household inventories are likely to be relatively uniform over a large area (i.e., the area serviced by a single market center), albeit with some degree of variability resulting from differ­

ences in consumer preferences and purchasing power (see Smith 1999). 
According to Hirth (1998:455), other central­ized forms of provisioning, such as redistribution, also might generate modest interhousehold uni­formity but not to the same extent or in the same way as marketplace exchange. Redistribution trans­actions adhere to political networks and, therefore, product distributions will exhibit sociopolitical linkages, rather than a common provisioning source available to all households. Furthermore, it is unlikely that redistribution networks will incorpo­rate everyday domestic goods, such as utilitarian wares that are subject to frequent use-related stress and need to be frequently replaced (e.g., domestic cooking pots). Few, if any, premodern governments possessed the resources or organizational efficiency required to redistribute domestic wares over a large area. With respect to common domestic goods, therefore, redistribution systems likely generate less uniform domestic inventories over a large area than marketplace exchange systems. 
Another critique of the distributional approach concerns Hirth's tendency to treat marketplace exchange as a presence-absence phenomenon (Hassig 1998; Wilk 1998). The size and organiza­tional structures of market systems varied consid­erably in different times and places in the ancient and modem world (Smith 1974, 1976). Hirth does not address how diverse market organizations dif­ferently affect the composition of domestic artifact assemblages. Directly relevant to Hirth's approach is Bohannan and Dalton's (1962; see also Kurtz 
1974) study of markets in Africa, which demon­strates variability in the extent to which households in different areas rely on marketplace exchange to procure basic provisions. In peripheral market con­texts, households do not rely on the marketplace for most of their basic provisions. Rather, '"periph­eral' markets are patronized chiefly by 'target mar­keters,' who trade in the market when they happen to have a surplus to exchange or need some item they do not produce" (Hicks 1987:9 1). Differen­tial use of marketplaces may occur among elite and nonelite households and among urban and rural populations within the broader market system. In fully integrated market contexts, conversely, the majority of households rely on marketplace exchange to procure all or most everyday provi­sions. One challenge for archaeologists is to infer

subregional variation in "market integration" among households. The method developed here provides a tool for evaluating market integration among households of different rank or at varying spatial scales. 
To my knowledge, since Hirth published his article in 1998, no follow-up studies have been devised to address these concerns and to empiri­cally test or refine the distributional approach. My goal here is to expand on Hirth's approach and address some of his critics. I introduce an alterna­tive method of identifying marketplace exchange using a diversity measure (Mangurran 1988, 2004; Pielou 1975) that quantifies variability among household artifact collections over a large area. The data used for this study come from Middle Post­classic period (ca. A.D. 1200-A.D. 1350) sherd and obsidian collections from the lower Blanco region in the Mexican Gulf lowlands (Figure 1). These materials are from surface collections of the Proyecto Arqueol6gico La Mixtequilla (PALM) in south-central Veracrnz (Stark 1991, 2006). 
To infer whether marketplace exchange was prevalent in the lower Blanco region, I first com­pare diversity scores from a known context of mar­ketplace exchange-Late Postclassic Teotihuacan (Garraty 1998, 2000, 2006a)-against the Middle Postclassic lower Blanco region, an unknown con­text, which addresses Smith's critique of Hirth's approach. The comparative study suggests a prob­able marketplace exchange system in the lower Blanco region during the Middle Postclassic period, likely focused at El Sauce, the only known Middle Postclassic center in the region . I also analyze intraregional distributional changes in diversity sta­tistics and in obsidian prismatic blade concentra­tions to infer the approximate radius of El Sauce's market service area, which provide an empirical means of assessing market integration as a func­tion of distance from the market center. This sec­ond analysis deals with the spatial dimensions of market integration in the lower Blanco region and helps to address Hassig's ( 1998) and Wilk's ( 1998) point that marketplace exchange cannot be reduced to a simple presence-absence phenomenon. 
I want to be clear that in this article, I am more concerned with methodology than with substantive interpretation or culture history. My goal is not to develop definitive conclusions about marketplace development and exchange in the lower Blanco region. Rather, my purpose is to demonstrate the efficacy of the approach used here to operational­ize the distributional approach in hopes that the method developed here will be critically evaluated and adapted for similar studies in other archaeo­logical contexts.

Measuring Diversity 
Diversity measures, which are most frequently used for studies of ecological biodiversity, provide a simple way of quantifying and comparing differ­ences among a set of analytical units using a mul­tivariate dataset (Pielou 197 5, 1977; for discussions of diversity measures in archaeology, see Kintigh [1984], Lanata [1996], and the papers compiled in Leonard and Jones [ 1989]). The variables might refer to, for example, animal species or, in this case, distinct pottery types; analytical units may be sam­pling loci (e.g., surface collections) or distinct ecosystems. Diversity measures can be loosely grouped into three types: richness, evenness, and heterogeneity.2 Richness is simply the number of variables present in an analytical unit. For exam­ple, an ecosystem sustaining 20 plant species is richer than one sustaining 15 species. Evenness measures deviation between observed variable pro­portions for a given case and a hypothetical even distribution of variables. For example, in a dataset with four variables, "perfect evenness" is defined as 25 percent per variable; evenness statistics thus measure the cumulative differences between observed percentages and perfect evenness across all variables. 
The diversity measure used for the study­broadly referred to as heterogeneity-follows the same basic principle as evenness. Rather than cal­culating differences from perfect evenness, how­ever, heterogeneity is the differences in the variable composition between each analytical unit and a hypothetical standard or "representative" variable composition, which forms the "expected" propor­tions against which observed proportions are com­pared. In this study, the hypothetical collection-unit composition is calculated as the variable (column) percentages over all cases combined (Boone 
1987:340). In other words, the expected reference assemblage is simply the row percentages calcu­lated from the sums of counts for each variable or category. In some cases, it may be more appropri­ate to use an "external" dataset that represents an idealized set of proportions. 
The heterogeneity measure (Hscore) employed here is loosely based on Boone's ( 1987) method of calculating interassemblage diversity in medieval North Africa. Following Boone's approach, I define "perfect heterogeneity" as the "global" or overall proportions of each category (j) among all cases within a site or region (i). In this study, the cases are the individual surface collections, which pre­sumably represent debris generated by one or sev­eral nearby households; the variables include various pottery type categories. The global type proportions-that is, the reference dataset­compose the "expected" values (P ;) against which the individual collection proportions (P;) are eval­uated. The H score is the sum of the squared devi­ations between the observed per-unit percentages and the "expected" percentages across all type cat­egories (k[P .. -p. .]2). This calculation yields a sin­
'l lj •
gle, positive score for each collection. Lower scores indicate that the observed percentages closely resemble the "expected" percentages, suggesting greater uniformity. Higher scores suggest that one or more categories dominate the collection, indi­cating greater heterogeneity: 
Boone's calculation includes a complex weight­ing procedure in which each percentage is stan­dardized as a ratio of one of the category's proportions (which one is not important), which is meant to control for variability in discard rates of different artifact types (Boone 1987:340). For this study, controlling for the differential discard inten­sities is beside the point. Kintigh (2002) offers a simpler way of calculating distances between indi­vidual collections and overall type percentages by using Brainerd-Robinson coefficients of similarity (BR) (Brainerd 195 1; Robinson 195 1). The BR coefficient is the sum of the differences between these percentages across alll variables subtracted from 200, thereby generating an integer between 0 and 200 in which a score of 200 represents maxi­mum homogeneity. For ease of interpretation, the BR coefficients can be scaled as proportional val­ues so that lower scores indicate greater intercol­lection uniformity and higher scores indicate heterogeneity (see Kintigh 2002).3 
Heterogeneity measures offer a useful way of evaluating the existence of marketplace exchange, as defined by Hirth's distributional approach. As long as the cases (collections) correspond to domes­tic consumption units (one or a few households), and the categories compose relatively distinct com­modities or units of purchase (visually distinct dec­orated pottery types or suites of similar types), then the mean or median heterogeneity scores among a set of domestic artifact collections can potentially

reveal the relative "degree" to which households over a large area obtained goods from a common provisioning source, presumably a central market­place (see above for rationale). Low H scores thus potentially suggest marketplace exchange, and high Hscores suggest multiple, presumably nonmarket provisioning sources. 
When interpreting H scores, one must be mind­ful of the many other possible bases for variation among a set of collections, including natural and cultural formation processes (see Plunkett 1998). For these reasons, artifact compositions inevitably vary among collections to some extent, given sam­pling vagaries and interhousehold differences in domestic activities, consumer preferences, and pur­chasing power. It is therefore unreasonable to expect very uniform domestic artifact collections (i.e., H scores at or near zero). Even in contexts in which a single marketplace provisioned all house­holds over a large area, a certain degree of "toler­ance" of intercollection variability is appropriate. However, it is reasonable to predict that households serviced by a central marketplace or market sys­tem over a large area, on average, will have more uniform artifact collections (lower H scores) than households in contexts where marketplace exchange was absent or poorly developed. For the present analysis, I expect that the data from Late Postclassic Teotihuacan will generate lower H scores than the data from the lower Blanco region, if marketplace exchange was not prevalent in the latter area. 
Using Heterogeneity to Identify Marketplace Exchange 
Heterogeneity is only useful as a relative, not an absolute, measure of diversity among the collec­tions (see Kintigh 1989:26). It is therefore only suited for comparing collections, for example, within or among sites and regions. One pertinent use of this method is to calculate mean or median H scores for pooled collection units over a region or site (or locality wilthin a site) so that different sites or subregions can be compared. The H statis­tic works particularly well where one can compare the scores from a known case of marketplace exchange against an unknown case (see below). Ideally, the sites or regions chosen for analysis roughly correspond to the area serviced by a sin­gle marketplace or market system, preferably a large area subjected to full-coverage, systematic survey. (Excavation projects seldom encompass a large enough area for robust interhousehold analy­ses over such a large area.) 
Interpreting intercollection heterogeneity is fraught with complications, however. First, the H statistic, like most statistical measures, is suscep­tible to sampling vagaries: small sample sizes may artificially inflate H scores, which are calculated from percentages (Boone 1987: 341; Kintigh 1989:29). In some cases, it may be necessary to combine individual collections into larger units of analysis to achieve more robust sample sizes. One also must avoid including one or two unusually large collections among a set of cases, or else those very large cases will overwhelm-in effect, define-the overall percentages (based on the col­umn sums across all collections) from which H scores are derived. 
A potentially more troubling problem is inher­ent in defining the scale of analysis. As explained above, for example, uniformity among a group of domestic artifact assemblages may occur on a small scale, even in nonmarket, localized exchange set­tings. Marketplace exchange likely generate more homogeneous domestic assemblages over a much larger area. However, at larger scales, archaeolo­gists may unknowingly study a region that incor­porated two or more separate market systems in ancient times, producing a "boundary problem" (see Johnson 1977:498) that skews the regional homogeneity results. Blanton's (1996:59) cross­cultural study of early market systems is helpful in determining the expected size of a single market­place's service area. A "standard market area," according to Blanton ( 1996:59), ranges from about 50 to 200 km2 in area with radii ranging from 4 to 9 km. Blanton's observation provides a useful base­line for interpreting whether a study area incorpo­rates one market zone area or several adjacent zones. As explained below, the two survey areas compared for this study roughly correspond to the 
expected service area for a single market center. 
Despite these problems, heterogeneity measures have the potential to illuminate the long-term evo­lution of premodem economies and market systems in contexts where written records are unavailable (but see Carrasco [ 1998] for a contrary perspective). First, comparing H scores from different periods may shed light on the nascent development of mar-

ketplace exchange, the tempo of market integration over time, and the expansion and contraction of market zones. Second, because market participa­tion in peasant-market societies is typically uneven (Plattner 1989: 188-190; Smith 1972:215; Wan­mali 198 1 ), comparing H scores in different sub­areas of a region may elucidate differences in market participation among urban and rural com­munities or between elite and nonelite populations. Third, comparisons of Hscores among artifact cat­egories (e.g., fine vs. domestic goods) may provide insights into differences in the scales and mecha­nisms of exchange for different classes of com­modities. 
In the remainder of this article, I use the H sta­tistic to analyze archaeological surface collections from the lower Blanco region. As stated above, my principal objective is not to derive conclusive evi­dence of marketplace exchange. In some cases, sample sizes are simply too small to permit robust analyses. The case study is meant to demonstrate the efficacy of using H scores to operationalize the distributional approach and provide a touchstone for similar studies. 
Inferring Marketplace Exchange from a Known to an Unknown Context 
In this section, I compare surface sherd collections from Late Postclassic (Aztec) Teotihuacan (ca. A.D. 1350-A.D. I 520), a known locus of market­place exchange, with collections from the Middle Postclassic lower Blanco region (ca. A.D. 1200-A.D. 1400), an unknown locus for market­place exchange. The data for the comparative study come from surface collections taken during two full-coverage systematic survey projects. Before presenting the results, I first introduce the survey projects and the sherd collections used for the study. 
The Survey Projects 
The surface collections from the lower Blanco region come from the Proyecto Arqueologfa La Mixtequilla (PALM), directed by Barbara Stark (1991, 2006) in the 1980s, 1990s, and early 2000s (Figure 2). Although the PALM project covered a total area of 99 km2 in several noncontiguous sur­vey blocks, the present study focuses exclusively on the Central Block (49.2 km2) and six smaller blocks (surveyed by Speaker [2001] in 1989) sur­rounding it (22.4 km2), which together encompass 
61.8 km2. The other PALM survey blocks are excluded from this study because they possessed very few or no surface sherd collections assigned to the Middle Postclassic period. The Late Post­classic Teotihuacan data come from the surface col­lections of the Teotihuacan Mapping Project (TMP), directed by Rene Millon (1973; Millon et al. 1973) in the 1960s (Figure 3). The TMP survey encom­passed a 36-km2 contiguous survey block and includes one Late Postclassic center, San Juan Teoti­huacan (Garraty 2000, 2006a). 
Of importance, even though Teotihuacan is typ­ically conceived as a "site," and the PALM survey area covered part of a large "region," the sizes of the two coverage areas are not drastically different The portion of the PALM study area considered for this study is roughly 25 km2 larger than the TMP survey area. Even so, both projects encompass sur­vey areas that fall within the range that might have been serviced by a single marketplace, based on Blanton's estimates (see above). Both projects were essentially "nonsite" surveys predicated on record­ing and collecting individual surface features, such as house mounds or discrete artifact concentra­tions, over a large and continuous area. In both pro­jects, each surface collection likely represents artifact accumulations relating to one or perhaps a few nearby households. I therefore consider the two survey areas to be suitable for comparison.4 
Both surveys areas also llikely include a single center and surrounding settlements. The 36-km2 TMP survey area includes the known market cen­ter of San Juan Teotihuacan and its immediate sur­rounding territory. San Juan very likely housed a central marketplace that served the local commu­nity in the Teotihuacan area during the Late Post­classic period (Garraty 2006a). The Central Block and surrounding blocks in the PALM survey area includes El Sauce, the only known Middle Post­classic center in the lower Blanco region, and sur­rounding residences (Curet et al. 1994; Garraty and Stark 2002). If a central marketplace was present in the region, it likely would have been located at El Sauce. 
Both regions also included pottery and obsid­ian producers that may have vended their wares in marketplaces. Late Postclassic (Aztec) pottery was produced at a number of locations in the Basin of Mexico and trafficked through an extensive

regional market system (Garraty 2006b; Hodge and Mine 1990; Mine 1994, 2006; Nichols et al. 2002). To date, no pottery production loci have been iden­tified at Aztec Teotihuacan or any other site. Spence (1985) has detected a number of obsidian manu­facturing loci within the TMP survey area, how­ever. In the lower Blanco region, Curet (1993) located a Middle Postclassic community special­izing in the production of comales (tortilla griddles) roughly two kilometers east of El Sauce. Stark and Garraty (2004) also detected a probable production locus for decorated bichrome bowls (local-style Black-on-red and Black-on-orange wares) roughly 12 kilometers southeast of El Sauce (see Figure 2). Both comales and bichrome bowls are well repre­sented in collections throughout the Central Block and may have been sold in a marketplace at El Sauce. Heller (2000) identified an obsidian pro­duction locus within El Sauce, which also likely would have been sold in the local marketplace, if one existed. 
The Sherd Collections 
The sherd categories used for calculating H scores include visually distinguishable sherd types or suites of similar types; each of these categories likely comprised a distinct class of salable market commodities. In both the PALM and TMP datasets, sherds were coded using a type-variety system (pre­sented in Hodge and Mine [ 1991] for the Basin of Mexico collections and in Stark [ 1995] for the lower Blanco collections). I combined a number of similar types and variants from both survey areas into larger categories to bolster variable frequen­cies (i.e., to avoid a large number of zero cell fre­quencies). I previously combined types and variants for statistical analyses of both the TMP (Garraty 2006a :Table 1) and PALM sherd datasets (Garraty and Stark 2002:Table 1).
