GARBAGE OF THE GODS? SQUAT TERS, REFUSE DISPOSAL, AND 
TERMINATION RITUALS AMONG THE ANCIENT MAYA

Differentiating
the material patterning between domestic refuse from squatters and ceremonial trash generated from ter­mination rituals has been difficult for Maya archaeologists. Rich floor assemblages, especially from elite contexts, have been interpreted as "decadent" squatter refuse by some researchers and the remains of abandonment rituals by others. The identification and separation of these classes of behavior are essential for interpretations of floor assemblages. In this paper, we examine data from numerous contexts, in order to contextualize the debate over the interpretation of these two models. Ethnoarchaeological, ethnohistoric, and archaeological data indicate that close scrutiny of the context and material com­position of such deposits are needed to distinguish these very different 
classes of behavior.

ture, such disparate interpretations of midden-like deposits on the floors of abandoned elite-civic struc­tures are problematic. Yet it is the ambiguous nature of some of these contexts that has raised the cur­rent debate concerning domestic middens and rit­ual deposits. On a superficial level these types of archaeological deposits tend to look similar. Closer examination of many deposits identified as squat­ter refuse, however, reveals that they can yield dis­tinct patterning not expected for domestic refuse disposal. Unfortunately, the patterning of these problematical deposits remains confusing to archaeologists focused on the analysis of elite floor assemblages despite some attempts to classify them as the remains of ritual activity. 
The current debate hinges on numerous midden­like deposits found primarily in elite-civic archi­tectural contexts (e.g., on palace or temple floors) throughout the Maya lowlands and beyond (Fig­ure 1). Although such deposits are often ascribed to "squatter" activity, ethnoarchaeological models of refuse disposal do not predict that domestic mid­dens should be encountered in these contexts (e.g., functioning ex-elite houses in pre-abandonment stages [as implied by Thompson 1954] or aban­doned temple superstructures located above settle­ment zones). The squatter model was advanced by Thompson ( 1954) over 50years ago without much supporting evidence. Others have adopted the model without critical reflection on its theoretical grounding (e.g., Pendergast 1979). Unfortunately, the squatter model does not employ ideas con­cerning abandonment processes and implicitly assumes all refuse to be generated from relatively similar processes. For Thompson, the fact that elite floor deposits superficially resemble domestic refuse proves that squatters were living decadently in elite temples and palaces, throwing large amounts of trash irreverently on floors near or at the location where the squatters were living. Work on termination rituals has been the first attempt to really challenge this assumption. We believe, how­ever, that before we begin to call such floor deposit the remains of termination rituals or squatter activ­ity, we should take a step back and consider for­mation processes and alternative models in more detail. 
We argue that these two general models (squat­ters and ritual abandonment) could be further inves­tigated. First, the squatter model could be further developed to explain what kind of formation processes (e.g., dumping in already abandoned structures or gradual abandonment processes) could have resulted in such deposits. Supporting the squatter model with more detailed evidence will move us away from the type of speculation that plagued Thompson 's work. Moreover, the idea of squatters could be flushed out more. This is a term whose definition is often assumed, but rarely artic­ulated. Second, models focused on abandonment or post-abandonment ritual behaviors need to be further explored and developed with more quanti­tative studies (Pagliaro et al. 2003). One of these models relies on the idea that some structures were subjected to termination rituals during extensive renovations or at abandonment. Progress toward the quantification of termination deposits is being made, but much work remains. Other related mod­els could include a host of post-abandonment ritu­als that have yet to be explored. 
This article is an attempt to contextualize the squatter/termination ritual debate and identify the primary questions to be explored by future inves­tigations. Despite recent work on termination ritu­als, the interpretational problems associated with both sides of the debate have been rarely articulated. Using numerous examples from the literature to establish material patterning, we explore the con­texts and depositional processes that affected numerous floor deposits throughout the Maya low­lands. We begin by considering how floor deposits form in pre-abandonment, abandonment, and post­abandonment contexts, in order to establish a range of models for domestic refuse deposition. Turning to a consideration of termination rituals, we discuss several problematical deposits. Finally, we con­clude with a discussion of the major questions that continue to face archaeologists working with such deposits. 
Where the Garbage Goes in 
Pre-Abandonment Contexts 

To begin a discussion contrasting ancient Maya domestic and ceremonial trash, we should start with what we know about ancient Maya refuse disposal in pre-abandonment contexts (cf. Deal 1998:117-126). What does refuse disposal look like in a normally functioning Maya household? Ethnohistories and ethnoarchaeological studies are

logical places to search for comparisons with archaeological refuse. Ethnohistoric evidence, however, is very scanty. Bishop Diego de Landa described purification rituals that Contact period Maya undertook in maintaining their houses and temples (Tozzer 1941: 151-152). Landa stated that domestic structures were kept clean by regular sweeping and annual renovations in which some of the household material culture was replaced. The resulting refuse was disposed in dumps located outside of towns. Although Landa's descriptions suggest that the Maya kept their houses clean, his focus was on annual rather than daily cleaning activities. Further, Landa examined behavior in

households where there is no indication that aban­donment processes were operating. Descriptions of abandoned houses are virtually nonexistent in the ethnohistoric literature. It is unknown whether abandoned structures were regularly used for refuse disposal during the early Colonial period. Landa only mentions refuse dumps that were located away from communities, leaving the answer to this ques­tion ambiguous. 
Ethnoarchaeological investigations throughout Mesoamerica have been able to fill some of the gaps present in the ethnohistoric literature. The most informative of these studies have come from research in the Maya highlands (Deal 1985, 1998; Hayden 1979; Hayden and Cannon 1983, 1984a, l 984b ). In a study of Tzeltal and Chuj informant responses, Hayden and Cannon (1984b; see also Deal 1998: 117) found that several principles gov­erned discard behavior: (1) economy of effort, (2) potential value of refuse, and (3) potential hin­drance by refuse. When combined with specific situations and types of refuse, Hayden and Cannon argued that these principles produced particular disposal behaviors that have been noted in various modern societies (Beck 2006:30; Kamp 1991; Sutro 1991; Wilson et al. 1991; Brian McKee, per­sonal communication 2007). 
Operating within these principles several stereo­typical discard behaviors were generated by Deal (1985, 1998) in a study of 160 modem Tzeltal Maya households in highland Chiapas. In relation to refuse accumulation within structure boundaries, three of these behaviors are relevant: provisional discard, maintenance disposal, and dumping dis­posal. Provisional discard refers to the disposal of items that have become unusable in terms of their original function. Such items, however, may still have value; potential to be repaired or used for some other function. Objects that are provisionally discarded enter a sort of refuse limbo. They are placed in areas where they can be easily retrieved, but do not interfere with daily activities. Some of these items are never retrieved and remain in these contexts after abandonment. In a similar ethnoar­chaeological study of houselots in the Tuxtlas region of the Mexican Gulf Coast, Killion ( 1992: 126) notes that provisionally discarded items usually are stored in the structural core, where the main buildings of the houselot are located. Main­tenanc¢ disposal consists of the effects of cleaning where refuse accumulates. In addition to high traf­fic areas such as patios where refuse is swept or picked up and tossed or carried away (see also Kil­lion 1992: 127-128), maintenance disposal focuses on hard to sweep areas, or artifact traps (e.g., under beds). Dumping disposal is the discard of refuse in dump sites within a household compound (outside of functioning architectural contexts) or at neigh­borhood refuse dumps (see Beck 2006:38-39 for a cross-cultural comparison). While Deal (1985, 1998) does not identify the dumping of refuse in . abandoned structures, such behavior is certainly possible. In Deal's pre-abandonment model, refuse may accumulate around patio edges and in out of the way areas, but floors and patio areas are kept relatively clean. Thus, refuse does not accumulate in appreciable amounts in these contexts and what refuse does accumulate tends to be small artifacts that are trapped in hard to clean areas. 
Deal's (1985, 1998) study finds parallels in other ethnoarchaeological studies. For example, Hayden (1979; see also Deal 1985, 1998; Hayden and Can­non 1983) found that functioning Maya houses were kept relatively devoid of refuse. He states that "all structures were kept extremely clean. The only refuse in the kitchen was a few pieces of broken comal used as a windbreak for the fire" (Hayden 1979:200). Refuse was not kept in functioning houses, nor was it observed that abandoned struc­tures were used as refuse dumps. It was often deposited in community dumps (Hayden and Can­non 1983) away from structures or in household refuse areas between 2 and 23 meters from occu­pied structures (Hayden 1979:200, 216). While the placement of refuse within this zone may be vari­able and dependent upon the domestic lot size and composition (see Arnold 1991; Santley 1992), this pattern has been confirmed by further ethnoar­chaeological and archaeological research (Beck 2006; Hutson and Stanton 2006, 2007; Hutson et al. 2007; Joyce and Johannessen 1993; Robin 2002). 
Some of the best archaeological data regarding this occupational stage of refuse disposal in south­ern Mesoamerica come from the site of Ceren, El Salvador, a site that was rapidly abandoned and buried due to volcanic activity (see McKee 1999; McKee and Sheets 2003; Sheets 1992, 1998, 2000, 2002). Data from this site suggest that relatively little refuse was in association with houseftoors at

the time of abandonment (see Beaudry-Corbett et al. 2002; McKee 2002). These data also suggest, however, that some provisional discard stored in rafters has the potential for being mistaken for other types of deposits such as the remains of termina­tion rituals. Provisional discard might leave patterns of isolated sherd scatters on the floors of structures (partial vessels fallen from decayed rafters or stored under perishable furniture). Additionally, provi­sional discard might be found in niches such as the whole vessel found in a niche of Str. M8-8 of Aguateca (lnomata 2003 :51 ). Noncurated artifacts left as de facto refuse might also present problems of interpretation as well. Yet as we will explain in more detail below, many of the deposits in ques­tion have far more material than we might expect for provisional discard or de facto refuse explana­tions. Further, a variety of materials (marl and frag­mented bone) we might not expect to be provisionally discarded are often present in these deposits 5uggesting some other type of activity. 
Recent archaeological work at Chunchucmil, Yucatan also supports the ethnoarchaeological model described above (Hutson and Stanton 2006, 2007; Hutson et al. 2007; Magnani et al. 2008). The large Early Classic occupation of this site is ideal for exploring activity areas and refuse disposal, because many of the residential groups are bounded by stone walls, or albarradas, that often form walk­ways (Magnani 1995). Thus, spatial relationships among open lots, structures, and walkways are well preserved. Two small adjacent patio groups were intensively investigated between 1999 and 2001 with the intent to test Deal's (1985, 1998) eth­noarchaeological model of refuse disposal. We dis­cuss the data from the A' ak Group here. 
The A' ak Group is a small group with four struc­tures centered around a patio and one ancillary structure to the north (Figure 2). Comparable to the houselots examined in the aforementioned eth­noarchaeological studies, its albarrada walls enclose an area of 3,910 m2. A 2-x-2-m grid was placed across the entire houselot and intensive sur­face collections were conducted in each grid square. Outside the area of the patio, 5-x-50-cm units were placed on every comer of a five by five meter grid. Although chemical, phytolith, microartifact, and macrobotanical samples were collected from each unit, we only discuss the macroartifacts collected in the 114 inch screens here. Figure 2 illustrates the densities of ceramic artifacts across the solar area of the group. It is clear that artifact patterning con­forms to the Deal's ethnoarchaeological model. Sherds were encountered in greater quantities near the edges of patios or in "out of the way" areas between structures. Additionally, middens were encountered near the ancillary structure and between Str. 22 and Str. 23. This midden was exposed with a more extensive excavation. In con­trast, the complete horizontal excavations of Str. 23 and Str. 24 did not yield high artifact densities (Hut­son 2000, 2004 ). Artifact densities in and around Str. 22 were also generally low, though fragments of provisionally discarded vessels were found around the structure's edges (Hutson et al. 2004). In addition to supporting the ethnoarchaeological model of refuse disposal in pre-abandonment households, the Chunchucmil data suggest that in some cases abandonment processes do not result in deposition on housefloors, a conclusion sup­ported by numerous archaeological examples of domestic floors that are relatively devoid of refuse (e.g., Fitting 1979:367; Hammond and Gerhardt 1990:476; Thomas 198 1; Webster and Gonlin 1988: 187). 
While these data may be probabilistic in the sense that future archaeological investigations may reveal examples that do not conform to the eth­noarchaeological model, they suggest that we should look beyond pre-abandonment refuse dis­posal to explain the extensive deposits found on many civic-elite floors in the Maya area. Neither the ethnoarchaeological nor the archaeological studies presented above indicate that people under normal circumstances live in the "decadent" squalor implied by the squatter model. Since no adequate reason is given as to why squatters, if indeed squatters were responsible for the deposits in question, would live in filth, we must look to alternative models of squatter refuse deposition such as abandonment processes and dumping dis­posal. 
The Impact of Abandonment

the questions of how abandonment processes may impact archaeological floor assemblages or whether refuse dumping occurs in abandoned houses are not fully addressed in the ethnoarchae­ological literature on the Maya. Archaeological and ethnoarchaeological studies of abandonment (see Cameron 1991; Cameron and Tomka 1993; Ino­mata and Webb 2003; Stevenson 1982) indicate that the processes of abandonment can shape the nature and composition of archaeological floor deposits. A consideration of this literature can help to elucidate the patterning found in floor contexts. 
Several ethnoarchaeological and archaeologi­cal studies have demonstrated that when the aban­donment of a settlement or structure is anticipated, there is a higher likelihood that maintenance

processes will be performed with less regularity (Deal 1998:126-127; Plunket and Uruiiela 2003; Schiffer 1987:97-98; Stevenson 1982). Thus, the process of anticipated abandonment results in the accumulation of refuse in areas that would nor­mally be kept clean in pre-abandonment contexts. If there is anticipated return, objects may be cached. For example, Plunket and Uruiiela (2003: 16) found that prior to the first century A.D. eruption of Popocatepetl, many of the houses at Tetimpa, Puebla had been cleaned and the material culture (e.g., ceramic vessels and metates) placed in stor­age positions (e.g., comers ofrooms). Since the vol­canic activity prevented these objects from ever being used again, they became part of the archae­ological record. 
Rapid abandonment, such as at Ceren (Sheets 2002) or Aguateca (Inomata 1997, 2003 ), may also lead to the deposition of high quantities of objects on room floors. The idea is that when people are forced to flee due to factors such as warfare or epi­demics they take only what they can carry with them. Gradual abandonment, a much more com­mon process, tends to lead to the curation and trans­port of more material culture since people have time to move their belongings (Deal 1998: 126). 
In the most extreme cases of abandonment processes resulting in high-density artifact accu­mulation, we might expect all of the original objects stored or used in a structure to remain in and around their original architectural contexts (assuming that postdepositional processes like bioturbation have not heavily affected the contexts). De facto refuse and the remains of provisional discard might litter a floor where these objects had been left, or might even be mixed in roof fall if they had been stored in the rafters of a structure. We would also expect these objects to fit their architectural context (e.g., not to find burnt and broken jade on a kitchen floor or large amounts of burned and fragmented animal bone in a space used for sleeping). Higher amounts of refuse might be located on floors, but probably not to the extent that people would be tripping over the deposits. Very high-density or extensive deposits on floors, out-of-place material culture (including human remains), and unusual abandon­ment activity such as the intensive burning found at Aguateca (Inomata 1997, 2003) should indicate that models (dumping or ritual activity) other than anticipated abandonment should be explored to explain the "problematical" archaeological pat­terning often found on floors in elite-civic contexts. 
Post-Abandonment Dumping Behavior 
Post-abandonment dumping behavior is another possibility to explain the final deposits found on many elite-civic floors in the Maya area. Although the manner in which Thompson ( 1954) and others (e.g., Pendergast 1979, 1982, 1990) phrase their explanations of these deposits is to suggest that in some cases Terminal Classic "squatters" were dumping refuse in abandoned rooms, indicating a breakdown of Classic period norms, the question that arises from this hypothesis is: what would post­abandonment dumping look like? 
Unfortunately, very little work has been done on post-abandonment dumping. While most of the ethnoarchaeological research done on refuse dis­posal covers the idea of dumping refuse in discreet areas away from functioning households, not very much of this literature focuses on the practice of dumping inside abandoned structures. While many archaeologists who have lived in traditional com­munities know that this practice exists in modem contexts (e.g., Hutson et al. 2007; Rothschild et al. 1993:125), there are very few data concerning its nature. 
Archaeologically, clear examples of post­abandonment dumping disposal are hard to find due to their confusion with termination deposits. At Ceren, Beaudry-Corbett et al. (2002:49) identify Str. 5 as standing, but having fallen into disuse prior to the Loma Caldera eruption. Several "small sherds and a handful of broken and worn obsidian blades found scattered on and around the structure platform" (Beaudry-Corbett et al. 2002:49) may indicate that small amounts of refuse were being disposed of at this location. If so, however, it was not the kind of refuse dump that might be inter­preted as termination deposits discussed in detail later in this paper. We cite this example from Ceren, because there has been very little work published to distinguish dumping behavior from termination rituals in the archaeological literature. Although the Ceren example does not help us make this dis­tinction very well, it is one of the few examples of possible refuse disposal in an abandoned structure. In fact, although domestic middens in general have been unquestionably identified by researchers 
Downloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core. YBP Library Services, on 22 Aug 2018 at 17:38:31, subject to the Cambridge Core terms of use, available at https://www.cambridge.org/core/terms. https://doi.org/10.1017/S1045663500007938 
working in the Maya area, descriptions of such deposits are neither common nor extensive. For instance, Haviland (1985: 100) generally defined archaeological refuse as consisting of sherds and other artifacts, as well as animal bones, charcoal, and ashes, while Schortman (1993:64) identified midden as cultural material deposited as the result of purposeful refuse disposal. These types of def­initions are common, but are unproductive for our attempt at distinguishing middens from termination deposits. It is as if Maya archaeologists have a ten­dency to treat domestic middens as an obvious cat­egory that requires little or no description, leading to the masking of potential variation that could be essential for an informed understanding of these types of contexts. 
Beyond the problem of lacking comparative archaeological data, several issues arise with the consideration of dumping behavior. First, we might imagine dumping behavior to be extremely vari­able in regards to formation (e.g., one event vs. several), material consistency (what is being dumped), and further methods of treatment (burn­ing or covering with soil). We would surmise that understanding dumping deposits will require some intensive study, in order to make clear comparisons with termination deposits. A second problem does not simply relate to the lack of ethnoarchaeologi­cal work on dumping behavior, but to the ethnoar­chaeological study of refuse disposal in general. The ethnoarchaeological contexts we have are very different from the archaeological contexts of the deposits in question. Even if further studies are conducted on the ethnoarchaeology of dumping disposal in abandoned structures, we must take care in choosing the context in which this research is conducted. To date, the ethnoarchaeology of refuse disposal has focused on domestic refuse in house­hold contexts. The archaeological deposits in ques­tion generally come from abandoned (e.g., termination rituals or squatter activity) or re-used (squatter activity or post-abandonment ritual behav­ior) elite-civic structures such as temple and palaces. We have no ethnoarchaeological data on similar ethnoarchaeological contexts in abandoned churches or municipal palaces for example. While the proponents of the squatter model might counter that the ancient temples and palaces in question had been converted into domestic space by the pro­posed squatters, this problem should be kept in 
mind since many ancient elite-civic structures were probably not viewed as ordinary architecture. Many of these structures had been highly charged sacred spaces, at most, only several decades prior to the placement of the deposits in question. By explain­ing away what we know about Maya concepts of place, cosmology, and consecration/dedication­termination/undedication by interpreting the sup­posed squatters as profane peoples does little more than portray the Terminal Classic Maya as a peo-. pie fallen from grace, perpetuating the old idea of a decadent Postclassic Maya culture. 
The ambiguous concept of "squatters" also leaves our understanding of how such people would behave rather muddled. Not only do we not have ethnoarchaeological data concerning "squatter" refuse disposal patterns, we are not sure exactly who these squatters were. As used by Maya archae­ologists, the term "squatter" implies someone who re-uses architecture in a domestic fashion after an abandonment episode without the express consent of the previous owners-users. Since re-use is involved, the architecture is no longer technically abandoned. The term also seems to imply a lack of substantial architectural rebuilding or modification. Yet who are the hypothetical people who, during the Terminal Classic, are proposed to have re-used many of the structures that have the problematical deposits discussed here? Were they invaders, com­moners who took over sacred space after the col­lapse of kingship, or remnants of elite families? Each of these cases might present different resi­dential and disposal patterns. Yet except for the pro­posed fine orange invasion (e.g., Sabloff and Willey 1967), we see few attempts to try and distinguish different types of"squatters." We certainly agree that there are data that suggest squatters may have existed in certain contexts (e.g., Child and Golden 2008). Yet they remain very ill-defined in the liter­ature. We feel that the term is useful but that it needs greater clarification using archaeological and ethno­graphic data. Now turning to the following section we discuss the concept of termination rituals as an alternative explanation to the squatter model. 
Termination Rituals as a 
Type of Abandonment Process

extensive and often complex deposits found on 
many elite-civic Maya floors (see Ambrosino et al. 
2003; Ardren 1999; Brown and Garber 2003; Frei­
del et al. 1998, 2003; Inomata 2003; Mock 1994, 
1998; Navarro Farr 2004; Navarro Farr et al. 2008; 
Pagliaro et al. 2003; Stanton and Brown 2003:7-1 O; 
Suhler 1996; Suhler and Freidel 2000, 2003; 
Walker 1998). Sharing some of the same attributes 
as domestic midden deposits, the material corre­
lates of termination rituals can be quite mislead­
ing. Although termination deposits may be found 
in other contexts (e.g., in transposed midden 
deposits where the remains of these rituals were 
swept), they are often found on the floors of aban­
doned elite structures. 
Robert Wauchope (1948:25) and William Coe (1959:94-95) were the first Maya archaeologists to recognize the ritual nature of these deposits (see also Stanton and Brown 2003; Suhler and Freidel 2000). Coe coined the phrase "terminal offering" in reference to a deposit of partial smashed censers on Str. K-5-2°d at Piedras Negras, Guatemala dur­ing the University of Pennsylvania excavations. Satterthwaite (1958:67-70) also identified patterns of intentional building collapse and monument destruction with "hostile" intent at Piedras Negras, although this activity may not have been tempo­rally related to the Str. K-5-2°d deposit. Even with the identification of this type of behavior with rit­ual and possibly hostile activity, subsequent research by the University of Pennsylvania at Tikal rejected this possibility (Shook 1958) in spite of similar patterning (Coe 1990; Coe and Browman 1958:48). Many of these scholars, along with Thompson (1954 ), were convinced that the "debris" associated with many of these deposits were the refuse of squatters living "decadently" in the tem­ples. This model was perpetuated for decades and ; continues to influence the interpretations of elite­
, civic floor deposits in the Maya area (see Brown [1977:263] for an exception). Interestingly, though, archaeologists working at Tikal were also propo­nents of the term "problematical deposit." This term is used to identify deposits that are unexpected given their contexts and are of uncertain function (such as middens on elite structure floors or dis­turbed burials/caches and other deposits that might be the result of ancient dumping of material cul­ture). As we shall discuss in more detail below, this term may provide a useful alternative to mono­interpretational models such as squatters or termi­nation deposits when the data appear too ambigu­ous to distinguish what type of behavior caused deposition. 
Regardless of the utility of the term "problem­atical deposit," recent research indicates that the act of terminating structures should be reconsidered as an alternative explanation to the squatter model or the general explanation of these types of deposits as domestic middens. This work suggests that ter­mination rituals were performed for a variety of dif­ferent reasons including the initiation of new construction episodes, warfare, and structure aban­donment. Detailed analyses of deposits associated with the destruction and abandonment of buildings have been conducted at a number of Maya sites (see Ambrosino et al. 2003; Brown and Garber 2003; Freidel et al. 1998, 2003; Inomata 2003; Mock 1994, 1998; Navarro Farr et al. 2008; Pagliaro et al. 2003; Suhler 1996; Suhler and Freidel 2000, 2003; Walker 1998). Evidence suggests that much of this destruction can be considered the remains of complex rituals of structure termination. Several classes of destructive deposits have already been identified and more will likely be teased out of complex stratigraphic deposits in the future. Although each class of deposit has been associated with different behaviors, all termination deposits appear to have one thing in common: the intent to ritually "kill" an object, structure, person, or place. This behavior results in what Walker ( 1995) terms "kratophanous material culture": material culture purposefully removed from dynamic cultural con­texts, in order to contest their continued use. 
To briefly summarize the ideas behind termi­nation rituals, research suggests that the ancient Maya believed that their world was animate. Power derived from sacred landscapes and material objects, or deceased ancestors could be manipu­lated by social agents. Ritual behavior focused on imbuing or charging these sources of power with life, termed "consecration rituals," is known from ethnographic sources (see McGee 1998; Stross 1998: Vogt 1998). House animating rituals involv­ing the sacrifice and consumption of chickens with the burial of the heads facing the cardinal directions is a well-known ethnographic example of structure animation (Vogt 1998). The house must be fed dur­ing the ritual, because it is in the process of becom­ing alive. Caching behavior is an often-cited

example of the remains of consecration rituals from the archaeological record (see Pendergast 1998). Archaeologists generally argue that much of the caching behavior we see in archaeological contexts reflects behavior similar to the ethnographic ani­mating rituals just mentioned. Yet there appear not only to have been rituals of symbolic charging and rejuvenation in the past, but rituals of decharging and destruction as well. We call these "termination rituals." In the ethnographic record, termination rit­uals are generally associated with death (Stross 1998:37; Vogt 1998:27-29). Stross (1998:37),how­ever, notes that the ritual "abandonment of houses in Mesoamerica involves pulling down one or more comer posts, and often the roof, usually accompa­nied by copal incense purification, prayers, and other offerings." This architectural destruction in the ethnographic record resonates with the ideas of architectural destruction proposed by those for­warding the termination model. 
In many archaeological contexts, especially from elite-civic architecture, we find patterns that suggest the deliberate destruction of buildings, as well as the breaking and deposition of material cul­ture. Although these deposits can in some ways mimic patterns of domestic refuse disposal, we argue that their contexts often differentiate them from what we would expect from domestic refuse disposal. They more resemble the ritual acts of destruction that occur during the ethnographic structure abandonment described by Stross (1998:37). Our prior research goals regarding ter­mination deposits have primarily focused on deposits related to violent conflict (Brown and Gar­ber 2003; Pagliaro et al. 2003; Stanton and Brown 2003; Stanton and Gallareta Negron 2001). These deposits are termed "desecratory termination rit­ual deposits." Other types of termination deposits have been identified, however, highlighting the poorly understood variability of "killing" a struc­ture. Other termination deposits include those from reverential ritual behavior. These deposits have been described by researchers working at Cerros (Freidel 1986; Garber 1981; Walker 1998) and in the Belize River Valley (Pagliaro et al. 1998, 2003). 
Desecratory termination deposits were formed by the violent destruction of artifacts and architec­ture after some type of conflict. Such conflict could be conquest warfare or internal factional competi­tion. Regardless of the type of conflict, selected structures were sometimes ritually "killed," in order to symbolically destroy (or kill) the symbols of the "enemy." Given our prior research goals we will highlight this type of termination deposit to demon­strate some of the reasons why the ancient Maya ritually terminated structures. Some of the archae­ological examples we give in the following section may be associated with warfare. Yet since many of these deposits are problematical, they may repre­sent a wide variety of different behaviors. Our point in the following sections is to distinguish these problematical deposits from what we would expect from domestic refuse to look like. 
Desecratory Termination Ritual Deposits 
Desecratory termination rituals could be interpreted as relating to the worldwide practice of sacking. Sacking is well-known from many parts of the world. Whether the people instigating the sacking were external like the Viking raiders of the English coast or internal like the French revolutionaries. buildings were often burned or dismantled, valu­ables were looted, people were killed, monuments were defaced, and so forth. Sacking can be ritual­ized and undertaken for reasons other than per­sonal gain. The situation here, however, is more complex as the Maya highly ritualized this behav­ior. In this case some sacking was part of a destruc­tion ritual geared to desecrate and remove sacred power from objects, monuments, and important buildings within a community after violent conflict. This ritualized behavior has patterns recognizable in the archaeological record. Therefore, while Chase and Chase (2003) argue that extensive floor deposits found at sites such as Caracol are the result of sacking, we suggest that the sacking of elite structures by the ancient Maya followed a set of highly ritualized proscribed rules beyond just ran­dom destruction and looting and therefore should be classified as a type of special ritual. 

Most, if not all, scholars of the Maya would agree that this was a highly ritualized society. Like­wise, few, if any, Maya archaeologists would dis­pute the presence of dedicatory offe rings in architecture. As argued above, we believe that such offerings, when located in elite-civic contexts, rep­resent the remains of ancient acts to create and har­ness supernatural power by elite attempting to create and maintain positions of power. For instance, Brown (2003) has documented that the

introduction of subfloor caches or consecration offerings in public architecture during the Preclas­sic corresponded directly with the introduction of restricted monumental architecture such as the pyramidal form, associated with the emergence of elites. These data suggest that elites were pur­posefully manipulating rituals associated with the construction of public architecture to legitimize their elevated position in the community. 
We argue that Classic Maya rulers continued to legitimize their status, in part, by co-opting civic space from the community and commissioning the construction of monumental architecture that they symbolically imbued with supernatural power. Legitimization of power was often accomplished by linking one's self to the ancestors buried within housemounds and temple complexes, which may have been considered w'itz or sacred mountains (Schele and Freidel 1990; Stuart 1997). Structures such as Pakal's funerary monument, the Temple of the Inscriptions at Palenque, Chiapas, seem to have functioned as portals to the otherworld where the deified ancestors resided (Freidel et al. 1993; Schele 1986). Some buildings were even marked with breath imagery indicating that they were symboli­cally alive (see Houston and Taube 2000; Taube 2001 ). We argue that the placement of ancestors as well as dedication caches were acts of laying claim to power by various factions. Just as the burial of an important ancestor in the floor of a house may have functioned for a corporate group to lay claim to the household and possibly agricultural rights within the community (see McAnany 1995), the placement of a ruler within civic architecture may have been a particular faction's claim to rulership or even a community's claim to a larger socially pre­scribed territory. More succinctly, some architecture was imbued with cosmological power symbolizing and legitimizing claims in the material world. 
These same cosmological forces animating structures must have been considered by opposing groups when conflict occurred. For the Maya to go to great lengths to cosmologically charge their structures with the power of their deities and ances­tors, they must have given this power great respect. Places and objects could be dangerous, because they were vessels of supernatural power. To suc­cessfully defeat a center or ruling line and gain control of a center, this power may have had to be defused and replaced with one that would serve the needs to the usurping group. In other words, Maya sacking in elite-civic areas was not just random and wanton destruction. Rather, it was carefully executed so that the loser's ties to ancestral power and legitimization was dismantled by killing their living temples and houses. In other words, dese­cratory termination rituals were acts of undedica­tion or in Hubert's (1994: 13) terms, deconsecration. Rededication through renewed construction could then occur if the victors chose to lay claim to the defeated center and re-establish dynastic rule or if a local faction gained ascendance. 
Although the evidence for the desecration of architecture may be variable throughout the Maya region, many of the patterns appear to be similar. These rituals involved extensive damage to struc­tures and the deposition of several artifact types on floors and atop collapse. Floors were often cut open, possibly in attempts to locate and defile ancestors and dedicatory caches buried beneath them. Buri­als are sometimes found looted and burned with the remaining contents strewn about crypts, tombs, or floors. In short, structures were sometimes sub­jected to intensive burning, monuments were defaced, and several types of deposits, often resem­bling refuse, were laid down. These deposits also include ceramic vessels and other objects that were smashed on floors and can be found scattered throughout structures giving the floor deposits the look of domestic midden-scattering being an essential part of some Maya rituals. Recon­structable partial and whole vessels can often be refitted from relatively discrete areas, although in some cases part of a vessel may have been broken and deposited some distance from another part of the same vessel. Vessel assemblages from such deposits are sometimes characterized by a high per­centage of nonlocal types such as the slatewares dis­covered in destroyed buildings at Rio Azul (Adams 1990) and Colha (Mock 1994, 1998). When these activities occurred at the time of abandonment of the site or structure, they often remained as final deposits on floors rather than being cleaned up. 
In a previous publication (Pagliaro et al. 2003:79-80), two of us proposed a preliminary trait list for desecratory termination ritual deposits. This list included: 
1. 
intensive burning, 

2. 
intentional structural damage, 

3. 
deposition of white marl (possibly signifying

ritual burial [death?] or purification, depending on the context), 
4. 
breaking and scattering of pottery (scattering rituals being an important part of elite rituals includ­ing blood sacrifice), 

5. rapid deposition, 

6. 
dense concentrations of sherds with sharp breaks (due to the erosional protection of rapid breakage and deposition in a large deposit), and 

7. 
large quantities of elite artifacts (which might better be stated as ritual artifacts). 


While we still agree that the traits in this list gen­erally typify deposits we believe to be the result of termination rituals, it is only a rough qualitative pre­liminary assessment of what may generally char­acterize such deposits. More quantitative studies are currently being performed at places such as Yax­una (Ambrosino 2007), but these data were not available during the writing of this article. Further, it is important to mention that termination deposits may contain materials that were not intended to be part of the ritual (e.g., de facto refuse left on in the structures prior to the beginning of the ritual). Ino­mata's (1997; Inomata and Stiver 1998; Inomata and Triadan 2000) floor assemblages at Aguateca may reflect a mixing of termination or ceremonial 
' ' 
and de facto refuse. 
In the following section we discuss deposits from several sites across the Maya area. Comparing these deposits to the models of domestic as well as with the models of domestic refuse deposition presented in a previous section we illustrate that there are some obvious contextual differences. The data demonstrate that there are many patterns in final abandonment deposits on elite-civic structure floors that are unexpected given models of domestic refuse disposal. We suggest that some of these deposits are the result of termination rituals following violent conflict, often at a moment of structure or site aban­donment. We caution, however, that some of the deposits we present below may be the result of other types of activities. These deposits were selected not for their relation to possible warfare-related destruc­tion, but because the quality of research and report­ing of these deposits makes them excellent examples to compare them with the material patterning dis­cussed in the previous sections. Our discussion of these deposits is cursory and further research is clearly needed to understand the variability and complexity of such contexts. 
Archaeological Examples of Problematical Deposits 
We begin our discussion of archaeological exam­ples with a case that has been previously inter­preted within the logic of the squatter model. Although we believe these deposits to be the remains of termination rituals, in all fairness we should introduce them in terms of being "prob­lematical deposits," a term that can include a wide range of archaeological contexts reflecting differ­
· 
ent activities. All of the following deposits we describe come from elite-civic contexts and are associated with some form of architectural destruc­tion. In our opinion, the element of destruction associated with these contexts is a key part of mak­ing the interpretation of termination deposits. 
We begin with the site of Altun Ha, Belize. Sev­eral deposits found at this site were interpreted by Pendergast as the remains of domestic refuse formed after abandonment by squatters. Excava­tions revealed "midden-like" deposits on many of the floors of the A Group (Pendergast 1979, 1982, 1990). Pendergast ( 1979) identified a domestic use for the A Group during the period following initial abandonment. 1 This interpretation follows the idea proposed by Thompson (1954) that the collapse of Maya civilization in the southern lowlands was due, in part, to the moral decay of Maya society. 
Though probably the most sacrosanct part of A-1, the Building was clearly profaned by domestic use after its abandonment, resem­bling in this respect the Building ofA-3. In both A-1 and A-3, it appears that one or more front rooms (inA-1, the two with exterior doorways) were used for residence, while the remainder served as repositories for garbage [Pendergast 
1979:94]. 
No clearer indication could be found of the shift in Al tun Ha life which came with the fall of the Classic, as what had been a sacred area devoted to worship of a deity came to be a smoke-blackened, garbage strewn, decaying home [Pendergast 1979:161]. 
We believe that Pendergast (1979, 1990, 1992) was correct in his assessment of the profaned nature of these structures, but suggest an alternative hypothesis that they may have been desecrated at the time of abandonment by calculated ritual acts

and not afterwards by sacrilegious squatters who altered refuse disposal practices prior to Altun Ha's final abandonment "as part of the general disinte­gration of Classic life" (Pendergast 1990: 120). Due to the thorough and careful nature of the excava­tions at Altun Ha and the detailed information pub­lished by Pendergast, a re-examination of these deposits is possible. In the following discussion we will concentrate on three very different deposits reported from Structures A-1 and A-8. 
Str. A-1 is interpreted as a principle temple of the A Group (Pendergast 1979:94-95). It has a pyramidal structure with a series of vaulted rooms on its summit. In two of the superstructure rooms Pendergast found what he interpreted to be a mid­den deposited by squatters. The deposits consisted of 41 1 small, eroded sherds, a tip of a pendant or charmstone, a limestone bark beater, and a leaf shaped projectile point. On average the deposits were 12 cm thick and do not appear to resemble de facto refuse or provisional discard. Although Pen­dergast ( 1979:94) identified the deposits to be mid­den, he suggested that the pendant, bark beater, and projectile point were unusual and "not common in temple post-abandonment middens at Altun Ha, and their presence in Room 2 may be the result of intentional deposition rather than of loss through carelessness." We agree with Pendergast and sug­gest that the projectile point may in fact indicate hostile activities. The data (Pendergast 1979:94) indicate that in "Room 2, most of the vault toppled into the chamber, with the east face falling first, more or less in a block, followed by the west face." This suggests a rapid collapse that occurred as one event. The ceramic material from the floor deposits in Rooms 2 and 4 were heavily eroded and do indeed appear to be trash of some sort. A case could be made that the material was domestic refuse that was transposed from some other context, and in fact, there is some evidence from other types of con­texts that the Maya regarded some trash as sym­bolically charged (Hutson and Stanton 2007). The fact that the floor deposits occur in only two rooms suggests that it is possible that "squatters" may have been living in the other rooms. What is curi­ous, however, is the eroded nature of the deposit that suggests that it may have been exposed to the elements for some time rather than protected within the confines of vaulted architecture. Further, the proposed squatters were placing trash in an enclosed area that could not air out, just meters from where they may have been living. We suggest an alternative to this interpretation-that these deposits were refuse brought in to the structure and employed to end the use of, or perhaps defile, the inner sanctum of the temple. Similar processes of midden transposal to architectural contexts at the time of abandonment have been described else­where in the Maya lowlands (e.g., Clayton et al. 2005; Driver and Mc Williams 1995) and from the American Southwest (e.g., Montgomery 1993). While other explanations are certainly possible, the contexts do not appear to suggest squatter activity. 
A second deposit was encountered in the debris atop Str. A-1. This deposit consisted of a large num­ber of sherds (1,556) that contained numerous Ter­minal Classic and Postclassic basins suggesting a transitional date between two local ceramic tradi­tions or perhaps an introduction of Postclassic ceramics from an external source at a time when Terminal Classic material was falling into disuse. Pendergast ( 1979) uses these data to argue that the top of the temple continued to be used as a refuse dump after the building had collapsed. Addition­ally, four to five individuals were "buried" in this debris, all of which were found in fragmentary and "scattered" form. Only one of the burials was found in situ and was located within Room 2. Although fragmentary, this burial was thought to be an adult male individual. The materials in the collapse debris are perhaps the most puzzling. If "squatters" con­tinued to live at Altun Ha after the collapse of the superstructure of A-1, why would they have trans­ported midden up a tall building that could not have served well as a residence? This behavior certainly goes against the principle of economy of effort, sug­gesting that motives other than simple refuse dis­posal were at work. Further, the presence of fragmented and scattered human bone suggests that the materials, at least in the debris, may be cere­monial trash rather than domestic midden. 
Complementing the evidence from Altun Ha Str. A-1, data resembling similar deposits have been reported from Str. A-1 1 atXunantunich, Belize. Str. A-11 is part of the Plaza A-III complex and is sug­gested by Yaeger (2005, 2006) and Mac Kie ( 1985) to be the residence and court of the Xunantunich rulers during the Late Classic. MacKie ( 1985: 31-50) suggests that the "ruined" state of Str. A-11 in conjunction with a lack of sediment buildup

on the floors may indicate that the building was 
destroyed rapidly by either an earthquake or human 
agents. He found it implausible, however, that the 
17 or more whole vessels recovered on the floors 
of the structure could have been so scattered across 
the rooms if the vault stones had caused the ves­
sels to break. After analyzing the sherd distribution, 
he stated that "the extensive scattering of sherds of 
individual vessels inside the building is very 
strange" (MacKie 1985:47). Although MacKie 
(1985) suggested a possible earthquake for this 
destruction, more recent excavations on Str. A-1 1 
clearly show intentional dismantling of all the lower rooms of the building. Yaeger (2005, 2006) found evidence that the corbel vaults and wall facings in four lower rooms were intentionally pulled down. Recent excavations also revealed that several large vessels were broken in the central and eastern rooms and that the sherds were scattered across the floor, similar to the deposit MacKie had encoun­tered in the upper rooms of the building. The remains of a young adult individual were encoun­tered in the far eastern lower room of Str. A-11 and may be the remains of a sacrificial victim. Inter­estingly, the deposits on the floors were sealed with white marl and limestone rocks that essentially filled in the rooms. An unusual offering was placed on top of the marl layer in one of the lower rooms and consisted of several retouched chert flakes and a single red-slipped bowl of a type that is rarely found at Xunantunich (Yaeger 2006). The pur­poseful architectural destruction, scattering of bro­ken vessels, and sealing of the rooms with white marl in conjunction with the presence of "foreign" ceramic vessels may suggest some form of violent action against the royal residence and court of Xunantunich (Jason Yaeger, personal communica­tion 2007). This may be the same type of behavior observed for Str. A-1 at Altun Ha. 
Returning to Altun Ha, located immediately to the south of Str. A-1 Pendergast (1979: 127) found an "extensive mass of grey, ashy soil" containing charcoal on the east side of Str. A-8. This deposit was found to be 1.8 m thick where it abutted the platform face of the structure. Included within the deposit was a large amount of fauna! material (2,982 specimens), 405 small artifacts, 84,334 sherds (lots of polychromes; common forms were bowls, cylindrical vases, and dish-plates suggest­ing a focus on food consumption rather than cook­ing or storage), 41 partial or nearly complete ves­
sels, 100 vessel sections, 43 bone artifacts, and 45 
shell artifacts. The deposit certainly has the look of 
a massive event, or a series of closely spaced events, 
including a focus on food consumption. At the north 
end of the deposit, the refuse overlay the lower 
steps (Stair 8) of the structure indicating that the 
people responsible for its deposition were not con­
cerned that the refuse could hinder passage around 
and up the structure. This context, taken in con-. junction with a fairly similar deposit found inside '. the construction fill of Str. A-8-1 st(the two deposits were not widely separated in time), lead Pender­gast to again interpret the data as a breakdown in refuse cleaning after rulership had ended at Altun Ha. 
The problem we see here is not that the deposit is not some form of refuse, but that it appears more likely that the refuse was part of an abandonment episode rather than a post-abandonment re-use episode. First, there is no evidence to suggest that the deposit was the result of an extended deposi­tional process. Second, the ceramic forms and fau­na! materials indicate a special type of midden related to food consumption. We might speculate that what we are looking at is the result of a feast undertaken at the time of abandonment or possibly the debris of feasting events intentionally dumped on the architecture as part of an abandonment rit­ual. Yet addressing this hypothesis would require a detailed re-analysis of the materials. Clayton et al. (2005) document a similar deposit at the site of Blue Creek where feasting debris was transposed to and dumped upon a ceremonial building at the time of abandonment. What is most curious about the Altun Ha deposit is that the refuse effectively hindered access to both Str. A-1 and Str. A-8. If "squatters" were living in and around these two structures, their domestic refuse patterns were con­siderably different than other what has been docu­mented above. The superstructure data from A-8 suggests that the structure was razed and the floor exhibited extensive damage. Although the exact dating of this destruction is not clear, we suggest that there may have been a correlation between the destruction and the refuse accumulation that fits the patterns of other termination ritual events docu­mented within the Maya lowlands. 
Turning to Copan, two elite residential com­pounds exhibit this same patterning. The IOL-33

Complex at the south edge of the acropolis was cov­ered with "domestic refuse" during the Terminal Classic just prior to the cessation of occupation. We suggest that this "refuse" is the result of termina­tion rituals. Not only do these deposits occur in the remains of collapsed elite structures at Copan, but they also are directly associated with intensive burn­ing. In the words of Andrews and Fash (1992): 
It might be argued that our evidence for the destruction of buildings at the core of Copan is limited to four buildings and that fires in a few buildings could have come about in more natural and less meaningful ways. But it must be remembered that the four buildings men­tioned are among the few vaulted structures of importance excavated in recent years. Such evidence was most likely overlooked in the past, and most of the great buildings in central Copan were cleared long ago, so that we will probably not find large numbers of structures with clear traces of destruction by burning. In considering the case for violent terminal events, we should recall the small round altars from Structures lOL-29 and IOL-43. Both commemorate 11 Ahau 18 Mac (790) and both were neatly and identically snapped in half. The one from lOL-29 was vandalized just before the building collapsed, and the one from 1 OL-43 may have been broken as part of the same event. The fragmentary rectangular altar excavated in 1990 from the building collapse behind IOL-32 (CPN I 9222), probably a com­panion piece sitting next to Altar Fon the bench of the center room, was badly shattered, and most of it was not found. Intentional vandal­ism preceding the destruction of lOL-32 seems indicated [Andrews and Fash 1992:86]. 
Str. 9N-82, or the House of the Bacabs, is another example of an elite residential structure from Copan that exhibits non-accidental burning (Webster 1989). In short, the stratigraphy of this structure from floor level upwards consists of a layer of cultural debris, or "refuse," a flexed indi­vidual, and collapse. It is possible that the individ­ual represents a sacrificial victim who was either sacrificed and placed in the room or was killed when the vault collapsed. In another building in the same complex, Str. 9N-81, pieces of charcoal and burned daub were recovered from atop the floor indicating that the structure had been burned. A smashed olla and effigy incensario were also recov­ered along with stone replica ballgame gear. Some of this ballgame paraphernalia was broken. Although the "cultural debris" is not extensively described, these excavations seem to fit the pattern of destruction associated with termination rituals. 
While the exact nature of the activity resulting in these deposits is open to interpretation, they do not appear to resemble domestic middens. Although we suggest that termination rituals may be a possibility, such deposits should be considered problematical. There are many different interpre­tations that can be forwarded for these types of floor deposits. Further research into the context and artifact composition of such deposits may clarify what types of behaviors were responsible for their depositions. Using examples from the literature, we can only point out that the patterning on these floors does not correlate with what we might expect for domestic middens. The level of detail in the pub­lished data is often not fine enough to actually restudy the deposits in their entirety. We have tried to rectify our lack of understanding of these deposits by examining problematical contexts in our own work, but have found that the complexity and ambiguity hinders our comprehension of depo­sitional behaviors in many cases. 
For example, one of us has previously reported on termination deposits at the site of Blackman Eddy, Belize (Brown 2003; Brown and Garber 2003). The Blackman Eddy case is intriguing due to the fact that it dates to a very early period (Mid­dle Formative, ca. 600 B.C.) and suggests that war­fare related ritual destruction has a long history in the Maya lowlands. Evidence associated with the destruction of Str. BI -4th includes architectural dis­mantling and burning of a mask facade, parts of the summit surface, and basal platform. The upper por­tion and backing to the mask facade had even been dismantled and pulled away from the platform. Yet the summit of the platform did not have a large amount of debris on the surface, and appears to have been swept clean prior to the construction of the overlying architectural phase. An unusual deposit, however, was found abutting the back retaining wall of the platform consisting of a dense cluster of smashed ceramic material and carbon. The ceramic material was in secondary context suggesting that it was broken on the summit surface and deliber-

ately swept off the back edge. We believe that the "ceremonial trash" of a termination ritual had been dumped in this secondary context, creating inter­pretational problems for the deposit. The remains of the desecration were for the most part cleaned up and removed prior to the construction of a new architectural phase (although still abutting the struc­ture). We bring up this context to illustrate that some of the types of interpretational problems arising from the study of"trash" in elite-civic contexts. We believe this to be the remains of a desecratory ter­mination ritual, but can easily see how the secondary nature of the deposit could fit more easily into the patterns of refuse cleaning illustrated in the eth­noarchaeological studies. 
Discussion 
The confusion as to what constitutes normal ancient Maya refuse as opposed to remains of termination rituals has been a result of their seemingly similar material patterning. On closer examination, many terminal deposits located on elite-civic structure floors appear to be found in contexts that suggest behavior other than domestic refuse disposal by sacrilegious squatters. These deposits are often associated with architectural destruction, intensive burning, and the deposition oflayers of white marl. 
The primary goal of this article is to point out that there are some basic patterns regarding termi­nal deposits in elite-civic floor contexts to be fur" ther explored. The squatter model does not explain the presence of intensive burning, 2 architectural destruction, and high levels of valuable and often broken objects, as well as the occasional presence of human bone possibly from burial disturbance and/or sacrificial victims. Although other post­abandonment activity may be responsible for some of the patterns identified as termination rituals or squatter activity, we believe that a large proportion of these deposits are the result of rituals of struc­ture termination conducted during abandonment activity, often after violent conflict. While more archaeologists are accepting termination rituals as legitimate ways of interpreting data, an increased focus on formation processes is needed to really begin to understand the nature and complexity of these deposits. The formation of desecratory ter­mination deposits as the result of rituals associated with conflict is one testable hypothesis that can be 
pursued when confronted with deposits similar to those we have outlined here. Other possibilities such as the ceremonial deposition of refuse in archi­tectural contexts at the time of abandonment should be further investigated. Even the squatter model could be further pursued. Our point is that many of the "domestic middens" found in elite contexts and attributed to "squatters" may be the result of other activities. It is necessary to closely analyze the con­texts and compositions of such deposits to under­stand depositional behavior.

Notes 
I. The concept of re-use is probably more accurate (Stanton and Magnoni 2008). The fact that some sort of activ­ity is going on, in this case domestic residence in the front two rooms of Str. A-1 and refuse disposal in two back rooms, suggests re-use rather than abandonment. It is difficult for us to imagine how structures where people reside are aban­doned. The structure may have changed function or residents, but it is still being used. Further, although there is a tendency to perceive structures used exclusively as trash dumps as

abandoned, in some sense they have only changed function. Although we too prefer the interpretation of such structures as abandoned, we also wish to draw attention to this point. 
2. Interestingly intensive burning is noted for the aban­donment of structures in other societies as well (Lightfoot 1993: 168-169; Montgomery 1993:161; Stevanovic 1997). In the American Southwest, the burning and filling of structures with ceremonial trash has been correlated with ritual aban­donment practices (Lightfoot 1993:168-169; Montgomery 1993: 161).

By Dean Arnold 
A unique ethno-archaeological study tracing social changes among potters in Ticul, Mexico and changes in the production and distribution of their pottery between 1965 and 1997. Arnold bridges the gap between archaeology and ethnography, using his analysis of contemporary ceramic production and distribution to generate new theoretical explanations for archaeologists working with pottery from antiquity.
