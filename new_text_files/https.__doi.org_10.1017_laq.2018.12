Kim Richter delineates a rich context for the fabri­cation and circulation of luxury objects in Postclassic Mesoamerica. She draws on extensive post-conquest records, and especially the Codex Mendoza, to paint a rich picture of tributary sources, material movements, and fabrication locations for the panoply of luxury items that .owed into the imperial Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan. These rich luxury object ensem­bles sated the elite’s desire for shimmering brilliant optical effects that were so central to indigenous aesthetics. 
Of the explorations of gold and its relation to other luxury goods, the essay by Leonardo López Luján and José Ruvalcaba Sil on Mexica gold is particularly illuminating in its wealth of data and its careful delineation of archaeological context. The authors argue persuasively that the amount of gold controlled by the Mexica (Aztec) was relatively small, especially when compared with the Andean tradition, and that goldwork was intimately embedded in the larger luxury object system focused more on jade and feathers. Through a careful comparative analysis of the relative amounts of additional metal (copper and silver) contained in the gold found in the Templo Mayor and elsewhere in Mesoamerica, the authors are able to hypothesize a heretofore unknown Basin of Mexico school of metalworking. As in Filloy Nadal’s work on Mesoamerican jade, and Maldonado’s scene-setting chapter on metallurgical techniques, among others, this chapter bene.ts from long-term, careful archaeological documentation and advanced technical analysis of these objects, rendering possible historical and cultural insights that would be very dif.cult to produce without such documentation. 
In the .nal narrative chapter, Julia McHugh describes the globalization of trade in luxury goods beginning in the sixteenth century, where the new religion and luxury trade intertwined, making the display of gold and silver central to colonial luxury. A telling surprise is the inclusion of a sixteenth-century feather painting of Christian subject matter, proving the central importance of the show’s thesis: the history of elite materials and goods may be productively examined over the longue durée and even across what seem like impermeable cultural and historical boundaries.

The island of Hispaniola was the setting for the .rst European expansion into the New World, beginning with the “discovery” of new lands and peoples in the late .fteenth century by Spanish interests. It is unknown how many discrete cultures there were in the Caribbean at the time of contact. Even some terms in use today (Taíno for the Greater Antilles; Carib for the Lesser Antilles) are controversial and proba­bly simplistic references for a much more complex cultural situation. Taíno begantobeusedinthe late nineteenth century and was not used by Spaniards. Carib indicated people of the Lesser Antilles who .ercely resisted Spanish rule and raids and were said to be cannibals. The level of cultural development is also debated: for some, the indigenous groups were transitional, between tribal and chie.y societies; for others, they were hierarchical chiefdoms. The contested precontact population of Hispaniola has been estimated at various levels, from hundreds of thousands to several million. What is clear, however, is that a precipitous decline in indigenous populations began in the late .fteenth century, accelerating in the early sixteenth century. 
Surviving Spanish Conquest is principally an eth­nohistorical work that details the beginnings of Span­ish hegemony, focusing on the islands of Hispaniola and Puerto Rico during the period between 1492 and 1550. It .lls an important niche, providing a rare look into the treatment of native peoples during the earliest period of settlement and establishment of mercantile enterprises. Karen Anderson-Córdova begins with a discussion of the ways anthropologists have studied culture contact situations: acculturation, transcultura­tion, ethnogenesis, creolization, and cultural transfor­mation. She reviews acculturation most extensively, given the lengthy history of its use in anthropology, but chooses cultural transformation as the approach with which she is most comfortable. She provides a history of the islands, from discovery through exploration, to the establishment of settlements. She details the early forced movement of native peoples as well as rebellions that sought to drive out the Spaniards. 
The wealth and prosperity of Spanish colonists was dependent on native labor. Mining was the initial focus, an enterprise that required substantial native labor to conduct. When there were no more Indians to exploit, enslaved Africans took their place. Slavery became the dominant form of labor in the latter half of

the sixteenth century. At the outset, several approaches to managing the conquered native population were institutionalized: encomienda, repartimiento,and con­gregación.An encomienda was a grant of land to a Spaniard, which included the resident native people. Ideally, the encomendero was obligated to provide for the welfare of the indigenous population on his grant, assuring a civilizing process in exchange for their labor. The repartimientowas a labor levy, usually managed through the native chiefs, which required a set period of service. The demora, or period of required labor, might be ful.lled locally or at a distance from the individual’s home settlement. Congregación involved movement of indigenous people to areas nearer Spanish interests, both residential and commer­cial. Congregación often resulted in the destruction of native settlements and the creation of “vacant lands” thereafter granted to Spaniards. 
And what of the civilizing process? Native peoples tended to ful.ll their demoras, return to their villages, and resume indigenous lifeways and ceremonials. The resumption of practices, which to Spaniards were idolatrous, indicated that Christianizing efforts made no lasting impression on the natives of Hispaniola. This observation convinced Spaniards that natives were not capable of achieving civilized life and justi.ed their exploitation in commercial enterprises as conquered peoples. Population decline from mal­treatment began soon after contact in the late .fteenth century. Spaniards were aware of the declining pop­ulation on Hispaniola, and a vigorous slave trade for replacements was underway. In 1511, the Dominican Antonio de Montesinos preached a sermon that cas­tigated Spaniards as sinners for the deaths of native peoples. The Laws of Burgos were promulgated a year later as a result of Crown concerns with these accusations. These laws were intended to alleviate maltreatment of native peoples, but they legalized many of the practices responsible for native deaths. Other such laws would follow, but they were generally ignored by colonial government functionaries. For native peoples, there was no effective relief from maltreatment. 
Two primary sources, the Repartimiento of 1514 and the Hieronymite Interrogatory of 1517, are used to gain insights relevant to the treatment of indigenous peoples. By the time these documents were written, however, commercial exploitation of Hispaniola was well underway, and local populations were already severely diminished. It is clear that these documents were written to justify the status quo: encomienda grants, forced labor of native peoples, movement to work sites from their settlements, and intra-island and extra-island relocation of native peoples. 
Anderson-Córdova stresses the implications of her .ndings for archaeologists. The movement of people within the islands of Hispaniola and Puerto Rico and inter-island slave raiding in the islands of the Lesser Antilles are signi.cant matters for archaeologists. Postcontact-period archaeology in the Caribbean is not yet well developed, but there are insights of signi.cance. It is clear that native lifeways persisted in some areas, but examples are few. More important is the probability of cultural mixing; that material remains in archaeological sites represent blended or new cultures arising from postconquest conditions. 
The term holocaust was appropriated in the mid-twentieth century to encompass the depredations against the Jews of Europe and other people who did not conform to measures of racial purity required by the German National Socialist state. Anderson-Córdova shows us that holocaust is a term that also should be applied to the depredations that ended the lives and cultures of native peoples of the New World. For Native Americans, this holocaust began in the Caribbean on the island of Hispaniola. The social, commercial, religious, and governmental poli­cies developed so early in the contact period on Hispaniola and Puerto Rico would be imported and applied widely in many other colonial areas of the Americas. For native peoples, the result would be the same.

Challenging the orthodoxy of a uni.ed ethnic identity called “The Maya,” this book reckons with the mean­ing of material remains, language and hieroglyphs, oral history, ethnography, and contemporary cultural critique. Ambitious in temporal scope, some chapters delve deeply into the past while others contemplate the impact of constructs about the past on the present. In a manner that is characteristic of Maya studies, the book is remarkably inter-disciplinary and includes eleven chapters written by ethnographers, historians, archaeologists, linguists, epigraphers, and a bioar­chaeologist. The diversity of critical perspectives on identity and ethnicity creates a critical mass of schol­arship that hopefully will topple the apocryphal notion
