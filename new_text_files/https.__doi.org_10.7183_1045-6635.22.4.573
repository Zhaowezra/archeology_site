DIET AND RANK IN A CARIBBEAN MARITIME SOCIETY 
John G. Crock and Nanny Carder 
The investigation of social inequality in the Caribbean mainly has focused on the larger islands of the Greater Antilles where ethnohistoric records and monumental architecture form the basis for analysis of precolumbian complex societies. This paper presents evidence for status differentiation in the Lesser Antilles on the small island of Anguilla within a deposit at the Sandy Hill site and evuluates associated archaeofaunafor evidence of rank-based differences 
in food consumption. When compared with three other sites. the higher density of status-related artifacts and higher densities of food remains at the Sandy Hill site are interpreted as the result of feasting. No evidence for inequality is observed in patterns of food con­sumption.

his paper explores the association between Tsocial rank and diet in a maritime society in the northern Lesser Antilles. Standardized excavations at several large, contemporaneous, Late Ceramic Age (ca. A .D. 900-1500) village sites on the small island of Anguilla (Figure I) provide an opportunity to investigate the potential associ­ation between material culture indicative of status and food remains. An uneven distribution of pres­tige goods between sites suggests the presence of a ranked society in Anguilla and the neighboring small islands during the centuries prior to European contact (Crock 2000; Crock and Petersen 2004; Haviser 1991). This paper investigates social dif­ferentiation in this region at the site level, first by ; identifying an elite deposit using relative propor­tions of status objects, then by evaluating the asso­ciated food remains for evidence that may reflect 
hierarchical patterns in food consumption. 
Archaeological investigation of elite food con­
sumption and control of food production depends on the identification of residential and ritual con­texts associated with high-ranking social groups. For this reason, the zooarchaeology of elite foods is often restricted to obvious examples of social stratification and well-defined boundaries between elite and non-elite space (e.g., Bray 2003; Crabtree 1990; deFrance 2009; Jackson and Scott 2003; Kelly 2001; Knight 2004). In the Pacific Islands, ample archaeological, ethnohistoric, and ethno­graphic evidence attest to elite residences, activity areas, and differential access of elites to "luxury" foods , notably fish, among the complex chiefdoms of, for instance, Hawaii (e.g., Kirch 2001; Kirch and O'Day 2003). In less stratified Polynesian chiefdoms, such as in Tikopia, the identification of elite-controlled activities such as feasts is more elusive archaeologically, given that "feasting has little to distinguish it qualitatively from ordinary eating" (Kirch 2001: 180). Clear indications ofrank distinctions among such less stratified populations are noted ethnographically, however (Jones 2009;

Kirch 2001:172). Likewise, in the Caribbean Islands, ethnohistoric accounts document large polities where food played a significant role in elite hospitality, yet archaeological examples that elu­cidate the relationship between social ranking and food are rare, with few exceptions (e.g., Deagan 2004; deFrance 2010). 
Elite Contexts in the Caribbean 
The ethnohistoric record of the Caribbean is rich with detail of status differentiation within and between communities living in the Greater Antilles and Virgin Islands at the time of European contact (e.g.,Dunn and Kelley 1989; Las Casas 1951; Pane 1999). Spanish chronicles provide evidence that Amerindian communities, including the Tafno, were led by both male and female chiefs ( caciques) from elite lineages that controlled the distribution and display of prestige goods (e.g., Loven 1935; Moscoso 1981; Rouse 1992; Wilson 1990). These items included raw materials such as cotton, finely made wooden stools and benches (duhos), gold (guanine), shell masks (guaiz as), and the more powerful cemi idols in the form of textile dolls, wooden sculptures, and three-pointed stones (Helms 1987; Oliver 2009; Pane 1999). Contact period documents also illustrate the ability of chiefs to mobilize labor for public activities, agriculture and fishing (e.g., Las Casas 1951 , 11:144-145, 1958, IV:242; Sauer 1969:88-90; Wilson 1990 :90-97). 
Unfortunately, documentary accounts make lit­tle direct mention of the people living in the small islands of the eastern Caribbean , other than pass­ing references to kinship connections between the Lesser and Greater Antilles (e.g., Sued Badillo 1995). As a result, questions addressing the scale of complexity and the socio-political relationship between the two regions rely mainly on archaeo­logical data. 
Material culture arguably related to elite status and elite activities is present at sites in the north­ern Lesser Antilles, including decorated ceramics, the above-mentioned objects such as idols and ornaments, and inlays once used to adorn wooden furniture. These artifacts, stylistically similar to those found at Late Ceramic Age sites in the Greater Antilles and analogous to objects referenced in Spanish chronicles, document the presence of a culturally related hierarchical society in the small islands in the centuries prior to European contact

(Crock 2000; Crock and Petersen 2004; Hoogland and Hofman 1994, 1999). Rouse (1992) classifies the people in the eastern Caribbean at the time of Columbus as "Eastern" Tafno and those in the Greater Antilles as ''Classic" Tafno. While a cul­tural linkage is clear archaeologically, the degree to which societies in the northern Lesser Antilles were related to those in the Greater Antilles and whether or not they were comparable in terms of level of complexity remain open questions (e.g., Curet 2003; Oliver 2009:25). 
Even with the clues provided by ethnohistory, the archaeological identification of elite contexts in the Caribbean is challenging due to the perishable nature of many materials used by Amerindians to communicate social status and the difficulty in matching midden residues or other deposits to elite households or activities presided over by elites. Exceptions include civic-ceremonial ball court sites argued to be emblematic of elite power and stages for elite-controlled activities (Alegria 1983; Curet and Stringer2009; Oliver 1998,2005)andtheCon­tact era Tafno village of En Bas Saline in Haiti, thought to be the main town within the chiefdom of Guacanagarf, and the location of the first Spanish settlement (Deagan 2004). These contexts provide rare opportunities to study the presence, or absence, of patterns of elite food consumption. For example, at En Bas Saline, notable differences are apparent in both the distribution of ornaments and ritual items and correlated patterns of food consumption (Dea­gan 2004). Deagan (2004:616--618) found that elites consumed more mammals and larger, less bony, fish compared to non-elites. In contrast, at the site ofTibes, a ball court complex in Puerto Rico, little appears to differentiate animal use across the site or through time (deFrance 2010). 
Environmental Setting 
Terrestrial and marine resources are highly variable within and between Caribbean islands. Local envi­ronments, whether island-or site-specific, are par­ticularly influential in structuring subsistence practices (Wing and Reitz 1982). The island of Anguilla is a small, flat limestone island of approx­imately 91 km2 and a maximum elevation of 65 m. Local environments on Anguilla differ in physical and biotic features, variability in density and dis­tribution of food resources, and ease of access to food resources. Anguilla is part of the Anguillan Bank, one of the most extensive and productive reef systems in the Caribbean, ranging from 20 to 40 m deep and covering 4,660 km2 (Jackson 1981). 
Anguilla's coastline consists of coral sand beaches, low rock outcrops, and limestone cliffs. Extensive inshore patch and fringe reefs and a broad barrier reef are located along the island's north­western coast, and substantial shallow fringe reefs occur along the northeastern and southern coasts. A small area in the north has rocky cliffs with a rocky-bottom shore. There is no surface fresh water on the island although there are underground springs, aquifers, and natural subsurface limestone cisterns. Land suitable for farming is limited by the island's rocky limestone substrate, low elevation, and low rainfall. Approximately 13 percent of Anguilla is cultivable today. Although the poten­tial for cultivation may have been greater in the past prior to extensive deforestation and soil erosion, arable land has always been limited by shallow soils with an underlying and/or exposed limestone pavement. 
Subsistence remains from sites in Anguilla reveal an intense maritime adaptation with archae­ofaunal assemblages comprised of greater than 95 percent fishes (Carder and Crock 2007), and high densities of invertebrates (Clark and Crock 2011). High volumes of interisland trade and exchange represented by high proportions of non-local stone and ceramic raw materials support the strong mar­itime focus (Crock et al. 2008; Crock and Petersen 2004; Knippenberg 2006). 
Archaeological Sites Studied 
The site samples studied were collected during 18 months of fieldwork from 1996 to 1997 (Crock 2000). Systematic excavations undertaken at four contemporaneous Late Ceramic Age habitation sites in Anguilla-Sandy Hill, Sandy Ground, Barnes Bay and Shoal Bay East-produced large samples of artifacts and well preserved faunal assemblages (Figure 2). A total of 13 calibrated (two sigma) 14C dates from the deposits studied pro­vide a maximum age range of A.D. 775-1410. A tighter range of A.D. 900-1200 is suggested based on actual date intercepts and temporal assessments of ceramic style. At all four sites, historic cultiva­tion, modem construction, and natural erosion of

the shoreline have negatively impacted overall site integrity. Despite these challenges, commonplace in the Lesser Antilles, we have obtained meaning­ful data to compare sites and intra-site patterning. 
A similar testing program was undertaken at each site, consisting of shovel testing at 25 m and 50 m intervals and excavation of larger units ( 1.0 x 2.0, 1.0 x 3.0,and 2.0 x 2.0 m units) in core (mid­den) areas of each site . In each case, larger test units were placed in areas of high artifact density to address hypotheses related to the development of social complexity on the island and within the northern Lesser Antilles (Crock 2000; Crock and Petersen 2004). At all sites, individual 1.0 m x 1.0 m units were excavated in arbitrary 10 cm levels within natural strata. Each unit level was separated into four 50 cm x 50 cm quadrants. Fill from three quadrants of each excavated unit was screened through 6.4 mm (-inch) mesh, and one quadrant was screened through 3.2 mm (-inch) mesh. For the analysis of the material culture and food remains discussed below, we combined samples from the two mesh sizes for each 10 cm level. Samples finer than 3.2 mm mesh were not collected. In all cases, the uppermost strata were not included in the analy­
sis due to cultivation and landscaping disturbance. 
The archaeological assemblages from the frmr sites offer an opportunity to present evidence of an elite deposit and evaluate potential rank-based dif­ferences in food consumption during a portion of the Late Ceramic Age, ca. AD. 900-1200. This period represents the height of Amerindian occu­pation of the island and the period during which complexity developed in the northern Lesser Antilles (Crock and Petersen 2004; Haviser 1991). 
The Sandy Hill site is located in the east-cen­tral portion of Anguilla's south coast, on the west­ern side of the bay (see Figure 2). Sandy Hill Bay is shallow with patches of reef close to the shore­line. The archaeological site lies on the southeast side of Sandy Hill, the highest point on the south coast of the island (30 m amsl). The site extends inland from an elevation of about 2 m amsl , at its eastern edge, 20 m amsl. at the western margin. Based on positive test pits (n 28) and surface arti­

facts, the original site size is estimated to be 4.0 ha (Crock and Petersen 1999). Diagnostic ceramics and 14C dates indicate that the Sandy Hill site was a large village occupied from as early as A .D. 900 and continuously to A.O. 1200-1500 (Crock

2000:96-103).A 1.0 m x 2.0 m test unit excavated in the central portion of the site generated the arti­fact and zooarchaeological assemblages discussed below. Three calibrated dates for the specific mid­den deposits studied (20-50 cm below ground suface [bgs]; arbitrary levels 39-43), have an over­lapping range between calA.D. 980 andA.D.1390 (Crock 2000:101-102) (calibrated at 2cr with the program CALIB 5 .0 .I [Stuiver and Reimer 1993] .) . 
The Sandy Ground site is on the west-central portion of Anguilla's northern coast (see Figure 2). The site is adjacent to Road Bay, the only natural deep harbor on Anguilla. The site and modern vil­lage lie about 2-3 m ams!. on a thin strip of barrier beach separating Road Bay from a large salt pond. The salt pond covers about 40 ha, and small areas of mangrove swamp, likely more extensive at the time of Amerindian occupation, exist along its inland margins. Sandy Island and Prickly Pear Island, part of the Seal Bay barrier reef system par­allel to the coast, are located approximately 3-7 km offshore. The near shore patch and fringe reefs are characterized by extensive areas of hard and soft corals, ledges, cliffs, and caverns. Based on test pits (n 21) and the extent of artifacts on the surface 
= 
of the site, Crock and Petersen (1999) estimate the original site covered at least 7 .5 ha. The Sandy Ground site was a large village occupied as early as A.D. 350, and continuously from A.D. 650 throughA.D. 1200andpotentiallyuntilA.D. 1500, making it one of the first and longest occupied sites on the island (Crock 2000:59-68). Crock and Petersen excavated a series of larger test units in the core of the site; a 1.0 m x 3 .0 m unit generated the artifactual and zooarchaeological assemblages discussed in this article. One date for the deeper of the two specific Late Ceramic Age midden levels studied (30-40 cm bgs; arbitrary level 16), has a range of calA.D. 775-1015 (Crock 2000:66) (cal­ibrated at 2cr with the program CALIB 5.0.l [Stu­iver and Reimer 1993].). 
The Barnes Bay site is located approximately 6 km west of Sandy Ground (see Figure 2). The site lies above the shoreline at the top of a small slope approximately 3-6 m ams!. The coastline at Barnes Bay forms a small rocky promontory, open to the north, with limited near-shore reef protection. The Seal Bay barrier reef is located 5 to 10 km offshore. Close to shore, patch and reef banks are structurally complex with extensive areas of soft and hard corals, 
steep reef edges, and boulder-strewn sandy bot­toms. A large salt pond, areas of mangrove, and a freshwater spring are located within one kilometer of the site. Based on test pits (n = 40) and the extent of artifacts visible on the surface, Crock and Petersen (1999) estimate the original covered at least 2.3 ha, although this is probably an underesti­mate as beach erosion has impacted the northwest­ern portion of the site. Analysis of ceramics and calibrated radiocarbon dating indicate Barnes Bay was a large village site occupied as early as A.D. 775 through at least A.D. 1200-1400 (Crock 2000:129-133). Crock excavated two 2.0 m x 2.0 m test units in the central portion of the site where the highest artifact densities were recorded. One of these two units generated the artifact and zooar­chaeological assemblages discussed. Four cali­brated dates (two on charcoal and two on shell) for the three levels studied (30-55 cm bgs; arbitrary lev­els 18, 19, and 20) have overlapping ranges between cal A.D. 775 and 1320 (calibrated at 2cr with the program CALIB 5 .0 .1 [Stui verand Reimer 1993] . ) . 
The Shoal Bay East site is a large habitation site located on the eastern end of Anguilla's north coast, approximately 15 km northeast of Barnes Bay (see Figure 2). The Shoal Bay East site is located on a broad flat area adjacent to the modern beach at an elevation of approximately 1-2 m ams!. Like the Barnes Bay site, beach erosion has affected Shoal Bay East and therefore, the original site may have been larger. The marine environment adjacent to the Shoal Bay East site differs from the Barnes Bay and Sandy Ground sites in that an extensive area of patch reefs and reef flats immediately offshore. The near-shore reef environment is more compa­rable to that of Sandy Hill Bay. The reefs near Shoal Bay East are protected by a large barrier reef located about 300 m further offshore. Based on test pits (n 
33) and the extent of artifacts on the surface of the site, Crock and Petersen (1999) estimate the original site covered at least 5 .6 ha. Corrected radio­carbon dates indicate Shoal Bay East was occupied as early as A.D. 665-890 with the main occupa­tion dated to ca. A.D. 1000-1400 or later (Crock 2000:165-169). Crock excavated the artifact and zooarchaeological samples discussed from a 1.0 x 
= 
2.0 m unit and an adjacent 50 cm x 50 cm test pit, placed in a portion of the site near the modern beach. Two dates obtained for the seven levels stud­ied (75-140 cm bgs; arbitrary levels 17-23), have

overlapping ranges between cal A.D. 1005 and 1410 (calibrated at 2a with the program CALIB 
5.0.l [Stuiver and Reimer 1993].) 
Evaluating the Evidence for an Elite Deposit 
To compare the relative proportions of prestige goods between sites, densities were calculated by cubic volume of site excavated, based on counts within the same aggregated levels that yielded the Late Ceramic Age archaeofaunal remains discussed below. Four categories of artifacts were used to create a cumulative index of prestige goods per cubic meter of midden. These include decorated ceramics, stone beads, three-pointed stone cemf idols and shell beads and ornaments. 
Within post-Saladoid or Late Ceramic Age assemblages throughout the Caribbean, a low per­centage of vessels are decorated, and pottery gen­erally is more coarse and less finely made compared to earlier styles (e.g., Hofman 1993; Petersen et al. 2004; Rouse 1992:95). Decorative attributes include broad line incision, modeled adornos, and pierced lugs. Within Anguillian assemblages, ceramic decoration is very rare, occurring on only .2 percent of ceramic sherds. By virtue of their rar­ity, the use of decorated forms was more restricted than that of undecorated vessels and may have coin­cided with specific events or rituals related to dis­plays of rank. 
The second category of status artifacts used in the comparison is stone beads. Like decorated ceramics, stone beads occur in much lower fre­quencies in Late Ceramic Age sites, compared to Early Ceramic Age sites. Stone beads are present in Anguillian assemblages, mainly manufactured from locally obtained calcite crystals. Their rarity and the ethnohistoric association between stone beads and Tafno caciques (e.g., Loven 1935:478) justify their use as an archaeological correlate of status and elite lineage.At the site of En Bas Saline in Haiti, Deagan (2004:619) found that stone beads were twice as common proportionally in elite-asso­ciated ritual contexts (feast pits and burials) com­pared to secular residential contexts. 
The third category of status artifacts is three­pointed stone cemf idols. Three-pointed cemfs of various sizes were manufactured in Anguilla from various local and imported materials, including cal­cirudite from neighboring St. Martin (Crock 2000; Knippenberg 2006). Ethnohistoric records indicate that three-pointed stones served Amerindians in various capacities, with larger, more elaborate idols controlled by elites and competed for (Oliver 2009; Pane 1999; Stevens-Arroyo 1988).0liver's (2009) research shows that, in addition to their ritual use, more elaborate three-pointed idols embodied ancestor spirits and had genealogies that were cen­tral to the objects' power, which was manipulated by elites. 
The fourth category of status objects is shell beads and ornaments. The low frequency of these items and ethnohistoric references to their use ug­gests restricted use potentially linked to displays of rank. These artifacts include a range of manu­factured personal adornments including beads made from cut and shaped bivalve and gastropod shells as well as more finely made incised inlays and sculpted shells. Some of the finest examples found in Anguilla are highly stylized shell masks (gua{zas) and mask fragments closely linked to sta­tus displays and elite exchange among the Taino (Oliver 2009; Pane 1999). 
For the specific test unit levels that produced the zooarchaeological assemblages studied from the four sites, the Sandy Hill unit ranked highest in den­sity of various "status" artifacts (Table 1). The Sandy Hill test unit excavation area has a signifi­cantly higher density per cubic meter in decorated ceramics, stone beads, shell beads and ornaments (Figure 3), and three-pointed idols (Figure 4) com­pared to the test-pit sample from across the site (df. = 27; t= 3.725; p < .001).At the 99.9 percent con­fidence level, the density of decorated ceramics in the test unit deposit is five times the highest prob­able density site wide (error range ER = 1 .34), the density of stone beads is more than five times higher (ER= .99), shell beads and ornaments nearly four times higher (ER= 5.2), and stone three pointers twice as high (ER= .3 1). 
These data strongly suggest that the test unit sample is an elite deposit within the Sandy Hill site. The overall densities of status artifacts within the Sandy Hill unit levels also rank highest when com­pared to test pit and test unit samples from the other three sites (Table 1). Only densities of three-pointed idols within unit levels at the Sandy Ground site and the Barnes Bay site outrank the densities recorded within the Sandy Hill unit levels. 
In addition to systematic excavation results, the

Anguilla Archaeological and Historical Society (AAHS) collected a number of status-related arti­facts from the immediate area around the test unit during construction in the mid 1980s. Notably, these prestige goods include a complete shell mask (guafza) and a fragment from a second (see Figure 3). Oliver (2009: 154) notes that these objects "per­sonified the political-religious potency and power of their original holder" (Oliver 2009:154). The AAHS collection also includes fragments of zoomorphic stone cemis, which are among the most elaborate found in the northern Lesser Antilles, and a high concentration of decorated pottery (Figure 5) (Crock and Petersen 1999, 2004; Douglas 1991). In addition, the AAHS recovered religious para­phernalia associated with consumption of the hal­lucinogen cohoba, likely controlled by caciques or shamans (behiques) (Oliver 2009:83-86; Pane 1999:25-26). A zoomorphic inhaler, carved in the form of a shark from bone, exhibits two holes on its dorsal surface connected to a single hole on the ventral surface (Figure 6) . This artifact, and an incised, bird-bone, inhaling tube recovered during the systematic excavation, are indicative of ritual behavior likely directed by higher ranking indi­viduals. A shell inlay recovered from the test unit also may be indicative of elite-controlled activities, if it was originally part of a composite wooden duho or statue (see Figure 3). The high density of prestige goods in the central portion of the site may be related to an elite household or, alternatively, 
deposits associated with displays of rank in the context of public feasts or ceremonies (e.g., Hay­den 2001:40).

To evaluate other potential feasting evidence in the ceramic assemblage, we compare the relative density of ceramic griddle sherds, related to the preparation of plant food staples such as manioc (Newsom and Wing 2004:48-49). Unusual num­bers of preparation vessels are an archaeological signature of feasts (Hayden 200 1:40) or higher engagement in food preparation by certain house­holds (Turk on 2004). Within the test unit ( .87 5 m2), the density of griddle sherds (18.29/m2) is signifi­cantly higher (df = 27; t = 3.725; p < .001), occur­ring at nearly three times the highest probable density site wide (µ = 3.28/ m2; ER= 3.28). The higher density of griddle sherds parallels a signif­icantly higher density of all ceramic sherds within the test unit(µ = 1,889/ m2), which is three times the highest probable mean density site wide (µ = 501/ m2; ER= 87; df = 27; t= 3.725; p < .001). Though the density of ceramics in the Sandy Hill unit levels is high for Anguillian sites, higher den­sities were recorded during sampling of the Sandy Ground site (Crock 2000). 
Unusual numbers of serving vessels are also a potential signature of feasting activity (DeBoer 2001:223-229; Hayden 2001:40; Rosenswig 2007: 17-18). Interestingly, dishes and bow ls make up the majority of vessel forms identified by Hof­man ( 1993: 154) in the AAHS sample of ceramics recovered from the central portion of the site, very close to our unit level sample. While the Sandy Hill sample Hofman studied has not been compared to the material excavated from the test unit or the site wide sample, she notes (1993:215) its similarity to deposits at the Bottom on Saba and suggests the

assemblages are comparable and may result from ceremonies or sociopolitical events. 
Within-and between-site comparisons of the distribution of status artifacts support the charac­terization of the Sandy Hill deposits as related to an elite residence or elite activity area. These data, in conjunction with a higher density of ceramics related to food preparation and the complementary evidence for a high percentage of both decorated and serving-type vessels, suggest that this elite deposit may represent feasting activities. 
Next, we evaluate whether or not the food remains within this elite deposit contain evidence of rank-based differences in food consumption. If elites in Anguilla controlled access to certain food resources, or the activities they presided over included the consumption of special foods, or elites were provisioned differently from non-elites, evi­dence of this behavior should be visible within the faunal assemblage. 
Zooarchaeological Methods 
As in all archaeological samples, taphonomic fac­tors and excavation methodologies influence zooar­chaeological results. This study is constrained by recovery technique. Specifically, recovery with coarse-mesh screen (3.2-6.4 mm) exaggerates the importance of large specimens, and small-bodied fishes are likely underrepresented in the assem­blages. However, recovery technique is a consis­tent bias in all sites discussed and should not affect

comparisons except at the lower end of each size range. Data for each 10-cm level were examined separately. For analysis, we combine data from all levels associated with the late Ceramic Age into one larger analytical unit, which represents refuse from an archaeologically discrete period. 
Carder examined vertebrate materials from all sites using standard zooarchaeological methods (Reitz and Wing 2008), and the comparative skele­tal collection of the Zooarchaeology Laboratory, Georgia Museum of Natural History, University of Georgia. Identifications were made to a taxonomic level consistent with accuracy given the elements represented, quality of preservation, and breakage patterns in each sample. We provide specimen weight of each taxon, number of identified speci­mens (NISP), minimum number of individuals (MNI), and estimates of biomass in the Sandy Hill taxonomic list (Table 2). Taxonomic lists of the other three assemblages are reported elsewhere (see Carder 2005; Carder et al. 2007). Each archaeo­logical collection studied contains bird fragments. Because the taxonomic identification of bird spec­imens is not complete, we include birds only in examining density of fauna! debris excavated from each archaeological site. Undoubtedly, birds are an important aspect of analysis and will provide addi­tional insights when complete. 
As a quantitative measure, NISP has limited value for assessing dietary contribution due to dif­fering degrees of fragmentation of the recovered vertebrate remains. MNI, a common estimate in zooarchaeological analyses, is a simple measure whereby all individuals are considered equal in terms of dietary contribution. While MNI is infor­mative, we include estimates of sample biomass and live weight because of variation in size and dietary contribution of recovered individuals, espe­cially fishes. Sample biomass refers to the quantity of tissue weight that a specified taxon might sup­ply as human food and is estimated from specimen weight. Live weight refers to the total live weight

of the individual fish predicted from the greatest anterior width of the atlas vertebra. Where preser­vation allowed, the greatest anterior width of fish atlases (first anterior cervical vertebra) were mea­sured following Reitz and Wing (2008:187). Bio­mass and live weight estimates are based on the allometric principle that proportions of body mass, skeletal mass, and skeletal dimensions change with increasing body size in a logarithmic fashion. The standard zooarchaeological quantification methods and fonnulae used for estimating sample biomass and live weight are described in Reitz and Wing (2008:235-239). We combine specimen weights for each taxon from the individual levels and use the combined weight to estimate sample biomass. This method results in a lower biomass estimate than if biomass is calculated for each taxon in each level and then summed (Reitz and Wing 2008:239). 
We calculate taxonomic diversity and equi­tability of the site assemblages. These estimates pennit discussion of subsistence strategies in terms of the variety of animals used at the site (diversity) and the evenness (equitability) with which those taxa were used. We use the Shannon Wiener Index for calculating diversity (Shannon and Weaver 1949:14) and the Sheldon Index (Sheldon 1969) for equitability. Formulae are found in Reitz and Wing (2008:111-112). In this study, sample rich­ness refers to the number of taxa for which MNI is estimated. In many zooarchaeological vertebrate analyses from sites in the West Indies, more indi­viduals are estimated if all specimens identified to the taxonomic level of family are analyzed together, rather than if specimens identified to a lower tax­onomic category are considered separately. For this reason we estimate diversity at the family level by MNI and biomass. Only biomass estimates for those taxa for which MNI is estimated are included in the family level analysis. 

We estimate mean trophic level (TL) by com­bining the most recent 2010 trophic level assign­ments from the fishbase database for Caribbean fishes (Froese and Pauley 2004) with allometric estimates of biomass in the zooarchaeological assemblages for the same taxa (following Reitz 2004). Where identifications in the vertebrate remains are not to species, the trophic level for the closest taxonomic category is used. In this analy-
