
COPPER PIGMENT-MAKING IN THE ATACAMA DESERT (NORTHERN CHILE) 
Marcela Sepulveda R., Valentina Figueroa L., and Sandrine Pages-Camagna 
Results of physico-chemical analysis of samples of rock paintings and blue and green pigments from the Atacama Desert (northern Chile) allow us to incorporate a new technology, pigment production, to processes of mining and copper pro­duction, which until now have been related only to lapidary and metal working. Archaeological contexts associated with paints and pigments, as well as information available from historical times, allow us to suggest hypotheses about their importance in sharing networks of late prehispanic times (AD. 900-1550) and after Spanish contact. Jn these times, the production and circulation of pigments would have closely connected the Upper Loa region to the Lfpez region in south­western Bolivia and other regions of the Atacama Desert.

En estos tiempos, la produccion y circulacion de pigmentos habrfan conectado estrechamente la region del Loa Superior con la region de Lfpez en el sudoeste de Bolivia y otras regiones del Desierto de Atacama. 
he oldest mining development in South TAmerica known so far is the iron oxide mine of San Ramon 15, on the coast of Antofa­gasta Region, northern Chile (ca. 10,500 B.P.) (Salazar, Jackson et al. 2011). The Atacama Desert is renowned for its mineral wealth, especially its large copper deposits. Since pre his panic times, cop­per ore deposits have been exploited for lapidary and metallurgical processes associated with the manufacture of instruments and prestige goods using sophisticated technologies (Nunez 1987, 1999). The manufacture of beads (Carrion 2010; Rees 1999; Soto 2006, 2010) and metallic objects (Figueroa, Montero, and Rovira 2010; Letchman and Macfarlane 2005; Salazar, Salinas et al. 2010; Salazar, Castro et al. 20 JO; Salazar, Figueroa et al. 2011) created a demand for copper ore in places where regional caravanning facilitated circulation of such goods (Berenguer 2004; Lecoq 1991; Pimentel 2013). 
In 2004, analysis was conducted by Scanning Electron Microscope connected to an energy-dis­persive X-ray spectrometer (SEM-EDX) of sam­ples taken from rock art paintings in the highlands of the Antofagasta region . These analyses were developed with the objective of evaluating the com­plexity of rock art painting technologies because previous (unpublished) analyses were conducted only on red paintings (Sepulveda 2006, 2009; Sepulveda and Laval 2010a). The physico-chem­ical composition of rock paintings was analyzed to obtain more precise information about the nature of the composition, granulometry, and mixture of the components used, especially pigments .

LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 24, No. 4, 2013] 
ular attention was paid to elemental characteriza­tion of inorganic phases of the paint preparations (Sepulveda and Laval 2010b). In three samples from Incahuasi Inca and Confluencia sites, analy­sis indicated for the first time the presence of cop­per elements in the paint. Consequently, we suggest that, in the Atacama Desert, copper ore was also used as a paint pigment (Sepulveda and Laval 201 Ob). These results revealed a use for copper ore in prehispanic times that was previously unknown, particularly in the South-Central Andes region . 
In the present study, we expand our initial results with more samples and with the objective of spec­ifying the mineralogical composition of rock art paintings from the Upper Loa River (highlands of the Antofagasta region) in the Atacama Desert (Fig­ure 1). Additionally, we analyze local ore samples from Incahuasi, a prehispanic and present-day small-scale mining site from this region. To build a comprehensive understanding of all possible tech­nologies associated with the use of copper ore, we also analyzed samples of green powder, possibly pigment, taken from local burial contexts (Los Abuelos de Caspana and Dupont-I cemeteries) in the same region. 
These new results allow us to build a more detailed picture of the "chaine operatoire ," or oper­ational sequence, of blue and green pigments and paints produced from copper ore in Atacama Desert. The new results identify different stages of a complex operational sequence that included ore extraction, metal production, lapidary, and pigment production, evidence of which has been found in many archaeological contexts in the region. Finally, the results are described as components of the processes related to copper ore extraction and use in the region and its possible relation to the exchange of goods occurring during late prehis­panic (A.D. 900-1550) and historic times (AD. 1600-1700). 
Copper Ore Production in the Atacama Desert 
In the Atacama Desert, the many mines, waste rock piles, and artifacts associated with mining opera­tions provide evidence of a long-standing mining tradition in the region (Nufiez 1999; Salazar 2008; Salazar and Salinas 2008). It was in this context that an ancient miner mummy, designated "Cop­per Man,"1 was discovered. This figure was found in the Chuquicamata sector with a series of miner's artifacts, including hammers with wood and leather handles, a rawhide bag, and a woven basket (Bird 1977-1978, 1979; Craddock 1990; Craddock et al. 2003; Figueroa, Salinaset al. 2010; Figueroa et al. 2013). This and other miner mummies indicate that mining technology was already highly developed by sometime in the Middle Horizon period (between. A .D . 500-1000). Th us, we propose that the use of copper ore to make pigments was part of a framework of well-established regional tech­nologies that included lapidary and metallurgy. These technologies were linked to the regional car­avan trade, as they facilitated the exchange of sur­plus mining products for goods from Northwest Argentina and the Bolivian Altiplano (Nunez 1987, 1999; Nufiez and Dillehay 1995; Salazar 2002). 
Investigation of lapidary, which predates met­allurgy in the Atacama region (Salazar 2002), has focused mainly on reconstructing the operational sequence of bead manufacture (Rees 1999; Soto 2006, 2010). Several recent studies examining the operational sequence of copper ore bead produc­tion, use, and distribution in the Formative period have confirmed the role that this industry played in regional exchange networks (Garcfa-Albarrido 2007; Salazar, Salinas et al . 2010; Sinclaire 2004). This trading of goods and general interactions among groups in the "circumpuna" region contin­ued into colonial times, when Lozano de Machuca noted that green stones (turquoise) of Atacama were highly valued by Chiriguano chiefs, who came all the way "to Lfpez and even to Atacama" (Platt et al. 2006: 152) to acquire them. 
In regard to the compositional analysis of cop­per ore used in lapidary, a recent study conducted by Westfall et al . (2010) identified blue and green minerals present in the Formative period (ca. 1200 B.C.-A.D. 500) cemetery of Chorillos, near the city of Calama (Antofagasta region). Their results expanded the traditional term commonly used by archaeologists in this field, copper ore, by noting that it encompasses a wide variety of ores from sources near or far from their place of use. The chemical composition of the recovered beads is indicative of this, as it shows that many different ores were used to manufacture them, not only the usual malachite (green) and azurite (blue). The analysis also shows that the color of the mineral

Studies of metallurgy have been conducted sepa­rately from those on lapidary. In addition to Latcham 's (1936, 1938) seminal study of Atacama metallurgy, the works of Rodrfguez on Inca metallurgy at the Cas­pana locality in the Antofagasta Region and North­west Argentina have the distinction of being the first to introduce the notion of technical tradition for Ata­cama metallurgical production. This concept is under­stood as the set of elements present in the technological activities of a social group: operational sequences, atti­tudes toward material, organization of the work, and 7 4, 1981, 
1986). In addition, Nunez (1987, 1999, 2005) has highlighted the role of these metals as prestige goods within mechanisms of extra-regional interaction. More recent studies incorporated local and regional analyses of mining-metallurgical production,empha­sizing both the social dimension and historic trans­formations in the production systems and symbolic aspects of mining (Salazar 2002, 2003-2004, 2008). There have been few archaeometric studies beyond those conducted on the Formative site of Ramaditas in the Tarapacii Region, north of our region of study (Graffam et al. 1994), and l.echtman and Macfar­lane's work (2005) on the Middle Horizon of San Pedro de Atacama. But several projects are currently ongoing in this area (Figueroa, Montero, and Rovira 2010; Maldonado et al. 2010; Salazar, Figueroa et al. 2011) and on the Atacama coast (Figueroa 2012; Figueroa et al. 2009; Salazar, Castro et al. 2010; Salazar, Figueroa et al. 2010). 
In regard to copper ore pigments, until recently no precise information was available for the Ata­cama Desert (Sepulveda 2006; Sepulveda and Laval 2010a). 
Description of Samples, 
Analytical Techniques, and Results 

Nine samples were analyzed in this new study (Table 1) .2 Six were from rock paintings (one from Santa Barbara in Alto Loa, three from Incahuasi Inca [Figure 2], two from the Confluencia site in the Rio Salado basin), and two were pigments from ancient leather pouches (from Dupont 1 [Chunchuri] and Los Abuelos de Caspana ceme­teries) (Figure 3). The last sample consisted offrag­ments from a present-day small-scale mining oper­ation at the lncahuasi site. Though the samples are few in number, they are sufficient for our discus­sion, as there is only scant evidence of the use of these pigments in rock paintings in the surround­ing regions. 
Each sample, without preparation, was observed through a binocular microscope at increasing mag­nifications (50x to 500x) (Nikon-Labophot 2­Xenon lamp,B-2Afilter; excitation,450 to490 nm; barrier, 520 nm; dichroic mirror, 505 nm). We col­lected valuable information concerning the mate­rial's color and its homogeneity. In the second step, we observed and analyzed samples using a Scan­ning Electron Microscope connected to an energy­dispersive X-ray spectrometer (SEM-EDX; Philips XL 30 CP), in two detection modes: secondary electrons (SE) and backscattered electrons (BSE). The powders are put on a carbon pellet and carbon coated in order to observe the size and the shape of the grains. We also obtained the elemental com­position of each grain. For Incahuasi and Confluen­cia alone, we analyzed sample stratigraphy with the previous sample preparation prior to resin, a poly­mer material. 
For the last step, the structural organization of the samples was collected by Raman spectrome­try (Raman confocal Jobin-Yvon Infinity, Notch filter, visible excitation: 532 nm, laser diameter: 5µm, laser power: 12 µ W, acquisition time around 30 minutes, with 5 accumulations). The powder or fragments are put directly under the laser beam. The bands of the Raman spectra give the vibration energy of the bonds, depending on the atoms and the angles between bonded atoms. 
Observations of the paint samples indicate that all have a heterogeneous composition, made up of a mixture of white 100 µm-grains3 with smaller green or blue particles. In addition to data from field observations, stratigraphic analysis of the paint samples from Incahuasi, Confluencia, and Santa Barbara shows that layers of paint are thick and dense to a depth of 60 µm, producing colors that are bright and opaque to the naked eye. In all cases, we identified only one layer of blue or green paint. At Incahuasi (INCO 1) these layers overlap a layer of red paint. 
The powders of raw materials contain only green or bluish grains, without white contributions: the Dupont 1 sample is homogeneous and green,
