engaged elsewhere. The history of these Tieu! potters also highlights that the major change in pottery produc­tion was not an increase in scale, but rather an increase in intensity, which required a larger production space separate from generalized domestic spaces. 
In contrast to traditional household potters, Chapters 6, 7, and 8 describe nonlocal and non-household produc­tion units, from entrepreneurial workshops to nontradi­tional potters to attached specialists in hotel workshops. These nontraditional production units are established by nonlocals, non-potters, government initiatives, or hotel owners and managers. All are unstable, not lasting beyond the lifetime of the original owner, with the few exceptions becoming household-based workshops. All but one of the entrepreneurial workshops came into being after the foundation of the Maya Riviera resorts. Although all the government workshops failed rapidly, Arnold underscores that they had a tremendous impact on Tieu! because they taught the local potters new tech­nology, such as the use of molds and nontraditional paints, and how to paint copies of ancient Maya designs. 
The final two chapters return to the main points of the book: what was the major change in pottery produc­tion over the last 50 years, and how can the ethnographic study of Ticul potters help us to understand ancient pot­tery production? The answer to neither question is the obvious one. Clearly, pottery production in Tieu! changed from traditional vessels to tourist ware (from plant pots to ancient Maya imitations to miniature Christmas creche scenes). Clearly, demand for Tieu! pottery increased as tourism boomed in Yucatan, so Tieu! pottery production intensified. But, not so obviously, Arnold demonstrates that this increased demand was met not by the evolution of larger production units, but rather by intensifying pro­duction within the same small-scale household units that functioned since the 1960s (pp. 243-247). Because of Yucatan 's climate and weather, the only way to intensify pottery production within households was to build more roofed space devoted exclusively to production, which would protect raw materials, unfired vessels, and crafting in all its stages from the elements. Lastly, Arnold reflects on what Tieu! potters can tell us about ancient pottery production. Rather than thinking of these potters as part­time, we should see them as intermittent crafters, limited by the yearly and seasonal weather patterns, by rising and falling demands for their products, and by the potter's life cycle. Even more importantly, Ti cul potters are multi­crafters who practice potting and many other crafts (mak­ing hammocks, Panama hats, woven dresses, pedaling tricycle taxis,etc.) in a "very elastic" system of risk man­agement based on the household (p. 283). 
Arnold's book is a testimonial to continuity in a whole community of potters in the face of tremendous social, political, and economic transformation over the last half century. By charting the history of these potters and their families, he provides a unique diachronic account of Maya crafting. He does, however, leave me with a few unanswered questions: What does potting mean to these individuals? Are they proud of it? Is it part of their iden­tity? Why do some families drop potting so easily, while others continue to practice it without interruption?

This book is a welcome addition to the growing literature on Middle Horizon Peru. The contributors to this volume present survey data from the Cotahuasi Valley in Are­quipa and excavation data from one site identified on survey (Tenahaha) to understand the nature ofWari influ­ence during the second half of the Middle Horizon. They document several areas of change through time and explore the role of the Wari state during these changes. The book moves away from a traditional imperial model and disentangles the notion of political control from that of stylistic influence. 
Chapter 1 lays out the theoretical foundation of the volume. Justin Jennings and Willy Yepez Alvarez intro­duce the different models that have been proposed to explain Wari. They point out the weaknesses of the impe­rial model in understanding regions where little Wari impact has been noted and propose an alternative model-the globalization model. They suggest that the changes seen in Cotahuasi are not the result of the incor­poration of that region into the Wari state, but instead are the product of local responses to increasing population, inequality, and interregional interaction. 
Chapter 2 presents a brief history of research con­ducted in the Coatahuasi Valley and an assessment of the nature ofWari influence based on survey data. Jennings compares settlement pattern data that his team obtained in Cotahuasi for the pre-Middle Horizon, Middle Hori­zon, and Late Intermediate periods to the archaeological expectations of the imperial model. Changes in material culture, including the proliferation of Wari-influenced items, were not accompanied by either power consoli­dation (political centralization seen by a hierarchy of settlements) or economic reorganization for the extrac­tion of tribute. Jennings concludes that the Wari did not dominate the valley during the Middle Horizon; Wari's profound influence on local material culture was not supplemented by political control.

directed excavations (218 .5 m2) between 2004 and 2007. Tenahaha was mainly occupied during the Middle Hori­zon, whereas its neighbor Collota (originally confused for a Wari administrative center) was occupied in the Late Horizon. Yepez Alvarez describes the field method­ology in detail and presents 26 radiocarbon dates obtained from excavated samples. Fifteen dates corre­spond to the Middle Horizon, all of which belong to the second half of the period (A.D. 850-1050). 
In Chapter 4, Jennings and colleagues describe the excavations that took place in the ceremonial/residential sector of the site. The authors use evidence found in the houses, enclosures, storage facilities, and agricultural terraces to argue that the site was not permanently occu­pied, but instead was a locale for the performance of rit­uals and feasts. Tenahaha would have been a pilgrimage center and necropolis where people from surrounding villages periodically gathered to honor and bury their dead. 
In Chapter 5, Yepez Alvarez and colleagues describe the excavation of seven tombs containing at least 171 individuals in the funerary zone at Tenahaha. The tombs included primary and secondary burials, and the bones and offerings were often moved and reorganized, indi­cating that tombs were reopened several times. Most individuals were buried with ceramic vessels, several of which were Wari-influenced. Some women, men, and children were buried with prestige and exotic goods that could point to emerging inherited status differences. 
Chapters 6-9 present analyses conducted on artifacts and human remains recovered at Tenahaha. In Chapter 6, Oscar Huaman Lopez and colleagues describe four local ceramic styles used during the Middle Horizon, among which two were Wari-influenced. These Wari­influenced vessels are reminiscent of several Wari and Wari-related styles, including Huamanga, Vifiaque, Pachacamac, and Atarco. In Chapter 7, Patricia Bedre gal and colleagues present a provenience study (INAA) of the pottery found in the Cotahuasi Valley. Results indicate that all Middle Horizon pottery-even the most Wari­influenced-was local and that none of the tested frag­ments came from Ayacucho. 
In Chapter 8, Maria Ines D. Velarde and colleagues briefly describe the metal objects recovered at Tenahaha, most of which were tupus made of ternary bronze. In Chapter 9, Corina M. Kellner and colleagues present the analyses of human remains. The most common patholo­gies noted on these remains suggest a diet high in maize and repeated agricultural work, while infections and other conditions were rare. Limited evidence of trauma indicates that people buried at Tenahaha were seldom engaged in interpersonal conflicts. 
In Chapter 10, Jennings concludes that the Cotahuasi Valley was neither conquered nor controlled by the Wari state, but instead that Wari influence on material culture spread through interregional interaction networks. Jen­nings argues that the Middle Horizon in Cotahuasi was a time of increased social tensions due to larger village sizes, emerging social inequality, and interregional inter­actions; Tenahaha would have been built to bring people together and relieve these tensions. The Wari would have contributed to these tensions by introducing (although indirectly) new items and ideas to the region, which quickly became popular and important in the creation of a new "cosmopolitan" identity (p. 209). Finally, the Appendix (Matthew J. Edwards) offers preliminary data from the Late Horizon occupation of the neighboring site of Collota. Most of the chapter is dedicated to the demonstration that the site was indeed an Inka-and not a Wari -settlement. 
This volume presents convincing evidence that the Cotahuasi Valley was not under Wari control during the Middle Horizon. Despite notable changes during that period, Wari stylistic influence did not result in political or economic control. These findings echo what other scholars are finding in other regions of Peru and should allow Andean archaeologists not only to rethink the Mid­dle Horizon but also to redefine models of state expansion and culture contact and reevaluate archaeological signa­tures of state control. Early states often built outposts and enclaves to extract key resources in areas that they did not always dominate. Other regions where such enclaves were not present could obtain or emulate a state's material culture without necessarily compromis­ing their sovereignty. Cotahuasi seems to be one of these areas where the production and use ofWari-like material culture did not result in the loss of local autonomy.

Mesoamerican figurine studies have matured. One sign of that maturity is the publication of extended studies of specific figurine assemblages. Christina Halperin 's book is an example, greatly advancing our understanding of Classic Maya figurine variation, distribution, and use in the southern Maya lowlands. Halperin begins with an assemblage of figurines generated through work at Motul de San Jose, in the Guatemalan Peten. She adds data on figurine assemblages from 14 other sites in the Peten and in Belize. Significant comparisons are made to fig­urines from the western Maya lowlands, from Jaina and from the Uhia tradition of northern Honduras, drawing on recent work by other analysts. Yet the book does not
