at Lamanai (Wrobel and Graham) could not be clearly characterized as local or foreign. Mayapan is the focus for Serafin and colleagues, where the teeth do indicate nonlocal elites but victims of violence were local and not necessarily elites. 
Strontium isotope analyses of human skeletons pro­vide strong evidence of a nonlocal origin for adults, as diets reflect geographic location that can indicate that an individual lived in a different place as a child. Scherer and Wright consider the history of Tikal, finding that there was immigration in the Early Classic and probable outmigration at abandonment of the site in the Terminal Classic. Nonlocals were from the Guatemalan highlands, northern Yucatan, and Belize, still likely to be Maya. Price and colleagues look more generally at the Maya region, finding most dramatically European and African individuals in a Colonial cemetery. 
The last two chapters depend little on population movement. Duncan and Hageman look for intracemetery kin at lxlu, Guatemala, and found little support for the importance of biological descent for coresidence at sites, but that may be a defect of nonmetric traits. Tiesler's study of cranial shaping reveals changes in the meaning of the shapes, from local identity to a homogeneous shape with perhaps pan-Mesoamerican meaning. 
Thus, most chapters were not able to really show large-scale population movements among the prehis­panic Maya, using a variety of methods in archaeology and bioarchaeology that could reveal such movements. The Maya samples available are generally inconclusive or generally showed continuity across the region, indi­cating, as hypothesized by Wrobel and Graham and shown at Tikal, that movements were mostly among the Maya, not from far away places in Mesoamerica. It is the movements of individuals for economic or mating purposes that appear to create the patterns found archae­ologically and bioarchaeologically, which underlie the population dynamics here.

It was in the mid-I 990s when my English teacher gave me the fourth edition of Michael Coe's book The Maya, after a trip to New York.At that time, I was in secondary school and was getting deeply interested in the ancient Maya civilization. Living in a small city in Poland, such publications were impossible to acquire if you did not have friends or relatives living abroad. Before receiving Coe's book, my knowledge about the Maya was limited to what I had read in popular literature (including a book by Diiniken), in older books such as Gods, Graves and Scholars by C. W. Ceram, or in outdated publications from the 1960s by Gallenkamp. Coe's The Maya was the first specialist publication that introduced me to the world of this fascinating ancient civilization. Thames and Hudson has just released the updated ninth edition of this classic, comprising 320 pages with 213 illustra­tions and co-authored by another prominent Mayanist­Stephen Houston, professor of anthropology at Brown University. 
The book opens with an introduction to Maya culture, which provides geographic, cultural and linguistic back­ground and presents a chronology of Maya civilization. Also, Coe and Houston describe three different regions that form what we define as the Maya Area. The second chapter deals with the evidence of the earliest human occupation in the area, from the first hunter-gatherers of the Paleoindian period through the Archaic (when people started the domestication and cultivation of crops, includ­ing maize), and onward to the beginnings of the Preclas­sic, when the first densely inhabited villages and ceramics appeared. The authors inform us about the first settlement of the New World and about the timing of this process. They discuss the most important sites from the Paleoin­dian or Early Hunters period, including the recent dis­covery of the "Hoyo Negro girl," found in a now-flooded chamber of a well or cenote in northeastern Yucatan. This is a skeleton of a teenager, ca. 12,900-12,700 years old, which is the oldest human remain found in the entire Maya Area. 
Coe and Houston continue with the origins of the Preclassic Maya in the Pacific coast, highlands, and low­lands, mentioning the latest finds from Ceibal, where monumental architecture rivaling, and most probably preceding that of the Olmec capital of La Venta, was recorded. The third chapter presents the rise and growth of Maya civilization during the Late Preclassic ( 400/300 B.C.-A.D. 250), with its typical hallmarks such as masonry-vaulted architectural buildings, a sophisticated naturalistic art style expressed mainly in low-relief, and the appearance and spread of the Long Count calendar and writing. These cultural innovations and changes are best seen in northern Guatemala, especially in the Mirador Basin and its surroundings, where many large centers dotted with pyramids arose, along with the major city of El Mirador that might have been the capital of the first Lowland Maya state. Coe and Houston describe the most important Late Preclassic Maya centers with exam­ples of monumental architecture, carved monuments, and other examples of public art, complemented with information on new discoveries from sites such as El Palmar in Guatemala and El Mirador itself. A special section is devoted to the site of San Bartolo, where spec­tacular examples of wall paintings and the first examples of Maya script were discovered. The next important

LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 27, No. 1, 2016) 
period of Maya history, the Early Classic (ca. A.D. 250­600), is described in the fourth chapter of the book. Here, the major focus is on the relationship between the Maya and the mighty Central Mexican metropolis ofTeotihua­can. Citing Teotihuacan-related finds from various Maya sites, the authors espouse the Teotihuacan invasion model and argue that both the highlands (with Kaminaljuyu as its major center) and the lowlands fell under the dominion of this Central Mexican superpower. While describing Early Classic culture in the Maya lowlands and the city of Tikal, Coe and Houston recall the latest discoveries in El Zotz, one of Tikal's subordinate states, where a richly equipped tomb (possibly of a founder of a local dynasty) and a beautifully rendered stucco frieze depict­ing Chahk or the rain deity was found. The El Zotz frieze, along with another recently discovered stucco cornice from Holmul (highlighted in the next chapter) can be placed among the most outstanding examples of Maya art from the Classic period. 
In Chapter 5, we learn about Classic Maya civilization at its apogee, i.e., betweenA.D.600 and 900. The chapter starts with some general information about Maya urban­ism: the size of Maya centers, the demographics and architectural diversity during the Late Classic. We learn about the latest technology being used in Maya archae­ology, such as LiDAR, which helped estimate the size and density of Maya cities and their suburban zones. This introduction is followed with the description of major Maya sites and regions such as Tikal, Copan, Quirigua, Calakmul, Palenque, as well as Petexbatun and Northern Area sites. The reader is familiarized with the names of the most important Maya kings and their achievements, as well as the major pieces of art and architecture in these centers. The chapter ends with a brief outline of Late Classic art, focusing mainly on ceramic and stone artifacts. 
Classic Maya civilization ends with a sudden collapse that is described in the sixth chapter. It features the aban­donment of Maya cities in the southern lowlands, as well as the growth of new powers in the North Area, where the major polity was Chichen ltza. Coe and Houston list the major factors that must have led to the collapse of the Classic Maya, arguing that intensification of warfare, overpopulation, and droughts played a key role in this process. Overpopulation forced the further degradation of the natural environment, which was already threatened by prolonged and intense droughts. In trying to explain this collapse, they include up-to-date research data; for example, the results of David Lentz's research team on Tikal wooden lintels indicates that there must have been a drop in tall-forest growth in the Tikal region by the 740s, most likely induced by uncontrolled growth of Maya population towards the end of the Classic era. 
This outline of precolumbian Maya civilization is rounded off with a presentation of the Postclassic period, where the major focus is the growth of Chichen Itza in northern Yucatan. The authors support a rather contro­versial theory (but supported by some scholars) that posits an invasion of Northern Yucatan by the Toltecs from Central Mexico. 
The Maya way of life on the eve of the conquest, including commerce, subsistence, and sociopolitical organization, figures in the eighth chapter. Compared to previous editions, the ninth chapter in the present edition of the book is the most updated and enlarged section and features religion, cosmovision, mathematics, and the cal­endar and astronomy of the Maya. We then move to the part devoted to the Maya writing system, acquiring basic know ledge about the structure of the Maya script and the history of how it was deciphered. Lastly, the geopolitical structure of the Classic Maya is outlined, and a short sec­tion on objects (both buildings as well as portable arti­facts), labeled with the names of their owners, is provided at the end of the ninth chapter. 
The most recent history of the modem Maya is pre­sented in the last chapter of the book, beginning with the Spanish conquest and finishing with the civil war in Guatemala, which took a heavy toll on the lives of the indigenous people. Coe and Houston present an account of the holocaust of the Conquest period, the long years of destruction and mutilation of Maya tradition, as well as acculturation during Colonial times; they also show that, despite these events, more than five million Maya live in Mexico and Central America today and speak their own languages. 
Coe and Houston's book constitutes one of the major introductions to Maya civilization for the layman inter­ested in ancient history, as well as for archaeology stu­dents. Mayanists who wish to update and refresh their knowledge of different aspects of Maya civilization should also reach for it. This is a highly recommended book, and the fact that it is written by two world­renowned experts on Maya and Mesoamerica ensures the highest standards for this book.
