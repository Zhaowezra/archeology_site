RegionalSettlementDemography inArchaeology is written in an admirably clear and highly readable, con-versationalstyle.Itistrulyenjoyabletoread.Thewritingis at the same time optimistic about the possibilities fordemographic reconstruction and appropriately cautiousabout over-interpreting results. The book doesn t justtell the reader how to accomplish a specific task; it pro-videsacontextthatnurturesone sabilitytothinkthroughandplanananalyticaltrajectoryinamannersensitivetoa broad range of local circumstances.
Everybookmakestradeoffs,includingbetweendetailand readability. While in a number of places I was leftwishingformore,intheendIcan targuewiththechoicesmade here because the book works very well as acompactwhole.There is no indexand there are no cita-tionsinthetext.Anannotatedlistofadditionalreferences is provided at the end of all but the final chapters, andtheexamplesarefullyreferenced.Mostchaptershaveanovel Q&Asection that effectively reinforces their keypoints. In the book s thoughtful layout, figures usuallyface the page in which they are discussed.
I can find very little to criticize in this volume. Iwouldhavelikedmorediscussionoftotalaccumulation studies.Insomecases,thesubstantivechallengestoexe-cuting the proposed methods seem to me understated,but perhaps that implicit optimism is for the best. Thisapplies to the discussion of the magic number that isusedtoconvertperiod-specificsurfaceartifactdensitiestonumbersofpeople.Similarly,Iamnotassanguineasthe authors concerning the use of augering, althoughthey do acknowledge that an auger hole placed withinan occupation area may return no artifacts.

This finding overturnsthe assumption of about 30 years of previous researchthat presumed the floors to be made of clay-rich sedi-ments from surrounding environments. Since theseappear not to be deliberate constructions, they may betaken instead to represent a sudden shift in subsistenceadaptationsoranequallysuddenchangeforsomereasonto the organization of labor.

The site of Casas Grandes (or Paquimé), Chihuahua isone of the largest and most important archaeologicalsites in the Northwest of México and the Southwest of the United States. From 1958 to 1961, the Joint CasasGrandes Expedition (JCGE) under the direction ofCharles C. Di Peso of the Amerind Foundation and EduardoContrerasSánchezoftheInstitutoNacionalde Antropología e Historia conducted research at the site.In the largest international collaborative excavations inthehistoryoftheNorthwest/Southwest(NW/SW),theyuncovered11roomblocks,anelitetomb,ritualmounds,two ball courts, tons of ceramics, lithics and shell arti-facts, hundreds of skeletons of macaws and their pens,and copper from West Mexico.
