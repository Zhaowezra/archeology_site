IMPERIAL NEEDS, IMPERIAL METHODS: CHIMÚ CERAMIC
MANUFACTURING PROCESS THROUGH CT SCAN ANALYSIS OF 
STIRRUP­SPOUT BOTTLES 

Valentine Wauters 
The stirrup­spout bottle is one of the most representative forms in the Chimú (A.D. 900­1470) ceramic repertoire. I discussthe ceramic assemblage of this coastal culture and describes more precisely the various manufacturing processes of thestirrup­spout bottle. Although molds used to produce these complex vessels are known today, only little information hasbeen published on the various stages involved in their manufacture. My purpose is to contribute to this research usingmedical imaging computed tomography (CT) scans of intact stirrup­spout vessels. Based on my findings, I propose thatchanges in the construction of these vessels correlated with a transition in ceramic production to a semi­industrial levelduring the time of the Chimú Empire.

Other authors, suchasCollier(1955:129–131),Digby(1948),Donnan(1992),andTschaunerandcolleagues(1994:373),havealsobrieflytouchedonthissubject.My pur­pose is to use archaeometry via medical imagingto contribute to amore detailedandthorough un­derstanding of the chaîne opératoire of the stir­rup­spout bottle. The identification and analysisof macro­traces on the inner vessel surfaces via CT scan is the basis of this study. 
Stirrup­Spout Bottle Shaping 

Chimú ceramists used two shaping techniques:modeling (using paddle and anvil) and molding.The two techniques could be used in the sameworkshop, and even be combined for the manu­factureofasingleitem(Tschauneretal.1994:374).Fortheproductionofstirrup­spoutbottles,Chimúpotterspreferredtheuseofmolds,specificallytwotypes of molding techniques. The bottle could becomposedofdifferentpartsmoldedseparatelyandthen assembled, or it could be made in a single,complete, or total mold that included the stirrup­spouthandleandthechamber.Bothtypesofmolds were of the vertical bivalve type, which was in­heritedfromtheearlierMocheculture.Moldsused by Moche potters had an opening at the base or atthetopofthechamber,butduringthelaterChimúperiod the opening was always found on the base(Bankes 1989:Figure 37, Donnan 1992:Figure 8)for technical reasons (see below).
The use of molds offers many advantages:speed and easiness in learning the technique(Arnold 1999:64­65) and in shaping the vessel(Shepard 1956:63), standardization (especiallyfor the reproduction of major iconographicthemes) (Tschauner 2006:183), and serial pro­ductionofidenticalobjects(Mowat1988).Chimúceramic manufacturing is indeed referred to as“massproduction” (BawdenandConrad1982:64,Collier 1955:118, 1959:428, Donnan 1992:94).
The use of molds also has disadvantages. Themolds allow speed in execution but Arnold(1999:67–69)andCostin(2007:290)rightlypointoutthat other time­consuming steps are required,such as drying the piece at different manufactur­ing stages. Therefore, the continuous productionflowrequiredmultiplemolds whosemanufacturealso generated work. Each potter had several

molds allowing production of new vessels whileother pieces were drying in their molds.
The use of molds also required large spacesfor the manufacturing and drying of the pieces(preferably protected from bad weather) as wellas for storage of the molds (Arnold 1999:70–71,Tschauner 2001:214–215, 2006:176, 2009:275).The molds prescribed the production of smaller­sized vessels (not exceeding 20 cm), because thedryingtimefor larger piecesisverylong(Arnold1999:66–67). Supporting this argument,Tschauner(2001:185,226,TschaunerandWagner2003:166)informsusthatatthePampadeBurrosceramic workshop (site number S166C), moldedvessels were of small size. 
The reason for the common use of molds is probably due to the fact that they could be usedby a large number of artisans because the tech­nique is quite simple and does not require greatskills (Arnold 1999:64–65). If ceramics madefromseparately moldedpartswere manufacturedby relatively unskilled artisans, those made froma total mold could be produced by even less ex­perienced craftsmen, allowing the production ofvery large number of vessels. 

SecularTradition and Transformation 

Chimústirrup­spoutbottle productionreflectstheknowledgeofalongceramictradition,establishedover many generations in the same region. Allcultures from the North Coast of Peru that pro­duced stirrup­spout bottles with molds used thevertical bivalve mold, sharing a “common tech­nological tradition” (Wauters 2008). AlthoughChimú potters adopted the use of bivalve moldsforchambermanufacturefromtheirpredecessors,the Moche, they did not use the potential of thistechnology in the same way.
The context of stirrup­spout bottle productionalso changed. During the Moche period, the at­tached ceramic specialists who produced thesefine vessels did so under the control of rulers or urban elites (Bernier 2009; Jackson 2008:50–51;RusselandJackson2001).Thepottersthemselveswere sometimes considered members of the Moche elite (Uceda and Armas 1998:107­108).On thecontrary,Chimú potters were of lower so­cial status, and ceramic workshops were locatedmainly in provincial sites showing no evidence of government control (see below).
The innovation is the use of a two­piece moldfor the stirrup­spout handle manufacture and theuse of a second two­piece mold for the manufac­ture of both the chamber and the stirrup­spouthandle. Potters of the Sicán­Lambayeque (A.D.750–1375) culture used a similar technique (Shi­mada and Wagner 2007:178, 189–195, Figures9.7, 9.12–13). This culture coexisted with theChimú for several centuries in the region beforethe latter conquered and assimilated it to theirempire aroundA.D. 1350(Mackey 2000; Conleeet al. 2004).
During the Inca period (A.D. 1450–1532),Chimú ceramics become more stylistically di­verse. The Chimú­Inca ceramic style combinedChimú forms and techniques with Inca elements(Mackey2004:87).Thisnew styleincludedmorefrequentpolychrome decorations andamorepro­nounced liponthespout.AlthoughIncaceramicsfrom Cuzco were generally produced using coil­ing, Chimú­Inca style vessels were made usingmolds (Donnan 1992:112–115, Hayashida1999:344–346, Levine 2011:170–171, Sidoroff2005:101–107). Artisans continued to use re­gional technological traditions while adoptingand integrating some shapes and patterns of thenew imperial power.For example,aryballoid jarsproducedat provincialsitesare markedly smaller(20–30 cm) than those produced in Cuzco (up to100 cm; Sidoroff 2005:102, 106). Chimú crafts­men copied the typical Inca vessel form but didso using local mold technology (Donnan1992:218–219), which ultimately restricted thesize of the vessel. 

Chimú Ceramists and Work Organization 

DuringtheChimúperiod,thestatusofpottersap­pears to have declined, in contrast to artisansworking on metallurgy and textiles. Moreover, itseems that of the many craft specialists workingat Chan­Chan, none were potters (J Topic1982:165;Tschauner2001:174).Craftproductionfocused on high quality goods, metalwork, andtextiles manufactured in workshops associatedwith the residences of the ruling elite (J Topic1982, 1990). Other sites, such as the secondarysiteofManchan,alsoproducedmetalsandtextiles,butinmuchlowerquantityandqualitythanChan

Chan(Mackey1987:128;MackeyandKlymyshyn1990:211). Artisans, grouped in different work­shops, were probably stratified and supervised (JTopic 1990:156). In contrast, ceramic productionwas apparently concentrated at provincial sitessuchasPampadeBurros(Shimada1994:25;Sido­roff 2005:94; Tschauner 2001; Tschauner et al.1994). Most of these provincial sites operated in­dependently, without any control of productionby Chimú elites (Tschauner 2001:174, 211­212;Tschauner et al. 1994:378­380).2 Work organiza­tion outside the capital was also less hierarchical,and potters working at sites such as Pampa deBurros likely operated under a model of a “cor­porate group or a multi­family household unit ofspecialized potters, independently producing alarge quantity of small molded vessels for ex­change” (Tschauner 2009:288). Tschauner andcolleagues (1994:379) argue that “horizontal ex­change is the most likely alternative.”
Although Chimú ceramic production was notstate­controlled,andmanufactureanddistributionwere probably organized at the local level, it wasdesigned for mass­production. It is possible thatlocal leaders wished to control at least some partoftheproductionasthedistributionwasnolongeraimed at the elite, but at a wider group. Beingmass­produced, ceramics were not a status sym­bol in Chimú society (Donnan 1992:96;Tschauner 2009:277; Sidoroff 2005:88). Despitethe relatively low social status of Chimú pottersand the carelessness in production that can beobserved insome vessels,thereisa homogeneityin manufacturing techniques and iconographythat suggests the transmission of an ideologicalmessage(Mackey2000;Sidoroff2005:89).Someof ceramics and stirrup­spout bottles are of highquality,especiallythe fine blackware vessels,andwereprobably intendedformore prestigiousper­sons or elites. 

Technological Study using CT Scanning 

The CT Scan Method 
Thestudy of manufacturing tracesonthe interiorsurfaces of mold­made stirrup­spout bottles canhelp us reconstruct the various processes andstages involved in the making of these vessels.Nonetheless, the closed form of the bottles has generally inhibited scholars from observing suchtraces.Morerecently,theuseof medical imagingasananalyticalmethodhasprovided viewingac­cess to the interior of closed vessels. In compar­ison with X­ray radiography, which only allowsfor 2D images, the vessels considered for thisstudywereanalyzedusingcomputedtomography(or CT) scanning for the 3D reconstruction.
The earliest studies of ceramic manufacturingtechniques using X­ray radiography were per­formed in the 1940s (Digby 1948), and themethod continuesto be in usetoday (BeckettandConlogue 2010; Heck and Feldmüller 1990;Heinemann 1976; Leonard et al. 1993; Lima2010; Lima et al. 2011; Middleton 2005; Pavelet al. 2013, 2014; Purin 1980a, 1980b, 1983a,1983b, 1985; Vandiver and Tumosa 1995). Nev­ertheless,fortheanalysisof macro­tracesrelatingto the manufacturing technology of such a com­plex formasthestirrup­spoutbottle,CTscanningand its 3D results are noticeably more accurateand appropriate.
The vessel is scanned by X­rays inside the CTscanner. The information is then digitized andused to reconstruct the object in 3D. From this,sectionsacrossthevesselcanbemadetoexamine theinteriorinallitsdetails(Wauters2008,2014).This revolutionary method in the field of ceramicstudies allows very accurate results and can beused for the analysis of vessels from all periodsandregionsoftheworld(AndersonandFell1995;Applbaum and Applbaum 2005; Bouzakis et al.2011; Ghysels 2003; Harvig and Lynnerup 2012;Jansen et al. 2001; Middleton 2005; Robertson1997; Wauters 2008, 2014).
This study aims to deepen the technologicalunderstanding of Chimú stirrup­spout bottlesthrough the use of medical imaging to determinethe different stages of the chaîne opératoire of their manufacture. 
Vessel Analysis

16­slice scanner and at the University Hospitalsin Geneva with a Siemens Sensation 64­slice scanner. The resulting imageres provide crosssectionsofthe vessels and access totheir interior surfaces from all angles of view. About 20 to 30imagesofthesesectionsweresavedinJPEGfor­mat. During the creation of the images the soft­ware allowed us to see the ceramic vessels in opaque (Figure 2b) or transparent views (Figure2c). The interplay of these two possibilities canreveal many details. Transparent views providea kind of X­ray radiography but in three dimen­sions, while opaque vision gives a reconstructedimage of the object in all its details. Based on thestudy of these images it is possible to reconstructthe manufacturing processes used by Chimú pot­ters. The following section provides the resultsof the analysis of six of these vessels.
Vessel1.RMAH –Brussels,InventorynumberAAM 53.64. The chamber of this stirrup­spoutbottle has the form of a truncated cone (Figures2a­b). At the height of its shoulders, there aretwo conchshellsbetweenthecone andthestirruphandles.The stirrup handle is rounded and annu­lar, and the spout is straight.Asmall stair­shapedelement is present at the base of the spout. Twobreak lines at the base of the stirrup handles con­firm that the vessel has been restored. 
CT scan sections of the vessel indicate that it was manufactured with a total bivalve mold that producedthestirrup­spouthandleandthechamberinasinglepiece(Figure2c).Allpartsofthevessel,even the decorative conch shells, are hollow andadjoin respectively with the stirrup­spout handleand the chamber. A mold seam is present on theinterior surface. The seam is a mark in the clay,generally inthe formof aridgein relief, resultingfrom the junction of the two molded halves. It ismarked in the stirrup­spout handle and at the be­ginning of one of the conch shells. Mold­seamtraces are no longer visible in the chamber, partsof the conchs, and the spout. The Chimú pottercould have smoothed the seams inside the spoutbyinsertingafingerornarrowinstrumentthroughtheopening.Theinteriorseamsofthestirruphan­dles and chamber were smoothed by inserting asmallhandorinstrumentthroughtheopenbottomof the chamber. This part was closed last (Figure2d) to allow the potter to smooth accessible parts(in this case the chamber and the beginning of conchs). Potters smoothed these parts from theinside and outside in order to strengthen the ad­herence of the two halves.Atrace of a centripetalmovement of the clay on the bottom of the cham­ber suggests that the artisan stretched the pastetoward thecenter toclosethevessel. Lastly,he orshe smoothed the clay on the outer surface.
Vessel2.RMAH –Brussels,InventorynumberAAM 53.65. This bottle is the “twin” of the pre­vious bottle (Figures 2a, 3a). Both are identicalandhavethesamedimensionsbecausemoldtech­nologyallowed reproduction in series.The spoutis straight although its edge is slightly damaged.The small stair­shaped element at the base of thespout is larger than on its twin vessel indicatingthatthesetwosolidelements werenotnecessarilypart of the mold but could have been added later.
Thisvessel wasalsomade froma totalbivalve mold. The seam remains visible on the interior vessel surface in the stirrup handle and both ofthe conch shells, in contrast to the previous ex­emplar(Figure3c).Thecraftsmansmoothedonlythe mold marks on the interior surfaces of the chamber and the spout. Closure was achievedthrough a centripetal movement of the paste. Ahorizontal line visible at the base of the vessel indicates where additional clay was added andstretched to close the chamber (Figure 3d).
BecauseVessels1and2areidentical andhave the same manufacturing marks, they may havebeen produced usingthe same mold,and perhapseven in the same workshop.
Vessel3.RMAH –Brussels,InventorynumberAAM 5328. The chamber of this small bottle is shaped like a gourd (Figures 4a­b) indicated by afewdecorativeelementsinlowrelief.Itwasprob­ably made with a total bivalve mold (Figure 4c).The gourd neck was perhaps added later; a lineis clearly visible in the clay at the junction withthe chamber (Figure 4d). This additional step issurprising because the gourd neck could easilyhave been included in the mold. Moreover, aseam is present in its distal portion indicatingthat it was also mold­made. 
The interior surface of the chamber between the two holes of the stirrup handle is quite roughand irregular (Figure 4d). This is probably theresult of a coarse clay addition as reinforcement.On the rest of the interior chamber surface and thebeginningofthegourdhead,moldseamtraces

weresmoothedanderased.Thiswouldhavebeen possible by passing a small hand or instrumentthrough the vessel base, which was later closed.Because the potter did not have access to the in­side of the stirrup handle, there the seam of themold remains visible. The mold seam traces on the interior surface of the spout were smoothed.
Thebottomofthevesselwasclosedbyspread­ing clay outwards. The clay was then pressed in­wards, resulting in a thick clay blob at the center(Figure 4c).
Vessel4.RMAH –Brussels,InventorynumberAAM 39.149.The chamber of this vessel has the form of a monkey (Figure 5). The ears are on theside, the arch of the eyebrow is pronounced, thenose is flattened, and the mouth is prominent.The body ends with a tail folded over the leftthigh. A line is present around the hindquarter.This element is also present in other similar pots(see Vessel 5). The legs are large, stocky, andpoorly executed. The animal body is topped by arounded, annular stirrup­spout handle.The spoutis straight and annular with a slightly convergingedge.
The little monkey placed at the base of thespout is a common element in stirrup­spout bot­tles. Generally the tail of the monkey is foldedon the side that the animal faces. It is noteworthy that small monkeys on the shoulders of stirrup­spout vessels occurred during the final Phase VoftheprecedingMocheculture(Donnan andMc­Clelland 1999:Figure 5.49).
The bottle was built from different parts thatwere manufactured separately and then assem­bled.At least two different molds were used: one that included the body and head of the animal,the other the stirrup­spout handle. The legs ofthe animal were probably modeled separately.The monkey’s tail was also manufactured sepa­ratelyandthenattachedtoitshindquarters(Figure5b).This was not included in the mold because itdoesnotlieon therestofthebody.It issurprisingthat the tail is hollow. The aim was probably toreduce the weight of this element and thus keepit from breaking. Nevertheless, such a fully­en­closed hollow space risks expansion and explo­sion during firing.

It is clear that the animal tail on Vessel 4 was made separately and attached later to the body.In the case of Vessel 5, the tail was molded to­gether with the body of the animal, because it issolid and attached to the body. This process isfairly consistent with the fast and sloppy work ofthe manufacture of this vessel. Clay was addedto the base of one of the handle arms likely in aneffort to reinforce its attachment. The four legs,of variable shapes, were modeled separately andinserted onto the body. The insertion of these el­ementswasprobablythelaststepintheconstruc­tion of this vessel since they include no trace of modification or interior smoothing (Figure 6d).
It is compelling that Vessels 4 and 5, thoughsimilar in appearance, were made using differentmanufacturing processes. The CT scan imagesimmediately reveal which process the potterchose. While the different elements of Vessel 4 were pushed into each other, the different ele­ments of Vessel 5 were part of a single piecewithout connection joints between them.

Discussion 

The “Chaîne Opératoire” of the ChimúStirrup­Spout Bottle 
Withthe help ofthe CTscanandX­rayradiogra­phy images of sixteen Chimú stirrup­spout bot­tles, it was possible to identify different manu­facturing protocols. For the six stirrup­spoutbottles described in this article, andfor10 others,theuseofmolds wasthemostpopular technique.Indeed, the production of each of these vesselsrequired at least one mold.
Chimú stirrup­spout bottle manufacture con­sisted of the following sequence of steps:
1. Matrix and Mold Manufacture. The first step was matrix manufacture. The matrix wasmodeled by hand with all details appearing onthematrixpreciselyandclearlyenoughtotransfer to the mold. A line was incised on the perimeterof the surface of the mold and it was split intotwo parts.Amold could also be made by directlypressing clay onto objects such as fruits or veg­etables (Dunn 1979).
Chimú molds always consisted of two parts.Mowat (1988:5–7) reconstructed the mold man­ufacturing of a vessel from the matrix to the fin­ished product. She noted that the matrix did notalways have a base since it was never moldedbut it offered stability to the chamber, nor wasthe matrix necessarily fired. All the molds ob­servedbyMowat(1988)werefiredinanoxidizedatmosphere incontrast tothereducedatmospherecommonlyusedforfiringthestirrup­spoutbottlesthemselves. 
2. Vessel Manufacture. The technologicalanalysis of these vessels demonstrates the use ofat least one mold for the manufacture of each bottle. The potter applied the wet and flexibleclay to the two mold parts before assemblingthem. Two types of molding procedures wereused (Figure 8).
The first consisted of manufacturing the vari­ous parts of the vessel in different molds (seeVessel 4), the chamber and the stirrup­spout han­dle were made in two separate sets of molds. Insome cases, the holes intended for the stirrup­handle arms were already part of the mold (Don­nan 1992:Figure 8). The two handle arms werethen inserted into the holes in the chamber (Wauters 2008:Figure 21). Other elements thatwere notpartofthese molds fortechnicalreasonscould also be made in other molds or modeled and then added to the vessel (Table 1). The ob­servation of these elements and their junction isanotheradvantageof CTscanning,sincethey aremore often visible on complete vessels than onisolated vesselfragments.Inmy opinion,thevar­ious components were assembled in a specificorder. In fact, by leaving some elements to beadded last, the potters kept spaces open that al­lowed them access to the interior of the vessel. They were able to smooth and strengthen thejoints of the assembled elements, in the case ofthe spacesdestined to receivethelegs and stirruphandle arms of Vessel 4. 
The second molding procedure consisted ofmanufacturing the entire bottle in a single mold.This total mold included the stirrup­spout handle

and the chamber, but the base of the vessel wasexcluded for technical reasons.As a result, inter­nal reinforcement could be performed onlythrough the open base.
Insum,thescanningoftheceramicsfacilitatesthe identification of different manufacturingprocesses.Having accessto the inside of the bot­tle we can see if the handle arms were pushedinto the chamber, which indicates that these twoelements were separately mold­made and thenassembled according to Procedure 1 (Figure 5). 
In the other case, the junction between the cham­ber and the handle arms were part of a singlepiece originating from a single total mold thatwas used to construct the entire vessel accordingto procedure 2 (Figures 2–4, 6–7).
With regard to the spout, CT scan sectionssuggest that it was most often molded as part ofthe handle. Visual examination of the vessel ex­terior oftenshows aV­shapedline,asif the spoutwas inserted into the handle. This method of in­sertion was used during the Moche period, and it

seems that Chimú potters chose to continue toindicate this element from an external point ofview. Several CT scan sections show that the mold seam, remaining marked in the stirrup han­dle, extends a little into the base of the spout, in­dicating that these parts were mold­made as onepiece (Figure 4c). The seam in the spout wassmoothed by a finger or instrument passedthrough the opening of the spout.On several bot­tles,themoldseamwasnotsufficientlysmoothedandremained visible(Figure 4a). In addition, thestirrup­spout handle molds that I have examinedare composed of the stirrup handle and the spout(either for the mold ofonlythestirrup­spout han­dle or for a total mold comprising the chamberand the stirrup­spout handle).
Regardless of the type of procedure the potterchose for molding, he or she then passed a handor instrument through the open chamber base tosmooth the mold seam on the interior surface as far as possible. Foster (1948:357) explains thatsomemodernpottersofMichoacán,Mexico,whousetheverticaltwo­valvemold, smooththeinnerseam with a wet cloth. Because the potter did nothave access to the entire interior of the bottle,the interior seam remains visible in some places(especially beyond the curvature of the handlearms). Entering the vessel interior through thebase, the accessible parts were the chamber andthebeginning ofthe two stirruphandlearms.Thespout wasaccessiblethroughthetop ofthebottle.As explained above, molding the chamber andhandle separately had the advantage of creatingadditional access to the inner surfaces before as­sembling the different parts of the bottle.
The CT scan images allow us to appreciatethe various degrees of attention provided by thepotters at this stage. On some vessels the tracesleft on the interior surface by the mold techniqueare onlyvisible in inaccessible places (seeVessel4), while on others they can also be seen in someparts of the chamber (see Vessel 6). For bothmolding procedures, it is difficult to knowwhether the smoothing of the inner mold­seamwas performed when the vessel was still in themoldorafteritwasalreadyremoved.Itmayhavebeen preferable to do this while the vessel wasstill in the mold to avoid deformations and when the clay was still wet enough.
When the molding was completed, the piecedried in the mold. Once the clay began to dry, itwouldshrinkslightlyandcouldeasilyberemovedfrom the mold. At this time, the mold­seam onthe exterior surface was erased. The care taken in this step varies, however. In some cases, theseam is still perceptible by touch (by passing thehand over the surface of the vessel) or even bysight (Figures 4a, 7a; Lima 2010:plate 20).
To strengthen the vessel, potters sometimesapplied a little bit of clay to the external base ofthe stirrup handle arms, where the CT scan sec­tions show a thickening of the material (Figure5b). It seems that the Chimú artisans practicedthis extra step only on bottles whose stirrup han­dleandchamberweremoldedseparatelyandthenassembled. The junction was more fragile thanfor a vessel molded with a total two­valve mold,forwhichexternalreinforcementswereveryrare.

The last step in the ceramic manufacture wasthe closure of the chamber. Mowat (1988:9)speaks of a coiling closure as described by Don­nan (1965:123) for the chamber closing of theMoche stirrup­spout bottles. The coiling closureseems quite plausible but does not appear on theCT scan images. Indeed, on all Chimú pots thatwere analyzed the paste seems to be stretchedtowards the center and not coiled. Potters proba­bly added clay to the base of the chamber wallsandstretched it toward the center.Alineissome­times observable in this junction place. In thecenter of the base, the clay was therefore pushedinward, causing a clay blob, which remains visi­ble on the inner surface (Figure 3d).
3. Finishing and Firing. Decoration and paintelements were added last. The decoration was generally part of the mold although some ele­mentsmadefrommodeling,molding,orstampingcould be added to the vessel. Painting was onlyused for vessels fired in an oxidized atmosphere,whichwaslesscommonduringtheChimúperiod.Most of the ceramics were polished.
The last stage of the chaîne opératoire of stir­rup­spoutbottleproductionwasfiring.Itwasusu­ally performed in a reduced­oxygen atmosphere(Echallier 1984:20–21) and provided the charac­teristic black color of the Chimú ceramic.The re­turnoffiringinareducedatmosphere,anancestralfiring technique used by Cupisnique potters(1200–200B.C.),wasprobablyguidedbyitseaseofexecutionandtherelativetimesavedcomparedto firing in an oxidized atmosphere.According toDonnan (1992:123), this choice corresponds per­fectlytothedesiretospeedupthemassproductionof Chimú ceramics. Indeed, firing in a reducingatmosphere requires less control, and a greaternumber of vessels can be fired simultaneously.Time is also saved in the decoration, often madeby the sculptural form of the chamber or by adecoration in low relief that may already be partof the mold. Finally, no painting was required, incontrast to the meticulous work of the Moche fine­line painted vessels, for example.
Consequently, the manufacturing of Chimústirrup­spout bottles could have been performedby two types of artisans: specialists and non­spe­cialists (Costin 2007:279–282). Unskilled work­ers without special knowledge could perform themolding,drying,andthedecoration,whilemaster craftsmen dedicated themselves to the manufac­turing of the molds and the firing of the vessels(Arnold1999:66,Tschauner2001:223,Tschauner2006:184). 

Conclusion 

This technological analysis of 16complete Chimústirrup­spoutbottleshasshownthattheirmanufac­turing methods were standardized, consistent, andexpedient. The use of molding and technologicalinnovations that simplified production processesallowed Chimú potters to transition from an arti­sanalandspecializedproductioninheritedfromtheMoche to a semi­industrial production.
This analysis highlighted the use of two typesof molds for the production of Chimú stirrup­spout bottles: separate, modular molds for creat­ing the vessel in two or more pieces and the totaltwo­part mold. Onemayquestion theuse of thesetwo molding techniques. Were they linked to ge­ographical, chronological, or other differences?Orsimplyusedsimultaneouslydependingonpot­ters’ preference for one or the other technique?One of the answers can be found in the technical limitations of total two­part molds, which wereused only to manufacture small vessels (ca. 20cm height) (Arnold 1999:66–67). For larger ves­sels, the use of several molds was preferable, be­cause it would reduce the drying time for eachpart and the risk of damage to the piece. More­over, vessels with complex shapes could not bemadeusingatotalbivalve moldfortechnicalrea­sons. Finally, the use of several molds allowedfor thevariouselementsto be assembledinapar­ticular order that left open spaces for interior re­inforcementoperations (seeopenspaces destinedfor the legs of the monkey and handle arms ofVessel 4).
The use of molds suggests that Chimú pottersintended to produce these vessels in large quan­tities and standardized series. Some forms and iconographicthemeswereprobablymorepopularsince they were produced in larger numbers. Apopular pattern could be replicated in differentpostures using different molds. Variations aresometimes minimal and are identifiable by somesmall details (anatomical details or attributes,etc.). These variations could occur even for ves­sels manufactured using the same mold, by

addingdetails(moldedormodeledseparatelyandthen added) that made them slightly different.
There also were what we may call “fraternaltwin” vessels.Theseceramicsareidenticalatfirst sight and appear to have been produced with thesame mold, but their dimensions differ slightly.Therefore, many different molds represented thesame theme.Apossible explanation for this maybe that different workshops produced the samepopular form withdifferentmolds.Since ceramicproduction was concentrated in provincial sites,perhaps workshops copied vessels produced byothers workshops at the same, or a different, site.Anotherhypothesiswouldbethatthesamework­shopwantedtomanufacturea forminlargenum­bers. The use of different molds with the same form allowed more artisans to work on the same subject simultaneously, increasing productivity.Alternately,amoldcouldnotbeusedindefinitely,and eventually it had to be replaced with a newmold of the form. These scenarios can explainthe variation in dimensions between ceramics of identical appearance.
The number of stirrup­spout bottle molds thathave survived to this day is quite limited com­pared to the amount of recovered vessels. Thenumber of vessels identical in form and dimen­sions that were likely produced in series is alsolimited. It is difficult to identify and locate exactreplicas of ceramics and usually only two, three,or at most four identical pots are known. Thereare a number of possible scenarios that may ex­plain why the quantity of identical vessels is solimited today. The most obvious one is the de­structionand thedispersalofceramics.Mostves­sels were destroyed over time, especially thosenot kept in closed or protected contexts, such astombs. Others were damaged or destroyed bylooting, because looters keep only ceramics thatarejudgedthemostaestheticandthusmosteasilymarketable. For those pieces that have survived,the problem is dispersal. Ceramics are stored inmuseums orprivate collectionsaround theworld,often far from their original location, making itvery difficult to reconstitute series. Nonetheless,it would be illogical to think that potters weremaking molds to produce only a small numberof identical pieces. Given the complexity of themanufacturing process revealed by this research,it is plausible that stirrup­spout bottles of similar forms were produced in large quantities.
Thetechnologicaltraditionofthestirrup­spoutbottlebeganduringtheEarlyHorizon,intensifiedduring the Moche period, became more industri­alized during the Chimú period, and continuedon the northern coast of Peru until the SpanishConquest.Although some technological changescan be observed (such as the use of the two­partmoldforthestirrup­spouthandleorthetotaltwo­part mold), Chimú stirrup­spout vessels displaymany manufacturing similarities with other cul­tures in the region. Under the advent of their em­pire, Chimúpotters transformedthestirrup­spoutbottle production, inherited from an ancestralmanufacturing complex, into a semi­industrialprocessthatwasfocusedonproducinglargequan­tities of vessels outside the craft production cen­ters of the Chimú capital.
