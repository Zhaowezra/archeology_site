FORMATIVE ADAPTATIONS, DIET, AND ORAL HEALTH IN THE AZAPA VALLEY OF NORTHWEST CHILE 
James T. Watson, Ivan Munoz Ovalle, and Bernardo T. Arriaza 

Indicators of oral health were recorded in a sample of 200 Formative period ( 1500 B. C.-A.D. 500) skeletons from archae­olof?ical sites located in the Lower Azapa Valley of northwest Chile. This period represents a major shift in subsistence stratef?ies in the Atacama Desert, as coastal groups adopted agriculture and moved deeper into the valley. Frequencies of caries and antemortem tooth loss were compared between site locations (coast vs. valley) and by archaeological phase (early vs. late) to interpret the degree to which these incipient agriculturalists were reliant on domesticated resources. Over­all.frequencies of caries ( 11. 9 percent) and tooth loss ( 11.6 percent) are somewhat higher than for other prehistoric groups practicinf? a mixed subsistence stratef?y. However, residents of the interior valley exhibited significantly more dental decay and tooth loss than those along the coast. Our results identify that although the Formative period residents of the Lower Azapa Valley practiced a mixed subsistence strategy, the degree of reliance on agricultural production differed 
between the coast and the valley. We propose that these differential patterns in oral health are tied to local investment, adaptive cycles, and niche construction.

En general, las frecuencias de caries ( 11,9 percent) y de perdida de dientes ( 11,6 percent) son ligeramente mas elevadas en comparaci6n a otros grupos que practican una estrategia de subsistencia mixta.

one of the most profound changes in human behav­ior during the last 10,000 years. Its impacts on human health are important to understand because they offer insights into the etiology and distribu­tion of many modem diseases. The global effects of subsistence changes to human health have been well documented from numerous skeletal samples (see Cohen and Armelagos 1984; Cohen and Crane­Kramer 2007; Larsen 2000; and Steckel and Rose 2002 for synthetic treatments). Archaeological research has shown that, in general, the shift to agriculture caused a decline in human health (Cohen and Armelagos 1984). The causes of this decline relate to two broad phenomena: larger sedentary populations and changes in subsistence. Larger sedentary populations created poor sanitary conditions, which promoted the spread of com­municable diseases (Goodman et al. 1984; Larsen 1997, 2000, 2002). Changes in subsistence activi­ties, dietary breadth, and diet composition caused more dental disease and created nutritional inade­quacies (Nelson et al. 1994; Steckel et al. 2002). 
Regionally specific changes in dietary compo­sition associated with the "Neolithic Revolution" (Childe 1925) often have the first measurable impact on the human body (detectable in skeletal remains). Consumption of mechanically processed and carbohydrate-rich domesticated cultigens, which often stick to grooves and fissures on tooth surfaces and between teeth and gums, increases oral bacterial loads and consequently the incidence of oral disease (Hillson 2001, 2002; Larsen 1981, I 995). As a result, agriculturalists tend to have ele­vated rates of dental decay, malocclusion, and prob­lems associated with nutrition during enamel formation ( amelogenesis) when compared with for­aging societies (Bridges 1989; Larsen 1995; Turner I979). An associated decrease in occlusal surface wear additionally results in plaque buildup, stabi­lizing bacterial colonization and increasing poten­tials for cariogenesis and periodontitis (Hillson 2001). 
Numerous bioarchaeological case studies have documented a significant difference in the fre­quency of caries between subsistence strategies (foragers vs. agriculturalists) and an increase over time-from the Paleolithic/ Archaic to the Neolithic/Formative period (see Turner 1979 for a global perspective). A few exceptions to this pat­tern have been identified, such as the consumption of wild tubers in Southeast Asia (Tayles et al. 2000) and succulents in the North American desert west (Hartnady and Rose 1991; Watson 2008). These examples highlight the importance of considering human adaptations and their consequences under "local" ecological circumstances, considering the constraints and variability available to groups under different environmental and technological condi­tions in prehistory. The prehistoric residents of the Lower Azapa Valley had access to three diverse local environmental zones (coast, marsh, and river valley) when cultigens and farming technology arrived in the area prior to ca. 1500 B.C. Our pri­mary goal in this article is to examine oral health indicators in Formative period (1500 B.C.-A.D. 500) skeletal samples from the Lower Azapa Val­ley to interpret the degree to which these incipient agriculturalists utilized the various wild and domes­ticated resources available. 
Formative Period In The Lower Azapa Valley 
The Formative period ( 1500 B.C.-A.D. 500) in the Lower Azapa Valley presents the first evidence for settlement away from the coast-in the valley interior-and the beginning of local agricultural investment. The skeletal samples analyzed in this study were recovered from two groups of Forma­tive period sites located in the Lower Azapa Valley (Figure I). Coastal sites (Playa Miller-7, Quiani­7) are located directly adjacent to the shoreline and in close proximity to the marshy mouth of the San Jose River (Focacci 1974, 1980). Valley sites (Azapa-I4, Azapa-70, Azapa-71, Azapa-75, and Azapa-115) are located close to each other on Pleis­tocene benches overlooking the San Jose River floodplain approximately 12.5 km from the coast (Focacci 1980; Focacci and Erices 1972-1973; Santoro 1980a, 1980b). 
Material culture recovered from these sites is similar in the broader sense that cul ti gens and items representing agricultural technology are present in both areas (Rivera I 984, I 991 ). Differences are present, but these are minor compared to the clear impact that the arrival of agriculture had on sub­sistence strategy, as observed in the archaeobotan­ical record of these sites (Munoz 2004). Subtle differences in artifact assemblages separate the For­mative period in the Lower Azapa Valley into early and late archaeological phases, but these are largely

early phase (1500-500 B.C.) is termed Faldas de 
Morro at coastal sites and Azapa at valley sites 
(Focacci 1980; Santoro I 980b ). The late phase (500 
B.C.-A.D. 500) is termed El Laucho at coastal sites 
and Alto Ramirez at valley sites (Focacci 1974; 
Santoro l 980b ). 
Early theories about the arrival of cultigens and 
agricultural technology in the Lower Azapa Valley 
centered on demic diffusion (Kelley et al. 1991; 
Kolata 1993; Munoz 1989; Rivera 1984, 1991;

Santoro l 980a, l 980b; Varela and Cocilovo 2002). Researchers suggested that, despite evidence for earlier contact, the Formative period represents the first migration of altiplano farmers down the val­ley to settle with an existing technology, including domesticated camelids and a reliance on agricul­ture. Pastoralism and the cultivation of quinoa, manioc, com, beans, squash, and hot chilies (aji) represent a drastic change in dietary base from the previous marine and terrestrial foraging base of the Chinchorro culture (Munoz 2004). However, evi­dence from both coastal and valley sites indicates that a mixed subsistence strategy was practiced for the duration of the Formative period in the Lower Azapa Valley (Munoz 2004; Santoro 1980a). 
Recent work has demonstrated a cultural and biological continuity that connects the earliest res­idents in the area to subsequent populations that spread up the valley (Cassman 1997; Munizaga 1964, 1974, 1980; Sutter 1997, 2006; Sutter and Mertz 2004 ). Of particular relevance to this study is the exhaustive work of Sutter ( 1997, 2000, 2006; Sutter and Mertz 2004), who examined a suite of inheritable discrete dental traits in the same skele­tal samples considered here and documented close genetic relationships between groups living at both coastal and valley sites. He further demonstrated that these relationships continued over time, extending from Archaic period Chinchorro foragers to later post-Tiwanaku settlements in the Lower Azapa Valley. Sutter's findings are additionally sig­nificant to this study because they allow us to con­sider differences in oral health across biologically related groups, a factor that could otherwise facil-

itate genetically based differences in susceptibility to oral diseases (Hillson 2002). 
Subsistence 
Archaic period Chinchorro groups comprised approximately 6,000 years of stable marine and terrestrial foraging (Arriaza 1994, 1995). Chin­chorro settlements flourished along the coast of northern Chile and southern Peru, largely relying on the rich biotic diversity of marine resources available at settlement's edge. A diet apparently low in the consumption of carbohydrates is corrobo­rated by Kelley et al. (1991), who found only five carious teeth out of 823 (.6 percent caries rate) at the site of Morro-I. The introduction of domesti­cated cultigens and animals and agricultural and pastoral technology prior to the beginning of the Formative period therefore represents a major shift in subsistence strategy and lifestyle from the pre­vious inhabitants of the area. 
Some continuity can be observed in the contin­ued importance of marine resources to residents of the Lower Azapa Valley (Munoz 2004 ). Coastal res­idents continued to rely heavily on the ocean as evi­denced by large shell middens, abundant remains of sea mammals, and artifact assemblages largely based in marine foraging technology. These mate­rial remains are complemented by ceramics and plant processing technology as well (Munoz 2004). Marine resources continued to be exploited through later occupations along the coast (Munoz 1993; Munoz and Focacci 1985). Domesticated animals were also exploited to some extent by coastal res­idents. Focacci (1974) documents an immense diversity of grave offerings at the site of Playa Miller-7, including tools made from camel bones as well as sea lion and birds. 
Formative period sites from the valley also pro­duced sizable quantities of marine fauna! remains, including various species of fish, shellfish, and sea mammals, in addition to artifacts associated with marine foraging (Munoz 2004). Excavation at Tumulus 6 at the site of Azapa-70 revealed a vari­ety of funerary objects that reflected a direct rela­tionship with marine foraging, such as bone harpoons, loincloths, and fishing nets (Munoz 1989). Similar discoveries during excavations at Azapa-115 separated closely interred individuals dating from the terminal Formative period and the beginning of the Media period-the subsequent period defined by influence from Tiwanaku 
(Munoz 1995-1996). Grave accompaniments 
among the Formative period burials reflected ties 
to coastal foraging and perhaps a "coastal" iden­tity, vs. Tiwanaku-influenced design styles in pot­tery and textiles among the early Medio period burials (Munoz 1995-1996). 
The importance of marine resources in the diet of Formative period valley residents was similarly demonstrated using stable isotopes in a sample of seven mummies recovered from the site of Azapa­75 (Aufderheide et al. 2002). The primary conclu-• sions of the study are that pulmonary diseases were one of the major causes of death in these groups, and the authors specifically attribute investment in agropastoralism in the valley interior as a causative agent compared to groups along the coast (Aufder­heide et al. 2002). Aufderheide et al. (2002) addi­tionally used nitrogen isotopes from bone collagen to determine that 52 percent of dietary protein was contributed by marine meat. The remaining protein was contributed by terrestrial meat sources, maize, and other plants (Aufderheide et al. 2002). These findings provide a marked contrast to the bone iso­tope ratios of earlier Chinchorro samples, which estimated that 80 to 90 percent of the diet was com­posed of marine resources (Aufderheide et al. 1993). They also note that coprolites of the valley residents lacked evidence for fish tapeworms com­mon among coastal groups and therefore suggest that they were cooking the marine foods they con­sumed, a significant difference in food processing compared to coastal groups. 
Diverse assemblages of plant remains recov­ered from Formative period sites, both wild and domesticated, are equally ubiquitous in coastal and valley locations (Belmonte 1998; Belmonte et al. 1988; Erices 1975; Munoz 1981; Rivera 1977). Erices (1975) and Focacci (1974) have identified a mix of wild and domesticated flora from Playa Miller-7. Erices ( 1975) documents similar assem­blages from later Medio (A.D. 390-1000) and Desarrollo Lo1.:al (ca. A.D. 1200) period contexts at sites Azapa-6 and Playa Miller-4, respectively. Munoz (1981) and Rivera (1977) examined plant remains from funerary contexts and coprolites from four Formative period valley sites (Azapa-12, -70, -83, and -122) to identify maize consumption in addition to a variety of wild flora. Belmonte ( 1998) found significant continuity in the plants exploited

He also includes a botanical inventory of the local wild species in the coastal valleys of Arica. Table 1 demonstrates the variety of plants recov­ered from Formative period contexts in two con­temporaneous sites in the Lower Azapa Valley and identifies a similarity in their distribution between coast and valley. 
In their study of mummies from Azapa-75, Aufderheide et al. (2002) used carbon isotope ratios to estimate that they likely consumed a mixed diet of approximately 64 percent nonmaize terrestrial plants, including both wild and domesticated resources (Aufderheide et al. 2002). Radiocarbon dates run on soft tissue from three individuals in the sample returned dates ranging from 351 B.C. to A.D. 504, which spans the Alto Ramirez phase (Aufderheide et al. 2002). The combination of radiocarbon dates, isotopic analyses, and health ;assessments indicates that although the investment in agropastoralism was certainly affecting the health of these individuals, the diet still consisted of a mix of terrestrial and marine resources and both wild and domesticated species. This pattern lasted through the end of the Formative period. 
Burial 
Concomitant with changes in subsistence, a marked shift in burial practices also occurred in the area just prior to the Formative period. Various mum-mification practices common to the Archaic period residents of the coast cease (Arriaza 1995), and a new form of constructing social identity through, and for, the dead begins with the construction of tumuli (tumulos)-layered earthen burial mounds (Focacci 1980; Munoz 1989, 1995-1996, 2004). These represent major technological and ideolog­ical changes and likely mark a significant social transition in the Lower Azapa Valley.

Continuity along the coast can be observed in the shared space used for disposal of the dead through time (Arriaza and Standen 2008). Forma­tive period sites on the coast are cemeteries located on approximately 5 km of beach south of where the San Jose River empties into the Pacific. Playa Miller-7 is a densely packed cemetery that dates to the late phase stretched along the colluvial bench 
just above the beach (Focacci 1974). Quiani-7 is a small cemetery that dates to the early phase located at the base of a rocky precipice south of Playa Miller. Although limited materials were recovered from this cemetery, evidence suggests that these burials represent a transition between Archaic for­aging and Formative agropastoralism along the coast. In addition, 11 burials from the contempo­raneous site of Camarones-15 (located on the coast at the adjacent river mouth to the south) were added to bolster the limited number of remains from the early phase on the coast. Burial patterns at all of these sites include individual tombs in a variety of positions and orientations with an assortment of

grave accompaniments. Artifacts varied consider ­
ably, from fishing hooks of bone and copper to pot­
tery and domesticated cultigens. The patterns 
observed in these cemeteries, including body treat­
ment and associated artifacts, are similar to those 
encountered in Formative period sites deeper in the 
Azapa Valley. 
The Formative period sites located in the Azapa 
Valley are burial locations characterized by tumuli, 
the burial mounds of varying size located on the 
flu vial terraces adjacent to the San Jose River. They 
all share similarities in construction, consisting of 
burials covered by layers of vegetal material, river 
stones, and sediment (Munoz 2004). Most of the 
plants used in the construction of these layers are 
from local wild species commonly found at local­
ized marshy areas created by the river. The con­
struction layers do not appear to occur in any 
particular order, however. Artifacts recovered from 
within the layers include fragments of pottery and 
textiles, lithic debitage, ground stone, and seashells. 
Burials within the tumuli are generally either 
complete individuals, discrete burials of several 
crania, or incomplete individuals; some were dis­
turbed, and others were redeposited with grave 
offerings. There are no apparent patterns to burial 
position or orientation. The type and quantity of 
grave goods and offerings also vary considerably, 
from diverse textile objects and ceramic urns, to 
fishing and foraging tools, to agricultural tools and 
products (Munoz 2004). Many individuals com­
pletely lack evidence for associated funerary 
deposits. The majority of offerings found in the con­
structed layers of the tumuli consist of agricultural 
products, including corncobs, squash, and chili, 
and likely reflect the importance of production to 
these groups. Radiocarbon dates recovered from 
tumuli indicate centuries of contiguous use and 
reuse in their construction (Munoz 2004). 
The skeletal samples considered here represent approximately 2,000 years of occupation of the Lower Azapa Valley during the Formative period. These sites embody a period when domesticated cultigens and animals are incorporated into exist­ing local subsistence strategies. Domesticates and agropastoral technology allow some groups to move deeper into the valley to exploit additional niches. Dependence on these resources becomes more important among subsequent groups in the area. These skeletal samples provide the opportu­
nity to examine the degree to which cultigens and agricultural investment were relied upon, between the coast and the valley and over the course of the Formative period. 
Materials 
The skeletal samples analyzed in this study are pan 
of the osteological collection held in repository a1 
the Universidad de Tarapaca Museo Arqueol6gicc 
San Miguel de Azapa, Chile. We examined uppe1 
and lower dental segments from crania of200 adull 
individuals (age> 15) from seven Formative perioc 
sites (Table 2) in the Lower Azapa Valley, and one 
contemporaneous site from the Camarones Valle) 
coast, in northwest Chile. Frequencies of carie 
and antemortem tooth loss (AMTL) are consid· 
ered by location and archaeological phase to loo 
for differential patterns in resource dependencE 
among these incipient agriculturalists. Table 2 di· 
plays the composition of the study sample from thE 
Lower Azapa Valley. The preservation of dentitior 
in the sample is generally good, however, a num 
ber of individuals are missing teeth lost post 
mortem, a pattern that differentially affectec 
anterior teeth to a greater extent than the posterio1 
teeth. 
Sex was estimated for individuals in the samph 
by examining standard macroscopic aspects of tht 
pelvis and/or cranium (B uikstra and Ubelake 
1994). The sample includes relatively even num 
bers of males (n = 101) and females (n = 99), anc 
although they are not evenly distributed within site: 
(see Table 2), chi-square tests identify that wher 
samples are pooled the mean number of males anc 
females does not differ significantly between coas 
and valley locations (x2= .71; df =I; p = .39) o 
between early and late archaeological phases (x2 = 
.18;df=l;p=.67). 
Age was estimated for the sample using denta eruption (Ubelaker 1978) and relative rates of den· tal attrition following generalized standards estab­lished by Broth well ( 1989), epiphysis fusion, cranial suture closure, and macroscopic degenerative changes in the pubic symphysis following standards established by Buikstra and Ubelaker (1994). The sample was classified into four ordinal, nine-year age cohorts (15-24, n = 49; 25-34, n = 58; 35-44, n = 71;45-54, n = 22), resulting in a skewed distribu­tion of individuals by age.

individuals in the sample (35.5percent) died between the third and fourth decade of life. The smallest por­tion of individuals (11 percent) represents the final decades of life. Chi-square tests demonstrate that there are more older individuals in the samples from the coastal sites (x2 = 17.13;df= 3;p = .01) but that the mean number of individuals does not differ sig­nificantly between early and late archaeological phases (x2 = .48; df= 3;p = .92) . Mean ages of the samples are displayed by site in Table 2. 
The age structure of skeletal samples is an important consideration, especially when measur­ing caries and tooth loss because they are both age­progressive diseases and therefore cannot be compared across samples or variables with differ­ent age structures (Hillson 2001 ). Results of the chi­square tests identify that although age does not differ significantly between archaeological phases, it could significantly affect comparisons of oral pathology between coast and valley samples. The frequencies of both caries and AMTL observed within the coastal sample are generally low even among the oldest individuals in the sample. Ulti­mately, tooth loss was not found to be significantly impacted when age was controlled for in our sub­sequent analyses. 
Methods 
Although a suite of oral health indicators can be observed in archaeological populations, here we chose to focus on the frequency of dental caries and antemortem tooth loss because these represent comparable quantitative measures that have been documented to commonly correlate with differing subsistence strategies. Caries are the result of the focalized demineralization of dental hard tissues (i.e., enamel, dentin, and cementum) by acid pro­

duced from bacterial fermentation of carbohydrates (Hillson 2002;Larsen 1995) . AMTL has numer­ous etiologies and can result from extreme attrition, caries, trauma, or periodontal disease (Hillson 
2002). Although the specific link between caries prevalence and tooth loss in archaeological popu­lations is not well understood, it is important to deal with both phenomena together because they are minimally indicative of a certain level of dental stress in a population (Hillson 2001). It is also important to adjust caries rates for teeth lost dur­ing life-although there is no agreement on the method (Brothwell 1989;Erda! and Duyar 1999; Hillson 2001;Lukacs 1992, 1995) . 
Dental data were recorded on every individual in the skeletal sample with at least one dental seg­ment present. These data included the number and type of observed dental segments per individual (tooth and/or alveolar portion), condition of each dental segment (present or lost, ante-or post­mortem), number of caries per tooth, and nature and location of the carious lesion following Moore and Corbett (1971) . Carious lesions were recorded under strong light and only where decay of the tooth surface(s) orroot(s) was observed, and, when necessary, a magnifying glass and dental probe were utilized to aid in identification. A carious lesion was recorded only when demineralization had formed a distinct cavity in the tooth. The preser­vation of the skeletal remains in these samples is excellent and provides accurate identification of carious lesions. Antemortem tooth loss was recorded only when partial or complete alveolar resorption was observed. Problems can arise with this method in assessing AMTL because teeth lost near or at the time of death will be recorded as post­mortem loss, but Lukacs ( 1995) suggests that prob­lems in the interpretation of AMTL due to this type

of error are likely negligible. In addition, we recorded teeth with noncarious pulp exposure when the pulp cavity was open (no secondary dentin pre­sent) but lacked evidence of surrounding carious decay (Moore and Corbett 1971 ). N oncarious pulp exposure most commonly results from extreme wear of the occlusal surface or damage (trauma) to the tooth crown, can also contribute to tooth loss (Hillson 2002), and is therefore important to con­sider when calculating caries frequencies (Lukacs 1996). 
We employ standardized frequency calculations for caries and AMTL to assess the sample between variables (Buikstra and Ubelaker 1994; Lukacs 1989, 1995). Table 3 displays caries andAMTL fre­quencies for the total sample and by site location and archaeological phase. The prevalence provides information about the frequency of individuals within the sample with either pathology and is cal­culated by dividing the number of individuals affected with at least one pathological expression by the total number of individuals for each group­ing. The rate describes the observed percentage of teeth or alveolar segments affected and provides information on the degree to which dental segments are pathological in each group. This calculation is free of bias from missing elements and is calcu­lated by dividing the number of pathological teeth or alveolar segments by the total number of loca­tions observed. The observed rate was corrected using Lukacs's (1995) "Corrected Caries Rate" to account for tooth loss. 
In order to facilitate the comparison of pathol­ogy rates between variables and additionally con­trol for age in the analysis, we followed the example of Pechenkina et al. (2002) and used general lin­ear modeling analysis (Gill 2001) with age as the covariate and location and phase as grouping fac­tors. General linear modeling analysis can be employed to evaluate differences among samples with dissimilar age structures (Pechenkina et al. 2002). In addition to comparisons of pathology fre­quencies, we compared caries and tooth loss by individual dental segments and anterior vs. poste­rior dentition to identify if particular teeth or groups of teeth are more affected than others. We also com­pared sites of caries initiation on the tooth surface to identify if differences exist in the types of cari­ous lesions within the sample. Chi-square and independent-samples t-tests were used to test caries and tooth loss by segment, tooth groups, and initi­ation site between site locations and archaeologi­cal phases. All statistical tests were performed using the SPSS 14.0 for Windows program (Statistical Package for Social Sciences, Chicago). 
Results 
The frequencies of caries (11.9 percent) and ante­mortem tooth loss ( 11.6 percent) calculated from Formative period samples from the Lower Azapa Valley are somewhat elevated compared to other, prehistoric groups practicing a mixed subsistence strategy (Turner 1979). However, when each marker is considered by location and archaeolog­ical phase the frequencies vary considerably (Table 3, Figure 2a-b ). Significant covariance was observed with age for both caries and tooth loss (Table 4 ). Significant differences were found between sites located on the coast and those located in the valley interior (p< .05). Caries were rare among coastal residents compared to their valley counterparts, who display an observed rate almost five times greater (Tables 3-4, Figure 2a). The rate of tooth loss was also greater among valley resi­
dents (Tables 3-4, Figure 2b ). 
Although there appears to be a significant increase in caries from the early to late phase of the Formative period in the Lower Azapa Valley (Table 3), the burden of oral disease observed among indi­viduals is extremely variable, and therefore the dif­ference is nonsignificant (Table 4). The rate of antemortem tooth loss also remained constant between the early and late phases. It is possible that the limited sample size from valley sites dating to the early phase (n 5) may affect these results. Nei­

ther caries nor tooth loss demonstrated a signifi­cant location-phase interaction, which indicates that these patterns preserve when considering the results by location between phases or vice versa (Table 4). 
Overall, the number of caries varied signifi­cantly by individual tooth and between anterior and posterior dentitions (Figure 3a). The high number of anterior teeth lost postmortem, particularly incisors, certainly plays a major role in the distri­bution of caries between front and back teeth. The frequencies, however, which are free of bias from missing data, identify a significantly higher pro­portion of carious teeth in the posterior (14.7 per-

Evidence for tooth loss during life appears to be 
more evenly distributed across the dentition (Fig­ure 3b ). Overall, slightly more posterior teeth (18.5 percent) were lost on average compared to anterior teeth ( 16 percent), but these difference are not sta­tistically significant (t=-.99; df= 30;p = .33). Indi­viduals from the coast lost more anterior teeth ( 16.8 percent) compared to posterior teeth ( 14.8 percent), but the difference is also not significant (t = .44; df 
= 30; p = .66). Individuals from valley sites, how­ever, demonstrate a significantly higher proportion of posterior tooth loss (20.9 percent) on average compared to anterior teeth (15.8 percent [t=-2.55; df= 30; p = .02]). No statistically significant dif­ferences are observed in proportions of anterior vs. posterior tooth loss between archaeological phases in the sample. 
Occlusal surface (38.3 percent) and interproxi­mal (24.5 percent) caries constitute the majority of the carious lesions on teeth in the Lower Azapa Val­ley. Large caries (14.9 percent)-lesions for which no site of initiation could be identified-are the

third most frequent type of lesion observed in the sample, followed by noncarious pulp exposure 
(12.4 percent). Smaller proportions of cervical ( 6.4 percent), smooth surface (2.8 percent), and root(. 7 percent) caries are also present in the sample. 
Since caries frequencies were found to differ significantly between coastal and valley sites, we additionally compared surfaces of caries initiation by site location to gain additional information on the dietary effects of caries etiology in the sample (see Figure 4). The overwhelming majority of lesions recorded on teeth from coastal sites com­prise nearly equal proportions of occlusal surface caries ( 44.1 percent) and noncarious pulp expo­sure (35.6 percent). This pattern stands in stark contrast to lesions recorded on teeth from valley sites, which include large proportions of occlusal surface (36.8 percent), interproximal (27.4 per­cent), and large (17 percent) caries. Noncarious pulp exposure was observed on a very small per­centage of teeth (6.3 percent) from sites in the val­ley. As such, there are significant differences not only in the frequencies of caries between coast and valley sites but additionally in the surface of origin of these lesions.

fisher-foragers to the subsequent Formative period incipient agriculturalists in the same samples exam­ined here. This pathology can result from chronic ear infections and is largely associated with marine foraging and subsistence-related diving in cold water (Okumura et al. 2007). Approximately 50 percent of the individuals observed from Camarones-15, Quiani-7, and Playa Miller-7 and 20 percent of the individuals from Azapa-14 and Azapa-70 exhibited EAE (Standen et al. 1997). Standen and her colleagues (1997) suggest that the Formative period groups in the Lower Azapa Val­ley increased investment in marine resources as a mechanism to supplement their agricultural sub­sistence base. 
Fewer caries and less tooth loss suggest that for­aging likely continued to be more important than agropastoral investment among coastal residents (Table 4, Figure 2a-b ). These data complement the conclusions of Standen and her colleagues ( 1997) for the coastal sites but appear to be contradictory for the valley sites. The higher frequency of caries and tooth loss suggests a heavy investment in agri­cultural production in particular among valley res­idents. The oral health data identify a clear separation of the Formative period sample by local­ity. Given the high incidence of EAE at inland For­mative sites, it is plausible that either some coastal residents were interred in valley cemeteries or some valley residents were dedicated to harvesting marine resources for the community. Given that almost one-quarter of the valley residents exhibit diving-related pathology, it appears more likely that this is evidence for subsistence specialization within valley communities. 

Proximity to the coast not only was an advan­tage but also likely constrained the Formative period residents from moving farther into the val­ley until they had fully mastered agropastoralism. Llagostera ( 1989) envisions a similar progressive process for the Archaic period Chinchorro. He sug­gests that the ability to forage in this area was the result of sequential successes at mastering the mul­tiple dimensions of accessing the variety of resources available. The same was likely true as cultigens, domesticated animals, and new tech­nologies spread down the valleys and along the Andean coast. Coastal residents adopted and slowly began to master these different dimensions within their existing worldview, altering it as they mas­tered each new element. Evidence for this process comes from the presence of early cultigens at late Archaic sites along the coast (Focacci 197 4, 1980) and the continued reliance on marine resources at Formative period sites in the valley (Munoz 2004). At the very least, marine resources would have pro­vided an ideal buffer against the uncertainties of mastering agricultural production. Given the cli­matic instability inherent in the eastern Pacific, it is also plausible that the reverse was true as well, whereby agriculture provided a buffer for fluctua­tions in marine resources (Arriaza et al. 2001). 
The fact that frequencies of oral health indica­tors do not differ between archaeological phases in the sample (Table 4) could imply that location­specific investment adaptations began as early as

the arrival of cultigens in the area and remained sta­ble for the duration of the Formative period in the Lower Azapa Valley. The data indicate that although a mixed subsistence economy was employed at both locations, each group placed greater invest­ment in those resources that were immediately available. Coastal residents continued and perhaps expanded their exploitation of marine resources, while valley residents expanded their investment in cultivation and pastoralism along the San Jose River. These represent the beginnings of "imbed­ded" strategies that continued until the arrival of the Spanish in the region. Additionally, if our appli­cation of Llagostera's model to agropastoral adap­tation in the Lower Azapa Valley is an accurate description of the cultural processes involved, then the earliest groups to move farther up the river had already mastered some portion of agricultural pro­duction. 
Higher rates of caries and tooth loss observed among inland inhabitants are not likely due to increased access to cariogenic wild plants. There are very few wild plant species in the Lower Azapa Valley that are as equally cariogenic as the intro­duced cultigens such as maize, potatoes, manioc, and beans (see Table 1). Most are weedy or seedy plants with low sugar content. These same plants were recovered in similar contexts from both coastal and valley sites, therefore reinforcing the fact that they were equally available to constitute part of the diet at both locations. With evidence for use of domesticated cultigens, there is no reason to think that coastal residents experienced more tooth decay compared to their Archaic predecessors yet less than contemporaneous valley residents due to an increase in the exploitation of only wild resources. Munoz (1989, 2004) recognizes the use of both wild cane and maize stalks in the con­struction of layers in several Formative period bur­ial mounds in the valley interior, suggesting their relatively equal ubiquity. 
The loss of more posterior teeth among valley residents is additionally indicative of an increase in the consumption of carbohydrates and a softer, more processed diet associated with agriculture. Some researchers would be inclined to attribute this differential pattern to differences in tooth wear between coastal and valley groups. Often foraging groups exhibit greater anterior wear and lose more teeth to extreme attrition and exposure of the pulp cavity (Molnar 1971; Smith 1984). With decreases in overall rates of occlusal surface wear, foodstuffs are more likely to stick to grooves and fissures of the posterior teeth and create ideal circumstances for caries development (Larsen 2002; Lukacs 1989). These patterns of tooth Joss mirror those observed by Kelley et al. (1991) in earlier Chin­chorro skeletal samples. However, tooth loss among the samples here is generally similar, and valley res­idents lost the same frequency of anterior teeth as their coastal counterparts. In a related study, we also failed to find any significant differences in overall , attrition rates between coastal and valley sites (Wat­son et al. 2011). The loss of more posterior teeth at valley sites likely results from greater consumption of carbohydrates and caries development and tends to mirror the patterns observed in later fully agriculture-dependent groups in the area (Kelley et al. 1991). 
Differences observed in the locations of caries initiation between coastal and valley samples also reflect diversity in subsistence strategy and dietary base. Although both groups display similar pro­portions of occlusal surface caries, the coastal sam­ple contains an almost equal proportion of teeth exhibiting noncarious pulp exposure, which likely results from wear and chipping of the crown (Wat­son et al. 2011). The remaining majority of caries in the valley sample reflect initiation sites that result from foodstuffs attaching to or becoming lodged along the remaining surfaces of the tooth, a pattern more common among agricultural groups (Hillson 2002). 
The oral health data presented here demonstrate that although Formative period groups residing in the Lower Azapa Valley practiced a mixed subsis­tence strategy, they also maintained clear internal differences in dietary base between coastal sites and valley locations. Caries and tooth loss among For­mative period coastal groups are higher than those observed among the Chinchorro (Kelley et al. 1991 ), their dedicated Archaic foraging predeces­sors. The presence of cultigens during the Forma­tive period functioned to effectively increase the amount of dietary carbohydrates that coastal resi­dents consumed and resulted in a corresponding decrease in oral health. Caries and tooth Joss among the Formative period valley groups are lower than those observed among the subsequent dedicated agriculturalists to inhabit the area (Kelley et al.

1991). The continued exploitation and consump­tion of both wild plants and marine resources dur­ing this time functioned to limit the degree of dependence on domesticated cultigens, which resulted in effectively suppressing the level of oral disease that is observed in later groups. 
Kelley et al. ( 1991) focus on documenting a lon­gitudinal trend in agricultural dependence based on similar oral health indicators from the Archaic onward. However, they fail to consider the role of local environment and social dynamics that may have led to greater investment in agriculture among valley residents. Our study demonstrates that related, closely located, contemporaneous groups actively made very different subsistence choices during the critical period when cultigens and agri­culture were introduced into the area. These processes were not the same across all of the Ata­cama Desert along the coast. 
Population Expansion and Adaptation 
We attribute the patterns in oral health during the Formative period in the Lower Azapa Valley to dif­ferential investment in niche-specific resources. These adaptations may also reflect a larger biocul­tural process of human expansion and adaptation in the area with the introduction of agriculture. It is possible that the arrival of domesticated cul ti gens along the Chilean coast upset the adaptive balance that the Chinchorro had achieved and which allowed them to maintain stable populations for over 6,000 years. Llagostera's (1989) vision of Chinchorro foraging recognizes "process" as a cru­cial element to their adaptation to the Atacama coast. Most anthropologists identify change as a constant in culture; therefore the introduction of cultigens and perhaps some level of agricultural technology would have provided an obvious cata­
<lyst to facilitate further change by promoting the exploration and exploitation of different niches available in the Lower Azapa Valley. This process resulted in the movement of groups or segments of the population deeper into the valley and created a closer relationship with the niche being exploited. 
It is also important to consider that these choices simultaneously resulted in niche construction. 
The process of population expansion and niche construction in the Lower Azapa Valley can be explained using Resilience Theory (Redman 1992, 
1999, 2005; Redman and Kinzig 2003; Redman et al. 2004). Redman (2005) highlights a four-stage cycle that groups go through to adapt to major change: ( 1) reorganization, renewal, and innova­tion; (2) growth and exploitation; (3) conservation and resource "locking-up"; and (4) release and rapid change. The spread of cultigens and agricul­tural technology in the area was part of a continent­wide phenomenon that carried with it the elements of major disruptive change, constituting the arrival of innovation (stage 1). Populations utilizing this new technology would have experienced a disrup­tion in traditional subsistence patterns to include new varieties of plant and animal resources. Seg­ments of the coastal group moved farther up the valley-possibly the result of population growth­to begin better exploitation of the new resources and niche construction (stage 2) and eventually would have developed a particular "conservation" for the application of the new technology (stage 3). Subsequent changes associated with agriculture, Formative period cultural developments, and diver­gence from coastal residents can be attributed to "release" (stage 4). 
This model has the advantage of contextualiz­ing the arrival of agriculture within the existing marine-based adaptation along the coast and the subsequent expansion up the valley. Resilience Theory assumes that systems function as an adap­tive cycle, fluctuating between stability and trans­formation (Redman 2005). Stable foraging adaptations along the coast were disrupted by the arrival of cultigens. Subsequently, these groups grew, diversified, and moved into the valley to exploit new niches. After this transformation process, the Lower Azapa Valley experienced another period of stability lasting approximately 2,000 years until the arrival of influence from Tiwanaku (Munoz 2004). 
One of the key elements to the application of Resilience Theory is population growth (Redman 2005). Population growth is largely considered one of the primary results of the introduction of agri­culture in a wide variety of societies across the planet(Bocquet-Appel2008; Childe 1925). In con­sidering population growth commonly associated with the Neolithic transition, Cohen (2008) con­tends that the moderate fertility/moderate mortal­ity pattern observed among stable archaic foragers (see discussion in Bocquet-Appel 2008) is remi-

niscent of K-selected strategies as described in pop­ulation biology literature. He additionally contends that the high fertility/high mortality pattern observed among subsequent expanding agricul­tural groups is reminiscent of r-selected strategies. This model fits the circumstances identified for the Chinchorro, which sustained stable populations in a crowded niche along a narrow coastline where equilibrium was maintained for several millennia. With the introduction of cultigens and agriculture, the population expanded farther away from the coast into open niches (primary colonizers) and began to rely on the exploitation of a wider variety of products. 
Both archaeological data and skeletal remains attest to continued affinity and interaction among coastal and valley interior residents during the For­mativeperiod. Yet our results indicate that decisions regarding resource investment and food choices differed within this biocultural continuum. The dif­ferences observed in oral health appear intuitive, but the archaeological evidence indicates a similar mixed subsistence economy at both locations. What instead might be suggested is that the importance of domesticated resources is not underscored by their presence in burial contexts during the For­mative period. 
Conclusions 
Evidence from archaeological and skeletal remains identify that Formative period groups in the Lower Azapa Valley practiced a shared mixed subsistence economy and were likely related culturally and bio­logically. Despite apparent connections, patterns in oral health demonstrate that the dietary base var­ied appreciably between coastal and valley resi­dents. Coastal groups exhibit fewer caries and less tooth loss compared to valley groups. Sites of caries initiation are largely confined to occlusal surfaces in coastal groups but vary across the whole tooth in valley groups. Floral and fauna! data recovered from these sites identify that each group was con­suming the same mix of domesticated and wild resources, yet valley residents suffered from more dental decay and tooth loss. Although severe wear can contribute to tooth loss, more lost teeth among valley residents mirrors the trend in caries and indi­cates that both are likely the result of greater con­sumption of dietary carbohydrates. These patterns suggest that coastal groups were more invested in marine foraging and valley groups were more invested in agropastoral production. 
Negative impacts on oral health that resulted from the foraging-to-farming transition in the Lower Azapa Valley were likely buffered, in par­ticular, by the rich marine resources at their dis­posal. In this case, after several millennia of stable and socially complex fishing-foraging, people began to invest in agriculture, possibly as a means of increasing dietary variety, stability, and produc­tivity. Some of these groups moved farther inland . 
and began to focus on the exploitation of ecologi­cal niches better suited for agropastoral production. These local investments or "imbedded" strategies mark the beginning of the Formative period in the area and continued relatively unchanged for almost 2,000 years until the arrival of infl uence from Tiwanaku and a complete shift to dependence on agropastoralism in the Azapa Valley.
