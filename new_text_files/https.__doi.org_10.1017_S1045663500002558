Cahal Tok (Place of Flint) is a limestone rise with some structural evidence, associated with the previously designated LDF Chert Site, close to the ceremonial center of El Pilar. Excavations uncovered evidence that during the Late Classic period, specializedjlintknappers produced bifaces, primarily chert axes, at the Cahal Tok locus, first on a cleared limestone shelf, then on a prepared cobble platform. Small flakes remained in situ whereas much of the larger debris was deposited to the east off the edge of the platform and into the LDF debitage dump. The identification of a specialized manufacturing locale near the ceremonial precinct of a major center is unusual in Maya archaeology. Central control of an important industry may be implied, although knapping could equally well be organized more independently. We expect that small industrial areas are actually present at most large sites, but may often be difficult to recognize.

about the nature of industry and political organi­zation in Maya society. 
Evidence of areas devoted to industrial activity within major Maya centers is not commonly reported, and the situation at the Cahal Tok/LDF locality at the site of El Pilar in Belize is thus unusual. At Cahal Tok a small stone platform on a cleared limestone surface was the actual knapping area, with debitage deposited nearby to form a dump, designated the LDF Chert Site during ear­lier work by Ford and her teams. The debitage from deposits at Cahal Tok and LDF shows that the knap­pers made flaked stone celts in great numbers. The density of deposits and the scale of specialized pro­duction were comparable to some loci at Colha. There was some separation of work and discard over a substantial period of time in the Late Clas­sic period, using material that was acquired and partly prepared elsewhere. All of this is evidence of a considerable amount of organization. The immediate area around Cahal Tok and LDF seems to have been used for limestone quarrying, and shows only sparse signs of habitation. An adjacent concentration of about: 200 intentionally broken limestone spindle whorls is probably a ritual deposit that may indicate fabric production in the area as well (Kamp et al. 2007). This apparent industrial zone is very close to the ceremonial and civic cen­ter of the site, and could have been controlled from it, although a less centralized organization of pro­
duction is equally plausible. 
Excavations 
The El Pilar Archeological Reserve for Flora and 
Fauna is located on the international boundary 
between Belize to the east and Guatemala to the 
west, approximately 24 km north of San Ignacio 
town and 11 km from Bullet Tree Falls Village in 
Belize (Figure 1). The site is in the uplands drained 
by tributaries of the Belize River. El Pilar is the 
largest center of the Belize River area and consists 
of 25 mapped plaza complexes, with most con­
struction occurring in the Middle Preclassic period 
(950 B.C.-650 B.C.) and Late to Terminal Classic 
periods (A.D. 650-A.D. 1000).1 
The LDF Chert locus (Ford and Olson 1989: 189; 
Michaels 1993 :227) is a dense deposit of lithic 
debris, roughly 150 m northwest of Plaza Co pal near 
the middle of the El Pilar monumental center (Fig-

ure 2). The densest debris covers an area roughly 15-20 m in diameter in a large depression that is probably the result of quarrying for limestone, although Ford estimates the total deposit may be as much as 50 X 50 min extent (Ford 1991 ). In 1990, the BRASS/El Pilar project excavated two 1 X 1 m test pits, recovering over 1,000 kg of debitage from a single test pit, according to field notes. Adjacent to the LDF locus are two low mounds and a plat­form with lithic debris, referred to as Cahal Tok (Place of Flint). In the summer of2004, a team from Grinnell College, directed by Kamp and Whittaker, tested this area to understand the context of lithic production at the previously discovered and tested LDF Chert Site. Our analysis included the lithic debitage recovered from Cahal Tok, and a sample from LDF consisting of material from a 1Oxl0 cm column collected in 15 cm levels from the south part of the west wall of one of the two test pits excavated in 1990 (TP2), and bifaces from both LDF test pits. The entire LDF column had been saved including dirt and nonartifactual inclusions, allowing us to calculate the density of each of the elements of the deposit and permitting identical analytic procedures to be used on both the LDF and Cahal Tok materi­als.

knapped by Whittaker provided an experimental comparison. 
The LDF and Cahal Tok deposits do not appear to be directly associated with house mounds in a habitation area. The immediate vicinity is an area of sparse structural evidence with many pits and edges of exposed bedrock, apparently from lime­stone quarry activity. The LDF debitage deposit is adjacent to the southeast edge of a small rise where a low ledge of exposed bedrock begins a gentle slope up to the north and west, with apparent struc­tural remnants in the form of limestone and coarse chert nodules and slight mounding at the highest point to the west. We excavated a series of test trenches to form an almost continuous profile across the rise, from the limestone edge adjacent to the LDF deposits on the east, to the edge of the mound on the top of the rise to the west (Figure 3). 
Stratigraphy and Structures at Cahal Tok and LDF 
The stratigraphy at Cahal Tok was not complicated. All of the trenches were carried to limestone bedrock, which was encountered at 50--70 cm below modem surface. Cultural deposits lay directly on the limestone in all the trenches, and it appeared that the limestone was exposed and clean at the begin­ning of occupation. We were unable to tell whether the limestone surface resulted from intentional clearing, a common precursor to construction, or had been bared by erosion following farming or quarry activities. In Trenches 3, 4, and 5, and in the western part of Trench 1, the limestone surface was hard and smooth. We consider this evidence that it was protected under the platform and the western mound respectively. Elsewhere the upper few cen­timeters of the limestone were friable and scaly, weathering into the bottom of the soil profile devel­oping on the site. At the eastern edge of the site, knapping debris had accumulated directly on bedrock in a layer 50--60 cm thick at the east end of T3, and progressively thinning westward across T3 and T4 until it ended as small pockets in bedrock depressions in T5 and T9. This debitage deposit was so dense, effectively nothing but flakes with limey clay filling the voids, that in T3 and 4 we were

forced to collect a sample only. This was usually in the form of a 20 X 20 cm column collected from the southeast corner of each 1 X I m subdivision of the trenches, for each 10 cm arbitrary excavation level. All other fill from the debitage layers was screened and sorted for pottery, obsidian, retouched tools, and other artifacts. To keep our samples com­parable, we maintained the column sampling in T3 and T4 for all levels, including the upper ones that were not dense debitage. 
West of the debitage deposit of T3 and T4, the material on bedrock was a dark clayey loam that filled the cracks, root holes, and animal burrows in the top few centimeters of the limestone, and con­tained a moderate number of artifacts. Approach­ing the surface, in profiles the fill appeared darker and more humic, with stronger development of soil peds, and much recent biological activity in the form of roots and leaf litter in the upper few cen­timeters. There was little to distinguish fill in one part of the site from another, and there was no ceramic evidence of chronological distinctions. Generally, the limestone bedrock was covered with 30-60 cm of cultural fill weathering to a shallow soil formation. 
In T3 and T4, a dark, rocky layer about 20 cm thick overlay the debitage. It was discontinuous and presented an uneven surface, and it was not until we found the wall line and a better surface in 
TS that we were convinced it was the top of a low platform. The wall in TS was 20-30 cm high, usu­ally two courses of unshaped limestone and chert, forming a rough edge for a platform built of smaller lumps of limestone and chert. The base of the wall appeared to rest directly on bedrock in places, how­ever, directly adjacent to the wall was a depression in the bedrock filled with fine debitage, and the rocky fill of the platform overlay debitage to the east in T4 and T3. There was no evidence that there was ever a plastered floor. 

Above the rocks of the platform, the dark fill was similar to the rest of the site. Only in the eastern half ofT3, closest to the LDF deposit, was there a further level of dense debitage exposed at the sur­face. We regard this as evidence that the knapping continued after the platform surface was built. 
At LDF, the two test trenches showed 70-100 cm of fill that was almost entirely debitage, with minor portions of soil and limestone rocks, and only a few sherds and other artifacts (Figure4). The surface today is well below the adjacent surface of 
our trenches at Cahal Tok, and the debitage appears 
to be filling a depression. 
Artifact Analyses 
The artifacts of Cahal Tok are dominated by lithic production debris, on which our analyses concen­trated. We recovered a limited assemblage of tem­porally diagnostic ceramics that provided the best evidence for dating activities at the locus. 
Ceramics 
The Cahal Tok ceramic assemblage included 4, 144 sherds, of which 229 (S.5 percent) were temporally diagnostic, a low proportion for contexts at El Pilar, where construction fill averages about 12 percent and midden contexts up to 2S percent temporally diagnostic ceramics. The ceramic assemblage over­all was sparse and poorly preserved. As no sealed deposits were recovered, the ceramic assemblage represents mixed contexts; nevertheless, the tem­poral range of the ceramics is limited, showing that the platform on the site was in use in the late facet of the Late Classic period, corresponding to the Spanish Lookout Phase, from AD. 700 to A.D. 9SO (Gifford 1976), and to Tepeu 2 at Uaxactun (Smith 19SS). Large open jars and bowls of fine paste dominated the assemblage, which lacked the coarse paste cooking vessels common in domestic sites in the region (Ford 2000; Lucero 2001). Our conclusion from the limited ceramic evidence is that Cahal Tok was not a residential area, but a spe­cial activity site dating to the Late Classic period. 
Lithic Tools 
Table 1 shows the distribution of major tool types at Cahal Tok compared to the assemblage from Chiik Nah, a small habitation mound somewhat fur­ther south from the central plazas of El Pilar (Whit­taker et al. 2002). The assemblages are broadly similar, and comparable to those from other habi­tation sites in the area. Chiik N ah, ranked at the very bottom of the residential scale at El Pilar, has rel­atively few obsidian prismatic blades, and rela­tively many gravers. Another site in the El Pilar sphere, 272-I 36, a group of larger house mounds around a plaza 4.S km south of El Pilar, had an unusual assemblage dominated by obsidian blades

assemblage suggests that besides biface manufac­ture, there was a low level of the normal craft and maintenance activities found at nearby residential sites. The LDF tool assemblage, in contrast, is almost entirely biface manufacturing failures and broken biface tools. 
B!faces 
Biface fragments, failures, and discards would be expected in the manufacturing contexts suggested by the debitage at Cahal Tok and LDF. There were no bifaces in our Cahal Tok column samples, although we recovered one from the debitage in T3 and several others from the trenches to the west. 

The two test pits in the LDF deposits produced a number of biface failures among the debitage. The sample is not very large, and there are no apparent patterns by depth. The following analysis consid­ers only the LDF specimens. 
All told, there were 57 biface pieces from the LDF test pits, plus a dozen or so flake tools and an obsidian blade segment that will not be considered section. At El Pilar, the bit may be either flaked or flaked and ground. Common labels for these and related tools include "general utility bifaces," "oval bifaces," and "flaked celts."2 Such tools were all­purpose necessities of Maya life, as ubiquitous as the machete today. Although we gloss them as "axes," experiments and use-wear studies show that such bifaces are effective for a wide range of chores including forest clearance, woodworking, agricul­tural tillage, and quarrying and shaping limestone (Aldenderfer et al. 1989; Aoyama 2007; Lewen­stein 1987; Shafer and Hester l 986a; Stemp 2004; Woods and Titmus 1996). Examination of speci­mens from other areas at El Pilar shows a wide range of macroscopic use-wear, including small stepped flake damage, heavy battering and dulling, and glossy polishes. Many El Pilar specimens have been reflaked, often crudely, suggesting that here as elsewhere owners maintained tools made by spe­cialists and recycled chert (Moholy-Nagy 2003; Shafer 2000). 
The importance of general utility bifaces and related forms as a basic Maya tool is underlined by

their wide distribution in space and time. They occur in contexts ranging from residential quarters to architectural fill. Oval bifaces began to be made at Colha in the Middle Preclassic perio, with mass production beginning by the Late Preclassic period (Shafer and Hester 1986b ). They were manufac­tured in enormous numbers at Late Classic period contexts at Colha (Roemer 1991; Shafer and Hes­ter 1983), but many other sites also produced bifa­cial axe forms (Black and Suhler 1986; Hyde 2003; Meadows and Hartnett 2000; Potter 1993; Thomp­son 1991), and related tools. At El Pilar, Ford esti­mates that bifaces occur at a frequency of approximately one per cubic meter in excavated midden and fill. 
The LDF axes include pieces at all stages of manufacture. There are 10 early pieces on which little has been done except edging and decortica­tion of a chert nodule (Figure 6). The debitage analysis suggests that this is the form in which most of the material must have arrived. The available cherts and chalcedonies around El Pilar are not largeenough to produce the macrofiake blanks used at Colha. Fourteen pieces from LDF show middle stage work, thinning and shaping the preform. A late stage, in which final shaping is done and edges are finished is represented by 11 pieces (Figure 7). Almost all the biface specimens show the kind of bending fracture common to manufacturing failures (and heavy use in the case of finished axes). In most cases, the fracture initiated at a weak spot in flawed material. Although as noted above, most of the stone is perfectly adequate for axes, a few pieces are so obviously bad that one wonders why a knap­per bothered with them. We might speculate that poor material could be used for training apprentices at such a workshop site (Ferguson 2003; Grimm 2000; Milne 2005; Stout 2002). The relative scarcity of failures compared to Co Iha, and the fre­quent hard use and recycling of axes elsewhere on the site suggest that better quality stone was some­what valuable. Good pieces should not have bro-

ken often in later stages of axe manufacture, and when they did, they may have been removed from the deposit and reworked. 
Among the fragments are several from axes that had been finished and used, including two with ground bits, and seven proximal (butt) end pieces with heavily dulled edges or ground surfaces (Fig­ure 8). One other axe is complete, but worn out by resharpening and reworking of edges and the bro­ken butt. These pieces suggest that the knappers on site not only made new implements but reworked old tools. The discarded butt ends are often expected to have been discarded as new blades were fitted to old hafts, and McAnany (1992) argues that these mark retooling sites, whereas bit ends are more common in field areas. 
Few knapping tools were recovered from Cahal Tok and LDF. Antler would probably not have sur­vived in these deposits, but the evidence of the flake platforms suggests that work was done with stone hammers, which would. Limestone hammers are common at Colha, and although we might have missed some among the other limestone lumps in fill at Cahal Tok, we were alert to this possibility and did look, finding only one recognizable ham­merstone in all the Cahal Tok trenches. This was a chert specimen, not ideal for a knapping tool. Tools of any kind were readily noted in the homogeneous debitage deposits of LDF, which produced one good quartzite or sandstone knapping hammer. 

Debitage 
The debitage analyses allow us to further discuss the process and location of manufacturing activi­ties at Cahal Tok and LDF, and provide a basis for estimating the scale of production. Debitage was analyzed by size class (maximum dimension < 2 cm, 2-4 cm, 4-6 cm, and> 6 cm), presence of cor­tex, coarseness of material, evidence of burning, and type of flake (Tables 4 and 5). Thick flakes with large bulbs of percussion and large flat platforms were identified as the result of hard-hammer per­cussion. Thinner flakes with diffuse bulbs of per­cussion, lipped platforms, and multiple flake scars

on the exterior surface were classified as biface thinning flakes. Flakes with missing platforms and/or lacking other recognizable indicators were classified as indetemilnate. An additional category of shatter described angular pieces that appeared freshly broken but lacked identifiable flake fea­tures. Chert pieces that were clearly broken by fire and showed no evidence of knapping were not recorded. 
The Cahal Tok column samples were weighed, screened with one-sixteenth inch (16 mm) mesh to remove the loose fill, and the flakes washed in the field lab. Each sample was then screened through a quarter-inch (64 mm) mesh. Rocks, and the mate­rial that passed through the screen, mostly microdebitage,3 was also saved and weighed but not analyzed. To compare our excavated material with that from the LDF deposit itself, we analyzed five column samples collected from the LDF deposit in 1990. The LDF samples had not been screened and contained all the material that was excavated, so they could be subjected to the same treatment as the samples from Cahal Tok. The only major difference is that initial weights for Cahal Tok were obtained while there was still some moisture in the sediment. The LDF column samples were a 10 X I 0 cm area from each 15 cm level and our Cahal Tok column samples varied from 20 X 20 cm to I 0 X I 0 cm of each 10 cm excavation level. Our field experience demonstrated that rocks and other inclusions, as well as the inherent difficulty of taking a consistent size sample even within the nominal boundaries, created variability in the accu­racy of the samples that was revealed in some dif­ferences in weight and volume for theoretically identical samples. Because of this variability, the comparisons presented in Table 3 are by propor­tion, rather than absolute quantities.

With the exception of a few pieces of obsidian, mostly small fragments of prismatic blades, all the lithic material from the site can be glossed as chert. 
The chert varies from opaque brown or grey stone to translucent browns, greys, purples, and colorless material. Some other projects in Belize would prob­ably call the more translucent material chalcedony (Cackler et al. 1999; Oland 1999; Shafer 2000; Shafer and Hester 1983). Most of the debitage is good-quality stone, although not up to the stan­dards of Colha. Quality varies from coarse and gritty to very fine and glassy, although material of all qualities may have voids or other flaws. There are some pieces so grainy that quartzite is proba­bly a better term, and a few flakes are of hard lime­stone with a silicious component. We do not make a distinction between chert and chalcedony because in the El Pilar material, a high proportion is deeply patinated to a dead white, only revealing original color when broken. Moreover, in local nodules, the translucent and opaque often intergrade in the same nodule. There may be some distinction in source locations, which we cannot currently specify. The cortex is usually a rough white hard limey surface over a grey or brown che1ty rind. There is little evi­dence of river rolling, but most of the stone does not appear to come from the limestone at El Pilar itself, although without further survey for chert sources we cannot be too sure.
