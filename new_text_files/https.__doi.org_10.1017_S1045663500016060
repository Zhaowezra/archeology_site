While other volumes on Oaxacan ethnohistory or historical archaeology focus on individual documents,buildings, or communities, this volume provides aregionalbreadththatspeaksoftheproliferationofstudiesbeyond the Valley of Oaxaca. It espouses a perspectivethat expands traditional understandings of what falls inthe realm of history and the lines of evidence thatresearchers can and should use. 
ThevolumebeginswithDannyZboroversexcellentdiscussionof27 centuriesofpictorialandliterarytraditions in Oaxaca. The author argues for an integrativeapproachtobridgethegapsbetweenarchaeologyandhistory and among the prehispanic, historical, and contemporary periods. He summarizes the progression ofwritingfromtheMiddleFormativemonolithatSanJosMogoteandtheClassicperiodcarvedstonemonumentsto the Postclassic and colonial codices, mapas, lienzos,and archives. Zborover brings his discussion to the presentasindigenouscommunities,inOaxacaandabroad,turn to contemporary forms of communication, digitalmedia,theInternet,andcontemporaryarttoengagewiththeir heritage. He outlines emerging lines of researchand how the chapters that follow contribute to them.
Ronald Spores championsethnohistory as a replicable methodology that can improve current understandings of prehispanic societies and calls for the use of aconvergent approach. In the chapter, however, Sporesstops short of fully illustrating how the ethnohistoricalrecord informed his interpretationsof the carved panelsor the early colonial burial mentioned from his projectatYucundaa. 
In Chapter 3, John Pohl gives a personal account ofworking with Byland in the Tilantongo Valley survey.Next, Viola Knig argues that Santa Maria Cuquila, inthe Mixteca Alta, corresponds with the jaguar towntoponym in the Codex Egerton. Knigs identificationcontradictstheoneofferedbyJansenandPrezJimnezin their 2011 volume The Mixtec Manuscript: Time,Agency, and Memory in Ancient Mexico, where theyidentifythetoponymtobeCuyotepeji(uuaa)intheMixtecaBaja.Knigdiscusseshersupportingevidence,warnsagainstrenamingthecodex,andshowcasescommunity engagement activities in Cuquila.
Geoffrey and Sharisse McCafferty reminisce aboutworking with Byland in the Tamazulapam survey and offeraninterpretationofLady9GrassfromCodexNuttall as a Mixtec version of Cihuacatl, based on her useof a skeletalbuccal mask.Theydiscussthe depictionofweavinginstrumentsinthecodicesassymbolsoffemalepower and the metaphorical weaving of (i.e., creationof) cultural landscapes.
In Chapter 6, Bruce Byland frankly discusses, usingcognitive psychology, the confirmation bias and theerrorsofprematureclosureandinadequatesynthesisthat he and Jansen have committed while working toidentify toponyms like the hill of the wasp and thered and white bundle. Byland argues that these placesare located near Tilantongo and Jaltepec, in theNochixtlnValley,whileJansenplacesthemintheValleyof Oaxaca, in and around Monte Albn. Byland offersus an example of how to discuss academic differencesin an open, professional, and civil dialog.
