CULTURAL DIVERSITY AND PALEOMOBILITY IN THE ANDEAN 
MIDDLE HORIZON: RADIOGENIC STRONTIUM ISOTOPE ANALYSES 
IN THE SAN PEDRO DE ATACAMA OASES OF NORTHERN CHILE 

Kelly J. Knudson and Christina Torres-Rouff 
Despite a long history of research, interactions between the Tiwanaku polity of the Andean Middle Horizon (ca. AD. 500­1100) and the San Pedro de Atacama oases of northern Chile remain controversial. Here, we investigate Middle Horizon interactions through an isotopic identification of the geographic origins of individuals buried in San Pedro de Atacama cemeteries and present the largest radiogenic strontium isotope dataset generated, to date.for the Andes. For individuals in Middle Horizon San Pedro de Atacama cemeteries of Casa Parroquial, Cayo Oriental, Coyo-3, Larache, Quitor-5, Sol­cor-3, Solcor Plaza, Solor-3, and Tchecar Tumulo Sur, mean tooth enamel and bone "Sr!"Sr = .70834 ± .00172 (2u, n = 273 ). Overall, the mean "Sri" Sr values from Middle Horizon San Pedro de Atacama cemeteries support the idea that inter­actions between Atacamefios and inhabitants of other regions varied by ayllu, an Andean kin-based community structure, with some ayllus incorporating individuals with a wider variety of geographic origins than others. When our interpretations of the radiogenic strontium isotope data are contextualized with analyses of mortuary behavior and recent biodistance analyses, we argue that the San Pedro de Atacama oases appear to be have been inhabited by culturally and biologically diverse groups, rather than by large numbers of colonists from the Tiwanaku capital and the Lake Titicaca Basin . 
A pesar de una larga historia de investigaci6n, las interacciones en el Horizonte Media Andino (ca. 500-1 JOO d.C.) entre Los Tiwanaku y Los habitantes de San Pedro de Atacama siguen siendo polemicas. En este manuscrito investigamos estas interac­ciones a traves de la identificaci6n isot6pica de Los orfgenes geogrdficos de individuos enterrados en cementerios de/ Horizonte Media en San Pedro de Atacama, y presentamos la mayor colecci6n de datos de is6topos de estroncio generada, hasta la fecha, en los Andes. Los resultados obtenidos para Los individuos de los cementerios de Casa Parroquial, Coyo Oriental. Coyo-3, Larache, Quitor-5, Solcor-3. Solcor Plaza, Solor-3. y Tchecar Tumulo Sur, muestran que el promedio "Sri" Sr de esmalte dental y de hue sos es .70834 ± .00172 (2u, n = 273 ). En general, Los valores promedios de "Sr!" Sr de los cementerios de! Horizonte Media en San Pedro de Atacama apoyan la idea de que las interacciones entre los atacamefios y Los habitantes de otras regiones variaron por ayllu, con algunos ayllus incorporando mds individuos de otras regiones que otros. Los resultados sugieren ademds amplia variedad de orfgenes geogrdficos para Los individuos fuerefios. Cuando nuestras interpretaciones de los datos isot6picos se contextualizan con estudios de/ espacio mortuorio y andlisis recientes de distancias biolcigicas, sostenemos que los oasis de San Pedro de Atacama parecen haber sido habitados por una poblaci6n local con apenas una pequefia contribuci6n de individuos cultural y biol6gicamente diversos. Los nuevos datos favorecen la idea de que no hubo un gran numero de colonos de la capital de Tiwanaku y la de cuenca del Lago Titicaca en los oasis atacamefios, a pesar de! impacto cultural que esa cultura tuvo en el desarrollo local.

Atacama oases were an important way station providing food and water in the Atacama Desert (Stanish 2003). In addition, there is ample evi­dence of trade and exchange of metal ores (Lecht­man and Macfarlane 2005, 2006) and the pres­ence of Tiwanaku-style ceramics (Stovel 2001), textiles (Oakland Rodman 1992), wooden snuff tablets (Torres 1987), and pyroengraved bone ar­tifacts (Figures 2-4). 
Tiwanaku-style artifacts in San Pedro de Ata­cama were initially interpreted as evidence of colonists (Kolata 1993; Oakland Rodman 1992). Subsequently, scholars have argued that local pop­ulations manipulated their cultural affiliation and adopted aspects of Tiwanaku material culture (Knudson 2008; Knudson and Blom 2009; Knud­son and Price 2007; Torres and Conklin 1995; To­rres-Rouff 2008, 2009). Here, we investigate in­teractions between the Tiwanaku polity and the San Pedro de Atacama oases through an isotopic identification of the geographic origins of individ­uals buried in San Pedro de Atacama cemeteries. 
We first summarize recent scholarship on the San Pedro de Atacama oases during the Middle Horizon. After introducing radiogenic strontium isotope studies in the Andes, including baseline 87 Sr/86Sr values in the south-central Andes and likely sources for bioavailable strontium in north­ern Chile, we present the largest radiogenic stron­tium isotope dataset generated to date for the An­des. This includes radiogenic strontium isotope data from archaeological human tooth enamel and bone from the following Middle Horizon cemeteries: Casa Parroquial, Coyo Oriental, Coyo-3, Larache, Quitor-5, Solcor-3, Solcor

Plaza, Solor-3, and Tchecar Tumulo Sur. In the discussion, we contextualize our interpretations of the radiogenic strontium isotope data with analyses of mortuary behavior and recent biodis­tance analyses. Combining these multiple datasets reveals evidence that the San Pedro de Atacama oases appear to have been inhabited by culturally and biologically diverse groups, rather than by large numbers of colonists from the Tiwanaku capital and the Lake Titicaca Basin. 
The San Pedro de Atacama Oases 
During the Andean Middle Horizon 

Previous research on the Middle Horizon in the San Pedro de Atacama oases has focused on mor­tuary investigations at a number of different cemeteries. Earlier researchers focused on the presence of Tiwanaku-style material culture, par­ticularly textiles and hallucinogenic snuff kits, in a number of Middle Horizon mortuary contexts. For example, Oakland Rodman's (1992, 1994) detailed textile analysis identified a number of Tiwanaku-style textiles in the cemetery of Coyo Oriental. Similarly, Tiwanaku-style snuff kits, ce­ramics, and basketry are present in San Pedro de

Atacama mortuary contexts (Llagostera 1995, 2006; Llagostera et al. 1988; Stovel 2001, 2008; Torres 1985, 200 I; Torres-Rouff 2008; Uribe and Aguero 2001). Based on the presence of Ti­wanaku-style material culture, a number of re­searchers have argued that San Pedro de Atacama was inhabited at least in part by Tiwanaku colonists from the Lake Titicaca Basin (Be­navente et al. 1986; Berenguer and Dauelsberg 1988; Kolata 1993; Oakland Rodman 1992; Varela and Cocilovo 2000). For example, based on the presence of the aforementioned Tiwanaku­style textiles alongside Atacameno textiles, Oak­land Rodman ( 1992:336) argued that "there were most likely many people physically present whose original home was the Bolivian altiplano." How­ever, as more analyses have resulted from recent archaeological work in the oases, this perspective has faded in prominence. 
Interactions Between Atacamenos and Polities 
Throughout the South-Central Andes 
Recent research has emphasized the diversity in material culture styles present in San Pedro de Atacama during the Middle Horizon. Tiwanaku­style artifacts-including textiles, ceramics, and snuffing paraphernalia-represent a small pro­portion of the artifact assemblages from the oases (see discussions in Goldstein and Rivera 2005; Stovel 2008; Torres-Rouff 2008; Uribe and Aguero 2001). Importantly, there is also evidence for snuff kits, ceramics, and textiles from north­western Argentina and other parts of Bolivia, in­cluding Cochabamba, as well as neighboring ar­eas in northern Chile (Conklin and Conklin 2007; 
Llagostera et al. 1988; Stovel 2008; Torres-Rouff 2008). Diversity in material culture found in the oases is reflected both in style and in source ma­terial. For example, in addition to the presence of artifacts from northwestern Argentina in the San Pedro de Atacama oases, there is also evi­dence of cultural connections from northern Chile in northwestern Argentina, including snuffing paraphernalia (Pochettino et al. 1999). Moreover, recent analyses of the wood used in snuff tablets reflect a number of different sources, including some near San Pedro de Atacama, but others from the Lake Titicaca Basin and northwestern Ar­gentina (Niemeyer 2013), and the hallucinogenic snuff (Anadenanthera colubrina) itself likely came from northwestern Argentina (Torres and Repke 2006; Torres et al. 1991). Similarly, the sources of metal ores used in mortuary objects excavated in San Pedro de Atacama were variable (Lechtman 2003; Lechtman and Macfarlane 2005; Lechtman and Macfarlane 2006). For ex­ample, while most Middle Horizon axes exca­vated in the San Pedro de Atacama oases were made from ternary bronze alloy, likely from ore sources south of the Lake Titicaca Basin, some bronze artifacts likely contained ores from north­western Argentina or northern Chile (Lechtman 2003; Lechtman and Macfarlane 2005; Lechtman and Macfarlane 2006). 
Incorporating multiple lines of evidence both within and outside of the San Pedro de Atacama oases, it is clear that the oases served as an im­portant site in the vast Middle Horizon trade and exchange networks crossing the south-central An­des. In contrast to the colonization model previ­ously discussed, Llagostera ( 1996) posits that, during the Middle Horizon, San Pedro de Ata­cama functioned as a node for the movement of people and goods across the Atacama Desert. At least some of this exchange involved llama cara­vans associated with the Tiwanaku polity (Janusek 2004; Stanish 2003; Stanish et al. 2010). Regardless of the nature of the relationships be­tween Atacamenos and other polities in the south­central Andes, the Middle Horizon in San Pedro de Atacama is characterized by diversity in ma-

terial culture, as well as archaeological and bioar­chaeological indicators of population variability and emerging hierarchies (Berenguer 2000; Hubbe et al. 2012; Llagostera 1996; Sutter 2009; Torres-Rouff 2008, 2011; Varela and Cocilovo 2000). 
An Introduction to the Middle Horizan Cemeteries of Casa Parroquial, Larache, Quitor-5, Solcor-3, Solcor Plaza, Solor-3, and Tchecar Tumulo Sur 
In this manuscript, we focus on the cemeteries of Casa Parroquial, Larache, Quitor-5, Solcor-3, Sol­cor Plaza, Solor-3, and Tchecar Ttimulo Sur (Fig­ure 1). These nine cemeteries span the Middle Horizon (Hub be and Torres-Rouff 2013), yet there is increasing evidence for diversity within and between the Middle Horizon cemeteries in San Pedro de Atacama. Spatial variability is pre­sent in the physical location of each cemetery and its association with a different ayllu in the present and likely the past; here, we use the term ayllu to refer to an Andean kin-based community structure that incorporates lineage, geography, and sociopolitical groups (e.g., Abercrombie 1998). For example, while some cemeteries, such as Solcor and Larache, are located more centrally in the core of the oases closer to the San Pedro River, other cemeteries, such as Coyo and Solor, are located in more distant areas. The spatial pat­terning may reflect group-level differences in the oases, since there is also variability between cemeteries in the material culture present in buri­als. For example, the cemetery of Larache is as­sociated with Tiwanaku-style gold keros, or drink­ing vessels, and has been identified as one of the "wealthiest" cemeteries in San Pedro de Atacama (Baron 2004; Benavente et al. 1986; Berenguer and Dauelsberg 1988; Kolata 1993; Tamblay 2004; Varela and Cocilovo 2000). The cemetery of Casa Parroquial is also known for its quantities of Tiwanaku-style gold objects, although the small mortuary collections available are, unfor­tunately, not well provenienced. However, bio­logical distance studies have demonstrated that the individuals buried at Casa Parroquial share closer biological ties with Lake Titicaca Basin populations than other San Pedro de Atacama populations (Sutter 2009). As at Casa Parroquial, the Solcor cemeteries contain relatively large 
quantities of high-status mortuary objects, leading some researchers to argue that individuals buried there held an advantageous position in the oases (Bravo and Llagostera 1986; Llagostera et al. 1988). All of these cemeteries are located in the core of the oases (Figure 1). 
In contrast, the cemeteries of Coyo-3 and Coyo Oriental are located south of the main core of the 
oases (Figure 1). Similarly, Solor-3 and Tchecar 
Ttimulo Sur are located in the south, while Quitor­
5 is located at the northern edge of the oasis (Fig­
ure 1). The mortuary assemblages at these sites 
vary, and generally include relatively small num­
bers of high status and/or non-local objects com­
pared to the cemeteries of Larache, Solcor, and 
Casa Parroquial (Cocilovo and Zavattieri 1994; 
Costa and Llagostera 1994; Llagostera et al. 1988; 
Torres-Rouff 2008). 
Diversity within ayllus and individual ceme­teries is also present during the Middle Horizon. For example, within the present-day Solcor ayllu, individuals buried in the cemeteries of Solcor-3 and Solcor Plaza had differential access to high­status mortuary objects, as well as cemetery-spe­cific differences in cranial modification styles, traumatic injury, paleodiet, and geographic origins (Nado et al. 20 12; Torres-Rouff 20 1 1). These pat­terns may reflect such things as differences in social standing or eliteness or perhaps kin or labor relations to distant groups. Here, we use a con­textualized radiogenic strontium isotope analysis to better understand relationships between the San Pedro de Atacama oases and the Tiwanaku polity, incorporating recent research on variability within and between cemeteries in the oases. 
Radiogenic Strontium Isotope 
Analysis in the Andes 

Radiogenic strontium isotope data (87Sr/'6Sr) vary geologically and can be used to examine paleo­mobility in archaeological human remains (see discussions in Bentley 2006; Knudson et al. 2010; Slovak and Paytan 2011). Briefly, bioavailable strontium is incorporated into human tissues dur­ing enamel and bone formation, so that if"local" strontium is consumed and/or imbibed, the 87Sr/86Sr values will reflect the geologic region or regions in which that individual lived during enamel and bone formation. Radiogenic strontium

isotope data have documented paleomobility in a number of regions and polities of the Andes, including the Nasca (Buzon et al. 2012; Conlee et al. 2009; Knudson et al. 2009), Tiwanaku (Knudson 2007, 2008, 20 1 1 ; Knudson and Blom 2009; Knudson and Price 2007; Knudson et al. 2004; Knudson et al. 2005), Wari (Knudson and Tung 2011; Slovak et al. 2009; Tung and Knudson 2008, 2010, 2011), and lnka (Andrushko et al. 2011; Andrushko et al. 2009; Knudson, Gardella, and Yaeger 2012; Turner et al. 2009). 
Baseline Radiogenic Strontium Isotope Values in the South-Central Andes: Geologic Data 
The south-central Andes exhibit the geologic vari­ability necessary for the successful application of radiogenic strontium isotope analysis to ques­tions of paleomobility. In particular, the geologic region in which San Pedro de Atacama is situated is composed largely of Cenozoic volcanic rocks, namely andesites (Hawkesworth et al. 1982; James 1982; O'Callaghan and Francis 1986; Rogers and Hawkesworth 1989). In the region, exposed bedrock samples exhibit mean 87Sr/86Sr = .70646 ± .00020 (la, n = 8) (Rogers and Hawkesworth 1989) and 87Sr/86Sr = .70653 ± .00036 (I a, n = 16) (Francis et al. 1977). In ad­dition, one water sample from Rio San Pedro ex­hibited 87Sr/86Sr = .70746 (Boschetti et al. 2007). 
The neighboring altiplano has much higher 87Sr/86Sr values than San Pedro de Atacama (Coudrain et al. 2002; Grove et al. 2003; Placzek et al. 2011). The Lake Titicaca Basin consists of alluvial deposits and Paleozoic andesites, sand­stones, and red mudstones (Argollo et al. 1996). Surface water samples from Lake Titicaca exhibit 87Sr/86Sr = .70834 ± .00013 (la, n = 3) (Grove et 
al. 2003) and 87Sr/"'Sr = .70834 (Coudrain et al. 2002). Similar values are found in surface water and groundwater from other areas that drain water from the Western Cordillera of the Andes, in­cluding the Salar de Uyuni and the Salar de Coipasa (Coudrain et al. 2002; Placzek et al. 20 11). However, to the south and east of the Lake Titicaca Basin, altiplano water sources ultimately come from the Eastern Cordillera; for example, water from Lake Poop6 in the southern Bolivian altiplano exhibits 87Sr/86Sr = .71404 to '1Sr/86Sr = .7 18372 (Grove et al. 2003; Placzek et al. 2011). Continuing south, the region of northwestern Ar­gentina that is adjacent to the San Pedro de Ata­cama oases exhibits a mixture of Cenozoic vol­canic rocks such as andesites and Quaternary sed­imentary formations. Data from andesites in Cerro Galan exhibit 87Sr/'6Sr = .70852 and 87Sr/86Sr = .70953 (Francis et al. 1980). Finally, in the lower­altitude zones to the east of the altiplano, the Cochabamba Valley is composed of Quaternary sedimentary rocks and Ordovician sandstones and siltstones overlain by alluvial deposits (Stim­son et al. 2001); radiogenic strontium isotope analyses have not yet been undertaken on geo­logic or water samples from the Cochabamba area. 
Baseline Radiogenic Strontium Isotope Values in the South-Central Andes: Fauna! Data 
While radiogenic strontium isotope values in ex­posed bedrock are a useful way to begin to un­derstand geologic variability and the suitability of isotopic paleomobility studies, examining bioavailable strontium enables researchers to more accurately identify "local" signatures (Bent­ley 2006; Price et al. 2002). Modem and archae­ological faunal samples, particularly from small mammals with limited ranges, give a useful esti­mate of the radiogenic strontium isotope values that would be expected in individuals consuming strontium from that geologic region (Bentley et al. 2004; Evans and Tatham 2004; Price et al. 2002). Bioavailable radiogenic strontium isotope values in local modem and archaeological small mammal samples from San Pedro de Atacama exhibited mean 87Sr/86Sr = .70764 ± .00013 (la, n = 3) (Knudson and Price 2007). In contrast, modem faunal samples exhibit mean 87Sr/86Sr = 
.70963 ± .00028 (lrr, n 8) in the northern alti­
= 
plano's Lake Titicaca Basin (Knudson and Price 2007). In the Cochabamba Valley of Bolivia, local modem and archaeological small mammal sam­ples from the archaeological site of Pifiami exhibit mean 87Sr/86Sr= .72148 ± .00162 (la, n = 4) (Lu­cas 2012). Finally, in the southern altiplano near Lake Poop6, modern faunal samples exhibit higher radiogenic strontium isotope values, such as 87Sr/86Sr = .7014 (Knudson et al. 2005). Modem and/or archaeological radiogenic strontium iso­tope baseline data are not yet available from northwestern Argentina and will be a fruitful area for future research.

Bioavailable Strontium Sources in the South-Central Andes 
The San Pedro de Atacama oases are agricultur­ally fertile, with reliable drinking water sources, and they most likely supplied the dietary stron­tium consumed and imbibed by the individuals who lived there during the Middle Horizon. Bio­geochemical and botanical paleodietary analyses from earlier Formative period (1500 B.C.-500 A.D.) sites in the Atacama Desert demonstrate a reliance on algarrobo (Prosopis spp.), with some access to marine fish, likely as individuals trav­eled to the coast (Knudson, Pestle et al. 2012; Torres-Rouff et al. 2012). However, isotopic pa­leodietary research at Middle Horizon sites in San Pedro de Atacama is ongoing, so we tum to the available botanical and faunal remains from San Pedro de Atacama cemeteries to help recon­struct paleodiet and likely strontium sources dur­ing the Middle Horizon. Botanical remains from cemeteries in the oases are dominated by algarr­obo (Prosopis spp.), with smaller amounts of maize (Zea mays) and chaiiar (Geoffrea decorticans) (Costa 1988). Faunal remains from mortuary con­texts include camelids (Lama glama and/or Vicugna pacos) (Costa 1988). It is probable that the greatest contributions to dietary strontium in individuals from the area would have been high­calcium terrestrial plants; while camelids were likely consumed, the meat would contribute very little strontium to the total diet, given its low strontium concentrations. The salt consumed was likely from local sources near the oases, or pos­sibly from the surrounding highlands, such as Gran Salinas in northwestern Argentina or the Salar de Uyuni in Bolivia. However, there is very little evidence for the consumption of marine products in San Pedro de Atacama itself, which would exhibit 87Sr/'6Sr = .7092 (Veizer 1989). Fi­nally, water sources in San Pedro de Atacama are generally derived from a large and isotopically homogeneous groundwater aquifer system and from rivers and streams that carry precipitation from higher altitudes (Boschetti et al. 2007; Hous­ton 2006a, 2006b; Magaritz et al. 1990; Nester et al. 2007). 
Definitions of "Local" and "Non-Local" Values 
One of the important challenges for scholars using biogeochemical techniques to better understand paleomobility is distinguishing "local" individuals from "non-locals" (Knudson 2011). There are a growing number of complementary approaches that can be used to define the "local" radiogenic strontium isotope signature for a given geologic zone or zones. As previously discussed, small ar­chaeological and/or modem mammals can give a very good sense of the 87Sr/86Sr values in bioavailable strontium in a given region. Defining the "local" range as the mean 87Sr/86Sr value of small mammal samples and adding and subtract­ing two standard deviations generally gives a large, and conservative, "local" range (Bentley et al. 2004; Evans and Tatham 2004; Price et al. 2002). Using this definition, the "local" range in the San Pedro de Atacama oases is 87Sr/8°Sr 
= 
.7074-.7079 (Knudson and Price 2007). In con­trast, the "local" range for the southeastern Lake Titicaca Basin, the area around the site of Ti­wanaku, is 87Sr/86Sr .7087-.7 105 (Knudson and 
= 
Price 2007). 
Descriptive statistics can also be used to eval­uate the extent of a "local" population, since one population consuming the same strontium source or sources would be expected to exhibit normally distributed 87Sr/86Sr values (Wright 2005). There­fore, a population that contains outlying "non­local" values would be non-normally distributed, and removing the proposed "non-local" values would give a more normally distributed popula­tion (Wright 2005). More recently, Tung and Knudson (2011) proposed an examination of the natural breaks in a dataset as a way of separating "locals" from "non-locals." When the difference between adjacent radiogenic strontium isotope values, arranged in ascending order, is calculated, one would expect to see the biggest difference between the "local" population and any outlying "non-locals" (Tung and Knudson 2011). By using multiple, independent, and complementary defi­nitions of "local" ranges, a more clear identifica­tion of the "non-local" individuals in a population can be obtained (Knudson 20 I I).

Materials and Methods 
Here, we analyze the Middle Horizon cemeteries 
of Casa Parroquial (MNI = 22), Larache (MNI = 
50), Quitor-5 (MNI = 181), Solcor Plaza (MNI = 
78), Solor-3 (MNI = 75), and Tchecar Tumulo 
Sur (MNI = 202). We also collected additional 
samples from the previously analyzed cemeteries 
of Coyo Oriental, Coyo-3, and Solcor-3 (Knudson 
and Price 2007). For each cemetery, at least 15 
percent of the mortuary population was randomly 
selected for inclusion. When possible, multiple enamel and bone samples forming at different times during life were collected in order to un­derstand changes in paleomobility throughout the life course (Supplemental Tables l and 2). 
At the Archaeological Chemistry Laboratory at Arizona State University (ASU), samples were mechanically and chemically cleaned with a se­ries of weak acetic acid washes to reduce diage­netic contamination (Nielsen-Marsh and Hedges 2000; Price et al. 1992; Sillen and LeGros 1991). Strontium was separated from the sample matrix using EiChrom SrSpec crown-ether resin. Sam­ples were analyzed using a Thermo-Finnigan multi-collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (MC-ICP-MS) in the ASU W.M. Keck Foundation Laboratory for Environmental Biogeochemistry, where recent analyses of SRM­987 yielded 87Sr/86Sr = .71029 ± .00003 (2cr, n 
= 
10). A subset of samples was analyzed for major, minor, and trace elemental concentrations to as­sess the degree of diagenetic contamination in the dataset. Approximately 10 mg of tooth enamel powder or chemically cleaned bone ash were dis­solved in .64 ml of 5 M HN03, and diluted with 
9 .36 ml of Millipore H20. These data were gen­erated using a Thermo-Finnigan quadrupole in­ductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (Q­ICP-MS) in the ASU W.M. Keck Foundation Laboratory for Environmental Biogeochemistry, where mean Ca/P = 2.18 ± .01 (2cr, n = 5) for ACL standard CUE-0001. 
Results from Biogeochemical Analyses 
For individuals in Middle Horizon San Pedro de Atacama cemeteries, mean enamel and bone '7Sr/86Sr = .70834 ± .00172 (2cr, n = 273) (Sup­plemental Tables 1 and 2). By cemetery, mean data (all 2cr) are as follows: Casa Parroquial 87Sr/86Sr = .70835 ± .00175 (n = 36), Coyo Oriental 87Sr/86Sr = .70771 ± .00024 (n 17), Coyo-3

(Table 1). A subset of samples were analyzed for major, minor, and trace elemental concentrations in order to better understand diagenetic contami­nation; for these samples, mean Ca/P= 2.14 ± .05 (2cr, n = 29). 
Discussion 
Evidence for Biogenic Data from San Pedro de Atacama 
To date, no diagenetic contamination has been identified in archaeological human enamel or bone from San Pedro de Atacama (Knudson and Price 2007). In addition to the major, minor, and trace elemental concentration data generated for previously published datasets (Knudson and Price 2007), we generated new data for a subset of samples (Table 2). Since mean Ca/P = 2.14 ± .05 (2cr, n 29), which is similar to biogenic bone 
= 
and enamel where Ca/P = 2.1, we argue that there is no evidence for diagenetic contamination in the San Pedro de Atacama cemetery samples an­alyzed here. This is perhaps not surprising, given the extreme aridity, where many human remains are naturally mummified and organic preservation is excellent, although site hydrology is not the only factor in diagenetic contamination. Addi­tionally, as discussed above, dietary strontium sources are likely local to the oases. Therefore, we interpret radiogenic strontium isotope data from archaeological human remains in San Pedro de Atacama cemeteries as reflecting geographic origins.
