Warfarewasaprevalent phenomenon throughout theAndes duringthe Late Intermediateperiod(LIP;AD 1000–1450). A salient research topic within broader investigations of con.ict is how populations cope with chronic warfare. This article utilizes statisticaland GIS-based analysesofarchitecturalfeaturesand settlement patternstoreconstructdefensive coping mechanisms among groups living in 15 forti.ed settlements in the Nazca region of Peru. This research evaluates how populations deployed arti.cialdefenses(forti.cations), natural defensibility, and settlementplacementtobestprotect themselvesand criticalresourcesfrom enemyincursions.Intersite variationinforti.cationwas primarily drivenbypopulation size:the smallest and most vulnerablesettlements were themostheavily forti.ed and occupied the least accessible areas.

groups utilized arti.cial defenses (forti.cations), natural defensibility, and settlement locations to guardagainst enemyincursions. 
Defensive sites and features are the physical manifestationsof defensivestrategies. Archaeol­ogists cannot directly observe prehistoric defen­sive strategies, but they can reconstruct such strategiesbyinterpretingvariationsinthe design, investment, and distribution of defensive sites and features. By developing and testing mod­els that predict what empirical patterns should be observed if a particular defensive strat­egy was utilized, scholars gain the ability to explainprehistoric systemsofdefense. Through this research process, archaeologists can better understandthe complexanddiverseways people in the past adapted to chronic warfare and the decisions involved in defensivepractices (Field 2008). This research program is oriented toward agrowing body of literature that critically eval­uates the connection between human con.ict and defensive strategies. The goal of this pro­gram is to understand how prehistoric warfare shaped human societies and the mechanisms by which violence was, and is, perpetuated or mitigated (Arkush 2011;Field2008;Martindale and Supernant 2009; Roscoe 2016; Smith and Cochrane 2011).To this end,Ievaluateexplana­tory models of defensive practices using the southernAndes asa casestudy, and followthis with a discussion of patterns of warfare in the region. 
Investigations were conductedat15LIPsites inthe uppervalleysofthesouthernNazcaregion (Upper SNR) of Peru(Figure1). Statistical and GIS analyses were performed on intra-and intersite variation in defenses and settlement patterns. Macrospatial patternsare discussedin termsofthe relationship between defensivesites and socioeconomic resources. Abriefsummary of LIP culture-history and the region being investigated is presented .rst to provide neces­sary context, followed by an overview of the justi.cations forclassifyingthesesettlementsas defensive sites related to warfare. 


TheLateIntermediatePeriod 
The LIP falls temporally between the Middle 
Horizon(AD 600–1000), dominatedbytheWari 

Empire in the central highlands, and the Late Horizon(AD 1450–1532), de.nedbytheCuzco­based Inca Empire.The LIPinthe Nazca region began shortly after the decline and collapse of theWariEmpire, sometimearound thelatetenth centuryAD(Schreiber 1992),whenit left behind apowervacuum anda populationthat had been under some form of Wari control for centuries (Conlee 2004;Schreiber1992). Thelast decade of researchhas producedalargebodyofevidence that characterizes theLIP asa timemarkedby endemicwarfare (Arkush2005, 2006;Arkush andTung 2013;BrownVega 2009;Julien2003). Bioarchaeological data demonstratethat violent traumawas more pronouncedduringtheLIPthan inanyother periodinAndean prehistory(Arkush andTung 2013;Kurin 2012; Schjellerup 1997; Tung 2008; Verano 2003). It was also a time of political turmoil, as polities decentralized and populations spread from large centers to form smaller, more balkanized sociopolitical institu­tions (Conlee 2004, 2010;Conlee and Schreiber 2006;Covey 2008;Parsons et al.2000). Power becamediffuse and heterarchical, mostly dom­inated by local war chiefs whose power and authority were limited, fragile, and based upon success in warfare (Arkush and Stanish 2005; D’Altroy 1992;Earle 1997;Julien2003). Settle­ment patterns reveal that defensibility was often of paramount concern to LIP groups (Arkush 2006;Brown Vega 2009; Covey 2008;Earle 2001; Julien 1993; Stanish 1992; Vogel 2012). These differ substantially from those of the MiddleHorizon, representinga relatively homo­geneous adaptationtothe dramatic changes that took place (Arkush andTung 2013;Bauer and Kellett2010;Kellett2010).Forti.ed hilltopsites (hillforts) emerged as a widespread settlement pattern of highland LIP communities and among some coastal populations (Arkush 2006;Arkush andTung 2013;Conlee2004:214;Covey 2008; Kurin 2016:51;Vogel 2012:162, 163). 
Causalexplanations forLIPwarfarevaryby region, but generally pertain to climate drivers or sociopolitical imperatives. Scholarswhohave notedalag between the collapseoftheWari and Tiwanaku states and the outbreak of endemic warfare argue that state collapse and the resul­tant sociopolitical turmoil were not the ultimate driversof warfare (Arkush 2011;Kellett2010).

Instead, climatic change leading to decreased precipitation is seen as the primary culprit for pushing groups into con.ictoverscarce land and other economic resources (Abbott et al. 1997; Arkush 2008;Kellett2010;Seltzer and Hastorf 1990; Torres-Rouff and Costa 2006). Others proposethat the political instability thatwasthe outcomeofWari andTiwanaku collapseled to increased political competition, ethnic tensions, and factionalism (Arkush 2008;Earle 1997; Kolata1993;Kurin 2012). Theseprocessesthen drove con.ict over limited positions of political power, ethnic hatreds, and key socioeconomic resources. Whatever the cause, many scholars agree that the internecine warfare that de.ned the LIP became an engine of factionalism that effectively prevented the formation of multire­gional politiesthat mighthavebeen abletounify competing groups (Arkush 2011;Earle 2001). Patterns of intense con.ict persisted until the spreadof theInca Empirein themid–AD 1400s and their forced paci.cation strategy known to us as the Pax Inca (D’Altroy 2002). Whether oneof theseprocesses ledtotheinitiationand perpetuation of warfare in the southern Nazca region remainstobeseen,andwillbethetopic of future investigations. 
TheLIPinthesouthernNazcaregionis char­acterized by transformations that echo broader LIP patterns, and include intergroup con.ict, demographicinstability,volatile and heterarchi­cal political structures, and the termination of centralized ritual and monumental construction (Conlee 2003,2010;Conlee and Schreiber2006; Silverman 2002). Most of these insights come from research conducted by Christina Conlee at several LIP sites in the region. Her work has shown that Nazca populations ceased the constructionoflarge monuments and refocused ritual activitiestolocalized, perhaps site-speci.c, scales (Conlee 2004).Severalof the sitesCon­lee investigated contain defensive features and piles of sling stones, suggesting the existence of con.ict (Conlee 2003, 2004, 2015). Estab­lished power structures focused on heterarchi­cal relationships, with a conspicuous absence

of traditional displays of status (Conlee 2004). Demographic dataindicate unstable population .uctuations, with a total abandonment of the region in the early LIP (Conlee 2003; Con-lee and Schreiber 2006; Schreiber and Lancho 1995). The region was gradually repopulated during the middle and late LIP and eventually saw the transition to a dense and highly aggre­gatedregional population(Browne1992;Conlee 2004).Environmental changes ledtoincreased aridity, prolonged water shortages, and con­comitant resource scarcity (Binford et al. 1997; Conlee 2015;Fehren-Schmitz et al.2014;Hillyer et al. 2009). Thesefactorsmayhave been partly responsibleforthe abandonmentoftheregionin the earlyLIP,andwouldhaveputapremiumon maintaining and defending arableland (Conlee 2015).Thesesocial, political, and environmental dynamics combinedto renderthesouthernNazca regionprimedfor con.ict,makingitanexcellent case study to investigate warfare and defensive strategies. 
The Upper SNR and its Hillforts 
TheUpper SNR encompasses.verivervalleys that form the southern drainage of the Río Grande de Nazca. The region is bordered by theCoastalSNRto thewest,at thefootof the valleys; the Lucanas region in the sierra to the east; the Acarí valley to the south; and the uppervalleysofthe centralNazcaregiontothe north(Figure1).Situated along thechaupiyunga (1,200–2,500 m asl) and quechua (2,500–3,300 masl)vegetation zones,theUpperSNRstraddles the coastaland sierravertical ecologies(Denevan 2001).Runningdownthevalleys are.vestreams that discharge a negligible volume of water and are prone to desiccation during the dry season (O.cina Nacional de Evaluación de Recursos Naturales[ONERN] 1971). Upper SNRvalleys aresteep, narrow,and boulder-strewn, restricting substantial human occupations to several pockets of open land known colloquially as cabezadas. Cabezadas are de.ned as the open areas of terrain with gradual topographycompared to the otherwise steep valleys. The cabezadas are the onlyareasin theUpper SNRwheresubstantial agricultureis possibleduetotheirrelativelygen­tle slopes, potentialfor irrigation, and seasonal precipitation from December through March (ONERN 1971). The cabezadas are situated roughly2,000to3,000masland rapidlygainele­vationasthey extend east. They aresurrounded by the puna,a high plainthatextends east across the continentaldivide into thesierra.The puna is an ideal environment for herding due to its .at topography and abundant grasslands (Parsons et al. 1997). The puna in the Upper SNR is not viablefor agriculture due to high elevations, frost potential, and unsuitability for irrigation. Thus, the cabezadas represent aprime example of ecological circumscription, being the only areasin theUpper SNRsuitablefor agriculture and thus substantial human occupation(Carneiro 1970). These factors combine to concentrate agricultural zones—and human occupations— into clearly de.ned, resource-dense patches sur­rounded by areas devoid of crops and large human settlements. 
Thisinvestigationfocuses on15 LIPhillforts in the cabezadas of Aja,TierrasBlancas,Taruga, Chauchilla, and LasTrancas.The Aja cabezada contains two hillfort sites, Cerro Anamarca and Ayaorcco. The Tierras Blancas cabezada contains .ve hillfort sites: Ayapata, Ayapata East, Cerro Pucara, Cerro Leoncio, and Cerro Tarachallyu. TheTarugacabezada contains two hillforts, Cruz Pata and Toma. The Chauchilla cabezada contains four hillforts:CerroAyapata, Cerro Amayo, Chuluja, and Llaghua. The Las Trancas cabezada contains two hillfort sites, Cerro Chillca and Cerro Tribolpata. Ayaorcco, CerroLeoncio, and Llaghua have been heavily impacted by local land-use practices, and as a result were included only in the settlement pattern analysis. 
Each settlement exhibits a high density of residentialstructuresand domestic artifacts, indi­cating that the Upper SNR settlements were permanently occupied residential sites rather than refuges.Thereis currently noevidence for nonforti.ed LIPsettlementsinthe region, indi­catingthat thehillfort adaptationwas ubiquitous throughout theUpper SNR. 
TheLIP designationwas assignedto eachof thesehillforts based on diagnostic artifacts and features from surveys. Theseinclude ceramics, rounded residential architecture, aboveground tombs (chullpas), hilltop settlement locations, lack of differentiation in the size and quality

of residences, the practice of human cranial modi.cation, and thelackofabundant materials diagnostic of previous or subsequent periods (Conlee 2003,2010;Conlee and Schreiber2006; Hyslop 1976; Parsons et al. 2000). It should be noted, however, that excavations have not yet been conducted, leaving open the possibility that the hillforts contain pre-LIP sequences in subsurface strata. 


DeterminingDefensibility 
Several architectural features have been shown to indicate universal defensive functions (see Keeley et al. 2007). These include V-shaped ditches, bastions, and baf.ed entryways.Defen­sivewalls areotherexcellent indicatorsofdefen­sive design (Arkush and Stanish 2005; Haas 2001; LeBlanc 1999). The geographic location of settlements and surrounding resources may indicate a defensive function. Occupations on hilltops or along cliff lines, the placement of settlementsinareas that possess restricted access to resources or population centers, and the ability ofgroupsto monitortravelcorridorsand resource patches are all potential indicators of defense. All15 sitesinthe study areaexhibit natural and constructed defensivefeatures. 
Multiple concentricstonewalls surround each of the settlement’s residential sectors. In each case, thereislittleevidenceof occupationorland use between, or outside of,thewalls,indicating that they functioned as defenses rather than agricultural terraces or supports for residential expansion. The defensivewalls aresubstantially thicker and more robust than thewalls that make up the residential architecture. As reported in the next section, the defensive walls are empha­sized along the most accessible parts of the residential sectors and deemphasized or absent in areas with adequate natural defensibility.All sites are located on hilltops at elevations above the primary farming zones. The approaches to these sites are dif.cult and require climbing steep slopes. The nucleated hilltop settlements imposed substantialtravelcosts on residents, as accesstothe agricultural zonesandwatersources was rendered more dif.cult. 
In addition to the ubiquitous defensive fea­tureslocated throughout theUpper SNRhillforts, there are defensive attributes that are unique to each settlement. I describe these attributes in detail to better contextualize each settlement’s defenses. 
In the Aja cabezada, the site Cerro Ana­marca contains multiple discrete stone walls that are abutted along the easiest approach by exterior ditches that still exhibit stone lining along some stretches.Severalof thesestonewalls areoverfour meters tall.Ayaorcco, whileheavily impactedby taphonomic processes, stillexhibits multiple discrete stone walls with large stone-backed ditchesabuttingthewalls’exterior. Both settlements are highly nucleated and are arrayed along ridgelines thatface steep slopes and cliffs in manyplaces. 
InTierrasBlancas,the siteAyapata contains an interior east-facing bastion with an earthen parapet(Figure2).Twostone walls run along the site perimeter, with an additional exterior stonewallatthe baseofthe hillandseveralditch systemsrunning paralleltothewalls(Figure3). Segments of these walls are more than two meters thick, with several intact sections over threemetershigh.Ayapataspreads alongalow hill with cliffs on one side on a plateau 700 m above the primary farmland and waterway. Cerro Pucara is also heavily defended by sev­eral stonewalls surrounding thesettlement.The settlement itself is spread along two separate knollsandaconnectingsaddleonasmallplateau above themain agricultural zone. BothAyapata East and Cerro Leoncio contain several con­centric stone walls surrounding the residential sector and earthen ramparts curving around the site perimeter. Cerro Tarachallyu is one of the most heavily forti.ed sites, with three discrete concentric stone walls fronted by deep stone-lined ditches that wrap around the site perimeter (Figure4). Thesewalls areinmanyinstances on nearly .at ground and are two to three meters thickinplaces.The site itselfstretches alonga narrowridgelinethatfaces steep slopes and cliffs exceptfortwoconstricted approachesthat funnel directly into theforti.cation and ditchfeatures.

Both CruzPataandToma lie on hilltops that render the farms and water systemsless accessibletohillfortresidents. Cruz Patais locatedaboveand outsideofthecabezada, which would have required substantial travel times to reach the agricultural .elds and water sources. 
In theChauchillavalley, CerroAyapata con­tains a V-shaped stone-backed ditch and two distinct stone walls circumvallating the set­tlement(Figure6). Enemies approaching from the northeast—the easiest approach—wouldbe forced to crosstheV-shaped ditch and traverse an unoccupied zone approximately 100 m wide before reaching the double-wall system. Cerro Amayo contains four distinct stone walls, sev­eral over two meters thick. The northern sec­tor exhibits a double-baf.ed entryway that is restricted to such an extent that people can only enter the residential sector in single .le. This settlementissoheavily forti.edthatnearlyallthe residences are denselyclusteredand restrictedto thesmall conical hilltoplocated within thewall system.Chuluja contains anexteriorwall along parts of the residential perimeter, and a large interior wall cutting off the eastern approach. The unforti.ed southeastern sector is located on a steep slope, which is the least accessible approach. Llaghua, while heavily impacted by modern land-use practices, still contains three to four visible stone walls, each curving around partsofthesettlement’sperimeter.Severalofthe intact wall segments are over four meters high and severalmetersthick. 
In the Las Trancas valley, Cerro Chillca contains multiple concentric stone walls that are fronted by ditches that wrap around the residential sector. Cerro Tribolpata shares sim­ilar architectural features. Multiple stone walls circumvallate the perimeter and severalditches span the easiest approach to the site. 
The accumulated weight of evidence leads to theinterpretationthat thesesiteswere defensive in nature. These populations expended consid­erable time and energy to live in defensible nucleated settlements with substantial natural and arti.cial defensivefeatures.This conclusion

in turn leads to an analysis of the defensive strategies deployed by the populations living in the region and how these practices related to those observedinother areas. 


IntrasiteForti.cationAnalysis 
Numerous studies have demonstrated substan­tial intrasite variation in forti.cation features (Arkush and Stanish 2005;Best 1975;Best 1993; Field 1998; Fox 1978; LeBlanc 1999; Prickett 1980).Researchersinmanyregionshave producedasimilarexplanatorymodel,proposing that intrasite variation in forti.cation is driven largely by accessibility, whereby forti.cations are emphasized along the easiest approaches to a settlement, and deemphasized or absent in areas with adequate natural defenses (Allen 2006; Arkush 2011; Arkush and Stanish 2005; Best 1993;Firth1927;Fox 1976;Prickett1980; Solometo 2006).Despite the nearly global recog­nition of the relationship between accessibility and defensivedesign,thislinkhasyettobe tested quantitatively, and has instead been inferred through visual observation and description. The analysis presented hereisthe .rst to assess this association using quantitative methods. If this explanationof variationinintrasite forti.cation is supported,I expect differentialforti.cationto beafunctionofaccessibility. 
Methods 
To test the relationship between accessibility and differentialforti.cation, statistical and GIS-based analyses were performed on 11 hill-forts where reliable forti.cation data could be obtained. Quantitative methods currently exist for measuring defenses (e.g., Arkush 2011:147; Martindale and Supernant 2009). These meth­ods record various defensive features at a site to create a single composite defensive score for each site. These methods allow researchers to evaluate differences in defensive investment between settlements,buttheydonot allowfor an assessment of intrasite variationinforti.cation. Theforti.cationscore(FS) and slope score(SS) methodsdeveloped here permitthe assessmentof variationinforti.cationwithin each site,allow­ingmoreinformationon defensivestrategiesto be obtained. 
To measure intrasite variation, forti.cation features at each site were mapped using a Trimble GeoXM GPS and then georeferenced ontoanASTER DEMof30 m resolutionusing ArcMap 10.2toformawall mapof the site— avisual displayofhillfortforti.cationfeatures (Figure7). The residential sectors were also mappedand georeferenced.Tomeasurevariation in forti.cation within each hillfort, sites were divided into quadrants, each pertainingtoa car­dinal direction(in this case, NE,NW, SE,SW). Each quadrantwasthen furtherdivided radially into four equal-sized subquadrants in order to best demarcate the differences in forti.cation features within each hillfort. Intrasite variation in forti.cation was measured by quantifying the number of forti.cation features in each sub-quadrant. Each segment of a defensive wall or ditchwas assignedaseparatescoreof0.25for every quarterofa subquadrant thefeature passes through.Forexample,ifawall passesthrough 75% of a subquadrant, it received a score of 0.75, or 0.25 if it passes through only 25% of a subquadrant. Any defensive features that pass through less than 25% of a subquadrant received a scoreof zero. The aggregateofthese scoreswascoded as thesubquadrant forti.cation score(Figure7). TheFS methodis used asa relative measure of differences in forti.cation, rather thanan absolutemeasureoftimeorenergy investment. 
Aslope raster was generated usingArcMap 
10.2 as a proxy for accessibility. This proxy is justi.able becausethe approaches running up to each hillfort’s defenses and residentialsector are naturallydevoidof movement-restrictingvegeta­tion and other potential obstacles that might have altered accessibility. Settlements surrounded by densevegetation, bodiesofwater,or other natural or physical barriers require measurements other than slope to determine accessibility.The slope score method is not based on the assumption that accessibility changes linearly asafunction of slope(Van Leusen 2002:6–7,8).Rather,this method assumes that barring other obstacles, relative slope values determined whether forti­.cations were required to limit access to the interior residential sectors. In settlement sec­tors where slope values were suf.ciently high, investment in forti.cations may be lessened or

unnecessary.Conversely, when slopevalues are low, forti.cations may be required to reduce accessibility (Llobera 2000:71). 
The average slope for each subquadrant was calculated for a 200 m buffer around the res­idential sector of each hillfort(Figure8). The 200mbufferrepresentsthe immediate approach toahillfort’sresidentialsector and corresponds to how dif.cult it would have been for a com­batant to gain access to the population centers. Abufferdistanceof 200mwas selectedin order to provide a minimum 50 to 100 m zone from themostexterior defensivefeaturetotheendof thebuffer,whichrepresentsthe furthesteffective range of the slings that were the predominant projectile weapon duringthe LIP(BrownVega and Craig 2009;Keeleyet al.2007). 
To produce the slope of each subquadrant, shape.les were created that incorporatetheentire area fromthe innermost defensivefeaturetothe furthestextent of thebuffer(indicated by the hatched areasin Figure8).Theaverageslopefor each of the shape.les was calculated in degrees from0 to90 usingZonal StatisticsinArcMap

If intrasite variation in forti.cation is a function of accessibility, I expect the FS to be predicted by SS. To test this relationship, correlation and ordinary least-squares (OLS) regression analyses were performed for each of thehillfortsin thesample. Statistical testswere runseparatelyforeach hillfortinorderto identify which sites met the test expectation and which did not.

Thereasons forthisexcep­tionareasyet unclear.Cerro Anamarca appears toexhibitthe most defensivefeatures along the least accessible sector of the settlement. This deviation fromthe broader regional pattern may betheresultofhistoricand moderndevelopment, which is clustered on and around the easiest approachtothesiteandmayhavedestroyedsev­eral defensivefeaturesinthat area.Itisalso possi­blethat residentsofCerro Anamarca hadfactors other than slopein mind when constructingtheir defenses. What is clear is that accessibility, as measuredbySS,isthebestpredictorof intrasite variation in forti.cation across the region as a whole—supportingtheexpectationsofthemodel that intrasite variation in forti.cation is driven primarily by accessibility. 


IntersiteForti.cationAnalysis 
An equally important question is why some hillfortsaremoreheavily forti.edthan others.Of thehillfortsinvestigated,several containthreeto four defensivewallsin quadrantswiththe easiest approach (Cerro Chillca and Ayapata), while others contain only one or two defensive walls (Cerro Pucara and Cerro Ayapata). Additional analysis wasrequiredto explainthis variationin intersite forti.cation.

Three explanatory models have been pro­posed from different regions of the world to account for intersite variation in forti.cation. The .rst model was produced by Elizabeth Arkush(2011:150–151), who found that inter­sitevariationinforti.cation was driven largely by differences in population size among LIP hillforts in the Lake Titicaca Basin. The most heavily forti.ed sites had large populations that could be mobilized to build and maintain for­ti.cations. Smaller settlements invested less in defenses because they could rely on alliances with larger neighborswho ralliedtotheir defense when under threat. The second model, pro­posed by Steven LeBlanc to explain variation in Late Period (post–AD 1250) forti.ed sites of the American Southwest (1999:200–203), also saw population size determining variability in intersite forti.cation. LeBlanc argues that settlements with the smallest relative popula­tionsizes constructed more substantial defensive features to compensate for their vulnerability. Julie Field’s(1998:46, 51–52) model to account for differences between forti.ed sites among prehistoric Fijiangroups states that forti.cations were emphasized among settlements that were located on less defensible landforms near large tracts of arable land, where arti.cial defenses were required to compensate for the lack of natural defensibility. This model implies that variation in intersite forti.cation is in part a product of overall accessibility to a site rather than population size. To test whether any of thesemodels applytothe Upper SNR, statistical analyses were conducted using the estimated populationsizesof thehillforts and modi.edFS and SS. 
Methods 
UnlikeArkush(2011:148), who had used site size asaroughbuteffectivemeasurefor popula­tionsize,I use residentialarea(RA)in hectares for the Upper SNR because the areas between theinterior andexterior defensivewalls were not occupied. RA is a reasonable and more reliable metric due to the dense clustering of houses within the defensive con.nes, and the lack of residences outside nucleated centers.Asummed forti.cationscore(SFS) andaverage combined slope score (CSS) were produced to account for differences in forti.cation and accessibility between hillforts.TheSFSis calculatedforeach hillfort by totaling the values of each site’s subquadrants forti.cation scores. The CSS for each hillfort is the average of all of the site’s subquadrantsslope scores. Thesemethods pro­vide singleforti.cation and slope scores for each site, permittingintersite analysistobeconducted. Usingthesemethods,itis possibletotestwhich, if any,of the above modelsexplainthevariation in intersite forti.cationinthe Upper SNR.If the expectationsofamodel are correct,I expectto see strong or signi.cant relationships between one or moreof theindependentvariables (CSS andRA)andthe dependentvariable(SFS). 
The .rst test will determine whether popu­lation sizedrivesintersite variationinforti.ca­tion.I expect that either (1)as populationsizes increase,theamountof forti.cationfeatureswill also increase ateach site (Arkush model); or (2) as populationsizes increase, forti.cation scores will decrease(LeBlanc model). Thesecond test will determine if increased overall accessibil­ity is driving variation in intersite forti.cation (Field model).Iexpect that asahillfort’soverall accessibility increases (lower CSS),forti.cation scores will also increase. 
Results 
Initial results from the .rst analysis reveal that Chuluja is a signi.cant outlier that falls well outside the trend of all other hillforts in the sample. With Chuluja removed, a signi.cant negative correlation exists between RA and SFS

(r =-0.787), demonstrating that sites with smaller residential areas have larger summed forti.cation scores, and conversely, sites with larger residential areas exhibit smaller SFS. In addition, RA is a signi.cant predictor of SFS (r2 =0.620; p=0.004; SupplementaryMaterial, Figure 13). 
CSS and SFS results also revealed Chu­luja to be a signi.cant outlier. With Chuluja removed, a signi.cant positive correlation was found between CSS and SFS (r =0.739), which refutes the assumption of Field’s model that accessibility drives intersite variability in forti.cation. That is, the least accessible sites are also the most heavily forti.ed. An OLS regression analysis was performed and results show CSS is a signi.cant predictor of SFS (r2 =0.546; p=0.009; SupplementaryMaterial, Figure 14).This unexpected resultis considered in thediscussion section. 
Finally, a multiple OLS regression was per­formedto seehowmuchofthevariationinSFS is accounted forby the combinedRA and CSS variables.Results showthat thetwoindependent variables account for over 75% of the variation in SFS acrossthe sitesinthe region(r2 =0.757; p=0.004).Thisresultshows that the combined variables are signi.cant predictors of intersite variationinforti.cation and are abletoexplain the vast majority of variation in forti.cation designs acrossthe Upper SNRhillforts. 
To summarize, results indicate that (1) pop­ulation size is a signi.cant driver of intersite variationinforti.cation, whereby smaller pop­ulations constructed signi.cantly more forti.ca­tionfeatures than theirlarger neighbors; and (2) less accessible sites are more heavily forti.ed than their more accessible neighbors. These results most closely align with LeBlanc’s model (LeBlanc1999)and contraststarklywith patterns in theLIP LakeTiticaca Basin(Arkush 2011). Statistical results show the opposite trend from that predictedby theField(1998)model. 


SettlementPattern Analysis 
Theselectionofa settlement locationisdictated by trade-offs between competing variables, any one or combination of which can in.uence the decision to settle in a particular place. Ideal defensive locations exhibit qualities such as natural defensibility,large viewsheds, and close proximityto critical resourcesor allies(Ruaetal. 2013;Smith and Cochrane2011).Fewlocations exhibit all these features, however, requiring people to make trade-offs between them. This decision-making processisexamined at thehill­fort sites using macrospatial patterns and GIS-based analyses.The positionof each hillfortis used to infer possible cost-bene.t decisions made by the resident populations, with the goal of parsing which factors were the most important for determining settlement locations.Statistical analyses were performed to assess whether large viewsheds were signi.cant factors in.uencing settlement locations. 
All 15 settlements are located on hilltops and ridges that provide reasonably .at areas for residential occupations and steep topographyfor much of the surrounding approaches. At least 50%of each hillfort perimeterfaces steep slopes of 60 degrees or more. These spatial factors indicatethat defensible topographywasacritical factor for determining settlement locations.Nev­ertheless, the region contains numerous defensi­blehilltopsand ridgelinesfromwhichto choose, so what made one location more desirable than another? 
The proximity of settlements to agricultural zones and water sources would have been a signi.cant constraint on settlement placement decisions. Every hillfort is located within one kilometerofthe nearest agricultural zone. Many of the largest hillforts are located at choke points where the narrow valleys open up into the cabezadas, which contain vital agricultural .elds.The positionofthesehillfortswouldhave severely restricted passage into the cabezadas by forcing humantraf.ctopassdirectly through,or in close proximity to, the forti.ed settlements. These dataindicatethat groups selected hilltop locations that conferred extensive natural defen­sibilitybutalso permittedreasonabletraveltimes to the agricultural zones, and provided residents with the ability to control movement within and into the agricultural zones.

andvarious statistical tests.Viewsheds produce binomial data (0 to 1) from a source point, where0representsraster cells that are not visible to the source point and 1 represents visible cells.Viewshed outputswereusedtoassess the ability of each hillfort population to monitor surrounding country, neighboring hillforts, and resource zones. To test whether hilltops were selected for their visibility potential, a set of 50 random points was created in the study area usingArcMap 10.2.Viewsheds were generated for each of the 50 random points and were compared to the viewsheds of all 15 hillforts using two-sample Kolmogorov–Smirnov (KS) tests and Mann-Whitney U tests. TheKS anal­ysis essentially testswhether two nonparametric datasetshavesigni.cantlydifferent distributions, while theMann-Whitney Ustatisticisusedto test whether one of the two nonparametric samples hasalarger medianvaluethan theother.These tests determine whether the hillfort viewsheds aresigni.cantly larger thanwouldbeexpected if they were situated randomly in relation to viewshed (Arkush 2011). If hillfort viewshed sizes are signi.cantly larger than the viewshed sizesoftherandom points,thiswillshowthatthe hillforts areplacedin locations with someof the largest viewsheds in the region, indicating that the ability to observe the surrounding areas was an importantvariablefor settlement decisions. 
Results 
BeforeI reportthe statistical results,I describe macroscale viewshed observations to highlight three regional patterns. First, viewsheds cover the areas in direct proximity to the agricultural zones and hillforts, permitting populations to observeimmediate approaches. Second, hillforts are capable of observing other hillforts within the cabezadas, but not those in neighboring cabezadas.Third,mostofthe hillforts are unable to observe large parts of the agricultural zones. 
Resultsof theKSand Mann-Whitney Utests show that the distribution of hillfort viewsheds is signi.cantly different from(larger than) the random-point viewsheds (KS test critical D = 0.513; p = 0.002; Mann-Whitney U test W = 564; one-sided p = 0.001).Despite this signi.­cance, previous studies have correctly noted that thelarge viewsheds commonly associated with defensivesitesmaybean artifactof theirhigh elevationlocations rather thanaproactivedefen­sivestrategy(Van Leusen 1999).To test whether thiswasthe caseamong the15hillforts,a subset of42 random pointsthatexhibitelevations equal to or higher than the hillfort sites were taken from the original sample and tested using two-sample KS and Mann-Whitney U tests. Results con.rmthat thedistributionofhillfortviewsheds is signi.cantly different from (larger than) the viewsheds from the subset of random points (KS test critical D = 0.53; p = 0.002; Mann-Whitney Utest W= 145; one-sided p= 0.001; SupplementaryMaterial, Figure 15).Thisresult indicates that certain hilltops were selected for occupation if they provided large viewsheds, presumably for the purpose of improving the ability to monitor travel corridors and possible avenues of attack by enemy forces. The fact that much of the agricultural zone could not be observed suggests that it was more important to monitorthe approaches to thefarming areas than the .elds themselves. This pattern is not surprising, since themajorityof residentswould have been involved in agricultural activities and wouldhave been abletosupervise their .elds,at least during daytime hours. 
Results indicate key defensive trade-offs dictating regional settlement patterns. Upper SNR populations were highly discriminating in their settlement decisions, selecting certain locales from among a host of alternative options that maximize defensive bene.ts and minimize defensive costs. Similar settlement patterns are reportedinother regions and perhaps represent common adaptations to chronicwarfare (Arkush 2011;Field1998, 2008).

by clustering residences into small, con.ned areas.These costs originate fromincreased travel times to and from agricultural .elds that could otherwise be avoided by dispersed residential distributions (LeBlanc 1999:70, 295). These cramped living conditions can also contami­nate water sources and increase the probability of disease transmission (Kurin 2016:174). The location of settlements on naturally defensible hilltops decreases accessibility for enemies and residents alike, while further increasing travel costs. The heavy forti.cations of the Upper SNR hillforts required substantial investment in construction and maintenance. These costs are highlighted when the defenses of each site are compared to all other types of architectural investments. 
Theforti.cations at each site arethe largest and most robust of all architectural features. Indeed, forti.cations likely represent the only construction projects that required investment and organization on a community-wide scale (Earle 1997). Aside from arti.cial defenses, the costliest constructions are nuclear family residences, .eldstone corrals, and small open­airplazas that areintermittently lined with uncut stone.Forthe small-scale communitieslivingin themarginalfarming ecologyoftheUpperSNR, high-investment defensivepracticeswould only be sustained if absolutely necessary (Arkush and Stanish 2005;ONERN1971). The existence of the extensive defensive features and settlement patternsimpliesthatUpperSNRgroups werenot simplyfacingan abstract threatof enemyattack, butrather,athreatsorealthat groupswerewilling to live in dense residential clusters on hard-to­reach hilltops,surroundedby multiple defensive walls and ditches. All of these sacri.ces were deemed necessary to protect people and critical resources from enemy groups. These patterns indicate that warfare was suf.ciently frequent and volatile to spur these defensive strategies. 
The small populations of the hillforts in the region, combined with decentralized politi­cal organization, suggestthat substantialforces could not be marshaled for organized territo­rial or expansionist aggressions. Instead, the observeddefensive patterns, combined with the lackof numbersrequiredtoformlargeoffensive coalitions, suggest that a pattern of endemic, perhaps internecine, warfare was likely. This interpretation is bolstered by ethnohistorical accountsthat describethe LIPinthe central and southernhighlands as being embroiledinchronic warfare organized by local war chiefs centered on single valleys or combined into multivalley confederacies.These narratives portraywarfare as ongoing localized con.icts, motivated by scarce resources and fragile political dynamics (Cieza de León 1985:6 [1553:2:iv]; Guamán Poma 2009[1615]:1:64; Monzón 1965 [1586]; Sarmiento 1988[1572]:46).Whileitis premature to speculate about the causes that mayhaveled to or perpetuated warfare in the Upper SNR, the combined datasuggestthat regionalwarfare was likely de.ned by internecine strife typical of manysmall-scalesocieties(Arkush and Allen 2006;Keeley1996). 
Deviationsfrom theField Model Expectations 
As shown in the intersite forti.cation results section, the trend between CSS and SFS is the opposite of the Field model expectation. This pattern initially appears to defy the cost-bene.t trade-off between accessibility and forti.cation investmentby showingthat theleast accessible hillfortsarealsothemostheavily forti.ed.How­ever, a close examination of the CSS and SFS data reveal that this association corroborates the other intersite forti.cation results (Supplemen­tary Material,Figure 14).The positive correla­tion betweenCSSandSFSisdrivenbytwohill­fort siteswiththelargestCSSandSFSvaluesand bytwohillfortsiteswith thelowestCSS and SFS values. The two hillforts with the largest CSS and SFS values exhibit the smallest and third-smallest RA values (Cerro Amayo and Cerro Tarachallyu).Thetwohillforts withthesmallest CSS and SFSexhibitthe largestRAinthe region (Ayapata East and Cerro Pucara). The remain­ing hillforts in the sample do not follow the positive trend. Thus, it appears that population size can explain this unexpected relationship. The region’s smallest populations coped with their relative vulnerability by constructing the most substantialforti.cations and occupying the least accessible areas. Hillforts with thelargest populations elected the opposite strategy—to occupy the most accessible areas and con­struct fewerforti.cations.Thisinterpretationis

supported by a strong negative correlation (r =-0.512) between CSS and RA, indicating that as CSS decreases (accessibility increases), RA also increases. The combined results of the intersite forti.cation analyses and the fact that CSS and RA account for over 75% of the variationin SFS suggestthat hillfort population sizewasthe most importantfactor determining its relativevulnerabilityor formidability.This,in turn, determined choices regarding accessibility and forti.cation strategies. 
Regional DifferencesinForti.cationPatterns 
Thedeviationofintersite forti.cation patternsin theUpper SNR fromthose observedinthe Lake Titicaca Basin warrants explanation. Hillforts in the Titicaca Basin display more defensive investment as hillfort population sizes increases (Arkush 2011). Arkush argues that the smallest and most vulnerablegroupsexhibitthe weakest defenses because they were either unable to invest in more robust defenses or were dependent onlarger alliedgroupsto cometotheiraidduring attacks (Arkush 2005:261–264, 2011:149–155). Implicit in this argument is the assumption that hillforts with large populations could quickly organize the necessary forces to aid beleaguered allies. 
Whether Upper SNR groups were able to depend on alliedsupportis debatable. Certainly the close proximity of hillforts to their nearest neighbors implies some form of cooperation. Nonetheless, several lines of evidence indicate that the defensive system operating in the LIP Titicaca Basin may not have been viable or desirablefor Upper SNRgroups.The .rst lineof evidence pertainstothe degree of sociopolitical and military decentralizationinthe Upper SNR and surrounding regions; the second relates to population size disparities between the Upper SNR and neighboring regions. 
Cross-regional studies and ethnohistorical accounts of LIP warfare show little evidence of the large-scale territorial campaigns and sieges that de.ne state-level con.icts(Arkush 2011:14; Arkush and Stanish 2005; Guamán Poma 2009[1615]:1:64; Keeley 1996). Instead, warfarewas decentralized and organized around cyclical raids and small-scale attacks that most often relied on speed and stealth (Arkush 2005:85; Arkush andTung 2013;Julien 2003). This formofwarfarelackstheorganizationaland logistical structure needed to besiege hillforts, or the incentive and punishment systems to compel individuals to assault heavily forti.ed settlements(Arkush and Stanish 2005;Carneiro 1994;D’Altroy1992;Keeley1996). Thelackof centralized political structuresintheUpperSNR andthesurroundingregions suggeststhatwarfare likely mirrored larger patterns of highland LIP con.ict (Abraham 2010;Conlee2004). 
The reliance on quick raids, surprise attacks, and ambushes indicates that offensive tactics wouldfocusonthemost vulnerabletargetsrather than heavily forti.ed settlements orrefuges.In theUpper SNR, theleastprotected targetswould have been thesmallest hillforts,with thefewest combatants to rally to their defense, and iso­latedindividuals and resources.These vulnerable settlements would have been prime targets for attacks or raids unless heavier defenses or effec­tive support from allies compensated for their numerical inferiority.Conversely,thelargestset­tlementsinthe regionwouldhave been themost formidable, and thereforethe least likelytargets of enemy attack. This would have allowed the largestsettlementsintheregiontorely moreon theirrelativelylarge poolof combatants and less on costly forti.cations or potentially unreliable allies. 
Several linesofevidence raise questions about whether Upper SNR populations could depend on allied support. Cross-regional and tempo­ral studies of military capabilities show that small-scale, decentralized societiesdo not have professional militaries to organize immediate troop mobilizations or permanent defenseforces (Carneiro 1990;Keeley 1996:46, 79; Redmond 1994). Instead, combatants are drawn from the general populationrather thanasubsetof trained full-timewarriors(Keeley 1996:34).Theseindi­vidualsareinvolvedindiverse nonmilitary activ­ities, which could delay ef.cient mobilization in response to attacks or raids. This problem would have been especially acute for Upper SNR groups, who would have been regularly scattered throughout the agricultural zones or far a.eld tending to herds on the puna. These organizational challenges could have limited a group’s ability to provide effective aid to allies.

While these challenges could potentially be overcome, theysuggestthat organizingadefense atathreatened settlement and mobilizinglarger coalitionforces fromallied neighborsmayhave been dif.cult and time-consumingaffairs. These delays would have required settlements to rely on their own defensive abilities until reinforce­ments arrived. If a raid or attack achieved some degreeof surprise,whichis highly likelygiven the offensive tactics of the period, effective aid wouldbeevenmoreproblematic.Ifa settlement were caught off guard, many of the potential defenders would be scattered throughout the area. This problem would be especially salient for the region’s smallest groups, whose already diminutivecombatantpoolwouldbeevenfurther reduced while reinforcements were collected. Before aid could be organized and deployed, individuals remaining in the unprepared settle­ment may have had to combat direct attacks if their defending forces were suf.ciently weak. They may also have been unable to drive off enemy forces attacking areas outside the pro­tective defenses of the hillfort. To cope with this potentially lethal delay in reinforcements, it would have behooved smaller groups to invest heavily in defenses to deter direct assaults on settlements and pushattackerstofocus on less vitaltargetswhile supportwas being rallied. 
Itisalso plausiblethatthemilitary capabilities ofUpperSNRgroups werenotsuf.cientlyrapid, organized,orpowerfultoconfront enemyattacks outsideof protected hillforts.Each groupwould then have to rely on its own defensive autonomy to repel the enemy,evenif allied neighborswere in close proximity. If this were the case, the optimal strategyforthe smallest,most vulnerable settlementswouldhavebeentoinvestin substan­tial defenses. 
In addition to these organizational issues, the Upper SNR contained a relatively small population in comparison to the surrounding regions (Conlee and Schreiber 2006; Meddens and Schreiber 2010). These demographic dis­parities suggest that neighboring groups had the potential to organize larger, more powerful coalitions.Ifattackedby larger forces,the Upper SNRgroupswouldhave been atadistinct disad­vantage and may have had to rely on defenses to compensate for numerical inferiority. These factorsmayhaveforced groupsto remain behind thewallsof theirhillforts duringattacks rather than rallying to expel attacking forces, thereby incentivizingincreasedinvestmentin defenses. 
Tosummarize, multiple linesofevidence indi­catethat military assistance among neighboring Upper SNRhillfortswas likelyinfeasible, unre­liable,or inadequate,forcingeachoftheregion’s settlements to occupy defensible hilltops and construct substantialforti.cations.Investmentin defensewouldhave been most essentialfor the smallest settlementsinthe region, whose limited combatant pool would have rendered them the most vulnerable. To cope with this susceptibil­ity,the smallest settlementsdisplay thegreatest number of forti.cations and occupy the least accessibleareas. Naturally defensible locations with heavy defenses reduce theprobability that attacking forces will directly assaultsettlements; if an assaultdid occur,the assailants wouldbe less likely to gain entrance to the residential sector before reinforcements could arrive. 


Summary and Conclusions 
Settlement patterns demonstratethat each hillfort is centered on or in close proximity to key resources and likely travel corridors. Each hill­fortisexcellently situatedto monitorand control movement into and out of the cabezadas.Nat­urally defensible hilltops with large viewsheds were preferentially selectedforsettlement.These natural defensive bene.ts allowed residents to invest less in arti.cial defensive measures when topography was suf.ciently steep. Intersite for­ti.cation patterns show that hillforts with the smallest relativepopulations containtheheaviest forti.cations and are the least accessible settle­mentsinthe region. This strategy helped to cope with theincreased vulnerabilityofhavingfewer peopletorally to defense and an inability to rely on neighboringalliesfor defensivesupport. 
Regional spatial and architectural data reveal patterns of Upper SNR con.ict. Small group sizes, decentralized political structures, and high degrees of defensive investment suggest a pat­tern of endemic and possibly internecine war­fare, although the current lack of corroborating evidence renders this interpretation tentative. Nevertheless, this explanation is supported by

ethnohistorical narratives that describe the LIP in the central and southernAndes as character­ized by sectarian warfare over scarce resources and political power (Cieza de León 1985:6 [1553:2:iv]; Guamán Poma 2009[1615]:1:64). 
This research demonstrates that the chal­lenges associated with small-scale warfare fos­tered ingenuity and cooperation. Planned col­lective actions would have been required to coordinate and execute the observed defensive strategies.Itisclear that LIP defensivestrategies were de.nedbyconsciousand coordinated group actions that adapted defensive systems to the natureofthewarfare beingexperienced. 
In conclusion, this research developed effec­tive and practical methods for standardized and replicable quantitative analysis of forti.cations. By applying techniques that can be used to com­pare and contrastvariationin defensive designs, archaeologists are better prepared to evaluate explanatory models of defensive strategies and warfare across regional contexts.
