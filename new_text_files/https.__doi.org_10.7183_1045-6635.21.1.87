CULTURAL TRANSFORMATIONS OF THE CHANKA HOMELAND (ANDAHUAYLAS, PERU) DURING THE LATE INTERMEDIATE PERIOD (A.D. 1000-1400) 
Brian S. Bauer and Lucas C. Kellett 
One of the largest demographic shifts to occur in Andean prehistory took place during the Late Intermediate Period (A.D. /000-1400). Across a large expanse of the central Andes a vast number of lower elevation settlements were abandoned and local populations were concentrated in newly constructed, defensibly positioned sites, located along high ridges. In this article we examine this dramatic settlement shift in relation to the Chanka ethnic group that occupied the Andahuaylas region (Department of Apurimac, Peru). The results indicate that the shift from valley to hilltop settlements in the Andahuay­las region occurred aroundA.D. 1000. We propose that the shift reflects an increased dependency on agro-pastoralism that resulted from a period of climate change. We also suggest that in this region of the Andes the shift was augmented by grow­ing levels of political competition after the dissolution of the Wari Empire and that current models, which situate the Chanka as a uniquely powerful ethnic group at the time of the Inca expansion, need to be reexamined. 
Durante el Per{odo Intermedio Tardio ( I000-1400 d.C.) ocurrio una de las mas grandes transformaciones demogrdficas en la prehistoria Andina. A lo largo de una buena parte de Los Andes centrales, un gran numero de asentamientos ubicados en cotas bajas fueron abandonados, pasando las poblaciones locales a ocupar nuevos sitios, construidos en posiciones defensi­vas, en lo alto de Los cerros. En este art{culo examinamos dicha dramdtica transformacion enfocdndonos en el caso de! grupo etnico Chanka, que habitara la region de Andahuaylas ( Departamento de Apur{mac, Peru). Los fechados radiocarbonicos que hemosa obtenido, demuestran que en la region de Andahuaylas, este radical cambio en los patrones de asentamiento ocurrio en el marco de un breve lapso de tiempo. Los asentamientos ubicados en el fondo def valle con cerdmica Wari son ocupados hasta el final def primer milenio d.C., despues de lo cual, hay un subito cambio con el establecimiento de nuevos sitios en la parte alta de Los cerros, ca. 1000-1200 d.C. El perfodo en torno al 1000 d.C. se vincula estrechamente con dos fenomenos 
paralelos: El colapso del Imperio Wari y el inicio de una sequ{a macro-regional en Los Andes' centrales. Postulamos que el cambio en el patron de asentamiento refleja una mayor dependencia en estrategias de subsistencia agro-pastoriles, producto de un perfodo de severo cambio climdtico. Tambien sugerimos que en esta region de los Andes, el cambio en el patron de asen­tamientojite estimulado por niveles crecientes de competicion polftica, una vez disuelto el Imperio Wari. El patron de asen­tamiento registrado en la region de Andahuaylas durante el Per{odo Intermedio Tardio, es similar al hallado en varias otras regiones y sugiere que los Chankas,fueron una entre otras muchas entidades polfticas (sefior[os), relativamente pequefias de los Andes centrales.

and Stanish 2005; D'Altroy 1992; Leblanc 1981; Parsons and Hastings 1988; Stanish 2003). In many highland areas there also appears to have been a reor­ganization in subsistence regimes from a maize focused agriculture in the lower valleys (quechua), which predominated during the prior Middle Hori­zon, to a more mixed agro-pastoral economy where tuber production and camelid herding played increasingly important roles (D' Altroy and Hastorf 200 I ; Hastorf 1993; Kellett 2008; Parsons et al. 1997, 2000a, 2000b). Furthermore, it is likely that this period coincided with an intense period of cli­matic change distinguished by drier conditions (Bin­ford et al. 1997; Chepstow-Lusty et. al 2003; Thompson et al. 1985; Thompson et al. 1986; Thompson et al. 1995). There is, however, a grow­ing recognition that there are great local variations within these trends across the Andes (Covey 2008). In this article, we examine the social changes that occurred during this era in theAndahuaylas region, among one of the best known, but least studied, eth­nic groups of the central Andes, the Chanka. 
Introduction to the Chanka of the 
Andahuaylas Region 

The Chanka were one of the most important ethnic groups of the prehistoric Andes. According to Inca oral traditions, recorded in the early Colonial Period 
(A.D. 1532-1572), a momentous battle took place in the early 1400s on the outskirts of Cuzco between the Chanka and the Inca. The Inca are believed to have won the battle and then begun an aggressive campaign of expansion, which continued for three generations and which eventually resulted in the development of the largest empire in the Americas. The Chanka, on the other hand, are said to have retreated back to theAndahuaylas region and even­tually accepted their newly established, subservient relationship with the Inca. Although there has been increased scholarship on the rise of the Inca in the Cuzco region, and archaeological findings have helped to reshape much of what was once believed about the development of the Inca state (e.g., Bauer 2004; Covey 2006), the history of the Chanka has gone largely unexamined. As Inca scholarship begins to overhaul its 60-year-old interpretive mod­els using new archaeological evidence, the prehis­tory of this important ethnic group comes into focus as a compelling research issue. 
The homeland of the Chanka was in the 
Andahuaylas region (Department of Apurimac, 
Peru). It is critical to note, however, that since at 
least Colonial times, the term "Chanka" has also 
been used to refer to a broader group of people (Fig­
ure 1). "Chanka" has, and continues to be, used 
indiscriminately to refer to the people who lived in 
the central Peruvian departments ofHuancavelica, 
Ayacucho and Apurimac at the time of the Inca 
expansion. This tradition may have begun with Gar­
cilaso de la Vega(l 966:218 [1609: Pt. 1, Bk. 4, Ch. 
15]), as he places several distinct and differently 
named groups under the general rubric of Chanka. 
Garcilaso de la Vega (1966:282 [1609: Pt. 1, Bk. 
5, Ch. 15]) also suggests that these same groups (Chanka, Uranmarca, Hancohuallu, Villca, Sula, and Utunsulla) joined together to stage the attack on Cuzco. While this combined force is frequently referred to by modem scholars as the Chanka Con­federation, the information contained in the clas­sic chronicles concerning the social composition of the confederation is so ambiguous that no one clearly understands how the confederation was organized, or if it even existed. Luis Lumbreras aptly sums up the general state of uncertainty, "It is not known whether these warriors belonged to a single political organization or whether they rep­resented a confederation of small groups that joined forces for warfare, nor is there concrete informa­tion on the territory they inhabited or whether all or a major portion of the 'province' of the Central highlands belonged the 'Chanka alliance'" [Lum­breras l 974a: 198]. 
Despite the ambiguity of the colonial documents concerning the composition of the Chanka Con­federation, there has been a long scholarly history of trying to define the territorial area of its mem­bers and to identify its archaeological remains 
(Arco Parr6 1923; Markham 1871, 1923; Navarro del Aguila 1937, 1939). The most influential work defining the area of the Chanka confederation was, however, written by Lumbreras. In his seminal arti­cle, Sabre los Chancas, Lumbreras (1959) attempted to address the growing misconceptions suggesting that the Chanka were related to the Wari culture of the Ayacucho region (A.D. 600-1000) and correctly concluded that the Chanka were a post-Wari culture that thrived during what is now generally called the Late Intermediate Period (A.D. 1000-1400). He also correctly associated several

archaeological features of the central highlands including: large hilltop settlements, clusters of cir­cular structures, aboveground burial chambers (chullpas), with the Late Intermediate Period. In later studies, Lumbreras (l974a, 1974b, 1978, 1999) has expanded on these observations. Although he recognizes that the chroniclers firmly place the Chanka themselves within the Andahuay­las region, Lumbreras continues, like various authors both before and after him, to propose that a large area of the central Andes should be consid­ered within their cultural influence. He writes, 
The modem province of Andahuaylas is tra­ditionally identified as Chanka territory, but historical references tend to define their area to include the extensive valley of the Rio Pam­pas and the region west of the Apurimac ... Archaeological investigations undertaken by the universities of San Marcos in Lima and San Cristobal de Huamanga in Ayacucho have made it possible to recognize a more or less homogenous culture over the Rio Pampas Basin (Lumbreras 1974a:1 98]. 
Many of the archaeological features that have been used to define the Chanka culture area (hilltop occu­pations, groups of circular buildings, and chullpas) are now known to extend well beyond the central highlands, and can be found across much of the Andes (e.g., Arkush 2006; Covey 2008). Never­theless, Lumbreras's model was quickly accepted and many archaeologists have taken to use the gen­eralized term "Chanka" to refer to any archaeo­logical remains in the Departments of Apurimac, Ayacucho, and Huancavelica which date to the Late Intermediate Period. Indeed, the term "Chanka" is now widely used to classify all Late Intermediate Period ruins in the Departments of Apurimac, Ayacucho, and Huancavelica, even those that are found in territories that are known to have been occupied by other particular ethnic groups. 
One of the most prolific researchers of the cen­tral highlands, who has concentrated on studying the archaeological remains of the Late Intermedi­ate Period, has been Enrique Gonzalez Carre ( 1979, 1982, 1992a). Working with various colleagues Gonzalez Carre has identified hundreds of differ­ent Late Intermediate Period sites across the cen-

tral highlands (Gonzalez Carre et al. 1988) and described various ceramic styles, stone tools, and architectural features that are associated with them (Gonzalez Carre et al. 1987). This research has been used to suggest that the central highlands was a historically unified and well defined culture area, with clear archaeological correlates. Gonzalez Carre writes: 
The information provided by the documents, as well as by the archaeological evidence, leads us to conclude that when we talk about the Chanka Nation and who it included, we are dealing with various groups which had simi­lar material cultures, and who shared the con­trol and occupation of a particular territory; [they also] probably shared a common lan­guage and a series of culturally particular fea­tures and characteristics [Gonzalez Carre 1992a:87; translation by authors]. 
Our research in the Andahuaylas region indicates that this is not the case, and we suggest that the over use of a single ethnic group's name to classify all archaeological remains in three vast departments which date to the Late Intermediate Period has served to perpetuate an inaccurate image of the Chanka as an emergent power of the central high­lands of Peru before the Inca. More specifically, the widespread and generalized use of the term "Chanka" to include various groups that lived out­side of the Andahuaylas region lends the impres­sion that the central highlands was a more politically and culturally unified area during late prehistoric times than it actually was. Our brief reconnaissance work in both the Soras and Vil­cashuaman regions, and our intensive research in the Andahuaylas region, indicates that the ethnic groups of each of theses areas developed unique material cultures, including different ceramic styles, and we found no archaeological evidence of political unification between them. 
The generalized use of the term "Chanka" has also masked the tensions that existed between the different competing local polities that existed within the so-called confederation. It also stands in opposition to the numerous hilltop fortifications that were constructed across the region as well as documents that suggest that active raiding occurred between different groups (Monzon 1965:222 [1586]). Some researchers have gone so far as to suggest that the Chanka were a unified political entity that controlled a vast territorial area, and terms such as the "Chanka Nation" and "Chanka State" are found scattered across the archaeologi­cal and ethnohistoric literature, even though there is little archaeological evidence to support such a conclusion. The generalization of the term "Chanka" is also distracting since it impedes researchers from developing detailed local chronologies and it provides a homogenizing lens through which to reconstruct the late prehistory of the central highlands. It also ignores the simple fact that we know that the various groups that lived across the region viewed themselves in many, if not most, contexts as distinct polities, with their own names, territorial boundaries, leaders, traditions, shrines, and mythologies. 
In short, clearer definitions and a more region­ally specific use of terms is critical not just for a more complete understanding of the Chanka, but for more accurate reconstructions of the many other ethnic groups that occupied the highlands during late prehistoric times. In this work, when we dis­cuss the Chanka, we are referring to a select group of people who lived within what is now the province of Andahuaylas during late prehistoric and early historic times. While the nature and composition­and even the existence--of the Chanka Confeder­ation can be debated, the fact that the Chanka occupied the Andahuaylas region is indisputable since it is independently recorded in over a dozen major chronicles and in innumerable other colonial documents from the Andahuaylas region (Bauer et al. 2010). 
To reconstruct the precise region that was once occupied by the Chanka, we must tum to a partic­ular tool of Spanish colonization. Beginning in the time of Columbus, the Spanish crown gave the leaders of expeditions in the Americas control over a limited number of labor-service grants, called encomiendas. Through this system, different native groups were assigned to specific Spaniards, and in theory, a formal set of rights and obligations was established between the holder of the encomienda and the natives included within it. The area of the Chankas was granted to Diego Maldonado by Fran­cisco Pizarro on April 15, 1539. Through extraor­dinary luck, the original Chanka (Andahuaylas) encomienda document has been preserved within the General Archive of the Indies in Seville

(Archivo General de Indias, Patronato 93, No. 11, Ramo 2, ff. I 86v-l 88v; Julien 2002). The docu­ment is especially important for our study since it includes a list of 63 villages that were included within the Chanka encomienda, as well as the names of each of the community leaders. This unprecedentedly detailed list of Chanka towns can be used to establish the geographical area that was associated with the Chanka at the time of the Span­ish invasion. 
The first attempt to define the Chanka home­land using the 1539 Andahuaylas Encomienda doc­ument was conducted by Catherine Julien (2002). By examining toponyms provided on modem maps of the region, she was able to suggest locations for some 15 (24 percent) of the 63 villages which were included in the territory in 1539. Through our archaeological survey work in the Andahuaylas region and our readings of additional archival doc­uments and maps, we are able to expand this list and to suggest some 30 ( 48 percent) former village locations. A plotting of the proposed settlement locations indicates that the original Chanka encomienda that was granted to Maldonado included most of the area currently found within the modern Provinces of Andahuaylas and Chincheros (Figure 2). Most importantly, the plot­ting of these villages provides us with a clear idea of the region which the Inca, and most likely the Chanka themselves, considered to fall within the territory of the Chanka. 
Related Late Intermediate Period Research in the Central Highlands 

Before discussing the specific results of our survey work in the Andahuaylas region, it is important to outline some of the research findings of other pro­jects that have specifically examined Late Inter­mediate Period archaeological remains in the central highlands. As a comprehensive overview of this period and its regional cultures has been recently provided by Covey (2008), we will high­light just a few points that are central to the find­ings of our research on the Chanka. To date, the most intensive study of Late Intermediate Period settlement patterns in the Peruvian Andes derives from the Upper Mantaro Archaeological Research Project (UMARP) that was designed to investigate Inca expansion and consolidation practices in provincial areas of the empire (D' Altroy 1992; D' Altroy andHastorf 2001; Hastorf 1993). Under­taken in the Department of Junfn, in the Jauja region, this landmark project focused on under­standing shifting dynamics among the sociopolit­ical organizations, settlement strategies and subsistence regimes of the Wanka ethnic group before and during the Inca occupation of the region. Unlike the Andahuaylas area, the Jauja region appears to have been relatively unaffected by the development of the Wari state, and very few Wari­related artifacts were recovered during the project. Nevertheless, the region experienced many of the same radical settlement pattern shifts during the Late Intermediate Period that have been docu­mented elsewhere in the Andes. The relocation from valley bottom communities to ridge-top sites and the concomitant shifts in subsistence strategies appear to have begun in Wanka I (A.D. 1000-1300) times, with intense population aggregation taking place in the area at approximately AD 1350 during what is locally known as Wanka II times. D' Altroy writes, 
Like their immediate ancestors, the Wanka II [AD 1350-1450] people were farmers and herders. In the Yanamarca and main Mantaro Valleys, however productive valley bottoms were abandoned, while large, fortified towns were built on hill crests on the west side of the Yanamarca. The shift to higher elevations restricted the range of easily accessible pro­ductive zones, so that there was an increased emphasis on tuber and highland grain cultiva­tions [D'Altroy 2001:39]. 

Besides being built at high elevations, many of the newly established Wanka II sites of the Jauja region were surrounded by several massive stone walls that protected large residential sectors. The Wanka II settlement pattern in the Jauja region is dominated by the immense hilltop site of Hatunmarca, esti­mated at more than 70 ha in size, and by several other large settlements measuring between 20 to 30 hectares. These are very large sites for this period in the Andes and they have been interpreted as rep­resenting the political centers of a series of small independent polities that competed for control of local resources (D' Altroy 1992; D' Altroy and Has­torf 2001; LeBlanc 1981 ). Nevertheless, social ranking within these centers appears to have been

This Cuzco (Covey 2006), the Tarma-Chinchaycocha conclusion is based on the differences in quality of drainages in Junin (Parsons et al. 1997, 2000a,

2000b), and throughout the Department of Ayacu­cho (Gonzalez Carrel 992a, l992b;Gonzalez Carre and Pozzi-Escot 2002; Meddens and Vivanco Pomacanchari 2005;Schreiber1992;Valdez 2002; Valdez et al. 1990; Valdez and Vivanco 1994). 
A similar settlement pattern of hill and ridge­top sites has also been observed further south in the Lake Titicaca region (Arkush 2008; Arkush and Stanish 2005; Frye and de la Vega 2005;Hyslop 1976; Stanish 2003; Stanish et al. 1997). The chal­lenge in the Titicaca region, as elsewhere, is to dis­entangle the complex relationship between various phenomena including: political collapse, settlement shifts, climate change, and regional warfare. Vari­ous researchers (e.g., Binford et al. 1997; Janusek 2004; Kolata 1993; Ortloff and Kolata 1993) sug­gest that the fall of Tiwanaku was hastened by a regional drought that began in the eleventh century 
A.D. and which lasted for several centuries. Fur­thermore, it is widely held that the collapse of the regional political power and the worsening climatic conditions led to a scattering of the population and the establishment of new hilltop settlements. Arkush (2006, 2008) has recently completed an extensive study of Late Intermediate Period sites in the Colla region of the Titicaca Basin that included more that 40 radiocarbon dates. In her research, Arkush proposes that the fortifications at the hilltop sites reached their maximum extent between A.D. 1300 and A.D. 1450. Her findings suggest that the development of chronic warfare in the Titicaca Basin may not have been a direct result of the fall of Tiwanaku (ca. A.D. 1000), but rather was brought about by later regional tensions which became gradually elevated during the prolonged period of severe climate change. 
The Lake Titicaca findings are especially rele­vant to our work in the Andahuaylas region. It has been long assumed that two large kingdoms devel­oped in the Lake Titicaca region during the Late Intermediate Period, the Colla and the Lupaqa, and that these two kingdoms were locked in a prolonged state of regional warfare before the Inca expanded into the region. Recent archaeological surveys in the area of the Lupaqa provide a more subtle inter­pretation of the social condition that prevailed dur­ing the pre-Inca times (Frye 1997; Stanish et al. 1997). Frye and de la Vega (2005: 173) suggest that the area of the Lupaqa was far from unified and that chronic conflict and competition existed between the separate Lupaqa groups. They suggest that rather than promoting the development of cen­tralized leadership, the chronic warfare among the Lupaqa prevented regional unification. Arkush (2006:305) presents a similar picture for the Colla in the northwest part of the Titicaca Basin, stating "While the [Colla] area cannot be considered polit­ically unified, patterns of site placement and inter­visibility suggest that many fortified sites relied on systems of allies for defense." Therefore, it appears that these neighboring ethnic groups (i.e., Colla and the Lupaqa) were neither politically unified entities nor arch enemies, but were required to build and live in defensive sites during a period of actual or potential conflict. 
A notable exception to the widespread pattern of Late Intermediate Period fortified hilltop sites can be found in the Cuzco Basin, the area sur­rounding the modem city of Cuzco, where many of the Late Intermediate Period sites are located near the valley floor (ca. 3,200-3,500 m asl). Bauer (2002, 2004) and Covey (2006) have highlighted this exception, suggesting the Cuzco Basin became politically unified very early during the Late Inter­mediate Period, and thus it was spared a prolonged period of regional conflict. Population numbers and site densities increased dramatically within the Cuzco Basin during the Late Intermediate Period, and the agricultural landscape was terraced in a way that created stable state incomes while undercut­ting local and individual autonomy (Bauer and Covey 2002). It is becoming increasingly evident that unlike the Lupaqa and the Colla of the Lake Titicaca region or the Wanka of the Upper Man­taro, the Inca were able to develop a political hier­archy across the Cuzco region during the Late Intermediate Period that reduced ethnic diversity and political competition, and that over the course of several centuries resulted in the creation of a uni­fied heartland. 
Since the chroniclers state that the Chanka were not only early rivals of the Inca, but also the initi­ates of territorial expansionism in the central Andes, as we began our research in the Andahuay las region we anticipated that we might find evidence of polit­ical growth and regional consolidation during the Late Intermediate Period, as has been documented for the Cuzco region. It was considered possible that the early development of the Chanka paralleled, or perhaps even surpassed, those of the early Inca

in the Cuzco Valley. The results of our field inves­tigations indicate, however, that the Chanka fol­lowed a course of cultural development that more closely mirrored those of the Wanka, Colla, Lupaqa, and other highland Andean groups, than the more exceptional pattern that has been recorded for the Inca in the Cuzco area. 
Research in the Andahuaylas Region 
Previous archaeological research in Andahuaylas focused on the earliest village sites that are located in the lower valley areas (Grossman 1972, 1983). This being the case, the largest and most impres­sive Late Intermediate Period sites, which are sit­uated on a series of high ridge tops, have gone undocumented. Our archaeological survey was conducted in the Andahuaylas region in 2002 (approximately six months) and in 2004 (approx­imately three months). The archaeological survey concentrated on documenting the prehistoric set­tlement patterns of the greater Andahuay las region, which included the Andahuaylas Valley as well as a significant amount of territory that surrounds it. In all, the survey covered approximately 300 km2 and included the central area of the Chanka ethnic group (Figure 2). Kellett (2006, 2008, 2010) returned to the region in 2005-06 to conduct exca­vations at a series of Middle Horizon and Late Intermediate Period sites. 
Carbon samples were collected at sites during the course of the survey. These samples were taken from archaeological contexts that had been exposed through road cuts, canal construction, or other activ­ities. While we recognize the limitations that car­bon samples collected during the course of survey work have, especially when compared to samples collected from better understood contexts revealed during the course of excavations, it was important for our project to begin to build a regional ceramic and site chronology based on absolute dates (Bauer et. al 2010). Our regional chronology has been fur­ther strengthened through additional data and car­bon samples collected during Kellett's excavations in the region (Table 1 ). 
Andahuaylas during the Middle Horizan 
The presence of Wari materials in the Department of Apurimac was first suggested by Rowe ( 1956: 143) and later confirmed by Grossman (1972) and Meddens (1985, 1991, 2001). During our survey we recovered Wari ceramics, most of which can be classified as Vifiaque, at about 65 sites (Bauer et al. 2010). The Wari ceramics found in the Andahuaylas region were most often recovered at sites that also contain the locally produced Qasawirka ceramics (Bauer et al. 201 O; Grossman 1972). 
The strong continuation of the Qasawirka pot­tery style after the arrival of the Wari in the region is not surprising; however, it does cloud the settle­ment pattern analysis (Bauer et al. 2010). Never­theless, it is clear that the Wari settlement pattern largely overlies that of the earlier local culture 
(Qasawirka). This suggests to us that the expansion of the Wari into the Andahuaylas region did not bring major changes to the subsistence or settle­ment patterns. The majority of the Middle Horizon sites are located on lower valley slopes (2,000-3,500 m asl) and comprise a simple settle­ment hierarchy dominated by hamlets and villages. The settlement pattern suggests an evenly distrib­uted population across lower valleys that likely engaged in small-scale agriculture, principally maize, quinoa, and tubers, as well as some came lid pastoralism (Bauer et. al 20 I 0). No new terrace sys­tems were established in the Andahuaylas region with its incorporation into the Wari state, and we currently have no evidence of a Wari administra­tive center in the region or the construction of any other Wari installations. This is not, however, to suggest that the Andahuaylas region was unim­portant to the Wari. After all, Andahuaylas is one of the richest agricultural valleys between the Wari capital and the second-largest regional center, Pikil­lacta. Based on the current evidence, we believe that the Andahuaylas region reflects a case of success­ful assimilation, rather than outright conquest and occupation. 

Andahuaylas during the 
Late Intermediate Period 
The regional archaeological survey located approx­imately 200 sites, primarily habitation sites and corral complexes, that contained diagnostic Chanka ceramics and which dated to the Late Intermediate Period. Of these sites, approximately 32 are con­sidered relatively large (>1 ha). In comparison to the Middle Horizon occupations of the region, the largest (5-15 ha) Late Intermediate Period sites are

concentrated at higher elevations, frequently near the suni-puna eco-tone at the boundary between upper agricultural lands and highland pastures. 
While each of the Chanka village sites in the Andahuaylas region contains unique features, they also share many similarities. To begin, they tend to be situated in prominent locations most frequently on flat terrain at the summit of ridges. Indeed, almost every major ridge in theAndahuaylas region contains a large Late Intermediate Period settle­ment. While the preservation of architectural fea­tures at the Late Intermediate Period sites is not especially impressive, when compared to other regions of central Andes, they are the best pre­served sites of any time period of the Andahuaylas region. Chanka architecture is typically built of locally available stone that is rough cut and stacked with simple mud or gravel mortar, often termed pirca masonry. Chanka habitation sites frequently display a dense arrangement of agglutinated cir­cular structures that are arranged in patio groups and built on living terraces (Figure 3). Also com­mon are circular chullpas that are frequently found in small clusters and located higher on the ridge or on knolls away from the hilltop settlements. Large Chanka habitation sites range from 1-15 ha in size and contain dense concentrations of surface pot­tery, lithics, fauna! remains, and grinding stones (batan). In addition, numerous small corral com­plexes are located in proximity (< 3 km) to these large habitation sites, which is not surprising since occupations are typically located near large expanses of accessible grasslands. Finally, the ele­vated position of most of the large Chanka sites pro­vides a commanding view of the surrounding landscape and line-of-sight to most other large ridge-top settlements across neighboring valleys (Figure 4). 
The two largest, and certainly the most impres­sive, Chanka sites in the Andahuaylas region are Achanchi (PAA# 225; 4,030m asl) and Usma (PAA # 57; 3,886 m as!). Both sites are estimated to mea­sure between 10 and 15 ha and are located on dis­tant ridges on opposite sides of the Andahuaylas Valley. Achanchi is an extremely imposing site that stretches for more than a kilometer along a high and remote steep ridge north of the city of Andahuay­las (Figure 5). The site contains more than 300 hun-

public spaces or other evidence of ranked social groups within the site. 
Although Achanchi and Usma are the two largest Late Intermediate Period sites in the survey region, there are several other sites of significant size with dense architectural remains. For exam­ple, the large Chanka site of Circapata (PAA #192; 3,558 m asl) is located at the far eastern end of a long, broad ridge and holds a striking overview of the Pincos River Valley. The Inca road from Andahuaylas to the large Inca center of Curamba ran beside this site through an important mountain pass. Despite intensive cultivation and the instal­lation of an antenna, the site still contains numer­ous terraces and circular structures. There is also a large Chanka site immediately east of the well­known Inca site of Sondor. The Late Intermediate Period sector of Sondor (PAA# 199; 3,302 m asl) extends for several hundred meters and the foun­dations of many poorly preserved terraces and cir­cular structures can still be observed. A carbon sample collected from this site during the survey 

yielded an uncalibrated AMS date of 870 ± 32 B.P. (AA 56645 [A.D. 1080 ± 32]). Other important Chanka settlements including Waywaka (PAA# 72; 3,040 m asl) beside Andahuaylas as well as the sprawling ridge sites of Cerro Maraypata (PAA# 850; 3,612 m asl) and Cruzpata (PAA# 285; 3,371 m as!) near Talavera. Carbon collected during the regional survey from the last of these sites pro­vided an uncalibrated AMS radiocarbon date of 1014 ± 32 B.P. (AA 56646 [A.D. 934 ± 32]). 
The site of Luisinayoc (PAA#220; 3,716 masl) is also of considerable importance within the local settlement system. Luisinayoc is a Chanka site that sits on a broad east-west running ridge above and to the north of the town of Pacucha. The site is long, extending for more than two thirds of a kilometer over two small knolls of the ridge, and is approxi­mately IO ha in size. The site is defined by a high density of diagnostic Chanka ceramics and poorly preserved architectural remains. On close inspec­tion one can discern the foundations of numerous small habitation terraces, patios, enclosures, and

(AA 80686 [A.D. 1052 ± 36]). The distribution of medium to large size Chanka ridge-top sites sug­gests that local populations during the Late Inter­mediate Period were distributed evenly across the landscape, with no distinct regional capital or estab­lished site hierarchy. 
In addition to regional settlement data, an exam­ination of various site layouts in the study region provides little evidence for status differentiation within or between the different settlements. The various types of household, terrace, corral, and plat­form architecture documented within the smaller Chanka ridge sites are largely the same as those recorded within the larger settlements. Further­more, the site plans reveal dozens to hundreds of circular house foundations that suggest a moder­ate population density (in the hundreds to low thou­sands at the largest sites). This is not the case for all other Late Intermediate Period cultures of the central highlands. For example, the large regional population estimations and the distinct architec­tural differences within the Late Intermediate Period sites of the Jauj a region suggest to researchers that simple class divisions (commoner and elite) were developing among the Wanka dur­ing the immediate pre-Inca times (D' Altroy and Hastorf 2001). The moderate overall population level and the absence of evidence of emergent social stratification in the Andahuay las is intriguing, given that the Chanka are traditionally thought to have spearheaded an invasion of the Cuzco Valley some 160 km from Andahuaylas.

and the Late Intermediate Period (Lumbreras 197 4a; Parsons and Hastings 1988), few projects have been able to provide sufficient radiocarbon dates to deter­mine when exactly such settlement changes occurred. The timing of the demographic shift is crit­ical if we are to understand the political and eco­logical factors that may have been involved with it and to determine if different regions underwent sim­ilar transformations at the same time (Figure 9). 
During our research in the Andahuaylas region we processed five radiocarbon samples from the Middle Horizon site of Anccopaccha (PAA# 206). Two samples were extracted from an exposed soil profile that yielded both Qasawirka and Wari ceramics. These samples provided uncalibrated AMS dates of 1312 ± 55 B.P. (AA 51450 [AD. 638 ± 55]) and 1140 ± 120 B.P. (AA 51451 [AD. 810 ± 120]). During the course of Kellett's (2010) research, he conducted test excavations at Ancco­paccha to gain additional information on the Wari period occupation in the Andahuaylas region. His excavations yielded numerous examples of Qasawirka and Wari ceramics. Three carbon sam­ples collected during these excavations provide uncalibrated AMS dates of 1175 ± 38 B.P. (AA 78331 [AD. 775 ± 38]), 1095 ± 38 B.P. (AA 78332 [AD. 855 ± 38]), and 1123 ± 37 B.P. (AA 78333 [AD. 827 ± 37]). The calibrated dates for these samples suggest that the Wari occupation of the site began in the late-600s or early-700s AD. and lasted until around AD. 1000. These dates match well with the currently recognized period of Wari expansionism defined elsewhere in the Andes (Williams 2001). 

During our survey we also collected carbon sam­ples from various ridge-top sites. Samples from seven different Chanka sites within the Andahuay­las region and from two ridge top-sites in the nearby Uranmarca area (Socualaya Davila 2006; Samples AA 56651 and AA 56650) were submitted for dat­ing. Although the contexts for these samples were not ideal, the nine sites provide a remarkably tight cluster of uncalibrated AMS dates, ranging from 1014 ± 32 B.P. (AA 56646 [AD. 934 ± 32]) to 826 ± 30 B.P. (AA 56651 [AD. 1124 ± 30]) and doc­ument that the ridge sites were inhabited for sev­eral centuries, starting around the end of the first millennium AD. (Table 1 ). 
A second series of six AMS dates (AA 80683-AA 80688) provided from samples col­lected during excavations in domestic contexts at two ridge-top sites of the region (Achanchi and Luisinayoc) closely. match those collected during the survey phase of the project (Kellett 20 I 0). The dates yielded from excavated materials also indi­cate a relatively narrow occupation period for the ridge-top settlements in the Andahuaylas region, with uncalibrated dates ranging from 968 ± 36 B .P. (AA 80687 [AD. 982 ± 36]) to 73 I ± 43 B.P. (AA 80685 [AD. 1219 ± 43]). Given the radiocarbon dates from these different projects, we have strong evidence to suggest that ridge-top sites were con­structed and initially occupied around the tum of the first millennium AD.

Settlement and Conflict in the Andahuaylas Region 
Late Intermediate Period sites in the central and south-central Andes are well known for having defensive works associated with them (Arkush 2006; Arkush and Stanish 2005). For example, one site in the Lake Titicaca region, Pukara Juli, is sur­rounded by five concentric fortification walls, total­ing more than sixteen kilometers in length (Stanish et al. 1997), and there are dozens of other fortified sites in the area (Arkush 2006). Likewise, each of the major Late Intermediate Period sites of the Jauja region is surrounded by substantial fortification walls. Despite this pattern, we have only mixed evidence of village defensive works within our sur­vey region. As has been noted, the largest Chanka sites are located on ridge tops, which contain nat­urally steep slopes. While these sites can be clas­sified as defensively positioned, many Jack clear physical evidence of other constructed defensive features. In many cases, large walls are found at outer living terraces along site margins, but they may be simply built this way to accommodate for the steep topography (see Borgstede and Mathieu

2007). The most obvious indicators of defensive needs, large walls and ditches, are present at only a few Chanka sites in the region. There are only three sites in theAndahuaylas area that are currently documented as containing obvious defensive works. Two of the sites, Luisinayoc and Achanchi, have been briefly described above. At both of these sites, ditches have been dug across the lower ends of the ridges and are located at site margins on moderate slopes, where access by intruders would have been easiest. The third site (PAA# 893; 3,875 m asl) is a much smaller site and is located on the other side of the valley, but it too has a ditch run­ning across its only area of flat access. While sev­eral other sites have possible ditches or defensive walls that need to be further investigated, more common indicators of conflict, such as concentric walls, parapets, baffled doorways, as wells as stores of sling-stones, are noticeably absent. Although the picture is complicated by the poor preservation of Chanka sites, especially in comparison with other areas such as Junfn and the Titicaca Basin, it is clear that the level of public investment in defensive works in the Andahuaylas region does not match that reflected in many other areas of the Andean highlands. 
Settlement and Agro-Pastoralism in the Andahuaylas region 
Based on the relatively light public investment in defensive works surrounding the Chanka settle­ments, we currently believe that regional conflict was not the sole variable in determining the exact settlement locations for many of the Chanka vil­lages in the Andahuaylas region (Kellett 2008; Par­sons et al. 1997, 2000a, 2000b). In fact, during the course ofhis early research inAndahuaylas, Gross­man made the following comment on these large conspicuous Chanka hilltop sites: 
the ridge-top locations of the pre-Inca sites of Andahuaylas must be considered to reflect a variety of pressures. Such pressures could include the economic priorities ... as well as

defense and protection from natural disaster, without the need to treat them mutually exclu­sive [Grossman 1983:48]. 
In a similar vein, we argue that the establishment of hilltop settlements in the region was a multi­causal response to concomitant shifts in the social, political, and economic landscape during the Late Intermediate Period. 
Several studies suggest that the Peruvian and Bolivian Andes suffered a period of prolonged drought soon after the first millennium A.D. (Abbott et al. 1997, 2000; Binford et al. 1997; Chepstow-Lusty et. al 2003; Thompson et al. 1985, 1986, 1995). This time of decreased rainfall is believed to have dramatically influenced the sub­sistence strategies of the Lake Titicaca region inhabitants; causing various groups to shift away from traditional systems of raised field agriculture towards a more mixed economy in which pas­toralism played an increasingly important role (Graffam 1992; Stanish 2003). Frye and de la Vega (2005) have documented a particularly clear case among the Lupaqa, a large ethnic group that lived on the southern side of Lake Titicaca during the Late Intermediate Period. They write, 
Responses to the deterioration of the Ti wanaku state and climatic downturn that occurred in this period included the abandonment of Tiwanaku political centers and agricultural systems, a dispersal of the population from large centers across the landscape, competition over available resources, and increase eco­nomic focus on animal husbandry. We see the increased settlement density, and the fact that the largest and most architecturally complex fortified sites developed within the agro­pastoral zone, as an indication that animal hus­bandry played a critical role in the ... [local] political economy [Frye and de la Vega 2005:1 83]. 
Agro-pastoralism is viewed as a highly successful subsistence strategy and continues to be used in many areas of the Andes today (e.g., Browman 1987; Brush and Guillet 1985; Yamamoto 1985). In the Andahuaylas region, the productivity of the lower altitude maize zones, which were highly exploited during the period of Wari influence, may have been reduced by decreased rainfall toward the end of the first millennium A.D. (Seltzer and Has­

torf 1990). Around that same time, we also see the construction of new sites on remote ridge tops. Although a relatively low number of large agricul­tural terraces are found around the ridge top sites, it is likely that tuber agriculture did take place near these occupations utilizing a simple, low labor strat­egy without terrace construction. Furthermore, the concentration of corrals around many of these high elevation sites appears to support the suggestion that pastoralism increased in importance. A mixed agro-pastoral economy would have served as an effective risk reduction subsistence strategy in the wake of widespread demographic, settlement and environmental change during the Late Intermedi­ate Period (Graffam 1992; Kellett 2008; Stanish 2003). We suggest that the selection of new ridge­top site locations at the eco-tone between the upper limits of agriculture and the higher pastoral lands (ca. 3,700--4,000 m asl) in the Andahuaylas region during the Late Intermediate Period reflects not only a reduction in regional security but also a fun­damental shift in regional subsistence systems in the wake of changing climatic conditions. 
Discussion 
An analysis of our regional survey data indicates that there were significant shifts in the local subsistence-settlement patterns in the Andahuay­las region near the end of the first millennium A.D. (Figure 10). The abandonment of high-quality, lower elevation, agricultural land that had been farmed for millennia and the subsequent construc­tion of new, defensibly positioned sites, suggests that the Late Intermediate Period in theAndahuay­las region was a time of major flux with some threat of local or regional conflict. The fact that at least three of the newly established sites were con­structed with defensive ditches, and that similar settlement shifts have been noted elsewhere in the highlands during this period, strengthens this con­clusion. 
Our radiocarbon evidence documents that a rad­ical shift in settlement location occurred across the Andahuaylas region within a remarkably short period of time. Valley bottom sites with Wari pot­tery appear to have been occupied up to A.D. 1000 after which there is a sudden establishment of a host of new ridge-top sites. The period around A.D. 1000 correlates with the time that Wari influence

is believed to have been in sharp decline (Williams 2001) and the beginning of a series of prolonged droughts (Thompson et al. 1985). Disentangling the relationships between these complex phenomena (settlement shifts, political decline, and climatic change) is difficult, but the concomitant occurrence of all three is difficult to ignore. The exact chrono­logical relationships between the defensive struc­tures (e.g., ditches and walls) at the Chanka sites and the foundation dates of the ridge-top sites them­selves also remain to be investigated. It is possible that these constructions did not occur simultane­ously, and that the defensive works were later addi­tions to the sites (see Arkush 2008). Such findings would have important implications for the histori­cal reconstruction of the shifting settlement patterns and for understanding the social conditions during which the sites were occupied. 
However, it is clear that the shift from lower val­ley sites to ridge-top sites required a change in the subsistence economy. Perhaps responding to a period of prolonged droughts, we believe that the establishment of new villages in proximity to larger expanses of puna grasslands, reflect the increased importance that pastoralism held during this period. This is further supported by concentrations of cor­rals in and around several of these large hilltop sites. We suggest that an increased dependence on agro-pastoral subsistence was required for the suc­cessful survival of local populations in this high ele­vation landscape (Kellett 2008, 2010). 

The shift from valley bottom to ridge-top set­tlements may have also had other important impli­cations for the organization of the regional society. The concentration of an unprecedented number of villagers in ridge-top settlements, surely brought with it new directions in leadership. As Arkush (2006, 2008) argues for the Titicaca Basin, the increase intervisibility between Chanka ridge-top settlements in Andahuaylas may have contributed to the increasing development of local alliances for stronger defense in times of attack. However, as the communities became larger and yet more isolated, we can presume that they also became more autonomous than the more closely spaced and inter­connected villages on the valley floor of the pre­ceding period. The fragmentation of the political and social landscape makes territorial expansion more difficult and the acquisition ofland and other natural resources more complex (Beck 2003, 2006). 
The development of distant and widely separated villages would have also lent power to the leaders of separate villages, while at the same time it would have become increasingly difficult for any single leader to grow influential enough to dominate other settlements in the region. The imposed separation and isolation of villages across the Andahuaylas area during the Late Intermediate Period would have worked against the development of a single regional authority and against the general forces of unification. As the local society reacted against political, and perhaps environmental stress, and relocated their settlements in higher and more remote locations, a cycle may have been started in which regional unification became increasingly more difficult, if not impossible. 
In this respect it is worth noting that the survey data also suggests that a complex settlement hier­archy did not develop in the Andahuaylas area dur­ing the Late Intermediate Period. There is no single, disproportionately large site in the Andahuaylas region indicative of a paramount village or capital for the Chanka. While Achanchi and U sma are the two largest Chanka sites, they are not qualitatively different from several other Chanka settlements in the region. The internal composition of the Late Intermediate Period village sites, defined by chaotic clusters of circular buildings, patios, and terraces, are all roughly similar. There is no evidence of large elite structures or central plazas at any of the sites, and there is no evidence of large-scale pub­lic works (e.g., temple mounds, platforms, sunken courts) at any site, beyond the construction of for­tification ditches and several possible defensive walls. We also found no evidence of well-organized craft production occurring during the Late Inter­mediate Period. Indeed, regional craft production, as reflected in ceramics, reached a nadir during this period. The local ceramics of the Chanka are poor! y made and there is little uniformity or standardiza­tion in designs, forms, or vessel shapes (see Bauer et al. 2010 for detailed discussions of local ceram­ics styles). 
That being said, it is equally important to note that the sites of Achanchi and Usma are located at approximately the same altitude (Achanchi, 4,030 m asl and Usma, 3,886 m as!) and they are roughly the same distance from the valley floor (Achanchi, 10 km and Usma, 7 km). They are also both about the same size (-12 ha) and each is the largest site

within their respective sides of the valley (Figures 4 and 10). Furthermore, there is a series of six nearly equally sized (5-10 ha) villages spread across the region. This is just the kind of pattern­ing one would expect from an Andean moiety sys­tem. We know that during the Inca and Colonial periods the Chanka were divided into Hanan and Hurin divisions, each of which contained a num­ber of ayllus(kin groups) (Bauer et al. 2010). The archaeological survey findings suggest that the moi­ety system of the Chanka may have extended back into pre-Inca times and we speculate that the sites of Achanchi and Usma represented the two most powerful settlements within this system of dual social organization (Bauer et al. 2010). 
Based on the different locations of these two large settlements (Achanchi and Usma), it is pos­sible that the two Chanka moieties engaged in slightly different forms of agro-pastoralism. For example, Achanchi is situated at the top of a very steep ridge that contains smaller tracts of puna grasslands. Yet, on either side of the ridge are two huge mountain slopes that range in elevation between 2,000-4,200 m asl, and which to this day contain numerous ecological zones for the pro­duction of an extraordinarily diverse suite of agri­cultural crops (e.g., bananas, maize, quinoa, potatoes). In contrast, the site of Usma is located on the southern rim of the Andahuaylas Valley. It was situated more distant from lower valley agri­cultural land than Achanchi, yet it is adjacent to an enormous expanse of high elevation puna lands 
(3,800-4,500 m asl). Given these differences in micro-resource availability, it is possible that the Chanka populations living in and aroundAchanchi, while still agro-pastoralists, may have focused more attention on agricultural production while those occupying U sma, who also engaged in agro­pastoral production, developed a higher commit­ment to camelid husbandry. 
Such a cultural and economic division between agriculturalists (Huari) and pastoralists (Llacuaz) in the central Andes during the seventeenth century has been discussed in detail by Duviols (1973). Within this context, it is worth noting that begin­ning in the late seventeenth century, the Chanka, who were traditionally organized within moieties termed Hanan Chanka (Upper Chanka) and Hurin Chanka(Lower Chanka), also began to be divided within two large groups termed "Chankas of the Puna" and the "Chankas of the Valley." While it is not clear if this designation was built directly on the older moiety division of the region or introduced by the Spanish (see Bauer et. al 2010), it may have some relation to Duviols' (1973) herder/agricul­turalist dichotomy. In fact, Parsons et al. (1997) have offered a convincing argument for the exis­tence, as well as economic and ritual integration of distinct groups of pastoralists and agriculturalists, in the Tarama/Chinchaycocha region during the Late Intermediate Period. While at present we can­not endorse a similar view of specialized Chanka pastoralists and agriculturalists in the Andahuay­las Valley, current survey and excavation data (Kel­lett 2008, 2010) support the notion the Chanka were engaged in a broad range of agro-pastoral subsistence, which may have been dependent on local topography and the availability of suitable agricultural and/or pastoral land, as well as other critical resources. 
The overall settlement pattern of the Andahuay­las region during the Late Intermediate Period is in sharp contrast to the Cuzco Basin where the sprawl­ing, valley bottom city of Cuzco was already emerg­ing as an urbanized center with a series of large satellite communities surrounding it. There were also numerous public works constructed, includ­ing massive agricultural terraces, numerous stor­age units, and various elite structures, in the city of Cuzco and throughout the surrounding basin dur­ing this period. In other words, there is clear archae­ological evidence in the Cuzco region of ethnic integration, class formation, and the development of a regional power during the Late Intermediate Period (Bauer 2004; Bauer and Covey 2002; Covey 2006). Similar evidence is lacking from the Andahuaylas region during the same period. 
Our fieldwork documents that the processes of cultural development that occurred among the Chanka was distinctly different than what occurred in the Cuzco region among their so-call "rivals." As such, the results of the research suggest that the Chanka may not have been as politically united as generally assumed in the archaeological and his­torical literature. While the lack of elites, complex settlement hierarchies, and large public works does not necessarily preclude the existence of some level of regional cohesion, these findings do force us to reexamine and to question the historical accuracies of much of the information presented by the Span-

the Cuzco region, the Inca had formed a large cul­tural heartland and unified over a dozen formally independent regional groups. They had developed a clear state architectural sty le, built a large central capital city, and were in the process of transform­ing the landscape with immense terrace systems. While it is possible that at the same time autonomous polities could have briefly united or formed temporary confederations in the Apurimac, Ayacucho, and Huancavelica areas, our findings do not support the existence of a cohesive complex polity. This is to say, the current vision of a united central Andean area under the strong regional influ­ence or control of the Chanka is not supported by the available archaeological data. In this context, it is worth repeating that our findings for the Andahuaylas region are similar to those recently recovered in the Lake Titicaca region by Frye and de la Vega (2005), among the Lupaqa, and by Arkush (2006, 2008), among the Colla. The Lupaqa and the Colla were the two largest and most pow­erful ethnic groups of the Lake Titicaca region, and both are traditionally thought to have reached rel­atively high levels of social complexity. The Span­ish chroniclers frequently refer to the leaders of these groups as "kings," and suggest that their regional powers matched those of the emergent rulers of Cuzco. The Lupaqa and the Colla, like the Chanka, are generally believed to have been on the verge of hegemonic expansion when their armies were defeated and their leaders captured by Inca forces. Yet, recent archaeological research in the Titicaca Basin is revealing a more nuanced picture of their cultural development. For example, regional survey results within the area of the Lupaqa indicate that they were not as centrally organized as generally believed. Frye and de la Vega write, 
Although there are differences in the size and number of structures at major fortified sites, within the Lupaqa territory as a whole no one site can be considered a political capital. Instead, as the systematic survey and recon­naissance data show, the pattern of small habi­tation sites located near fortified sites is one 
that is repeated throughout the Lupaqa terri­
tory ... At present there are no archaeological indicators to suggest the existence of a Lupaqa King, a Lupaqa capital, or a unified Lupaqa 
These findings are supported by those recovered by Arkush (2006, 2008) among the nearby Colla, where she reports a general lack of political unity and widespread evidence of internal warfare. She proposes that the regional settlement movement from lower altitude to hilltop sites in the Lake Tit­icaca region occurred near the beginning of the Late Intermediate Period, with a concomitant regional drought (ca. A.D. 1000) and the collapse of Tiwanaku political influence. Furthermore, Arkush suggests that intra-regional warfare did not reach its climax until several centuries after the set­tlement shifts had occurred. Rather than experi­encing a period of slow political unification, following the chaotic end of the Middle Horizon (ca. AD 1000) as seen in the Cuzco region, the Lake Titicaca area may have witnessed a nearly continuous period of segmentation and conflict: Arkush writes: 
It is highly probable that drought and attendant 
resource stress played a significant part in the 
escalation of war in the late LIP. Resource 
stress could have fostered violent competition 
for limited arable land, and encourage raids on 
stored crops; it may have indirectly led to live­
stock rustling as people became more reliant 
on camelids, or perhaps it simply caused 
greater social friction between neighboring 
communities in hard times. Nevertheless, in 
the Titicaca basin, fort-building continued after 
the droughts eased, suggesting that warfare 
outlived this impetus and generated its own 
momentum. Good times did not result in peace 
any more than collapse resulted in widespread 
war. The causes of continued war are difficult 
to pinpoint securely, but it may have been 
power-hungry warlords, durable fortifications, 
and the cycles of revenge encouraged by seg­
mentary organization that embroiled the Colla 
in periodic wars for the rest of the LIP and 
beyond [Arkush 2008:365]. 
While we have a more coarsely grained chronol­ogy, in comparison with that of the Colla and Lupaqa, it is becoming increasingly clear that the presence of scattered, densely occupied, but inter­nally homogenous, defensively positioned, ridge­top sites in the Andahuaylas region forces us to

reexamine some of the basic assumptions con­
cerning the Chanka and their neighboring groups 

that have been derived from readings of Spanish Patronato 93 , 
accounts. Currently we find no archaeological evi­
dence to suggest that the Chanka were a highly 
stratified or uniquely powerful, ethnic group at the 
time of the Inca expansion. In short, the Late Inter­
mediate Period settlement pattern recorded in the 
Andahuaylas region is similar to those found across 
many other areas of the central highlands and sug­
gests that the Chanka were but one of numerous, 
relatively small polities (sefiorios) occupying spe­
cific regions of the Andes during this time period. 
Powerful Chanka leaders, or a loose confederation 
of central Andean ethnic groups, may have briefly 
arisen near the end of this period with the legendary 
Chanka-Inca War, but they have left few material 
correlates to be identified.

The fieldwork was con­ducted under the direction of Brian S. Bauer, Lucas C. Kellett, and Miriam Araoz Silva. Archival research for the project was directed by Sabine Hyland. During the course of the project, the locations of more than 600 archaeological sites, dating from the pre-ceramic period (9500-2200 B.C.) to imperial Inca times (ca. A.D. 1400-1532) , 
were recorded and hundreds of pages of archival documents were tran­scribed. Major funding for the project was provided by the John Heinz III Charitable Trust, the National Science Foundation (NSF 01 07074), and the National Endowment for the Humanities (FA 53 142) as well as the University of Illinois at Chicago (the Institute for the Humanities, the Office of Social Science Research, and the Department of Anthropology).
