ARCHITECTURE, SETTLEMENT, AND FORMATIVE DEVELOPMENTS 
IN THE EQUATORIAL ANDES: NEW DISCOVERIES IN THE 
DEPA RTMENT OF TUMBES, PERU 

Jerry D. Moore 
The cultural transformations associated·with the Formative period are pivotal for understanding the prehistory of the Amer­icas. Over the last.five decades, investigations in southwestern Ecuador have provided an early and robust set of archaeo­logical data relating to Archaic-to-Formative transformations as exemplified by the Las Vegas, Valdivia, Machalilla, and Chorrera archaeological traditions. However, recent archaeological research in adjacent zones of the equatorial Andes indicates that the transformations in southwestern Ecuador were paralleled by coeval but distinct developments. Recent (2006-2007) excavations in the Department o/Tumbes, Peru, have documented previously unknown Formative transfor­mations, including the development of substantial domestic architecture during the Archaic (ca. 4700-4330 B.C.E. ) and eurly Formative (ca. 3500-3100 B. C.E.), the shift from elliptical pole-and-thatch dwellings to rectangular wattle-and-daub structures at ca. 900-500 B.C.E., and the construction of public architecture and the establishment of a two-tiered settle­ment system by ca. 1000-800 B.C.E. These recently discovered archaeological patterns from Tumbes and additional data fi-om southern Ecuador provide the basis for revised comparative perspectives in which southwestern Ecuador is a significant­but no longer the only-vantage point for understanding the evolution of Formative societies in the equatorial Andes. 
Las tranformaciones cultumles asociadas con el Formativo son cloves para nuestro entendimiento de la prehistoria ameri­cana. En las andes ecuatoriales, la peninsula Santa Elena y las zonas cercanas def suroeste de Ecuador, nos han presentado wz temprano y robusto conjunto de datos arqueol6gicos sobre las transformaciones def Arcaico al Formativo coma las cul­turas arqueol6gicas de Las Vegas, Valdivia, Macha/ilia, y Chorrera. Sin embargo, investigaciones recientes en zonas aledafias de las Andes ecuatoriales muestran que las transformaciones que ocurrieron en el suroeste de Ecuador fueron acompafiadas par desarrollos coetdneos pero distintos en el sur de Ecuador y el norte def Peru. Investigaciones recientes (2006-2007) en el Departamento de Tumbes, Peru, descubrieron datos nuevos sabre el proceso Formativo y sus antecedentes en tres sitios: El Porvenir, Santa Rosa, y Ufia de Gato. Entre otros hallazgos, se incluyen Los restos de una estructura def la epoca Arcaica de 
A.C. 4700-4330, una casa eliptica con tamafio 12.8 x 11 m con unafecha de A.C. 3500---3100, y una secuencia de estructuras que murca el cambio ca. A. C. 9501800 a 500 de estructuras elipticas hechas de pa/ma y paste a estructuras rectangulares hechas de bahareque. Ademds, las excavaciones establecieron el desarrollo de arquitectura publica que comenz6 posiblemente para A. C. 1400 pero claramente Jue establecida para A.C. 1000-800, una epoca marcada tambien par un cambio fundamen­tal en los patrones de asentamiento en cual Ufia de Gato Jue el centro regional y El Porvenir una aldea pequefia. En fin, las descubrimientos nuevos de Tumbes y otros datos comparativos nos presentan una vision amplia en cual la penfnsula de Santa Elena representa una importante, pero no la unica, punto de vista para entender la evoluci6n de las sociedades del Formativo en/as Andes ecuatoriales.

on the developments associated with the Valdivia, Machalilla, and Chorrera traditions (Evans and Meggars 1957; Hill 1975; Holm 1985; Meggers and Evans 1962; Meggers et al. 1965; Staller 2001 a, 2001 b; Zeidler 2003, 2008; Zeidler and Pearsall 1994; Zevallos and Holm 1960). Combined with excavations at earlier Archaic Las Vegas culture sites (Malpass and Stothert 1992; Stothert 1988, 2003), investigations at Valdivia sites such as Real Alto and Loma Alta (Damp 1979, 1984, 1988; Lathrap 1971; Lathrap et al. 197 5; Lathrap et al. 1977; Marcos 1978, 1998, 2003; Marcos and Michczynski 1996; Marcos et al. 1999; Ubelaker 2003; Zeidler 1984, 2000, 2008) and archaeologi­cal surveys (Marcos 2003; Schwarz and Raymond 1996) have resulted in a particularly rich body from southwestern Ecuador. J. Scott Raymond has writ­ten: 
Just as the Viru valley for many years was the peephole through which Peruvian prehistory was viewed, so the Santa Elena region has been the vantage point from which the Ecuadorian Formative has been interpreted. Although there has been a concerted effort to counter the nar­row regional bias of the peninsula through research in the Guayas basin [Raymond et al. 1980], in the valleys of the El Oro province ... and in the wet lowlands of Esmeraldas ... , the sequence from Santa Elena and the neighbor­ing Valdivia and Chanduy valleys still serve as the principal framework for organizing, under­standing, and explaining the Formative soci­eties, particularly during the earliest phases 
[2003:35]. 
As Burger (2003) has cogently observed, dis­cussions of the "Ecuadorian" Formative are, in a sense, misnamed, projecting early-nineteenth­century political divisions deep into the prehispanic past (Staller 2000). Rather than a process unique to southwestern Ecuador, an emerging body of data indicates that parallel and coeval but distinctive Formative developments occurred elsewhere in the equatorial Andes of southern Ecuador and north­ern Peru. Archaeological data from the southern Ecuadorian highlands (Bruhns 2003; Guffroy 2004; Idrovo Urigiien 1999; Temme 1999), the southern Oriente region (Valdez 2008; Valdez et al. 2005), and the south coast of Ecuador (Staller 1994, 2000, 2001 a, 2001 b) suggest the need for a broader, com­parative perspective on Formative developments in the equatorial Andes (Zeidler 2008). 
Contributing to this reassessment, recent (2006-2007) excavations in the Department of Tumbes, Peru, have uncovered a surprisingly rich architectural record for the Archaic and Formative periods spanning ca. 4700-300 B.C.E. The fol­lowing discussion summarizes prehistoric archi­tectural data from three sites in the Tumbes region with significant Formative deposits: El Porvenir, Uiia de Gato, and Santa Rosa (Figures 1-5). Located on the edges of the floodplains of the Zaru­milla and Tumbes rivers, the material records of these sites indicate diachronic changes in domes­tic architecture, public architecture, and settlement patterns. Although other classes of archaeological data were recovered during the excavations and have been reported elsewhere (Moore 2008: Moore et al. 2008; Pajuelo 2006, 2007, 2008; Vilchez et al. 2007), the present article focuses on significant diachronic and regional variations in Formative architecture and built environments in the equato­rial Andes. 
There are solid theoretical reasons for focusing on Formative architecture. The built environment is reflective and constitutive of human behavior (Moore 1996, 2005:3-5), concretely expressing key aspects of Formative transformations, such as the development of sedentism, the evolution of social complexity, and the creation of new social orders (Beck et al. 2008; Flannery 1972, 2002; Joyce 2004; Lesure 1999; Lesure and Blake 2002). For example, Raymond has suggested that even during the Archaic period in southwestern Ecuador "shelters, flimsy as they may have been, were laden with social value and played a symbolic role" and further proposes that "symbolically, then, the con­cept of 'house' may have distinguished the local community within a region and identified and struc­tured relations among socio-residential units within a community" (2003:39, 52). Further, the con­struction of earthen mounds and other forms of "monumental" architecture may reflect reorgani­zations of social inequality and, in tum, become the physical referents for new social relations. Simi­larly, Heckenberger writes of the monu-mentalite of prehispanic settlements in Amazonia, noting that constructed earthworks "are particularly critical" for understanding those societies (2005: 123 ). Finally, an energetics approach to public architec-

ture (Abrams 1989; Childe 1974; Moore 1996; Vega-Centeno 2007) may provide insight into the concentration of political power and the degree of sociopolitical complexity among different soci­eties. This is well-traveled theoretical ground and suggests that a focus on architecture and settlement plans is analytically appropriate for a comparative study of the Formative period in the equatorial Andes. 
After a brief summary of archaeological inves­tigations in the Department of Tumbes, I present evidence regarding domestic architecture, public architecture, and settlement patterns for Formative Tumbes. I compare the Tumbes data against evi­dence from Formative sites within a 200-km radius, including the Santa Elena Peninsula, the highlands of El Oro, and the Oriente of Zamora-Chinchipe. This delineation excludes important cases farther to the north (e.g., Currie 1995; Lunniss 2008; Vil­laba 1988; Zeidler and Pearsall 1994) and south (Guffroy 1994; Guffroy et al. 1989; Kaulicke 1998), but some limits to the scope of this article are nee-

Previous Research and 
Archaeological Background 

In general prehistoric Tumbes has been ignored, archaeologically considered a "cultural backwater" (Staller 2000). The Proyecto Arqueol6gico Tumbes is a multiphase research program designed to reform that perspective. In 2006 and 2007 excavations were conducted at four archaeological sites, three of which contain Formative occupations: El Porvenir, Ufia de Gato, and Santa Rosa, sites recorded dur­ing a 1996 archaeological reconnaissance in the Tumbes region (Moore 2008; Moore et al. 1997). Before 1996, only 27 sites were recorded for the entire Department of Tumbes (Ishida 1960; Izumi and Terada 1961, 1966; Kauffman Doig 1987; Ravines 1973; Ravines and Matos 1983), and until 2003 the only major systematic excavations were the University of Tokyo's 1958 and 1960 investi­gations at the sites of Garbanzal and Pechiche, which involved only 13 days of excavation (Izumi and Terada 1966: 1; MejfaXesspe 1960:207). Seven radiocarbon dates obtained during the University of Tokyo's excavations were the only absolute dates available for the Department ofTumbes (Izumi and Terada 1966) and suggested a simple tripartite divi­sion of prehistory (modeled after Meggars's Ecuadorian framework): Formative (1800-500 B.C.E.), Regional Development (500 B.C.E.-500 C.E.), and Integration period (500-1500 C.E.; for additional discussion, see Currie 1985, 1989; Hoc­quenghem 1991, 1998; Hocquenghem et al. 1993; Izumi and Terada 1966; Richardson et al. 1990; cf. Moore 2008; Moore et al. 2008).

Consequently, a principal research goal has been revising this imprecise temporal framework (Table l ). While a detailed discussion of the proposed chronological revisions lies outside the focus of this article (see Moore 2008, for a discussion), several observations are relevant. First, the Archaic occu­pation ofTumbes dates to before 4700-4330 B.C.E. (Table 2). Second, the Formative period is signifi­cantly earlier than previously thought, dating to ca. 3500-3100 B.C.E. Third, the previously defined ceramic typologies for Tumbes and their chrono­logical associations (Estrada et al. 1964; Izumi and Terada 1966) have proven to be incorrectly dated, loosely associated, and complicated by presumed connections with sequences from other regions (for discussion, see Moore 2008; Moore et al. 2008; Pajuelo 2006; Pajuelo and Moore 2005). 
As noted above, Formative deposits were uncov­ered at three archaeological sites in the Tumbes region. The site of El Porvenir is located on a ter­race on the western floodplain of the Rio Zarumilla (Figure 2). The site consists of a group of six mounds surrounding an open area or possible plaza and comprising an area of 300 x 100 m (Vilchez et al. 2007). By the time of the 2006 excavations, three of the mounds had been partially or exten­sively destroyed by modem constructions, but Mounds I, II, and III were largely intact, with basal areas of 750-800 m2 and maximum heights of 1.0-1.6 m. Excavations focused on Mounds I and II and proceeded in block excavations by natural and cultural layers, exposing a stratigraphic sequence in an archaeological palimpsest of super-

The site of Uii.a de Gato is located 1.2 km north­west of El Porvenir, also on the western terrace of the Rio Zarumilla (Figure 4). The core of the site covers an area of approximately 225 x 175 m, marked by the remains of four large artificial mounds built around an irregular open space. These mounds have been partially destroyed by modem construction and road building. Mound I measures 32 x 23 m at its base and has a maximum height of 5.4 m, approximately 70-80 percent of its orig­inal size. Mound II is a stepped platform mound, which in 1996 had measured 42 x 26 m (Moore et al. 1997) but by 2007 had been reduced to 33. 7 x 
24.3 m. Mound II is 1.6 m tall, itself a reduction from its original height. Mound III was 16 x 16 m in area and had a height of 1.25 m when recorded in 1996 (Moore et al. 1997), but subsequent destruc­tion has left an intact area of less than 40 m2. Mound IV measured 13 x 9 m in area and stood 1.0 m tall in 1996. Modem houses now cover Mound lV, and the 2007 excavations were conducted only at Mounds I, II, and III. In addition to the central core of Uii.a de Gato, a more extensive area of midden covers an area of 500-600 x 300 m along the ter­race escarpment, the remains of a once-larger site reduced by erosion and human destruction. 
The site of Santa Rosa is located on the west­ern bank of the Rio Tumbes (Moore et al. 2008). The central portion of the site consists of three areas

excavation primarily focused on Compounds I and II, although two additional test pits were excavated in an area to the east where a diffuse deposit of domestic materials ("the barrio") covered an area of200 x200min l996 (Moore et a1.1997). Unfor­tunately, modem agricultural developments since 1996 have all but destroyed this area, leaving a small intact deposit of 50 x 30 m. All of the archi­tectural features from Santa Rosa discussed below come from the excavations in Compounds I and II. 
Excavations at the sites of El Porvenir, Santa Rosa, and Ufia de Gato documented significant shifts in domestic architecture, public architecture, and settlement patterns during the Archaic and For­mative periods in the Department of Tumbes. The distinction between "domestic" and "public" archi­tecture is not intended to be rigid. As Bowser and Patton (2004) have shown, significant political negotiations occur within domestic settings, par­ticularly within nonhierarchical societies, and the most public of spaces may be the loci for a variety of activities (see, e.g., Low 2000). Yet, for my immediate purposes, the distinction is useful. The constructions described as "domestic architecture" are relatively modest constructions associated with evidence of domestic activities-food preparation, tool maintenance, small-scale rituals, and so on. In contrast, the buildings described as "public archi­tecture" are significantly larger, more complex and varied constructions, exhibiting more elaborate decorative elements and lacking evidence of domestic activities. For these reasons, it makes sense to discuss and compare these constructions separately, which is then followed by a brief dis­cussion of settlement patterns. 
Archaic and Formative Domestic 
Architecture from Tumbes 

Excavations partially uncovered the remains of eight Archaic and Formative domestic structures at El Porvenir and Santa Rosa. The earliest structures (n 6) are the remains of relatively substantial

elliptical pole-and-thatch structures, while the lat­est structures (n 2) were rectangular dwellings 
= 
built with wattle-and-daub walls. The following briefly describes the archaeological remains that are more fully described elsewhere (Moore et al. 2008; Vilchez et al. 2007). 
Elliptical Structures 
The earliest architectural feature was found at El Porvenir in Mound I and consists of a well-defined floor, a curved alignment of paired post mo Ids, and two additional posts that indicate a circular struc­ture estimated to be I 8-20 m2 (Moore 2007; Fig­ure 6). Although no intramural features such as hearths were found in association, the presence of food remains suggests that this was a residential structure; no ceramics were found in association

with the floor. The structure is overlain by a thick and dense midden of oyster shell ( Ostra colum­bensis) also exposed in excavations across the site ;of El Porvenir. A radiometric sample immediately ·above the floor (BETA-222683), calibrated at two sigmas, dates to 4700--4340 B.C.E.; two other 
assays from the same oyster midden have calibrated 
dates of 4540-4290 B.C.E. (BETA-222671) and 
4220-3940 B.C.E. (BETA-22268 I). The architec­
tural feature predates the oyster midden and thus 
dates to the Archaic. 
The next-oldest known dwelling is an elliptical 
structure from Santa Rosa, Compound II, that mea­
sured 12.8 x 11 m; it was delineated by a 30-to 40­
cm-wide cobblestone foundation and large 
postholes (25-30 cm and 45-48 cm in diameter) in the center of the structure (Figure 7). Encircling a space of 120 m2, the structure probably was con­structed similar to Shuar dwellings in which large upright posts support a thatched roof (Descola 1996; Rostain 2006; Zeidler 1984). An associated radiocarbon sample of charred material (BETA­239643) produced calibrations of 3490-3470 B.C.E., 3370-3270 B.C.E., or 3240-3110 B.C.E.; no ceramics were found in association. The ellip­tical structure is coeval with an ashy, deeply buried, low-density midden found across the site of Santa Rosa dated to 3330-2900 B.C.E. (BETA-239641) and 3070-2740 cal B.C.E. (BETA-239642). Fur­ther, the structure and midden are contemporary

with a large (2. 1-m-diameter) formal circular hearth, undisturbed since its last use, which pro­duced a I 00+ g sample of wood charcoal that dated to 3350-29 10 cal B.C.E. (BETA-239640). The dates from the elliptical structure, ashy midden, and circular hearth indicate an early Formative occupation at Santa Rosa contemporary with Val­divia phases l and 2 (Marcos and Michczynski 1996; Marcos et al. 1999; Zeidler 2003). 
The partial remains of four elliptical structures constructed between ca. 1200 and 300 B.C.E. were exposed during excavations at El Porvenir. Two of the structures were found in Mound I (Figure 8); two were found in Mound II. One of the Mound II structures was too destroyed to reconstruct its plan (see below), but the three other El Porvenir dwellings were similar constructions with paired postholes indicating curving walls and floors made from thick layers of clay. Presumably, all these structures had some form of thatched roofing. None of these structures was completely exposed, but in several cases enough of the structure was exca­vated to roughly estimate its minimum size. The earliest structure (Mound I, Units 5 and 8, Floor 5) dating to 1240--800 B.C.E. (BETA-222682) had been largely destroyed by subsequent construc­tions, but three sets of paired postholes, a larger inte­

rior posthole, and sections of intact floor indicate an elliptical structure approximately 5-6 x 3-4 m in area. Subsequently, an elliptical structure (Floor 4) was built on Mound I, its construction dating to 1 100--800 B.C.E. based on bracketing radiometric samples (BETA-222682, -222674). This elliptical structure is indicated by paired postholes, a thick well-made clay floor, and a basin-shaped hearth. This structure would have measured approximately 8x6 m. 
Two other structures were found in El Porvenir, Mound 2. One structure is indicated by a few sec­tions of thick gray floor and a basin hearth; a 14C date based on a charcoal sample from the floor dates to 9 I 0--780 B.C.E. (BETA-222666). Because of the poor preservation, it is impossible to deter­mine the original dimensions or additional archi­tectural details about this structure. A second, more intact elliptical structure at Mound 2 (Units I, 3-4, 12-13) was indicated by a curving alignment of small postholes, large postholes, and a clay floor, suggesting a structure approximately 7 x 3-4 m in

area. Based on bracketing dates, this floor dates to ca. 800-500B.C.E. 
Rectangular Structures 

The remains of two rectangular wattle-and-daub structures were uncovered from late Formative con­texts at El Porvenir, one each from Mounds I and IL The Mound I house was indicated by a two per­pendicular alignments of post molds anchored by a comer post mold 17 cm in diameter (Figure 9). 
Approximately 25 percent of the structure was exposed, suggesting a construction at least 8 x 4 m in size. A well-preserved clay floor, a simple hearth, food debris, and utilitarian ceramics indicate a domestic structure. The Mound II house is marked by a well-preserved clay floor 9.2 x 4.25 min size (Figure 10); although no post molds were found, clay daub associated with the floor exhibits cane imprints, and one fragment is from an exterior, right-angled comer of a structure.

The wattle-and-daub residences were built sometime after 950-800 B .C.E. In Mound I, a char­coal sample from below the rectangular floor (BETA-222674) dated to 920-790 B.C.E. In Mound II, a charcoal sample below the rectangu­lar floor (BETA-222666) dated to 910-780 B.C.E. Further, excavations in a stratified midden on the northern edge of Mound II uncovered dense con­centrations of daub in layers dating from 790 to 370 
B.C.E. (BETA-222669). Therefore, I suggest that the shift from elliptical to rectangular structures occurred between 950-800 and 500 B.C.E. in the Department of Tumbes. 
Formative Public Architecture from Tumbes 
Currently, the only known Formative period pub­lic architecture in the Tumbes region is from Ufia de Gato. The earliest known public architecture is a ramped mound (Mound II) built in the middle of the second millennium B.C.E. (Figure 11 ). In this first construction phase, I estimate that Mound II measured 20 m (north-south) x 26 m (east-west) and had a maximum height of . 7-1.0 tn. The mound was surfaced with a 3-cm-thick cap of gray clay that covered fill. This first phase was constructed at approximately ca. 1490-1430 B.C.E. A marine shell sample from the surface of the ramp (BETA­239633) is calibrated to 1720-1430 B.C.E. A char­coal sample from below the ramp surface (BETA-239634) calibrates at two sigmas to 1490-1360 or 1350-1310 B.C.E. Although the dates could indicate stratigraphic mixing, the intact ramp surface indicates that the stratigraphy has not been disturbed, tentatively suggesting that the ramped mound was built sometime after 1490-1430 B.C.E. 
Subsequently, Mound II was expanded to the east and raised to create a larger, taller, stepped platform mound (Figure 11 ). The base of the mound

covered an area of 42 m (east-west) x 26 m (north-south), with a maximum height of 1.5-2 m. The eastern extension was built using a variation of a box and fill technique, involving construction of a retaining wall from courses of hand-molded, "bread loaf' adobes and then filling the space between the wall and the original eastern edge of Mound IL A radiocarbon sample from Mound II, Operation I, Unit 4, Level 10, resulted in a cali­brated date of 1020-810 B.C.E. (BETA-229632). 

Contemporary with the Mound II extension, construction began on Mound I, which ultimately became the largest public architecture at Ufia de Gato. Currently measuring 32 x 23 m at its base and 5.4 m tall, with a volume of 1,426 m3 (Figure 4), the modem mound represents an estimated 70-80 percent of the prehispanic construction, sug­gesting an original volume of 1,700-2,000 m3•

Based on stratigraphic exposures on the eastern side of Mound I, the mound was built in at least four stages over a relatively brief time during the tenth century B.C.E. (Figure 12; Table 3). Initially, Mound I was a relatively small platform mound about 1.65 m tall built from yellow-brown, hand­modeled "loaf-shaped" adobes set in a gray clay matrix. The initial mound was topped with a gray clay floor, and its sides were covered with red stucco. Subsequently, the mound was covered with a layer of fill and coated with a layer of gray clay. The third construction phase involved extending MoundI northward by building a bench-like exten­sion and thus forming a stepped platform mound. In the fourth and final construction phase, this bench surface was filled in and the mound was raised and surfaced with a grayish brown clay. 
If the construction phases in the northeastern profile characterize the entire mound, then appar­ently most of Mound I was constructed during the final phase 4. A very approximate estimate of con­struction effort can be derived using these propor­tions and labor estimates obtained by Erasmus ( 1965), who determined that a workman using tra­ditional hand tools could excavate approximately 
2.6 m3 per day. Using the estimated volume of 1,700-2,000 m3, then approximately 650-770 person-days were required to excavate the mater­ial incorporated into the mound. Doubling that esti­mate to include transport and construction indicates that approximately 1,300-1,500 person-days were required to build Mound I-a project for 20 peo­ple working two to three months. 
Just east of Mound I, a distinct series of con­structions were built in the extensively damaged Mound III. Sometime after 2200-1100 B.C.E. and before 780-450 B.C.E. a small mound was built from hand-modeled, semispherical adobes made from dark red clay. Subsequently, a rectangular building was constructed, cutting into the red adobe mound. Only a small portion of this construction was preserved, insufficient to estimate its original size, though it was 3.5 m on one axis. Based on a radiometric sample of marine shell (BETA­239635), the structure dates to 780-450 B.C.E. This structure was built with a lower half-wall of "bread loaf' adobes, topped by a wattle-and-daub wall and enclosing a well-plastered floor. The inte­rior walls of this structure had been painted and dec­orated with a simple form of bas-relief. Daub fragments with cane impressions and traces of red­dish brown stucco were found on top of the floor. One fragment displayed a rolled coil of clay pressed onto the still-wet daub; the coil formed a right angle. Notably, all the decorated daub fragments were found with the painted surfaces down and imme­diately on the floor; the decorated fragments had fallen from inside the structure. This is the only example of interior decoration currently known from a Formative construction in the Department of Tumbes. 
Summary of Archaic and Formative Architectural and Settlement Patterns in Tumbes 
First, the earliest structures at El Porvenir and Santa Rosa indicate that substantial, relatively large struc­tures were constructed in the Tumbes region by the fifth and fourth millennia B.C.E. As discussed below, the Tumbes structures are significantly larger and more substantial than contemporary dwellings known from early Valdivia settlements (Damp 1984, 1988; Raymond 2003; Zeidler 1984). Currently, no dwellings of this antiquity have been reported from El Oro or adjacent areas of northern Peru (Guffroy 2004; Staller 1994). 
Second, a basic shift from elliptical pole-and­thatch dwellings to rectangular wattle-and-daub houses occurred ca. 950/800-500 B.C.E. in the Department of Tumbes. Similar variations from circular to rectangular structures have been observed in diverse archaeological traditions, inter­preted as reflecting multiple factors including the evolution of agrarian economies, an increased emphasis on interior storage, and the development of extended-family residential groups, among other factors (Flannery 1972, 2002). Based on current archaeological knowledge from Tumbes, none of these factors obviously applies. Agriculture was established at Real Alto by Valdivia phase 3 B .C.E.

in southern Ecuador (Pearsall 1978, 2002; Pearsall and Piperno 1990; Zarrillo et al. 2007; cf. Staller and Thompson 2002), and maize phytoliths are reported from the even earlier Las Vegas site (Stothert et al. 2003); there is every reason to think that maize-based agrarian societies long preceded the 950/800-500 B.C.E. shift from elliptical to rec­tangular dwellings (Tykot and Staller 2002). Nei­ther is there any evidence for an increase in intramural storage; there are no known storage pits or bins associated with either elliptical or rectan­gular structures. And finally, there is no evidence for the development of extended-family residential groups associated with the shift from elliptical to rectangular dwellings. House sizes are broadly sim­ilar-15-48 m2; rectangular dwellings are not larger than elliptical ones, nor are they multiroomed constructions. At this early stage of archaeological research in the Tumbes region, there is no clear explanation for this reorganization in domestic architecture, except to note that it seems associated with a change in building materials, specifically the shift from pole and thatch to hand-modeled adobes and wattle and daub. While hand-modeled adobes were incorporated into floors and hearths in ellip­tical pole-and-thatch structures, loaf-shaped adobes first appear in either linear walls or in mound con­struction. Although apsidal wattle-and-daub struc­tures are known from other regions of the world, all wattle-and-daub structures known from the Tumbes region have rectangular plans, including the late prehispanic structure at Loma Saavedra (Moore et al. 2005) and modern constructions (Jerry D. Moore, field notes, June 2005). Thus, while it is known that dwellings changed from ellip­tical/apsidal to rectangular plan at ca. 950/800-500 B.C.E., it is unclear what this change implies. 
Third, the creation of platform mounds began perhaps as early as ca. 1400 B.C.E. and was well established by 1000-800 B.C.E. Initially, mound construction involved the placement of unconsol­idated fill that was then covered by clay floors, but as mound height increased, structural features were required to retain and support the fill. This took sev­eral forms. Hand-modeled adobe bricks were set in a mud matrix to create more stable volumes. Walls of "bread loaf' adobe bricks were used to retain mound fill. Associated with these changes is a significant increase in construction labor, with mound construction requiring the sustained effort of labor from multiple households. In contrast, building a pole-and-thatch dwelling required the residence group's labor, supplemented by short­term assistance from other men, similar to the arrangement described for the Shuar (Jivaro) in which the house owner is assisted by "one or two close male relatives" and a half-dozen men to carry the main house posts (Hamer 1972:45). 
Fourth, with the development of platform mounds between 1400 and 1000 B.C.E., settlement plans diverged. El Porvenir consists of a simple cluster around a central open space or plaza, while Ufia de Gato has a central core marked by platform mounds and plazas surrounded by residential areas. The central core constructions at Ufia de Gato were distinctive, incorporating diverse architectural forms, construction techniques (box and fill, fill and cob, adobe and wattle), and decorative elements (painted stucco, modeled reliefs). Unlike El Por­venir, which was marked by symmetries in settle­ment plan and architectural practices, Ufia de Gato was characterized by distinctions-between a site core surrounded by a large residential zone and among the different forms of public architecture: tall mounds, stepped platform mounds, and wattle­and-daub constructions with decorated interior walls. 
The creation of platform mounds suggests that a two-tiered settlement hierarchy had developed in the Tumbes region during the latter half of the sec­ond millennium B.C.E., in which Ufia de Gato was the local center and El Porvenir was an affiliated hamlet, probably only one of several such com­munities (Moore et al. 1997). The hypothesis of the existence of a two-tiered settlement system is bol­stered by Ufia de Gato's and El Porvenir's differ­ential involvement in long-distance obsidian exchange. Residents at both settlements had access to obsidian from two sources, principally from Mul­lumica, located 435 km to the northeast and due east of Quito, and to a lesser extent the Carboncillo source in the Saraguro region, approximately 115 km northeast of Tumbes (Ogburn 2007; Shackley and Ogburn 2008; cf. Burger et al. 1994). Although obsidian was relatively scarce at both sites, it was more commonly encountered at Ufia de Gato, which possibly served as a redistributive center (Moore et al. 2008:269-271). 
To summarize, archaeological data from Santa Rosa, El Porvenir, and Ufia de Gato point to sig-

nificant diachronic variations in domestic archi­tecture, public architecture, and settlement plan during the Archaic and the Formative periods. By the fifth and fourth millennia B.C.E., elliptical pole­and-thatch residences were built, an architectural pattern sustained until 950/800-500 B.C.E., when residences shifted to rectangular wattle-and-daub constructions. Platform mounds were first con­structed perhaps by 1400 B.C.E. but were larger and incorporated more sophisticated construction techniques by ca. 1000-800 B.C.E. These devel­opments also suggest the existenc_e of a two-tiered settlement system in the Tumbes region in which Una de Gato was a regional center. In short, the archaeological data from Tumbes contribute to a broader vision of Formative developments, espe­cially when compared to data from adjacent regions. 
Formative Trajectories in the Equatorial 
Andes: Comparative Perspectives 

The archaeological data from Tumbes can be com­pared to archaeological patterns from other For­mative period sites in Guayas (Damp 1979, 1984; Lathrap et al. 197 5; Lathrap et al. 1977; Marcos 1978, 2003; Marcos and Michczynski 1996; Mar­cos et al. 1999; Raymond 2003; Stothert 1988; Zei­dler 1984, 2000, 2003, 2008), El Oro (Staller 1994, 2001a, 2001 b ), Azuay (Grieder et al. 2002; Grieder et al. 2009; Temme 1999), Loja (Bruhns 2003; Gomis 1999; Guffroy 2004 ), and Zamora-Chichipe (Valdez 2008; Valdez et al. 2005). A broader com­parative perspective points to marked regional vari­ations in cultural trajectories during the Formative, variations expressed in domestic architecture, pub­lic architecture, and settlement plans. 
Domestic Architecture 
The earliest domestic architecture comes from the Archaic site of OGSE-80 on the Santa Elena Penin­sula, where Stothert (1988:50-54) uncovered the remains of a relatively ephemeral structure less than 1.5 m in diameter, perhaps a temporary shel­ter (Raymond 2003:39), dating to 8018-7453 
B.C.E. The sequence ofValdivia dwellings is more complete. Damp (1979, 1984, 1988) excavated a set of early Valdivia dwellings, indicated by ellip­tical patterns of small post molds and domestic debris. At Real Alto, the best-preserved Valdvia I dwelling, Structure 2-77, measured 4.5 x 3.2 m 
(14.4 m2) as delineated by 30 postholes, 5-10 cm in diameter, that formed an elliptical wall and artic­ulated with a center post. Sun-dried clay chunks interpreted as daub fragments were found on the floor. Damp (1979:211, 1984:578) suggests that Structure 2-77 dates to ca. 3250 B.C.E. At Loma Alta, the best-preserved dwelling was Structure 4, which dates to Valdivia I/II with an associated radio­metric date of 2680 ± 160 B.C.E. (GX-7699). Struc­ture 4 was an elliptical dwelling measuring 3.2 x 
2.3 m and was built by excavating a wall trench and then placing the posts in the trench; this was indi­cated by a "ribbon-like feature" of organic mater­ial and some postholes (Damp 1984:579-580). 
Middle Valdivia dwellings were significantly larger and more substantial than early Valdivia structures. For example, Valdivia phase 3, Struc­ture 1, was 
a wall-trench house whose floor was a shal­low saucer-shaped pit excavated about 21 cen­timeters into the sterile soil. The house was large and elliptical, measuring twelve by eight meters. Its walls, typical of Valdivia houses, were made of massive, closely packed, verti­cal logs placed in a continuous elliptical trench and covered with a thick coating of mud. Two pairs of interior posts supported a high gabled roof [Lathrap et al. 1977:8]. 
Zeidler ( 1984) documents architectural plans for 41 middle Valdivia structures, of which 15 were sufficiently complete to measure floor area and associate with specific phases in the Valdivia sequence. These data demonstrate a dramatic increase in house size between Valdivia J/11 and Valdivia III and thereafter, with mean house sizes of 49.10 m2 (Valdvia III), 51.60 m2 (Valdivia IVN), and 53. 77 m2 (Valdivia VI). In addition, data from eight "proto-Machalilla" structures-one of which was "rhomboidal," the only Real Alto dwelling not elliptical or circular-indicate a mean area of 70.37 m2• 
To date, no house plans have been published from Machalilla contexts, although partial excava­tions have encountered "two partial house floors in section during site testing in the Rio Verde drainage, indicating floor deposits between 20-30 cm thick as well as the presence of sub-floor hearths and a

sub-floor pit" (Zeidler 2008:467. No Chorrera house plans have been published. 
Guffroy (2004) has published architectural data from the site of La Vega, located in the province ofLoja. Structure 1 (Guffroy 2004:47-50) has an associated date of 2787 ± 94 B.P. (or 1212-797 cal B.C.E. at two sigmas) and dates to Catamayo 
B. The semicircular structure is 8 m long and 5 m at its greatest width and thus has a floor area of approximately 31 m2. As reconstructed, Structure 1 had a curved foundation and sloping walls sup­ported by a large central post, leaving the western side open. Extramural features indicated domes­tic activities. Some 25 m north of Structure 1 another set of architectural features (Structure 2) actually consist of two constructions: a circular foundation made of large cobbles set in mud mor­tar, followed by a rectangular construction marked by a double course of foundations. Neither build­ing was complete, and the rectangular construc­tion probably incorporated stones from the earlier construction. The circular structure is recon­structed as approximately 10 x 8 m (Guffroy 2004:50). Only a corner of the rectangular struc­ture was preserved, but it was at least 7 x 3 m in area. A hearth inside the circular structure con­tained carbon dated to 2900 ± 60 B.P. ( Guffroy 2004:57) or 1269-919 cal B.C.E. The circular structure at La Vega employed a building tech­nique similar to the large elliptical structure at Santa Rosa. Another parallel is the use of whole Spondylus shells placed into the mud matrix of the floor (Guffroy 2004:55-57), a ritual practice asso­ciated with constructions at Santa Rosa and at El Porvenir (Moore et al. 2008:271-275). 
Another late Formative structure from the south­ern Ecuadorian highlands is reported by Temme ( 1999) from Putushio in the province of Azuay. Temme (1999: 134) describes a multicomponent site with three rectangular structures associated with late Formative dates. One structure (Complejo F 240/15800) is described as "a wattle and daub construction with small rectangular subdivisions" (Temme 1999: 134; my translation) and dated to 2560 ± 85 B.P. (842-409 cal B.C.E.). The second construction (F-15), dating to 2360 ± 130 B.P. (798-164 cal B .C.E. ), was "a simple foundation of a single course of stones" (Temme 1999: 134; my translation). A third construction (F 1167) is described as an alignment of stones placed next to a paved plaza and associated with a date of 2450 ± 65 B.P. (765-678 or 674-405 cal B.C.E.); excava­tions in this feature recovered a fragment of daub with cane impressions on its dorsal surface and incised lines and red paint on its finished surface (Temme 1999:134-135). Unfortunately, no com­plete plans or dimensions for the structures are available from Putushio. 
Similarly, Bruhns and colleagues have uncov­ered a number of well-made floors during their excavations at Pirincay. Although no dwelling has been completely exposed, a pattern of post molds forming a right-angled comer suggests a rectan­gular building dating to ca. 1200 B.C.E. (Bruhns 2003:149). Locally available calcium carbonate was used as floor plaster, and fragments of daub indicate that the dwelling was a wattle-and-daub construction. 
Finally, Grieder and colleagues (Grieder et al. 2002; Grieder et al. 2009: 18-23) have reported on their excavations at Challuabamba, located near Cuenca, which uncovered a series of wattle-and­daub domestic structures dating from ca. 2000 
B .C.E. The excavations did not identify a complete structure, but early observations at the site by Uhle (1922) mentioned both apsidal and rectangular buildings, although the structures uncovered by Grieder appear rectilinear (Grieder et al. 2009: 18-20). Large fragments of daub with wat­tle impressions indicate that walls were some 10 cm thick. At ca. 1450 B.C.E., some domestic struc­tures incorporated cobblestone revetments that served as retaining walls along the Rio Tombe­bamba. 
Public Architecture 
As with the other classes of archaeological data, some of the best records of the development of public architecture come from Valdivia sites, par­ticularly Real Alto and La Emerenciana. At Real Alto, the transformations in domestic architecture that occurred after Valdivia 2a/3 were paralleled by the creation of public architecture. Marcos pro­vides a succinct summary: 
During the second period, that lasted some 600 years, between 3000 BCE and 2400 BCE, there were important changes in intrasite settlement patterns, and community development. During Valdivia Phases 2b and 3, a major change took

place in Real Alto. The circular village gave way to a rectangular pre-urban settlement with a central plaza. It covered approximately 16 hectares. In the Plaza, four mounds topped by public buildings, looked down on the open space. The two largest mounds, Mound "A" or "Fiesta-House Mound," and Mound "B" or "Charnel House Mound," faced each other in the northern third of the open plaza. These two mounds and the space between them formed "the Ceremonial Precinct." The two smaller mounds, Mound "C" on the nort;heast sector of the plaza, and Mound "D" on the southwest­ern side, appear to have been designated for meetings and ceremonies by the "initiated few" in each one of the village halves [ 1998:314]. 
Marcos' s excavations in the Fiesta Mound indi­cated a minimum of eight rebuilding and resurfac­ing "epochs" between Valdivia 2 and 7 (Marcos 1978:23, 526, 1988; Staller 1994:47; Zeidler 1984: 13-15). Approximately 50 x 37 mat its base and 1.4 m tall, the Fiesta Mound contained features indicating recurrent feasting and rituals. Based on published plans, the opposite Charnel House Mound measured 125 x 40 mat its base, stood 1.8 m tall, and was topped by an elliptical 12.5-x-7-m structure (Lathrap et al. 1977 :8-9; Zeidler 2008:463). This mound held the tomb of an adult female, an associated but disarticulated male skele­ton, and seven secondary burials in a common grave. The major mounds at Real Alto were asso­ciated with distinctive rituals. 
A well-reported example of Valdivia 7-8 pub­lic architecture is at La Emerenciana, province of El Oro, and dates to ca. 1850-1680 B.C.E. (Staller 1994:230, 2000, 2001a, 2001 b; Staller and Thomp­son 2002; Tykot and Staller 2002). The La Emeren­ciana mound was built on a modified dune, capped by a hard-packed clay surface, and then had two oval daub platforms on its top; the constructed mound was 75 x 47 m and 1.5 m tall (Staller 1994:325). The edge of the mound was fronted by four steps or low terraces built with retaining walls. The La Emerenciana mound apparently began as a residential construction but then became a funer­ary/ritual locus at ca. 2310 cal B .C.E., as four buri­als were placed upright in shallow graves, covered in red pigment, and shrouded with fishing nets or textiles. Later deposits of burnt fauna and plant foods and smashed ceramics may represent post-

funerary offerings or feasts (Staller 2001 b). Mound construction at La Emerenciana exemplifies the development of "large Phase 8 civic-ceremonial centers with monumental public architecture of a magnitude not seen in earlier Valdivia phases" (Zei­dler 2008:464). As Marcos observes, "During this period, the great changes that led to the consolida­tion of the Formative process were crystallized" (2003:18). 
Such crystallizations are not evident in Loja dur­ing the coeval Catamayo A phase (Guffroy 2008: 892). While one site (Quebrada de los Cu yes) was interpreted as a hamlet, Guffroy observes, "The majority of sites studied are of limited extents and do not appear to represent important settlements, but rather extended family residential sites or spe­cial activity sites" (2004:85-86; my translation). Similarly no public architecture was uncovered at Challuabamba, although there is evidence for a high-status burial placed in the floor of a pole-and­thatch structure (Grieder et al. 2002: 171). 
Given this modest pattern of public architecture in the southern Ecuadorian highlands, the early cer­emonial architecture at Santa Ana-La Florida, described by Valdez and colleagues (Valdez 2008; Valdez et al. 2005), is surprisingly complex. Located in the southern Oriente province of Zamora-Chinchipe, Santa Ana-La Florida provides a robust set of Archaic and early Formative dates between 4323 and 2373 cal B.C.E. (Valdez 2008:879-880). In addition to elaborate polished stone vessels and figurines and a stirrup-spout ves­sel showing a shaman emerging from a Spondylus shell (Valdez 2008:882), the site also contains a complex of ceremonial architecture. Valdez pro­vides a useful description: 
The architectural remains that have been uncovered display the general layout of what seems to be a local ceremonial center. At the present date, the stone foundations of several round structures that are clustered in a large double-row circle characterize the site. The circle measures 40 min diameter and obvi­ously divides the precinct in two distinct com­ponents: an exterior section marked by several ring-shaped structures, and an interior space where three sets of rectangular structures are symmetrically opposed in tiers. There are very few signs of domestic refuse middens through­out the explored parts of the site.

To complete the general picture, the south­eastern end of the naturally descending river­bank terrace has been artificially transformed. A complicated construction process has ele­vated and leveled a horizontal plane of 80 m2. A series of concentric stone contention walls held and reinforced the riverbank fall line. In the interior of the terrace, the walls convened and formed a spiral point of origin. At the very center of this stone coil, a ceremonial hearth was found, with an offering cache placed under small stones. In the interior spaces between some of the concentric walls, burial offerings-composed of turquoise beads and polished stone bowls-were deposited. We assume that these were accompanying proba­ble elite burials, but the bone conservation is so poor that only small fragments of a human skull were recovered [2008:872]. 
Settlement Plans 
As with the other comparative domains, the most complete information about shifts in settlement plans comes from Real Alto. Zeidler provides a succinct summary of these changes: 
The Early Valdivia village was laid out in a horseshoe shape with small flimsy bent-pole dwellings forming a ring around a small open plaza. Each dwelling probably housed a nuclear family. At the opening of the U-shaped plaza is evidence of ritual activity, presumably of a communal nature. By Phase 3, the Real Alto village grew into an elliptical plan mea­suring 400m X 300m. Dwellings again form a dense ring around a long plaza, but the house structures become much larger and more per­manent in their construction, indicating extended family dwellings having consider­able longevity. At the center of the new con­figuration are two small opposing mounds each supporting a ceremonial structure .... By Late Valdivia times [phases 6-7] habitation area becomes reduced within the village, as small daughter settlements appear adjacent to flood­plain agricultural plots and the ceremonial precinct begins to serve a wider local area [2008:463-464]. 
Marcos (2003) significantly amends this sce­nario, venturing some population estimates for dif­ferent phases at Real Alto. In phases 1 and 2a (4400-3300cal B.C.E.) the village of Real Alto vil­lage had 50-60 inhabitants living in 12-15 small dwellings, whereas in phases 2b and 3 (3000-2400 cal B.C.E.) there was a significant population of 600-1,1 10 residents living in 90-100 dwellings (Marcos 2003:17, cf. 14-15). This lasted until phases 4-7 (2400-1800 cal B.C.E.) "when part of the on-site population moved from a central loca­tion at Real Alto to 5 satellite hamlets, or 'daugh­ter' communities, along the Rfo Verde and Rio Real. Each of these communities consisted of five to ten houses with 40-100 inhabitants" (Marcos 2003: 17-18; original emphasis). The population at Real Alto declined to an estimated 500-1,000 inhabitants living in 60-80 dwellings (Marcos 2003: 18). This model views Real Alto as becom­ing a regional center by ca. 2400-1800 B.C.E., the major ceremonial and political locus among a small number of nearby hamlets. To summarize, the growth in Real Alto's size from phase l/2a to phase 2b/3 was paralleled by greater formalization of the settlement plan and concomitant increase in pop­ulation and size. Real Alto developed into a regional center whose resident population decreased some­what but apparently maintained a central sociopo­litical position in an emergent, two-tiered network of settlements. 
As noted above, no similar evidence for changes in settlement plans is known currently from the highlands ofLoja, where settlements are either dis­persed homesteads or small hamlets (Guffroy 2004 ). As Bruhns has observed for the Ecuadorian highlands, "There are apparently no large sites or readily identifiable special purpose architecture. The historic situation of a population scattered in farmsteads or hamlets without urban centers and no architecturally differentiated ceremonial cen­ters appears to have had a considerable time depth in the southern highlands" (2003:148). Bruhns's generalization would appear to characterize the Formative settlement at Challuabamba (Grieder et al. 2002; Grieder et al. 2009). And while it is true, as Bruhns notes, that "the apparent paucity of spe­cialized architecture in the south does not mean a lack of specialization" at the community level (2003: 152), it does suggest that Formative period regional settlement patterns differed between the coast and highland zones.

Comparisons and Hypotheses 
Given the current unevenness in archaeological understanding of the Formative in the equatorial Andes, any comparative study provides the basis for hypotheses rather than firm conclusions. What is broadly apparent, however, is that the Formative developments in Guayas, El Oro, Loja, Zamora­Chichipe, and Tumbes are characterized by marked regional variations rather than a single develop­mental trajectory. 
First, current data indicate that there are sig­nificant interregional variations in Archaic and early Formative domestic architecture in terms of antiquity, size, and building techniques. As noted above, the earliest structure encountered in El Por­venir, Mound I, Floor 6, is an elliptical structure of doubled posts, enclosing an area of 18-20 m2 and dating to 4700-4300 cal B.C.E. This structure is more substantial than the Las Vegas structure reported by Stothert or the early Valdivia dwellings from Loma Alta or Real Alto. Similarly, the struc­ture at Santa Rosa (3500-3 100 B.C.E.), Compound II, is coeval with Valdivia phases 1 and 2a but at 
12.8 x I Om (120 m2) is similar in size to later struc­tures at Real Alto built during Valdivia 2b-3. Only later are similar-sized structures known from the Loja region, during Catamayo B and C (ca. 1200-900 and 900-500 B.C.E.). lfthe increase in dwelling size at Real Alto reflected a reorganiza­tion of residence groups from individual families to multifamily units (Marcos 2003: 17; Zeidler 1984:69-70), then this reorganization may have occurred in the Tumbes region one or more cen­turies before it occurred in Guayas or Loja. 
Second, Formative public architecture varied in scale and social function in the region. Although public architecture is not known from the Forma­tive in Loja, the examples from Guayas, El Oro, and Tumbes point to different ritual practices and cultural associations. At Real Alto, constructions are associated with either feastings or funerals (Lathrap et al. I 977; Marcos 2003; Raymond 2003; Zeidler 2008); similar activities are indicated at the late Valdivia mounds at La Emerenciana (Staller 
1994, 2000). This transformation of public archi­tecture into funerary architecture may be reflected by the Santa Ana-La Florida site in Zamora­Chinchipe (Valdez 2008), although this awaits more extensive excavation 

In contrast, there is no evidence for funerary associations for the public architecture at Ufia de Gato. The only features interpreted as offerings appear to be linked to single-event construction rit­uals rather than recurrent rites of commemoration (Moore et al. 2008:271-274). Again, the data sets are limited, but it seems as though public architec­ture is associated with distinctive sets of ritual prac­tices in the Valdivia and Tumbes regions. 
Third, two-tiered settlement hierarchies devel­oped by 2400-1800 B. C.E. on the Santa Elena Peninsula, at approximately 1400-1000 B. C.E. in the Tumbes region, whereas similar settlement hier­archies do not exist during the Formative period in the Ecuadorian highlands. The evidence for the emergence of a Valdivia 4-7 two-tiered settlement hierarchy in Guayas significantly precedes similar developments in Tumbes. Yet in both regions set­tlement hierarchies developed during the Forma­tive period, characterized by a relatively large regional center with public architecture (e.g., Real Alto or Ufia de Gato) and smaller affiliated sites nearby (the five Valdivia hamlets on the Rio Verde and Rio Real drainages or the hamlet of El Porvenir on the Rio Zarumilla). While the regional network associated with Valdivia 4-7 appears more exten­sive than that in Tumbes, this could simply reflect the lack of archaeological investigations at other sites along the Zarumilla drainage. In contrast, sim­ilar settlement hierarchies apparently did not develop in the southern Ecuadorian highlands dur­ing the Formative period (Bruhns 2003 ; Grieder et al. 2009; Guffroy 2004). 
Fourth, the Valdivia 7-8 abandonment of Real Alto and the emergence of late Valdivia sites in Manabi and El Oro contrast with the in situ conti­nuities in the Tumbes region. The lengthy sequence of occupation at Real Alto ends with Valdivia 7, when the regional center is abandoned and late Val­divia settlements develop to the north in Manabi and south in El Oro. In contrast, the sites of Ufia de Gato and El Porvenir continue to be occupied into the late Formative period until the fifth-fourth centuries B.C.E. Further, the construction of pub­lic architecture at Ufia de Gato continued and, if anything, accelerated ca. 1000-800 cal B. C.E. dur­ing the late Formative period. Thus, the creation of public architecture and the reorganization of set­tlement plans appear to have been an autochtho­nous development in Tumbes, one that drew on

earlier local patterns, rather than one stimulated by the spread of Valdivia traditions. 
Conclusion 
Significant and precocious developments during the Archaic and Formative periods in the equator­ial Andes were not limited to the Santa Elena Penin­sula. Despite the unevenness in available archaeological data from other regions, it is clear that contemporary and independent developments occurred elsewhere in southern Ecuador and north­ern Peru. While apparently there were interactions between the populations in these regions, they maintained distinctive cultural practices-an infer­ence drawn by other scholars working with differ­ent data sets. For example, Guffroy writes of the ceramic styles in Loja, "The Catamayo A phase [ceramic] material does not present any of the traits most characteristic of Valdivia culture. It is possi­ble, however, to identify general similarities, whose significance ... is difficult to establish" (2004:87; my translation). Similarly, Staller has observed that the ceramic data indicate "a significant diversity between regions" during late Valdivia (ca. 2100-1450 B.C.E. [200lb:241]). Such diversity was similarly present in earlier periods. A com­parative analysis of domestic and public architec­ture and of settlement plans supports Guffroy's characterization of the Formative as marked by "notable differences that suggest the existence of subtly distinctive sociohistorical developments" (2004:99; my translation). 
The Formative period in the equatorial Andes appears as a mosaic of adaptations and cultural tra­ditions. In an analytical sense, the Formative period should be considered a period of "regional devel­opment," and not only the centuries between 500 
B.C.E. and 500 C.E. as Meggers (1966) originally proposed. Rather than conceptualizing these pat­terns as post-Formative diversification, recent data regarding domestic architecture, public architec­ture, and settlement plans from El Porvenir, Santa Rosa, and Ufia de Gato highlight the temporal depth of prehispanic cultural variations in the equatorial Andes. 
Recent archaeological data from Formative sites in Tumbes and adjacent regions of southern Ecuador suggest a complex diversity of coeval cul­tural traditions, perhaps correlated with distinctive 
environmental zones and/or different ethnic groups, whose populations interacted but maintained dis­tinctive sets of cultural practices. Why this pattern of Formative diversity should exist is uncertain, but the first step toward explaining variation is the recognition that it exists. While the developmental pattern associated with the Valdivia is of undis­puted significance for understanding the evolution of Formative societies, it was not the only pattern, nor does it appear to be directly analogous to other, diverse and coeval patterns. Rather, recent investi­gations elsewhere in southern Ecuador and far northern Peru provide alternative perspectives on the evolution of Formative societies of which Val­divia is a significant, but no longer the only, van­tage point.
