The stable carbon and nitrogen isotope values (o13C, o15N) of collagen and the carbon isotope value of structural carbon­ate in bioapatite were measured in the bones and teeth of Early Classic to Historic period Maya buried at Chau Hi ix, Belize. Diet at Chau Hi ix comprised a mixture of resources but contained an unusual amount of protein from high trophic levels. There were no differences between the diets of males and females, and there were no consistent changes in dietfrom birth to age 12. However, children consumed more maize than adults during all time periods. Similarities in general diet and tem­poral changes at Chau Hiix, Lamanai. and A/tun Ha suggest their participation in a regional socioeconomic system. The diets of the highest-status Early Classic individuals at Chau Hi ix, Lamanai, and A/tun Ha were different from one another and from those of other individuals buried at their respective sites. We suggest that elites created or attempted to create hierarchies of food consumption within sites during the Classic period and that a heterarchy existed among elitesfrom dif ferent sites. During the Postclassic period the major protein component of the Chau Hi ix diet shifted from terrestrial ani­mal and/or freshwater resources to reef resources, which suggests increased associations with coastal sites. Temporal changes in diet at Chau Hiix closely paralleled changes at Lamanai, but diets at the two sites were distinct during all time periods. 
Los valores de is6topos estables de carbono y nitr6geno (o13C, o15N) de colageno y el valor de is6topo de carbono de/ car­bonato estructural en bioapatita fueron medidos en los hue sos y dientes de mayas enterrados de los perfodos Cldsico Tem­prano a hist6rico en Chau Hiix, Belize. La dieta en Chau Hiix comprendfa una mezcla de recursos, pero contenfa una in usual cantidad de protefna de altos niveles tr6ficos. No hubo diferencias entre las dietas de hombres y mujeres y no hubo cambios consistentes en la dieta desde el nacimiento hasta los 12 afios de edad. Sin embargo, los nifios consumieron mas mafz que Los adultos durante todos los per{odos. Semejanzas en la dieta general y cambios temporales en Chau Hiix, Lamanai y Altun Ha sugieren su participaci6n en un sistema socioecon6mico regional. Las dietas de Los individuos de/ status mas alto de Cldsico Temprano de Chau Hiix, Lamanai y A/tun Ha fueron diferentes la una de la otra y con respecto a otros individuos enterrados en sus sitios respectivos. Sugerimos que las elites crearon o intentaron crear jerarqu{as de consumo de alimentos dentro de Los sitios durante el per{odo Cldsico, y que una heterarqu{a existi6 entre las elites de diferentes sitios. Durante el per{odo Poscldsico, el mayor componente de protefna de la dieta en Chau Hiix cambi6 de animal terrestre ylo recursos de agua dulce a recursos de arrecife, lo que sugiere crecientes asociaciones con sitios costeros. Los cambios temporales en la dieta de Chau Hiix muestran un paralelismo cercano con los cambios en Lamanai, pero las dietas en los dos sitiosfueron distintas durante 
todos los per{odos.  
Studies of ancient Maya diet have shown that there was considerable variation in the foods consumed at different sites, especially by  1999). However, little is known about dietary vari­ations within regions, among secondary sites, or between secondary sites and larger centers, which  
time period, social status, age, and sex (White  have tended to be the main focus of research.

Reconstructing these relationships is important for understanding social and economic behavior at regional levels. 
In this study we reconstruct diet at Chau Hiix, a relatively small site located between the larger sites of Lamanai and Altun Ha (Figure 1), where diet has previously been analyzed (Coyston 1995; Coyston et al. 1999; White 1986; White and Schwarcz 1989; White et al. 2001a). We use stable isotope abundances of carbon and nitrogen in col­lagen (col) and structural carbonate (sc) in bioap­atite to (1) reconstruct temporal change at Chau Hiix, (2) characterize social organization by exam­ining intrasite variation (age, sex, socioeconomic status), (3) reconstruct the life histories of individ­uals by investigating intraindividual dietary shifts, and ( 4) compare diet at Chau Hiix to diet at neigh­boring sites. Further, we evaluate two models (hier­archies and heterarchies of values) for explaining local and regional order and variability in food con­sumption. 
Theoretical Background 
Hierarchy and Heterarchy 
A hierarchy is an organizational system in which elements are ranked, with some elements subordi­nate to others. A heterarchy is an organizational sys­tem in which elements are unranked but different

from one another or in which the elements can be ranked in different ways (Crumley 1995). Because order itself is often conflated with hierarchy (Crum­ley 1995), it can be difficult to imagine how heter­archical systems can be ordered and how ranking can be present yet nonhierarchical. Examples include circular ranking (e.g., the children's game "rock-paper-scissors") and ranking contingent on circumstance (e.g., a prime minister who runs a country but whose vote is equal to that of any other citizen during an election). 
The advantage of heterarchy over hierarchy as atheoretical framework is that heterarchy does not constrain the forms of order that may be identified and avoids the assumptions (implicit in hierarchy) that ranking is always present, permanent, and con­sistent (Brumfiel 1995). The concept of heterarchy has recently been applied to socioeconomic and political aspects of ancient Maya society (Scar­borough et al. 2003) but has never been applied to systems of food consumption. We investigate hier­archies and heterarchies of food consumption in northern Belize by comparing the diets of highly elite individuals at Chau Hiix, Lamanai, and Al tun Ha; by comparing the diets of equivalent social groups (i.e., people buried in the central areas of the sites) during different time periods; and by investigating changes in diet at multiple sites over time. In this study, hierarchy is used to describe sit­uations in which foods are ranked the same way among groups (sites, time periods, status groups), and heterarchy is used to describe situations in which foods are ranked differently among groups. We assume that foods are assigned values, and val­ues determine the consumption tendencies of groups, as long as a variety of foods are available from which to choose. Values can differ among groups and over time (as in heterarchies), or they can remain the same (as in hierarchies). It should be stressed that this framework is a model intended to identify important features of one system (food consumption), not to describe the full social com­plexity of ancient Maya society. 
According to our definition, the hierarchy model assumes that the same foods were highly valued at all sites in the region. A regional hierarchy of food values implies that ( 1) higher-status individuals consumed more highly valued foods than lower­status individuals and (2) individuals of similar sta­tus at different sites had similar diets. In contrast, the heterarchy model assumes that foods were val­ued differently at different sites. A regional heter­archy of food values implies that individuals of similar status had different diets at different sites. 
Stable Isotopes 
Isotopic compositions are calculated using the mea­sured ratio of heavy to light isotopes in a sample relative to the ratio of heavy to light isotopes in a universally accepted standard reference material. This is expressed as a delta (o) value in per mil (%0) and reported relative to Vienna Peedee belemnite (VPD B) for carbon (Coplen 1994) and atmospheric nitrogen (AIR) for nitrogen (Mariotti 1983). For a review of the use of stable carbon and nitrogen iso­topes for diet reconstruction, see Ambrose 1993. Figure 2 illustrates the isotopic compositions of foods specific to the Maya area (Keegan and DeNiro 1988; Schwarcz et al. 1985; Tieszen and Fagre 1993a; van der Merwe et al. 2000; White and Schwarcz 1989; Williams 2000; Wright 1994 ), and Table 1 shows how changes in the stable isotope values of bones and teeth can be interpreted. Briefly, carbon isotope values reflect the relative propor­tions of C3 plants (most food plants) and C4 plants (maize) in the diet of a consumer or in the diet of organisms consumed. As long as protein levels are sufficient, the o13C value of collagen (o13Cc0) is pri­

marily derived from dietary protein, and the o13C value of structural carbonate in bioapatite (o13Csc) is derived from the whole diet, that is, proteins, car­bohydrates, and lipids combined (Ambrose and Norr 1993; Tieszen and Fagre 1993b). The differ­ence between the o13C values of bioapatite struc­tural carbonate and collagen (Ll 13C,c _col) is commonly used to infer trophic level or position in the food chain. Lower Ll 13Csc _col values are asso­ciated with higher trophic levels, that is, about 3-4%0 for carnivores, 5%o for omnivores, and 7%o for herbivores (Krueger and Sullivan 1984; Lee­Thorp et al. 1989). However, low Ll13Csc -col values can also result from diets in which protein is enriched in 13C and/or carbohydrates and lipids are depleted of 13C, regardless of trophic level (Tieszen and Fagre l 993b ). 
The difference between o13C values of collagen and consumed food (o13Ccol -ctiet) is often assumed to be a constant 5%o (van der Merwe and Vogel 1978). However, controlled feeding studies and field studies have shown that o13Ccol-ctiet values can

The stable carbon and nitrogen isotope compositions of types of food that may have been available to the ancient Maya at Chau Hiix (boxes), and the inferred composition of the protein component of Chau Hiix diet (individual data points). Boxes represent maximum and minimum values obtained using modern and ancient floral and faunal samples (Keegan and DeNiro 1988; Schwarcz et al. 1985; Tieszen and Fagre 1993a; van der Merwe et al. 2000; White and Schwarcz 1989; Williams 2000; Wright 1994). Where necessary, values have been corrected to account for the approxi­mately 1.530 depletion of 13C caused by modern industrial pollutants and the difference between collagen and meat val· ues (3.730) (Keegan and DeNiro 1988). Data points represent the protein component of the diets of Chau Hiix individuals, and were calculated from bone a-values values as follows: 813Cdiet = 813Ccoi -5; 815Ndiet =il15Ncol -3.

Site and Sample Description 
Chau Hiix is a relatively small site situated on a seasonal lagoon and linked by rivers to both the Caribbean Sea and the Peten region. It is located between the two larger sites of Lamanai and Al tun Ha (Figure 1 ), which are less than 40 km apart (Pyburn 2003). Today Lamanai can be reached by river from Chau Hi ix during the wet season and by river and a 2-km portage during the dry season (Pyburn 2003). 
There are approximately 12 km2 of well­drained, prime agricultural land in the immediate vicinity of Chau Hiix, which is thought to have been more than enough to supply maize to the local pop­ulation (Pyburn 2003). In addition, the site contains hydrological modifications that were built to increase agricultural production and facilitate river travel. These modifications may have fallen into disrepair during the Terminal Classic period, despite continued occupation of the site (Pyburn 2003). A diversity of terrestrial and freshwater aquatic resources was undoubtedly available to the ancient inhabitants of Chau Hiix. Today there are abundant birds, fish, and turtles in the area, and excavations have also produced freshwater clam, snail, and turtle shells, and fish, agouti, and pec­cary bones. However, detailed fauna! analyses have not been conducted. Macrobotanical remains from a group of structures north of the site center include maize and squash, as well as various fruits, seeds, roots, and fungi (Cuddy 2000). Thus it appears that a broad spectrum of foods was available to the ancient occupants of the site. 
Chau Hiix was founded during the Early Pre­classic period (1100--900 B.C.), but construction of the largest structures and the lagoon field sys­tem appears to have occurred during the Late Pre­classic (400 B.C.-A.D. 250) and Early Classic 
(A.D. 250--550) periods (Andres and Pyburn 2004; Pyburn 2003). Long-distance trade during the Clas­sic period is suggested by the many nonlocal items found at the site, including hematite, jade, saltwa­ter pearls, Spondylus shells, obsidian, a bone hair­pin mentioning a site in the Petexbatun area of Guatemala, and a stuccoed cylinder tripod from Teotihuacan (Andres and Pyburn 2004 ). Chau Hiix was abandoned sometime between the Terminal Classic period (A.D. 800--1 000) and the Historic period (post-AD. 1525), but the timing is contro­versial (Andres and Pyburn 2004; Jordan and Wro­bel 2002; Pyburn 2003). Postclassic and Historic period burials demonstrate that cultural activities continued into the Historic period, but whether the site was occupied continuously, occupied inter­mittently, or used by pilgrims for ritual purposes is unclear. 
Structure 1, the principal civic-ceremonial struc­ture, was first built in the Late Preclassic period, but additional construction and modification con­tinued during the Classic period (Andres and Pyburn 2004; Andres and Wrobel 2000). Remains from an elaborate Early Classic tomb (Burials 36 and 57 and an individual from a bundle) were selected for isotopic analysis. The tomb was vaulted and plastered and contained nonlocal high-status grave goods such as jade artifacts, freshwater pearls, and carved human bone (Wrobel et al. 1997). Burial 36 was the principal occupant, and Burial 57 and the bundle were added to the tomb sometime after the principal occupant was interred. Carved bone fan handles found with all three buri­als suggest shared mortuary rituals (Wrobel et al. 1997). The bundle burial contained numerous indi­viduals but only one set of teeth. Since it was unknown which bones and teeth belonged to the same individual, only the teeth are analyzed here. During the Postclassic period, modifications to the facade of Structure 1 and ceramic evidence sug­gest that the building became a focus for ceremo­nial activity. A Postclassic individual (Burial 45) was found inside a large, flanged pedestal-based jar likely manufactured at Lamanai (e.g., Pendergast 1981 :47, Figure 20). The jar was placed in the rub­ble overlying Structure I, halfway up its western facade (Andres and Pyburn 2004). 
Structure 2 was located next to Structure 1 on the main plaza at Chau Hiix and likely functioned as a residence (Andres and Pyburn 2004 ). The structure contained at least 70 burials dating from the Late Classic to Historic periods. Many of the earlier burials (Late Classic period) were found under preserved floors, indicating interment while

the structure was certainly inhabited. Later burials 
dating to the Terminal Classic and Postclassic peri­
ods were found in eroding construction fill above 
the preserved floors, making their association with 
the building's use more tentative. While many are 
certainly intrusive, we cannot tell whether the floor 
above them was recapped, which would suggest 
that the building was still in active use, or whether 
the burials were placed there when the building 
was no longer being maintained, as seems to be the 
case at the time of the Late Postclassic/Historic 
period burials (Andres and Pyburn 2004; Wrobel 
and Pyburn 2001). 
The ambiguous nature of the Terminal Classic 
and Postclassic burials makes status distinctions 
somewhat difficult to assess. Certainly, Structure 2 
underwent a transformation in the Terminal Clas­
sic period, during which time its associated mor­
tuary program was far less restrictive, including 
more people and a generally wider age distribution 
(Wrobel and Pyburn 2001). Several of the Termi­
nal Classic individuals were buried with well-used 
farming tools, and most were buried with nothing 
at all (Andres and Wrobel 2000). For these reasons, 
it is possible that they were not of particularly high 
status, despite their prominent burial location. 
Instead, they may represent a smallholder house­
hold, common at the rest of the site (Pyburn 2008). 
However, not all the Terminal Classic burials in 
Structure 2 were so poorly furnished, and many 
included items such as one or more complete 
ceramic vessels, obsidian blades, and in one case 
a broken drum. In addition, modifications to the site 
core and growing evidence for long-distance trade 
during the Terminal Classic imply a dynamic econ­
omy, which is indirect evidence of the presence of 
elites. By the Early Postclassic period, Structure 2 
burials were again fewer (i.e., more restrictive) and 
were stylistically similar to the elaborate Buk buri­
als common at Lamanai and Marco Gonzalez. The 
burials are also relatively contemporaneous with 
evidence for renewed ceremonial activity on the 
central plaza, including the partial refurbishments 
to the decaying Classic period architecture, the con­
struction of a shrine (Structure 9), and the place­ment of several large caches (Pyburn 2008). Andres and Pyburn (2004:408) have pointed out that the use of the central plaza fluctuated greatly over time after the Late Classic, again often making status dis­tinctions difficult to assess. 

Thirty individuals were selected for isotopic analysis based on the preservation of both bones and teeth (Ml, M2, and M3, when available) and on burial location (Structure 2 or special contexts; Table 2). Five time periods are represented, rang­ing from the Early Classic (AD. 250-550) to the Protohistoric/Historic period (AD. 1400-1675). There is some ambiguity in the assignment of cal­endar dates (e.g., the burials referred to as Termi­nal Classic may actually belong to a Terminal Classic-Early Postclassic transitional phase), but the relative chronology is secure. The burials des­ignated Postclassic are stratigraphically later than the Terminal Classic burials and contain ceramics associated with the Buk phase at Lamanai, which at that site is equated with the Early Postclassic period (Graham 1987, 2004). Like the Buk-phase burials at Lamanai, the Postclassic Chau Hiix indi­viduals were buried in a facedown position with their legs flexed backward, further suggesting that they are contemporaneous with Lamanai. There is no evidence that any of the buried individuals dis­cussed in this article were victims of sacrifice. 

Ages of juveniles were estimated using Ube­laker's (1978) tooth eruption standards. Adults were classified as young, middle, or old based on pelvic indicators, cranial sutures, and dental wear (Buik­stra and Ubelaker 1997). Sex was assigned based on standard nonmetric morphological traits of the cranium and pelvis (Buikstra and Ubelaker 1997) and discriminant function analysis of long bone robusticity measurements (Wrobel et al. 2002). 
Methods 
Collagen 
Bone collagen was prepared using a variation of the procedure described by Longin (1971). The bone was mechanically cleaned, ground, and passed through a I -mm sieve. Lipids were extracted using a 20: 10:8 methanol:chloroform:water solu­tion. Inorganic fractions of the bone were dissolved with .25 M HCl at room temperature; the acid was changed every hour until the chunks became soft. Extraneous organic matter was removed using . I M NaOH for 24 hours at room temperature. Col­lagen was solubilized with .001 M HCl at 90°C and dried at 60°C. Carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios 
were obtained using a Costech elemental combus-

ti on system (ECS 4010) coupled to a Ther­moFinnigan Delta Plus XL stable isotope ratio mass spectrometer operated in continuous flow mode. All samples were analyzed in duplicate. The o13C val­ues were calibrated relative to VPDB using ANU­Sucrose and NBS-22. The o15N values were calibrated relative to AIR using IAEA N-1 and N­
2. Based on the known o value of an internal nicoti­namide standard, accuracy of the measurements was ±.l %0foro13Ccol and ±.2%o for o 15N. Precision was better than ±.l %0 for both o13Ccol and o 15N val­ues, based on replicate analyses of samples and standards. 
The ratio of carbon to nitrogen (C/N) in each sample was determined using a Fisons Instruments EAl 108 elemental analyzer. Accuracy of the C/N ratios (based on the known value of a nicotinarnide standard) was better than ±.1, and precision (based on duplicate analyses of samples) was better than ±.02. 
Bioapatite 
Samples were treated according to the methods described by Koch et al. ( 1997) and Garvie-Lok et al. (2004). Enamel and bone were ground to a fine powder and sieved to iess than 180 µm. To remove organic matter, samples were treated with .04 ml of2 percent reagent-grade bleach per milligram of sample at room temperature (24 hours for enamel, 72 hours for bone) and rinsed five times with deion­ized water. To remove adsorbed and secondary car­bonates, samples were treated with .04 ml of .1 M acetic acid per milligram of sample for four hours at room temperature and rinsed five times with deionized water. The samples were then frozen and freeze-dried. Carbon isotope ratios were obtained using a Micromass MultiPrep device coupled to a VG Optima dual-inlet stable isotope ratio mass spectrometer. Carbon dioxide gas was produced by reaction with orthophosphoric acid at 90°C for 25 minutes. The o13C values were calibrated rela­tive to VPDB using NBS-19 and Suprapur. Accu­racy (based on the known value of NBS-18) and precision (based on duplicate analyses of samples) were better than ±.1 %0. 
The amount of structural carbonate (weight per­cent carbonate) in the samples was determined using a calibration curve based on the amount of C02 evolved from calcite standards of known weight. Based on duplicate analyses of individual samples, the results were reproducible to ±.7 per­cent. 
Crystallinity indexes (Cl values) are commonly used as a measure of postmortem bioapatite recrys­tallization. CI values were obtained using a Bruker Vector 22 Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrome­ter, according to the method described by Weiner and Bar-Yosef (1990). To control for the effects of grain size, untreated bone and enamel samples were sieved to 45-63 µm prior to analysis (Surovell and Stiner 2001 ). CI values were obtained prior to any chemical pretreatment of the bone and enamel. 
Results 
Diagenesis 
Collagen. The o values of archaeological bones with collagen contents of less than I percent have been shown to be unreliable measures of primary composition (Ambrose I 993; van Klinken I999; White 1991; White et al. 1993). Such samples were therefore excluded from isotope analysis. The col­lagen yields of usable samples range from I. I to 
12.2 percent (Table 2), with a mean yield of 4.3 ± 
2.3 percent, and are comparable to those obtained from other Belizean sites (White and Schwarcz 1989; White et al. 1993; White et al. 200la; Williams 2000). There is no significant correlation between collagen yield and o13Ccol (Pearson's r = .19; df = 27) or o15N (Pearson's r = -.01; df= 27) values at Chau Hiix, which also suggests that the 
o values were not systematically altered during dia­genesis. 
C/N ratios outside the range of 2.9 to 3.7 also generally indicate alteration of collagen (DeNiro 1985). The C/N ratios for all Chau Hiix samples are within the acceptable range (mean= 3.4 ± .03; range = 3.3 to 3.5; Table 2). In addition, there are no statistically significant correlations between C/N and o13CcoI values (Pearson's r=-.01; df = 27) or between C/N and o15N values (Pearson's r = .18; df= 27). 
Bone Bioapatite. After bleach and acid pre­treatment, bone bioapatite should contain 3.0 to 
6.5 percent carbonate if most of the structural car­bonate is retained and most of the diagenetic and adsorbed carbonate has been removed (Ambrose 1993). Within error, all the Chau Hiix values fall within this range (Table 2). There is no statistical

correlation between the amount of carbonate in bone and o13C,c values (Pearson's r =-.10; df = 27), suggesting that systematic postmortem alter­ation has not occurred. CI values for Chau Hiix bone samples (mean = 3.0 ± .3; range= 2.7 to 4.1; Table 2) are in general agreement with bone CI val­ues obtained by other researchers prior to acid treat­ment (Garvie-Lok et al. 2004; Nielsen-Marsh and Hedges 2000; Wright and Schwarcz 1996), which suggests that significant recrystallization or selec­tive dissolution of small crystals has not occurred. Further, there is no significant correlation between bone CI and o1 3C,c values (Pearson's r = .01; df = 27). One sample (Burial 84; Table 2) has an abnor­mally high CI value ( 4.1 ), a carbonate content at the low end of the range (3.1 percent), and a o1 3Csc value about 2%o more positive than the other sam­ple in its time period. Its infrared spectrum also indi­cated the presence of calcite and fluorapatite prior to bleach and acid treatment. This sample has been excluded from further consideration. 
Enamel Bioapatite. There is no generally accepted range for the structural carbonate content of enamel bioapatite after bleach and acid pre­treatment. The carbonate content of Chau Hiix enamel samples is 3.5 ± .4 percent (range= 2.7 to 
4.6 percent), which is very close to the value obtained by Wright and Schwarcz (1998) for enamel from Kaminaljuyu (3.3 ± .5 percent). More­over, there is no significant correlation between carbonate content and o1 3C,c values (Pearson's r= .24; df = 25), which further suggests that the car­bon isotope composition of the enamel samples was not systematically altered during diagenesis. The CI values (mean= 2.6 ± .3; range = 2.2 to 3.4) are unusually low, but there is no statistically sig­nificant correlation between enamel CI and o13Csc values (Pearson's r = -.22; df = 28). 
General Diet at Chau Hiix 

The mean bone o13Csc value for the Chau Hiix sam­ple is-7.7%0 (Table 3). Assuming a o 13Csc-diet value of 10--12%0 (Ambrose and Norr 1993; DeNiro and Epstein 1978; Schwarcz 2000), the mean o13C value of the "whole" diet is -19. 7 to -17. 7%o. The mean o1 3Ccovalue for the entire sample is-1 0.8%0 
1 (Table 3). Assuming a o1 3Ccoi-ctiet value of 3 to 7%o (see above), the mean o13C value of the protein consumed is -17 .8 to -13.8%0. These values sug­gest that both protein and whole diet were derived 
from a mixture of C3 and C4 plants, C4-fed terres­trial animals, marine fish, and/or reef fish. The vari­ability in bone o 13C values (o 13C,c = -9. 7 to -5. 9%o; o13CcoI = -15.6 to -7.6%0; Table 2) indicates that the relative proportions of C3 and C4 resources in Chau Hiix diets varied considerably among indi­viduals. The range of o13C values from collagen is twice that from structural carbonate (8.0%o vs. 3.8%0, respectively), which suggests that there was greater variability in protein than in carbohydrate or lipid consumption. There is a significant corre­lation between o1 3Ccot and o13C,c values in bone (Pearson's r = .76; df = 26; p < .0005), which sug­gests that a large proportion of the carbon in both collagen and structural carbonate in bioapatite was derived from the same source. 
The mean o15N value for the entire sample is 10.6%0, and the range is 8.4 to 12.4%0, which sug­gests considerable differences in "trophic level" among individuals. The mean o 15N value is slightly higher than collagen values typically obtained from terrestrial omnivores in the Maya region (7-1 0%0 [Gerry and Krueger 1997; White et al. 1993; White et al. 200lb; Wright 1994]), which suggests con­sumption of significant amounts of animal and/or fish protein. It is likely that the highest o15N values reflect the consumption of fish from marine or freshwater sources. There is a significant negative correlation between o13CcoI and o1 5N values (Pear­son's r=-.65; df = 26;p < .001), which shows that the individuals at the highest "trophic level" (as measured by o 15N values) were consuming CTeat­ing terrestrial animals or freshwater fish. 
The A 13Csc -col values (mean= 3.1 %0) indicate a high degree of camivory or marine/reef resource consumption, and the range of A 13C,c _col values (.1 to 6.8%0; Table 2) suggests considerable vari­ability in protein consumption. The lowest A 1 3Csc _col values are lower than expected for pure car­nivores and are therefore most likely caused by consumption of protein with high o13C values, in combination with C3 plants. There is a statisti­cally significant positive correlation between A 13C,c _cot and o15N values for the whole sample (Pearson's r = .54; df = 26; p < .005), which indi­cates that individuals with low A 13Csc _col values tended to have low o15N values as well. This sug­gests that these individuals consumed a diet high in reef fish or maize-fed animals along with some C3 plants.

Temporal Changes at Chau Hiix 

Temporal changes in diet at Chau Hiix were assessed using only individuals from Structure 2, so that status differences associated with burial locations are avoided. There are no samples from Structure 2 dating to the Early Classic period. The ranges of o13C values during the Late and Termi­nal Classic periods (-15 .6 to -8.5%0 for collagen, ­
9.7 to -6.4%0 for structural carbonate in bone, and -9.9 to -6.4%0 for structural carbonate in enamel; Table 2) indicate a mixed diet of C3 and C4 plants, terrestrial animals, and freshwater and marine/reef resources. The ranges of Li 13Csc _col values (1. 7 to 6.8%0; Table 2) and o15N values (9.0 to 12.4%0; Table 2) suggest that terrestrial animals and fish made up an important part of the diet of some indi­viduals during the Late and Terminal Classic peri­ods. 
One-way ANOVAs show statistically signifi­cant differences among time periods for o13Ccol (F[2,20] 11.7; p < .00 1), bone o13Csc (F[2,20]
= = 

4.0;p < .05), Li 13Csc-col (F[2,20] 12.8;p < .001),
= 

and o15N (F[2,20] = 6.6; p < .05). Tukey HSD and Dunnett T3 post hoc tests reveal that Terminal Clas­sic and Postclassic individuals have significantly different values for all stable isotope measures and that the Terminal Classic and historic individuals have significantly different o13Ccoi. o13CSC' and Li l3Csc _col values. Both o13CcoI and &13Csc values are higher in the Postclassic and historic period than in the Terminal Classic period (Figure 3a-b, Table 4). The shift in o1 3CcoI values is greater than

that in bone 813Csc values, which suggests that the dietary change was primarily protein related. The 815N and A13Csc _col values significantly decrease from the Terminal Classic to the Postclassic period (Figure 2, Figure 3c-d), which suggests a decrease in high-trophic-level terrestrial animal protein and an increase in reef fish consumption. The extremely low A13Csc _col values that characterize the Post­classic and Historic periods are typical of marine­or reef-based diets (Lee-Thorp et al. 1989). 
Age Differences at Chau Hiix 
A comparison of first, second, and third molar (M 1, M2, M3) enamel 813Csc values, which represent diet at ages 0--3, 3-8, and 9-12 years, respectively (Massler et al. 1941; Schour and Massler 1940), and bone 813Csc values, which reflect diet over the last 10--30 years of life (Ambrose 1993; Hillson I 996; Krueger and Sullivan 1984 ), allows the reconstruction of dietary changes within the life­times of individuals. There are no statistically sig­nificant differences among Ml, M2, or M3 813C,c values for the whole Chau Hiix sample or within time periods. This suggests that there were no con­sistent changes in the proportions of C3 to C4 plants and terrestrial to marine/reef resources in children's diets from birth to age I 2 (or in the diets of their mothers, in the case of breast-feeding infants). Nev­ertheless, enamel 813Csc values are more variable than bone 813Csc values (Tables 2, 5), which could indicate greater interindividual variability in chil­dren's diets than in adults', or marked seasonal or

annual variations in resources that are obscured in bone because of its much longer mineralization period. 

There is a statistically significant difference between bone and M l o13Csc values (Paired Stu­dent'st= 7.5; df= 25;p < .001 ), bone and M2 o13Csc values (Paired Student's t = 8.2; df = 26;p < .001), and bone and M3 o13C,c values (Paired Student's t = 5.6; df = 21; p < .001 ). Enamel o13Csc values are consistently enriched in 13C relative to bone val­ues, which suggests that children consumed more maize and/or coastal resources than adults. Using only o13C,c values it is not possible to distinguish between maize and coastal resource consumption, but given the large quantity of coastal resources consumed by many adults at Chau Hiix it is likely that the adult-child differences are a result of greater maize consumption by children. 
The higher enamel o 13Csc values relative to bone 
o uc,c values occur during all time periods at Chau 
Hiix (Table 4, Figure 3), which suggests that the importance of maize to children's diets persisted over time. The temporal changes in enamel o13Csc values follow the same direction as the changes in bone o13Cc0and o13C,c values, but the magnitude 
1 
of the Terminal Classic to Postclassic shift in enamel carbonate o13C values is larger than that of either bone collagen or bone carbonate (Figure 3a-b). The mean enamel o13Csc values from the Postclassic and Protohistoric/Historic periods are so high (-1.8 and -2.1%0, respectively) that they could only have been caused by a nearly pure diet of maize and/or coastal resources during childhood. 
Age differences in diet can also be determined by comparing the bone o13C and o15N values of juveniles, young adults, and old adults (Table 5). Because of the major shifts in diet over time, time periods are considered separately. Since sample sizes are small and only one age group is repre­sented in many time periods, statistical compar-

isons are possible only for the Terminal Classic and Postclassic periods. The only significant dif­ference in bone o values among age groups at Chau Hiix is in the o15N values of juveniles and old adults during the Terminal Classic period (F[2,I 3] 4.5;
= 
p < .05). The old adults have significantly higher 
o 15N values than the juveniles, suggesting that the former consumed more protein from high trophic levels. 
Sex Differences at Chau Hiix 
Independent-samples t-tests show that there were no significant differences between males and females for the whole sample or within any time period, which suggests that there were no wide­spread systematic differences between the diets of men and women at Chau Hiix. 
Special Context Burials at Chau Hiix 
Several individuals were buried in "special con­texts" that distinguish them from the other indi­viduals in this study. Burial 36, a middle/old adult male, was the principal occupant of the Early Clas­sic tomb in Structure 1 and a probable ruler. His o13Ccol value (-7.6%0) is the highest of any indi­vidual at the site, which suggests that the protein component of his diet was more enriched in 13C than that of any other individual. However, his bone 
o 13Csc value (-7 .5%o) is very close to the site mean, which suggests a mixed diet of C3 and C4 resources. His 13Csc-col value (.1 %0) is the lowest of any indi­vidual at the site and could only be the result of heavy consumption of marine/reef resources or C4­fed animals, in combination with C3 carbohydrates. This interpretation is supp01ted by his o15N value ( 1 1 .0%0, only slightly above the mean for the entire site). His enamel o13Csc values (-3.5%0, Ml ; -3.2%0, M2) are distinctively high relative to those of other Classic period burials, which suggests that he began consuming large aniounts of maize and/or reef resources at an early age and that his high sta­tus was ascribed rather than achieved.

Figure 4. Inter-site comparison of general diet: (a) mean 813C,c versus 813Ccol• Lines indicate expected 1\-values of terres­trial herbivores and carnivores if herbivore A13Csc-coJ = 7%o (solid line) and carnivore A13Csc-col = 3%o (dashed line); (b) mean 1\15N versus A13Csc-cot• Error bars represent la. Note that no standard deviations were available for the A13Csc-col values of the Copan and Peten regions (Coyston et al. 1999, Gerry and Krueger 1997, Powis et al. 1999, van der Merwe et al. 2000, White et al. 2001a, White & Schwarcz 1989, Williams 2000). 
The two other probable Early Classic burials in Tomb 1 (Burial 57 and the bundle burial) were sec­ondary occupants with very different diets from the ruler. Burial 57 has a much lower o13CcoI value (-13.8%0), a much higher 13Csc -col value (6.6%0), and a somewhat lower o15N value (10.3%0) than Burial 36, which indicate markedly less C4-fed ter­restrial animal meat and/or reef fish consumption. The enamel o13Csc values of Burial 57 (-7.7%0, Ml; -7.4%0, M2) are virtually identical to his or her bone o13C,c value (-7.2%0). This "lifetime uni­formity" of diet is unusual compared to the diets of other individuals, who consumed more C4 resources in childhood than in adulthood. The enamel o13Csc values of the bundle burial (-6.8%0, Ml; -6.7%0, M2; -6.2%0, M3) are much closer to those of Burial 57 than Burial 36 and are within the range of values of individuals from the following time periods (Late and Terminal Classic). Thus, Burial 57 and the bundle burial may have been of lesser status or from a later time period. 
Burial 45 was a Postclassic male buried in a large Lamanai-style vessel in construction fill on the facade of Structure l. His o 13Ccovalue is lower 
1 (-9.6%0) and his bone o13Csc and 13Csc -coI values are higher (-5.9%0 and 3.8%0, respectively) than any other Postclassic individual at Chau Hiix (Table 2). These data suggest that he consumed more maize 
and fewer C4-fed terrestrial and/or reef resources than contemporaneous individuals. His enamel o13Csc values (-2.8%0, Ml; -2.3%0, M2) are lower than the mean Postclassic enamel o13C,c values (­
2. 1%0, Ml; -1 .9%0, M2), which indicates that he consumed relatively more C3 foods even during childhood. The isotopic composition of Burial 45 is remarkably similar to that of contemporary indi­viduals from Lamanai (Table 4), the place of ori­gin of his burial container (Coyston et al. 1999; White and Schwarcz 1989). 
Burial 43 was a Terminal Classic male buried in association with a hairpin that is inscribed with a reference to a site in the Petexbatun region of Guatemala, which suggests that this individual may have been a foreigner. There were no bones avail­able for analysis, but the enamel o13Csc values of this individual (-7.1%0, Ml; -8.4%0, M2; -8.3%0, M3; Table 2) are lower than the mean o13Csc val­ues of Terminal Classic individuals from Structure 2 (-6.3%0; Table 4 ), which suggests that he con­sumed a higher-than-average proportion of C3 foods and may indeed have been a foreigner. 
Between-Site Comparison of General Diet 
Overall, general diet at Chau Hiix was more like diets at the nearby sites of Lamanai and Al tun Ha than diets at any of the other sites in Belize or the
