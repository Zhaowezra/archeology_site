RITUAL AMONG THE MASSES: DECONSTRUCTING IDENTITY AND CLASS IN AN ANCIENT MAYA NEIGHBORHOOD 
Chelsea Blackmore 
Equating a single cultural group to a classificatory scheme has implications for not only how archaeologists develop the concept of cultural identity but how we investigate and theorize about internal social dynamics within that same society. For the ancient Maya, social organization remains largely understood as a two-class system-that of commoner and elite. While these categories reflect the extreme ends of known social strata, they inadequately characterize the reality of day-to­day interactions. This has led to tacit assumptions that commoners did not participate in or comprehend the political and social complexity of the world around them. This paper examines how occupants of a Late Classic Maya neighborhood employed ritual and public practices as a means of social differentiation. Excavations at the Northeast Group, part of the ancient Maya site of Chan, Belize, identified considerable diversity between households, suggesting that occupants shaped status and identity through the control and centralization of ritual. Understanding how people distinguished themselves within the context of a neighborhood provides direct evidence of class complexity, challenging traditional models of com­moner behavior and more importantly the role they played in ancient Maya society as a whole. 
Comparar una cultura con un esquema clasificatorio tiene implicaciones no solo para la manera en que las arque6logos desa­rrollan el concepto de la identidad cultural, sino para la manera en que realizamos investigaciones y desarrollamos teor{a sabre las dinamicas culturales dentro de esa misma sociedad. Por ejemplo, la organizaci6n social de los antiguos maya sigue siendo entendida, en gran medida, coma si fuera un sistema de dos clases: la de los pobres y la de las elites. Aunque las cat­egor{as seiialadas con las palabras "pobre" y "elite" s{ reflejan los /ados extremos de las condiciones sociales, no describen 
o explican, de manera adecuada, la rutina y la realidad diaria de las seres humanos. Esta situaci6n tiene como resultado el presumir que la genie comun no lleg6 a participar en, ni comprender, la complejidad de/ mundo socio-poUtico que le rode­aba. Este estudio tiene coma prop6sito examinar la manera en que los habitantes de un barrio maya del Cl6sico Tard(o uti­/izaron el ritual y otras practicas publicas coma un media para enfatizar diferencias en el estatus social. Las excavaciones llevadas a cabo en el Grupo de! Nordeste, en la antigua ciudad maya conocida como Chan, en Belice, tuvieron como resul­tado la identificaci6n de un alto nivel de diversidad entre los hogares. Esto indica que Los ocupantes formaron su identidad y estatus social a traves del control y la centralizaci6n de! ritual. Entender la manera en que grupos culturales se distinguen desde el contexto y perspectiva de una investigaci6n de un barrio proporciona una evidencia directa de la complejidad de clase social, desafiando los modelos tradicionales utilizados por antrop6logos y arque6logos para explicar la vida y las prac­ticas de la genie comun. Aun mas importante es la manera en que ta! estudio reconsidera el papel que desempeiiaron Los comuneros en la sociedad de las antiguos mayas.

daily life. Additionally, it challenges preconceived models of ancient Maya social organization and its relationship to ritual practice. Understanding how people distinguished themselves within the context of a neighborhood provides a model for investi­gating ancient Maya society as a whole, but more importantly highlighting the nuances that under­write the social, political, and economic practices that foreground archaeological research. 
Class and Ritual Identities 

Elaborate art and iconography have long provided 
testament to the importance of ritual in elite ancient 
Maya identity-formation and politics among the 
Classic Maya. Access to prestige materials and 
monumental spaces provided elites with a physi­
cal and visible backdrop that enhanced their social 
power and prestige, particularly in accordance to 
ritual and public acts. The variability of these mate­
rial markers are seen as a reflection of their diver­
sity and their investment in the control and 
appropriation of political, social, and economic 
power. As public ceremonies, ritual, and perfor­
mance "make and transform social relations," they 
are critical components of ancient political struc­
tures (lnomata and Cohen 2006:33). 
Yet when referencing commoner ritual, archae­

ological discussions characterize it in terms of 
social solidarity and community cohesion. While 
these needs were no doubt met, assuming these 
were the only function ignores the sociopolitical 
and economic realities of ritual practice. Moreover, 
it reflects a binary model of class organization in 
which the elite controlled the economic, religious, 
and political sectors of society while commoners 
provided labor and supplies. Although there is 
extensive evidence that ancient Maya social orga­_ nization, particularly class and status hierarchies, 
(
were complex, our perceptions continue to be shaped by "comparisons with elites, in terms of material well-being and behaviors undertaken in broader social contexts" (Lohse and Valdez 2004:2). The binary relationship between com­moner and elite emerges from a contractual point of view, which often naturalizes inequality with­out considering the process of conflict and col­laboration that underwrite state-level societies. This is problematic for two reasons: first, it assumes that elites were societal prime-movers, and second, that there was a reciprocal if not har­monious relationship between them and com­moners. This has resulted in a "top-down" emphasis whereby models of social organization are quite detailed for the upper echelons but lack­ing for the rest. More importantly, such viewpoints tend to reduce the importance that social inequal­ities and differences in status would have had in shaping social interactions, particularly those within commoner populations. 
If elite identities are materially and symboli­cally linked to political and ritual economies, how are commoner identities defined in comparison? Traditionally, evidence of class identity is equated with status and wealth and the archaeological remains used to identify them. Wealth, defined as items used in "display, ritual, and exchange," con­solidate and reinforce social identities by estab­lishing group membership (LeCount 1999:240). What a person wears or the type of house one builds will establish a group affiliation that is a visual cue to all in the community or neighborhood (Schort­man 1989). Elite social identity is reflected archae­ologically by architectural elaboration, monumental construction, access to prestige or lux­ury items, presence of hieroglyphic texts, icono­graphic imagery, residence within or near major cultural centers, and elaborate mortuary treatments (e.g., Chase and Chase 1992; Inomata and Hous­ton 2001). The presence or absence of these mate­rials acts as an indicator of the social level and statuses of the individuals being studied. Although these are appropriate for distinguishing between broad categories of elite and commoner, they do not accurately reflect the potential for diversity within each category (McGuire 1983). 
Because of their class status, commoners were unable to amass wealth, prestige goods, and labor power in the same way that elites could. What items they do have tend to be found in less quantity and more variable quality than those in elite contexts. The paucity or absence of elite materials is further exacerbated by the presence of domestic and util­itarian goods. With less access to prestige goods and a large labor force, social and political activ­ity, including ritual practice, was virtually indis­tinguishable from the materials and spaces used in everyday life. As a result, the majority of com­moner studies focus on issues of production and consumption, while the social and political conse-

quences of ritual are rarely explored. This is supris­ing as numerous authors argue that ritual and reli­gious practice are fundamental in negotiations of social identity, status, and political participation, regardless of one's class affiliation (Ashmore et al. 2004; Gonlin and Lohse 2007; Hendon 1991; Joyce 2004; Joyce and Weller 2007; Lucero 2003, 2006; McAnany 2002; Robin, Blackmore, and Latsch 2005; Robin, Wyatt, and Blackmore 2005; Robin et al. 2008; Yaeger 2000). 
Ignoring commoner ritual as substantially less complex or a diminutive replica of elite ritual reflects a conflation of social, religious, and eco­nomic activities with class structure. Lohse (2007) notes that such viewpoints arise from uncontextu­alized readings of the Dominant Ideology Thesis (Abercrombie et al. 1980; Marx and Engels 1968 [1845]). These assume that privileged members of society control ideological, economic and social production, thereby naturalizing hierarchy and sub­ordinating the lower classes (Lohse 2007; Turner 1967, 1969; see also Abercrombie et al. 1980). In referencing ritual and bodily performance, Inomata and Coben (2006:24) argue that ambiguity of mean­ing are critical aspects of these practices, as they not only maintain collective identities but also cre­ate potential for transforming, subverting and resist­ing them (see also Kertzer 1988; Turner 1967, 1969). Commoners are hardly "inert supplicants" as they resist state modifications as they also actively construct positions of power and legiti­macy within their own communities. 
Ritual is not simply a set of beliefs but rather actions and practices that reflect both a wide array of participants and a multitude of potential inter­pretations. Rites are themselves symbolic, laden with meaning and connotation that is malleable and as such must be considered as a socially and contextually defined practice. For the purpose of this paper, I define ritual in terms of Bell's (1997:81-82) analysis of ritualization: 
The focus is less a matter of clear and autonomous rites than the methods, traditions, and strategies of 'ritualization' ... the most sub­tle a
d central quality of those actions ... is the primacy of the body moving about within a specially constructed space simultaneously defining (imposing) and experiencing (receiv­ing) the values ordering the environment. 

By viewing ritual through practice theory, Bell ( 1997) argues for an approach that focuses on peo­ple, their actions, and experiences. A focus on rit­ualization, in particular, moves analysis away from assumptions of a priori action to one that consid­ers the particular contexts in which rituals are per­formed and how they reaffirm and/or challenge social norms (Bradley 1998, 2003; DeMarrais et al. 1996; Fogelin 2007; Inomata 2006; Joyce 2001 b; Moore and Myerhoff 1977). The politics of ritual are not simply ways to sustain the status quo,; but are the foundations for establishing and defin-· ing what the status quo is (Kertzer 1988; Lohse 2007). The point here is that an examination of rit­ual can be used to emphasize the multidimensional nature of social practices from the poorest of farm­ers to the richest of kings. 
Chan and the Northeast Group 

The Chan archaeological site is located in the Upper Belize Valley, an area of limestone hills and slopes situated between the Mopan and Macal rivers. The Belize Valley's proximity to the urban center of Naranjo places it within the sphere of Peten poli­tics (Ashmore and Leventhal 1993; Ball and Taschek 1991; Martin and Grube 2000). As the paramount center, Naranjo was the primary eco­nomic and political force in the region, impacting the growth and expansion of centers throughout the Belize Valley. While some flourished under 
Naranjo's protection, others such as Xunantunich came to prominence after its decline (Ashmore and Leventhal 1993; LeCount et al. 2002; Leventhal and Ashmore 2004). In a similar manner, Xunantu­nich's rise in the Late Classic (A.D. 600-900) affected to some degree the social and political landscape of surrounding communities, like that of Chan. Work conducted by the Xunantunich Set­tlement Survey project illustrated that these settle­ments, while tied to the fortunes of Xunantunich, were not completely dependent on them. While population density at Chan drops off after the fall ofXunantunich, people continued to live, work, and worship there (Docster et al. 2008). 
Located approximately 4 km southeast of this mid-sized polity-center, Chan was an ancient agrar­ian community occupied from the Middle Pre­classic to Terminal Classic periods (ca. 100/800 
B.C. toA.D. 1150/1200) (Kosakowsky 2007:Table

Work at Chan began with Cynthia Robin's (1999) disserta­tion fieldwork at the settlement cluster of Chan Noohol (see also Ashmore and Leventhal 1993; Yeager and Robin 2004). This became the basis for a multiyear project (2002-present) directed by Dr. _Cynthia Robin of Northwestern University. 
!Research included both settlement survey to delin­eate community boundaries and penetrating and areal excavations to determine the site's social het­erogeneity (Robin 2004; see also Wyatt 2004, 2008). Work at the Northeast Group complements these foci as the neighborhood falls into the mid­dle of an existing settlement hierarchy, defined by the sites of Chan Noohol and the Central Group. 
Chan Noohol, located just south of the Chan Central group, is a small neighborhood that can be described as a more "traditional" set of domestic house mounds (Figure 3). They are characterized by their small size (all under Im in height), simple single-phase stone platforms, and short occupation history, confined to the later end of the Late Clas­sic period (Robin 1999). At the other end of the Chan social and architectural spectrum is the Chan Central group (see Figure 3). It is the only identi­fied architectural group of its large size and com­plexity, with architecture ranging between 4 and 7 m in height and continuous occupation from the Late Preclassic to Terminal Classic Period. Recent excavations have identified materials associated with "eliteness" including vaulted ceilings, elabo­rate burials and caches, blank stelae, a large stone altar, and eccentric blades. 
Given that these previous excavations have focused on the smallest (Chan Noohol) and largest (Central Group) areas at Chan, work at the North-

east Group provides a window into otherwise unknown settlement strata. Occupied from the Early Classic to the Terminal Classic period, the Northeast Group is characterized by six mound groups (NE #1-6) and two isolated mounds (NE #7-8), with buildings ranging in size from .5 m to 2 min height (Figure 4, Table 1). The neighbor­hood is bounded by agricultural terraces along its 
west and northeast edges and steep hill slopes to the east. Ceramic chronology dates the apogee of the neighborhood to the Late Classic period (AD. 600-830), although two structures NE-1 and NE­6 were founded in the Early Classic (A.D. 200-600). The surface characteristics and spatial cohesion of the Northeast Group fit archaeologi­cal and ethnohistorical definitions of a neighbor­hood (Bullard 1964; Fash 1983; Hammond 1972; Pyburn-1997; Vogt 1976). Bullard (1964:281), for 
example, defines neighborhoods as a collection of households organized in a "hamlet-like cluster of 5-12 structures," while Vogt (1976) relates them to waterhole groups of modem-day Zinacantan. 
Research and analysis was carried out over five field seasons, from 2003 to 2008. Work began with survey and testing of both on and off-mound areas to define the extent of each household group and identify the distribution of artifacts, activity areas, and architecture throughout the neighborhood. Based on analysis of materials recovered from this phase, later excavations focused on three house­holds, NE-1, NE-3, and NE-6 (see Figure 4). These were selected for study to represent the range and variability of households across the neighborhood (Blackmore 2007, 2008). If social status and iden­tity were negotiated within the context of the North­east Group, we expected to find differences not only in the activities conducted in each household but in artifact distribution, composition, and densities.

albeit of poorer quality and less quantity, they are rarely considered as evidence of commoner social diversity. As the following evidence will demon­strate, ritual played a key role in the negotiation and establishment of distinct neighborhood identities. The following three sections detail the relevant architectural histories, features, and artifact inven­tories identified from excavated households. 
Architectural Analysis 
Numerous scholars consider architectural com­plexity to be a consistent indicator of wealth in agrarian states (Abrams 1994; McGuire 1983; Smith 1987). Investments of labor, volume of materials used, and the cost and quality of goods reflect the larger kin and social networks within which household residents were embedded. Car­ried out in 2005, areal and penetrating excavations focused on each group's architectural history, over­all form and function, and spatial and chronolog­ical distribution of features and artifacts. Each group is discussed in reference to the architectural phases identified through excavation and ceramic analysis.
