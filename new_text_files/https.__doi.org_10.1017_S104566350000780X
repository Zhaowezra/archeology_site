TECHNIQUES OF ANCIENT MAYA BONE WORKING: 
EVIDENCE FROM A CLASSIC MAYA DEPOSIT 

Kitty F. Emery 

An assemblage of modified bone remains from the site of Dos Pilas, Guatemala, in the southern Maya lowlands, is used to describe the raw materials, tools, techniques, and reduction strategies of Classic period Maya bone working. Most Maya bone artifact assemblages are not closely associated with production locales, are sparsely distributed across sites (rarely more than a few per household), and include primarily finished artifacts. In contrast, this large collection includes high fre­quencies of debitage from all stages of artifact production in a single spatially and temporally discrete locus-a residen­tial group close to the main plaza of the site and occupied both before and after political disintegration of the Petexbatun hegemony. Comparative Petexbatun materials are used to suggest that although the Dos Pi las assemblage is unusually dense, the methods used by the bone crafters in this complex were similar to those used in all other periods and locations in the region and likely in the southern Maya lowlands as a whole. The Dos Pi/as assemblage presents therefore an excellent model for Classic Maya bone-working. 
Analizamos una muestra de restos 6seos modificados def sitio de Dos Pi/as, Guatemala para describir sus materias primas, herramientas utilizadas, tecnicas y estrategias de reducci6n en tiempos cldsicos mayas. La mayor{a de Los conjuntos 6seos artefactuales mayas no estdn asociadas a un Lugar de producci6n, sino mas bien estdn esparcidos en Los sitios e incluyen sobre todo artefactos terminados. A diferencia de esto, esta muestra incluye altas frecuencias de restos de todos los estados de pro­ducci6n en una ubicaci6n cronol6gicamente discreta-un grupo residencial ocupado antes y despues de la desintegraci6n poUtica de la hegemonfa def Petexbatun. Su comparaci6n con materiales de otros sitios y perfodos de Petexbatun indican que, a pesar de que la colecci6n de Dos Pi/as es inusualmente densa, sus metodos fueron semejantes a aquellos de todos perfodos y sitios de la region. La muestra de Dos Pilas presenta, por esta raz6n, un mode lo excelente para el estudio de la elaboraci6n de artefactos 6seos de los mayas de/ Cldsico. 
he Maya manufactured a wide range of arti­Tfacts from faunal materials (bone, antler, tooth, and shell), both utilitarian (nee­dles/pins/awls, fishing hooks, scrapers, spatulae, musical instruments, bowls) and ceremonial or adorning (beads, pins, autosacrifical perforators ). Such artifacts, ubiquitous at ancient Maya archae­ological sites, provide a base for analyzing patterns of social, political, and economic variability. Else­where, typological analyses of worked bone economies provide standardized compendia of arti­fact types and variability, allowing the definition of cultural traits within economic traditions. Recon­structions of artifact manufacture in both the Old and New Worlds allow analysis of craft special­ization, economic complexity, and political cen­tralization (for examples see Arnold 1994; Campana 1987; Camps-Fabrer 1990, 1991; Choyke and Bartosiewicz 2001; d 'Errico et al. 1984; Gates St. Pierre and Walker 2007; MacGre­gor 1985; McComb 1989; Newcomer 1974). 
Mesoamerican archaeology has long been inter­ested in faunal artifacts, primarily of shell (Andrews 1969; Ricketson 1937; West-Scott 1980). Excellent analyses include examinations of coastal resource use and trade (McKillop and Winemiller 2004; Vokes and Vokes 1983), comparison of utilitarian with ritual-use bone and shell tools or with high­status non-utilitarian artifacts (Moholy-Nagy 1985, 2003), analyses of stylistic patterning and artistic representation (e.g., Cobos 1989; Coe 1959; Cog­gins 1992; Dreiss 1994 ), and shell working (Suarez 197 4; Suarez Diez 1986).

TECHNIQUES OF ANCIENT MAYA BONE WORKING 

studies have traditionally been descriptive, quali­tative analyses of stylistic trends in nondietary bone artifact use and distribution. We have not yet devel­oped standard typological analyses of either the manufacture and production, or the use and distri­bution of these artifacts. Few studies have discussed how ancient Maya bone tools were made, their raw materials, or the tools of their trade (for exceptions see Moholy-Nagy 2003; Wake 1999), primarily because at most Maya sites the artifacts themselves were scarce or the debitage from their creation lost through poor preservation. 
Here I present a linear reduction model of bone artifact production based on remains from the sites of the Petexbarun region of Guatemala in the south­ern Maya lowlands. This model is developed through zooarchaeological analysis of an unusual deposit of bone debitage that I interpret as a bone tool production assemblage. This assemblage was recovered from a small residential group (Group IA-3, Operation DPl) at the site of Dos Pilas (Fig­ure 1 ). High densities of animal bone included large quantities of modified debitage, the discard and waste produced during the manufacture of bone needles, pins, and other perforators. This large col­lection allows both a generalized understanding of the techniques of ancient Maya bone working and a specific view of the standardized techniques of manufacture of bone perforators during the Late and Terminal Classic. For a broader view of man­ufacturing techniques, this assemblage is compared to other, smaller Petexbatun worked assemblages. 
Methods 
I analyzed the Petexbatun zooarchaeological assemblages between 1991 and 1997 while I was project zooarchaeologist for the Petexbatun Regional Archaeology Project (Emery 1997). I used standard zooarchaeological methods to iden­tify taxa, skeletal element, side, age, sex, and other characters. Identifications used comparative mate­rials from the Royal Ontario Museum as well as comparative specimens collected and housed in Guatemala for the duration of the project. Speci­mens are quantified as NISP (Number ofldentified Specimens), and classified as "identified" when we could designate taxonomic class or better. MNI (Minimum Number oflndividuals) was not calcu­lated because most of the artifact remains were not identifiable to element, and many not below the level of class or family. 
The Dos Pilas bone tool production assemblage, the focus of this study, consists primarily of deb­itage and broken fragments discarded during arti­fact production. The uniform and efficient process of that production allowed the description of the manufacturing stages on a general level and in a modeled taxonomy of production stages. Follow­ing the strategies of many lithic analysts (Fowler 1991; Hayden 1979; Hester and Hammond 1979; Semenov 1985; Sheets 197 5), I present this tool production model in terms of a reduction hierar­chy. My descriptive taxonomy of artifactual alter­ations combines information on the type of modification, its location on the skeletal element, and the modification activity that would have pro­duced each alteration. I then combined this alter­ation taxonomy with species taxonomy, building a model of the sequence of activities involved in the reduction of each bony element of each species into the several artifact varieties-a linear reduc­tion hierarchy. Other details are presented else­where (Emery 200 1, 2006). 
The Study Locus 
Between 1989 and 1996, the Petexbatun region, in the Pasion river drainage of the southern Maya low­lands in the Peten of Guatemala, was the focus of multidisciplinary field research aimed at under­standing the political collapse and eventual aban­donment of the region around A.D. 800 (Demarest 1997). Excavations by the Proyecto Arqueol6gico Regional Petexbatun (PARP) were directed by Demarest of Vanderbilt University, and codirected first by Stephen Houston (now at Brown Univer­sity) and later by Juan Antonio Valdes (Universi­dad de San Carlos). The Dos Pilas excavations were directed as part of Joel Palka's dissertation research (Palka 1995, 1997). 
The Petexbatun sites, occupied from the Pre­classic to the Postclassic periods (900 B.C.-A.D. 1500), were most densely settled during the Late Classic (A.D. 600-800) under the joint control of the ruling elite of Dos Pilas and Aguateca (Foias and Bishop 1997). The region's core includes five main sites (Dos Pilas, Aguateca, Arroyo de Piedra, Tamarindito, and Punta de Chimino) as well as var­ious smaller communities (Escobedo 1997; Ino-

mata 1995, 1997; O'Mansky et al. 1996; Palka 1995, 1997; Valdes 1997; Van Tuerenhout 1996). Dos Pilas was the largest and most politically dom­inant site during all but the earliest periods of occu­pation (Demarest 1996, 1997; Foias 1998). About 
A.D. 760, however, the last ruler of Dos Pilas was defeated and exiled, ending the Dos Pilas hege­mony (Houston 1987, 1993; Houston and Math­ews 1985; Mathews and Willey 1991). Elaborate defensive systems appear at many of the sites at this time. At Dos Pilas, palisaded defensive walls con­structed around the two ritual centers, the main plaza and the Duende complex, used construction material from elite palaces and ritual structures, indicating that the site's elite had already aban­doned it (Demarest et al. 1997). A small popula­tion remained resident near and often within these defensive walls (Palka and Foias 1991). 
This study is based on the bone artifact materi­als we recovered while excavating one of these small post-collapse households, the L4-3 residen­tial group, just north of the main plaza and defen­sive walls at Dos Pilas (Figure 2) (Emery 1992, l 995a, 1996, 1997; Foias and Brandon 1992; Foias and Robles 1989; Johnston et al. 1989; Palka 1995; Wright 1990). This group, which continued through the political turmoil into the Terminal Classic until approximately A.D. 830, comprises six principal structures that enclose the east (L4-49 and L4-50), north (L4-84 and L4-85), and west (L4-51 and L4­52) sides of a rectangular plaza. To the east of the L4-3 plaza lie two low platforms (L4-7 1, L4-72) and a fifth structure (L4-48) that together form an auxiliary eastern plaza. Excavation suggests that the group was originally constructed and occupied dur­ing the Late Classic period, but that during the Ter­minal Classic architectural additions to the eastern side of the group were accompanied by the pro­duction of bone and possibly lithic artifacts in great numbers. Artifacts (including modified and unmod­ified human and animal bone) were found scat­tered across the entire group, but were concentrated around the eastern section, where excavations also recovered several burials including at least 11 decapitated crania. The intriguing details of the combined analysis of ceramic and lithic artifacts, human and animal osteology, and culture history of this residential unit aie in preparation for publi­cation elsewhere (Emery et al. 2008). 
While total (modified and unmodified) bone 
density was highest behind the eastern and north­ern structures and in the two eastern plazas, most of the modified bone was found in a dense midden behind Structure L4-49 and in the east plaza com­pound slightly to the north. This midden contained large numbers of ceramics (mainly polychrome) and lithics along with animal remains and isolated human cranial fragments. The high proportions of modified bone and lithics, the polychrome pottery, the human remains, and the lack of charring of any remains suggest that the midden does not represent simple domestic trash. They suggest instead that these locations were the focus of bone tool manu­facturing activities by the family group resident in the complex during the Late Classic and, with a shift in spatial focus, the Terminal Classic. The midden likely represents a dump of materials from bone and other material crafting (Emery 2006). 
The Study Sample 
The faunal sample from L4-3 consists of more than 10,000 bone fragments, most from a single mid­den measuring only six square meters (Table 1). This is 10 times the number of faunal remains found during all other excavations at Dos Pilas, repre­senting an average density of 425 bones per exca­vation unit, and a peak of almost 3,000 bones per unit in the midden behind Structure L4-49-a pro­portionate density unlike any other found at the Petexbatun sites. Over 40 percent of these remains are worked, whereas less than 10 percent of the remains from other nonmortuary deposits at Dos Pilas showed alteration. The density of altered remains per deposit varies from 1.5 bones per unit to almost 1,280, a figure again unmatched by any other Petexbatun deposits. Details of the study assemblage are presented below in three informa­tion categories pertinent for understanding ancient Maya bone crafting: raw materials; general bone working techniques, and tools; and the L4-3 bone 
working reduction hierarchy. 
Raw Material of Bone Artifact Manufacturing 
Most vertebrate faunal remains from L4-3 are mammalian; fewer are reptilian, these mostly tur­tle carapace (Table 2). Of those mammalian remains that could be identified below the class level, most areArtiodactyls (predominantly white­tailed deer, Odocoileus virginianus). Taxonomic

richness was far lower in the L4-3 assemblage than in any other Petexbatlin sites (Emery 1997). The remains recovered are those that would have been most useful as the raw material for bone tool man­ufacture (Table 3). Hind limb bones predominate­upper, lower, and distal, particularly tibia, and metapodials-suggesting a procurement bias emphasizing selective importation of cervid hind limbs (possibly skinned, phalanges being infre­quent in the assemblage) and specific use of the strongest and straightest long bones. Axial and dis­tal elements, although numerous in the skeleton, are almost nonexistent in the L4-3 assemblage. Fragile cranial elements are common, in contrast, probably representing their use in the manufacture of disks and other fiat artifacts. This distribution of

•Note that animal remains from mortuary deposits (predominantly altered remains) are included in all counts. L4-3 did not 
include any mortuary fauna. Also note that invertebrate artifacts (N = 6 for L4-3) are included in this summary chart, though 
they are excluded from discussion in this paper. 
bUnits were variable in size and exact measurements are not available at this time. Density is therefore estimated as # 
bones/unit (which averaged 2x2 meters as defined by Petexbatun excavation strategy) by an estimated .5 meters depth (as 
defined generally by the depth of bedrock below surface at Dos Pilas).

Bone Working Techniques and Tools 
The standardized nature of bone working in the L4­3 assemblage provides insight into the mechanics of bone crafting, including tools and basic work­ing strategies. While some research has been done on the tools used in bone modification in the North American Southwest (Kidder 1932; Olsen 1988) and the Old World (d'Enico et al. 1984), there had been little similar work in the Maya region (for exceptions see Moholy-Nagy 1994; Wake 1999). However, Aoyama's (2007; Emery and Aoyama 2007) recent detailed work on lithic microwear pro­vides excellent new information on the stone tools used in bone and shell working. His analyses show that while some limited cutting and whittling of shell or bone was done using obsidian prismatic blades (only . l percent of all activities reported for these tools), most of the cutting, sawing, whittling, and grooving of bone and shell was done with chert tools including flakes (for which bone/shell work­ing accounted for 22.9 percent of use), bifacial thin­ning flakes (32.2 percent), oval bifaces (17.3
