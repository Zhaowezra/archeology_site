the recovered material culture, mostly dating fromA.D. 1800-1860. Based on the archaeological information, Singleton reconstructs the slave population, the infor­mal economy, expressive culture, and areas of slave resistance. 
Concluding comments are provided by Wilson, a leading American scholar on the archaeology and eth­nohistory of the Caribbean. He points out that due to its rich history of internationalization, cultural contributions of the Caribbean are abundant. Wilson praises the "mar­ketplace of ideas" promoted by the International Asso­ciation of Caribbean Archaeology (IACA), functioning since the 1960s, and how this group has worked suc­cessfully to bring together Spanish-, French-, Dutch-, and English-speaking archaeologists. He notes that, until this volume, the voice of Cuban archaeology has been largely muted by political and economic circumstances. 
The editors note (p. 3) that "[c]ommunication between colleagues, and the sharing of research results and ideas are critical to the advancement of all disci­plines." This book exposes readers to the archaeologi­cal world that exists in Jong-isolated Cuba. One of the objectives of the SAA is to promote professional inter­action, to facilitate the creation of knowledge and new directions in archaeology. This volume is an example of how the Society has been effective in this regard. Con­gratulations are due to the: SAA, for its extraordinary efforts to bring leading Cuban archaeologists to the orig­inal symposium and to promote an international debate; editors and authors, for their dedication in overcoming an array of hurdles to see the symposium and book to comp!etion; and the University of Alabama Press, which fought the resistance of the U.S. Treasury Department in order to get the volume published. 
Dialogues is an appropriate title for this fine collec­tion of papers, because we can hear in them the spirited beginnings of North-South communication. The vol­ume is proof that, with perseverance, collaborative archaeological research with Cuba is possible and that this, in tum, can lead to fruitful scholarship. Dialogues is a useful beginning to that conversation, and a book worth reading.
