This book contains fascinating, creative, path-breaking, and methodologically unique chapters, but the lexical elaboration, resulting semantic complexity, and the use of quotes for cross-referencing similar ideas of other authors gets in the way of a clear and convincing discourse that might be useful for those who are not familiar with the terminology that emerged from the authors’ face-to-face community of practice that led to the present volume.

Until recently, Cuban archaeology was not well known among Caribbean archaeologists. The more than 50 years of blockade affected not only the economy but also academia. Travel limitations and polarizing ide­ologies of both sides limited the degree and timing of communication, interaction, and exchange of ideas. As a result, Cuba produced a local archaeology somewhat in.uenced by Soviet archaeology, with the rest of the islands informed by the Anglo-European tradition. Exchange of information was dif.cult and limited. However, Cuban academia did not isolate itself and for the most part had no desire to do so. Although prejudices developed on both sides, the cessation of communication came largely from outside the island. Notable exceptions were Betty Megger’s continuous support of Cuban archaeology throughout the Cold War era (and I may add, at her personal risk), and Kathleen Deagan’s partnering with Cuban colleagues. 
This hardened intradisciplinary boundary, how­ever, began to crack 20 years ago with the publi­cation in English of a book by Dacal Moure and Rivero de la Calle in 1996, followed later by other publications. Several foreign archaeologists came over in the 1990s to conduct research on the island. The development of the internet and access to e-mail facilitated communication and exchange of informa­tion. Arguably the most important catalyst promot­ing intradisciplinary communication, however, was a young generation of Cuban colleagues who reached out to other Caribbeanists. Thanks to all these efforts, today Cuba is represented in all venues of Caribbean archaeology. 
It is within this historical context that this volume comes to light. Although several articles are related to the project at Canímar Abajo, a considerable number of papers are the product of other research. Edited by Ivan Roksandic, this volume has 13 chapters: the introduction, 11 articles, and .nal commentary. In the introduction, the editor summarizes the chapters and puts the contribution of Cuban archaeology into historical perspective. 
The .rst two chapters deal with the possibility of direct contact and migration between Cuba and Nicaragua. Chapter 1, by Roksandic (editor), consists of a review and summary of evidence for the possi­bility of people from Nicaragua migrating to Cuba by making stopovers in the many keys between the two regions. This is supported by recent .nds of Central American material in the Greater Antilles, the preliminary results of Roksandic’s linguistic study in Cuba, and the fact that modern .shermen from Nicaragua travel to distant islands along this route for their abundant .sheries. 
Sagrario Balladares Navarro and Leonardo Lechado Ríos (chapter 2) review the archaeology, chronology, and material culture of eastern Nicaragua. The chapter is very informative for those, such as myself, not familiar with this region. The review is thorough and provides information on cultural and chronological sequences and on human-landscape interaction. 
David G. Smith (chapter 3) presents a summary of the results of the project in an early Archaic site of Canímar Abajo and includes a description of the site, its deposits, some of the .ndings, and its chronology. Canímar Abajo consists of two superimposed ceme­teries separated by a shell deposit and extending over a thousand years, suggesting a long use of “sacred” space. Other unique .nds are dental mutilations in an early Precolumbian context. 
Chapter 4, by Roberto Rodríguez Suárez and colleagues, presents a successful experimental study of the use of Congo red dye to identify activities related to food preparation in starch grains, such as grinding and various degrees of boiling. 
In chapter 5, Mirjana Roksandic uses the juvenile-adult ratio and mean child mortality rates as proxies for mobility and fertility in the Young and Old cemeteries in Canímar Abajo. Although I disagree with the author’s claim that the cemeteries represent normal populations, she found that the individuals interred in the Young Cemetery seem to have had higher mobility than those of the Old Cemetery.

LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 28, No. 4, 2017] 
Chapter 6, by Darlene A. Weston and Roberto Valcárcel Rojas, includes paleodemographic and oste­ological studies of a colonial cemetery at El Chorro de Maíta. This burial population has been identi.ed as a cemetery associated with an encomienda, and it seems to include at least one European, together with African and local and nonlocal Indians. Based on demographic features, the authors claim the popula­tion went through a catastrophic collapse. However, patterns such as this one can be produced by social and historical factors. Interestingly, the osteological results yielded evidence of hard labor, but contrary to scholarly lore, there is little evidence of abuse and malnutrition, putting into question assumptions (or prejudices) scholars have about the colonial system. 
In chapter 7, Kaitlynn Alarie and M. Roksandic discuss and analyze dental modi.cations found in both cemeteries of Canímar Abajo, which is of great inter­est because no Precolumbian intentionally modi.ed teeth have been reported in the Caribbean before. The closest area with such practices is the Maya region. 
Yadira Chinique de Armas and colleagues (chapter 8) report the results of an extensive stable isotope study where a large number of sites throughout the Caribbean were compared. Interestingly, Canímar Abajo differed markedly from other Cuban Archaic sites, while it showed isotope ratios similar to those of agricultural sites from other islands. 
In chapter 9, Jason E. Laffoon, arguing that pre­colonial Puerto Rican migrant diets differed from those of the local population, proposes combining strontium isotope data with carbon and nitrogen isotope data to identify the presence of migrants in a population. Using ethnohistorical and archaeological evidence, Ulises M. González Herrera (chapter 10) describes various types of foods consumed among the Arawak aboriginal communities in Cuba and their preparation methods from ancient to colonial times. 
Válcarcel Rojas (chapter 11) presents a historical account of indigenous communities in Cuba from precolumbian to modern times, indicating that many communities survived well after the so-called “extinc­tion” promulgated by traditional historiography. Sim­ilarly, Jason M. Yaremko (chapter 12) focuses on the presence and survival of Maya Indians who came to the island for reasons ranging from forced migration to voluntary movement to escape persecution. The volume ends with a .nal commentary by Reniel Rodríguez Ramos (chapter 13), discussing the vol­ume from the perspective of the Greater Antilles, focusing on three main themes: origins, lifeways, and identities. 
In many respects, this volume shows both the advancements in Cuban archaeology and the increase in connectivity in the past decades. New approaches are being applied, new perspectives are being used, and new interpretations are being made. In short, it is a good sample of how dynamic and active Cuban archaeology is today. However, while the volume includes a wonderful variety of studies, I felt that several of the articles were forced into it. The articles related to the Nicaraguan connection seemed too pre­liminary, especially to be placed early in the volume. Also, Laffoon’s study in Puerto Rico was inexplicably included in a volume on Cuban archaeology. While we are not close to understanding the extensive, highly diverse, and complex archaeological record of this island, the chapters clearly show how invigorated and dynamic Cuban archaeology is today.

Over the past 15 years, there has been a renewed interest in Maya economics, ancient and modern. For the ancient Maya, this research seems to have taken on many of the characteristics of a paradigm shift. New data has seriously challenged older theories with new interpretations leading to the formation of completely new theories. For the present Maya, research has focused on the syncretism of traditional cultures with globalized economies and the utility and morality of commodifying an ancient past. Scholars have pub­lished a good half-dozen major works on these subjects since 2000, detailing both modern ethnographies and novel archaeological perspectives. The latest book comes from the University of Arizona Press: The Value of Things: Prehistoric to Contemporary Commodities in the Maya Region, edited by Jennifer P. Mathews and Thomas H. Guderjan. On the whole, the book is a mixed effort, with both hits and misses, but it does make an important contribution to understanding how the Maya economy functioned and functions. 
The book is divided into 12 chapters, each address­ing a different commodity. These are jade, agriculture, chert, salt, honey/wax, cacao, henequen, sugar/rum, land, ceramics, and cultural products for tourism. They are also grouped chronologically, the .rst half of
