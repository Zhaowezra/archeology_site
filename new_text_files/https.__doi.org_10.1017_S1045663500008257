directed excavations (218 .5 m2) between 2004 and 2007. Tenahaha was mainly occupied during the Middle Hori­zon, whereas its neighbor Collota (originally confused for a Wari administrative center) was occupied in the Late Horizon. Yepez Alvarez describes the field method­ology in detail and presents 26 radiocarbon dates obtained from excavated samples. Fifteen dates corre­spond to the Middle Horizon, all of which belong to the second half of the period (A.D. 850-1050). 
In Chapter 4, Jennings and colleagues describe the excavations that took place in the ceremonial/residential sector of the site. The authors use evidence found in the houses, enclosures, storage facilities, and agricultural terraces to argue that the site was not permanently occu­pied, but instead was a locale for the performance of rit­uals and feasts. Tenahaha would have been a pilgrimage center and necropolis where people from surrounding villages periodically gathered to honor and bury their dead. 
In Chapter 5, Yepez Alvarez and colleagues describe the excavation of seven tombs containing at least 171 individuals in the funerary zone at Tenahaha. The tombs included primary and secondary burials, and the bones and offerings were often moved and reorganized, indi­cating that tombs were reopened several times. Most individuals were buried with ceramic vessels, several of which were Wari-influenced. Some women, men, and children were buried with prestige and exotic goods that could point to emerging inherited status differences. 
Chapters 6-9 present analyses conducted on artifacts and human remains recovered at Tenahaha. In Chapter 6, Oscar Huaman Lopez and colleagues describe four local ceramic styles used during the Middle Horizon, among which two were Wari-influenced. These Wari­influenced vessels are reminiscent of several Wari and Wari-related styles, including Huamanga, Vifiaque, Pachacamac, and Atarco. In Chapter 7, Patricia Bedre gal and colleagues present a provenience study (INAA) of the pottery found in the Cotahuasi Valley. Results indicate that all Middle Horizon pottery-even the most Wari­influenced-was local and that none of the tested frag­ments came from Ayacucho. 
In Chapter 8, Maria Ines D. Velarde and colleagues briefly describe the metal objects recovered at Tenahaha, most of which were tupus made of ternary bronze. In Chapter 9, Corina M. Kellner and colleagues present the analyses of human remains. The most common patholo­gies noted on these remains suggest a diet high in maize and repeated agricultural work, while infections and other conditions were rare. Limited evidence of trauma indicates that people buried at Tenahaha were seldom engaged in interpersonal conflicts. 
In Chapter 10, Jennings concludes that the Cotahuasi Valley was neither conquered nor controlled by the Wari state, but instead that Wari influence on material culture spread through interregional interaction networks. Jen­nings argues that the Middle Horizon in Cotahuasi was a time of increased social tensions due to larger village sizes, emerging social inequality, and interregional inter­actions; Tenahaha would have been built to bring people together and relieve these tensions. The Wari would have contributed to these tensions by introducing (although indirectly) new items and ideas to the region, which quickly became popular and important in the creation of a new "cosmopolitan" identity (p. 209). Finally, the Appendix (Matthew J. Edwards) offers preliminary data from the Late Horizon occupation of the neighboring site of Collota. Most of the chapter is dedicated to the demonstration that the site was indeed an Inka-and not a Wari -settlement. 
This volume presents convincing evidence that the Cotahuasi Valley was not under Wari control during the Middle Horizon. Despite notable changes during that period, Wari stylistic influence did not result in political or economic control. These findings echo what other scholars are finding in other regions of Peru and should allow Andean archaeologists not only to rethink the Mid­dle Horizon but also to redefine models of state expansion and culture contact and reevaluate archaeological signa­tures of state control. Early states often built outposts and enclaves to extract key resources in areas that they did not always dominate. Other regions where such enclaves were not present could obtain or emulate a state's material culture without necessarily compromis­ing their sovereignty. Cotahuasi seems to be one of these areas where the production and use ofWari-like material culture did not result in the loss of local autonomy.

Mesoamerican figurine studies have matured. One sign of that maturity is the publication of extended studies of specific figurine assemblages. Christina Halperin 's book is an example, greatly advancing our understanding of Classic Maya figurine variation, distribution, and use in the southern Maya lowlands. Halperin begins with an assemblage of figurines generated through work at Motul de San Jose, in the Guatemalan Peten. She adds data on figurine assemblages from 14 other sites in the Peten and in Belize. Significant comparisons are made to fig­urines from the western Maya lowlands, from Jaina and from the Uhia tradition of northern Honduras, drawing on recent work by other analysts. Yet the book does not

simply present a catalogue or distributional study of Maya figurines: instead, it argues for seeing figurines as products of, and tools in, the political economy that inte­grated households in Maya states. Halperin's argument is that figurines were made and used in ways that created connections that were not solely the product of state action, and that their use in this area of the Maya lowlands reiterated and reproduced ideologies that overlapped with official state discourses, while recording a wider range of social actors. 
As the ambitious goal of the book is to engage in understanding of the articulation of households and states, the argument is laid out thematically. After a brief introduction, the first chapter argues that in Maya studies, household and state have often been treated in dichoto­mous ways. In what others have called a "bottom up" approach, Maya society is seen as a network of house­holds, and the state is not considered. In the alternative top-down approach, household actions are seen as con­strained by or defined by the state. Instead of either of these positions, Halperin suggests that it is more produc­tive to focus on the ways in which households articulate with states, and he argues that figurines are one of the specific bodies of material culture through which state and household are articulated. 
The articulation that is the focus of the book is then pursued in a series of chapters whose focus is on under­standing figurines themselves. In the second chapter, Halperin introduces theoretical perspectives on mimesis and materiality. The discussion of mimesis, an extended engagement with the work of Michael Taussig, culmi­nates in the definition of a framework for understanding mimesis and power relations, appropriate for the project of the book. The four chapters that follow show well how an approach strongly rooted in mimesis can inform an understanding of representational media like figurines. 
These chapters consider figurines from a series of perspectives. First, Halperin explores the idea that fig­urines replicate state ceremony on a smaller scale, for a wider audience, representing more participants. Next, she considers how the same assemblages demonstrate themes also typical of oral narratives and festival per­formances in which a large part of the populace might take part. She uses ideas of carnival and reversals of power that are exemplified by tricksters and clowns, actors she identifies in the imagery of some figurines. This pair of chapters exemplifies how to trace the artic­ulation of state and household that Halperin calls for in her introduction and first chapter. She underlines in mul­tiple ways the idea that the rulers in Maya states drew on beliefs that were shared by those they ruled, but that rulers and ruled might place emphasis on different aspects of those beliefs. 
The next two chapters take different tacks, one argu­ing for a political economy of figurines (through consid­eration of their manufacture and circulation), the other for the use of figurines in performances. Halperin uses three concepts of consumption in her discussion of fig­urine political economies: elite art, folk culture, and mass media. She considers regional scale and within-site dis­tributions of figurines and draws on a number of lines of evidence for production, including paste analyses, mold distributions, and a classification of figurines in terms of techniques of production. There is so much variability in the corpus she includes here that one chapter is prob­ably not enough space to do full justice to the data; the many graphs and charts here (and the data in the appen­dices) will be of great interest to specialists on figurines and could be the basis of additional discussion. 
What stands as the most direct conclusion of the book actually comes at the end of the chapter on political econ­omy, when Halperin writes that "ceramic figurines are implicated in the making of states in that they helped for­mulate polity-wide networks that cross-cut lines of status, rank, lineage, and house" (p. 184). They did this by por­traying themes that came from shared beliefs and per­formances in material forms that circulated widely, sometimes clearly not through centrally administered trade. This conclusion might have been bolstered by some of the themes of contemporary materiality research touched on earlier in the volume, but this work is really not integrated as completely into the study as is the frame­work of mimesis and power. 
The conclusions reached in the chapter on political economy lead into the last chapter, which considers fig­urines in detail. This chapter, like the preceding one, includes many ideas in a short space, some of them more fully worked through than others. By using a concept of the performances in which figurines participated, Halperin avoids the trap of defining the "function" of figurines while enriching our understanding of how they were and could have been used. She emphasizes the hybrid nature of many figurines, which were simultane­ously musical instruments, pointing to their use in cere­monies. She argues for rethinking the arbitrary divisions of play, ritual, and performance, a suggestive analysis that brings people of all ages and ranks into the picture as potential users of figurines. 
The final chapter returns to the question of state and household articulation. While pulling together some of the points that were made in earlier chapters, it demon­strates that the analysis has opened as many doors, and raised as many questions, as it has answered, and it invites additional studies of well-documented figurine assem­blages that similarly take figurines as media for social relations.
