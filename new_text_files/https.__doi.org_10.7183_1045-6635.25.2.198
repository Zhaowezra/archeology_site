LINKING CAVE, MOUNTAIN, AND SKY: 
A SUBTERRANEAN OBSERVATION POINT FOR THE SUNRISE ON 
THE DAY OF SOLAR ZENITH TRANSIT IN YUCATAN, MEXICO 

Donald A. Slater 
In the Maya region scholars have long noted the connection between solar alignments and radial pyramids at sites such as Chichen Itzti, Dzibilchaltun, and Uaxactun. Just 26.5 km west-southwest of Chichen ltzti, the site of lkil also contains a massive radial pyramid, known as Structure I. In May 2011 investigations at Ikil revealed that this pyramid also figures in a solar hierophany-the sunrise over the pyramid's summit on the days of the solar zenith transit. What is unique, however, is that the observation point for this event is situated inside of a cave to the west of the pyramid . In this paper, evidence is presented that suggests the location of Structure I was dictated by the orientation of the cave, and that the physical and ceremonial linkage of these two landscape features created the cosmic hub of Ikil. Furthermore, it is argued that ceremonies marking the solar zenith-a day largely ignored in Euro-Christian calendars-would have been enacted by the ruling class as a way to formalize and sanctify the annual rebirth of the agricultural cycle, while publicly displaying their connection to the divine and thus legitimizing their position of high religious and social status.

El sitio de Ikil, tan solo a unos 27 km al suroeste de Chichen /tzti, tambien tiene una gran pirtimide radial conocida coma Estructura I. lnvestigaciones realizadas en Mayo de! 201I en lkil revelaron que esta pirtimide form6 parte de una hierofan(a, espec(ficamente el amanecer sabre la cima de la pirtimide en las dias del paso cenital de! sol.

espite the small overall size of the ancient transit as viewed from an observation area within Dsettlement of Ikil, the site contains one the cave. In addition, I argue that the ceremonial of the largest ancient buildings in central viewing of this event would have been initiated Yucatan-Structure 1 (Andrews IV and Stuart to formally signal the annual rebirth of the agri­1968:73). The pyramid, along with a cave im­cultural cycle and to situate the ruling elites in a mediately to its west, forms the ceremonial and position of power and control over time, space, cosmic heart of the site. This paper explores the the spiritual realm, and ultimately the livelihood physical and ritual relationship between these of the populace. In so doing, this case study at two significant features at Ikil and demonstrates Ikil provides a cogent example of the significance that the natural orientation of the cave on the to the Maya people of the first day of solar zenith landscape dictated the site selection and position­transit, a date essentially disregarded by Euro­ing of Structure 1-the only truly monumental Christian calendrics. building at Ikil.

(l 983:57n.28) noted that Structure 1, the massive radial pyramid at Ikil (Figure l) differed from ex­amples at Chichen Itza, Dzibilchaltun, and Maya­pan in that it lacked a nearby cenote. However, a large cave does exist in direct association with Structure l at Ikil-it was simply unknown at the time. In 2009, with the aid of local guides, I lo­cated and explored a sizable and heavily utilized cave at Ikil obscured by vegetation in a rejollada (a bowl-shaped karst depression) that abuts the west edge of the platform of Structure l (Figure 2). The cave was later mapped and partially ex­cavated by my team. Like other radial pyramids in the Maya region, Structure l figures in an im­portant astronomical alignment, which will be re­ported in this paper. What is unique about the alignment at Ikil, however, is that its observation point is situated within the adjacent cave. 
Ikil is located roughly 26.5 km west-southwest of Chichen Itza (Figure 3). The site has been known to archaeologists since the 1930s (Morley 1937:249, 375), but detailed descriptions were not published until the 1950s and l 960s-most notably Andrews IV 's and Stuart's (1968) docu­mentation of Ikil's 26 m tall radial step pyramid and the hieroglyphic lintels that span two of the four interior doorways above niches within its summit temple (Figure 4). No mapping or sys­tematic excavation of the site occurred until 2008 and 2011, respectively. This work was conducted by the Proyecto de lnteracci6n Polftica de! Centro de Yucatan (PIPCY ), directed by Travis Stanton and Aline Magnoni, and its Central Yucatan Ar­chaeological Cave Project (CYAC) which I direct (Slater 2014; Stanton and Magnoni 2009a, 2009b, 2013). 
Thus far, dating of the site comes from several sources-ceramic data from excavations within the cave and in surface contexts, associated ac­celerator mass spectrometry (AMS) dates, and stylistic analysis of Structure l's architecture and hieroglyphic lintels. Limited test excavations around Structure 1 revealed a small number of ceramics dating as early as the Late Formative period (300 B.C.-A.D. 250)' (Stanton and Magnoni 2013). Abundant Flores Waxy Ware ce­ramics of the Dzudzuquil and Joventud groups (Andrews 1988; Smith 1971; Stanton and Magnoni 2013) recovered during excavations in Ikil Cave 1 , Operation 5 demonstrate that the

cave was first used during the Middle Formative period (800-300 B.C.) (Slater 2014). An AMS date of 2503 ± 37 (AA96623; charcoal; 013C = ­25.630; 791-421 cal B.C., 2-sigma)' associated with these ceramics supports this assertion. Ce­ramic data then show sparse usage in the cave by at least the Late Formative through the Early Classic periods (300 B.C.-A.D. 600) followed by a veritable explosion of activity during the Late and Terminal Classic (A.D. 600-1100). This is evidenced by the fact that roughly 65 percent of identifiable sherds from the cave come from Slate Wares of the Muna group (Slater 2014; Smith 1971). In addition, with the presence of pottery from other ceramic groups such as Sisal, Dzitas, and Chum (Smith 1971) the total percent­age of Late to Terminal Classic ceramics is pushed to about 77 percent (Slater 2014). Though some stratigraphic mixing was noted, two Ter­minal Classic AMS dates of 1179 ± 35 (AA96624; charcoal; o"C -25.130; cal A.D. 
= 
723-969, 2-sigma) and 1175 ± 35 (AA96622; charcoal; o"C -25.830; cal A.D. 727-970, 2­
= 
sigma) were generated from charcoal recovered from levels in Operation 5 with high concentra­tions of these ceramics. Lastly, the architectural style of the earliest observable phase of Structure 1 has been dated as early as the eighth century 
A.D. (Stanton and Magnoni 2013:390-392, see Andrews IV and Stuart 1968 for a slightly earlier dating interpretation), which overlaps with the stylistic dating of the hieroglyphic lintels to A.D. 650-750 (Biro 2003). 
It is thus possible, perhaps even likely, that the usage of Ikil Cave 1 during the Middle For­mative period predated the settlement of Ikil. Similar patterns have been recorded at other sites that contain prominent caves such as Dos Pilas (Brady 1997:610), Maax Na (King et al. 2012:622), and in the Yalahau region of Quintana Roo (Risso lo 2003: 131), and the Si bun Valley of Belize (Peterson 2006:63). In these cases, the presence of caves was likely the primary reason for settlement site selection (Brady 1997:610, 614; Brady and Ashmore 1999:128, 130; Brady and Prufer 2005:372; Brown 2005:373; Halperin 2005:71; Prufer and Brady 2005a:404, 2005b:12; Rissolo 2003:129). In some cases it could be ar­gued that drinking water contained within caves was one of the main attractions to many of these karst features (Brown 2005:373). However, water was not observed in Ikil Cave 1 nor does the cave appear to have contained water in ancient times. Despite this, the cave still would have been be-

lieved to be a portal into the animate earth, a con­duit to important deities and ancestors, and as noted at other sites (Brady and Colas 2005: 150­151; Halperin 2005:74; Prufer and Brady 2005a:404-405), the axis mundi of the settlement. Furthermore, the cave at Ikil could have been viewed as a wellspring of powerful life energy known variously in the ethnographic record throughout the Maya region as ch'ulel (Vogt 1965:33, 1969:369-374, 1970:1154, 1976:18), o6x(Bourdin 2008:13-14; Kray 2005:344-345), and pusik'al (Lois 1998:245). Such associations would have served to sacralize the settlement site selection and legitimize the rule of the site's founding elites (Brady 1997:615; Garcia-Zam­brano 1994; Halperin 2005:71-72; Slater 2014). 
Mapping efforts by PIPCY demonstrate that despite the presence of a pyramid similar to Chichen Itza's El Castillo in form and size (Figure 5), the rest of the site contains no other monu­mental architecture to compliment such an im­pressive structure. Given the level of political power and control that must have been wielded to build Structure 1, it is peculiar that not even one other structure at the site is of comparable magnitude. As such, it seems certain that the focal point of the site is the ceremonial complex formed by the relationship between Structure 1 and Cave 1 (Figure 6). The following arguments will demonstrate that the placement of Structure 1 was carefully planned around the natural orien­tation of the cave and to mark the rising of the sun on the days of zenith passage. 
Astronomical Alignments and Radial Pyramids 
Throughout Mesoamerica, astronomically aligned architecture has been documented that marks im­portant moments in the cycles of Venus (Aveni 1977: 16, 2001 :283-288; Aveni et al. 1975:Table 1; Milbrath 1999:263), particular stars (Aveni 2001:267, Fig. 92; Aveni et al. 1975:Table I}, and most commonly, the sun (Aveni 1977:16, 2001:288-293; Aveni et al. 1975:Table 1, 2003:163, 2004; Coggins 1983; Rivard 1971). In addition to being the largest, brightest, and most easily predictable heavenly body, thus rendering its observation most feasible, the sun was directly tied to the notion of divine kingship among the
