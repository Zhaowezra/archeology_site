SPEARTHROWER OWL HILL: 
A TOPONYM AT ATETELCO, TEOTIHUACAN 

Jesper Nielsen and Christophe Helmke 
The important Classic period site ofTeotihuacan is renowned for its great size, ancient influence, and intricately decorated polychrome murals. The latter are the focus of the present study, in particular the unique landscape scene from Murals 2 and 3 from Portico I of the North Patio of the Atetelco residential compound that depicts a row of toponymic hill signs. The three hills have identical qualifying elements embedded, identified as combinations of an owl and a spearthrower. The murals thus make a repeated reference to a place named "Spearthrower Owl Hill." The dating of the murals to the Early Xolalpan phase (ca. A.D. 350-450) makes them contemporary with the so-called Teotihuacan entrada into the Maya lowland sites such as Tikal, where hieroglyphic texts make mention of a Teotihuacan-affiliated individual known as "Spearthrower Owl." From these findings-and based on Mesoamerican naming practices-we go on to suggest that the Atetelco toponym and the historical individual share the name of a common forebear, possibly that of a previously unidentified Teotihuacan mar­tial patron deity. As such, the Early Classic Teotihuacan "Spearthrower Owl" deity has much in common with the legendary Huitzilopochtli of the Late Postclassic Mexica. Our reexamination of the murals from Atetelco shows the enormous poten­tial that further studies in Teotihuacan writing and iconography still have for our understanding of the history and religion of this major Mesoamerican site. 
El importante sitio arqueologico de Teotihuacan del per{odo Clasico, es famoso para su gran tamaiio, su infiuencia en la antigiiedad y sus murales adornados por dibujos policromos detallados. Los ultimas son el foco del presente estudio; partic­ularmente el paisaje de los Mura/es 2 y 3, del Portico I en el Patio Norte del compuesto residencial de Atetelco que repre­senta una cordillera de colinas topon{micas. Las tres colinas aparecen marcadas por elementos nominales identicos incrustados, identificados como combinaciones de bUhos y lanzadardos (propulsores de dardos o lanzas, conocidos tambien como atlatls). Los murales hacen as{ una referencia reiterada a un lugar nombrado 'Colina del Buho con lanzadardos'. La datacion de los murales a la Jase del Xolalpan Temprano (hacia el 350-450 d.C.) es contemporanea con la supuesta 'entrada' de Teotihuacan en sitos tales como Tikal en las tierras bajas mayas, donde los textos jeroglificos hacen mencion a un individuo historico de afiliacion teotihuacana conocido como 'Buho Lanzadardos ' ("Spearthrower Owl"). Basandonos en estas conclusiones y apoyandonos en las practicas onomasticas mesoamericanas, sugerimos que el toponimo de Atetelco y el apellido del indi­viduo historico, que incluyen el elemento comun 'Buho Lanzadardos ', comparten el nombre de un precursor comun. Por tanto, el precursor se refiere posiblemente a una deidad marcial patronal de Teotihuacan, previamente no identificado. Como tal, dicha deidad de Teotihuacan de! Clasico Temprano tiene mucho en comun con el Huitzilopochtli legendario de los mexica del Postclasico Tardfo. Nuestro analisis de los murales de Atetelco demuestra el potencial enorme que otros estudios de la escrit­ura e iconografia de Teotihuacan pueden tener para nuestra comprension de la historia y de la religion de este importante sitio Mesoamericano.

In this article we examine a language of a probably multiethnic Teotihuacan unique landscape-like scene from the murals of the remains unknown. Next, we touch upon how this

Toponyms in Mesoamerican 
Writing Systems and Teotihuacan 

Most Mesoamerican languages make use of promi­nent physiographic features in the natural land­scape in forming toponyms, and it has long been recognized by scholars that this is reflected in the graphic representations of such place signs in both writing and iconography of most Mesoamerican cultures (Boone 2000; Marcus I 992; Smith I973; Stuart and Houston I994). Thus, glyphs designat­ing place names are often composed of such nat­ural elements called "geographical substantives" and "qualifiers," that is, one or more elements that specify what mountain, cave, or other topograph­ical element is intended to be named (Smith I 973:38-41 ). According to Boone, the qualifiers "carry much of the identity of the place sign" and cover "a wide range of objects, conceptions, and qualities" (Boone 2000:51 ). By far the most com­mon of the geographical substantives is "moun­tain," and in the so-called "open" writing systems of western Mesoamerica (Houston 2004) the qual­ifiers are placed either on top of the mountain, or embedded within mountain-signs. Abundant examples of this practice are found in Aztec and Mixtec writing, and the writing systems of earlier central Mexican cultures (e.g., Cacaxtla and Xochicalco ). While mountain place names are extremely common, other geographical substan­tives also appear to be quite widespread in the Late Postclassic period, e.g. trees, rivers, and caves. Place signs can be used both to refer to specific locations in the landscape (such as a particular mountain or cave), to congregations of built space such as towns or city-states, and to specific areas or buildings within sites (Marcus 1992: I 57; Stu­art and Houston I 994:81-89). Because Teotihua­can culture played such a pivotal role in the development of Mexican highland cultures and the central Mexican tradition of writing, it is rea­sonable to assume that a similar, although not nec­essarily identical, tradition of representing place 
names existed at that site (Berlo 1989; Browder 2005; Taube 2000a). 
Previously, scholars have focused on what is believed to be Teotihuacan place names based on "trees" such as those encountered in the murals of Techinantitla (Berlo 1983, 1989; Corona Sanchez 2002; Pasztory 1988a). However, years ago Jorge Angulo undertook pioneering work on Teotihua­can place names based on a mountain-"founda­tion." Thus, Angulo appears to have been the first to suggest that a stylized mountain or "hill sign" could form part of Teotihuacan toponyms (Angulo 1972:50-51, 1996:74, 82-89). His suggestion was based on examples from the murals of Portico 2 of Tepantitla, some of which combine a mountain and a tree (as do many Aztec toponyms), but he did not attempt a further analysis of this particular group of signs as a whole. In Karl Taube's recent study of Teotihuacan writing, toponyms are discussed at some length, and the so-called "stepped moun­tains" are briefly touched upon as probable place names (Taube 2000a:7-9, 25-26). Taube also sug­gests the existence of a possible locative suffix in the shape of a "twisted-root" -sign, perhaps derived from the tree-toponyms (Taube 2000a:9), or from a more general meaning of "belonging to" or "orig­inating in." The Atetelco toponym we shall discuss in the following is formed by precisely this "stepped mountain" and has the "twisted-root" -sign attached beneath it. 
The Spearthrower Owl Hill of Patio 3 at Atetelco 
Murals 2 and 3 from Portico I of the North Patio (Patio 3) of the Atetelco compound (Figure 2) are dated to the Early Xolalpan phase (ca. A.D. 350-450).1 The murals were discovered in a frag­mented state by Laurette Sejourne in I 980--1982 and a reconstruction drawing of the mural was later made by Santos Villasanchez (Cabrera Castro 1995:248-249, Figure I8. 18). The original mural fragments are presently located in a bodega in the Zona Arqueol6gica of Teotihuacan. The layout of the murals is divided into two parts (Figure 3a). The lower portion depicts two raptorial birds standing atop platforms or pedestals decorated with obsid­ian blades, thorns, and cacti. Surrounding this cen­tral scene is a border formed by a coyote-serpent-like being with multiple limbs and

intertwined with a band exhibiting flames and tufts of malinalli-grass. The upper part-enigmatically placed up-side down-consists of a row of smaller hills and three larger stepped hills all with identi­cal qualifying elements embedded (Figure 3b).2 The landscape is dotted with tufts of grass and irregularly shaped objects recently identified by Jennifer Browder as rocks and stones (Browder 2005: 106). Emerging from the hills and mountains are what appear to be obsidian blades.3 Above, or behind, the hilly landscape, are depicted different kinds of plants: nopal and barrel cacti, thorns, maguey or agave plants, and malinalli-grass.4 The Atetelco landscape scene is comparable to much later Postclassic and Colonial representations of landscape also produced in the Valley of Mexico. 
Thus, for example, in the famous image from His­toria Tolteca-Chichimeca showing the "Place of the Seven Caves" (Kirchhoff et al. 1976:Folio l 6r) and in the map of the Relacion Geografica de Tetlis­taca (Mundy 1996:Figure 43), we find the same plants, characteristic of the semi-arid highland region of highland central Mexico, growing around the mountains, caves, and towns, as we see depicted in the Atetelco landscape scene (Nielsen 2006b ). 
Taube has suggested that the stepped mountains of the Atetelco landscape scene refer to "a partic­ular hill or place" (2000a:9, 25-26). We fully agree, and we will argue that they may refer to a specific place within Teotihuacan. The qualifying element combines an owl' s head and wings with a spearthrower or atlatl (Figure 4).
