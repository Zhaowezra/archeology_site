
MAYA DIETS OF THE RICH AND POOR: 
PALEOETHNOBOTANICAL EVIDENCE FROM COPAN 

David L. Lentz 
Analysis of plant remains recovered from excavations at Copan in western Honduras has provided substantive data regarding agroeconomic systems of the prehistoric inhabitants. The time span of the deposits ranges from the Gordon/Uir phase (900-400 B.C.), which may have been non-Maya, to the Coner phase (A.D. 700-900+), which encompasses the collapse of the Classic Maya cultural manifestation in the valley. Several traditionally recognized mesoamerican cultigens were identified including corn, beans, and several species of Cucurbitaceae. In addition, remains of a number of economic tree species were discovered, suggesting a reliance on arboriculture as part of the subsistence strategy. Pine charcoal predominated in all deposits and may have been the preferred wood for fuel and construction. Analysis of edible-plant-species distributions from low-and high-status Late Classic dwellings using the Shannon-Weaver index revealed that elite individuals had a higher diversity of available foods, a situation that may have led to nutritional stress among lower-status individuals and, ultimately, social unrest. 
En las excavaciones de/ sitio de Copan, en el occidente de Honduras, se encontraron muchos restos de plantas. El analisis de los mis mos ha proporcionado una cantidad de datos muy grande sobre los sistemas agroecon6micos de sus habitantes prehist6ricos. El lapso de /os dep6sitos oscila entre las fases Gordon!Uir (900-400 A.C.), las cuales pueden corresponder a grupos no-mayas, hasta la fase Coner (700-900+ D.C.) la cual abarca el colapso de la manifestaci6n cultural maya Cliisica en el valle. Se identificaron varios cultivos tradicionales mesoamericanos incluyendo mafz, frijol, y varias especies de Cucurbitaceae. Ademiis se descubrieron restos de varias especies econ6micos de arboles, indicando una dependencia en la arboricultura como parte de la estrategia de subsistencia. Restos de carbon de pino fueron predominantes en todos los dep6sitos y es posible que el mismo haya sido la madera preferida para combustible y construcci6n. Se utiliz6 el indice de Shannon-Weaver para determinar la distribuci6n de especias de plantas comestibles en casas de estratos bajos y altos def Clasico Tardio. El resultado reve/6 que los individuos de la elite dispusieron de una mayor diversidad de comida. Esta situaci6n pudo haber conducido a una presi6n nutricional entre los individuos de estratos inferiores provocando, en ultimo caso, desorden social. 
For many years archaeologists have debated the potential methods of Precolumbian food pro­duction and the ability of the ancient Maya to sustain expanding urban populations during the Late Classic period. Most explanations for the collapse of the Classic Maya cultural system, whether based on a unilineal or polythetic model, refer in some way to the limited adaptive capacity of Maya agricultural technology. Notwithstanding this emphasis on agrotechnology, few studies have focused on the actual cultigens exploited or have relied on circumstantial evidence without referring to the main archaeological data source: artifacts buried in the ground. This study represents an atempt to provide more substantive data regarding plants used by the ancient Maya and the kind of ecological interactions they indicate. 
Copan is a well-studied civic/ceremonial center that lies on the southeastern periphery of the ancient Maya realm in what is now western Honduras (Figure 1). Modem excavations in the Copan Valley, beginning in 1976 with the Proyecto Arqueol6gico Copan under the direction of Gordon 
R. Willey and later Claude F. Baudez (Fash 1983), followed by an extensive regional survey (Webster 1985), large-scale excavations in the Sepulturas residential area under the direction of William T. Sanders and David Webster (Sanders and Webster 1988), excavations in the Main Group directed by William Fash, and recent excavations of large satellite communities directed by Stephen Whittington have furnished the measured flotation and archaeobotanical samples that served as the data source for this study. Samples analyzed came from eight operations in the residential urban Sepulturas area, two large satellite communities (Los Mangos and Ostuman), several contexts in the Main Group area, and eight small sites from the rural survey.

A central issue of this study involves the variations in food-use activities among the different social strata during the Late Classic period. Using the typology for residential units that paralleled social status established for Copan by Willey et al. (1978), it is possible to extrapolate from clearly visible architectural features to status levels of the occupants. Residential units were assigned status levels according to architectural and other features, so that a Type IV household, being most elaborate, would represent a high-status, elite dwelling, while the least elaborate domiciliary com­pounds would be designated as Type I or single-mound structures. These represent peasant, or "commoner," households (Webster and Gonlin 1988). 
ENVIRONMENT 
The climate of the valley is typical of the wet and dry tropics, with a six-month wet season (May through October) followed by six months of reduced rainfall. The average annual precipitation is 
1.44 m, and the average monthly temperature varies from 19. 5°C in the coolest month (December) to 25.8°C in the hottest month of April (Turner et al. 1983). Elevations in the area range from 1,483 mat Cerro la Campana to just under 600 m on the valley floor. The environment of the Copan pocket has been described (Abrams and Rue 1988; Turner et al. 1983) as having three ecological zones: (1) a bottomland zone consisting of alluvial terraces that parallel the Copan River, (2) a foothill or piedmont zone on the adjacent slopes, and (3) an upland forest zone in the higher elevations of the study area. The alluvial terraces of the bottomland were once covered with tropical deciduous forest (see Smith and Johnson 1945), but these were gradually cleared away for agricultural purposes as populations in the valley expanded. The foothill zone under pristine circumstances was initially covered with broadleaf hardwoods, many of which also would have been found in the bottomlands minus the larger forest dominants that probably dropped out as the slopes got steeper. As agricultural land, the foothill zone was marginal, requiring long fallow periods between periods of minimal productivity. The upland forests were composed predominantly of pines and oaks as the visual

dominants. This zone was of little value for agricultural purposes (Fash 1983; Freter 1988), but apparently was a major source of fuel, building material, game animals, and other resources for the prehistoric occupants of the valley. 
OCCUPATIONAL HISTORY 
The area was first inhabited during Preclassic times, ca. 1000 B.C., and major occupation continued until the Postclassic period. Figure 2 outlines the occupational history of Copan based on the ceramic sequence described by Rene Viel (see Webster and Gonlin 1988). It should be noted, however, that recent studies based on obsidian hydration (Webster and Freter 1990) and palynological data (Rue 1987) indicate that the duration of the Coner phase may be longer than previously thought (Sanders 1989; Webster and Freter 1990; Webster and Gonlin 1988). It seems the Maya were not the first

inhabitants of the Copan Valley (Mandeville 1987), but were more recent parvenues who entered the pocket at the end of the Bijac phase. They initially coexisted with, and eventually dominated, the indigenous non-Maya population. Although the focus of this study was on Classic Maya de­velopments, archaeobotanical samples available from earlier deposits were analyzed also. 
METHODS 
Project archaeologists collected soil samples from a variety of contexts including middens, hearths, room floors, patio floors, trenches into structures, structure terrace surfaces, burials, cache vessels, and postholes. In general, flotation samples were collected as one or two measured liters of soil. When special contexts required different soil volumes, such as cache vessels that might be smaller than one liter or the chultun that was 10 liters, the sample volume collected was so recorded. Samples were floated with a screen-bottomed bucket flotation device similar to the one described in Pearsall ( 1989). Heavy and light fractions were bagged separately and set aside for different types of analysis since the heavy fraction was most useful for lithic study, and the light fraction contained the charred plant parts used as data for the research described herein. 
Dried light fractions were subdivided into three particle sizes using standard geological sieves of 1-and 2-mm mesh. This separation facilitated the sorting process since seeds and other pJant remains of the same taxa tended to fall into the same particle size. Each piece of carbonized material from the largest particle sizc: (>2 mm) was identified to genus or speci1ts, whenever possible, then grouped with other particles of the same taxon and weighed with an O'Haus triple-beam balance accurate to .01 g. All of this information along with provenience and temporal data were recorded on standard forms designed for rapid data entry into computer data-base files. The two smaller particle sizes were scanned at low magnification (30X) for identifiable taxa, especially seeds, and the results were recorded as with the largest particle size. 
Charcoal from the largest particle size was initially placed into one of three categories: Pinus (pine), Angiosperm (hardwoods), or Arecaceae (palm). No charcoal was identified from the two smaller particle sizes since the limited anatomical view of the cell-structure pattern prohibited accurate identification. After initial sorting, the best-preserved Angiosperm charcoal was examined further and compared to the wood collection of the Honduran Forestry Service and the reference collection of the author. The latter was collected from the Copan Valley and other locations in Honduras. Voucher specimens have been deposited at the herbarium of the Escuela Agricola Pan­americana, Zamorano, Honduras, and the University of Alabama Herbarium, Tuscaloosa. 
DIET ARY SPECIES 
A total of 208 flotation and macrofossil samples was analyzed from the Copan excavations, and a summary of the results is found in Table 1. Carbonized remains of several cultivars were recovered from a wide variety of deposits in the valley. 
To no one's surprise, corn (Zea mays) was common in archaeological strata of all time periods and status levels. Unfortunately, no whole corn cobs were recovered, but three small caches contained carbonized kernels (Figure 3a) that had already been removed from their cobs prior to burning. The dimensions of these three samples are listed in Table 2. Row numbers were estimated by measuring the side angles of each kernel. In overall shape, dimension, and row number, the kernels resembled those described for the Mexican Chapalote-Nal-Tel complex (Manglesdorf 1974; Well­hausen et al. 1952). This type of maize was found earliest in the Tehuacan Valley, Mexico, from Abejas phase (3000 B.C.) deposits (Manglesdorf et al. 1967). In Central America, Chapalote-Nal­Tel corn was found at the Early Classic Salinas La Blanca site, Guatemala (Manglesdorf 1967); the Early Classic Severo Ledesma site, Costa Rica (Snarskis 1976); the Late Classic El Cajon sites, Honduras (Lentz 1989); and at two Early Classic sites in Panama: Cerro Punta (Smith 1980) and Pitti-Gonzcilez (Galinat 1980). By the time the Classic period was in full swing, this type of corn was in widespread use throughout Central America. Other corn remains from the Copan Valley were poorly preserved, consisting mostly of broken kernels and cupules. Artifact evidence for the

use of com at Copan in the form of mano and metate grinding stones was abundant (Spink 1988). It seems likely that com was at least one of the main staples at Copan, if not the main one. 
Carbonized beans (Phaseolus vulgaris) were recovered from three strata (Figure 4a). The discovery of this important cultivar was to be expected since it was under domestication in Peru by 5730 B.C. (Berglund-Briicher and Briicher 1976; Kaplan 1980) and in Mexico by 5000 B.C. (Kaplan 1965, 1967; Kaplan and MacNeish 1960). In other areas of Central America, beans were found in Preclassic 
(A.D. 200) deposits in Panama (Smith 1980) and in Classic period deposits in El Salvador (Zier 1980) and Honduras (Lentz 1989). One item of curiosity, a small (i.e., probably wild) Phaseolus seed was found in Operation 17. This wild bean could have been brought into the site by accident, but alternatively it may have indicated that elite Late Classic individuals were using wild beans as a source of food. 
The squash remains were items of exceptionally good preservation. Two squash ( Cucurbita mos­chata) seeds (Figure 3b) were found beneath Stela 63, which bears the inscription of Mah K'ina Yax K' uk' Mo' and a date of A.D. 435. The seeds were not carbonized but were preserved because they were imbedded in what looked like cinnabar, then rapidly sealed off by the placement of the stela. It seems reasonable to suggest that the seeds were placed there as part of some kind of offering. 
C. moschata has been found in Late Classic deposits elsewhere in Central America (Vestal 1938), but its occurrence is rare due to the fragile nature of the seeds and peduncles, the main diagnostic parts of this genus. Several rind fragments also were uncovered at Copan, but these could not be identified to species. 
Other cultivated cucurbits include chayote (Sechium edule) and bottle gourd (Lagenaria sp.). Chayote is a native food crop in Central America, and a small segment of a carbonized seed was found in Operation 33 (22-1). Gourds have been used in Central America, probably for centuries, in the manufacture of bottles, bowls, and other utensils, but the seeds most likely were used in prehistoric times for food as well (Cutler and Whitaker 1961). 
Remains of two palms (Acrocomia mexicana and Bactris sp.) were recovered from the Copan excavations. Carbonized endocarps of A. mexicana, locally referred to as coyol, were the most common remains of food plants in the valley (Figure 3c). Even though coyol endocarps are quite durable and are ubiquitous from the Bijac/ Ac bi transition through Coner phase deposits, there are none prior to the Bijac/ Acbi transition, which coincides with the hypothesized incursion of the Maya into the Copan Valley. Moreover, it seems quite possible that the Maya introduced the use of coyol into the valley or even introduced the plant itself. According to ethnographic accounts, the Maya eat fresh coyol kernels (Alcorn 1984) and make a drink from it (Roys 1931; Tozzer 1941). In many areas of Honduras, coyol wine is prepared using the sap of the palm (Balick 1990). Coyol may have been brought into the Copan Valley initially for a similar purpose, but when the food 
. supply became strained as a result of population growth during the Late Classic, people may have turned to coyol as a supplementary food source. "Nutting" stones, ostensibly used to crack open coyol fruits, were associated with Late Classic structures in the rural areas, e.g., Operation 36, at Ostuman, and in the central plaza of the Sepulturas section. 
In short, there is abundant evidence that coyol was used extensively, for whatever purpose, during 
the Late Classic period. Interestingly, Dahlin and Litzinger's (l 986) hypothesis about chultuns being 
used as fermentation pits by the Maya may bear some relevance to this discussion. In Operation 
15 of the Sepulturas section, a chultun was found to contain many fragments of coyol, the most 
common plant remain from the feature. It is conceivable that the chultun was used as a fermentation 
pit for making coyol wine. An alternative explanation, however, could be that the carbonized remains 
fell into or were deposited in the chultunafter it ceased to function for its originally intended purpose. 
Nevertheless, there is a co-occurrence with coyol, other plant remains (see Table l ), and the chultun. 
In any case, it seems clear that the Copan Maya were using coyol as were their contemporaries. in other parts of Mesoamerica. Coyolremains have been found as early as 4800 B.C. in the Tehuacan Valley (Smith 1967); in slightly more recent deposits in Chiriqui, Panama (Smith 1980); at Preclassic sites in Cerros, Belize (Cliff and Crane 1989; Crane 1986); at Preclassic sites in the El Cajon region, Honduras (Lentz 1989); the Late to Terminal Classic sites of Cerro Palenque, Honduras (Joyce 1985); and Colhci, Belize (Caldwell 1980). Indeed, coyol was used widely during prehistoric times

and was probably an important source of food, oil, and/or wine in ancient Mesoamerica (Lentz 1990). 
Evidence from a number of other tree fruits, i.e., ciruela (Spondias sp.) (Figure 3d), avocado (Persea americana), nance (Byrsonima crassifolia), and possibly zapote (Pouteria sp.) were found in Copan archaeobotanical samples. All of these were Maya cultivars (Berlin et al. 1974; Smith and Cameron 1977; Wisdom 1940) and were native to Mesoamerica (Williams 1981). These undoubtedly added a considerable dimension to the prehistoric agricultural capability. 
Several wild foods are represented in the archaeobotanical collection. Wild grape (Vitis sp.) was found in Operation 31 (Lot 102). A number of wild grapes e.g., V. tiliifolia, can be found in the valley today; they commonly grow in second growth on hillsides and have a sweet taste when ripe.

(b) Celtis sp. (hackberry) pit; (c) Pinus sp. (pine) charcoal; (d) Albizzia sp. charcoal. 
A hackberry (Ce/tis sp.) pit (Figure 4b) was found in Operation 17-1022 and may have come from 
C. iguanaea, a small tree that can produce considerable numbers of fruits and grows in mixed forests on dry hillsides (Standley and Steyermark 1945). The fruits are moderately palatable, but the pit is large in proportion to the rest of the fruit so the edible portion is limited. Another wild seed from the collection is Cassia sp., which compares to C. occidentalis (frijolillo). Frijolillo fruits are edible, and various parts of the plant have medicinal properties (Standley and Steyermark 1946). 
In addition to the economic species, there were also seeds from weedy species such as sedge (Scleria sp.), wild grass (Paspalum sp.), and carpetweed (Mollugo verticillata). These may have been brought into the site inadvertently or the plants may have been used as some kind of bedding or matting material. A few seeds listed on Table 1 were not carbonized, and these, except for the squash seeds, were undoubtedly intrusive, modern inclusions in the sample. 
MISSING SPECIES 
Although the foregoing discussion details a variety of plants exploited by the prehistoric Maya, it is possible that some plants that may have been used were not recovered because of poor pres­ervation or other factors such as cultural practices that would result in the destruction of identifiable plant components. There were some special circumstances such as the chultun, beneath Stela 63, burials, niches, and others where conditions were somewhat improved over the usual for an open site in the tropics, but in comparison to the southwestern United States or the west coast of Peru the preservation properties of the Copan Valley sites were not conducive to finding anything but carbonized plant remains.

crops, such as yam (Dioscorea trifida), manioc (Manihot esculenta), malanga (Xanthosoma sp.), and sweet potato (Jpomoea batatas). No archaeobotanical evidence for any of these was found at Copan, and the explanation may well involve poor preservation or the processing and consumption of recognizable parts. Material evidence for manioc processing, e.g., griddles or graters, was absent, so manioc-at least bitter manioc-was probably not used. A reliance on other root crops, however, remains a distinct possibility. 
Other potential cultivars such as peppers (Capsicum annuum), cotton (Gossypium spp.), and tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) were not identified, probably for the same reason. Turner et al. (1983) have suggested that a cotton pollen grain was found in Copan soil deposits, but the identification was extremely tentative. Although evidence for the use or production of tobacco was not found in Copan archaeological deposits, the valley has been used extensively for tobacco production during historic times and, therefore, it appears plausible that the prehistoric Maya may have taken advantage of the favorable growing conditions in the same manner. 
Cacao (Theobroma cacao) was an important crop to the Maya, and evidence for this cash/beverage crop has been found at Copan in the form of ceramic decorations (Longyear l 9S2). Other inves­tigators (Turner et al. 1983) claimed to have found carbonized cacao remains at Copan, but the author has not inspected these specimens. The Copan Maya could have grown cacao (it is sometimes grown in selected areas of the valley today), but it seems unlikely they grew it on a large scale. Millon (19SS, following Tozzer 1941) notes that early accounts from Honduras indicated that cacao production took place in the lower Ulua and Chamelecon valleys and on the Guatemala side, in the lower Motagua Valley. But at Copan, major commercial production of cacao seems doubtful because of the high elevation.As mentioned above, the floor of the valley is around 600 m and this is above the optimum range for cacao (Standley and Steyermark 1946). As a result, at Copan cacao may have been produced from small-scale local operations or may have been imported from other regions better suited for its production. 
Conspicuously absent from the Copan archaeobotanical collection was ramon (Brosimum ali­castrum). An astonishing number of articles have been written about the use of ramon by the prehistoric Maya, (e.g., Miksicek et al. 1981; Peters 1983; Puleston 1982), yet little in the way of direct archaeobotanical evidence has been found to support claims of its prehistoric use. Ramon was absent from the Copan deposits examined despite the durable nature of the ramon "nut," or seed, especially vis-a-vis com, beans, and squash, which were all preserved in the Copan archae­ological sediments. Therefore, the hypothesis of ramon as an important foodstuff for the Classic period Maya is not supported by the evidence from Copan. 
CHARCOAL 

Wood was the primary source of fuel in prehistoric times, and the charcoal remains from Copan 
provide a record of this activity. Pine (Figure 4c) is the most common type of charcoal but many 
examples of hardwood charcoal were recovered from the site as well. Leguminous trees are well 
represented with remains from Albizzia sp. (Figure 4d), Hymenea coubaril (Figure Sa), a tree that 
produces edible fruit, and several other species. Additional hardwoods represented include Masti­
chodendron capiri, Sapium sp. (Figure Sb), Ocotea sp. (Figure Sc), Vitex sp., and Quercus sp. A 
number of observations can be made about this collection of charcoal. The Quercus sp., an oak, 
undoubtedly came from the upland zone and may have been harvested along with the pine species. 
Most of the trees listed in Table 3 are successional or understory trees. An exception would be the 
Pouteria sp. from the Coner phase deposits. These trees, as upper-canopy forest dominants, can 
grow quite large, and the genus has many economically valuable species such as Pouteria mammosa, 
which has edible fruit widely consumed by the Maya (Berlin et al. 1974; Roys 1931; Tozzer 1941; 
Wisdom 1940). Cutting down a tree like this for firewood is, in some ways, the arboricultural 
equivalent of eating seed com. Under normal circumstances it would have made sense to spare 
these trees during forest clearance or when seeking firewood. 
Evidence for another large tree, Pterocarpus sp. (Figure Sd), was found in the Preclassic Gordon 
phase strata. Pterocarpus trees are upper-canopy dominants that would have been found only in

mature tropical deciduous forests. From this it follows that the bottomland forest still existed during the early phases of settlement, but evidence for it is lacking in later phases. This is consistent with the concept of bottomland forest clearance for agriculture in conjunction with population increases in the valley during the Classic period (Sanders 1989). 
Abrams and Rue (1988) have shown through elaborate calculations that the need for fuel greatly outweighed other needs for wood consumption. Pine/hardwood charcoal ratios compared by ubiq­uity (Figure 6) and average weight per volume of soil (Figure 7) clearly demonstrated that pine was the fuel of choice throughout all occupational phases. Consequently, greater demand was placed on the pine-oak forest to supply the necessary fuel. Pine predominates throughout all phases in middens, cooking areas, hearths, activity surfaces, and in construction collapse. It may have been a preferred wood for building construction as well, since it was the most common charcoal in post molds and construction collapse.

DISCUSSION 
Plant remains were retrieved from Coner phase residences of all status levels. Because of the limited sample size of status Types II and III, data from these households have been combined with status Type I samples for comparison to elite (Type IV) households. The diversity of food plants was compared between the two groups using the Shannon-Weaver index of diversity, and the results of the analysis are shown in Table 4. The Shannon-Weaver index (H) (after Popper 1988) can be calculated as follows: H -Sum (N/N)logE (N/N), where N total number of 
= = 
occurrences in the phase and Ni total number of occurrences of taxon j in the phase. 
= 
The high-status group had the highest index value (.52), while deposits from lower-status house­holds showed a lower value (.42). When Student's t test (see Magurran 1988) is applied to these data, the probability of obtaining the observed differences due to chance alone is only .07 (t = 1.83). If these calculated differences reflect reality, then the difference in the Shannon-Weaver index suggests a greater diversity of foods during Late Classic times for elite households. 
Dietary diversity can be a revealing factor in regard to nutrition. As long as caloric requirements are met, greater diversity in a diet generally improves the chances of including the full range of nutrients in ratios conducive to optimum health (Wing and Brown 1979). On the other hand, diets lacking diversity may rely on too few foods, so that even if calories are in good supply, nutritional needs may be unfulfilled. This is especially true for the mesoamerican diet, where the complementary effect of protein in corn and beans is lost if one or the other is in short supply (Kaplan 1973). Longyear (1952) noted that there was a marked reduction in nonelite male stature in Late Classic Copan populations, and inadequate nutrition is one of the leading explanations for this phenomenon. More recent osteological data from Copan indicate high levels of nutrition-related diseases among Late Classic populations (Rebecca Storey, personal communication 1990; Whittington 1989), and further study will determine if nutritional stress was equally prevalent at all levels of the social hierarchy. The social and overall health implications of a nutritional disparity are not insignificant during what have been described as times of social upheaval, environmental stress, and resource scarcity.

One potentially confounding factor with this analytical approach might be the differential pres­ervation at each of the sites, owing to the different nature of the construction techniques involved. House platforms for Type IV structures tend to have large amounts of lime mortar and plaster, which will eventually leach out and "sweeten" the adjacent soils and hence improve preservation. Type I structures, the remnants of which mainly consist of a house platform with one or two courses of masonry, are quite small and contain far less plaster and mortar. However, the Type II and III structures are intermediate in size and, in many cases, are located between Type IV households at Sepulturas. Therefore, it would be expected that preservation might be poorest at the rura1 Type I sites but should not be substantially worse at the Type III sites. This, however, was not the case. 
The data generated by the paleoethnobotanical study provide a starting point for discussion of theoretical models of Late Classic Maya agricultural systems and social structure maintenance. Numerous systems of agrotechnology have been hypothesized for the ancient Maya, but not all seem to fit the data from Copan. First of all, even though there has been some evidence for hydraulic agriculture in the Copan Valley (Schumann de Baudez 1983; Turner and Johnson 1979), it seems unlikely that there were extensive systems of raised fields, canals, or terraces. Little evidence for this has been obtained despite exhaustive searching for many years. 
Assuming an extensive hydraulic-agriculture hypothesis cannot be substantiated, it seems rea­sonable to suggest that cultigens represented in the Copan archaeobotanical collection were grown using some sort of swidden technique that was augmented by a form of arboriculture. Working with the Lacandon Maya of Chiapas, Nations and Nigh (1980) described the use of an acahual where fallow fields were exploited for their useful wild food plants and served as a source of forage for wild animals. This would have worked with some of the weedy species at Copan such as coyol and frijolillo that grow quickly and do well in second-growth situations. Other plants such as zapote, nance, ciruela, and avocado would not be suited to this kind of arrangement and would have required more planning to accommodate the long period of time necessary to allow the trees to grow and set fruit. In short, the acahual idea fits some of the archaeobotanical data but does not account for the full spectrum of economic species used at Copan.

Of the agrotechnologies discussed for Tikal (Santley et al. 1985), many, but not all, could have been employed at Copan. The use of a variety of tree fruits was in evidence as seen from Table l, and these may have been grown in mixed stands or monocultured orchards as was suggested for Tikal. Infield gardens, with tree fruits and annual crops such as squash or chayote grown adjacent to the house compound and fertilized with "night soil," seem like another probable arrangement. Modem Maya often grow their fruit trees in dooryard gardens, and these produce not only food but provide shade for the house compound. The outfield plots would have been located away from the house compounds and planted cyclically. The valley bottom consisting of fine alluvium could have been farmed intensively without fallow (Sanders 1989), but the upland areas had such poor soil they could only have been cultivated successfully on an intermittent basis, with planting episodes followed by fallow periods of varying duration. 
Certainly the Maya practiced arboriculture; the Copan archaeobotanical remains clearly show that several tree fruits were used and perhaps even introduced from other areas, e.g., coyol. Swidden techniques must have been employed since annual crops have been found. A hypothetical construct that fits the data best includes the following: ( 1) outfields grown extensively using swidden techniques with little fertilizer, (2) infields grown near house compounds and managed intensively, (3) orchards possibly grown in monoculture near homes but more likely grown with a diversity of other plants, and (4) permanent cropping practiced in the valley bottomlands . 
. The pattern of paleoethnobotanical remains from Copan seems to reflect the agricultural strategy described in historical accounts for other Maya groups (Marcus 1982). The outfields, or col, were essentially agricultural plots planted with mixtures of com, beans, squashes, and other annuals. During clearance useful trees might be spared in the col so that their products could continue to be used. Zapote trees, which grow as an integral part of the tropical deciduous forest, may have been treated in this manner by the Copan Maya. The infields, or pacal, were fruit trees planted in small orchard plots adjacent to the crowded residential units. Shade-tolerant species could have been grown on the floor of the orchard, so again monoculture was eschewed in favor of a diversified pattern of cultivation. In some ways this parallels the artificial rain-forest concept described by Wiseman (l 978) with the major exception that the artificial rain-forest arrangement at Copan probably produced only a portion of the agricultural product and not all as with Wiseman's model. The main caloric component for all status levels was undoubtedly supplied by the grain (com) production of the outfields and possibly also root crops. 
The advantage of this scheme was that it provided a varied and nutritional food source, it was more dependable since some of the crops would produce even in the worst of times and, consequently, it could have been developed into a stable agricultural system with sustainable yields as long as the outfields were given adequate fallow time. The orchards and dooryard gardens may have been farmed intensively with fertilization from household waste and the extensive fields planted with

annual crops could have been managed indefinitely if the fallow periods were not shortened exces­sively. However, during the height of the Late Classic demographic trend of the Copan polity, populations have been estimated as high as 25,000 (Webster and Freter 1990), which would have exceeded the calculated carrying capacity of the valley (Sanders 1989). In such a situation, inten­sification of the agricultural system probably included shortening the fallow cycle, which would have had disastrous effects in the piedmont zone and ultimately led to soil degradation, erosion, and a lowered carrying capacity, further straining an overtaxed agricultural system. 
CONCLUSIONS 
The Copan Maya were swidden agriculturists who relied on the traditional mesoamerican cultigens with the addition of an array of tree crops. A likely agrotechnological strategy would have been an infield-outfield system whereby annual crops were grown in extensive slash-and-bum plots that were periodically allowed to fallow. Certain segments of the flood plain may have been planted continuously, owing to the fertility of the deep alluvium, but the upland areas could only have been planted with any success on a cyclical basis. The tree and other crops may have been grown in infield orchards that were fertilized by household refuse. The food produced in Late Classic Copan was not evenly distributed among all social classes; the elite seem to have had a greater diversity available to them. Wood resources were mainly drawn from the upland pine-oak forest and the gradually shrinking remnants of the tropical deciduous forest. This preference may have become more pronounced during Late Classic times, because of presumed deforestation in the valley bottoms. 
On the basis of paleoethnobotanical and other data from Late Classic Copan, the picture that emerges is one of demographic, social, and ecological imbalance. Too many people occupied the valley, cleared forests for agriculture and wood resources, and truncated the fallow cycle for short­term gains. Adjustments in food-production potential were attempted by bringing marginally utilized foods, such as coyol, into greater use, and this may well have been an act of desperation. Production shortfalls could have been exacerbated by inequities in the distribution system where the elite may have had privileged access to foodstuffs and the commoners had less varied diets. Nutritional stress would likely have manifested itself in the general health of the polity, a development that must have strained the social fabric of the Copan Maya.
