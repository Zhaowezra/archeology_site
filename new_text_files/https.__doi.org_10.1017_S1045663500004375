
THE ECONOMY OF SUPPLY: MODELING OBSIDIAN 
PROCUREMENT AND CRAFT PROVISIONING AT A CENTRAL 
MEXICAN URBAN CENTER 

Kenneth G. Hirth 
This article examines the way that obsidian craftsmen at Xochicalco, Mexico obtained the raw material needed to produce prismatic blades at the site between A.D. 650 and 900. The paper models seven differ
ent forms of direct, indirect, and insti­tutional procurement that craftsmen could have used to obtain this obsidian. These seven procurement models are evalu­ated using two types of information collected from four domestic workshops: ( 1) source analysis (NAA, PJXE) to identify where obsidian came from, and (2) technological analysis to determine the form in which obsidian entered workshops. The results indicate that Xochicalco craftsmen most likely were provisioned through itinerant craftsmen who periodically vis­ited Xochicalco. Pressure cores nearing exhaustion were sold to Xochicalco craftsmen who rejuvenated them to produce additional prismatic blades using a hand-held blade removal technology. The results indicate that: ( 1) different forms of craft provisioning can he differentiated when multiple forms of data are incorporated into the distributional approach, (2) independent domestic crafi specialists were the foundation for Mesoamerican economy and were individually responsible for the procurement of raw materials and the distribution of finished products, and ( 3) neither state institutions, nor the elite who directed them, were involved in the procurement of obsidian for craft specialists who produced valued tools.

required the skill of specialized craftsmen to shape cores and remove blades (Clark 1982; Titmus and Clark 2003). Craft specialists involved in prismatic blade production first appeared in Central Mexico during the Early Formative period (1000 B.C.) (Boksenbaum et al. 1987; Cassiano and Alvarez 2005). Obsidian blades were used in a wide range of domestic, craft, and ritual activities, and the pro­duction technology spread throughout Mesoamer­ica during the Middle Formative period (900-500 B.C.). From this time onward, obsidian craft spe­cialists were permanent, indispensable members of Mesoamerican society. 
This article evaluates models of obsidian craft provisioning used in the manufacture of obsidian prismatic blades. Craft provisioning refers to the network through which craft specialists procured the raw material they used to produce prismatic blades. It is part of the broader distribution system through which raw materials and finished products moved in the prehispanic world. Craft provision­ing can be reconstructed using the distributional approach (Hirth 1998) and is important for two reasons. First, different forms of resource pro­curement affect the quantity of craft goods that arti­sans can produce. Second, obsidian craft production produces highly diagnostic lithic deb­itage, which, from a methodological perspective, allow archaeologists to reconstruct the type and tempo of manufacturing activities. 
Obsidian craft provisioning is examined for lithic workshops at Xochicalco, Mexico. Excava­tion of four domestic obsidian workshops provide a backdrop for evaluating the structure of obsidian procurement by craft specialists during the Epi­classic period (A.D. 650-900). Technological and source analyses are combined to evaluate seven alternative models of obsidian craft provisioning at this time. Because of the specialized nature of obsidian systems in Mesoamerica (Hirth 2006c:288), craft provisioning is only examined for the manufacture of prismatic blades. 
The discussion proceeds in several steps. It begins with a brief overview of Epiclassic obsid­ian systems and the nature of obsidian craft pro­duction at Xochicalco. This is followed by an examination of seven models of direct, indirect, and institutional craft provisioning along with the types of material remains we would expect them to produce. Finally, the empirical evidence from Xochicalco craft workshops is examined along with their implications for understanding the structure of obsidian craft provisioning in Central Mexico. 
Xochicalco and the Structure of 
Epiclassic Obsidian Systems 

Xochicalco was an important prehispanic political center that integrated much of western Morelos and eastern Guerrero into a large conquest state between A.D. 650--900 (Figure 1 ). Archaeological evidence indicates that Xochicalco had an urban population of between 10-15,000 persons with impressive civic-ceremonial architecture (Hirth 2000). Like other Central Mexican urban centers, residential densities were high (95-138 persons per square km) with a significant degree of resource provisioning taking place through a central mar­ketplace (Hirth 1998, 2000:Table 7.4; 2008). Evi­dence for obsidian craft production was identified at several locations within the site that were the focus of large scale excavations in 1992 and 1993 (Hirth 1995). 
During the Classic Period (A.D. 150-650) obsidian production and distribution systems in Central Mexico were dominated by Teotihuacan (Clark 1986; Santley 1983; Santley et al. 1986; Spence 1984, 1987). Evidence for large-scale obsidian production has been located at Teotihua­can (Spence 1987), although the number, compo­sition, and scale of these workshops remain unclear (Clark 1986).1 The two obsidian sources exploited at Teotihuacan were the local source of Otumba, Mexico, and the high-quality green obsidian from Sierra de las Navajas near Pachuca, Hidalgo (Spence et al. 1984) (Figure 2). Prismatic blades manufactured of Pachuca obsidian were widely distributed throughout Mesoamerica during the Classic period (Braswell 2003:Table 20.1; Sanders and Santley 1983), and several scholars have argued that Teotihuacan controlled this important resource through state-sponsored merchants (Sanders and Santley 1983; Santley 1983, 1984; Spence et al. 1984 ). Recent work in the Gulf Coast (Santley and Barrett 2002; Stark et al. 1992) reveals differential frequencies of obsidian from region to region as a result of complex, overlapping, and relatively inde­pendent obsidian distribution systems (Hirth 2006c). 
The decline of Teotihuacan coincides with dra-

matic changes in commercial obsidian networks after A.D. 600. Two things happened quite sud­denly. First, Teotihuacan ceased to be a major cen­ter for the production and consumption of green obsidian blades. Coincident with this was a decline in mining activity at the Sierra de las Navajas quarry (Pastrana 2004). Not only did Teotihuacan no longer exploit the source, but local utilization waned (Garcia Chavez et al. 1990). Second, Pachuca obsidian decreased in frequency and 

declined in circulation for several hundred years during which time other obsidian sources filled the demand for obsidian blades (Garcia Chavez 1990; Healan 2003:153-154; Santley Kerley and Barrett 1995:479). Chief among these in Central Mexico was the obsidian source of Ucareo, Michoacan whose mines provided material for the manufac­ture of prismatic blades distributed across a large part of Mesoamerica (Healan 1993, 1997:Table 1; Braswell 2003:Table 20.1). 
Obsidian systems changed markedly across Central Mexico during the Epiclassic period. An obsidian system is defined in physical terms by the spatial distribution of obsidian and obsidian tools from a specific source. In behavioral terms an obsid­ian system represents the socioeconomic relation­ships involved in mining raw material, producing finished tools, and distributing them to their final consumers (Hirth 2006c:288). During the Epiclas­sic period obsidian systems expanded and a vari­ety of sources were used to compensate for the reduced availability of Pachuca obsidian (Hirth, Bondar, Glascock, Vonarx, and Daubensbach 2006). Otumba obsidian continued to be used for biface production (Nelson 2000) along with obsid­ian from Tulancingo, Hidalgo (Gaxiola Gonzalez and Guevera 1989). Ucareo, Michoacan became a primary supplier of obsidian for prismatic blades (Garcia Chavez et al. 1990; Healan 1997) along with Zacualtipan, Hidalgo (Hirth, Bandar, Glas­cock, Vonarx, and Daubensbach 2006) and Oyame­les, Puebla (Garcia Cook 2003; Stark et al. 1992). 
At Xochicalco prismatic blades were produced of obsidian from three sources: Ucareo in Michoa­can, and Zacualtipan and Pachuca in Hidalgo. 2 Bifaces at Xochicalco occur primarily in Tulancingo and Otumba obsidian, although a few bifaces were also manufactured of Ucareo and Zacualtipan obsidian (Hirth, Bandar, Glascock, Vonarx, and Daubensbach 2006:Table 5.4). The demand for obsidian tools at Xochicalco was high. The problem was that obsidian does not outcrop close to the site (Figure 2). Otumba is the closest obsidian source located 110 km northeast ofXochi­calco. The primary sources used for prismatic blade production, however, were Ucareo, Zacualtipan, and Pachuca that range from 155-210 km away (Figure 2). The challenge for Xochicalco craftsmen was how to acquire enough raw material to meet the demand for obsidian tools both within the city . and throughout its surrounding region. It is this

question that lies at the center of this investigation. 
Obsidian Craft Production at Xochicalco 

In 1993 extensive excavations by the Xochicalco Lithics Project explored obsidian craft production in four domestic workshops (Operations A, H, I, and K) and one market workshop (Operation G) (Figure 3). This study focuses on the information recovered from the four domestic workshops. It was here that outstanding preservation permitted the collection oflarge samples of obsidian debitage from primary production contexts. 
Excellent preservation at Xochicalco was the result of the site's rapid destruction by military con­quest sometime around A.D. 850-900 (Gonzalez Crespo et al. 1995; Hirth and Cyphers 1988; Noguera 1945; Saenz 1962, 1964). The attack destroyed residential structures and trapped domes­tic assemblages on floors when houses were burned (Hirth and Webb 2006). In the four domestic work­shops, this resulted in the entrapment of obsidian debris directly on the floors where production was carried out. Artifact deposition as a result of con­quest also has been recorded in the Maya Petex­batun resulting in the abandonment of material assemblages directly on structure floors atAguateca (Inomata 1997, 2003). Although the rapid deposi­tion of artifacts known as the Pompeii effect is rare in archaeology (Binford 1981 ), it is welcomed where it is found. At Xochicalco it permitted a robust reconstruction of domestic obsidian craft production that usually cannot be carried out (Schif­fer 1985). 
The four excavated domestic workshops are illustrated in Figure 3. Three of these (Operations H, I, and K) were located on the slopes of Cerro Xochicalco and were well preserved. The fourth (Operation A) was located outside of the protected

archaeological zone and most of its residential architecture was destroyed by tractor plowing prior to excavation. The three well-preserved domestic workshops were multifamily residential com­pounds containing 2-3 interior patios and 210-348 sq m of interior space. Analysis revealed that obsid­ian craft production was carried out in interior patios and special ateliers adjacent to the residence (Hirth 2006a). The identification of obsidian pro­duction inside residential structures was unantici­pated because we believed that artisans would have kept hazardous lithic waste away from household residents (Santley and Kneebone 1993).3 Surpris­ingly, this was not the case. Instead, artisans worked inside the residence and employed strategies to keep hazardous waste at tolerable levels. 
One of these strategies was to collect and remove the largest and most dangerous pieces of debitage from production areas. Another was to confine pro­duction to small areas within the house and then sweep debitage against walls or collect it in con­tainers for later disposal (Hirth 2006a) as has been reported among Lacandon knappers (Clark 1991 a, 1991 b ). Both of these strategies, however, were imperfect solutions since many small flakes remained on floors where they could be stepped on, knelt on, or picked up in sandals or clothing. It is clear that residents of Xochicalco' s domestic work­shops learned to live with and manage small amounts of obsidian waste created by obsidian craft production. 
Analysis provided information on two dimen­sions of how work was organized in domestic work­shops. First, each workshop had multiple craftsmen working in them. The size of residential compounds suggests that each domestic workshop had 3-5 able-bodied individuals involved in craft produc­tion. This would be expected given the Mesoamer­ican practice of training children in the economic pursuits of their parents. Since we know from eth-

nohistoric sources that obsidian craft activity was a male pursuit, we can infer that these were crafts­men in a gender accurate sense. The presence of multiple work areas within residential compounds confirms that 2-3 craftsmen actively engaged in blade production at the same time. This represents a significant production capacity if craftsmen pro­duced blades on a continuous basis. They appar­ently did not. A comparison of the number of obsidian cores reduced, to the number of work areas simultaneously in operation, indicates that all craftsmen in domestic workshops were part-time specialists (Hirth and Andrews 2006). 
Second, there is no evidence for an internal divi­sion of labor within domestic workshops. Instead, the same work was carried out in all work areas and there was no evidence for task specialization or the sequential linkage of production tasks (Car­rier 1992; Torrence 1986) within or between domestic workshops. Even though specialized ate­liers were found in two of the three well-preserved workshops (Operations H and I), work there did not segment or streamline the production process. 
Modeling Obsidian Resource Procurement 
The main question of interest here is how, and in what form, did craftsmen at Xochicalco obtain the obsidian they used to produce prismatic blades? As mentioned above, the obsidian used for prismatic blades at Xochicalco came from sources 155-210 km away (Figure 2). These distances created poten­tial provisioning problems for obsidian craftsmen because the level of blade production directly depended on the quantity of raw material that domestic workshops could access. Maintaining access to a consistent supply of obsidian was fun­damental for the artisans producing blades for Xochicalco and its surrounding region. 
Any reconstruction of obsidian resource pro­curement needs to examine two important ques­tions (Spence et al. 1984 ). First, how was procurement structured in organizational terms? Did it involve direct trips by craftsmen to source areas, or was obsidian procured from merchant intermediaries or itinerant craftsmen? Second, were corporate strategies used to obtain and transport obsidian? This question is important because it addresses whether workshops obtained their obsid­ian independently of one another, or depended on the state or other centralized institutions for obsid­ian provisioning. 
These two questions are examined below by evaluating three groups of craft provisioning mod­els: direct, indirect, and institutional procurement. Each of these provisioning strategies contain two or more alternative ways that procurement could be organized. Seven distinct procurement models are identified within these three groups that would have affected the form, type, and quantity of raw 
material entering workshops in different ways .. Because flaked stone production is a reductive process, these forms of procurement can be mod­eled in terms of both the type of obsidian obtained and the manufacturing debitage expected to be recovered in production contexts. Each of these seven procurement models are discussed below. 
Direct procurement refers to craftsmen obtain­ing raw material from obsidian source areas through direct visitation and independent exploitation (Fig­ure 4 ). Two specific models, quarry visitation and quarry visitation with itinerant production, are eval­uated as alternative types of direct procurement. Indirect procurement refers to the reliance on trade intermediaries to obtain raw material (Figure 4). Three models of indirect procurement are exam­ined in this group: specialized obsidian trade. unspecialized obsidian trade, and itinerant crafts­men provisioning. Institutional procurement 
involves the use of centralized, corporate strategies to obtain raw material (Figure 4 ). Procurement here is undertaken by a sponsoring agent, agency, or institutional body resulting in the centralized col­lection of raw materials that are shared out to the artisans who used them. Two models of institu­tional procurement are examined here: centralized political procurement and corporate calpulli pro­visioning. 
The Direct Procurement Models 
Direct procurement was the primary way that mobile hunter and gatherers obtained raw material from source deposits (Binford 1979:260--261; lng­bar 1994; Morrow and Jefferies 1989). In seden­tary groups knappers often made special trips to obtain workable stone. This could restrict the move­ment of raw material over space unless it could be transported by boat as it was in the eastern Aegean (Mackenzie 1904; Torrence 1986: 100, Fig. 20).

Quarry Visitation 
The quarry visitation model assumes that Xochi­calco craftsmen traveled directly to source areas to obtain the obsidian that they worked. The costs involved would include traveling to the source area, mining the obsidian, processing it into core pre­forms for blade reduction, and transporting them back to Xochicalco. A variant of this model would be for Xochicalco craftsmen to travel to source areas and purchase percussion cores from local craftsmen. This could occur if access to obsidian deposits was restricted. Although little is known about the nature of prehistoric resource ownership (Clark 1989), evidence for exclusionary control of stone sources can be found among Australian abo­rigines (Thomson 1949:65, 87; McBryde and Har­rison 1981: 191, 194 ), New Guinea tribesmen (Hughes 1977:144; Strathern 1965:189-190; Tor­rence 1986; Vial 1940: 159), and in archaeological settings in the Valley of Guatemala (Hurtado de Mendoza 1977; Michels 1979:57-59, 1982). 
Direct quarry visitation would have had two advantages for Xochicalco craftsmen. First, crafts­men would have access to both large quantities and a wider selection of stone to shape obsidian cores. Second, visits to source areas would have provided opportunities for apprenticeship and training not available at Xochicalco because of limited raw material. High transportation costs would have made polyhedral percussion cores the preferred form of moving obsidian over space. The reason for this is energetic. Obsidian weighs 2.5 kg/liter and moving obsidian as preformed cores maxi­mized the amount of usable stone that could be transported by human porters. These factors result in two measurable predictions for this model: (1) that the obsidian used for blade production would enter Xochicalco workshops as large, unused poly­hedral cores, and (2) that all the obsidian in each workshop would originate from one source, namely the source that craftsmen chose to exploit (Table 1). It is possible, of course, that craftsmen might visit more than one source if obsidian of different locales differed in workability. Since high-quality obsidian is required for blade production, it is assumed that this obsidian could meet anticipated production needs for all the artifacts produced. 4 
Quarry Visitation with Itinerant Production 

This model portrays artisans as itinerant craftsmen who obtained obsidian at the source and then returned to Xochicalco producing prismatic blades for groups along their return route. This form of provisioning would have had three advantages for Xochicalco craftsmen. First, it would have defrayed the costs of direct provisioning as craftsmen could exchange prismatic blades for other goods on their return trip. Second, the production and sale of obsidian blades on their return would have pro­vided ready access to goods along trade routes lead-

ing back to Xochicalco. Third, this form of pro­curement would have widened the number of con­sumers that they could sell to. 
While this model is logistically feasible, it poses several challenges that craftsmen would need to resolve. One problem is that itinerant production during the return trip would have lowered the amount of raw material available for blade pro­duction at Xochicalco. Likewise, the opportunity to obtain goods from the Tierra Fria where sources are located would have been limited by the amount of additional weight that craftsmen could have added to their already heavy loads of obsidian. Third and finally, this practice could create sched­uling problems since the more artisans operated as itinerant craftsmen, the more often they would have needed to visit the source. 
The expectations of this model are similar to those of direct procurement with a few modifica­tions. Like quarry visitation, this model assumes that craftsmen obtained their obsidian at the source as large percussion cores. The production of obsid­ian blades during their return meant that some obsidian cores would have entered the site as already used and partially reduced pressure cores. Source variability would still be low unless crafts­men traveled between several sources as part of their itinerant travels. For this to occur, itinerant crafting would have to be a primary focus ofXochi­calco obsidian craft production (Table 1 ).

The Indirect Procurement Models 
Trade was a powerful mechanism in prehispanic society with Jong-distance exchange networks operating throughout Mesoamerica from 1000 B.C. onward. Obsidian was one of the items that moved along interregional trade routes (Cobean et al. 1971, 1991; Clark 1989; Pires-Ferreira 1975, 1976). Although exchange mechanisms changed over time, by the Epiclassic period specialized traders and full-time merchants were a regular fixture of the commercial landscape. Indirect procurement models assume that Xochicalco craftsmen did not go to the source areas themselves, but relied on intermediaries such as merchants or itinerant crafts­men to supply them with obsidian. 
Specialized and Unspecialized Obsidian Trade 
Provisioning through merchants could have taken two forms: specialized and unspecialized trade. Specialized trade would have involved provision­ing by merchants who engaged in obsidian trade on a full-time basis. These merchants would have supplied craftsmen with obsidian cores obtained directly from source areas and would have oper­ated like the oztomeca or pochteca described by eth­nohistoric sources. Conversely, unspecialized trade would have involved peddlers who purchased items in wholesale lots and stockpiled them for resale when the opportunity arose. Sahagun (1961 :9 1)

refers to these peddlers as tlacocoalnamacac and identifies knives and needles as some of the items that they sold. While we do not know if these were obsidian knives, Katz ( 1966:67) believes that they were. 
The important difference between these two types of provisioning is that procurement through peddlers would be more sporadic and would involve a lower volume of raw material than pro­visioning through specialized merchants. Unspe­cialized provisioning would have involved partially or completely exhausted obsidian cores that ped­dlers obtained as secondary goods from craftsmen willing to sell them. This model would be reflected by indirect contact with source areas, variability in the sources represented depending on the number of peddlers involved and where they obtained obsidian for resale, and procurement of obsidian as already worked or exhausted pressure cores. Specialized trade, on the other hand, would more strongly resemble forms of direct procurement. Specialized merchants would traffic in polyhedral cores obtained directly from the source, with some variation expected if merchants exploited different sources or visited more than one quarry (Table I). 
Itinerant Craftsmen Provisioning 
This model assumes that obsidian at Xochicalco was supplied by nonlocal itinerant craftsmen who brought obsidian with them into the region. The obsidian supplied by itinerant craftsmen would consist entirely of used and exhausted pressure cores (Table I) that could only be used by artisans who possessed a technology suitable for working small cores (Hirth, Andrews, and Flenniken 2006; Flenniken and Hirth 2003). Although itinerant craftsmen were competitors with local artisans, they would still have been welcomed at Xochicalco because they supplied a source of obsidian that local craftsmen needed for their craft. This rela­tionship also would have been advantageous to itin­erant craftsmen because it provided them both with reliable trading partners in a distant region (Heider I 969) and a place to profitably dispose of obsidian cores at the end of their use-lives. 
I have suggested elsewhere (Hirth, Bondar, Glascock, Vonarx, and Daubensbach 2006) that itinerant crafting was a primary way that popula­tions in Central Mexico were supplied with obsid­ian blades. Ethnohistoric sources suggest that obsidian craftsmen were mobile and moved from marketplace to marketplace producing and selling their products. Tax records record the presence of obsidian workers from the town of Izquiteca in the Coyoacan market (Anderson et al. 1976: I 49) who probably were itinerant craftsmen (Hirth, Bondar, Glascock, Vonarx, and Daubenspeck 2006:134). Itinerant obsidian crafting seems to have been a fea­ture of the Postclassic landscape in Central Mex­ico (cf Norris 2002; Parry 2002) and may have been the primary way that craftsmen in urban areas were linked to obsidian sources (Hirth and Andrews 2002). 
Institutional Procurement 
This model examines whether corporate procure­ment strategies were used to obtain raw material. The direct and indirect provisioning models assume that artisans provisioned themselves independently of one another. Because distances to obsidian sources were significant (Figure 2), it raises the question of whether households could effectively provision themselves without some sort of institu­tional assistance. Institutional models assume that assistance was necessary and that obsidian pro­curement was organized through social institutions at the state and/or community level. 
Several researchers have suggested that cen­tralized control of resources was important in the political economies of chiefdom and early state societies (Brumfiel and Earle 1987; Clark I 987; Millon 1973:45--46). In Central Mexico the cen­tralized control of obsidian has been argued to be the foundation for a commercial empire under the control ofTeotihuacan (Sanders and Santley 1983; Santley 1983 :70, 1984; Santley et al. 1986). Spence, Kimberlin and Harbottle ( 1984) proposed that the procurement of Pachuca obsidian was directly controlled by the Teotihuacan state. Since most of the evidence for obsidian production is found at large urban centers like Teotihuacan (Car­ballo 2005; Nelson 2000; Spence 1984, 1987), Tula (Healan 1986, 2003; Healan et al. 1983), and Can­tona (Garcia Cook 2003), it is logical to associate obsidian procurement with state activities. 
Actually, several models can be proposed for centralized institutional obsidian procurement. Two are identified here: centralized political procure­ment and corporate calpulli provisioning. Central-

ized political procurement is associated with the mobilization of obsidian through tribute payments (Pastrana 1991, 2004), state administered trade (Polanyi 1957), or generalized political control (Sanders and Santley 1983). But institutional pro­visioning could also be organized through nonpo­litical, social means. Corporate calpulli provisioning represents one such example where members of craft guilds could undertake joint expe­ditions to source areas to obtain obsidian. A major feature of all forms of centralized, institutional pro­curement is the corporate redistribution of raw mate­rial. Because centralized procurement is a form of direct procurement, there normally should be only one obsidian source represented in the sample unless multiple sources were exploited for different pur­poses as was the case at Teotihuacan where Pachuca obsidian was preferred for blade production and Otumba obsidian was used for biface manufacture (Spence 1967). Furthermore, because obsidian was procured corporately, all cooperating workshops should have had access to the same sources of obsid­ian. The corporate distribution of obsidian should produce homogeneity in the sources found from workshop to workshop (Table 1). 
Evaluating the Evidence: Centralized or 
Independent Procurement 

The test of any model is how accurately it conforms to the data recovered. While many models in archaeology are derived inductively, formal mod­eling requires evaluating alternative frameworks to identify the best fit to the data. The provisioning models presented above provide alternative ways that Xochicalco craftsmen could have obtained obsidian. Identifying which of these models fit the data best is the task I tum to now. 
Provisioning strategies are adaptations to cir­cumstances of convenience and necessity, and one important question is whether craft provisioning employed independent or centralized procurement strategies. Independent provisioning involves the procurement of obsidian by the units of production that used them, in this case individual domestic workshops. Centralized (Institutional) procure­ment, on the other hand, collects raw material at levels above and for the units of production that use them. Independent resource procurement usually develops when raw material is readily available, needed infrequently, or where transportation costs are low. Conversely, centralized procurement may be preferred when transportation or extraction costs are high, where the political landscape is unsafe, or where access to raw material is restricted (Costin 1991). 
Independent and centralized procurement can be differentiated from one another by the type, fonn, and quantity of obsidian recovered in workshop contexts. All other things being equal, the hetero­geneity of obsidian assemblages will be directly 

· 
proportional to the number of sources, trade routes, or networks used to provision production units (Hirth, Bondar, Glascock, Vonarx, and Dauben­speck 2006: 128). Centralized provisioning should produce uniformity in the numbers and types of obsidian sources worked in craft workshops and the form in which obsidian entered the site. Moreover, if obsidian is centrally procured and shared out to participating workshops, then workshops assem­blages should be relatively homogenous and sim­ilar to one another in the types of obsidian being worked. However, if domestic workshops obtained their obsidian independently of one another through household procurement systems, then there is a greater probability of increased inter-workshop variation between workshop assemblages (Pires­Ferreira and Flannery 1976; Winter and Pires­Ferreira 1976). Of course, inter-workshop variation can be low even under conditions of independent procurement if all production units are exploiting the same source. But when inter-workshop varia­tion is high, there is a greater probability that inde­pendent, rather than centralized forms of procurement, were practiced. 
Table 2 summarizes the relative frequency of obsidian sources found in the four domestic work­shops at Xochicalco. Source identifications were made using two techniques. Visual inspection was used to identify green obsidian from Pachuca, Hidalgo. Source identifications of grey obsidian representing the bulk of the collection were made using neutron activation analysis (NAA) conducted at the the Missouri University Research Reactor and Penn State University Breazeale Reactor. The results of these analyses are summarized elsewhere (Hirth, Bondar, Glascock, Vonarx, and Daubens­bach 2006). It was expected that if centralized pro­visioning was used, then all domestic workshops should have the same types of obsidian in similar

proportions in their production assemblages. Con­versely, if they provisioned themselves indepen­dently of one another, then considerable variation could be expected from workshop to workshop 
The data reveal considerable variation in the types of obsidian recovered in the four workshops. Since all four workshops were abandoned simul­taneously when Xochicalco was destroyed (Hirth and Webb 2006), there is solid foundation for inter­preting this variation as the product of independent procurement practices. Two of the domestic work­shops, Operations A and I, have nearly identical percentages of the same obsidian, relying on U careo for over 92 percent of their obsidian needs (Table 2). In both these workshops green Pachuca obsidian was rare and grey obsidian from Zacualti­pan, Otumba, and Tulancingo was absent, or pre­sent in only small amounts (<5-6 percent). 
A very different pattern was found in Operations H and K. Operation H was the only workshop at Xochicalco where the majority of the obsidian recovered was not from Ucareo. Instead, most of the obsidian used for blade production at Opera­tion H was from Zacualtipan (54.4 percent), fol­lowed by Pachuca (24.8 percent), and then Ucareo 
(18.6 percent) (Table 2). Operation K has a mix of obsidian sources intermediate between Operation H and the other workshops. Both Zacualtipan (26.0 percent) and Pachuca (7. l percent) obsidian occur in Operation K but in lower frequency than Oper­ation H. Like workshops A and I, Ucareo obsidian was the dominant source ( 61.3 percent) represented at the Operation K (Table 2). 

Source analysis reveals considerable variability in the obsidian sources recovered in domestic work­shops. What this variability indicates is that a cen­tralized procurement strategy was not employed to obtain obsidian for obsidian workshops. If it had been, all four workshops would have obsidian from the same sources in similar percentages. This vari­ability effectively eliminates two forms of central­ized craft provisioning at Xochicalco: (l) centralized political procurement of obsidian by the state with redistribution to domestic workshops, and (2) cooperative calpulli provisioning by craft guilds with centralized share-out to their corre­sponding members.5 Both forms of craft provi­sioning would produce similarity in the type of obsidian available to, and worked in, domestic workshops. Although the Operation A and I work­shops had access to the same obsidian in the same proportions, they were located too far apart ( 1.5 km) to lie within the same neighborhood calpulli. That workshops differ significantly in types of obsidian

that they used implies that they were provisioned through independent rather than centralized pro­curement strategies. 
Evaluating Independent Procurement: 
Technological Criteria 

The development of independent provisioning net­works would have been a challenging but vital task because obsidian supply would have dictated the scale and intensity of domestic craft production. All of the direct and indirect procurement models dis­cussed above are strategies that involve indepen­dent provisioning. Fortunately, each of these models can be operationalized and tested using technological analyses of workshop debitage. Tech­nological analysis identifies production byproducts and their position within the reduction sequence. Since each form of obsidian procurement would have provided cores at different stages of the reduc­tion sequence, technological analysis provides a high-precision means of identifying provisioning strategies. 
The main focus of obsidian craft production at Xochicalco was the manufacture of obsidian pris­matic blades. Figures 5-7 illustrate an idealized reduction sequence for prismatic blade production, beginning from raw material and ending with an exhausted pressure core that has undergone one rejuvenation episode. This production sequence can be broken down into three broad stages. The first stage begins with raw material and focuses on shaping the polyhedral core using percussion tech­niques. The first stage in this process involves the production of a macrocore that is transformed into a polyhedral core through the removal of smaller and narrower percussion blades. The diagnostic debitage produced from shaping a percussion core include platform preparation flakes, decortication flakes, macroflakes, macroblades, and small per­cussion blades (Figure 5). 
The second stage involves transforming the polyhedral core into a pressure core through the removal of narrow blades using pressure tech­niques. Once a pressure core is fashioned, long par­allel (third series) blades were produced until the core could no longer be used. The diagnostic pres­sure artifacts produced during this second stage include irregular (first, second series) pressure blades, finished (third series) pressure blades, and error correction debitage produced to keep the core in production (Figure 6). 
The third stage involves a full core rejuvenation employing both percussion and pressure tech­niques. The diagnostic percussion debitage pro­duced from a full core rejuvenation include platform removal flakes, platform preparation flakes, and distal orientation flakes. Pressure deb­itage includes rejuvenated core blades (RC-firstJ and subsequent finished blades referred to here a fourth series blades. Besides being shorter, the main criteria that distinguishes fourth series blades from earlier third series blades at Xochicalco is the pres­ence of a new pecked and ground platform prepared on cores during rejuvenation. Exhausted, frag­mented, and recycled cores represent the end of the production sequence (Figure 7). 
Table 3 summarizes the core reduction sequence and diagnostic byproducts that would be associated with the five direct and indirect procurement strate­gies. All the available evidence indicates that by the Epiclassic the obsidian used to manufacture pris­matic blades circulated throughout Mesoamerica as preformed cores (Hirth and Andrews 2002). As discussed above, if craftsmen obtained their obsid­ian through quarry visitation, then obsidian from that source should have entered workshops as large percussion cores. If this was the case, then domes­tic workshops should have production debris from the final shaping of polyhedral cores (e.g., small percussion blades) and their transformation into pressure cores (i.e., irregular pressure blades). The same would be true if craftsmen practiced quarn· visitation with itinerant production with several modifications. First, because craftsmen produced blades from cores during their return trip, it is likely that they would have prepared them as polyhedral cores ready for pressure reduction as the need arose. Second, because prismatic blades were produced while en route to Xochicalco, some of the cores would have entered the site as already used pres­sure cores. Nevertheless, itinerant craftsmen would still have returned with some unused polyhedral cores to meet local demand for large obsidian blades. In this case, small percussion and irregular pressure blades would be present in lower fre­quencies in workshop deposits than would be the case with direct quarry visitation. 
Forms of indirect procurement would also have different technological signatures (Table 3). Pro-

curement of obsidian through trade could involve either specialized merchants who traded percussion cores obtained directly from the source, or unspe­cialized peddlers who purchased exhausted cores and then resold them. Specialized merchant trade would look similar to direct quarry visitation except that more variation would be possible if merchants used obsidian from different sources. Unspecial­ized peddler trade would have a very different tech­nological signature since they would be selling used and/or exhausted pressure cores. In this case no irregular pressure blade debitage would be found in workshop deposits supplied by peddlers, although rejuvenation debitage would be abundant. Variability in obsidian sources could also be expected since peddlers could obtain used obsid­ian cores from craftsmen with access to different sources (Table 1 ). 

Itinerant craftsmen provisioning differs from unspecialized trade with peddlers in that obsidian suppliers were also craftsmen who produced pris­matic blades. Itinerant craftsmen would only have been a source for exhausted pressure cores no longer of use to them. When a core is exhausted depends, of course, on the technology used to reduce it. At Xochicalco craftsmen employed a hand-held reduction strategy that allowed them to rejuvenate cores and keep them in production much longer than when only a foot-held strategy was used (Flenniken and Hirth 2003).

sure blades should be found with itinerant crafts­men provisioning and the number of pressure blades removed from each core should be limited. Instead, pressure cores would be rejuvenated soon after they enter the workshops and most prismatic blades should be manufactured from rejuvenated obsidian cores. At Xochicalco these rejuvenated core pressure blades (fourth series) would have pecked and ground platforms and would be shorter and narrower than those produced before core reju­venation (Table 3). 
Production Evidence from 
Xochicalco Domestic Workshops 

Technological analysis was undertaken for each of 
the four domestic workshops at Xochicalco. The results are summarized in Table 4. The materials analyzed were obtained directly from production surfaces and midden deposits and provide a good picture of production activities carried out in work­shop contexts. 
One important result of this analysis was the absence of production debris from large core reduc­tion. No macroblades and very few small percus­sion blades and irregular pressure blades were found in any domestic workshop. Lithic experi­ments (Clark 1986, 1988) and empirical archaeo­logical research (Clark and Bryant 1997:Table l; Healan 1986:Table 2) confirm that small percus­sion blades and irregular pressure blades should be found in large numbers where polyhedral cores are

shaped and transfonned into pressure cores. This did not occur in domestic workshops at Xochi­calco. Instead, the results indicate that obsidian entered workshops as already shaped and used pres­sure cores. Furthennore, the few small percussion and irregular pressure blades recovered from the four workshops are blade fragments that could have been produced while repairing errors on pressure cores. 
The absence of core shaping debris indicates that domestic workshops did not have access to cores coming directly from quarries. These results do not confonn with those expected for either of the two direct procurement models involving quarry visi­tation. They also contradict the expectations of spe­cialized merchant trade. All three of these models assume that craftsmen obtained and reduced large polyhedral cores within domestic workshops. The empirical evidence indicates instead that Xochi­calco craftsmen were provisioned through one of the indirect fonns of procurement, either trade with unspecialized peddlers or itinerant craftsmen. 
Distinguishing between these two fonns of craft provisioning is based on the evidence for how pres­sure cores were handled after they entered Xochi­calco. While I believe that unspecialized peddlers would have been too unreliable for obsidian pro­visioning, it still needs to be considered as a pos­sibility. As discussed above, unspecialized peddler trade probably would have provided pressure cores ranging from partially used, to exhausted cores. Partially used cores would have been preferred because more prismatic blades could be produced before cores required rejuvenation. In contrast, pro­visioning through itinerant craftsmen would have only supplied exhausted cores. This distinction is
