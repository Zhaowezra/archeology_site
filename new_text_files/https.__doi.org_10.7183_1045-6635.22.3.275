
SOCIAL IMPLICATIONS FROM AGRICULTURAL TASKSCAPES IN 
THE SOUTHWESTERN AMAZON 
John H. Walker 
Across the Americas, but particularly in the Amazon Basin. precolumbianfarmers invested their labor in.features such as canals, causeways, and raised fields, creating agricultural landscapes. These landscapes required organized action in order to build and maintain them. Such actions can be usefully described as "tasks" to draw specific connections between com­munal work and landscape features (In[!, old 1993). Us in[!, two parallel examples from the precolumbian Bolivian Amazon, this article presents landscape features as correlates of the variety and scale of tasks that compose the processes of creat­ing and managing them. Data come from remote sensing and pedestrian survey. The execution of some tasks affects the exe­cution of others, meanin[!, that landscapes are the result of overlappin[!,, interdependent communal tasks. This taskscape perspective allows landscapes to be compared with greater precision and shows that details of local spatial and task orga­nization are important to understandin[!, a?,ricultural change. The comparison of two taskscapes reveals details of daily life and intensive agriculture that are obscured by the classification of societies as states or chiefdoms. 
A tra1•es de las Americas, pero particularmente en la cuenca Amazonica, los agricultores precolombinos invirtieron su trabajo en rasgos como canales, terraplenes y campos elevados. creando paisajes agrfcolas. Estos paisajes requirieron de acciones organizadas para su construccion y mantenimiento. Estas acciones pueden ser descritas utilmente coma "tareas" para ras­trear conexiones especificas entre !areas comunales y rasgos del paisaje (Ingold 1993). Usando dos ejemplos paralelos de la Amamnio Boliviana precolombina, este art{culo presenta rasgos def paisaje como indicadores de la variedad y escala de las tareas que comprenden los procesos de crearlos y manejarlos. Los datos relacionados al paisaje provienen de la teledetec­ci<5n y de un trabajo de reconocimiento pedestre. La ejecucion de algunas tareas afecta la realizacion de otras. lo que significa que los paisajes son el resultado de tareas comunales interdependientes que se sobreponen. Esta perspectiva de las tareas para producir paisajes (taskscape) permite comparar los paisajes con mas precision y muestra que los detalles de la organi­zaci6n local, espacial y de las tareas son esenciales para entender el cambio agrfcola. La comparacion de dos "taskscapes" revela detalles de la vida cotidiana y de la agricultura intensiva que son oscurecidos por la clasificaci6n de las sociedades comu estados o cacicazgos.

well-tested recipe in American archaeol­Aogy is to start at a regional scale and inter­pret settlement patterns using models of political or economic organization. These power­ful models draw on universal theories from outside archaeology: central place theory, optimal forag­ing theory, or definition of a site hierarchy (Anschuetz et al. 200 1 ). Most approaches define "sites," and having located them, analyze sites and their patterns through time and across space (Dun­nell 1992; Kowalewski 2008). This kind of spatial pattern is a main ingredient in the definition of evo­lutionary categories such as state and chiefdom, and spatial patterns have been defined in the Viru Val­ley, the Mississippi Valley, the Valley of Mexico, and around the world. 
Archaeological evidence of intensive agriculture is not recovered (or sought) as often as evidence of settlement, and spatial patterns of intensive agri­culture that match expectations of evolutionary interpretations of intensive agriculture have proven more elusive. Beginning in the 1930s, the connec­tion between intensive agriculture and sociopolit­ical organization has been an influential problem, although Steward had always emphasized how some irrigation infrastructure was not agricultural (Lawton et al. 1976; Steward 1930, 1933). Wittfo­gel posited a strong connection between irrigation

agriculture and political power (Wittfogel 1957). By the 1960s and 1970s, connections between irri­gation and society were pursued by ethnographers and archaeologists (Downing and Gibson 1974). Continuing research has problematized the link between the state as an evolutionary category and agricultural infrastructure, because irrigation is organized before the state can be detected (Dille­hay et al. 2005; Wilkinson 2003), because modem irrigators solve agricultural problems without the state (Femea 1970), and because modem states destroy irrigation systems through their misman­agement (Scott 1998). It may be that when deci­sions about the management of intensive agriculture (and common-pool resources in gen­eral) are disconnected from knowledge of how agri­culture works, systems quickly become unsustainable (Ostrom 1990, 2005). 
Critics of evolutionary approaches to sociopo­litical organization suggest that they can obscure diversity in the archaeological record and divert attention to an abstract category at the expense of historical detail (Pauketat 2007; Smith 2003; Yof­fee 2005). A more fruitful approach may be to characterize sociopolitical organization not by comparison to universal models, but by con­structing models of organization from archaeo­logical evidence in particular regions, thereby studying the political landscape (Smith 2003). These redefinitions of political relationships in the archaeological record are part of larger trends in archaeological interpretation that are more explic­itly historical. Especially in analyses of intensive agriculture, evolutionary models maintain their influence because archaeological evidence of intensive agriculture is scarce, but also because the archaeology of small settlements and agricultural infrastructure has often been understudied, par­ticularly in comparison with richly furnished tombs, monumental architecture, and large sites. Interpreting the relationship between intensive agriculture and political power begins with archae­ological evidence of intensive agriculture. 
Landscapes and Taskscapes 
Agriculture can change in many ways: through intensification, when labor, fertilizer, or other inputs are added; through extension, in which an agricul­tural system spreads; and through abandonment, when infrastructure goes out of use. To study agri­cultural change, analysis begins with local histo­ries of agricultural work, not the impact of political control from outside the system. This approach to landscape first defines specific landscape features, many of which are seldom incorporated into stan­dard definitions of "site," and then builds analyti­cal units from those features (Anschuetz et al. 2001; Erickson 2006a). In the Near East, for example, ter­races, threshing floors, and irrigation channels are atoms of a historical ecology of landscapes incor­porating more than six millennia of human expe­rience (Wilkinson 2003). This article is predicated on a definition of landscape that balances environ­ment and culture: "landscape is the material man­ifestation of the relation between humans and the environment" (Crumley 1987, 1994 ). When seen in diachronic perspective, landscapes become palimpsests and the records of many kinds of human activity, as they are continually written, erased, and rewritten. 
This definition of landscape grows from the tra­dition of geography created at Berkeley and led by Carl Sauer, who strongly influenced American geography and South American anthropology (Denevan 1966, 2001; Erickson 2008; Lathrap 1970, 1977; Sauer 1925; Steward 1946). "Mor­phological" geography defined landscape as the basic unit of geography, and argued for an under­standing that blended both the natural and the cul­tural. Opposed by a geographical tradition that defines regions as mental constructs, Olwig argues that landscape should continue in this tradition of cultural geography (Olwig 1996). In this sense, landscape maintains the connection between land and legal identity: rights and obligations. Devel­oping this perspective, Ingold argues that there is no basis by which to distinguish between the nat­ural and the cultural in landscape or taskscape (Ingold 1993). Ingold recognizes difficulties in reconstructing past activities from present land­scapes, but takes the practice of moving through the landscape, or dwelling, as a key aspect of archaeological and anthropological fieldwork. 
This analysis concerns cultural landscapes, according to Sauer's classification, and focuses on only two aspects of the landscape: differences in elevation and the control of water and fire, although these factors also influence the movement of plants and animals. When comparing landscapes, one can-

not be "more cultural" than another, even if there are important differences between the two of them and the people who made and maintained them. It is useful to think of the two landscapes linked to particular customs and laws about the relationships between people and the land, however, as in the sense of landscape redefined by Olwig. This arti­cle is framed by historical ecology insofar as it uses archaeological data to write the history of particu­lar agricultural landscapes. 
These agricultural landscapes were valuable to their inhabitants, and because they grow and develop, they can be theorized as landesque capi­tal (or innovations that create enduring fixed cap­ital in the land beyond a single crop or cropping cycle; see Blaikie and Brookfield 1987; Brookfield 200 1 :55) and recognized as "places" (Ashmore 2002). Archaeological studies of agricultural change in general and intensification in particular show that they are a diverse and complex histori­cal process (Stone 1991, 1993, 1994, 1996; Stone and Downum 1999). In a comparative, South Amer­ican case, by the late 1990s the interpretation of raised field agriculture in the Lake Titicaca basin revolved around two positions. First, that land­scapes of intensive agriculture in many cases pre­dated centralized administration and were organized without the assistance (or hindrance) of centralized administration (Erickson 2006a). Sec­ond, although conceding such local organization is possible, Janusek and Kolata argue that the Tiwanaku state had an important role in the cre­ation and maintenance of raised field agriculture (Janusek and Kolata 2004 ). Examining agricultural landscape over the long term suggests that this dichotomy between "top-down" and "bottom-up" control may be overdrawn (Erickson 1999; Kolata 1986; Kolata and Ortloff 1996; Kolata et al. 2000). Spatial analysis of agriculture can identify and define patterns of landscape features, but how can these patterns then be linked to social structures or units? They cannot be linked directly because of the palimpsest nature of landscape and the ability of local institutions to build and maintain landscape features. The greatest obstacle to interpretation of spatial patterns is that the same pattern (a block of raised fields, for example) could be interpreted as the correlate of an autonomous group of local farm­ers, or as the correlate of an administrative division within a centralized polity. This problem of equi­
finality means that defining clear spatial units is insufficient, and the analogy must be more specific. Instead of drawing analogies to levels of organiza­tion or all-embracing social units, spatial patterns are connected to specific tasks that required or facil­itated communal labor. Such a specific analysis shifts the focus to a smaller scale, and more spe­cific analogies (Stahl 1993; Wylie 1992). 
Ingold's idea of the "taskscape" links landscape features to groups of people and their communal tasks. Of landscape features and their associated tasks, some tasks affect the execution of others and some are more isolated. This difference means that landscapes differ in terms of how many tasks are associated with their constituent features, and how those tasks fit together in both space and time. This interlocking quality defines a taskscape (Ingold 1993). A taskscape is connected to a landscape as speech is connected to thought: they are insepara­ble, although one exists as material objects at par­ticular points in space, and one exists as actions (or tasks) at particular points in time. Taskscapes can be characterized and compared through their mate­rial correlates in the landscape. A more complex taskscape consists of more tasks of distinct types, requiring the coordination of more people and more groups of people. A taskscape is defined here as complex insofar as it is made up of tasks with dif­ferent requirements (places, people, plants, animals, tools) that overlap in time and space. They allow us to draw connections between each landscape fea­ture and the tasks associated with its creation and use. Such tasks make up the "normal business of life" (Ingold 1993: 154). Connections between taskscape and landscape can be seen at different scales, because many tasks modify the material landscape, and some modifications of the landscape permit or hinder other tasks. Through landscape features, it is possible to study specific intersections of daily practice and environment. Landscape fea­tures and their patterns are interpreted at smaller scales, as specific analogies are described and eval­uated. By setting aside classification of the entire landscape according to universal models of politi­cal centralization and instead connecting tasks with landscape features, a taskscape perspective provides a basis for more detailed understanding of the dif­ferences between different examples of local social organization. Regardless of what other kinds of sociopolitical organization may be related to these

landscapes, these conflicting sets of agricultural tasks were coordinated, and this process is reflected at local scales. Although a large number of patterns can potentially be discerned in an agricultural land­scape (much as an effectively infinite number of alignments can be derived from the Nazca lines or Stonehenge), not all of them were meaningful to their builders and first users. Those patterns with stronger analogues are of greater interest and are pre­sumably close to indigenous ideas about landscape. The durability of these landscapes (and taskscapes) over many centuries allows archaeo­logical study and analysis today. Across South America, landscapes stretch across long distances and are rich palimpsests built during many differ­entperiods. After decades during which few archae­ologists worked in the Amazon Basin, recent years have seen the development of many new research projects. Previous work on Maraj6 Island has been published in detail, including the results of com­prehensive remote sensing survey (Bevan and Roo­sevelt 2003), and Schaan's research on the Camutins chiefdom shows how Amazonians man­aged landscapes, in this case for fishing rather than agriculture (Schaan 2004). The Central Amazon Project has outlined the extent and chronology of occupation along the Madeira and Amazon rivers, downstream from the Llanos de Mojos (Neves 2008). In the Xingu to the east, Heckenberger and his colleagues have documented a complex of large towns and connecting causeways that they argue to be urban in scale (Heckenberger et al. 2008). To the north and west, in Brazil's Acre state, geoglyphs taking the form of ring ditches and other geomet­ric shapes are revealed by deforestation and stud­ied using Google Earth (Schaan et al. 2007). Within this arc of managed landscapes in the southwest Amazon, what makes the Llanos de Mojos (or Mojos) distinctive is that agricultural infrastruc­ture is visible in the savanna. In Mojos itself, Priimers has excavated large mounds near Trinidad, to the south, and argued for the presence of strati­fication, based on artifacts associated with some burials (Priimers 2000, 200 I, 2002; see also Lom­bardo and Priimers 2010). Erickson's recent work has focused on artificial fisheries and ring ditches in eastern Mojos (Erickson 2000, 2008; Erickson and Balee 2006). The recent Handbook of South American Archaeology contains several chapters that summarize developments in lowland archae­
ology (Drennan 2008; Oyuela-Caycedo 2008; Poli­tis 2008; Versteeg 2008). These and previous sum­maries of Amazonian archaeology show that the range of topics and geographic areas that are now under investigation is growing rapidly (McEwan et al. 200 l ). 
Much of this research documents various man­aged landscapes across South America. The raised fields associated with Araucanian society are par­ticularly interesting, in that they are associated with the societies that most effectively resisted incor­poration into the Inca, Colonial and Chilean states (Dillehay 2007; Dillehay et al. 2007). Many types of earthworks and settlement remains in tropical settings around the world are more easily detected from the air than on the ground. As remote sens­ing resources become both more sophisticated and more available, it is likely that other areas of pre­columbian earthworks will become known. 
When the landscape is described in terms of dis­crete units, or landscape features, these can be linked to the particular tasks required to create and maintain them, and the tasks they afforded. This article defines specific landscape features in the material record, and assembles them into larger units or patterns, connecting those patterns to the lived experience of the people who created, main­tained, and used them. Landscape features are defined and measured using formal characteristics: length, width, height, and shape. After features have been described, patterns in their arrangement can be defined. Specific features and types of fea­tures are then linked to specific tasks. Finally, larger patterns and the types of such patterns are linked to different kinds of tasks. For this purpose, a pattern described from spatial analysis has explanatory value in direct proportion to the asso­ciated tasks it affords. 
Tasks affect and are affected by the spatial pat­terns of agricultural infrastructure. This can be demonstrated in the comparison of two related agri­cultural landscapes. Two archaeological examples of agricultural infrastructure from similar cultural, environmental, and technological contexts were examined. The goal is to outline the different agri­cultural tasks that were required for the creation of landscape features, and were afforded by their cre­ation. These landscape features are associated with specific tasks based on what was required to cre­ate them, and what tasks they afforded, based on

ethnoarchaeological, ethnohistoric, agronomic, and archaeological data. The interlocking schedule of farming, hunting, and fishing tasks maps onto a multipurpose infrastructure of field platforms, canals, and causeways. Relationships between types of features are considered from each of the two landscapes. Differences between the taskscapes are then compared, and the relationship between landscape/taskscape complexity and sociopolitical complexity is considered. These dif­ferences and this relationship are used to make a comparison between two landscape histories. 
The Central Llanos de Mojos 
The case studies come from an unlikely setting: the seasonally inundated tropical savanna in Eastern Bolivia called the Llanos de Mojos (or Mojos; Fig­ure 1 ). Mojos is a seasonally flooded tropical savanna, crossed by dozens of small rivers, larger tributaries, and the Beni, Itenez (or Guapore), and Mamore rivers. Rainfall is strongly seasonal, with peak totals in January, and very little rain in July and August. Permanent and seasonal wetlands are interspersed with forested high ground and gallery forests. River meanders and oxbow lakes continu­ally reshape the landscape, and the levees left behind by ancient rivers add to the complexity of the flat terrain. The result is a mosaic of landforms, strongly affected by seasonal flows of water and rains. Mojos is located entirely within the tropics, and the Mojos biota includes a variety of wetland species, birds, snakes and amphibians, and fish. 
The ethnohistoric and linguistic record for Mojos is complex (Block 1994; Crevels and Van der Voort 2008; Denevan 1966), and includes sev­eral ambiguous terms. Mojos is used here to rep­resent the entire Llanos de Mojos as a geographic region. Mojeiio refers to precolumbian inhabitants of the region, making no interpretation of cultural or linguistic affiliation. Mojo is a term for an indige­nous language classified as Arawak, spoken by many groups in the Jesuit missions of the seven­teenth and eighteenth centuries.

Mojos is noted for extensive and well-preserved remains of precolumbian agricultural infrastruc­ture. Spread across an area as large as Syria or the Yucatan peninsula, Mojefios built earthworks in a wide variety of forms. Many well-preserved earth­works are located in the savannas and along the gallery forests of the tributaries of the west bank of the Mamore River (or more simply Central Mojos). These earthworks have been known since the 1960s, and the pace of archaeological research in the area is increasing. Earthworks of various types in Mojos have been reliably dated from ca. 900 BCE to 1500 CE and it is likely that their use extends further back into time. 
The best overview of Mojos remains Denevan's original monograph, although superb ethnohistori­cal work has been carried out (Block 1994 ). In brief, there were six prominent "tribes" described by the Jesuits in their seventeenth-and eighteenth-century accounts that still exist: the Arawak-speaking Mojo and Baure, and the Movima, Cayuvava, Canichana, and Itonama, each of which speaks an isolated lan­guage. Linguistic research is burgeoning, and it appears that Mojos is one of the places within South America in which the diversity of unrelated lan­guages is very high (Crevels and van der Voort 2008). Remains of earthworks are widely distrib­uted across the entire region, and there are impor­tant regional differences between these earthworks. These distinctive areas include large raised fields in north-central Mojos, causeways, raised fields and canals in the south, large mounds in the southeast, ring ditches and causeways in the northeast, and mound fields in the west. Although earthworks had a variety of potential functions, the improvement of soil conditions for agriculture was clearly of primary importance (Erickson 2006b ). The societies of Mojos are exceptional cases in early classifications of South American cultures, described as chiefdoms and classified with circum-Caribbean chiefdoms (Steward 1946; Steward and Faron 1959). The Jesuit missions were established in the late seventeenth century, leaving a 200-year transitional or proto­historical period during which connections between particular communities and the landscape must have changed. Nevertheless, it is clear that earthworks in Mojos are associated with the indigenous people liv­ing in the Beni today. More detailed summaries of the archaeology of Mojos are available elsewhere (Erickson 2006b; Walker 2008). 
Earthworks along two rivers are considered, the 
Iruyafiez in the north and the Apere in the south (Figure 1 ). The two landscapes are both located in seasonally inundated savanna. They are less than 100 km apart, they are both tributaries of the Mamore, preservation conditions are similar, and they have similar histories of occupation and land use. The annual inundations of the two regions appear to be similar, with inundation moving from the permanent wetlands up toward the river levees, sometimes covering as much as 50 percent of the lower Iruyafiez study area (Walker 2004 ). The two regions have similar plant and animal resources. The similarities in geology, climate, rainfall, drainage, vegetation, and fauna in the Iruyafiez and Apere make strictly environmental explanations for this contrast unlikely, which invites compari­son of the tasks and taskscapes that were created by their precolumbian inhabitants. 
Agricultural tasks take place in time and space, and so are related to temporal cycles (Ingold 1993: 159). The most insistent rhythm in Mojefio life is the alternation between inundation (Febru­ary) and drought (August). Inundations move from the lower backslopes toward the high ground adja­cent to the river, but also on occasion top these lev­ees from the other side and inundate the landscape from the river (Erickson and Walker 2009). Tem­poral cycles of crops are highly variable because tropical farmers manipulate trees, annuals, and plants (such as manioc) that are continuously grown and harvested. The temporality of fish and animal life cycles is also important because use of these resources depends not on the domestication of individual species, but of the landscapes in which they move. 
Methods 
For each landscape, a summary description is pre­sented, followed by more detailed descriptions of each of the patterns of earthworks that were observed and measured within the sample. These patterns were defined through spatial analysis of mapped earthworks. The GIS helps quantify rela­tionships between different spatial units and types of spatial units within the landscape. Earthworks were traced direct! y from georeferenced aerial pho­tographs obtained from the IGM in Bolivia, and other features, including rivers and forests were

traced from public domain satellite imagery on Google Earth. Currently a community of students 
(Proyecto Arqueol6gico SIG del Beni/PROSIGAB) 
is measuring raised fields and other landscape fea­
tures, recording results in a GIS database using 
ArcGIS. Despite the widespread archaeological 
evidence of intensive agriculture, there is no 
detailed ethnographic or historical record of raised 
field agriculture in Mojos, so general analogies 
between particular earthworks and communal tasks 
are required. Only the least ambiguous patterns 
(individual platforms, for example) can be thought 
of as having precolumbian meaning. 
The Iruyafiez landscape has four patterns: plat­
forms, platform neighborhoods, platform groups, 
and platform divisions. The Apere River landscape 
has seven separate patterns, in three distinct cate­
gories: blocks, block neighborhoods, and block 
divisions form the first category. Causeways can 
be grouped at two levels: the individual causeway 
and the network of causeways. Blocks and cause­
ways are integrated in the groups of blocks that are 
defined by the hydraulic catchment of a causeway 
(block-causeway neighborhoods), and groups of 
blocks that are bounded by causeways (block­
causeway divisions). Measurements for each type 
of earthworks are summarized, and the tasks that 
are associated with it, the tasks that it affords, and 
the tasks that impact other tasks are all enumerated. 
Landscape features are presented by region, and 
then the two regions are compared. 
lruyanez River 
Along the Iruyafiez River, earthwork forms are 
homogeneous (Figures 2, 3; Figure 4, top)-orig­
inally described as "large raised fields" (Denevan 
1966). Farmers built fields on the high ground bor­
dering the gallery forest. Small seasonal creeks 
interrupt these high areas every kilometer or two. ; During the rainy season, inundations cover much 
of the landscape, while for the most part earth­
works remain dry. Although datable remains are 
difficult to obtain from excavations, earthworks 
have been dated through association with settle­
ment. Two settlements along the river are well 
dated, San Juan (BYA122) (5 dates, 1475-1560 
B.P.) and El Cerro (BYA107) (8 dates, 470-620 
B.P.), both along the lower Iruyafiez River (Walker 
2004:74). Both of these settlements are directly 
adjacent to raised fields. Test excavations at Cerro

showed an area of dark soil, charcoal, burned clay, and ceramics 565 m across, which could corre­spond to a sizable village or town. San Juan is located within a forest island of similar size, but transects of test excavations did not bisect the island, so the size of the settlement cannot presently be determined. San Juan is located within the mea­sured sample of raised field platforms, and is near to some of the largest fields in the area. Large raised fields are associated with both locations, suggest­ing that farmers used raised fields on this landscape over the course of at least 900 years. Links between excavations in raised fields, ceramics, and settle­ment are explored in more depth elsewhere (Walker 2004, 2011, 2012). 
Platforms (Figure 4, center right). Platforms were measured directly in ArcGIS from digitized aerial photographs. A sample of 1,665 platforms ranged between .0 16 and 2.707 ha in area, with a mean of .316 ha, and a standard deviation of .277. Individual platforms are long and narrow, averag­ing 20 m wide by 200 m long, and 40 cm tall, although some are longer than a kilometer. Each platform differs from its neighbors, both in size and orientation. Farmers built these as individual con­structions. They are not uniform in size or orienta­tion and farmers placed some of them on the landscape in helter-skelter fashion. 
Platform neighborhoods (Figure 4, bottom right). A platform neighborhood represents a sin­gle platform and the immediately adjacent plat­forms. To determine adjacency, a "buffer" was calculated in ArcGIS for each platform such that the area of the buffer was equal to the area of the platform, a rough simulation of the area from which

soil for the platform was gathered from the imme­diately adjacent savanna. A platform neighborhood therefore consists of a central platform, and all sur­rounding platforms whose buffer overlaps with that of the central platform. Platform neighborhoods were calculated for all 1,584 platforms with neigh­bors within the mean value for equal area buffer for the entire sample (7 .12 m). A platform neigh­borhood represents a single platform and the neigh­boring platform on which its construction and use had a direct effect. Platform neighborhoods ranged from .105 ha to 7 .990 ha, with an average of 1.420 ha, and a standard deviation of 1.03. 
Platform groups (Figure 4, center left). Mem­bers of a platform group are adjacent (as defined by overlapping buffers, see above) and share the same orientation. Platform groups were generated using the equal area buffers used to define platform neighborhoods, after first dividing all platforms into two classes based on orientation: north-south and east-west. Groups were defined as those plat­forms with overlapping equal area buffers, in the same orientation class. Single platfom1s were not counted as groups. A sample of 137 platform groups ranged from .061 ha to 80.342 ha, with a mean of 3. 697 ha and a standard deviation of 9 .4 7 5. An independent sample of 30 platform groups based on similar criteria (but applied manually to 
a different measured sample of platforms) had a range of .64 ha to 17.43 ha, a mean of 4.97 ha, and a standard deviation of 4.79 (Walker 2004). 
Platform divisions (Figure 4, bottom left). Plat­form divisions in the Iruyafiez landscape are defined as areas of platforms (as defined by over­lapping buffers) separated by open spaces (where buffers do not overlap). A total of 58 platform divi­sions range from .169 to 162.561 ha, with a mean of 94. 140 ha and a standard deviation of 38.343. Divisions are generated by separating the set of all platforms into divisions, separated where equal area buffers did not overlap. Blank spaces could be the result of differential preservation, and are not "intentional" in the same sense as spatial units bounded by earthworks. For example, some corre­spond to seasonal streams. They could be related through proximity to other features, like anthrosol deposits (interpreted as settlements). 
Landscape (Figures 2, 3, 4). If we define the lruyafiez landscape heuristically by the presence of "large raised fields," it stretches for tens of kilo­meters along the lruyafiez and Omi rivers, and sev­eral of their tributary creeks. The landscape extends for kilometers outward from either side of each of the rivers, involved the movement of hundreds of thousands of cubic meters of soil, and covered tens of square kilometers. Platforms are oriented gen-

Figure 4. Schematic map of earthworks along the middle Iruyaiiez River, west of its confluence with the Omi River. Earthworks of a single form (large raised fields) are shown in the large map, and the four distinct arrangements of those forms are shown in the inset maps. These arrangements correspond to the measurements in Table 1 (earthworks were digitized by Chris Gilhooley).

erally either perpendicular or parallel to the course 
of the neighboring river. The tasks associated with 
the entire lruyaiiez landscape do not have any direct 
impact on tasks associated with landscape features 
in the Apere landscape. For example, the Iruyaiiez 
is not diverted or impounded by any earthworks, 
such that any part of it can be thought of as a "down­
stream" or "upstream" community. 
Large raised field platforms are very widely dis­tributed, from the large lakes (including Laguna Rogaguado) in the north to the Middle Yacuma in the south, a distance of about I 00 km. In Jesuit accounts (dating to about 1695), this central area of large raised field platforms is associated with Cayuvava speakers (Block 1994; Denevan 1966). The Cayuvava are not as well-known as the Arawak-speaking Mojo and Baure, but they are associated with a distinctive handheld basketry fish trap (Block 1994; Keller 1874). They are described as having large villages of between 1,800 and 2,000 inhabitants when they were visited in the late sev­enteenth century (Zapata 1906). It is difficult to establish direct historical connections between Jesuit descriptions and the precolumbian Iruyaiiez landscape, but the Cayuvava were clearly part of precolumbian Mojos. 
Apere River 
Along the Apere River earthworks have two dis­tinct forms, and farmers built them in several dif­ferent arrangements. The landscape is composed of open areas punctuated by ditches less than 50 cm in depth, occurring about every 7 to 10 m (Fig­ures 5, 6). Ditches have a bimodal distribution of orientations, clustering around a northwest-south­east orientation, perpendicular to the general course of the river, and a northeast-southwest ori­entation, parallel to the river. Farmers arranged their ditches in parallel groups, sometimes 
bounded by low berms of earth with associated canals. Each block contains ditches that are always parallel to one another. The blocks are generally rectilinear and satellite imagery shows a continu­ous area of blocks covering the back slope on either side of the Apere River. This coverage is very dense, and blocks cover almost the entire area. These blocks are the smallest unit of organization in the landscape that has a clear spatial definition, and likely held meaning for precolumbian farm­ers. Associated with these blocks of ditches are

causeways, oriented both along and across the gen­
eral orientation of the river floodplain. Causeways 
are about a meter in height, and as long as two or 
three kilometers. 
Blocks (Figure 6, upper left). Blocks are groups of parallel ditches, sometimes bounded by a low berm. Ditches are spatially determined by their positions within a larger block, and they do not occur independently of blocks. Blocks were mea­sured directly in ArcGIS using digitized aerial pho­tographs. They can be defined because the parallel ditches of neighboring blocks usually have differ­ent orientations. In other blocks, boundaries are visible in the aerial photographs. Space between the ditches average perhaps 7 or 8 m across and 50-100 m long. A sample of 428 blocks range from .189 to 38.9 I 6 ha, with a mean of 3.233 ha and a standard deviation of 3.065. 
Block neighborhoods (Figure 6, middle left). 
Neighborhoods of blocks, defined and analyzed in 
the GIS, include a single block and all adjacent 
blocks. Blocks that share either a side or a comer 
are considered adjacent. A total of385 block neigh­
borhoods can be defined from blocks, ranging from 
2.280 to 75.530 ha, with a mean of 16.420 ha and a standard deviation of 9.620. Note that unlike the Iruyaiiez platforms, blocks were not analyzed using buffers, because they are directly adjacent, and soil for construction seems to have come from within the block. 
Block Divisions (Figure 6, bottom left). Divi­sions in the block landscape are defined as areas of contiguous blocks separated by open spaces. These blank spaces could be the result of differential preservation, and are not "intentional" in the same
