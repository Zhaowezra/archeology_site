Authors in Manufactured Light deal with the composite, assembled surfaces of mosaic mirrors as singular, shiny surfaces and ignore other salient properties, namely,geometryand number.Inhisstudy of thelarge mirror fromLas Bocas,Puebla(thought to date to about 1000 B.C.), Alexander Marshack (inAveni, ed., ArchaeoastronomyinPre-Columbian America, 1975) analyzed the number, shapes, and arrangementofpyrite piecesof themirror.He argued persuasivelythat the 354 tesseraethat oncecomprised this rectangular-shaped mirror represented a calendar countof12 lunar months.It wouldbe welltoanalyze Classic-period mirrors in as muchdetail. The possi­bility that mosaicmirrors had calendrical,geometric, or numerological signi.cance is not considered in this book. Rather, mirrors provided luminous surfaces for looking into otherrealms.Some mirrorseven spoke, andthe sensesof touchand smell wereinvolved with others. 
In his summation, Taube discusses Postclassic mosaic mirrors that were clearly laid out as cosmo­grams. Olivia Kindl documentsthatHuichol mirrors continue to be framed as cosmograms. Her study calls attention to framing devices, most of which do not preserve archaeologically. Some Maya .int eccentrics appear to be copies of wooden mirror frames, soI would not be surprisedif some mirrors hadbeen attachedtowoodenhandles rather thanworn as pectorals. I suspect that the earliest mirrors were viewed in cosmological terms. As depicted in Olmec art, mirrors were centering devices that surely marked their wearers as central persons. These observations only scratch the surface of ManufacturedLight.The book merits careful perusal by those interested in Mesoamerican cultures, andsome chapters deserveto be read twice.

There remains much to be written about the history of Peruvian archaeology, despite the existence of accounts focused on prominent individuals such as MaxUhleand JulioC.Tello.Notably lackingtodate hasbeenanoverviewplacing researchinthecontext of the social, political, and economic changes that wereoccurring concurrently bothinsideand outside Peru.Tantaleán hasprovidedthe .rst such analytical review. 
The book is divided into 10 chapters. Chapter 1 brie.y traces the gradual emergence of archaeology from early postconquest times up until the very end of the nineteenth century. Chapter 2 introduces Uhle who, in 1896, conducted the .rst stratigraphic excavations in Peru. He continued his work with American sponsorship, was appointed by an enlight­ened government to head the archaeological section atanew NationalMuseumin 1906, anddevelopeda chronological scheme based on horizon styles. Also introducedisTello,whoexplored theruinsof Chavín de Huantar and established a museum of archaeology attheUniversityofSanMarcosin 1919.In chapter3 the reader learns that during the 1920s Peru forged a strong relationship with the United States while dealing with the rise of an indigenous movement in the southern highlands centered at Cuzco. Tello beganteachinganthropology at SanMarcosin 1923 and was named director of the National Museum of Archaeology in 1924. Based on his work at Chavín he theorized an Andean mother culture with highland and tropical forest origins that diffused to the coast. At the start of the 1930s the effects of the Great Depression resulted in a military coup. Tello was removed asdirectorof the NationalMuseumandwas replacedby thehistorian LuisE.Valcárcel.The latter created a new National Museum, was proactive in forginga nationalidentity, andfocused hisattention on thecleaningand reconstructionofIncasitesin and around Cuzco. Because of Valcárcel’s emphasis on tourismhisworkwasfully fundedbythegovernment, to the detriment of Tello’s scienti.c endeavors; this caused Tello to travel to the United States in 1936, resulting in the creation of the Institute of Andean Research. Chapter 4 focuses on Valcárcel and the indigenous movement that had intellectual roots in Cuzco.Valcárcel drew inspiration fromthe discovery oftheruinsof MachuPicchuand subsequently became enamored with Marxistideas.In 1927hewasbrie.y imprisonedfor publishingaworkinwhichhe called fora revolutiontocreateanidealized Inca state.

ethnohistorian John Murra, who used documents to identify the locales of speci.c sites. In particular, attention is given both to his work at the Inca ruins of Huánuco Pampa and to his archipelago model. It was during the 1960s that the National Geographic Society sponsored multidisciplinary explorations and excavationsintheMocheValley; anothermajor multi­disciplinaryAmerican project focusedonthe Mantaro Valley. The political climateinsideand outside Peru hadchanged dueto theColdWar.Researchin thefol­lowing decadewas decidedlyfocusedon social science as practicedby thePeruvian Luis Lumbreras,whois thefocusof chapter8.Chapter9discussesthe highly disruptive 1980s and the rise of the Shining Path. During this periodyetanothermajor multidisciplinary project, international in character, was conducted in theMoquegua region. Opportunities wereprovidedto faculty and students, especially those af.liated with SanMarcos. But, as discussedinchapter 10, during the 1990s thegovernment temporarily shutdown this public university and severely reduced its funding. In concertwith increased foreignfundingfortheprivate Catholic University,thisservedtoreducethe prestige and outreach of San Marcos. Finally, at the start of the new century the newly elected president linked hisadministrationtothe glorious pastof theIncaas expressedinthe ruinsofMachuPicchu, thus signaling a revival of nationalism. 
Each of Tantaleán’s chapters could be expanded into a book, resulting in a series that would cover a plethoraoftopics andviewpoints.Tello,forexample, isgiveninsuf.cient credit forhis social activism, as demonstrated by articles written by and about him publishedinthe Lima press.Tantaleán’s chapters are in part character-driven, in part theoretically driven, andinpartinstitutionally driven,all within thecon­text of the complexities of national and international interconnectionsover time. While hispresentationat .rst glance appears to be primarily chronological, this is not necessarily so, nor is there consistency of focus from chapter to chapter. The .nal chapters, for example, become increasinglypersonaland autobio­graphical. 
Despite these criticisms, Tantaleán merits praise for publishing the .rst analytical general history of Peruvian archaeology and a debt is owed to Charles Stanish for his .ne translation. Tantaleán’s book provides an important starting point from which to beginserious discussions inside and outside theclass­room.Itstargetaudienceis primarily professional,but because of the larger-than-life characters discussed within,itwill appealtoanyone interestedinthehistory of archaeology in general, and speci.cally that of Peru.
