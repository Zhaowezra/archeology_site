zonian mode of interpretation that derives ultimately from the works of the late, great, and reliably audacious Donald Lathrap. The separate question of whether the societies were centralized or egalitarian seems unde­cided, however. The likening of Kogi and Mapuche, not otherwise known for high degrees of political organi­zation, to the habitants of Huaca de los Reyes and Sechin Alto fails to make a case for centralization in the form of large-scale institutions. 
In my view, the final chapters pack less punch. The tabulation of processions, including aspects of timing, space, sound, roles, and props, suggests that proces­sions took place in the past. This is not, perhaps, a sur­prising conclusion, although readers will benefit from Moore's dissection of the spatial components of ritual. Then, in his final substantive section, Moore moves to the "house" society, now a fixture of archaeological research in much of the Americas. The intellectual bloodline is clear: first generation--Claude Levi-Strauss and his detection of houses as overt models of kinship among the Kwakiutl, Yurok, and noble families of Medieval France; second generation--relatively tardy importation to general anthropology; and, third gener­ation, on to archaeology. 
For Moore, the ciudadelas of Chan Chan, long­known as an enigmatic and relatively abundant feature of this city, are material exemplifications of elite (read ''royal") houses. They stored collective wealth, perdured over time, housed many people in ties of fictive kinship, and honored the memory of key ancestors through rit­ual. To Moore, the appearance of such compounds in the late first millennium A.D. points to a historical incep­tion for house societies at this time. The problem is that the "house" concept is a unit of identity, a self-concept. It plausibly, but not provably, expresses itself in archae­ologicaJ.evidence from prehistory. A recent, somewhat conservative application of the concept to Iberia in late prehistory lists a number of attributes, including unclear descent systems, territorial ramifications, inherited emblems of rank, none of which can be securely docu­mented in the ciudadelas of Chan Chan (Alfredo Gonzalez-Ruibal, Journal of Anthropological Archae­ology 25:146). 
Moore has written, in his own description, a book 
about how peoples of the Andes and adjacent regions 
made and experienced a sense of place. The focus is on 
final design and recurrent use, not on technologies of 
building or how structures came to be (these will need 
a separate volume, along the lines of Jean-Pierre 
Protzen' son Inka masonry, yet far more extensive). Nor 
does Moore mechanically apply ethnographic observa­
tion to past peoples. The correlations are inexact and, 
because of shifts from imperial societies to rural, peas­
ant ones, thin or invalid. He works instead through spe­
cific arguments, tailored to problems at hand, and 

remains sensitive to dimensions of experience (sound, religious passages, movement, identity) that sit outside the majority of archaeological research. With this book, Moore makes those dimensions central to our practice. His bold example should be followed elsewhere.

The reconfiguration of prehispanic societies following the collapse of Classic period states and the develop­ment of interconnected small states or city-states marked the Postclassic period. This volume complements other recent works on the Postclassic by archaeologists and ethnohistorians who have employed diverse theoretical frameworks to understand these changes. This book use­fully pulls together much previously unpublished infor­mation on the Postclassic of coastal Chiapas collected during various projects directed by Barbara Voorhies and Janine Gasco. 
The Soconusco region comprised of the Pacific coast of the modem Mexican state of Chiapas and adjoining Guatemala was famed for its cacao production and also formed an important frontier and crossroads in prehis­panic Mesoamerica. In the late fifteenth century the Aztecs conquered the Soconusco and incorporated it into their empire. Gasco and Voorhies undertook their individual and joint field investigations in Chiapas with diverse objectives, and the authors are explicit about the limitations of their data. Much of the Late Postclassic material they found came from deposits mixed with ear­lier artifacts. The identification of Early and Middle Postclassic is problematic and it is difficult to recognize sites without mounds in the Soconusco. Nonetheless, the authors present much useful information, especially on the Late Postclassic. 
This well-illustrated volume contains seven chapters 
and two appendixes. Chapter 2 describes the Late Post­
classic site of Acapetahua, the capital of a Late Post­
classic polity. As part of the Proyecto Soconusco, they 
conducted subsurface testing at the site, along with larger 
horizontal excavations. Occupation extends back to the 
Late Preclassic when a large platform was constructed 
on a ridge top. Following the Aztec conquest in the 
1480s, Acapetahua became a tribute center. 
Chapter 3 presents data on sites subordinate to 
Acapetahua or other primary centers. Late Postclassic 
secondary centers generally consist of central conical 
mounds that probably supported a small temple flanked

by rectangular plazas to the east and west. In contrast to the Late Classic when ballcourts occurred at both sec­ondary and major centers, by the Late Postclassic spon­sorship of ball courts was restricted to capital centers. Voorhies and Gasco connect the changes in site layout to a shift from village or small chiefdom organization to complex chiefdoms and/or small states during the Postclassic. 
Chapters 4 through 6 focus on material culture. The changing Postclassic political economy that involved greater stratification and specialization and expanded market and tribute systems prompted the adoption of new technologies, as Jeffrey Parsons has discussed for the Basin of Mexico (in Arqueolog{a Mesoamericana: Homenaje a William T. Sanders, 2 vols., edited by A. G. Mastache, J. R. Parsons, M. C. Serra Puche, and R. S. Santley, 1996). Along the Pacific coast, fishnets might have been employed for the first time. Copper needles, bells, and a small number of cooper projectile points were obtained through trade with west Mexico. Although most cutting tools continued to be made of stone, during the Late Postclassic, Central Mexican obsidian sources dominated closer sources in Guatemala. Some have suggested the Central Mexican obsidian was better for Postclassic tool types. However, Central Mexican obsidian also became more accessible with increased exchange and interaction between the Soconusco and Central Mexico. 
Textiles took on increasing importance as seen in ceramic spindle whorls with fabric impressions for spin­ning cotton. The presence of a few large ceramic spin­dle whorls suggests to Voorhies and Gasco that Soconusco weavers also spun maguey fibers into twine to meet increased demand for fishnets, along with other uses. Ethnohistoric documents attest to the growth of cacao production to meet demands for culinary and rit­ual consumption, and also use of cacao as a medium of exchange and for tribute payments. Cacao attracted for­eign merchants who traveled by canoe and overland to the Soconusco, and also foreign conquerors, the Aztecs. 
People intensified their use of maize. They used spe­cialized basins to soak dried maize, along with strain­ers, and perhaps for the first time in the Soconusco, they made tortillas. Strainers also might have been used for atole, a drink made from ground maize. Molcajetes, ceramic bowls with grater bottoms, became part of the domestic ceramic complex. Voorhies and Gasco relate other changes in pottery to patterns of social interaction. 
James Deetz (In Small Things Forgotten: The Archaeology of Early American Life, 1977) in his clas­sic work on the archaeology of colonial New England applied the concept of foodways, an "interrelated sys­tem of food conceptualization, procurement, distribu­tion, preservation, preparation, and consumption" to 
look at ceramics (1977:50). Voorhies and Gasco take a similar approach. They observe how elaborately deco­rated bowls and dishes appropriate for serving individ­ual size portions became increasingly popular during the Postclassic in contrast to large Classic Maya serving dishes designed for communal consumption. Interest­ingly, Deetz documented a similar change from com­munal to individualized eating utensils in colonial New England, a change he linked to mass production, but also to "a new accommodation between the individual and his material culture. Gone now is the older, corporate emphasis" (Deetz 1977:59). Gasco and Voorhies also tie the Postclassic change in serving dishes to a greater emphasis on the individual and individual status and attenuation in the importance of large communal kin­based social units. Mass production accompanied the growing popularity of individual serving dishes/cajetes that Postclassic potters made to a standard sizy (usually 20 cm in diameter). Large storage jars became more abundant and standardized in size, which the authors suggest might have been prompted by a need for stan­dard units of measure in trade and tribute. New styles of pottery incorporated influences from other regions, e.g., Mixteca-Puebla international style. Some Aztec orange ware pottery was imported but Soconusco pot­
ters also made local imitations. 
In the concluding chapter, Voorhies and Gasco situ­ate the Soconusco in terms of larger Postclassic trends. The development of a more commercial economy and greater economic integration accompanied political decentralization. Merchants crossed political bound­aries and the market system moved substantial quanti­ties of goods both locally and long distance. The authors also see more interaction among ethnic groups and more widely shared religious beliefs and practices. A decline in the volume/size of monumental buildings marked shifts in the nature of political power. In the Soconusco and elsewhere in Mesoamerica, however, the lack of chronological refinement plagues efforts to better under­stand these changes. This timely volume lays founda­tions for future research in this important region.
