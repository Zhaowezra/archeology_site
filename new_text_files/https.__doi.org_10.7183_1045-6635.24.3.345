As dates of earliest use o/Theobroma cacao in ancient Mesoamerica are established, interest is shifting to how cacao was used. One approach is to consider combinations of ingredients-the recipes for ancient cacao use. Beverages made from cacao seeds and maize have a long history in Mesoamerica. We began testing the hypothesis that there is qualitative evi­dence of this beverage type in the Postclassic archaeological record in a region where such a beverage, tejate, is a cultur­ally significant food today. We looked for evidence of tejate ingredients in residue samples from eight Postclassic and one contemporary vessel from the Valley of Oaxaca, Mexico. Detection of morphologically specific maize phytoliths was accom­plished by taxonomic analysis and comparison with a reference collection. Tejate ingredients Pouteria sapota and Quararibea funebris were also processed for phytolith detection. Testing for methylxanthines characteristic o/Theobroma species used high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Four vessels were positive for maize phytoliths; three were positive for theobromine; two were positive for both maize and cacao. No diagnostic phytoliths were identified for the other tejate ingredients. Our hypothesis was supported; still, many challenges are present in the search for a deeper understanding of ancient cacao usage in this region of Mesoamerica. 
Estudios recientes han fechado el uso de Theobroma cacao en varias regiones de Mesoamerica y ahora el interes en el cacao ha cambiado hacia c6mo Jue utilizado. Un enfoque es considerar las combinaciones de ingredientes, las recetas para el uso antiguo de! cacao. Las bebidas hechas de semi/las de cacao y mafz tienen una larga historia en Mesoamerica. Nosotros some­timos a prueba La hip6tesis de que existe evidencia cualitativa de este tipo de bebida en el registro arqueol6gico del Post­cldsico, en una region donde hoy en dfa el tejate es un alimento culturalmente importante. Buscamos evidencia de los ingredientes de! tejate en muestras de residuos tomadas de ocho vasijas postcldsicas y una vasija contempordnea, todas proce­dentes de! Valle de Oaxaca, Mexico. Se detectaronfitolitos de mafz morfol6gicamente especificos por media de andlisis taxo­n6mico y comparaci6n con una colecci6n de referencia. Los ingredientes del tejate, Pouteria sapota (semillas de mamey) y Quararibea funebris (jlor de rosita de cacao) tambien fueron procesados para detectar fitolitos. Se utiliz6 cromatograffa lfquida­espectometr{a de masas de alto rendimiento para la prueba de presencia de metilxantinas caracter{sticas de las especies de Theobroma. Cuatro vasijas resultaron positivas para fitolitos de ma{z, tres positivas para teobromina y dos positivas tanto para ma(z como para cacao. No se identzficaronfitolitos diagn6sticos para los otros ingredientes del tejate. Los resultados apoyan nuestra hip6tesis. Sin embargo, quedan numerosos retos en la busqueda de un mejor entendimiento sabre el uso antiguo de! cacao en esta region de Mesoamerica.

sumption of that food. The so-called Z.Ouche-Nut­tall Codex, dating to the Late Postclassic (A.D. 1200-1521) from the Mixtec area of what is now the state of Oaxaca, Mexico (Anders et al. 1992), includes images of foam-topped beverages being served in tripodal, vertical-necked alias, held up with two hands, apparently as offerings, by seated nobles. Some of these images include representa­tions of agave leaves, suggesting a pulque-like drink; others include flowers or what appear to be cacao pods. 
The Valley of Oaxaca likely had access to cacao by the Late Postclassic, both through short (from the Pacific coast trade center ofTututepec for cacao grown by its tributaries [Levine 2011]) and long­distance trade (production from Soconusco that involved traveling long distances, including to cen­tral Mexico at the time [Gasco 2006]), although there were other sources as well. While not always on the scale of Soconusco cultivation, cacao appears to have been cultivated in appropriate envi­ronments, or improved ones (i.e., with irrigation), throughout precolonial Mesoamerica and includ­ing what is now northern Oaxaca, where diversity of remnant cacao populations suggests this was once an area of intense cultivation (Millon 1955; Ogata et al. 2006). 
Research regarding ancient or historic diets has focused on the presence or absence of particular plant species and has found material evidence in the New World of maize (Zea mays mays), beans (Phaseolus spp), squash ( Cucurbita spp), and chili (Capsicum spp) among many others (Bozarth 1987, 1990, 1993a; Piperno et al. 2009; Piperno and Stothert 2003). Recently, a number of studies have reported the early presence of Theobroma species, assumed to be T. cacao, detected in archaeological vessels or remains of vessels thought to have been used to serve or consume beverages in Early Pre­classic Olmec Oj0chi (from 1350 B .C.) and Mokaya (1900 B.C.) sites in Atlantic and Pacific coastal Mexico, respectively (Powis 2007); in a broad span of Early Preclassic Olmec (1800-1000 B .C.) occupation of their first capital San Lorenzo, in what is now Veracruz, Mexico (Powis et al. 20 11); in Mayan Belize (600 B.C.-A.D. 250) (Hurst et al. 2002); in Ocotillo phase Puerto Escon­dido, northeastern Honduras (1400-1100 B .C .) (Henderson et al. 2007); and in what is today the southwestern United States (A.D. 1000-1 125) 
(Crown and Hurst 2009) and (A.D. 900-1400) (Washburn et al. 2011). As we explain later, T. bicolor also may have been a source of these pos­itive identifications (Kufer and McNeil 2006). For this reason, we use the term "cacao" as a gloss referring to both T. cacao and T. bicolor, unless oth­erwise indicated. 
As an increasing number of studies are estab­lishing dates of earliest use and distribution of pre­pared cacao in ancient Mesoamerica, a call to expand the research agenda to include "a more con­sidered discussion of the richness of cacao cuisine" in the region (Joyce and Henderson 2010; see also Powis et al. 2002:101) has been made. One approach is to investigate not only the occurrence of cacao, but also its presence in combination with other ingredients-in a sense, the recipes for ancient cacao use. Vessel forms and imagery sug­gest this was often in the form of beverages. Con­temporary preparation of traditional recipes is a useful starting place for insights into ancient recipes. Today, Mesoamerican cacao consumption in the form of traditional foods persists, including as a foam-topped beverage made from cacao seeds and maize, often with other plant-derived ingredi­ents: a widespread family of recipes with many local variants, appreciated for their gastronomic qualities (Green 2010; especially regarding Maya Mesoamerica, see McNeil 2006:Table 17 .11; Soleri and Cleveland 2007). Their ubiquity is also linked to the significance of those two plants in indige­nous Mesoamerica: maize is widely considered the source of life and fertility, often embodied in a maize deity (e.g., Sellen 2011); cacao is frequently associated with the underworld (e.g., Prufer and Hurst 2007) and the cycle that proceeds from death back to life and spiritual meaning (e.g., Martin 2006). In addition, the foam in these beverages is in itself a coveted element, perhaps related to its spiritual interpretation; a central concept in Zapotec worldview is that of pe, a life force present in all animated objects, said to explicitly include the foam atop a cacao beverage (e.g., Marcus 1978: 174). 
The study discussed here is one part of an inter­disciplinary project investigating the ethnographic, historical, and nutritional facets of such a bever­age, as well as its relationship with agrobiodiver­sity. This research begins to test the hypothesis that there is evidence of this type of beverage in the Postclassic archaeological record in a region where

a maize and cacao beverage, tejate, is today an iconic food of substantial cultural significance. To do this, we looked for positive evidence of both cacao and maize, as well as two other plants typi­cally used in tejate's contemporary preparation, Pouteria sapota and Quararibeafunebris. 
Tejate 
In the family of cacao beverages made with maize, the manner in which the grain is processed can dif­fer. For example, today in southern Mexico, house­holds may boil their maize to prepare atoles containing cacao; in Oaxaca, an atole-like bever­age called powntle includes the petiole of the vine cocolmecatl (Smilax spp) as a flavoring and foam­ing agent (Kennedy 20 10:327). Similarly, in the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, boiled maize, toasted cacao, cinnamon, and frangipani flowers (Plume­ria rubra L.) are used to make bu'pu (Musalem 2002). To make pinole, toasted maize is ground with cacao and other spices (Popenoe 1919). Maize is nixtamalized using calcium carbonate (lime) before grinding for powl (Javier 2000:35), and when making chorote,a fermented maize and cacao beverage in Tabasco (Castillo et al. 2005). Lime­nixtamalized maize is also used to make tascalate in Chiapas, which includes achiote (Bixa orellana) that also may be added as a foam-colorant for atoles as documented by Kennedy (2010:321). Other additives to maize and cacao beverages include chilis, vanilla, and honey and other ingredients such as those used in tejate. 
Tejate is a traditional, foam-topped beverage made from cacao, other plant-based ingredients, and maize that has been nixtamalized using ashes, not lime. Tejate is prepared in many of the Zapotec communities in the Valley of Oaxaca (Gonzalez 2006; Soleri et al. 2008), particularly in the Valley center and its Zimatlan and Tlacolula branches. Typical tejate ingredients include T. cacao and sometimes T. bicolor, pixtle-the seed of mamey (Pouteria sapota), and the aromatic blossoms of rosita de cacao (Quararibeafunebris). There are variants of this recipe, including the ones with coconut, walnuts, and peanuts; but for tejate made with maize-cacao,pixtle, and rosita de cacao are the most typical. All of those ingredients are indi­vidually toasted and then ground together to cre­ate a paste. Similarly, the ash-nixtamalized maize is washed, then ground into a paste and combined with the cacao mixture. Water is then gradually incorporated to produce a milky, foam-topped liq­uid that may be served for special occasions, includ­ing some Christian religious holidays such as Easter; and it also is served as a daily staple (Soleri et al. 2008) and is a significant source of energy in some rural households (Sotelo et al. 201 2). To pro­duce the desirable surface froth, a portion of tejate is often poured into the rest from a height, precisely as shown in Mesoamerican archaeological (e.g., Kerr and Kerr 2005) (Figure 1) and historical depic­tions (e.g., Sahagun 2012). 
Today in Oaxaca, tejate is served and consumed using decorated, hemispherical bowls or cups called jfcaras, which are made from tree gourds ( Crescentia cujete and C. alata) that are cut in half longitudinally. One jfcara is used for serving and often left floating on the surface of the tejate in the large bowl in which it was mixed, while other jfcaras are used for drinking. Some of highland Oaxaca's earliest pottery vessels have the same form, as if they were imitations of jfcaras (see Flan­nery and Marcus 1994: Fig. 7.3). The historic and contemporary association of jfcara vessels with maize beverages has been documented elsewhere in Mesoamerica (e.g., Ventura 1996). It is possible that tejate, or related beverages such as pawl, have been consumed since ancient times using jfcaras, even before ceramics were made. 
Archaeological Vessels in Oaxaca 
Approximately 3 ,500 years ago, people in the Val­ley of Oaxaca started making pottery vessels and using them for cooking and serving food (Flannery and Marcus 1994; Winter 1984). Initially, only two vessel forms were made: jars (alias) for cooking and perhaps storing food and water, and hemi­spherical bowls (cajetes semiesfericos), similar in form to jfcaras, which were used for serving food and liquids. We know that people at that time ate some domesticated plants, including maize, squash (Cucurbita pepo and/or argyrosperma) (Pipemo and Smith 2012), perhaps chili peppers (Capsicum annum) (Perry and Flannery 2007), and numerous other plants as well as animals obtained through gathering and hunting. Jars and bowls have per­sisted as the two basic vessel forms made and used in Oaxaca. Bowls have become elaborate, proba­bly in relation to the types of food and drink peo-

Figure 1. The "Princeton vase," a Classic period Mayan vessel decorated with a scene that includes the frothing of a cacao beverage by pouring the liquid into itself from a height (Kerr and Kerr 2005), in the same manner as tejate is frothed in the Valley of Oaxaca today (drawing copyright © 2000 by John Montgomery, after Kerr © KSll; © Foundation for the Advancement of Mesoamerican Studies, Inc., www.famsi.org; item JM03214; reprinted by permission). 
ple consumed, and also perhaps in relation to the context of use, whether as vessels for everyday domestic meals or special ceremonial occasions. 
One of the first changes in bowl form evident in the archaeological record in Oaxaca is the appearance around 1300 B.C. of flat-based coni­cal bowls ( cajetes c6nicos), probably used as serv­ing vessels, followed by the appearance of cylindrical bowls or cups ( vasos) around 1200 B .C. The cylinders may have been introduced to high­land Oaxaca via direct or indirect contact with the Olmecs who flourished from 1800-400 B .C. in the Gulf coast region of modem Veracruz and Tabasco (Winter and Blomster 2008), an area that has pro­duced evidence of early, continuous, and increas­ingly diversified use of liquid cacao at the first Olmec capital, San Lorenzo, in the Early Preclas­sic, starting in approximately 1800 B.C. (Powis et al. 2011). Some vasos from highland Oaxaca, dec­orated with Olmec style symbolic designs, may 
have been used in ritual settings for the consump­tion of a cacao drink, a hypothesis based on this history and on practices in the Gulf coast of mod­em Mexico (Winter and Blomster 2008). 
Another vessel form, the spout-handled jar (jarra con asa vertedera), appeared in highland Oaxaca during Late Preclassic times, around 300 
B.C. Residue analysis has shown that spout-han­dled vessels from the Maya area during this period were used for cacao (Powis et al. 2002). It seems likely that this vessel form served the same func­tion in Oaxaca. Spout-handled jars may have been introduced into highland Oaxaca from Chiapas by way of the southern Isthmus, where they are found commonly in the Late Preclassic Goma (400-200 B.C.) and Kuak (200 B.C.-A.D. I) phases. At Santo Domingo Tomaltepec in the Valley of Oaxaca, a high status Pe phase (300-IOO B.C.) tomb con­tained 22 spout-handled jars (Whalen 1981), pos­sibly contributed as burial offerings after being

used in the mortuary ceremony. Vasos and spout­handled vessels continued to be made and used in highland Oaxaca during the Classic period (A.D. 250-800), although they were not as common then as they were in earlier times. 
During the Postclassic (A.D. 800-1521), vari­ous common forms of serving vessels-plates with wide everted rims, hemispherical bowls, vertical­necked jars, and composite-silhouette bowls­appeared with long tripod supports sometimes ending in zoomorphic effigy heads, typically of serpents and occasionally of eagles. They com­monly occur in fine gray-paste ware and less fre­quently in elegant, highly decorated polychrome ware. Tripod, vertical-necked ollas are depicted in the codices containing frothy beverages. The Post­classic vessel forms common in the Valley of Oax­aca were the focus of our study. 
As mentioned earlier, previous studies of archaeological food residues have focused on ascertaining the presence or absence of a single plant species to provide insights into past dietary practices and diversity and to determine the earli­est use of a particular species. In contrast, this exploratory study starts with a nutritionally impor­tant and culturally iconic contemporary beverage and takes the first step of qualitatively investigat­ing the presence or absence of the key components of that recipe (maize and cacao) in a sample of rel­atively recent (Postclassic) archaeological vessels. 
Materials and Methods 
Vessel Identification and Sampling 
Postclassic vessels were selected for sampling for two reasons. First, it is not known when tejate was first made and consumed in Oaxaca; thus, the Post­classic is the archaeological period most likely to have continuity with the present day use of tejate, and so Postclassic vessels might offer a better chance for finding maize and cacao residues than vessels from earlier periods. 
We sought evidence of a widespread Mesoamer­ican recipe in the Postclassic archaeological record within the spatial distribution of a contemporary local variant of that recipe. We sampled vessels from sites in the Tlacolula Valley (eastern branch of the Valley of Oaxaca, see Figure 3), one of the two branches in which tejate is most commonly made today (Gonzalez 2006). San Andres Huaya­pan, at the western edge of the Tlacolula Valley, is where rosita de cacao trees are cultivated today, a further contemporary association with tejate. As such, ours is a reverse chronological approach to investigating the presence of tejate, or a similar bev­erage in the Oaxacan archaeological record. This strategy is similar to the Direct Historical Approach advocated by Marcus and Flannery ( 1994), which uses contemporary ethnographic information in part to guide archaeological investigation and inter­pretation. 
The second rationale for our sampling strategy is that Postclassic vessels presumably had been exposed to less post-depositional wear and weath­ering, and the vessels chosen, in particular, were excavated relatively recently and had not been too extensively cleaned. 
Samples were taken from complete or recon­structable vessels of known form found in primary, clearly documented contexts. Vessel 1 is a Pilitas polychrome (Lind 1987), vessels 2-6 are G.3M (Caso et al. 1967), and vessels 7 and 8 are Xoxo­cotlan polychrome (Winter 2004) (Table 1, Figure 2). Six of the eight prehispanic vessels (numbers 1--6) sampled come from sites in the Tlacolula Val­ley; the other two (numbers 7 and 8) are from the central area of the Valley of Oaxaca (Figure 3). 
All prehispanic vessels sampled are serving ves­sels, and, presumably, at least some were used to serve beverages, especially the vertical-necked tri­pod jars (vessels number 1 and 3) similar to those depicted in the codices. The contemporary vessel 9, a large bowl (cazuela), was used for five years to mix and serve tejate before it was acquired from a household in the Tlacolula area for this study. 
The assumption underlying archaeological residue sampling is that repeated preparation of particular foods results in some food compounds permeating the vessel walls, some persisting over long periods. Interiors of the vessels that we sam­pled were completely burnished and hard-fired, and all had been rinsed to some extent after initial recovery and so required scraping with a pointed steel blade to loosen material for sampling. The scrapings, in the form of powder, were collected in individual plastic Ziploc bags and labeled with the vessel's provenience data and a sample number. Each vessel was sampled twice, with two excep­tions: vessel 2 was inadvertently sampled three

After extracting a portion for methylxanthine detection, the remainder of each vessel's sample was sent to Steven R. Bozarth at the University of Kansas for phytolith analysis. 
Methylxanthine Detection 
Seeds and other parts of Theobroma species con­tain the methylxanthines theobromine (the most abundant in T. cacao and considered a marker for that species), caffeine and theophylline (Sotelo and Alvarez 1991). Theobroma species are the only known significant New World sources of theo­bromine and thus the species's presence in archae­ological vessels is considered diagnostic of Theobroma usage. The samples were analyzed for the presence of these methylxanthines using the high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS) technique developed by Hurst et al. (2002; Hurst 2006). Where there was sufficient sample, minimal amounts consisting of 50-100 mg were withdrawn from sample contain-

The ota.l ion chromatogram and selected ion chromatogram Wf!re mm1frored for each sample. Selected ion chromatograms at mass to charge ratio (m/z) 18 1 and 195 were used to monitor the (M+H)+ ion of the methylxanthines with m/z 181 used for theobromine and theophylline and m/z 195 used for caffeine. Although 181 is used for both theobromine and theophylline, these two com­pounds are separated chromatographically (the peaks are physically separated by time) to allow identification of each compound; the selected ion chromatogram at m/z 195 is unique for caffeine. Some have reported quantitative data in analyses of contemporary materials, but no quantitative data are provided in this study as the process of extract­ing methylxanthines from archaeological residues is affected by so many variables, and thus the most robust interpretation of those results is qualitative. 


Phytolith Detection 
Water taken up by plants contains dissolved silica, which then forms microscopic silica bodies by the partial or complete silicification of plant cells, cell walls, and intercellular spaces. In many species, the resulting silica bodies that have characteristic shapes and sizes are called opal phytoliths (Wild­ing and Drees 1971). Much of the early work on phytoliths was conducted by archaeologists work-

ing in Latin America and focused on maize (e.g., Pearsall 1978) because of that plant's regional importance. This work identified taxonomically distinct phytoliths as well as morphologically spe­
cific phytoliths within some species such as Z. mays (Pipemo 1984). 
The extraction procedure for phytolith analysis consisted of seven steps: ( 1) removal of carbonates with dilute hydrochloric acid; (2) removal of col­loidal organics, clays, and very fine silts by defloc­cul ation with sodium pyrophosphate, centrifugation, and decantation through a 7-micron filter; (3) oxidation of the sample to remove organ­ics; (4) heavy-liquid flotations of phytoliths from the heavier elastic mineral fraction using zinc bro­mide concentrated to specific gravity of 2.4; (5) washing and dehydration of phytoliths with butanol; and 6) dry storage in 1-dram vials. 
After thorough mixing, all or part of the phy­tolith isolate was mounted on a microscope slide in immersion oil under a 24 x 40 mm or 18 mm circular cover glass (depending on the size of iso­late) and sealed with clear nail lacquer. One com­plete slide per sample was scanned with a Zeiss microscope at a magnification of 625X for eco­nomic species. 
Phytoliths were taxonomically classified based on phytolith systematics reported by Piperno (2006) and analysis of the University of Kansas phytolith reference collection of Central American flora, originally established for an archaeological study in Costa Rica (Bozarth 1993b). The phytolith reference collection currently consists of 47 arbo­real species and 22 herbs for a total of 114 refer­ence slides of leaves, fruits, and tubers. 
In addition to the vessel residues, samples of a complete contemporary Pouteria sapota seed and Quararibea funebris flowers from Oaxaca were also processed for developing phytolith reference slides using a procedure based on oxidation in Schulze's reagent in a hot water bath (Bozarth 1997).

Of the nine samples in this study, the results of the HPLC-MS analyses indicated the presence of both theobromine and caffeine visualized as MS chro­matogram peaks at m/z 181 and 195, respectively, in extracts of residues from vessels 1 and 5, both from the Tlacolula branch of the Valley of Oaxaca, and vessel 7 from the central portion of the Valley of Oaxaca (Figure 4). Theophylline was not pre­sent in detectable levels in any of the samples.

Phytoliths 
Phytoliths were well preserved in seven of the nine vessels sampled (Table 2). The exceptions were ves­sel 6, from which the smallest sample ( .01 gm) was received, and the contemporary vessel. Neither the Pouteria sapota seed nor the Quararibea fanebris flowers produced diagnostic phytoliths in this study. 
Most of the phytoliths in the vessel samples were formed in native grasses that presumably found their way into the vessels during post-depo­sitional processes. However, diagnostic maize cob phytoliths were identified in vessels 1, 2, and 5, strongly indicating that maize kernels in some form, along with some chaff, were repeatedly prepared or placed in the vessels (Figure 5). Moreover, the presence of one large Variant 1 cross in vessel 2 and one ridged bilobate with notched sides in ves­sel 3 indicate the use of maize husks/leaves, per­haps as cooking wrappers or to clean the vessels. 
Two types of palm phytoliths were identified, including one spinulose sphere, each in vessels 2 and 5; and in vessel 5, two "hat-shaped" phytoliths, associated with the closely related Bactris-and Acrocomia-type palms. One possible scenario is that these vessels were used to serve palm wine, as well as other beverages. The carbohydrate-rich sap fromAcrocomia aculeata fruit is fermented to pro­duce a palm wine sold in Honduras (Henderson et al. 1995), and the presence of "hat-shaped" phy­toliths in this type of palm wine has been experi­mentally established (Bozarth 2005). 
Thus, this study found evidence of the presence of both maize and Theobroma species in the residues collected from the interior of two of the vessels in our sample, both from the Tlacolula branch of the Valley of Oaxaca: vessel 1-a tripod Pilitas polychrome vertical-necked jar from Macuilx6chitl, and vessel 5-a tripod composite, two-toned G.3M grayware bowl from Xaaga. 
Discussion and Conclusions 
To our knowledge, this study is the first investiga­tion into the presence of markers for Theobroma species in residues from archaeological vessels in Oaxaca, Mexico. Maize cob phytoliths were found in abundance in a stratum dating to A .D. 620-7 40 of the Guila Naquitz cave near Mitla, Oaxaca (Pipemo and Flannery 2001), but we know of no other published research on maize phytoliths in archaeological vessels and other implements in that region. We are aware of only one other investiga­tion into the presence of both Theobroma species 
and maize in archaeological vessels (Seinfeld 2007). In that study, residues from two of the 26 Olmec vessels sampled from the "Early Franco era (700-550/500 B.C.)" of the San Andres site near La Venta in Tabasco, Mexico, tested positive for markers of both maize and cacao. 
Our objective was to begin testing the hypoth­esis that there is evidence in the Postclassic archae­ological record of the regionally and locally significant family of cacao and maize beverages. Analyses of residues from inside eight Postclassic and one contemporary vessel from the Valley of Oaxaca were positive forthe presence of both theo­bromine and caffeine in three vessels, and for maize

Although used for frequent tejate preparation for five years immediately prior to being sampled for this study, it appears that the green, high-gloss glaze finish of the contemporary vessel (#9) prevented absorption of detectable evi­dence of either maize or Theobroma species. 
Admittedly, one contemporary and eight archae­ological vessels comprise a small sample, smaller than similar studies of vessel residues in Mesoamer­ica and what is now the U.S. southwest. However, a recent study of residues in archaeological vessels from the U.S. southeast had the same sample size­ei g ht beakers (Crown et al. 2012).

for theobromine, we believe the findings of the present study are useful. While we cannot demon­strate clear patterns of vessel use, the associated materials and context of those vessels testing pos­itive for both cacao and maize provide insights. 
Vessel 1 is a Late Postclassic (Chila phase) Pili­tas polychrome tripod olla found not far below the surface in association with a residence, probably a medium-to high-status palace, built on the top of Mound 35, a Late Classic (Xoo phase) structure at Macuilx6chitl. The vessel was found by itself (Fea­ture 12), but other Chila phase vessels occurred within a general area of about 3 m2 and may have formed part of a single offering in the residential patio. 
Vessel 5 was found in association with a Late Postclassic (Chila phase) commoner residence at Xaaga near Mitla. It was part of Feature 1, a con­centration of 23 ceramic vessels, one hammerstone,

one chert bifacial (sacrificial) knife, and bones of a human child found in a residential patio. Vessel 5 is a two-tone gray tripod, composite-silhouette bowl about the same size as the large jicaras used today for tejate consumption. The vessel was found in an upright (normal) position with another similar ves­sel inverted and covering it, sometimes referred to as a lip-to-lip cache. Such caches have been found in a number of Mayan sites. Mathews and Garber (2004) describe an Early Classic cache from the Blackman Eddy site in Belize that consisted of lip­to-lip bowls, the lower one containing nine chert flakes, white marl, burned twigs, and a small rodent skeleton. They relate this cache to the vertical order­ing of the universe in layers of underworld, earth (in the middle), and upper world (Mathews and Garber 2004:53). Cached vessels distributed on a single plane in a quadripartite arrangement sym­bolize the horizontal world. Vessels were cached by both commoners and elites and functioned to "sanc­tify the utilization of space" (Mathews and Garber 2004: 56). Such an ordering of the universe proba­bly goes back to Olmec times and may be expressed differently by distinct ethnic and linguistic groups. Paired vessel caches from Oaxaca, known from sites in the Valley of Oaxaca and in the MixtecaAlta may have analogous meanings. Lind and Urcid (2010:275-277) have noted that during the Late Classic period, pairs of vessels in this position found in house patios may have been ritual burials of umbilical cords of babies born in the households. Feature 1 is from a later period and so may be a dif­ferent kind of offering. Further research is required to determine the chronology and relationship, if any, between the presence of maize and cacao markers and other possible uses and significance of this ves­sel type and configuration. 
Although no maize phytoliths were found in vessel 7, it did test positive for cacao. Vessels 7 and 8 are from the same Late Postclassic (Chila phase), relatively high-status tomb found at Xoxocotlan in the Valley center; vessel 8 was negative for both maize and cacao. Vessel 7 is a bichrome, small tri­pod bowl (more similar to vessel 8 in this study than to the other contemporaneous tripod vertical­necked alias, vessels 1-4). The tomb contained many vessels, possibly produced specifically for the offering and so used for a limited time before deposition. Thus, while one of the two vessels test­ing positive for both cacao and maize in this study 
was from a commoner, non-elite context (#5), and 
the other from a high-status context (# 1 ), as was 
another vessel testing positive solely for cacao (#7), 
still they all are thought to have been associated 
with ritual events. 
This is the first study of its kind in Oaxaca; until 
now, the handling of archaeological artifacts has 
not been conducted specifically with residue analy­
sis in mind, and so the possibility of contamina­
tion must be acknowledged. Vessels 1-6 were 
excavated and partly cleaned (leaving the inside 
basal part incompletely cleaned for future sam­
pling) and stored in plastic bags inside boxes in 
the Centro Oaxaca of the Instituto Nacional de 
Antropologia e Historia (INAH) laboratories in 
Cuilapan. Vessels 7 and 8 were excavated, then 
cleaned and restored and studied. They were also 
stored in bags and boxes in the same INAH labo­
ratories, but had been examined by more people 
over the years and contamination is more likely 
with these than with the others. After acquisition 
from the family that used it for tejate preparation, 
vessel 9 was stored in a plastic bag to prevent con­
tamination. Thus, while post-excavation contam­
ination cannot be unequivocally ruled out, it is 
heartening to note that the vessels testing positive 
for both maize and cacao were among those least 
likely to have been exposed to contamination. 
Investigation of recipes in the archaeological record requires the capacity to detect multiple ingredients and confirm their simultaneous depo­sition; our study was able to address only the first requirement. At this point, our presumption that detection of both maize and cacao represents con­temporaneous use of those ingredients can only be tentatively supported, let alone the further hypoth­esis that they were ingredients in the same recipe. Still, our results provide the best available evidence of the presence of a cacao and maize beverage of the type found throughout Mesoamerica today, and it sets the stage for more extensive studies. How­ever, the Pouteria sapota seed and Quararibea funebris blossom samples did ot produce phy­toliths in this study, and so further research will be required to determine whether phytoliths or other persistent, diagnostic markers for those character­istic ingredients of tejate can be identified. Thus, while our results suggest support for some form of cacao and maize beverage, there is no evidence for modem tejate per se, and the ubiquity of variants

of maize and cacao beverages in modern Mesoamerica, including Oaxaca, means there are a number of possible alternatives. 
Detecting multiple ingredients in some cases requires the capacity to distinguish ingredients derived from closely related species. It is not yet possible to discern which Theobroma species was, or were, the source of the theobromine detected in this study, although contemporary, historical, and chemical data provide insights. Today, some com­munities use Theobroma bicolor in their tejate preparation, in addition to T. cacao (Soleri and Cleveland 2007; Soleri et al. 2008; Sotelo et al. 20 12). The use of T. bicolor in Mesoamerica appears ancient, but at this time it is difficult to dis­tinguish from T. cacao in the archaeological record (Kufer and McNeil 2006). In contrast, there is his­torical evidence that a beverage containing both T. cacao and T. bicolor was present in what is now Mexico in the late sixteenth century (Hernandez 2000: 109). While theobromine is diagnostic for all Theobromaspecies, in the future, quantitative stud­ies of the ratio of theobromine to caffeine may pro­vide further useful information for distinguishing it among those species. This ratio is often stated to be 10.0: 1.0 in T. cacao (Hurst 2006; Hurst et al. 2002), although studies of contemporary samples of fermented seeds report substantially varying ratios: for two different varieties of T. cacao 1.6: 1.0 and 11.2: 1.0, T. bicolor 10.4: 1.0, and T. angusti­
folium 8.3: 1.0 (Sotelo and Alvarez 1991); for T. cacao 10.9: 1.0 and T. grandiflorum 2.0: 1.0 (Lo Coco et al. 2007). Another potential source of vari­ation in the ratio of those methylxanthines in detec­tion studies is the recent observation that caffeine may be preferentially extracted from archaeologi­cal vessel residues or washes, presumably because theobromine is bound more tightly to clay mole­cules in the vessel walls (Washburn et al. 2011). Development of precise, sensitive quantitative markers to determine this ratio in the small sam­ples available from archaeological sources will be valuable for Theobroma species differentiation. However, work remains to be done to take into account the possible sources of variation in this ratio that cannot be attributed to consistent species dif­ferences. 
Based on the positive results obtained here, we see three broad areas for future research to achieve a more profound and complex understanding of ancient cacao and maize foods in the Valley of Oax­aca. The first should be constructing a history of beverages containing cacao and other ingredients in the Valley of Oaxaca involving investigation of more diverse vessel forms, including those from earlier periods, especially those forms associated with cacao in other parts of Mesoamerica, such as vasos and spout-handled jars. Development of non­invasive, inexpensive,rapid methods will be impor­tant and may include sampling by washing vessel interiors as was recently done for methylxanthine detection (Washburn et al. 2011). One challenge is that until recently, standard protocol was to clean excavated artifacts as well as possible without being mvas1ve. 
Our second suggestion for future research is identification of durable, precise markers for ingre­dients characteristic of locally important variants of cacao and maize beverages, or for food pro­cessing that may distinguish some recipes. Exam­ples include phytoliths or other markers for characteristic ingredients, such as Pouteria sapota, Quararibea funebris, Bixa orellana, Plumeria rubra, or Smilax spp; or for differential mineral con­tent in ash versus lime nixtamalized maize (e.g., Pappa et al. 2010) and maize that has not been treated in either manner; or molecular markers for microorganisms associated with traditional fer­mentation (e.g., Cavalieri et al. 2003). 
The third research area is investigating the archaeological and historical evidence for the rela­tionship between diet, especially maize and cacao consumption and social class. Joyce and Hender­son (2010: 171-2) noted that Mesoamerican soci­eties following the Olmec have 
reshaped their heritage in ways that undoubt­edly affected such fundamental daily practices as meals, and that must have changed the com­mon experience of the meal as part of the struc­turing of social differences we now recognize as separating nobles and other villagers, farm­ers and urban citizens. 
One window onto this social structuring may be the presence or absence of the maize and cacao combinations and variations of recipes in archae­ological periods and contexts. Examples of possi­ble approaches include qualitative studies of larger samples within a time period and geographic area, such as the Tlacolula branch of the Valley of

Oaxaca, including both utilitarian, quotidian and elite ceremonial vessels. The primary method­ological challenges involve the development of methods to determine (a) the probability that mark­ers of recipe ingredients were deposited contem­poraneously and (b) provide credible estimates of markers, and thus ingredient density, and so rela­tive amounts of ingredients. Methods such as the "bulk stable carbon isotope analysis" for relative quantitative detection of C4 plant (i.e., maize) residues exist (e.g., Seinfeld 2007), although recent findings indicate that C isotopes may not be appro­priate for accurate identification of past presence and density of maize (Warinner et al. 20 13). The right methods could provide insights into whether these beverages were widely consumed by all classes, or evolved from (or occurred simultane­ously as) a cacao-rich specialty of the elite to a maize-dominated staple of the laboring classes, fla­vored with cacao and other plant substances. 
Association of cacao-rich beverages with the elite and powerful classes is indicated by early images representing the preparation and serving of these beverages in Mesoamerica. Sahagun (2000:919) supports this association, stating that "cacao lindo" was a beverage consumed only by the elite ("solo las seftores") if made correctly, that is, without much added maize or water. He goes on to describe as poor and inferior the cacao bever­ages made with too much of these additives, includ­ing that their foam fails to mount and persist on the surface. 
Contemporary use certainly suggests a social structuring, although a changing one. Variation can be observed in the type of cacao beverage present, as well as variants on a single recipe. Interestingly, the two common forms of cacao beverage in this part of the Valley of Oaxaca are prepared in the two oldest primary vessel forms in the area. Today, T. cacao typically combined with water, sugar, 
-
almonds, and cinnamon and prepared in a ceramic olla as a hot morning beverage (chocolate)-is con­sumed widely in the Valley of Oaxaca and beyond, in urban and rural areas. In contrast, tejate plays a distinct role as a cool, refreshing, and fortifying beverage prepared in a bowl, most often consumed during the day and traditionally associated with those who perform hard physical labor in the coun­tryside (Soleri et al. 2008). Tejate may indeed be a more palatable form of maize consumption than tortillas when daytime temperatures are high-for example, during maize harvest. However, both the loss of tejate in rural areas as traditions fade, and its increasing consumption in urban areas as a result of increasing cultural pride in traditional foods reflect social changes (Soleri et al. 2008). 
Variations of tejate recipes for different con­sumers have been observed today. For example, recent data on the chemical and nutritional compo­sition of 14 tejate samples (Sotelo et al. 2012) found variations in recipes and relative proportions of ingredients, and identified significant differences in methylxanthine content between tejate made for home consumption and tejate made for commer­cial sale (Table 4). It is not difficult to imagine that even small amounts of Theobroma species seeds would have been considered a desirable ingredient in simple maize-based beverages in the past for both cultural and gastronomic reasons, although their effect would depend significantly on the amount and

species used. The fat would have contributed to the production of highly valued foam, and the methylx­anthines could have provided mild stimulation. 
The story of how and why maize and cacao bev­erages such as tejate were transformed from a food of the elite, often associated with ceremonial cir­cumstances, to a staple of rural farming commu­nities has much to tell us. We believe that the three goals of constructing a history of cacao beverage recipes in the Valley of Oaxaca; identification of markers for other recipe ingredients and processes; investigation of the relationship between diet ( espe­cially recipes) and social class can build on this and other studies. In so doing, pursuit of these three research goals will contribute to a more nuanced understanding of cacao and maize consumption in the ancient Valley of Oaxaca in particular, and Mesoamerica in general, including insights into the significance of their variations across time and across social landscapes.
