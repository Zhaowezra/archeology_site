We analyzed strontium isotopes in more than 500 samples of shell, bone, and dental enamel from modern and archaeolog­ical contexts throughout Mesoamerica. The results correspond closely with expectations based upon the local geology and earlier measurements of geological materials. The results show that isotopic variation is significant across Mesoamerica. Thus strontium isotope ratios in dental enamel, which mark the place of childhood residence, can be used not only to doc­ument mobility but also in some cases to determine geographic origin. We present five archaeological case studies to illus­trate the anthropological significance and range of applications for this technique: the origins of individuals in the "Oaxaca Barrio" at Teotihuacan, a northern origin for the founder of Copan, a local king at Tikal, the regional origin of two of Palenque's rulers, and individuals of African birth in a colonial cemetery in Campeche. 
Se evaluaron las proporciones isot6picas de estroncio en mas de quinientas muestras f6siles y modernas de concha, hue so y esmalte dental, colectadas en numerosos sitios de toda Mesoamerica. Los resultados refiejan estrechamente las expectativas fundamentadas en la geologfa local y algunas medidas previas que habian sido obtenidas de diferentes sustratos geol6gicos. Los presentes datos se emplearan en el diseiio de un mapa rector que mostrara pan-regionalmente los rangos de relaci6n isot6pica de estroncio. Se puede utilizarse el analisis de las proporciones isot6picas de estroncio en el esmalte dental, el cual retiene las caracteristicas del lugar de nacimientos, no solo para investigar aspectos genera/es de movilidad, sino tambien para determinar el origen geografico de un individuo. Aqui se presentan cinqo estudios de caso arqueol6gicos que ilustran la relevancia y gama de aplicaciones de esta tecnica: los origenes de los individuos de/ "Barrio Oaxaqueiio" en Teotihuacan; la procedencia de el fundador de/ linaje dinastico de Copan, de! no rte; el origen intra-regional de la "Reina Roja" de Palenque y de Janaab' Pakal; asi como la identificaci6n de esclavos oriundos de A.frica en un cementerio colonial de Campeche.

Price et al. 1994a, 1994b, 2000, 2001, 2004, 2006; Dental enamel is almost exclusively composed Sealy et al. 1995). In some areas, such as of the mineral known as hydroxylapatite, or Mesoamerica, it is possible not only to identify hydroxy-calcium phosphate (Ca10(P04)(0H)2).

88Sr (82.58 percent). The relative abundances of 84Sr, 86Sr, and 88Sr are invariant, but 87Sr can be pro­duced by beta decay from 87Rb, with a half-life of 4.88x l010 years (Neumann and Huster 1974). The relative abundance of87Sr, commonly expressed as the ratio of 87Sr /86Sr, varies according to both the original Rb/Sr ratio and the sample age (Faure and Mensing 2005). 
Due to the extremely long half-life of 87Rb, "age" here refers to geologic time-scales. Radi­ogenic 87Sr-and hence 87Sr !86Sr-is much higher in ancient, high-rubidium rocks, such as granite, than in young (<100 M.Y.) rocks with lower orig­inal Rb/Sr, such as limestone. While metamorphic rocks older than a billion years can have 87Sr /86Sr exceeding .720, such ratios are rare in marine sed­iments and volcanic rocks younger than 100 mil­lion years, which generally range from. 704 to. 709. Such differences might seem small, but they are large compared to local variability, which rarely exceeds ±.001, and to the precision with which 87Sr /86Sr can be measured, i.e., better than ±.00001. 
Because of the long half-life of 87Rb, 87Sr/86Sr incorporated into dental enamel does not change during the life of an individual or in the time scale of human prehistory. Plants assimilate the locally available strontium essentially unchanged, and in turn reflect the underlying geology (Blum et al. 2000; Graustein 1989; Price et al. 2000). Likewise, the 87Sr/86Sr of dental enamel reflects the 87Sr/86Sr ratio of the diet during enamel formation, i.e., dur­ing the first few years of an individual's life. Thus, analysis of 87Sr/86Sr in tooth enamel provides the ratio set by geology of the place of childhood res­idence, even though an individual might have moved substantial distances during his/her lifetime. 
Bones, in contrast to teeth, continue to exchange calcium and strontium with the environment dur­ing the life of an individual. Bone 87Sr/86Sr changes if there is a move of residence to a region with con­trasting geology. 
A significant difference between bone and enamel 87Sr/86Sr is thus evidence for change in res­idence. The turnover of strontium in bone, however, is slow, with a half-life of seven or more years depending upon the particular bone and type of tis­sue. Although teeth retain the 87Sr/86Sr characteris­tic of the childhood residence, unless the individual moved at a sufficiently early age for the bones to fully equilibrate to the Sr ratio for new location, bones will likely have a 87Sr!86Sr ratio intermediate between those of the two locations. Unlike ename bones are also easily affected by diagenetic conta­mination, accumulating to an indeterminate extent strontium from the burial environment (Budd et al. 2000; Kohn et al. 1999; Lee-Thorp and Sponheimer 2003; Schoeninger et al. 2003). 

In order to provide a brief background on the environments of Mesoamerica relevant to such strontium isotope studies of migration, we discuss the general geology of major regions of archaeo­logical interest: the Maya area of the Yucatan, Guatemala, and Honduras, and the Central High­lands of Mexico. Following a brief description of analytical methods, we present several examples of how isotopic variation in these regions can be used to track human mobility. 
Geology of Mesoamerica 
The limestone shelf of the Peten and the Yucatan Peninsula dominates the geology of the Maya area. The oldest limestones, of Cretaceous age, are found in the southernmost part of the peninsula. The lime­stone becomes younger as one proceeds northwards through Eocene carbonates in the southern low­lands and Miocene carbonates in the northern peninsula to the youngest Quaternary rocks on the northern periphery and along the coasts. These rocks are predominately calcium carbonate, high in strontium deposited from the ocean at the time of formation of the rock. Because of an age­dependent trend in marine carbonates, their Sr iso­topic characteristics can be directly inferred from 
the well-defined Cretaceous-to-Quaternary seawa­ter 87Sr/86Sr ratios (Hess et al. 1986). Thus, the 87Sr/86Sr ratios increase northwards from approxi­mately . 7070 in the southern Cretaceous carbon­ates to .7092 in the latest Quaternary deposits of the northern coasts (Hodell et al. 2004). 
The carbonate-dominated low lands are bounded to the south by the young volcanic rocks of the Guatemalan highlands. The highlands have much lower 87Sr/86Sr ratios, approximating .704-.706, which are characteristic of young Cordilleran vol­canic rocks throughout Mesoamerica (Torres­Alvarado et al. 2000). The southern Pacific slopes of the volcanic highlands are likewise derived from these rocks and have similar isotope ratios (pre­sented below).
