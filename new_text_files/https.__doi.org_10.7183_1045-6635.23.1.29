THE HYDROAR CHAEOLOGICAL ME THOD: 
A CASE STUDY AT THE MAYA SITE OF PALENQUE 

Kirk D. French, Christopher J. Duffy, and Gopal Bhatt 
This research consists mainly of introducing the hydroarchaeological method, especially as related to issues of drought. The article outlines how this multidisciplinary method can provide insights into the success and failures of an archaeolog­ical site, in this case the Maya site of Palenque. We also detail convincing evidence that shows that the Maya of Palenque did not leave their city because of deficiencies of water, as some paleoclimatologists and archaeologists have asserted. The 
first logical step toward understanding any settlement's water system is to use basic hydrologic methods and theory and to understand the local watershed. There is great potential.for watershed-climate modeling in developing plausible scenarios of water use and supply and of the effect of extreme conditions (flood and drought), all of which cannot be fully represented bv atmosphere-based climate and weather projections. The research demonstrates how the local watershed, land-use, and 
ecological conditions interact with regional climate changes. The archaeological implications for this noninvasive "vir­tual" method are many, including detecting periods of stress within a community, estimating population by developing caps based on the availability of water, and understanding settlement patterns, as well as assisting present local populations in understanding their water cycle. 
El objetivo principal de esta investigaci6n es la introducci6n del metodo hidroarqueol6gico, especialmente en lo relacionado a temas como la sequfa. El art{culo describe c6mo este metodo multidisciplinario ayuda a entender las causas del exito y fracaso de un sitio arqueol6gico, en este caso, de! sitio maya de Palenque. Tambien detallamos evidencia convincente que muestra que-a diferencia de lo que algunos paleoclimat6logos y arque6logos han afirmado-los mayas de Palenque no abandonaron su ciudad debido a escasez de agua. El primer paso l6gico para entender el sistema hidraulico de cualquier asentamiento es usar la teor{a y metodos hidrol6gicos basicos, y conocer la cuenca hidrol6gica local. Existe un gran poten­cial para Los modelos climatol6gicos-hidrol6gicos para proporcionar posibles escenarios de uso y abasto de agua, y los efec­tos de posibles condiciones extremas (inundaci6n y sequfa), todo lo cual no puede ser representado totalmente mediante pron6sticos del tiempo y del clima que se basan en la atm6sfera unicamente. Esta investigaci6n demuestra c6mo interactuan las cuencas locales, el uso de la tierra y las condiciones ecol6gicas, con Los cambios climaticos regionales. Las implica­ciones arqueol6gicas de este metodo no-invasivo "virtual" son muchas, incluyendo: la detecci6n de periodos de estres en el interior de una comunidad; la estimaci6n de la poblaci6n al disefiar topes de crecimiento basados en la disponibilidad de agua; la comprensit5n de los patrones de asentamiento; as{ como la asistencia a las poblaciones actuales en la localidad para el entendimiento de su ciclo de agua.

of "urban" growth led to predictable changes in land cover. 
The desire to understand the effects of land­cover change on the availability of water for an ancient city prompted us to implement a spatially distributed hydrologic model. The hydroarchaeo­logical method utilizes simulated daily paleocli­matic data, watershed modeling, and archaeology to explore the response to ancient human impact on a watershed. There is great potential for dis­tributed watershed modeling in developing plausi­ble scenarios of water use and supply and of the effect of extreme conditions (flood and drought), all of which cannot be fully represented by atmos­phere-based climate and weather projections or by lumped hydro logic models. One outcome of these simulations is the demonstration that distributed land-cover change is a principal factor in watershed response to climatic inputs. 
Palenque's environmental setting is very differ­ent from those found elsewhere in the Maya Low­lands. In general, the development of other large Maya centers in the region was constrained by low topographic relief with limited year-round water supplies. At these sites broad, flat depressions, called bajos, served to hold water during the rainy season. Their builders took advantage of occasional well-drained low-relief upland areas of the Maya lowland, and as a result cities such as Tikal and Calakmul grew in a broadly dispersed or rambling pattern that follows the terrain. Scarborough (2003, 2008) describes such centers as "labortasking," referring to the investment in highly efficient labor divisions that are generally the case for "still-water systems." On the other hand, the inhabitants of Palenque had to adapt their burgeoning settlement to a small and steep geomorphological space (ca. 
2.2 km2). This setting created a much more con­fined and crowded settlement pattern than that of most other Maya centers. 
Although the steep terrain at Palenque provided an abundant year-round water supply from the spring-fed streams that naturally divided the land­scape, it also contributed to the difficulties of con­structing buildings on Palenque' s spatially confined plateau. George Andrews (1975) claimed that this irregular natural terrain caused many prob­lems for the city's builders, who were forced to reshape the existing topography in order to main­tain a semblance of visual order within the site cen­ter. To meet the challenge of simultaneously controlling flooding, reducing erosion, and bridg­ing divided civic space, the Maya of Palenque cov­ered portions of the existing streams by constructing elaborate subterranean aqueducts that guided the water beneath plaza floors. This tech­nique expanded the size of their plazas by 23 per­cent (French 2007).

The abundance of flowing water and the con­fined, steep terrain led to the unique method of set­tlement and construction at Palenque. It is clear that the Palencanos were challenged to modify their landscape in order to take advantage of hydrolog­ical resources and to accommodate their growing city. It was this urban challenge that resulted in a set of complex engineering adaptations unlike those found anywhere else in the Maya Lowlands or indeed in Mesoamerica. This brand of compact, extratropical urbanism fits Scarborough's (2003, 2008) model of "technotasking," an established societal investment in technology with a central­ization of resources. 
Environmental Setting 
The Palencanos built their city on a narrow lime­stone shelf approximately 150 m above the plains of Tabasco, which stretch north to the Gulf of Mex­ico. There were many advantages to choosing this particular area. For one, the high escarpment afforded a good defensive position, a particularly important consideration in Classic times when war­fare was increasingly frequent. Attackers from the east, west, or south would have been confronted with a series of steep and treacherous mountains. Alternatively, an assault from the north would have been detected early due to the commanding view the Palencanos had of the plains below. 
An even greater advantage for early settlers was the presence of many natural springs. As in many cultures, water possessed both a practical and sym­bolic value for the Maya. Palenque's natural topog­raphy mimics the Maya image of the place of creation, described in the Maya epic Popol Vuh as the land where waters flow out of the mountains: "The channels of water were separated; their branches wound their ways among the mountains" (Tedlock 1985:74). Provided that this view of cre­ation was held by the Classic Maya, a landscape such as this would have been emblematic to the early settlers of Palenque. 
Practically speaking, freshwater and the rains that supplied it were vital for sustenance. Precipi­tation in the Maya Lowlands is generally seasonal, with the lowest rainfall from December to May (40-250 mm per month) and a rainy season from June through November (300-550 mm a month). October is the wettest month, and April, the driest. 
Total annual rainfall for the western periphery of 
the Maya Lowlands ranges from about 1,500 mm 
a year at the Gulf of Mexico to nearly 3,200 mm a 
year in the foothills of the Sierra de Chiapas at 
Palenque. This abundance of precipitation still falls 

short of records in such areas as the Maya Moun­
tains in Belize, which can receive a staggering 4,000 
mm of rainfall per year (Dunning et al. 1998). 
According to Magana et al. (1999), the annual cycle 
of precipitation over the Palenque area exhibits a 
bimodal distribution, with maxima during June and 
September-October and a relative minimum dur­
ing July and August. The latter is known as the mid­
summer drought or canfcula. The canfcula is 
associated with fluctuations in the intensity and 
location of the eastern Pacific intertropical con­
vergence zone. Tropical cyclones are the source of 
heavy precipitation in summer and fall. At Palenque 
convective precipitation and orographic influence 
(moist warm air encounters a mountain barrier, and 
the air cools and condenses as it rises and precipi­
tates as rain) are also significant with increasing dis­
tance from the Gulf of Mexico. The average 
temperature at Palenque ranges from 22.9°C in 
December and January to 28.8°C in May. The great 
rivers in the region, the Usumacinta and Grijalva, 
discharge 30 percent of the total freshwater flow 
of Mexico. 

The critical role of drought to our arguments requires that we distinguish among hydrological, meteorological, and agricultural droughts. A mete­orological drought is defined on the basis of the atmospheric conditions and the duration of the dry period (and reduced precipitation [Palmer 1965)). For example, meteorological droughts identify periods of drought on the basis of the number of days with precipitation less than some specified threshold. A hydrological drought is associated with the terrestrial effects of periods with shortfalls of surface or subsurface water supply (i.e., stream­
flow, reservoir and lake levels, groundwater, etc.) that may or may not be the result of reduced pre­cipitation (Tallaksen and van Lanen 2004). The fre­quency and severity of the drought are defined relative to its effect on the watershed or river basin. Clearly, hydrological droughts can cause severe problems for local populations. An agricultural or ecological drought links various characteristics of meteorological and hydrological droughts to agri­cultural or ecological impacts, such as reduced

availability of soil moisture for plant and crop evap­otranspiration (Palmer 1965). Demand for water depends on the stage of growth, prope1ties of the soil, and prevailing weather conditions. At Palenque there are three main issues with regard to various forms of drought: (1) water for agricultural pro­duction, (2) water for household consumption, and 
(3) water control to reconfigure and protect the urban landscape. These will be discussed in tum. 
Agricultural Resources at Pale111que 
Agricultural production was confined to the allu­vial soils in the plains to the north of Palenque (Liendo 1999). The problems in the agricultural manipulation of the plains were seasonal flooding and meteorological/agricultural drought. The rainy season transformed the area into a wetland, while the winter drought created unsuitable conditions for large-scale maize production. These problems were solved with the construction of channelized fields (Liendo 1999; Figure 2). 
Channelized fields serve two main functions: drainage and drainage-irrigation (Siemens and Pules ton 1972; Turner and Harrison 1983 ). Drainage functions imply the removal of standing water from wetland areas through the digging of canals or ditches to drain water. Drainage-irriga­tion implies the manipulation of water table levels both within the canals and on field surfaces (Denevan and Turner 1985). Excavations of the channelized fields in Palenque during the 1990s by Rodrigo Liendo (1999) showed that the canals worked fine as devices to get rid of excess water during the rainy season by lowering the water table of the agricultural fields. He also found that dur­ing the dry season the canals seem to have main­tained a permanent level of water, avoiding loss into the nearby Michol River. This occurred because of the narrowing of the canal as it gets closer to the river, suggesting the probable use of gates to obstruct the flow. Water retention and drainage would have allowed for year-round use of these fields (Liendo 1999). 
Maize was the Maya staple and constituted 70 percent of the diet (Reed 1998). Based on a 2,200­calorie diet, each Palencano required 1,540 calo­ries from maize per day. According to Barnhart (2001), an average of 5,183 people lived in Palenque. In order to fulfill the annual caloric requirements for the inhabitants of Palenque, 275 ha of land had to be under cultivation based on two harvests per year. Yet an estimated 3,000 ha of agri­cultural area existed, and of that, approximately 500 ha of channelized fields were excavated by Liendo (1999). A channelized field system that enabled year-round use might help explain Palenque's regional influence. Simultaneous production of all 500 ha of the channelized fields would have pro­duced enough maize to support a population of approximately 8,000. Failure of this system could have contributed to Palenque's abandonment in 
A.D. 799, an issue addressed later in this article. 
Paleoclimate 
Maya archaeologists and paleoecologists have long hypothesized an intimate relationship between cli­mate change and ancient lowland Maya cultural dynamics (e.g., Dahlin 1983; Dahlin et al. 1987; Folan et al. 1983; Gunn and Adams 198 I). Many of these early hypotheses are speculative because they rested on untested long-distance associations between the Maya region and Europe, where cli­mate change is better documented (Dahlin I 983; Folan et al. 1983; Gunn and Adams 1981 ). Given the speculative nature of this early work, it was not widely accepted by Maya archaeologists until Hodell et al. ( 1995) presented local evidence from cores in Laguna Chichancanab in the northern part of the Yucatan Peninsula for a prolonged episode of severe hydrological droughts (megadroughts) coincident with the collapse of lowland Classic Maya civilization. Gunn and colleagues (Gunn and Folan 2000; Gunn et al. I995) utilized a combina­tion of paleovolcanism and solar energy output to infer past mean global temperatures. Next, using modem discharge data from three watersheds in the southwestern Maya Lowlands along with the pale­oclimate data, they reconstructed the total discharge of the Candelaria River for the last 3,000 years. Their projections of a second-century drought were confirmed by the Chichancanab lake cores (Hodell et al. 2001; Hodell et al. 2005) and more recently by speleothem analysis (Webster et al. 2007). Sub­sequent work on lake cores in the same general area by Hodell and his colleagues (Hodell et al. 2005; Hodell et al. 2007) has since attributed the aban­donment of Mayapan inA.D. I44 I to another spike in aridity.

Pollen grains of maize and other indicators of forest clearance in lake cores from the well-watered interior of the peninsula to the south document pio­neer colonization of the area by agriculturalists, ca. 2000 B.C. (Pohl et al. 1996). These cores also show pollen evidence for forest regeneration after the collapse and limnological evidence for extreme soil loss in the intervening Late Preclassic and Classic periods, but these environmental perturbations mask most of the climatological data here (e.g., Brenner et al. 2003; Deevey 1978; Deevey et al. 1979; Vaughn et al. 1985). In addition, a massively replicated network of tree-ring chronologies that indicate changes in paleoclimate has been devel­oped for Mexico over the past decade (Villanueva­Dfaz et al. 2007; Stahle et al. 2009). 
Analogous to tree rings, annual speleothem lay­ers can be counted for excellent age control (Frap-

pier et al. 2002). The physical and geochemical variations in speleothem laminations, moreover, can be more sensitive in recording paleoclimatic changes than lake core stratigraphy because there is little reservoir effect. This means that climatic perturbations that are too small to register in lake sediments, but which might have had marked effects on the human inhabitants of the region, might well be recorded in speleothems (Frappier et al. 2002). Other characteristics of climatic trends potentially can be measured at intra-annual reso­lutions in speleothems, including the speed of onset and cessation of droughts, as well as differences in seasonality, which can be critically important for agriculturalists (Frappier et al. 2002:. Medina­Elizalde et al. 2010; Webster et al. 2007; Zhang et al. 2008). 
The recognition of agricultural architecture­terracing and drained fields-led the quest for land­use practices along with pollen analysis for a couple of decades (Fedick 1996; Flannery 197 8; Harrison and Turner 1978; Pohl 1985). Intensified agricul­tural techniques as seen in agricultural architecture were fairly localized, and they ultimately fail to sug­gest how the most populated sites, such as Tikal and all of the sites in the heavily populated north­ern peninsula, subsisted. The most infomiative lake core data on land use in the north come from Lakes Coba and Sayaucil (Leyden et al. 1998; Whitmore et al. 1996), but these data are very general and have very coarse temporal resolution. 
While tremendous strides have been made in reconstructing climates and land-use systems on the Yucatan Peninsula using lake core data, this set of techniques, like all techniques taken in isolation, has built-in uncertainties. Many scholars (e.g., Brenner et al. 2003; Trenberth and Otto-Bliesner 2003) cite the need to integrate more independent climate proxies into a holistic reconstruction of past climates. Moreover, clearer linkages between the characteristics of climate changes and cultural changes, both big and small, are necessary. 
Simulating the Paleoclimate at Palenque 
Our interest here is in developing a statistically plausible paleoclimatic history for Palenque by simulation, utilizing two climate-generating pro­grams that capture long-range climate variations (?:100 years) and short-range statistics of daily weather. This approach was taken in order to con­struct realizations of the full range of atmospheric inputs (wet and dry) to the watershed at Palenque, from daily storm events to the annual monsoon to decadal, centennial, and millennial climatic pat­terns typical of the Palenque area. 
MarkSim 
MarkSim is a weather generator for crop model­ing and risk assessment based on the instrumental record from 9,200 tropical weather stations for Latin America and Africa. The stochastic weather generator uses a third-order Markov process to model daily precipitation, temperature, etc. The daily data provided by the model preserve the sta­tistics of regional data. The climate normals for these stations were assembled into 664 groups using a clustering algorithm. For each of these groups, rainfall model parameters are predicted from monthly means of rainfall, air temperature, diurnal temperature range, station elevation, and latitude. The program identifies the cluster relevant to any required point using interpolated climate surfaces at a resolution of 10 minutes of arc ( 18 km2) and evaluates the model parameters for that point (Jones and Thornton 2003). At Palenque the MarkSim weather generator was used to construct a data set of rainfall and temperature over the last 100 years (French 2009: I 78-183). 
Bryson Paleoclimate Model 
The second part of our method utilized the Bryson Archeaoclimatology Macrophysical Climate Model (hereafter BMCM), a high-resolution, site­specific, macrophysical climate model. The BMCM was developed in the mid-l 990s by Reid 
A. and Robert U. Bryson as an alternative to gen­eral circulation models ( GCMs) that could produce results at a spatial and temporal scale useful to a variety of social, natural, and earth sciences. Unlike the wide assortment of GCMs in the literature, the BMCM takes a top-down, rather than bottom-up, approach to model building. The output of the first model was in 200-year averages, but recent revi­sions and updates to the volcanic record (Bryson et al. 2006) have allowed for 100-year averages in calendar years. 
The foundation of the BMCM is the calculated "modules" that provide the location of each of the centers of action for the past 40,000 years, in 100­

year intervals of monthly values. All years in the current models are calculated in calendar years before present (cal B.P.). Each module contains the locations (latitudes) for one center of action at a given longitude. Twenty different modules in four categories are utilized by the BMCM, but only four to six are present in any given model. The breakdown is as follows: temperature modules, highs, intertropical convergence locations, and jet stream locations. The BMCM is, in essence, a heat­budget model predicated on orbital forcing, vari­ations in atmospheric transparency, and the principles of synoptic climatology (Bryson and DeWall 2007). Average monthly rainfall, maxi­mum and minimum temperature, and mean tem­perature typical of the site under consideration were entered into the BMCM, and a data set of 100­year averages for the last 2,500 years was pro­duced (French 2009: 187-189). 
Although there is considerable regional vari­ability and site coverage is still sparse in many places, it is clear that significant parts of the U.S. Southwest, northern and central Mexico, and the Yucatan were wetter than presently in the early to mid-Holocene and exhibited a drying trend toward the late Holocene (Whitmore et al. 1996). In con­trast, the U.S. Southeast was drier than the present in the early to mid-Holocene and became much wetter in the late Holocene. Ruter et al. (2004) compared the aforementioned observations with simulations of climate for 6,000 years ago, and for the present, made with four different climate mod­els. They conclude that the models showed fair agreement, both with each other and with the proxy record in many locations. The subtropics main­tained more similarities, while the tropics differed significantly (Ruter et al. 2004 ). 
Daily-to-Century Climate Scenarios for Watershed Investigation 
It is important to restate that the purpose of this analysis was to construct plausible hydro logic inputs to the Palenque watershed that preserve the short­term daily to seasonal statistics of precipitation and temperature while also maintaining the long-term climate variations and patterns in the paleoclimate model. Using the method of proportionality (Inter­governmental Panel on Climate Change 1996), the daily 100-year MarkSim simulations were scaled by the climate trends of the Bryson model to pro­duce 100-year daily scenarios during selected cen­turies spanning the Maya period. Clearly the approach can only provide an inference or index of past conditions of watershed inputs. 
Tllte 2,500-Year Simulation 
Two trends of interest arose from the 2,500-year paleoclimate simulation (Figure 3). The first is the consistency of the climate from A.D. 500 to 800. Long periods of predictable climate can often equate with flourishing populations. For Palenque, as for much of the Maya Lowlands, the period of 
A.D. 500-800 was a period of unparalleled growth and prosperity. Gunn, Folan, and Robichaux ( 1995) equate this time in Maya history to an optimal bal­ance between seasons. According to Lucero (2006; Lucero et al. 2011) and others (Demarest et al. 2004; Yaeger and Hodell 2008), the Maya collapse most likely occurred during an imbalance between these predictable wet and dry seasons. 
Second, according to the simulation, Palenque began to experience a slight cooling (approximately 1 percent) during the ninth century. By the tenth century the site had cooled an additional 1 percent, along with a I percent increase in precipitation. Although the changes are small, a cooler and wet­ter climate during this time period is in opposition to much of the data that support the theory of a great Maya drought (Gill 2000). Recently, however, many scholars have reassessed the role that decreased rainfall played in the transformation of the Maya Lowlands during the ninth and tenth cen­turies, citing the significant differences from site to site that consistently argue against a single event or catastrophe (Ashmore et al. 2004; Lecount et al. 2002; Lucero 2002; Yaeger and Hodell 2008). 
The Palenque Watershed and Hydrologic Setting 
The effects of climate change are predicted on (and in many cases have already begun to impact) water resources all over the world. Climatic per­turbations also play an important role in chang­ing the ecosystem's structure and function (Westerling et al. 2006). Studies on ecosystem response to relatively short disruptions have indi­cated that species assemblages often recover

rapidly from meteorological drought (Matthews and March-Matthews 2003), but quantitative assessments of ecological impacts from extreme, decades-long wet or dry episodes have revealed more pervasive ecological impacts than previ­ously thought (Gray et al. 2006). A potential strat­egy available for understanding the culltural and political risks associated with past climate impacts is to obtain a clear definition of past hydrological variability and extremes (National Research Council 2007). Instrumental records of precipita­tion, temperature, and surface-water flow at many sites throughout Mesoamerica are nonexistent, but long-term estimates of streamflow variability are critical for understanding the impacts. of floods and hydrological droughts (Stewart et al. 2004). 
Streamflow records can be extended by sto­chastic approaches to generate synthetic data (Salas 1993). The simulated climatic conditions discussed earlier are incorporated in a stochastic model that produces streamflow sequences that replicate these conditions for a longer period. This stochastic method also generates a long time series of precipitation that is transformed into streamflow using deterministic hydrologic models (Linsley et al. 1982). These approaches assume that existing instrumental data adequately represent the char­acteristics of streamflow or precipitation well beyond the actual period of observations. This sec­tion details a novel method that combines simu­lated climatic records and watershed modeling to produce estimates of long-term streamflow for the Palenque watershed. 

The Palenque upland watershed encompasses 
7 .21 km2 and is located approximately 8 km southwest of the modern town of Palenque. The watershed is on the northern edge of uplifted and folded sedimentary rocks of the Mayan tectonic block. To the south lies the Sierra de Chiapas, a folded and faulted chain of Mesozoic and Tertiary sedimentary rocks with fold axes trending north­west, which generally plunge northwestward beneath the Pliocene and younger sediments of the coastal Tabasco Plain and the Gulf of Mex­ico (Ferrusquia-Villafranca 1993; Nencetti et al. 2005; Sedlock et al. 1993). 
Late Cretaceous (99.6-65.5 Ma) limestone cov­ers most of the watershed. The model assumes that the limestone, like the soils, is very permeable. Macropores, which are soil or rock fractures, cracks, root holes, and bioturbation of all kinds, tend to increase the hydraulic conductivity of the soil and rock. The near-surface limestone also weathers along joints and fracture planes as shown in Figure 4. 
Palenque is categorized as a "tropical moist for­est" according to the Holdridge Life Zone classi­fication scheme (Holdridge et al. 1971 ). Holdridge defines "tropical moist forest" as a tall, multistratal semideciduous forest with many different species of wide-crowned trees 40--50 m tall. The subcanopy consists of trees up to 30 m tall, mostly with nar­row crowns. Palms are generally abundant. The shrub layer is made up of dwarf palms and giant herbs with banana-like leaves. The ground is gen­erally bare except for a few ferns, broad-leafed

The Penn State Integrated Hydrologic Model 
Integrated hydrologic models are the latest tools in simulations of the terrestrial water cycle that include all physical processes that affect water (ter­rain, vegetation, geology, soils, etc.). Traditional approaches are generally spatially lumped and sta­tistically based and generally do not provide any­thing but input and output. This new generation of terrestrial models is physics-based, with spatially distributed predictions for soil moisture, ground­water, and streamflow "within" the domain of inter­est. That is, the user not only can simulate the outflow from the watershed but can also simulate the internal dynamics of the river network includ­ing groundwater inputs to streams. The hydrologic community is now relying on integrated models that better reflect the physics of water movement through complex geological terrain as called for by the National Research Council (2004, 2005, 2008). 
Major hydrological processes within the terres­trial hydrological cycle operate over a wide range of time scales, with interactions among them rang­ing from uncoupled to strongly coupled. The numerical simulation of coupled nonlinear hydro­logic processes provides an efficient and flexible approach to watershed simulation. The Penn State Integrated Hydrologic Model (PIHM) represents a new strategy for watershed modeling in which spa­tial details of the watershed, including processes of surface flow, groundwater flow, vegetation water, and energy, are accurately represented in the model, and data are derived from national or global spa­tially explicit data sets (Qu and Duffy 2007). The model equations are numerically solved using the finite volume method (Ferziger and Perie 2002). The model solves the systems of equations on an

unstructured triangular grid, referred to as a trian­gular irregular network. The finite volume elements are prisms, projected vertically downward from the triangular surface grid. The grid is generated to fol­low important features of the model domain, such as the watershed boundary, the stream network, the soils, or the land cover. The model is designed to capture the dynamics of the watershed for surface, groundwater, soil water, and vegetation water use while maintaining the conservation of mass at all grid cells, as guaranteed by the finite volume for­mulation (Qu and Duffy 2007). 
Figure 5 shows typical land surface and chan­nel elements. PIHM and PIHMgis represent a com­munity modeling tool and geographical information system (GIS) tool, respectively, devel­oped under National Science Foundation funding. 
This application of PIHM serves as a test of the overall modeling strategy for ungauged basins, but where land cover, soil maps, topography, and cli­mate data are available or can be estimated (Qu and Duffy 2007). The important distinction between PIHM and other watershed models is that the phys­ical model and data layers (Figure 5) are explicitly linked (tightly coupled) through a data model and GIS interface. 
PIHMgis is an integrated and extensible GIS system with data management, data analysis, mesh generation, and distributed modeling capabilities. This makes it possible to generate a model fairly quickly that can handle the complexity of the dif­ferent types of data, represent the "built" structures, and produce realistic model simulations. The GIS tool allows visualization of the data and provides

algorithms for the hydraulic parameterization of soil and land cover. 
PIHMgis was developed using basic Quantam GIS source code (http://www.qgis.org). PIHM is available as open-source code on Source Forge (http://sourceforge.net/projects/pihmmodel/) and on the Penn State Web site (http://www.pihm. psu.edu). 
Land Cover at Palenque 
Running PIHMgis at Palenque required the input of the I 00-year daily climate simulations discussed earlier. The model also required the identification of likely land cover that existed during each epoch. The following three scenarios were constructed to cover a range of climate conditions and plausible land cover during each epoch (Figure 6). 
Forested 
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's "2001 National Land Cover Data" (National Land Cover Database 2001) provides the vegetation and properties for estimating evapotranspiration in the model. The most appropriate category, according to the National Land Cover Database, was "for­est/evergreen." It defines "forest/evergreen" as "trees > three meters in height, canopy closure > 35 percent ( < 25 percent intermixture with decid­uous species), of species that do not seasonally lose leaves" (2001 ). 
Deforested 
Evidence suggests that deforestation was common among the Maya, especially those living near urban centers (Webster 2002). In Palenque the deforested areas were composed of the densely populated core and the agricultural fields to the north of the site (Liendo 1999). Although increases in agricultural production caused much deforestation, demand for stucco for monumental stone structures played an even larger role (Abrams and Rue 1988; Hansen et al. 2002; Schreiner 2002). To make stucco lime­stone must be heated to 900°C, a process called cal­cination or lime burning, so as to remove the carbon dioxide in a nonreversible chemical reaction. The result is calcium oxide (quicklime), a white, caus­tic, and alkaline crystalline solid that when mixed with water makes a fine plaster. The Maya used this plaster/stucco to coat all exposed architecture, in

addition to paving their expansive plaza floors. Because it was a sign of wealth and prestige, the stucco had to be constantly maintained. 
Reconstruction of a Maya kiln used for the cal­cination process determined that 1 ha of forest with trees greater than 5 cm in diameter will provide 444 kg of quicklime (Schreiner 2002). The quicklime contribution to a cubic meter of plaster is 325 kg. Palenque 's main plaza would have required approx­imately 668 m3 of plaster and pavemenlt (based on 2 cm of thickness). At 325 kg per cubic meter, 217, 100 kg of quicklime would have been needed for the surface of the plaza. This equates to 489 ha 
(4.89 km2) of forest trees, more than twice the size of the site. Palenque also maintained thick layers (2-10 cm) of stucco in many of its buildings, roof combs, and aqueducts (French and Duffy 201 O; Littman 1959; Straight 2007). It must also be noted that some portion of the fuel (trees) used in the pro­duction of quicklime would have most liikely come from the clearing of land for agricultural produc­tion. Based on these arguments we propose that sig­nificant deforestation would have occunred locally. 
Urban 
The urban land-cover scenario was difficult because it is unknown to what extent the Palenque plazas and courtyards were impermeable due to stucco/plaster. In lieu of this information the hydraulic conductivity of the soil within the site boundary was reduced by 50 percent to simulate compaction by urban traffic. 
The Hydroclirnatic and Land-Cover Scenarios 
In the first scenario a 100-year daily climate sim­ulation for 500-401 B. C. included 100 percent pri­mary-forest land cover (Figure 6). Due to an absence of Preclassic pottery and architecture, it is widely accepted that the Palenque shelf was com­pletely unoccupied during this period (Bishop 1994; Rands 1974; Rands and Bishop 1980). There is no evidence of occupation in the area until ca. 100 B.C. The vegetation scenario for 500--401 B.C. simulates pre-settlement conditions dming a rela­tively wet climate period. 
The second 100-year scenario, A.D .. 601-700, is the plausible height of Palenque's population and urbanization (Figure 6). The land cover devel­oped for this scenario was a mix of forested ( 40 percent), deforested (40 percent), and urban (20 percent) land-cover types. This time period sim­ulates the maximum effect of human occupation and urbanization on the watershed during a sta­ble climate period. 
The third 100-year scenario or the modern period, A.D. I 901-2000, provides the linkage and comparison with the modem tropical climate obser­vations (Figure 6). The land cover for this recent period was a mix of forested (75 percent), defor­ested (20 percent), and urban (5 percent), to approx­imate what exists today at Palenque. This span of time is also useful because of the opportunity to compare the scenario with descriptions by local inhabitants of flood and drought events that have taken place in the last 50 years. 
Results 
Scenarios of land use and climate variability were designed to examine their relative impacts on water supply and flood and drought conditions during three 100-year periods at Palenque. The 100-year climate periods chosen can be classified as wet (500-401 B.C.), average (A.D. 601-700), and dry 
(A.D. 1901-2000) based on the 2,500-year record. Land-use/land-cover changes represented pre­Maya, peak Maya, and modem for the same 100­year periods, respectively. Perhaps the most interesting result overall is the amplifying effect of land-use change on watershed streamflow response.1 The results will model net watershed response and will focus on the Otolum channel (Figure 7), which flows through the central plaza, for detailed stream response. The results of the three scenarios are described below. 
500-401 B.C. 
The results from 500 B.C.-401 B.C. show an aver­age daily discharge of 27,321 m3/per day with a runoff ratio (runoff/precip) of 47 percent for the entire watershed (Figure 8). The complete forest cover, along with an absence of impermeable sur­faces (e.g., plaster/stucco plazas), produced a rel­atively low runoff ratio and high soil moisture and evapotranspiration rate. It is interesting to note that the climate simulation for average precipitation for 500-401 B.C. was very close to that of A.D. 1901-2000 but 2 percent drier than A.D. 601-700 (Figure 9). As for temperature, the simulations

A.D. 1901-2000 
The simulations from the last century show the lowest average daily discharge of the three scenar­ios with 26,955 m3/per day (Figure 8) and runoff ratio of 46 percent. The precipitation levels during this time period and that of the fourth century B. C. are nearly the same, but the temperature increased by a full l.4°C (Figure 9). This significant rise in temperature coupled with less forest and an increase in urban cover are the causes for the 2 percent drop in daily flow. 
Simulated Flood and Drought Events 
The scenarios described above for wet, average, and dry 100-year climate periods with changing land cover make it possible to reconstruct the net hydro­logic impacts on the watershed. Taken together, land-use change and climate change can produce an amplification of the basic hydrologic regime, with cooler-wetter conditions and increases in urban land cover equating to much larger runoff and warmer-dryer conditions leading to deeper, longer hydrological drought (lower runoff with longer duration). Details of these analyses can be found in French's 2009 dissertation. 
The observed historical climate record is roughly 100 years long. Although earlier data exist, the last 100 years represent the reliable reference period. In order to compare historical simulation scenarios we use the same period as the historical observations. Within 100 years we can expect to find a useful range of variability, providing suffi­cient numbers of floods and droughts to make the simulations meaningful. Indexes for low-and high­flow conditions are derived from 100-year series of the annual minimum and maximum of then-day average flow (Hisdal et al. 2004 ). For example, for 
n = 7, the entry from September 29, 1975, is in fact the average low flow for the period September 23, 1975, to September 29, 1975, inclusively. The derived data can thus be regarded as the outcome of passing a moving average filter of seven-day duration through the daily data. Based on the fil­tered hydrographs, mean annual minimum or max­imum seven-day indexes can be derived. In this case, seven-day periods were used for n averages to find the lowest (drought) and highest (flood) flows for 500-401 B.C., A.D. 601-700, and A.D. 1901-2000. 
The flood events in Palenque (Figure 1 Oa) are linked to both rainfall and land cover. As men­tioned above, the land cover for the fourth century 
B.C. is 100 percent forest. Forest cover slows the runoff from rainfall. The land cover used for the

time period A.D. 601-700 was a mix of forest, deforested, and urban. Figure 1Oa shows the ampli­fying effects that a change in land cover can have on the watershed. 
The hydrological droughts in the Palenque watershed (Figure 1Ob) are not particularly severe even under the worst-case scenario. During the worst seven-day drought of A.D. 601-700 the Otolum was still flowing at 484 m3/per day. The storing of a mere 25 percent of this daily flow would have provided an ample water supply for a popu­lation of more than 17,000 based on 6 liters per per-son/per day (Back and Lesser 1981 ). As mentioned earlier, the population of Palenque is estimated at a little over 6,000 at its peak. Furthermore, this seven-day low-flow estimation is based on just one of Palenque's six major waterways, the Otolum (accounting for approximately 40 percent of the site's total flow [Figure 7b]). According to these simulations, Palenque never experienced a hydro­logical drought severe enough to cause major dis­ruptions in daily life. It is also highly unlikely that Palenque was abandoned ca. A.D. 800 due to drought given that the region's climate remained

In addition, careful analysis of the most severe simulated meteorological and agricultural droughts in Palenque did not reveal a time period that would have catastrophically affected agricultural produc­tivity. Although there were times when the total rainfall during the summer growing season (Table 
1) dipped to as low as 650 mm (the average required for maximum production [Food and Agriculture Organizations of the United Nations 2002]), the streams continued to deliver water to the channel­ized fields in the plains to the north of the site.

Lowlands. It was also distinctive for its architec­
ture and for the cleverness its people showed in the 
manipulation of water. Palenque was remarkably 
small, both geographically and in population, when 
compared with other Maya centers with similar 
influence, such as Tikal, Calakmul, or Caracol. 

In order to better understand Palenque's sig­nificance we turned to its predominant feature, water. The first step toward researching the water at any site should be to model the watershed. The only way to achieve this goal at Palenque was to first simulate a paleoclimate record. Two programs were used to achieve this end: (1) MarkSim, a daily weather generator; and (2) the Bryson pale­oclimate model, a high-resolution, site-specific, macrophysical climate model. The results of the climate simulations for Palenque suggest a rela­tively stable climate from A.D. 500 to A.D. 800. It was during this period that most of the Maya Lowlands experienced the highest level of devel­opment and prosperity. Often, long periods of pre­dictable climate equate with the reproductive, demographic, and political success of a regional population (Demeritt 1991 ). 
The paleoclimatic simulations were used to gen­erate precipitation and atmospheric temperature inputs for the watershed model (PIHM [Qu and Duffy 2007]). The spatial details of the watershed 

7including processes of surface flow, groundwater flow, vegetation water, and energy are accurately represented in the model, and the data are derived from national or global spatially explicit data sets. PIHM modeled the Palenque watershed for three key epochs, each with differing land-cover scenar­ios: (1) 500-401 B.C., prior to Maya settlers, with a 100 percent primary-forest land cover; (2) A.D. 601-700, the plausible height of Palenque's popu­lation and urbanization, with a land cover consist­ing of 40 percent forested, 40 percent deforested, and 20 percent urban; and (3) A.D. 1901-2000, 
used as a comparison to the measured record of 
tropical climate observations, with 75 percent 
forested, 20 percent deforested, and 5 percent 
urban. The conclusions from these three scenarios 
produced drastic distinctions when the percentages 
of change in climatic conditions are compared with 
that of the total discharge. The definitive leading 
factor driving the rise in streamflow is the differ­
ence in land cover. The amplification effect of the 
slight increases or decreases in precipitation or tem­
perature on the watershed from land-cover change 
is dramatic. 

The Palenque watershed's response to the sim­ulated hydrological droughts is contrary to the great "megadrought" theory for the cause of Maya aban­donment put forth over the last 15 years (Curtis et al. 1996; Gill 2000; Gill et al. 2007; Haug et al. 2003). According to the scenarios presented here, the Maya of Palenque would never be forced to leave their homes in search of water. The worst sim­ulated droughts repeatedly show more than suffi­cient levels of freshwater for the population. 
Palenque's complete absence of water storage features (French 2007; French et al. 2006) is a result of its annual abundance of freshwater. According to the simulations presented here (and the personal experience of the first author), there are several occasions throughout the seasonal meteorological drought (January-April) when the streamflow is so low that retrieving it with a water jar would prove difficult. However, in times of extreme low flow the outlets of the aqueducts easily could have been dammed to allow for partial filling. The stucco applied on the interior walls of the aqueduct would have drastically reduced seepage. The partial damming (1 m) of OT-Al (the Palace Aqueduct) could have stored over 225,000 liters of freshwa­ter per day and still allowed enough overflow for crop irrigation in the plains to the north of the site. That is more than 10 times the amount of water nec­essary to sustain the population of Palenque. If the watershed simulations presented in this article are even remotely accurate, it is safe to say that Palenque was not abandoned because of a lack of water, with regard to either drinking, household use, or food production. 
The paleoclimate data from lake cores through­out much of the Maya Lowlands suggest that four major droughts occurred atA.D. 760, 810, 860, and 910 (Gill 2000; Gill et al. 2007; Haug et al. 2003). 
Downloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core. YBP Library Services, on 22 Aug 2018 at 17:28:13, subject to the Cambridge Core terms of use, available at https://www.cambridge.org/core/terms. https://doi.org/10.7183/1045-6635.23.1.29 
This fits neatly into the estimated time of aban­donment for many Maya centers. One thing we are certain of is that the Maya left these polities and moved on. There is little evidence of mass starva­tion, large-scale regional warfare, or disease. It is as if the Maya "disappeared." But it seems more likely that they dispersed into the jungles in small extended-family groups and continued to farm as they became disillusioned with their political sys­tem, with its dominant kings who failed to keep chaos at bay and guarantee safety. 
It might be overzealous to claim thait Palenque was not abandoned because of drought. As we have shown in this article, Palenque was likely never without sufficient supplies of water, even during the worst simulated droughts. Yet the reliable supply of freshwater could still have led to its demise. Because each watershed responds differently to extreme events, Palenque may have been the only center in the region to have a supply of freshwater and productive agriculture during a "megadrought." If this were true, then it would have become a prime target for "drought refugees." When prolonged hydrological drought takes place people are forced to leave. These drought refugees in tum place stress on the communities in which they settle. Examples include the migration from the Great Plains to Cal­ifornia in 1936 (Worster 1979), the Hom of Africa in the early 1980s (Myers 1997), and eastern Syria in 2009 (Sands 2009). 
The situations mentioned above give one pause in claiming that Palenque was not abandoned because of drought. A significant rise in popula­tion due to an influx of drought refugees from neighboring centers would have easily caused a great strain on the political system. Archaeologi­cally, one could look for signs of shanty camps on the periphery, evident by tightly spaced housing with no platform, concentrations of pottery made elsewhere, or human remains with evidence of stress. Although difficult to detect archaeologically, this scenario remains plausible. 
Modem Implications 
The modem city of Palenque and its 60,000 inhab­itants rely heavily on water that is diverted and pumped directly from the Palenque watershed. Dur­ing early summer 2005 the perennial springs that feed the Otolum Stream ran dangerously low. 
Although there was still water flowing, the intake pipe was not submerged, causing the pump to fail. Because the town of Palenque lacks the resources to monitor streamflow and rainfall at the site, this minor hydrological drought came without warning. Five days and much panic passed prior to a regen­erative rainfall. As the population of modern Palenque grows, the stress on environmental resources will increase. One of the long-term goals of this study is to work with the townspeople and city planners of Palenque with the aim of heading off future problems caused by droughts and creat­ing a knowledge base for water systems in the area through technology transfer and education. This will ultimately help the townspeople understand their water supply and its response to wet and dry climate cycles. 
This article proposes that the hydroarchaeolog­ical method provides a new way of assessing the degree of human impact on an environment through paleohydrological modeling of a watershed. The strategy could be easily applied to archaeological sites where climate and land-use change impact the surrounding watershed. The possibilities for this noninvasive method are many, including detect­ing periods of stress within a community, estimat­ing population by developing caps based on the availability of water, and understanding settlement patterns, as well as assisting local populations in areas where monetary resources are lacking. As with most new methods, there will be creative appli­cations by other researchers that we never imag­ined. In this study, however, land-cover change emerged as the major factor in the magnitude of flood and drought response at Palenque.
