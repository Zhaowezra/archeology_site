This network was centered at the urban and ceremonial center of Chavín de Huántar and promoted long-distance exchange, partially through the expansion of religious ideology (Burger 1988, 2008; Patterson 1971).

Sphere(Burger 2008, 2013), with obsidian .g­uringprominently among theexchangedexotic materials. Geochemical analyses over the last four decades demonstrate that the important obsidian quarries are situated over a large area of thesouth-centralhighlands(Figure2), some 600 kilometerstothesouthofChavíndeHuán­tar(Glascock et al. 2007). One source known as Quispisisa was used intensively, comprising roughly 90% of all obsidian circulated through­out theChavínInteraction Sphere(Burger and Glascock 2009). The signi.cant distances tra­versedto obtain obsidian and otherexotic goods raisesthe questionofpreciselyhowthesemate­rials were distributed and acquired within this interaction sphere. To address this question requiresthe studyof obsidianprocurement from the perspective of the south-central highlands rather than from obsidian consumersinthe north. In this article,we detailthe changing roleof the south-centralhighlands with respect to obsidian exchange in the Chavín Interaction Sphere. To illustrate these changes and their signi.cance, we present theresultsofarecent portableX-ray .orescence (pXRF) sourcing study of 370 obsid­ianartifactsfromthecivic-ceremonial centerof Campanayuq Rumi.Campanayuq Rumi is criti­cal to understanding the circulation of obsidian becauseitis one of thelargest known centersin thesouth-centralhighlandsof Peruandis located in closeproximity to theQuispisisa quarry,as well as other important south-central highland obsidian sources. Furthermore, Campanayuq Rumihasalong historyofoccupation, permitting a diachronic perspective on changing patterns of obsidian exploitation between circa 1100 and 450 BC. As a result, we were able to docu­ment how Campanayuq Rumi became embed­ded in the Chavín Interaction Sphere through time. 


TheChavínInteraction Sphere and 
Long-Distance Exchange 

TheChavínInteraction Spherewasacosmopoli­tan system of interacting polities spread over a large area of the north and central Peru­vian highlands, coastal areas, and tropical forest regions (Burger 2008, 2012; Contreras 2011). While these polities exhibited a great deal of regionaldiversity,they werealso linkedthrough shared religious ideology (Burger 1988). The core of this area was centered in the north and north-centralhighlands,whereseveral large, regional centers, including Chavín de Huántar, KunturWasi, andPacopampa interacted as peer­polities(sensu Renfrew 1986;see also Burger 1993). Within this network a variety of exotic goods rapidly appeared, including goldjewelry, foreign pottery, cinnabar pigment, and obsidian tools, as well as Spondylus and Strombus shells from coastalEcuador (Burger 1988, 2008, 2013; Burger and Matos 2002; Burger, Lane, and Cooke 2016; Cooke et al. 2013;Druc 2004; Lothrop 1941; Onuki 1995;Rick 2005, 2008; Sayre 2010; Seki et al. 2010). Coinciding with this intensi.cation of interaction is strong evi­denceforthedevelopmentof social hierarchies. For instance, excavations at both Kuntur Wasi and Pacopampa have revealed burials of elite individuals accompanied with gold ornamenta­tion, cinnabar,and Strombus shells (Onuki 1995; Seki et al. 2010). 
The evidence for the importance of long-distance trade is, however, best exempli.ed at the urban and ceremonial center of Chavín de Huántar.ChavíndeHuántar hadalong history of development that began around 1000 BC, reaching its maximal size in the Janabarriu Phase, around ca. 700 BC (Burger 1984, 2008). Chavín de Huántar consisted of a large cere­monial corethat included aU-shaped platform complex that functioned as a temple (Burger 1992; Kembel 2008). Archaeological excava­tions in the temple core demonstrate that since its foundation around 1000 BC, Chavín de Huántar was a center that received a signi.cant amount of foreign goods fromdistant locations (Lumbreras 2007;Rick 2005, 2008;Sayre etal. 2016). 
Chavínde Huántaralsohasalarge residential occupation with strong evidence for craft pro­duction activities and status distinctions (Burger 1984;Rick 2005; Sayre 2010). Archaeological excavations indicate that the residential com­ponent grew signi.cantly during the Janabarriu Phase (ca. 700–400 BC) to cover an area of at least 40–50 ha. The explosive growth of Chavín de Huántar corresponded with increased elite demand for the exotic materials circulated within theChavínInteraction Sphereofthe Early Horizon described above.

Obsidian and theChavínInteraction Sphere 
Diachronic studies suggest that the exploita­tionof obsidian atChavíndeHuántar changed through time(Burger et al. 1984;Burger,Lau, Ponte, and Glascock 2006).Forinstance, during theUrabarriu Phase(ca. 950–800 BC), obsidian useatChavíndeHuántarwasrare. The paucity of obsidiansuggests that obsidiandid not form a signi.cant component of Chavín de Huántar’s political economy during its earliest occupation phases. 
In the Janabarriu Phase (ca. 700–400 BC) obsidian was found in signi.cant quantities at Chavínde Huántar,implyingclose relations with the south-central highlands during this time. Obsidian was found in ceremonial and temple deposits, suggesting that the material was used as an offering and/or ritual paraphernalia (Mesía Montenegro 2014).Thesymbolicvalueofobsid­ian could be related to its exotic provenance (Helms 1993), as well as its color and re.ective glass-likeproperties. 
Thereare also strong indicatorsthat duringthe Janabarriu Phase, obsidianformedasigni.cant component of the political economy. Investiga­tions in Chavín de Huántar’s residential sectors showed that obsidian was ubiquitous, replacing chert, quartzite, and basaltasthe dominant lithic material(Burger 1984).Obsidianwasdistributed widelyinhigh quantities andwasacommonarti­fact in bothhigh-and low-status households.It wasrecently argued that this distribution pattern (sensuHirth 1998)impliesthataformofmarket exchange system operated at Chavín de Huántar in theJanabarriu Phase(Burger 2013:325–327). 
Obsidianwasusedtomanufacturebifaces and scrapers, though the vast majority of artifacts consistedofutilized .akes and debitage (Burger 1984:190–192; Burger, Lau, Ponte, and Glas­cock 2006; Contreras and Nado 2018). Burger (1984:238) suggests that the .akes were used in crafting activities such as processing animal hides in the residential sectors of Chavín de Huántar.Itisalsoplausible that obsidian .akes were used as tools for shearing camelids in the production of wool textiles. The increase in obsidian at Chavín de Huántar correlates with an intensi.cation in the use of domestic camelids, especially llamas, which were valued for human consumption, transport, and wool production(Miller and Burger 1995;Rosenfeld and Sayre 2016). Ethnographic accountssuggest that obsidianwouldhave been suitableforwool­processing activities. Bandelier(1904:446) notes that obsidianwasapreferred materialforAymara herders to shear llamas, while Flores-Ochoa (1979:94) points out that contemporary herders in isolated communitiesinsouth-highland Peru employed shardsof bottle glassfor shearingtheir animals. 
Two geochemical sourcing studies suggest that roughly 90% of the obsidian from Chavín de Huántar came from the Quispisisa source (Burger et al. 1984; Burger, Lau, Ponte, and Glascock 2006;Contreras and Nado2018). The source areaof Quispisisa obsidianwasamassive quarry found near the towns of Sacsamarca and Huanca Sancos in theDepartment ofAyacucho (Burger and Glascock 2000a, 2002). A recent survey of one locality,Cerro JichjaParco, doc­umented more than 30 ancient quarrying pits. Somepits areaslargeas80mindiameter,atesta­ment to theintensityofexploitationofthissource in the past (Tripcevich and Contreras 2011, 2013). Smalleramountsofobsidian comefrom theJampatilla, Potreropampa, and Alca sources (Burger et al. 1984;Contreras and Nado2018). All of these sources are signi.cantly greater than 600kmto thesouthofChavíndeHuántar. The long distances involved raise the question of how obsidian was acquired. To address this problem requiresa considerationofthe situation of thesouth-centralhighlands at sitescloserto the sources of archaeological obsidian. 


Archaeological Research at Campanayuq Rumi 
One of the largest late Initial Period and Early Horizon settlements in the south-central high­lands is Campanayuq Rumi, a civic-ceremonial centerin theDepartmentofAyacucho(Figure1). The site is located at an altitude of 3,600 m asl, just above thetown and former Inca admin­istrative center of Vilcashuaman. Importantly, Campanayuq Rumiis only52kmtothe eastof theQuispisisasource area. 
Campanayuq Rumi is composed of a monu­mental coreofarti.cial stone platformsarranged in a U-shaped pattern that covers an area of

Using absolute and relative dating, the occu­pation of the site has been divided into three phases(Table1). During this time, Campanayuq Rumi grew from a small village in the Initial Period into one of the largest ceremonial and

residential centers of its time in the south­centralhighlands (Matsumoto 2010;Matsumoto and Cavero Palomino 2010). In the following sections we providea briefoverviewofhow the site changed through time. 
Pre-Platform Phase(1100–950 BC) 
The .rst phase of occupation at Campanayuq Rumi is referred to as the Pre-Platform Phase (1100–950 BC). The Pre-Platform Phase cor­responds to an occupation that pre-dates the construction oftemple architecture(Matsumoto 2010). Excavationsin boththe monumental core and occupational contexts suggestthat duringthe Pre-Platform Phase there was a small village-level Initial Period settlement at Campanayuq Rumi.If thiswas the case, Pre-Platform Phase Campanayuq Rumiwasprobably oneofa num­berof small-scalesettlementsthat characterized the south-central highlands during the second millennium BC (Bauer et al. 2010:53–55; Gross­man 1972, 1983). 
The CampanayuqIPhase(950–700 BC) 
The Campanayuq I Phase marks a radical change in which the site transformed into a ceremonial center that was tied in important ways to Chavín de Huántar. Architecture, ceramic style, and absolute dates support this view (Matsumoto 2010;Matsumoto andCavero Palomino 2010;Nesbitt and Matsumoto 2014). Bythis time, Campanayuq Rumi displaysascale of monumentality that is signi.cantly greater than other public centersintheAyacucho region, such as Chupas or Wichqana (Cruzatt 1971; Lumbreras 1981). 
The monumental core of Campanayuq Rumi forms a U-shaped pattern with four stone masonry platforms surrounding a sunken rectangular plaza. This architectural pattern

resembles the architectural layout of Chavín de Huántar. Shared characteristics between the two centersinclude thepresence of at least one gallery within Campanayuq Rumi’s southern platform that is similar to some of the gallery complexes for which Chavín de Huántar is famous (Matsumoto2010:424–425).Inaddition, excavationsin 2016 uncovereda sunken circular plaza on the summit of the central platform, which is highly similar to the one found at Chavín de Huántar (Lumbreras 2014). 
The combination of a U-shaped arrangement andtheuseofan interiorgallery indicatea close relationship with Chavín de Huántar, despite a distanceofover600kmseparatingthesetwocen­ters (Matsumoto 2010). Given the greater scale and elaborationofthe Chavínde Huántar public architecture, as well as earlier radiocarbon dates (Kembel and Haas 2015),it seemsreasonableto assume that from the outset, the public center at Campanayuq Rumi was emulating Chavín architectural conventions. 
Despite the strong similarities observed in monumental architecture, the ceramic styles that characterize the Campanayuq I Phase do not show clear af.liation to those of contempo­rary late Initial Period (or Urabarriu Phase) Chavín de Huántar (see Burger 1984). Rather, the ceramic assemblage of the Campanayuq I Phase was composed of styles that exhibit af.nities with pottery documented in the south-central highlands and parts of the south coast (Matsumoto 2010, 2018a).Forinstance, stylistic linkages exist between Campanayuq Rumi and Pirwapukio in the Mantaro Valley (Browman 1970), Muyo Moqo in Andahuaylas (Bauer et al. 2010:51–52; Grossman 1972), Hacha in the Acari Valley (Neira and Cardona 2000–2001; Riddell andValdéz 1987–1988;Robinson1994), and Marcavalle in Cuzco (Mohr-Chavez 1977). 
The CampanayuqII Phase(700–450BC) 
Several changes in architecture, ceramic styles, and social organization occur during the Cam­panayuq II Phase (Matsumoto 2010). Around 700BC,the potteryoftheprevious Campanayuq I Phase was largely replaced by pottery that showsstrong similaritiestothe ceramic styleof the contemporaryJanabarriu PhaseatChavínde Huántar(Burger 1984;see also Ricketal.2010), 
as well as the Early Paracas style of the south coast(seeDulanto 2015;García and Pinilla1995; Isla and Reindel 2006). 
This radical change in ceramic assemblage was associated with modi.cations in the mon­umental architecture.Forinstance, Campanayuq Rumi incorporated an innovative masonry tech­nology of cut and polished stone referred to as ashlar construction (Figure5). This new tech­nique is especially important because it was popularized by the Chavín de Huántar temple (e.g.,Kembel 2008).Itis also duringthis time that the residential settlement of Campanayuq Rumiwas occupied more intensively(Figure3) (Matsumoto et al. 2013, 2016). 
The changes in material culture observed duringthe CampanayuqII Phaseserveasaproxy for signi.cant socioeconomic transformations occurring at the site. Personal ornaments such as stone beads, bone ornaments with incised iconography, ear spools, and goldjewelry sug­gestthat social organization becamemuch more hierarchical duringthis phase(Matsumoto 2010, 2012;Matsumotoetal.2013,2016).Itisalsodur­ingthe CampanayuqII Phasethatthe percentage of obsidianartifactsincreases from nearly80to almost 90% (seediscussion below). 
Summary 
The data presented above reveal how the char­acter of Campanayuq Rumi changed through time from a small village to a major civic-ceremonial center.Because Campanayuq Rumi emulated Chavín architectural conventions as a ceremonial center during the Campanayuq I Phase, the relationship between these two cen­ters seems to have been religious rather than economic, and might have caused signi.cant— but infrequent—interactions. During the Cam­panayuq I Phase, Campanayuq Rumi was a ceremonial center of regional importance within the south-central highlands and upper val­leys of the south coast. Though Campanayuq Rumi likely bene.ted from its links to Chavín de Huántar, it also maintained much of its independence. 
In the Campanayuq II Phase, Campanayuq Rumi exhibits much stronger in.uence from Chavínde Huántar,bothintermsof material cul­ture and social organization. BasedonRichard

Burger’smodelofapilgrimage network centered at Chavín de Huántar (Burger 1988, 1993), Matsumoto hashypothesized that Campanayuq Rumi could have been incorporated into this religious network and functioned as a branch shrine (Matsumoto 2010). As we will argue later inthispaper,oneofthereasonsthat Campanayuq Rumi becameembedded within this pan-regional interactionspherewasduetoits proximitytothe highlyprized Quispisisa obsidiansource. 


Obsidian UseatCampanayuq Rumi 
Obsidianwasthe most important lithic material used duringthe CampanayuqIand Campanayuq II Phases. Matsumoto (2010:294, 574–593) studied a sample of 2,846 stone artifacts and concluded that there was a marked increase in obsidian usage in the ceremonial core from 76.2%in theCampanayuqI Phaseto 89.2%in theCampanayuqII Phase.In both phases, obsid­ianwas pervasive andwasfound in signi.cant quantities in the monumental/ceremonial core, ritual offering deposits, and residential areas (Matsumoto 2010, 2012). 
Thevastmajorityof obsidianartifactsatCam­panayuq Rumi consisted of .akes and shatter. 
Formal artifactswererareatCampanayuq Rumi, consisting of unifacial tools such as scrapers, perforators, and drills, as well as bifaces, and projectile points(Figure6). In addition, thereis agreat dealof lithic material,including primary .akes with cortex, that point to some lithic productioninresidential contexts.However,this will onlybe con.rmedby a more detailedstudy of the lithic assemblagein thefuture. 


pXRF Methodology and Sampling 
ThepXRF analysis presentedin this paperwas undertakeninAugustof2014atthe UNSAAC-Yale InternationalCenterfortheStudyofMachu PicchuandInca CultureinCuzco,Peru.

current of 30 microamps. Measurement times were60 secondsper sample.While other studies haveemployed longer measurement times (Craig etal. 2007;Rademakeretal.2013),theXRF that we used had a suf.ciently high count rate that permitted us to reduce the counting time to 60 seconds and still obtainreliable data. TheXRF was calibratedfor analysisof obsidianby using the University of Missouri Research Reactor (MURR) suite of 40 obsidian source specimens and their associated concentration data(Glas­cock and Ferguson 2012). The elements for whichthe concentrations couldbe determinedin obsidianinclude Mn, Fe, Zn,Ga, Rb,Sr,Y, Zr, Nb, and Th. 
Obsidian SamplefromCampanayuq Rumi 
The sample analyzed in this study consisted of 370 obsidian artifacts. As mentioned earlier in this paper, the understanding of obsidian exchange and its changing relationshiptolarger interaction spheres requires a diachronic per­spective.Forthisreason, obsidianwas sampled from Pre-Platform, Campanayuq I, and Cam­panayuq II contexts. Obsidian was selected by site sector, including samples from the mon­umental/ceremonial core, and from residential sectors located to the north and south of the temple core. Obsidian also was taken from a circular structure in the South Sector that includes a number of deep pits that were used for the placement of various types of offerings (Matsumoto et al. 2016). Eleven artifacts were sampledfromthe Pre-Platform Phase,93 from CampanayuqIPhase and 266 from Campanayuq II Phase contexts.Artifacts consistedofdebitage including .akes(n = 289), shatter(n = 49), and cores(n = 6); and complete or semicomplete toolssuch as projectile points(n = 24), scrapers (n = 1), and drills(n = 1).

Puzolana, and Jampatilla and/or Lisahuacho (Figure7). Of particular signi.cance was the dominance of obsidian from the Quispisisa source, which comprised just under 84%(n = 309) of the total sample from all three phases of occupation(Table2; see also Supplemental Table1). 
ThePre-Platform Phase(ca. 1100–950BC) 
Though thesample fromthe Pre-Platform Phase is quite small(n = 11),it nonethelessprovides important insight into obsidian use at Cam­panayuq Rumi prior to its transformation into a large civic-ceremonial center. All 11 obsid­ianartifacts comefromthe Quispisisa quarries located52kmtothewestofCampanayuq Rumi. These data therefore suggest that from the time of its foundationinthe second millennium BC, the populationofCampanayuq Rumiwasprovi­sioned with high-quality Quispisisa obsidian. 
CampanayuqIPhase(950 BC–700 BC) 
Thesourcesof obsidianartifacts changed during the Campanayuq I Phase. Quispisisa obsidian continued to dominate, making up closeto 90% (n = 83)of thetotal sample(n = 93).Neverthe­less, obsidianfromother quarries appears, albeit in low quantities.

Over 5% (n = 5) of the artifacts come from Puzolana, a diffuse source that consists of volcanic deposits containing relatively small nodules in comparison with obsidian from the Quispisisa source region. Two localities with nodules of suf.cient size to produce tools are known; one locationissituatedjusttothesouth of the city of Ayacucho, approximately 60 km to the north of Campanayuq Rumi (Burger and Glascock 2000b), and the second location, Arco Punco, is just over 8 km to the southeast of Campanayuq Rumi. Arco Punco has nodules measuring5–7cmin diameter,whichis adequate forfabricatingusable .akes.Given its proximity to Campanayuq Rumi,wehypothesizethat the Puzolana artifactswereprobably obtained from Arco Punco rather than the source situated near thecityofAyacucho. Becauseofthe proximityof Arco Punco,itisnoteworthythattheexploitation of Puzolana obsidianwasso rareat Campanayuq Rumi. 
More surprisingly, low amounts of obsidian fromthe Alca source (n = 5) appear. Situated in the headwaters of the Cotahuasi River and more than200kmtothesouthofCampanayuq Rumi,Alcaisa large obsidian deposit. Research at Alca has shownthe obsidianfromthislocality to be geochemically complex, consisting of six distinct subsources distributed over an area of at least 330 km² (Rademaker et al. 2013;see also Burger, Asaro, Trawick, and Stross 1998; Jennings and Glascock 2002). At Campanayuq Rumi, obsidian comes fromthe Alca-1(n = 3) and Alca-5(n = 2) subsources. 
CampanayuqII Phase(700–450BC) 
The Campanayuq II Phase is marked by sub­stantialdiversi.cation of obsidianprocurement at Campanayuq Rumi. Though obsidian from the Quispisisa source still makes up the vast majorityof theassemblage,it comprisesalower proportion (just under 81%: n = 215) of the assemblage than in the Campanayuq I Phase. There is likewise a slight increase in obsidian coming from the Alca source discussed earlier (6%: n = 16). 
It is also during the Campanayuq II Phase that obsidian from three or possibly four new sources appears. Five percent of the obsidian sample comes from Potreropampa, located in the southwest part of the Department of Apurímac, near thetownofChalhuanca, and 104kmto the southeastofCampanayuq Rumi(Burger,Fajardo Rios, and Glascock 2006). An additional 4% of the obsidian comes from either Jampatilla or Lisahuacho, which are 62 km and 102 km to thesouthofCampanayuq Rumi,respectively (e.g., Burger, Schreiber,Glascock, and Ccencho 1998). The pXRF cannot discriminate between theJampatilla and Lisahuacho sources,but this uncertainty can be resolved in the future using instrumental neutron activation analysis or a more permanent,elaborateXRFfacility. 
Finally, 1% of the sample comes from the Anillo source. This source is located in the head­watersof Acari, relativelyclosetothe Alca quar­ries,morethan200kmfrom CampanayuqRumi (Tripcevich 2016:213;Tripcevich and Contreras 2013:30). Thus far, Campanayuq Rumi is the only known archaeological site with artifactual materialsfromthissource. Apparentlyitwasnot an important locality for obsidianprocurement, at least during the late Initial Period and Early Horizon. 


Discussion 
DiachronicPerspectives on Obsidian Useat Campanayuq Rumi 
Examination of obsidian sourcing from Cam­panayuq Rumi shows diachronic changes in obsidian consumption.Whentakentogetherwith otherevidence, changesin obsidian consumption can help shed light on the changing identi­ties that characterize the .rst half of the .rst millennium BC and show how Campanayuq Rumi became incorporated into a much wider interactionsphereassociated with theexpansion of Chavín religious ideology. 
While the datafromthe Pre-Platform Phase are limited,they aresigni.cantinrevealingthat from its inception, Campanayuq Rumi,evenasa village-levelsettlement,hadaspecial connection with Quispisisa. Further,itisinterestingto note that obsidian was not commonly distributed outside of the south-central highlands during the second millennium BC. The limited circu­lation of obsidian seems to re.ect a pattern of local distribution observedatother contemporary

south-centralhighland archaeological sites(Kel­lett et al. 2013). 
In theCampanayuqIPhase, Quispisisa con­tinued tobe thepredominantexploitedsourceof obsidian,butsmall proportionsof obsidian from other sources appear for the .rst time. Among these are local sources such as Puzolana, as well as obsidian from the distant Alca source. The presence of Alca obsidian indicates that Campanayuq Rumi was involved in a wider interaction sphere situated in the south-central highlands. At the same time, obsidian from Lisahuacho and Potreropampa are absent at Campanayuq Rumi at this time. This pattern suggests that obsidianwas principallyexchanged with local trading partners in the south-central highlands.For instance, recent obsidian charac­terizationstudies suggestthat contemporaryset­tlementsintheAndahuaylasregion,suchasWay­waka (Grossman 1972, 1983), obtained obsidian from nearby sources such as Potreropampa and Jampatilla,with lesser quantitiesfrom Quispi­sisa (Burger, Schreiber, Glascock, and Ccen­cho 1998; Burger, Fajardo Rios, and Glascock 2006:112;Kellett et al. 2013). 
The alterations in obsidian procurement in the Campanayuq I Phase correspond with the transformationofCampanayuq Rumi intoalarge ceremonial center. Though Campanayuq Rumi was related to Chavín de Huántar during this phase, there appearstobe littleevidence forthe high-volumeexchangeof obsidian outsideofthe south-central highlands. As mentioned earlier, obsidian is a rare commodity in the Urabarriu PhaseatChavíndeHuántar. Furthermore,there is no obsidian found in other contemporary northernhighland centers such asKunturWasi and Ingatambo during the late Initial Period (Sakai and Shimizu 2002;Yamamoto2014). 
It is notable that during the Campanayuq I Phase there is an increase in the number of sources represented in the obsidian assemblage. Local Puzolana obsidian occursinlow percent-ages;thisshows that this material,though located in close proximity to Campanayuq Rumi, was eschewed as an important location to obtain obsidian. This is probably a result of the rela­tively small size of the nodules that were avail­ableatanyofthedifferent Puzolana source areas (Burger,Bencic, and Glascock 2016). 
Despite thesmall quantitiesofobsidianfrom minor sources, Quispisisa obsidian dominates, pointing to continuity in the close relationship between Campanayuq Rumi and Quispisisa.We argue that in the Campanayuq I Phase, Cam­panayuq Rumi became an agent in pooling obsidian and exchanging it with other south­ern trading partners in the upper valleys of the south coast and other contemporary settle­mentsinCotahuasi, as well as Andahuaylas and Apurímac. 
These conclusions are supported by other lines of archaeological evidence. Comparative analysisofthe ceramic stylesoftheCampanayuq IPhaseshowthat the pottery assemblage shared stylistic af.nities primarily with contemporary assemblages throughout the south-central and southern highlands, and to some extent the south coast(Matsumoto 2018a). Thus,thereis an emerging picture that throughout the Cam­panayuqIPhase, Campanayuq Rumi appearsto have been one of the major centers within an interaction sphere that was associated with the south-centralhighlands. 
Campanayuq Rumi duringthe EarlyHorizon 
Though Quispisisa remains the most important source, artifacts from as many as six additional obsidian sources were used during the Cam­panayuq II Phase. It is worth stressing that the diversity of obsidian at Campanayuq Rumi is greaterthananycontemporary centeroftheEarly Horizon, including Chavín de Huántar, which has obsidianfromfour sources (Quispisisa, Alca, Potreropampa, and Lisahuacho; seeBurger et al. 1984; Burger, Lau, Ponte, and Glascock 2006; Contreras and Nado 2018). 
The diversi.cation of obsidian at Cam­panayuq Rumi serves as a proxy for open net­worksofinteraction duringthe .rst millennium BC. Obsidian from distant sources such as Alca or Anillo,which cametoCampanayuq Rumiin small quantities, canbe interpretedasindicators for ephemeral interactions in which outsiders visitedCampanayuq Rumi as pilgrims or traders, thus producing a cosmopolitan atmosphere rad­ically different from that of the Pre-Platform village. 
This argument is strengthened by other lines of archaeological evidence. Matsumoto(2010,

2018a, 2018b;MatsumotoandCaveroPalomino 2010)observedthat during the Campanayuq II Phase there was an in.ux of ceramic material that shows contact with more distant commu­nitiesthanin theCampanayuqI Phase. Pottery duringthis timeincludes thesudden appearance of Paracas-related assemblages from the south coast of Peru. At the same time that Paracas pottery appears at Campanayuq Rumi, there is a corresponding in.ux of obsidian at Early HorizonParacas settlements(DeLeonardis and Glascock2013;seealsoBurgerand Asaro1977), suggestingexchange relationships between these tworegions.Equally signi.cantisthe appearance of pottery styles with iconographic motifs that are clearly linked to the Janabarriu Phase of Chavín de Huántar (Burger 1984;Matsumoto 2010;Matsumoto and CaveroPalomino 2010). Takentogether,the openingupof interaction net­worksre.ectshowCampanayuq Rumi,and parts of the south-central highlands more generally, becameembedded within theChavínInteraction Sphere duringthe early .rst millennium BC. 
While we stress theimportance that thediver­sity of sources has for understanding changing interaction patterns, it is worth pointing out the information we can infer from sources absent from the assemblage. For example, the sam­ple from Campanayuq Rumi does not contain any obsidian from the Chivay source, which is located in the headwaters of the Colca Valley in the Department of Arequipa, some 340 km to thesoutheastofCampanayuq Rumi (Burger, Asaro, Stross, and Salas 1998:210; Tripcevich and MacKay 2011). Research indicates that duringthe EarlyHorizon, Chivay obsidian was occasionally used at sites in the Cuzco region andmuchmoreheavily consumedatsitessuchas Qaluyu and Chiripa near LakeTiticaca (Burger, Asaro, Stross, and Salas 1998:210; Burger et al. 2000; Tripcevich 2007:229, Figure 3–12). The absenceof Chivay obsidiantherefore pointstoa southern boundaryofinteraction duringtheEarly Horizon,inwhichCampanayuq Rumiwaspartof an interaction sphere oriented toward the south-central and north-centralhighlands, rather than thesouthernhighland regionsof Cuzco orTiti­caca. Conversely,sitesinthe southernhighlands did not exploitQuispisisa obsidian, supporting theargument that this regionwasisolatedfrom the interaction spheres to the north during the EarlyHorizon (Burger et al. 2000:304). 
Campanayuq Rumi and theChavínInteraction Sphere 
As discussed earlier, thereisa dramatic increase in obsidianatChavíndeHuántarin theJanabar­riu Phaseassemblage, and obsidiantoolswerean important component of the crafting economy. This demand for obsidian was linked with a number of socioeconomic changes at Chavín de Huántar,including marked growthof theurban settlement,the presenceof craftspecialists,and emergenceof an elite class(Burger 1984, 1992; Sayre 2010). 
We argue thatby theCampanayuqII Phase, Campanayuq Rumi developed into an important “gateway community”(Hirth 1978)that served as a central redistributive point to provide a reliable.owof obsidiantoChavíndeHuántar and other centers duringthe EarlyHorizon (Mat­sumoto 2010). Campanayuq Rumi was situated on an advantageous trade route that connected this site to theQuispisisa obsidian quarries (cf. Contreras 2011;Matsumoto 2010). 
Demand for Quispisisa obsidian therefore necessitated intensi.ed connections with the south-central highlands. Given the close con­nection with Quispisisa, and its role as the preeminent Early Horizon center of the south-central highlands, we posit that Campanayuq Rumi directedthelong-distance tradeof obsidian to centers such as Chavín de Huántar in the north. This argument is based on several lines of evidence. 
First, one of the unique characteristics of Campanayuq Rumi is its imitation of the archi­tectures and layout of Chavín de Huántar.Sim­ilarities between the two sites include a U-shaped plan and the incorporation of galleries and a sunken circular plaza into the monumen­tal architecture. In contrast, many of the other highland civic-ceremonial centers involved in the Chavín Interaction Sphere, such as Atalla, KunturWasi,andPacopampa,havearchitectural characteristicsthat are quite distinct fromChavín de Huántar.Thefact that Campanayuq Rumi so clearly emulates Chavín de Huántar indicates a unique relationship between these two centers. Oneofthe reasons forthisclose relationshipwas

rooted in Campanayuq Rumi’s access to high-quality Quispisisa obsidian. 
The broader pattern of obsidian distribution in the central highlands in the region situated between Campanayuq Rumi and Chavín de Huántar is a second line of evidence suggest­ing direct trade between the two regions. For instance, Burger (1980) argued that the puna grasslandsof Junínformedaconduitfor camelid caravans transporting obsidian from the south­ernhighlands to the north.Quispisisa obsidian artifactswerefoundinlow quantitiesat remote cave sites in this region, suggesting that cara­vans passedthrough theseareas,resultinginthe exchangeof obsidianastheymovedgoodstothe north. 
A possible exception to this pattern is the civic-ceremonial center of Atalla near Huan­cavelica, where abundant obsidian was reported on the surface (Burger and Matos 2002). Geo­chemical analysis of two .akes demonstrates that they came from Quispisisa (Burger and Matos 2002:169). Recent excavations at Atalla by MichelleYoung have recoveredlarge quan­tities of artifactual obsidian in Early Horizon contexts at the site (Michelle Young, personal communication 2017). It is possible that this obsidianarrivedfromtraders fromCampanayuq Rumi, who used settlements such as Atalla as stopoverpointsonthewaytoChavíndeHuántar. Atalla itselfwasan importantnodeintheChavín Interaction Sphere and its occupants apparently were consumers of the high-quality volcanic glass.We thereforehypothesizethat thespatial patternsofobsidianutilizationspeak toaprob­able direct trading relationship between Cam­panayuq Rumi and Chavín de Huántar, rather than down-the-line exchange. For instance, at Chavín de Huántar we do not see the kinds of fall-offin obsidian quantity thatwouldsuggest down-the-line trade (Renfrew 1975). Obsidian is found in high quantity at Chavín de Huántar, and was distributed widely in the temple core and the residential occupation (Burger 1984, 2013; Burger, Lau, Ponte, and Glascock 2006; Contreras and Nado 2018). This contrasts with thelownumbersofobsidianfoundat coastaland highland centers situated to the north of Chavín de Huántar,such as Cerro Blanco,KunturWasi, and Pacopampa (Burger and Glascock 2009). 
The paucity of obsidian at these centers would appearto demonstratethefall-offpatternsmore indicativeofdown-the-line exchange (Renfrew 1975). 
Long-distance movement of obsidian from the south-central highlands was facilitated by llama caravans. At Campanayuq Rumi, faunal analysis shows that domesticated llamas were a critical component of the economy since Cam­panayuq I times (Matsumoto 2010:344–353). In the central highlands, llamas were used as pack animals forthe transportationofbulk goods such as obsidian during the late Initial Period and EarlyHorizon (Browman 1975;Tripcevich 2010). As pack animals, llamas can carry between 25 and 40 kilograms, depending on the length of the trip (Flores-Ochoa 1979:95). The distance between Campanayuq Rumi and the Quispisisa quarries at Cerro Jichja Parco is roughly 60 km. If llama caravans traveled between 15 and 20 kilometers per 10-hour day (Flores-Ochoa 1979:95; seealsoTripcevich 2007), then a round trip would take somewhere between 8 and 12 days along the high puna routes that linkthetwolocalities. Caravanexpe­ditions between Campanayuq Rumi and Chavín de Huántar consisted of an approximately 600­kilometerjourney(Contreras 2011:386,Table2) whichwouldhave beenaround-trip travel time of at least30days. 
The type of trade that we describe in this paper raisesthe questionofhowthemovementof goods and people over such long distances was structured.Burger(1988)argued that muchofthe Chavínexpansion couldbeexplained throughthe widespread acceptance of a common religious ideology. Shared religion aided in the rapid diffusionofexotic goods and peoplefromdistant localities(Burger 1988,1993,2008,2012,2013). Use of religious mechanisms in long-distance trade has been documented in other parts of theworld. Among theprecolonial IgboofWest Africa, traders were known to travel signi.cant distances under theprotection ofpowerfulora­cles (Northrup 1978).Giventhe architecturaland iconographic evidence, Campanayuq Rumi and other highland centersmayhaveservedas branch shrines (Burger 1988;Matsumoto 2010). Fur­thermore,long-distanceexchangemayhavebeen aided by common language. Recent research

suggests that the Chavín Interaction Sphere partly drove the expansion of Aymara, which mayhaveservedasaprestigious and/or religious lingua franca spoken over a wide swath of highland Peru during the Early Horizon (cf. Burger 2012; Heggarty and Beresford-Jones 2010;Hornborg2014). 


Conclusions 
This paper shows the value of geochemical characterization studies of large assemblages of obsidian and analyzing the results from a diachronic perspective(e.g.,Hirth et al. 2013). By focusing on a single site we have been able to demonstratehow Campanayuq Rumi shifted frominvolvementinalocal interactionsphereto an interregional network centered in the north­centralhighlands. 
In the Pre-Platform and Campanayuq I Phases, Campanayuq Rumi obtained obsidian almostexclusively fromthe Quispisisa obsidian source. We believe that the preponderance of obsidianfromthissourceisaproxyforthe close ties Campanayuq Rumi had with the Quispi­sisa locality. During the Campanayuq I Phase, Campanayuq Rumi appearstohave been one of thelargestcivic-ceremonial centersinthe south­centralhighlands.The accessthat Campanayuq Rumi had to this high-quality obsidian was a factor in the site’s preeminence in a localized interaction sphere centered in the south-central highlands duringthe late Initial Period. 
It is in the subsequent Campanayuq II Phase that we witness a major change in obsidian use. This period is notable for the diverse obsidian sources present at Campanayuq Rumi. The presence of six minor sources serves as a proxy forvisitors who cametothislargecivic­ceremonial center on pilgrimages or for other purposes. Further, these patterns also point to an expansion of the interaction networks that characterize the Chavín Interaction Sphere. As part of the widening interaction spheres of this time period, the ties between Campanayuq Rumi and Chavín de Huántar were particularly pro­nounced. As Chavín de Huántar’s economy was growing during the Janabarriu Phase and social strati.cationwas increasing, demand forexotics fromthe south, including obsidian, cinnabar,and sodalite, strengthened preexisting connections with communitiesinthe south-centralhighland region. We posit that Campanayuq Rumi was critical to supplying Chavín de Huántar with the high-quality obsidian that formed a crucial component of its ritual and political economy. 
These connections stimulated important socioeconomic changes at Campanayuq Rumi, and the south-central highlands more broadly. While the relationship between Campanayuq Rumi and Chavín de Huántar was signi.cant, obsidian analysis likewise con.rms the contin­ued and broadened importance of Campanayuq Rumi as part of a regional interaction sphere centered within thesouth-centralhighlands, one that included portions of Arequipa, Apurímac, and the Peruvian south coast. The existence of a regional interaction sphere in south-central Peru during the Early Horizon is paralleled by a regional interaction sphere in northern Peru that incorporated portionsofhighland Cajamarca and the north coast. These regional interaction spheres articulated with each other to consti­tute the pan-regional Chavín Interaction Sphere. They can be viewed as constituting two of its best-documented components. 
Furthermore, our conclusions shouldprompt a rethinking of regions once thought peripheral to developments in the north-central highlands of Peru during the late Initial Period and Early Horizon and a better appreciation of the role of the prehistoric communities of the south­centralhighlands in producing and transporting the exotic raw materials that were the hallmark of the Chavín Interaction Sphere. At the same time, the transformative power of the Chavín cult and the economic forces associated with it must be taken into account in order to under­stand the socioeconomic changes that occurred at Campanayuq Rumi duringthe .rst millennium BC.
