The Mixteca Alta 

The Mixteca Alta is a temperate and moun­tainous region extending across western Oax­aca, eastern Guerrero, and southwestern Puebla. Spores (1972:22,172) established the original Mixtec ceramic chronology based on strati­graphic excavations in the Nochixtlán Valley, and further chronological re.nementsfollowed (SupplementalText 1). 
According to Spores(1972), Ramos-period ceramicsinclude Juanito.negraywaresanddec­orated grays (including G-12 and G-17),Yucuita tan wares, red-on-tan wares, thin tan wares, polished brown wares, and Stucco wares. For theClassic period, Spores notes the appearance of Chachoapan sandy cream wares, Miguelito hardgrays,Tio Lico thin grays (G-12 and G-17 vessels disappear), Nochixtlán rust wares, and Chachoapan orange wares. 
Chachoapan orange wares as Classic-period chronologicalmarkersarewell establishedinthe literature (Gaxiola 1984:35; Kowalewski et al. 2009:373; Plunket Nagoda 1983:409; Spores 1972:182;Winter 2006:103; SupplementalText 1). Regional surveys have dated settlements to the Classic period based on the surface pres­enceof orangewares, with thevesselform and other surface characteristics determining exact temporal placement. In particular, Transition-period orange-ware collections include conical bowlswith channel or stepped rims and jars with restricted necks decorated by vertical surface smoothing. 
The most common Ramos-period ceramics weretheYucuitatanwares,which comeinawide arrayofforms and colors(Spores 1972:52–56). They arepredominantly cooking vessels,jars, and comals,aswellas someopenservingvessels, whichSpores assignedtotheMarianaand Alicia

varieties. Spores’sde.nitionofthe Alicia-variety tanwares includes orangevarietiesthat “become much more frequentinLasFloresthanin Ramos times”(Spores 1972:56),suggestingthat orange­coloredYucuita tans can occurin Ramos-period contexts. 
Investigators working at Late and Terminal Formative sites across the Mixteca Alta have also noted the presence of orange (or yellow-pinkish) ceramics. At Monte Negro, Acosta and Romero(1992:75) found ochre and yellow-pinkish materials occurring with Zapotec-style graywares (G12)of theMonte Albán LateI period. At Yucuita and Huamelulpan, scholars have also noted thepresenceof what theycalled yellow-orange paste materials in Late and Ter­minalFormativeassemblages(Winter 2006:97, 99).Plunket Nagoda(1983:22, 412) described Late Cruz–periodLaNopaleraorange ceramics and T-1 variety tan wares, which encompass orange-color materials datingtoAD150–350.At Huamelulpan, Gaxiola(1984:33–37) identi.ed yellow and cream wares, dating to 100 BC–AD 200, and orange ceramics dating to AD 200– 
600.Abroad pattern canbe identi.ed from these .ndings at MonteNegro,Yucuita, and Huamelul­pan: each site features an orange-yellowceramic ware, typically in the serving-vessel category. This ware has sometimes been placed in its own category and at other times within the Yucuita tanwaresof theMariana orT-1 varieties. 
This article de.nes a new ceramic ware we call Tiltepec yellow wares. Based on 27 asso­ciated radiocarbon dates,weshowthatTiltepec yellowwares appear with theinitial occupation of Cerro Jazmín at cal. 261±75BC (Early Ramos period) and continue until cal. AD 273±45 (Transition period).Although conventional prac­tices would associate the yellow ware with the tan wares, we believe otherwise: yellow wares should not be included in thetan-ware category since they have a distinct, .ner clay body and adifferent color range; furthermore,they served different primaryuses(serving andwaterstorage vessels). 
Methodology 

We selected 27 radiocarbon dates from artifact-associated contexts(Table1) and extrapolated 
to contexts with the same stratigraphic place­ment and location, yielding 29 date-associated ceramic assemblages.All ceramics weresorted byware, hardness, form,surface .nish, and dec­oration.Forthe29 assemblages, we calculated the total number of wares by vessel form and grouped them into three chronological categories (Table2).We calculated the percentages of dif­ferentvesselformsforallthewaresineach time period and created two functional categories: serving(bowls, plates, and vases) and cooking and storage vessels (jars, comals, and water jugs). Within each category, we investigated chronological shifts in decoration and form. 
We performed these calculations for the 29 assemblages, bodies, and rims. To make our results comparablewith previous studies,weran our analysisagainfor rims,supports, and deco­rated bodies.Chi-squaretestinginboth iterations of the analysis identi.ed statistically signi.cant chronological shifts.Toidentifywhichwaresor forms were responsible for the statistical sig­ni.cance, we performed the chi-square tests on pairs, comparingeachwareorformcategorywith the entireremaining assemblage.We submitted 53 ceramic samples for Instrumental Neutron ActivationAnalysis (INAA) at theOregon State University Archaeometry Laboratory. 
Results 

We documented Yucuita tan wares, Nochixtlán gray wares, Yucuita polished brown wares (or .ne brown wares), rust wares, and our proposed Tiltepec yellow wares, which we de.ne for the .ner-paste pinkish-orange-yellow ceramics (Figure2). The de.nition of Tiltepec yellow wares reduces the array of paste textures and colors currently encompassed by Yucuita tan wares.Yellowwareshaveamuch .nerclaybody than tan wares, with few or no small inclusions. When visible, themost common inclusions are small(<1mm) white .ecks of calcite, 1–2 mm gray and white inclusions,or .nelyground mica temper.Yellow-ware pastesare as .ne as thatof thegray wares. 
INAA results also supporttheware de.nition: yellowwaresfall into two compositional groups that suggest a Mixteca regional manufacture (SupplementalTable2).Twosubgroups within

the larger compositional groups also contain examples of gray wares; it appears that the primarydifference between theseMixteca-made gray and yellow wares is the oxidizing environ­mentin whichthe yellowwares were .red. 
Yellow wares come in soft and hard paste varieties. Soft clay bodies, which correspond to 1aand2a, arespongy, porous,andpowderyin consistency. They erode easily and often show smoothed edges.The clay body is not compact and crumbles easily.The hard pastes correspond exclusively to subgroup 1c; they are compact, smooth, not as erodible, and oftenretainintact surface .nishes. When broken, they snap, pro­ducingahigh-pitched sound that suggests higher temperatures of .ring. 
The surface color of yellow wares can be orange-yellow,yellowish-tan, or peach-to-cream color,usually withayellowororange core(5YR 6/6, 6/8, 7/6, and 7/8reddish-yellows,5YR 7/4 pink, 5YR6/4 light reddish-brown, and 7.5YR 7/6 reddish-yellow, 7/4 and 6/6 pink, and 6/4 light brown).

the surface color is mottled, showing areas of yellow-orange to gray-black. The vessel surface wassmoothed,butnot polished. 
In our sample, <10% of yellow wares show red-orange paint or slip decoration. The most common vessels are conical bowls with .at or convexbases(Figure2 and Supplemental Figure 1).Bowls rangefrom8 cmto50cmin diameter (¯x = 24.18 cm). Among serving vessels, 12% of EarlyRamos, 32% of Late Ramos, and 26% of Transitiondisplay an interior channel or stepped-rim decoration.Aneven smaller numberofbowls have incised line or nail-print decorations along the bottom. This style is reminiscent of the G­21bowlsthatCasoand colleagues(1967:61–62) foundin MonteAlbánII contexts. 
Less common vessels are cylindrical vases (¯x = 17.7 cm) with exterior channel rims and small-to-medium-sized water jugs with restricted, small, straight-to-.aring necks with vertical smoothing(¯x = 10.97 cms).Water jugs areverythin, globular,3–4 mm thick, and mostly of the hard paste variety. Closed vessel forms indicate that the orange surface color was the result of .ring, because water jugs have orange exteriors and gray interiors. 
Chronological Trends 

Tiltepec yellow wares are the second most common ceramic type in all the Cerro Jazmín assemblages; they were present from the Early Ramos period(36%)through theLateRamos (37%) andTransition(60%) periods(Table2). Their numberis doublethatof graywaresinthe serving-vessel category and surpasses the gray waresthroughout theFormative-period occupa­tionofthe city. 
Across all phases, gray, .ne brown, and yellow wares represent nearly 90% of serving vessels, while tan and rust wares comprise over 89%of cooking vessels(Table2).Yellow and gray wares have more compact clay bodies, and many were .red at higher temperatures, improvingtheir ability to retain liquids. 
Trendsinvesselform,surface decoration,and relative proportions among wares were found to be chronologically signi.cant. We observed statistically signi.cant changes in the relative frequenciesofwares between theEarly Ramos and Late Ramos assemblages (Table2). The proportion of tan wares signi.cantly decreased as the proportion and frequency of .ne brown wares and graywaresincreased. Thefrequency of yellowwares remained constant.Signi.cant changes also occurred between theLateRamos andTransition periods(Table2): theproportion of yellow wares increased, while gray and tan wares decreased. 
Since differentwareswerepreferred accord­ingtodifferentvesselfunctions,weinvestigated trends within functional categories. Among cooking vessels, the frequency of tan-ware jars decreased through time, while rust-ware jars increased and comals remained statistically unchanged throughoutthe entiresequence. There was a signi.cant increase in the prevalence of yellow-warewaterjugs andanotable, though not signi.cant, decreaseingray-ware jugs between theLateRamos andTransition periods(Table2). 
Decorated vases are associated across Mesoamerica with beverage consumption during feasts and other ritual settings. In the Early Ramos period, cylindrical vases were made using gray, tan, yellow, and .ne brown wares, but this diversity decreased over time. By theTransition period, nearly allvases were producedin yellowware(Table2). 
Bowls were also prominent vessels in pri­vate or public food-consumption events. The yellow-ware servingvessels were predominantly conical in theEarly Ramos period(87%)but their frequencydeclined, while theproportionof semihemisphericalbowls andvasesincreasedto comprise43%ofyellow-ware servingvesselsby theTransition period(Table2). 
We investigated surface-and rim-decoration changesinbowls(Table2).IntheCerro Jazmín collections, G-12 and G-17 vessels were pre­dominantly gray, while G-21–style bowls were more often yellowwares.The frequencyofG-12 bowls decreased from the Early Ramos to the Late Ramos andTransition periods.G-17bowls went fromscarcein theEarly Ramos periodto a near-disappearance in the Transition period. Thefrequency ofyellowwareG-21–stylebowls also decreased, from 17% in Early Ramos, to 15% in Late Ramos, to 5% in the Transition period. As these types decreased signi.cantly, thefrequencyofyellow-ware channel-rimbowls

increased signi.cantly. Channel-rim decoration wasrecordedin27%of EarlyRamosvessels,and of these 80% were yellow wares. Channel-rim frequencies increasedto54%intheLateRamos period and 75%by theTransition period, when nearly allofthem (97%)were yellowwares. 
Discussion 

We have argued for the de.nition of Tiltepec yellow wares as a distinct ceramic type. Some may ask, however, why Tiltepec yellow wares should not simply be grouped with the Cha­choapan orange wares. In Spores’s (1972:64– 66) description of Chachoapan orange wares, he mentions only two varieties: (i) Susana thin oranges, likelyimported andvery similartothe ones at Teotihuacan; and (ii) Anita .ne orange wares,.neintextureandpowderyinpastebody. Neither of these varieties re.ects the diversity of materialsatCerro Jazmín—the hardness and high-.red qualities of the hard yellow wares or the coarser clay bodies with visible white inclusions. Spores(1972) de.ned Chachoapan orange wares asClassic-period materials, while radiocarbon datashowthat theTiltepec yellow wares date to the Late or Terminal Formative periods. 
In addition,previous scholarshavementioned yellow wares: Caso and colleagues (1967:55) mention yellow wares (amarillos) at Monte Albán, describingthem as unmistakablydiffer­ent fromtanwares(cafés)in their texture and .nish. Furthermore, although called amarillos, some of them are actually orange, pink, or brick­colored.TheyappearrarelyintheMonteAlbánI collections,and more frequentlyin MonteAlbán II (LateRamos period). 
Among the yellow wares that Caso and col­leagues(1967:60) describe, theymentionanA6 type—G-12-like vessels made in a pale pink paste—and an A5 type—very thin, high-.red, pale pink vessels similar to the hard-paste yel­low wares. In Monte Albán II, A9 and A11 vessels arealsoreported(Caso et al. 1967:70), with descriptions reminiscent of the yellow-ware conical bowls with G-21–like incised line dec­oration. Nevertheless, the decorations reported in the Monte Albán vessels are more complex than thosewe observed atCerro Jazmín. Some yellow-warebowlswereproducedor traded into MonteAlbán,butthey were still a minority. 
Conclusion 

By de.ning Tiltepec yellow wares and setting them apart from Classic-period orange ceram­ics, we may reassess the regional settlement sequence, which currently describes a pattern ofTerminalFormativesettlement abandonment. We are currently undertaking this reassess­ment,butadiscussionof preliminary resultsis beyond the scope of this report. In the case of CerroJazmín,however,the correct chronological placementofTiltepec yellowwares demonstrates that the settlement was continuously occupied between 300 BC and AD 300 and that the urban occupation was longer-lived than previ­ously thought. 
The new ceramic data also suggest that althoughValleyofOaxaca graywareswereused at CerroJazmín,their frequencydecreased from the Late to Terminal Formative and Transition periods, just as the frequency of yellow-ware servingvessels increased (Pérez Rodríguez et al. 2017).Joyce and colleagues(2006)identi.eda similar pattern from theLate andTerminalFor­mative periodLower RíoVerde region, attribut­ingthe decreaseinZapotec-stylegraywaresin favor of locally made ceramics to con.ict and trade-routedisruption. 
When Cerro Jazmín was .rst being estab­lished,theuseof ceramicssimilartothoseused at Monte Albán may have served the political purposes of local elites. Then, as the new city grew in in.uence, its inhabitants shifted their political strategies, favoring the use of locally made wares to express the independence and transformative culturalpowerof theircity.
