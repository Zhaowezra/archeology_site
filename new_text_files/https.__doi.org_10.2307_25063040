be randomly imitated. These kinds of artifact traits are more likely to identify the social groups in the archae­ological record that should be the focus of migration explanations. Given the currently available data, how­ever, Curet must rely on culture historical styles and the other ceramic categories largely defined by decoration to track possible migrations. 
In Chapter 4 Curet examines two important proposed migrations in the Caribbean: the Saladoid-La Hueca migration approximately 300 B.C. and the Ostionoid expansion around A.D. 600. Curet recounts Rouse's explanation for the appearance of Saladoid ceramics in the Caribbean. The Saladoid series represent a single group of horticulturalists that migrated from the Orinoco to the Caribbean, replaced (possibly through violence) the indigenous aceramic hunter-gatherers in the islands, and stopped in Puerto Rico because at that point the Sal­adoid peoples encountered a formidable indigenous pop­ulation on Hispaniola to the west. Curet argues that this explanation does not account for the lack of evidence for violent interaction between migrant and indigenous groups, the social processes associated with the cessa­tion of migration in Puerto Rico, or the demographic structure of Saladoid groups. Unfortunately, there is lit­tle unambiguous archaeological evidence to investigate these topics. 
The second proposed migration is the Ostionoid expansion and again Curet, identifies Rouse's explana­tion as the most accepted among Caribbean archaeolo­gists. According to Rouse, the wide distribution of Ostionoid ceramics reflects the cultural evolution of Puerto Rican Saladoid cultural groups into Ostionoid cultural groups. Then Ostionoid peoples migrated mainly to the west replacing the disappearing hunter­gatherers. Curet, drawing on the work of Keegan and Chanlatte Baik, develops an alternative scenario where Ostionoid horticulturalists and the contemporary hunter­gatherers interacted, exchanging genetic and cultural information across multiple islands. Thus the Ostionoid expansion might be characterized less as a migration and more as part migration, part enculturation, part inter­breeding, and part technology transfer, in concert with environmental change, and social processes. This sce­nario better fits current understanding of the Caribbean archaeological record. 
Chapters 5, 6, and 7 also present demographic analy­ses at increasingly smaller analytical scales. In Chapter 5, Curet analyzes settlement pattern changes over time at four regions in Puerto Rico and the nearby island of Vieques. Settlement patterns are described by site size, location (coastal or interior), and the presence of mon­umental architecture. Rising population, measured by number of sites, is identified across all regions, with some regions experiencing population dips late in the pre-Columbian sequence. In Chapter 6 Curet evaluates the relationship between population pressure and increasing sociopolitical complexity in the valley of Maunabo on the southeastern coast of Puerto Rico. To assess population pressure arguments, Curet conserva­tively estimates carrying capacity of the valley based on both protein needs and total consumption of different cultigens. Changes in population size over time are esti­mated by applying an ethnographically derived formula to sites of different sizes and ages. Curet concludes that population levels in the valley of Maunabo rose, but never approached any conservative estimate of carrying capacity. Thus the development of social stratification here, and possibly in other regions of the Caribbean, is not explained by population pressure arguments. Chap­ter 7 is the final analytical chapter and contains an exploratory paleodemographic analysis of skeletal assemblages from three sites on Puerto Rico. Curet sum­marizes osteological data relevant to sex distribution, age-at-death distribution, and fertility rates represented by these assemblages. The numerous uncontrollable biases in the assemblages preclude any firm recon­struction of past population variation, but Curet is cor­rect to point out that paleodemographic analyses should be performed on other Caribbean assemblages to gen­erate a more accurate picture of the past. 
In the concluding chapter Curet summarizes the vol­ume's findings and reiterates his two themes. First, pale­odemographic analyses conducted at multiple scales are necessary for accurate reconstructions of ancient life. Second, accurate reconstructions must also articulate the social processes that shaped the archaeological record and the culture historical units typically used in the Caribbean are not appropriate for this task. This last point bears elaboration as it is an instance of a general problem faced not only in the Caribbean, but also in the Pacific and other regions. Culture historical styles or types were originally employed to measure changing artifact frequencies and construct assemblage chronolo­gies. Types were successful because they were defined for a particular problem, creating chronologies, and their performance toward solving this problem could be empirically evaluated against an associated model of temporal change. However, when we apply a previ­ously constructed culture historical type to a new prob­lem, identifying enculturation for example, we cannot empirically evaluate the type's performance. Artifact types and classifications must be created to address par­ticular problems and associated explanatory models. Curet has demonstrated that new artifact classifications are needed to address current interests in Caribbean archaeology.
