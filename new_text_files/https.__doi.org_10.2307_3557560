
FROM STEWARDS TO BUREAUCRATS: 
ARCHI TEC TURE AND INFORMATION FLOW AT CHAN CHAN, PERU 

John R. Topic 
Archaeologists working with complex societies are concerned with the administration of political economies. Beginning with the premise that there are differing 
forms of administration and that bureaucracy, in the classic formulation of Max Weber, is one of these, I develop a heuristic dichotomy between two types of administrators: stewards (who closely super­vise goods and people) and bureaucrats (who process and control information). Bureaucracy is often linked to written records, but in the Central Andes alternative methods of record keeping were developed, such as the quipu or knotted string record. I argue that one alternative record-keeping device was an architectural form, the U-shaped structure. U-shaped structures are closely identified with the administrative architecture of the Chimu kingdom (ca. A.D. 850-1470) on the north coast of Peru. Four independent lines of argument demonstrate the development of bureaucracy from stewardship at Chan Chan, the capital of the Chimu kingdom. Brief comparisons are made between the Chimu administrative pattern and commodity and information flow in the earlier Huari and Tiwanku civilizations, and with the later Inka pattern. These comparisons show how record-keeping technology affects political economy and the strategy of expansion. 
Arque6logos investigando las sociedades complejas tienen interes en la administraci6n de la economia politica. Afirmo que hay varias formas de administraci6n publica y que la burocracia, en la formulaci6n cldsica de Max Weber, es una de estas formas. Desarrollo una dicotomfa heuristica entre dos tipos de administradores: mayordomos (quienes vigilan acerca de las productos almacenados) y burocratas ( quienes trabajan con informacion acerca de las productos almacenados). El desarrollo de la burocracia es generalmente asociado con la escritura, pero en Los andes centrales otras maneras de registrar y archivar informacion se desarrollaban. Mi tesis es que una manera alternativa andina utilizaba una forma arquitectonica especial: la estructura en forma de "U." Etas estructuras ocurren comunmente en la arquitectura administrativa def reino de Chimu (ca. 850-1470 d.C.), costa norte peruana. Presento cuatro pruebas independientes mostrando coma la burocracia desarrollaba de{ mayordom{a en Chan Chdn, capital del reino Chimu. Haga comparaciones breves entre el patron administrativo Chimu y lo conocido de los patrones administrativos en las culturas Huari y Tiwanaku, antecesores a las Chimues, yen la cultura lnka que sucedio a las Chimues. Las comparaciones demuestran coma la tecnolog{a de registrar y archivar informacion afecta la 
economfa polftica y la estrategia de expansion estatal. 
Genuine history has no room for the merely probable or the merely possible; all it permits the historian to assert is what the evidence before him obliges him to assert [Colling­wood 1994:204]. 
ince V. Gordon Childe (1950), archaeolo­Sgists have debated the role of writing in ancient civilizations. Considered as just a trait, like monumental art or craft specialization, its importance in defining civilization is not clear (e.g., Braidwood 1967: 137; Sabloff and Lamberg­Karlovsky 1974:1 ). Structurally, however, writing differentiated at least three classes of people: scribes, people (who may or may not have been lit­
erate themselves) who controlled scribes, and non­li terate people (e.g., Houston 1994; Weber 1946:229). 
Even more important, writing set up a new source of power that the historical sociologist Max Weber ( 1946:232-239) first clearly recognized and defined: the control of information. For Weber, the control of information resulted in the formation of bureaucracy in the same way that the control of wealth resulted in the formation of classes, the dis­tribution of prestige resulted in the formation of sta­tuses, and the distribution of political authority resulted in the formation of factions. He viewed bureaucracy as a form of management in which

areas of jurisdiction are fixed and ordered by rules and regulations, resulting in a stable distribution of authority across a group of officials who are able to impose sanctions and are employed in their offices because they have the requisite qualifica­tions to fulfill their duties. 
Bureaucracy, strictly defined, is a very impor­tant component of civilization and the state. Bureaucracy is part of the complex of institutions that organizes power in state-level societies (Fried 1967:Chapter 6; Service 1975). It forms an admin­istrative interface between the rulers and the ruled that acts as the agency of control, in large part by controlling sources of information and communi­cation. The bureaucracy, functioning efficiently by well-ordered rules, not only helps to legitimate the governing structure, but also stabilizes it; the sta­bilization is achieved in part by establishing the means to perpetuate itself. 
In the study of precolumbian states, wealth and political authority are frequently discussed and, increasingly, in precise terms (Brumfiel and Fox 1994); the role of prestige in legitimizing both chiefdoms and states has also been addressed (Helms 1979; Yoffee 1991). The discussion of the role of bureaucracy has not been as clear, except in the cases of the Aztec and lnka, in which ethno­historic evidence has been especially useful. 
In this paper I argue that true bureaucracy devel­oped for the first time in the Andes at Chan Chan, the capital of the Chimu kingdom. Bureaucracy, however, is not the only possible form of adminis­tration in complex societies. The bureaucratic form of administration has been contrasted to the seiior­ial form, where the administration of the state is con­ducted through coopting the offices of traditional local lords (e.g., Netherly 1990), in a manner some­what similar to, though not equivalent to, the feu­dal system. The degree to which administration takes either the seiiorial or the bureaucratic form is related to contrasting concepts of territorial and hegemonic states (e.g., D' Altroy 1992). These dif­ferent forms of administration are not necessarily mutually exclusive and there can be continuity, and mixing, of the forms within a single complex soci­ety. For example, I argue that bureaucracy devel­oped at Chan Chan and characterized the late form of administration in the Chimu capital but that the provinces were administered through a seiiorial form. While complex societies can be administered in a variety of ways, at some point large territorial states will need a central core of administrators that gather, process, and store information about the state, its resources, and its governance. In most states this involves the development of writing systems, but in the Andes alternative methods of record keep­ing were developed. 
Bureaucracy and Writing 
Because bureaucracy is based on the control and processing of information, an archaeological cor­relate of bureaucracy is a method for physically pre­serving and transmitting information. The existence of writing (or, better, recording) systems allows for the development of bureaucracy, but recording sys­tems can also be used for nonbureaucratic fonns of expression. Santley ( 1989), for example, distin­guishes between Mesoamerican public texts on stela and private documents in the form of codices; while both are used to legitimize the ruling elite, the different audiences for the two types of texts suggests that private documents correspond to more centralized (i.e., bureaucratic) political systems. Similarly, in a comparative analysis of Maya and Mesopotamian political systems, Yoffee (1991 :287-292) finds that the Weberian trichotomy of wealth, prestige, and authority may be sufficient to understand the exercise of power, since the glyphs displayed on public monuments are largely used to legitimize the power and prestige of the rulers. Again, the more private documents, rather than public monuments, record the kinds of infor­mation typical of bureaucratic management, such as tribute lists, and in Mesoamerica these only appear in the Postclassic and Colonial periods. 
Hence, documenting the presence of an elabo­rated system of symbolic representation, which has been done for several pre-Inkaic Andean civiliza­tions, is not equivalent to demonstrating the exis­tence of bureaucracy. Moreover, the control of know ledge, often esoteric in nature, is also a source 
of power in nonbureaucratic chiefly societies, so that documenting restricted access to infonnation is not equivalent to documenting the existence of bureaucracy either. Documenting bureaucracy entails the difficult prospect of defining a highly structured set of officials who operate to control and process information.

However, as important as bureaucracy is to the functioning of state-level societies, in recent stud­ies of the pre-Inkaic Tiwanaku and Huari empires (e.g., Isbell and McEwan 1991; Kolata 1993; Schreiber 1992), the discussion of bureaucracy is attenuated. The term "bureaucracy" is sometimes used (e.g., Isbell 1991:301; Kolata 1993:230), but 
administration is discussed largely in terms of site hierarchies rather than in terms of information recording and flow. In both cases, extended analo­gies are also made to the Inka political economy, in which land and labor were converted into goods that financed state activities (e.g., Kolata 1993:206-214; Schreiber 1992:Chapter 2). We know from ethnohistoric sources that the flow of labor and goods in the Inka empire was meticu­lously documented and controlled by a bureau­cracy. However, the administration of the Inka political economy involved the management of large-scale storage facilities (e.g., D' Altroy and Earle 1985 and commentary following), while evi­dence for large-scale storage is not available for Tiwanaku (e.g., Janusek 2002:49) and has been questioned for Huari (Anders 1991; McEwan 1991, 1996). Hence, the assumption that Huari and Tiwanaku were bureaucratic centralized states remains undocumented. Indeed, alternative per­spectives on both Huari and Tiwanaku de-empha­size the bureaucratic nature of these cultures, and to some extent the degree of political centraliza­tion (Albarracin-Jordan 1996; Bauer and Stanish 2001 :38-42; Bermann 1997; Graffam 1990, 1992; Janusek 2002; Jennings and Craig 2001; Stanish 1994; Topic and Topic 1992, 2000). 
While it is acknowledged that bureaucracy, espe­cially when it employs perishable materials to record information, is difficult to study archaeologically, we cannot simply assume that cultures pre-dating the Inka by almost a millenium employed similarly sophisticated administrative practices. Since bureau­cratic forms of control can be expected to develop over a period of time, the archaeological docu­mentation of bureaucracy is important to our under­standing of the evolution of the state. 
The case study presented here supports the argu­ment that in the Andean context, true bureaucracy (i.e., a group of officials who process and control information) developed from the more "hands-on" direct administration of goods and labor. As a heuristic dichotomy, I refer to the "hands-on" administrators of real goods as stewards and reserve the term bureaucrats for administrators who are concerned with the control of information flow. However, in reality bureaucratic administrations will also have stewards in the lower levels of the administrative hierarchy. Still, the terms have a developmental connotation that is probably appro­priate: the term "steward(s)" refers to the chief ser­vants of a large household or court, while the term "bureaucrat(s)" implies an institutionalized "ratio­nal-legal authority." 
Andean Recording Methods 
Since I argue that a class of architecture, the U­
shaped structures 1 at Chan Chan, functioned as a 
means of recording information, it is useful to 
review the general principles used in Andean 
recording systems. I draw on archaeological, eth­
nohistoric, and ethnographic information to illus­
trate the common principles employed in recording 
information in a variety of media. 
The best-known Andean record-keeping device 
is the quipu (Ascher and Ascher 1981; Locke 1923; 
Mackey 1970; Mackey et al. 1990; Radicati di 
Primeglio 1979; Urton 2001). Quipu are made of 
string or yarn, usually with a long header string to 
which pendent strings are attached (Figure 1). The 
pendent strings have knots that record information. 
Quipu are known to have existed since the Middle 
Horizon (approximately A.D. 550--1000) (Conklin 
1982; Pereyra S. 1997 ),2 but are best known and 
understood from the Late Horizon (i.e., Inka period: 
A.D. 1476-1532) and early years of the Colonial period (e.g.,A.D. 1532--ca. 1653)3; quipu continue to be used in some rural areas even today. 
The quipu could record numbers, but it is a mnemonic device (a memory aid); hence, like many other New World recording methods, it was not designed to precisely record speech (Boone 1994; Mignolo 1994:229). The quipucamayoc (official who kept and read the quipu) needed to remember what each string signified, but knowing this, he could read the numbers off it readily. The numbers were recorded by different kinds of knots and the order of magnitude (1, 10, 100, 1000, etc.) was indicated by the location of the knot on the string (Cieza de Leon 1985:30--31 [1553]; Garcilaso de 
. la Vega 1966:330 [1609 and 1617]).

Top row, from left: a chasqui (runner stationed along the royal roads) carrying a quipu labelled "carla" (letter); an administrator of a province; the secretary of the Inka. Bottom: treasurer, with quipu and yupana (abacus); administrator of a Suyu, or Quarter of the empire showing accounts 
to the Inka among a group of storerooms. 
The basic structural characteristics of the quipu, then, consist of numeric values recorded in a par­ticular place that has predefined values. This is very similar to how the Spanish viewed memory aids (cf. Cummins 1994:193-194),4 and they not only recognized the quipu as a valid form of informa­tion recording but they were also quite willing to accept it as the basis for expert testimony (Acosta 1940:290-292 [1590]; Callapifia 1974 [1542]; Cieza de Leon 1985:32 [1553]; Sarmiento 1907:41--43 [1572]). 
The basic structure of the quipu informational system was augmented by a few other characteris­tics. First, a number of strings could be combined into a single larger quipu in order to record differ­ent categories within a single quipu record (Figure 1 ). To facilitate remembering the different cate­gories represented by each string, they were some­times coded by color, the direction the string had been spun, the thickness of the string, etc. (Calan­cha 1974-82:203-206 [ 1638]; Garcilaso de la Vega 1966:330 [1609 and 1617]; Mackey 1970:Chap­ters II and VI). Thus, qualitative values and not just numeric values are important to the structure of information recording. 

Moreover, at least by late Inka times, the cate-

gories recorded on a series of strings within a quipu were organized in a standard order based on the rel­ative importance of the items (Calancha 1974-82:204-205 [1638]; Garcilaso de la Vega 1966:330 [1609 and 1617]; Murra 1975, 1982). This correlation of cognitive ranking with the sequential ordering of the strings again emphasizes 
· 
the structural importance of the place, with prede­fined value, in which qualitative or numerical val­ues are recorded. 
Although Cobo (1979:254 [1653]) noted that the quipucamayoc could not understand each other's quipu, there is actually quite a bit of standardiza­tion among Late Horizon quipu. For example, two basic kinds of quipu have been recognized: quan­titative quipu, in which the numbers on different strings can be shown to be related to each other arithmetically (e.g., one string sums others), and quipu in which the numbers on the strings seem to serve as labels, rather than as arithmetic quantities (Ascher 1990). The knots are themselves stan­dardized, so that there are usually only three dif­ferent kinds of knots and these are used preferentially to denote the units or the higher num­bers. Moreover, sequences of color combinations recur frequently within a single quipu or within associated lots of quipu, demonstrating another form of standardization, at least within the quipu used by a single quipucamayoc (Mackey 1970: 76-77). 
It is these types of standardizations and pat­temings that allow even modem researchers to be able to read the numbers and have a sense of the structure of the ancient quipu. Indeed, an indica­tion that quipucamayoc could decipher each other's quipu, if given an idea of the content and structure of the quipu, is their apparent use in the "postal ser­vice" by chasqui (runners stationed along the royal roads) who relayed messages along the imperial road system (Garcilaso de la Vega 1966:328-329 [ 1609 and 1617]; Guaman Poma de Ayala 1980:202-204 [1615]; Mackey 1970:19). As the quipu was passed from runner to runner, a short ver­bal description of the contents would also be passed along (Figure 1). 
Coho's comment, though, is also valid. There certainly is evidence for idiosyncrasy among the quipu andquipucamayoc, especially in terms of the significance of colors. They were, after all, intended as mnemonic devices to aid oral recitation. More­over, Cobo (1979:254 [1653]) goes on to say that there were many different quipus for different things, that the quipucamayoc were trained very carefully in their use, and that those who had not been trained were not able to understand the quipu; thus his comment occurs in the context of such Weberian bureaucratic concepts as fixed jurisdic­tions for officials, the need for officials to develop requisite skills, and the privileging of information (Weber 1946). 

There were numerous officials, each with his own area of competence, and these formed an administrative hierarchy. The pictures and text in the chronicle of Guaman Poma (1980:335-365 [1615]) gives one list of officials (Figure l).A vari­ety of officials kept track of the contents of store­rooms, the herds, and the affairs of individual towns; these accountants, like stewards, would be in direct contact with the goods, animals, and peo­ple for which they had responsibility. An adminis­trator of a province was a true bureaucrat who gathered information together for a region. This might include the number of men, women, and children; the marital status of these individuals; the number of llamas and alpacas; the amount of trib­ute paid in potatoes, honey, and coca leaf; the num­ber of stone masons drafted, and so forth. All these need never be physically in one place at one time to be counted, but the information could be recorded on a single quipu or a series of quipu. Both the local accountants and regional administrators kept largely statistical information. Officials such as the secretary of the Inka recorded more histori­cal or textual information, assisted by philosophers and poets (amautas and arawicus) who made up stories and poems based on this information (Calan­cha 1974-82:204-208 [1638]; Garcilaso de la Vega 1966:332 [1609 and 1617]); the recitation of the story or poem was prompted by quipu in which the attributes, such as colors, knots, thickness of cords, etc., acted as labels rather than as arithmetic infor­mation. 
Other aspects of Andean record keeping were methods of gathering data and performing calcu­lations. The Andean abacus, or yupana (Figure 1 ), illustrated by Guaman Poma 1980:360 [1615]) is interesting, because it is again based on the princi­ple of representing numeric values in particular

places with predefined values. Guaman Poma's 
drawing shows a simple array of cells, consisting 
of 5 rows and 4 columns; the array of cells could 
simply be marked on the ground by drawing some 
lines in the dirt, drawn on a piece of cloth, or per­
haps carved in wood or stone. Although there is 
some debate about exactly how the abacus func­
tioned, each cell had a numerical value and calcu­
lations were performed by moving markers-a 
stone, bean, maize kernel, quinoa seed-from one 
cell to another; early historical accounts indicate 
that they could perform calculations from one to 
100,000 (Acosta 1940:291-292 [1590]; Guaman 
Poma 1980:360-361 [1615]; Pereyra 1990; Wassen 
1990). 
Modem Andean peasants still keep track of herds and harvests by using very simple counting and recording techniques. Potatoes and maize are counted in groups of ten, with one potato or ear set aside for each group; then the "10s" are counted in the same manner, setting aside one potato or ear to represent a hundred, until a final figure is arrived at and recorded on a quipu (Nunez del Prado 1990). Larco (1942: 100-101, 194 3 :352) reports that beans of different types and colors are used to represent animals in a herd or the warps in a textile; again, the physical objects (beans in this case) used by individual herders and weavers can later be recorded on quipu. However, in the first instance, the recording is easier to accomplish by using a physical object as a counter. Thus, for example, a herder counting sheep being herded into a corral might drop a stone (a marker) into one pile for every female and into another for every male (places with predefined values). The recording is instantaneous and can be transferred later to the portable quipu. 
The organization of these modem quipu varies much more than that of the classic Inka quipu (Mackey 1970), so they cannot be read by other people. But the herder himself can read it to a higher-level administrator who transfers the infor­mation, in Spanish, into the hacienda's accounts. 
These Andean examples help us understand that there are two different kinds of administrators that I have distinguished as stewards and bureaucrats. 5 
The stewards count the sheep or other goods as they 
come in and out and they can record and report these 
observations. Bureaucrats, like the higher-level lnka administrators or modem hacienda adminis­trators, need never count the sheep, but they can record, store, pass on to their bosses, and manipu­late the received information about them. There is continuity between the functioning of stewards and bureaucrats, but large and complex organizations cannot function with stewards alone; they also must have bureaucrats. 
The Archaeology of Bureaucracy 
While we have considerable ethnohistoric and archaeological evidence for the function of the Inka administration, administrative functions in the Mid­dle Horizon "empires" have been inferred largely from site size hierarchies. 6 In the case of Huari, the sites often have very similar architectural charac­teristics and orthogonal, planned, layouts (Isbell and McEwan 1991; Isbell and Schreiber 1978), while in the case ofTiwanaku the sites are associ­ated with public works (raised fields) and have blocks of worked stone (Bauer and Stanish 2001 :38-42; Kolata 1986, 1993). Inferring the pres­ence of a unified, state-level, imperial administra­tion (i.e., bureaucracy) from site size hierarchies and the presence of worked stones is obviously an indirect approach, which assumes that all sites are indeed part of the same system and functionally homogenous; it does not address the more direct question of how information was recorded, processed, and transmitted. 
My approach focuses on information flow. I show that the U-shaped structures at Chan Chan were used to record and process information, in a manner analogous to the quipu, and that the spa­tial organization of these architectural elements reflects the process of transmission of information from one functionary to another. 
Description of Chan Chan 
Chan Chan, capital of the Chimu Kingdom, was a large city that was founded on the north coast of Peru about A.D. 850 and flourished from about 

A.D. 1200 to A.D. 1470, when it was conquered by the expanding Inka empire (Figure 2). The Chimu kingdom incorporated a number of ethnic groups, under their ethnic lords, in a strip of terri­tory along the coast almost 1,000 km long, from near what is now the Ecuadorian border in the north to near Lima in the south. The city consisted essen-

tially of the court of the Chimu kings (e.g., Kolata 1983 ). There are 10 named compounds, called ciu­dndelas, which are often interpreted as palaces con­structed sequentially by the Chimu kings (Day 1982; Klymyshyn 1987:99, 105; Kolata 1990; Moseley 1975a; Moseley and Mackey 1974). Sur­rounding the ciudadelas are other compounds referred to as Elite Architecture; these compounds are less monumental than the ciudadelas and have been interpreted as residences of the lower nobil­ity and extensions of the administrative apparatus into the residential barrios (Klymyshyn 1982). The residential barrios, also referred to as SIAR or small irregularly agglutinated rooms, were occu­pied by families of artisans specia_lizing in metal working and textile production, but also working stone, wood, and shell (J. Topic 1982, 1990). 
U-shaped structures occur throughout the city, as well as at Chimu rural sites and provincial cen­ters. They generally have only three walls so that a plan of a structure looks like the block letter "U" (Figure 3 ). They usually have floors that are slightly

elevated above the surrounding court and thick walls with niches or other cavities. Three basic types of U-shaped structures have been defined (arcones have bins, trocaderos have troughs, and audiencias have niches), along with variants of each type based on the number and location of bins, troughs, and niches, and the overall shape of the structure. Trocaderos have a very restricted spatial and temporal distribution, and they will be treated here as a variant of the audiencia. The distributions of audiencias and arcones overlap temporally, but are spatially rather distinct: arcones occur in the residential barrios, but not in the ciudadelas; audi­encias occur in the ciudadelas, but not in the resi­dential barrios; both types of structures occur in the Intermediate or Elite Architecture (Klymyshyn 1982; Kolata 1978; Topic 1977, 1990). In terms of the heuristic dichotomy employed here, arcones were probably always associated with stewards, 
while the audiencias became associated with bureaucrats. 
The Function of the U-shaped Structures 
Almost ail archaeologists who have discussed the function of the U-shaped structures have charac­terized them as "administrative" in nature. This characterization was originally based on the appar­ent association of U-shaped structures with stor­age areas in the ciudadelas, and the structures were interpreted as controlling access to the storage areas (Day 1982; Kolata 1990:124). By graphing the access routes within one ciudadela, Moore (1992) was able to show that the U-shaped structures in Ciudadela Rivero did not physically or visually control access to storage. While he noted (Moore 1992:108) that U-shaped structures are closely associated with storerooms in some ciudadelas, but not in others, he rejected the association for Chan Chan as a whole and questioned the admin­istrative function of the U-shaped structures. 
While I completely agree with Moore that the interpretation of U-shaped structures as "control structures" is imprecise, I still think that they are best interpreted as administrative in nature. This paper is an attempt to more precisely describe the changing nature of administration at Chan Chan (and the role played by U-shaped structures), from a concern with commodity flow to an emphasis on information flow. In this view, U-shaped structures represent an evolving administrative technology analogous to the quipu. While quipu predate the Chimu, as noted earlier, the Middle Horizon quipu are known at present only from the South Coast of Peni (Conklin 1982; Pereyra 1997), an area not brought under the control of Chan Chan. There is no evidence that the quipu was used by the Chimu government at its capital at Chan Chan or in any provincial or rural centers. I argue, however, that the U-shaped structures functioned in an analogous manner. 
In interpreting U-shaped structures as adminis­trative structures, the only assumption we have to make is that the niches, bins, and troughs had the same sort of predefined place value that we see in other Andean record-keeping devices, such as the strings of the quipu or the cells of the abacus; sim­ilarly, then, beans, pebbles, or other markers could be placed in the niches or bins in order to record quantitative information. If the niches represented a category, putting markers into them recorded the value of that category. The markers put into the niches could have been the actual commodities being counted (in the manner in which potatoes are counted today), but they could also have been mark­ers that represented commodities. One niche, for example, might represent the amount of maize in a storage area; another might represent the number of sets of clothing that a group of weavers was required to deliver. Niches might have been subdi­vided by putting the counters into pots or bags within them: thus a niche could represent maize, with one bag representing maize to be delivered to storage, another representing maize currently stored, and a third representing maize required for consumption in the immediate future. In my inter­pretation, then, the U-shaped structures are not so much control structures as accounting structures, and they might keep account of items that were not in storage as well as items that were in storage. 
If the U-shaped structures functioned in a man­ner analogous to the quipu and abacus, they could either have been used by officials who were in close contact with the commodities in storage (i.e., offi­cials who were like stewards) or by officials who were removed from but still controlled information about the commodities (i.e., bureaucrats). The spa­tial contexts in which we find the U-shaped struc­tures allows us to archaeologically distinguish these

two different kinds of administrators. I show that close examination of the contexts in which the U­shaped structures occur documents the transition, through time, from an administrative model con­sistent with stewardship to a model consistent with bureaucracy. In other words, at Chan Chan we have the first demonstrable case of the evolution of infor­mation control from a preceding system of com­modity control in the Andean world. 
The Evidence for the Development of Bureaucracy 
I present four independent lines of argument that show how bureaucracy developed from steward­ship. The context in which U-shaped structures occur will be shown to shift from positions in which they could control commodity flow to positions in which they can only be interpreted as controlling information flow. Also, the form of the U-shaped structures reflects, through time, an increasingly standardized record-keeping system and an increas­ingly hierarchical relationship among the record keepers. These changes culminate, in the final phase of occupation at Chan Chan, in a rationalized sys­tem of information flow that is distinctly different from what is recognizable in the earliest phase. 
I. Jn the Transition from Stewardship to Bureau­cracy We Should See Increasing Standardization of the Form of the U-shaped Structures through Time. 
Individual shepherds can record information about their herds in nonstandardized ways. However, in order for records to be understood by a number of officials, the markers and place values used in Andean accounting systems had to be standardized. If the niches, bins, and troughs in the U-shaped structures at Chan Chan were places with prede­fined values, then the form of the building must have been standardized in order for different peo­ple to understand the value of each place. 
Several sequences have been proposed for the U-shaped structures at Chan Chan (including Andrews 1974; Kolata 1982; Topic and Moseley 1985). Andrews proposed the first sequence; it was later modified by Kolata, who drew on information not available to Andrews, especially a seriation of the adobe bricks used in the U-shaped structures andciudadelas. Topic and Moseley (1985), in tum, relied on Kolata, as well as ceramic information from ciudadelas, areas adjacent to the ciudadelas, and rural U-shaped structures. There are only two major differences between the Kolata sequence and the Topic and Moseley sequence. First, Topic and Moseley recognize a U-shaped structure precursor, the tab/ado (Figure 3a), in their sequence that is also present at the Moche V site of Galindo (Baw­den 1982); second, Topic and Moseley consider the combination of a standard audiencia and a variant, the auxilio, in a single court (Figure 3o) to be chronologically distinct from the simple occur­rence of a standard audiencia. These differences affect only the very earliest and very latest ends of the sequence. 
The ciudadelas also have been seriated. One attribute used in the ciudadela seriations is the form of the U-shaped structures in each. Other attributes include the shape of the adobe bricks, the form of the burial platform, overall configuration of the ciu­dadela, and, at times, ceramic associations. All researchers who have examined the monumental architecture at Chan Chan in detail agree that there were discrete constructional episodes. These episodes consisted of the construction either of sec­tors of ciudadelas (early in the site's history) or complete ciudadelas (late in the site's history). After a period of use, generally viewed as a gen­eration or the rule of a single king, the sector or ciudadela was abandoned and curated. 
The two most widely cited ciudadela seriations (Kolata 1982; Topic and Moseley 1985) are com­pared in Table 1. In a more recent publication, Kolata (1990: 122) recognizes up to four phases in one ciudadela, Uhle, and at least two in another, Tello. Joanne Pillsbury (1993:71 ), based on her study of the adobe friezes in the ciudadelas, finds that the relief sculptures confirm the general chronological outline of the Topic and Moseley sequence and, to a lesser extent, the general out­line of the Kolata sequence. 
Using these sequences we can demonstrate that through time U-shaped structures do, in fact, become more standardized. Early ci_ud
adelas (dat­ing from approximately A.D. 850 to 1100) are char­acterized by variation: tab/ados in courts lined with storerooms occur in the south sector of Tello (Fig­ure 3a); there are elongated U-shaped structures, as well as C-shaped structures; and the structures have a mixture of bins, troughs, and niches in the walls. There is a reduction in variation in the mid-

dle phase (approximately A.D. 1100 to 1350): the structures take on a squarish shape, but there is still a mixture of bins, troughs, and niches. In the final ciudadela of this phase, Gran Chimu, there is only a single style of U-shaped structure (Figure 31). The late phase is characterized by a high degree of standardization. In Velarde, a four-niched structure occurs (Figure 3m), but in Bandelier, Rivero and Tschudi we only find the standard six-niched audi­encia (Figure 3n). In Tschudi, however, the stan­dard audiencia is sometimes accompanied by an un-niched structure called the auxilio (Figure 3o). 
The increasing standardization of the U-shaped structures is also evident in Kolata's sequence and was, in fact, noted by him (Kolata 1982:84) as an indication of an "increasingly rigid and bureau­cratic organization." Probably because he sub­scribed to the "control structure" interpretation of U-shaped structures (Kolata 1982:72, 85), how­ever, no particular significance was ascribed to this increasing standardization in terms of the devel­opment of administrative technology. Topic and Moseley ( 1985: 164, 165), on the other hand, related the standardization of U-shaped structure form explicitly to standardization of accounting prac­tices; they did not, however, develop the explicit analogy to the quipu that is employed in this paper. 
If the U-shaped structures were primarily designed to control access routes, the increasing standardization could be viewed simply as stylis­tic change. It might suggest an increasingly rigid set of rules and procedures within the bureaucracy, but only in the same sense that a dress code or rules about the color of filing cabinets reflect "bureau­cratic" rigidity. This is "bureaucracy" in the popu­lar, usually negative, connotation of "red-tape." When they are viewed as accounting structures, however, the standardization of the number and placement of niches takes on quite a different sig­nificance, a significance more analogous to having all computers within a workplace use the same operating system; this is the kind of rationalization characteristic of bureaucratic administration in the Weberian sense. 
The long-term trend toward the reduction in number of niches may indicate a specialization of functions; perhaps, over time, each U-shaped struc­ture became responsible for fewer commodities, fewer storerooms, or a particular group of people. The standardization in the arrangement of niches suggests a codification of place value concepts, like the codification of string colors, sequence, and knot placement in the quipu. 
2. In the Transition from Stewardship to Bureau­cracy We Should See Increasing Separation between the U-shaped Structures and Storer;ooms through Time. In the dichotomy between stewards and bureaucrats used here, stewards control goods

while bureaucrats control information about the goods. Stewards, then, should be closely associated with the actual storerooms while bureaucrats can be more spatially independent. As noted earlier, Moore (1992:106-108) has shown that the U­shaped structures in Rivero do not physically con­trol access to the storerooms nor do they command, visually, the routes leading to storage areas. Since Rivero is one of the latest ciudadelas, his analysis in this instance agrees with my own. However, he also uses a tabulation of the number of U-shaped structures that occur with and without storerooms and the number of storerooms that occur with and without U-shaped structures to extrapolate, that for Chan Chan as a whole, there is no significant spa­tial association between U-shaped structures and storage. 
We can use the seriation of monumental archi­tecture to examine the changing spatial relationship between U-shaped structures and storage areas over time in more detail. Only six of the monumental enclosures are well enough preserved to be useful here: Tello, Uhle, Laberinto, Bandelier, Rivero, and Tschudi. The others have large sections destroyed by colonial and modem roads (Gran Chimu and Velarde) or by agricultural activities (Chayhuac), were buried or destroyed in antiquity by urban renewal within the site (Enclosures 1 and 2), or were never finished (Squier). As Table 1 indicates, the six relatively well-preserved enclosures have as many as 11 chronological components within them and span most of the history of the site. The earlier enclosures typically have more than one chrono­logical component, while the Late enclosures were probably built in a single construction phase. 
While I will describe each of the chronological components in order, using the Topic and Moseley (1985) sequence, the analysis will be based partly on groupings of these components into Early, Mid­dle, and Late periods. This structure allows both the examination of detailed change and analysis of more general trends. Because there are slight dif­ferences in the Kolata (1982, 1990) and Topic and Moseley (1985) sequences, as well as evidence for major renovations in some of the ciudadelas (Pills­bury 1993: 166ff), the detailed changes may be sub­ject to debate but the general trends should be trustworthy. 
The architectural patterning at Chan Chan is complex and the discussion that follows is com­plicated. The diagrams used to illustrate this sec­tion are intended to reduce the complexity of the architecture, while still preserving contextual infor­mation (Figures 5-10). For example, the plan of Tello (Figure 4) shows three clear sectors: the north, northeast, and south sectors. The three sectors are defined in the diagram (Figure 5) by shading. Within each sector in Figure 5 are a number of rec­tangles that represent courts. Some rectangles/ courts are entry courts with ramps; the ramps are designated by V-shaped arrows pointing to the top of the ramp. Some courts have U-shaped structures within them, and the U-shaped structures are des­ignated by a block letter U within the rectangle. Sometimes the courts with U-shaped structures also contain storerooms, and in these cases the number of storerooms in a court is indicated. In the case of a storage court without a U-shaped struc­ture, the number of storerooms stands alone. Cir­cles represent water wells. Particularly elaborate courts whose walls are ornamented with niches are indicated by lines drawn parallel to the rectan­gle/court walls. 
Access from one court to another is indicated by lines connecting the rectangles. The approxi­mate point at which an access route enters a court is indicated by the point at which the line intersects the rectangle. In the case of poorly preserved courts or unclear access routes, dashed lines are used. 
Early Period. The south sector of Tello is char­acterized by tab/ados (indicated by a court with a "T" inside), although there is also one audiencia variant in the northwest part of the south sector (Fig­ures 4 and 5). The tab/ados occur in courtyards lined with bins, apparently for storage, on the two lateral walls. The largest court has 34 bins and a tablado, with three walls, set on a bench at the south end of the court. The other two tab/ados are low rectangular platforms set near the southern ends of courts with lateral bins and benches. There are also 14 storage areas that lack tab/ados or audiencia variants. Access patterns are not very clear, but according to the maps most of these areas would have been accessible without passing directly by either the tablados or the audiencia variant. Still, the tablado courts are physically close to the storage areas and, significantly, have what appear to be storage bins in their lateral walls.

Ciudadela Uhle (Figure 6) is interpreted as rep­resenting either three (Topic and Mosely 1985) or four (Kolata 1990: 122) construction stages. In either case, the earliest construction stages are in the northeast part of the enclosure, labeled in Fig­ure 6 as north central and northeast. Kolata (1978: 110-113) includes an important update to the Chan Chan maps (Moseley and Mackey 197 4) for this northeast area of Uhle.

Both the northeast and the north central sectors of Uhle are characterized by courts in which walls were decorated with niches. These niched courts are somewhat reminiscent of the bin-lined courts in the southern sector of Tello (Figure 5), but the niches and the bins may have served different func­tional purposes. Two of the six niched courts have U-shaped structures within them and three other niched courts can only be reached by passing through a court with three U-shaped structures; if the niches served a storage function, there would be a very close spatial connection between storage areas and U-shaped structures. If the niched courts were not storage areas, then there was no storage space in the northeast sector and only a minor amount in the north central sector. In the latter case, there is a close spatial association between U­shaped structures and storerooms, though it is pos­sible to gain access to some storerooms without passing by a U-shaped structure. As in Tello, the access patterns in the northeast area ofUhle are not clearly defined on the Chan Chan maps, and it is

not possible to argue for physical control of the storerooms by the U-shaped structures in all cases, though there is proximity between U-shaped struc­tures and storerooms. 
The north sector of the Tello enclosure has four well-defined storage courts, but the access into these courts is not clear. They are located just south of a large courtyard, with a ramp leading to a raised bench along its south wall, and a C-shaped audien­cia variant is in the middle of the bench. The stor­age areas are just behind this U-shaped structure and it might well have controlled access physically and visually to the storage areas. 
The southwest sector of Uhle (Figure 6) has per­haps the closest association of U-shaped structures and storerooms at Chan Chan. There is a central court with storerooms along the lateral walls and a group of three U-shaped structures on a raised bench at its southern end. This is an arrangement similar to a niched court leading to three U-shaped struc­tures in the northeast sector of Uhle. In the south­west sector ofUhle, these three U-shaped structures control access into a storage area with 16 store­rooms. Flanking the central court/storeroom com­plex are four other storage courts, each with a central U-shaped structure. There are also five isolated storerooms located north of the central court. 
In these early cases, U-shaped structures (and tablados) are often located in large courts, with storerooms, bins, or niches along the lateral walls. U-shaped structures are often placed near the south end of the court, or on a raised bench at the south end of the court. In two cases, both in Uhle, a com­plex of three U-shaped structures is located on a bench at the south end of a court. It cannot be shown in all cases that U-shaped structures control visual or physical access to storerooms; however, this is partly due to poor preservation. The positioning of the U-shaped structures in large courts means that they are often located along major access routes. Moreover, U-shaped structures are close to many storage areas; they tend to be dispersed throughout the sector rather than closely concentrated in a par­ticular area within it.

Figure 7. Diagram of the relationship between storage and U-shaped structures in Laberinto. The shading indicates three sectors; the central sector was probably in use before the north and east sectors. The north and east sectors may have been in use contemporaneously. 
Middle Period. The central sector of Laberinto continues some of these trends (Figure 7). The main access route leads through a large niched court, up a ramp, and onto a raised bench that is also deco­rated with niches. U-shaped structures occur in courts with storerooms and seem to control access to most of the larger storage courts: on the west, a court with two U-shaped structures appears to con­trol access to a storage area with a niched wall and 25 storerooms; in the central area, an audiencia court controls access to a storage area containing 13 storerooms; and on the east, an audiencia court is closely associated with the route leading to a storage area with 36 storerooms and possibly to routes leading to four other storage courts with 28, 29, 31, and 34 storerooms. 
The northeast sector of Tello (Figures 4 and 5) is different in some ways from the central sector of Laberinto. A niched court occurs, but it is not central to the access system; it is approached through another court that has a U-shaped struc­ture. The niched court also contains six storerooms. 
Another U-shaped structure occurs in a court with 18 storerooms, but two U-shaped structures occur in another court that seems not to be associated with storage at all. The overwhelming majority of storerooms do not seem to be either visually or physically controlled by U-shaped structures, although access patterns are often not completely clear. 
The northwest sector of Uhle continues the trend of de-emphasizing the niched court as a for­mal entrance (Figure 6). A small court with either niches or bins is located in the extreme north­western part of the sector. It also contains a U­shaped structure, but it and its U-shaped structure are located at the terminus of access route in an isolated, or private, context. There are only five storerooms, located in an audiencia court in the center of the sector, that can be directly associated with a U-shaped structure. This same U-shaped structure is associated with an access route lead­ing to all the storage courts, but they can also be approached by another route that bypasses the U-

shaped structure. In the eastern part of the sector, there are again three storerooms located in a court adjacent to a U-shaped structure and accessible from its court, but these can also be reached by bypassing the U-shaped structure. In contrast, there are also four U-shaped structures in the north­eastern part of the sector that are grouped together in a tight cluster, but are apparently isolated from access to storage areas; these U-shaped structures are small, elongated, two-niche affairs. Finally, there are two possible U-shaped structures in the northwest area of the sector that may form another clustered grouping along with the niched court and the central U-shaped structure. 
The north and east sectors of Laberinto may form a single chronological unit, since the east sec­tor is accessible from the north sector but appar­ently isolated from the central sector (Figure 7). A niched court occurs in the north sector, but it is not the primary entrance court. Instead, it serves as the entrance court for a U-shaped structure with five associated storerooms at the terminus of an access route. To the west of the niched court there is a com­plex of three clustered U-shaped structures. One of these has 10 associated storerooms, but the cluster of U-shaped structures does not physically or visu­ally control access to three nearby storage courts. Another U-shaped structure is located in the south­east part of the north sector and has 12 storerooms associated directly. The access to this U-shaped structure is not clear; it might visually control access to a 20-room storage court and to the east sector, but it is not in a position to control direct access to the five other storage courts in the north sector. The east sector has four U-shaped struc­tures, all clustered within a small area. Two of these U-shaped structures occupy a single court approached through an entry court that is not niched. Another is also approached through an entry court without niches; this U-shaped structure has eight storerooms associated. The fourth U-shaped structure has two storerooms associated. Again, the

cluster of U-shaped structures here does not seem to control access to the extensive storage complexes either visually or physically. 
During the Middle period, the niched court changed from being the main entry court for a whole sector to being an entry court for a single U­shaped structure. The niched court and associated U-shaped structure also became more isolated. The other U-shaped structures became less closely asso­ciated with storage: there were both fewer store­rooms in the audiencia courts and the U-shaped structures were less capable of controlling access to storage areas either physically or visually. The U-shaped structures also tended to become clus­tered, rather than dispersed as they were during the Early period. The latest phase in Laberinto has two sectors, the north and east sectors, that may be con­temporary and are linked such that the east sector can only be entered through the north sector. 
wte Period. The three late enclosures that are well enough preserved to be considered here were each built and occupied as a single unit. Bandelier, Rivero, and Tschudi share many characteristics and can be discussed together. For example, niched courts are common and often associated with U­shaped structures (Figures 8, 9, and 10). There are still some storerooms located within the audiencia courts in Bandelier and Tschudi, but these account for a very small proportion of the . storage space. The bulk of the storage is in separate courts, which are not controlled either visually or physically by the U-shaped structures. Indeed the U-shaped struc­tures tend to be clustered together and interlinked such that access leads from one audiencia court into another. This clustering is especially prevalent in the northern sectors of these three enclosures,

implying much more interaction among the occu­
pants of the U-shaped structures during the Late 
period than during the earlier periods. 
Moore's (1992:108) analysis agrees with mine 
on some points, but not on others. His general con­
clusion is that for Chan Chan as a whole, there is 
no association between storage and U-shaped struc­
tures; this conclusion is not necessarily in dis­
. agreement with my analysis, but it is necessary to compare the two analyses in more detail in order to see where our perspectives, and our characteri­zations of the data, diverge. He argues for three cat­egories of relationships between the storage areas and the U-shaped structures: (1) ciudadelas where the majority of U-shaped structures are associated with storage; (2) ciudadelas where there is no rela­tionship between U-shaped structures and store­rooms; and (3) a single situation in which there is a definite relationship between storerooms and U-shaped structures. His tabulation of the data (1992: Table 2) is aggregated and difficult to compare with the more contextualized analysis presented and illustrated here, but it is clear that he consistently recognizes fewer U-shaped structures than I do. 
In the first group he included Laberinto, Gran Chimu, and Bandelier. The inclusion of Laberinto and Gran Chimu in this category is not entirely incon­sistent with my analysis, since they are Middle period enclosures; we would expect to still see some asso­ciation between storage and administrative struc­tures in the Middle period. The inclusion of Bandelier in this group, though, is inconsistent with my inter­pretation. While I recognize one more U-shaped structure in Laberinto than Moore, this difference does not affect the analysis. I also recognize two more U-shaped structures in Bandelier than Moore, but again this does not make a major difference in the analysis. What is clear in Bandelier, however, is

The difference between our analyses seems to be that he recognizes only three U-shaped structures in Tello; these are prob­ably the three structures in the northeast sector, which are quite clear on the Chan Chan maps (Moseley and Mackey 1974:Map 13,Figure4), but they are also the structures least associated with storage. I recognize one C-shaped audiencia vari­ant in the north sector and three tablados in the south sector that are in close proximity to storage areas. The other differences are very minor; I have included the three U-shaped structures in the east annex of Rivero in my analysis and have counted both audiencias and auxilios in Tschudi. 
The one case where Moore finds a definite rela­tionship between storerooms and U-shaped struc­tures is in Uhle, and this fits well with my analysis. He recognizes only 22 U-shaped structures, while Irecognize 26. The difference is probably due to the fact that the elongated structures in the north central sector are not recorded on the Chan Chan maps (Moseley and Mackey 1974) but are dis­cussed in Kolata's (1978) dissertation. 
In summary, there was a change over time in the spatial relationship between U-shaped structures and storage. In the earliest sectors, U-shaped struc­tures are often associated with large courtyards that had storerooms, bins, or niches in the lateral walls. Although access is often unclear, the courts seem to be located along the major access routes. The U­shaped structures are dispersed through a sector and interspersed with storage areas. In the late enclo­sures, the niched courts are isolated from the major access routes and often occur near the ends of routes. U-shaped structures are still associated with the niched courts and occur in clusters rather than dispersed through a sector. The U-shaped struc­tures within a cluster intercommunicate more with each other than with storage areas. 
3. In the Transition from Stewardship to Bureau­cracy There Should Be Increasingly Hierarchical Relationships among U-shaped Structures. As bureaucracy develops, some officials become sub­ordinated to others. The hierarchical relationship among U-shaped structures might take a number of different spatial patterns, three of which will be considered. One, which might be called the gate­keeper pattern (Figure 11), is characterized by a 
dendritic access pattern where one or a few U­shaped structures act as gatekeepers that direct peo­ple and goods into the deeper levels of the system. A modem analogy would be the location of a mul­tiplex theatre ticket taker, who directs the ticket holders to the proper viewing room; as they arrive at the viewing room, ushers may further direct them

to specific seats. The gatekeeper pattern is related to the concept of stewardship because in both cases there is close contact with the people or goods being controlled or directed. 
A second and contrasting pattern places the top of the hierarchy in an isolated or protected position (Moseley 1975a: 222) called the CEO pattern (Fig­ure 11 ), because a useful analogy is the president of an organization who is isolated and protected from the day-to-day operating details by vice-pres­idents, administrative assistants, and secretaries who filter access. The CEO pattern is, of course, related to the concept of bureaucracy. 
A third pattern that reflects hierarchy can be called the cubicle pattern (Figure 11). Although the "cubicles" themselves are not arranged in a hier­archical manner, the presence of a mass of undif­ferentiated positions is a correlate of either the gatekeeper (think "ushers") or CEO (think "typing pool") patterns of hierarchy. The cubicle pattern can be present in a situation of either stewardship or bureaucracy; in a situation of stewardship the "cubi­cles" will be closely associated with goods, while in a situation of bureaucracy the "cubicles" will not be closely associated with goods and storage areas. 
The early sectors in Tello and Uhle show little evidence of a hierarchy of U-shaped structures, due in part to the small number of U-shaped structures in these sectors. For example, in the south sector of Tello there are four U-shaped structures in a more-or-less linear pattern, but none seem to act as a gatekeeper, although the access pattern is not completely clear (Figures 4 and 5). The general lay­out of the early sectors in these two enclosures is more suggestive of a gatekeeper than a CEO pat­tern, however. In each sector there is a large court with niches, bins, or storerooms in the lateral walls and a U-shaped structure or a group of three U­shaped structures at the south end that could act as a gatekeeper. The pattern is perhaps clearest in the southwest sector of Uhle (Figure 6). On the other hand, there is a U-shaped structure in a niched court in the northeast sector of Uhle that could represent the CEO pattern, but there is only one" gatekeeper" group of U-shaped structures serving as a filter for the court. The south sector of Tello could be viewed as an incipient form of the cubicle pattern, but the north central and southwest sectors of Uhle would be better examples of an early cubicle pattern. In all cases the "cubicles" are closely associated with storage. 
In the central sector of Laberinto there is a pos­sible gatekeeper U-shaped structure just south of the large niched entry court (Figure 7). In the north­east sector of Tello, however, there is little evidence for hierarchy (Figures 4 and 5). Both the northwest sector of Uhle (Figure 6) and the north sector of Laberinto (Figure 7) have U-shaped structures in an isolated position associated with a niched court at the terminus of an access route; there is also a U-shaped structure associated with an unniched court in the east sector of Laberinto. These may be evidence of a developing CEO pattern, but access to these isolated U-shaped structures is not actu­ally filtered through other U-shaped structures except, possibly, in the case of the east sector of Laberinto. Because it is only possible to enter the eastern sector ofLaberinto by passing through sev­eral courts in the north sector and since the form of the U-shaped structures is similar in both sec­tors, these two sectors probably functioned con­temporaneously. The limited number of U-shaped structures, and the lack of clarity as to whether there is a gatekeeper pattern, the beginning of a poorly defined cubicle pattern, or an incipient CEO pattern, is probably best interpreted as what might be expected in a transitional period. There seems to be a greater association of U-shaped structures with storage at the beginning of the period than there is at the end. 
The Late period enclosures become clearly hier­archical (Figures 12, 13, and 14). There is always a U-shaped structure in a niched court in the cen­tral sector located at the end of an access pattern filtered past other U-shaped structures. These are good examples of arrangements attributable to high-ranking officials in a CEO pattern. There are also other U-shaped structures associated with niched courts and at the terminus of access routes in these enclosures that might represent middle­ranking officials; there is one in Bandelier's east sector, three in Rivero's north sector, and two sets of paired U-shaped structures in niched courts in the central sector ofTschudi. Cubicle-like arrange­ments are common in the north sectors of these enclosures and are especially well developed in Rivero and Tschudi. As noted previously, these are not closely associated with storage. Interestingly,

there are also U-shaped structures in Bandelier, and U-shaped structures on the east side of the Rivero, and Tschudi that could function as gate­north sector. In Tschudi, two gatekeepers in com­keepers. In Bandelier and Rivero, these gatekeeper bination control one of the access routes into the U-shaped structures control one of the access routes central sector and two of the three routes into the into the central sector and, in Rivero, the gatekeeper "cubicles." Finally, in Tschudi, two types of U­also controls access into a complex of storerooms shaped structures are found within a single court

(Figure 3o). These are called audiencias and aux­ilios. The auxilios, being smaller and lacking niches, intuitively appear to be the kind of struc­ture where an aide to the occupant of the U-shaped structure would work. 
4. With the Development of Bureaucracy We Should See a Rationalization of Information Flow. 
One characteristic of bureaucracy is that it func­tions by following well-regulated procedures employed by officials with fixed areas of jurisdic­tion. These procedures lead to the efficient gather­ing, processing, and storage of information. As previously discussed, part of the rationalization of information flow is the standardization of the U­shaped structures, and another part is the develop­ment of a hierarchy of officials. However, rationalization can go beyond these aspects to affect the organization of officials in more complex ways. Part of the evidence for this more complex organi­zation is the presence in the Late period enclosures of all three patterns of hierarchy: the gatekeeper, CEO, and cubicle arrangements. 
The earliest sectors have few U-shaped struc­tures, so it is not surprising that they are organized 
in rather simple ways. Even in the northwest sec­tor of Uhle (Figure 6) and the north and east sec­tors ofLaberinto (Figure 7), there is little evidence for an elaborate organization. As already men­tioned, there is some evidence for a developing CEO pattern of hierarchy in these areas. Moreover, if the north and east sectors ofLaberinto functioned contemporaneously, as seems likely given the access pattern, a new level of organization was introduced: the north sector is more accessible from the outside than the east sector, has more U-shaped structures, and has less storage space. The need for a dual level of organization in Laberinto may be related to the increasing number ofU-shaped struc­tures, which in turn may relate to increasing amounts of storage. Klymyshyn (1987: 105, 107), in fact, regards Laberinto and Tello as storage com­plexes rather than palaces and notes the large amount of storage space in Laberinto. 
The Late period enclosures continue the pattern of a north sector with a large number of U-shaped structures and proportionately less storage. In addi­tion to the north and central sectors, a third sector was added on the east and was accessible without having to pass through either the north or central sectors. This eastern area is not very well differen­tiated but is recognizable in Bandelier; it is an annex in Rivero; and is built into the L-shaped Tschudi (Figures 12-14). 
The number of U-shaped structures in these three sectors of Bandelier, Rivero, and Tschudi is indicated in Table 2. The increasing numbers ofU­shaped structures in the northern sectors is strik­ing. I have related this change to the Late period growth in the urban population, which largely con­sisted of artisans supported by the state from the . state stores (Topic and Moseley 1985). The need to provision the artisan population with raw mate­rials, tools, and food supplies led to higher rates of turnover of goods in the Late period ciudadelas. The increased turnover resulted in a restructuring of the ciudadelas so that the north sector was devoted to short-term storage while the central sec­tor was devoted to longer-term storage. It is not clear how the eastern area functioned. On the one hand, it could be reached directly from the entrance to the enclosure and might be expected to have had high turnover. On the other hand, there was little storage space, except in Tschudi. 
The higher rate of commodity turnover in the north sector produced a greater information flow requiring more concentrated bureaucratic admin­istration. It is in the north sector, and especially in Rivero and Tshudi, where the greatest interlinking of the cubicle groups, gatekeepers, and CEO struc­tures can be discerned (Figures 13 and 14). Quite commonly, some U-shaped structures could only be reached by passing through a court containing another U-shaped structure. It is notable that this was normally not the case in the central sector or eastern areas, although there is one example of interlinkage in the central sector of Bandelier and another in the east annex of Rivero. The interlink­age of U-shaped structures in these Late period enclosures, and their separation from storerooms, indicates that interactions between the occupants of the structures had become more important than the direct control of stored goods. The complex hierarchical relationships among the U-shaped structures indicates that some officials were super­vising other officials and that there were high rates of interaction among officials where they could exchange information. All this is compatible with a bureaucratic form of administration.7

Discussion 
Methodologically, I have shown how archaeolo­gists can reconstruct information flow and the development of bureaucracy in a preliterate civi­lization. Deducing this kind of abstract structure from material remains is inherently interesting, but dependson the availability of an excellent database, approached in a systematic and sophisticated man­ner. Rather than poorly specified appeals to admin­istration or control, it is important to be precise about the nature of the administration. Close atten­tion to context, both chronological and spatial, is also fundamental. 
I have contrasted two types of administration, stewardship and bureaucracy, in order to analyze the changing nature of administration at Chan Chan. I started with a description of historically known methods of record keeping in the Andes. While I admit that the essential analogy of the U­shaped structure to the quipu and other Andean methods of record keeping cannot be confirmed directly, the four lines of argument presented above strongly suggest that a transition from stewardship to bureaucracy did in fact take place at Chan Chan. 
The four arguments for the development of bureaucracy are independent of each other. Stan­dardization of form does not require a hierarchical organization of U-shaped structures, nor does a close association of U-shaped structures with stor­age areas require greater variation in the form of U-shaped structures. However, set in the context of a change in the nature of administration from stew­ardship to bureaucracy, the conclusions from each of the four arguments are congruent and mutually supportive. The coherence of the overall interpre­tation is compelling (Collingwood 1994:246). 
Implications 
The interpretation of U-shaped structures as a record-keeping technology extends our under­standing of Andean cognition. It exemplifies how the principles used in the fiber quipu and the yupana, an abacus which could be drawn on the ground, could be applied to a third medium, archi­tecture. These principles include the value of place, the use of attributes to record numbers and con­textual information, and the importance of ranked categories. 
Although we know that quipu date to the Mid­dle Horizon, the time of the Huari and Tiwanaku cultures, there is no evidence that these cultures used the quipu in a systematic way for administra­tion, partly due to poor preservation in the high­lands, the core area of these cultures. Our evidence for the lnka use of the quipu comes largely from historic sources, as well from the dry desert coast. Moreover, as pointed out earlier, the Middle Hori­zon quipu are not as standardized as the Inka exam­ples and, like modem quipu, might have been either personal records or the records of small-scale insti­tutions. Large-scale storage has not been demon­strated for Huari or Tiwanaku, but did form an essential element of the Chimu and Inka political economies. The lack of evidence for storage and record keeping in Huari and Tiwanaku means that we cannot analyze either the flow of commodities or the flow of information in the same detail. One purpose of this paper is to stimulate more thought about how different cultures in the Andes handled the administration of political economy. Detailed understanding of administrative techniques and record-keeping technology helps us to understand other aspects of a political system. While Andeanists commonly, and usefully, employ analo­gies of Inka political organization with earlier cul­tures, we must be aware of the differences between the Inka and earlier polities. 

I employ an analogy with the Inka quipu and yupana for U-shaped structures at Chan Chan, but there is also an interesting difference in the porta­bility of Inka and Chimu record-keeping technol­ogy: while the quipu and yupana could be easily transported by chasqui postal couriers or other offi­cials, the U-shaped structures were stationary. While the occupants of the U-shaped structures did not necessarily control physical access to goods or the movement of people, they were tied spatially to what they were administering, whether com­modities stored at Chan Chan in a context of stew-

ardship or the information stored within the struc­ture of the architecture in the context of bureau­cracy. The portability of the record-keeping technology employed by the early Andean civi­lizations, and hence the mobility of administrators, may well have had an impact on both their politi­cal economies and their strategies of expansion. 
The lack of mobility of Chimu administrators may be correlated with the concentration of stor­age at Chan Chan. Several years ago, I (J. Topic 1990: 170-171) noted that there were very few Chimu storerooms outside of Chan Chan and that this contrasted with the pattern oflnka storage. The Inka had immense storage complexes in the provinces, for example at Jauja in Peru and Cotopachi in Bolivia (e.g., LeVine 1992). More­over, even a small Inka provincial center, such as Huamachuco, had a storage capacity equivalent to or greater than one of the Late period ciudadelas (i.e.,Bandelier, Tschudi, or Rivero) at Chan Chan. The Inka spread their storage capacity throughout the empire and were able to transmit accounts back to Cusco with ease. 
One can question whether this is just a matter of scale, the Inka empire being so much larger than the area controlled by Chan Chan, or whether it rep­resents a significant difference in the political economies of the two states. I (J. Topic 1990) have argued that the focus of the Chan Chan economy was craft production and that the development of its specific storage and administrative pattern was intended to support that economy. Indeed, the development of bureaucracy at Chan Chan hap­pens at the same time that we start to see the eco­nomic focus shift from agricultural expansion to craft production. While there were important Chimu provincial centers such as Manchan, Far­fan, and Tucume with high-ranking lords and, often, some evidence for craft production, the amount of storage space was small, as was the num­ber ofU-shaped structures (see especially Mackey and Klymyshyn 1990; also Heyerdahl et al. 1996; Keatinge and Conrad 1983; Mackey 1987). More­over, the U-shaped structures were not the stan­dardized kinds in the Late period at Chan Chan (indeed, there are no known U-shaped structures with niches north of the Jequetepeque valley [Hey­erdahl et al. I 996:92]) and they were not arranged in any of the hierarchical patterns discussed ear­
lier. The Chimu concentrated both storage and administrators at a single site, Chan Chan. 

The Inka also had craft specialists. However, the Inka used the mitmaq policy, which transplanted colonies of people, usually segments of communi­ties with a strong ethnic identity, into new locations for political and economic reasons. This led to the dispersal of conquered artisans throughout the empire (e.g., Spurling 1992:9). In contrast, the Chimu concentrated conquered artisans at Chan Chan (J. Topic 1990). While it has been estimated that only 5 to 6 percent of the total population of the north coast were skilled artisans (Ramirez 1982: 125), the vast majority of the adult popula­tion of Chan Chan were artisans: metalworkers, weavers, woodworkers, etc. 
Political economy, in turn, relates to the nature and speed of imperial expansion. As Theresa Topic (1990) reconstructs Chimu expansion, it was a rel­atively slow and steady process. There were many early fortifications in the home valley and in adja­cent valleys, but few documented late Chimu for­tifications on the far frontiers. The Inka, in contrast, seem to have gone through a very rapid initial phase of expansion, followed by a "bogging down" on the frontiers; while there were few fortifications around Cusco, they were common on the northern and southeastern frontiers. As Catherine Julien (1995) noted, the huge amounts of Inka storage, especially along the north highland road, may have been related to the endemic military campaigns in Ecuador. The Inka developed the infrastructure to support troops in the field for extended campaigns, resulting in a truly territorial empire (D' Altroy 1992; D' Altroy and Earle 1985). The Chimu, in contrast, would have been able to support an army close to home, but probably relied more on gift giv­ing (using elite items manufactured at Chan Chan) and alliance building with provincial nobles to cre­ate a more hegemonic empire. 
To some extent these differences are a matter of degree: the Chimu and Inka both employed a com­bination of seiiorial and bureaucratic administra­tions, alliance-building, gift-giving, and military force. Still, understanding the nuances of these kinds of relationships is necessary to advance our more general understanding of the past. It is still too early to say how much the differences between the Chimu and Inka political economies and strate-

gies of expansion were due to the difference in the portability of their respective record-keeping tech­nologies and, hence, the ability of their adminis­trators to control information flow over large distances, or whether the difference in the porta­bility was a result of differing political philoso­phies. 
The technology of an information-recording system impacts larger issues of economic and polit­ical organization. Understanding how Chimu administration developed and functioned has allowed insight into differences between Chimu and Inka political economies and strategies of expansion. Moreover, the fact that we can recon­struct Chimu administrative practices from mater­ial remains should encourage archaeologists to think more precisely about record keeping and administrative forms in the earlier Huari and Tiwanaku civilizations.

Notes 

1. 
These structures are also often referred to as audien­cias. Andrews (1974) has elaborated a formal typology of the structures, in which the term audiencia is used for a particu­lar type of U-shaped structure. 

2. 
Although both Schreiber (1992) and Kolata (1993) deal with Middle Horizon cultures, they do not discuss the evi­dence for Middle Horizon quipu. The sample of Middle Horizon quipu is not adequate to address the question of stan­dardization, discussed in subsequent sections of this paper; however, Pereyra S. (1997: 196) notes that pre-Inka quipus with wrapped pendent cords lack the positional values corre­sponding to units, 10s, IOOs, etc., which is standardized in the Inca quipu. 

3. 
The end date of 1653 is very arbitrary, but it corre­sponds to the completion of Coho's history. He indicates that the quipu was still used by experts (quipucamayoc) and gives an example of a quipucamayoc being called upon by Spanish authorities to aid in the investigation of a murder. 

4. 
Cummins's discussion of the Spanish conception of memory notes that the Spanish viewed the ideal memory aid as architectural in nature, a room (locz) with objects (ima­genes) placed around it; the speaker mentally goes around the room, using the objects to remind himself of the points to be made. Cummins (1 994: 194) asserts that "learning in a European sense is conditioned by mimetic (emphasis mine) images in terms of both loci and imagines, and this is what could be read into the Mexican pictorial manuscripts. The same could not be inscribed into the quipu, and thus, although the quipu is acknowledged as a device of artificial memory, it is not similar." Calancha's (1974-82):206-208 [ 1638]) clear (though perhaps hypothetical) discussion of how the colors of the cords and the sequence of numbers recorded on quipu were used to recite dynastic history belies this distinction. Still, one can think of the ideal Spanish memory aid as, for example, a church with the stations of the cross; the· images mimic key events in the storey of the crucifixion of Christ, but the order in which the images occur also contain information about the chronology of events. 

5. 
In thinking about stewards, I have in mind the herders in charge of the Huamachuco community's animals in the early seventeenth century. Florencia de Mora had left large estates to the community so that they could pay their tribute and the community kept huge herds of sheep, cattle, and horses on these lands. Each of the herds was under the care of a herder. We have accounts of these community herds from the 1620s (Archivo Regional de La Libertad, Corregimiento, legajo 174, expediente 742, ff. 2-92. Cuentas de la comu­nidad de Huamachuco aiio 1625), and it is likely that the herder kept these accounts on a quipu and then read them off to the Spanish administrators. There were a number of repet­itive categories of importance in terms of animal husbandry: father sheep, mother sheep, year-old horses, two-year-old horses, cows that had given birth, etc.

These herders were administrators of a sort, and the exer­cise of their office was intimately tied to the animals in their care. Unlike bureaucrats, stewards can function individually: in this example they kept accounts of their own herds and did not need to know what was happening with the other herds. The Spanish administrators who wrote down the herders' accounts, on the other hand, acted as bureaucrats: they did not need to count the sheep; all they needed to do was obtain the information about the numbers and categories of sheep from the herders. 
When the Spanish administrators received that informa­tion from the herders, they wrote it down in Spanish so that other administrators could access it too. The individual herders, though, could easily do their accounts with idiosyn­cratic quipu, each readable only by its maker. 
6. Administration and record keeping have also been dis­cussed for earlier civilizations. For example, Feldman (l 983) and Quilter (1991) suggest that stone-filled shicra (net bags made from reeds) found frequently in Preceramic monument construction may have been a method of tracking labor input. Moseley and Hastings (Hastings and Moseley 1975; Moseley l975b) and Cavallaro and Shimada (1988) discuss the use of maker's marks on adobe bricks for tracking labor for Early Intermediate period and Middle Horizon monuments. Sheila and Tom Pozorski (!991) discuss the possible use of cylinder seals in a bureaucratic context at Pampa de las Llamas in the Initial period. Christopher Donnan's (!971) discussion of the modern use of maker's marks tangentially addresses the issue of standardization. 
7. The focus in this section has been on the development of bureaucracy within the ciudadelas; as noted in the brief description of Chan Chan, U-shaped structures also occur outside of the ciudadelas. Some examples of these U-shaped structures are illustrated and discussed in Topic (l 990:Figures 7, 8, 9, and 11); these are all arcones, or structures that have bins rather than niches. Two of these structures are located in a communal kitchen and had food stored in the bins; another was in a metal working shop and a broken hammerstone was . 
found in one of the bins; still others had unspun cotton and craft materials in the bins. These examples all cross-date to the Late ciudadelas and illustrate graphically the difference between stewards, at the lower level of the administration, embedded in the shops and kitchens and dealing with real commodities, and the bureaucrats at the higher levels of the administration, dealing much more with information flow.
