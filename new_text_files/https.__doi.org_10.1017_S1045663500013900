
THE PAMPA DE CHAPARRl: 
WATER, LAND, AND POLITICS ON THE NORTH COAST OF PERU 

Frances M. Hayashida 

Large-scale irrigation agriculture formed the economic backbone of civilizations on the north coast of Peru. Contrary to the notion that large systems required the guiding hand of the state, historical sources suggest that management was largely local and segmentary. At the same time, water and land are a potential source of economic and political power for state administrators who may intervene in the supervision and management of farming. The Pampa de Chaparr{, in the Lam­bayeque region, is an unusually well-preserved system of canals, fields, and settlements where the dynamics of water, land and politics can be observed. Systematic survey documented a Middle Sican (A.D. 900-1100), Late Sican (A.D. 1100-1375), Chimu (A.D. 1375-1460) and lnka (A.D. 1460-1532) occupation. During Middle and Late Sican, settlement patterns reflect the segmentary organization described in historical accounts. With conquest by the Chimu and lnka Empires, state admin­istrative centers were constructed, existing social groups were reorganized and communities and households were trans­formed. Thus, though local management is an effective and stable strategy for managing large irrigation systems, the wealth and power that these systems represent make them potential targets for more direct state control, with significant conse­quef!ces for local inhabitants. 
La agricultura de irrigacion a gran escala fae fandamental en la econom{a de las civilizaciones de la costa norte del Peru. Lasfaentes historicas sugieren un manejo segmentario de estos sistemas a cargo de grupos locales, contradiciendo la nocion de la intervencion estatal como requisito para su funcionamiento. Asimismo, el agua y la tierra son faentes de poder economico y poUtico para los administradores estatales quienes pueden intervenir en la supervision y administracion de los cultivos. La Pampa de Chaparri, en la region Lambayeque, presenta sistemas de canales, campos de cultivo, y asentamientos en buen estado de conservacion, donde la dinamica entre el agua, la tierra, y la po/{tica puede analizarse. Prospecciones sistematicas documentaron ocupaciones durante los per{odos Sican Media (900-1100 d.C.), Sican Tardfo (1100-1375 d.C.), Chimu (1375-1460 d.C.) e lnka (1460-1532 d.C.). La organizacion segmentaria descrita en los documentos historicos se ve refie­jada en los patrones de asentamiento durante los per{odos Sican Media y Tardfo. A consecuencia de las conquistas Chimu e Inka se construyen centros administrativos estatales, reorganizando los grupos sociales existentes, y transformando las comu­nidades y unidades domesticas. Si bien la administracion local es una estrategia efectiva y estable para un adecuado manejo de sistemas de irrigacion a gran escala, su riqueza y poder los hacen igualmente blanco potencial del control estatal, conlle­vando cambios importantes en las poblaciones locales.

canal systems, provides another venue to test ideas about top-down versus bottom-up organization. 
In a recent essay, Erickson (2006) argued for bottom-up perspectives in studies of agricultural intensification. He notes that archaeologists tend to favor top-down views, and argues that this focus is based on neglect or misreadings of agricultural landscapes, with their patterns of fields and other features representing the efforts of farming com­munities over generations. These faulty interpre­tations are in turn based on problematic assumptions about the organizational abilities of farmers and their production strategies (e.g., that they produce a surplus only if forced to do so). To reinforce his argument, he draws on evidence from the historical and ethnographic record of farming. A bottom-up perspective is also favored by researchers and workers in sustainable develop­ment who have increasingly turned their attention to what is referred to as local, indigenous, or tra­ditional knowledge (Erickson 2003; Ostrom et al. 1999; Pich6n et al. 1999; Trawick 2003). Local knowledge systems encompass technology, prac­tices, and beliefs that have developed and persisted over generations; they are generally flexible and resilient but potentially vulnerable to outside pres­sures (e.g., conquest, incorporation into the global economy). Whether applied to the archaeological record or to modem communities, a bottom-up view focuses attention on the knowledge and prac­tices of farmers. 
At the same time, past and present farmers are articulated with states in different ways and to vary­ing degrees. Elites and institutions create conditions that can perpetuate, alter, or destroy local organi­zation. While states may interfere minimally with local affairs, they have the capacity to affect farm­ers' lives and the agricultural landscape by impos­ing taxes or providing subsidies, creating new conditions for access to water and land, expanding or reducing farmland, introducing new crops and technologies, and encouraging or transplanting new colonists. The effects may be particularly profound in the case of imperial expansion, as conquered areas are repositioned into entirely new economic and political geographies (Zimmerer 2000). In short, for agriculture in states, we may not be able to fully understand what is happening at the bot­tom unless we know what is happening at the top. While farming communities are fully capable of creating and managing large, intensive agricultural systems on their own, what happens when states intervene? 
Both top-down and bottom-up perspectives can be applied to prehispanic water management on the north coast of Peru. Here, large canal systems irri­gated coastal desert valleys providing the food and agricultural resources necessary to support large, complex civilizations (Billman 2002; Deeds et al. 1978; Deza 2001; Eling 1978, 1986, 1987a; Far­rington 1974, 1977, 1980, 1983, 1985; Farrington and Park 1978; Kosok 1965; Kus 1972, 1980, 1984; Moseley 1983; Moseley and Deeds 1982; Moseley et al. 1983; Netherly 1984; Nolan 1980; Ortloff 1993, 1995;0rtloff etal.1982, 1983, 1985;Pozorski 1987; Pozorski and Pozorski 1982; Rodriguez Suy Suy 1970; Shimada 2000; Tschauner 2001). There is strong documentary evidence that management was largely local (Netherly 1984, 1990, 1993), pro­viding an example of bottom-up organization (Erickson 2006). At the same time, crops did not simply feed farmers but also supported elites and state personnel; thus canals and the lands that they watered were of potentially great interest to the administrators of north coastal states such as the Moche, Sican, and Chimu, as well as the Iuka who conquered the north coast in A.D. 1460-1470. 
In this study, I evaluate irrigation organization on the north coast of Peru. The evidence is drawn from the study of canals, fields, and settlements on the Pampa de Chaparri in the Lambayeque region, which was watered by the intervalley Racarumi canal and its branches (Figure 1 ). Lambayeque was the heartland of the Sican state, and the pampa was initially occupied during the Middle Sican (A.D. 900-1100) period. Occupation continued during Late Sican (A.D. 1100-1375) and throughout the rule of the Chimu (A.D. 1375-1460) and Inka 
(A.D. 1460-1532) empires. The pampa was aban­doned soon after the Spanish Conquest (Zevallos Quinones 1975), thus providing the unusual oppor­tunity to investigate a relatively well-preserved pre­hispanic irrigation system2 and its associated fields and settlements. In other areas of the north coast, continuous cultivation since the conquest has oblit­erated much of the agricultural landscape. Our research addresses the following questions: What was the organization of water management and how did it change under different political regimes? To what extent did irrigation organization corre-

Irrigation Organization: Definition of Terms 
The term "centralization," often applied to irriga­tion, has caused some confusion because it is used to describe both a decision-making hierarchy as well as articulation with the state, thus potentially conflating
the internal organization of management with external control (Hunt 1988). In separating the two, Hunt (1988) described internal authority as ranging from concentrated (unified) to dispersed (acephalous). Unified authority may be hierarchi­cal (e.g., decisions handed down from higher to lower levels) or heterarchical (e.g., decisions reached through cooperation or negotiation between unranked or equally ranked units) (Hunt 1988;Kelly 1983; Scarborough 2003). Acephalous organization is rare, but has been noted for some 
small (less than 20 irrigated ha) systems (Hunt 1988). Ties to an external authority range from articulated to autonomous (Hunt 1988; Kelly 1983). In a highly articulated system, most or all decisions about construction, maintenance, conflict resolu­tion, and allocation are made by an external author­ity; in an autonomous system they are made locally. Note that management may be local, but produc­tion may be expanded or intensified in order to meet state tributary demands. Janusek and Kolata (2004) described such arrangements as incorpora­tive, while direct state control is transformative, to emphasize the changes in production and social organization that accompany the shift from autonomous to articulated. 
Several additional observations can be made. First, the organization of decision making may vary for different tasks. Thus decisions about day-to-day use and maintenance may be made by water users (farmers), while those for other tasks affecting the whole system, or requiring coordination over large areas (like construction or major repairs) may be made at a higher level. Similarly, within the same

irrigation system, there may be more or less state involvement in different irrigation decisions. Sec­ond, the external authority may be an entity other than the state, such as the hierarchy of water tem­ples in Bali where priests coordinate water alloca­tion, scheduling, and canal construction (Lansing 1991; Lansing and Kremer 1993). Third, decision making may be both hierarchical and heterarchi­cal (Scarborough 2003). Water authorities may make some decisions for lower ranked units, but they may also facilitate cooperation and coordina­tion between user groups as is the case in Bali. Fourth, periods of water shortage or abundance may also trigger organizational shifts. For exam­ple, scarcity may cause the enforcement of rules to ensure equitable distribution (Netherly 1984;Traw­ick 2001), or provoke its opposite, an increase in cheating or disproportionate use by more power­ful individuals or entities (Hunt and Hunt 1974; Scarborough 2003:99). 
Water Management on the North Coast: 
Historical and Archaeological Evidence 


The north coast of Peru is a desert intersected by rivers descending from the Andes that have their peak volumes during the highland rainy season (December through April). Coastal valleys are fan shaped, with narrow necks at the foothills of the Andes and flaring alluvial plains. Valley soils are fertile but cultivation is greatly restricted by water availability. In this hyperarid climate, successful cultivation of the valleys depends on the ability to capture and divert water through irrigation systems, and the ability to cope with flooding in El Nifio years as well as periodic droughts. The earliest canals were probably built during the Initial period (1800-900 B.C.), and irrigation systems grew through time reaching their maximum extent dur­ing the Late Intermediate period under the Sican and Chimu states (A.D. 1000-1470) (Pozorski 1987). On the north coast, the relative abundance of water and low gradient of extensive bottornlands in some of the valleys combined to create favor­able conditions for very large irrigation networks (Moseley et al. 1983; Shimada 1994:41). Canals were gravity fed; thus, by maintaining the maxi­mum elevation possible, a greater area could be watered (Moseley and Deeds 1982). Major canals had their intakes at the valley necks, following the 
contours of the valley margin with branch canals watering the fields downslope. The most desirable lands were near the intakes where water was plen­tiful (permitting two crops a year) and soils were better drained (Netherly 1984:235). 
Much of what we know about late prehispanic water management on the north coast comes from Netherly's (1984, 1990, 1993) careful analysis of early colonial documents. Based on these sources, she has convincingly argued that late prehispanic irrigation was organized along local sociopolitical lines. The north coastal polities that fell under Chimu and Inka rule were divided into dual nested hierarchies ruled at the top by a paramount lord with lesser lords heading the lower divisions. The poli­ties and their subdivisions were referred to as par­cialidades. As a nested hierarchy, the system was extremely flexible: 
the same lord, particularly the higher-ranking 
lords, could operate on different organizational 
levels simultaneously, with a correspondingly 
larger number of subordinate lords and sub­
jects under his direct control and, depending 
on his rank, a correspondingly greater access 
to human energy [Netherly 1984:233]. 
This organization had two implications for water management (Netherly 1984:233-234). First, for irrigation tasks, a larger or smaller labor force could be summoned as needed. Second, the land culti­vated by a parcialidad was defined by the canals that watered it. In other words, canals corresponded to sociopolitical divisions, a pattern that has also been observed at Inka Cuzco (Sherbondy 1987, 1992), at the Inka state farm at Cochabamba (Zim­merer 2000), and at modem communities in the highlands (Guillet 1992; Mitchell 1975). 
For example, in the case of the intervalley Taymi canal in Lambayeque, each of its 12 branch canals was "owned" by a different parcialidad (Netherly 1984:240-242). These in tum could be groupedinto four higher divisions of the major polities headed by paramounts located in Lambayeque. Each par­cialidad assigned to a branch canal was responsi­ble for cleaning a segment of the main canal. Thus those assigned to the twelfth canal cleaned the seg­ment up to the intake of the eleventh; those of the eleventh cleaned up to the intake of the tenth, and so on. All were responsible for cleaning the seg­ment between the intake of the first canal, and the

main intake at the Chancay River (Netherly 1984:243). Canal cleaning was an important social and ritual event led by the lords who distributed food and tools. The lords also resolved water dis­putes, and conflicts between subdivisions were han­dled by the next higher authority, which could be state officials in the case of conflicts involving para­mounts (Netherly 1984:244--245). Local polities also relied on the larger organizational capacities of the state in the event of major catastrophes such as severe damage by El Nifio flooding which called for large-scale rebuilding or repairs (Huertas Valle­jos 1987; Netherly 1984:245, 246). 
In short, the historical evidence suggests that late prehispanic water management was largely autonomous (independent of state control) and seg­mentary. It was not, however, egalitarian. Rights to water and lands were held by the lords, who granted access to subjects in return for labor and loyalty (Ramirez 1996:18-19). Lesser lords owed tribute to higher ranked lords in return for water rights while water flowing down some ravines was "bought" from highland lords by coastal para­mounts with cloth, salt, and agricultural products (Espinoza Soriano 1975; Ramirez 1996:17-18; Rostworowski de Diez Canseco 1988a:271). Not surprisingly, state officials were able to place them­selves at the top of this chain of obligations. With their conquest of the coast, the Inka first claimed then delegated lands and resources to local lords (Ramirez 1996:16), in essence returning to them what was already theirs, while making clear the power of the state to do so. 
In the archaeological record, evidence for Chimu claims to water, land, or crops is abundant. It is likely that many of the canals and fields in the Chimu heartland were directly managed by the state. Fields closest to Chan Chan, the capital located in the Moche Valley, were very regular in layout suggesting centralized management of canal construction, water distribution and crop produc­tion3 (Farrington 1977; Kus 1980:718; Moseley and Deeds 1982:41). Rural administrative centers in the Moche and neighboring Chicama Valleys incorporated many of the architectural attributes 
observed at Chan Chan (Farrington 1974:91; Keatinge 1974, 1975; Keatinge and Day 1973:285-291; Pozorski 1987:114-117). They were arguably established to oversee the construc­tion of canals and to supervise production. 
While it is not surprising that the Chimu con­trolled agriculture near the capital, evidence for state management also comes from the provinces. Provincial administrative centers, identified by the presence of architectural attributes drawn from Chan Chan, are located in rural areas close to fields (Mackey and Klymyshyn 1990:212), near the intakes of major canals or along their courses (Eling 1978:413; Keatinge and Conrad 1983; Tschauner 2001:102-174), and in low-lying areas that were farmed using raised fields (Mackey 1987: 128; Moore 1988, 1991; Pozorski et al. 1983). The Jequetepeque Valley under Chimu rule saw the development of extensive irrigation systems along with a series of strategically placed urban centers (Dillehay and Kolata 2004 ). While no major Chimu administrative centers have been documented in the Santa Valley, Wilson (1988:351) observed that settlements under Chimu rule are concentrated in the lower valley, i.e., the area best suited for agri­culture. By comparing arable lands with local pop­ulation estimates, he further suggested that a substantial surplus could have been grown, per­haps for tribute payments to the Chimu state. 
How then to reconcile the historical record of autonomy with the archaeological indicators for state control? It is important to remember that nei­ther record is complete and there are biases in each. It can be difficult to sort out prehispanic organiza­tion from even early colonial accounts given the disruption of the Spanish Conquest, the biases of foreign observers, and the gaps in the historical record. There simply may have been greater vari­ation in irrigation organization than is apparent from colonial accounts. 
There are also gaps in the archaeological record of water management. We lack information on the lower level canal branches, associated settlements, and the patterning of fields that are needed to reconstruct the organization of agricultural pro­duction (Erickson 2006; Walker 2004). This is largely due to the destruction of much of the pre­hispanic rural landscape by historic and modem cultivation and urban growth, but partly due to the different research goals of previous archaeologi­cal studies of the late prehispanic north coast. Sim­ilarly, in most cases, we lack detailed regional contexts for provincial Chimu administrative sites. The presence of a Chimu center by itself does not necessarily signify that the state made all water

management decisions. The Chimu, like other con­querors through time (including the Inka and the Spaniards who followed), may have relied heav­ily on local elites and existing practices that per­sisted intact into the historical period. 
We need additional evidence to clarify the rela­tionship between parcialidades, the state, and water and land management and to resolve the apparent discrepancies between the historical and archaeological records. Ideally, archaeological evi­dence should be systematically collected from an entire irrigation system and its associated fields and settlements. Studies of individual sites can only provide a partial perspective on state-local inter­actions; a regional approach reveals changing pat­terns in settlements, canals, and fields through time that reflect both the internal organization of par­cialidades and their external articulation with the state. 
The correspondence of social and irrigation organization should be detectable in the archaeo­logical record. If water management was a major organizing principal as suggested by colonial accounts, we can expect the spatial association of social groups with irrigation branches. The nested hierarchy of parcialidad divisions should be expressed as a site hierarchy corresponding to the canal hierarchy. Thus the largest center (the seat of the paramount) will be associated with the primary canal, secondary centers with secondary canals, and smaller sites with lower branches of the irri­gation system. 
Evidence for state control of water and land includes the establishment of state administrative centers, increased production (e.g., through the expansion of canals), centralized field planning (as is seen near Chan Chan), an influx of colonists (to increase available labor), and the construction of storehouses and roads for tribute collection and transportation. The co-occurrence of several of these different lines of evidence would argue strongly for state control. Many of these features co-occur in the most extreme example of state­managed agriculture known for the precolumbian Andes, the Inka state farms and estates whose pro­duce supported royal households, the military and other personnel (D' Altroy 2002:127-140, 268-276; Espinoza Soriano 1973; Gyarmati and Varga 1999; Julien 1998; La Lone and La Lone 1987; Murra 1980:29-44; 1991; Netherly 1988; Rostworowski de Diez Canseco 1988b; Wachtel 1982). 
The Pampa de Chaparri: Setting and History 
The study area, the Pampa de Chaparri, is located within northern Lambayeque, which includes the Lambayeque (or Chancay as it is called along the upper course), Leche, and Motupe river valleys. The Lambayeque Valley is particularly productive with a relatively stable and abundant water supply (total yearly discharge in a typical year is between 700-900 x 106 m3 (Delavaud 1984:42-43; Mose­ley 1983:785) and a cultivable area (contiguous with the Leche Valley plain) of approximately 86,000 ha of irrigated farmland today (Delavaud 1984:85). Two prehispanic intervalley canals linked the Lambayeque to the Leche Valley: the Taymi and the Racarumi (Figure 1). The Taymi irrigated the extensive lower alluvial plain and this use contin­ues to this day. Settlements associated with the ancient Taymi have recently been surveyed by Tschauner (2001) who recorded a Moc he V through Inka occupation. 
The Racarumi system irrigated the Pampa de Chaparri, a small valley that runs between the Lam­bayeque and Leche Valleys (Figures 1 and 2). Paul Kosok (1965:159-160) published a brief descrip­tion of the pampa based on visits made in the 1940s during his extensive survey of irrigation systems on the north coast of Peru. Several decades after Kosok's work, Shimada and Craig created a map of the main canal (the Racarumi I) and its branches (the Racarumi II canals) based on aerial pho­tographs taken in 1975 (Shimada 1982, 1990). By the time of their study, a portion of the main canal (just above the pampa) had been destroyed by the construction of the Tinajones Reservoir, which is fed by a modem canal that follows the ancient course. 
The pampa, an apparent synclinal trough drained by the Sanj6n River, is filled with alluvial deposits from the hills flanking the east and west sides (Nordt et al. 2004). In total, approximately 5600 ha of ancient cultivated fields are visible in aerial photographs of the zone. 
Shimada (1990) posited that the Pampa de Chaparri was developed by the Sican state as part of an agro-industrial complex marked by an increase in mining and smelting operations, settle-

ment growth, and the expansion of agriculture. While these developments were concentrated in the Leche Valley, where the Middle Sican and Late Sican capitals were located, there is increasing evi­dence that similar changes were happening in the Lambayeque Valley (also Tschauner 2001; Yokoyama et al. 1999), as well as in more distant valleys that may have been incorporated into the Sican polity (Hocquenghem 1998:160-168). 
These resources and the large, skilled, Sican population were captured by the Chimu, a com­peting north coastal state, with their conquest of Lambayeque in ca. A.D. 1350-1400 (Sandweiss 1995:77; Shimada 1990:366; Shimada et al. 1982). Some have proposed that Chimu expansion into the region was spurred by the failure of irrigation works near Chan Chan, the Chimu capital located to the south in the Moche Valley, as well as by a desire to obtain other natural and human resources such as mines and skilled metalworkers (Ortloff 1993; Pozorski 1987; Shimada 2000; Topic 1990). The great increase in building and craft activities at Chan Chan following the incorporation of Lam­bayeq ue supports this interpretation (Kolata 1990:138-139; Topic 1990:149-150). 
The Chimu territory eventually extended from the Tumbes Valley in the north to the Chill6n Val­ley on the central coast of Peru. Lambayeque was conquered in the last of three phases of Chimu expansion. The Chimu ruled through a hierarchy of provincial administrative centers, some newly established, others grafted onto local sites (Don­nan and Cock 1986; Keatinge 1974, 1975; Keatinge and Conrad 1983; Keatinge and Day 1973; Mackey 1987; Mackey and Klymyshyn 1990; Pozorski 1987; Schaedel 1951; Tschauner 2001; Wilson 1988:290). These centers are identified by archi­tectural features that mimic those found at Chan Chan, though the later centers (including those found in Lambayeque), often combined local or entirely new attributes with Chimu traits. 
With their defeat of the Chimu, the Inka took 
over the north coast in ca. A.D. 1460. They dis­
mantled the upper tiers of the Chimu ruling hier­
archy, reoccupied some Chimu provincial 
administrative sites, established new centers and 
way stations on major roadways, and relocated 
coastal dwellers to other parts of the empire (Con­
rad 1977; Epstein and Shimada 1983; Espinoza 
Soriano 1969-70; Hayashida 1999, 2003; Helsley 1980; Heyerdahl et al. 1995; Hocquenghem 1998:186, 219-261; Narvaez and Hoyle 1985; Ramirez 1990, 1996; Mackey 2003; Rowe 1948; Shimada et al. 1982). Inka interest in, and impact on, north coastal agriculture has been harder to define. This is in part due to the scarcity of docu­mentary sources on Inka rule of the north coast, as well as the difficulty in distinguishing Inka from Chimu period occupations in the archaeological record, a problem discussed more fully below. 
Canals, Fields, and Settlements on the 
Pampa de Chaparri 

Our research on the Pampa de Chaparrf has included inspection of air photos, field mapping of canals and fields, systematic pedestrian survey to locate sites, site mapping and surface collections, soil and geomorphological studies (Nordt et al. 2004), and test excavations in canals, fields, and middens. In the remainder of the paper, I discuss the prehispanic landscape and its changes through time, focusing on the results of the survey. To date, we have focused on the canals that watered the west bank of the Sanj6n and their fields and set­tlements. For the sake of clarity, I employ the canal terminology of Doolittle ( 1990: 14-17) where the main canal has its intake in the water source (the Chancay River), distribution canals carry water from the main canal to lateral canals that termi­nate in the fields, and.field canals (that include irri­gation furrows) carry water from the lateral canals across the field surface. 
The Canals 
Though largely destroyed by the construction of the Tinajones Reservoir, the course of the main canal, the Racarumi I , above the pampa can be traced out on a series of air photos from 1962 (Servicio Aere­fotografico Nacional (SAN) project number 81-62) that predate the reservoir construction (Kosok 1965:161). The Racarumi I had its intake in the nar­row valley neck approximately 10 km above the town of Chongoyape (Figure 1). It travels west, crosses a pass between two hills as it enters the pampa, then turns sharply to the northwest, fol­lowing the course of the Sanj6n River before emerg­ing on its east bank and continuing towards the Leche Valley. Three distribution canals, the Racarumi Ila, lib, and Ile (hereafter Rlla Rllb, and

Riie ), had their intakes in the Racarumi I soon after it turns to the northwest (Figure 2).4 No fields are detectable on the air photos along the course of the Racarumi I before it enters the parnpa, but this is an area that was already highly disturbed in 1962, when our earliest photographs were taken. On the pampa itself, most of the ancient fields (3300 ha) are west of the Sanj6n, and were watered by the Racarumi II canals; an additional area at the north end of the pampa, was cultivated on the eastern side of the Sanj6n. 
The largest site on the Racarumi I is Campa­mento de Paredones, situated approximately 6 km below the intake (Figure 1). It extends over roughly 60 ha, with a core area characterized by an impres­sive series of platform mounds that ascend a hill. Recent fieldwork at the site has identified a Mid­dle Sican through Chimu occupation, as well as evi­dence for metallurgical (bronze) production (Yokoyama et al. 1999). Campamento de Pare­dones is more than six times larger than the largest site identified in our survey of sites on the pampa; during its occupation, it was probably the primary center for the polity associated with the Racarumi system. 
Kosok ( 1965) described a group of several adobe mounds where the Racarumi I enters the pampa, not far from the intakes for the distribution canals. Two mounds are still visible though they were badly disturbed by looting and construction associated with the Tinajones Reservoir. At present, the largest mound measures approximately 90 x 50 x 9 m. In a brief visit to the site, we found very few sherds. Large platform mounds are characteristic of Sican ceremonial and administrative architecture (Shi­mada 2000:56-63; Shimada and Cavallaro 1986; Tschauner 2001:296-330), and the mounds may have been built at this time. 
The Racarumi II distribution canals were mapped using a handheld GPS receiver, with read­ings taken every 100 m (Freeburg 2002). Intakes for lateral canals leading to the fields were also

noted where visible, as were any unusual features. Multiple channels characterize all three of the Racarumi II canals. In some areas, it was clear that new channels were cut after segments were washed out by flooding. 
The distribution canal at the highest elevation (the Rlla) crosses deep gullies as well as hills, and was excavated into very gravelly (and hence porous) sediments. Construction of this canal pro­ceeded in some sections by trial and error, with mul­tiple channels cut and some abandoned during construction. Short aqueducts transported water over low spots. At deep gullies, the aqueduct bases were constructed of large boulders and stones that permitted the passage of water in rainy years. The lowest distribution canal, the Rile, closely follows the Sanj6n before making a sharp tum through a low spot in a large hill (Cerro Arena). Here, to maintain the gradient, the canal bed was cut into the hill by using large hammer stones (rounded cobbles with battered edges) to chip away at the bedrock. Canals were apparently unlined, though sharp turns were sometimes reinforced with stone. No permanent gates or diversions were observed, and it is likely that diversions were temporary and constructed of earth, stones, sticks and brush when needed, a practice that continues today (Eling 1987b). 
The Fields 
In the aerial photographs, three areas with differ­ent field patterns (based on the spacing and orien­tation of lateral and field canals) can be discerned. For convenience, these are termed the South, Mid­dle, and North fields. The South fields were those watered by the upper portions of the Rlla and Rilb. Lateral canals run perpendicular to the distribution canals in a very regular pattern over an area of approximately 900 ha; the appearance is of a sin­gle, large plot or of identical plots laid out in strips defined by the lateral canals. These are the highest fields in the system and would have potentially received the most water, perhaps producing two crops a year. The Middle fields were watered by the lower Rlla and RIIb, in the area in and around Cerro Arena. Lateral and field canals are more vari­able, perhaps adapting to changes in the slope of the planting surface. Field canal orientations vary though spacing is still fairly regular. The North fields, watered by the Rile, are the most variable, 
giving the appearance of a patchwork of plots, with variation in field sizes as well as field canal orien­tations and spacing. 
A detailed discussion of the fields, together with the results of soil analyses from test excavations in fields appears in a separate publication (Nordt et al. 2004). In brief, soil fertility levels were gener­ally high in all three field areas, though external inputs for nitrogen would have been necessary. The relatively coarse texture of pampa soils meant that frequent irrigation was necessary. At the same time, soil permeability, together with low salt content in the Chancay waters, kept salinity levels low in all three field areas. 
Initial analyses of macrobotanical remains and pollen indicate that Gossypium (cotton) and Zea mays (maize) were grown. Other identified culti­gens include Cucurbita sp. (squash), Capsicum sp. (pepper),Annona sp. (guanabana or chirimoya), Lucuma bifera (lucuma), Psidium guajava (guava), Arachis hypogaea (peanut), Phaseolus sp. (com­mon bean), Phaseolus limensis (lima bean), Canavalia sp. Uackbean), Inga feuillei (pacae), Persea americana (avocado), Lagenaria sp. or Cucurbita sp. gourd, Solanum tuberosum (potato), and Ipomoea batata (sweet potato). 
The Survey 
Methods. Settlements were located through sys­tematic pedestrian survey of a 38 km2 area divided into blocks of approximately 1 km2• Each block was covered by a team of four persons spaced at 40 m intervals. "Sites" were identified as discrete areas with architecture or a high concentration of surface artifacts. Isolated structures or groups of structures spaced more than 50 m apart and lacking a con­tinuous concentration of artifacts between them were classified as separate sites. 
Names of sites were based on air photo num­ber, block number within the photo (A, B, C), and the order of discovery within the block. Two sets of photos from S.A.N. projects were used, one from 1962 (project number 81-62 with photo numbers 2358 and higher) and the other from 1975 (project number 270-75 with photo numbers 81-262). Thus site number 86A06 is the sixth site recorded in the first block surveyed within the area covered by the 270-75-86 air photo. 
Dating was based on surface diagnostic pottery 
and other artifacts. For the Sican periods (and to a

lesser extent, Chimu), we relied on the preliminary pottery seriation by Kathryn Cleland and Izumi Shimada of the Sican Archaeological Project drawn from stratigraphic excavations at the Huaca del Pueblo Batan Grande and other sites in the Leche Valley as well as their study of museum col­lections; Tschauner's observations from fieldwork along the Taymi were also consulted (Cleland and Shimada 1992, 1998; Shimada 1990; Tschauner 2001 :628-65 5). 
One persistent dating problem in north coastal archaeology has been an inability to clearly dis­tinguish Chimu from Inka period occupations (Hayashida 2003). This is due to the lack of a sys­tematic pottery seriation (Shimada 2000:100) and to the conservative character of pottery styles from this era (especially utilitarian pottery, which is most prevalent at rural habitation sites). Objects and architecture incorporating classic Inka attributes are rare on the north coast. While this might be attributed to a nonexistent or weak Inka incorpo­ration of the region, recent research particularly in northern Lambayeque has identified clear evidence for an Inka imperial presence including state instal­lations along the coastal trunk road (Hayashida 1999; Helsley 1980; Shimada 1981), at a major local center (Heyerdahl et al. 1995), and at a met­allurgical production site (Epstein and Shimada 1983; Shimada et al. 1982). Yet even at these sites, the percentage of pottery in Inka styles is low, and 
mostly restricted to distinctive vessels used for feasting or other ceremonial acts (Hayashida 1999). It can thus be very difficult to distinguish Chimu from Inka period occupations. A site with artifacts or architecture with classic Inka attributes undoubt­edly had an Inka period occupation. In their absence, the site may have had a Chimu or Inka occupation, or both. Faced with this problem, one option is to identify as Inka only those sites having artifacts with Inka attributes. However, this poten­tially results in the overestimation of Chimu occu­pations and the problematic conclusion that there was a demographic collapse under Inka rule. The second, more conservative option, is to acknowl­edge our inability to cleanly separate the two peri­ods, and to lump them into one, ChimU/lnka,5 while noting sites with Inka diagnostics. While less than satisfying, this is the most prudent route to take until 
we refine the seriation of late prehispanic north coastal material culture. 
The Settlements 
Middle Sican (A.D. 900-1100). Thirty-nine sites 
with a Middle Sican occupation were identified, 
with 38 residential sites and 1 cemetery (Figure 3). 
Excluding the cemetery, the total area of the sites 
is 21.55 ha, with an average site size of .58 ha. 
Sites were established above the highest course of the Rlla and above the Rile, suggesting a Mid­dle Sican construction date for these two canals. A single site adjacent to the RIIb was located at the base of a small hill; the relative prevalence of fine Middle Sican pottery at this site (and its paucity at other sites) and the presence of a small platform mound suggest that it may have had a ceremonial function. 
Each of the two distributional canals in use dur­ing Middle Sican was associated with a large res­idential site (Site 81F15 with the Rlla and Site 256A01 with the Rile), suggesting the correspon­dence of social divisions and canals described in historic accounts (Netherly 1984). These two sites, on two distribution canals would have been second­tier centers, subordinate to the primary center (Campo de Paredones), which is located on the main canal, the Racarumi I. Additional divisions are apparent along the Rlla, where sites form five clusters spaced between 1.4 and 2.3 km apart. These may represent additional subdivisions of the Rlla 
parcialidad. 
Site 83D 11 has a group of three adobe mounds, the largest measuring approximately 60 x 40 x 3 
m. It was centrally located along the Rlla, within the third cluster of sites, and may have served as a ceremonial center for all groups along the Rlla (and perhaps those along the Rile for there are no cor­responding constructions). 
Late Sican (A.D. 1100-1375). Within the sur­vey area, we identified 76 sites with a Late Sican occupation, including 10 cemeteries and 66 resi­dential sites (Figure 4). Fourteen of the sites also have a Middle Sican component. Excluding the cemeteries, the total site area is 23.16 ha with an average site size of .35 ha. 
Both major settlements along the Rlla and Rile (256A01 and 81Fl5) as well as the mound center (83Dll) continued to be occupied. The five site clusters along the Rlla also persisted, though they were less tightly defined. This patterning suggest the continuation of the social groupings along canals that began in Middle Sican.
