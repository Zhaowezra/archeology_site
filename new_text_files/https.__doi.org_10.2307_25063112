graphic and archaeological data about this enigmatic group that has fascinated Mayanists since the 19th cen­tury. 
One of the problems of establishing Lacandon iden­tity is that many Maya ethnic groups have inhabited the tropical forest of southern Mexico and Guatemala his­torically, and these are often believed to be Lacandon. Palka has unpacked this misperception with a lengthy analysis of the "Lacandon groups" and their varied lin­guistic and ethnic affiliations. Far from being a single group descendant from the residual populations of the classic Maya, many Maya groups have entered and occu­pied this tropical forest region including the ltza, Chol, and Yucatec Maya speaking groups. Indeed, Palka argues that the Lacandon are the result of an ethnogen­esis of various Maya groups that have moved into the region because of conflict, migration, and colonial dom­inance of nearby areas. Interestingly enough, the uses of metal tools and Old World tree crops (such as the mango) have permitted these groups to survive in the forest and increase their field sizes and escape the forces of domination and colonialism. While not isolated from contact, they have been able to manage and control the amount of that contact. These and other data lead Palka to conclude that: "the Lacandon cannot be the direct descendants of the ancient Maya since their culture did 
not exist before it was generated through inter­indigenous interaction in the tribal zone during the late eighteenth century" (p. 73), and "the Lacandon are no more connected to ancient Maya civilization than other Maya groups" (p. 276). 
Palka introduces the book with a brief treatment of the perceptions of the Lacandon, their tribal area, and describes the resources used in the book. Chapter 2 introduces the history of the Lacandon from the per­spective of culture change and interaction, concluding with a comparison of similarities in culture change with Lowland South America. Then, Palka summarizes the ethnographic context showing both spatial and tempo­ral variation in Lacandon subgroups and in other ethnic groups that make ethnic identification of the Lacandon difficult. In the "Historical Background" chapter, Palka describes further ethnic complexity of the Lacandon in that they "share some linguistic and cultural affinities with the Yucatec-speaking Maya including the Itzaj and Khach" (p. 72). Indeed, the historical data that point to "multiple cultural origins and ethnogenesis of the Lacan­don during the early to mid-l 700s" (p. 72). Data on households, settlements, and demography are presented in the next chapter along with population sizes, and those factors that affect settlement size such as conflict, disease, and assimilation. The archaeology ofLacandon settlement is then presented (Chapter 6) detailing the archaeological methodology and description of the exca­vations. The artifacts are described in the next chapter 
and are followed by interpretations of what these data reveal about Lacandon economic life, outside contact, and cultural change (Chapter 8). Palka then describes the changes in social life (Chapter 9) and religious life (Chapter 11) that parallel his interpretation of the arti­facts. Finally, Palka wraps up the book with a chapter detailing the implications of his work for indigenous cul­ture change in areas beyond the frontier of colonial pow­ers such as among the Shuar and Ashaninka in lowland South America. Generally, Palka has "shed light on the interaction and indigenous culture changes well beyond the frontier of colonial powers" (p. 279) and has shown how cultural interaction and cultural change were dif­ferent from societies under direct colonial rule. How does this relate to other groups? "Instead of succumb­ing to the final conquest and assimilating, the Lacandon continue to retain their ethnicity and purse their lives as they, and not others, choose" (p. 292). 
One of the most fascinating parts of the book is Palka's excavation of the Lacandon sites. As would be expected, the amount and extent of Lacandon settle­ments pale in comparison to their predecessors of the region-particularly when Palka describes his excava­tions of Lacandon settlement within the ancient center of Tikal, and that a few kilometers from the ancient site of Dos Pilas. He skillfully relates the occupation and material culture of the sites to both oral histories from the groups he visited and to the historic and ethnohis­toric documents that note their location, size, and in some cases, their ethnicity. From the archaeological residues, Palka is able to reconstruct the degree of con­tact with outsiders and establish material markers of what appears to genuinely reflect Lacandon ethnicity, the "god pot." 
I gained a lot from reading this book. One of the most fascinating tidbits of information was that in spite of the meager remains of the Lacandon, relic fruit trees (such as mango) were almost always markers of Lacandon archaeological sites. Excavation of sites that have essen­tially no surface archaeology, and that lie in an envi­ronment in which forest detritus quickly covers any surface artifacts, the existence of useful fruit trees (in this case, postconquest fruits) provides an important marker ofLacandon sites. This approach to tropical for­est archaeology would be undoubtedly useful in other areas as well in which no surface archaeology is other­wise evident. 
Palka's use of archaeology, history, ethnohistory, oral history, and ethnography make this book an impor­tant contribution to challenge conventional views of what appear to be pristine societies believed to have descended unchanged from Precolumbian antecedents. One wonders how many other archaeological images of contemporary societies will collapse under the weight of careful and thorough scholarship like Palka's.
