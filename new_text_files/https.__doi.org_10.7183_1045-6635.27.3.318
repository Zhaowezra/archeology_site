Increasingly, archaeological research in Amazonia is revealing complex precolonial occupation in areas around riverineconfluences. In 2014, the first site­based archaeological investigations were undertaken in Gurupá, Pará, Brazil, a munic­ipality that spans the region of the Xingu­Amazon confluence. The Portuguese controlled access to Amazonia from 1623onward through a network of settlements organized around Gurupá. Results from extensive excavations of terrapretasites, landscape archaeology, and analysis of ceramic evidence suggest that this was also a precolonial crossroads. Carrazedo,once a booming historical town (Arapijó), sits atop a significantly larger terra preta site. Excavations in historical and pre­colonial sectors of Carrazedo found well­preserved remains, including a precolonial house terrace complex. The extent ofterra preta and earthworks at Carrazedo indicate that the precolonial occupation was more intensive than the colonial­his­torical period occupation. Regional survey revealed colonial­historical period sites consistently overlying expansive pre­colonial sites, the density and extent of which suggest a major precolonial center at the Xingu­Amazon confluence. Overall,ecological and landscape modifications appear to have been more intense in the precolonial past than during later periods.Short­and long­distance settlement networks also differed during the two periods. This as­of­yet understudied regionpromises to shed new light on deep­time human­environment interactions and spatial organization in the humid tropics ofAmazonia. 
Cada vez mais pesquisas arqueológicas na Amazônia têm revelado ocupações pré­coloniais complexas nas confluências degrandes rios. Em 2014, foram desenvolvidas as primeiras investigações arqueológicas acadêmicas em Gurupá/Pará/Brasil,ummunicípio localizado na confluência dos rios Xingu eAmazonas. Entre os séculos XVII e XIX, os Portugueses controlaram
o acesso à Amazonia através de uma complexa rede de assentamentos organizada no entorno de Gurupáá. Extensos sítios deTerra Preta, assim como evidências da paisagem e da cerâmica sugerem que este local foi uma importante encruzilhadatambém no período pré­colonial.

extensiveprehistoric terrapretadoíndio (anthro­pogenicblackearth)sites(RichardPace,personalcommunication 2013; Schaan and Martins 2010;Shepard 2012). Based at the Museu ParaenseEmílio Goeldi (MPEG) in Belém, Brazil, OCAbrings together researchers working on earth, bi­ological, and social sciences to investigate formsof human­environment interaction. With a focus on spatiotemporal articulations of social and nat­ural systems, its members investigate environ­mental modifications, their causal mechanisms,and their relationship to change or stability in hu­man societies. 
The primary research question of the OCAre­searchprogramis whetherAmerindian andEuro­Brazilian strategies for occupying tropical forestlandscapes,suchasAmazonia,manifestindistinctways spatially and ecologically. The archaeolog­ical record of the municipality of Gurupá, whichstraddlestheXingu­Amazonconfluence,presentssubstantial evidence for landscape modificationandintensivehabitationfromca.A.D.500toA.D. 1550. The region was also the first inland site ofEuropean colonization in theAmazon Basin. Set­tled ca. A.D. 1600, Gurupá is particularly wellsituatedtohighlighttransitionsordistinctionsbe­tween indigenous and European forms of habita­tion and land­use, as well as technological, envi­ronmental, demographic, and sociopoliticalchange. This understudied region also providestheopportunity tostudy flows ofinformationandmaterial goods between the well­known centersof Marajó and Santarém in precolonial and colo­nial­historicaltimes(Figure1b).Finally,thispio­neer research produced a preliminary frameworkfor articulating the fields of Amazonian Amerindian archaeology and the study of Ibero­American frontier towns by contextualizing set­tlementpatterns,formsofhabitation,andmaterialculturefromtheprecolonialandcolonial­historicalperiods.
Our research focused on the site of Carrazedo,an early colonial­historical period town locatedatop an extensive (~ 30 ha) terra preta site. Theterra preta sites of Jocojó, Jacupi, and Gurupá­Miri (Figure 1c), which revealed surface featuressimilar to those seen at Carrazedo, provide com­parative surface­morphological data. SurveyaroundCarrazedo,Jocojó,andGurupá­Miri—threetraditional communities that occupy prehistoric terra preta sites, practice similar agro­extractiveresource management, and govern traditionallydefinedterritories—providedcomparativedataforunderstandingspatialdistributionofhistoricalandprehistoricsettlementsinthemunicipality(Figure1c). The three territories demonstrate a more di­versifiedhabitationpatterninprehistoricthancolo­nial­historical times. Some overlap of habitationareas over time suggests either a degree of conti­nuity or European reoccupation of modified pre­colonial landscapes or ecologies.
Historical­period Carrazedo is significantlysmaller and differently organized than its pre­colonial predecessor (Figure 2a, b). Historicalmaterialremains,includingconstructionmaterialsfrom the mouth of the Amazon, support localclaims of prominence in the early twentieth cen­tury.Surfaceceramicscatters,includingimportedwhitewares, attest to early Colonial­period occu­pationandparticipationinglobaltradenetworks.Excavations conducted as part of OCA 2014 re­searchseasonrevealedcomplextwentieth­centuryarchitecturalremainsthat, althoughonly partiallyexposed, indicate good preservation of near­sur­face remains, as well as additional habitationphases not attested to in the written and oral his­torical traditions.

Background 
The Research Area 
Gurupá was settled early by the Portuguese be­cause of its strategic location, which stems fromphysiographic, ecological, and cultural factors(Figure1b).ThecityispositionedwheretheAma­zonDeltachannelsmergeintotheLowerAmazon,providing access to the trade routes that connect the greater Amazon Valley, the Delta, the XinguRiverandtheAtlanticOcean.Stretchingfromthemouth of the Xingu River to the right bank of theAmazon, the municipality of Gurupá is bisectedby the floodplain­upland ecological divide. TheGreater Island of Gurupá, the westernmost islandin the Marajó archipelago, marks the transitionbetweentheecologicallydistinctestuarine/deltaicand riverine zones of the Lower Amazon basin (Ab’saber 2010:19–20). This junction providesimmediateaccesstoresourcesfromtheblackwater Xingu River and the whitewater Amazon Riverand mediates access to the central Brazilian plateau and the Middle and UpperAmazon.

linkingtheXinguRiver,theCentralAmazonRiver,and the Northern Brazilian coastline to Europe.The largely rural municipality boasts cities andtowns on both rivers.The small urban centers, in­cludingGurupá,havebeencontinuouslyoccupiedsince initial settlement by the Dutch in the earlyseventeenthcentury(Kelly1984:7–8,24).Wethusconsider the municipality of Gurupá ecologicallyandhistoricallyrepresentativeoftheXingu­Ama­zon River confluence region (Figure 1). 
History of the RegionAlong the Mouth of the Xingu River 
ThemouthoftheXinguRiverwasacentralpointof contact and conflict in the early colonizationofAmazoniabyDutch,Irish,English,andFrenchsettlers since the 1590s. In 1623, the Portuguesefounded the city of Gurupá, from whence theywaged battles for control of the Amazon Riveruntil ca. 1650 (Lorimer 1989). During this time,the Fort of St. Anthony of Gurupá was also amajor slaving port (Hemming 1978:335). Por­tuguese missionaries, having arrived circa 1625,undertookthefounding ofvillages,missions,andconvents, active from ca. 1640–1759 (Amorim2005:84, 96; Baena 2004 [1839]:229; Borromeu1940:1;Kelly1984:34–36,42–43).Fromthemid­eighteenth to the late nineteenth century, Gurupáremainedamilitaryandlegislativecenterandeco­nomic hub, integrating theAmazonian hinterlandinto global trade networks (Baena 2004 [1839]:229, 233–35; Bates 1975 [1863]:229;Daniel 2004 [1776]:58; Ferreira 1971 [1874]:9;Kelly 1984:140–185; La Condamine 1944[1745]:106;SpixandMartius1981:82;Verissimo1970:219).Whenrubberpricesboomedca.1890,Gurupáprospered.Thecitycollapseddemograph­ically and economically following the economiccrash of 1911–1912 (Pace 1998; Wagley 1953).
Gurupá was a central place in the symbolicgeography and political economy of Amazoniaand Brazil, as colony, empire, and republic. Inspite of this, its history is little known because ofinconsistentdocumentationpractices(Baena2004[1839];Ferreira1971:9–10)andalackofregionalhistories (for exceptions, see Kelly 1984; Pace1998).After1912,Gurupádisappearedfrompub­lic spheres of knowledge. Kelly’s (1984) socialhistoryremainsthebestsourcefortheperiodfrom1755–1890.Anthropological studies ofAmazon­ian modernity byWagley (1953) and Pace (1998)offerinformationaboutmorerecentdevelopmentsin this region. Prior to 2010, archaeological re­search had documented the presence of ca. 50sites (Schaan and Martins 2010). 
Carrazedo 
Oneofthe oldestPortuguese settlementsinAma­zonia, Colonial­period Carrazedo was foundedca. 1655 as the Jesuit mission of Arapijó (Kelly1984:42–43). Carrazedo is situated on top of anextensive terra preta site that contains terraces,mounds, pits, and paths. It overlooks the Car­razedo channel of the mouth of the Xingu River(Figure 2a). Documentary sources and oral tradi­tionssuggestthatthehistoryofCarrazedomirrorsthat of the municipality of Gurupá in terms ofpopulationdensity,economicactivity,andpoliticalprominence (Kelly 1984:180–265; Shepard2012:5–6).A1755engravingbymilitaryengineerJoséAndré Schwebel (Figure 3a), who accompa­nied then­governor Francisco Xavier MendonçaFurtadoonareconnaissancejourneyuptheAma­zonRiver,atteststothecity’sformerprominence.Increasingly abandoned during the 1950s and1960s(BenevaldoMarquesCorrêa,personalcom­munication 2014; Flávio Nascimento, personalcommunication 2014), Carrazedo offers betterpreservation of archaeological remains than Gu­rupá. Residents of contemporary Carrazedo, whorelocated to the floodplain, retain memories ofthe historical town, including the location ofstreets, buildings, and the cemetery.
In 2013, an area of approximately 1 ha withinthe boundaries of historical Carrazedo was bull­dozed in preparation for a government housingproject, revealing material evidence for severalepisodes in the complex history of Carrazedo.Carrazedowasamajorexporterofforestandagri­cultural products (Baena 2004 [1839]:233–34;Kelly 1984:263). The presence of seventeenth­andeighteenth­centuryDutchandPortuguese ce­ramics attests to the participation of the town inglobal trade networks. During the rubber boom,Carrazedo attained the administrative status of District, which it retained until the 1950s(Benevaldo Marques Corrêa, personal communi­cation 2014; Flávio Nascimento, personal com­munication2014;Wagley1953).Likeneighboringtowns, Carrazedo founderedafter the crash of the

rubber economy. Today, the territory titled to theCarrazedo community supports the largest fish­ing/farming population in the upland territoriesof Gurupá. The significantly smaller Carrazedositepresentsadegreeoflandscapemodification—evident in the extent and frequency of terra pretastains and earthen features and density and vari­ability of surface ceramics—that suggests signif­icantly denser settlement in the precolonial past(forargumentsaboutpopulationdensityandterrapretaformation,seeBrowneRibeiro2017;Moraesand Neves 2012:143; Neves 2008:372). 
Theoretical Perspectives 
MajordebatesinAmazonianarchaeologyrevolvearound human populations and their relationshipto the environment (Denevan 1992, 2003; Heck­enberger et al. 1999; Lathrap 1970; McMichael et al. 2012; Meggers 1954, 2001). Early archaeo­logicalresearchsuggestedthatancientAmerindianpopulations had little impact on the Amazonianlandscape. Limiting ecological factors (Meggers1954) resulted in underdeveloped forms of socialorganization and small populations living in iso­lation (e.g., Gross 1975; Meggers 1971).Accord­ing to this perspective,Amazonia was peripheral,even hostile to sociocultural development; whencomplex groups from the north or west migratedtoAmazonia,theywouldhavedevolvedintosim­pler forms (Meggers 1971:36–37, 148).
Other scholars argued that social complexitycould thrive inAmazonia despite limiting factors.Lathrap (1970) proposed that human occupationoffloodplains(várzeas)wouldhaveresultedinanagricultural surplus to support population growthand social complexity. From Amazonia, agricul­tural peoples would have spread outward alongmajor rivers to the circum­Caribbean andAndeanregions (Lathrap 1970). Roosevelt argued for theexistence of social hierarchies in the maize­sup­ported societies of the Orinoco (Roosevelt 1980)and the mound­building chiefdoms of Marajó Is­land (Roosevelt 1991) of earlyAmazonia.
Theseschoolsofthoughtemphasizedenviron­mental limits on cultural development (BrowneRibeiro2011:26–29;Lima2008:14).Morerecentparadigms in Amazonian archaeology, includingHistorical Ecology, consider landscapes and en­vironments toevolvethroughan iterativeprocessof interaction with humans. Anthropogenic fea­turessuchasterrapreta,monumentalearthworks,forestislands,causeways,channels,andfieldsys­tems form anthropogenic landscapes composedof managed forests (Balée 2013; Denevan 2001;Heckenbergeretal. 2003;Oyuela­Caycedo2010;Smith2014a),anthropogenicsoilscapes(Arroyo­Kalin 2008; Browne Ribeiro 2011; Lehmann etal. 2003; Moraes and Lima 2012; Petersen et al. 2001; Schmidt et al. 2014), and networks ofmounds that point to dense settlement, intensivehabitation, or urbanized landscapes (Erickson2010;Hecht2013;Heckenbergeretal. 2008;Ros­tain 2013; Schaan 2004; Walker 2012). This the­oretical shift andthe investigation of new regionscomplement findings from areas such as Marajóand Santarém, which have traditionally shapedthe research corpus for precolumbian Amazonia(e.g., Meggers 1992; Meggers and Evans 1957;Roosevelt 1991; Schaan 2004). For example, themouth of the Amazon River, traditionally a sitefor debates about the development of chiefdoms,is increasingly understood as a zone of cross­cul­tural interaction that encompasses the Guianasand theAmazon Delta (Rostain 2013:91–92)
The region around the mouth of the XinguRiver, a crossroads halfway between Marajó andSantarém, is well positioned to contribute to de­batesonhuman­environmentinteractionsinAma­zonia.Spanning multiple ecologicalfrontiers, theregion is characterized by anthropogenic featureslike terra preta. Part of a pan­Amazonian phe­nomenon, terra preta and a set of stylistic andtechnologicalceramictraitsemergedacrossAma­zonia 2,000 to 3,000 years ago (Gomes 2011;Guapindaia 2011; Lima et al. 2006; Neves 2012; Neves et al. 2014). The spread of terra preta sitesmarks an apparent demographic expansion asso­ciatedwithincreasedsedentismandadistinctwayofinteractingwiththeenvironment(Neves2012).Terra preta occupations present differences thatraise questions about the movement of people,objects, technologies, and information.
Specific activities associated with these an­thropogeniclandscapetransformationsarepoorlyunderstood. Management strategies inAmazoniawere regionally specific, as demonstrated by thevariabilityofdarkearthsintermsoftheirchemicaland physical properties and their relationship toother archaeological and landscape phenomena(Kern 1996; Neves and Petersen 2006; Schmidt

2010; Schmidt et al. 2014; Woods and McCann1999).Inmanyplaces,thepracticesandstructuresthat generated these landscapes are no longer ac­cessible.Ethnoarchaeologicalandethnobotanicalwork among indigenous and traditional popula­tions in Amazonia suggests that some of thesepractices have persisted (e.g., Neves 1998;Schmidt 2010; Schmidt and Heckenberger 2009;Silva2000;Smith2014a;WinklerPrins2009),en­gendering a richer understanding of the relation­ship between practices and signatures—configu­rations of residues, microremains, artifacts, andsediments—on the landscape.
Schmidt et al. (2014:154–161) have identifiedsimilaritiesinlandscapemorphologyinculturallydistinct regions (Central Amazon, Upper XinguRiver, and Trombetas River) that indicate a com­mon process of terra preta formation through ac­cumulation of refuse, including ceramics and or­ganic remains, in middens or areas of habitualdiscard.Structureddepositionnearhouses,publicareas, and trails transformed the soil, leaving dis­cernible traces on the landscape in the form ofmoundedmiddens,producingwhatSchmidtetal. (2014:161) call a middenscape. These patternsmake possible a study of spatial organizationthroughsurfacemorphology.IntheregionaroundtheCentralAmazon,ringedmidden­moundsmea­suring10–20mindiametercorrespondtohouses.In the Upper Xingu River region, ringed moundsmeasure ca. 200 m in diameter and enclose a vil­lagewithacentralplaza(Schmidtetal. 2014:155).Inbothexamples, refusedeposited inareasencir­cling the back of the house form semi­circularmidden­mounds, creating surface features thatcorrespondinsizewiththegroup(e.g.,household,community) that used the demarcated space.Where the community is organized in a circle, asin the Upper Xingu, these mounds coalesce toform one large ring (Schmidt et al. 2014:Figure2a); in the examples where houses are arrangedin rows or in an agglutinative pattern, the semi­circlesmergetoforma “honeycomb” pattern(Fig­ure 4; Schmidt et al. 2014:Figures 6, 7). Thisprocess of terra preta formation through refuseaccumulation provides at least a partial explana­tion for the ubiquity of terra preta in culturallydistinct contexts. This understanding of the for­mation of ring terra preta mounds also provides atestablemodelforimprovingresolutionofstudies ofsitemorphology,landscapeevolution,andterrapretaformationprocessesinrelationtothespatialorganization of human activity. 
Research Design 
Carrazedo was selected as the principal test sitebecause of its potentially continuous history ofhabitation and its favorable preservation condi­tions.Maintainingafocusonhuman­environmentinteractions and settlement structure, the overar­ching research question was framed as a set ofpaired testable hypotheses. At level of the site,the null hypothesis states that precolonial andcolonial­historical settlements have similar inter­nal layouts and orientations toward natural re­sources or landscape features. Articulated at themicro­regional level, the null hypothesis statesthatprecolonialandcolonial­historicalsettlementsshould present similar organizational schemes. Ifsomecolonial­historical settlements occupiedthesame spaces, then their network of settlementswould be superimposed upon an earlier one.
Testing the site­level hypothesis requires reli­able information about settlement organization,including area function (habitation or non­habi­tation),densityofarchitecturalremains,anddepthand characteristics of deposits. For the historicaloccupation, spatial analysis was carriedout usingdocuments (e.g., Schwebel’s drawing ofArapijó,Figure 3a) and oral accounts. For the terra pretaoccupation, we used the middenscapes model ofterra preta formation (Schmidt et al. 2014:161) togenerate a subordinate hypothesis: if the ring­shapedfeaturesontheCarrazedolandsurfacearetheremainsofpairedhouse­and­middenfeatures,excavations should reveal: 
1. Architectural remains such as successive floors and post­mold features at the center ofringed mounds, and
2.Thicker,darkerdeposits,richinorganicandinorganic refuse, consistent with refuse accumu­lation, within mounds.
Testing of the regional hypothesis relied onsettlement frequency and temporal association(precolonial,colonial­historical,orcontemporary)for the territories of Carrazedo, Jocojó, and Gu­rupá­Miri. We compared the spatial distributionof precolonial surface features at these sites. Wealso analyzed the overall layout of precolonial,historical,andcontemporaryhabitationsiteswith

Field Methods and Procedures 
Overview 
The OCA­Gurupá pilot project, which combinedarchaeological, ethnographic and ethnobotanicalfieldwork, took place in June 2014. Data weregathered at three scales. Topographic mappingand subsurface probing were conducted at Car­razedo, followed by excavations in the historicaland precolonial sectors in order to establish rela­tive chronologies and density, depth, and rangeof deposits and remains. Site survey was con­ductedintheCarrazedo,Gurupá­Miri,andJocojóterritories. The terra preta sites Jocojó, Gurupá­Miri, and Jacupi were analyzed for surface mor­phology and orientation.
At Carrazedo, a 10­ha area was mapped witha total station.Anthropogenic landscape features,includingterraces,mounds,middens,pits,andac­cess routes, were interpreted in light of findingsfrom elsewhere in Amazonia (Browne Ribeiro2011; Moraes 2007; Schmidt et al. 2014). In theHistorical Village (Figure 2b), oral traditions andpersonal accounts of Carrazedo guided the map­ping of two historical streets that are annuallycleared and maintained by contemporary inhabi­tants for access to the cemetery. Detailed mapsweremadefromallaccounts;onlylandmarksthatpresentsurfaceremainsweremappedwiththeto­talstation(seeFigure3b).StructureC,arectilinearstructure uncovered during survey, was hypothe­sized to correspond to a 1693 convent reported tobe in ruins ca. 1800 (Baena 2004 [1839]), or pos­sibly a military structure. 
Terrace Complex at Carrazedo 
TheTerraceComplex(Figure2c),whichoverlooksthe Xingu River, had recently received plantingsof manioc (Manihot esculenta), cará (Dioscorea spp.), and watermelon. Surrounding secondaryvegetation exhibited a high density of terra pretaindicator species, including tucumã (Astrocaryum vulgare),ingá(Ingastenoptera),andmucajá(Acro­comia aculeata), that characterize it as a culturalforest (Balée 1989; Smith 2014b). 
Contemporaryuseofnon­mechanizedfarmingin multi­year intervals and oral histories suggestminimal disturbance to this area in recent times. This was corroborated by the apparent integrityofsurfacefeatures,suchasringedmoundsaroundflat terrace­like areas. These were interconnected via elongated depressions thought to correspondto paths (see Schmidt et al. 2014). According tooursubordinate hypothesis, we expected a higherfrequency of artifacts and darker soil in moundcontexts;intheflat areas,weexpected tofind ev­idenceforhousefloorsorstructureswithminimal artifact deposition.
Catch­and­release(ModzelewskiandGonzalez2007:24) surface collection was conducted in 10­x­10­m quadrants (Figure 4). Artifacts wereflagged and photographed in situ, collected, clas­sified, recorded, and returned to their originalquadrant. Historical material was subdivided asfollows: glass, whitewares, stonewares, earthen­wares, and construction ceramics. Precolonialearthenwares were separated by body part (base,body, rim) and into plain and decorated sherds.
TheTerraceComplexwasmappedwithatotalstation.Shoveltestingwasexecutedusingtheex­isting grid with a 1­m long 20­cm­diameter post­holedigger, anefficient low­impact tool that pro­vides systematic data on soil characteristics andartifact distribution (Lima 2008). Shovel test pits(STP) were excavated in 20­cm levels and ana­lyzedforcolor,texture,composition,andnumberof artifacts, which were collected along with a 1­liter bulk sample.
Seven terraces were defined (Figure 4; Sup­plemental Figure 1) by correlating topographicwith STP and surface collection data. Flat areas revealed negligible amounts of ceramic material,moderatedegreesofdarkening,andshalloweran­thropogenic deposits. Areas that formed part ofring or horseshoe­shaped mounds showed higherfrequencies of artifacts and thicker deposits ofdark brown or black anthropogenic earth (Tables1 and 2; Supplemental Figure 1). These resultscorroboratethehypothesisthatthearearepresentsthe remains of a complex of paired house­and­midden features.

Figure 5. Stratigraphic profiles from Terrace Complex excavations in the center of Terrace 2 (unit N490 E570) and on
the mound (N490 E598–599). 
SurfacecollectionsintheTerraceComplexre­vealed a mix of precolonial, historical, and con­temporary artifacts that demonstrate the use ofareas beyond the boundaries of the Historical­pe­riod village. Hand­tilled cultivation resulted innear­surface artifact mixing. Historical artifacts,prevalentonthe surface,werefound toa depthof30 cm in excavations. Beyond this depth, onlyprecolonial ceramics were encountered.
The 1­x­2­m unit excavated on the mound (N490 E598–599, Figure 5) reached a depth of170 cm. The midden layers (VI, V, and IV) arecomposed of dark, friable­to­loose sand or sandyclay. Colors range from Munsell black (10 YR2/1) to very dark brown (10 YR 2/2), and thequantity of ceramic fragments is substantiallyhigherintheselayersthaninunderlyingcontexts.Layer III, a very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2)compact loamy clay, resembles early house de­posits found elsewhere (e.g., Browne Ribeiro2011, 2014; Moraes 2007). The fairly sharp tran­sition between Layers III and II may indicate theearliest land surface. The gradual transition be­tween Layers II and I indicates pedogenic hori­zons, where Layer II is the transitional or A/BHorizon, and Layer I is the uppermost B Horizon (Figure5).TheseHorizonsareclay­rich,compactmatrices mottled in color, ranging from darkbrown (10 YR 3/3, predominant in Layer II) toyellowish brown (10 YR 5/6, predominant inLayer I). The majority of material remains werehighlyfragmented,disorganized,andconcentratedin Layers IV–VI. This, along with a lack of fea­tures, structures, or evidence for in situ fragmen­tation, supports the midden hypothesis.

the mound unit. These are mottled in color, rang­ing from dark brown (10YR 3/3, predominant inLayer II) to yellowish brown (10 YR 5/6, pre­dominant in Layer I). A total of six dark, 20–25cm circular features found in Layer II were inter­preted as post­molds. They contained charcoal,ceramic, and baked clay fragments. The featurescut through the underlying A/B and B Horizons(LayersII and I in Figure5,showninplan inFig­ure 6), but their upper limits were not discerniblebecause of brown­on­brown soils. 
Precolonial ceramics were recovered almost exclusively from the mound excavation. Techno­logical­stylistic analyses of the ceramic assem­blage(Lima2008)revealedthepresenceofhighlyfragmented vessels, anthropo­zoomorphic ap­pliqués, and beads. Vessels were coil­made, withsurface colors ranging from reddish­orange towhite. Mineral inclusions (sand or crushed rock)caused rough surface textures and coarse fabrics.Cauixi (Demospongiae, Drulia spp.) (Natalio et al. 2015), caraipé (ashes and fibers from a tree bark, Licania spp.), grog, hematite, charcoal, andshell temper, in no particular combination or pro­portion, were also noted across the assemblages.
By grouping decorative techniques found onceramicvessels,weestablishedapreliminarystyl­istic ceramic characterization and contextualiza­tion for the Xingu­Amazon confluence within aregional scope.Type 1 features white slip and cutlobed rims or flanges, with occasional red paint(Figure 7a–f). It resembles open, “flower­like”vessels found in Almeirim, (Barreto and Nasci­mento2016:278;LimaandFernandes2016:215–216), Altamira (Müller et al. 2016:206), Amapá(Cabral 2011:96), and the Guianas (Rostain2009:47–50;vandenBel2010:84).Type2,whichalsohascorrelatesintheaboveregions,combinesfine­lineincisionwithsmallroundappliqué “but­tons” thatfeaturepunctuateorungulatedecoration(Figure7g–j).Theseplasticdecorativetechniquesoften depict anthropomorphic or zoomorphic fig­ures on wall and rim sherds of medium or small­sized (< 30 cm diameter) restricted vessels.

In addition toassorted, fragmented metal artifacts and plasterreligious icons, a range of glassware was found,chiefly insurface scatters,includingfragmentsofmedicinal flasks and vials and blue, opalescent,green,brown,andclearbottleglass.Thediversityof material remains demonstrates the range of in­fluences at this crossroads and the potential forhistorical material culture studies in the Xingu­Amazon confluence region.

This pattern echoes someof the contours observed in the HistoricalVillageat Carrazedo; due to significant post­contact dis­turbances, further analysis of this area is needed.

Discussion 
Multi­scalar spatial data gathered about internalsettlement organization and micro­regional set­tlementpatternspermittedtestingofthehypothesisthat precolonial settlement spatial organizationdiffered from later periods. Site location and soilsurface data gathered in the Carrazedo, Jocojó,and Gurupá­Miri territories show a higher fre­quency of precolonial terra preta sites than colo­nial­historicalsettlements.Settlementsassociated withthetwoperiodsdonotfollowthesamespatialdistribution,allowingustorejectthenullhypoth­esis on the micro­regional level.
At Carrazedo, the size of the terra preta siteandthedensityofanthropogenicsurfacefeatures,artifacts, and indicator plant species point to adensely occupied settlement. Results from inves­tigationsin theTerrace Complex support the sub­ordinatehypothesisofacomplexofhouseterracesseparated by midden­mounds.Artifact density inmoundcontexts issignificantlyhigher than in theterrace.The higher compaction and lighter color­ing of soils in the flat areas, attested to by datafrom excavation units and STPs, along with thefrequency of post­mold features, further indicatethe presence of multiple houses in this terrace.Thus, we can interpret the Terrace Complex as aneighborhoodthatconsistsofatleastsevenhousesarrangedinanagglutinativeor “honeycomb” (e.g., Schmidt et al. 2014:Figure 7) pattern. Oral histo­ries and archaeological data indicate that this wasprimarily an agricultural zone in historical times.Precolonial Carrazedo was either significantly bigger than the historical town, or had a distinctorientationthatprioritizedthisareaforhabitation.The major access routes (Figure 4) that connecttheTerraceComplextothefloodplainalsosuggestheavy foot traffic at this part of the site. The dif­ferent spatial plans of the Amerindian and Euro­Brazilian settlements force us to reject the nullhypothesis at the site level.
Excavationresultsfromthissectoralsosuggestthat the middenscapes model of terra preta for­mation (Schmidt et al. 2014) holds true for Car­razedo. The “honeycomb” neighborhood layoutwas also observed at Gurupá­Miri and Jacupi, in­dicating similarities between the Lower XinguRiver and the Lower and Central Amazon River regions. This similarity in neighborhood layoutacross regions is significant because, as Erickson(2003:466–476)hasshown,predictingsettlementorganization from the shape of a terra preta staincan be extremely difficult. Decisions about thesize, shape, and spatial interrelationships of habi­tations, decisions about appropriate garbage dis­posal, and house shifting or migration can affectthe form and layout of site, so that the morpho­logical and functional similarities among sitesranging from the Xingu­Amazon confluence totheCentralAmazon,spanningover1,000km,areremarkable. 
Given the myriad scenarios proposed by Er­ickson (2003:Figures 4–8), the presence of clearsurfacefeaturesisworthnoting.Itspeaksdirectlyto the debate about terra preta sites as sites ofcontinuous (stable occupation) or repeated (un­stableoccupation)use(seeLathrap1970;Meggers

1971, 1990; Roosevelt 1991). Even a slight shiftin house site would have resulted in a shifting ofmounds, erasing or failing to form the ringedmound structures still present on the landscapetoday. Thus, the observed complex of house ter­races at Carrazedo is in itself evidence of contin­uous habitation. These are stable house sites, andthere appears to be deliberate preservation of theculturally informed designations of domestic andancillary space.
Studies of surface morphology thus have in­terpretive potential. Preliminary observations atJocojóyieldedsomefeaturessimilartothoseseenin the Terrace Complex at Carrazedo, but the cir­cular features seem larger and are interspersedwith large linear mounds in several orientations.The overall linear layout of the settlement echoesthegeneralmorphologicalaspectoftheHistoricalVillagesectoratCarrazedo.Theapparentlinearityofsettlementsisprobablylesssignificantthanthedifferentiation of feature types. A settlement thatdevelops initially or preferentially along the edgeof a bluff may eventually grow into a square, rec­tangular,orroundedshape.ResearchintheCentralAmazon and Urubu River Basins shows that ag­glutinatedhousecomplexesliketheTerraceCom­plexatCarrazedotendtobemostdevelopedalongbluff edges (Lima 2013:43; Schmidt et al. 2014:157–158). Distinct configurations of fea­tures, however, may correspond to different setsof activities, types of settlements, or cultural ortemporal parameters. If future research bears outpatterns thus far observed, Jocojó might be keyto unraveling more complex areas like the His­torical Village at Carrazedo. Unlike Carrazedo,Jocojó has no associated or material evidence foranearlycolonialtown;surfacemorphologyatJo­cojó may more reliably represent a precolonialsettlement. 
Alternatively,Jocojómaypresentadistinctor­ganizational plan because its inland setting, awayfromprincipalriverinechannels,wouldhavebeenappropriate for different activities. The layout offeatures, including mounds, paths, platforms,ditches, and ramps, in relation to each other andto natural resources or physiographical featurescan shed light on settlement logic and function. Itmayalsorevealnewinformationabouthabitationand land­use patterns, site function or hierarchy,cultural affiliation, and exchange. 
Erickson’s(2003)scenariosforterrapretastainformation and the working middenscapes model providedbySchmidtetal. (2014)present parame­ters for further studying surface mound and ditchfeatures. Along with more extensive excavations,analysisofchemicalsignatures,microremains,andmicromorphology can be applied toward locatingandcharacterizinguse­surfaces,identifyingactivityareas, and tracking continuity or hiatuses in occu­pation(Arroyo­Kalin2008;BrowneRibeiro2014,2017;Schmidt2010).Determiningcontemporane­ityof earthenmoundsfromtheHistorical andTer­race Sectors via radiocarbon dating and additionalfieldwork is also essential to understanding the re­lationship between these sectors of Carrazedo andsites from greater Gurupá.
Overall data suggest that all four sites mappedin the municipality of Gurupá share aspects ofdomestic structure and terra preta formationprocesses with those reported in the Trombetasand CentralAmazon River Basins (Schmidt et al.2014:158–160). Interestingly, ceramic data linksthe terra preta occupation at Carrazedo withAmapáandtheGuianas,totheNorth,alsoplacingit within the Koriabo window (A.D. 1200–1600).Rostain, examining regional chronologies for theKoriabo complex that suggest an inland­coastaltemporal progression, proposes that it “may haveemerged in the middle Amazon or even in thecenter of the Guyana shield” (2009:47). Extrapo­lating from this pattern, Koriabo­like ceramicsfrom the Lower Xingu River region likely date to~A.D.1200orslightlyearlier;thisresonateswithdata that place the majority of terra preta produc­tionaroundA.D.1100(Moraes2010:598;Moraesand Neves 2012:133).
Fieldwork in the Historical Village sector ofCarrazedo raised interesting questions about theuse of space throughout the history of the site.Participatory mapping of the twentieth­centuryvillage helped to differentiate, to an extent, be­tween recent­historical and older structures. The difficulty in understanding this palimpsest lies inthe sparse nature of historical documentation andin its inherent complexity as a place that was re­occupiedorresignifiedmultipletimes.Keytoun­derstanding this recent and deep history is unrav­eling the construction sequence for terraces andbuildings in this sector.Ascertaining whether thepresent terraces are reutilized or enhanced pre­

colonial terraces will inform questions of Euro­peanmaneuveringofprestigeand “landesquecap­ital” inexistingsettlements(HakånssonandWid­gren 2014:9–30).
The range of material culture recorded, themultiple reconstructions of historical structures,andtherepurposingofprecolonialanthrosolsandartifacts in later construction substantiate the lore of former grandeur that accompanies Carrazedo.Giventhesimilarhistoryofboom­and­bustcyclesassociated with an extractive economy of the cityof Gurapá, the greater Gurupá area can be under­stood as a former colonial­historical frontier.Ar­tifacts recovered at the Fort of St. Anthony in aparallel study (Marques et al. 2014) include blue­and­white beads, painted whitewares, assortedmetal artifacts, lithic flakes, and slipped andpainted earthenwares that complement data fromthe Historical Village in Carrazedo. Such findsmay be material correlates for early­contact tradenarratives and for the role of the mouth of the Xingu River as an important colonial­historicaleconomic hub. 


Conclusions 
This archaeological pilot project contributes sig­nificant insights about the history of the Xingu­Amazon Rivers confluence and addresses our re­search question regarding settlement spatialorganization in the precolonial and colonial­his­torical periods. We gathered multi­scalar dataaboutsettlementpatterns,habitationloci,andland­scape use, including ethnobotanical and geomor­phicdata.Althoughthedistributionofprecolonialsettlements overlaps with colonial­historical andcontemporary settlements, the formeroccurred ata higher frequency and covered a wider range ofecological zones. This is apparent at the site andmicro­regional level. Every contemporary andhistorical habitation site overlies a terra preta siteof largerextent.At Carrazedo, the habitation areaassociated with the Historical Village measures~6 ha, while the terra preta site measures ~30 ha. Although terra preta in itself signifies intensiveuse, it was necessary to determine whether theentire area was contemporaneously occupied.
Archaeological remains pertaining to both thehistorical and precolonial occupations of Car­razedo are well preserved. Carrazedo as a twenti­eth­century city presents typical European orga­nizational features and mirrors Schwebel’s 1755 engraving,suggestingsomestabilityorcontinuityin the recent history of the settlement. The pres­ence of imported whitewares and non­local con­struction materials substantiates oral claims that Carrazedo was actively involved in modern mar­kets that spanned the Amazon Delta and beyondaround1900.ExcavationsintheHistoricalVillageshowmultiplephasesofarchitecturalconstruction,someofwhicharenotreflectedinrecentmemory.This makes sense, given that rubber­boom townsby and large experienced periods of depressedpopulation and infrastructure, which would haveaffectedlocalmemory.Publicandelitestructures,whichsitonelevatedground,mayhavebeenbuilton precolonial terraces. Evidence pertaining tothe colonial townArapijó has not yet been found,butthepreservationofhistoricalremainsanddoc­umentary sources suggest that these remains lieburied beneath more recent structures. 
Site survey in three territories revealed eightpreviously unrecorded sites, all but one of whichpresent evidence of intensive precolonial habita­tion in the form of terra preta. Over the course ofless than a week, the number of sites in the terri­tories studied almost tripled, demonstrating thatmany precolonial sites remain unrecorded. Theregion was intensively occupied during the pre­colonialperiod,andtheseoccupationsleftamoresignificant imprint on the landscape than theircolonial­historicalcounterparts.Atmultiplesites,the spatial forms that attest to permanence ofhouse sites also connectAmerindian populationsfrom the mouth of the Xingu River with thosefrom the Lower and MiddleAmazon.

This new finding could alsoshed light on the geographic and chronologicalfrontiersthatseparatetheSantarémandtheMara­joara cultures.

The story that emerges about Euro­BrazilianGurupá is somewhat different. Carrazedo exem­plifiesthecolonialfrontierzone,whichprosperedmomentarily during resource booms, but nevergrew into an urban hub. Data uncovered abouttwentieth­century Carrazedo allows us to stringtogether a story that mirrors that of Gurupá. Ifpost­warGurupáexemplifiedAmazonianrurality(Wagley 1953), itsAmerindian equivalent can beconsidered significantly more urbanized—moredensely populated, more intensively inhabited,and more economically, socially, and politicallyintegrated. If this emerging pattern holds, ques­tions about how to successfully integrate largepopulations into a lowland wet tropical environ­ment become ever more intriguing, especially inthefaceofthegeneralizedpopulationdeclinewit­nessedthroughoutthecolonial­historicalera.Ourinitial results from archaeological investigationsin the Lower Xingu River region indicate the po­tentialanswersthisareaholdsforaddressingthesequestions.
