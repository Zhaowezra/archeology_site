AT THE CROSSROADS: STARCH GRAIN 
AND PHYTOLITH ANALYSES IN LUCAYAN PREHISTORY 

Mary Jane Berman and Deborah M. Pearsall 
Starch and phytolith analyses of an assemblage of chert microliths from the Three Dog site, an early Lucayan settlement on San Salvador, Bahamas, yielded Zea mays, Capsicum, and possible manioc indicating that these domesticates were present by at least A.D. 800 or earlier in Cuba or Hispaniola and brought to the central Bahamas during its early peopling. The presence of corn at this site contradicts previously held ideas that it did not appear in the Bahamas until the A.D. 1200s. Starch granules tentatively identified as root/tuber starch were also found on the microliths, although we were unable to discern if these represent wild species and/or culturally transported wild or domesticated species. The presence of more than one species on the microliths, initially believed to have been manioc grater chips similar to those documented ethno­graphically, demonstrates multifunctional use. A broad-based plant diet that included maize and root/tuber crops was in place at least by the Archaic age in parts of the Greater Antilles and brought to the Bahamas, along with chi/is, during its colonization by Ceramic age peoples. 
El andlisis de almid6n y .fitolitos realizado en un conjunto de microUtos de chert procedentes del sitio lucayo temprano de Three Dog, San Salvador, Bahamas evidencia restos de Zea mays, Capsicum, y una posible celula secretora de yuca, indicando su presencia ya domesticada en Cuba o La Hispaniola desde el 800 d. C. o antes; y que fueron transportados al centro de las Bahamas durante su poblamiento temprano. La presencia de maiz contradice ideas previas de que su aparici6n en Bahamas no sucede hasta el 1200 d.C. Evidencia provisional de granos de almid6n-quizds raiz o tuberculo-tambienfue encontrada en los microlitos. Desafortunadamente no es posible discernir si representan especies salvajes endemicas y/o salvajes o domes­ticadas transportadas culturalmente. La presencia de mds de una especie en estas microlascas tradicionalmente asociadas a ralladores a rayadores de yuca, demuestra su uso multifuncional. Una dieta en base al uso vegetales mas amplia que incluye el maiz y raices/tuberculos ya se encontraba en el Arcaico en partes de las Antillas Mayo res y lleg6 a Bahamas, }unto con los pimientos con la colonizaci6n efectuadas por poblaciones en momentos cerdmicos.

In this study we extend the model to the central Bahamas, as part of our long-term investigations of how its early colonizers transferred cultural prac­tices, including plant knowledge, food preparation techniques, and cuisine, from ancestral homelands in northern Cuba and/or northern Hispaniola (Berman and Gnivecki 1995; Keegan 1992) and applied them to new settings. The Bahamas is an ideal area to explore these questions because there are numerous environmental dissimilarities between the Bahamas archipelago and Cuba and Hispaniola that would have posed significant chal­lenges to the colonization and management of a new physical and biotic landscape (Berman et al. 1999; Newsom and Wing 2004 ). These differences include the lack of naturally occurring freshwater sources such as springs, streams, or rivers; less annual rainfall; a carbonate geological environ­ment; little topographic relief; inadequately devel­oped, nutritionally deficient carbonate soils; small island size; depauperate terrestrial fauna; and the absence of naturally occurring high-quality lithic materials (Sealey 1994 ). This contrasts with the varied and complex geology and environment of Cuba and Hispaniola and makes the current poten­tial productivity of the Bahamas poorer (Newsom and Wing 2004: 172), which we suspect was the case prehistorically. Because the paleoethnob­otanical and zooarchaeological records of Cuba and Hispaniola are insufficiently known, research in the Bahamas can also help us infer which resources must have been present and exploited by the prehistoric inhabitants of these larger islands during this period. Furthermore, the picture of plant introductions is vaguely known for the Bahamas because macrobotanical and microbotanical remains have failed, prior to the research reported here, to yield unequivocal evidence of domesti­cated plants (Berman and Pearsall 2000). Through the study of artifacts, paleoethnobotanical, and zooarchaeological remains (Berman et al. 1999; Berman 1992, 1994; Berman and Pearsall 2000), we are researching the ways in which the people who established permanent settlements in the cen­tral Bahamas applied environmental and techno­logical knowledge and social and cultural practices (Bourdieu 1977) from their homelands to construct familiar natural (i.e., biological) and cultural envi­ronments. We are also examining how, in attempt­ing to reproduce the lifeways of the motherland, 
prehistoric occupants created technological inno­vations designed to respond to their new physical, biological, and social contexts (Berman 2005; Hoff­man 1970). Finally, we hope to contribute to a growing body of knowledge constituting island archaeology (e.g., Broodbank 2000; Fitzpatrick 2004). 
By the time of European contact, the people of the Antilles cultivated plants that included root and tuber, seed, and fruit and vegetable domesticates whose origins lay in Mexico, Central America, and South America (Cooke and Pipemo 1993; Newsom 1993; Newsom and Pearsall 2003; Newsom and Wing 2004; Sauer 1966; Sturtevant 1969). These plants consisted of manioc (Manihot esculenta), sweet potatoes (Jpomoea batatas ), yautfa (Xan­thosoma sp.), arrowroot (Maranta arundinacea), lleren ( Calathea allouia ), com (Zea mays), varieties of peppers (Capsicum spp. ), avocado (Persea amer­icana), guava (Psidium guajava), papaya (Carica papaya), soursop (Annona spp.), jack bean (Canavalia sp.), peanut (Arachis hypogaea), squash ( Cucurbita spp. ), pineapple (Ananas como­sus), and common and lima beans (Phaseolus vul­garia, P. lunatus). Most of these plants have been recovered archaeologically (Newsom 1993, 2008; Pagan Jimenez et al. 2005; Pagan Jimenez and Oliver 2008; Rodriguez Suarez and Pagan Jimenez 2008), but questions related to their full geographic distribution, dates of entry, routes of entry, orders of entry, and whether they were brought singly or as parts of "packages" (sensu Broodbank 2000) into the islands remain poorly understood. New­som and Pearsall (2003:401) suggest these crops were not "transported wholesale" and that migrat­ing populations selected only certain plants to prop­agate in new settings. Evidence for the exploration and limited use of the Turks and Caicos before the establishment of permanent settlements (Berman and Gnivecki 1995; Carlson 1999; Keegan 2007; Sears and Sullivan 1978; Sinelli 2001) suggests the people who colonized the southern islands were familiar with their unique, arid environments before permanently settling there. Similarly, the islands of the central Bahamas may have been explored before their permanent settlement (Berman and Gnivecki 1995). The prior knowledge of the grow­ing conditions, which differed from the colonizers' points of origin, may have conditioned what they brought to their new homes. Thus, early coloniz-

ers may have brought only certain crops and crop dispersal may have occurred selectively and not in "packages" as people expanded into different islands. This offers a contrasting scenario with the eastern Pacific, where the early colonization of the Fiji, Samoa, and Tonga group was not preceded by exploratory visits, due to the vast distance of the Vanuatu-Fiji water gap (Kirch 1988). Because the resource base of these islands was unknown, it is believed that people brought a large repertoire of plants and animals as a form of "insurance" guar­anteeing that they would be able to support them­selves in their new environment. 

For almost 20 years archaeologists have hypoth­esized that Caribbean Archaic societies grew domesticates (Davis 1988), but macrobotanical evi­dence has failed to substantiate this claim. Recent discoveries, made possible through starch grain analysis of ground stone artifacts from two sites in Puerto Rico, Maruca (1295-395 B.C.) and Puerto Ferro (700 B.C.), have provided evidence for domesticated maize, manioc, beans, sweet potato, and yautfa (Pagan Jimenez 2005; Pagan Jimenez et al. 2005). These and other studies now affirm the potential of starch grain analysis for Caribbean studies suggested earlier by the work of Berman and Pearsall (2000). The Bahamas were the last Caribbean islands to be colonized by humans and it is expected that domesticates would have been brought by the people who settled them. Previous research, focused on macrobotanical recovery, failed to find evidence for domesticated plants at sites in the Turks and Caicos (Newsom and Pearsall 2003; Newsom and Wing 2004) or at the Three Dog site, San Salvador island in the central Bahamas (Berman and Pearsall 2000). We therefore turned to starch grain and phytolith analyses to obtain these remains, because microfossil recovery has proved to be a useful means of establishing plant use in Neotropical contexts in Central America (Dickau 2005; Piperno and Holst 1998; Piperno et al. 2000), South America (Chandler-Ezell et al. 2006; Pearsall et al. 2004; Perry 2001, 2002, 2004, 2005; Perry et al. 2007), and other portions of the Caribbean (Cuba and Puerto Rico) (Pagan Jimenez 2005; Pagan Jimenez and Oliver 2008; Pagan Jimenez et al. 2005; Rodriguez Suarez and Pagan Jimenez 2006, 2008; Siegel et al. 2005). 
Recent work in the Middle Orinoco region of Venezuela (Perry 2001, 2002, 2004, 2005) has revealed the presence of starch grains in the fissures, crevices, and holes of stone tools resembling ethno­graphically documented manioc grater chips. In this study, we examine the bipolar flakes and shat­ter that constitute the Three Dog site microlith assemblage for both starch grains and phytoliths. These flakes, which also resemble ethnographi­cally recorded manioc grater board chips (Berman et al. 1999), are manufactured from a white fossil­iferous chert whose nearest source is located over 300 km away in Cuba and Hispaniola (Berman et al. 1999). In our earlier study (Berman et al. 1999; Berman and Pearsall 2000), we found starch grain evidence of cf. Xanthosoma sp. (yautia) or cf. 7.amia sp. on two microliths. We hypothesized that 7.amia sp., which Newsom and Wing (2004:183) suggest may have been the primary source of starch in the Bahamas, would be confirmed on more microliths. Similarly we expected to find other instances of Xanthosoma sp. and possibly other root crops known to be prepared by grating. Because manioc is believed to have been a ubiqui­tous dietary mainstay of island Caribbean popula­tions (Sturtevant 1969), the staple of post-Saladoid populations (Rouse 1992), and because of its great antiquity (starch grains have been found on Archaic period artifacts from Puerto Rico [Pagan Jimenez et al. 2005)), we anticipated that manioc would be recovered from the microlith assemblage. Finally, we expected to observe palm or grass residue. Palms and grasses have been reported widely from Caribbean paleoethnobotanical assemblages (Newsom 1993; Newsom and Pearsall 2003; Newsom and Wing 2004) and have been found on the microliths from Barrancoid and Arauquinoid sites in the Orinoco region (Perry 2001, 2002, 2004, 2005) and on stone tools from Panama (Dickau 2005). 
Bamforth (1986) and Morrow and Jefferies (1989) have shown that tools made from nonlocal materials tend to be used for a wider range of func­tions than those manufactured from local materi­als. In a previous study, Berman et al. (1999) hypothesized that the tools from the Three Dog site, made from scarce, nonlocal materials, were used for multiple purposes. Here, we extend the argument to infer that the microliths would have been used to process a variety of plants. We sug­gest that the use of one tool to process numerous plants is a form of "scarcity-induced economizing behavior," a term coined by Odell (1996:75) to

describe the multiple uses of stone tools in situa­tions of raw material scarcity. We believe that the site's prehistoric occupants, faced with a lack of high-quality materials for their grater chips, made maximal use through the processing of a range of plants. Colonization of a new land may have required different strategies of tool use, including the conservation of rare materials, in the attempt to continue and reproduce homeland plant process­ing and consumption practices. 
The Three Dog Site 
The colonization of the Bahamas archipelago was part of a generalized fast-paced, near-simultaneous movement of peoples from Hispaniola and Cuba into the Bahamas in the A.D. 700s. The Turks and Caicos, in the dry tropical zone of the southern part of the Bahamas archipelago, were first settled ca. 
A.D. 
750 by Ostionoid peoples who originated in northern Hispaniola (Carlson 1999; Carlson and Keegan 2004 ). A second wave of people, who also established outpost colonies in the Turks and Caicos during the eleventh and twelfth centuries, is attrib­uted to an influx ofMeillacan Ostionoid/Meillacoid (sensu Keegan 2004) peoples from northern His­paniola (Carlson and Keegan 2004; Sinelli 2001: 142-143 ). The moist tropical zone of the cen­tral Bahamas was settled permanently during the 

A.D. 
700-800s from northern Cuba or northern Hispaniola (Berman and Gnivecki 1995; Carr et al. 2006:55, 81; Keegan 1992; Sinelli 2001:142); col­onizers made their way up the island chain as part of a rapid expansion. By A.D. 900, New Provi­dence, occupying the moist subtropical zone of the northern Bahamas, was settled (Bohon 1999). 


The Three Dog site (Figure 1) is the earliest sys­tematically excavated open air site in the Com­monwealth of the Bahamas. Its radiocarbon dates, which range from the late cal A.D. 600s/700-900 (Berman and Gnivecki 1995:430), overlap with a well-dated human skeleton from Preacher's Cave, Eleuthera, a burial cave site that dates to A.D. 700-980 (Carr et al. 2006). Sitting atop a dune ridge adjoining Sugar Loaf Bay on the western side of San Salvador Island, the Three Dog site consists of a midden, two activity areas, and a low density (well-swept) area. Local and nonlocal ceramics, shell beads and bead debitage, chert microliths, a grinding stone fragment, coral artifacts and deb­

itage, shell hammers, scrapers, adzes, picks, and waste, a limestone hoe, limestone flakes, shell and stone pendants and an associated toolkit, pale­oethnobotanical, and zooarchaeological remains have been recovered. Bead and ceramic vessel pro­duction, the manufacture of stone and shell fig­urines, food preparation, cooking, meal consumption, sweeping, possible woodworking, and waste disposal took place here. Evidence of off­site activities such as field preparation (hoeing and tree-cutting), fishing, and shellfish collection was present as well. The site appears to represent the material remains of one household, probably com­posed of an extended or joint family. There is no material evidence of social differentiation other than gender and age, although the latter is not read­ily discernible. 
The Microlith Assemblage 
The chert assemblage, which consists of 58 microliths manufactured through bipolar produc­tion, was distributed throughout the site with nearly equal concentrations in the midden in the north­ernmost portion and in a food preparation area in the southernmost part. The microliths range from 
4.04 to 37.79 mm long (mean of 11 mm), 3.56 to 
18.77 mm wide (mean of 6.98 mm) and 1.45 to 
10.54 mm thick (mean of 3.52 mm) and resemble grater chips from ethnographically observed man­ioc grater boards (Berman et al. 1999). Traces of a dark, sticky adhesive suggest the microliths were inserted into a grater board (Berman et al. 1999; Rostain 1997; Roth 1924; Sievert 1992a, 1992b; Y de 1965). Furthermore, 43 percent of the assem­blage (N = 25) exhibited crushing, which experi­mental studies have attributed to bipolar manufacture or insertion into a grater board, not use (Berman et al. 1999; Sievert 1992a; Walker 1980). High-power (50 X-200 X) microwear analysis pro­vided little or no evidence of function due to the degraded nature of the chert, so we examined a small sample with a scanning electronic micro­scope for phytoliths to determine if the artifacts were used for plant processing (Berman et al. 1999; Berman and Pearsall 2000). No identifiable phy­toliths were detected, but two small spheroidal bod­ies, identified as possible Xanthosoma sp. or 'Zamia sp. starch grains, were observed on the working edges and crevices of two of the tools.

Because of the discovery of starch residues on the microliths during the SEM analysis, we decided to conduct a larger, systematic examination of a sample of the assemblage to search for identifiable phytoliths and starch grains. This was carried out by project paleoethnobotanist Deborah M. Pearsall. The study goal was to identify if there was greater evidence for plant use, and if so, which species were present, and whether they were part of "trans­ported" landscapes or represented localized adap­tations to the Bahamian environment. Furthermore, we wanted to see if the artifacts believed to be man­ioc grater chips were really used prehistorically to process manioc: 
Starch Grain and Phytolith Study 
Starch Grain and Phytolith Recovery 
Pearsall analyzed 28 microliths; 15 produced evi­dence of residues. Nine microliths with residues are pictured in Figure 2. The starch grains and phy­toliths were recovered and identified using meth­ods developed during the Real Alto site, Ecuador, tool residue study (Chandler-Ezell and Pearsall 2003; Chandler-Ezell et al. 2006; Pearsall et al. 2004). This approach, known as "piggyback" microfossil processing, allows for both starch and phytolith sampling from stone tools, while mini­mizing potential damage to more delicate starch remains. Briefly, each tool was scrubbed with cool distilled water and a new toothbrush. The aqueous sediment, referred to as Sediment 2 (wet brushed sediment), was retained. (If the tools had been unwashed, they would have been dry-brushed as a first step and referred to as Sediment I.) The tool was then placed in a disposable plastic container. Cool distilled water was added to cover the arti­fact. The container was placed in an ultrasonic bath for five minutes; upon removal, the aqueous sedi­ment, known as Sediment 3, sonicated sediment, was retained. For the first 11 tools, Sediments 2 and

3 were processed separately, as described below. When initial scanning revealed scant residues, wet 
brushed and sonicated sediments from subsequent tools were combined into a single sample for pro­cessing and scanning. Samples were dispersed and defiocculated by shaking in water and .1 percent NaEDTA, then each was split ihto a starch and phy­tolith subsample. Starch subsamples were quite clean and not processed further. Starch residues were stored in distilled water. Phytolith subsamples were processed to remove carbonates and organic matter; then phytoliths were floated from the sam­ple using Zinc iodide heavy liquid. Phytolith extracts were stored dry. 
Starch extracts were slide-mounted in glycerol and distilled water and examined using a Zeiss research microscope at 250X-400X magnifica­tion. Starch was identified by the distinctive extinc­tion cross produced under cross-polar light. Each starch granule was described and photographed. 
Identifications were made using the University of Missouri lab comparative collection, published sources (e.g., Dickau 2005; Pagan Jimenez et al. 2005; Perry 200 I; Pipemo and Holst 1998; Riechert 1913), and consultation with colleagues. Phytolith extracts were slide mounted in Canada balsam and examined using a Nikon research microscope at 400X magnification. Phytoliths were identified using the University of Missouri comparative col­lection. 
Starch and Phytolith Results 
Results are summarized in Tables I, 2, and 3. This investigation, including the previous one (Berman and Pearsall 2000), revealed that starch granules were present on 14 artifacts: seven from the mid· den, two from the multipurpose activity area, one from a low density area, and four from an area in the southern part of the site that contained a high density of microliths (Table 4).

starch grains were identified on four microliths; two were present on one tool (Figure 3a, b, d, f, i). Four starch grains, tentatively identified as maize (the grains could not be rolled), were observed on four microliths (Figure 3c, e, g, h). A large granule resembling root/tuber starch was found on one stone tool (Figure 4e, f), and three smaller granules that may also be root/tuber starch were observed on two microliths (Figure 4a-<l). Two grains iden­tified as domesticated chile, Capsicum spp. were also recovered (Figure 5a-<l). Finally, three tools preserved possible damaged starch that cannot be identified further. 
A number of investigators (Pearsall et al. 2004; Perry 2001; Pipemo 2006; Pipemo and Holst 1998; Pipemo et al. 2000; Reichert 1913) have described starch produced in the kernels (seeds) of maize. Maize granules were identified using these sources, as well as the University of Missouri starch grain collection. Identifications were confirmed by Dolores Pipemo and Linda Perry (personal com­munication to Pearsall, April 2005). The tentatively identified maize grains (cf. Zea mays) possess the diagnostic characteristics of maize, but could not be rotated on the slide to confirm their three­dimensional morphology. 
At least two maize races, a popcorn and a floury­endosperm grain, dating to A.D. 1350 ± 70, were found at En Bas Saline in Haiti (Newsom 1993, 2008; Newsom and Deagan 1994), indicating that by the mid-fourteenth century, these and possibly other varieties of maize were grown in the Caribbean. Oviedo noted two types of maize, one that matured at three months, another at four (New­som 2008: 176). Morphological features required to make definitive statements about the kinds of maize at the Three Dog site are lacking, however. Both smooth grains, common in soft endosperm maize varieties (flour, sweet com), and grains show­ing compression facets (angled grains), common in hard endosperm varieties (popcorn, flint com) (Perry 2001), are present. No large smooth grains or "bumpy" grains typical of some flour varieties were recovered, however. Grain size varies from 7-20 µm, with an average of 12.4 µm (n = 9). This falls in the range of other published reports of maize (Pearsall et al. 2004; Piperno and Holst 1998). While the smallest granules (7-8 µm) overlap in size with some wild grass starch, all show the dis­tinctive smooth surfaces, open centric hilum, and crisp double-outline edges of maize. 
Domesticated chile species fruits produce large, flattened lenticular starch grains with a shallow central depression (Perry et al. 2007). When rotated on the side, a central linear feature is visible that runs parallel to the long axis of the grain. All five domesticated species of chile produce starch grains of this type; starch produced by wild species is dis­tinctively different. The two chile grains recovered from the Three Dog site measure 19 and 21 µm in

The large root/tuber-type granule (Figure 4e, f) falls into Reichert's Type 8: grains simple, eccen­tric, cuneiform, or flattened. However, unlike most grains in this category, this flattened granule is broader than long (length = 36 µm, width = 46 µm, thickness = 30 µm, tapering at the edges to 5-10 µm). The granule is oriented in terms of the loca­tion of the hilum (accretion center). Faint lamellae are present. The large unknown is not any of the domesticated lowland root or tuber taxa and does not match any species illustrated in Reichert ( 1913). However, there are some similarities to taxa described by Reichert in the Amaryllidaceae, Cycadaceae, Liliaceae, Dioscoreaceae, Maran­taceae, and Zingiberaceae, as wen as taxa in the Iridaceae (Pearsall, laboratory documents); study of starch from wild utilized plants in these groups may allow eventual identification of this granule. Pearsall checked stem tissues of two species of Heliconia and one Costus, plants that produce use­ful fibers, but these are not the source of the large unknown.

The three small unknown granules (Figure 4a-d) may not be from the same plant species, as they differ somewhat in shape. SS344 Granule 1 is more spheroidal than elongated like SS344 Granule 2 and SS6 l Granule 2. The three unknowns are similar, however, in possessing a slight central indentation, single outline, and closed, centric to slightly eccentric hi Ium. Lamel­lae are not visible. The central indentation is rem­iniscent of wild Dioscorea (yam genus), but the unknowns are much smaller than any illustrated species in this group or any wild Calathea. The shape and smooth appearance of the unknown leads us to suggest an origin in root or tuber tis­

Phytoliths proved to be extremely rare on the Three Dog site tools (compared to studies else­where) and were present on eight microliths. With the exception of a few grass short cells not diag­nostic to genus or species (not tallied), the most common silicified tissue recovered was undulating fruity transport tissue. One to three examples of these silicified tissues were observed on seven tools. Study of phytolith production in fruits, seeds, roots, rhizomes, and tubers from a wide range of New World domesticated plants reveal that transport tis­sues (xylem and phloem) are sometimes silicified, and in general, are undulating in form in fruits and

seeds, and straight in roots, rhizomes, and tubers (Chandler-Ezell et al. 2006). In the context of a tool surface, undulating transport tissues can be inter­preted as a generalized fruit/seed indicator. While manioc infrequently produces phytoliths (Dickau 2005), they have been identified archaeologically on grinding tools at the Real Alto site, Ecuador (Chandler-Ezell et al. 2006) and thus the potential exists to find them on other tools such as microliths. We were excited, therefore, when a possible man­ioc secretory cell was found on 16847-B. This type of phytolith, which is produced in manioc roots and leaves, was characterized during the comparative study mentioned above. While it is assumed that grating would only be required to process manioc

roots (in order to remove the toxin-bearing rind), manioc leaves can also be prepared by grating. Roth (1924:217), for example, describes how two Guyanese Amerindian groups prepared manioc leaves by mincing them on a grater. Unfortunately, example 16847-B will not roll to allow assessment of its three-dimensional form, and therefore can­not be identified conclusively.

liest European contact period geographic distribu­tion of New World plants; the chronicles are also a source of information about how these plants were prepared and consumed. While we should not be bound exclusively to such accounts (Curet 2003; Keegan 1989), they serve as models to be tested in the earlier record. Columbus was the first European to observe the domesticates reported in this study. Lacking prior knowledge of the plants, he could only describe them in familiar terms using words of his lexicon. For example, he noted maize at least three times in his Diario, referring to it as panizo, which he likened to millet (Dunn and Kelley 1989:89), an Old World crop. Although he did not record maize for San Salvador, the first island where he made landfall, he noted it a few days later in his October 16, 1492, entry, during his circumnaviga­tion of and short stay on another central Bahamas island, Fernandina (Long Island), Bahamas: 
I have no doubt that all year they sow millet and harvest it and likewise all other things (... y no pongo duda q todo el afio siembra panizo y cogen y asi todas otras cosas) [translation by Dunn and Kelley (1989:88-89)]. 
He mentioned millet briefly on November 6, when he saw it in Cuba (Dunn and Kelley 1989:139). Then again on December 6, while still in Cuba, he observed fields that 
looked like wheat in the month of May in the farmlands of Cordova (o grade parte d[e]llas y parecian las semeteras coma trigo en el mes de mayo en [a capifia de Cordova (translation by Dunn and Kelley (1989:203)]. 
On the second voyage of Columbus to the Ameri­cas, Coma, a traveler who accompanied the expe­dition, wrote about a plant he observed on Guadeloupe, which we now believe to have been com, 
it is a grain of very high yield, of the size of the lupine [referring to the cultivated white lupine of the Mediterranean], of the roundness of a chick-pea ( cicer) and yields a meal (farina) ground to a very fine powder (eff racto tenuis­simo polline); it is ground as is wheat (jru­mentum) and yields a bread of very good taste; many chew the seeds when in need of nour­ishment [Sauer 1966:55]. 
On his return trip to Spain in 1493, Columbus brought com seeds, which were planted and har­vested in Europe. In Peter Martyr's Decade I, Book I, this plant is referred to as mahiz, a reference Mar­tyr obtained from people who had made the voy­age (Sauer 1966:55, 1972:155). 
Currently, direct evidence for prehistoric com in the Caribbean is known from archaeological sites in Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, St. Thomas (U.S. Virgin Islands), two islands 
in the Bahamas archipelago, San Salvador and Eleuthera, and from cores dating to prehistoric levels from Haiti and Puerto Rico (Table 5). The earliest evi­dence comes from the Archaic age. Pollen from two sites in the Dominican Republic (Sanoja 1989), starch grains from the sites of Maruca and Puerto Ferro, Puerto Rico (Pagan Jimenez et al. 2005), and maize cob phytoliths in a core taken from a pond adjacent to the Maisabel site (Puerto Rico) (Siegel et al. 2005) indicate that maize was present during the Archaic age in Hispaniola and Puerto Rico and not brought by Ceramic age people from South America during the Ostionoid period as has been hypothesized (Rouse 1992: 109). Findings suggest that Archaic age peoples engaged in low-level cul­tivation or casual horticulture (Newsom and Wing 2004) and evidence indicates that com was part of their repertoire. 
Com has also been recovered from a variety of Ceramic age contexts including small residential sites, burial caves, a small civic-ceremonial site, and the large village of En Bas Saline, home to a cacique. The earliest evidence for com from an open-air residential site from this period comes from the Three Dog site.

Newsom and Deagan 1994; Newsom and Wing 2004), and Preacher's Cave, Eleuthera (A.D. 1460) (Carr et al. 2006:8 1) point to the widespread use of com throughout the Ostionoid sequence in the northern Antilles. 
Dietary Contribution-Maize 
The dietary contribution of maize to the Antillean diet prior to and at the time of European contact is poorly understood, 1 and most investigators believe it to have been small, riever achieving the primacy of manioc or sweet potato (Newsom and Deagan 1994, Newsom and Pearsall 2003; Newsom and Wing 2004; Rouse 1992; Sauer 1966:9; Sturtevant 1969). According to Rouse ( 1992: 12), com was not an important food because it "played no role" in Tafno religion or mythology. Newsom and Wing (2004:202, 214) and Pearsall (1994) view maize in the Caribbean and parts of South America as an incidental, secondary, or "low-intensity" crop. The geographically broad findings of maize from sites beginning with the Archaic age now suggest that com may have played an earlier and larger role in the Caribbean diet than believed previously. The data presented here suggest that maize was part of a broad-based diet, commonly used in concert with other plants, including chiles, and was not a sup­plemental or "curiosity" crop as Pearsall ( 1994) proposed earlier. 
Maize Preparation 
The Three Dog site microlith assemblage suggests that the primary means by which the inhabitants processed their com before cooking was through grating. Other sources of information, such as the sixteenth-century ethnohistoric accounts, provide little insight into how Antillean peoples prepared maize for consumption. Peter Martyr (in Sauer 1972:155) states that the Tafno made bread from it, a practice confirmed by com starch grains on griddles (Rodriguez Suarez and Pagan Jimenez 2008), while Oviedo's account (1959:14-15 [ 1526]) records that it was toasted "when the ears are tender they are eaten almost as milk." Both reports hint that com was processed and eaten in several different ways, opening up the possibility that grating was at least one type of preparation. 
Because the accounts do not mention grated com or the grating process and because grating tools are rarely recognized or recovered archaeo­logically, grating has been overlooked as a possi­ble means of maize preparation. Yet, grated com is and was a common food or ingredient and numer­ous recipes call for it. During the nineteenth cen­tury, American pioneers added grated corn to thicken and sweeten dishes (Fussell 1992: 187). They also made gritted meal from it and devised metal graters in a variety of shapes and forms (Dou­glas County Genealogical and Historical Society Journal 1986). Today as in earlier times, com chow­ders and puddings call for grated corn, the major component of such dishes (Fussell 1992). Green com tamales prepared in Nicaragua require grated corn (Honduras This Week 1997). During prehis­tory, grated com was likely prepared and consumed in a number of ways. We propose that, in addition to being the primary ingredient of some dishes, it also served as a thickening and flavoring agent, along with other starch-bearing plants such as man­ioc, yautfa, and zamia for multi-ingredient dishes prepared with pungent chiles described by the chroniclers (Sauer 1966). 
Space-Time Systematics-Chili Peppers 
The first written reference to chili peppers or aji can be found in Columbus's diary, written on Mon­day, January 14, 1492, from Hispaniola: 
There is also much chili, which is their pep­per, of a kind more valuable than [black] pep­per, and none of the people eat without it, for they find it very healthful. Fifty caravels can be loaded with each year in Hispaniola [Dunn and Kelley 1989:341]. 
New evidence from starch residue analyses indicate that chiles were among the early domesticated plants of the New World, present in Ecuador by 6100 B.P. and widely cultivated during prehistory (Perry et al. 2007). Las Casas noted that the Tafno grew one wild form and two domesticated varieties, believed to be Capsicum annum and C. chinensis (Newsom 1993, 2008:178; Sauer 1996:57). The starch grain evidence from the Three Dog site pushes the date for use of domesticated chilis in the Caribbean back to A.D. 700/800. The only other Caribbean archae­ological evidence for chile comes from the En Bas Saline site where Newsom identified Capsicum spp. The morphology of those examples overlapped that of domesticated and wild species (Newsom 1993; Newsom and Pearsall 2003). 

Downloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core. YBP Library Services, on 22 Aug 2018 at 17:39:32, subject to the Cambridge Core terms of use, available at https://www.cambridge.org/core/terms. https://doi.org/10.1017/S1045663500007793 
Capsicum domestication is a complex issue and there is considerable geographic overlap among species. Four species of chilis were brought under domestication: Capsicum annum, C. frutescens (includes C. chinense), C. baccatum, and C. pubes­cence (Piperno and Pearsall 1998). Capsicum frutescens is the most widely cultivated pepper of the Amazon Basin and Caribbean and domesti­cated chilis would have been widely available to the populations migrating into the Caribbean. While we cannot identify the Three Dog site domesticated chile starches to species, it is most likely that they derived from the C. annum and C. frutescens complex of lowland peppers, which emerged in the Central American to northern South American region. 
Stone Tool Morphology and Use 

In this study, starch grains were found on three dif­ferent kinds of bipolar-produced microliths, hypothesized to have been manioc grater chips (Berman et al. 1999). Other archaeological and ethnographic data suggest that microliths, assumed to have been set in grater boards, were used to process a range of root, tuber, and seed plant mate­rials. Grater boards are not and were not used exclu­sively to process only one plant, as the archaeological literature leads us to believe (sensu DeBoer 1975).2 Oliver (2001:76-77) notes, for example, that Amazonian Indians use grater boards to process a variety of tubers besides manioc. Y de (1965:54, 55) reported that in addition to manioc, the Wai Wai grated sweet potatoes (lpomoea batatas) and bananas on manioc graters. Walker (1980) observed that the Garifuna used grater boards to shred coconut. According to Perry (2005:423), the Makushi currently use manioc grater boards to remove maize kernels from their ears. Roth ( 1924:218) observed that the Indians of the Guiana Shield grated seeds from a variety of trees, including Nectandra rodioei, Dimorphan­dara mora, and Vouacapoua americana, as well as a local seed known as pario, and the sawari nut (fruit of Caryocar tuberculosa ), but he did not indi cate the kind of grating implements used. Pozo Azul Norte-I (A.D. 400--800) and Los Mangos de Parguaza (A.D. 1000--1500), two archaeological sites in the middle Orinoco Valley, yielded microliths (assumed to have been part of manioc grater boards) that contained arrowroot, guapo (Myrosma cf. cannifolia), flint-type com, a mem­ber of the ginger family (Zingiberaceae), and unidentified grass starches (Perry 2001, 2002, 2004, 2005). Dickau' s (2005) study of residues from 15 archaeological sites in Panama also documented that more than one kind of plant was present on flaked stone tools (including microliths) indicating that they were used to process a range of plants. 

Understanding Island Colonization 

The establishment of permanent settlements on San Salvador most likely did not occur directly from the Greater Antilles, but was preceded by the col­onization of neighboring islands (Keegan 1992). Crop dispersal may have occurred selectively among the expanding populations with certain crops having had greater chances of survival and propagation than others. We hypothesize that the resources brought to San Salvador helped reestab­lish at least a portion of the homeland horticultural system and a near, but not entirely, complete hor­ticultural system from the previous island. 
During the earliest exploration and settlement of the islands, the settlers may have selected spe­cific plants to bring because of their ease of trans­port, high yield, quick maturation, storability, ability to grow under a range of conditions, caloric and nutritional value, desired taste, medicinal value, and religious-symbolic significance. Sites reflect­ing exploratory forays and sites early in the colo­nization process may yield a different repertoire of plants than later, permanent sites. The paleobotan­ical record, along with other material indices, may help us distinguish between permanent settlements and visits or stopovers. Knowledge of which plant stocks and seeds to bring may have been based on what the colonizers grew successfully on previous islands; as the migrants came to "settle in" (i.e., know and understand their local environments), they learned which endemic plants to exploit and which additional plants to secure through return vis­its to their homeland, long-distance trading expe­ditions, or gift exchanges. 
Interisland voyaging distances and travel con­ditions also must have affected what people selected and brought with them. Some plants, such as man­ioc, were more difficult to propagate than seed plants, which appear to have been successful trans­fers. Com and chiles, both seed plants, are easily transported, mature quickly, and produce high

yields (in the case of com). Chiles have a wide soil tolerance and thus could grow easily in the alka­line Bahamian soils. The quick, 90 day (or less) maturation rate of com would have insured as many as four harvests a year, assuming moisture and other growing conditions were met. And, if the com were harvested green, or if there were two types of com, each maturing at different intervals, as Oviedo (1959) observed among the Tafno of Hispaniola, even more harvests may have been realized. 
The evidence for the interisland transfer of roots and tubers is less well understood at the site. In a previous article, we noted that cf. Xanthosoma sp. or cf. 'Zamia sp. was present on two of the tools; these plants may have been present on the island prior to human settlement. It is possible, for exam­ple, that the yautfa starch we tentatively identified came from a wild species (Berman and Pearsall 2000). Similarly, four species of 'Zamia grow wild in the Bahamas (Britton and Millspaugh 1962); our findings may be attributed to one of these. Domes­ticated yautfa is propagated from cormels, setts cut from cormels, or stem cuttings (Onwueme 1978:208), and because harvested cormels can last 
3.5 months at re (Onwueme 1978:217), they could have been transported easily via canoe from nearbyJslands. Manioc plants, in contrast to maize, yautfa, and chiles, would have been difficult to establish, as they must be propagated by stem cut­tings, which are subject to deterioration within a short time of being taken out of the ground (Onwueme 1978:122). Manioc cuttings may not have easily survived the journey between islands. Manioc can be propagated by seed, although ger­mination has a 50 percent or more failure rate (Onwueme 1978). Furthermore, manioc takes nine to 19 months to mature when grown from cuttings (Onwueme 1978; Piperno and Pearsall 1998), much longer than the other plants represented in the assemblage. The difficulties in transplanting manioc from stem cuttings or growing it from seed may explain its low incidence and may support the hypothesis that this site represents an early exam­ple of the colonization of San Salvador (Berman and Gnivecki 1995). 

Raw Material Availability and Starch Grain Residues 
In this study we hypothesized that the Three Dog site microliths would be used for multiple purposes due to raw material scarcity, and that numerous plant residues, representing artifact reuse, would be present. In order to see whether such a generaliza­tion can be supported, we looked at three other locales with evidence for starch grain deposition on microliths. Chert and quartz, the constituent materials for the microliths at Pozo Azul Norte 1 (Perry 2005), can be easily found near the site. The sources of the microliths from Los Mangos de! Par­guaza are also {ound in plentiful amounts in the area (Perry 2001, 2004 ). The raw materials that made up the stone tool assemblages from Panama stud­ied by Dickau (2005), which include bipolar flakes, are within a few kilometers of these sources (Anthony Ranere, personal communication to Mary Jane Berman, May 2006). 
The idea that microliths were used to process more than one kind of plant to maximize the util­ity of scarce raw materials is not upheld, as they appear to be present and abundant at the areas we queried. Perry (2002:8, 2005:422) argues that i1 was economical to process a variety of plants on 8 single grater board due to the high manufacturing costs required in its production (Roth 1924; Yde 1965). Other economic factors, such as transpor1 costs due to interisland trade, may have contributed to their multiple uses. Grater boards are known tc have been traded extensively within lowland Soutl: America and may have been traded throughout the Caribbean. Historically, numerous lowland Soutt American groups such as the Tamma, Maiongkong Guinau, and Wai Wai produced manioc-grate1 boards that were traded and exchanged great dis· tances within Amazonia (Butt-Colson 1973; Cher· nela 1992; Im Thurm 1967; Lathrap 1973:172 Oliver 2001; Roth 1924:235;Yde 1965:34). Finally grater boards were often decorated with pattemec designs. Like other forms of material culture, tht grater boards may have served as individual anc group signifiers (sensu Wiessner 1983). Symbolic meanings unique to the owner or ethnic group owner user preferences, as well as production anc transport costs, rather than raw material scarcity might have contributed to the multiple uses of grate1 boards. 

Why No or Little Evidence for Manioc ?3 
With the exception of the possible secretory eel identified on one microlith (Figure 2h), why is man­ioc not present on the grater chips as expected'.

Perry (200 1, 2002, 2004, 2005) identified starch grains on so-called manioc grater teeth from the Middle Orinoco Basin, but no manioc was evident. She suggests that the manioc starch may have been removed by washing the board to eliminate the manioc toxins. This may explain its near absence at the Three Dog site. Like Perry, though, we agree that this is an unlikely explanation because the other starch grains that were observed are found in deep fissures. Why would they have remained and man­ioc didn't? From ethnographic accounts, we know that manioc grater chips inserted in grater boards were made from other materials such as peach palm thorns, bone, teeth, shell, and hard woods (DeBoer 1975; Dole 1978). It is also possible that manioc grating was performed with other tools and/or other materials. Oviedo ( 1959) (in Keegan 2007: 178) observed that Tafno used the rough skin of the stingray to grate a fine manioc flour. Such materi­als may not have survived the archaeological record or were not recognized as having been used to grate manioc and thus were not recovered and/or ana­lyzed. It is also possible that manioc is not reflected significantly because a large crop was not har­vested. It may be, too, that this sample of microliths was not used to process manioc or that the prehis­toric occupants employed other methods such as roasting, a processing technology documented for lowland Amazonian groups (Dole 1978; Oliver 2001:76-77) or grinding or pounding, a process­ing technique observed in Puerto Rico (Pagan Jimenez and Oliver 2008; Pagan Jimenez et al. 2005). (A fragment of a grinding stone made from 
a non-local material was found.) 

It is also possible, but not demonstrated, that the lack of manioc is due to taphonomic factors. Dam­age to the manioc starch grains may have been incurred through grating, rendering them uniden­tifiable; preservation conditions may have erased the evidence; and other taphonomic variables may be responsible for their destruction or alteration. Experimental work such as cutting manioc using flakes, pounding with stone tools, fermentation, and toasting "grated" manioc on a ceramic griddle, demonstrates that manioc starch is frequently dam­aged by food processing (Chandler-Ezell et al. 2006; Pearsall et al. 2005). In a toasting experiment, the experimental griddle, used for 31 cooking ses­sions (10 hours total), preserved abundant identi­fiable manioc starch (granules with extinction crosses and clear diagnostic features), and an abun­dance of damaged (lacking extinction crosses but not gelatinized) and gelatinized starch (Pearsall et al. 2005). Many of the hundreds of identifiable manioc granules preserved on the fragments exhib­ited enlarged fissures in comparison to unprocessed manioc, however, the extent to which fissure enlargement reduces the likelihood of long-term preservation of manioc is unknown. Maize gran­ules with enlarged fissures (i.e., milling damage) typically form part of archaeological maize starch assemblages as well. 
Summary and Conclusion 
In an earlier study of the Three Dog site, Berman and Pearsall (2000) found evidence of arboricul­ture from macrobotanical remains and the possi­ble cultivation and/or use of cf. Xanthosoma sp. or cf. 'Zamia sp. from starch grains present on two microliths. In the findings presented here, starch and phytolith residues on additional examples of microliths revealed maize (Zea mays), chile (Cap­sicum sp.), two or more unidentified root/tuber resources, one possible Manihot secretory cell, and evidence of undulating fruity transport tissue, indi­cating that the site's occupants processed seed and root/tuber plants and very likely cultivated and har­vested them. Maize was the most ubiquitous of the starch remains and there was no further evidence of Xanthosoma sp. or 'Zamia sp. Unfortunately the search for phytoliths, which may have revealed other plants, did not prove to be as telling as the starch grain analysis. As in our earlier investiga­tion, the phytoliths yielded mainly nondiagnostic remains. 
From this study, we determined that plant resources such as com, chiles, and root and tuber plants, including manioc, were brought to San Sal­vador as part of a "package" or series of "packages" to help reestablish the horticultural systems prac­ticed on the islands from where they originated. We suggest that these horticultural systems reflect those of the homeland communities of northern Cuba or northern Hispaniola. Other root and tuber plants including Xanthosoma sp. or 'Zamia sp. and fruit tree seeds or stocks may have been transported, too, although they may represent wild representatives of these taxa and if so, they may have been the same or similar to resources collected or cultivated in the

homeland. While we hypothesized that the presence of multiple plants on the microliths may have been related to raw material scarcity, studies in other areas where raw materials were plentiful indicated that this did not play a role in the observed pattern. Our findings support the idea that grating imple­ments assumed to have been components of the grater boards of antiquity were used to process a variety of different plants and this practice was part of routinized behavior brought by the people who colonized San Salvador. 
The study of the plant remains from the Three Dog site reveals that migration to and colonization of the island from homeland areas involved the physical transfer of some domesticated plants, as well as the knowledge of how to process, grow, and harvest them. The presence of com at this date con­tradicts the idea that it did not appear in the Bahamas until after A.D. 1200, as Keegan (1987:334) has suggested, while the identification of chiles pushes back the arrival of this crop into the Caribbean. The unexpected near absence of manioc starch on the microliths can be attributable to a number of explanations, none of which proves unequivocably that it wasn't cultivated. Finally, more domesticated and cultivated plants may have been brought to the island by later colonists and the plant repertoire may have been supplemented through trade, gift-giving, wife-exchange, or other means of resource-transfer. 
The botanical assemblages of En Bas Saline (Newsom 1993; Newsom and Pearsall 2003; New­som and Wing 2004) and the Tutu site (Pearsall 2002) reveal a late prehistoric horticultural system based on roots/tubers, maize, herbaceous plants (including wild or domestic Capsicum), and arbori­culture. With the exception of chiles, this pattern was in place by the Archaic age in Puerto Rico and, as we argue, fully in place by at least AD. 700--800 in Cuba or Hispaniola and brought to the central Bahamas. By A.D. 1150, there is evidence of maize, zamia, beans, sweet potato, maranta, yautfa, Fabaceae, and Poaceae in southeastern Cuba (Rodrfguez Suarez and Pagan Jimenez 2006, 2008: 162); this study suggests that at least some of these plants may have been present earlier there. In spite of the differences between the larger, more environmentally complex islands of Hispaniola and Cuba, and the smaller, drier, carbonate Bahamas, these crops could be grown and were used for food. 
Thanks to the entries of Columbus from Long Island, Bahamas, we know that the Lucayans con­tinued to grow maize in the central Bahamas for approximately 700 years subsequent to its intro­duction. While the hydrological and edaphic con­ditions may not have been ideal for the cultivation of com, they were sufficient and the Lucayans may have selected certain races or developed ways of insuring successful harvests. Finally, our study sub­stantiates other recent work in the Neotropics that indicates that an important, if not primary, means of recovering evidence for plant use is through the study of microfossils. The study should serve as one more caveat to investigators (e.g., DeBoer 1975) who infer manioc production and consumption from the presence of microliths that resemble ethnographically reported manioc grater chips and is one more example of how "a new archaeob­otanical technique can produce data that fail to sup­port a long-held inference derived originally from ethnographic observations and historical accounts" (Harris 2006:68). A close reading of the ethno­graphic literature indicates that Amerindians did not use manioc grater boards exclusively for manioc, but somehow, this idea has made its way into the literature and influenced the interpretations of sev­eral generations of scholars. 
A persistent question in the Caribbean archae­ological record is why we do not find macrobot­anical evidence of maize, manioc, and other domesticates such as chiles, prior to the later parts of the Chican and Elenan ·Ostionoid periods and why such remains have been limited to Hispaniola, the Virgin Islands, and Nevis (in the case of man­ioc) (Newsom 2006). The question has become 
more pertinent now that starch grain and phytolith evidence indicates maize, manioc, beans, sweet potatoes, and other plants from throughout the northern Antilles and has pushed back their appear­ance in the archaeological record to the Archaic age. As we (Berman and Pearsall 2000) and others have argued, archaeologists working in the Caribbean should employ an inclusive approach using mac­robotanical and microbotanical means of data recovery and analyses to gain a more complete and richer picture of what Newsom (1993), Newsom and Pearsall (2003:354), and Newsom and Wing (2004) describe as a "uniquely Caribbean subsis­tence system" and a "uniquely Caribbean approach to plant production" (Newsom 2008: I 81 ).

study, such analyses help identify which domesti­cates were grown in Cuba or Hispaniola during the eighth and ninth centuries A.D., define the system of early Lucayan plant use in the central Bahamas, address questions of tool use, and contribute to the delineation of what "transported" landscapes looked like and how they took shape during this period of history in this particular island environ­ment.

Notes 
1. 
Stable isotope analyses offer another means of assess­ing the presence of com (and other plants) in the diet (Stokes 1998), although the explanatory potential of the method is undermined by the conflicting results offered by zooarchaeo­logical and paleoethnobotanical analyses (deFrance et al. 1996). In the Bahamas, stable isotope determinations from bone collagen and apatite carbonate of eight Lucayan indi­viduals from cave sites on Abaco, Crooked Island, Eleuthera, Long Island, and Rum Cay were analyzed to establish the comparative contributions of maize, manioc, and other dietary resources. The studies suggest that the Lucayan diet was composed mainly of C3 plants and marine resources, while C4 plants (including maize) were not "incorporated into the Bahamian diet in any observable quantities" (Stokes 1998:226). Because none of the sites from which these skele­tons originated was dated and only two of the skeletons, which were directly dated through radiocarbon means, come from periods later than the Three Dog site [A.D. 1175-1295 (Long Island), A.D. 1375-1450 (Crooked Island)], it is diffi­cult to infer if any dietary shifts occurred from early to late periods in these populations. Keegan's earlier study of 17 Lucayan skeletons analyzed bone collagen (Keegan and DeNiro 1988), which has since been proved to reflect the source of protein to the diet, not the correct estimates of plant foods (Stokes 1998: 141). Earlier, Keegan argued that some evidence of C4 plants was present in several skeletons. His suggestion that maize was consumed seasonally is a good one, worthy of further investigation.

The attribution of multiple uses can be extended to the study of griddles, often used as companion indicators of man­ioc. As DeBoer (1975) and Rodriguez Suarez and Pagan Jimenez (2006, 2008) caution, griddles may have been used to bake manioc bread, as well as bread made from maize and other plants. Allaire (1984: 127) notes that the Island Carib used griddles to crack open or dry rotting seeds of the koua-

heu tree, which produced oil that men used for their hair. Dole (1978:237) and Pickersgill and Heiser (1977:817) observed that Amerindians use ceramic griddles to prepare foods from a variety of plants, including manioc. 
3. At least two other Caribbean starch grain studies have noted the absence of (Rodriguez Suarez and Pagan Jimenez 2008) or "lower than expected visibility" (Pagan Jimenez and Oliver 2008: 153) of manioc.
