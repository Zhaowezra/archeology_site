This book is an outstanding example of new approaches to the study of relationships between humans and ani­mals. Recent research, contemporary concerns, and new methodologies are addressed in 18 chapters, an intro­duction, and a conclusion. In addition, this volume pro­vides important resources, such as a digital companion and a useful taxonomic index. Chapters are organized geographically, from north to south, with an emphasis on the Maya area. Research from Central America and Colombia is also addressed in four chapters. Importantly, the book is also available in Spanish from the publisher. 
In the introduction, Christopher M. Gotz provides an overview of the history of both regions and a brief history of zooarchaeological research. Elizabeth S. Wing pre­sents the results of the analysis of dog remains interred in funerary mounds at Marismas Nacionales (A.O. 700­1300). Some of these burials contained only certain body parts of dogs, which may have represented the animal's essence-enough to help the deceased in the journey to the afterlife. Bernardo Rodriguez Galicia and Raul Valadez Azua explore the flow of coastal resources into Teotihuacan, which implied the existence of complex commercial networks and an unequivocal link to Ver­acruz. The authors also address topics such as animal capture, preparation, and preservation, as well as domes­tic and ritual consumption. Using an ethnohistorical approach, Eduardo Corona-Martinez classifies differen­tial usage of birds in central Mexico. Birds were exploited for dietary, medicinal, and ritual purposes, as sources of raw materials, and for individual enjoyment. The author also discusses the notion of bird domestication in Mesoame1ica. 
Tanya M. Peres and colleagues explore witll great detail the zooarchaeology of Olmec and epi-Olmec food­ways (1400-300 B.C.). The authors address the emer­gence of political complexity in the region with regard to differential access to fauna) resources. Animal use in the Mixteca Alta, Oaxaca, is discussed by Heatller A. Lapham and colleagues, in an effort to understand tlle rise of urban lifeways. Animal protein was obtained mainly from dogs, white-tailed deer, and rabbits, while dogs were also represented in funerary rituals.Applying a diachronic approach, Lapham and colleagues analyze seven sites from the Central Valley of Oaxaca, from Archaic to Postclassic times, with the aim of determining patterns of change and stability in animal use and con­sumption. They identify general trends regarding the consumption of deer, dog, rabbit, and turkey. 
Christopher M. Gotz and Travis W. Stanton discuss the use of animals by the prehispanic Maya of the North­ern Lowlands from a point of view that combines archae­ology, ethnohistory, and ethnography. They address discard patterns, abandonment rituals, consumption, and midden formation processes. They also explore the hunt­ing-garden hypothesis and tlle use of body parts in rituals. The results of animal consumption analysis at Mayapan are presented by Marilyn A. Masson and Carlos Peraza Lope. The authors discuss tlle difficulty of distinguishing sacrificed animals from the remains of ritual hunting, festive meals, or combinations of these categories. 
The taphonomic approach has proved to be key for understanding human-animal relationships. Rani T. Alexander and colleagues analyzed archaeofauna from Isla Cilvituk, juxtaposing the taphonomy of animal remains with tlle analysis of site formation processes. In addition, the autllors discuss procurement, production,

household consumption, trade, rituals, and animal dis­card. Coral Montero Lopez proposes a method to infer the nature of archaeological contexts through taphonomy. The author exemplifies this method using white tailed deer from Chinikiha, Chiapas. She also addresses the difficulties of interpreting different types of middens. 
Zooarchaeology is concerned with human-animal relationships from all times, as demonstrated by Erin Kennedy Thornton and Olivia Ng Cackler, who analyzed animal use by overlapping San Pedro Maya and British populations at Holotunich, Belize. Under a diachronic approach, Kitty F. Emery and colleagues analyzed an impressive collection from Kaminaljuyu. The authors compared findings from early excavations with those obtained in recent explorations. The distribution of fauna! remains reveals important differences among the site's inhabitants. Using these results, they discuss trade, regional contact, and environmental changes. David N. Rewniak and colleagues describe the zooarchaeology of San Cristobal, Nicaragua. The authors stress the impor­tance of chronological data and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of using MNI and NISP for commin­gled contexts from different temporalities. 
Diana Rocio Carvajal Contreras analyzed mollusks as evidence of selective foraging at Cueva de los Vam­piros, Panama. Through the study of gathering and sub­sistence strategies related to mollusks, the authors discuss larger economic and sociopolitical structures, ideology, and environmental change. Richard G. Cooke and col­leagues claim that the avian archaeofauna underestimates the diversity of available birds in ancient Panama. This chapter explores a diversity of topics of special interest: species biology and ecology, migration, captivity,repro­duction, and trade, as well as the ornamental, culinary, and ritual uses of birds. Elizabeth Ramos Roca presents an overview of zooarchaeology in Colombia, analyzing theoretical and methodological changes through time. The author raises important considerations about aspects that need to be addressed in order to consolidate this field of study. 
Raul Valadez Azua and colleagues review the impor­tance of dogs in Mesoamerica; they were part of the diet, buried with their owners, and used as raw materials. The authors provide an overview of Mesoamerican findings that form an impressive sample of 1 ,200 individuals from different regions (5000 B.P. to the Spanish conquest), presenting guidelines for their study. Laura Navarro and Joaquin Arroyo-Cabrales combine biological and icono­graphic data in an interesting chapter on Mesoamerican bats. The authors compare the biological characteristics of these animals with available depictions, concluding that most representations merge features of different ani­mals. In the last chapter, Kitty F. Emery presents fictional tales that were created using archaeological data, aiming to make us reconsider how we think about and utilize the animals with which we share the landscape. 
Almost in concert, the authors of this volume explore areas for growth in the field of zooarchaeology. Better records of articulated bones and anatomical relations, as well as controlled excavations of small vertebrates, are necessary. The lack of contextual information is one of the biggest problems in zooarchaeology, especially for understanding the nature of midden and ritual contexts. In addition, flora and fauna datasets need to be integrated to understand foodways. In conclusion, the development of this field requires that all research projects concede the same importance to animal bones as to human remains, in order to better understand past social dynamics.
