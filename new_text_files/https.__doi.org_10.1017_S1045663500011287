this plant grows well, like maize and mushrooms, where lightning has struck. The authors link iguanas and croc­odiles to lightning, but it is not clear why, except for their connection to water. Mesoamerican descriptive terms for lightning include "light," "shine," "machete," "explosion" and "god/sacred." Lightning is also a spirit familiar in Mesoamerica. Religious specialists rely on lightning symbolism for bringing fortune, protection, and cures, like 'reading lightning in the blood' (taking a pulse). Lightning can also be utilized by religious spe­cialists for destruction. 
Since lightning appears in clouds on mountains, Mesoamerican people believe that storm deities generate lightning and rain from mountain caves. Shrines to storm gods exist on mountains, but the authors do not mention the important discovery of intricate wooden lightning bolts tossed by worshipers in Mexican alpine lakes during rain ceremonies. Maya people call the storm deity Chahk (also Chae; the figures in the book often do not exhibit clear examples ofChahk), who generates lightning with ax blows in clouds.Aconnection between lightning bolts and axes was articulated to me recently by Lacandon Maya: lightning must contain an ax since it splits trees! Maya smoking celts represent the power of lightning, sustenance, and kingly power, for according to mythical narratives, they served to crack open the mountain that released maize, water, and other necessities to people. 
In the conclusions, Staller and Stross skillfully pre­sent the similarities and differences in lightning sym­bolism between the two culture areas, but with a general focus on Andean perspectives. The similarities include the association of lightning with mountain lords, twins, and bodies of water, its connection with sacred places and stone tools, its ties to fire and crop fertility, and the use of lightning symbolism by shamans. They suggest that the similarities stem from interaction and parallel inventions without indicating possible shared ancient beliefs. The authors point out that the differences between the regions are based on cultural and environ­mental factors. The association of lightning with rain­bows, the heavens, metallurgy, spiritual forces, masculine and feminine symbolism, and animating forces at sacred places is central to Andean societies. The importance of lightning symbolism with deities, caves, and mythology belongs to Mesoamerica. 
This book is an exceptional reference for analyzing Andean and Mesoamerican lightning symbolism. Occa­sionally, however, the authors' treatments do not contain references for readers to explore, such as the position that Mayan terms for jaguar and snake, in addition to nagual ('spirit familiar') and serpent, are the same. Nonetheless, this book nicely synthesizes copious infor­mation on lightning symbolism and its connection to language, religion, agriculture, and cosmic order. At times the connections are not clarified, but they can be explored with further research. The book is well-written and the illustrations are generally good, especially the color images. This unique book is valuable for examin­ing lightning in culture and how perceptions of natural forces influence people.

A notable trend in recent Central Andean archaeology has been an increase in large and exciting field projects organized and directed by Peruvian investigators, made possible by domestic financial support coming from the central government, regional and municipal authorities, Peruvian businesses, and foreign corporations. These frequently overshadow foreign projects in scale, duration, and funding. Fortunately, this surge in research by Peru­vian scholars has been paralleled by an equivalent spike in the number and quality of books and journals published in Peru. The Boletin de Arqueologia PUCP andArque­ologia y Sociedad are perhaps the most noteworthy jour­nals, among many others. 
The book under review exemplifies the aforemen­tioned trends. It summarizes recent excavations by Quirino Olivera at four sites in the cloud forest (ceja de selva) of northern Peru. The Andes mountain chain is particularly low and narrow in this area, which has long been appreciated as a major corridor connecting the Peruvian coast and highlands with the forested eastern slopes and vast Amazonian lowlands. Julio C. Tello highlighted this region's importance in the development of Andean civilization, but despite a century of archae­ological work in Peru, the prehistory remained poorly known due to logistical problems and unresolved polit­ical tensions surrounding the contested northern border between Peru and Ecuador. A peace treaty signed between the two nations in 1998 has facilitated fieldwork and even bi-national collaboration. 
Arqueol6gicaAlto Amaz6nica provides a lucid sum­mary of the extensive research carried out by Quirino Olivera between 2010 and 2012 at the sites of Monte­grande and San Isidro in J aen, and Casual and Las Juntas in Bagua. The large-scale excavations were sponsored by the regional governments of San Martfn and Ama­zonas, as well as private support from the Friends of the Si pan Museum Association and the Yanacocha Mining Company. The mining company also sponsored the vol­ume under consideration, lavishly illustrated with full­page color photographs of the landscape, excavations,

and artifacts. This is a welcome feature, given that few readers will have had a first-hand familiarity of this region. Another unusual attribute is that the text appears in English as well as Spanish. 
Each of the sites discussed yielded unexpected dis­coveries. The Montegrande site is situated in town of Jaen at 749 mabove sea level (m as!). The spot had once been occupied by a concrete church, a garbage dump, and a public latrine. Much to everyone's surprise, exca­vations unearthed an imposing and well preserved com­plex of early monumental architecture buried deep beneath the overburden. The complex consists of a series of concentric curved retaining walls superimposed over time, with a central staircase. Olivera believes that the walls follow a concentric spiral path leading to an inner chamber where burnt offerings were made. The central chamber is in the form of a snail, "the oldest and most universal symbol in human history." A series of burials were added, apparently at the time of the closure of the masonry complex with a layer of rock gravel and mud. Olivera argues that its construction phases date to the Late Preceramic, and that the complex had a public and religious character. While many Late Precerarnic centers have been studied, none in Peru resemble the architec­ture of Montegrande. A wide range of Initial period, Early Horizon, and later pottery is illustrated, but appar­ently it was not associated with the public architecture, suggesting that the site had a longer and more complex history than is currently appreciated. 
Olivera investigated a second mound in Jaen, known as San Isidro. The occupation there had a long history beginning by the Initial period and continuing into Inca times. The deep stratigraphy included an early circular structure covered by later rectangular stone construc­tions. There were repeated episodes of intentional filling with rounded gravel and sand followed by site renewal with new buildings. The site yielded 33 funerary contexts, some including guinea pig remains and one including a macaw. The most elaborate burial was of an adult wear­ing a necklace of snail shells. A batch of worked Spondy­lus shell from the distant warm waters of the Pacific coast confirmed the presence of long-distance exchange. 
In Bagua, located 40 km to the northeast of Jaen, Olivera carried out major horizontal excavations at the mounds of Casual (406 m as!) and Las Juntas (415 m asl).At Casual, Olivera discovered a prehistoric wattle­and-daub structure with pilasters and mural painting in red, white, and black dating prior to 50-70 B.C. He interprets the figure represented as a caiman. Las Juntas also presented evidence of polychrome murals, with two distinct phases of decorated wattle-and-daub walls flanked by pilasters, each of which was intentionally buried with rounded gravel fill and mud. The murals presented special conservation challenges, but fortu­nately the project included the participation of Ricardo Morales, a pioneer in the conservation of adobe murals in Peru. Morales contributes a brief report on the diffi­culties of treating the Bagua murals and the techniques that were employed. 
This is a remarkable volume that makes these groundbreaking discoveries available for the first time. Perhaps the only disappointment is that the chronology of the four sites is not sufficiently understood, either in relative or in absolute terms. A small number of radio­carbon measurements are reported, but they are from late fills rather than being associated with the buildings and features of most interest. The ceramic sequences for Bagua, developed by Ruth Shady and Hermilio Rosas, and for Jaen, developed by Ryan Clasby, were not used effectively to shed light on complex history of these sites. 
The spiral-shaped structure from Montegrande has no analogues in Peru, but Ecuadorian archaeologist Francisco Valdez found a similar complex at Santa Ana-La Florida in southern Ecuador. Valdez provides a short contribution to this volume describing and illus­trating his finds, and a series of radiocarbon measure­ments that averaged 2500 B.C. Those from the central tomb in the spiral-shaped central structure ranged between 2450-2040 B.C., lending credibility to Oliv­era's chronological assessment of Montegrande. 
When the peace treaty was signed in 1998, the thorny oyster (i.e., Spondylus princeps) was chosen as the emblem of the Bi-national Development Plan of the Peru-Ecuador Border Region because of its importance in the prehispanic exchange systems. In 2012, Peru's President Ollanta Humala and Ecuador's President Rafael Correa jointly announced an initiative that included a bi-national archaeological project focusing on the Zamora, Chinchipe, and Marafion river basins, expanding upon Olivera and Valdez's discoveries. Recent literature dealing with the relationship between archaeology and politics delves into the archaeological legitimation of nation states, whose basis has little if anything to do with the distant past. The situation doc­umented in this volume is fundamentally different. Archaeology is being used to overcome deep antago­nisms between Peru and Ecuador that go back to over a century ago. As Ulises Gamonal, director of the Museo Herm6genes Mejia Solf in Jaen, eloquently states in an interview that concludes the volume: 
For the first time Peruvians and Ecuadorians join to discover their common historical roots, leaving behind those unnecessary conflicts between two brotherly peoples, whose history is one. To exchange weapons for trowels is the best thing that could happen to build peace and integration of the peoples that for thousands of years shared a past and a common origin.
