Only a small bibliography is provided and the majority of the bibliographic sources have to be extracted from the individual chapter notes, but most of the necessary references are there.

This valuable, dense book distills and summarizes two decades of Flora Clancy's work. Her stated aim is to use art historical methods of formal, or stylistic, analysis to understand and explain the initial development, character, and uses of the Classic Maya stela. Theoretically, such analysis ignores or avoids considerations of iconography and textual content, concentrating instead on the formal characteristics of scale, composition, and carving tech­nique and style. To these, Clancy has added the critical fact of location within a Maya plaza. With these observations she hopes to reconstruct the decisions made by ancient sculptors and their patrons. Although it is impossible to ignore the considerable corpus of commentary on the iconography and texts of the Early Classic monuments of Tikal-which are the focus of her work-Clancy has gen­erally managed to maintain her distance, summarizing the relevant literature in endnotes. 
In chapter 2, before she begins a chronological and the­matic discussion of the monuments, Clancy outlines her criteria and specialized vocabulary. She discusses the expressive uses of line and edge in relief carving and describes her tools of analysis which include a definition of compositional fields (panel, multi-panel, recto-verso, and wraparound). Within fields, Clancy finds three com­positional modes, or ways to display the image: isotropic (full-frontal and symmetrical, rare in the Early Classic), sta­tional (asymmetrical and static, the common profile por­trait), and narrative (involving one or more active figures, common on Preclassic stelae and Late Classic panels). Once defined, Clancy explains how these fields and modes were used in monumental programs, as the well-known stela/pedestal pair (less accurately called "stela/altar"), and in pairs and triads of images, found on one or more mon­uments, involving any combination of compositional fields. The deployment of imagery leads to conclusions about the purposes and effective use of the monuments in a public plaza. Since recto-verso and wraparound fields, and pair and triad programs involve viewing stelae from more than one side, Clancy concludes that these Early Classic sculp­tures were intended to be experienced actively by the gen­eral public and visitors to the city. 
In chapter 3, Clancy defines plaza imagery, adding more useful terms to her descriptive vocabulary. Usually the main image is an "honored human," although there are examples of anthropomorphs and insignia. Especially informative are the gestures and regalia of the honored human, since these have chronological as well as icono­graphic significance. Gestures include cradling, flat-hand, cupped-hand, extroverted, offering, and holding; they may involve disembodied heads, ceremonial bars, weapons, staffs, and bags. Secondary images are the basal and super­nal motifs, while supplementary images in the main field involve no interaction with the honored person (interest­ingly these include most bound figures). Finally, there are marginal images, like the marginalia of medieval manu­scripts, which are usually tiny, heteromorphic, and active (pp. 37-43). 
Chapters 4 through 9 present Clancy's detailed analy­sis of the sculpture, organized both thematically and chronologically from approximately 8.12.0.0.0 to 
9.3.13.0.0 (AD. 278-507). Previously Clancy had outlined changes that occurred between Late Preclassic times and the appearance of plaza sculpture in the lowlands-for instance, the construction of much smaller pyramidal struc­tures and virtual abandonment of enormous stucco facade masks. Early Classic monuments are human in scale, implying a more accessible role for the ruler and greater civic participation by the populace. Clancy sees these changes as one result of an Early Classic expansion of cities, although such growth was actually concentrated around Tikal where the early stelae are found, while other parts of the lowlands declined. The principal Early Clas­sic stelae considered in this study are at Tikal, Uaxactun, Yaxha, Xultun, El Zapote, and Tres Islas. 
Likely antecedents to the earliest central lowland ste­lae are at Abaj Takalik near the south coast. Candidates for the two earliest extant central lowland stelae, some two centuries later, are the stubby Tikal Stela 36 with a seated figure, and the fragmentary recto-verso Stela 10 at Uax­actun, with the lower legs of a man on each side-both dated about 8.12.0.0.0 (AD. 278). The Tikal monument also is noteworthy because it was found in a small group northeast of mapped Tikal, whereas the Uaxactun monu­ment, reused as a pedestal, was in the Group A plaza. The U axactun monument looks earlier to this reviewer, because of the character and abundance of scrolls, and it is strik­ing that such an early stela represents Clancy's "recto­verso" compositional type. She emphasizes that this innovative format necessitates walking around the stela "as a strategy of plaza display" (p. 47). But the monument's

possible historic and iconographic significance emerge only toward the end of the book when Clancy has repeat­edly associated such recto-verso portraits with foreign warriors and with the Hero Twins of the Popol Vuh. The next recto-verso example, she notes, also at Uaxactun, is the well-known "Teotihuacan" warrior on Stela 5, which has a (little-known) mirror image on the back; such twin warrior imagery also is found on Stela 31 at Tikal, and at 
Tres Islas to the south. 
Clancy's careful definitions bear fruit as she finds asso­ciations among certain compositions and motifs, like twin or mirror imagery with the "extroverted" gesture. She sees the former as deriving from the foreign group described as "inter-regional warrior," whereas she suggests the extro­verted gesture, which involves reaching up toward the sky, is more traditionally dynastic Maya; when paired with the foreign motif, this may signify contrasting aspects of a reign. These motifs cluster around the end of baktun eight and the beginning of baktun nine. In the next important phase Clancy describes the elaborate, densely symbolic "wraparound" stelae 1, 2, and 28 ofTikal as associated with the synthetic reign of Stormy Sky. These were followed by a period of reaction evident in the monuments of Stormy Sky's son and grandson. From 9.2.0.0.0 (A.D. 475) to the end of the Early Classic period-defined here as 9.3.13.0.0 
(A.D. 507}--the stelae are reduced in size and imagery, each depicting a profile figure, the same gesture, minimal regalia, and neither basal nor supernal motifs. Clancy describes these royal portraits as "attendants" modeled on the twin warrior figures from earlier monuments at Uaxactun and Tikal, and specifically Tikal Stela 31 where such plain fig­ures flank the resplendent Stormy Sky. Concluding the authoritative final chapter, Clancy summarizes this insight­ful and convincing work: "Regardless of how the political history of the Early Classic period is eventually understood, the plaza monuments, through their compositions and images, tell of a "debate" ... which existed between the tra­ditional dynast and the more recent foreign warrior pair" 
(p. 134). For the non-Mayanist, this book demonstrates the power and effectiveness of the descriptive tools of formal analysis for varieties of historical reconstruction.

Motagua Colonial is a fascinating synopsis of ethnohis­torical documents from poorly known depositories in east-em Guatemala. It presents demographic data, indigenous surnames, brief vocabulary lists, and even short personal accounts of life in and around the Motagua river valley during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Four sec­tions focus on the Toquegua (Chol) of the Motagua delta, the Ch' orti' and Alaguilac (probably Xinca) of the middle Motagua Valley, the Ch'orti' of Jocotan parish, and a sur­vey of various small archives in the departments of Chiquimula, El Progreso, and Zacapa. A short opening chapter discusses the need to conduct ethnohistorical research and use the direct historical approach to link archaeological research at Classic period sites like Copan and Quirigua with studies of the more recent past. In par­ticular, the author emphasizes a lacuna in our knowledge of the Postclassic period. 
The structure of the work, though simple, is confus­ing. The opening chapter, called "Part O," does not serve well as an introduction. The section on Jocotan parish returns to the Copan region, but no explicit tie is m<;tde with the site. As interesting as the census data for San Juan Ermita are, it is unclear how they help bridge the gap between the Colonial and prehistoric periods. The direct historical approach may be useful for understanding the past, but Motagua Colonial makes no attempt to employ the method. A clue to the lack of structural unity is found in the opening section, where Feldman refers to the chap­ters as "papers" culled from earlier publications and reports. It is a collection, rather than a seamless and tightly integrated book. 
Feldman's work also can be described as a salvage report. Many of the documents that he studied are not curated in national or church archives, but are carelessly stored in back rooms and sheds. He notes, "anything was possible, from seeing bugs eat the ancient manuscripts before our eyes to finding old documents baled in barbed wire" (p. 87). An important aspect of the book, then, is that it presents fast­disappearing data. A drawback is that it reads like field notes rather than a well-digested synthesis. Motagua Colonial has no single theme, and seems to be a narrative appendix to Feldman's earlier publications A Tumpline Economy (1985) and Riverine Maya (1975). We are treated to fascinating glimpses of marriage customs of the colonial Toquegua and Ch'orti', for example, but never discover Feldman's opin­ion of why these related groups had such different practices. A long list ofToquegua surnames and their etymologies are presented, and we learn that they are derived from a wide variety of languages, including Nahua and perhaps even Xinca or Jicaque. But the reaon why so many foreign names were adopted by the Toquegua is not explored. The great­est disappointment to the reader is that the anthropological data-including some true gems-are not discussed in detail. Feldman describes the book as the conclusion of his "long entrada into the lands of the provinces of Acasaguast­lan and Chiquimula de La Sierra" (p. 5). But the data are so
