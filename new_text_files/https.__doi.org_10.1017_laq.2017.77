Chapter5 covers religionand ritual,withalarge sectiononritual architecturethatis,in places,repet­itive from previous chapters. Vogel makes an inter­esting comparison with Egyptian temples that have several gathering areas from large plazas to small rooms used only by the highest of.cials and rulers. Here and at El Purgatorio, “rather than appealing to the masses, there was an exclusion of the masses” 
(p. 40).InChapter6the urban economyis discussed, and Vogel points out the uniqueness of the political economies of Andean cities where exchange was focusedontribute,reciprocity,and redistribution. She concludes that both elite supervised workshops and household production existed in the city. Chapter 7 concentrates on theidentities of the urbanresidents. Social strati.cation was correlated with residential districts that consisted of ruling elites, intermediate elites, and commoners. 
Chapter8 examines El Purgatorio’s relationships with other regions. Vogel emphasizes cross-cultural interaction with Andean groups including Pachaca­mac, Chancay, Wari, Chimú, and Lambayeque. She makes some comparisons with West Mexico’s shaft tomb complex,which hassome similaritieswith north coast Andean cultures, although the evidence seems fairly weak. Chapter 9 sums up the research and discusses its broader implications. Vogel compares Casmatothe Induscivilization,acorporatestate with an elite rulingclassbut noindividualglori.cationor theatrical displays of power. She concludes that the research supports Stanish’s(2010) idea that Andean cites were small because they had limited market exchange,and their economies were underthe control of elites, andoften did not surviveleadership changes. 
One strength of the book is that Vogel makes comparisons with otherancient states while also high­lightingtheunique natureofElPurgatorio.Thebook is part of a series of accessible studies of urbanism that complementintroductory textbooks.However,it seemsadvanced forintroductory studentsand maybe more appropriate in an upper division course. In its appeal to a wider audience it is not as data heavy as many academic books,butoverall,itis well-written and argued, and makes a substantial contribution to the study of ancient civilizations.

In this ambitious book, AllenChristenson arguesthat contemporary Tz’utujil Maya ritual practices during Semana Santa (HolyWeek)preserve elements ofthe ancient “world renewal” ceremonies of the lowland andhighlandMaya. Christensonattemptsthisby.rst reviewing accounts of rituals from Yucatan and the Maya highlands,and theroleofEasterinthe Spanish conquest, before devoting several chapters to ethno­graphicdescriptions of contemporaryTz’utujil cere­monies.ItiscommendablethatChristenson attempts to historicize the claims of continuity between pre­columbian year-end (Wayeb’) rites and Holy Week in Santiago Atitlán that have been put forward by scholarssuchasE.Michael Mendelson (1957, 1959) for over half a century. Unfortunately the lack of a well-de.ned theoretical andmethodological approach limitshowconvincingitisasaworkof ethnohistory. 
The book comprises an introduction and 10 chap­ters. It has no endnotes that would allow further theoretical or methodological explanations without encumbering themaintext. Theintroductionde.nes the object of the book as Maya “world renewal” ceremonies, described as those through which ritual practitioners “rebirth theworld,” especially “at critical points duringthe calendaryear”(1).Discussion of suchworldrenewal ceremonies willbefamiliartoa Mesoamericanist audience, but Christenson doesn’t explicitly place his work in dialogue with any aca­demictheoriesofritual or syncretism. Onereason this is so problematicis that thereis nothingexclusively Maya about world renewal ceremonies so broadly de.ned. Ceremonial elements such as the new .re, sacri.ce, and “world trees” are hardly unique to Mesoamericaeither. This limits theauthor’s abilityin manycases to demonstratehistorical continuity or pur­poseful syncretism as more plausible interpretations ofaHolyWeek rite than acculturationorlocalization within aglobal religion. 
Following theintroduction, the.rsttwo chapters describe precolumbian world renewal ceremonies in lowland Yucatan and the Maya Highlands. These descriptions arederived primarily fromthe accounts of colonial Spanish clergymen, supplemented by colonial Mayan language texts and interpretations of precolumbian iconography.The author admirably assembles and discusses selections from the reports of numerous missionary priests, especially for the Highlands. These works, by the likes of Las Casas, Remesal and Vico, are not widely available in

English translation, and the author does an excellent job of locating each work within the missionaries’ biographies. 
Howthissubstantial documentarymaterialisana­lyzed is problematic at times, with colonial reports of Maya belief and practice not subjected to ade­quate criticism. For example, we are told that “in thelatePost-Classic(AD 1250–1524), cross-shaped tree stones called yax che’el kab (.rst tree of the world) weresetupas markers” (52).AlthoughMaya cosmological tree symbolismdates back to Preclassic times,the term yax che’elkab does not appear in the known epigraphicrecord.Ratheritappearsincolonial documents, especially Christiantexts whereitisthe Tree of Eden (e.g. Mark Christensen’s The Teabo Manuscript 2016, 50).Eventhe ceiba tree(yax che) of theDresden CodexNewYear’s pagesisjust one of many different kinds of trees associated with the cardinaldirectionsin colonialMaya ritualtexts.Over thepastdecade, ethnohistorianshavedocumentedjust how extensive and subtle the impact of the Spanish colonial project was on Maya space, conduct, and even language (e.g., Hanks’ 2010 work Converting Words). Among contemporary ethnohistorians, most arguments of historical continuity require a more explicit critical apparatus than Christenson’s work provides here. 
The third chapter explores a linkage between the timingofSpanish military campaigns andEaster, fol­lowedbyafourth chapteronaccountsofpost-conquest world renewal ceremonies. Christenson argues that the Maya interpreted the Spanish conquest much like the period endings of the indigenous calendar and “as a result, Easter came to replace the ancient MayaWayeb’ observancesasthefocusfor ceremonies meant to regenerate the world” (111). Given the importance ofthe ancient calendars from the earliest epigraphicrecordstocontemporaryK’iche’ ajq’ijab’, manyMayanistswouldexpectasubstantivediscussion ofthesyncretismoftheindigenous calendarswiththe SpanishChristian ones.IfWayeb’ rites weremerged with Easter, one couldbe(andindeed would need tobe)veryprecise about when this occurred. Thisis because Easterisamoveable feast, andsoHolyWeek rarelyoverlapswiththe.ve“nameless”daysofMayan language speaking groups’ calendars. In Breath on theMirror (1993:221–222), DennisTedlock notes this correlation possibly occurred in the late eighteenth century.Surprisingly,Christenson’sargument focuses almostexclusively on theSpanish Christiandatesof conquest and early Colonial-era events, after which “theMaya probablyadoptedtheChristiansymbolof thecross willinglyasa symbolofregenerationthat.t wellwith theirown indigenous beliefs” (127).Ifinthe aftermathof military conquest theWayeb’rites were replacedby Easterregardlessofthelatter’sdateinthe ancient calendar,woulditnotbe bettertocharacterize this transition as acculturation or localization rather than syncretism? 
Although his principal argument is a historical one, over half of Christenson’s work is an excel­lent ethnography of Santiago Atitlán’s Holy Week rites based on the author’s decades of research in highlandGuatemala.Chapters.ve through nine each describe and analyze the Tz’utujil ceremonies of a different weekday(MondaytoFriday), witha.nal tenthchapterdevotedtothe aftermathofHolyWeek and concluding remarks. The lore of contemporary traditionalists surrounding RilajMamin Christenson’s narrative and photographs are among the most evoca­tive descriptions of these rites ever published. The analysis, however, is more problematic. When the author assertsthat one elementoranotherofmodern Tz’utujil ritesare “related”(301)or “analogous”(311) to the Dresden Codex New Year’s pages or Bishop Landa’s accounts of Maya rituals in Yucatan four centuries earlier, what is meant here? The structure of the book suggests direct historical continuity, but in most cases the reader is provided intimation rather thanevidence. Theincompleteness of the epigraphic andhistorical record maymakethis unavoidable,but thelackofanexplicit theoryof syncretism limitsthe plausibilityof theclaimsofthisambitiouswork.
