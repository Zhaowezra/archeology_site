THE TERMINAL FORMATIVE TO CLASSIC PERIOD OBSIDIAN 
ASSEMBLAGE AT PALO ERRADO, VERACRUZ, MEXICO 

Charles L. F. Knight and Michael D. Glascock 
Abbreviated Neutron Activation Analysis (NAA) was carried out on a sample of obsidian artifacts from the Terminal For­mative to early Late Classic period site of Palo Errado, located in the southern Gulf lowlands of Veracruz, Mexico. Our understanding of Classic period obsidian economies in the southern Gulf lowlands has been largely informed by studies of the political economies of the highland Mexican cities of Teotihuacan and Cantona, which appear to have controlled the Pachuca and Otumba, and Zaragoza-Oyameles obsidian sources, respectively. However, the NAA results from Palo Errado indicate that while the local obsidian economy was dominated by prismatic blade technology utilizing Zaragoza-Oyameles obsidian, five additional highland Mexican sources were used during the Early Classic period. The presence of Ucareo and the use of Otumba in core-blade reduction, for instance, set Palo Errado apart from contemporary sites in the southern Gulf lowlands. Temporal variation in quantity of supplemental obsidian sources and their use in different 
reduction technolo­gies suggest that consumers at Palo Errado had access to abundant Zaragoza-Oyameles obsidian of a quality high enough to facilitate the production of fine prismatic blades. At the same time, however, they continued to participate in exchange networks that tied them to other areas of central Mexico, independently from other contemporaneous sites in the southern Gulf lowlands.

La idea persistente sabre la economfa de la obsidiana en la Costa Sur del Golfo durante el Perfodo Cldsico, es que esta estuvo ligada a las econom(as poUticas de las ciudades serranas de Teotihuacdn y Cantona, que aparentemente con­trolaban las fuentes de obsidiana de Pachuca y Otumba, y Zaragoza-Oyameles, respectivamente. Los resultados del Andlisis de Activaci6n de Neutrones de la muestra de Palo Errado indican que aunque en la economia local de la obsidiana dominaba la tecnologfa de navajas prismdticas fabricadas con obsidiana de lafuente de Zaragoza-Oyameles, tambien se utilizaba obsidi­ana proveniente de cinco fuentes adicionales de la Sierra durante el Perfodo Cldsico Temprano. La presencia de obsidiana proveniente de Ucareo y el uso de obsidiana proveniente de Otumba en tecnologfa prismdtica, par ejemplo, situan a Palo Errado aparte de otros sitios contempordneos en la Costa Sur del Golfo. La variaci6n temporal en cuanto a la cantidad de fuentes adi­cionales de obsidiana en uso, y el uso del material proveniente de estas bajo diversas tecnologfas lfticas, sugiere que las habi­tantes de Palo Errado tuvieron acceso abundante a obsidiana de alta calidad proveniente de la fuente de Zaragoza-Oyameles. Al mismo tiempo, sin embargo, la participaci6n en redes de intercambio que las conectaron a otras areas de Mexico central se mantuvo independientemente de la participaci6n de otras localidades contempordneas en la Costa Sur del Golfo.

logical analysis provides key insights into the nature of the obsidian economy at the Terminal Forma­tive to early Late Classic period site of Palo Errado, located in the southern Gulflowlands of Veracruz, Mexico (Figure 1). 
Obsidian tool production, consumption, and distribution are salient avenues for addressing questions of obsidian economies in the southern Gulf lowlands for several reasons. First, obsid­ian is the primary material of chipped tool assem­blages there during the entire prehispanic period. Regionally, fine-grained stone was exceedingly scarce, fostering a heavy reliance on imported obsidian. Although Palo Errado is located near the western slopes of Cerro El Vigia in the Sierra de los Tuxtlas, Kruzcynski's (2001) survey of basalt exploitation in the area indicates that this common local source was used for different tasks than those of obsidian. Second, elites in ritual contexts (Clark 1987; Co bean et al. 1971, 1991) and non-elites in domestic activities (Heller and Stark 1998; Santley et al. 2001) used obsidian tools. Third, archaeologists have replicated for­mal and informal tool manufacture allowing for the identification of tools, the debitage produced, and their placement in the reduction sequence (Clark 1982, 1997; Clark and Bryant 1997; Crab­tree 1968; Hirth and Andrews 2002; Hirth et al. 2006). Quarry studies at major obsidian sources are beginning to outline variations in obsidian extraction and initial reduction (Daneels and Pas­trana 1988; Darras 1999; Healan 1997; Pastrana and Gomez 1988). Finally, chemical analyses like Instrumental Neutron Activation Analysis (INAA), X-ray Fluorescence (XRF), and laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spec­trometry (LA-ICP-MS) facilitate the identifica­tion of obsidian sources, providing a means of tracking the distribution of obsidian throughout the Mesoamerican world (Carballo et al. 2007; Glascock et al. 1994; Pires-Fereirra 1976; Ren­frew et al. 1968). This study presents source data on a sample of obsidian artifacts using abbrevi­ated Neutron Activation Analysis (NAA) and the resulting spatial and temporal consumption pat­terns at Palo Errado.

Background 
Palo Errado is located 10 km to the southwest of the town and archaeological center ofTres Zapotes, on the eastern levee of the Rfo Zapotal, which rep­resents the easternmost branch of the Rfo San Juan in the Papaloapan drainage system in Veracruz, Mexico (Figure 2). The site straddles the ecotone of the Papaloapan drainage system to the west and north, and the Sierra de los Tuxtlas to the east. This location would have provided its inhabitants with direct access to riverine and montane resources, including nonlocal goods, like obsidian. In fact, the valleys and streams of the Rios Papaloapan, Sal­ado, and Grande provide the most direct and grad­ual route between the southern Gulf lowlands, the Basin of Mexico, and the Valley of Oaxaca (Dren­nan et al. 1990: 197). 
Palo Errado was identified during the 1995 field season of the Recorrido Arqueol6gico de Tres Zapotes during a survey ahead of PEMEX (Petr6leos Mexicanos) oil line exploration (Leon Perez 2002; Pool 1997a). The site was subsequently investigated through systematic surface survey and excavation as part of Knight's (1999) doctoral dis­sertation. A two-tiered survey approach was adopted that combined systematic transect sam­pling and a full coverage survey, a strategy repli­cating that employed at Tres Zapotes (Pool and Ohnersorgen 2003). 
The distribution of surface artifacts correlated with elevated terraces adjacent to the Rfo Zapotal and several nearby in-filled channels. A discontin­uous distribution of surface artifacts and mounded architecture over a 28 ha area defines the site, while a continuous concentration of surface artifacts cov­ering 13 ha, associated with most mounded archi­tecture, defines the site core. In total, 13, 2-x-2 m and one, l-x-1 m test units were excavated (Fig­ure 3 ), resulting in an obsidian assemblage of 2,557

of alluvium, obscuring most of the Terminal For­mative and Early Classic period occupation. Tem­poral designations follow ceramic chronologies developed at the regional center of Tres Zapotes (Ortiz Ceballos 1975; Pool 2003) and from the site of Bezuapan in the Sierra de los Tuxtlas (Pool and Britt 2000). Fine orange ware was recovered throughout the occupation sequence at Palo Errado; however, it predominates during the Early Classic period. Relatively high proportions of polished black, red-on-orange slipped coarse brown, and differentially fired black-and-tan ceramics in the surface and excavated assemblages denote a Ter­minal Formative period occupation. An early Late Classic period occupation is inferred from a rela­tively high proportion of fine gray ware, but this fine gray ware does not predominate in the assem­blage, as observed in the Tuxtlas after A.D. 650 (Ortiz and Santley 1988; Pool and Britt 2000: 157). 
INAA Obsidian Sample 
Analyses of prehispanic obsidian assemblages else­where in the southern Gulf lowlands, such as in the Mixtequilla region of the Papaloapan drainage sys­tem (Hester, Heizer, and Jack 1971; Stark et al. 1992), the Sierra de los Tuxtlas (Barrett2003; Sant­ley et al. 2001), Tres Zapotes (Hester, Jack, and Heizer 1971; Knight 2003; Knight and Pool 2008), in the Chacalapan region (Esquivias 2003), and at San Lorenzo (Co bean et al. 1971, 1991) have typ­ically employed a combination of visual and chem­ical sourcing to understand obsidian distribution over space and through time. Although visual sourcing has been controversial in the Maya area due to the visual similarities of Guatemalan and central Mexican obsidians (Braswell et al. 1994, 2000; Moholy-Nagy and Nelson 1990; Sheets 1977; Smith and Schreiber 2005: 197), it has been successful in the southern Gulf lowlands, largely due to the fact that only a handful of visually dis­tinct obsidian sources were typically used. Subse­quent chemical analyses have supported these visual characterizations (Barrett 2003; Cobean et al. 1991; Heller and Stark 1998; Santley et al. 1997, 200 1; Stark et al. 1992). 
Obsidian artifacts from Palo Errado were clas­sified by the visual characteristics of transparency and translucency here referred to as "color." Three base color categories were identified: black, clear, and green, which correspond to visual designations used elsewhere in the southern Gulf lowlands (Bar­rett 2003; Cobean et al. 1991; Heller and Stark 1998; Pool 1997b; Santley et al. 2001; Stark et al. 1992). Color categories also were divided into nine "subcolors" that refer to secondary visual charac­teristics and account for the full range encountered in the analysis. These subcolor attributes are black, green, clear, clear with clouds, cloudy, banded, smoky, greenish gray, and brown. Thus, an exam­ple of a complete color designation would be "clear­clear with clouds," which was typical of Pico de Orizaba obsidian. During the analysis distinctive color patterns also were identified and noted. For example, dense, black cloudy blotches were observed in some of the gray-black samples. The presence and size of inclusions, type of surface tex ­ture, and other distinctive characteristics also were noted. 
After the initial visual classification, 100 obsid­ian artifacts (a .03 percent sample) were judgmen­tally selected for NAA at the Missouri University Research Reactor (MURR). A nonrandom sample was chosen to ensure that all visual categories were tested. This step was critical to the subsequent assignment of source location to all obsidian arti­facts from Palo Errado. Employing a nonrandom sampling strategy in cases where both visual and chemical sourcing methods were used has been a viable strategy for sourcing large quantities of obsidian artifacts in the southern Gulf lowlands (Santley et al. 2001). Blade fragments, blade pro­duction debitage and unidentified flakes, selected from unmixed proveniences stratified by natural and arbitrary strata in all but three excavation units were submitted for analysis. 
Samples were prepared by using a trim saw to remove a portion of the artifact. About l 00 mg of sample material was weighed into a clean poly­ethylene vial. The sample vials were irradiated in a neutron flux of 8x1013 n cm-2s-1 for five seconds then allowed to decay for 25 minutes before count­ing for 12 minutes on a high-purity germanium detector. The elements barium (Ba), chlorine (Cl), dysprosium (Dy), potassium (K), manganese (Mn), and sodium (Na) were generally measured, and the concentrations (in ppm) for each sample are pre­sented in Table 1. All unknowns were standardized by comparison to the standard reference material SRM-278 Obsidian Rock, which has been well
