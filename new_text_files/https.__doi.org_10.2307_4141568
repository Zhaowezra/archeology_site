LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 15, No. 1, 2004] 
lation of ancient Zapotec writing is presently unattain­able, Urcid has proposed important methodological considerations to understand the nature of the text. 
The methods he followed differ substantially from other researchers on the subject. First, he prioritized internal comparisons, using archaeological material with writing found in a localized region and attribut­able to a single system. He did so to avoid the problem of explaining phenomena from the perspective of sev­eral cultures. Second, he pulled together an impressive corpus of material, rendering 1,200 line drawings of artifacts with glyphs, from materials such as stone, bone, ceramics, and tomb murals. His meticulous and able documentation of these archaeological materials not only allowed him to clearly analyze the ancient forms and to make definitive statements regarding their variability, but also to comprehend the geographical extent and chronological depth of the script. Third, he built upon the work of the Mexican archaeologist Alfonso Caso, focusing on the calendar glyphs and assuming, as Caso did, a fundamental Mesoamerican unity in terms of the structure of the calendar. 
The first chapter reviews writing systems in order to place Zapotec script in a wider context, comparing it to writing in Mesoamerica as well as to writing in other parts of the world. Here the goal is to show us how the script might have worked within the framework of the native language. The author's premise is that the Zapotec writing system uses a combination of narra­tive pictography and logosyllabic signs, and that the arrangement of the glyphs reflects the syntax of the lan­guage. 
Chapter 2 critically evaluates previous attempts at the script's decipherment in terms of their pitfalls and successes. Since the groundbreaking work of Caso in 1928, surprisingly few advances had been made. Most attempts focused on reconstructing the ancient calen­dar, but these efforts failed to produce convincing results and largely disregarded Caso's earlier studies. For example, no one ventured to prove or disprove his iden­tification of the year bearers, a set of four glyphs marked with special signs that correspond to specific positions in the twenty-day list. Rather, new configurations of year bearers were proposed that in some cases ignored the basic structure of native time reckoning. As Urcid put it, although the great majority of authors were in agreement about the historical content of the inscrip­tions, they all disagreed over the nature of the Zapotec calendar, thus preventing them from comprehending those historical events. Because a basic understanding of native time reckoning is so important to the deci­pherment of the calendrical glyphs, at the beginning of Chapter 3 Urcid has included a skillful summary of the workings of the Mesoamerican calendar. 
The same chapter also deals with the primary source 
material on the Zapotec calendar in colonial times, the sixteenth-century works of Fray Juan de Cordova, Vocabulario and Arte en lengua rapoteca. Urcid uses the information from these sources in various ways, but his first concern is reconstructing the Zapotec day names, a task that has been attempted by many, includ­ing the erudite Mesoamericanist Eduard Seier. Deduc­ing the names of the Zapotec days is complicated because the appellatives Cordova records are contained in a perplexing series of 13 different words made up of prefixes and roots, and few clues are given as to how they should be read. lt has been assumed that the root form represents the name of the day and the prefix a cardinal number. Urcid's method for choosing a root form is based on orthographic similarity and the fre­quency the roots occur. However, this approach disre­gards the (sometimes radical) changes that can occur when a root is modified by a prefix. For example, he chooses the word laala as the root for the third day because it occurs more often in the corresponding list. He discounts Seler's choice for this day, the word guela (meaning "night" in Cordova), because it only occurs once. Thus Urcid does not take into account that the root for "night" is ela, and that laala may be a modifi­cation of this root with the prefix Laa. As a result of this strategy some of his identifications cause him prob­lems in Chapter 4, where he correlates his reconstruc­tion of the Zapotec calendar to the glyphs compiled from the archaeological materials. Fortunately, the over­all results of the extensive analysis in Chapter 4 are not compromised as he has attacked the problem of the day list order from different angles, carefully checking and refining his conclusions at the end of the section. Nonetheless, I feel that more focus on linguistic aspects would have greatly enhanced his analytical possibili­ties. 
Perhaps the most interesting section of the book is Chapter 5. Here the author conducts a contextual test and supplies hypothetical readings for the inscriptions using the identifications established in the previous chapter. The texts he chose for his test are inscribed on a number of monoliths from the South Platform of Monte Alban. Various authors have attempted to inter­pret these stones on the false assumption that they were found in a primary context. Urcid, on the other hand, has demonstrated that the stones were reused, and that at an earlier time many of the carvings originally formed a single narrative in a specific architectural context. He proceeds by reconstructing what he thinks this original layout would have been based on archaeological data. The analytical process he embarks on is truly exciting, as we see how the large irregular stones are at once transformed into the roof of a temple in the shape of a cross, with the inscriptions on the edges of the large slabs facing the inside of an open patio.

rative program in place, Urcid focuses on the patterns 
that emerge from the epigraphic contexts and is able to 
corroborate repetitions of calendrical and personal 
names in the various carved fragments. As a result, he 
adeptly confirms the logographic nature of the script, 
and at the same time shows us the value of under­
standing the original context of artifacts before we leap 
into an interpretative mode. 
The book is a revival of the author's 1992 doctoral 
thesis, with little modification of the academic struc­
ture required for a dissertation. Fortunately, Urcid's 
argumentation is seamless and his writing fluid, so this 
point is at once lost by the reader who has everything 
well explained and illustrated. In terms of structure, I 
would have preferred that the series of glyphs he has 
compiled for each day of the 20-day calendar be pre­
sented together in Appendix I, along with their sources. 
Having these illustrations dispersed throughout the 
book makes them harder to consult at a glance, and from 
an epigraphers point of view, an easily accessible dic­
tionary of glyphs is a useful tool. 
We still have a long way to go before Zapotec script 
is deciphered; however, Urcid has given us a solid foun­
dation upon which to build. He predicts that a future 
understanding of the script will require three levels of 
analysis: identifying the pictographic elements, decod­
ing the speech embedded in the glyphs, and then com­
prehending what the message means. His comparative 
and contextual method has shed a great deal of light on 
the first level; however, much work needs to be done 
before we can elucidate the encoded speech. My hope 
is that this superb book will inspire a new generation 
of epigraphers to unlock the ancient voices contained 
in those texts.

The authors of this volume had the charge to write a book that convincingly and compellingly documented what is known or understood about the engineered land­scape across ancient Mesoamerica immediately prior to the arrival of the Spanish in the early sixteenth cen­tury. The volume completes a trilogy examining the New World for this Oxford University Press series. The other two books with encyclopedic coverage are by William Doolittle (North America) and William Denevan (South America). Together, these books com­prise our most comprehensive record of Native Amer­ican agricultural practices concentrated in one set of volumes. As David Harris states in the foreword, "The unifying theme of this remarkable trilogy is its focus on the agricultural landscapes of the Americas 'on the eve of the conquest', and the scale and comprehen­siveness of the undertaking is enormously impressive." 
Mesoamerica can be viewed as a distinct subconti­nent in a manner not unlike India, except that the iso­lating barrier of the Himalayas is substituted by the arid Gran Chichimeca to the north and the triangular peninsular tip of Tamai-speaking southern India is exchanged for the constricting isthmus of lower Cen­tral America. When compared to the landmass of other continents to the north and south, Mesoamerica is indeed diminutive-but NOT in terms of biophysical and cultural diversity. Because of the convergence of sev­eral active tectonic plates and the uplifted Yucatan peninsular limestone, the environmental diversity and richness is great. When viewed as the land bridge between two continents, the complexity of both animal and plant associations is nearly as varied as the cultural adaptations human populations made to them. This book is about agricultural landscapes associated with settled populations, though it attempts to restrict itself to the Late Postclassic Period or the final chapter of indigenous development before the last half-a­millineum of global hybridity. 
The authors present a descriptive account of the var­ied multifunctional agricultural systems found in ancient Mesoamerica. They indicate the difficulties in attempting to categorize the variability, but provide a useful set of functional criteria for assessing the divi­sions offered. The five principal chapters of the book are each devoted to one of these agricultural adapta­tions. Arborculture and horticulture are the first treated and show the presence of a widespread and frequently more than supplemental food source, especially when cacao orchards were cultivated along the Xoconusco of coastal Chiapas and Guatemala. They also point to the long-term culling of non-economic plants from natural stands in producing an agroforestry of eatable and oth­erwise useful tree products and related flora particularly apparent in the Classic Period Maya Lowlands. 
Rainfed cultivation is described as the most com­monly employed agricultural practice and identified as either swidden, conuco, or temporal. Archaeological signatures for these three types of cultivation practices are frequently invisible, though conuco plots can involve considerable shallow mound preparation. The authors show that temporal cropping is a nearly annual activity for as many as 10 years when associated with root crops, like conuco use in the Antilles, but followed
