THE SQUARE-ROOM UNIT AS AN EMBLEM OFPOWER AND 
AUTHORITY WITHIN THE INITIAL PERIOD SECHIN ALTO POLITY, 
CASMA VALLEY, PERU 

Shelia Pozorski and Thomas Pozorski 
Some 3 ,500 years ago, the Sechfn Alto Polity built large, precisely planned cities, one of which contained the largest struc­tures in the New World at that time. Such accomplishments reflect strong, enduring leadership, and we propose that the power and leadership role of these leaders was tangibly manifested by a unique, widely used architectural element and by a related symbol within polity iconography. The distinctive architectural form is a free-standing module that is omnipresent in power loci: temple, palace, storehouse, mid-level administrative buildings, roadside structures, and a satellite site. We also interpret recurring symbols within Sechfn Alto Polity iconography as more abstract representations of this architec­tural form in its capacity as a power symbol. The essence of this "architecture of power" transcended time as the modular 
fiJYm was imitated by a subsequent polity.

D
uring the Initial Period (2150-1000 cal 
B .C .) along the north and central coasts of 
Peru, prehistoric peoples lived in dozens of sites that contain a variety of monumental con­structions, including large platform mounds, sunken circular courts, and rectangular plazas (Burger 1992; Pozorski and Pozorski 2008; Vega­Centeno et al. 1998). Some of these large con­structions, particularly on the central coast, may be the result of several minor construction episodes 

.. carried out over hundreds of years by relatively 
' 

small groups of people (Burger 1987, 1992; Burger and Salazar-Burger 2008). However, much of the monumental architecture is the result of the efforts of more complex societies able to muster the cor­porate labor needed to build these structures in very large construction episodes over much shorter peri­ods of time (Pozorski and Pozorski 1992, 2005, 2008, 2012). Many Andean scholars envision Ini­tial Period monumental architecture as primarily ceremonial in nature (Kembel and Rick 2004; Moore 1996, 2005; Williams 1985), but excava­tions over the last 30 years in the Casma Valley have revealed abundant evidence that some of the large platform mounds were also used predominantly as storage facilities, as palaces, and as administrative loci (Pozorski and Pozorski 1997, 1999). In the Andes, political power and religious or ritual power were closely intertwined, making distinctions between the two somewhat artificial. Nevertheless, it is instructive to view these power bases on a con­tinuum because corresponding architecture can appear more ritual in nature or more administra­tive or secular in nature. For the purposes of this

paper and to elucidate the function of the square­room unit, we have emphasized archaeological and architectural evidence that lies toward the secular along this continuum. An integral part of the plans of these platform mounds at several sites in the Casma Valley is a modular architectural form called a square-room unit. The standardized layout of the square-room units strongly supports the idea that a highly centralized society was responsible for their construction in the same manner that the cen­tralized societies of the later Wari and Chimu cul­tures were responsible for the standardized architecture present at Wari and Chimu adminis­trative centers (Andrews 1974; Day 1982; Isbell 1989, 2006, 2008; Jennings 2006; Keatinge and Conrad 1983; Schreiber 1992). 
Definition and Possible Origins of the Square-Room Unit 

The square-room unit was first recognized at the Initial Period (2150-1000 cal B.C.) site of Pampa de las Llamas-Moxeke in the Casma Valley of Peru (Pozorski and Pozorski 1989, 1991, 1992, 1993,

l 994a, l 994b). It is also present at contemporary sites, which, together with Pampa de las Llamas­Moxeke, comprise the Sechfn Alto Polity (Figure 1) (Pozorski and Pozorski 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2005, 2006). The widespread occurrence of this special modular architectural form in various administrative contexts and its persistence through time have led us to conclude that the significance of the square-room unit extends beyond its func­tion as an architectural form to a symbolic role rep­resenting the power and authority of the leaders of the Sechfn Alto Polity of the Casma Valley. 

Each square-room unit is generally square in shape, with rounded exterior comers and square or rounded interior comers (Figure 2). Typically, the architecture of a square-room unit is made of angu­lar boulders and cobbles set in silty clay mortar and covered with fine clay plaster. The topmost meter of construction material may consist of conical adobes. Nine to 16 wall niches are present some 
1.2 to 2 m above the floor, which is typically car­peted with reed matting. Access is usually by way of two opposing doorways with raised thresholds, a pair of opposing pilasters that narrow the entrance, and a sliding wooden bar closure mechanism to restrict access. This bar-closure mechanism con­sists of a pair of niches in the entrance walls, one relatively short, about 30 cm, and the other long, measuring 200 cm or more depending on the width of the entrance. These niches were designed to house a long wooden pole that rested within the long niche and could be drawn across the entrance to rest in the short niche and block access (Pozorski and Pozorski 1986:Figure 8, 1992:854-855, l 994a:53-54). 

The square-room units at Sechfn Alto Polity sites tend to be overbuilt, in the same manner as the mounds upon which these units rest. SechfnAlto Polity Initial Period sites have long been recognized as settlements that contain huge monumental con­structions, including the main mound at Sechfn Alto, which, measuring 300 m x 250 m x 35 m tall and containing an estimated 2,000,000 m3 of fill, is the largest mound construction in the New World for its time period (Pozorski and Pozorski 1992, 2005, 2012). As critical components occupying the summits of mounds at these sites, the square-room units are, of course, smaller, but they are still impressive in size. The largest examples measure some 19 m across and have walls 2-2.5 m thick that were originally 4-7 m tall. The Sechin Alto Polity mounds with their square-room units are

clear examples of the type of conspicuous con­
sumption through labor expenditure that is typical 
of many prehistoric complex societies around the 
world (Trigger 1990). 
The standardized layout of the square-room unit 
is highlighted further because each maintains its 
integrity as a distinct modular architectural unit 
within multiroom complexes. For example, on the 
summit of Huaca A (Figure 3), each square-room 
unit is a free-standing module; and, when one mod­
ule occurs adjacent to another, the two are separated 
by a narrow space. Square-room units never share 
bonded wall joins with adjacent architecture 
although walls of architecture that do not form 
square-room units may abut the outside of square­

room unit modules in a perpendicular or tangential 
manner. Furthermore, square-room units are con­
sistently situated in a precise, symmetrical manner 
in whatever context they appear. Square-room-unit 
modules on top of Huaca A at Pampa de las Lla­
mas-Moxeke exhibit both four-way symmetry and 
clear grouping by size and location. Single well-built 
examples of square-room units also occur on top of 
the smaller, intermediate-size mounds at Pampa de 
las Llamas-Moxeke and at other Sechin Alto Com­
plex sites. These modules are always centrally 
located, with lesser walls of adjacent rooms abut­
ting the exterior of the central modular unit. The 
inhabitants of Sechin Alto Polity Initial Period sites 
clearly knew about shared-wall construction 
because they employed this technique to construct 
domestic architecture and non-square-room-unit 

architecture on intermediate-size mounds (Figures 
4 and 5). These data indicate that the square-room 
unit was very special in its own right, and we would 

argue that its integrity was maintained throughout various architectural settings because its form was symbolically very important to the leaders of the society who had it constructed. 
It is also important to attempt to trace the source of the square-room-unit architectural form that attained such prominence within the Sechfn Alto Polity. Recent excavations at the Late Preceramic (3000-2150 cal B.C.) site of Caral in the Supe Val­ley has revealed various forms of public architec­ture but nothing resembling the square-room architectural modular unit (Shady 2004, 2007; Shady and Leyva 2003). Instead, its roots may lie in the ceremonial architecture of the Mito Tradi­tion (Bonnier 1997) that forms part of the Kotosh Religious Tradition as defined by Burger and Salazar-Burger (1980, 1985). MitoTradition archi­tecture is present at the Late Preceramic highland centers ofKotosh, Piruru, and La Galgada. During the Mito phase at the site of Kotosh, architecture there was characterized by free-standing rooms with prominent wall niches that also contain what Bonnier describes as a "two-level floor altar" along with a central hearth with subfloor ventilation shafts (Bonnier 1997:129-140; Izumi and Terada 1972: 132-176). Such structures are generally inter-. 
preted as special ritual chambers for small groups 
· 

of people. At both Kotosh and the contemporane­ous site of Piruru, these ritual structures are rec­tangular in layout without any round-cornered architecture. Rooms excavated at La Galgada more closely resemble the Sechin Alto Polity square­room-unit modules because of their rounded shape. wall niches, and distribution across the mound sur­face as independent modules (Grieder and Bueno Mendoza 1988:32-39, Figures 26, 27, and 32). Nevertheless, despite some similarities, structures of the Mi to variant of the Kotosh Religious Tradi­tion differ significantly from Sechfn Alto Polity square-room-unit forms because they contain cer­emonial hearths at their centers, usually with accompanying ventilation shafts, set in two-level floor altars. Similar ventilated hearth structures are known from both Sechfn Alto Polity sites and ear­lier preceramic sites in the Casma Valley area, but none is associated with niched, modular rooms (Pozorski and Pozorski 1996). Assuming that ele­ments of Sechfn Alto Polity architecture were indeed inspired by the Mito Tradition, component elements were apparently interpreted differently as they became incorporated into the coastal polity. SechfnAlto Polity structures with ventilated hearths and their antecedents, as exemplified by Late Pre­ceramic Huaynuna (Pozorski and Pozorski 1990:19-21), stayed small and were clearly the loci of small-scale rituals involving relatively few people. Most of the Casma area ventilated hearths also occur within small circular structures (Pozorski and Pozorski 1996), thereby closely resembling the circular ventilated hearth structures at the Late Preceramic site of Cara! (Shady 2004:112-114, 230-232, 2007:42-43, 46-47; Shady et al. 2003), and this precocious coastal zone may be the source of these ideas.

The Square-Room Unit at Pampa de las Llamas-Moxeke 

Excavations at the inland site of Pampa de las Lla­mas-Moxeke led to the recognition of the square­room-unit architectural form and began to clarify its function (Pozorski and Pozorski 1992). This site is the main Sechfn Alto Polity site within the Casma branch of the river. It consists of two principal mounds, Huaca A and Moxeke, which face each other across a series of plazas and thereby estab­lish the axis of the site. Rows of intermediate-sized mounds and more scattered compounds conform to the site-axis orientation, and most rows of mounds face the site center. High-status residen­tial architecture near the intermediate-sized mounds also follows the N41°E orientation established by the principal mounds. This elite architecture is also characterized by high stone walls and features such as hearths that are large and well made. In contrast, 
the lower-status residential architecture is irregu­lar in size, shape, and orientation. Walls were of predominantly perishable materials and internal features are small. 
Jn the course of clearing rooms on Huaca A, we were astonished to realize that most of the "mean­ingful" rooms there consisted of free-standing mod­ular units which we named square-room units (Figures 3 and 4). Thirty-eight examples of this architectural form are present along with 39 "neg­ative rooms" formed by divisions of space left among the modules. Clearly, the integrity of the square-room unit was critical, making building more labor intensive because the people rejected shared-wall construction. Numerous examples exist where adjacent square-room unit exterior walls are within centimeters of each other, com­plete with well-plastered exterior walls so closely spaced that we wonder how finishing plaster was applied. 
We believe that the square-room unit modules on Huaca A served a storage function, and this has led us to describe the mound as a huge warehouse where valuables, especially comestibles, were kept in reserve against times of famine (Pozorski and

Figure 5. Plan of area east of Huaca A at Pampa de las Llamas showing square-room units as (a) compounds adjacent to Huaca A, (b) central rooms on top of intermediate-sized mounds, and (c) central room for an administrative structure within the zone of domestic architecture and loci of cottage industry. 
Pozorski 1991). This interpretation is based on the contents of the many niches and rooms excavated. Pollen from the niches and square-room unit floors 
documented the presence of lima and common beans, cotton, sweet potato, peanuts, potatoes, and avocado. Significantly, several of these plants (e.g., lima beans and potato) are characterized by pollen that is not easily spread, making the presence of their pollen especially strong evidence that the plants were present. Bones of over 1,000 rats and mice (Oryzomys sp. and Phyllotis sp.), including many whole articulated skeletons, were also pre­sent in the niches and on room floors, indicating that problems with these pests were endemic. Pre­sumably there to feast on food reserves, these rodents died in situ once the site was abandoned. Finally, some niches contained fragments of cloth. This may indicate storage of cloth and/or storage of food species or other valuables in cloth con­tainers. The construction of square-room unit mod­ules on Huaca A left negative spaces which were divided into rooms that tended to be long and nar­row and served as access corridors. The floors of these nonmodular areas were not carpeted and occasionally showed wear from foot traffic. 
Square-room units also occur in several other contexts at Pampa de las Llamas-Moxeke. Rem­nants of what was likely a square-room unit form the central room of the Moxeke mound, the other main mound at the site. We believe Moxeke served a predominantly religious function because its huge friezes, once 3 m tall, likely represent deities or elite people associated with deities (Pozorski and Pozorski 1999:95; Tello 1956:60-66, Figure 25). These friezes would have been clearly visible to large groups of people who filled the many large plazas associated with this mound. Although its function is very different from Huaca A, the pres­ence of the square-room unit at Moxeke's center connects this mound with Huaca A and attests to the modular room's association with power and authority at the site. 

Scattered within the space on either side of Huaca A, the structures closest to this mound are seven compounds composed of free-standing square-room units (Figure Sa; Pozorski and Pozorski 1994a:53-55, Figures 2 and 5). Our exca­vations confirmed the presence of wall niches and sliding bar closure mechanisms within these struc­tures, making it clear that these structures are square-room unit modules. We have interpreted these compounds as comprising one level in the administrative hierarchy at Pampa de las Llamas­Moxeke. Because of their proximity to Huaca A

and their arrangement surrounding this mound, we 
believe they served to monitor the flow of goods 
to and from the Huaca A storehouse (Pozorski and 
Pozorski 1991:351). 
The intermediate-sized mounds at Pampa de las 
Llamas-Moxeke, taken as a group, contain even 
more square-room units than Huaca A. Each inter­
mediate-sized mound is like a miniature version of 
Huaca A, with a central staircase, an atrium, wing 
rooms alongside the atrium, and a single square­
room unit as its central room (Figures 4, 5b, and 
6). At least 86 of these modules have been counted 
within the 100 intermediate-sized mounds that lie 
outside cultivation, and it is estimated that the 
remainder of the site would have contained at least 
30 additional mounds with square-room units at 
their centers. Most are arranged in rows, oriented 
in accord with the site axis and facing toward the 
site center; and spatially they lie nearer the site 
periphery than the compounds that surround Huaca 

A. These mounds also likely functioned adminis­tratively, possibly as a second administrative tier to monitor goods moving to and from Huaca A or possibly to monitor goods entering the site from specific locations within the valley (Billman 1989). Several mounds in the northwest and southeast por­tions of the site are not aligned with the site axis, but instead face roads entering the site from these directions (Figure 6). This orientation toward roads provides additional evidence that at least some intermediate-sized mounds served to regulate inter­site movement of goods (Pozorski and Pozorski 1991:354-355: Figures 6 and 7). Partial clearing of 17 intermediate-sized mounds revealed neither evidence of habitation (e.g., kitchen areas) nor evi­dence of ceremonial activities (e.g., friezes, venti­lated hearths). Among the few diagnostic artifacts associated with intermediate-sized mounds at Pampa de las Llamas-Moxeke are fragments of ceramic stamp and cylinder seals (Pozorski and Pozorski 1986) which could have served an admin­istrative purpose much like stamp and cylinder seals did in the ancient Near East (Collon 1990: 11). 
At least two square-room units are also present among the irregularly oriented structures that com­prise the lower-status residential architecture at Pampa de las Llamas-Moxeke. A full-sized admin­istrative structure east of HuacaAlikely functioned administratively to oversee the local cottage indus­try through which products such as textiles and 
stone mortars and pestles were fabricated (Figure 
5c). Cotton textile production was especially 
important and is reflected by the presence of raw 
cotton, spun cotton, spindle whorls, and twined and 
woven cloth. 
A detailed analysis of the square-room units at 
Pampa de las Llamas-Moxeke reveals a remark­
able degree of uniformity of construction (Table I). 
Examination of Table I and Figure 7 show that 
excavated rooms have internal dimensions that are 
within 25 cm or less of being true squares. Survey. 
data based on surface evidence are somewhat less ­
precise because the measurements come from 
eroded wall tops instead of room floors. Never­
theless, the recorded survey measurements reveal 
rooms that are usually within 50 cm of perfect 
squares. 

Specific features of the excavated square-room units are also quite consistent in their dimensions. Most of the data on wall niches come from rooms on the summit of Huaca A. Within individual rooms, niche width and depth mainly vary± I 0 cm. As one might expect, absolute niche width varies in approximate proportion to the size of the room where the niches are present. Rooms with internal length and width dimensions of about 6.5 m have niches that are 95 ± 5 cm wide. Those rooms inter­nally measuring 8-I2 .5 m across have niches about 130 ± 10 cm wide. Rooms with internal measure­ments of I 9+ m have niches approximately 160 ± 10 cm wide. A number of rooms do have niches with widths that fall outside the normal range for their respective room sizes. However, these niches are consistently located in the same wall(s) as the entrance(s). Apparently niche width in walls con­taining entrances was adjusted to accommodate both the entrance width and the resultant reduced number of niches within that wall. Absolute niche depth also increases, though on a lesser scale, with room size. Niches in rooms 5-8 m across have median depths of 40 ± I 0 cm, niches in rooms mea­suring 8-12.5 m across have median depths of 55 
± 10 cm, and niches in rooms measuring 13+ m across have median depths of 60 ± 20 cm. 
Ample data are available for entrances to square­room units, including 22 examples from Huaca A, three examples from compounds near Huaca A. and 28 examples from intermediate-size mounds. For the sample as a whole, entrances to the rooms range from 100 to 245 cm wide, have step-up

thresholds 15-52 cm high, and typically have a pair of pilasters that narrow the entrance width. Like the niche widths and depths described above, variations in entrance width generally correspond with room size. For rooms internally measuring 5-8 m across, entrance width clusters around 145 ± 10 cm; for rooms 8-12 m across, a majority of entrances are 165 ± 10 cm wide; and for rooms 12+ m across, the median width of entrances increases to 175 ± 10 cm. Nevertheless, deviations from these median widths do occur. For example, seven entrances with widths of 100-105 cm are present within intermediate size mound rooms measuring less than 6 m across to over 12 m across. Even tak­ing into account exceptions, however, consistency in measurements would seem to be the norm. This is reflected at an intersite level because the two entrances exposed at Taukachi-Konkan fall squarely within the median widths noted at Pampa de las Llamas-Moxeke. 
The height of step-up thresholds is consistent within the square-room units regardless of room size. Over 85 percent of the examples measured 30 ± 10 cm tall. We have less data on sliding bar closure mechanisms because their presence depends on preserved wall height. Where entrance walls are preserved to a sufficient height, holes for sliding bar closures are always found. In no case could we unequivocally rule out the presence of sliding bar closure holes. In preserved examples, the height from the entrance floor to the bottom of a sliding bar closure hole ranges from 27 to 144 cm; therefore, even in cases where entrance walls are preserved to a height of 80+ cm, it would still be possible for sliding bar closure holes to have been present at one time. In preserved examples of sliding bar closure holes, there is a correlation between the height of these holes and the size of the corresponding room. For rooms 6--8 m across, the median sliding bar closure height is 50 ± I 0 cm above its associated entrance floor. For rooms 8-12 m across, the median height increases to 70 ± 10 cm. For rooms 12+ m across, the median height is 80 ± 20 cm. 

Square-room units at Pampa de las Llamas­Moxeke are closely associated with structures that we have interpreted as centers of power for the rul­ing elite. These include the two largest mounds at the site, the compounds around Huaca A, and over a hundred intermediate-sized mounds. Structures with square-room units tend to be well made, well finished with fine plaster, and clean. Virtually all these buildings conform to the orientation of the site axis defined by Moxeke and Huaca A or are oriented toward roads. Furthermore, component square-room-unit modules tend to be especially well constructed, have thicker walls compared to other architecture within the same structure, and consistently occupy central positions of promi­nence within their respective structures. Based on these data, we conclude that the square-room-unit modules functioned as symbols of power both at Pampa de las Llamas-Moxeke and, more broadly. within the greater Sechfn Alto Polity where they also uniformly occur in formal contexts. 
Square-room Unit Architecture in the Sechin Alto Complex 
The center of the Sechfn Alto Polity lies within the Sechfn Alto Complex in the Sechfn branch of the Casma River. We have previously grouped four Initial Period sites (SechfnAlto, Taukachi-Konkan. Sechfn Bajo, Cerro Sechfn) into the Sechfn Alto Complex (Figure 1) because of their coincident orientation and similar architecture (Pozorski and Pozorski 1987:82). These sites, and the interven­ing space that was likely once covered with culti­vated fields, houses, and small mounds, cover 10 km2• The square-room unit architectural form is known from all four Sechfn Alto Complex sites. 
The best-preserved examples of square-room units we excavated are at Taukachi-Konkan in the northern part of the complex. This site is dominated by a large mound at its west end that establishe the site axis. Unlike Huaca A and Moxeke, this mound is interpreted as a palace because its sum­mit contains both public and residential areas (Pozorski and Pozorski l 998:Figure 3b, l 999:Fig­ure 6). The public area is clean, symmetrical, well plastered, and roofed, with formal areas suitable for receiving important visitors. In contrast, the resi­dential area is irregularly laid out, with sleeping and sitting platforms as well as food remains. 
The adaptability of the square-room unit mod­ule is clear in the examples from the public area of Taukachi-Konkan. Within the formal palace area are square-room units identical to those of Huaca A that were also likely used for storage-in this case for goods given and received in the course of audi-
