Thesiteof Izapa, though famous for its unique “Izapan” style monuments, haslaggedbehind many otherMesoamerican centers in archaeological research. As revisions of important Mesoamerican chronologies are underway, Inomata and colleagues(2014)have questionedwhether monumentproductionatIzapa has been misplacedchronologically.Thisarticle applies new datafromthe Izapa HouseholdArchaeologyProject to assess Inomata and colleagues’(2014)proposal fora shiftinthechronologyatIzapa.It speci.cally assessesthechronologyfortheFormativeto ClassicperiodtransitionatIzapa, from100BCtoAD400,withnewexcavationdata,ceramiccross-dating,and BayesianmodelingofAMSdatesfromthe southern peripheryofthesite.These datagenerally supportthechronologydevelopedbyGareth Lowe followingthe 1960s excavations at thesite,thougha temporaloverlap appears possiblefor theTerminalFormative Hato and Itstapa ceramic complexes.Althoughresultsdo not supportInomata and colleagues’proposal fora shiftin theIzapachronology, ceramic cross-tiesproposed betweentheHatophaseatIzapaandtheVerbenaphaseatKaminaljuyu supportInomataand colleagues’ (2014)revisionfor thechronology ofKaminaljuyu.

C
hronology is the foundation of the .eld of archaeology. Without an underlying understanding of the time frame in which ancient groups lived, it becomes impossible to draw conclusions about how past cultures developed and interacted. For this reason, it is important to update long-established chronolo­gies with new data. In Mesoamerica, after years of relying on chronologies developed by early archaeologists, we are going back to the draw­ing board. With the bene.t of modern excava­tion techniques and improved absolute dating methods, several critical chronologies and their associations with neighboring regions are cur­rently being tested (Bachand 2008;Ball 
2014; 
Cowgill 2015; 
Inomata 
et al. 2014). 
Recent 
changes and re.nements often have great impli­cations for the cultural processes these chronolo­gies were once used to support. 
The chronology of Izapa, an early urban center located on the southern Paci.c coast of Mexico

one long-standing chronology that has received little modi.cation since its establishment. The site is best known as the home of the “Izapan” art style (Guernsey 2006;Loweetal. 
1982). 
Both the site of Izapa and its characteristic art style have often been hailed as a critical link between the Olmec and the Maya cultures (e.g., Coe 1962:100). 
Although 
the 
art 
of 
Izapa 
has received much attention, the archaeology of the site has lagged behind many regions of Mesoamerica. The ceramic chronology for Izapa was developed by Gareth Lowe following his excavations with the New World Archaeological Foundation (NWAF) in the 1960s (Lowe et al. 1982) 
and 
has 
received 
little 
modi.cation 
since 
(but 
see 
Lowe 
et 
al. 
[2013] 
for 
minor 
changes). 

In contrast, the neighboring city of Kami­naljuyu, another early urban center that shared the Izapan art style, has recently undergone a major chronological revision by Inomata and colleagues 
(2014). 
They 
propose 
that 
parts 
of 
the 
ceramic chronology of Kaminaljuyu, and other linked chronologies, must be shifted forward in time by approximately 300 years. Because Kaminaljuyu and Izapa share similar monu­ments, one question raised by the study was whether or not the chronology of Izapa and its associated monument production needs to be shifted to correspond with the now later date for the Kaminaljuyu monuments (Inomata and Henderson 2016). 

As part of their proposal, Inomata and col­leagues point out that a comparable change in ceramic chronology at Izapa could indicate that Izapa succumbed to the same patterns of rise and fall as sites like Kaminaljuyu (Inomata et al. 2014:398–399). 
During 
their 
discussion 
of ceramic cross-dating with other regions, they raise the possibility that the Guillen phase at Izapa, the period in which Izapan low relief monuments were reportedly erected (Lowe et al. 1982), 
currently 
dated 
to 
300–100 
BC 
(Lowe

et al. 2013), 
should 
be 
shifted 
later 
in 
time, 
to 
after 100 BC. Inomata and colleagues observe that ceramics for the Guillen phase share similar everted rim forms with Istmo/Ix phase vessels of Chiapa de Corzo and the Upper Grijalva region, which date to approximately AD 100–250 (Ino­mata et al. 2014:398–399). 
They 
also 
point 
to 
changing censer styles as another possible means of dating the monuments, observing that spiked censers, 
which 
Lowe 
(1965) 
dates 
to 
the 
Guillen 
phase at Izapa, date to the “early Protoclassic” period in neighboring regions (Inomata et al. 2014:399). 
Finally, 
Inomata 
and 
colleagues 
raise 
the possibility that Burial 30e-1, an interment previously dated to the Frontera-Guillen transi­tion at Izapa (Lowe et al. 1982:129, 
Figure 
7.9), 
contains “early Protoclassic” features such as a spiked censer and a vessel with nubbin feet (Inomata et al. 2014:399). 
They 
propose 
that 
this 
burial may, in fact, date to after 100 BC. Inomata and 
colleagues 
(2014) 
propose 
that, 
when 
taken 
together, these observations may necessitate a later beginning to the Guillen phase in the Izapa chronology. 
If 
Inomata 
and 
colleagues’ 
(2014) 
proposed 
changes to the Izapa ceramic chronology were correct, the famous Izapan tradition of low relief monuments would not represent the stylistic bridge between Olmec and Maya cultures fre­quently attributed to them. Izapa would, instead, be one of many sites where low relief sculpture depicting images of divine rulers were adopted at this time. Moreover, if the chronology is correct, residents of Izapa may have emerged as early leaders in the practice of erecting stone stelae and altar pairs. Would a revised chronology at Izapa suggest the same patterns of growth and decline as other centers in the “Southern Maya area” (Love and Kaplan 2011)? 
Or 
is 
it 
unique? 

Here, new data are presented from deposits at the southern periphery of Izapa recovered in 2014 by the Izapa Household Archaeology Project (IHAP). The IHAP excavations represent the .rst screened excavations of a peripheral zone at the site. They provided the unexpected opportunity to test the chronology of the For­mative to Classic period transition at Izapa (100 BC–AD 400). Ceramic cross-dating, AMS dates, and Bayesian statistical analysis suggest that the original chronology proposed by Lowe and colleagues 
(1982, 
2013) 
is 
still 
supported 
with 
data from recent excavations. The project also drew attention to a problematic portion of the Izapa chronology. The lack of de.nition for non-offering ceramics of the Terminal Formative1 
and Early Classic periods initially led to dif.culty documenting Hato (100 BC–AD 100), Itstapa (AD 100–250), and Jaritas (AD 250–400) phase occupation outside the site core. This problem was resolved over the course of the project by using ceramic cross-dating. Clark’s analysis of the nearby Mazatán materials (Clark and Cheetham 2005) 
proved 
particularly 
helpful 
for 
identifying local Terminal Formative ceramics at Izapa. 
Results 
support 
Lowe 
and 
colleagues’ 
(1982, 
2013) 
dating 
for 
the 
Hato 
and 
Jaritas 
phases, 
which anchor the Izapa chronology for the For­mative to Classic period transition. Inomata and colleagues’ 
(2014) 
proposal 
that 
the 
ceramics 
of the Guillen phase should be pushed forward in time is rejected. Ceramic cross-ties between the Hato phase at Izapa and the Verbena phase at Kaminaljuyu, however, appear to support Inomata 
and 
colleagues’ 
(2014) 
revision 
for 
the 
chronology of Kaminaljuyu. Results suggest that residents of Izapa participated in a widespread ceramic horizon from 100 BC–AD 100. The correlation between this horizon and the spread of the stelae-altar tradition, however, remains unclear. 
A Brief History of the Izapa Chronology 

The .rst excavations attempting to date Izapa were undertaken by Philip Drucker in 1947. Drucker excavated test pits in peripheral areas of the site, searching for unmixed ceramic deposits to place the site into a chronological sequence (Drucker 1948). 
He 
noted 
the 
abundance of plumbate and coarse-paste brown and black wares at the site but concluded that the temporal placement of Izapa could not yet be de.ned. 
The bulk of the archaeological research under­taken at Izapa was conducted in the 1960s by NWAF, directed by Gareth Lowe. The NWAF team meticulously mapped the site and con­ducted extensive excavations between 1961 and 1965. This research culminated in their 1982 site report (Lowe et al. 1982), 
which, 
while

comprehensive, was intended to be a preliminary summary of the excavation data. 
Of particular importance from the NWAF project at Izapa was the establishment of a ceramic chronology for the site. The Formative period ceramics (1900–100 BC) for Izapa were analyzed 
by 
Ekholm 
(1969) 
and 
Lowe 
(Lowe 
et al. 2013). 
The 
“Post-Formative” 
sequence 
at 
Izapa included all periods of occupation after the depopulation of the monumental core, the Itstapa through Remanso phases (AD 100–1000). It was documented 
by 
Lee 
(1973, 
n.d.) for the northern center, Group F. 
The missing piece of the Izapa chronology, the 
Hato 
phase, 
was 
de.ned 
by 
Lowe 
(1993; 
Lowe et al. 1982:135–147), 
who 
published 
the 
details of eight Hato phase urn burials2 
and associated offerings recovered from Group B. Although intrusive, the varied depths of these deposits and the temporally diagnostic forms and decorative motifs of the accompanying vessels were used to de.ne early and late subphases of the Hato phase ceramic complex (Lowe et al. 1982:135–147). 
Lowe 
and 
colleagues 
(1982:139, 194) cited the introduction of this urn burial custom and the associated interment of foreign ceramics as evidence for a major cultural shift, and possible conquest, at Izapa. They observed that this Hato phase shift was also accompanied by the interruption of building in the monumental center, initiation of construction activities in a new center to the north (Group F), and a cessation of the erection of stone monuments. 
To tie the Izapa chronology to other chronolo­gies of Mesoamerica, Lowe applied a horizon approach, searching for imported vessels and ceramic horizon markers at the site. This was .rst developed in the form of a working chart (Mendelsohn 2017:Table 
3.1), 
where 
Lowe 
plot­
ted important excavation contexts, their associ­ated horizon markers, local pottery wares, and suggested dates. This initial chart was developed in 1965, before the 14C dates were returned. By the time the 1982 Izapa report was produced, Lowe 
had 
further 
re.ned 
this 
sequence 
(Table 
1; 
Lowe et al. 1982:Table 
9.1). 

Of importance for the present discussion is the fact that no “typical Izapa pottery” was de.ned for the Terminal Formative Hato phase in the original 1965 chart (Mendelsohn 2017:Table 
3.1) 

or in subsequent publications (Lowe 1993;Lowe 
et al. 1982, 
2013). 
The 
de.nition 
of 
both 
early 
and late components of the Hato phase ceramic complex were developed based on the urn burials and their imported mortuary offerings in Mound 30d (Lowe 1993). 
The 
cultural 
changes 
reported 
for the Terminal Formative period at the site had, therefore, been developed on the basis of ceramics from these offerings contexts alone. 
Clark and Cheetham (2005) 
have since expanded on Lowe’s chronology with updated ceramic descriptions for the Early through Ter­minal Formative periods. Their ceramic descrip­tions included materials recovered from recent projects, including Clark’s survey of the Mazatán region, which allowed for a more expansive de.nition of Hato and Itstapa phase ceramics in the Soconusco region. The recent publication of un.nished manuscripts on Izapa excavations (Clark and Lee 2013;Lieske 
2013;Loweetal. 
2013;Navarrete 
2013) 
have 
provided 
additional 
details about the Formative to Classic period transition at Izapa. Clark (Lowe et al. 2013) 
has 
also updated the Izapa chronology slightly to re.ect updates to other nearby chronologies (see Table 
1). 
These 
updates 
are 
accepted 
here 
and 
referenced throughout the text. 
After a hiatus, excavations at Izapa resumed in 
the 
1990s. 
Hernando 
Gómez 
Rueda 
(1995) 
used targeted excavations to investigate the hydraulic system at Izapa. More recently, Robert Rosenswig has resumed work at the site, initiat­ing his Izapa Regional Settlement Project (IRSP) in 2011. Understanding of Izapa has bene.ted greatly from Rosenswig’s detailed maps gener­ated by light detection and ranging (lidar) imag­ing, settlement data, and screened excavations in the site center (Rosenswig et al. 2013, 
2014). 
As a better understanding of the ceramics for the .rst millennium AD has been developed, survey results have been updated (Rosenswig and Mendelsohn 2016).

They 
included 
two 
previously 
unmapped 
mounds in the southern sector of Izapa, Mounds 255 
and 
260 
(Figure 
2). 

The IHAP excavation methodology followed many of the same techniques used during the 2012 IRSP excavations in the monumental center of Izapa (Rosenswig et al. 2014). 
Excavation 
units were placed on the .anks of mounds in places where middens might be expected. On-mound units were 1 × 3 m long. Off-mound units were 1 × 2 m long. Exceptions included units that were opened as extensions to better explore features uncovered in adjacent units (e.g., Suboperations 104c and 105c). Excava­tions were conducted in arbitrary 10 cm levels unless cultural features were detected. 
Although the goals of the project had been to investigate changes in domestic refuse dur­ing the Middle Formative to Late Formative urbanization of Izapa, it quickly became apparent that southern neighborhoods at Izapa were also occupied during the Terminal Formative and Classic periods. Though no primary deposits of the Middle and Late Formative periods (850–100 BC) were discovered, the recovery of deposits associated with the Hato (100 BC–AD 100), Itstapa (AD 100–250), and Jaritas (AD 250–400) phases provided an unexpected opportunity to update our understanding of the ceramic chronol­ogy of the Formative to Classic period transition at Izapa. 
Excavations at Mound 255 

Mound 255 was a 2 m high mound located south of 
the 
site’s 
monumental 
core 
(Figure 
2). 
Exca­
vations at Mound 255 revealed two offerings atop the mound associated with the Hato and Jaritas phases. The three on-mound test pits and their associated materials revealed that Mound 255 had been constructed during the Hato phase. The nearby off-mound unit, Suboperation 104e, revealed evidence of Itstapa phase occupation. Excavations at Mound 255 were signi.cant, as they identi.ed deposits that helped to better de.ne the poorly understood ceramic complexes of the Hato and Itstapa phases. These .nds indicated that construction activity continued at Izapa during the Terminal Formative period in zones outside of Group F, a surprising outcome of the project. 
Horizontal Excavations at Mound 255 
Excavations atop Mound 255 yielded two ceramic offerings, both at the northern side of the mound, in Suboperation 104a. The .rst offering consisted of a thin-walled jar recovered at the southern end of the unit, immediately west of a rectangular arrangement of irregularly shaped cobbles. The stones sat atop several levels (Lev­els 2–4) of very compact soil, possibly represent­ing a tamped earth .oor. The jar was recovered slightly embedded into this layer, suggesting that the pot, or at least its base, had been deposited intrusively into a .oor. Thin-walled offering jars with similar forms and incised designs have been recovered elsewhere at Izapa. Lowe and colleagues 
(1982:145, 
Figure 
7.19) 
classi.ed 
these as intrusive offerings. 
The second Mound 255 offering was encoun­tered at the northwest end of the unit, imme­diately 
east 
of 
a 
line 
of 
six 
stones 
(Figure 
3). 
This feature consisted of four complete or nearly complete vessels and one large decorated sherd.

These pots were recovered embedded in a layer of packed earth, suggesting that they had been deposited intrusively. An additional 2 × 3 m hori­zontal exposure (Suboperation 104c) was opened to the west in an attempt to better de.ne these offerings and stone alignments. Horizontal expo­sure revealed two additional alignments of stone, each at different orientations from the stone rectangle in Suboperation 104a. The function of these offerings and stone alignments is currently unknown. The vessels may represent a dedica­tory offering from the close of construction of Mound 255. It is also possible that these vessels were burial goods, associated with a skeleton that has 
since 
disintegrated 
(see 
Mendelsohn 
[2017] 
for discussion of this possibility).

Vertical Excavations at Mound 255 
Vertical excavations at Mound 255 helped to reveal the construction sequence of the mound and recovered Hato phase debris at the base of the mound. Both the ceramic and stratigraphic evidence of Mound 255 suggest that the mound was built to its full height in the Hato phase. 
Excavations at Mound 255 revealed a layer of debris at the base of the mound documented in two vertical excavation units. This layer, approximately 30 cm thick, was identi.ed as domestic debris based on the artifacts encoun­tered. These included .gurine and ground stone fragments and larger sherds. In Suboperations 104a and 104d, this included Levels 18–20. Flotation samples were taken near large ceramics and burned areas throughout this layer. AMS sample AA105648, a carbonized fragment of a maize cob, was recovered from one such .otation sample. Its approximate location of discovery has been plotted on the pro.le in Figure 
3.ThisAMS 
sample yielded a 2s range of 51 cal BC–130 cal 
AD 
(Table 
2), 
suggesting 
a 
Hato 
phase 
date. 
The range of the date, however, allowed for the possibly of a late Guillen or early Itstapa phase date for the deposit. Ceramic analysis revealed that ceramics from this layer were predominantly associated with the Hato phase (see below). 
The discovery of maize dating to this range, as well as the discovery of Hato phase ceramics at the base of the mound, indicates that Mound 255 could not have been constructed earlier than the Hato phase. The presence of offering vessels atop the mound also dating to the Hato phase indicates that mound construction was also completed by this time. Together, these data indicate that Mound 255 was constructed to its full height of approximately 2 m during the Hato phase. This was a surprise, as results from the NWAF project suggested a period of disruption at the site during the 
Hato 
phase. 
Lowe 
and 
colleagues 
(1982:139) 
originally projected that all occupation activity had shifted north, to Group F, by this time. 
Off-Mound Excavations: Suboperation 104e 
Another excavation unit was placed south of Mound 255 to test for off-mound occupation (see Figure 
2). 
This 
unit 
revealed 
signs 
of 
con­
struction activity as well as a layer of domestic debris atop a layer of compact soil, which may have been associated with a .oor. Excavations at Suboperation 104e began with the recovery of a concentration of large irregular stones at the 
southern 
end 
of 
the 
unit 
(Figure 
4). 
These 
stones were likely the remnants of stone archi­tecture (Mendelsohn 2017). 
Subsequent 
exca­
vations beneath these stones revealed a 30 cm deposit (Levels 8–10) with large sherds. The recovery of large and nicely preserved sherds with fewer earlier materials suggests a trash deposit for this stratum, beneath the construction. 
Among the large ceramic pieces recovered from this layer was the lower half of a vessel collapsed 
in 
situ 
(Figure 
4). 
This 
vessel was recessed slightly into a layer of compact soil. The signi.cance of this compact soil was not noted at the time of excavations but was reassessed fol­lowing the ceramic analysis. Materials from Lev­els 8–10 appeared to represent distinct ceramic complexes from materials recovered from below Level 10. In hindsight, this compact layer may have represented a tamped dirt .oor. 
The dating for this deposit was initially unclear. Ceramic analysis revealed that mate­rials recovered from this unit were different than those recovered from both Mounds 255 and Mound 260. Here, an AMS date helped to place the deposit. The Suboperation 104e car­bon (AA105649) came from a .otation sample that was taken in association with one of the large ceramic sherds in the Level 8–10 deposit. Its approximate location has been plotted on Figure 
4. 
Carbon recovered from this sample (AA105649) yielded a 2s range of cal AD 69– 
264. This range predominantly spans the Itstapa phase, 
which 
Lowe 
and 
colleagues 
(1982, 
2013) 
place from AD 100–250. It might also represent the end of the Hato phase or the beginning of the Jaritas phase. Given the associated AMS date and the absence of similar coarse-incised sherds from other units on Mound 255 or Mound 260, an Itstapa phase assignment for these ceramics appears most appropriate at present (see below).

at Mound 260 revealed two of the best deposits of domestic debris recovered by IHAP. The northern unit of the Mound 260 excavations, Suboperation 105a, yielded both a trash pit and a .red clay feature of unknown function (see Mendelsohn 
[2017] 
for 
discussion 
of 
the 
latter). 
Ceramics from these deposits were uniformly associated with the Jaritas phase. Stratigraphy from 
Mound 
260 
(Figure 
5) 
indicates 
that 
the 
mound was both constructed and occupied exclu­sively during the Jaritas phase (AD 250–400). 
The trash pit in Suboperation 105a revealed the most complete utilitarian ceramics recovered by IHAP. The presence of a trash deposit was .rst revealed when large sherds were excavated along 
the 
southern 
end 
of 
the 
unit 
(Figure 
5). 
By Level 3, a large, intact vessel was detected at the southeast corner of the unit and a 40 × 65 cm extension (Suboperation 105c) was opened to recover 
it 
(Figure 
5). 
This 
excavation 
yielded 
the 
recovery of .ve complete and nearly complete vessels. The fragmentary nature of the vessels encountered, their positions at various depths in the soil matrix, and the recovery of large pieces inside the large vessel suggested that this was a trash deposit rather than an offering. The recovered ceramics match those described and illustrated for the Jaritas phase at Izapa (Lee 1973, 
n.d.;Loweetal. 1982:144–147). 
Carbon 
samples recovered during the .otation of soil from 
inside 
the 
large 
vessel 
(Figure 
5) 
yielded 
2s ranges of 332–526 cal AD (AA106726) and 255–396 cal AD (AA106727), corroborating this Jaritas 
phase 
assignment 
(Table 
2). 

Ceramics of the Formative to Classic 
Period Transition 


These ceramic deposits recovered by IHAP drew attention to gaps in knowledge in the Izapa ceramic sequence. It quickly became apparent that the several phases of the Terminal Formative and Early Classic periods had been established solely on the basis of offerings and ritual refuse. Hato and Itstapa phase occupation, in particular, could not be identi.ed outside of the ceremonial centers, as local ceramics had not yet been de.ned for these periods. The aims of the IHAP ceramic analysis needed to be reoriented toward a de.nition of local ceramics for the Hato, Itstapa, and Jaritas phases. In this pursuit, Clark and Cheetham’s 
(2005) 
publication 
on 
the 
Terminal 
Formative ceramics from the nearby Mazatán region were an important resource.

While AMS dates from the deposits were helpful as one line of evidence, their ranges left open some level of ambiguity for the contexts, because the 2s range usually overlapped with a previous or subsequent phase. Ceramic cross-dating was of considerable utility, narrowing down the ranges for these unidenti.ed ceramic wares. The cross-dating revealed that the local Hato phase ceramics at Izapa were associated with the same widespread ceramic horizon that had been used by Lowe to identify the imported Terminal Formative vessels from the Mound 30d urn burials and to anchor the chronology of the Formative to Classic period transition (Figure 
6).

materials 
had 
also 
been 
well 
de.ned 
by 
Lee 
(1973) 
and 
were 
easily 
identi.able in excavations. The results, however, raised questions regarding which sherds were meant to constitute the Itstapa phase ceramic complex. 
The Hato CeramicComplex 
The Mound 255 vessels included plates with shallow everted rims and three solid conical (nubbin) supports. Many Hato phase ceramics from the Mound 255 offering, occupation layer, and .ll had short everted rims that sometimes contained scalloped (or pie crust) modeling. Another common form was the hemispherical bowl with an externally thickened rim and nubbin

supports. The clearest examples of Hato sherds included these forms with red-on-orange dec­oration, where red was often restricted to the rim/lip. The vessels recovered from the Mound 255 offering shared a very .ne, almost kaolin-like, white paste with a very .ne black or dark gray core. 
Cross-dating of Hato ceramics was relatively straightforward due to the many traits, like nub­bin feet, .ne pastes, red-on-orange decoration, and common vessel forms associated with the early Terminal Formative period across south­ern 
Mesoamerica 
(Figure 
6). 
These 
correlations 
helped to support the Hato ceramic complex as temporally distinct from the Guillen phase and to place it at the beginning of the Terminal Formative period. Hato phase ceramics from Izapa cross-dated nicely with other assemblages containing early Terminal Formative markers, including the Verbena phase at Kaminaljuyu, the Early Caynac phase at Chalchuapa, and the Hun phase in the Upper Grijalva region. These associations were aided by Inomata and col­leagues’ 
(2014:Figure 
4) 
correlations 
of 
ceramics 
for this time period and were con.rmed by personal observations of collections from Chia­pas, Mexico; Guatemala; and El Salvador. For a full review of the cross-dating for the Hato through Jaritas phases, readers are referred to Mendelsohn 
(2017). 

TheJaritasCeramic Complex 
The Jaritas ceramic complex at Izapa was well de.ned during the NWAF excavations through offerings in Group B (Lieske 2013;Loweetal. 
1982) 
and 
Group 
F 
(Lee 
1973, 
n.d.). Because of the “local character” of the Jaritas phase offerings (Lowe et al. 1982:145), 
these 
materials 
were 
eas­
ily identi.ed during the IHAP excavations. For detailed descriptions of Jaritas phase materials, readers 
are 
referred 
to 
Lee 
(1973, 
n.d.) and Lowe and 
colleagues 
(1982:145–147). 

The deposits from Mound 260 helped to determine that Jaritas phase ceramics include vessels with labial and sublabial ridges or .anges and a red wash, with solid conical feet. Jaritas phase ceramics are also identi.ed by their thin-walled jars, containing rims with “droopy” labial ridges and interior grooves. These are often decorated with parallel wavy lines, or the “sine” motif, on the neck. They also include thin vessels with incised geometric designs, as opposed to the coarse-incised vessels with thicker walls that appear to be common for the Itstapa phase. Vessels with both incised designs and very .ne paste (otherwise Itstapa and Hato diagnostics, respectively) are also associated with the Jaritas phase. As Lowe and colleagues observed, ceram­ics associated with the Jaritas phase represent a local tradition with few links to outside areas (Lowe et al. 1982:145). 
The 
closest 
similarities 
observed for the Jaritas phase ceramics from Izapa were with Early Classic ceramics from the western Soconusco region, including Voorhies’s (1976:116–132) 
excavations 
at 
Tlacuachero 
and 
Pfeiffer’s (1983:Vol. 
I 
224, 
Vol. 
II 
224–246) 
project at Rio Arriba. 
SomewhereInBetween: The Itstapa Ceramic Complex 
The ceramics from Suboperation 104e raised questions regarding the Itstapa phase ceramic complex at Izapa. The Suboperation 104e deposit included a new type of diagnostic sherd for Izapa: pinkish (or pale orange), coarse-incised sherds with 
bolstered 
rims 
(Figure 
7). 
These 
diagnostics 
were unlike materials recovered from within either Mound 255 or Mound 260, suggesting that they belonged to neither the Hato nor the Jaritas ceramic complexes. An Itstapa phase association therefore seemed logical. Clark and Cheetham (2005:423–424) 
reported 
similar 
Itstapa 
phase 
materials from the Mazatán region. The cal AD 69–264 range for AMS date AA105649, recovered from the same level as the coarse-incised sherds, appeared to support an Itstapa phase association. The range also includes the end of the Hato phase and the beginning of the Jaritas phase, however. 
These materials could not be identi.ed from the Hato, Itstapa, or Jaritas phase ceramics described 
and 
illustrated 
by 
Lee 
(1973)orin 
the Izapa site report (Lowe et al. 1982). 
These 
.ndings raised questions about how the Itstapa phase ceramic complex had been de.ned by Lowe and Lee. An investigation into excava­tion notes and published studies revealed some concerns. For one, the separation of the Itstapa phase from the Hato and Jaritas phases meant that no urn burials were assigned to the early

part of this phase. Urn burials were recovered for the Hato and Jaritas phases in the Mound 30 complex, but Itstapa phase materials in that area were limited to offerings (Lieske 2013:Table 
4). In Group F, four different Itstapa phase structures were identi.ed in the Mound 125a stratigraphy (Lowe et al. 1982:Figure 
13.17). 
Although offerings were recorded for the .rst two Itstapa phase structures at Mound 125a, urn burials were not interred in the mound until the second two Itstapa phase structures were erected (Lee n.d.). Likewise at Group B, in the site center, urn burials of the Hato and Jaritas phases were identi.ed, but Itstapa phase vessels were limited to nonmortuary offerings (Lieske 2013). 

Lowe 
and 
colleagues 
(1982:141) 
described 
the Itstapa phase as a “stabilizing period” at Izapa. The absence of urn burials for the early Itstapa phase, but presence of these burials for phases that immediately precede and succeed it, is not the expected pattern for a period of stability. This observation suggests that some overlap may have occurred in what was being de.ned as Hato and Itstapa phase materials. Clark (personal com­munication 2016) has also observed that the date ranges of the Late Hato and the Itstapa phases overlap. Perhaps the most likely explanation is that the Hato and Itstapa ceramic complexes, as previously de.ned by Lowe and Lee, actually overlap for approximately 100 years, from AD 1– 
100. The Late Hato phase urn burials might then be considered as Early Itstapa phase deposits. 
Lowe made frequent reference to “Ixtapa” ceramics in his lab notes (Lieske 2013:Appendix) 
but never speci.ed what these ceramics looked like. In one instance, Lowe made passing reference to a “distinctive Izapan Protoclassic and Early Classic coarse-incised pottery style” (Lowe 1977:234). 
Many 
comparable coarse-incised sherds were also discovered throughout Rosenswig’s survey (Rosenswig and Mendelsohn 2016). 
An 
intrusive 
offering vessel with coarse-incised decoration was the closest match of the ceramics illustrated in the Izapa report, attributed to the Itstapa phase (Lowe et al. 1982:Figure 
7.18f). 
For 
Clark’s Mazatán survey, similar coarse-incised sherds were included with the Itstapa phase materials (Clark and Cheetham 2005:421–424). 
Based 
on these observations, and the associated AMS date, the coarse-incised sherds and the Mound 104e deposit have tentatively been associated with the Itstapa phase. 
Ceramic cross-dating for coarse-incised sherds at Izapa would appear to support an Itstapa 
phase 
association 
(Figure 
7). 
A 
survey 
of 
the presence/absence and frequency of ceramics with coarse incision and deep basin forms is helpful in narrowing down the temporal range of this ware. At Kaminaljuyu, the “Coarse Incised” type (Wetherington 1978), 
or 
“Arenante” ware (Popenoe de Hatch 1997:130–132), 
is the closest correlate to the Izapa coarse-incised ceramics. Arenante, however, is signi.cantly thicker walled than the coarse-incised sherds from Suboperation 104e. They share, however, a similar form: large bowls with slightly everted walls and thick, bolstered rims. They also share decorative techniques: both include thick, post-slip incision on the exterior of the vessel, beginning below the rim. In his 1965 working chart, Lowe also noted a link between “Arenal

Incised” ceramics at Kaminaljuyu and ceramics at Izapa (Mendelsohn 2017:Table 
3.1). 
Prior 
to 
the split between Hato and Itstapa phases, he cross-dated this association to the Hato phase at Izapa. 
Also of signi.cance was the recovery of a fragment of a polished black, very wide­everted rim from the Suboperation 104e deposit (Figure 
7). 
This 
rim 
was 
associated 
with 
San 
Jac­
into, a well-known, fancy, polished black ware in inland Chiapas. San Jacinto ceramics date to the Ix (Bryant and Clark 2005:332–338) 
and 
Hun 
phases (Clark and Cheetham 2005:417) 
in 
that 
zone. Although this import does not narrow down the range of the deposit between the Hato or Itstapa phases, it does secure its placement in the Terminal Formative period. Ceramics like this San Jacinto sherd, with the distinctive, wide­everted rim forms, were highlighted by Inomata and 
colleagues 
(2014:398–399) 
to 
propose 
that 
the Izapa chronology, speci.cally the Guillen phase, should be shifted. The appearance of this San Jacinto sherd in a Terminal Formative deposit serves as evidence against this proposal. 
AMS Dates and Bayesian Modeling 

An additional line of evidence for reviewing the chronology of the Formative to Classic period transition at Izapa is Bayesian model­ing of carbon dates recovered from the site. Archaeologists are increasingly using Bayesian modeling as a means of developing greater precision in their chronologies, which in turn allows additional archaeological problems to be addressed (Bachand 2008; 
Bayliss 
and 
Bronk 
Ramsey 2004; 
Bronk 
Ramsey 
2009). 
Bayesian 
models combine the date ranges for multiple carbon dates with researchers’ interpretations of phases and stratigraphic relationships to build on data provided by individual absolute dates. The deposits from which the IHAP samples came are described above. Old carbon and other prob­lematic samples have been identi.ed as outliers and were excluded from the model. The choices made in the development of the Bayesian model in Figure 
8 
are described in the Supplemental Material. The results of this Bayesian analysis are provided in Figure 
8. 
The .nal Bayesian model produced in OxCal had both a good model

agreement index value (Amodel = 119.5%) and individual agreement value (Aoverall = 121.2%). Both values were well above the necessary threshold of 60%, which is used to indicate a problem with the model (Bronk Ramsey 2009). 

Before proceeding to the results, it is worth noting that, ideally, Bayesian analysis would be run only on AMS dates from recent projects, which have shorter ranges and greater accuracy. The ranges for the NWAF dates are long due to the technology available at the time the samples were run. Bayesian modeling of the newer AMS dates from IHAP with the NWAF dates produced by older methods helped to narrow down the date ranges for each phase. There is, however, some danger that these earlier published dates mislead the analysis. The presentation here re.ects the data available at the time of writing and should be updated (eventually excluding the older NWAF dates) as additional data become available. 
Bayesian modeling produces projected boundaries between phases, presented as ranges (Table 
3). 
These 
ranges, although wide (as a result of the wide ranges of the original NWAF 14C dates), conform to Lowe and colleagues’ (1982:Figure 
7.1) initial chronology, which included the Guillen-Hato transition around 50 BC (100 BC for the Lowe et al. 2013 
update), the Hato-Itstapa transition at AD 100, the Itstapa-Jaritas transition at AD 250, and the Jaritas-Kato transition at AD 400. Lowe and Lee’s projected beginning of the Guillen phase at 300 BC is also close to the result of the Guillen start date in the Bayesian model. More Guillen phase dates need to be collected and run using AMS to con.rm this. The results for the Kato phase, which

Discussion 

Recent excavation data from IHAP generally support Lowe and colleagues’ 
(1982, 
2013) 
chronology for the Terminal Formative to Early Classic period transition at Izapa. Challenges arose, however, in identifying ceramics associ­ated with each of these phases outside the site core. Because non-offering ceramics had not been de.ned for the Hato, Itstapa, and Jaritas phase ceramic complexes, ceramic cross-dating was a necessary step to con.rm that the AMS dates for these deposits accurately re.ected their associated ceramics. For the Hato and Jaritas

phases, this was relatively straightforward. For the Itstapa phase ceramic complex, correlation was more challenging. 
The biggest inconsistency between offering ceramics and local ceramics was for the Hato phase. This period had appeared well de.ned in the Izapa chronology, with early and late subphases 
de.ned 
by 
Lowe 
(1993;Loweetal. 
1982) 
for 
the 
elaborate 
offerings 
in 
the 
Mound 
30d urn burials. The identi.cation of Hato phase materials became immediately problematic out­side the ceremonial center, however, as local ceramics for this phase had never been identi.ed. Luckily, cross-dating of local Hato phase ceram­ics proved to be relatively straightforward. New ceramic modes, like nubbin feet, red-on-orange decoration, and the adoption of .ne pastes, were common at sites across Mesoamerica during the .rst 200 years of the Terminal Formative period (Figure 
6). 
The 
appearance 
of 
this 
horizon 
at 
Izapa, now documented even among ceramics outside of the site core, has helped to anchor the dating of the Hato phase to a well-documented era at other Mesoamerican sites. 
The reconstruction of the Itstapa phase ceramic complex, however, was challenging and still remains uncertain. The poor de.nition of the ceramics for this phase is related to several issues, including a cultural shift in occupation from the monumental core of the site to the new ceremonial center to the north, Group F. Although it is understood that the .rst major construction efforts at Group F were undertaken during the Itstapa phase (Lowe et al. 1982:229), 
the amount of overlap in occupation between “Old” Izapa and Group F remains unclear. 
The division between early and late phases of the Terminal Formative period also appears problematic at other nearby sites. De Borhegyi (1965:11), 
for 
example, 
once 
suggested 
that 
the 
Verbena (“Mira.ores” in his discussion) and Arenal complexes at Kaminaljuyu were roughly contemporaneous. He saw Mira.ores ceramics as the elite ceremonial assemblage of the Arenal domestic assemblage (de Borhegyi 1965:11). 
Wetherington 
(1978:129) 
also 
experienced 
dif.­
culty in dividing the Terminal Formative ceramic assemblages of Kaminaljuyu. He did, however, note that some changes in form were observable. Standing wall bowls, like those included on thick, incised types, tended to have a higher frequency in the Arenal phase (Wetherington 1978:131). 

A scenario similar to that proposed by de Borhegyi 
(1965) 
for 
Kaminaljuyu 
remains 
pos­
sible at Izapa; the Hato and Itstapa ceramic complexes could still be contemporaneous. The division of the Terminal Formative phases at Izapa still lacks good stratigraphic relationships and requires more absolute dates. At present, however, results closer approximate Wethering­ton’s observations for an increase in coarse incisions and deep basin forms in the Arenal phase, attributes found in the proposed Itstapa phase ceramic complex at Izapa. Future exca­vations will be necessary to critically evaluate the division of an Itstapa ceramic complex from the better-documented ceramics of the Hato and Jaritas phases. 
Love (in press) offers an alternative correla­tion between Kaminaljuyu and the Paci.c coast from his perspective of the site of El Ujuxte, a Guatemalan coastal center between Izapa and Kaminaljuyu. Although the ceramics of Izapa and El Ujuxte cross-date nicely for the Late Formative (Guillen-Cataluña) and early Termi­nal Formative (Hato-Pitahaya) phases, Love and I have reached different conclusions regarding cross-dating to Kaminaljuyu. Whereas I link the Hato phase at Izapa with the Verbena phase at Kaminaljuyu (following Lowe 1993) 
and 
the 
Itstapa phase at Izapa to the Arenal phase at Kaminaljuyu, Love prefers to link the Pitahaya phase at El Ujuxte with the Arenal phase at Kaminaljuyu. As Love (in press) observes, both sets of correlations cannot be correct. This discrepancy will need to be resolved through additional research. 
A possible overlap for Hato and Itstapa phase ceramic complexes at Izapa may explain some of the observed discrepancies with Love’s cross-dating. Both Izapa and Kaminaljuyu lack good stratigraphic deposits that would be ideal for differentiating between ceramic complexes of the early and late phases of the Terminal For­mative period. At Kaminaljuyu, the divisions between the Verbena, Arenal, and even Santa Clara ceramic complexes have been dif.cult to distinguish (de Borhegyi 1965;Ohi 
1994; 
Wetherington 1978). 
Likewise, 
Lowe’s

complexes were, at .rst, considered contempo­raneous 
(Table 
1; 
Mendelsohn 
2017:Table 
3.1). 
Although I have argued that horizon markers for the early phase of the Terminal Formative period are identi.ed at Izapa, El Ujuxte, and Kaminaljuyu, it is perhaps safest at present to discuss cross-dating and cultural activities for a broader Terminal Formative phase spanning from 100 BC–AD 250. 
It is now clear that we need a better division between Terminal Formative ceramic complexes at Izapa. Future research that could distinguish between the ceramics of the Hato and Itstapa phases and provide additional dates would have important implications for cultural activities at Izapa, including the Hato phase disturbance reported 
by 
Lowe 
and 
colleagues 
(1982). 
It 
is 
suspicious that no urn burials have been docu­mented in either the new ceremonial center or the old for the beginning of the Itstapa phase. The proposed overlap between the Hato and Itstapa phases for the period between AD 1 and 100 might explain this anomaly. It is also possible that a gap in urn burials at the site re.ect a response to a local environmental catastrophe. Sometime between 30 BC and AD 80 the nearby Tacaná volcano erupted, resulting in muddy .oods at Izapa (Macías et al. 2018). 
The 
cultural 
impact 
of 
this eruption is still poorly understood due to poor chronological re.nement for this era. Finally, while survey results currently indicate a decline in Hato phase occupation at the site (Rosenswig and Mendelsohn 2016), 
coarse-incised 
ceramics 
have been found in abundance in the Formative period core at Izapa. If an overlap between the Hato and Itstapa ceramic complexes proves to be accurate, our interpretations of this population decline will need to be adjusted. 
The ceramic identi.cations and associated cultural activities of the Jaritas phase have been easier to deduce. Unlike the Hato phase, the Jaritas phase offerings documented by Lee (1973, 
n.d.) consisted predominantly of local ceramics. This meant that the ceramics interred in offering contexts were similar to the domestic ceramics recovered at Mound 260. In addition, Mound 260 was a single component occupation without the interpretive dif.culty of earlier mate­rials. The results support Lowe and colleagues’ (1982:145) 
initial 
conclusion 
that 
Jaritas 
phase 
ceramics at Izapa were of a local style, suggesting a dramatic decline in ties with the Mira.ores sphere to the southeast by the onset of this phase around AD 250. Here, Love (in press) and I are in agreement that ceramic ties between the Paci.c coast and the Guatemalan highlands cease by AD 200/250. 
Bayesian statistical analysis of the IHAP dates, together with the original 14C dates from the NWAF excavations, also helps narrow the ranges of the proposed boundaries between phases. These boundaries conformed to the chronology initially laid out by Lowe and col­leagues in 1982. They also .t the minor adjust­ments to this chronology proposed by Clark in 2013 (Lowe et al. 2013). 
Yet 
the 
absolute 
chronology of the Late and Terminal Formative periods at Izapa still requires considerable re.ne­ment. At present, only two dates for the Guillen phase are accepted (Supplemental Material), two good dates exist for the Hato phase, four dates are available for the Itstapa phase, and three dates now exist for the Jaritas phase. Calendar dates for the Guillen, Hato, Itstapa, and Jaritas phases could therefore be shifted by 50 or even 100 years as additional dates become available (see also Rosenswig and Mendelsohn 2016:Supplemental 
Material). Nevertheless, the present results, with their support of Lowe and colleagues’ ceramic chronology, suggest that there is currently little reason to reject the original interpretations of the stratigraphy reported from the NWAF project or Lowe and colleagues’ related inferences regard­ing the dating for the erection of the Izapa monuments. 
In 
contrast, 
Inomata 
and 
colleagues’ 
(2014) 
alternative proposal, that the Guillen phase ceramics at Izapa may date to the Terminal Formative period, is rejected. The proposed link between the wide-everted rims of the orange-slipped Tuzantan ware of the Guillen phase at Izapa (300–100 BC) and the wide-everted rims of the polished black San Jacinto ware of the Ix phase in the Grijalva region (dated to AD 100–300 
by 
Bryant 
and 
Clark 
[2005]) 
do 
not 
.t 
the data from Izapa. Imported black San Jacinto ceramics were associated with the Itstapa phase deposit in Suboperation 104e as well as a Late Hato phase urn burial at Mound 30d (Lowe et al. 1982:Figure 
7.15).

phase date for these deposits is contemporary with the occurrence of San Jacinto sherds in the Hun and Ix phases in the Grijalva region (Clark and Cheetham 2005). 
No 
shift 
in 
the 
chronology 
is necessary to correlate Terminal Formative ceramics from Izapa with other regions. All of this suggests that the dif.culty observed by Inomata 
and 
colleagues 
(2014) 
in 
correlating Guillen phase ceramics from Izapa with other Late Formative ceramics of the Maya area will need to be explained by cultural activities rather than a chronological shift. 
The above results suggest a rejection of Ino­mata 
and 
colleagues’ 
(2014) 
proposal 
to 
shift 
the 
Izapa ceramic chronology forward in time, but the results appear to support their chronological revision of Kaminaljuyu for the Terminal Forma­tive period. Ceramics of the Hato phase at Izapa cross-date with materials from the Early Caynac phase at Chalchuapa, the Horcones/Hun phases of the Chiapas interior, and the Verbena phase at Kaminaljuyu. This straightforward cross-dating suggests that residents of Izapa participated in a widespread horizon at the onset of the Terminal Formative period (Mendelsohn 2018). 
The 
dat­
ing of the Hato phase at Izapa to 100 BC–AD 100 supports 
Inomata 
and 
colleagues’ 
(2014)revised 
dating of the Verbena phase to 100 BC–AD 50, shifted from its original placement at 400– 300 BC (see Love [in press] for an alternative proposal). 
The relationship between this ceramic hori­zon and the Izapan style monuments, however, remains open to interpretation. As Love (in press) discusses, correlations between pottery, burials, and the monuments themselves remain problematic. Recent survey evidence supports Lowe’s initial Guillen phase association for the monuments. Very few Hato phase materials were recovered on survey from Groups A and B, where most of the in situ Izapa monuments are located (Rosenswig and Mendelsohn 2016). 
In 
contrast, 
Guillen phase ceramics were recovered in abun­dance in these groups (Rosenswig et al. 2012). 

Some of the monuments in the central zones of Izapa (e.g., the cluster of monuments at Mound 9), however, could have been placed in their .nal positions as late as the Itstapa phase (Lowe et al. 1982:207). 
As 
I have discussed elsewhere (Mendelsohn 2017), 
the 
possibility 
remains that additional monuments were carved and erected at Izapa into the Terminal Formative period, after the .rst century BC. Monuments depicting glyphs or personal ornaments of jade, in particular, may be later additions, based on their iconography and locations at the site. Ino­mata 
and 
colleagues’ 
(2014:399) 
suggestion 
that 
censer styles may help to narrow down the date of the Izapa monuments is also a promising avenue for future research. 
Findings from the IHAP have brought us one step closer to understanding Izapa and the regional Soconusco chronology. The present study has highlighted the importance of testing long-standing chronologies with new data. The chronological questions raised by this study will necessitate a reevaluation of the cultural events at Izapa during the Terminal Formative to Early Classic transition and the relationship of its res­idents to neighboring regions at this time, ques­tions that many researchers working in southern Mesoamerica have long seen as well-established facts. As we continue to re.ne chronologies of the “Southern Maya area” (which probably was not all Maya), interpretations of political and economic relationships also should be updated. The origin and spread of developments like early kingship symbolism, low relief sculpture, and popular ceramic styles will no doubt continue to be the subject of discussion as new details emerge from southern Mesoamerican sites.

in 
favoring 
the 
label 
“Terminal 
Forma­

These urn burials consisted of individuals buried in large ceramic vessels accompanied by offerings. The presence of human remains in these vessels was inferred by the personal adornment items accompanied inside the vessels, as bone does not preserve at Izapa (Lowe 1993).
