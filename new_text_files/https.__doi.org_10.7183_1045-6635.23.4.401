STATE COLLAPSE AND HOUSEHOLD RESILIENCE 
IN THE OAXACA VALLEY OF MEXICO 

Ronald K. Faulseit 
A two-year project of survey, surface collection, and excavation on the hill of Cerro Danush within the site of Dainzu­Macuilx6chitl in Oaxaca, Mexico, was focused on identifying and characterizing the Late Classic (AD. 600-8501900) and Early Postclassic (AD. 8501900-1300) components of the site, which coincide with the political fragmentation and reor­ganization of complex society within the Valley of Oaxaca. The transition in sociopolitical organization from the Classic to Postclassic has been the subject of several research projects, but few, if any, have clearly identified an Early Postclassic settlement. A radiocarbon analysis of charcoal samples collected during the excavation of a residential complex on Cerro Danush reveals its most recent period of occupation to be between AD. 1000 and 1300, placing it firmly within the Early Postclassic. The excavation data are contextualized with data from the surface collection, illuminating patterns of Late Classic political fragmentation and Early Postclassic household resilience. Since Dainzu-Macuilx6chitl emerged in the Late Postclassic (AD. 1300-1521) as a powerful city-state, exploring its Early Postclassic component contributes to the study of how societies reorganize on a local level after the collapse of centralized authority, such as the Classic period Monte Alban state.

the centralized authority with its urban capital of Monte Alban and the subsequent reorganization of the Oaxaca Valley into a more fragmented system of competitive city-states (Marcus 1989; Winter l 989a). In this article, I discuss two aspects of household and community behavior characterized at the site during two field seasons of research: site abandonment patterns and resilient household rit­ual activities. These findings are then contextual­ized with existing data for the Oaxaca Valley, with the overall goal of understanding how this impor­tant secondary center responded to the state col­lapse and reorganized in the changing sociopolitical environment. 
Classic to Postclassic in the Oaxaca Valley 
Caso and Bernal ( 1965; Bernal 1965) were the first researchers to discuss the Classic-to-Postclassic transition in the Oaxaca Valley. Their conclusions were drawn mostly from excavations conducted at Monte Alban, Mitla, and Yagul, as well as survey and less extensive excavations at a few other sites in the Oaxaca Valley and the Mixtec highlands (Acosta et al. 1992; Caso 2003a, 2003b, 2003c). Because the artifact assemblage, architecture, and layout of the Postclassic sites of Mitla and Yagul differed so greatly from those of Classic period Monte Alban,they \)ro\)osed that Mixtec ex\)ansion and influence brought these changes to the Valley of Oaxaca, accompanied by a replacement of the Zapotec population in some areas (Bernal 1965; Caso and Bernal 1965). Initially, other scholars picked up on this theme (Paddock and Bernal 1966), but it has been rejected in favor of a more complex relationship between Mixtec and Zapotec people in 
the Postclassic (Flannery and Marcus 1983). 
In the 1960s, Paddock (1983a, 1983b) and his colleagues (Paddock et al. 1968) conducted exca­vations at the site of Lambityeco in the Tlacolula arm of the valley that were specifically designed to investigate differences between Classic and Post­classic sociopolitical organization in the Oaxaca Valley. Because the ceramic assemblage at Lam­bityeco was different from Caso et al.'s (1967) pre­decline Monte Alban Illb phase and appeared to closely resemble their postdecline Monte Alban IV phase, Paddock asserted that Lambityeco's flores­cence coincided with Monte Alban's decline, sug­gesting it "by then was independent in significant 
degree" from the capital (1983a:187, 1983b). 
Lambityeco was hypothesized to be exemplary of Early Postclassic settlement in the Oaxaca Val­ley (Paddock 1983b; Paddock et al. 1968), and diagnostic ceramics identified for the most recent (Monte Alban IV phase) occupation at the site were used by the Oaxaca Valley Settlement Pattern Pro­ject (Blanton 1978; Blanton et al. 1982; Finsten 1983, 1995; Kowalewski et al. 1989) as postcol­lapse Early Postclassic markers. Similarly, precol­lapse Late Classic markers were identified from the ceramic assemblage at Monte Alban (Blanton et al. 1999; Kowalewski et al . 1989). The resulting set­tlement patterns for these periods led to a model of collapse and reorganization in the Valley of Oax­aca that involved a direct but slow transition from centralized valley-wide authority to regional balka­nized authority (Blanton et al. 1993). 
In this model, regional centers became increas­ingly more autonomous during the Late Classic and began to challenge the authority of Monte Alban (Balkansky 1998; Blanton and Kowalewski 1981; Finsten 1983; Kowalewski et al. 1989). As control of economic resources and specialization shifted to these centers, the powerofMonteAlban's ruling class waned and eventually collapsed, leav­ing the civic-ceremonial core of the site nearly abandoned (Blanton 1978, 1983). In the Early Post­classic, the regional centers develo\_)ed into an orga­
nizational system dominated by competitive 
balkanized states that held sway over the valley 
through the Late Postclassic (Blanton et al. 1993; 
Marcus and Flannery 1983). 
Citing the results of radiocarbon analyses from the Lambityeco project (Paddock et al. 1968), Win­ter ( 1989b) challenged its classification as an Early Postclassic site and questioned the validity of the ceramic markers used by the settlement pattern project. Instead, he argued that Lambityeco and many other Oaxaca Valley sites that were identi­fied as Early Postclassic in the regional survey were actually abandoned or in decline at the end of the Late Classic, along with Monte Alban. He asserted 
that the proposed Early Postclassic ceramic assem­blages (Paddock 1983b; Paddock et al. 1968) and settlements (Blanton et al. 1982; Kowalewski et al. 1989) were not supported by radiocarbon dates and that the lack of such data suggested "a hiatus in the sequence for which cultural content is unclear" (Winter 1989b:123).

Winter's (1989b, 2003) model, which has since been elaborated on by others (Joyce 2010; Lind and Urcid 20 10), invoived "the sudden disappearance throughout the Valley of Oaxaca of what one might refer to in Redfield's (1956) terms as the Zapotec 'great tradition"' (Markens et al. 2008:210). Win­ter (2003) further postulated that this decline was possibly caused by environmental factors, partic­ularly drought, although at this time there is no cli­matic or environmental evidence from the Oaxaca Valley to support this idea. In general, this model envisions that the valley suffered some kind of cri­sis contributing to the rapid decline of the central­ized state followed by a period of abandonment and decline for most sites in the Oaxaca Valley. 
Evaluating the merits of these competing mod­els has been impeded by two factors: difficulty in determining clear Late Classic and Early Postclas­sic ceramic markers due to the dearth of decora­tive wares for these time periods (Feinman and Nicholas 2011; Kowalewski et al. 1989) and a lack of radiocarbon dates for Late Classic and Early Postclassic contexts (Drennan 1983; Mark ens et al. 2010). These problems led to differing interpreta­tions of the ceramic chronology for the periods in question and a considerable amount of debate (Kowalewski et al. 1989:251-254; Lind 1991-1992; Marcus 1990; Martinez Lopez et al. 2000). Recently, an extensive seriation of well­dated Late Classic and Early Postclassic grave lots (Markens 2004, 2008) has made considerable progress toward alleviating some of these difficul­ties, and the qualitative descriptions of diagnostic period markers from that study form the basis for this analysis. More quantitative data are still needed from other contexts, however, such as well-defined stratigraphically intact middens. Such assemblages would help characterize the diachronic changes in the percentage distributions for individual ceramic types identified by Markens (2004, 2008) from the 
Late Classic and Early Postclassic single-event bur­ial offerings. 
Research conducted over the last two decades is providing a growing body of evidence from sev­eral Classic period sites in the Valley of Oaxaca (Blomster 2008; Fargher 2004), such as Lam­bityeco (Lind and Urcid 2010), Ejutla (Feinman 1999), Jalieza (Casparis 2006; Elson 201 1), El Palmillo (Feinman and Nicholas 2009, 2011; Fein­man et al. 2002, 2006; Feinman et al. 2008; Haines et al. 2004), the Mitla Fortress (Feinman and Nicholas 2011), and Dainzu-Macuilx6chitl (Markens et al. 2008; Winter et al. 2007). These data have allowed for the in-depth reassessment of settlement patterns derived from the Oaxaca Val­ley Settlement Pattern Project (Feinman and Nicholas 20 11) and have greatly increased our understanding of Late Classic sociopolitical orga­nization in the Oaxaca Valley. 
Comparative data for the Early Postclassic, however, are still scarce, and the sociopolitical organization of communities within the valley dur­ing this period of restructuring is not well under­stood. The Classic-to-Postclassic patterns of abandonment and household ritual at Dainzu­Macuilx6chitl derived from the evidence presented here support neither the complete and rapid aban­donment of the site nor a direct transition of polit­ical authority from the centralized state system to the local ruling elites. Instead, when considered within the context of the results from the projects mentioned above, as well as data derived from the study of colonial-period documents (Oudijk 2000 , 2002, 2008),Dainzu-Macuilx6chitl appears to have gone through a process of decline, dispersal, and reorganization, with strong evidence for resilience at the household level. 
Dainzu-Macuilxochitl: 
The Archaeological Site 

Dainzu-Macuilx6chitl is located in the Tlacolula, or southeastern, arm of the Oaxaca Valley, about 25 km from Oaxaca City (Figure 1). It is a rela­tively large site, with over 150 architectural mounds dispersed over an area of roughly 4 km2, most of which have not been excavated. It is best known for the Dainzu Archaeological Zone, which is located at the base of a prominent hill, Cerro Dainzu, in the southern part of the site. There, Bernal and Oliveros ( 1988) conducted excavations on three large, man-made terraces and uncovered the monumental architecture that makes up the 
site's Formative (500 B.C.-A.D. 200) and Early Classic (A.D. 200-500) civic-ceremonial core. 
Carved stone slabs recovered within the archae­
ological zone, originally incorporated into the exte­

contact in the sixteenth century (Oliveros 1997). During the Classic period (A.D. 200-850/900), Dainzu-Macuilx6chitl is hypothesized to have served as a secondary administrative center for the Tlacolula Valley within the Monte Alban state (Balkansky 1998; Kowalewski et al. 1989; Lind and Urcid 2010; Winter 1989a). According to Kowalewski et al. ( 1989), it was second in both vol­ume of monumental architecture (122, 193 m3) and population (12,000) only to MonteAlban (900,000 m3, 25 ,000) and comparable to Jalieza (33 ,500 m3, 16,000) , which is hypothesized to have played the same role for the southern Valle Grande . After the decline of Monte Alban, Dainzu-Macuilx6chitl reorganized to emerge in the Late Postclassic (A .D. 1300-1521) as an important regional center, tak­ing part in a complex system of competitive city­states (Marcus 1989; Oudijk 2002; Whitecotton 1983; Winter 1989a). 
My research at the site focuses on the man-made terraces constructed on Cerro Danush, a small but prominent peak located approximately 1 km north of Cerro Dainzu. Surface concentrations of ceramic indicators for Late Classic and Early Postclassic phases appear to suggest that it was the center of site settlement at that time (Kowalewski et al. 1989). Additionally, the ceramic assemblage and radiocarbon dates produced from recent salvage excavations conducted along the Pan-American Highway corridor just south of the base of Cerro Danush support this conclusion (Markens et al. 2008; Winter et al. 2007). 
While Dainzu-Macuilx6chitl was included in the regional survey (Kowalewski et al. 1989), and a few spatially focused excavation projects have been conducted since then (Markens 2004; Markens et al. 2008; Winter et al. 2007), no quan­titative or spatially expansive study of the overall Classic period abandonment pattern has been con­ducted at the site. Furthermore, no intensive archae­ological investigations have been carried out on Cerro Danush, which has been identified as a major part of the site's Late Classic settlement (Markens et al. 2008). The data obtained during the salvage project (Markens et al. 2008; Winter et al. 2007) and Markens's (2004) independent excavations have produced important information concerning the Classic-to-Postclassic transition , including comparative evidence forthe area adjacent to Cerro Danush. Based on the extensive excavation of a Late Classic palace-temple complex (Markens et al. 2008), a portion of a Late Classic residence (Markens 2004), and an entire Late Postclassic res­idence (Winter et al. 2007), Markens and his col­leagues (Markens 2004; Markens et al. 2008) conclude that the Late Classic structures and resi­dences were abandoned around A.D. 800. They uncovered very sparse evidence for Early Post­classic occupation, which consisted of intrusive burials, offerings of miniature vessels, and some modification and reuse of the abandoned struc­tures. No Early Postclassic residences were exca­vated, however, and site settlement during that period was not specified. 
In this study, I expand on this previous research by incorporating a technique novel to the Oaxaca Valley, the analysis of the surface distribution of paste colors, along with the more traditional study of diagnostic ceramic markers, to provide an expan­sive and quantitative interpretation of the Late Clas­sic and Early Postclassic settlement. This is followed by an in-depth discussion of the data recovered from the comprehensive excavation of an Early Postclassic residence. 
Classic-to-Postclassic Settlement and 
Abandonment on Cerro Danush 

During the first field season, I mapped 130 man­made terraces on Cerro Danush (Figure 2) and col­lected artifacts from the surfaces of 98 (Faulseit 2008, 2011). For spatial referencing, the terraces were divided into eight arbitrary groups based on their locations on the mountain: north, north-cen­tral, northeast, east, west, south, southwest, and summit. Individual terraces within groups were assigned numbers, so that the relative location of any terrace on the mountain could be identified by its group and number (e.g., Terrace Sl9 =south group, number 19). All of the mapping points, recorded with a Nikon DTM 450 total station, were horizontally georeferenced using a handheld GPS device (Garmin V), vertically georeferenced with a 1 :50,000-scale topographic map (Instituto Nacional de Estadfstica y Geograffa 2001), and transformed to Universal Transverse Mercator coordinates with mapping software (TDS Fore­Sight DXM). The points were then processed using ArcGis 9 .2 software to produce the project topo­graphic map (Figure 2).

Figure 2. Project topographic map with terrace groups and collection circles marked. 
All artifacts were collected from the surface in standard circular units of 4-m radii (surface area of 
50.27 m2), and the Universal Transverse Mercator coordinates of each circle's center were recorded in an Excel spreadsheet. During lab analysis, diag­nostic ceramics were sorted into already established categories (Caso et al. 1967; Kowalewski et al. 1978; Kowalewski et al. 1989; Markens 2004, 2008; Martinez Lopez et al. 2000), and artifact fre­quencies for all collected circles were entered into the spreadsheet, which was then converted into a feature class using the ArcGis software. The dis­tribution of materials recovered from the surface suggested that most of the terraces were residen­tial, meaning they contained household units. The artifacts that were recovered, such as ceramic cook­ing pots ( ollas), anthropomorphic and zoomorphic figurines, spindle whorls, containers for water (can­taros) , and grinding stones (manos and metates), are common items established and well known from other hilltop surface collections in Oaxaca (Blanton 1978; Feinman and Nicholas 2004; Fin­sten 1995). 
Ceramic markers for the Late Classic (Monte Alban Illb-IV/Xoo phase) dominated the assem­blage, making up roughly 90 percent of the tempo­ral indicators recovered during the surface collection, suggesting that this formed the major period of occupation on Cerro Danush.1 Early Post­classic (Early Monte Alban V /Liobaa phase) mate­rials formed the bulk of the remaining 10 percent, suggesting a continued, albeit greatly reduced, occu­pation at that time. Additionally, a small sample of Early Classic (Monte Alban Illa/Pitao phase) mark­ers was collected, making up less than I percent of the total diagnostic materials recovered. To more specifically characterize the Late Classic-to-Early Postclassic settlement pattern on the terraces on Cerro Danush, I used a combined analysis of the distribution of diagnostic ceramics, incorporating surface density plots and the proportional distribu­tion of paste colors on individual terraces.

Surface Density Plots 
The spatial analysis of the surface collection data involved examining the surface density (number of sherds per square meter) of individual diagnostic ceramic types per collected circle on the terraces of Cerro Danush. The plots were derived by inter­polating the frequency counts of the selected ceramic items and the x-and y-coordinates of the collection circles from the feature class (geodata­base) into a raster shapefile, which could then be examined spatially on the site map. 
Density plots of several diagnostic ceramic types were used to investigate the occupational his­tory of individual terraces and terrace groups on Cerro Danush (Faulseit 2011). Late Classic mark­ers consist of diagnostic fragments of vessels made with gray paste that are generally burnished but oth­erwise unslipped, undecorated, and fired at low temperatures in a reduced or variable environment. Common vessel forms include conical, cylindrical, and hemispherical bowls; effigy urns; botellones; and simple ollas, among others (Caso et al. 1967; Martinez Lopez et al. 2000). Early Postclassic markers included fragments of 03M hemispheri­cal bowls, which are made of fine gray paste, well burnished and often decorated with gray and black slip, and fired at high temperatures (Markens 2004, 2008). Other Early Postclassic markers include ves­sels made of brown paste with large pieces of mica temper and irregular exterior brush marks from a prefiring treatment. They include ollas and boot­shaped jars known as patojos (Kowalewski et al. 1989; Markens 2004). For brevity's sake,however, I present the surface distributions of three particu­lar ceramic types in order to demonstrate the over­all temporal pattern of settlement and abandonment derived from the broader study. 
In addition to the Late Classic and Early Post­classic diagnostic ceramic markers mentioned above, I found a small sample of fragments from exterior-incised bowls made with gray paste (Fig­ure 3a), which were classified as 023 cylindrical and hemispherical bowls (Caso et al. 1967). These vessels have been found in both high-and low-sta­tus domestic contexts and are recognized as good Early Classic indicators in both excavation and val­ley-wide survey (Blanton et al. 1982; Caso et al. 1967; Kowalewski et al. I 989). Although the pres­ence of these materials in the assemblage from Cerro Danush may be indicative of an initial Early Classic occupation, the extremely low count recorded for this type (N= 24) more likely suggests that Cerro Danush was first occupied at the very beginning of the Late Classic and that the small sample represents the tail end of their use at that time. Therefore, the distribution of these markers should provide a reasonable approximation of which terraces or terrace groups were first con­structed and occupied on Cerro Danush. 
For the Late Classic and Early Postclassic, two types of frying-pan-like censers, known as sahu­madores, demonstrate terrace occupation and use of the mountain for their respective periods. The Late Classic censer (Figure 3b) has a hollow han­dle and a deep conical dish and is generally larger than the Early Postclassic censer (Figure 3c), which has a solid handle and shallow platelike dish (Markens 2004, 2008). Censers like these occur in relatively high quantities in both domestic and com­munity ceremonial contexts (Kowalewski et al . 1989; Martinez Lopez et al. 2000).

surface density plots derived from the frequency counts of Late Classic and Postclassic censers, respectively. The darkened circles represent the rel­ative density and location of the diagnostic sherds collected.All three have distinct distributions: 023 sherds are concentrated in the southwest and north­central groups, Late Classic censers are fairly evenly distributed across most of the terrace groups, and Postclassic censers are concentrated on the ter­races at the base of the mountain in the east and northeast terrace groups. 
From these plots alone, one could make a rea­sonable assessment of settlement changes through time. It is apparent that the first terraces were occu­pied in the southwest and north-central part of the mountain. During the Late Classic, settlement grew until nearly all of the terraces were occupied. Then, by the Early Postclassic, many of the terraces were abandoned, leaving only those at the base of the mountain in the east and northeast occupied. The presence or absence of diagnostic materials on the surface does not always reflect exactly what is under the surface, but this analysis provides a good working model for settlement that can be tested with excavation. 
Distribution of Paste Colors 
Previous research suggests that the proportions of gray, brown, and orange pastes identified in the ceramic assemblage for this region of the Oaxaca Valley also reflect diachronic differences.2 For example, Kowalewski et al. ( 1989:20 I)note a high concentration of conical and hemispherical bowls made with orange paste, which they identify as "Dainzu bowls," that appear to be most abundant in Early Classic assemblages from the western end of the Tlacolula Valley. Additionally, ceramic ves­sels made with gray paste are known to have dom­inated Late Classic assemblages throughout the valley (Caso et al. 1967; Martinez Lopez et al. 2000), and brown pastes become more prominent in Early Postclassic assemblages (Markens 2004). Thus, the analysis of paste distribution presents a complementary line of evidence to using the sur­face collection data to evaluate terrace occupation and settlement patterns. 
I incorporate this study because the analysis of proportional data is more reliable and quantitative than that of specific diagnostic materials, since it is not limited to the presence or absence of indi­vi dual indicators but allows for the inclusion of the far more numerous nondiagnostic ceramic vessel fragments collected during the project. In fact, ceramic fragments of all three colors of paste were evident in the assemblage of nearly every individ­ual collection circle and certainly within the col­lective assemblages of circles collected on any individual terrace. Therefore, investigating the rel­ative proportions of the paste colors for each ter­race significantly reduces problems associated with the presence or absence of individual diagnostic materials alone. Data from Terrace S 19, which was surface collected in the first field season and exca­vated in the second, exemplify the benefit of this method. While a few diagnostic materials collected during the excavation were absent from the surface collection assemblage for the terrace, the paste color distributions from the surface collection 
(64.24 percent gray, 33 .42 percent brown , and 2.34 percent orange) very closely match the proportions from the excavation (65 .89 percent gray, 31.55 per­cent brown, and 2.55 percent orange). 
The overall ceramic assemblage from the sur­face collection contained the following proportions: 
79.70 percent gray pastes, 18.68 percent brown pastes, and 1 .62 percent orange pastes. As explained in the following section, excavations revealed that Terrace S 19 was occupied in both the Late Classic and the Early Postclassic, and the relative percent­ages of the respective paste colors on this terrace differed significantly from those in the overall sur­face collection assemblage. Therefore, these num­bers were chosen as relative minimums for the analysis. For example, any terrace with 2.3 percent or higher in orange paste fragments would be iden­tified as a candidate for the earliest occupation. 
Orange paste fragments ranged between .13 and 
9.79 percent of the assemblage on a given terrace. The density of the surface distribution for this paste color (Figure 4b) varied greatly with that of either gray or brown pastes and corresponds well to that of the 023 bowl fragments , although it also indi­cates a somewhat expanded picture of the earliest occupation, most notably in the summit group. 
Fragments with gray paste ranged between 
42.08 and 89.84 percent of the assemblage found on a given terrace, with only two terraces exhibit­ing a percentage of gray pastes lower than 64 per­cent. The high frequency of fragments with this paste color (Figure 4d) found on nearly every ter-

race is consistent with the relatively even distrib­ution of Late Classic hollow-handled censers (Fig­ure 4c). Furthermore, the percentage of gray paste fragments was higher than 80 percent on many ter­races, most of which contained no other period's diagnostic materials on their surfaces, making it likely that these terraces were only used during the Late Classic. 
Fragments with brown paste ranged between 
9.62 and 56.83 percent of the assemblage found on a given terrace. While brown pastes are known to make up a small percentage of the Classic period assemblage for the Valley of Oaxaca (Caso et al. 1967; Martinez L6pezet al. 2000),Markens (2008) has proposed that Postclassic ceramic assemblages contain a higher percentage of vessels made with brown pastes, while gray paste vessels decline in frequency. Therefore, one would expect that ter­races with higher-than-average percentages of brown pastes may have remained occupied into the Early Postclassic. Figure 4f shows the density dis­tribution of brown paste fragments, which taken together with the distribution of Postclassic solid­handled censers (Figure 4e), suggests a striking reduction of occupied terraces during the Early Postclassic. In fact, even if the standard is lowered to terraces with 25 percent brown pastes, the num­ber of terraces does not increase significantly, and the distribution still remains mostly along the base of the mountain. With a few possible exceptions, most notably the terraces in the northeast and south­east terrace groups, the terraces with the highest percentages of brown paste fragments correspond well with the density distribution of Postclassic solid-handled censers (Figure 4e-f) and probably provide a good estimation for the terraces occupied during the Early Postclassic. 
These results indicate a pattern of Late Classic growth and decline.A few terrace groups (summit, south, west, and north-central) were first occupied at the beginning of the Late Classic. Settlement sub­sequently grew during the Late Classic so that nearly all of the 130 terraces mapped during this project were occupied. There is some evidence to suggest that individual terraces within groups were initially occupied and perhaps abandoned in unison, or at least in rapid succession. For example, early diag­nostic markers and fragments with orange paste were concentrated on terraces in the west and north­central groups. This may indicate that these terrace groups were established as barrios or extended fam­ily groups rather than just individual residences. The Late Classic, however, covers a period of roughly 300-400 years, encompassing both the apogee and the decline of occupation on Cerro Danush, yet ceramic indicators changed very little over that time (Caso et al . I 967; Kowalewski et al. 1989; Martinez Lopez et al. 2000). Consequently, more specific changes that took place at the site dur­ing that period are not detectable from the surface collection materials, and it is difficult to identify ' 
more specific sequences in the pattern of Late Clas­sic growth or abandonment for individual terraces without terrace-by-terrace excavation. 

A few important conclusions, however, emerge from the patterns described above . For example, the summit group, which contains a palace-temple complex with extremely limited access (Faulseit 2008, 2011), appears to have fallen out of use by the end of the Late Classic. I have suggested else­where that this complex represents the appropria­tion of sacred space by elite specialists, who conducted restricted ritual ceremonies devoted to Cociyo, the Zapotec rain deity (Faulseit 20 11 ). These activities appear to have ceased by the begin­ning of the Early Postclassic in favor of more open and communal ritual activities at the summit, rep­resented by the high concentrations of solid-han­dled censers on Terrace C2 (Figure 4e). 
The ceramic assemblage and radiocarbon dates collected during the excavation of a similar palace­temple structure, the Lantiudee Complex, located on the valley floor just south of Cerro Danush, sug­gest that it was also abandoned at the end of the Late Classic (Markens et al. 2008; Winter et al. 2007). The jaguar statue found on the steps of a tem­ple within this civic-ceremonial complex (Markens et al. 2008:203) indicates that it may have housed the Late Classic ruling family of Dainz ti-Macuilx6­chitl, as jaguar iconography has been associated with ruling lineages at other Formative and Clas­sic period sites both in the Oaxaca Valley and beyond (Spencer and Redmond 2000). 
The data presented above indicate that fewer than 35 of the 130 residential terraces constructed on Cerro Danush in the Late Classic remained in use during the Early Postclassic, a 75-80 percent reduc­tion in settlement. Furthermore, Early Postclassic diagnostic markers and brown paste concentrations are mostly restricted to terraces found along the base

of the mountain in the north, south, northeast, and east terrace groups. The basal location and lack of monumental architecture within these groups sug­gest that they contained low-status residences, as the relative elevation of terraces has been identified as a marker of status at other hilltop sites in the Oax­aca Valley, such as Jalieza (Elson 2011), Monte Alban (Blanton 1978), and El Palmillo (Feinman and Nicholas 2009, 2011). The subsequent excavation of a low-status residence at the base of the south group (see below) supports this conclusion. 
The spatial patterns detailed above also suggest that adjacent terraces were occupied contempora­neously in the Early Postclassic, perhaps indicat­ing the maintenance of a few extrahousehold groups such as barrios into that period, but it is also apparent that population had declined even within occupied terrace groups. By the beginning of the Late Postclassic, ca. A.D. 1300, it appears that all of the remaining residential terraces on Cerro Danush were abandoned, as only two fragments of Late Postclassic indicators were recovered. Over­all, the pattern derived here suggests that the polit­ical system at Dainzu-Macuilx6chitl did, indeed, suffer a crisis that eventually led to the abandon­ment of the site's civic-ceremonial core at the end of the Late Classic and more dispersed settlement into the Early Postclassic. 
After the Collapse: Household Resilience in the Early Postclassic 
In order to characterize Classic-to-Postclassic household activities and organization on the domes­tic terraces on Cerro Danush, I selected two well­preserved residential terraces located at the southern base of the mountain (S 19 and S20; Fig­ure 2) for systematic excavation.3 A grid of 2-x-2­m excavation units was imposed on both terraces, and individual units were excavated laterally until the most recent occupational surface was exposed in its entirety. A further 11 2-x-2-m and three l-x­2-m excavation units were then excavated below that surface to expose large portions of an earlier occupational surface and several features buried in the fill between the two. Feinman and his col­leagues (Feinman and Nicholas 2009; Feinman et al. 2008) have effectively employed a similar sys­tem for the excavation of domestic terraces at the site of El Palmillo. 
The ceramic assemblages from the surface col­lection on these terraces contained Early Classic, Late Classic, and Early Postclassic diagnostic mate­rials, suggesting that excavation would yield com­parative evidence for precollapse and postcollapse residential organization and activities. The inferred temporal span was confirmed by the range of dates obtained through the radiocarbon analysis of I 0 pieces of wood charcoal collected during the pro­ject (Table 1). The extensive excavation of the ter­race indicates that it contained a low-status residence with significant evidence for continuous use from the Late Classic into the Early Postclassic. The occu­pational history of the residence is described in stratigraphic order, starting with the most recent (Early Postclassic) occupational surface. 
On the eastern side of Terrace S 19, three rec­tangular stone foundations, arranged around a cen­tral patio, were collectively identified as the East Patio Complex (Figure 5). These structures repre­sent an eastward expansion of the terrace that took place in the Early Postclassic, as four test units excavated to bedrock in the area revealed no ear­lier occupational surfaces. Four separate individ­ual pieces of wood charcoal (Beta samples 277780, 277782, 277783, and 277784) were extracted from a thin layer of burned earth, ash, and soot located just below the foundations of Structures A and C and the stucco floor in the central portion of the patio (Figure 5). Because the 2cr ranges (Table 1) of these samples cluster quite closely around AD. 1000, it appears that they represent some type of in situ burning event, perhaps the clearing of veg­etation, that took place as part of the restructuring and expansion of the terrace and prior to the con­struction of the house-patio complex. 
On the west side of the terrace, excavations uncovered the remains of another rectangular foun­dation, Structure E, with similar design and dimen­sions to Structures A, B, and C in the East Patio Complex.Along, complex stone wall (North Wall; Figure 5) consisted of a high wall, made with large uncut stones, buttressed by a lower wall that incor­porates the bloque y laja construction technique (see below), creating a bench-like appearance (Fig­ure 5e). On the eastern end of the North Wall, the lower buttress wall is not continuous, and two sec­tions extend out from the higher wall at right angles, forming the east and west foundation walls of a thin rectangular platform, identified as Structure D.

Directly to the west of this structure was a coma! hearth, similar in design to the modem tortilla grid­dles used in traditional Zapotec homes in the Oax­aca Valley (Faulseit 2011). The location of the hearth, adjacent to Structure D, suggests that the latter may have functioned as a kitchen or cook shed, as modem Zapotec house complexes appear to follow this arrangement (Parsons 1936; Sutro and Downing 1988). 
These features and their corresponding patio space are collectively identified as the West Patio Complex (Figure 5), and they were elevated some 20-25 cm above the level of the East Patio Com­plex surface by a layer of fill contained behind a stone-lined step located in the center of the terrace. Two distinct circular areas of burned earth, ash, and soot, found during the excavation of this patio com­plex, appear to represent in situ burning (fire pits; Figure 5). Because these features extend under­neath the base of the buttress wall, I initially sug­gested that they represent in situ burning that took place as part of the dedicatory rites that occurred prior to the construction of the West Patio Com­plex (Faulseit 2011). Two individual pieces of wood charcoal were analyzed from each of these fire pits (Beta samples 277786, 277787, 277788, and 277789), and all of the intercept dates cluster quite closely around A .D. 1200 (Table 1), some 200 years after the construction of the East Patio Complex. Analysis of the buried ceramic offerings (see below) that were also recovered in the fill layer below the western patio suggests that the east and west patio complexes were built at the same time, and the fire pits likely represent dedicatory rites associated with the later addition of the buttress wall to support the original stone wall. 
The layout of the structures, rectangular single­room foundations arranged around central patios, is common in residential architecture excavated in the Oaxaca Valley from the Formative through the Late Classic (Casparis 2006; Elson 2011; Feinman and Nicholas 2009; Flannery and Marcus 2005; Winter 1974, 1989a). The construction technique employed in the Postclassic house foundation walls of this occupational surface, however, appears to dif­fer somewhat from the construction of the walls of their Classic period counterparts . Whereas the lat­ter incorporate facing walls that consist of single

lines of adjacent square cut stone blocks (Winter 1974, 2002), the former employ the bloque y laja style, consisting of stone blocks that alternate with stacks of smaller cut stone bricks, a style exempli­fied by the north foundation wall of Structure A (Fig­ure 6). All of the walls associated with the Postclassic occupation of Terrace S 19 incorporate this bloque y laja style, which appears to have been used first in the Mixtec region of Oaxaca in the Late Classic (Winter 2007). The construction techniques, layout, and overall design of the Early Postclassic residence on Terrace S 19 very closely resemble those of the Late Postclassic two-patio house (Lanis­baa) complex excavated in Mound 1 at Dainzu­Macuilx6chitl by Markens et al.

About 20-25 cm beneath the Early Postclassic surface of the Western Patio Complex, I uncov­ered large patches of stucco floors that appear to be the remains of an earlier patio surface that were preserved when they were buried beneath a layer of fill during the terrace reconstruction (Figure 7). A single line of adjacent square cut stones with stucco floor both above and below extended out from beneath Structure E (Figure Se). This feature was most likely part of a Late Classic house foun­dation wall. Further evidence of residential archi­tecture from the earlier occupation was uncovered during the excavation of Structure C, which was originally constructed in the Late Classic but then reoriented and augmented during the Early Post-
