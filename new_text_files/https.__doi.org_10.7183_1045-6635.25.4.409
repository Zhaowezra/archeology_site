A REEVALUATION OF THE ABSOLUTE CHRONOLOGY OF CABUZA 
AND RELATED CERAMIC STYLES OF THE AZAPA VALLEY, 
NORTHERN CHILE 

Antti Korpisaari, Markku Oinonen, and Juan Chacama 
The nature and extent of the political and cultural influence of the Tiwanaku state (ca. A.D. 500-1100) in the Azapa Valley of northern Chile are debated topics . The absolute chronology of these contacts also remains somewhat unclear. Much of the debate has centered on the origins and chronological position of the Tiwanaku-related black-on-red ceramic style called Cabuza. ln order to reevaluate the chronological position of the Cabuza. Maytas-Chiribaya, and San Miguel ceramic styles and associated cultural phases of the Azapa Valley, we obtained a total of 16 new radiocarbon dates for the Azapa-6, Azapa­7/a, Azapa-141, and Azapa-143 cemeteries. All but one sample dated to the Late Intermediate period (ca. A.D. I 000-1450). We compare our results with previously published radiocarbon and thermoluminescence dates and carry out Bayesian prob­ability calculations, establishing the most likely chronological ranges for the three ceramic styles. Based on this research, we argue that the undeniable Tiwanaku influence seen in the Azapa Valley more likely reflects processes set in motion by the collapse of the Tiwanaku state rather than an attempt to colonize or indirectly control the Azapa Valley during the Middle Horizon (ca. A.D. 550-/000). 
La naturaleza y extension de la influencia polftica y cultural del estado de Ilwanaku (ca. 500-1100 d.C.) en el valle de Azapa, norte de Chile es actualmente un asunto en debate. Del mismo modo, la cronologia absoluta de estos contactos tambien es confusa. En dicho contexto, gran parte del debate esta relacionado con el estilo ceramico Cabuza, cuyos co/ores (negro sobre rojo) y espe­cialmente sus formas (keros), estarfan siendo influenciados por los canones culturales de Tiwanaku. En orden a reevaluar la posici6n cronol6gica de los estilos ceramicos y fases culturales correspondientes del valle de Azapa-Cabuza, Maytas-Chiribaya y San Miguel-obtuvimos un total de 16 nuevos fechados radiocarb6nicos provenientes de Los sitios funerarios Azapa-6, Azapa­71 a, Azapa-141 y Azapa-143. Todos, con excepcion de una muestra, se sitlian en el Periodo lntermedio Tardfo (ca. 1000-1450 d.C.). Comparamos nuestros resultados confechas de radiocarbono y termoluminiscencia ya publicadas, e hicimos calculos de probabilidad a traves del metodo bayesiano, estableciendo los rangos cronol6gicos mas probables para los tres estilos de ceramica arriba mencionados. Basados en nuestra investigaci6n, argumentamos que la innegable injluencia de Tiwanaku en el valle de Azapa refleja mds bien procesos que son producto del colapso de! estado de Tiwanaku, mas que un intento colonizador o de control indirecto llevado a cabo por este en el valle de Azapa durante el Horizonte Media (ca. 550-1000 d.C.).

that the Cabuza ceramic style, traditionally assigned to the Middle Horizon (ca. A.D. 550­1000), may in fact mostly correspond to the Late Intermediate period (ca. A.D. 1000-1450). 
The heartland of the Tiwanaku state was situ­ated in the southern Lake Titicaca basin in pre­sent-day Bolivia at an altitude of over 3 ,800 m asl (Figure 1). The construction of the monumental religious and administrative core of Tiwanaku began around A.D. 500, and the city reached its maximum extent towards the end of the first mil­lennium AD. (Janusek 2004, 2008; Kolata 1993, 2003; Ponce 1981; Vranich and Stanish 2013). AroundA.D. 600, the people of Tiwanaku began to acquire more and more direct control over their immediate neighbors (Janusek 2008; Janusek and Kolata 2003; Parssinen 2002; Stanish 2003). 
The Tiwanaku state developed a highly emblematic corporate art style. Portable artifacts remarkably similar to those typically found in the Tiwanaku heartland are spread over a large area encompassing much of highland Bolivia as well as parts of southern Peru and northern Chile (see Figure 1). However, most contemporary scholars see direct Tiwanaku control as having been largely limited to the Titicaca basin (e.g., Goldstein 2005; Janusek 2008; Stanish 2002, 2003, 2009). The people of Tiwanaku did set up colonies in some lower-elevation valley settings suitable for grow­ing maize and coca, among other crops. The best­documented Tiwanaku colony was situated in the Moquegua Middle Valley of southern Peru (Gold-

stein 2005, 2013). Another colony was probably located in the Central Valley of Cochabamba in present-day Bolivia (Anderson 2013), although more research in this area is needed. Traditionally, the Azapa Valley of northern Chile has been regarded as the site of another probable Tiwanaku colony. 
Between 2011 and 2013, the first author of this paper worked for a total of eight months at the Museo Universidad de Tarapaca San Miguel de Azapa,Arica, Chile. There he restudied the burial goods from a total of 470 tombs archaeologically excavated at the Azapa Valley cemetery sites Azapa-6, Azapa-71 a, Azapa-141, and Azapa-143 (Figure 2). All four of these have traditionally been regarded as dating wholly or in part to the Middle Horizon. At the same time, the three authors of this paper collected and dated a total of 16 new radiocarbon samples from all four cemeteries and compiled databases of previously published radiocarbon and TL dates. 
The recent development of Bayesian chrono­logical tools (Bronk Ramsey 2009a; Buck et al. 1996) has enabled quantitative analysis of cultural phases based on large datasets of radiocarbon dates (e.g., Bronk Ramsey et al. 2010; Manning et al. 2006; Oinonen et al. 2014). In this study, we apply Bayesian analysis in order to establish the most probable chronological ranges for the Cabuza, Maytas-Chiribaya, and San Miguel ceramic styles (Figures 3 and 4) in the Azapa Val-Jey, paying special attention to the chronological position of the Cabuza style. 
The Tiwanaku State and the Azapa Valley: 
A Short Research History 
As mentioned above, most scholars see the Cabuza ceramic style as reflecting the beginning of strong altiplano or Tiwanaku influence in the Azapa Valley. Nonetheless, during the past 25 years, widely divergent interpretations have been advanced concerning the dating of the Cabuza style and the role that the Tiwanaku state might have played in the introduction of this pottery style to the Azapa Valley. A good example of the traditional view is Jose Berenguer and Percy Dauelsberg's widely cited article "El Norte Grande en la 6rbita de Tiwanaku" (Berenguer and Dauelsberg 1989; see also Berenguer 2000:49­55; Dauelsberg 1985:278-279; Rivera 1991:29­30, 2008:966-968). These authors date the Cabuza phase as early as A.D. 300-700. Accord­ing to Berenguer and Dauelsberg, the people who used Cabuza pottery came from the altiplano and brought with them a new tradition of individual pit burials. These commoners were accompanied by a lesser number of Tiwanaku elites, who used multicolored four-pointed hats as their "symbols of office" and were buried in a relatively richer manner than the commoners. According to the rather unilinear cultural sequence proposed by

Berenguer and Dauelsberg, the Cabuza phase was followed by the Maytas-Chiribaya phase, which was seen as dating to A.D. 700-1000 and repre­senting a regional Tiwanaku phase in Azapa. 
In the early 1990s, Paul S. Goldstein (1996, 2005:103-111; see also Goldstein and Rivera 2004: 171-176) systematically surveyed the mid­dle Azapa Valley, locating 54 sherd scatters with Tiwanaku or Cabuza fragments. Nevertheless, he noted only three unambiguous Tiwanaku ceme­tery components, totaling under .5 ha in area. Goldstein (2005: 111) argues that "the most likely explanation oftheAzapa Valley's Tiwanaku occu­pation is as small enclaves of colonists from the Tiwanaku core region coexisting with a larger local population who emulated the Tiwanaku tra­dition in the Cabuza style." 
Also in the 1990s, Mauricio Uribe (1999; see also Uribe 1995; Uribe andAgtiero 2002) analyzed 1,836 ceramic vessels recovered in 568 pre­columbian burials in the Azapa Valley and neigh­boring areas. He identified 261 Cabuza vessels, but only 19 "proper" Tiwanaku vessels. Uribe thinks that the few Tiwanaku pieces were brought to the Azapa Valley from the Moquegua Middle Valley Tiwanaku colony-not from the Tiwanaku heartland. Uribe (1999: 197) further argues that Cabuza was a "local manifestation of the Tiwanaku horizon," which came about due to indirect cultural and symbolic Tiwanaku influence rather than direct Tiwanaku colonization. For Uribe, the sub­sequent appearance of the Maytas-Chiribaya ceramic style represents the beginning of a distinct ceramic tradition of the western valleys, probably as a reaction against the ideological connotations of Tiwanaku and the styles associated to it.

20 I 0) has published extensively on the bioarchae­ology of the Azapa Valley. Somewhat surprisingly, his investigations have indicated that "there is no genetic evidence for an intrusive pre-Inka alti­plano population in the Azapa Valley" (Sutter 2000:65). Furthermore, based on comparisons with ceramic chronologies of the Moquegua Val­ley, Sutter argues that both the Cabuza and the Maytas-Chiribaya ceramic traditions largely post­date the Middle Horizon (Sutter 2005: 185; see also Goldstein 2005: 107; Goldstein and Rivera 2004:172; Owen 1993:94, 359, 371-373, 405­406, 2005:54). 
Our understanding of absolute chronology advanced considerably in the late 1980s and 1990s due to three key research projects. The first of these was carried out by Virgilio Schiappacasse and col­leagues and produced a total of 45 thermolumines­cence dates from Azapa and Camarones valleys (Schiappacasse et al. 1991). Four years later, Oscar Espoueys and colleagues published 52 additional TL dates for the Azapa Valley (Espoueys et al.1995; see also Espoueys 1993a, 1993b). Furthermore, in 1997, Vicki Cassman presented 33 new radiocarbon dates in her Ph.D. dissertation (Cassman 1997; see also Sutter 1997:33-36, 2005:Tables 1-3).

LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 25, No. 4, 2014 
In addition to producing the thermolumines­cence dates mentioned above, Espoueys et al. (1995) compiled databases of existing absolute dates, calculating the most probable time spans for several Azapa Valley ceramic styles. According to this research, Cabuza pottery dates to AD. 500-­1225 and Maytas-Chiribaya pottery dates to AD. 800-1290. In other words, the manufacture of Cabuza style vessels began some 300 years earlier than that of Maytas-Chiribaya style vessels, but the two styles were highly overlapping, and vessels in both styles were manufactured well into the Late Intermediate period. Furthermore, the San Miguel style (AD. 990-1360) partly overlapped with both Cabuza and Maytas-Chiribaya styles. 
One is tempted to interpret such variety and overlap in Azapa Valley ceramic styles as evi­dence of ethnic diversity. Cassman's (1997) doc­toral research seems to prove otherwise. Her study of the textiles associated with 448 deceased indi­viduals from three cemetery sites (Azapa-71, Azapa-140, and PLM-9) shows that an assortment of shirt styles was found at all three sites and that many individuals had been buried with a variety of these styles. Another of Cassman's surprising findings was that 32 of 33 radiocarbon-dated tex­tile samples from the three cemeteries dated to 
A.D. 890-1425, that is, to the very end of the Tiwanaku period and-predominantly-to the post-Tiwanaku period. Furthermore, of"fourteen mummy bundles, which were previously identi­fied by archaeologists as corresponding to the Tiwanaku period, all but one turned out to be post­Ti wanaku (or post A.D. 1100)" (Cassman 1997:60). Cassman (1997:69; emphasis added) argues that "Tiwanaku influence was likely min­imal in Arica prior to A.D. 700. Sometime later, immigrants settled in Arica ... These immigrants may have been refugees escaping a political and/or agrarian collapse in the highlands." In other words, according to Cassman's research, ceramic, textile, and tomb styles that have tradi­tionally been interpreted as evidence of the Tiwanaku colonization of theAzapa Valley could in fact be evidence of the flight of some groups of people from the Tiwanaku heartland or the Moquegua Middle Valley Tiwanaku colony toward the Pacific Coast following the collapse of the Tiwanaku state (cf. Rothhammer and San­toro 2001). 
Materials and Methods 
One of the central goals of our own research has been to reconcile, as best as we can, the above­mentioned divergent views on the dating of the Cabuza pottery style and the role of the Tiwanaku state in the development and spread of this style. Although the Azapa Valley features a great num­ber of archaeological sites (the register of sites of the Museo Universidad de Tarapaca San Miguel de Azapa currently contains 142 entries), most of these are attributable to the Late Inter­mediate period. Only seven cemetery sites­Azapa-1, Azapa-3, Azapa-6, Azapa-71, Azapa-101, Azapa-141, and Azapa-143-have traditionally been attributed to the Middle Hori­zon (or to the Middle period, as this is known in Chilean archaeological nomenclature). Further­more, except for the San Lorenzo site (Azapa­11), which dates to the late Middle Horizon and the early Late Intermediate period (Munoz 2004:81-107; Munoz and Focacci 1985), practi­cally no Middle Horizon settlement sites have been clearly identified, excavated, and dated. They were probably situated on the fluvial terraces of the valley, which have been heavily affected by the spread of modem-day agriculture. 
The archaeological collections from Azapa-3 and Azapa-101 used to be housed in the Museo de Historia Natural of Santiago de Chile. Although they were recently moved to the Museo Univer­sidad de Tarapaca San Miguel de Azapa, they are currently being catalogued and thus remain closed to research. As for Azapa-1 , the type site for Cabuza, its collections are quite scattered, with relatively little material available for study. For all of these reasons, we chose to focus our research on the Azapa-6, Azapa-71, Azapa-141 , and Azapa­143 cemetery sites. 
Sample Selection 
Altogether, we were able to date a total of 16 new radiocarbon samples (Table 1). We preferred veg­etal fibers from basketry plates, bowls, and keros (n = 11), but our samples also included vegetal fibers from a capacho "carrying device" (Hela­3333), wood fibers from a spindle whorl (Hela­3142), and textile fibers from a tunic fragment 
(Hela-3179), a four-pointed hat fragment (Hela­3157), and a net bag (Hela-3143).
