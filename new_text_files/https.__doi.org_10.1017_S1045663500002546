Analyses of pollen and other terrestrial microfossils in sediment profiles from neotropical lakes can complement and extend archaeological studies by documenting the timing of prehistoric human disturbances within watersheds. However, assess­ing the scale of prehistoric human impact from sedimentary microfossil assemblages alone is often difficult. We explore here the utility of combining stable carbon isotope (513C) analyses of lake sediments and isotopic mixing models to improve our ability to gauge the extent of prehistoric human disturbance recorded in sediment profiles. Our test case involves the analy­sis of a sediment core from Laguna Bonillita on the central Caribbean slope of Costa Rica that spans approximately the last 2, 700 calendar years. Variations in the 513C values of the Laguna Bonillita sediments suggest that human population growth and environmental impacts in the watershed were at their maximum -cal yr 300 B.C. This finding is in keeping with archaeological evidence of rapid regional population growth at this time but differs from initial interpretations of the sed­iment record that were based on pollen and charcoal analyses alone. We believe that the use of stable carbon isotope data from sediment profiles can improve estimates of the scale of prehistoric human impact and in doing so improve the contri­butions of paleoecological research to archaeology.

Nuestro caso de prueba implica el andlisis de un nucleo de sedimento de Laguna Bonillita en la vertiente Caribe central de Costa Rica que atreviesa aproximadamente las ultimas 2, 700 aiios calibrados. las variaciones en las valores 813C de los sedimentos de Laguna Bonil­
lita sugieren que el crecimiento demogrdjico humano y las impactos ambientales en la cuenca estuvieran en su mdximo aprox­imadamente 300 aiios calibrados a.C. Este hallazgo concuerda con la evidencia arqueol6gica def crecimiento demogrdjico regional rdpido en este tiempo, pero se diferencia de interpretaciones iniciales de! registro de sedimento que estaban basadas unicamentes en las andlisis de polen y carbon.
