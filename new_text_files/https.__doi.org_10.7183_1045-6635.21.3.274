CLOTH PRODUCTION AND ECONOMIC INTENSIFICATION IN THE 
AREA SURROUNDING CHICHEN ITZA 

Traci Ardren, T. Kam Manahan, Julie Kay Wesp, and Alejandra Alonso 
Recent investigations at the site of Xuenkal on the plains north of Chichen Itza provide evidence of the changing regional political environment during the Terminal Classic Period (A.D. 900-1000). This paper examines a collection of spindle whorls recovered during the 2005, 2006, and 2007 field seasons of the Proyecto Arqueologico Xuenkal (PAX) as evidence for intensification of craft production. Through this analysis and comparison with spindle whorl collectionsfrom other Low­land Maya sites, we suggest the inhabitants of Xuenkal rapidly adapted to changing economic demands by increasing the amount of cloth produced in their residential settings, perhaps in response to increased tribute demands that emanated from the dominant political power of the region. Spinning and weaving is associated with the female gender during the Classic Period in Mesoamerica. Thus, intensification of this gendered activity not only produced excess materials for the state, but also reinforced its gender ideology. Analysis of these artifacts adds to the knowledge of Maya cloth production and addresses the nature ofChichen ltza's influence on regional sites during the height of its influence in the Terminal Classic period. 

Las excavaciones en el sitio de Xuenkal, ubicado en la region no rte de Chichen ltza, han permitido entender el cambio politico regional que se presento en el periodo Clasico Terminal (900-1000 d. C.). Para este estudio utilizamos una coleccion de mala­cates encontrados durante las temporadas de campo de 2005, 2006, y 2007 de! Proyecto Arqueologico Xuenkal (PAX) como evidencia de la intensificacion en la produccion artesanal coma consecuencia de un aumento en la demanda de materiales necesarios para la manufactura de textiles. Los resultados de este analisis y su comparacion con las colecciones de malacates de otros sitios en Yucatan sugieren que las elites de Xuenkal se incorporaron rapidamente al cambio politico. Hilar y tejer estan asociados con las mujeres en el periodo Clasico en Mesoamerica. De esta manera, la intens(ficacion de esta actividad no solamente produjo materias primas para el estado, sino tambien reforzo su ideolog(a. Un cambio en las motivos icono­graficos usados en los malacates sugiere un aumento de las practicas publicas y de su apoyo a la ideologfa estatal. A pesar de que la coleccion mas grande de malacates proviene de Chichen ltza, la de Xuenkal es una de las mas extensas en toda la penfnsula de Yucatan. El analisis de estos elementos permite un mejor entendimiento de la produccion textil, y refuerza la idea de coma Chichen ltza dirige y controla todas sus influencias en las sitios cercanos durante el Clasico Terminal.

Cloth Production and the Domestic Economy 
Classic period Maya figurines depict women and men engaged in a variety of activities, but only women are shown sitting at a loom or holding thick 
skeins of thread. Elite women depicted on carved monumental stelae are often shown wearing elab­orately embellished woven garments known as huipiles, and palace scenes depicted on elite ceramic vases are filled with cloth accoutrements both plain and elaborate, that scholars believe Mesoamerican women produced in domestic set­tings throughout the Classic world (Anawalt 1981; Ardren 2006; Brumfiel 1996; Hendon 2006; Joyce 2000). The close association between cloth pro­duction and ideal female gender roles was com­memorated in death through elaborate jade weaving tools deposited in the funerary tombs of queens at Copan, Palenque, Naranjo, Yaxuna and elsewhere (Ardren 2002). In the Postclassic Maya codices, the female gendering of cloth production is expressed as a variety of goddesses engaged in spinning and weaving on calendrically important days, with cloth often mentioned as an important offering to the gods. Spanish ethnohistoric accounts from Yucatan corroborate this evidential pattern and state that not only did women create elaborate products of cloth during the early Colonial period, but plain mantas or standard lengths of cotton cloth constituted a highly valued and central component of the native economy at contact, an element of Maya culture . that the Spanish manipulated for many centuries. Ethnographic research demonstrates a vibrant tra­dition of textile production by modern Maya women with deep and well-documented roots in the precontact period (Hendrickson 1995; Knoke de Arathoon et al. 1999; Schevill 1997; Schevill et al. 1991). But despite this rich body of evidence about the centrality of textiles and the gendered female nature of textile production in ancient Maya society, documenting the production of cloth in the past is notoriously difficult. Spindle whorls, the weights attached to spindles in order to lengthen 

plant fibers as they are spun into thread, remain the best evidence of cloth production in the archaeo­logical record of the Maya Lowlands. 
Julia Hendon's research at the Sepulturas area of Copan demonstrates how we can see the inter­section of household-and state-based power sys­tems in the archaeological record of domestic groups (Hendon 1997). In an analysis of artifacts from floors and middens at elite residential com­pounds, Hendon uses the large number of spindle whorls to argue that elite women were producing cloth in patio areas within the compounds. These publically visible areas were likely under the con­trol of elites and as such were highly charged are­nas for the reproduction of gendered ideals. Women who spun or wove in these areas were performing their appropriate gender-specific activity, and thus contributing not only cloth but also ideology to the state. Studies at Ceren have used plaster casts of garden areas to produce information on specific plants such as agave used in Classic period weav­ing. Marilyn Beaudry-Corbett and Sharisse McCaf­ferty suggest the range of data from associated households at Ceren shows women were highly specialized in the related tasks of fiber storage, pro­cessing, spinning, dyeing, and weaving (Beaudry­Corbett and McCafferty 2002). This specialization clearly extended beyond the needs of the house­hold. In a study of cloth production in the Andes, Cathy Lynn Costin argues that this type of spe­cialization is "social labor that serves to create net­works beyond the resident group, and ... is materially and ideologically connected to power hierarchies of all sorts" (Costin 1996: 115). Thus, elite Maya women of Xuenkal and elsewhere not only engaged in cloth production but in doing so, reinforced the ideological gender roles of the time. 
Despite the abundance of evidence on the role of cotton manta production in the early Colonial sources ofYucatan, the archaeological evidence for cloth production prior to Spanish contact has not been well documented for the northern Maya Low­lands (Patch 1993; Restall 1997). In his discussion of Maya life prior to contact, Friar Diego de Landa says cloth was the second most important com­modity of exchange after salt and that a great amount of two kinds of cotton was grown in Yucatan (1978).

demonstrates both the great time depth (the earli­est examples date to Middle Preclassic [ca.700­300 B.C.] contexts) and the increasing frequency as well as diversity of spindle whorls throughout the Classic period. In their study of spindle whorls from 10 sites, these artifacts are most common in later contexts, doubling in frequency by the Post­classic (Hernandez and Peniche 2007: Table 1). While relatively common in archaeological con­texts, rarely are spindle whorls integrated into mod­els of Classic period economies or exchange systems. 
Economic Intensification within the Chichen Itza Polity 
Chichen ltza has been characterized as one of the most expansionist, mercantile, and hierarchically organized ancient Maya polities (Andrews 1983, 1990; Andrews et al. 2003; Andrews and Robles 1985; Cobos 2007; Ringle et al. 1998; Schele and Freidel 1990; Schele and Mathews 1998; Tozzer 1930, 1957; Wren and Schmidt 1991). Despite lin­gering debates on the political organization of Chichen ltza, evidence for the economic basis of political authority is definitive. The dominant themes within the extensive iconography are mil­itaristic and center on regional conquest and the extraction of tribute. Economic power is attested by the quantities of prestige goods that flowed into Chichen ltza from across Mesoamerica. Expan­sionistic control of the region between central Yucatan and the north coast (including Xuenkal and environs) likely was underway by A.D. 900 if not earlier (Andrews et al. 1989; Andrews et al. 2003). Isla Cerritos was the primary port on the north coast (Andrews et al. 1988; Andrews and Gallareta 1986; Gallareta 1998), and the site of Xuenkal, 45 km north of Chichen Itza was midway along the most direct route between the urban cen­ter and its port site (Ardren et al. 2005: Figure I). The articulation of Chichen ltza's expanding polit­ical economy with existing regional domestic economies was only possible through dramatic shifts in the household organization of labor and means of production as regional smallholders adapted to changing economic landscapes and political demands. Since 2004, the Proyecto Arque­ol6gico Xuenkal, or PAX, has conducted research in the region to test how the inhabitants of Xuenkal weathered the political and economic instability that resulted in the Terminal Classic abandonment of many centers in northern Yucatan by adapting to rapid ideological changes emanating from Chichen ltza. We believe evidence recovered to date demonstrates they quickly integrated them­selves (or were forcibly integrated) into the emerg­ing regional political economy by increasing the

production of craft goods. Recent excavations at a Terminal Classic period platform along the newly paved road from Espita to Cenotillo provide evi­dence for this intensification. 
Sotuta Platforms and Structure FN-129 at Xuenkal 
Xuenkal was first recorded as a Rank II category site in the classification system determined by the Atlas Arqueol6gico del Estado de Yucatan and is considered urban, although certainly not on the scale as the neighboring Rank I site of Chichen Itza (Garza T. and Kurjack 1980). Investigation of Xuenkal began in 1988 when members of the Cupul Survey (Andrews et al. 1989) sketch-mapped the site center and collected surface artifacts. Building upon research conducted by Rafael Burgos as part of the construction of a new highway through the site, Ardren and Manahan initiated the Proyecto Arqueologico Xuenkal (PAX) in 2004 with per­mission from the Instituto Nacional de Antropol6gfa e Historia (Ardren et al. 2005). To date, PAX has mapped over 600 structures within the 1 km2 urban core of the site (Figure 2), surveyed an additional . 8 km2 of the periphery, excavated 120 off-mound test pits to establish site chronology, fully excavated 6 residential structures, performed a botanical survey of 22 rejolladas or dry sink holes in the area, and initiated regional reconnaissance and mapping of the hinterlands. 
As a result of four seasons of PAX research at Xuenkal, we have documented the history of a polity that was settled by the Late Preclassic (300 B.C.-A.D. 300) and occupied continuously throughout the Classic period (A.O. 300-1000). Xuenkal 's occupation is expansive in the transition from the Early Classic to Late Classic periods (the latter associated with Cehpech sphere ceramics), when the settlement reached its apogee in terms of areal extent (estimated to be 2-3 km2) and density. The substantial Terminal Classic occupations, con­taining high percentages (90-99 percent) of Sotuta sphere ceramics, most closely associate the site with Chichen ltza. Changes in ceramics are asso­ciated with both a significant shift in settlement pat­terning (from dispersed residences to freestanding platforms supporting multiple residential struc­tures, all of which are clustered in the site center) and a cessation of monumental construction, both of administrative and religious structures. During this period other northern Lowland centers were either abandoned and lack evidence of Sotuta occu­pation, such as Coba (Robles 1990), Oxkintok (Varela 1998), and Ek Balam (Bey et al. 1998); or contain very limited quantities of Sotuta materials in discrete areas within their latest contexts, such as Uxmal (Barrera Rubio and Huchim Herrera 1989), Dzibilchaltun (Andrews and Andrews 1980),andYaxuna (Suhleretal.1998).At Xuenkal, in contrast, ceramic analysis of 22,958 sherds recovered from the test excavation program revealed that fully 38 percent of the sample pertain to the Terminal Classic Sotuta sphere, compared to 31 percent from the Late Classic Cehpech sphere. 
The center of the site was heavily fortified by a system of defensive constructions. These included a wall that ringed most of the site center, encom­passing roughly 7.5 ha, plus a network of shorter defensive walls linking buildings within its con­fines. Although direct chronometric dating of the features has not been possible, architectural asso­ciations suggest the constructions date to the end of the Late Classic and are contemporary with other reported fortifications within the region. 
Analysis of artifacts and architectural data reveals that Late Classic Xuenkal is diverse but entirely consistent with regional patterns. A full range of settlement including modest residential structures, civic structures such as temples and probable funerary pyramids, as well as elite resi­dential compounds clearly fall within the northern Lowland tradition of nucleated settlement. A loosely defined north-south axis defines the settle­ment pattern, which utilized natural limestone ele­vations. As at other sites in the region, much of the Late Classic settlement at Xuenkal built upon a base of simple platforms and residential structures established in the Early Classic period. During the Late Classic period these same structures reached their maximum expression in scale and architec­tural skill with the use of core veneer architecture and mosaic stone decoration. 
Terminal Classic settlement at the site in con­trast brought new architectural forms consisting of freestanding platforms concentrated in the site cen­ter. These architectural units all appear to be late, single-component constructions, although some likely encased earlier unrelated structures. One Ter­minal Classic Sotuta group excavated in 2007 held
