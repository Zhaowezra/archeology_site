
MULTI-PROXY ANALYSIS OF PLANT USE 
AT FORMATIVE PERIOD LOS NARANJOS, HONDURAS 

Shanti Morell-Hart, Rosemary A. Joyce, and John S. Henderson 
Paleoethnobotanical analyses of samples excavated at Los Naranjos, Honduras, provide an unprecedented record of the diversity of plants used at an early center with monumental architecture and sculpture dating between 1000 and 500 B.C. and contribute to understandings of early village life in Mesoamerica. Los Naranjos is the major site adjacent to Lake Yojoa, where analysis of an important pollen core suggests very early clearing of the landscape and shifts in the relative prevalence of certain plants over time, including increases in maize. Our results from starch grain, phytolith, and macrob­otanical analysis complicate interpretation of previous pollen core dates, suggesting that maize was not as central as expected to the early inhabitants of the settlement. Moreover, with identification of macrobotanical remains recovered from flotation of sediments and extraction of microbotanical remains from adhering sediments and the surfaces of obsidian tools, we can compare the potential of each analysis in interpretations of plant use. No single method would have allowed recovery and identification of all the plants documented across sample types. The presence of botanical residues on the obsidian tools provides direct evidence of processing. Even in the small sample analyzed, we can recognize tools used exclusively for culi­nary processing, tools used only for non-culinary tasks, and multi-purpose tools.

tures of human figures and zoomorphic creatures (Stone 1934; Strong et al. 1938). These are rec­ognizable today as products of the Middle For­mative period, based on subject matter and spe­cific iconography, confirming Los Naranjos as one of the settlements where monumental archi­tecture and sculpture developed at this early pe­riod (Joyce and Henderson 2002, 2010).Acenter of early social complexity, Los Naranjos occupies a special place as one of the easternmost sites known to have either monumental architecture or monumental sculpture during this period, along with Yarumela, Honduras, and Chalchuapa, El Salvador (Dixon et al. 1994; Sharer 1989). 
Research of early occupation at this settle­ment has been complemented by discussions of early landscape modification and transition to agriculture. These discussions have emphasized palynological data recovered from a core of the Lake Yojoa sediments (Rue 1987, 1989). Arise in maize (Zea) pollen detected in this core was as­signed approximate dates of ca. 2500 B.C., based on one radiocarbon date from the core that shortly preceded the change in pollen profile. More re­cently, Rue et al. (2002:268) report the calibration of that radiocarbon date to the mid-fourth mil­lennium B.C. and on that basis push back the growth of maize agriculture in the area around Lake Yojoa to ca. 3400 B.C. 
Although the lake sediment core provides an excellent index of regional ecology and cultiva­tion near the shores of Lake Yojoa, until now, di­rect evidence for plant use at the early archaeo­logical site of Los Naranjos has been lacking. In this article, we report on new data from recent macrobotanical and microbotanical analyses that provide the first direct evidence of plant use in Middle Formative Los Naranjos (Morell-Hart 20 11). Identified residues included seeds and other large anatomical structures as well as mi­croscopic starch grains and phytoliths. Evidence for maize was limited, beans were scant, and squashes were entirely absent, while a variety of root crops, palms, and other plants were recov­ered, including some possibly employed for non­culinary purposes. The residues of these plants were extracted directly from sediments and arti­facts associated with various contexts and spatial locations and represent the detritus of daily and ritual activity. These data require reconsideration of the assumption that by 800 B.C. the residents of Los Naranjos would have been largely depen-

dent on maize agriculture and underline the im­portance of considering multiple sources of evi­dence for human relations with plants. 
Early Plant Use in Honduras 
The El Gigante rock shelter in southeastern Hon­duras provides the most robust record of early plant use in the region (Scheffler 2009). There, a stratigraphic sequence with associated calibrated radiocarbon dates from before 9000 B .C. to around 5500 B .C. yielded evidence of plant use in the early and middle Archaic period. Plants identified in levels with dates calibrated between 6500 and 5500 B.C. included Spondias (ciruela), Persea (avocado),Agave (maguey), and examples of both beans (Phaseolus) and squashes (Cucurbita). Not evident in these Archaic levels were remains of maize (Neff et al. 2006). Although maize cobs were plentiful (more than 1,000 reported), they were limited to relatively recent strata, the earliest dating between 2000 and 1500 cal. B.C., during the early Formative period (Scheffler 2009). 
Pollen data recovered from lake sediment cores, at both Lake Yojoa and near Copan in far western Honduras, appear fairly consistent with the macrofossil, stratigraphic, and radiocarbon evidence from the El Gigante rock shelter. Cores in the Aguada Petapilla suggested that the earliest cultivation of maize in that region dates to around 2600 B .C. (Rue et al. 2002; Webster et al. 2005). McNeil et al. (2010), disputing the obsidian-hy­dration dating results linked to the chronology of that core, place cultivation of maize to 900-790 cal. B.C at the latest. Regardless of earliest entry to the region , Zea pollen appears to increase at the same time as heavy deposits of charcoal, inter­preted by all authors as an early signature of hu­man-set fires intended to selectively encourage certain plants. McNeil et al. (2010:1018) even note that this clearing marks "the most dramatic period of deforestation in the past 3,000 years." 
Evidence of plant use from all three of these projects has been interpreted to indicate that maize cultivation grew in importance during the Formative period. It has not been possible to clar­ify the precise timing of the postulated shift to re­liance on maize based on the data available from these cores. Rue et al. (2002:268) suggest that the Lake Yojoa core shows that "agriculture intensi­fied around 1000 B.C., after which it remained stable with no 'collapse."' Evidence from Aguada Petapilla includes a peak in charcoal around 900 B.C., interpreted in a similar way (Rue et al. 2002:269), while McNeil (2010) notes that by 790 B.C. at latest, maize agriculture was firmly established near Copan. At El Gigante, the strati­graphic levels associated with abundant maize macrofossils have associated calibrated radiocar­bon dates ranging from 1760 to 800 B.C. 

A contrasting point of evidence from the Early Formative is provided by analysis of bone chem­istry carried out on human remains recovered in eastern Honduras in the caves ofTalgua. There, one sample calibrated to ca. 1400 B.C. shows that the individuals involved "were not consuming sub­stantial quantities of maize" (Herrmann 2002: 17). Unfortunately, no data are available from Talgua for the period around 1000 B .C., a time in the For­mative period that the other studies have identified as the likely peak of reliance on maize. 
The new evidence we report here adds to the existing data by providing the first direct infor­mation about plant use at Los Naranjos during the Formative period. It supports an emerging picture that portrays maize as less central to early human plant use in Honduras than previously assumed. It also extends this picture of more diverse plant use, with maize a minor element, somewhat later, into the Middle Formative period after 1000 B .C. The new data from Los Naranjos raise the ques­tion of the degree to which plant use in early Honduras should be seen as uniform or subject to more localized patterns. 
Plant Use at Middle Formative Los Naranjos 
Our research focuses on analysis of samples col­lected during excavations in 2002 and 2003 in an area immediately adjacent to monumental Struc­ture IV at Los Naranjos. The construction history of Structure IV was first investigated by Claude Baudez and Pierre Becquelin (1973:49-51). Their excavations detected a buried stage of construc­tion, a 6-m-tall platform, dated to the early Mid­dle Formative Jara! phase, to which Baudez and Becquelin (1973) assigned calendar dates of ca. 800-400 B.C. (Unless otherwise indicated, all AMS and radiocarbon dates referenced are cali­brated calendar years. Phase estimates are also

calendar years, unless the original excavators used uncalibrated radiocarbon years, a practice we do not follow.) This buried construction represents the earliest dated occupation of the site that Baudez and Becquelin recognized. In 2003 and 2004, a Berkeley-Cornell project directed by Rosemary Joyce and John Henderson carried out excavations immediately west of the visible plat­form of Structure IV, whose latest construction stages date to the Late Formative period (after 400 B.C.). These excavations were intended to pro­vide a more extensive picture of habitation in the area that might have preceded the construction of the Jaral phase platform. The excavations were designed to compare the occupational history of Los Naranjos with the more recently documented site of Puerto Escondido, located in the Ulua River valley to the north, a settlement continu­ously occupied from before 1600 B .C. through the end of the Middle Formative (Joyce 2007; Joyce and Henderson 2001, 2007, 2010). One pottery type defined at Los Naranjos, Bogran Rugose en 
Zones, dated to the Jaral phase by Baudez and Becquelin (1973), was indistinguishable from pottery at Puerto Escondido with secure dates be­tween 1100 and 900 B.C. This chronological equivalence suggested that Los Naranjos might have been occupied prior to the building of the earliest known monumental platform at Struc­ture IV by people whose discarded pottery was mixed in construction fill of a later date. The con­struction of the earliest platforms implied the presence of such a population, and the Lake Yo­joa core data suggested that these people would have been long established in the Jake shore area when the first stage of Structure IV was built ca. 800 B.C. Understanding regional networks during the transition from the Early Formative period to the Middle Formative period required determin­ing whether the habitation sites of these earlier people could be identified. 
Excavations in 2003 and 2004 
Ground penetrating radar and magnetometer sur­veys of an L-shaped area north and west of Struc­ture IV, covering approximately 6,250 m2 (Tchakirides et al. 2006), provided initial guid­ance for the placement of excavation units. For the paleoethnobotanical results reported here, the samples came from a block of excavations in an area west of Structure IV, extending 10 m east­west and 14 m north-south. A maximum depth of 
1.5 m was excavated in this area, although not all excavated units were carried through to that depth. In those units excavated to 1.5 m, the low­est 25-30 cm appeared to be naturally occurring sediments, mixed gravels, and sand, suggesting that in these areas, at least, excavations reached the original ground surface occupied by the first inhabitants along Lake Yojoa. 
The stratigraphy consisted of four distinct units, the two most recent stemming from con­struction and expansion of the monumental ar­chitecture, and the two earlier attributed to the res­idents who already lived in this location when major construction began. The stratigraphic sec­tion likely began with a surface at 1 .2 m below modern ground level. On this surface we defined a series of features that are interpreted as the re­mains of a round-ended structure associated with hearths, sheet midden, and post holes. Included in the materials recovered here were obsidian flakes and blades and ceramics, including large articu­lated fragments of a bowl related to the Bogran Rugose en Zones type. 
This early surface was succeeded by three oth­ers, separated by thin lenses of sediment (totaling 10-19 cm between surfaces). The uppermost of these three surfaces was located at approximately 85-90 cm below the modern ground surface. Here, a dense deposit of crumbly, carbon-rich material 19 to 25 cm thick covered sections of in situ burned clay wall bases from rectangular buildings, none completely preserved in outline. In addition to macrobotanical remains, the car­bon-rich deposit yielded a large number of ob­sidian flakes (249) and blades (25). 
Immediately above these burned building foundations was the first of two clay fill units ex­tending across the entire excavation area. This 53­cm-thick brown clay fill was heterogeneous in texture and contained localized areas of clays of other colors, as well as very small sherds and ob­sidian flakes and blades. It was immediately cov­ered by a contrasting 19-cm-thick yellow clay fill with similar texture and color mottling. 
The two more recent stratigraphic units are interpreted as construction fills for terraces asso­ciated with two stages of the construction of Structure IV. The most recent includes pottery

dating after 400 B.C. The earlier brown clay fill lacks specific diagnostic pottery types, but should be associated with the Middle Formative Jaral phase terrace identified by earlier excavators. This stratigraphic sequence implies that both sur­faces with identifiable architectural remains pre­date the first stage of construction of the Jaral structure. The burned house wall bases may be in­terpreted as products of deliberate demolition at the moment the new building project was initi­ated. This deliberate activity would account for the continued integrity of the crumbly carbon rich material that extends over the area and un­derlies the first brown clay fill. The earliest resi­dential features identified likely date to around 1100-900 B .C., based on comparison of the as­sociated pottery with the ceramic sequence from Puerto Escondido (Joyce and Henderson 2007). They presumably represent occupation by vil­lagers prior to the initiation of large-scale con­struction projects at this location. 
The plant remains analyzed by Morell-Hart came from the two surfaces with architectural re­mains, the more recent from the demolition of house structures in conjunction with the con­struction of the Jaral phase platform , the older from deeply buried levels dating to ca. 1100-900 
B.C. They were produced by sediments subjected to flotation and from obsidian tools sampled for phytolith and starch residues. They thus provide information about the range of plant-related prac­tices carried out by the residents who built the monumental platforms at Los Naranjos, succes­sors of those whose initial land clearing activities more than 1,000 years earlier were detected in the Lake Yojoa pollen core. 
Previous Paleoethnobotanical 
Data from lake Yojoa 
The core from Lake Yojoa revealed variation in plant pollen over time (Rue 1987, 1989). The earliest levels were marked by high percentages of tree species and the absence of cultigens. Mark­ers interpreted by Rue as evidence of early agri­culture in the Archaic period included rises in cheno-ams (chenopod or amaranth forms) and maize and low relative percentages of other grasses. Agricultural intensification was inferred from later increases in sunflower family, rag­weed, and other disturbed-and fallowed-area plants. From around 1000 B.C., the pollen record evidenced no major vegetation changes, aside from a short period of potential abandonment and reforestation marked by pine tree pollen. How­ever, Rue (1987, 1989) saw no evidence of ape­riod of abandonment marked by depopulation in levels inferred to originate during the end of the Classic period. 
The record of pollen recovered from this core must be qualified by the fact that many plants currently in the area are insect-pollinated. Ento­mophilous pollination results in fewer grains sim­ply dropping into the lake and becoming incorpo­rated into sediment layers. Due to the paucity of insect-borne pollen, the majority of pollen data re­covered from the Lake Yojoa core necessarily re­lates to anemophilous species po11inated through wind-borne grains. Therefore, the pollen record does not provide a complete picture of plant use along the lakeside, nor does it provide direct evi­dence of plant use at Los Naranjos itself. Cautions have also been issued in the Maya area, where re­searchers have noted that shifts in pollen signa­tures may actually reflect fallowing practices (rise in grasses) or the management of forest home gar­dens (rise in arboreal taxa), rather than shifts in forest succession following human depopulation or abandonment (Ford 2008). In our work, mac­robotanical and microbotanical samples were an­alyzed in an effort to fill in the existing picture of ethnobotanical practice at Lake Yojoa, making use of both sediments and artifacts recovered in excavations at Los Naranjos itself. Such analysis provides more direct evidence of human-plant in­teractions tied to ancient communities. 
Analysis of Plant Remains from Los Naranjos: 
Sampling Strategy 
The paleoethnobotanical data from Los Naranjos encompass six kinds of contexts and were recov­ered from light fraction macrobotanical samples and microbotanical extractions from obsidian ar­tifacts. Heavy fraction samples were collected but were unavailable for analysis, and remain in Hon­duras. The selection of artifacts for analysis al­lowed the identification of plant use associated with specific artifacts and enabled the recovery of complementary botanical data represented at the smallest microscopic level. No ground stone arti­facts were recovered from the early levels that

are the focus of this study. Obsidian artifacts, how­ever, were abundant in all excavation units and the entire collection was available for sampling. 
The analyzed residues come from both Late Early Formative and Early Middle Formative time periods (Table 1) and represent interior sur­faces, matrices between surfaces, architectural fill, pit fills, structural collapse matrices, and a high-density midden. Excavators systematically drew bulk samples for macrobotanical analysis from each locus on-site. Morell-Hart carried out microbotanical analysis on the residues extracted from seven of the obsidian artifacts recovered in the course of excavations, including both phy­tolith and starch grain studies. Both microbotan­ical and macrobotanical samples were judgmen­tally selected by Morell-Hart and Joyce for analysis after initial processing (see below). Al­though this strategy limits representativeness of the samples for the site as a whole, our results are nonetheless notable for the wide array of plants recovered, referencing a broad spectrum of eth­nobotanical activities. 
The overall diversity of contexts and artifacts was optimal in revealing patterns and anomalies of practice over a variety of micro-landscapes (Morell-Hart 2011). The richness of the data set at Los Naranjos enabled us to ask questions that would have been impossible at data-impoverished sites (usually due to preservation issues) or sites where only one type of data was obtained (usually due to collection or storage issues). The incorpo­ration of multiple lines of archaeobotanical data was augmented by the optimization of methods to maximize recovery of each type of residue. 
Methods. Methods for processing and analyz­ing the macrobotanical light fraction samples and the microbotanical obsidian artifact residues fol­lowed protocols well-delineated in contemporary studies (Hastorf 1999; Pearsall 2008; Perry 2004; Piperno 2006; Piperno et al. 2000). Below, we outline the specifics of each method of analysis. 
The light fractions of the macro botanical sam­ples were obtained through flotation processing in the field. A modified SMAP flotation machine (fol­lowing Watson 1976) was constructed and used on­site for flotation of the bulk sediment samples. In this technique, water was added to each sediment sample and the mixture was agitated. This bucket of material was run through the modified SMAP machine and macrobotanical remains (the "light fractions") were recovered from the material that floated to the surface. After extraneous clays and silts had been removed, the heavy material was col­lected as a separate fraction and curated. Once the light fractions of each sample were fully dried, they were exported for analysis at the Paleoeth­nobotany Laboratory at U.C. Berkeley. 
In the laboratory, Morell-Hart first scanned the light fraction samples to judge the relative density of charred archaeobotanical remains. Scanning took place under binocular dissecting microscopes, using reflected light from fiber op­tic light sources, at a range of power between 5X and 30X. Scanning was utilized for an initial overall assessment of the samples, whereas sort­ing was employed for detailed analysis and iden­tification. During the scanning process, items were not actually removed from the sample, but identified and noted. Macrobotanical samples were then prioritized by Morell-Hart in order of relative density of charred material. 
Once the samples were selected by Morell­Hart and Joyce for greater recovery of charred plant remains and to explore specific contexts , the process of sorting began. In this procedure, Morell-Hart divided the light fractions of the floated sediment samples according to particle size, using geological sieves. This size division fa­cilitated and expedited the process of sorting and concentrated a certain range of particle sizes within a certain degree of magnification. Charred materials, and other materials such as bone or snails, were removed from the sample once iden­tified under the microscope. Morell-Hart then performed basic initial identification to designate wood, parenchymous tissue, seeds, and other ma­terials. A variety of tools were employed to aid in this endeavor (probes, dental picks, tweezers, and similar instruments). 
After diagnostic specimens were separated for classification, and non-diagnostic specimens were removed for later classification, the identifica­tion of charred botanical materials was completed. Morell-Hart used morphological attributes to identify macrobotanical specimens, generally in­cluding size, the shape of the macrobotanical specimen's "footprint," surface patterning , and other related morphological characteristics, such as presence or absence of a testa.

with archaeobotanical specimens, morphologies were often drastically altered through taphonomic processes, complicating identification (Boardman and Jones 1990; Hubbard and al Azm 1990; Smith and Jones 1990; Stewart and Robertson 1971). For this reason, many remains were left uniden­tified. Other unknown or unrecognized yet po­tentially diagnostic specimens were drawn and photographed by Morell-Hart and several under­graduate student assistants, with the expectation that they may eventually be identified. 
Morell-Hart compared identifiable specimens with materials in the modern reference collec­tions housed in the UCB Paleoethnobotany Lab­oratory and with images in books (e.g., Lentz and Dickau 2005; Martin and Barkley 1973) and online in various databases (e.g., Kew Royal Botanic Gardens 2011; United States Department of Agriculture 2011). Once identification was complete, surviving portions of the macrobotan­ical specimen and taphonomic transformations were noted, for additional clues as to potential processing regimens (Fosberg 1960; Pearsall 2008). After cataloging the macrobotanical spec­imens, Morell-Hart curated all removed materials in gelatin capsules and boxes, labeled with ac­companying site and contextual information. 
For the artifact residue extractions, Morell­Hart followed a much different set of protocols. As indicated by studies of stone tools in Aus­tralia, starch grains found in surrounding soils are often distinct from those recovered from tools, indicating that the starches found in pores and crevices of artifacts are likely not contaminated by sediment-borne starches (Atchison and Fullagar 1998). Even so, in order to control for potential contamination, Morell-Hart completed two sepa­rate extractions for each artifact: a primary wash to remove adhering residues and a secondary son­ication to remove embedded materials in fissures and pores. Materials recovered from the adhering sediment were relegated to general "taxa en­countered and likely utilized and/or processed," whereas residues sonicated from the artifacts were classified as likely to be associated with actual ar­tifact uses. 
For each artifact sampled, the adhering sedi­ment was first removed by rubbing all surfaces of the artifact in distilled water, using powder-free latex examination gloves. Although many re-

searchers use toothbrushes for this procedure, abrasive brushing was avoided, as some of the ar­tifacts may later be analyzed for use wear. Such analyses of wear patterns are complicated by scratching even from the softest of toothbrushes (Hester 1997). Moreover, gloves could be dis­carded after processing an artifact, eliminating po­tential contamination through reusing tools like toothbrushes, and eliminating the time required to sterilize toothbrushes between each use. After re­moval of the adhering residue, Morell-Hart cen­trifuged each sample at 5,000 rpm for five min­utes to concentrate the residue into a small plug at the base of the tube. During this process, the residue extracts were maintained in the process­ing water to avoid potential damage to starch grains by re-desiccating them. 
After removing the adhering matrix as one sample, Morell-Hart placed each artifact in an­other beaker of distilled water and sonicated it in a Baxter Ultrasonic Cleaner at level 2. Sonication took place for 10 minutes. For each obsidian ar­tifact, the surfaces exhibiting potential wear were immersed in the water, while other surfaces were kept clear. This process extracted the residue em­bedded within the pores and fissures of each ar­tifact, ideally related to use wear of the lithic tool. As with the adhering residue sample, Morell­Hart concentrated this residue through centrifu­gation at 5,000 rpm for 5 minutes, maintaining the residue in the original processing water. 
The "adhering" and "sonicated" residue sam­ples were mounted on glass slides, using only the distilled water effluvium as mounting medium. Morell-Hart then viewed each sample under a transmitted light Nikkon microscope at different magnifications. Phytoliths and starch grains were counted to 200, or to the maximum available quantity (Piperno 2006), and identified to the smallest possible taxonomic designation. The rest of the slide was then scanned for less common phytoliths and starch grains, and other microremains such as raphides and druses (dis­tinctive crystalline structures present in some plant tissues). 
As with the macrobotanical samples, the mi­crobotanical residues extracted from obsidian tools were identified using all means available. Those specimens that were identifiable by Morell­Hart were compared with materials in the modern reference collections housed in the Paleoethnob­otany Laboratory and with reference images found in books and online. 
Results: Taxa Represented 
The taxonomic richness of Formative period sam­ples from Los Naranjos is substantial. We recov­ered a minimum of 36 and a maximum of 70 dis­tinct taxa (Table l) from 17 loci at Los N aran jos. This minimum number accounts for the possibil­ity that some taxa were identified through one type of residue analysis (e.g., "Poaceae sp. 4" seed recovered from Light Fraction) but redun­dant in another type of residue analysis with spec­imens that were unidentifiable, non-diagnostic, or diagnostic to a different taxonomic clade (e.g., "Panicoideae sp." phytolith recovered from Ad­hering Sediment). The maximum number of dis­tinct taxa accounts for the possibility that no over­lap exists between differentially identified residues. The actual number of recovered taxa is likely somewhere in between these two figures. 
We record the total counts of each taxon in the final column of Table 1 to reflect the combined number of instances of each taxon recovered. Sed­iments adhering to artifacts are likely more repre­sentative of surrounding matrices and activities, whereas sonicated materials are likely more rep­resentative of actual artifact use (Pearsall 2008; Perry 2004). We calculated final ubiquity values using only the adhering sediments and light frac­tions of flotation samples (Table 2). This way, each location was counted only once in "overlap­ping" loci from which both types of samples were taken. Integrating the botanical data in this way also allows us a better overall view of taxon pres­ence across the site, in spite of the fact that each recorded presence might represent a different anatomical part (phytolith, starch grain, fruit, or seed). The most commonly recovered taxa are represented in Table 2, in order of ubiquity. 
Plants with Known Edible Uses 
Several potential or definitive grain species were identified in the Los Naranjos samples. We re­covered maize (Zea mays) in the form of phy­toliths, starch grains, and a charred kernel from adhering sediments, sonicated material, and one light fraction of a bulk flotation sample. No other

kernel, cupule, or cob fragments were noted in the flotation samples. If any other maize fragments were present, they lacked diagnostic surface mor­phology or identifiable gross morphological char­acteristics. Two amaranth (Amarantus sp.) seeds were also recovered from light fraction samples, in addition to several chia (Salvia sp.) seeds, per­haps marking the use of chia for food, as has been noted further north in Mexico. The cultiva­tion of such grain species is an expected occur­rence in traditional ethnobotanical paradigms for Southeastern Mesoamerica. Cultivation activities could have taken place both in home gardens and 
in formally defined fields. 
Obsidian tools from Los Naranjos also re­vealed evidence of root crop use through the re­covery of starch grains. We identified tuberous roots including leren (Calathea sp.) , manioc (Manihot esculenta), and sweet potato (Jpomoea batatas). In each of these cases, microbotanical residues were the only means by which we could recover information about underground storage tissues of the species. As with the grain species, plants used for edible underground storage organs could have been cultivated in home gardens, as well as fields. 
Other potential staple food species are less well represented at Los Naranjos. The common bean (Phaseolus sp.) was recovered only once. 
Considering its designation as one of the "trinity" 
of staple species (including squash and maize), and the fact that it has diagnostic starch grains, phytoliths, and macroremains, the low recovery is notable. This paucity may indicate particularities of processing techniques (i.e., rare obsidian tool use; macrobotanical bias toward non-consumable parts of plant), modes of discard, or infrequent ac­tual use. This domesticated species is associated with deliberate cultivation practices, similar to root crops and grain species. 
Tree-cropping practices are likely represented by Annona and Arecaceae species. A recovered custard apple (Annona sp.) seed is the lone rep­resentative of the taxon. Although a commonly consumed fruit, it is not considered to be a staple crop, so the relatively low frequency (n = 1) is un­surprising. The limited recovery may also suggest other non-culinary practices for the species, like those noted in Standley and Steyermark's eth­nobotanical study (1946): "[Annona glabra] is often utilized along the Atlantic coast of Central America for bottle stoppers and floats for fishing nets and lines. The fruit is insipid and seldom eaten by people but there is a popular belief, per­haps correct, that it is eaten commonly by alliga­tors." We also recovered palm (Arecaceae) phy­toliths from artifact residues, potentially derived from food species such as cohune (Attalea co­hune) or coyol (Acrocomia sp.). 
Recovered residues of herbaceous plants such as tree cucumber (Parmentiera) and several unidentified species may also index the con­sumption of edible fruits or seeds. However, as with many such species, even where identification is possible and additional economic information is available, it is likely that many of the residues are the result of opportunistic ruderals growing in areas disturbed by human activity. 
Several species highly anticipated in foodways paradigms of Southeastern Mesoamerica did not appear in our Los Naranjos samples. Cucurbita (squash) species represent the most prominent absence. The primary economic use of species in this genus is the consumption of the edible flesh and seeds of the squash fruits. However, we re­covered no squash remains in phytolith or mac­robotanical form. The lack of evidence for squash in the Formative period at Los Naranjos compli­cates traditional views of widespread high ubiq­uity of squash for thousands of years. At other sites studied in the region, squashes were recov­ered only as rind phytoliths in sediment samples, not as macrobotanical remains (Morell-Hart 2011). It may simply be that, due to processing regimens and natural formation processes, mi-

crobotanical sediment samples provide a better in­dex of the Cucurbita genus in this region. 
Plants with Known Medicinal Uses 
A single tobacco (Nicotiana sp.) seed was repre­sented in the samples (Figure 2). This seed was re­covered from a matrix located between well-de­fined deposits, and likely represents accidental incorporation, perhaps through curing practices, as the seeds are not known to have economic uses. As historically recorded, however, the leaves were smoked, rubbed on clothing to ward off snakes, and mixed with water to treat ticks and colmoyote worm (Atran 1993; Heiser 1992; Roys 1965). In the early colonial Yucatec Maya text Rit­
ual of the Bacabs, tobacco is recorded as medicine for asthma, bites, stings, bowel complaints, chills, fever, seizures, sore eyes, skin diseases, and uri­nary complaints. It is also invoked in incanta­tions dealing with "skin eruptions, fever, snake in the abdomen, a worm in the tooth, and the pla­centa" (Roys 1965). A popular domesticated species from very ancient times through the mod­ern day, tobacco is cultivated in a variety of lo­cations (Goodspeed 1954; Pickersgill 1977). 
Several other plants may have had medicinal uses, including grass (Poaceae) and sunflower family (Asteraceae) species. Representatives of both of these families emerged from the macro b­otanical and microbotanical samples. Some herba-

ceous plants (Lepidium, Oxalis, Verbena), recov­ered as seeds, may also have had medicinal or condiment uses as is recorded for these taxa else­where (Lentz 1986; Lentz et al. 1998; Zamora­Martfnez and Pola 1992). The ascribed potential medicinal uses of these plants at Los Naranjos, however, are tentative in nature. 
Plants with Other Known Uses 
We recovered many grass (Poaceae) and sun­flower family (Asteraceae) species from the mac­robotanical and microbotanical samples, rein­forcing understandings of the general ubiquity of these plants, as identified in pollen from sedi­ments in Lake Yojoa (Rue 1989). Members of the grass family include multiple species potentially used in thatching, bedding, tinder, and for medi­cinal purposes. Moreover, many of these species may have become incorporated into the archaeo­logical record as components (intentional or oth­erwise) of clays and sediments used as daub and flooring materials. Grasses grow wild everywhere throughout this region and may have sprung up in nooks throughout the site. Grass seeds can also find their way naturally into the archaeological record, as travelers clinging to clothing and feet, or due to the activities of rodents. 
Sunflower family (Asteraceae) species were recovered both as microremains and macrore­mains. Similar to grass species, some may have been used for medicinal purposes, and others as foodstuffs. But overall, as with grasses, these species grow wild quite easily in various places and have the tendency to spread quickly throughout ar­eas, growing without the intervention of people. 
Bromeliaceae phytoliths, recovered three times in the course of residue analysis, may correspond with the use of these plants as ornamentals and foodstuffs, although Tillandsia species within this family are recorded ethnographically as being used by Lenca peoples in ritual practice (Meluzfn 1997). 
A large number of taxa had, expectedly, very low recovery rates, including those of Lepidium, Oenothera, Oxalis, Parmentiera aculeata, Sisy­rinchium, Verbena, and Veronica. Perhaps, like the lone indigo plant (Indigofera sp.) recovered, some of these were used for dyeing purposes. Some may have had edible fruits or seeds that were occasionally consumed, such as the tree cu­cumber (Parmentiera). Like many other herba­ceous plants, some of them may have had medi­cinal or condiment uses as recorded for these taxa elsewhere (noted above). Some may have been used as ornamentals or home garden privacy screens (Oenothera). Some may have had a role in thatching or matting. Many, however, were probably opportunistic plants growing in dis­turbed areas, whose residues became naturally incorporated into the recovered archaeobotani­cal assemblage. 
Plant Residues Recovered from Artifacts 
We recovered residues of various plant species from obsidian artifacts, either in adhering sedi­ments or sonicated from fissures and pores in the artifact surfaces (Figures 3 and 4). Relative abun­dances of taxa were quite variable from artifact to artifact. Woody species dominated most assem­blages, and Panicoid grasses and palm species were also frequently represented, though much less abundant overall than the woody phytoliths. Palm (Arecaceae) phytoliths ranged between 5 and 30 percent of each array. Panicoid grasses of­ten factored into the assemblages, but never topped more than 3 percent of the assemblage. Relative abundances of all other taxa generally ran between 1 and 5 percent. 
Unknown woody species phytoliths were re­covered from every artifact at Los Naranjos but one of the obsidian blades. These non-diagnostic ar­boreal spheres likely index a variety of taxa. How­ever, like the grass species, the ubiquity of wood across artifact types is unsurprising, given the enor­mous number of practices associated with woody taxa and their wide incorporation into daily life as fuel, implements, and construction materials. 
On three of four obsidian blades, there ap­pears to be a much higher relative abundance of maize (I 2 to 33 percent) and much less wood than in the aggregate of artifacts and plant residues. By comparison, one of the blades had unknown fibers and a high quantity of wood, in addition to un­known starches, but no evidence of maize. This blade may represent an exclusive industrial or workbench "wood and fiber" tool. Another blade had only maize, vascular tissue, and unknown storage tissue, with no wood phytoliths present. This blade may represent an exclusive "food"

tool. Other blades had a higher diversity of taxa (up to five distinct species) and thus were likely more multipurpose. 
The species associated with each artifact refer­ence a myriad of potential activities, from cutting wood with tools to scouring implements with dried maize cobs. We see some discrete uses of obsid­ian blades, perhaps reserved for particular activi­ties, although food species are represented across most obsidian artifacts. Whatever the particular uses of each artifact, the species collectively re­covered from artifacts represent interactions with both domesticated and wild-growing plants. 
Discussion 
Pollen core data from Lake Yojoa would lead us to expect that by 1000 B.C., maize agriculture, and the accompanying cultivation of beans and squash, would have been well established. This temporal depth of expected agricultural activity does not seem to be indicated by the profile of plants we identified at Los Naranjos: squashes are entirely absent, beans are exceptionally rare , and even maize is present in relatively few samples. What these samples suggest instead is that resi­dents of Los Naranjos between 1000 B.C. and 700 
B.C. (the estimated date for construction of the first version of Structure IV) exploited a wide range of plants for subsistence, including both seed and root crops. They likely also made use of products from managed forests and fallowed mil­pas. Such activities are suggested by scholars working in the nearby Copan area (McNeil 2010) and Belize (Ford 2008), who have linked forest management and milpa fallowing to increases in arboreal and grass pollens. 
Many of the plants recovered at Los Naranjos probably served non-culinary purposes. Tobacco is a notable example, known to have been used for medicinal and ritual purposes in later Mesoamer­ica. Other medicinals are likely included in the va­riety of plants we identified at the site. A large part of the plant assemblage may represent non-co­mestible uses of plants: indigo and other plants used in dyes, palms for fiber and thatching, and wood worked into artifacts that are not them­selves preserved archaeologically. 
From a methodological perspective, the pro­ductivity of analysis of even a small number of obsidian artifacts is notable. The plant remains we recovered from these objects, especially those re­moved through sonication, provide a different kind of evidence for understanding plant use. Whereas flotation samples may only indirectly re­flect human actions, as is true also of the pollen core recovered from Lake Yojoa, the obsidian ar­tifacts were primary tools used to process plants. It is noteworthy that one of the tools seems to have been used exclusively for non-culinary ac­tivities, while another may have been reserved ex­clusively for foodstuffs. All other tools analyzed show evidence of multipurpose use. 
All the evidence for use of root crops at Los Naranjos originates in the analyses of tools used to process these tubers, whether found in the adher­ing sediments (less securely associated with artifact use) or sonicated material (more securely associ­ated with artifact use). While maize was present in other samples, the most abundant evidence for this cultigen comes from artifact residues, as does the only detected evidence of beans. Without microb­otanical analysis, the significant use of palms would have been underrepresented, and the use of bromeliads (important in traditional Honduran rit­uals) would have been undetected. 
The combination of methods thus provides a richer, more complex picture of human use of plants than any one method alone. We recom­mended that future researchers interested in hu­man-plant relationships pursue such multi-proxy analysis, from pre-excavation research design through post-excavation subsampling strategy. Complementary methods increase the visibility of taxa difficult or impossible to recover macrobot­anically (e.g., leren and sweet potato) or microb­otanically (e.g., amaranth and tobacco). Gathering sufficiently large sediment samples for flotation is critical to this endeavor. In semi-tropical areas of Southeastern Mesoamerica, even larger volumes than those analyzed here -a minimum of 10 liters-are recommended. We would also en­courage the analysis of heavy fraction samples when available, as this analysis has proven fruit­ful elsewhere in Mesoamerica (e.g., VanDer­warker and Kruger 20 12). Moreover, collecting small (200 g) sediment samples for microbotan­ical residues enables complementary analyses of activity loci. Maintaining at least a subset of un­washed artifacts is critical , including at least sev-

era! specimens of chipped stone, ground stone, and ceramics. Such research activities are neces­sary to obtain a more holistic view of economic plant practices and have already had enormous success across a wide variety of environments and time periods (e.g., Dickau 2010; Hamilakis 1996; Mercader et al. 2003; Zutter 1999). 
At the microscale, our study provides a window into daily life of the builders of monumental ar­chitecture at Los Naranjos. They enjoyed access to a wide range of plants, both for food and other pur­poses. Comparison with three neighboring sites suggests that the residents of early Los Naranjos may have enjoyed one of the richest plant assem­blages in the region (Morell-Hart 20 11). Such contrasts should not be viewed solely in terms of per-sample taxa richness and ecological con­straints. Each site studied has unique features, suggesting that when we examine human use of plants at the level of individual practice and inter­generational change, what we will see is much greater complexity than what traditional models suggest. We are also likely to encounter even more unexpected patterns than those already established through previous work demonstrating that culti­vation of maize did not go hand-in-hand with early sedentism and social complexity in Hon­duras (e.g., Herrmann et al. 2002). While social complexity and diversity increase the challenge of generalizing about early human uses of plants, the approach we have elaborated here provides a good snapshot of such activities, identifying places where culturally significant plants first gained an advantage and recognizing the cultural practices that allowed it to happen. Such efforts enrich our understandings of the mosaic of practices linked to domestication in Mesoamerica, as well as other practices that engaged all manner of landscapes from the "wild" to the "domesticated."
