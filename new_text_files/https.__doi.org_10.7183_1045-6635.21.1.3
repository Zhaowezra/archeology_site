
A MI TO-STYLE STRUCTURE AT CH AVIN DE HUANTAR: 
DATING AND IMPLICATIONS 

Daniel A. Contreras 
Excavations west of the monumental core at Chavfn de Huantar, Peru in 2005 revealed a well-preserved plastered struc­ture with a central circular hearth, in the style of the Mito Architectural Tradition. This find challenges standard definitions of both the Mito Tradition and Chavfn itself I discuss the material remains and associated radiocarbon dates from this fea­ture, and use these new data to re-assess Chavfn 's involvement in interregional networks and its relationship to earlier cer­emonial centers in the Central Andean highlands.

Background 
Set in a high valley on the eastern slope of the Cen­tral Andes' Cordillera Blanca (see Figure 1), the site of Chavin de Huantar is a sprawling complex of monumental stone construction, unique in the region in its scale and sophistication. Archaeolog­ical investigation of the site began in earnest with Julio C. Tello's visit in 1919 (Tello 1943, 1960), continued when Wendell Bennett carried out the first scientific excavations at Chavfn in 1939 (Ben­nett 1944), and has burgeoned in the near-century since. Two projects are particularly salient. Exca­vations directed by Luis Lumbreras and Heman Amat (1966-1974) revealed previously unknown architectural elements, most spectacularly the Cir­cular Plaza and the Ofrendas Gallery, and began the process of establishing a radiocarbon and ceramic chronology for the site (Lumbreras I 977, 1993, 2007). Burger's subsequent 1975-76 exca­vations focused on the buried domestic remains surrounding the monumental core of the site, and particularly on stratigraphically excavated ceram­ics (Burger 1984, 1998).

While this work-and the ongoing Stanford University Chavfn de Huantar Research and Con­servation Project (Rick 2005; Rick et al. 1998)­has much improved our understanding of Chavfn, the site is large and complex enough that many questions remain. Moreover, as new data have come to light researchers have consistently revisited the fundamental archaeological questions at Chavfn: understanding the sociopolitical dynamics that made the site's construction possible and assess­ing its place-chronologically and in systemic terms-in the larger panorama of Central Andean prehistory. These various projects have led to sig­nificant disagreement about Chavfn's chronology (Burger 1998, 2008; Kembel 2008; Kembel and Rick 2004; Lumbreras 2007; Rick 2005, 2008); I consider below the ways in which the data pre­sented here articulate with this debate. These debates at Chavfn are embedded within pan­Andean problems of chronological terminology (Kaulicke 1998; Silverman 2004). For the sake of ease of comparison with the published syntheses

on the Kotosh Religious Tradition and the Mito Tra­dition, as well as the original excavations at the most prominent sites considered, I here employ Rowe's (1967) chronological terminology. This is a prac­tical measure only; addressing the problems of chronological terminology in the Central Andes is beyond the scope of this paper. 
My 2005 excavations, carried out as part of the Stanford Project, focused on the periphery of the site's monumental core (see Figures 2 and 3; also Contreras 2007). These resulted in the discovery, in the area known as the West Field, of a structure that closely matches the architectural forms described by Burger and Salazar-Burger (1980) and Bonnier (1997) as diagnostic of the Kotosh Religious Tradition and the Mito Tradition, respec­tively. 
Excavation of the Mito-style Structure 
Excavated features of the structure include several salient elements (see Figure 4): entry and exterior step (Element 1 ), floor (pericaust) (2), lateral bench (epicaust) (3), central circular hearth (4), and par­tial fa\:ade (5). These elements combine to form a small rectilinear structure, accessed from the north by ascending at least one step to enter, whose focus was a small perfectly circular hearth 39 cm in diam­eter and 11 cm deep in the center. 
While the circular hearth does not have any ventilation duct, as prominently featured in the well-known examples from Kotosh, the face of the bench, immediately east of the hearth, is pene­trated by a 29 cm wide by 12 cm high duct (Fig­ure 4, Element 6). Carbon recovered from the inner reaches of that duct suggests that it may feed another hearth, but the limits of the excava­tion did not allow exploration of that possibility. It is noteworthy that analogously located features at Kotosh (see Figure 5) were reported as niches, not ducts, but were as much as 50 cm deep (Izumi and Terada 1972: 144-164 ). The prominent niches in both bench and wall at Kotosh and La Galgada thus apparently have no counterpart at Chavin, though further excavation may of course change that perception. 
If the hearth is taken to be truly central, the sunken area containing the hearth would have mea­sured approximately 2m by 2 m; such a recon­struction would indicate that we excavated approximately 50 percent of the central sunken area (what Bonnier terms the pericaust). Unfortu­nately, with only the northern extreme of the struc­ture properly defined, precisely estimating the size of the entire structure is impossible. However, if we posit relative symmetry around the hearth, a roughly 4 m x 4 m chamber is reasonable (see Fig­ure 5). 
The upper portion of the northern fa\:ade, pre­sent on the east side of the entry, is damaged, but what remains suggests a faade at least 7 5 cm high. The wall may have been higher, or supported a less permanent superstructure, but no evidence of either was found. It is also possible that the structure was unroofed, but the vulnerability of exposed plaster during the pronounced rainy season in the region suggests that a roof would have been necessary (unless the structure had a use life of only one dry season before being sealed; given the scale of investment in the construction of the structure, this seems unlikely). 
The only exception to the spare, undecorated appearance of the chamber was the remnant of a sculptural pillar affixed to the northern fai;ade, flanking the entry to the east (Figure 4, Element 7). Although more than half of the pillar was destroyed prior to the sealing of the chamber, what remained was sufficient to indicate an irregular cylinder, embedded in the chamber floor and extending at least as high as the preserved portion of faade. The remnant portion was sufficient to suggest a form that bowed outward just above the base before

tapering to a neck -45 cm above the floor; above 
the neck the pillar flared out to form an irregular 
form too damaged to reconstruct. 1 The emphasis 
on entryways that Bonnier ( 1997) ascribes to the 
Mito architectural form is germane here; also of 
interest is the step entry, which argues that the struc­
ture was raised relative to its surroundings. Inves­
tigations of the exposure provided by the cut of the 
Rio Wacheqsa, approximately 5 m to the north, 
suggest that contemporary ground surface was at 
most 1.5 m lower, and an associated floor proba­
bly sat only 70 cm below the level of the structure ; (see Figure 6). 
The construction technique of the structure 
appears to be uniform; where damage to the plas­
ter has exposed substructure, selected angular rock 
had been placed in a mud mortar, to which plaster 
had been applied and carefully smoothed (Figure 
4, Element 8). The only exception, apparently, was 
the remnant of the sculptural pillar affixed to the 
faade, flanking the entry, which had no stone sub­
structure and consisted entirely of a prepared mud 
covered with plaster. Overall, the plaster was 
remarkably well preserved, but no evidence of painted or molded decoration was found. The orig­inal color of the plaster was also difficult to dis­cern, as it appears to have been affected by the grey-green soil of the sealing fill. White or yellow­white are the most likely candidates; the only color variation observed was in and around the hearth, where the plaster was heat-altered to a brick-red. The light color of the plaster distinguished it from the darker clay matrix of the substructure, but that light color seems to have been a characteristic of the plaster itself rather than of any applied slip (unlike La Galgada and Kotosh-see Bonnier 
1997:137). 
Cultural material was recovered from only two areas: the circular hearth and the inner reaches of the duct. In both contexts the materials appeared to be primary depositions, while the remainder of the excavated area gave every indication of having been carefully cleaned before its interment, or per­haps kept clean during its use life (see discussion of depositional context below). 
The inner reaches of the duct ( 40-50 cm from its opening in the face of the lateral bench) con­tained abundant carbon, as well as a fragment of

an anthracite mirror and a solitary ceramic sherd (unfortunately, like the two other sherds recovered from the hearth, a small-approximately 2 x 2 cm -nondiagnostic plainware body sherd). 
The circular hearth was filled with in situ car­bon and ash deposits without internal stratification. The deposit also included two small, nondiagnos­tic ceramic sherds, bone remnants too heat­damaged to be much more than powder, and a quantity of fragmentary obsidian (a mixture of small waste flakes and shatter; 129 fragments total­ing 22 g). Analysis of macrobotanical and phy­tolith remains from the hearth deposit is ongoing. Two fragments of wood charcoal (samples AA 69446 and AA 69447) from this hearth deposit yielded radiocarbon dates that when calibrated fall roughly between -850-750 B.C. (the 2-sigma ranges are 841-540 B.C. and 911-772 BC); see Figure 7).2 
Four carbon samples have thus far been dated by the University of Arizona AMS Laboratory, after pretreatment by Dr. Herbert Haas at RC Consul­tants. All samples were charcoal, from well­documented and well-sealed contexts; two from the contents of the hearth and two from distinct strata in the overlying deposits. The results are both internally regular and consistent with the strati­graphic relationships observed during excavation (see Figure 7). While the dates from the upper strata encompass a broad range (800-400 cal B.C.) due to the flatness of the relevant portion of the cali-bration curve (Bronk Ramsey 2001, 2006; McCor­mac et al. 2004), the samples from the hearth itself combine for a tighter range, centered on 800 cal 

B.C. The hearth dates, moreover, seem from their context to mark the terminus of occupation, sug­gesting that the structure itself dates back some­what further. Moreover, it bears repeating that the WF-07 Mito-style structure is not a basal deposit­architectural evidence from the cut of the Rfo Wacheqsa to the north demonstrates the presence of earlier construction stratigraphically prior to the structure (see Figure 6). Further, the Kotosh exam­ple of multiple superposed and juxtaposed Mito structures suggests that this chamber may be part of a larger complex rather than a stand-alone struc­ture. Given the limited areal exposure thus far pos­sible at Chavin, assessment of this prospect unfortunately must remain speculative. 
Context and Process 
The 2005 excavation that exposed the northeastern quadrant of the plastered chamber described above was located approximately 300m west of the mon­umental core. As the investigators did not antici­pate the exposure of such a structure, time and funding did not allow a broad areal excavation. Nevertheless, the portion excavated has important implications for the early development of the cer­emonial center of Chavin de Huantar and its rela­tionship to other early highland centers. I here

describe the location of this Mito-style structure within the site and its stratigraphic context and bur­ial processes, before turning to those implications. The area west of the monumental core of Chavin-here referred to as the West Field-has ,been recognized since at least Julio C. Tello's vis­:its to the site (beginning 1919) as containing Chavfn-era construction. Two megalithic walls (apparently terrace facades), constructed of quartzite blocks in a style similar to that of the structures in the monumental core, are visible on the surface, as is one canal draining northward into the Rfo Wacheqsa (see Figure 3). Until the con­struction of the road that currently separates the monumental core from the West Field in the 1970s, these east-west terraces were also associated with a north-south wall that was largely destroyed by the 
road construction, suggesting a structure or struc­tures in the West Field rather than simple mega­lithic terraces; this leads Diessl to describe a "West Temple" (Diessl 2004:510-516). The apparently substantial Chavin-period architecture in this sec­tor has mostly been buried by a combination of slope processes, subsequent occupation, and a major aluvi6n (debris flow) in 1945 (Diessl 2004; Indacochea G. and lberico M. 1947; Turner et al. 1999).3 
The combination of slope erosion and this mod­em mining of the aluvion deposit meant that our excavation rapidly exposed archaeological strata in spite of the substantial post-occupation deposition. The shallow overburden covered a series of loose fills of small angular rock, alternating with thin lenses of clayey soil indicating periods of rapid, apparently intentional deposition of fill alternating with brief periods of exposure and natural deposi­tion from slope erosion. These strata, judging by the small amounts of cultural material included, appear to represent a post-Chavin attempt to level the area, perhaps also with consideration for ade­quate drainage. If there was a northern retaining wall, it was either dismantled over the years or did not survive the southward cutting of the river. To the east the later fills, at least, were contained by a roughly constructed wall of alternating small boul­ders and stacks of chinking cobbles. This wall (Ele­ment 1 in Figure 8) was both different in style than the Chavfn-period walls excavated below (Ele­ments 2 and 3 in Figure 8) and in a different archi­tectural orientation. 
Below the series of loose rock fills two terraces were excavated. Both were well-built, consisting of selected angular stones set in clay mortar to cre­ate walls with flat faces. Some suggestion of plas­tering remained on the upper terrace, in the form of a very fine, homogenous, and distinctly colored sediment associated with some parts of the wall base. The terraces are parallel, running roughly east-west (and architectural east-west, in the archi­tectural alignment of the monument). Between the lower terrace and the upper-an area approxi­mately 2 m wide-a fill of angular rock had been carefully laid, the large rocks making up the fill chinked with smaller stones at the surface to cre­ate a flat substrate for the packed-earth floor that spanned the area between the two terraces. Both terraces extended into the excavation's western pro-

file; to the east, as far as the presence of the large, late retaining wall above allowed excavation, the lower terrace continued into the eastern profile while the upper was destroyed (see Figure 8). 
In association with the base of the lower terrace were a series of compact, material-culture-rich deposits, including some fragmentary packed-earth surfaces. The ceramics recovered from these deposits and from the two surfaces above (that between the two terraces and that atop the upper terrace) were consistently and exclusively Janabarriu-style (see Figure 9 for a sample of the associated decorated ceramics). Two charcoal sam­ples recovered from these deposits yielded radio­carbon dates that when calibrated fall between -800 and 400 B. C. (2-sigma ranges of 7 61--407 B. C. and 796--417 BC; see Figure 7). 4 
These lowermost, compact deposits were directly atop the sterile fi11 that sealed the plastered structure, with no natural deposits intervening to suggest any period of disuse or abandonment between the deposition of the fill that seals the Mi to-style structure and the construction of the ter­races (see Figure 10).5 The temporal proximity of these deposits to the sealed structure below is con­firmed by the radiocarbon dates. 
The structure itself, described above, was only partially exposed. Even such a limited exposure, however, revealed a plastered chamber consisting of an entry, split-level floor, and circular central hearth, with an associated duct and remnant pillar. 
At the end of its use-life, that structure, largely intact and clean, was sealed by a massive deposi­tion of completely sterile fill. As much as 90 cm thick, with a uniformly level upper surface (thick­ness thus depending on the depth below surface of structural features), the fill consisted of a fine grey­green soil matrix with abundant but neither aligned nor sorted clasts of angular rock, ranging from small rocks (-3 cm on long axis) to boulders (as much as 50 cm on long axis). There was a notice­able trend toward larger inclusions in the fill to the north, perhaps reflecting some care in placement of fill within the chamber as opposed to outside it (the excavation straddled the apparent northern fa<;ade of the structure). No cultural material what­soever was recovered from the approximately 3.6 m3 of fill excavated, and no internal distinctions within the fill were detected, suggesting intentional and careful preparation as well as deposition in a single fill event. 
The basal portion of the sealing fill was free of the large angular rocks found throughout the rest of the fill, ensuring that in deposition no damage was done to the plastered surfaces, and the surfaces themselves were swept clean. This suggests a con­certed effort to preserve the structure intact when it was buried. The only cultural material and/or debris recovered in excavation was from the hearth and from deep in the duct. While the hearth was apparently left undisturbed, and simply covered, the duct was carefully packed with the sealing fill to a depth of -50 cm-approximately an arm's reach. The cultural material recovered from the duct was

not mixed in that fill, but deposited deeper in the duct; it remains unclear whether that material had also been pushed into the duct or if instead it had entered through another, yet-unexcavated, open­ing at the duct's eastern terminus. 
This intentional, prepared filling of the structure, although it was not followed by construction of a new temple atop the old, recalls the "temple entombment" described by Matsuzawa at Kotosh, where superposition of Mito structures was the norm (Izumi and Terada 1972: 176; see also Onuki 1993, 1999). Burger and Salazar-Burger (Burger and Salazar-Burger 1985: 116) also describe simi­lar deposits at Huaricoto. 

Spatial and Temporal Location of the Mita-style Structure within Chav{n de Huantar

the construction of the monumental core of Chavfn as occurring between approximately 1000-600 B.C. (Kembel and Rick 2004; Rick 2005) brack­ets the dates from the Mito-style structure. While Kembel and Rick remain cautious about the absolute dating of the specific architectural phases within their well-anchored relative sequence, the Mito-style structure apparently falls clearly within the Black and White Stage (see Kembel 2001 :312). The clear stratigraphic precedence of the structure in relation to Janabarriu-style ceramics in the upper layers also indicates contemporaneity-or even temporal priority-for the Mito-style structure with regard to the latter ceramic phase at Chavfn de Huantar. The upper layers-those containing such Janabarriu-style ceramics-yielded two floor­associated radiocarbon dates, both falling within 820-410 cal B.C. (with an overwhelming proba­bility of pre-490 cal B.C.; see Figure 7). In terms of absolute dates, thus, these strata also fall within Kembel's Black and White Phase and Burger's Urabarriu Phase (Burger 1992:231; Kembel 
2001 :312), while the associated ceramics are dis­tinctively Janabarriu-style (Janabarriu is the last of Burger's three ceramic phases, dating 390-200 
B.C. [Burger 1984]). 
The stratigraphic evidence also allows more subtle inferences. The careful cleaning (or mainte-

nance) of the structure floor prior to the deposition of the sealing fill, coupled with the apparently rel­atively undisturbed ash and carbon deposits left in the hearth, suggests no interval of abandonment prior to the deliberate interment of the space. Fur­thermore, the occupation surfaces above that seal­ing fill sit directly atop it, without any deposits suggesting an interval of abandonment between the sealing of the structure and the subsequent occu­pation. The tight clustering of the radiocarbon dates from above and below the fill supports this inter­pretation. 
A final piece of architectural evidence is also suggestive: the orientation of the structure, judg­ing from the exposed lateral bench and northern fac;ade, is close (-21.3' east of north) to the 13.65' east of north which serves as architectural north in the monumental phases (Rick et al. 1998: l 94). It is also noteworthy that the structure opens north, as did the oldest portion (now the northeast comer of Structure A) of the stone architecture in the site core (Rick et al. 1998:194); subsequent construc­tion phases shifted the site orientation 90' to the east. 
Also of interest is the structure's location rela­tive to both the monumental core and the sur­rounding landscape. Situated approximately 270 m west of the Lanz6n, the structure appears, given the modem layout of the site, to be somewhat marginal and isolated. If the Mito-style structure is taken to have significant ceremonial importance given the centrality of such architecture at other sites, the significant construction investment it represents, and its careful interment, this might imply a dif­fuse rather than concentric model of spatial sig­nificance within the site.6 That is, archaeologists have tacitly assumed that the Lanz6n, the Circular Plaza, or the Portada-all architectural elements within the monumental core-represent the site's conceptual focus. The discovery of such an appar­ently noteworthy element as a Mito structure well outside the monumental core implies, though, that there may be multiple foci within the site. 
However, another possibility must also be con­sidered: given the density and scale of construction features in the West Field, it may be necessary to reconceptualize the monumental core itself, includ­ing the largely buried West Field constructions as part of the site center. Such a model would leave the Mi to-style structure still peripheral, but not nec­essarily marginal: its location at the westernmost extreme of the site, adjacent to the Rio Wacheqsa, places it on the most direct route to the Cordillera Blanca, the Callej6n de Huaylas, and the coast to the west. This places it astride the prime pathway into the monument, and also puts it in a position from which it directly addresses the not-too-distant apus (see Reinhard 1985) and faces both the allure

The water of the Wacheqsa River is today (and was perhaps in pre­history) used to irrigate the agricultural basin of the Mosna Valley, and was also apparently a key ele­ment of ritual practice in Chavfn 's ceremonial core (see Burger 1992:141-143; Contreras and Keefer 2009; Lumbreras et al. 1976). 
Andean Context 
The Japanese Mission's excavations at Kotosh found a series of quadrangular plastered structures with split-level floors, niches, and central hearths (Izumi and Terada 1972). The multiple structures were in some cases contemporary and in others superposed; in the latter case earlier structures had been carefully and deliberately interred. Subse-

quent excavations at La Galgada by Alberto Bueno Mendoza and Terence Grieder (Bueno Mendoza 2004; Bueno Mendoza and Grieder 1980; Grieder and Bueno Mendoza 1981, 1985; Grieder et al. 1988) and Huaricoto by Richard Burger and Lucy Salazar-Burger (Burger and Salazar-Burger 1980, 1985) revealed examples of similar structures widely removed from Kotosh (see Figure 11). 
The construction and use at these sites of enclosed structures with central hearths and other potentially diagnostic architectural features has been the subject of definitional debate, as the Kotosh Religious Tradition proposed by Burger and Salazar-Burger (1980) has been the subject of both revision (Bonnier 1997) and rejection (Siveroni 2006). The excavation of the structure described above, as a result, necessitates engage­ment with two overlapping definitions of ritual practice(s) and associated architecture that date to the Late Preceramic, as early as 2500 B.C. These are the Kotosh Religious Tradition proposed by Burger and Salazar-Burger (Burger and Salazar­Burger 1980, 1985, 1986) and the Mito Tradition suggested by Bonnier ( 1987) and Fung (1988) and elaborated by Bonnier (Bonnier 1987, 1988, 1997, 2007; Bonnier and Rozenberg 1988). 
The Kotosh Religious Tradition was defined as a ritual practice focused on the burning of offer­ings in a central hearth (Burger and Salazar-Burger 1980), observed from the Late Preceramic (most notably at Kotosh, Shillacoto, Huacaloma, La Gal­gada, and Huaricoto) through the Early Horizon (at Huaricoto). Such practice, Burger and Salazar­Burger argued, was the reflection of religious beliefs that were fundamental enough to prehistoric Andean peoples that they crosscut differences in political, economic, and social organization, find­ing expression in communities with distinct forms of sociopolitical organization. That very diversity of expression, Burger and Salazar-Burger later pro­posed, could be read as a reflection of the varying forms of sociopolitical organization of the com­munities in question (specifically Kotosh, Shilla­coto, and Huaricoto, in their 1986 study). 
With reference to some of the same sites, Bon­nier, following her work at Piruru, distinguished between the Kotosh Religious Tradition and what she termed the Mito Tradition, defined as a cere­monial tradition involving a particular architectural form into which the sacred hearth is incorporated (Bonnier 1997). Similarly, Fung, noting common­alities in the ritual architecture of Kotosh (and the associated sites of Shillacoto and Wairajirca, also in the Huallaga drainage) and La Galgada, argued that these were representative of a highland tradi­tion of the later Preceramic Period, which she termed the Mito Tradition (Fung Pineda 1988:73). While Fung's discussion remained general, Bon­nier focused on the construction of a split-level floor with associated hearth, considering both ele­ments, rather than just the hearth, to be critical, and arguing that the Kotosh Religious Tradition was too broadly defined to be useful (Bonnier 1987:358; 1997: 122).7 She identified several key definitional elements: quadrangular chamber, central hearth, split-level floor, niches, and use of plaster (Bon­nier 1997:137; see Figure 4), arguing that, 
Los templos que se edifican durante esta segunda mitad del tercer milenio [B.C.] responden a canones formales bien definidos que permiten identificar una tradici6n de arqui­tectura liturgica ... Esta corriente arquitect6nica y religiosa, la llamamos 'Tradici6n Mito' en referencia al sitio de Kotosh, fase ep6nima de Mito, donde se descubrieron sus huellas por primera vez [Bonnier 1988:40].8 
Using this definition, Bonnier then chronologically delimited the Mito Tradition as exclusive to the Late Preceramic. 
The implications of the two definitions are dis­tinct. Where Burger and Salazar-Burger envision a cultural substratum of ritual tradition whose mate­rial form varies depending on sociopolitical cir­cumstance, Bonnier does not make explicit claims of the Mito Tradition reflecting particularities of sociopolitical structure.9 Instead, focusing her def­inition more narrowly, she prefers to use the Mito Tradition as a tool for examining cultural interac­tion. The recurrence of the architectural forms of the Mito Tradition, in other words, evidences not the scattered florescence of local variations on a common, generalized Andean religious heritage but rather distinct instances of a specific and elab­orate ritual practice whose presence is suggestive of cultural interaction between the sites in question. The limited chronological range defined by the rel­evant sites reinforced this coherence; Bonnier describes the Mito Tradition as encompassing the period 2500-1800 B.C. (1997:122). In contrast,

the Kotosh Religious Tradition, appropriately for its broader definition, spans the period from the Late Preceramic into the Early Horizon, approxi­mately 2500-200 B.C. (Burger and Salazar-Burger 1980). 
That the Mito Tradition might be a particular instance of the generalized ritual tradition of burn­ing offerings in a central hearth-that is, the Kotosh Religious Tradition as defined by Burger and Salazar-Burger-is not specifically addressed but seems implicit in the definition. Moore has recently suggested as much, writing, "the concepts [of the Kotosh Religious Tradition and the Mito Tradition] cover distinct but overlapping observations" (Moore 2005: 108). As the structure excavated at Chavfn fits the definition of the Mito Tradition, I employ that term here. However, it should be under­stood that this Chavfn example also falls within the more broadly defined Kotosh Religious Tradition. 
Structures identified as belonging to the Mito Tradition have previously been described at six sites in the Central Andes (Bonnier 1997: 122) (see Figure 11). Bonnier's criteria were based primar­ily on analysis of her own work at the site of Piruru, in the Upper Marafi6n, and the well-published examples from Kotosh; she makes reference also to the published examples from Shillacoto, Waira­jirca, La Galgada and Huaricoto (Bonnier 1987, 
1997). While Bonnier restricts her discussion to highland sites, coastal examples of related archi­tecture have also been published, including most saliently those in the Casma Valley, at Caral in the Supe Valley, and at El Silencio in the Santa Valley. Pozorski and Pozorski describe a number of "ven­tilated hearth structures" in the Late Preceramic and Initial Period sites of the Casma Valley (at Huay­nuna, Bahia Seca, Pampa de las Llamas -Moxeke, and Taukachi-Konkan (Pozorski and Pozorski 
_ l996), and mention also a similar structure exca­vated by Tellenbach at Montegrande in the Jequete­peque Valley (Tellenbach 1986). 10 While these appear to be examples of the Kotosh Religious Tra­dition but not the Mi to Tradition, the two structures described at Caral (Shady and Machacuay 2003; Shady et al. 2003) conform much more closely to the otherwise highland Mito Tradition model, as do the structures at El Silencio (Montoya Vera 2007). Certainly the small sample of excavated Late Preceramic/lnitial Period ceremonial centers makes any definitive statement about the regional patterning of Mito Tradition structures impossible. However, if anything, sampling has been more thor­ough on the coast, where sites of the period are more accessible and less apt to be buried. The associa­tion of the Mi to Tradition with the highlands, thus, should be seen as provisional but reasonably robust. 
Implications 
All of the elements that Bonnier defines as integral to the Mito Tradition-with, arguably, the excep­tion of the niches-are present in the Chavfn exam­ple. Moreover, the WF-07 structure seems to be related most closely to those from Kotosh. Though it lacks the niches so characteristic there and the hearth does not feature a ventilation duct (however, such a duct is not among the architectural features that Bonnier identifies as key to the Mito Tradition), it is rectilinear rather than subrectangular, formally constructed, and was ceremonially interred (Bon­nier 1987:Fig.3). As such, it seems definitively to belong to the Mito Tradition, despite its anom­alously late date. Its presence also reinforces Burger and Salazar-Burger's (1980) contention that the Kotosh Religious Tradition persisted later than the Initial Period. Although the structure at Chavfn bears little direct resemblance to the late example they cite from Huaricoto, the two are generally comparable in date and both fit comfortably within the Kotosh Religious Tradition's broad definition. 
Two sorts of implications follow from this iden­tification of a Mito-style structure at Chavfn: those for Chavfn itself and those for the Mito Tradition in general. Beginning with the latter, the Mito-style structure at Chavfn should be treated with some caution; while the relatively late dates are con­vincing, it is also the case that they need not imply direct continuity with the Mito Tradition. How­ever, given the adherence of the WF-07 structure to the architectural canons of the Mito Tradition, and more specifically its resemblance to the Mito structures from the relatively nearby site of Kotosh, a tentative assertion of continuity is warranted. While archaism or revival are certainly possible, these are simply alternative models of the means of transmission of canons of ritual architecture, and do not obviate the need to explain the link. 
The interment of the known Mito structures at Kotosh by 1500 B. C. if not earlier makes the infer­ence of some other link-whether direct, allowing

continuity, or indirect, allowing later emulation­essential. The absence of explicit evidence of any such link-either at Kotosh, Chavfn, or elsewhere-in the corpus of archaeological data is by no means evidence of its absence; as Kaulicke (among others) has noted, our picture of the Cen­tral Andean highlands during this period of devel­oping sociopolitical complexity is underdetermined, reflecting a relatively sparse known record (Kaulicke 1998, 1999). Nevertheless, this is a substantial gap, to be either explained or filled with still-missing data. Given the inclusion of the WF-07 structure in the corpus of Mito struc­tures from the Central Andes, one of the key dic­tums about the Mito Tradition needs reexamining. Bonnier's assertion, based on the data then avail­able, was that, "It seems that the Mito tradition ends at the beginnings of the Initial Period" (Bon­nier 1997:143). The new data from Chavfn, how­ever, demonstrate its persistence all the way through the beginnings of the Early Horizon and its coex­istence with the new ritual forms then developing. This reinforces Burger and Salazar-Burger's obser­vations that despite its primary association with the Late Precerarnic, the Kotosh Religious Tradition­a broader set to which examples of the Mito Tra­dition must by definition also belong-persisted into the Early Horizon. They note, however, that, "outside of Huaricoto, traces of this tradition become more sketchy after the Late Preceramic period" (Burger and Salazar-Burger 1980:30). 
While these later examples of Kotosh Religious Tradition structures-i.e., those at Huaricoto--are closer to Chavfn spatially and temporally, they are similar to the structure described here only in the broadest terms (Burger and Salazar-Burger 1980:26). Many of the hearth structures at Huari­coto belong to the broader Kotosh Religious Tra­dition but lack the specific architectural features that would associate them with the Mito Tradition. Sim­ilarly, the potential Mito structure at Huacaloma (Terada and Onuki 1982:Color Plate 1) also appar­ently dates to the late Initial Period, but does not feature the specific structural features that Bonnier defines as integral to the Mito Tradition. Shillacoto, in the Huallaga Valley, is also dated to the second millennium B.C. (Izumi et al. 1972), if imprecisely. 
The cumulative effect of this array of examples is to reinforce the concepts of the Mito Tradition and the Kotosh Religious Tradition as nested-overlapping but not coterminous-definitions. If the Mito Tradition exists within the broader spatial and temporal aegis of the Kotosh Religious Tradi­tion, this begs the question of what is behind the empirical distinction based on diagnostic ritual architecture. I adopt the theoretical position that the specific architectural forms associated with the Mi to Tradition reflect a specific suite of associated ritual practices. As the Kotosh Religious Tradition is defined as a very generalized architectural form (the central hearth) associated with a broad "reli­gious ideology" (Burger and Salazar-Burger 1980:27), it is to be expected that it might be long­lasting and widespread. For the more narrowly defined practices of the Mito Tradition to be simi­larly persistent and widely distributed is more sur­prising. The link of the specifically defined ritual architecture associated with the Mito Tradition to a particular ritual practice thus ties their distribu­tion not simply to a common cultural background but to specific interconnections. This is not to sug­gest that the Mito Tradition is coterminous spatially and temporally with some particular cultural entity, but rather that the evidence of the Mito Tradition at various sites throughout the Central Andes has specific implications for early interregional inter­action in the region. The cultural mechanisms behind those apparent interactions certainly merit further investigation. 
One of the specific implications is the link men­tioned above between Chavfn and Kotosh. It bears re-emphasizing that we do not yet have any evi­dence that might determine whether this link is direct or indirect. However, this is not the first piece of evidence to link Chavfn to Kotosh. Previous examples have focused on both material culture (Izumi 1971; Kano 1979; Lumbreras 1989) and broad cultural patterns (e.g., Lumbreras 1989:22, 1993:353; Tello 1942:Lam.VII). More recently, Kembel has argued that the earliest ritual architec­ture in Chavfn 's ceremonial core was affiliated with the Kotosh Religious Tradition as manifest at Kotosh and La Galgada, concluding, "The archi­tecture at Chavfn does appear to incorporate this [rectangular stone chambers] and other features of Kotosh Religious Tradition, beginning in its earli­est phases" (Kembel 2001:227). She goes on to describe the later elaboration of the ceremonial complex at Chavfn, however, as a sequence "of transition as well as synthesis, beginning with local

forms based in the Kotosh-Mito traditions, and tran­sitioning to the incorporation of coastal forms that reach their most formal in the final monumental stage, while still incorporating aspects of the local forms" (Kembel 2001 :230; see also Kembel 2008). If the architecture of the ceremonial core began as something akin to the architecture of the Mito Tra­dition, in other words, by the time the complex was fully elaborated it had largely moved on-though not, the Mito structure described here suggests, abandoned those roots. This ties Chavfn more tightly to highland antecedents, 11 rendering unten­able Burger and Salazar-Burger's suggestion (rea­sonable though it was based on the data then available) that, "Chavfn de Huantar had very little in common with the ceremonial centers of the Kotosh Religious Tradition" (Burger and Salazar­Burger 1980:32). Burger has also suggested that contrast between Kotosh and Chavfn is an impor­tant feature of what marks the Early Horizon as dis­tinct from earlier Peruvian prehistory, writing that, 'The site of Chavin de Huantar ... represents a rup­ture with the highland Kotosh Religious Tradition" (Burger 1989:52; see also, however, Burger's note that Huaricoto, linked by its ceramic style to Early Horizon Chavfn, was participating in the KRT [Burger 1993:66]). 
Instead, the evidence presented here suggests that Chavfn, both in its origins and its florescence, seems to have maintained ties to Kotosh, or at least to the traditions for which that site serves as con­ceptual archetype. The presence of a Mito struc­ture contemporary with the monumental core thus substantially reinforces Lumbreras's argument for locating Chavfn's origins in Kotosh, encapsulated in his description of "una tradici6n [Kotosh-Mito] :iue no fue abandonada sino mas bien continuada por los constructores de Chavfn" (Lumbreras \993:354; see also Lumbreras 1989:88-90). 12 Assessment of the role and number of such struc­tures at Chavfn, and evaluation of the degree to which the Chavfn example follows the pattern of temple burial and reconstruction, await further excavation. 
While it remains true that the monumental core of Chavfn seems more linked to the coastal tradi­tions of mound-and-plaza construction that date pack as far as the Late Precerarnic than to such high­
and centers as Kotosh (Burger 1989; Williams 
1985, inter alia), these new data from the West Field suggest the possibility of a concurrent conti­nuity between Late Preceramic Kotosh and Early Horizon Chavfn, spanning approximately 1,000 years. Such long-term stability, interestingly enough, is precisely one of the characteristics Burger ascribes to the Initial Period on the coast (Burger 1992). The period is, however, sparsely documented in the Central Highlands, leaving the nature of the continuity between Kotosh and Chavfn specifically, and between the Mito Tradition and ritual practice at Chavfn generally, unclear. 
The presence of a functioning Mito structure in the early part of the first millennium B.C. also has implications for our understanding of ritual prac­tice and its sociopolitical underpinnings at Chavfn. This find cannot be understood in isolation from the rest of the site-indeed, the coexistence of the Mi to Tradition with the ceremonial practices of the site core is perhaps the most significant finding. This suggests not simply Mito Tradition roots for Chavfn (as argued by Kembel (2001:226--227)), but also Chavfn's adoption of the specific ritual architecture of the Mito Tradition. Such a syncretic approach is consistent with the models of Chavfn's function proposed by Lumbreras (e.g., 1989), Burger (e.g., 1992), and Rick (2005; see also Kem­bel and Rick 2004), though these diverge substan­tially in other particulars. 
Conclusions 
The excavations described here demonstrate the presence of a Mito-style structure at Chavfn, and the persistence of the Mito Tradition through approximately 800 cal. B.C. at the site. As such, they argue for an interaction-whose character remains to be defined-between Chavfn and the highland centers of the Late Preceramic generally, and perhaps the Huallaga Valley specifically. More­over, both the close association of this Mito-style structure with well-dated Janabarriu-style ceram­ics and the correlation of the radiocarbon dates from the structure itself with Kembel' s architectural chronology suggest the close affiliation of this rit­ual space with the plazas and galleries of the mon­umental core. 
The radiocarbon dates (Figure 7) from the hearth itself and from the overlying deposits associated with Janabarriu-style ceramics (Figure 9) reinforce the need to revisit Chavfn's chronology, though

they are not sufficient in themselves to construct a new temporal framework. While these data do not constitute an argument for Kembel and Rick's pro­posed revision in particular (Kembel 2001:Table 7.2; Rick 2005:73), they are compatible with it. Most importantly they do emphasize the need for reexamination of the conflicting chronologies pre­sented by Burger ( 1981, 1984 ), Lumbreras ( 1989), and Rick and Kembel (Kembel and Rick 2004), suggesting a significantly earlier appearance for Janabarriu-style ceramics than the 390 B.C. pro­posed by Burger. 
The relatively late (with respect to the Mito Tra­dition) dates and the close association of the Mito structure with Chavfn have broad implications for Central Andean prehistory. The longevity of the Mito Tradition, with the addition of this evidence, is extended by a millennium, to 2500-800 cal 
B.C.13 This chronological revision has theoretical as well as typological consequences. The persis­tence into the Early Horizon of a tradition that dates back into the Late Preceramic reinforces the char­acterization of the Initial Period as ideologically (and, by extension, politically) stable. At the same time, its longevity also demonstrates that the Mito Tradition was not replaced by the mound-and­sunken-plaza ritual tradition, but that the two were able to coexist. Burger and Salazar-Burger suggest that this coexistence occurred at an inter-site level (see Burger and Salazar-Burger 1980:32), and these new data demonstrate such compatibility at an intra-site level. Similar juxtaposition is also in evi­dence at Caral, where the massive Templo Mayor houses a small Mito structure (among other con­structions) on its summit (Shady and Machacuay 2003), perhaps suggesting that public, visible elite ritual activity took place within only a few meters of private and hidden activity. Pozorski and Pozorski also note the coexistence of divergent forms of ritual architecture at the coastal site of Huaynuna ( 1990), as does Montoya Vera (2007) at El Silencio. 
This compatibility suggests the possibility of simultaneous coexistence of long-term stability (represented by the persistence of the Mito Tradi­tion) and innovation and dynamism in ritual prac­tice (represented by the development of the monumental core of Chavin). Such coexistence supports both Rick's recently articulated model of Chavfn as an instance of created and manipulated tradition (see Rick 2005) and Burger's now tradi­tional model of Chavfn as a center of ideological synthesis (see Burger 1992:Ch.7), although Burger placed such activity several centuries later in time. It is also wholly compatible with Rick's sugges­tion (2005) that the canny (re-)use of extant, respected traditions was central to Chavfn's inno­vative sociopolitical maneuvering. The contrasting models apparently owe more to divergent theoret­ical explanations for the motivations of prehistoric peoples than to disagreements about the specific historical trajectory at Chavfn. The resolution of disagreements over the timing of that trajectory remains a necessary focus for future research, as the dates presented here highlight. 
Theoretical disagreements over the underpin­nings of prehistoric behavior notwithstanding, cer­tainly such persistence of the Mito Tradition implies broad cultural continuity in the Central Andes. It is also testament to the potential for new data-even at a site with a long history of fruitful research-to provoke new questions and re-open old ones. More­over, it also suggests a specific thread of continuity from the Late Preceramic through the Early Hori­zon. That architectural thread also explicitly links ritual practice in the Central Andean sierra to appar­ently similar practice on the coast, connecting the Central Andes spatially as well as temporally.

Notes 
I. Bonnier mentions that structures ER-28 and ·'proba­bly" ER-20 at Kotosh were "framed with a clay molding" (Bonnier 1997: 138), which may represent an analogous architectural element (see also Izumi and Terada 1972: 160).

2644 ± 45 (AA69446; wood charcoal; 813C = -23.2%0) and 2712 ± 42 (AA69447; wood charcoal; 813C = -23.6%0). 

3. 
Aluvi6n is the Andean term for a .catastrophic debris flow. In 1945 the site of Chavfn de Huantar, and part of the adjacent town, was buried by such an event, the result of a landslide into a glacial lake high up in the Wacheqsa River drainage. The resulting debris flow-a slurry of rock, earth, ice, and water estimated at 900,000 m3-descended the canyon of the Wacheqsa at an estimated 30+ km/hr, and buried Chavfn under up to 4 m of sediment (estimates from lndacochea and Iberico 1947). The thickness of the deposit varies widely throughout the site, with the amount of deposited material and the size of entrained debris dependent on the energy of the flow in any given area.

2506 ± 43 (AA69448; wood charcoal; o13C = -23.9%0) and 2567 ± 42 (AA69449; wood charcoal; 813C = -22.1%0). 

5. 
Any discussion of the excavation context must also take into account the fact that our work did not reach sterile soil­as attested by the architecture visible in the cut of the Wacheqsa River (see Figure 6). Future work may be able to expand the stratigraphic exposure by working outside the boundaries of the chamber proper, thus avoiding the ethical imperative of not destroying the intact Mito chamber archi­tecture. However, any future excavation will be tightly con­strained by the steep slope to the south and the river cut to the north. 

6. 
Ranging conceptually further afield, it also prompts questions (as yet unanswerable) about the possibility of het­erarchical rather than strictly hierarchical organization. 

7. 
In addition, Siveroni (2006) has recently criticized the very identification of structures with central hearths as ritual architecture. 


8. 
"The temples that were built during this second half of the third millennium B.C. respond to formal, well-defined canons that permit the identification of a tradition of ritual architecture ... We call this architectural and religious current the 'Mito Tradition' in reference to the site of Kotosh and the eponymous Mito phase, where its traces were discovered for the first time" [translation by author]. 

9. 
Lumbreras has argued, however, that this early ritual architecture in the Andean sierra itself was of a quality that reflects the existence of hierarchy and centralized control of labor (Lumbreras 1989:89); Onuki, with reference specifi­cally to Kotosh, agrees (Onuki 1999:328). 

10. 
Pozorski and Pozorski do not explicitly consider the Mito/Kotosh Religious Tradition distinction, but group the structures they describe in the Kotosh Religious Tradition. This choice is appropriate, as these examples of circular ven­tilated hearths in square or circular rooms seem to be more related to the Kotosh Religious Tradition generally than to the Mito Tradition specifically; their emphasis on the hearth is not accompanied by the elaboration of the construction hous­ing the hearth that Bonnier clearly distinguishes as integral to the Mito Tradition. 

11. 
Though the Mito-style structures at Cara! suggest per­haps a more geographically widespread Mito Tradition. 

12. 
"a tradition [Kotosh-Mito] that was not abandoned, but rather continued, by Chavfn's builders" [translation by author] . 

13. 
As the Mito-style structure at Chavfn may also be described as belonging to the broader category of the Kotosh Religious Tradition, its existence also reinforces Burger and Salazar-Burger's contention-based on the later hearths at Huaricoto (1985: 11 8)-that the Kotosh Religious Tradition persisted into the Early Horizon.
