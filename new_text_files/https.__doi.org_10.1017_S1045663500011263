northern Yucatan. Chapter 6 deals with regional and city specific sculptural forms, and in this way returns the reader to the unique civic styles first mentioned in Chap­ter 3. Chapter 7 discusses ceramic vessels again through the lens of regional styles. Miller's seminal work on murals informs Chapter 9 and makes for a particularly rich discussion, which includes murals recently exca­vated at San Bartolo, Calakmul, and Xultun. Chapter 10 brings the colonial and contemporary Maya into focus, even if only briefly. A chronology and glossary with illustrations conclude the volume and are a useful aid for those trying to juggle what can seem like an over­whelming amount of new information. 
As with any introductory text, there are omissions and underdeveloped areas. For example, Maya ceramic sculpture is as ancient and diverse as stone, but it is not extensively treated apart from a discussion of the dif­ferences between ceramic figurines and stone sculpture or as a possible precursor to the naturalism seen in Late Classic period sculpture (97). Ephemeral artistic genres (e.g., paper or bundles) are the least discussed, presum­ably because they can normally be viewed only through their depiction in narrative imagery. Thus, their exclu­sion apart for a few brief mentions (158) is understand­able, but it prevents the treatment of some of the most important vehicles for the presentation of Maya deities and ancestors. 
Of greater concern is that the calligraphic arts and epigraphy are underserved. Calligraphy represents a sig­nificant percentage of Maya sculpture and painting. 
Texts are often contiguous with the painted or sculptural image, and glyphs regularly appear within the frame­work of iconography. Like calligraphy in East Asian or Islamic art, epigrams are integral components of Maya art. Likewise, text and image relationships played a crit­ical role in Maya art and allowed the viewer to better comprehend narrative flow. For example, the scenes on the vessel illustrated in figure 196 (Kerr vessel 1398) are presented in reverse order in the narrative description from that indicated by both Rabbit's gesture towards the introductory glyph of the dedicatory inscription sur­rounding the vase's rim and the dialogue between God L and Rabbit in which God L asks Rabbit where his cloths are before he visits K'inich Ajaw (Sun God) in the next scene. This is a minor point but one that nev­ertheless is part of the incredible subtlety of Maya art. Because epigraphy is not a line of evidence with which the volume substantially engages, the reader comes away with a good awareness of the form of Maya art, but not always an equal understanding of its substance. Given the need for the book to remain focused on the art object, calligraphy and epigraphy were likely casu­alties, but for those who might wish to use the volume for instruction, this will be an area of artistic expression that will require supplemental material. 
Thus, the volume, to various degrees, privileges occi­dental genres and media. This would seem less apparent were it not for a descriptive language that occasionally reinforces this impression. For instance, in describing the naturalistic treatment of the human form in Maya art the authors state that "no other civilization in Mesoamerica came close to the achievement of the Maya in this respect, and only a few civilizations of the premodem world were their equals" (95). This statement is true enough to the extent that the Maya took a special interest in articulating the human form in a naturalistic manner, but this and similar statements reflect our own aesthetic sensibilities and goals, rather than those of the period. This descriptive language reinforces many of the assumptions about art that a lay and novice student of art history might already have. Would it not be better to spell out these differences both to indicate why, his­torically, the Maya came to be revered among Western audiences and, more importantly, to query the near verisimilitude with which the Classic Maya realized the human form? 
These relatively minor points aside, the book has proved valuable in the classroom. At the time of this writing, I am using this edition in my introductory course on Maya art precisely because it introduces current issues while providing a scaffold upon which students can build a basic understanding of Maya artistic styles and medial and subject genres. They have found the book approachable and, from class discussions, it is clear that they are able to effectively transport concepts from this volume to additional readings and to their engagement with works of art, many of which are not presented in the book. This is a great testament to the book's success. 
As Miller has so often accomplished in her work, this book successfully straddles the divide between pop­ular and scholarly literature to produce a work that con­tinues to be not only the essential introduction to the history of Maya art, but also one that addresses and raises critical questions and issues in the field of pre­columbian art history.

Inca expansion during the late precolumbian era. It brings together an eclectic set of authors who, in 24 chapters, take aim at this feature from a variety of disciplinary per­spectives, including archaeological, ethnographic, eth­nohistoric, linguistic, geographic, astronomic, environmental, paleobotanical, and pedological. While many of the papers start from the rather limited number of early colonial references that variously describe the Inca ushnu as a throne, an altar, a basin, or a receptacle for offerings, each presents a slightly different take on the feature that derives from the authors' own method­ological expertise and interests. The compendium as a whole provides many new insights and points of depar­ture for further investigation into the role and significance of the ushnu with respect to Inca ritual, statecraft, and metaphysics. 
This collection is bookended by papers from two eminent Andean scholars, the first (Chapter 2) being a contribution by Tom Zuidema that provides a general assessment of the ushnu from a primarily ethnohistoric perspective, and the last (Chapter 24) being a wrap-up and commentary on the preceding papers by Tristan Platt. Zuidema's contribution, in classic fashion, weaves together ethnohistoric data, ethnographic observations, linguistic information, and archaeoastronomical align­ments to argue that· the original Incaic concept of "ushnu" referred to a font or basin into which libations were poured. He suggests that the notion was subse­quently warped and expanded in later colonial transla­tions to both encompass and prioritize a platform-like structure typically associated with the font that was des­ignated for use of the Inca king during offertory rituals. In the Afterword, Platt highlights what he sees as key themes within the volume, including the significance of ritual to Inca statecraft, the relation between public and private in state affairs, and the ways in which a distinc­tive native Andean ontology was expressed. His discus­sion accords some importance to the materiality of ushnus-as provided by the archaeological evidence­for gaining insight into their precolumbian significance, rather than automatically privileging historic and ethno­graphic information. 
The various contributors to the volume bring a wide range of data to bear on the question of what constitutes an ushnu and what role it played in imperial Inca society. Several chapters provide insights derived from ethno­graphic research, including, in particular, those offered by Catherine Allen on ritual feeding and consumption; Denise Arnold on civic rituals performed at public school in Bolivia; Carmen Escalante G. and Ricardo Valderrama F. on community offerings made to local mountains in the Cuzco area; and Francisco Ferreira on the importance of mixing peoples and products from different eco-zones in contemporary religious festivals. A number of other chapters provide detailed archaeo­logical information on Inca sites with ushnus, including those of Cuzco (Farrington); Choqek'iraw (Lecoq and Saintenoy); Tambo Colorado (Protzen); Aypate, Mitu­pampa, Caxas, and Huancabamba in northern Peru (Astuhuaman); various sites centered on Mt. Coropuna in the Arequipa region (Ziolkowski); a collection of approximately 30 sites in the puna sector of the Ayacu­cho region (Meddens, Branch et al., Ramon Joffre, Vivanco Pomacanchari); and Vifia del Cerro in northern Chile and El Apunao in northwest Argentina (Moyano). A few chapters (e.g., Lecoq and Saintenoy, Moyano, and Zuidema) offer specific archaeo-astronomical data, while two others provide relevant geoarchaeological and climatological data (Branch et al., Thompson and Davis). The remainder of the chapters rely primarily on ethnohistoric information for their discussion of the ushnu and its significance (e.g, Coben, McEwan, Ogburn, Ramirez, Staller, and Stobart). 

Perhaps not surprisingly, the authors do not arrive at any consensus regarding what constitutes an ushnu. Based on the various analyses presented, an "ushnu" can range from the classic tiered platform that we often picture (thanks to Guaman Poma), to a receptacle or conduit for libations (Chapter 6), to a wet spot (Chapter 2), to a modern flagpole (Chapter 7), to a modified hill­top and potentially an entire site (Chapter 19). Many of the authors recognize the enormous variability in the kind of features to which the term has been applied and lament its over-extended usage. Others have usefully sought to engage with the diversity by looking for pat­terned variation among different classes or categories of ushnus. In particular, the chapters by Cesar Astuhuaman, Gabriel Ramon Joffre, and Mariusz Ziolkowski offer good models for how we might go about starting to tease apart the significance of this diver­sity by introducing the dimensions of temporality, spatial distribution, ecology, and ethnic variability into broader scale studies ofinca ushnus. 
Many of the papers in the volume cohere around a few specific themes. For instance, the significance of the physical mixing or integration of "natural" elements (e.g., stone, soil, water) in the composition of the ushnu was highlighted by several authors, including Denise Arnold, Nicholas Branch et al., Francisco Ferreira, Frank Meddens, and Dennis Ogburn. This observation poten­tially leads to insights into Inca and Andean metaphys­ical understandings of substance, agency, and relationality. It also brings to the fore the importance of the notion of embodiment, which has been discussed in the context of numerous other categories of Inca material culture, and suggests a native ontology and an under­standing of power that emphasized the concrete over the abstract.

Meddens, Susan Ramirez, and John Staller, associate or equate the ushnu with an axis mundi, following an early observation made by Zuidema in 1980. While this idea is for the most part not further developed, it could be suggested again that it is the physical and material aspect of the ushnu (as well as the concept of the "axis mundi" per se) that is key to the presumed "joining together of the cosmos" function it performs, rather than just the application of the abstract notion of "joining" to the ushnu feature, e.g., the concept of an axis mundi requires embodiment to be efficacious. 
In the collection of papers as a whole, what I find par­ticularly exciting is the way in which the archaeological evidence promises the possibility of new insights into the significance of Inca ushnus once researchers are released from the strictures of ethnohistory and ethnog­raphy. The material variability of these archaeological features in terms of composition, morphology, location, etc., needs to be further explored ratherthan glossed over in order to fit them under a single rubric. Many of the chapters in this book begin to take on this challenge. For me, they highlight the importance of seriously engaging with the material and contextual evidence pertaining to ushnus (and other elements of Inca material culture), rather than always defaulting to the minimal and often uniformed comments of the chroniclers. 
In sum, Inca Sacred Space: Landscape, Site and Symbol in the Andes represents a useful and scholarly contribution to Inca,Andean, and precolumbian studies. It integrates information from a number of disciplinary realms to provide insights into the nature and signifi­cance of the Inca ushnu and its role in the imperial Inca project. The book will be of particular interest to Inca specialists and precolumbian scholars in the areas of Archaeology, Anthropology, Ethnohistory, and Land­scape Studies.

The authors of this well-researched volume cover the symbolic importance of lightning in past and modem indigenous societies in Mesoamerica and the Andes. They present the iconographic, historic, archaeological, and cultural evidence for the significance of lightning, in addition to clarifying similarities and differences between these regions. The authors succeed in presenting exhaustive analyses of imagery and indigenous interpre­tations, but in doing so they include tangential and repet­itive cultural information. Another downside of the book includes fuzzy photographs of artifacts that could have been re-done or drawn. 
Staller and Stross point out that lightning is awe inspiring, but its symbolism is not well-studied. Light­ning can destroy, yet people link lightning to fertility, positive spiritual forces, and sacred places where it struck. In general, the authors look at how views of the natural world shaped precolumbian cultures. For instance, ruling elites associate their power and specific gods with lightning, which also makes it crucial for shamans, especially if they survived lightning strikes. Lightning is prevalent in tropical Mesoamerica and in the Andes, and it produces nitric acid in the soil where it strikes, which is important for agriculture. Addition­ally, lightning is associated with stone bifaces, crystals, metals, and child sacrifice. 
In the Andes region, lightning connects the mascu­line sky and the feminine earth by transmitting fluids to fertilize the land. Lightning emerges in myths that incor­porate mountains, rock outcrops, lakes, springs, and caves. Also, lightning was connected to metallurgy, ser­pents, and creation. Lightning infuses metals in cere­monial contexts, especially silver from mountains. Lightning resembles serpents, which symbolize water, storms, war, and fertility. Some information is not obvi­ously connected to lightning, such as marine shell imagery. Nonetheless, the discussions of lightning sym­bolism inAndean society are insightful, including obser­vations on the creation of the heavens. 
Furthermore, Andean shamans receive their power from lightning and their rituals are important for the prosperity of people and animals. The connection between lightning, nature, and shamans supports their religious power and control over fertility and regener­ation. Interestingly, stone bifaces, seen as 'lightning stones,' represent the flight of the souls of shamans. Also, elites can channel the forces of lightning and asso­ciated sacred places, such as mountain, cave, and water shrines, to contact spiritual forces for the benefit of soci­ety and cosmic balance. Through lightning symbolism, rulers construct ties with spirits at ritual places and make the shrines "speak." These messages transmit decisions of the spirits to rulers for the benefit of society, including the generation oflife and balancing the cosmos. Andean people view lightning as the creator of twins and people with harelips ('sons of lightning') who fit into notions of dualism in nature and society. 
In Mesoamerica, the authors demonstrate the asso­ciation of lightning with storms, war, mountains, caves, twins, serpents, tobacco, and growth in maize and mush­rooms. Snakes are assistants of lightning because of their similarity in form and since both appear during storms. Tobacco wards off snakes and lightning, and
