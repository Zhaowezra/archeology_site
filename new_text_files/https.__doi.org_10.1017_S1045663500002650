The lower lea Valley on the hyperarid south coast of Peru is today largely depopulated and bereft of cultivation, yet its exten­sive archaeological remains attest to substantial prehispanic populations. This paper describes archaeological investiga­tions to retrace changes in geomorphology, ecology, and land-use in Samaca, one of the riparian oasis basins of the lower Rfo lea, with the aim of investigating when. how, and why such changes took place. Archaeological interpretations of cul­ture change in the region often invoke the impacts of major ENSO perturbations (El Nifio ). While our investigations con­firm that major El Nifio events around the end of the Early Intermediate Period likely offer part of the explanation for marked landscape change in the Samaca Basin, we also demonstrate the significance of more gradual, human-induced destruction of Prosopis pallida (huarango) riparian dry-forest. Huarango is a remarkable leguminous hardwood that lives for over a mil­lennium and providesforage,fuel, and food. Moreover, it plays a crucial role in integrating fragile desert ecosystems, enhanc­ing soil fertility and moisture, and accomplishing desalination and microclimatic amelioration. We propose that south coast valleys remained densely forested well into the Early Intermediate Period, attenuating the impact of El Nifio events and sup­porting hitherto underappreciated agroforestry adaptations. Gradual deforestation eventually crossed an environmental threshold: river and wind erosion increased dramatically and precipitated radical desertification, feeding back into cul­tural changes in the Middle Horizon. Thus we argue Prosopis-human ecological relationships merit proper recognition in our archaeological interpretations of the south coast of Peru. 
En la actualidad, el valle bajo def r{o lea, ubicado en el litoral hiperarido def Peru, se encuentra practicamente despoblado y carente de toda actividad agr{cola. Los vestigios arqueol6gicos, sin embargo, sugieren la presencia de sustanciales con­centraciones de poblacion durante tiempos prehispanicos. En este art{culo describimos nuestras investigaciones arqueologi­cas en Samaca, uno de las oasis riberefios del valle bajo def rfo lea, dirigidas a reconstruir las cambios geomoifol6gicos, ecologicos y de uso de la tierra con el fin de averiguar cuando, coma y par que sucedio este gran cambio en el valle. Las inter­pretaciones arqueologicas referentes al cambio cultural en la region a menudo invocan el impacto de eventos ENSO ('El Nino') de gran magnitud. Aun cuando nuestras investigaciones confirman que tales eventos ocurridos aproximadamente al final del Periodo Jntermedio Temprano Jarman muy posiblemente parte de la explicacion, estas demuestran ademas la relevancia de la deforestacion def bosque seco riberefio de Prosopis pa/Iida (huarango ), un proceso mas gradual y de orig en humano. El huarango, notable leguminosa de madera dura capaz de vivir mas de mil afios, no solo provee forraje, combustible y alimento sino que ademas sabemos es crucial en la integracion del fragil ecosistema desertico, mejorando la fertilidad y humedad def sue lo y logrando desalinizaci6n y mejora microclimatica. Proponemos que las valles de la costa sur estaban densamente forestados durante una buena parte de! Per{odo lntermedio Temprano, lo cual atenuo las impactos de eventos El Nifio y permitio el surgimiento de adaptaciones agroforestales poco reconocidas hasta hoy. Sostenemos que la deforestacion gradual eventual­mente sobrepaso un umbra/ ambiental que condujo al dramatico incremento de la erosion fluvial y e6lica, precipitando un proceso de desertificacion, el cual ha contribuido y ha sido causado par las cambios culturales def Horizonte Media. Nue­stros resultados abogan en favor de una incorporaci6n mucho mas comp/eta de las relaciones ecol6gicas entre el Prosopis y el ser humano en las interpretaciones arqueologicas de la costa sur.

he lower lea Valley, on the hyperarid south coast of Peru, is today largely depopulated and bereft of cultivation. Yet its extensive archaeological remains attest to substantial pre­hispanic populations and present a prima f acie case for changed ecological and landscape conditions (Cook 1999; Massey 1991; Strong et al. 1943). This paper describes work conducted in the Samaca Basin of the Rfo lea to investigate this landscape change, with particular focus upon the ecological keystone species of the region: trees of the genus Prosopis. 
As Wells and Noller (1999) point out, the archaeological record of the Peruvian south coast is usually interpreted against the constraints of an effectively static arid landscape, impacted period­ically by catastrophic El Nino events. While rec­ognizing the importance of these within a model of "punctuated equilibrium," we need also to attempt to distinguish their impacts from more gradual changes, many of which in the lower lea Valley were, we will argue, human-induced. 
Prosopisis a remarkable leguminous hardwood tree, capable of living for over a millennium and providing timber, forage, fuel, and food. Trees of the genus are known in Quechua as Thaccu or Taco (Yacovleff and Herrera 1934:291). According to D' Antoni and Solbrig (1977 :191) this means "the tree" or "the one," which might be indicative of its importance and cultural antiquity if it were better justified with appropriate linguistic citation.1 Its mention in archaeological literature is almost inevitably in reference to its use as construction material or fuel. We will argue, however, that its importance to archaeological interpretation should go far beyond an appreciation of its value as a human resource. 
For Prosopis is crucial for ecological integra­tion and biodiversity in many of the fragile desert ecosystems of the Americas. And the riparian dry forests of the south coast of Peru are today almost gone. The implications for the region's landscape can only be appreciated in the context of an under­standing of the biology and ecology of Prosopis, its importance in moderating desert environmental extremes and in maintaining the complexity of its sensitive ecosystem, including human participants. Our focus here upon human ecology does not nec­essarily make the interpretations we derive envi­ronmentally deterministic. On the contrary, it may 
allow for more informed discrimination between 
human agency and environment response. 
Archaeological investigation, comprising geo­morphological survey, archaeological survey, and excavation and archaeobotanical analysis, concen­trated upon a c. 50 ha area of the upper Samaca Basin, known as "H-13" (Cook 1994), which exhibits evidence of environmental degradation and diminished land-use over time (see Beresford-Jones et al. 2004; Beresford-Jones 2005; Beresford-Jones et al. 2009 for details on our methodologies). We, aim to answer the following questions: was H-13 once a productive and vegetated landscape, and if so, when and how did change take place, and why did it occur? 
A Note on Prosopis Identification on the South Coast 
Some preliminary observations are in order regard­ing the taxonomy of Prosopison the south coast of Peru. The systematics of the genus are complex and subject to ongoing revision. Like many arid area plants, the genus shows great phenotypic plastic­ity in response to environmental fluctuations (Ibrahim 1992) and frequent interspecific hybridization (Solbrig et al. 1977). Confusion over its taxonomy began with the Spanish conquerors, who called the tree they encountered el algarrobo de las lndias because it resembled the algarrobo, or carob tree (genus Ceratonia) of the Mediter­ranean (D' Antoni and Solbrig 1977; Vildoso 1996). "Algarrobo" is today the most common vernacu­lar name for Prosopis tree species across most of South America (Pasiecznik et al. 2001 ), including the north and central coast of Peru. On the south coast the genus is known locally as "huarango" or "guarango." Again confusingly, the name "huarango" on the north coast of Peru refers to the other coastal tree species Acacia macracantha (Brack Egg 1999), known on the south coast as "espino." In the United States, various Prosopis species are known as "mesquite." 
The development of Pros op is taxonomy and its inherent difficulties on the coast of Peru can be traced through the work of Mac Bride (1943 ), Weberbauer ( 1945), Burkhart (1976), Burkhart and Simpson (1977) and Ferreyra (1987), Diaz Celis (1995), Pasiecznik et al. (2001), Mom et al. (2002) and Harris et al. (2003), and see Beresford-Jones

2005 for a comprehensive survey. As Dfaz Celis observes, "the systematic treatment of the algarrobo in Peru has been variable and confused" (1995:47, first author translation). 
Rather unsurprisingly then, difficulties with Prosopis taxonomy abound in the archaeological literature. Yacovleff and Hetrera (1934 :291) orig­inally identified artifacts of "algarrobo" wood as Prosopis juliflora. Towle, likely following MacBride ( 1946), considered this identification mistaken, stating that "juliflora does not occur in Peru" and that the Peruvian equivalent is P. chilen­sis, "a plant very similar to P. juliflora and often confused with it" (1961 :56). Most archaeological authors continue to follow Towle in identifying materials as P. chilensis (for example Menzel et al. 1964; Shimada and Shimada 1985; Silverman 1993; Cook1999; Silverman and Proulx 2002). 
Scrupulously, these identifications are almost certainly incorrect. As Pasiecznik et al. caution, "initial misidentification without correction can be repeated continually" (2001 :21). P. chilensis is, in fact, one of the most distinctive Prosopis species in its live condition, by virtue of its larger leaf mor­phology (see Pasiecznik et al. 2001:33). None of the many trees that we have observed on the south coast of Peru today show the P. chi lens is leaf type (see Beresford-Jones 2005; Whaley 2004). Fol­lowing Burkart and Simpson (1977), Diaz Celis (1995), Pasiecznik et al. (2001 ), and Harris et al.'s (2003) systematics, and in agreement with most other current taxonomic authorities, we identify them as P. pallida, although, as discussed in Mom et al. (2002) the name P. limensis may now be more appropriate for the huarango of the south coast. Likewise, all of the features of the large numbers of desiccated Prosopis macrofossils obtained from archaeological contexts in the course of this research, including leaves, brachyblasts, and pods, are those of P. pallida (Beresford-Jones 2005; cf. Piacenza 2002). 
Indeed, archaeological wooden artifacts from anywhere on the coast of Peru are rather unlikely to be of P. chilensis (Molina) Stuntz, which occurs only in disjunct populations in higher altitude, dry intermontane locations, mainly in the south of the country (Brack Egg 1999; Burkart and Simpson 
1977; Dfaz Celis 1995; Pasiecznik et al. 2001 ), and 
much more likely to be of the so-called "P. juliflora 
-P. pallida complex" (see Pasiecznik et al. 2001). 
The botanist Herrera was likely well aware of this in making his original identification of coastal algarrobos as P. juliflora (Yacovleff and Herrera 1934 ), since he had already identified the Prosopis of the high intermontane valleys, as P. chilensis (Dfaz Celis 1995). 
Such specific identifications are arguably unnec­essary for some purposes of archaeological inter­pretation. All of them fall into Burkart's section Algarobiaof the genus (Burkart and Simpson 1977) and their ecological characteristics are broadly sim­ilar. As Felger observes on the importance of mesquite to the native cultures of the southwestern United States, "ethnobotanically it is both conve­nient and realistic to treat the North American mem­bers of the sectionAlgarobiaas a unit" ( 1977: 150). References to Prosopis herein will therefore refer generally to all varieties of the P. juliflora -P. pa/­Iida complex, unless specified otherwise. 
However, specific identifications are more important to considerations of Prosopisas a human resource. Peruvian accessions of P. pallida exhibit greater productions of larger, sweeter pods (Gra­dos and Cruz 1996; Lee et al. 1992) and superior growth rates and forms (see, for example, Harris et al. 2003; Lee et al. 1992; Pasiecznick et al. 2001), than other Proso pis species. Moreover, while Prosopis on the north coast occur both with and without thorns (Dfaz Celis 1995; Ferreyra 1987), mature P. pallida on the south coast only rarely pro­duce thorns (Beresford-Jones 2005; Whaley 2004 ). This is noteworthy because selection for thorn­lessness in some economic tree species is often almost the only observable phenotypic difference between so-called "wild" and "cultivated" varieties (most famously with the olive, Olea europaea). This leads us to speculate that those specific fea­tures we observe in the P. pallidaof the south coast, (or P. limensis) and so widely appreciated in the agroforestry literature, may be the product of long processes of human selection (and see Pasiecznick et al. 2001:51), preserved from subsequent back­crossing and hybridization by the relative isolation of its riparian ecosystems (Beresford-Jones 2005).

drainage systems (Cooke et al. I993). These ripar­ian basins have been the locus for human settle­ment since at least the Early Horizon (Cook 1999) (see Figure 1). Samaca is one of several basins that constitute the course of the lower lea River Valley, cut into the Tablazo de lea-a tertiary sedimentary rock plateau (see Figure 2). It is a well-defined and convenient landscape unit within which to assess particular human-environment interactions (French 2003). The climate is hyperarid, with an average annual precipitation of only .3 mm per year (ONERN 1971 ). In this environment there are only two natural geomorphological agents acting within the Samaca basin, in opposite directions-the wind and the river (although our theme here will invoke a third agent-humans). 
The Rio lea exhibits a very different geomor­phological configuration to the broad fan-shaped delta complexes of most of the major Peruvian westward-flowing coastal rivers. This distinction arises because of the widening of the coastal strip on the south coast, a result of the uplifted forearc basin known as the "Pisco Formation" (Dunbar et al. 1990). Blocked from the sea, the Rio lea is diverted south, parallel to the coast, for some 150 km, through a series of wide basins that it has incised into the sedimentary desert tableland of the Tablazo de lea (see Figure 2). It thus has no wide delta and deposits its alluvial sediments along its course within these basins. Life and human settle­ment in this desert are restricted to this "riparian oasis" corridor along the river which links the mountains to the ocean. 
Surface flow in the Rio lea is extremely erratic and seasonal, fed by summer rainfall in the distant Andean highlands and lasting for only around three months per year. Annual discharge since 1922 has oscillated widely (standard deviation of over 150) about a mean of 257 million m3. It has experienced occasional annual flows of over 800 million m3, which can be correlated with perturbations in the Southern Oscillation Index or El Nino (Beresford­Jones 2005), and many other years with practically no smface flow at all (SENAMHI-Ica 2002). 
The wind regime of the lower lea Valley is extra­ordinarily strong and unimodal from the south. Mega-yardangs, hundreds of meters high, etched upon the surface of the Tablazo de lea (see Figures 2 and 6), are testimony to stability of this wind regime over great time depths (Beresford-Jones 2005; McCauley et al. I 977). Average monthly wind velocities in the Samaca Basin, measured

H-I3, the focus of our investigation, defines an area of c. 60 hectares of relict river terrace, stand­ing around 5 m above the floodplain and 10 m higher than the current Rio lea thalweg. It is entirely devoid of vegetation. Within this area are numer­ous archaeological remains, including the founda­tions of stone enclosures, heavily looted cemeteries, and agricultural features such as relict canal courses. Over parts of the surface are various, occa­sionally dense, scatters of midden materials, ceramic fragments and lithics (see Figure 2). Cemented CaC03 duracretes, known locally as caliche, are the defining characteristic of the H-13 relict terrace and they have a profound effect upon its extant land surface. The high, unvegetated relict terrace is exposed to the full force of the region's extraordinary wind regime. The effects of aeolian deflation are evident across much of the H-13 land­scape: its surface is scattered with multi-period palimpsests of ceramic sherds. Also, in a classic inversion of relief, wind deflation has created com­plex second-order landforms, whereby features such as canals, once cut into the land surface, are preserved by calcrete enrichment as upstanding features above the deflated surrounding landscape (see Figure 7) (Cooke et al. 1993; Maizels 1988). 
Was Samaca H-13 A Productive Landscape? 
54 wind-abraded relict Prosopis trunks were iden­tified across the barren expanse of H-13 in survey and excavation, seemingly rendering this first ques­tion rhetorical (see Figures 2 and 3). The highest (Tl5, Figure 2) was recorded at 233 m asl, 24 m above the groundwater level in April, 2002.

indicate that they existed on H-13 for many hun­dreds of years, encompassing entire cultural peri­ods. Thus, as witnesses of ecological change, Prosopisfossils effectively "compress time." 
Taken together, the total number, local group­ings, and varied sizes of the many relict tree trunks and copious other Prosopisfossils suggest strongly thatH-13 was once vegetated with more than just isolated Prosopis individuals. 
Above groundwater levels, organic remains enjoy remarkable preservation conditions in these hyperarid conditions, and many other plant macro and microfossil assemblages were identified from excavation contexts across H-13 (Beresford-Jones 2005). These included many plants from the ripar­ian dry forest ecosystem, agricultural and disturbed areas, and even obligate wetland species, in Test Pits I, 1/030, 1/031, 2, 4, 5 (see Figure 2).

1yzed as a record of the hi story of the terrace before the archaeological remains were deposited on its surface. Grain size profiles down through this sec­tion suggest that in those deeper time contexts the deposition environment was radically different both from the upper stratigraphic unit proximate to the 
H-13 archaeological remains, and from the condi­tions that prevail today (see Beresford et al. 2009). In view of the relict canal system on the surface of H-13, these differences are interpreted as the result of human control, agriculture, and pedogenesis on the episodic elastic sediment regime of the under­lying river floodplain. This also suggests that the relict river terrace was part of the active river flood­plain when its canal systems were operational, and that the river down-cutting event(s) that formed this relict terrace post-date that time. This will be explored further below. 
Preserved surfaces dating to archaeological time periods are scarce across H-13, due to the effects of wind deflation. However, they can be found buried and sealed beneath the deposits of the climbing 
dune anchored along the western flank of the Samaca Basin by its unimodal wind regime. Micro­morphological analysis of contexts from Test Pits 1 and 1/030 (Figure 4C) reveals buried soils beneath these dune deposits (Beresford-Jones et al. 2007). Today, these once organic soil horizons lie over half a kilometer to the west, about 5 m above the edge of the current floodplain amid a barren landscape (see Figures 2 and 4A). As the unconsolidated aeo­lian deposits were removed during the excavation of Test Pit 1, a remarkably preserved footprint was found on the underlying, hard silt-loam surface (see Figure 4 B ), providing clear and rather poignant evi­. dence of a once moist surface now sealed under the climbing dune, and thus of the extent of landscape

landscape change. The ceramic seriations of the lea Valley are relatively well studied. Indeed, they underlie Rowe's widely accepted master sequence for Andean prehistory (see Rowe 1967). Nonethe­less, uncertainties remain as to their finer details, such as the so-called Dawson seriation for Nasca, widely cited but unpublished (see Proulx 1968, 2006; Silverman 1993; Silverman and Proulx 2002). Our dating by means of decorated ceram­ics is therefore conservative: we use only those wider, uncontroversial categories that are necessary for tracing ecological and cultural changes within a relatively broadly defined temporal framework. In the case of Nasca we follow the categories defined by Silverman (1993:36) on the basis of those originally suggested by Rowe, which corre­spond more or less to those of Kroeber (Kroeber and Collier 1998) and Sawyer ( 1997). This effec­tively lumps together and thus avoids those details of the Dawson phases that remain of concern, pend­ing clarification. For the Early Horizon we also draw upon Menzel et al. ( 1964) and Cook ( 1999); for the Early Intermediate Period we look to David Browne (personal communication 2007), as well as the works already cited; for the Middle Horizon we follow Menzel ( 1967) and Kroeber and Collier (I998); and for the Late Intermediate Period, Men­zel (1976).

Many hundreds of ceramic fragments covering time periods from the Early through to Middle Horizon were encountered in survey and excava­tion ofH-13 contexts (see Figure 5). Although aeo­lian deflation has destroyed most of the original stratigraphy ofH-13, it has also in effect excavated vast expanses to leave heavier archaeological mate­rials scattered in multi-period palimpsests over the present-day land surface. An important observation on the H-13 archae­ological remains is the conspicuous absence of any material from the Late Intermediate or Late Hori­zon periods, despite the presence of two large habi­tation sites from those periods within the current floodplain of the lower Samaca Basin: "H-8" and "H-9" (see Figure 6 and Cook 1994 ). We thus con­clude that this H-13 landscape had already been abandoned prior to those periods. Further archae­ological data refine this conclusion. Survey demonstrates that the H-13 relict canal fragments were all once part of a contemporary sys­tem, though the precise dating of features such as canal systems, in use over extended time-periods, is problematic. Nevertheless, a range of evidence strongly suggests a terminus ante quern for this system accurately, but not precisely, to around the end of the Early Intermediate Period (Beresford­Jones et al. 2004; Beresford-Jones 2005). This evi­dence includes: ceramic finds excavated from the indurated evaporitic duracretes that now constitute the original courses of relict canals Features 40 and 33 (Test Pits 2 and 4, respectively), which show extensive iron oxide staining indicative of immer­sion in water; as well as contextual associations from ongoing wide-scale survey and excavation in the Samaca and adjoining Ullujaya basin. Calcite cementation to more than 3 m beneath their courses is evidence that these canals were in operation for considerable periods of time (Beresford-Jones et 
: al. 2009; Machette 1985; see Figure 7). 
The relict Prosopis trunks mapped across H-13 
are clearly associated with areas of duracrete 
exposed by wind deflation (see Figure 2): the great 
majority were surveyed within a narrow altitudinal 
range between 220.0 and 220.5 m asl, corre­
sponding to that surface. Ceramic fragments span­
ning some 800 years, from the later Ocucaje phases 
and Nasca phases, were found in mixed scatters 
across these deflated duracrete surfaces (Beresford­
Jones 2005). The relict trunks show the effects of 
prolonged wind abrasion (see Figure 3). Prosopis wood is very dense and harder than oak or teak (Ibrahim 199 2; Pasiecznick et al. 2001; Rogers 2000), and in these hyperarid conditions can be preserved over millennia (Kroeber 1944; Kroeber and Collier 1998; Strong and Evans 1952). The extant forms of the H-13 relict trunks are nonethe­less quite distinct from Prosopis posts (horcones) in the Late Intermediate to Late Horizon site ofH­8, exposed to the same wind regime but which exhibit far less wind erosion. These relict trunks in the H-13 duracrete are therefore interpreted as liv­ing trees that met their demise at some time prior to the Late Intermediate Period. 

Finally, the predominant mound in the H-13 landscape, Feature 23, was excavated by Test Pits 5 and 6 (Beresford-Jones 2005). Its upper strati­graphic contexts yielded diverse midden materials from Middle Horizon Epoch 2B (see Figure 5). Below these, its character at depth includes tree throws and aeolian contexts dominated by Prosopis leaf litter, which establish Mound 23 as a relict nabkha, or phytogenic mound, formed by wind deposition about a large tree(s) (see Figure 8). The extant form of the mound, amid its surrounding deflated duracreted landscape covered with mixed ceramic fragments from earlier epochs, is imputed to its later age, to the binding effects of nabkha for­mation, and to the density of heavy ceramic and lithic midden materials on its surface. 
Flotations of the midden contexts of Mound 23 yielded well-preserved desiccated plant assem­blages (see Figure 8). In one stratigraphic unit (S.U. 32), these included coca seed (Erythroxylum sp.), leaf fragments of Inga feuillei (pacay ), and seeds ofPsidium guajava (guava or guayaba). Coca leaf, the useful part of the plant, first becomes visible in the south coast archaeobotanical record from Late Nasca to the Middle Horizon (Piacenza 2002; Sil­verman and Proulx 2002). Its presence in these contexts is thereby congruent with their dating to the Middle Horizon. The occurrence of coca seed in this conjunction of plant remains is furthermore noteworthy because of historical evidence for coastal coca plantations under pacay and guayaba shade trees (Rostworowski 1989). Moreover, these archaeobotanical remains suggest dramatically altered ecological conditions across a wider con­text beyond H-13, since neither coca nor the large, simple-leafed pacay and guayaba fruit trees can

persist anywhere today in the wind regime of this 
part of the lower lea Valley (Mariano Cabrera, per­
sonal communication 2002). 
Together these data suggest that Samaca H-13 
was vegetated until the Middle Horizon Period, but 
had become barren and abandoned prior to the Late 
Intermediate Period. 
How Did Change Occur on Samaca H-13? 
Punctuated Equilibrium 
A characteristic of Andean archaeological inter­
pretation has been its emphasis upon catastrophic 
events in the form of El Nifio flood and/or La Nifia 
drought events (or perturbations in the Southern 
Oscillation Index, "ENSO"). Ice-core records from 
the Quelccaya ice cap (Thompson et al. 1985) have 
been used to postulate that major climatic pertur­
bations correlate with so-called "punctuations" evi­
dent in the archaeological record of the Peruvian 
coast (see for example Moseley 1992; Shimada et 
al. 1991 ; Silverman and Proulx 
2002). Why a 
"punctuated equilibrium" model is important to 
archaeological interpretation is demonstrated by 
some of the H-13 data. 
Excavation of Test Pit 4 (Figure 9C) revealed a 
thick fluvial layer, stratigraphic unit 19 (or, S.U. 
19). This was one of several remaining fragments 
of a sheet flood deposit (known locally as yapana ), 
up to 60 cm thick, that once covered much of the 
area of a second relict river terrace lying below H­
13, also now barren and deflated by wind erosion 
(see Figures 2 and 9A). The significance of this 
layer lies in its position and approximate dating: 
S.U. 19 directly caps midden contexts containing ceramic fragments from the Nasca 2/3 Early Inter­mediate Period. 
The effects of any ENSO event may vary from 

' one coastal valley to the next. The 1997 /98 El Nifio 
was particularly severe in the lea Valley. It flooded 
the city oflca to a depth of over 2 m, and in the 
Samaca Basin downstream destroyed most of a 
substantial Late Intermediate/Late Horizon archae­
ological site recorded as "H-9" (Figure 6; Cook 
1994). It follows that this was the greatest flood in 
the lower lea Valley for at least the last 500 years. 
And yet this flood appears relatively minor in its spatial impact upon the upper Samaca Basin in comparison to the event that deposited S.U. 19. 
The surveyed altitudes of preserved fragments of 
S.U. 19, even on a conservative analysis, imply a sheet flood across the equivalent profile in the Samaca Basin some 4 m higher than the maximum river level during the 1997 /98 El Nifio. This is illus­trated in Figure 10below, which uses a digital ele­vation model (DEM) of the Basin's current topography to project a theoretical sheet flood at the level of the S.U. 19 deposit. Indeed, there are some notable correlations between the projected extents of the S. U. 19 event and the extant form of archaeological and landscape features of H-13. 
The original primary canal operating across H­13 during the Early Intermediate Period is today preserved in two fragments, Features 40 and 34, separated by the incursion of the river floodplain, which coincides precisely with the simulated incur­sion of the S. U. 19 flood into H-13. A secondary relict canal, Feature 33, also in operation during the Early Intermediate Period (see Figure 9A), and an adjacent midden dating to the same period, were completely submerged by this flood event, as demonstrated by the stratigraphic sequence of Test Pit 4 (see Figures 9C and 10). For much of its length the edge of the H-13 terrace is defined by a steep embankment some 5 m high. This runs parallel to the river at the point where its erosive force would have been at its strongest during the postulated flood, and is the result of river incision (e.g., Sec­tion 1/013, Figure 10). Downstream from this embankment edge is a series of 2 m high relict braided channel banks, composed of large, sub­rounded cobbles deposited by the river in spate (Feature 18, Figure 10). 
This stands as evidence of a major flood event, occurring at some time toward the end of the Early Intermediate Period, which spread a deep fluvial layer across the upper Samaca Basin, caused the river to cut some 5 m down into its floodplain, and had catastrophic effects upon the H-13 canal sys­tem. Our data thus reflects those wider observations on the likely catastrophic effects of major El Nifio events along the coast of Peru. 
While this recreation of the S.U. 19 flood event as a horizontal sheet flood is useful for illustrating its magnitude and identifying its landscape "foot­print," it is also necessarily somewhat simplistic. The erosion and deposition effects of any actual event would vary greatly across space. Within an area of general sheet flood there will be points of localized

on unequal topographical bases. It would therefore be simplistic merely to posit Figure 10 as the full story of how and why change occurred on Samaca H-13. A more complete interpretation requires us to take into account two further, related factors: riparian vegetation changes and river entrenchment. 
Riparian Vegetation 
It is a mistake to assume that because riparian vegetation is generally less dense in deserts than elsewhere, it is of no consequence. In fact, phreatophytes ... significantly influence chan­nel geometry by increasing bank resistance to erosion, inducing deposition and increasing roughness [Cooke et al. 1993: 153]. 
The preeminent native phreatophyte of arid American riparian ecosystems is the genus Prosopis, which has one of the deepest and most laterally extensive root systems of any tree in any environment (Stone and Kalisz 1991). P. pallida roots in Peru typically extend to 2 to 3 times the diameter of the tree's crown, frequently access water tables 25 m deep, and have been recorded at well over 60 m long (Dfaz Celis 1995; Galera 2000). This deep Prosopisroot architecture "under­pins" floodplain and river meanders, providing the edaphic conditions for a river-bank species assem­blage, which on the Rfo lea comprises, in order of distance from the water's edge: Tessaria intergri­
folia ('Pajara bobo'); Phragmites sp. ('Car­
rizillo'); Arundo donax ('Carrizo' or Cana'); 
Baccharis lanceolata ('Chilco' or 'Chilca'); Salix 
humboldtiana ('Sauce'); Acacia macracantha ('Espino'); Tecoma fulva ('Cahuato'); Galvezia fruticosa ('Curil' ?-local name not widely known); Vallesia glabra ('Perlillo') and finally Pluchea chingoyo ('Toiiuz'), found throughout the floodplain. The combined, heterogeneous root architecture and vegetation cover of this riparian assemblage makes for a robust, erosion-resistant system (Galan de Mera 1996, 1999; Whaley 2004). 
Studies of the effects of changes in the density of riparian vegetation in the Gila River drainage of the south-western United States demonstrate how channel width decreases and channel sinuosity increases with increasing phreatophyte density, thanks to the effects of their root systems (Graf 2002). The corollary of these influences upon chan­nel form are increased opportunities for irrigation intakes, infiltration or riverbank breaches during flood events, giving rise to standing flood deposits like those represented by S.U. 19. It follows that the much greater extent of the S.U. 19 flood as compared with that of the 1997/98 El Niiio event may not be a reflection of actual differences in river discharge between the two events, but rather of much denser riparian vegetation in the floodplain when the S.U. 19 event occurred. 
River Entrenchment 
The other factor of topographic change intimately related to riparian vegetation cover is river entrench­ment. In Test Pit 4 contexts beneath S.U. 19, des­iccated plant macrofossils were found in such an excellent state of preservation that it appears likely

that the S. U. 19 flood was a rare or perhaps unique inundation at this point in the landscape. It is also difficult to see why the Early Intermediate inhabi­tants would have gone to the trouble of construct­ing canal Feature 33 perpendicular to the river direction within the usual, active river floodplain, or indeed that any remnant of it would remain today if they had. The Rfo lea is therefore unlikely to have significantly altered its course laterally in this basin since the S.U. 19 event. That it has incised down­wards, however, by at least 5 m or so, is evidenced by the terrace embankment described as Section 1/013. Incision diminishes a river's floodplain area, changing the relationship between river flood vol­ume and the extent of the resulting sheet flood and thus undermining any easy comparison between the 
S.U. 19 and the 1997/98 events. 
Moseley et al. (1983) identify river floodplain incision as the cause of progressive abandonment of canal systems in the Moche Valley on the north coast of Peru. To maintain a given area under canal irrigation following incision, canal intakes have to be extended further upstream. Since unlined canals exposed to high evaporation progressively lose water, they cannot be extended indefinitely and must eventually be abandoned. Moseley et al. pos­tulate tectonic uplift as the cause of this entrench­ment, based upon the occasionally uphill course followed by the Chicama-Moche inter-valley canal. Yet the Chicama-Moche canal system never actu­ally carried water along its whole length, and its occasional uphill courses have since been inter­preted as engineering failure rather than later tec­tonic uplift (Pozorski and Pozorski 2003). Furthermore, there is little geomorphological evi­dence that the Andean north coast has experienced significant uplift during archaeological time peri­ods (Cooke et al. 1993; Wells and Noller 1999). Indeed, Moseley et al. explicitly recognize another possible explanation, noting that "in theory, if such land supported a more erosion-resistant vegetation cover when under irrigation than when left aban­doned, then a corollary of highland irrigation col­lapse could be 'deforestation' and consequent erosion that could exacerbate river down cutting, 
leading to intake stranding of the coastal canal sys­tems" (1983:323). The "erosion resistance" of Prosopishas already been discussed above. 
In the 1920s, the geomorphologist Kirk Bryan noted the rapid degradation in the Gila River Basin that had been taking place since the 1870s, partic­ularly through the phenomenon of "arroyo" for­mation. This had catastrophic consequences for the landscape and for irrigation and floodwater farm­ing in the region (Nabhan 19 86). 
The major environmental damage occurs through loss of vegetation whose root struc­tures formerly held the banks of streams and rivers in place .... Widened channels · are cut deeper by subsequent rapid runoff, and the result is an arroyo, a deep trench cut to a depth of 50 feet or more into the terrain. These trenches, in tum, lower the groundwater level by draining soil moisture from the adjoining terrain [Hackenberg 1983:162]. 
The phenomenon of arroyo cutting (Cooke and Reeves 1976; Cooke et al. 1993; Graf 2002;) involves complex interplay between what Cooke et al. term "self-enhancing feedback mechanisms" of both climatic and human-induced effects (1993:160). As Hackenberg observes, "living streams with narrow channels, ideal for irrigation with primitive tools, became intermittent flood channels with crumbling and widening banks­impossible to control" (1983:162). 
We suggest, then, a picture analogous to the North American Southwest: the river entrenchment noted in the Samaca Basin, and perhaps elsewhere on the Peruvian coast, is the result not of tectonic uplift but of an ongoing decline in riparian vegeta­tion in the river floodplain, and in particular of Prosopis (see Beresford-Jones 2005 for the defin­ition and justification of a limited analogy between the Gila and lea river systems by reference to their comparable hydrology, basin-range geomorphol­ogy and flora). 
Thus, the apparent difference between the extent of the ancient S. U. 19 and the 1997 /98 El Nino flood event in the upper Samaca Basin could be the result of: (a) much greater riparian vegetation in the river floodplain in the past; and (b) river entrenchment during the S.U. 19 event and subsequent flood events, caused by gradual, ongoing removal of riparian vegetation from the floodplain. 
S.U. 19 nevertheless represents an enormous flood event, likely the result of a so-called "super" El Nino, comparable to that of 1997 /98 (Bendix et al. 2002). It demonstrably damaged and submerged parts of the Early Intermediate canal system. At the

major Nasca period site of Cahuachi on the Rfo Nazca, Grodzicki identifies roughly contemporary effects of major El Nin o impacts (Orefici and Drusini 2003), which again include river down­cutting and a narrowing of the vegetated flood­plain. The point here is not to deny the significance of these chaotic fluctuations in the biophysical envi­ronment, but to observe that their impacts would be precipitated by ongoing processes of gradual change, causing them to breach critical desert geo­morphic thresholds, particularly through river entrenchment. A more complete picture of how change occurred on Samaca H-13 thus requires us to superpose more gradual processes of change, upon the punctuated equilibrium of El Nino/drought impacts. Our data also provide evi­dence that the H-13 relict terrace did not suddenly 
. become denuded of vegetation following, or indeed 
until long after, the S.U. l  event. 
Gradual Change 
Pollen data interpreted according to context, tapho­nomic considerations and comparisons with plant macrofossil data, help elaborate the history of grad­ual change on H-13 (Beresford-Jones 2005). There are rather few precedents for successful pollen extractions from Peruvian coastal locations (Weir and Eling 1986 ; Wells and Noller 1999), although good pollen preservation has been reported from other arid environments (Fish 1985; Gilbertson et al.1994). SomeH-13 contexts yielded good pollen concentrations of between 15,200 and 99,300

pollen grains per cm, most notably a sequence of consecutive stratigraphic units from Test Pit 1/031 (Figure 2). Early Intermediate Period Nasca Phase 2/ 3 ceramic fragments from S.U. 76-80 cm pro­vide a rough time framework for this sequence. 
Grain size and other geomorphological analy­ses establish the 110 31 context sequence as aggrad­ing surfaces, above the ancient water table on the basin's western flank, upon which aeolian materi­als were deposited with progressively increasing energy by the unimodal Samaca wind regime (data which are in themselves highly suggestive of processes of gradual change across H-13; see Beresford-Jones et al. 2009). This location formed an effective trap for wind-borne pollen blown across H-13 and for entomophilous (insect­pollinated) taxa in its immediate vicinity, includ­ing Prosopis and most other riparian arboreal species (see Figure 6). It also limited the possibil­ities of nonlocal contamination: witness the minor percentages of exotic pollen in Figure 12. The sequence was eventually buried and sealed by graded sand aeolian deposits of the climbing dune. 
Figure 12 shows the pollen sequence from 1/031 compared with: (a) pollen preparations from the "footprint" layer 33-46 cm of Test Pit 1/030 asso-
