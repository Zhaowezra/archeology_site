method makes it virtually impossible to generate rep­resentative, meaningful settlement patterns from the site data. Second, research efforts targeted only those sites with monumental architecture (p. 111). This kind of bias simply promotes the antiquated view that Maya society is best understood by concentrating on the up­per tiers of the socioeconomic system. Finally, consid­erable variation occurs within site descriptions. Of course, sites differ in terms of size and structural com­plexity, but there appears to be no baseline for consis­tent data presentation. For example, individual struc­tures are described for some sites, while only mound counts are provided for other sites. Furthermore, 15 percent of the sites included in the report were never visited by members of the Rio Bravo project. Guderjan is aware of these limitations, although he remains "per­sonally comfortable" (p. 2) that research goals were satisfied. 
Chapters 6-8 include ancillary research projects. Ja­son Yaeger reports on "salvage" operations undertaken near the site of Gallon Jug. Fieldwork targeted a 202.5­ha area cleared and plowed by the Gallon Jug Agri­business. Yaeger notes that house floors and artifact scatters occur along ridge tops and hills, while low­lying areas were likely the loci of agricultural activities. 
In Chapter 7 Michael Linderman and coauthor Gud­erjan discuss chert procurement and consumption within the Rio Bravo study area, focusing primarily on La Milpa. A visual comparison of chert deposits around La Milpa with chert artifacts recovered from the site leads the authors to conclude that "adequate resources seem to have existed locally to supply the resident Maya population" (p. 97). In the following chapter Judy Cusick presents a summary of milpero activities within the Rio Bravo study area. Cusick discusses the schedule of mil pa preparation, planting, and harvest­ing, including information on plot size, length of use, and fallow cycles. 
Guderjan attempts to place the Rio Bravo settlement data in broader context in Chapter 9. The author uses a formula, based on such variables as number of ball courts, stelae, and courtyards at a site, to generate a site hierarchy within the region. According to these calculations, the Rio Bravo study area includes at least eight types of sites. A comparison between the Rio Bravo sites and those reported from the Peten and northern Belize indicates that the Rio Bravo contained the three highest-ranking sites in northern Belize and the largest, La Milpa, is comparable to the Peten sites of Rio Azul and Uaxactun. 
In Chapter 10 Guderjan summarizes the research and considers future directions and management ob­jectives. He notes that almost no area within the study region is devoid of evidence for Precolumbian activity and that the issue of "relevance" is not established a priori but is instead informed by the questions one asks. 
The appendix, contributed by Lana and Edel Ruise­co, outlines the use of high-contrast photography in documenting and interpreting the monuments from La Milpa. Examples of the results are included with the figures discussed in Chapter 2. 
The literature born ofCRM efforts is often a mixed bag. The reactive nature of management-related field­work can produce data collected in the absence of a well-conceived research agenda and can be weak on interpretation. On the other hand, many CRM reports excel in their emphasis on description and attention to detail. Unfortunately, Maya Settlement in Northwest­ern Belize is best exemplified by the former character­ization. While the volume certainly presents valuable information regarding some facets of Maya settlement, the quality of these data is highly variable and not easily meshed with the larger research issues of Maya ar­chaeology. Moreover, the nonsystematic nature of the settlement data significantly compromises their appli­cability. Finally, the auxiliary research reported by pro­ject personnel is a promising first step, but little more. 
This volume will find its audience among those in­
dividuals working within the immediate vicinity of the 
Rio Bravo study region. As such, the report fulfills the 
purpose set down in the introductory chapter. Given 
the limitations of the data base, however, it is not clear 
if management decisions will be well served by this 
information. The case can certainly be made that data 
publication is a fundamental obligation and that data 
poorly collected are still better than no data at all. Other 
readers may be unconvinced. If management-related 
literature such as Maya Settlement in Northwestern 
Belize can help resolve this thorny issue, it will have 
made a genuine contribution to Maya archaeology. 
ERRATUM 
In the December 1991 issue of the journal (Vol. 2, No. 4), an error was made in the caption for Figure 5 in the report, "Middle Preclassic Buildings and Burials at Cuello, Belize: 1990 Investigations," by Norman Ham­mond, Amanda Clarke, and Cynthia Robin. The correct caption for Figure 5 is, "Plans and orientations of Middle Preclassic burials excavated at Cuello in 1990. Note that part of Burial 152 is repeated on the plan of Burial 157 to show overlap." The editors regret any confusion this may have caused.
