LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 7, No. 2, 1996] 
country's colonial and prehistoric past. This interest led to what has become one of the finest collections of objects from these eras anywhere in the world. In a very poetic introduction to the book, Poli presents the history of his collection, culminating in its official gov­ernment registry whereby it is to remain in perpetuity an indissoluble resource for the Peruvian people. 
This registry notwithstanding, the author, Dr. Bonavia, has taken a bold step in writing the text for what is still a private collection. In recent years, pre­historians have found themselves divided over the issue of ancient objects in private collections or even in pub­lic museums. Indeed, some scholars refuse to consider such material as fit for serious study because of the usually illicit manner by which it was recovered. 
Most countries claim the material remains of their past as national patrimony and have laws prohibiting their unauthorized removal. Peru is no exception. Unfortunately, legality and patriotism aside, clandes­tine excavation of ancient artifacts and their sale on the international art market are facts of life in Peru as they are in many third-world countries. Other scholars, while deploring the unrecoverable loss of information that results from such activities, see a refusal to study this body of data as compounding the tragedy of its unscientific excavation. Clearly, Dr. Bonavia is in this latter camp. The publication of the Poli collection makes a strong case for this viewpoint. 
The book is laid out chronologically in seven chap­ters, using the Rowe-Lanning sequence of periods and horizons. Although the majority of the artifacts date between the eighth century B.C. through the ninth cen­tury A.D., Bonavia presents a comprehensive summary of Peruvian culture history from the Pleistocene through imperial Inka times. Although the text and cap­tions are entirely in Spanish, individuals with even lim­ited reading ability in the language will find the author's style straightforward and easy to follow but, at the same time, eloquent. 
Yet those with little or no Spanish should not dis­miss this work; the photographs alone constitute a valu­able resource. Luis Enrique Tord, who is responsible for the book's production, has done a superlative job in presenting 249 of the most important objects in the col­lection in large-scale color format. 
The importance of the objects, however, should not overshadow that of the written information. Bonavia's comprehensive text is the most balanced treatment of the Peruvian past currently available. The author is care­ful to point out many areas where thinking has changed in recent years and where differences in interpretation still exist. Furthermore, he stresses that future discover­ies will certainly alter aspects of his commentary. 
Nonetheless, with the author's caveat in mind, the 
reader should find the text quite useful. Less helpful, 
perhaps, are the captions for the illustrations. Bonavia 
has kept them brief and has tried to be as accurate as 
possible. However, the nature of collected artifacts ver­
sus excavated ones makes exact attributions difficult. A 
case in point concerns four gold trumpets in the Salinar 
style (Plate 140). These, Poli states, came from the 
archaeological site of Pacatnamu in the Jequetepeque 
Valley (p. 21), an attribution repeated in the caption (p. 
177). This provenience is almost certainly inaccurate. 
Twelve seasons of intensive archaeological excavations 
at Pacatnamu (1937-1939, 1952-1953, 1962-1963, 
1983-1987) revealed no Salinar material there whatso­
ever, and local lore consistently attributes the trumpets' 
origin to Balsar, a site on the southern margin of the 
valley. 
The inability to establish accurate provenience data for collected artifacts is practically inherent when deal­ing with such material, but it is not a universal condi­tion. Arguably, some of the most extraordinary objects in the Poli collection are from Sipan, an archaeological site in the Lambayeque Valley. Sipan's distinctive style has been established through archaeological excava­tions, which followed an episode of clandestine dig­ging. Poli estimates that he was able to retrieve 70 percent of those illicitly procured artifacts (p. 20). The opportunity to compare the two sets of Sipan objects has led to important cultural interpretations that would not have been possible otherwise (e.g., Alva and Donnan, Royal Tombs of Sipan, 1993). 
The publication of this extraordinary array of Prehispanic material from the Poli collection will afford other scholars new possibilities for amplifying our knowledge of the Peruvian past.

REVIEWS AND BOOK NOTES 
Tumatumani excavations, the text and accompanying illustrations place more emphasis on the analysis of ceramics and lithics from the site. On the whole, the work reflects the professionalism of a very competent project director, Charles Stanish of the Field Museum, as well as the excellent analytical work of Lee Steadman, ceramicist, and Matthew Seddon, lithic ana­lyst. The work of Steadman and Seddon, in particular, meets a high standard of data reporting for the archae­ology of the altiplano. 
The work consists of three parts. In the first, Stanish and Steadman provide a brief summary of the archae­ology from the Juli area. In 18 pages they provide back­ground to the Tumatumani data. They give a short culture history of the southwestern Titicaca Basin including the period of Tiwanaku cultural influence, subsequent development of the Lupaqa polity, and the invasion of the lnka empire at the end of the fourteenth century. Surveys by the Lupaqa Project, initiated by Stanish, determined Tumatumani to be a multicompo­nent site consisting of both a Sillumocco occupation (200 B.C. to A.D. 750, roughly equivalent to late Formative Tiwanaku through Tiwanaku IV) and a Tiwanaku occupation (A.D. 750-1100). Mapping and surface survey at Tumatumani revealed two mound structures-a square mound to the southwest and what may have been a U-shaped mound to the northeast. Relatively little material was recovered from the inter­vening area. 
The second part of the work provides a detailed analysis of ceramic and lithic data from the Tumatumani excavations. In this section, Steadman takes on the laborious task of describing in detail the ceramic assemblage from the site. To my knowledge, she provides the most detailed and precise descriptions of ceramic pastes and surface finishes available in the Tiwanaku literature. In particular, she deals admirably with plain and monochrome wares, often ignored by other researchers. It is unfortunate that given her pre­cise typology Steadman could define only three tempo­ral periods at Tumatumani-Early Sillumocco, Late Sillumocco, and Tiwanaku-reifying current gross chronological divisions rather than investigating rela­tionships between chronologically sensitive ceramic styles. Despite the limited temporal division, she aptly concludes that Sillumocco had a potting tradition influ­enced by, but independent from, those defined for Pukara, Chiripa, and Early Tiwanaku. 
Seddon's analysis of the lithics from the site com­
pletes Part 2 of the report. His analysis mirrors 
Steadman's, providing quantitative data for lithics 
types at the site. The description and analysis of lithic 
type and function is practical and critical but much less 
detailed than the work of Steadman. As Seddon notes, chronological analysis of the lithic material was limited by small sample sizes of diagnostic tools. For this rea­son, differences between the Sillumocco and Tiwanaku periods remain more suggestive than conclusive. 
In the final part of the book Stanish offers some brief conclusions based on the work at Tumatumani. He suggests that the most important results of the Tumatumani excavations and the Lupaqa Project sur­vey are the data supporting a revised view of the alti­plano Upper Formative (ca. 200 B.C. to A.D. 400). The data presented are convincing that the Titicaca Basin in the Upper Formative was not simply polarized between two or three great centers but existed as a much more complex web of influence, emulation, and social and political interaction. In this, he follows Steadman's work to its logical end. Unfortunately, his innovative conclusions stop at A.D. 400. 
Regrettably, Stanish's remaining conclusions are largely reiterations of a dogmatic and uncritical view of Tiwanaku culture popularized in recent publications (Bermann, Lukurmata: Household Archaeology in Prehispanic Bolivia, 1994; Goldstein, Latin American Antiquity 4:22-47, 1993; Kolata, The Tiwanaku: Portrait of an Andean Civilization, 1993). The Tumatumani research had the potential to test ideas about social and political complexity before and during the period ofTiwanaku influence. Unfortunately, rather than take up this challenge, Stanish, and to a lesser degree his students, have been content to assert as fact what should be tested through excavation and data analysis. These assertions, slipped innocuously into Part 1, include ideas of Tiwanaku as "empire" or "expansive state," ideas of "occupation" and "control" by culturally Tiwanaku people, the centralized control of an agromanagerial bureaucracy, and the cultural affiliation of mound building with Tiwanaku culture. Although aspects of these ideas have been investigated, they have yet to be demonstrated convincingly by inde­pendent lines of evidence to support each of these assertions. As such, Stanish's research takes its place in a long line of tantalizing, but less-than-satisfying inves­tigations of the Tiwanaku phenomena.
