biological anthropology that is woven into the epigraphic and archaeological record. The volume assesses the con­clusions of the original 1952 study without judgment and maintains an introspective stance on what evalua­tion the next generation of bioarchaeologists-with new theoretical and methodological frameworks for the study of the osteology and interment of Pakal-will have on the present work.

This volume presents the results of recent investigations into Maya ritual in cave contexts. Perhaps the central theme of the volume is that caves are religious contexts, and that the vast majority of archaeological data within caves represent the material remains of ritual activity. Following a brief introduction by Prufer and Brady, 18 chapters are organized into three sections, and present some of the most recent data on ancient Maya cave use. 
Section 1, "Sacred Landscape and Artificial Caves," examines the integration of caves as sacred locales within architectural groups. Topics include the integra­tion of natural cenotes and caves into the built environ­ment, the use of artificial caves that replicate the sacred landscape, and the control of access to caves as sources of social power. In addition, one of the contributors examines religious, rather than economic, aspects of settlement on Cozumel Island, through an examination of the role of caves and cenotes in the orientation of the site's ritual pilgrimage circuit. 
Section 2, ''Reconstructing Ritual and Cosmology;' examines a variety of ways in which the material remains of ritual action are manifested in cave contexts. Indi­vidual chapters discuss the use of caves as ritual sweat­baths, evidence of scribal pilgrimages to caves, and epigraphic and archaeological evidence of caves as a tar­get of deliberate desecration in ancient Maya warfare. Of particular interest are two chapters that examine the ritual use of cave formations (speleothems) outside of caves by documenting both the patterns of breakage and removal of speleothems within caves, as well as their distribution in surface archaeological contexts. 
Section 3, "Interpretations of Human Skeletal Mate­rial in Caves," presents current interpretations of oste­ological data from both caves and cenotes in the Maya lowlands. Chapters within this section discuss the intriguing possibility that rockshelters may have been a preferred location for burials among the ancient Maya. In addition, chapters examine bioarchaeological evi­dence for human sacrifice in caves, as well as the tapho­nomic processes involved in the deposition of osteological materials within cenotes. 
Prufer and Brady's edited volume is an important contribution to the small but growing body of literature on ancient Maya cave use. Although this volume is rel­evant primarily to Maya archaeologists, it is of broader relevance to all scholars interested in the study of reli­gion through the material remains of ritual activity.
