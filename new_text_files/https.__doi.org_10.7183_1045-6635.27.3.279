
DESIGN AND FUNCTION OF LOWE AND SAWMILL POINTS FROM 
THE PRECERAMIC PERIOD OF BELIZE 

W. James Stemp, Jaime J. Awe, Keith M. Prufer, and Christophe G.B. Helmke 
To date, 81 stemmed and barbed preceramic (Archaic) points (8000–900 B.C.) have been identified in Belize. Fifty­four areLowe points; 21 are Sawmill points. Four more are provisionally classified as Allspice and two as Ya’axche’points. Thesestemmed bifaces are frequently beveled on alternate­opposite edges and demonstrate variable degrees of resharpening andreworking, which affects blade shape and tool size. Numerous functions have been attributed to these artifacts; specifically,they have been called spear points, dart points, harpoons, and knives. Metric data from these bifaces, limited macrowearand microwear analyses, and design features, such as barbs and alternate­opposite edge beveling, have been used tointerpret likely tool functions. Results suggest that Lowe points were affixed to throwing/thrusting spears and also servedas knives, whereas the Sawmill points were used as spear­thrower dart points and as knives. New dating informationsuggests that alternate­opposite edge beveling and consequently beveled bifaces may be much older than 2500–1900 B.C.,which is the date currently assigned to these specimens.

Chipped Stone Points in
Archaic Mesoamerica 

Althoughourstudyfocusesonpointtypesidenti-fied in what is traditionally known as the LateArchaicperiodofBeli e,hunter-gatherersinotherregionsofMesoamericaproducedsimilarvarietiesof stemmed and barbed bifaces in the Preceramic period. Therefore, it is worthwhile briefly com-menting on sites with diagnosticArchaic chippedstone points in these regions. 
Mexico 
MacNeishetal.(1967)establishedoneofthefirstpreceramiclithictypologiesinMesoamericabasedon excavations in the Tehuacan Valley. Projectilepointtypes,includingCoxcatlan,Hidalgo,Lerma,Pedernales, and Tortugas, were used as chrono-logical markers to date levels and the timing ofoccupations at various sites. Hardy (1996) has sinceperformedareanalysisofasmallpercentageof the thousands of lithics recovered from the TehuacanValleyandfoundsignificantflawswiththe original analysis and subsequent typology.
In the Valley of Oaxaca, Flannery (1986) re-constructedEarlyArchaiclifebasedonexcavationsat Guila Naquit Cave. He recovered an assem-blageof1,716flakes,bifacialchoppers,macroflaketools, and bifaces, including Lerma and Trinidadpoints, as well as two Pedernales points (Hole1986). Evidence of Archaic-period occupation inthis valley also was discovered at Cueva BlancaandGheo-Shih.Intermsoflithictechnology,manyprojectile points of the Coxcatlan, Hidalgo, LaMina,SanNicolas,Tilapa,andTrinidadtypeswereidentified at Gheo-Shih (Flannery and Spores1983). At Cueva Blanca, Archaic-period levelsalsoyieldedpointtypeslikethosefromtheTehua-can Valley, including La Mina, San Nicolas,Trinidad, and Pedernales (Flannery and Spores1983). The rhyolite Xaag biface fragment is an-otherexampleofa “Pedernales”-likeArchaicpointfrom Oaxaca (Winter 2007:196–197, Figure 9.3).
In the Central Balsas region of Guerrero, ar-chaeologistsworkingintheXihuatoxtlarockshel-ter recovered modified river cobbles and other chipped stone tools and debitage in levels radio-carbon dated to the Archaic period. They alsofound a stemmed, indented base point fragmentthat they called Pedernales based on its similaritytoPedernalespointsfromGuilaNaquit inOaxacaandtheTehuacanValley(Ranereetal.2009:5017,Figure5A).Perttula(2009:73)notedthatthispointcame from a layer that is “at least 5,000 to 6,000years older than the known age of PedernalespointsfromTexas” andshouldbegivenadifferenttype name based on location of recovery and as-sociated time period.
In Michoacan,Archaic period occupation wasdocumentedinCuevadelosPortales.Atdifferent levelswithinthecave,thereareflakedtoolsmadefrom andesite and obsidian. Tools include heavychoppers,scrapers,gravers,blades,andnumerousstemmed point types, such as San Nicolas, Gary,Abasolo,Nogales,LaMina,Tortugas,andPeder-nales (Faug re 2006).

Los Tapiales, a Paleoindian campsite, also con-tainedasignificantArchaic-periodcomponent.Inaddition to the fluted-point base fragment and a“fluting” flake, there was an assemblage ofroughly1,400chippedstoneartifacts,mostlycon-sisting of basalt, obsidian, and chalcedony flaketools, as well as 14 biface fragments and a unifa-cial obsidian point (Gruhn and Bryan 1977).
From surface finds, Brown (1980) identifiedPalaeoindian and Archaic-period sites in theGuatemalanhighlandsbasedontwoPalaeoindianpoints and nine Archaic-period points, includingLerma, El Riego, Flacco, andAbasolo, The iden-tification of the Archaic-period points was basedonsimilaritieswiththetypesrecogni edbyMac-Neish in the Tehuacan Valley (Brown 1980:317–318, Figure 4).

Belize 
InadditiontotheTehuacanValley,MacNeishandNelken-Terner (1983a, 1983b) excavated sites innorthernBeli eanddevelopedapreceramiclithictypologythereas well.Theirstonetoolsequence,with some revision, included six phases or com-plexes(Lowe-ha,SandHill,OrangeWalk,Beli e,Melinda, and Progreso) that extended from about9000–2000B.C.andincludedpointformstermed“Lerma-like,” “Pedernales-like,” and “Shumla-like,” among others. Nevertheless, this analysisand categori ation of the diagnostic tool types innorthern Beli e suffered from some of the same problems as the Tehuacan Valley typology (seeHester1986:413).Giventheseissuesandthesub-sequentworkofHesteretal.(1980a,1980b,1995, 1996), Kelly (1993), and Iceland (1997, 2005),these phases, as well as the point type designa-tions, are no longer considered valid. 


Preceramic Points from Belize 
In Beli e, there are only seven confirmed points(Lohse 2006:214–216) from the Paleoindian pe-riod(ca.11,000–8000B.C.)andonepossiblepoint(Stemp et al. 2016) from the Paleoindian/EarlyArchaic (ca. 8000–6000 B.C.). In contrast, thereis abundant evidence of LateArchaic (3400–900B.C.) stone tool technology. In terms of bifacialpoints,Loweand Sawmill are the two main typesfromthistimeperiod,althoughtheremaybesomesub-variation in the Lowe type (see Stemp andAwe 2013:24, 26). A third provisional categoryof Allspice points has been suggested by Kelly(1993:216), and we propose a fourth provisionalpoint type named Ya’axche’. In this paper, wepresent quantitative and qualitative data for 54Lowe, 21 Sawmill, fourAllspice, and twoYa’ax-che’ points recovered throughout Beli e (Figure1, Table 1, Supplemental Tables 1–4).
Most of the preceramic points from Beli e aremade from chert that is heavily to completelypatinated.Bothoff-white/yellowishandhardwhitepatinashavebeenassociatedwithpointsrecoveredinnorthernBeli e.Nearlyallofthelesspatinatedbifaces were made from chert from the “chert-bearing one” [CBZ] of northern Beli e (seeLohse 2010; Lohse et al. 2006; Stemp and Awe2013). The Lowe point from Pulltrouser Swampwas made from chalcedony (Iceland 1997:194). 
Lowe Points 
Lowe points (Figure 2) are “characteri ed bybroadshoulders,oftenwithsharplydefinedbarbs;wide stems that are square or slightly expanding;and, occasionally, sub-parallel oblique flaking ontheir blades” (Lohse et al. 2006:217). Typically,their wide, straight-sided stems are ground alongthe edges from barb tip to barb tip (Kelly1993:210). The barb angles on most Lowe pointsarebetween45o–65o(Kelly1993:210;StempandAwe 2013:20, Table 1). They often possess pro-nouncedalternate-oppositebevelingonleftedgesand an off-white patina with a yellowish stain(Kelly 1993:210).

Ya’axche’Points 
Stemp andAwe (2013:28) posited that a point re-covered from the Bladen Nature Reserve was a new type based on the style and dimensions of itsstem. Following the recent discovery of a secondpointwithasimilarstem,weproposeanewprovi-sional type called Ya’axche’ in recognition of thegentlemenwhofoundthem—Mr.LeeMcLoughlinandMr.MaximilianoCaalfromtheYa’axch Con-servation Trust. Both points possess a short, wide,andexpanding“eared”stemwithabasalconcavity.Point stems are basally thinned on both faces butnot fluted. This stem style is somewhat similar tothose on points from El Gigante, Honduras (seeabove). The shapes of the blades differ due to thealternate-opposite edge beveling on one of them(Figure 3f) and minor edge resharpening on oneedgeofthesecond(Figure3g).Thebarbanglesofthepointsmeasure45o–55o.Bothoftheseartifacts are heavily patinated. 



Dating of Preceramic Points from Belize 
Although most of these bifaces are surface finds,there are three associated radiocarbon dates re-ported (2500–1900 cal B.C.) for Lowe points(Kelly 1993:215; Pohl et al. 1996:363, Table 1).Points without associated radiocarbon dates, in-cludingSawmillandAllspice,havebeenassignedto the Late Archaic period based on stylistic andtechnological similarities to the Lowe points, in-cluding stems, barbs, and corner-notching. LateArchaic points are frequently resharpened usinganalternate-oppositeedgebevelingtechniquethathas not been reported on any Paleoindian point (Lohseetal.2006)orPreclassic,Classic,orPost-classic Maya (ca. 1200 B.C.–A.D. 1500) bifacefrom Beli e (Hester 1985).
The current dating of beveled points from Be-li emayrequirerethinkingbecauseKeithPrufer’sproject recently recovered a point/knife fragmentwith alternate-opposite edge beveling in theToledoDistrictofSouthernBeli efromacontext associated with two radiocarbon dates spanning10,200–10,500 B.P. (Figure 4a). Despite the lackof a diagnostic base/stem on this point fragment,this discovery suggests that this type of bevelingmay have appeared earlier than currently thoughtinBeli e.Bywayofcomparison,alternate-oppo-site edge beveling on North American points isintroduced in the Late Paleoindian-EarlyArchaicperiod on Dalton points(8500–7500 B.C.). OtherEarlyArchaicpoints,includingHardaway-Dalton(8000–7000 B.C.), Hardin Barbed (8000–5500B.C.), and Thebes points (8000–6000 B.C.), arealso resharpened using this technique (Goodyear1982;Justice 1995). InsouthernTexasandnorth-ernMexico,alternate-oppositeedgebeveledlance-olate Lerma points and stemmed Bandy (Martin-dale),Bulverde,andAbasolopointsdatefromtheEarly to Middle Archaic period (ca. 8000–3000B.C.; Turner et al. 2011). The early date for thebiface fragment with alternate-opposite edgebeveling from southern Beli e also raises ques-tions concerning the gap in the current pointchronology of that country from roughly 9000 to2500 B.C. 
Although Sawmill points have been suggestedas examples of Late Archaic technology, no ra-diocarbondatesarecurrentlyassociatedwiththem.Kelly (1993:216) suggested they were youngerthan the Lowe and Allspice points based on theirdegree of patination. Given the early date associ-ated with the beveled tool from southern Beli e,we will break with tradition and refer to Lowe,Sawmill,Allspice,andYa’axche’pointssimplyas“preceramic” throughout the rest of this paper. 


Preceramic Biface Function: MetricAnalysis 
To determine the functions of preceramic bifacesfrom Beli e, we performed metric analyses forcomparison with hafted stone points in archaeo-logical and ethnographic collections from NorthandSouthAmericaandAustralia(Shea2006;Shott

Maximum Length, Width,Thickness, and Neck Width 
Lowe and Sawmill points differ in terms of bothoveralllengthandwidth.Forthosethatarewholeor almost whole, the mean maximum length andwidthforLowepointsare83.6mmand55.3mm,whereas Sawmill points average 68.3 mm longand 39.6 mm wide. The least damaged and re-worked/resharpened Lowe point is the JuaD/98/12/4 specimen, which is 96.5 mm longand 55.2 mm wide. The Actun T imin point,whichmeasures63.6mmlongand33.1mmwide,istheleastmodifiedwholeSawmillpoint.Neitherpoint is the largest of its type. Both points are ex-curvateinoutline,whichsuggeststhatthisislikelythe original shape of Lowe and Sawmill points.One of the excurvate point fragments withoutbevelingfromUit CahAkalconfirmsthis.
Lowe points are quite long (Table 1; Figure5a)whencomparedtoexamplesinThomas(1978)and Shott (1997). Nonetheless, the lengths ofmany Sawmill points overlap with those of theThomas (1978) and Shott (1997) hafted dartpoints, specifically within the 45–85 mm range.In this range, there is no statistically significantdifference in the lengths between the Sawmill vs.Thomas (1978) points (t = 1.9668, df = 10, p < 0.05) or Sawmill vs. Shott (1997) points (t = 1.7119, df =21, p <0.05) basedonWelch’s t-test.Whenalllengthsareincluded,thedifferencesbe-tween the Sawmill vs. Thomas (1978) points (t = 4.4867, df = 21, p < 0.05) and Sawmill vs. Shott (1997) points (t = 3.3296, df = 27, p < 0.05) aresignificant. Nevertheless, Cundy (1989) andHutchings(1997)demonstratethatdartpointscanvary in terms of their lengths and widths and thatsome dart tips are quite large. Some Australianaboriginejavelinsaretippedwithlongandnarrowstone, bone, and metal points (Cundy 1989:109–111, Figure 28; Newman and Moore 2013:2615,Figure 1, 2616:Figures 2–3).
In terms of the maximum widths, the LoweandSawmillpointsaresignificantlydifferentfromthe hafted dart points in Table 1. Lowe points aresubstantially wider than the hafted dart points,whereas the Sawmill points tend to overlap to aminimaldegreewiththeThomas(1978)andShott (1997) points (Figure 5b). One important func-tional aspect related to the width of points con-cerns depth of penetration. Wide points may notpenetrateasdeeplyasnarrowones,althoughforceuponimpactundoubtedlyaffectsthisrelationship(see Hrdlicka 2003; Whittaker 2010).
Measurementsofbifacethicknessindicatethat the Lowe points are much thicker than the haftedarchaeological examples (Shott 1997; Thomas1978). Although the mean thickness of theSawmillpointsislessthanthatoftheLowepoints,the Sawmill points are still thicker than theThomas (t = 3.0146; df = 7; p < 0.05) and Shott (t = 3.2551; df = 5; p < 0.05) points. Neither pointtype would be classed as a dart based on thesedata. 
Neckwidthmaybethemostimportantcriterionfor determining the function of a biface used as aprojectile because the width of the neck/stem isrelatedtothediameteroftheforeshaft/shaftoftheprojectile.Whencomparingthedataformaximumneckwidthforthehaftedspecimens(Table1,Fig-ure 6a), the Sawmill points overlap significantly,buttheLowepointsdonot.Thereisnosignificantdifference in neck widths between the Sawmill and Thomas (1978) points (t = 0.8574, df = 25, p<0.05)orShott(1997)points(t =0.3396, df =26, p <0.05).NeckwidthsupportsthesuggestionthatSawmill points could have served as dart points.
Corliss (1972:Table 1) provides some addi-tional support for Sawmill points as darts basedon neck widths that ranged from 0.93 cm to 1.28cm.YetmanydartpointneckwidthsinhisFigures4–7 exceeded 1.50 cm, and he omitted some ex-amples with necks that were wider (Corliss1972:14). Hutchings (1997:73) provided a widerrange for foreshaft diameters from NorthAmeri-canspear-throwers(0.6–1.9cm),andexperimentsinvolving the use of Clovis points on elephantsbyFrison(1989:769,Table2)includedlargerfore-shaftdiameters(13.9–22.2mm).Incontrast,meanhaft/foreshaft diameters of 20 mm (Shea2006:823–824),22mm(Huckell1982:219,Table1), 23 mm (Hughes 1998:355,Table III), and 24–25 mm (Gramly 1984:113) have been suggestedfor thrusting spears, which may provide supportfor the use of some (N = 7, 16.7 percent) Lowepoints as throwing/thrusting spear tips.

comparativedata.ThesecalculationsindicatethatSawmill points could have been dart points, butLowe points most likely were not. 
Tip Cross­Sectional Area (TCSA) 
The tip cross-sectional area (TCSA) of a pointhas been used to argue that some stone artifactswere likely used as projectiles of different types(i.e., arrow, spear-thrower dart, throwing spear)basedon “theforcenecessarytopenetrateatargetto a lethal depth” (Sisk and Shea 2011:2). TCSAofabifacialpointwitharhomboidalcross-sectionis calculated by multiplying half of its maximumwidth by its maximum thickness (Hughes1998:354, Table II; Sisk and Shea 2011:3, Figure1). Comparisons of the TCSAs from points inShea (2006:825, Table 1) with those for Loweand Sawmill points suggest that both of these bi-faces types are too wide and thick to have servedaseffectivedartpoints(Table1,Figure6b).More-over, Hughes’s (1998:356, Table IV) estimatedthreshold values for TCSAs for thrusting spears(310 mm2), flight spears (210 mm2), and dart points (67 mm2) indicate that Lowe and Sawmillpoints would not have been effective dart points.Nevertheless, 87.5 percent (N = 14) of the Lowepoints would have made serviceable thrustingspears, and 80 percent (N = 4) of the Sawmillpointswouldhavebeeneffectivethrowingspearsbased on these thresholds. The analysis of stoneprojectile points and knives from Australia byNewman and Moore (2013) demonstrates thatsome aboriginal peoples designed tools that didnot place significant emphasis on TCSA. Ameset al. (2010:298) also calculated that TCSA cor-rectly identified only 73 percent of Thomas’s(1978) and Shott’s (1997) dart points. 


Preceramic Biface Function: 
Macrowear and Microwear 

The possible functions of the Lowe and Sawmillpoints were also investigated based on use-wear,but a number of factors limited this analysis.Specifically,amoredetailedprogramofuse-wearanalysis was hampered by the fact that a signifi-cant number of points held in private collectionswere not accessible for examination. Macrowear and microwear analyses were also limited to asmall number of artifacts because the majority were recovered as surface finds.As a result, theyareheavilypatinatedandweresubjecttomultiplepost-depositional alterations.
Despite these issues, 27 points were examinedfor macrowear evidence that could indicate use as projectiles (Dockall 1997; Fischer et al. 1984;OdellandCowan1986;TitmusandWoods1986),and five points were examined for microwear,specifically striations and microscopic linear im-pact traces [MLITs] (Fischer et al. 1984). A 10xhand lens and a 10x–40x digital microscope [eS-cope]wereusedtodocumentthepresenceoflon-gitudinal macrofractures (bending, snap, cone,and “spin-off” fractures of the tip), lateralmacrofractures (“burin-like” fractures of the tip),distal/transverse fractures, distal end crushing,neck bending fractures, and barb shear fractures.The digital microscope was also used to locateand identify wear traces at 200x magnification.
Macrowearanalysisindicatedthatseven(35.0percent)of20Lowepointsandtwo(28.9percent)of seven Sawmill points retained evidence con-sistent with their use as projectiles. On the Lowepoints,macrowearwasrepresentedbylongitudinalfracturesonthedistal endsoffivepoints(Figures2c,d,4b,c,7a),atransversefractureononepoint(Figure2b),andalateralfractureonanother(Fig-ure 2k). The bending fracture on the distal end ofthe JuaD/98/12/4 point (Figure 7b) is also associ-atedwitharotarymotionbreak.Whetherthiswasdue to the impact of a spinning projectile with itstarget cannot be determined. Use-related damageon the Sawmill points included a neck bendingfracture (Figure 3c) and a barb shear fracture; nodamagewasobservedonthedistalendsofthear-tifacts, most likely due to resharpening.
Some fractures were discounted as resultingfrom projectile impact based on the difference instonecolorationoftheflakescar(s)resultingfromimpactandthesurroundingpatinatedtoolsurface.For example, we concluded that the tip fractureonthepointfromActunT imin(Lohse2010:326,Figure 6D) resulted from damage sustained post-patination. This approach was also used to dis-count the shear barb fractures on three Lowe points.Althoughweattributedthedistal/transversefracture on the JuaD98/12/2 point to projectileimpact, use-wear analysts have cautioned thatthese types of fractures may also be the productofmanufacture,accidentalbreakage,orotheruses

Prufer and W. J. Stemp). 
(Ahler 1971:58; Dockall 1997:326). In some in-stances,such asthe Lowepoint from San Ignacio(Iceland1997:192,Figure4.4b)andanotherfromLowe Ranch (Hester et al. 1980b:19, Figure 1),tool repair may have removed evidence of trans-verse breaks to the blades of the point.
Microwear evidenceconsistentwith projectileuse was recorded on two of five (40 percent) ofthe least patinated Lowe points. The Billy Whitepoint (Figure 7c) retained a microscopic linearimpacttrace(MLIT)belowthedistalendfracture.The Caves Branch Rockshelter point had bothweak linear polish below the distal tip break andmicropolish consistent with contact with bone(Figure 7d). Whether bone contact was due toprojectile use or butchery using the point as aknife cannot be determined based on available evidence. Distinguishing spear points from dartpoints based on this limited macrowear and mi-crowear dataset was not possible. Nevertheless,we believe tha there is sufficient evidence to sug-gest the use of some Lowe and Sawmill points asprojectiles. 


Preceramic Biface Function: Design Features 
Thefunctionsofthesepreceramicbifacescanalsobeapproachedfromtheperspectiveofdesignfea-tures, specifically large barbs, alternate-oppositeedge beveling, and edge serration. 
Barbs 
Barbs are common features on projectile points,but not all projectile points will necessarily havebarbs (Newman and Moore 2013). Barbs preventpointsfrombecomingdislodgedfromtheirtargets(Cundy1989:36;FlennikenandWilke1989:151).Becausethrustingspearsaredesignedtobeeasilywithdrawn from the target to allow additionalthrusts, they generally do not have barbs(Hughes1998:358). Thrusting spears could havebarbed points if the foreshaft was detachable and

would stay embedded in the animal (see Sullivan[1980] for repeating lances). In the absence of arepeatinglance,barbswouldseemtoargueagainstthe use of Lowe and Sawmill points asstabbing/thrustingtools.Nevertheless,thebarbingof points would be advantageous for huntingaquatic prey. Throughout coastal locations in theAmericas there are numerous examples of stoneand bone or ivory points with large rear-facingbarbs used as harpoons to hunt sea mammals andfish (Mason 1902). Relatedly, long (130 mm)metal harpoon heads were made by the Siona ofAma onian Ecuador for hunting manatee, largefreshwater fish, and caiman (Timm et al. 1989:2,Figure 1).
Chippedstonekniveswiththeiroriginalhandlesstill intact were not usually barbed (Hester 1970;Sollberger 1971; Willoughby 1902). In NorthAmerica, however, some barbed bifaces withouthandles were classified as knives based on use-wearanalyses.Thebespoints,whicharecommonlybeveled and have barbs, are often consideredknives based on the lack of damage associatedwith impact (White 2013:85). The barbs are out-flaring, and these points also possess wide stemsthat are generally the same width as the barbs(O’BrienandWood1998:134,Figure3.28;White2013:81, Figure 2) unlike Lowe and Sawmillpoints. 
Alternate­Opposite Edge Bevelingand Edge Serration 
Alternate-opposite edge beveling has been inter-preted as evidence of stone tool resharpening(Sollberger 1971). This resharpening techniquewouldhaveconservedrawmaterial and extended the use-life of a maintainable tool (Bleed 1986).Stone points were frequently rejuvenated whilestill hafted because retouching the point in the haft is much more time and energy efficient thanremovingandrehaftingit(Frison1978:125;Morse1971).
Preceramic points from Beli e may have beenused as knives based on their serrated edges andthe beveling of alternate-opposite tool edges duetoresharpening(seeBradley1997;FlennikenandWilke1989;Goodyear1974,1982:391;Sollberger1971). The interpretation of beveled and serratedbifaces as knives is primarily based on use-wearanalysis of NorthAmerican bifaces, such as Dal-ton, Thebes, and Hardin points (Justice 1995:51–56). Given the presence of wear associated withcutting or slicing of soft substances, such as meator hide (Ahler 1971; Michie 1973; Yerkes andGaertner 1997), Dalton points have been inter-pretedasknives.Nevertheless,thiskindofbevel-ing is not exclusive to stone tools used as knives.Resharpening of only one side of each edge mayhave been done for other reasons. Points mayhave been beveled on alternate-opposite edges toaffecttheaerodynamicsofflight,specificallysta-bility and rotation. There is evidence supportingthe rotation and stability hypotheses for beveledpointsonshort,straightshaftsusedinawindtun-nel (see Lipo et al. 2012). In contrast, Pettigrewet al. (2015:597) concluded that there was no re-lationship between beveled points and directionof rotation for longer projectiles with flexibleshafts based on their experiments using beveledandunbeveledpointsonspear-throwerdarts.Theyalsodemonstratethatstabili ationduetoalternate beveling seems unlikely, given the variation ob-served between throws. Additionally, Pettigrewetal.(2015:599)testedwhetheralternate-oppositeedge beveling would rotate a point upon impactwithitstarget,thuscreatingamoreseverewound.Although their results are inconclusive, they didobserve that beveled dart points can turn in a car-

cass. It may be that hunters beveled and serratedtheir stone dart points because they believed thatdoing so would increase their lethalness. 


Discussion 
If there was no projectile technology in the Pre-ceramicperiodofBeli e,hunterswouldhavebeenlimited to certain close-quarter hunting tactics,possibly involving disadvantage or ambush tech-niques (Churchill 1993:17; Rasic and Slobodina2008:82). In terms of the types of prey availabletoArchaic-periodhuntersinBeli e,therearelim-ited faunal data from this period. Pohl et al.(1996:363–364) “foundtheremainsoffreshwater fish (Cichlasoma sp., Ictalurus sp., Synbranchus sp.), snakes (Colubridae), small mammals such as armadillo (Dasypus novemcinctus), and espe-ciallyturtles(Staurotypus sp.)” inassociationwith theLowepointfromPulltrouserSwampinnorth-ern Beli e. Lohse (2010:323, Table 1) recoveredthe remains of common agouti (Dasyprocta), ar-madillo, snakes, and possibly white-tailed deer(Artiodactyl)fromLateArchaiccontextsinActunHalal in Western Beli e. This evidence suggestsa diet that included both aquatic and terrestrialanimals of various types and si es, in addition toplant foods (see Iceland and Hester 2001:293;Pohl et al. 1996).
Based on the limited use-wear analysis for theLowe and Sawmill points, it can be argued thatsome of these bifaces served as projectile points.Metric data suggest that they were designed toserve different functions (Rasic and Slobodina2008; White 2013:74–75 for function vs. style).Because the neck widths of Lowe and Sawmill points are significantly different, each type wasdesigned to fit into a handle/shaft of different di-ameters.Basedonneckwidths,Lowepointsseemto have been designed as heavy armatures slottedintothickerhandlesorshafts/foreshafts.TheirTC-SAs indicate their use as thrusting spears. Al-though the large barbs would seem to contradictthis, Lowe points may have made effective har-poons by preventing aquatic prey from slippingfrom the point. The Sawmill points seem betterdesigned as dart points, given their neck widthsand the 45–85 cm range of length measurements.Moreover, confidence intervals (CI) calculatedbased on the four dimensions from the Sawmill points support their likely use on spear-throwerdarts.YetthelimitednumberofTCSAscalculated for the Sawmill points do not support this pro-posed function.
Both point types also likely made serviceableknives.Thiscouldbeaccomplishediftheforeshaftwas removed and held in the hand as a hafted knife (Rasic and Slobodina 2008:79). Not onlywould the wider shoulders of the preceramicpoints provide broader blades for opening largerwounds when used as projectiles (Flenniken andWilke 1989:151), they would produce long ser-rated edges for cutting and sawing (Goodyear1974;RasicandSlobodina2008).UsingSawmilland Lowe points as both projectile points andknives would have minimi ed the need for addi-tional formal tools in the toolkits of preceramicpeoples who inhabited Beli e. Because metricdatasuggestthatLoweandSawmill points repre-sent two different types of tools, this might indi-cate different strategies or prey for those hunterswho used one or the other (see Churchill 1993;Ellis 1997; Hrdlicka 2003; Hughes 1998; Shott1993;Whittaker2010forspeed,thrust/forceuponimpact, range, hide thickness/penetration depth,woundsi e,andenvironments).Itisalsopossiblethat Lowe points hafted onto thrusting/throwingspearsor harpoons were used inconjunctionwithSawmill dart points to finish off wounded prey(Hughes1998:395;RasicandSlobodina2008:82;see Cundy 1989; Ellis 1997).
Geographically, Lowe and Sawmill points arequite widely distributed and overlap significantlyin northern, central, and western Beli e. Basedon the locations where Lowe and Sawmill pointshavebeenfound,itseemsunlikelythatthesepointtypes can be used as ethnic markers for culturallydistinct preceramic populations that exclusivelyinhabiteddifferentpartsofBeli e.Thesuggestionthat any one group of hunter-gatherers identifiedby point type was culturally connected to the ear-liestregionalMayapotterytraditions,suchasCu-nil and Swa ey (Awe 1992:344–350; Clark andCheetham2002:306),isnotsupported(seeLohse2010:315–318, 342; Rosenswig 2015:138). Thechert assemblages associated with the earliest ce-ramics in western Beli e and eastern Guatemala,for example, consist ofcoreand flaketechnologyand do not demonstrate any evidence of bifaceproduction (Aoyama 2010;Aoyama and Munson

2012;Stemp2012;Yacubic2006).Moreover,Ice-land (1997; Lohse et al. 2006:222) noted a hiatusin the artifact record in northern Beli e between roughly 1900–1300 B.C. This divides the lithictechnologyoftheLateArchaicintotheEarlyPre-ceramic facet (3400–1900 B.C.), to which Lowepoints are currently assigned, and the Late Prece-ramic facet (1500–900 B.C.). Even if the 2500–1900 B.C. dates for Lowe points are accepted asapplying to all stemmed and barbed point types,conventional glottochronology suggests that thespeakers of proto-Maya lived sometime between4000and3500B.P.(BrownandWichmann2004;Kaufman 1976). Alternate models stipulate thedates around 6500 to 6000 B.P. for the branchingof Wastek from proto-Mayan (Atkinson 2006),and more recent proposals push the dates to theother extreme, to 2200 B.P. using automated lex-ical comparisons (Holman et al. 2011). As such,anysubstantiationofculturalcontinuitiesthatex-tended from the Early Preceramic facet of theLate Archaic into the earliest Maya times neces-sitates a more detailed chronological frameworkforthepreceramicpointsinrelationtootherlithictechnology, material culture, and linguistics. 


Conclusions 
Amultitudeoffactors,climaticandenvironmentalamongthem(Rosenswig2015),likelycontributedto a longer reliance on mobile hunting and gath-ering for preceramic peoples in Beli e than forthose living in other regions in Mesoamericawhere more permanent sedentism and food-pro-duction developed earlier (e.g., Blake et al. 1995;Cheetham and Clark 2002; Iceland and Hester2001; Lohse 2010; MacNeish and Nelken-Terner1983a; Rosenswig 2006a, 2006b, 2015; Zeitlinand Zeitlin 2000). There is still much we do notknow about the preceramic people who lived inBeli e; diligent work and fortuitous finds haveincreased our knowledge of this time period andprovided a better sense of how its inhabitants de-signedandusedtheirstonetools.Forhuntingandgathering populations, the need for reliable hunt-ing tools was paramount. Tools likely also had tobe maintained with relative ease, and using a toolfor more than one purpose as need arose wouldplace a premium on portable, multi-purpose ones(Bleed 1986). 
If Sawmill points were dart points and knives,whereas the larger Lowe points were affixed tothrusting/throwing spears or harpoons and werealso used as knives, this may account for overlapintheirregionaldistributions.Becauseofthelargebarbs on both types of points, these tools mayhavebeenusedtohuntaquaticmammals,reptiles,and fish. Spears and darts may not necessarilyhave been used for the same prey. Whether thesetwo biface types were contemporaneous cannotbe known based on the limited dating evidence.The early exampleofbeveling from southernBe-li e raises the possibility that tools with bevelingon alternate-opposite edges are older in this partoftheworldthantheLateArchaicperiodrequiringrevision of the current preceramic chronology(e.g., Lohse et al. 2006:222, Figure 8).
