DIFFICULTIES IN REJECTING A LOCAL ANCESTRY WITH mtDNA 
HAPLOGROUP DATA IN THE SOUTH-CENTRAL ANDES 

Cecil M. Lewis Jr. 
This study assesses whether local genetic drift within populations can be rejected as a sufficient explanation for mitochon­drial DNA haplogroup frequency changes between contemporary and prehistoric population samples in the South-Central Andes. Differences in the frequencies of haplogroups between populations are a popular line of evidencefor assessing pop­ulation history. The null hypothesis ofhaplogroup frequency change is a stochastic force inherent to finite populations called genetic drift. Genetic drift is particularly influential in small populations. Innumerable historical events can result in low population sizes, and the simplest scenarios for these events are those occurring locally. Jn this study, simulations are used to provide a baseline for the amount of haplogroup-frequency difference 
expected from local genetic drift over time. The results from the simulations are compared to observed data from 23 population samples, including six prehistoric popula­tion samples. The study concludes that local genetic drift cannot be rejected when comparing a prehistoric population to a contemporary population. For the South-Central Andes, these results have dire consequences when attempting to infer genetic exchange. This study demonstrates that more informative genetic data are required for such inferences.

each local population reproducing and spawning the next generation. If we are unable to reject this null hypothesis, than our genetic data are uninfor­mative of more complex historical scenarios, such as genetic exchange. Even when we are certain, intuitively, of a region's complex history, if we are unable to reject this null hypothesis, then our genetic data provide no compelling evidence for this complex history. 
This study uses simulations to assess the null hypothesis of haplogroup frequency change in the South-Central Andes. The null hypothesis is that a few generations of isolation during periods of lower population size can explain haplogroup frequency differences between South-Central Andean popu­lations. The results from the simulations are com­pared to prehistoric estimates of population sizes inferred from traditional archaeological sources. The aim is to determine whether haplogroup data can provide information regarding complex popu­lation dynamics in the South-Central Andes. 
Background 
In humans, the mitochondrial genome is a sequence of DNA of approximately 16.5 thousand base pair units in length. While all mitochondrial genomes are descended from a common ancestor, the mito­chondrial genomes diverge from each other by mutation events in the DNA sequences. A mito­chondrial haplogroup refers to a major lineage of these diverged genomes. An individual will belong to one of these haplogroups. Mitochondria have a strict maternal inheritance, thus an offspring, whether male or female, will belong to the same mitochondrial haplogroup as the mother. 
A pair of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences from the same haplogroup will share more common variation than a pair of mtDNA sequences from different hap lo groups. If we trace the history of mtDNA back in time, then a pair of mtDNA sequences from the same haplogroup is expected to coalesce to a common ancestral sequence prior to a pair of mtD NA sequences from two different haplogroups. The majority of Native American mtDNA variation falls within five hap­logroups that have been named A, B, C, D, and X. Haplogroup X has yet to be found in South Amer­ica (Dornelles et al. 2005). Studies estimate that mtDNA sequences within these common Native American haplogroups coalesce prior to the peo­pling of the Americas, while mtDNA sequences between these major haplogroups coalesce to a common ancestor roughly I 00 thousand years ago (Bonatto and Salzano I 997; Gonder et al. 2007; Kemp et al. 2007; Silva et al. 2002). 
In the average human cell, mitochondrial genomes are present in thousands of copies, pro­viding a better chance of DNA preservation when compared to nuclear DNA. The most commonly determined molecular genetic datum retrieved from a prehistoric skeleton is the mitochondrial hap­logroup. While DNA sequence data can provide the necessary information to determine a haplogroup, there are also laboratory shortcuts for determining a haplogroup that do not require DNA sequencing. As a result, haplogroup data can be cheaper, faster, and easier to collect than DNA sequence data. 
When prehistoric samples have limited DNA preservation, mitochondrial haplogroup data are frequently the only type of genetic information retrieved. However, a study restricted to mito­chondrial haplogroups provides very limited infor­mation about the structure of genetic variation within and between populations. Each haplogroup is mutually exclusive. As with any data set, four mutually exclusive variants can provide only three independent observations. In essence, Native American haplogroup data provide only as much information as a single genetic locus with four com­mon alleles (alleles refer to variant forms of a genetic locus). 
To assess the genetic relationships of popula­tions, random samples of individuals are examined from the populations, and each sampled individual is typed for his or her respective haplogroup. The similarity or difference of these haplogroup fre­quencies within and between populations provides a basis for assessing genetic relationships. Within a specific geographic region, changes in haplogroup frequencies can assess the temporal continuity of genetic relationships for the local populations har­bored within the region. The objective then is to explain why hap lo group frequencies between pop­ulation samples are the same or different. 
Within local populations, the null hypothesis that explains the change in mitochondrial hap­logroup frequencies is an evolutionary stochastic process inherent to any reproducing population of finite size. Offspring replacing their parents, gen-

eration after generation, results in a sampling effect, as haplogroups from the previous generation are resampled by the act of mating and the creation of the new generation. This sampling effect results in fluctuating or drifting changes in haplogroup fre­quencies within the population over time. This genetic drift serves as the simplest explanation for changes in haplogroup frequencies because the sto­chastic effect of drift is acting on all genetic loci within all populations of finite size regardless of other evolutionary forces. The expected degree to which this force changes haplogroup frequencies over time is inversely proportional to the popula­tion size. This stochastic force can have a minimal impact on haplogroup frequencies within larger populations, while in smaller populations the impact can be great. 
Two types of historical events lead to periods of reduced population size: bottlenecks and founder effects. These events lead to periods in which genetic drift can result in radical changes in hap­logroup frequencies in relatively short periods of time. A bottleneck is a drop in population size that occurs locally. Examples of a bottleneck include a drop in local population size from an environmen­tal catastrophe, disease, or overexploitation of sub­sistence resources. A founder effect refers to the establishment of a new population carrying a small fraction of the variation from a larger population. An example of a founder effect would be the ini­tial migration( s) into the Americas from Asia. The founding population in the Americas harbored a small subset of the genetic variation found in Asia (Hey 2005). 
Considering the effects of bottlenecks, a popu­lation at different periods in time may differ in hap­logroup frequencies without any influences from outside the population and without any influence from other evolutionary forces. The only require­ment is that this population is of a finite size. For these reasons, genetic drift within a local popula­tion serves as the null hypothesis for explaining dif­ferences in haplogroup frequencies from population samples taken from the same location but from different temporal periods. This is in con­trast to alternative hypotheses, such as population replacements, genetic exchanges between popula­tions, or natural selection within populations. These alternative hypotheses, while not mutually exclu­sive, assert a more complex historical scenario. Before these more complex historical scenarios are favored, genetic drift occurring locally should be adequately rejected as a sufficient explanation for observed haplogroup frequencies. This is not to say that these alternative hypotheses are incorrect or poor. In fact, it may simply mean that the data cannot provide the necessary information to ade­quately evaluate more complex models. 
Other Forces of Evolution 
Because of the ancient coalescence of haplogroups, mutation has an inconsequential effect on South­Central Andean haplogroup frequencies. With regard to haplogroup data in the South-Central Andes, a Jack of differentiation between popula­tions would be most simply explained by the reten­tion of large population sizes since separating from a common ancestral population. Gene flow would be an alternative hypothesis, which may be favored. particularly if population sizes were too small to account for the lack of differentiation. 
The human mitochondrial genome is nonre­combining. For this reason, the mitochondrial genome evolves as a single genetic locus. At posi­tions within the mitochondrial genome, the vari­ants that determine haplogroups are assumed to be selectively neutral. However, natural selection may influence functional variants at other posi­tions. For example, the mitochondrial genome con­
tains numerous genes that are involved in aspects of cellular metabolism. In fact, 80 percent of the mitochondrial genome is functional (www.mito­map.org). Because there is no recombination, a functional variant under natural selection and the neutral variant that is diagnostic of haplogroups will evolve together. This hitchhiking effect influ­ences mitochondrial haplogroups in two ways: one, it may lead to nonrandom changes in hap­logroup frequencies within a population (Mishmar et al. 2003); two, it may lead to more drastic ran­dom changes in haplogroup frequencies than is expected from neutral genetic drift (Gillespie 2000). The degree to which natural selection influ­ences mitochondrial variation between popula­tions remains a matter of debate (Kivisild et al. 2006). Much like gene flow, effectively modeling natural selection requires a demonstration that the observed similarities and differences in genetic

variation cannot be effectively explained by 
genetic drift alone. 
Mitochondrial Haplogroups Treated as Alleles of a Single Locus 
Given certain assumptions, there can be statistical criteria for rejecting genetic drift as a sufficient explanation for haplogroup frequency change. Con­sider a scenario in which each individual in a pop­ulation of N1 potential mothers belongs to one of these four haplogroups. In this sense, we can con­sider N1 the breeding population, as mtDNA has a strict maternal inheritance. Consider a model of evolution in which each mother has an equal chance of reproducing; each generation produces a new population of N1potential mothers; each generation is nonoverlapping; and each generation is formed by a random sampling, with replacement, of the previous generation, which simulates the process of random mating. This is known as the Fisher-Wright population model. Since each mother can be iden­tified as one of the four haplogroups, the count of N1in haplogroups A, B, C, and Din generation t1 is a random sample with replacement of the count of N1haplogroups from generation t. It is likely that in each generation, the counts or frequencies of the four haplogroups within the N1population will randomly drift from this serial random sampling. It is intuitive that more robust changes in mitochondrial hap­logroup frequencies occur whenN1is small because it reflects a smaller sampling. 
To avoid confusion, it is important to clarify that the breeding population noted above can be easily mistaken for the population genetics concept called 
effective
population (Ne). Ne, in population genet­ics, refers to the number of breeding individuals in an idealized population that is in a state of equi­librium between drift and mutation. It is determined by the allele frequencies or inbreeding coefficients. Ne does not apply to this study. 

Because mitochondrial haplogroups are mutu­ally exclusive, haplogroups evolve as variant alle­les of a genetic locus, with the genetic locus being the mitochondrial genome. Assuming no other influences, in time, a haplogroup will reach an absorption state in which the haplogroup will be lost (reach a .0 frequency) or fixed (reach 1.0 fre­quency) in a local population solely from genetic drift. The probability that any haplogroup reaches fixation is equal to its current frequency within Nr (Gillespie 2004). 
Because haplogroup data are categorical, con­tingency table tests can assess the relative relation­ships of haplogroup frequencies between population samples. For example, the relationships between genetic population structure and x2 contingency table tests have been discussed previously (Work­man and Niswander 1970). The null hypothesis (H0) for this test statistic proposes that the proportions of the haplogroups within the two observed sam­ples are no different than those expected from two samples of similar sizes drawn from the same pop­ulation. With respect to samples from two different local populations, the H0 is that the two populations are genetically unstructured or undifferentiated. 
Given the information above, two populations separated in time, but not in space, are treated as if they have a direct ancestor-descendant relation­ship until it can be demonstrated that the genetic differences between them cannot be sufficiently explained by local genetic drift. The degree to which haplogroup change is expected to occur from in situ drift can be determined by simulations; the simulated data can be analyzed by contingency table tests. 
Because the effect of genetic drift is inversely proportional to the population size, the objective of this study relies on accurate estimates of pre­historic population sizes. Estimates of demographic parameters for prehistoric communities are a fre­quent objective in archaeology. Not only do the esti­mates for these parameters provide a foundation for traditional archaeological science, but these para­meters provide a foundation for explaining the pat­tern of genetic variation within and among populations. 
There is a qualitative criterion for rejecting genetic drift. For example, genetic drift cannot gen­erate new variants within a regional population. The influx of new variation can only be explained by other evolutionary processes. For example, a population without haplogroup A would not be able to gain this haplogroup by genetic drift. Such a gain would be best explained by a genetic exchange with, or replacement by, a population harboring this haplogroup. In this study, all prehistoric pop­ulations harbored all four haplogroups. Thus, this qualitative criterion does not apply.
