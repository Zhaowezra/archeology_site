URNS, BOWLS, AND OLLAS: POTTERY-MAKING PRACTICES AND

Guillermo A. De La Fuente 
This paper presents studies and discussions of pottery-making practices during the Late period (ca. A.D. 900-1450) in Northwestern Argentina. It stems from an extensive archaeological research project carried out in the middle self or of the Abauccin Valley, Province of Catamarca, Argentina. Pottery production during this period is evaluated through the study of 
technological choices and technical identity, as well as its relationship to the technical behaviors developed by potters. The analysis of a large sample of ceramic sherds, complete vessels, and overfired sherds indicates that the potters produced a very narrow repertoire of ceramic forms (bowls, urns, and ollas) using local raw materials and technology, the latter with a strong hold in the area. Pottery production during the Late period was carried out in household contexts, becoming increas­ingly intensified and concentrated with the appearance of Inkas in the region. Additionally, some ideas are discussed con­cerning the technological choices of ancient potters during this period, and the implications for technological studies in archaeological ceramics. 
En este trabajo las prcicticas alfareras desarrolladas por los alfareros antiguos durante el perfodo Tardio (ca. 900-1450 d.C.) en el noroeste argentino son estudiadas y discutidas a traves de una investigaci6n arqueol6gica extensiva llevada a cabo en el sector medio del Valle de Abauccin, Provincia de Catamarca, Argentina. La producci6n de a(fareria para este perfodo es evaluada a traves de las nociones de elecciones tecnol6gicas e identidad tecnica y su relaci6n con el comportamiento tecnico desarrollado por los alfareros. El ancilisis de una gran muestra de fragmentos cercimicos, vasijas comp/etas y fragmentos con evidencias de sobrecocci6n permiti6 establecer que los alfareros produjeron un repertorio reducido de formas ceramicas (pucos, urnas y ollas) utilizando una tecnologfa conservativa y local a traves de! tiempo con caracteristicas bien definidas, en donde mayoritariamente se utilizaron materias primas cercimicas locales. La producci6n de alfareria durante el periodo Tardio puede ser interpretada como una producci6n a escala domestica con una creciente intensificaci6n y concentraci6n geogrcifica que se acrecienta con la entrada de los lnkas en la region. Adicionalmente, se presentan y discuten algunas ideas relacionadas con las elecciones tecnol6gicas realizadas por los alfareros durante este periodo y sus implicancias para los estudios arque­ol6gicos de tecnologia cercimica. 
tudies of ceramic production organization in not always been mutually exclusive in terms of the­Sarchaeological contexts have been developed oretical and methodological concerns, they by many researchers using a number of dif­explored and evaluated different aspects of orga­ferent approaches (Arnold 1971, 1975, 1985, 1991, nization and scale of ceramic production in several 1993, 1994, 2000, 2005; Bishop and Neff 1989; geographic and cultural contexts, as well as in eth­Blackman et al. 1993; Costin 1991; Costin and noarchaeological and archaeological contexts (Rice Hagstrum 1995; Gosselain 1992, 1999, 2000; Gos­1981, 1991; Rye 1981; cf.

mental factors of craft production activity relate to broader models of cultural dynamics in which craft, economic, social, and reproductive practices are embedded in society. The archaeological record of pottery production therefore is multidimensional and can be explored through different scales of res­olution. Thus the interpretations of past human behavior based only on compositional data, be it mineralogical or chemical, are far from simple interpretations of ceramic pastes; they cannot rest exclusively on direct comparisons between the chemical or mineralogical data obtained from ceramic pastes, nor the geological contexts of ceramic raw materials (Arnold 2000, 2005). As was pointed out by Arnold (2005), the link between ceramic compositional analyses (mineralogical or chemical) and the constituent ceramic raw materi­als (clays and tempers) is behaviorly complex and results from natural and cultural variables. 
This paper examines the pottery-making prac­tices developed by potters during the Late period (ca. A.O. 900-1450) in the middle sector of the Abauc:in Valley (Dept. of Tinogasta, Province of Catamarca, Northwestern Argentine region) by identifying technological choices in ceramic man­ufacturing. One key theoretical concept to under­standing such technological choices is the chafne operatoire (operational sequence), originally devel­oped by Andre Leroi-Gourhan (1943, 1945, 1964, 1965) and revisited by others such as Pierre Lem­monier in his "anthropology of technology" (Lem­monier 1986, 1992; see also Sellet 1993). A second goal here is to outline technical behaviors per­formed by potters in the past, in order to evaluate "technical identity" in pottery-making societies (Gosselain 1992, 1999; Gosselain and Livingstone­Smith 2005; see also Lemmonier 1992; Leroi­Gourhan 1964, 1965). 
The first part of this paper presents the theoret­ical framework guiding this research, and pays spe­cial attention to key methodological concepts developed by Leroi-Gourhan (1943, 1945, 1964, 1965) emphazising the technical behavior in pot­tery-making societies. The next two sections explain the context of the Late period in North­western Argentina and describe the Batungasta archaeological site as a ceramic production center. The fourth section briefly details the main charac­teristics of pottery production organization during the Late period at the Batungasta site. The fifth sec­tion presents and discusses the more important results from dimensional standardization and craft specialization studies focusing on ceramic manu­facture during the Late period. The next section deals with the technical choices in paste all.d form­ing techniques made by potters in the past. Finally, the last section discusses the particular case of pot­tery tradition and craft development in the Late period at Abaucan Valley, building on the position that pottery-making practices are integral to, and an active part of, social practices, upon which a society builds its social identity. 
Chaine Operatoire: A Conceptual Frame­work for the Study of Technical Identity 
The term chaine operatoire was originally defined by AndreLeroi-Gourhan (1943, 1945, 1964, 1965); it defines the sequential nature of bodily actions as one goes about daily repetitive technological activ­ities (see discussion in Desrosiers 1991; Dobres 2000; Edmonds 1990; Lemonnier 1992; Schlanger 1994). As originally proposed, the concept was strongly influenced by the ideas Mauss proposed in his seminal work Les techniques du corps; he saw technology as a "total social fact," and focused his attention on understanding how bodily move­ments reflected, and at the same time were condi­tioned by, social tradition (Mauss 1934; see also Dobres 2000). In exploring the link between the physical and social body, Mauss explained that even the apparently natural body actions were, in fact, learned through primary socialization of the individual. Thus, material transformation of natural resources into cultural products through sequential physical actions, were choices-technological choices-made among alternatives that in their very enactment, and whether intended or not, expressed ethnic, gender, age, and personal iden­tities (Mauss 1934; see Dobres [2000] and Schlanger [1998] for an excellent discussion of these topics). This means that, as part of technolo­gies, sequential physical actions on matter are part of a cultural mileu, and they embody what Leroi­Gourhan (1964, 1965) called "social memories." 
As Dobres (2000) has pointed out, much of the recent use of the chafne operatoire term refers only to the technical chain of sequential material operations by which natural resources are acquired and physically transformed into cultural com-

modities (e.g., Creswell 1983; Delaporte 1991; Sellet 1993). Two other concepts deserve our atten­tion, namely "technical gestures" and "technical identity." Technical gestures are the corporeal basis of the bodily engagement with the material and social conditions of their productive activities (Leroi-Gourhan 1964, 1965). Physical interaction with the material world is accomplished through technical gestures, and this transforms matter through action into cultural products that, in tum, leave physical marks that the archaeologist can identify. Most importantly, technical gestures are embodied, mediated, meaningful, and collective practices (Dobres 2000).1 
On the other hand, while not developed by Leroi-Gourhan, the concept of technical identity is a wider and more inclusive concept; it focuses on technical gestures and chaines operatoires dis­played by ancient technicians. I prefer to define and understand technical identity as a final expression of technical practices by ancient technicians (see Gosselain and Livingstone-Smith [2005] for dis­cussion). Ancient technicians mediate their under­standing of physical and social conditions through the lens of cultural reason and through the embod­ied knowledge and skill that derives from the habi­tus of technological practice (Bourdieu 2007; Mauss 1934 ). During their physical existence, peo­ple navigate social conventions regarding the right and wrong ways to make and use material objects, thus navigating a generative identity process. 
Technical Identity and Technical Behavior in 
Pottery-Making Practices 
In his ethnoarchaeological research, Dean Arnold (1971, 1975, 1985, 1991, 1993, 2000,2005) pro­posed and developed several concepts in order to identify and explain the main causes of variability in ceramic paste composition, as well as the way in which such variability relates to the behavior of potters, and its role in the organization of ceramic production in a given society. One of the most use­ful concepts is the term "community of potters" (Arnold 2000, 2005: 16-17). The notion of a "com­munity of potters" refers to the social unit of pro­duction in which members interact more frequently than with members from others communities of potters. Due to their social interaction within a com­munity, they also share common "decision making trees" concerning the different steps in the techno­logical process of ceramic vessel manufacture, e.g., design structures, forms, and function (Arnold 1975, 1985, 1993). In this way, they generate a greater cohesion and a lower level of variability in pottery production within their own community (Arnold 1993:140-187, 2000, 2005). However, Arnold (2005) has observed high variability in the behaviors involved in the selection of ceramic raw materials and preparation of ceramic pastes; they are rather unstable and are broadly governed by a number of factors such as geology, individual per­ceptions of ceramic raw materials, religious beliefs, intended use of vessels, and techniques involved in the remainder of the manufacturing process. 

Sillar (2000b ), with a similar approach, observed very well defined forms in the produc­tion process of pottery in several communities in the South-Central Andes (Peru and Bolivia), where the production of pottery is surprisingly consistent in terms of technique and organization of produc­tion (local traditions). His approach is somewhat different from that of Arnold, in that he empha­sized understanding "technical choices" (Lem­monier 1992, 1993; van der Leeuw 1993) made by potters in different stages of the pottery pro­duction process and their vital importance in the social reproduction of pottery communities (Sil­lar 1988, 2000a, 2000b ). 
Technical choices of potters during the stages of the pottery production process are visualized as cultural choices, in which a technological tra­dition is reproduced on a daily basis through the repetition of a series of technical acts, and par­tially maintained through time and space by the way the specific technologies are embedded into wider social and technical practices in the social life of these communities (Lemmonier 1993; Sil­lar 2000a). 
Gosselain (1999) and Gosselain and Living­stone-Smith (2005) broadened the scope in their intercultural study, carried out in Sub-Saharan Africa with more than l 000 potters from many dif­ferent countries, in which they explore the mech­anisms of procurement and processing of ceramic raw materials. Through the study of the wider social aspects governing this craft activity, they attempted to understand the technical behavior of potters in a more dynamic and realistic way. One of the most important conclusions derived from this work is that the current patterns of selection and process-

ing of ceramic raw materials do not depend, nor are determined, by geographical distance to the sources, geology, or the use intended for the ves­sel, but instead by the way in which pottery prac­tices configure themselves over time and space. In other words, the strategies of selection and pro­cessing of clays for ceramic manufacture involve broader economic, technical, social, and symbolic aspects of society (Gosselain and Livingstone­Smith 2005). Thus, tradition, techno-functional constraints, relationships with other scopes of social activities, and symbolic conceptions play an impor­tant role charting the underlying logic in these local practices and representations. The selection of "appropriate recipes," from a very wide range of adequate processing techniques and materials avail­able to the potter, is based in the general and spe­cific knowledge of individuals and the way they perceive themselves in society, in the local con­ceptions of techno-functional constraints, in the relation with activities other than pottery produc­tion, and in the specific symbolic meaning of mate­rials and particular behaviors. 
As Gosselain and Livingstone-Smith (2005:73-74) have pointed out: 
potters do not act randomly, but navigate 
throughout a narrow channel of culturally 
defined and shared practices," and" traditions 
may be considered as local definitions of what 
is possible and what is not within specific 
context, such definitions (or rules ) being 
embodied by individuals through practice, tac­
itly shared and, most often, non-explicit. 
This means that traditions are understood not as mere technical acts, but as culturally defined prac­tices that are transmitted both vertically and hori­zontally within a society as well as within very narrow social limits (Barley 1994; Gosselain and Livingstone-Smith 2005; Wenger 1998). 
Late period in Northwestern Argentina: Chiefdoms and Power 
The Late period in Northwestern Argentina was tra­ditionally characterized as a time of marked regional development, increased sociopolitical complexity, inequality, economic stratification, and internal conflicts (warfare) (Gonzalez 1977; Gonzalez and Perez 1972; Ottonello and Lorandi 1987; Raffino 1983, 1991; Tarrag6 2000). It was a time when regional chiefdoms arose in different geographical areas-identified with specific valleys-leading to centralized power, controlled labor forces, increased social inequality, craft spe­cialization, and the beginning of large fortified archaeological sites strategically built on defensive locations2 (cf. Leoni and Acuto 2008; Nielsen 2007). The Belen and Santamaria cultures were characterized as Late period chiefdoms with an increased sociopolitical complexity, a strong emphasis in agricultural and pastoralist economy (evidenced by large stone masonry settlements and intensified agricultural infrastructure), and the exis­tence of craft specialization mostly based in the archeological record of pottery production (Gonzalez 1977; Gonzalez and Perez 1972; Ottonello and Lorandi 1987; Raffino 1983, 1991; Tarrag6 2000; see also Gonzalez 2004 for a dis­cussion on metallurgical production). One the most important aspects of the Late period concerns the mortuary practices, namely the occurrence of funer­ary urns for infant burials, and in some exceptional cases also for adults (Berberian 1969; Gonzalez 1977; Gonzalez and Perez 1972). Treatment of these burials involved a complex ritual mortuary practice, including several different patterns of fan­tastic decoration on the external surfaces of funer­ary urns (e.g., Nastri 2008; Sempe and Garcfa 2007; Wynveldt 2007). The sites are large clustered res­idential compounds in which households are the basic unit of spatial organization (Leoni and Acuto 2008). Some of these Late period sites include Inka architecture in a differentiated sector, for example Fuerte Quemado (middle Calchaquf Valley, Cata­marca), Hualffn (Hualffn Valley, Catamarca), and La Paya (northern Calchaquf Valley, Salta) ( Ambrosetti 1907-1908; Gonzalez and Diaz 1992; Orgaz 2008; Raffino 1991). Although the Sana­gasta culture was not originally defined as a chief­dom, it has large settlements with rooms made of mudbricks (tapia and adobes) and shares with 
Belen and Santamaria the presence of agricultural terraces and the common mortuary practice of bury­ing infants in decorated funerary urns (Gonzalez 1977; Gonzalez and Perez 1972). 
Archaeologists have not solved the question regarding the relationship between Sanagasta groups and the Inkas, given that no evidence of Inka architecture and ceramics were found in

Sanagasta classical sites. On the other hand, Sempe ( 1980) defined the Abaucan culture as dif­ferent from the Sanagasta in that it used a differ­ent type of funerary urns. At almost 2 m tall, these Abaucan urns are larger than Sanagasta urns and show very different ceramic morphology and dec­oration. In regard to the proto-historic groups pre­ceding the Diaguitas (the native groups Spaniards encountered in the early sixteenth century), Gonzalez and Perez (1972), stated that the Sana­gasta, Belen, and Santamaria cultures composed the core of the organized resistance against the Hispanic conquest. 
Batungasta: A Late period 
Ceramic Production Center 

The archaeological site of Batungasta is located in the middle portion of the Abaucan Valley (Dept. of Tinogasta, Province of Catamarca, Argentina), approximately 25 km northwest of the town of Tinogasta (Figure 1 ). It is in the area known as La Troya, approximately 50 m south of the La Troya River; one sector of the site was built on a sandy hillside and the other on an alluvial clay deposit. The site covers an area of approximately 2 km2 and is evidenced by abundant surface architecture (of stone and mudbricks) and ceramic sherds. The site was studied by several researchers throughout a period spanning more than a century (Lafone Quevedo 1892; Lange 1892; Quiroga 1897; Weisser 1925), although the main contributions started in the 1970s (Gonzalez and Sempe 1975; Raffino 1991, 1995; Raffino et al. 1982; Ratto, Orgaz, and Pla 2002; Sempe 1973, 1976, 1977a, 1977b, 1983a, 1983b). The site was frequently characterized as an Iuka site (Sempe 1976, 1977a, 1977b ), with a settlement pattern interpreted as indicative of an "administrative center" (Raffino 1991, 1995; Raffino et al. 1982) (Figure 2). Occu­pation of Batungasta began during the Late period, however, and lasted until the Hispanic conquest (Ratto, Orgaz, and Pla 2002; Ratto 2005; Sempe 1976, 1977a, 1977b). Recent research carried out by Ratto determined that the site was a ceramic pro­duction-center, at least during the Late and Inka periods although probably beginning at earlier times (Caletti 2005; Feely 2003; Feely et al. 2010; Ratto, Orgaz, and Pla 2002, 2004; Ratto, Orgaz, de la Fuente and Pla 2002); the radiocarbon dates obtained in the western section of the site show that it was occupied during the Inka, Hispanic, and Colonial times (Ratto 2005: Table 3). The most direct evidence of ceramic production includes more than 50 ceramic kilns of different shapes in the northern and southern sections of the site (Caletti 2005; Feely et al. 2010; Ratto, Orgaz, and Pla 2002), as well as by-products, wasters, and high frequencies of overtired sherds (De La Fuente 2007) (Figure 3). Overtired sherds and wasters are considered direct evidence of pottery production. Wasters in pottery production include high fre­quencies of broken vessels associated with kilns, parts of vessels with evident deformation processes, and sherds showing different defects resulting from several firing atmospheres (Figure 3). 
Characteristics of Ceramic Production 
Organization at Batungasta 

We studied the organization and scale of ceramic production during the Late period by analyzing an extensive ceramic sample from a surface collection at Batungasta and its surroundings (n = 15,937)3, along with a sample of ceramic vessels from archaeological collections (n = 93) and ceramic material from stratigraphic excavations in various structures at Batungasta. 
Results of this research are summarized below: 
(
1) Recording of more than 50 ceramic kilns north and south ofBatungasta supports the idea pro­posed by Ratto that Batungasta was a ceramic pro­duction center (Caletti 2005; Feely et al. 2010; Ratto, Orgaz, de la Fuente and Pla 2002; Ratto, Orgaz, and Pla 2002, 2004; Ratto et al. 2007) dur­ing prehispanic times (Figure 3). 

(2) 
High frequencies of overtired sherds and their spatial correlation with kilns reinforce the interpretation that ceramics were produced at the site (Figure 3) (De La Fuente 2007; Feely 2003). 

(3) 
Frequencies of diagnostic ceramic sherds indicate that ceramic production intensified during the Late period at Batungasta, especially for what were traditionally defined in the archaeological lit­erature as Sanagasta, Abaucan, and Belen cultures (Gonzalez 1955, 1963, 1977; Gonzalez y Perez 1972).

148) and their comparison with ceramic vessels from different archaeological collections (n = 93) suggest the following narrow spectrum of ceramic forms was present in the middle sector of Abaucan Valley during the Late period: funerary urns, bowls, and globular ollas (Table 1 and Figure 4) (De La Fuente 2007). 
(5) Identification of the aforementioned ceramic forms has led to the construction of a tentative and preliminary ceramic typology for the Late period; it is characterized by ceramic forms such as bowls, globular ollas, and funerary urns. Bowls are assigned mostly to the Sanagasta andAbaucan cul­tures (Figure 5 and 6). Globular ollas often belong both to decorated and non-decorated Sanagasta types (Figure 7). Among the funerary urns, the most commmi are the Sanagasta infant funerary urns (Figure 8a-f), followed by nondecorated Sanagasta urns with conical bases (Figure 8g-i), and the Abaucan urns in lesser numbers (Figure 8j-m) (Boman 1927-1932; De La Fuente 2007). 
Dimensional Standardization and Craft 
Specialization in Pottery Production at 
Batungasta 

Analysis of dimensional variability during the Late period in ceramic vessels from archaeological col­lections (n = 93) has made it possible to determine which variables offer the most adequate measures and indexes to study dimensional standardization, but this study highlights the need to use data for interpretations cautiously (De La Fuente 2007). Dimensional standardization in the manufacture of ceramic vessels in pre-state non-Western societies is quite complex, in spite of the vast corpus of mainly ethnoarchaeological data supporting the operationalization of this concept in the study of archaeological ceramics (Arnold 2000, 2005; Arnold and Nieves 1992; P. Arnold 1991; Benco 1987; Blackman et al. 1993; Blinman 1988; Blin­man and Wilson 1992; Brumfiel and Earle 1987; Costin 1991; Crown 1995; Kvamme et al. 1996;

in regard to ceramic paste analyses, the potters' choices are broadly masked, both synchronically and diachronically, by a combination of natural and cultural variability. Natural variability is related to the availability of ceramic raw materials inherent in the local geology. Cultural variability refers to the technological behaviors of potters in the selection, modification, and mixing of clays for manufactur­ing ceramic vessels. The final product of potters is also affected by social and political factors. 
Quantitative studies attempting to approach standardization in ceramic production typically have employed relatively simple measures of dis­persion or variability such as standard deviation (s), sample variance (s2), and coefficient of varia­tion (CV) (Benco 1987; Crown 1995; Longacre et al. 1988;Arnold andNieves 1992; Hagstrum 1985; Sinopoli 1988; Stark 1992, 1995). The standard deviation and variance are useful for describing the absolute variation in a frequency distribution. The coefficient of variation expresses the standard devi­ation as a percentage of the mean (i), and is there­fore useful for comparing proportional variation in data sets with markedly different means (Van Pool and Leonard 2011 :55). In our study, we used the following dimensional variables for each ceramic category: (1) total vessel height, (2) rim height, (3) neck height, ( 4) height to the maximum diameter, (5) rim diameter, (6) neck diameter, (7) maximum diameter, (8) base diameter, (9) rim thickness, (10) neck thickness, (11) thickness 1 cm below rim, (12) body wall thickness, and (13) base thickness. Additionally, we studied the following most significant dimensional relations between variables: (1) maximum diameter I total vessel height, (2) maximum diameter I rim diameter, (3) rim diameter I total vessel height, and ( 4) total ves­sel height I height to maximum diameter. Finally,

we compared coefficients of variation for each of the defined ceramic groups.4 
The results reveal the existence of reduction of dimensional variability in at least three ceramic cat­egories: nondecorated funerary urns (n 10), infant

funerary urns (Type A: n = 16 and Type B: n = 7), and bowls (n = 18) (Figures 6 and 8; Tables 2, 3, 4, and 5) (De La Fuente 2007). Low values obtained for CV s in some variables such as vessel height, rim diameter, and maximum diameter indicate that the manufacture of these ceramic forms was strictly controlled by ancient potters in order to achieve a "dimensional standard" in vessels, thus reducing dimensional variability. This is what researchers have referred to as "dimensional standardization," which was achieved by ancient potters through highly skilled manufacture routines; in other words, a chaine operatoire involving a narrow spectrum of primary vessel forming techniques. The lowest CV values were obtained for the non decorated funer­ary urns (n = 10) (Table 5); this indicates that, at the dimensional level, this category appears more stan­dardized than the others. 
It is interesting to observe that the CV s obtained for total height, maximum diameter, and rim diam­eter show values that are much higher than those recorded in the few other cases in which this kind of study was carried out on archaeological assem­blages (see Crown 1995:153-155, Tables 6.2 and 6.3; but cf. Allen 1992: 144-154, Tables 6. 1 and 6.2 and Longacre et al. 1988:105-111, Tables 3 and 4). 
Generally, it is observed that coefficients of vari­ation for all categories of small vessels (bowls and infant funerary urns) are higher than 10 percent, indicating a relative lack of standardization (see Table 2, 3, and 4 ). The figures for the large vessels (non decorated funerary urns) are generally lower than those for small vessels, and include coeffi-

cients of variation less than 10 percent (see Table 5), indicating that this category is more standard­ized than the small vessels. However, we must be cautious about this conclusion since most of the ceramic categories are very small in sample size.

Technical Choices in Paste and Forming Techniques 
Ceramic technological studies carried out with a binocular microscope and by ceramic petrology suggest a consistent technology during the Late period (Figure 11), strongly marked by the use of local raw materials. There was a good fit between the data obtained with binocular microscope (Table 6) and ceramic petrology (Table 7); this allowed us to define 17 different inclusion types (Figure 12).

Quantitative analyses were car­ried out applying the 'total area' method, counting 200 inclusions per sherd (Middleton et al. 1985), and descriptions of the main characteristics of fabrics were done following Freestone (1995), Mathew et al. (1991), and Barraclough (1992). Volcanic glass, argillaceous inclusions, and grog were unequivocally identified with ceramic petrology using criteria for plane and cross-polar­ized light reported in the literature (Cuomo Di Caprio and Vaughan 1993; Middleton et al. 1985; Whitbread 1986).

2004, for similar results in Inka ceramics). How­ever, grog ( < 1 percent) and volcanic glass (5 per­cent) percentages are very low compared to other tempers (Table 6 and 7). The low percentages of grog and volcanic glass suggest that this techno­logical choice might represent a deliberate practice linked to wider social aspects rather than a func­tional choice; this should be further explored in Late and Inka periods (see Bengtsson et al. 2001; Paez 2005, 2010; Paez andArnosio 2009; Paez and Patane 2007; Schwartz 1991; Tarrago et al. 2002, for the presence of grog and volcanic glass in Late period Santamaria ceramics). 
Primary and secondary ceramic forming tech­niques were studied at both macroscopic and micro­scopic levels of resolution, using X-ray radiography and ceramic petrology (De La Fuente 2011 ). Pre­hispanic ceramics in Northwestern Argentina were handmade and ancient potters used a narrow and very specific repertoire of primary forming tech­niques to shape the ceramic vessels during the Late period. Coiling was the most common primary forming technique used to shape the body of the vessels, followed by drawing in order to form the highest section of the bases, and then use of a non­conventional mold to produce concave bases in large vessels (De La Fuente 20 11:Figure 5-11). Surprisingly, an unusual use of slabs was recorded by X-ray radiography in some bowls of the Sana­gasta culture. Of the secondary forming techniques, the only one that could be properly identified both at macroscopic and microscopic levels was scrap­ing. Scraping was identified both in internal and

Results obtained through the application of INAA5 to a sample of ceramics from the Late and Inka periods (n = 127) clearly indicate that ceramic artifacts were being locally produced in the vicin­ity of the Batungasta site, mainly using clays from a source identified in the area of La Troya River (see Pia and Ratto 2003, 2007; Ratto, Orgaz, De La Fuente, and Pia 2002; Ratto, Orgaz, and Pia 2002; Ratto et al. 2009). The later statement is based on the analyses of compositional data obtained through INAA by Ratto from the last 15 years in the Abaucan Valley (see Pia and Ratto 2003, 2007; Ratto, Orgaz, De La Fuente, and Pia 2002; Ratto, Orgaz, and Pia 2002, 2004; Ratto et al. 2007, 2009). 
The analysis of pottery production at Batun­gasta during the Late (ca. A.D. 900-1450) and Inka (ca. A.D. 1480-1532) periods indicates that-throughout time-it was highly concen-

2-5) and the control and re-use of ceramic raw mate­rials thr'C>ugh time (Ratto et al. 2004), we believe that during the Late period in the middle sector of the Abaucan Valley, there is evidence that pottery was primarily produced on a household basis by nonspecialist potters, although some forms like non-decorated funerary urns and bowls may have been produced by part-time specialists (Crown 1995). 
Craft specialization in pottery production during the Late period is understood here as a broad con­cept involving not only the dimensional level, but also the recipes used by ancient potters for ceramic pastes,

on the notion of a community of potters, wherein pottery production in the middle sector of Abaucan Valley (Dept. ofTinogasta, Province of Catamarca) was geographically concentrated at Batungasta and its surroundings. This pottery production was car­ried out in household contexts, and ceramic goods were distributed within the Abaucan Valley during the Late period (Ratto, Orgaz, De La Fuente, and Pla 2002; Ratto, Orgaz, and Pla 2002, 2004; Ratto et al. 2007). 
Pottery production became more intensified and specialized over the course of the Late period, with very well-established workshops in residential con­texts sharing a high degree of functional special­ization and exploitation of ceramic resources (De La Fuente 2007; Pla and Ratto 2007). This spe­cialization has a direct archaeological material cor­relate in the appearance of higher degrees of standardization at both the morphological and dimensional levels in the manufacture of vessels and of ceramic pastes used during this period (Arnold -lOOO; De La Fuente 2007, 2011). 
As for ceramic pastes, during this period there is almost a continuum through time in which there are no significant changes in ceramic recipes used by ancient potters to produce ceramic vessels (De La Fuente 2007). Ceramic production was perhaps intensified and reoriented again during the Inka occupation of the Abaucan Valley (Orgaz et al. 2007; Ratto, Orgaz, and Pla 2002), to cater to the demands of a state bureaucracy after these new ter­ritories and populations were annexed (Orgaz et al. 2007 ; Williams 2000). 
It is almost impossible to talk about "tradition" in archaeology without falling into interpretations shaped by the old cultural-historical paradigm. I believe, as I mentioned above, that traditions can be visualized as "culturally defined practices" through time within communities with very marked social limits (Gosselain and Livingstone-Smith 2005). This definition might apply to the archaeo­logical record of pottery production at the Batun­gasta archaeological site during the Late period at Abaucan Valley, where we can propose the exis­tence of a local "pottery tradition." This would imply a consistent set of practices or technical behaviors repeated by potters through time. Such tradition began early and blossomed during the Late period with ceramic manifestations known collectively as Sanagasta Culture; it involved dif­ferent technical choices in several stages of pottery production such as: ( 1) a repeated use of local

ceramic raw materials through time (both clays and tempers); (2) shaping of very specific ceramic forms (bowls, ollas, and funerary urns), most of them related to conception and death rites (i.e., infant funerary urns); (3) the existence of dimen­sional variation between each ceramic category analyzed, what might be read as some forms being more standardized than others; ( 4) use of a reduced repertoire of primary and secondary forming tech­niques; (5) extremely conservative decoration of vessels; and (6) use of a very well-defined set of techniques for ceramic firing in kilns (see Caletti 2005; De La Fuente 2007; also see an excellent dis­cussion about this topic in Pool 2000). 
Thus, studying the chafne operatoire of ceramic manufacture during the Late period at Abaucan Valley is a useful conceptual framework from which to advance to other ideas related to techni­cal identity as expressed in the way potters con­figure themselves as individuals participating in society. In this way, the addition of "grog" as tem­per to ceramic pastes in Sanagasta bowls and urns in very low percentages has no functional signifi­cance (De La Fuente 2007). Instead, the grinding and addition of grog as temper is considered a tech­nological choice related to a broader reproductive social practice, probably associated with rites, myths, and prohibitions governing life (Barley 1994; also see Sillar 2000a, 2000b), an idea that should be further explored through additional tech­nological studies of these kinds of vessels. 
On the other hand, the addition of low concen­trations of volcanic glass inclusions to Late period ceramics raises the question whether this practice was related to broader cultural practices mainly linked to the importance of volcanoes in the daily life in the Andes (see Paez 2010; Paez andAmosio 2009 for a functional discussion dealing with this potting practice). 
Finally, the concept of chafne operatoire offers a useful tool to explain the natural processes and to structure those cultural processes occurring within society. What Barley (1994: 138) referred to as the potting model "is only one of many options for a culture to think about itself." 
Thus, it should not be surprising that the archae­ological record shows that pottery took different configurations and patterns as a consequence of its role as a social product. Studying the chafne opera­toire in past pottery-making societies is a power­ful theoretical and methodological tool to approach topics such as technical identity and technical behavior from a different perspective in order to bet­ter understand the role of pottery in the past. Archaeologists should be aware of the limitations imposed by traditional typological approaches, which sometimes limit interpretations to only pot­tery function.

1. 
It is not the intention of this paper to enter in the dis­cussion of agency theory-and the concept of practice-and its relation with technology. Several works by Dobres have remarkably developed this relationship in several ways (Dobres 1999, 2000, 2001, 2008). 

2. 
Recently, this vision has been questioned and several topics such as sociopolitical complexity, inequality, the pro­duction and use of prestige goods, and the evidence of war­fare are currently under reassessment considering the evidence present in the archaeological record of the Late period (Gonzalez 2004; Leoni and Acuto 2008; Nielsen 200 I, 2006, 2007). 

3. 
This ceramic sample was selected from a larger sample (n = 66,000) collected through an intensive survey carried out to the north, south and east of the Batungasta archaeological site as part of the Batungasta Archaeological Rescue Project (Ratto, Orgaz, and Pia 2002, 2004; Ratto, Orgaz, de la Fuente and Pia 2002; Ratto et al. 2007). 

4. 
The effect of sample size for small samples was cor­rected by the application of the formula CV= (l+l/4n) CV, as recommended in VanPool and Leonard (201 1 :55-56). 


5. It is not the goal of this paper to present in a detailed 

way the INAA data. The INAA analyses were done at Ezeiza Atomic Centre, National Commission of Atomic Energy, Argentina. The analyses were done by Lie. Rita Pia and Dr. Norma R. Ratto through different research projects, and have been extensively published elsewhere (Pia and Ratto 2003, 2007; Ratto, Orgaz, de la Fuente and Pia 2002; Ratio, Orgaz, and Pia 2002).
