and sherds and artifacts,followed by a concluding chap­ter. In the architecture chapter, Haviland groups all struc­tures with sufficient data (n = 164; 81 of which are substructures buried by later structures) into nine formal categories and uses form and other salient details to infer building function. Haviland concludes that only nine structures are definitively not houses. In the burials chapter, Haviland divides the 47 burials (from 21 archi­tectural groups) into household burials (n = 37), which are routine interments, and burials of special significance (n = 10), such as interments that dedicate a special pur­pose structure. Much of the variation seen in the burials 
has to do with age and sex: adults as opposed to non­adults and men as opposed to women received more elaborate burials. Haviland discusses 20 problematical deposits consisting of caches/dedicatory offerings, non­dedicatory household offerings, secondary burials, and deposits not fully accounted for. According to Haviland, these deposits suggest that households had their own unique ritual practices. In the chapter on sherds and arti­facts, Haviland returns to the question of structure func­tion and presents five criteria that should be met if a group of small structures were a residential group: there should be lots of trash, lots of utilitarian ceramics, lots of utilitarian lithics, evidence for fire, and, finally, food preparation should be one of the main functions of the utilitarian artifacts. This chapter summarizes the pottery and other artifacts found at 30 structure groups, five structure loci and four chultun loci. 
In the concluding chapter, Haviland revisits ideas now familiar to Mayanists: that isolated structures develop into a multiple structure plaza group, that mul­tiple structure plaza groups contain nuclear families that make up an extended family, that the extended family often has a principal nuclear family occupying an elab­orate residence, and that major alterations to residences usually occurred every 25 to 35 years, representing the kind of shift in household dynamics that Haviland else­where refers to as "musical hammocks." He argues that residential groups with multiple plazas represent local­ized lineages and these lineages declined during the Late Classic due to land scarcity and craft specialization. He notes social diversity among the non-elites at Tikal, seen in architecture, burials, and artifacts, and argues that few non-elites in Tikal's central 9 km2 were farmers. 
Haviland ends 20B by comparing Tikal to Mayapan. Haviland is not alone here. Based on the recent publication ofTikal Report 27A, others have argued thatTikal's econ­omy was commercialized, much like that of Mayapan (e.g., Masson and Freidel, Journal of Anthropological Archaeology 31 :455--484). What is important here is not the correctness of such comparisons but the fact that the 
Tikal Reports contain the data that allow such compar­isons to be made. They permit the kinds of broad thinking that can reshape our understanding of the ancient Maya. 
Haviland and the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Anthropology and Archaeology deserve the highest praise for creating and publishing TR 20A and 20B.

Although archaeological research in the South American Andes is vibrant, the archaeological record in Chile remains understudied compared to neighboring Peru and Bolivia. In The Teleoscopic Polity: Andean Patriarchy and Materiality, Tom D. Dillehay attempts to rectify this with a comprehensive archaeological and ethnohistorical study of the Araucanians or Mapuche of south-central Chile, focusing on the sixteenth and seventeenth cen­turies, during which the Araucanians successfully resisted Spanish colonization. Rather than simply present a site report on an understudied region, however, Dillehay and his collaborators have used the archaeological and ethnohistorical record to examine much larger questions of the emergence of social and political complexity. 
The Teleoscopic Polity: Andean Patriarchy and Materiality is the fourth, and final, published volume that focuses on Araucanian and Spanish interaction in the Puren and Lumaco Valleys of south-central Chile. Dillehay's first volume, entitled Monuments, Resistance, and Empires in the Andes: Araucanian Ritual Narratives and Polity (Cambridge University Press, 2007) focused on the role of mound building and the development and of leadership and shamanism as inferred from archae­ological and historical research. Published by Vanderbilt University Press, the second and third volumes focused on ceramic and settlement pattern data and are entitled 
Late Prehispanic and Hispanic Ceramics in the Puren, Lumaco, and Liucura Valleys, La Araucania, Chile (2010) and Los Valles de Puren-Lumaco Liucura, Chile (by Dillehay and Jose Saavedra Zapata, 2010). The fourth volume, reviewed here, synthesizes decades of research and presents new theoretical developments, including the concept of the teleoscopic polity. 
Within The Teleoscopic Polity: Andean Patriarchy and Materiality, Dillehay first provides a clear and con­cise discussion of the research questions and volume organization (Chapter 1 by Dillehay). He then focuses on his theoretical approaches, with a sophisticated dis­cussion of incipient state formation through reciprocity, political cohesion, and materiality (Chapter 2 by Dille­hay). The following chapters then provide the necessary background on the Aruacanian polity, both through eth­nohistorical data (Chapter 3 by Jose Manuel Zavala C.)

and through archaeological excavations at 21 sites in the Puren and Lumaco Valley (Chapters 4 and 5 by Dillehay). Dillehay returns to his main research ques­tions and expands upon his concepts of the teleoscopic polity in Chapter 11. In addition to the theoretical focus of this volume, it also contains descriptive chapters by Dillehay and his collaborators that present new data and analyses of environmental reconstruction (Chapter 6 by Ana M. Abarzua,Alia G. Pinchicura, Leonora Jarpa,Ale­jandra Martel-Cea, Mieke Sterken, Rodrigo Vera, and Mario Pino Q .) , mound construction (Chapter 7 by Dille­hay and Saavedra Zapata),ethnobotanical remains (Chap­ter 8 by Claudia Silva Dfaz), ceramic and stone artifacts (Chapter 9 by Dillehay), settlement patterns (Chapter 10 by Dillehay, J. Paige Silcox, and Carlos Ocampo E.), radiocarbon and thermoluminesence dates (Chapter 12 by Dillehay and Silcox), carbonized botanical remains (Chapter 13 by Renee M. Bonzani), wood charcoal remains (Chapter 14 by Maria Eugenia Solari), phytoliths (Chapter 15 by Jose Iriarte), and soil samples (Chapter 16 by Oscar Segue!, Mario Pino Q., and Dillehay). 
While it is admittedly difficult to simultaneously present new data from scientific analyses and new the­oretical constructs based on multiple lines of archaeo­logical and ethnohistorical evidence, Dillehay and his colleagues should be commended for producing a vol­ume that contains both. While the raw data contained in the volume will be of interest to archaeologists with interests in the region, the volume's most significant contribution is its examination of Araucanian political processes and successful resistance to the Spanish during the Colonial period. DiJlehay's approach to polity for­mation focuses on its dynamic nature. Against the idea of a centralized, hierarchical polity, he argues that the terms composite polity and teleoscopic best describe the compartmentalized or composite geopolitical orga­nization that the Araucanian polity formed through a telescope-like extension from family/household groups to local patrilineages to larger regional alliances. The Araucanian polity, Dillehay argues, was also a patriar­chal polity focused on warriorhood and reinforced through a largely male pantheon and through patrilin­eage and patrilocality. His discussions of ethnohistorical and archaeological evidence for patrilineages and the importance of warriorhood are useful additions to larger discussions of gender in the past and will be of interest to scholars with interests in masculinity as well as polity formation. In addition, Dillehay's emphasis on the important role of ritual settings and the maintenance and display of ancestors and their associated landscapes will make this an important book for scholars interested in the role of the dead in the living, such as bioarchae­ologists and scholars interested in post-mortem agency. 
In conclusion, Dillehay has used multiple lines of archaeological and ethnohistorical evidence to explore the emergence of the Araucanian patriarchal polity in the Colonial period, providing an alternative conceptu­alization of a complex polity; with little centralized power and an unostentatious material record, the Arau­canian polity successfully resisted the Spanish empire for more than 250 years and maintained political and economic autonomy long after many indigenous groups had been incorporated into the Spanish empire. With its wide-ranging scope, this volume will be of broad interest to specialists in Andean archaeology and history, as well as scholars with interests in sophisticated theoretical approaches to state formation, colonial interactions, ethnogenesis (or ethnomorphosis, in the Araucanian case), masculinity and warriorhood, war and violence, and landscape archaeology.

In this second edition, Mary Ellen Miller and Megan E. O'Neil have crafted a succinct, yet rich and beautifully illustrated introduction to the art and architecture of the Maya. They have substantially expanded, reorganized, and augmented the ten chapters of the first edition to include intervening archaeological discoveries, current theoretical developments, and the colonial and contem­porary Maya. These changes ensure the continued impor­tance of this volume for introducing students and lay audiences to the aesthetic dimensions of Maya art and the intellectual concerns with which the field engages. 
The book is organized by media or subject matter and chronologically within each chapter. Chapter 1 pre­sents an overview of Maya art historical study, the chronological and geographical dimensions of the tra­dition, and basic themes, while Chapter 2 examines the material genres of Maya art. Chapter 3 introduces struc­tural types, the built landscape, and regional and tem­poral architectural variation. This chapter proves particularly useful for isolating key features of specific traditions and the kinds of spaces most marked in the formal vocabulary of the Maya. Chapter 4 turns to the human form and its realization in various media. Chap­ters 5-7 present a history of sculptural forms and their development from the Preclassic to the Classic periods and geographically span the southern Lowlands to the
