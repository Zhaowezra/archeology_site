THE ROLE OF SOLAR OBSERVATIONS IN DEVELOPING THE 
PRECLASSIC MAYA CALENDAR 

Susan Milbrath 
Intervals of 260 days are recorded by architectural orientations at a number of Maya sites, a pattern that may have developed early at sites such as Nakbe. The 260-day calendar, emphasizing sets of 13 and 20 days, dates back to the Middle Preclassic, when early E-Groups in the Maya area were used for solar observations. These observations were probably linked with a maize cycle spanning 260 days. By the end of the Late Preclassic, however, most E-Groups were abandoned or modi.ed for a different function, serving as a stage for rituals performed by rulers at a time when the Long Count calendar was being developed. The changing role of E-Groups relates to the rise of royal rituals associated with the detailed historical records documented in Maya Long Count inscriptions. 
En varios sitios en el área maya se registran, a partir de las orientaciones arquitectónicas, intervalos de 260 días. Este patrón pudo haberse desarrollado de forma temprana en sitios como Nakbe, Petén, Guatemala. El calendario de 260 días, que enfatiza los conjuntos de 13 y 20 días, data del preclásico medio, cuando se utilizaron los primeros grupos conmemorativos en el área maya para realizar observaciones solares. Estas observaciones probablemente estuvieron vinculadas con un ciclo del maíz que dura 260 días. Sin embargo, a .nales del preclásico tardío, la mayoría de los grupos conmemorativos fueron abandonados o modi.cados para servir una función diferente. Estos grupos fueron utilizados como escenarios para rituales llevados a cabo por la realeza en el periodo durante el cual se desarrolló el calendario de cuenta larga. El nuevo papel de los grupos conmemorativos se relaciona con el aumento de los rituales reales. Estos mismos son asociados con los detallados registros históricos documentados en inscripciones mayas que usan fechas de cuenta larga.

uringthe MiddlePreclassic(1000/900– 400 B.C.), specialized architectural complexeswere constructedto trackthe changing seasonal positionsof thesun along the horizon. The oldest known complex, ca. 1000 B.C.,isfoundin theMaya area (Inomataet al. 2013:467).Theseare calledE-Groups, based on an architectural assemblage .rst recognized in Group E at Uaxactun. They represent the ear­liest civic architecture and predate documented evidence of calendar records in Mesoamerica, suggestingthat solar observationsinthesegroups mayhave helpeddevelopthe calendar. 
MiddlePreclassicE-Groups hadapyramid on thewestsidefacinga .at range structuretothe east that served as an arti.cial horizon. These early range structures may have had wooden posts or stone markerstomeasurethe movement of thesun along the horizon (Rice 2007:87, 147, 155). Archaeological evidence for markers is lacking,butthese couldhavebeen impermanent, such as crossed sticks or small rocks on the surface of the structure. The orientations in Middle and Late PreclassicE-Groups emphasize thesolstices, and AnthonyAveni and colleagues (2003:163) conclude that the earliest orientation calendar, well before written records, was based on solstice alignments. 
E-Group structures clearly served some astronomical purpose in the evolution of the Mesoamerican calendar (Aveni et al. 2003:174). AsAveni(2002:211) notes,earlyLowlandMaya E-Groups concentrate in the “magic latitude,” wherethe year can be segmented into multiples of20 days that separatethe solstices, equinoxes, and solar zeniths. These 20-day sets are an essential component of both the Mesoamerican year and the 260-day ritual calendar. With 13

E-Groups: Changing Function Over Time 
Prudence Rice(2007:147) points out that proto­E-Groups are evident in Middle Preclassic mound-plus-platform arrangements in Chiapas and in Tabasco at the Olmec site of La Venta (Str. D1 and D8). She suggests these sites had multiplemarkersalongtheplatformtodetermine thesolstices,equinoxes,andthe zenithsun,when the marker would act as a gnomon and cast no shadow at noon (Aimers and Rice 2006:80, 92; Rice 2007:87).Eventhough theorientations differ markedly, La Venta may be the progen­itor of the early E-Group at Chiapa de Corzo (Clark and Hansen 2001:4; Sullivan 2015:456), or possiblyviceversa becausethereisevidence of shared ideas that mayhavecomefromChiapas toLaVentainthe MiddlePreclassic(Milbrath 1979:44–45).TheLaVentamounds arealigned 8° west-of-north,inkeeping with themainorien­tationofthe urban core, whichtranslatesinto8° north-of-east(90° minus8°)for the east-facing pyramid(Rice 2007:81–83, Figure5.3). TheE-Groupat Chiapade Corzoalsofollowsthepri­mary orientation of the site (28° east-of-north), translatinginto28° south-of-eastfor thepyramid, according toTimothySullivan(2015:460, Figure 4),butAveni and HorstHartung(2000:58, 60, Table1) measured alignments closer to 25°, whichhave been con.rmedbyIvan Šprajc and Francisco SánchezNava(2015:57,Table3.1). 
Despite widelydifferent orientations at Mid­dle Preclassic sites, Takeshi Inomata (2017) points out that recent studies by Michael Blake (2013) suggest the possibility that early E-Groupsin ChiapasandatLaVentarepresenta compromise between celestial orientations and topographic landmarks, such as mountains and volcanoes. Blake found that the central axis of theseE-Groupswasoriented toward thewinter or summer solstice sunrise, and, depending on which solstice was centered on the mound, the equinox sunrise aligned approximately with the northern or southern end of the eastern mound. Inomata concludes that these solar alignments served as generalized representations of cosmo­logical symbolism, rather than as devices for precise solar observations.Greater precision in thesolar orientationsisevidentinearly E-Groups fromtheMayaLowlands, perhaps becausethere werefewertopographicfeatures on the horizon to serve as alternate sight lines. 
With such an expansive horizon in the low­lands,stellaralignmentsshouldalsobe consid­ered. GrantAylesworth(2004)notes that many Maya E-Groups are aligned with the zodiacal band, a band about 18° wide centered on the ecliptic, the apparent “path” of the sun through the sky. The approximate equinox orientation of some early E-Groups is noteworthy because this alignment also marked the horizon posi­tion of Orion (ca. 1000–400 B.C.; Aveni et al. 2003:173).Orion’sBeltisalso consideredtobe signi.cantin early orientationsin theValley of Oaxaca that display alignments similar to those at LaVenta(Peeler andWinter 1992/1993;but see Šprajc and Sánchez 2015:44–52). Around 500 B.C.,Orion’sBeltdisappeared fromthesky from April 23 to June 12 (Aveni 2001:Table 10).Its annual disappearance coincided with the .rst maizeplanting, and it reemerged when the maize was sprouting (Milbrath 1999:248). A metaphorical connection between Orion’s Belt and maize may have developed in Preclassic times because the .rst bright star in the belt becamevisibleonthe eastern horizonatdawnin early June, when the young maize sprouted. By September, when the maize matured, the three starsofOrion’sBeltalignedvertically above the horizon around midnight, like a mature maize plant rising up tall and tasseled. 
The recently discovered E-Group at Ceibal, Guatemala, .rst constructed around 1000 B.C., seems to con.rm earlier suggestions that E-Groups originatedin theMayaLowlands (Clark and Hansen 2001:23; Rice 2007:203; Stanton and Freidel 2003:9, 11).This early E-Group (ca. 1000–800 B.C.) hadaplatformtothe west and arange structuretothe east, whichwasburied around 800 B.C. when theybuiltanewversion of the elongated platform farther to the east (Inomata et al. 2013:467–468).

Arlen and Diane Chase (2017)point out that E-Groups represent the .rst formofpublic architectureintheLowlandMaya area. JamesDoyle(2012:369, 374) emphasizes that MiddlePreclassicE-Groups with theirbroad plazas may be the earliest large-scale settings for political and community gatherings in the MayaLowlands. People fromdistant areas could havegatheredinaccompanying plazas,wherethe interchangeof ideaslikelydevelopedata time when manyMiddlePreclassicMaya sitesshared Mamon-sphere ceramics(Doyle 2012:372–374). 
The Late Preclassic E-Group at El Mirador aligns to the position of the sun on the summer and winter solstices, and theCentralAcropolis is alignedto sunriseon February12and October 30, designating a 260-day interval seen in orien­tations elsewhereatElMirador.Thisisoneof the most common alignment patterns in the Maya Lowlands (Aveni et al. 2003; González-García and Šprajc 2016:196; Šprajc et al. 2009:87– 90, Table1; Sánchez and Šprajc 2015). The solstice alignments of the El Mirador E-Group repeat at Uaxactun, but many of the E-Groups Aveni pro.led show a variety of orientations. KathrynReeseTaylor(2017)notes two patterns for E-Groups in the Karstic Uplands, home to sites such as Calakmul, El Mirador, Naachtun,

Nakbe, and Yaxnohcah. One orientation group apparently tracks the Haab with alignments to dates thatfallin setsof20 days on either sideof the summer solstice or zenith passage. Another less common patterningseemsto commemorate the 260-day agrarian year with alignments to dates in February and October, as seen in the MiddlePreclassicE-Groupat Nakbe(Avenietal. 2003:Table1). 
The Middle Preclassic E-Group at Cival is typical of these constructions, characterized by bedrock knolls forming the western and east­ern structures, with the western side modi.ed into a low platform with stairs (only partially excavated) and the eastern side modi.ed into an elongated platform(Figure1;Estrada-Belli 2006:63; 2011:74, 78–79, 82–83, Figure 4.1; 2016). Near the eastern range structure, ajade cache with a post marked the centerline of the platform and an axial line of 92o azimuth betweenthe easternand westernstructures.Fran­ciscoEstrada-Belli(2011)concludes that the92° alignment mayhavebeen used to mark solar posi­tions synchronized with the agricultural season divided into four parts at the equinoxes and solar zeniths. 
True equinox orientations witha90° azimuth (March 20/21 and September 22/23) are uncommon. More often orientations mark the quarter days (March 23 and September 21), falling halfway between the solstices (Šprajc 2015; Šprajc and Sánchez Nava 2012, 2013). It was probably easier to divide the number of days betweenthetwosolsticesthanto determine the exact date of the equinox. At the solstices, thesun seemsto “pause” beforeit movesaway from its northern and southern extremes on the horizon, making the solstices easier to observe than the equinoxes. 
When formal constructionsbegantobeadded totheE-Group’srange structure,the.rstphase was usually a single elevated building at the center,asatTikal,Nakbe,Wakna,andElMirador (Hansen 1998:66). The early E-Group at Tikal in theMundo Perdido complex (5C-54-5)began around 700–600B.C.withalow platformtothe west bearingradial stairs and an elongated range structuretothe east. The centralbuilding added subsequently is aligned to sunrise on February 24 and October 18, suggesting a link with the agrarian year (discussed below), according to Šprajcet al.(2013:1069,Table1;but seeAveni et al. 2003:174,Table1 forsomewhat different dates). During the Late Preclassic two more buildings were addedtomarkthesolstices(Aveni et al. 2003:174, Table1; Laporte and Fialko 1990:Figures 3.9, 3.11, 1995). 
In addition to changes in the con.guration of E-Groups over time, their evolution shows changesin function.Along processoftransfor­mationfor theGroupE ofUaxactunisevident. Initially, duringthe Late Preclassic, theE-Group was a working observatory with a pyramid (E­7sub-1)facing an elongated platform to the east that marked both equinoxes and the solstice extremes. Later remodeling made the align­ment astronomically nonfunctional. As Stanis­law Iwaniszewski (2002:510–511) points out, after the three temples were added to the range structure, ca. A.D. 240–550, the direct sight line of the sun on the solstices and equinoxes was obstructed. By then, the power center at Uaxactun had shifted from Group E to Group A, which becamethe focal point forroyal rituals (Aveni 2003:161–162). 
The declineofE-GroupsasafocusofMaya architecture is notable between 300 B.C. and 
A.D. 150, when theTriadicArchitectural Style associated with the rise of divine kingship became dominant (Estrada-Belli 2011:49, 56, 68, 76–77, 144; Hansen 1998, 2013:157–160).This change seemsrelatedtotheoriginofMaya state-level society during a period when the Long Countwasinthe processofformation. 
NeartheendofthePreclassic,manyE-Groups were either abandoned or modi.ed for other purposes.TheE-GroupatCivalwaslast modi.ed around A.D. 100 and thereafterwas left to decay (Estrada-Belli 2011:64–65).Other E-Groups at sites likeTikal and Calakmul were transformed into stages forroyal ritualsinthe EarlyClassic (Dowd 2015). ManyE-Groups were maintained for use in public gatherings during the Early Classic(Doyle 2012:363).These “modi.ed” E-Groups datingfromthe Late PreclassictoEarly Classicwere apparentlyalsousedforritualscom­memorating longer periods of time, especially theKatuncycle,aperiod approximating20years (Aimers and Rice 2006:87, 90–92; Estrada-Belli 2011:79–80).

suggest that Tzolkin day names were probably used as early as 600 B.C. in the Maya area (Justeson 1989:79).EricThompson(1972:21– 23) argued for a Highland Maya origin for the 20 day names, but most scholars now concur that the 260-day calendar probably originated in theOlmec area.DavidStuart(2011:36–37) notes that although Olmec dates in the ritual calendar are not preserved, thewidespread distributionof the 260-day calendar suggestsitwasdeveloped by theOlmec “mother culture.” 
Fewif any recordsof calendar dates survive at Olmec sites, but the ritual calendar may appear there around 900–700 B.C. (Justeson 1989:79; Rice 2007:45). Olmec symbols rep­resenting pseudo-glyphs are apparent on the Cascajal block, a monument found near San Lorenzo, but no dates are evident (Rodríguez Martínez et al. 2006). La Venta Stela 13 (“the Ambassador”) has glyph-like symbols, includ­ing possibly the number one, but no speci.c day signs can be identi.ed (Lacadena 2009). The range of dates proposed for Stela 13 (600–400 B.C.) places it contemporary with early Oaxacan inscriptions (Milbrath 1979:41, Table2). 
By 600–400 B.C., a count of 260 days was recorded with 20 different named days in the Valley of Oaxaca (Marcus 1992:41). The .rst unequivocal evidence of the combined use of the 365-day calendar with the 260-day calendar appearsinCalendar Round dates at theZapotec site of MonteAlban. On MonteAlban Stela 12, the yearbearer 4 Wind paired with the day 8 WaterformsaCalendar Round read as 594 B.C. (Edmonson 1988:20–21).Inscriptions on Stelae 12 and 13 also show the earliest evidence of yearbearers, if we discount the dubious Olmec example cited by MunroEdmonson(1988:21). These early Zapotec dates are “Type II” year-bearers, comparabletoyearbearersinthe K’iche’ Maya system and thoseusedbythe EarlyClassic Maya (Ik, Manik, Eb, and Caban; Edmonson 1988:8–9;Tedlock 1992:89–92).Monthglyphs were originally identi.ed on MonteAlban Stelae 12 and 13, based ona notation(GlyphW) that appearsininscriptions with numberslarger than 13 (Marcus 1992:38–41; Prem 1971:119), but other scholars have concluded that Glyph W remains undeciphered,even thoughacalendrical function seems likely(Urcid 2001:273; Whit­taker 1992:18). 
Stuart(2011:38) points out that Maya hiero­glyphicwritingwith calendricsisasold as 300 
B.C. Mural texts at San Bartolo dating around 300–200 B.C. are only partially readable, and anearlyversionofAhauisusedasa title rather thanadaysign (Saturnoetal. 2006:1282).Stuart (2005a:4–6, Figure3)identi.esa3Ikyearbearer date at San Bartolo, estimated to fall some­where between 131 and 27 B.C., representing theseatingofPop(0Pop),the .rstMaya month. The actual month glyph is not recorded at San Bartolo,but an understandingoftheHaabcycle (18x20+ 5)is implicitin Stuart’sinterpretation. San Bartolo may also record an early Katun­ending date(255 B.C.),if MarioGiron-Ábregon (2013:9–10) is correct in proposing that a stone blockinthemural complex recordstheKatun5 Ahau (7.5.0.0.0). 
John Justeson and colleagues(1985:76, n. 32) suggested that the Maya Long Count calendar wasinvented duringKatun 7.6.0.0.0(255–235 B.C.), beginning on the day1Imix and ending on11 Ahau, whichwas the.rstKatun created according to the Chilam Balam of Chumayel. They also noted that 4 Ahau 8 Cumku may have become important as a starting point of the Maya Long Count because this Calendar Round datewasaTun endingin 7.2.7.0.0around 300 B.C. 
Early texts from the Maya area and neigh­boring zones apparently lack monthglyphs,but they do record the 260-day calendar, and the yearbearer identi.ed at San Bartoloindicates that the Haab was known by the Late Preclassic. Victoria Bricker(1982:102–103) suggests that theHaab .rst developed ca. 550 B.C. when the Maya names for rainy season months appear to be correlated with the proper season and 0 Pop occurred on the winter solstice. More speculatively, Rice(2007:47, 57, 62–63) argues that the Haab is perhaps as old as 2060 B.C., when 0 Pop also coordinated with the winter solstice (as in 550 B.C.), and she suggests that the 52-year Calendar Round combining the 260-day calendar with the 365-day year developed as early as 1650 B.C. It remains uncertain when and wherethe Haab and Tzolkin developed.

Geographic Origin Point of the Haab and 
Tzolkin 

The idea of identifying a speci.c site as the origin point of the Haab seems to be based on faulty premises. Vincent Malström (1991) incorrectly used the Postclassic date(1Pop) for the beginning of the year in Preclassic times and then later revised his argument to begin the yearonthesummersolstice(Malström 1997:64), contrary to themore likelypropositionthat the year originallybeganonthe winter solstice. 
A stronger case for the geographical origin point of the Tzolkin has been made based on linkstoalocalewherethe datesforthetwosolar zenithsmarka260-day interval.Thisidea, origi­nally proposedby Zelia Nuttall(1904:497–498), wasrecentlygivenameasureofsupportbyStuart (2011:153).Malström(1997:50–53, Figures 9– 10) proposedthattheTzolkinoriginatedatIzapa (14o8’N), borderingthe Maya area, becausethis site has two solar zeniths spaced at 260-day intervals, with thesecond onefallingonAugust

B.C. at Izapa, when 1 Imix, the starting point of the Maya Tzolkin, coincided with the local solar zenith on August 13. He also links the August13dateto4Ahau8Cumku,the “calendar creation date,” becauseitfalls on 13.0.0.0.0in theLong Count calendar,making thebeginning of the Baktun cycle on August 13, 3114 B.C. (Gregorian). The lack of Long Count records from Izapa makes this theory problematic and there appearstobe only one survivingTzolkin date(6DeathonMiscellaneous Monument 60; Justeson 1988;Rice 2007:116).Malströmused the 584,285 correlation,butinthe 584,283 corre­lation(discussed below),4Ahau8Cumkufalls onAugust11,which compromiseshisargument. Bordering the Lowland Maya area at 14°20’ N, El Baul and Takalik Abaj (formerly Abaj Takalik)bothhaveazenithdateonAugust15and very early Maya calendar inscriptions(Table1; Edmonson 1988:120).The zenith passage dates, however,donotshowa260/105daysplit.Ingen­eral,the geographicexplanationfor theoriginof theTzolkinatanyspeci.c latitude remainsweak. On the other hand, the 260-day calendar does re.ect an interval related to the Mesoamerican maizecycleinthe Maya area. 


Solar Observations and Subdivisions of the Calendar 
The 260-day Tzolkin may have developed from a natural subdivision of the solar year relating to agriculture.The 105-day interval fromApril to August has been described as the growing season (Peterson 1962:186–187),but theMaya agricultural season actually spans 260 days, a period referred to as the agrarian year (Rice 2007:35–36; see also Milbrath 1999:15, 59). Objections have been raised that the theory explaining the origin of the 260-day calendar in terms ofagricultural cycles does not account forvariationsin thelengthof the growingsea­son that depend on altitude (Earle and Snow 1985:212).Nonetheless, the 260-day agricultural cycle is preserved today in both the lowlands and highlands. A span of 260 days represents asubdivisionof themaizecycleinto13 setsof 20 days, surviving today in the maize cycle of theTzeltal(Stross 1994:29–31), and the 260­day agricultural cycle is also recorded among other Maya groups (Guiteras-Holmes 1961:33; Milbrath 1999:15, 59–62; Tedlock 1992). Fur­thermore, as noted above, orientations in the Maya area that establish a .xed 260-day period between February and October help demonstrate a focus on the agrarian year, and alignments marking 20-day intervals before and after the solar zenith re.ect an interest in subdividing the 260-day agricultural period. Subdivisions of the agrarian year are also evident in clusters of architectural orientations in theMaya Lowlands correspondingtoafour-partdivisionofthemaize cultivationcycle, with preparationofthe plotsin February, planting in April-May, .rst fruits in August, and the harvest in October-November (González-García and Šprajc 2016:199–200). 
There are variations in practices depending on altitude, but generally the pattern of rain­fall determines when the main crop is planted. Although theremaybe multiple plantings,there is considerable uniformityinthelowlands,with the main crop planted at the onset of the rainy season, around the .rst solar zenith (Milbrath 1999:13).InYucatán, somefarmersriskanearly planting(tikin muk) during April, in hopes of early rainfall,butthe main crop(xnuk nal)is plantedinMaythroughJuneto coincidewiththe

rainyseason, whichruns through October.There isarepeatof plantinginJune through Augustto take careofanyshortcomingsinthecrop caused by dry weather or pests (Terán and Rasmussen 1994:127, 205–207).The pattern along the coast of Belize seems to be the same, with rainfall beginning in May, but there is enough rain for a second crop to be planted in the alluvial soils beginning in November, and this extra crop is harvested during the dry period that spans from Januarythrough April(Iwaniszewski 2002:506). In some other Maya areas it is also possible to plant a second crop during the dry season, but generally the second crop is planted around July in the midst of the rainy season, as is the practice in Yucatán and among the Ch’orti’, whoseterritory spans from eastern Guatemalato Honduras (Estrada-Belli 2011:79; Girard 1962; Milbrath 1999:13–14, Plate1). 
According to Raphael Girard, the Ch’orti’ begin their 365-day year and a .xed 260-day agricultural calendaronNewYear’sday (Febru­ary8),but becausetheir calendar year is said to start with the .rst visible crescent moon, there seems to be some .exibility for the beginning date(Girard 1962:3–15, 55, 76, 328–342).Girard (1962:340,n.21) notedthattheCh’orti’ agricul­tural calendar is like that recorded in Yucatán by DiegodeLanda, withabeginning dateof1 ImixfallinginFebruary(Tozzer 1941:151–152). Critics of Girard’s work have questioned how theCh’orti’ couldrelate1Imixtothebeginning of their agricultural count on February 8, not only because the Tzolkin does not have a .xed relationship to the solar year, but also because other ethnographershave not foundevidenceof the survival of the Tzolkin among the Ch’orti’ (Starr 1951:263, 265).Eventhough theCh’orti’ do not use day signs in the Tzolkin, Girard’s datasuggesttheymaintainedacountof260days using 52-day sets and multiplesof20days. 
TheCh’orti’ 260-day agricultural count starts during the dry season with preparation of.elds for 80 days, a period subdivided at the March equinox into two 40-day periods. The 80-day period ends on the .rst solar zenith on May 1, coinciding with the onset of the rainy season, whentheplantingbegins.Thenacountof52days leadsupto thesummersolstice(June21 or 22), followedbyanother 52-day periodthat includes theDíadeSantiago(July25),whichmarksabrief halt in rains associated with canícula (a brief midsummer drought). The second 52-day set ends on thesecond solar zenith on August 12/13 (Girard 1962:250–253, 257–258, table facing 328). The remainder of the .xed agricultural count is used to plant a second crop shortly after the ears of the .rst crop are doubled over, which keeps the birds from eating the kernels and rainfall from rottingofthe maize cobs.The second crop, plantedin July,is cultivated during a periodthat includes thefall equinox,a timeof maximumrainfall,but doublingthe earsof this second cropis not necessary becausebythe time the maize matures, the rain has ceased (Girard 1962:265–268). Harvesting begins in October, and Girard notes that on October 25 the .xed 260-day agricultural count ends withamidnight ceremony. The residual period of 105 days in the yearis consideredtobea periodof restthat completes the year,ending witha.ve-day period (February 3–7) directly beforetheNewYear. 
In the mountains of Guatemala, the K’iche’ year-end events seem to take place just before a time of heightened agricultural activity, as they do among the Ch’orti’ (Tedlock 1992:35, 189–190). Taking advantage of the mist and fog that retard evaporation, mountain maize is planted beginning in March and harvested in December, with the agricultural cycle spanning 260 days. March is also the month of the NewYear when thenew Mamor yearbeareris installed—a Tzolkin date that names the year. The relationship between the 260-day count and the agricultural season echoes the pattern seen among the Ch’orti’, living hundreds of miles away, and thefact that the yearbearerfalls near thebeginning of the 260-day agricultural count is useful in designating a span of 260 days. 
The yearbearercycle has implications forthe early calendar because it indicates a division of the year into two sections of 260 and 105 days. The same division of the year into 260­and 105-day periods is evident in a number of orientations documented in the Maya area and beyond (Aimers and Rice 2006:88; Aveni 2001:228–229; Šprajc 2000:409). Many align­mentsfacingtothe eastintheMayaLowlands seem to mark intervals of 260 and 105 days, with subsetsof13and20 days,oralternatively,

intervals of240 and 125 days (González-García and Šprajc 2016:196–197, Table 9; Šprajc and Sánchez Nava 2012:984). 
Šprajc(2000)notes that orientations atTeoti­huacan also suggesta260-daycyclebeginningin February,with alignmentstoaprominentpeakon the eastern horizon marking the dates February 11 and October 29 (see also Iwaniszewski 2005). These dates re.ect measurementstaken from the summit of the Pyramid of the Sun, and those takenfromthebasedifferbyonlyaday (Šprajc 2001:226–229, Tables 5.38, 5.39). Alignment at the base facing east mark the rising sun on February 10 and October 30, and the setting sun to the west on April 30 and August 13. Šprajc concludes that thesefour datesdivide the agricultural season in quarters, beginning with preparations forplantingin early February, then planting with the onset of the rains (late April or early May), followed in mid-August by the .rst earsofmaize, and then thebeginningof the main harvest in late October. The Teotihuacan alignmentsinvolveamountainous horizon,but Šprajc and colleagues(2009:88–90,Table2)note thatintheMayaarea,witha.at horizon,thesame groupof dates correspondstoa14° orientation like that found in Preclassic El Mirador and Yaxnohcah, sites characterized by alignments markingthe dates February12and October 30. Like the Teotihuacan alignments, these dates de.nea 260-day periodthat Šprajc describes as an observational calendar related to agriculture, likethat survivingtoday among theMaya. 
The Puuc-Maya site orientations seem to be distributedintotwo groups:the25° group trans­latingintoawinter solsticesunrisealignmentand a14° group more closelyrelatedtoTeotihuacan (Aveni 2002; Aveni et al. 2003). The 14° east-of-north group marksalignmentsthat areat 20­day intervals from the solar zenith, and Aveni and Hartung (1986:18–19, Table 3) also note that the14° alignmentwould coincide with dates in February and October,important dates in the agricultural calendar spanning 260 days. They proposeahypothetical solarorientation calendar centered on the zenith passage dates at different latitudes in the Maya area, with alignments focusingonthe horizon positionofthe sunonthe zenith passage date, or intervalsof20or40days before and afterthe zenith datethat mark setsof 20 days useful in recording subdivisions of the agricultural cycle. A similar 14° orientation is found at Late PreclassicT’isilinQuintana Roo, wherethemain sacbé is alignedto sunriseinmid-February and late October(Vadala 2009), recall­ingtheEl Mirador alignments,and T’isilalsohas awintersolsticealignment (25° orientation) like theE-GroupatEl Mirador. 
An agrarian year of 260 days beginning in February and ending in October mayhave been widespread early on in theLowland Maya area. Aveni(2012) suggests that the .xed count of 260 days predates the solar-based cycle of 365 days, and this count was used for the period of subsistence activities. This .xed agricultural cycleof260 dayswasprobablymeasured using day names that developed from a count of 20 used to subdivide thesolar year.Bythe Middle Preclassic, tracking the solar positions using E-Groups helped to formulate more detailed subdivisionsofthe agriculturalcycleinrelation to thesolar year.Bythe Late Preclassicmultiple calendarcyclesdeveloped,andthesolarand agri­cultural cycles were subsumed in the complex workings of the Maya Long Count calendar of the Classic period. Throughout the Preclassic and Classic, the Tzolkin was probably used to calculatethe .xed agriculturalcycle, so that any dateinthe Tzolkin couldbegin the agrarian year, and the agricultural cycle would end when that date repeated again 260 days later. 


Early Long Count Inscriptions 
The earliestMaya inscriptions recordthe Tzolkin and possiblyalsothe yearbearercycle. The 365­day Haab mayhaveoriginally coordinated with the seasonal cycles, but as the Preclassic drew to a close it became subordinate to the Long Count, which provided a more precise record of time.In theLong Count,the base unitisthe day itself,butthe primaryintervals aremultiples of 20 days.The Long Count calendar combined manycycles,including theBaktun(20x20x360 days),theKatun(20x360 days),theTun(18x 20 days), and theUinal (20 days). 
An important considerationinanydiscussion of the early calendar is the correlation factor, a coef.cient added to the Long Count date to obtain the equivalent date in the European

calendar. The 584,285 correlation, originally proposedbyEric Thompsonin1972andrevived by FloydLounsbury(1982, 1983), is generally referred to as the GMT correlation. Although GerardoAldana(2011, 2015:12–17) has ques­tioned the GMT correlation and disputes sup­portingevidence fromtheTikal lintels,Douglas Kennett and colleagues(2013:4) conclude that theTikal lintels were probably carvedbyremov­ing the exterior wood (the more recent wood), so theradiocarbon dates assessedwith Bayesian modelling help con.rm the GMT correlation. Of course, this evidence cannot be used to distinguish between variants of the GMT that adjust dates by only a few days or weeks. 
For the general discussion of E-Groups in relation to the developing calendar, it is not essentialtoknowtheexact correlationfactor,but it does becomeimportant when tyingastronom­ical events with speci.c dates on monuments. In an analysis of a possible solar eclipse record on Poco Uinic Stela 3, a 584,286 correlation (584,285 + 1 day) has been proposed (Mar­tin and Skidmore 2012), but there are several other possibleexplanations forthis date(Daniel Graña-Behrens, personal communication 2012). Astronomyalso .gures prominentlyinthe corre­lationproposedbyJusteson(2010;see also Kauf­man and Justeson 2001)for the Isthmus region, an area wherethe earliest completeLong Count inscriptionisfound atTres Zapotes(Table1). He suggests that an Epi-Olmec correlationfactor displaced themonthsby20 days (584,285 -20 days = 584,265), which makes the Long Count dates onLa Mojarra Stela1 alignwith speci.c astronomicalevents, includingasolar eclipseand aVenus elongation.Aveni(2001:167, Figure65) supports this interpretation of the astronomical events,butitshouldbe noted thatVenus elonga­tions probablywere not signi.cantin theMaya records (Bricker and Bricker 2011:39), and the solar eclipse glyph is unlike ones seen in later texts. 
Using the Epi-Olmec correlation factor of 584,265, Tres Zapotes Stela C is interpreted as a record of a lunar eclipse followed by an almost total eclipse (Justeson et al. 1985:75, n. 31; Pool 2007:252, 307, n.1).LaMojarra Stela 1,amonument fromVeracruz, hasaLong Count in A.D. 143, recorded as 8.5.3.3.5 13 Snake (Table1; Kaufman and Justeson 2001:2.34– 2.35). The month patron is incorporated in the ISIG (Initial Series Introductory Glyph) with a Tun sign directly below it, and the Tzolkin date appears at the end of the column. This Long Count inscription (A1-9) and a second one (M8-16) have been linked toVenusevents separatedby theinterval of13.6.2(4,802 days), and the .rst interval (H3–I4) links two eclipse events, whereas the second (I5–J5) leads to a solstice date, usingthe 584,265 correlationfactor (Kaufman and Justeson 2001:2.37–2.38, 2.71). Problems with the astronomical events cited on themonumenthavealreadyhavebeen noted,and until moreof thescriptis understood, cautionis required(Houston and Coe 2003). Scholarssuch as Prudence Rice(2007)and Martha Macri and LauraStark(1993)use the 584,283 correlation (GMT - 2 days) for the La Mojarra texts, the same correlationused herein Table1,butthe case remains open on the correlation in the Isthmus region, which may be displaced by 18 to 20 days. 
Thompson’s(1960)long-standing correlation (584,283) used hereisvigorously championedby Harvey andVictoria Bricker(2011:90–99) and MunroEdmonson(1988), and is also supported byBarbaraTedlock(1992),based on theTzolkin cyclesurviving among theK’iche’.The precise correlation factor used is not essential to the broader discussion of the relationship of E-Groupstothedevelopmentofthe calendar,butto providespeci.c datesin Table1itwasnecessary to select a speci.c correlation factor, with the caveatthat some dateshave alternatereadingsor different correlationfactors. 
WhethertheLong Count .rstdevelopedinthe Maya area and diffused to Mixe-Zoque sitesin theIsthmus area or viceversa remains uncertain (Justesonetal. 1985:42).Cycle7(Baktun7) monuments are often linked with the Mixe-Zoque language area and calendar innovations may have passed from there to the Lowland Maya. Stela C at Tres Zapotes is the earliest example of a Long Count inscription with a complete column of .ve numbers (Table1). An early example of the yearbearer (6 Ben) is recorded in the Long Count on Chiapa de CorzoStela2(Coe 1976),sometimes datedto36

conditiontheBaktunand Katuninscriptionshave tobe reconstructed(Table1).Furthermore,some scholars place this monument more than two centuries later (8.7.3.2.13 or A.D. 182; Riese 1988:68,Table1). 
The most ancient Maya Long Count dates seemto comefromTakalikAbajandElBaulon thePaci.c Slope, borderingtheLowland Maya area.Takalik Abaj Stela2has been described as a Cycle 7 monument (Coe 1957:605), with an estimated date between 7.6.0.0.0 and 7.16.0.0.0, falling between 235 and 18 B.C. (Graham et al. 1978:89–91).Nonetheless, high de.nitiondigi­talimaging indicates that theoriginal inscription wasactuallyCycle8,andtwoofthethreedotsin theBaktun inscriptionhave .aked off(Doering and Collins 2011). The calendar inscription on El Baul Stela1is.rst century,butitsexact date remainstentative. Giventhe Tzolkininscription of 12 Eb,Michael Coe(1957:603) reconstructs the date asA.D.37(7.19.15.7.12; Table1). Both monumentsare sometimes consideredtobe Izapan in style(Guernsey 2006:46–47, Figures 3.3b, 3.4), but they may be a variant of the early Maya style. An even earlier date has been proposed for Takalik Abaj Monument 11, a boulder carved witha columnofglyphs and an inscription possibly datingtoCycle6(Middle Preclassic), basedonaTzolkindate(11Ik)that mayhaveanInitial Seriesglyph attached,butthe only legible number is 11 (Graham and Porter 1989). This site also hasaMiddlePreclassicE-Group thatwasprobablyusedtopegsolar dates beforethe calendarwasmorefullydevelopedin Cycle7.Aninterestintracking solareventsat this site is also evident in a boulder with relief-carved footprints that are aligned to the winter solsticesunrise(Altar46; Hatch 2010;Milbrath 2017:Figure1). 
Cycle 8 Long Count dates are more clearly documented at Takalik Abaj, but interpreting these dates is not without controversy, because the texts lack period glyphs and are partially effaced. Stela 5 records dates in two side-by­side glyphic columns(Figure2;Table1), which John Graham and his colleagues(1978:92) read

as 8.4.5.17.11 and 8.2.2.10.5, but they note the Katun inscription is not clear in the right-hand column and the date could be 8.3.2.10.5 (Table1).Ontheotherhand, Justeson(2010:48– 49,2012:834)arguesthatthe notationofzerowas not yet known,sothe zerofor the 20-day Uinal (month)wasomitted, making thelast numberin each columna referencetotheTzolkindateand renderingthe dateas8.4.5.[0].1711Earthquake and 8.3.2.[0].105Coyote.Regardlessof whether this alternatereadingis accepted, thesetwoearly Cycle 8 inscriptions follow Maya Long Count patterns, likeStela1 fromElBaul,placing the beginning of the Baktun cycle on 4 Ahau 8 Cumku. 
TheHaubergStela,an early monument pre­sumably from the lowland Maya area, has an expanded Long Count inscription with a lunar calendar with a nine-day cycle, variously dated to A.D. 197 or A.D. 199 (Bricker and Bricker 2011:720–723, Figure 12-2;Justeson 1989:79), butitmaybemuchlater.Basedonitsstyle, Stuart (2005b:163) dates themonument no earlierthan 
8.15.0.0.0(A.D. 337).Given this uncertainty,I have expanded my discussion of this monument toamorelengthy treatmentin another publica­tion(Milbrath 2017). 
Oneofthe markersofthe EarlyClassic period 
(A.D. 
250/300–600) in theMaya Lowlands is the useofthe fullydevelopedLong Count calendar with period glyphs. Tikal Stela 29 remains the earliest known stela with an ISIG Long Count documented from a Maya site in the lowlands. Stela29lacks thelower partof the inscription, which would have had the Haab and Tzolkin recorded at the bottom. TheLong Count dateis reconstructed as 8.12.14.8.15, equivalent to July 6, A.D. 292 in both the Julian and Gregorian calendars (Jones and Satterthwaite 1982:Figure 29).The ISIG month patronisZip, and theISIG has theTun sign,butitlacks theT25(ka)element that became common later (Coe 1976:11). It may have been erected in the Mundo Perdido E-Group during the Manik 1 ceramic phase 

(A.D. 
250–300), when the complex had a radial pyramid and three structures on the range to the east(Laporte 1987;Laporte and Fialko1990:46, Figure3.13).

in theLunar Series(Thompson 1960:Figure 34, no. 25). The image probably shows the acces­sion of a ruler. The plaque may be from the tomb beneathMundo Perdido Structure5D-86-6 (Laporte1987).Asinthe caseofStela29,this links an early inscriptiontoTikal’s E-Group. 
By the time these inscriptions were carved, E-Groups like the one at Tikal had lost any function in terms of solar observations, having beenconvertedintoastageforroyal rituals.Some Classic inscriptions record solar events, espe­cially thesolstices (Milbrath 1999:64–65; Šprajc and Sánchez Nava 2013:334),but they seem to be subordinate to more complex astronomical cyclesand recordsof historicaleventsinthelives of rulers. Although Classic period architecture continued to be characterized by astronomical alignments, the most common orientations are to dates in February and October, months coin­ciding with theinitial phases of the agricultural cycle and thebeginning of the harvest (Sánchez and Šprajc 2015:Tables 7–10). 


The Role of E-Groups in Formulating the Early Calendar 
The .xed 260-day count surviving today in the Maya agricultural cycle is apparently quite ancient and mayhaveoriginated asasubdivision of the 365-day year, .rst tracked by marking the solstices in the earliest E-Groups. Tzolkin records appear earlierthantheHaabintheMaya area, but 20-day sets in the Maya Haab most probablydeveloped in tandem with the20 day signsoftheTzolkin,andtheTzolkin itselfmay have evolved from observing the maize cycle in relation to solar positions noted in early E-Groups. 
The maize cycle probably inspired Mesoamerican calendar priests to develop a 260-day calendar that coordinated with the agriculturalcycle.The 260/105splitoftheyearis codi.ed in the yearbearer cycle. The yearbearer appearsintheMaya areaatSan Bartoloasearly as 131 B.C., and even earlier in Oaxaca (600– 400 B.C.). The early development of the pattern subdividing the year into a 260-day agricultural period and 105-day residual, non-agricultural season, mayhave been widespread. 
The early calendar record from San Bartolo uses a yearbearer cycle that signals a division of 260 days in the solar year in the Southern LowlandMaya area.Thetwoannual occurrences of the yearbearer would mark a 260/105 split in the 365-day year. It seems likely that the 260-day period originally was visualized as a subdivisionof the 365-day year.Measuringthese intervals in the solar year initially involved E-Group architectural orientations keyed to the seasonal cycle, dating back to 1000 B.C. in the Maya area, well before calendar records were recorded on monumental art. Observations of thesolarcyclewereinitially importantin early E-Groups, but as the precision of the calendar developed the apparent interest in tracking the solstices declined. 
EarlyEpi-Olmec records oftenuse themonth patronsystemdevelopedin theLatePreclassic to indicate positions in the 365-day cycle before the Haab dates were incorporated in the Long Count inscriptions. These texts lack true Haab notations, and the same is true of early Cycle 8dates from thePaci.c Slope. Thesetexts also lack the month patron, which seems to make its earliest appearance in the Isthmus region. Nonetheless, early calendar records from the Paci.c slope of Guatemala couldbe considered formativetothe Maya Long Count. 
Because the Long Count was not useful in recording the tropical year, solar observations continued to be important (Šprajc 1995:598). Alignments marking intervals of 260 days that were useful in tracking the agrarian year are evident in both the Preclassic and Classic (González-García and Šprajc 2016). There is evidence that the 260-day agrarian year was timed by the Tzolkin during the Postclassic (Milbrath 1999:60–62), and it clearly survives in modern times among theK’iche’.With minor adjustments to correlate with lunar phases, this 260-day agrarian count is .xed within the year, and canbe calculated usingthe Tzolkin, because whatever day begins the agrarian year will also end the cycle. 
Early records from the Maya area show the yearbearers, a cycle useful in subdividing the year into setsof 260 and 105 days.The agrarian yeardeveloped earlierthanthe yearbearercycle, butthis calendarcycleno doubt helped to record

thetwosegmentsofthe year.Architectural align­ments helped codify the continued importance of the 260-day agricultural cycle and lend support to its long-standing link with the ritual calendar.
