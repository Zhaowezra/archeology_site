past two years, and she deserves the thanks of all of us for her continuing herculean efforts that, among other things, have helped greatly to overcome the wrench of editorship transition. The transition is completed with this issue, and I now hand the last few centimeters of the reins to my capable succes­sors, Gary Feinman and Linda Manzanilla, with my heartfelt wishes for good assistants, good authors, and, above all, good luck. In closing I offer my final thanks to all of LAA's readers for their interest, their patience, and their support over these past three years.
