This beautiful and hefty tome (weighing in at over 4 pounds!) is the product of a 2000 Dumbarton Oaks col­loquium exploring one of the most contentious issues in Mesoamerican archaeology: the relationship between Chichen ltza in Yucatan and Tula in Central Mexico. Similarities in art, architecture, and artifacts at the two sites, as well as ethnohistoric tales about a journey by an individual known as the "Feathered Serpent," led scholars a hundred years ago to propose that Toltecs from Tula conquered Yucatan in the tenth century A.D. and established themselves at Chichen Itza. This book sets out to overturn this view, and the authors generally agree that the "old" (Kepecs, p. 133), "traditional" (Kowalski, p. 251), and "orthodox" (Gillespie, p. 111) model of a Toltec conquest of Chichen is simplistic and outdated. Almost in concert, these authors argue for a more nuanced perspective that does not focus simply on these two sites but rather considers them within a broader Mesoamerican perspective. As described by Kowalski (p. 251), "Chichen ltza's and Tula's relation­ship reflects their mutual participation in broader trade networks that involve the exchange of both material goods and ideological concepts that supported the power and authority of regional elites emerging during the Ter­minal Classic and Early Postclassic periods." The vol­ume features a dozen chapters, plus the editors' weighty overview introduction (70 pages long), a concluding discussion, and a somewhat anecdotal afterword. 
In their introduction, editors Kristan-Graham and Kowalski summarize the history of this persistent issue in Mesoamerican studies. Susan Gillespie starts off the chapters proper with a lengthy review of the history of debate over the Tula/Chichen problem, essentially cov­ering the same ground just covered in the introduction but with a decidedly anti-positivist and postmodern perspective. Susan Kepecs then follows with her rela­tively short contribution, in which she presents the results of her own archaeological research conducted on the saltworks of the Chikinchel region of northern Yucatan. Kepecs uses these data to cast the Chichenffula debate through the lens of World Systems Theory (WST). WST is a recurring theme in this vol­ume, referenced by no less than four other papers, and it has become quite popular among Mesoamericanists who are seeking alternatives to empire and migration to explain evidence of interregional interaction. This usage is ironic, in that WST, as originally propounded by Wallerstein, deals with the socioeconomic situation of empires. While it is not my position here to criticize the use of WST by archaeologists, it is pertinent to note that identification of a world system in Epiclassic Mesoamerica in no way impacts the debate over whether there was a Toltec conquest of Chichen Itza or not. 
Peter Schmidt's article on his recent excavations at Chichen Itza is one of the volume's highlights. A major problem with traditional perspectives on the Tula/Chichen debate has been an overemphasis on the­ory rather than data, and this article goes a long way to returning the debate to an even keel. Nikolai Grube and Ruth Krochok provide an epigraphic analysis of the texts of Chichen and while most of the "new" readings and interpretations presented here are already familiar to the epigraphic community, they will be appreciated by the wider community of archaeologists and histori­ans. Providing an art history perspective, Kowalski's lengthy article examines the art of Uxmal and Chichen Itza, and concludes that the elite who commissioned this art were fundamentally Maya, although utilizing and adapting some foreign traits. While Kowalski provides one of the most nuanced and detailed analyses of the so-called "Toltec" art of Yucatan, some of his arguments seem strained. For example, Kowalski claims that

Chichen Itza's "political rulership signaled their basi­cally Maya ethnicity and worldview by regularly incor­porating references to traditional Maya deities, symbols, and creation myths into their artistic iconography" (pp. 262-263). However, if one extends this argument to Ptolemaic Egypt, for example, one would be forced to conclude that the Ptolemaic dynasty was fundamentally Egyptian, something we know historically not to have been the case. Clearly not all of these arguments for a fundamental Maya ethnicity at Chichen Itza obtain. 
Rafael Cobos addresses two main points in his arti­cle. First, he affirms the traditional chronology of con­struction at Chichen Itza, finding that the structures built upon the Gran Nivelaci6n on the northern edge of the site's center postdate the majority of buildings in "Old Chichen" to the south. Cobos also reviews his­torical and archaeological data to reject the argument for a multepal form of rulership, where power was shared among a number of different individuals, in favor of a more traditional kingship with a single sov­ereign ruling over Chichen. The issue of whether a mul­tepal or traditional kingship form of government existed at Chichen is another theme found throughout the book, and there is essentially a consensus among these authors that evidence for the multepal model is now found wanting. David Freidel, one of the authors who first championed the multepal model, accepts this revision in his own chapter, which otherwise largely examines his own archaeological work at Chichen's southern neighbor, Yaxuna. 
George Bey and Bill Ringle address what is arguably the most important issue in the entire Chichen/Tula debate: chronology. Their detailed analysis of the stratigraphy and ceramic chronology associated with Chichen 's Temple of the Warriors and Tula 's Edificio B has been sorely needed and will surely become a foundational source for future research on this topic. One possible problem with their analysis, however, is that comparing the archaeological chronologies of Tula and Chic hen may be like comparing apples and oranges, as their established bases are not the same. While Tula's chronology is based upon a combination of traditional stratigraphy, ceramic dating, and radiocarbon dates, the chronology of Chichen Itza has been established, at least in part, on dating certain structures at the site by associated monuments bearing dates in the Maya cal­endar. When it is possible to compare radiocarbon dates from wooden lintels of structures with dates in the Maya calendar, however, the radiocarbon dates often prove to be significantly earlier than would otherwise be expected, and this problem raises obvious concerns for comparing the histories of Tula and Chichen Itza. 
Dan Healan follows with a discussion of the obsid­ian trade between these two centers. He argues that while Tula may have been trading obsidian, it likely did not directly manage much of the obsidian pro­duction, further emphasizing that if Tula had an empire, it was at best hegemonic. Geoff McCafferty presents his own excavations at the site of Cholula, which for many recent scholars is a much better can­didate than Tula for the ethnohistoric "Toll an," as it was a major pilgrimage center for the cult of the Feath­ered Serpent. Problematic for these arguments, how­ever, is the fact that excavations have uncovered next to no artistic evidence at Cholula for any cult of Quet­zalcoatl, and the ethnohistoric documents suggest that this cult was established at Cholula only after the decline of both Tula and Chichen. Patricia Fournier and Victor Bolanos continue with a discussion of the Epiclassic period in the region around Tula. They note that DNA studies indicate that the Otomf living near Tula since colonial times are genetically related to the people living in the region in Epiclassic times, although osteological data from Tula itself indicate a multiethnic population at this capital. Kristan-Gra­ham concludes the series of chapters with a study of colonnaded halls and sunken plazas at both Tula and Chichen Itza. She suggests that these architectural features derive ultimately from the Chichimeca area to the north of Tula, and that Tula's architecture was derived from models found in a number of different cultural areas of Mesoamerica. 
Michael E. Smith provides a final summary and dis­cussion, in which he raises a number of issues that scholars working on the Chichen/Tula debate would do well to consider. Smith observes that the earlier dating of many of Chichen's buildings, prompted by the most recent scholarship, has lead many scholars to simply assume a primacy for Chichen in the debate before not­ing that a similar redating of Tula may be in order. Smith notes that this possible redating could resurrect the Toltec invasion model, but decides that Gillespie's reanalysis of the ethnohistorical documents upon which this model was originally based makes this unlikely. Not sharing in this near-total skepticism of the historical value of ethnohistoric records, I must admit that after reading this volume I have not been entirely dissuaded from the traditional idea that actual Toltecs from Tula did arrive in Yucatan and were present at Chichen Itza in rulership positions. However, these authors have cer­tainly demonstrated that the issue is much more com­plex than scholars of the early twentieth-century thought. There is obviously much more evidence to uncover, and many more possible interpretations of the data to consider. This collection of articles is certainly not the last word on the subject, but it is the latest and is absolutely essential for anyone considering the issue of interregional interaction in Mesoamerica.
