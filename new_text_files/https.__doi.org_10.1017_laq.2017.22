InprecolonialAndeanarchaeology,specialistsfrequentlydealwithobjectswhosenamesand functionsareunknown.Similarly, earlycolonial documentsfrom theAndesoften mention objects without describing their shapesorfunctions.How canwe articulate thesethree features—names,shapes, and functions—for objectsfromprecolonial and colonial periods?How can we de.ne these objects while takingintoaccount intra-Andean variability? This article addressesthese questions using one sectionfromawell-known documentofthe earlyseventeenth century,the Huarochirí Manuscript.

ost discussions in late precolonial Andean archaeology have focused on what might be called major entities andtheirrelated objects:fromgodsin religionto rulers in politics. Although this focus mayhave allowedfor thedevelopment of clear de.nitions of major divinities and types of sociopolitical organization in the late precolonial Andes, it has led to the neglect of detailed and critical explanationsof theforms,functions, and names of minor entities and objects. But major entities, in the Andes and elsewhere, can only be fully explainedbypaying attentiontotheir component parts;that is,minor entities. Correlatingforms, functions, and names to propose de.nitions or conceptsisa fundamental exercisein narrating the past, but it is a topic that is particularly underdeveloped forthe late precolonial and early colonial periods in the Andes, despite a recent .ourishing of material culture studies among Andeanists. This limitationisespeciallyevident with respect to minor objects or entities, which usually have been assumed, incorrectly, to be uniform across time and space in the Andes. Therefore, while it is necessary to improve the de.nitions and concepts appliedinAndean archaeology, it is also imperative to improve the methodology used to construct these de.ni­tions by incorporating cultural and geographic diversity into the explanations of minor entities and objects. Building upon the critique of a linguist who claimed that scholars have been

proposing de.nitionsof Andean entitieswithout exerting even a minimum of linguistic care (Cerrón 2008:9–10),Isuggestthatin the caseof objects(material culture), trulyinterdisciplinary de.nitions arelacking.By this,Irefer not only to basic linguistic standardsbutalsotoelemental archaeological methods used to relate functions, shapes, and contexts. 
With respect to precolonial Andean objects, assumptions about therelationships between the threefeatures of form,function, and namehave generally been based on ethnographic datafrom the southern Peruvian Andean region without taking into account regional, altitudinal, or latitudinalvariability within theAndeanworld. These limitations partially stem from thefact that a signi.cant number of valuable ethnographic monographs produced between the late 1970s and early 1990s were on speci.c villages in southern Peru(SupplementalText 1).Because of their high quality, but also for political and linguistic reasons,thesemonographshavehadan enormous impacton Andean studiesinthe anglo­phone academy, resultingina southernAndean bias.Archaeologistswhohaveworkedinthe cen­tral and north-centralAndes frequently usethese monographs as theirmainreferences,ignoring, perhaps intentionally or because other studies are less visible, intra-Andean variability (see the observations ofPärssinen 1992:305; Ramón 2008:16; Urbano 1999:xciii, xcvi, xcviii). Fol­lowing this critical approach, this article presents astudyofasingleAndean object:a peripheral and ignored kindof ushnu,anobject documented in the seventeenth century. Such an analysis shows that minor objects can be indispensable for understanding and narratinglateprecolonial and early colonial contexts while being attentive to cultural and social variability in the Andes. Building on previous scholarship, I will also propose a typological approach to the ushnu, useful for explaining any other material item from the Andes, from precolonial times to the present. 


Research Objectives and Documentary Sources 
This article discusses a broad issue using a speci.c case. Thebroad issueisthe association 
of objects(theirforms and functions)with names in late precolonial and early colonial Andean archaeology.Typically,historians (and linguists) come across terms used for certain objects in colonial documents, but in general neither the scholars nor the documents pay close attention to physical aspects such as shape or function. Conversely, through excavation or exploration of museum collections, archaeologists handle objects whose names or functions are not always well de.ned in the Andean literature. In both cases, in order to advance a variety of research questions, the standard procedure has been to analogically survey three main sources of information: early colonial documents, twentieth-century ethnography, and the (pre­colonial)archaeological record(Ramón 2008:7– 16). 
Thespeci.c case analyzed hereisthe single mention of the word husno recorded in the Huarochirí Manuscript(HM).1 This document was produced circa A.D. 1608 and compiles myths and ritual practices of a territory situated intheprovinceof Huarochirí,inthe south-central highlands of Lima, Peru(Figure1). Currently heldinthe Spanish National LibraryinMadrid (No. 3169), this manuscript belonged to the priest FranciscodeÁvila from the parishofSan Damián de Checa, Huarochirí.The information recorded in the document was likely requested byÁvila of thelocal Indian authority(curaca) and scribe, Cristóbal Choquecasa from Checa, to learn more about local religious lore in order to eradicate it in an effective manner. Durston (2007:227–228) attributes to Choquecasa not onlythe transcriptionbut also the authorshipof theHM. TheQuechuaof theHMisthe lengua general (sensu Taylor 2000a [1990]:41–42), which was an of.cial colonial Quechua adapted from a southern Andean dialect of Cuzco origin, although it contains many localisms, or orthographic adjustments related to the local Quechua. Choquecasa was trained in the lengua generaland useditto transcribethe information collected from local informants (Durston 2007:234–236). The HM is unique in Andean colonial literature because its 31 chapters have been translated into seven languages (Dutch, English, French, German, Latin, Polish, and Spanish), making it possible to confront

the different—at times very dissimilar— translations provided for speci.c terms, and thus show the complexity of correlating names and objects in early colonial sources for the purpose of archaeological interpretation. The HM contains two supplements not included in Trimborn’s.rsttranslation(1939)orinGalante’s (1942). Themissing sectionofTrimborn’s.rst translation was published separately in 1941. In the case of the ushnu, while many colonial documents describe its late precolonial and early colonial uses, including its locations and shapes, the HM is special, as it is the only(currently known) reference that includes information about the conditions associated with the making of an ushnu.Moreover, and of signi.cance to this study, no previous analysis of the ushnu has discussed its reference in the HM in detail. 


ArchaeologicalForms and Ethnographic 
Functions 

Before analyzing the speci.c case of the HM ushnu, a brief discussion of formal and func­tional ascription is necessary (Salmon 1982). Three cases from Andean precolonial archaeol­ogyinformtheperspectiveadoptedinthis article. The.rsttwohelpusbuildour approach;thethird shows another option that has been important in Andean studies. The .rst comes from Jorge Zegarra’s notebooks on his excavations of the Middle Horizon and Late Intermediate period contextsatthesiteof Huallamarca,Lima,in1958 (Zegarra 1958). In this document, Zegarra fre­quently associates forms, functions, and names (including Quechua names)when describingthe precolonial artifacts.Forinstance, when dealing withthe contentofTomb44,he describes objects

under number 1029 as “46 needles of various sizes made out of wood like chonta with two pointy ends and 6 pushcas.” Later in the same document Zegarra describes objects 1032–1033 as “two textile tools made out of bones called ruquis,of20 and 17 cms [in length].”Putska is de.ned as “spinning device” by Parker and Chávez (1976), and ruqui as “the bone with whichthey makeatextile more compact [hueso con que tupen]” by González Holguín (1952 [1608];Figure2). 
The second case appears in Morris and Thompson’s(1985:18)bookon theirexcavations at the Inca site of Huanucopampa, Huánuco. Here, when project members were grouping all excavated bones together, a local worker, Teodocio Herrera, noticed that several of the bones were actually weaving tools. Being a weaver, Herrera demonstrated how to weave a poncho using these artifacts. His observa­tions allowed for the reclassi.cation of those bonesasweavingtoolsand—giventhe frequency of these artifacts throughout Huanucopampa— certain areasofthesitecametobeassociatedwith textile production. Thus, the functional ascrip­tion of one tool through ethnographic analogy had important implications forthe interpretation of the entire site. 
Thethird case comes fromLumbreras(1984), who wrote about the relation between function and form, particularly the distinction between function(as structurally linkedtoform) and use (as something more occasional). For instance, we couldsay thata cup’sfunctionisto contain liquids, but we also recognize that the cup could be used to trap an insect or to store beans.Although this proposal has been in.uen­tialamong Andean scholars, Lumbrerassuggests that the archaeologist “who intends to classify objectsbeginning fromthe in.nite possibilities of use that eachof them couldhave, starting, for that purpose, from ethnographical analogies or logical discourses of any kind, is only creating great confusion about the classi.ed materials,” concluding that this muddles “the essential with the phenomenical”(Lumbreras 1984:3;empha­sis added). Following Lumbreras’s reasoning, it is not necessary to pay attention to cultural difference related to regional variation of uses. Classi.cations would merely tell us what we already know, even if this were contradicted by cases such as the two that have been cited, in which functional attribution was only possible because of ethnographic analogies. 
The three cases discussed above are a small representation of a long-running discussion in

Andean archaeology onhowtoassociateforms, functions, and names.Thissortofinquirybegan with theworkofUhle(1903:70, Figure 99) at the archaeological site of Pachacamac, Lima, which demonstrated the functions of the Late Horizon gourds used as containersfor the lime usedin cocachewing. Probablythe most remark­able study of this kind is by Duviols (1979) on stone stelae(huancas) using early colonial documentsand ethnographicevidence. Duviols’s researchextended fromthe interpretationofthe object’s functiontothe de.nitionofthe broader concept, recognizing its potential intra-Andean variability (Supplemental Text 2). Importantly, Duviols considered therelation between ecolog­ical settings and social and cultural changes in thedistinction between quechua and puna when analyzing material culture and objects men­tioned in historical and ethnographic sources. The quechua level, usually between 2,500 and 3,800masl,is particularly suitablefor cultivat­ing grains such as maize. The puna ecological level, thehighestwith permanent human occu­pation, is generally above 3,800 m asl and is characterized by grasslands mostly devoted to herding, with limited agriculture (on the limits between those ecological levels, see Ramón 2008:46–48, 2014:26). In Andean studies, the huari (farmer,sedentary,villager)are recognized as the typical inhabitants of the quechua and the llacuaz (herder, transhumant) as those of the puna (Duviols 1973). The HM is mostly written from a quechua setting, and the llacuaz is identi.ed as other in the text(chapter 19). Thus, the application of ethnographic analogy (consideringusesaslocal functions)allowsusto identify culturalvariability withinalarger region such as theAndes. 
Taken together, the three cases discussed abovedemonstratehowthe applicationofethno­graphic analogy (i.e., considering uses as local functions) can be used to identify cultural vari­ability withinalarger region, such as theAndes. My approach to the ushnu draws on this foun­dation, as well as the three philological opera­tions followedbyTaylor(2000b [1974]:1–2) for translating the HM. First, he uses dictionaries and grammars dating fromthe periodoftheHM to performa comparativedialectological study. Second,heexamines alltheavailable documen­tationonthe rites describedin theHM, mainly fromthe Huarochirí region, to better understand them.Similarly, forthe ushnu,Ireviewed allthe availableethnographicand historical sourcesthat included any variantof theterm and thearchae­ological literature that deals with that subject. Third, assuming that some lexical peculiarities disappeared withthelanguageoftheHM,Taylor triedtoidentifythe meaningsof some obscure termsbyisolating and comparingtheir contexts. In this study, I consider the husno the obscure object to be de.ned. Taylor (2000b [1974]:1, note1) alsoindicated that some passagesofthe HM are dif.cult to understand because of the “blind acceptance”of eitherthetraditionalvalues attributedto some Quechua termssince Christian evangelizationorthe meaningsof thesetermsin the better-known Quechua dialects. In the case of the husno, besides these two issues, we also need to deal with the in.uence of Zuidema’s de.nition, whichisdiscussed below. 
The examples of Huallamarca and Huanu­copampa tell us about the everyday strategies usedin Andean archaeologyto articulateforms, functions, and names.While thearchaeologists working at Huanucopampa used and incorpo­rated the weaver’s suggestion after research was already underway (explicit ethnographic analogy), Zegarra combined archaeology and ethnography from the outset, applying names (and functions) to artifacts based on his ethno­graphic knowledge, albeit without always ref­erencing the source material for his attribu­tions (implicit ethnographic analogy).Anideal procedure—which I try to follow here—would be one of explicit and systematic ethnographic analysis.Thiswouldmean incorporatingall the available ethnographic and historical informa­tion in the project design, including documen­tationofthe sourcesofthe analogies (Perelman and Olbrechts-Tyteca 1989:570, 571, 575). 
Situated between three epochs—pre-Inca, Inca, colonial—and given its extraordinary nar­rative content, the HM is particularly attractive as a source for an examination of how con­cepts are shaped over time, and yet it presents singular dif.culties. The earliest direct prece­dent for the present inquiry is the research by the archaeologist Toribio Mejía. Between 1941 and 1943, Mejía (1943) produced two

Spanish translations of the HM; they included several graphics to clarify spatial and material aspectsof the stories and characters(Figure3). Unfortunately, Mejía never.nished or published this innovative exercise (see also Szemiñski ca. 1988). More recently, other authors have discussed references to material culture in the HM:forexample, Estenssoro (2003:323–332) on rromano and Salomon(1991)ona coin. This kind of study of objects goes beyond disciplinary limitsandis promptedbyresearch questionsthat may onlybeansweredbycombining approaches from ethnography, history, archaeology, and lin­guistics. Building on such previous work, this articleinvestigates theform and functionof the husno made by members ofthe Checa commu­nity(llacta) as they searched for the material manifestation of a sacred being(huaca)called Llocllayhuancupa, as described in chapter 20 of theHM.2 


De.ning Ushnu:Structural andTypological Approaches 
In anexercise comparabletoDuviols’s(1979) huanca study,Zuidema(1989a [1980])sought to de.ne the ushnu (see also Zuidema 1989b [1977/1978], 2004, 2010, 2014). Two years before his classic work on the topic (1989a [1980]), Zuidema published an article on “shaft

tombs” (Zuidema 1989b [1977/1978])inwhich he proposed a link between those structures and the ushnu.The link, whichwaskeytohis concept of ushnu,is based on a single documental refer­encefromOcros,a village situatedinthe current department of Ancash(Hernández Príncipe 2003 [1621]). In that document, the ushnu is de.ned as an arcaduz:awater conduit orpipe(“de un usnu, que es un arcadus, que deshicimos en este lugar”;Hernández Principe 2003 [1621]:745).3 Besides that mention, allofZuidema’sassump­tionsinhisarticle(1989b [1977/1978])regarding that link are based on comparisons: he used documents that do not include either the term ushnu or arcaduz and documents that include one termbutnot theassociation between thetwo elements. Buildingonthe link, Zuidema’smain essayonthe topic(1989a [1980])employs early colonial and ethnographic evidence to explain theprecolonial concept of ushnu.Its arguments haveoriented most,ifnot all, subsequent archae­ological studies of that subject (see, among others, Meddens 1997; Meddens et al. 2014; Monteverde 2010;Pino 2004, 2005, 2010). 
Zuidemabeganby making chronological and regional distinctions, but unlike Duviols, he completely disregarded altitudinal, latitudinal, and typological nuances. He established two main distinctions, a chronological one, between the pre-Inca and Inca ushnu, and a regional one, between what happened in imperialCuzco and other areas of Tahuantinsuyu. In addition, Zuidemadistinguished between what early colo­nial writers saw in that city (and were able to describe)andthe observationsofthosewho came later. Each of these distinctions is crucial for understanding the ushnu in colonial sources such as the HM. Because the testimonies of early authors in Cuzco are useful for understanding the Inca world, but not necessarily the pre-Inca ushnu, Zuidema(1989a[1980]:419–425) turned to ethnography. In Tarma, Junín, in the 1970s, ushnu was described as a place where theground absorbs water(Adelaar 1977:370– 371, 488). According to Zuidema, this natural or almost culturally unmodi.ed element was transformed by the Incas through adding other (structural) elements, such as the platform, at sites outside the city of Cuzco (Zuidema 1989a [1980]:452–453,2014;cf.Farrington2014).The 
early colonial authors described the ushnu in the center of the imperial capital using various terms, including escaño, fuente, pilar,or pila (bench, fountain, pillar, font). It was situated according to astronomical alignments. In light of this formalvariety,Zuidema(1989b [1980]:420) suggestedaconceptual de.nitionofthe ushnu as an axis mundi, a communication point between several spheres (the celestial sphere, the surface of the earth, and the underground). The ushnu was akin to Rome’s mundus, “the most sacred place, a central place, a hole opened once a year”(Zuidema 1989b [1980]:453, 2004:223). Giventhat Zuidema citedRykwert(1985:54– 55) to de.ne mundus, it is worth mentioning that this Polish architect indicated that besides the central mundus in Rome, there were others, including somedevotedtospeci.c deities, such as the mundus for Ceres, an agricultural deity (seeCoarelli 1983:199–226; Deubner 1933). 
Twoquestions arisewith respectto Zuidema’s productionofde.nitionsof precolonialandearly colonial artifacts. First, why should the ethno­graphic material from the second half of the twentieth century be assumed to be equivalent to the pre-Inca? When discussing the ushnu, Zuidema (1989a [1980], 1989b [1977/1978], 2014) suggested a link between the ethno­graphic and thepre-Inca databut did notexplain the reasons that justify the analogy. Second, how should intra-Andean ethnographic variety, or synchronic difference, be handled? While Zuidemawas correct thatitis usefulto compare, when relevant, precolonial and ethnographic data, what should be done when there is wide variability within the ethnographic record, such as the different de.nitions of ushnu in Sup­plemental Text 3? Like Lumbreras, Zuidema focused on commonalities, and his writing does not incorporatemeaningful differences resulting from ethnographic evidence. It is necessary to keep these questions in mind when dealing with the husno of theHM. 
Zuidema’s main audience has been archaeol­ogists, who usually follow a less sophisticated de.nition of ushnu than that given above (but seeMoyano 2013;Pino 2004, 2005). Thetypical archaeological de.nition of the Inca ushnu has not centered on the hole or perforation in the earth (the arcaduz), but rather on the platform

aboveit (Hyslop 1990:70;Tello 1939:643, 707). ForZuidema(2004:223),the holewasadiag­nostic feature for the platforms: “In order to use the name ushnu, the hole must be looked for; if it exists, it is more likely to be one [an ushnu].” In this sense, the ideal case of the ushnu is a platform with a relatively small perforation in the central part of the top level, likethe one at Huanucopampa(Figure4;see also Monteverde 2010:60), some of the plat­forms located in the puna of Ayacucho, like Mesayocpata, a village in Circamarca, province of Víctor Fajardo, and Wamanillo, a village in Putaccasa, provinceof Huancasancos(Figure5; Ramón 2009:112, 125, 127; Supplemental Text 4).

discussedthe iconicstep-pyramidofVilcashua­man, Ayacucho. In this Inca site, the ushnu was not placed in the step-pyramid, but to one side, markingatangibledifference between these elements(see image and diagram in Zuidema 2014:7). As will be shown, despite this valuable remark, the platform has had notable in.uence on the de.nitionof ushnu,including some trans­lationsoftheHM.Evenifanexhaustive formal inventory of what archaeologists call ushnu is still lacking,itcanbesaidthatthemost common shape is the simple or double platform, while step-pyramids (three or more levels) are rare (see theimages in Cavero 2010;Meddens et al. 2008:327–339; Monteverde 2010:49; Moyano 2013; Oberti 1997:17; Ziólkowski 2008:134– 135). 
Since most archaeologistshaveidenti.ed ush­nus based on the presence of a platform, it is relevant to ask whether it is possible to .nd an ushnu fromthe Late Horizon withoutaplatform. How might one be identi.ed in the archaeolog­ical record? Only one case, the site Ruinas de Chada in central Chile, has been documented to date.Forthissite Ruano(2012)andMoya­no(2013:44, 284–294) suggestthe presenceof an ushnu basedonaholewith astronomicalalign­mentsbut withoutaplatform. Recent approaches to de.ning the concept and shape of the Inca ushnu sensulatosuggestthepossibilityofdiverse ushnu categories or types. In 2009, I proposed thedistinction between capac ushnu, related to majorInca sites, using liberallyatermmentioned by Juan Santa Cruz Pachacuti Yamqui (1993 [1613]:245), capac usno, and yllapa ushnu, related to those small platforms in the puna of Ayacucho, referring to a term mentioned by Cristóbalde Albornoz(1996 [1584]:287) forthe same area. Thedistinctionwas based on several features, such as size, location, and potential relation with speci.c sacred entities (Ramón 2009:115, 117, 2014:170–173, Table 15.1). In thesameway,Moyano(2013:60, note 37) pro­posed quilla ushnu [moon ushnu]for theColla­suyu region, incorporating a latitudinal variable tothetypological approach. More recently,Med­dens(2015:244–252) distinguished threetypes: capac ushnu platforms, ushnu platform pilgrim­age sites, and isolated ushnu platform sites. This typological emphasis has made possible localized discussions about speci.c termssuchas yllapa usno, which has already been interpreted inat leasttwodifferentways(Pino 2010;Ramón 2009:115–117, 2014). 
It seemsproductivetocontinue with this typo­logical approach, which allows us to recognize

commonalities and variability. More important than the types themselves (or their names) are thecriteriausedtoestablishthem.Therefore, we must consider therelation between political hier­archies and certain formal and functional features of the ushnu as well as the ecological levels in whichthey are situated. The ecological location of an ushnu is crucial for de.ning it because in theAndes theselevelsare linked todifferent ways of living, different subsistence strategies, and consequently to different pantheons (Ramón 2009, 2014:168–170). This typological proce­dure also allows us to stop associating every ushnu exclusively with the sun by default, as Zuidema and his followers tended to do. This is an unfounded assumption, asIhavesuggested regardingthe puna (Ramón 2014),just as it is for cases such as the husno fromthe HM,aswillbe shown below.Chapter22of theHMincludes an explanationofthe relation between ecology and pantheons that helps us to consider more options forassociationwhen dealingwith the husno that wasmade while looking forLlocllayhuancupa: “It is said, that when the Ingas were in the highlands, they adored the Sun in its sanctuary ofTiticaca saying: ‘Thisiswho transmittedthe vitalforce to us theIngas.’ When they were in the lowerlands,theyadoredPachacamacsaying: ‘Thisiswhohas transmittedthe vitalforcetous theIngas’”(Taylor 1987:329; emphasis added). 
This situation, which is also found in other early colonial sources,isa caseofnegotiationin political and religious terms. Andeanist literature hasexaminedhowthe Incas imposed themselves and left theirimperialimprint;few studies detail howthey adapted themselves,orhow thelocal communities impacted the Inca. What material consequences prompted the shift from worship-ping the Sun toworshippingPachacamac? What happenedin theintermediateterritories between thehighandlowlands?Acategoryandanobject so well studied as the ushnu couldgive us some clues in this respect, since it allows for mapping difference. 


AWanderingHuaca 
Chapter 20 of the HM deals with the husno madebytheCheca while searching forthe huaca Llocllayhuancupa ina chacra (agricultural .eld) of a member of their community named Lan­tichumpi.This communityis locatedin an inter­mediate place both geographically and politi­cally.San Damiánde Checa’scenteris situatedat approximately 3,230masl,within the quechua.4 This husno was placed in a territory where the Inca, the Sun,Pachacamac (asa deity and asa centerofpoliticalpower),andthedivinitiesofthe puna,such asPariacaca, were allpresent.How does the husno re.ect these complicated condi­tions?The HM provides information about the appearance, disappearance,vanishing,and return ofLlocllanhuaycupa,thesonofPachacamac;this informationis summarized in Table1. 
Thesequencein Table1includes .vesigni.­cant details.First,L1andL2 are completelydif­ferent places, the chacra and the cancha (corral or patio) at Lantichumpi’s house, respectively. Second, afterthe initialincident,L1isonlymen­tioned once. Therestofthe storymostly happens inL2.The ritual centerisL2,wherethe combat between Choquecasa and the demonized huaca (Llocllayhuancupa) occurs. Third, the husno is made in L1,but Llocllayhuancupa is not found there, so theCheca go down toPachacamac to continue theirsearch.Fourth,in political terms, this sequence describes the arrival of the new llactayoq or marcayoq, the local deity, who is subordinate to a major one, his father Pacha­camac, already of.cially adopted by the Inca. Llocllayhuancupawasadeity linkedto.oodwa­ters andPariacaca’s nephew(Taylor 1987:295, note 10). This data places him in a geographic middle point. Fifth, regarding chronology, two main periods are represented: precolonial and colonial. It is even possible to further divide theprecolonial period accordingto Inca imperial presence. The huaca Cataquillay, whofacilitates communication between theCheca and thenew huaca,isanInca emissary.Astronger imperial presence is felt when the Inca issues a direct order impactingthe ritual forLlocllayhuancupa. At this point,ifwewant to visually represent the husno, we know its location(a chacra),but not its precise shape.

cupa? To answer these questions, it is neces­sary to compare the 13 available translations of thetext(on thetranslations, see Hartmann 1981; Itier 1994; Taylor 1982; Salomon 1991; Table2). Among these alternatives, which is the most accurate translation? The enormous interpretative differences among thetranslations show that the topic exceeds linguistics, due to formal, typological, and even conceptual dif­ferences that have signi.cant consequences for reading this entire chapter of the HM. The signi.canceof theHMinAndean studies means that the de.nition of the word husno would impact discussions about thereligious and polit­ical elements of this Quechua term (ushnu) more generally.The following section explains the commonalities and differences among the translations.

Bothof Mejía’s(1943)translations usethe terms usnu or usno. Mejía initiated the strategy that Taylor(1980, 1987; usno)followed in both of his translations, as did Urioste (1983; usnu). I am using two translations by Taylor (1980, 1987). It must be mentioned that he included minor changes at the beginning of the phrase in his 1999 and 2008 versions, but the actual term remained untranslatedinthe main text.His de.nitions in the notes did, however, change.

where the term occurs changes depending on whichever de.nition of ushnu is chosen. 
Formal De.nitions Trimborn assumed husno to be a stone on the surfaceoftheground;he rendereditas “memo­rial stone”(Gedenkstein)inhis .rst translation (1939) and “marker stone”(Markstein)inthe second (Trimborn and Kelm 1967). Galante (1942), who used the word stela, followed the same idea, also likely inspired by González Holguín’s de.nitions of usnu (1952 [1608]): “Judge’s tribunal made out of a stone placed in vertical position. . . . Mojon [marker stone] made of a big stone in vertical position.” In his translation, Galante kept many Quechua wordsforkeyconceptssuch as huaca (Durston 2014:330), but he had no doubts about the translation of husno. Espinosa (1942)simply translated the Latin term stela (from Galante’s version) into Spanish(estela). After Trimborn, .ve of the other translators de.ned husno in formal terms: four using early colonial sources (intheirmaintexts: Salomon and Urioste[1991] and Szemiñski[1985]; in their notes: Salomon and Urioste[1991], Szemiñski [1985],Taylor [1980, 1987], and perhaps Urioste[1983]).Only one translator(Arguedas 1966)probably used

ethnographic evidence. The most spectacular extremesofthis group are“deep hole”(Arguedas 1966)and “stonepyramidofseverallevels/step­pyramid” (Salomon and Urioste1991;Szemiñski 1985). 
Functional De.nitions Adelaar (1988) translated husno as “altar,” a religious structure, probably derived from SantoThomas(1951 [1563]), Anonymous(1951 [1586]), and Bertonio(1984 [1612]). Szemiñski (1985)proposed “throne” (literally:place where theruler sits), whichis perhapsabit more polit­ical and borrowed fromGuaman Poma(1980 [1613]:265).Bothsenses were also includedin a notebyTaylor(1980)inhis French translation (“throne, altar, small tower that holds a sacred object inside”).At.rstglance, “altar” seemslike the most sure, neutral, and economical solution, sinceitavoidsformalaspects, alluding onlyto function: a sacred space of connection with a divinity.Moreover, rememberingthebeginning of Bertonio’s(1984 [1612]) elegant de.nition (“Altaroftheguacas”),this.ts well withtheidea of an altarfor Llocllayhuancupa. Nonetheless,I do not proposethis de.nitionasthe best option forthe HM.The second de.nition(throne) is probablythe hardesttosupport, because its main proponent associates it with a speci.c form: the stone pyramid of several levels (Szemiñski 1985;see Table2).A decade after publishing his translation of the HM, when discussing the prayer of Manco Capac reproduced by Pacha­cutiYamqui, Szemiñski(1997:65,67) translated capac osnoyki as “royal usnu.” He added that usnu could be “throne,” “but it was a stone construction and not an armchair,” and quoted González Holguín’s de.nition, which does not supportthe step-pyramidshape, nor thefunction as athrone. 
Four years before Szemiñski, Itier(1993:66, 141) translatedthe same prayerof Manco Capac, assuming “throne” for capac osnoyki.Itier added that in this case, ushnu did not designate the precolonial ritual structure de.ned by Zuidema, butratherwasemployedin its quechuista sense; that is,itwas writteninQuechuabuttransmitted ameaning withastrong colonial imprint.In this sense, the husno of theHMisclearly different from the one includedin Manco Capac’sprayer, but Szemiñski did not consider this difference. Meanwhile, by de.ning the husno as “step­pyramid,” Salomon and Urioste did something similartowhat Itier(1994:564, 565) criticized them for doing with other key concepts in the HM (including kamay, llacta, and pacha): they used the colonial reinterpretationofthoseterms in contexts where the precolonial meaning was more appropriate.5 
A second reason to discard the “stone step-pyramid” translation is that chapter 20 of the HM does not provideanyinformationthatwould allow us to assume that this is the shape of the ushnu. The only two terms that could provoke discussion in this respect are allichaspa, which can be translated as “arranging” or “embellish­ing,” and pircaspa, translated as “building or makingawall”(seeall optionsin Table2).The text tells us that theCheca peopleweresad after Llocllayhuancupa left, and thus searched forhim in theplace wherehemanifested thesecond time (L1),ashe couldhaveescaped usingthe same path. Considering that the Checa remembered theplace as wherethe sacred manifested itself, it is reasonable that they would have arranged or embellished it(allichaspa) before searching there.Nevertheless, theinterpretationofthisverb is strongly conditioned by how husno is de.ned. If we read the verb allichaspa without any ritual connotation and assume that to make a hole in a chacra (one de.nition of ushnu), the .rst step would likelybeclearingthe surfaceby moving stonesor scrub;in otherwords, allichaspa would be translated as “to arrange.” This explains why—just to mention two extremes—Salomon and Urioste translated allichaspa as “adorning” (since they were thinking of ushnu in relationto “step-pyramid”), while Arguedas did not even include theverb(becausehewas thinking of ushnu in relation to a not-necessarily-sacred “deep hole”). This relation can also be per­ceivedinall theother translations (see Table2). Depending on the context, allichaspa might or might not suggesta ritual space,butit does not offer a clue about shape. The second verb is pircaspa, which means “to make a wall using stonesbut without usingmortar.” Pircaspa does not imply a speci.c orientation in relation to the ground: one can pircaspa upward or down into theground; one can pircaspa the wall of a

corral but also make an underground structure with stone walls, like the puquios of Nazca in south-central Peru; one caneven pircar the edges of ponds,lakes,orriverstocontainthe former or to alterthe .owofthe latter, as employedin the Libro de Cabildos de Lima in the seventeenth century, and in theHM itself(Bell 2015:82). Apart from its usein chapter 20, pirca-appears at leastseven timesintheHM,in chapters2,5, 9,24,and31 (Galante 1942:169).Inthe passage in Table2, pircaspa does not imply a speci.c shape;asinthe caseof allichaspa,the de.nition of husno has in.uenced the translation of the verb.6 
The .nal argument for discarding the step-pyramid hypothesis is that Zuidema was emphatic in distinguishing the step-pyramid as separate fromthe ushnu atVilcashuaman, point­ing out that Guaman Poma assumed the former element to be the ushnu and projected this understandingto Cuzco.It couldbeargued then that Salomon and Urioste, as well as Szemiñski, didsomething similarinCheca. 
Some authors provide more than one trans­lation of husno, giving us various versions of the same object. Trimborn modi.ed his de.ni­tions slightly: “memorial stone” became “marker stone,”whichisamore general term;amemorial stoneisaspecial kindof marker stone.Taylor, in hisFrench translation,kept theoriginal term but added a footnote offering three potential de.nitions.Inthe Spanishversion,he used the term withoutatranslation, reminiscentof Mejía’s strategy. The most recent de.nition of ushnu by Taylor (2008:20) is “an altar containing a holeintowhichofferstothe huaca were poured, frequentlybuilt on topofanelevatedplatformin order to be more visible within the plaza” (my translation).Thisrevealsthe impactof thework of archaeologists. It could be useful for some kinds of ushnu but not necessarily for the HM, sincethenewde.nitionassumestheexistenceof aplaza, whichisclearly not presentin theHM case. In chapter 20, the husno was placed in a chacra.Urioste initially(1983)kept theoriginal usnu (and addeda note)butlater,with Salomon (1991), decided on “step-pyramid.” Unfortu­nately, the changesin translationintroducedby Trimborn,Taylor, Salomon, and Uriostedid not lead to better explanations of the husno. 


Discussion:TwoHypotheses 
Afterreviewing allofthe formal and functional translations for husno in the HM, I argue that Arguedas’s is the strongest. He proposed “deep hole,” which is supported by several pieces of information. First,L1(chacra)and L2(cancha) are different places. Ritual activity is never mentioned at L1 after the husno is dug; that only occursatL2, theplacedevotedtoLlocllay­huancupa. Second, allischaspa and pircaspa do not suggest rigid formal or functional options; speci.cally,theydo notexclude the possibility of a hole. Third, the reference to usno in the diaryofFranciscodeMelo(2012 [1761]:19v, 148, 276), an eighteenth-century Spanish miner of Huarochirí, indicates a hole of some kind. Melo’s text is the closest in geographical and chronological terms to the HM’s mention of husno, which makes this testimony signi.cant for proposing translations following Taylor’s criteria(2000b [1974]:1–2).According to Melo, on Tuesday, July 28, 1750, the herder María MicaelaChinchano told himthat rebels had “hid themselves inside that usno while you passed,” and, immediately, 
with this news I went to the Usno, which is an underground cave, taking with me the administrator [Caporal], and six other Indians, andIfound thereJoseph Macañapa, andChristovaldeTorres, rebelIndians, who provided me with thedetailsof allof what María Michaelahadtoldme;andtakingthem outside theCave,I ordered themtobe tied up, and gave them each 100 lashes [Melo 2012(1761):19v, 148, 276, emphasisadded; SupplementalText5]. 
In Melo’s diary, usno (spelled almost exactly as it is in theHM, without the h)is an under­ground cave where multiple people were able to hide. This detailed de.nition is very close to Arguedas’s translation. It must be mentioned that in the 1940s, before translating the HM, Arguedas participated in an enormous project to collect ethnographicinformationfrommany Andean villages. The story of Ushnu Machay, from the village of Acolla, Junín, includes a meaning of ushnu similartothatin Melo’s diary (Teobaldo Zapata, testimony, December 20,

1946, José MaríaArguedas collection, Centro.4. Región Junín1.a.Libro Junín.i. Departamento de Junín [Jauja], legajos 46–2/46–5:158–159, Museo de la Cultura Peruana, Lima). Perhaps this early project allowedArguedas tofamiliarize himselfwith thediverse options fortranslating some Quechua terms, allowing him to choose the most appropriate ones. In the dictionary of Quechua from Junín-Huanca, usnu is also a “hollow, small naturalgallery”(Cerrón 1976). 
Thus, I suggest that Arguedas’s is the most reasonable option: the hole(husno)asanelement atthebeginningofan unsuccessfulritual action; namely, the search in the chacra.It was not nec­essarily an altarorathrone, and,even less likely, a step-pyramid (for criticisms of Arguedas’s translation, seeDuviolsinPinilla[2011:15–17, 23–32] andTorero[2005:19–20]). Nonetheless, a second hypothesis may be suggested, which is that the husno could be an altar in the mid­dle of an agricultural .eld. This second option has less support than the .rst, but is dif.cult to discard completely. Besides proposing three initial criteria for making translations, Taylor (2000a [1990]:123–126, 2000b [1974]:1–2) also performed ethnographic .eldworkinareas close to Huarochirí to better understand some of the detailsoftheHM.FollowingTaylor’smethodol­ogy,Iexplore boththe ethnographic and colonial data from the greater Lima region to evaluate the second option. The .rst step is to assume hypothetically (with Bertonio and Adelaar) that the husno isfunctionally an altar; thus,allichaspa would become slightly more ritually charged, but pircaspa (relatedtoshape)wouldremainthe same,inthatit couldmeanbuilding upwardor downward.For the husno as an altarina .eld,I introduce thelabel chacra ushnu. 
Chacra ushnus have not been discussed at all in the archaeological literature on ushnu, but they do appear—signi.cantly— in ethnographic and colonial sources from the highlands of Lima, relatively close to the province of Huarochirí. One ethnographic example comes from the community of Tupe inYauyos (southernhighlands of Lima), whose center is approximately 2,830 m asl, with lands between 1,100 m asl (Catahuasi) and 4,450 m asl(Lake Huacracocha).Inthat community,at least two kinds of ushnu were recorded: one related to the puna (Delgado 1965:247, 259, 250, 251, 312–313) and another situated on agriculturalland.Itwas notedthatinthevillage ofAysa(orAiza; 2,500masl) duringthe festival of cornplanting,a llamawassacri.ced “at the center of the agricultural .eld where there was an USÑO or special altar” (Ávalos 1952:158; Delgado 1965:243, 256; SupplementalText 6). In historical sources, the chacra ushnu appears in testimonies collectedby thepriestBernando de Noboa in San Pedro de Hacas (now Acas), in the colonial jurisdiction of Cajatambo and currently in the district of Acas, province of Ocros, department of Ancash. The village of Acas is 3,690 m asl, in the upper quechua on the border between Ancash and Lima.In 1657, two relevant testimonies were recorded in Acas. According to one witness, Hernando Chaupis Condor, “in the agricultural .eld called Tauya, in the middle of it, there was a small cancha corralito called osno and there he [Chaupis] performed a ceremony annually before starting towork theland” (Archivo Arzobispalde Lima, Hechicerías e Idolatrías, Leg. 3, Exp. 11, 19v, in Duviols 2003:351; Supplemental Text 7). Also in 1657, a second witness (Bartolomé Chuchucondor) declaredthatatthebeginningof therainyseasonhisfatherusedto practicearitual “in a corralito in themiddleofthe chacras that is called Husnu”(Archivo Arzobispal de Lima, Hechiceríase Idolatrías,Leg.3,Exp.11,63v,in Duviols 2003:429; SupplementalText 8).Acas islessthan10kmfrom Ocros(inthedistrictand provinceof Ocros, Ancash),wherethree decades earlier Rodrigo Hernández Príncipe (2003 [1621]:745) found an arcaduz, also referred to as usnu in his documents, associated with the shaft tomb of Tanta Carhua, a girl sacri.ced by the Inca administration. As has been noted, this case was key for Zuidema’s de.nition of ushnu.We can conclude that thetwo documents (Hernández Príncipe and Noboa) are dealing with different kindsof structures.We cannot tell if the ushnu from Acas included an arcaduz,but itis clear thattheInca imperialfunerarystructure placed inaremotesite inahighmountain(alto cerro)belongstoadifferent categorythan those rather humble corralitos in the middle of the agricultural .elds described by Noboa.

grand Inca history(such as the capacocha and capac ushnu)found in colonial documents. He did not,however,employethnographytoexpand the social scope of historical narrative or to illuminate simpler aspects such as the chacra ushnu.Zuidema repeatedly quoted the works on Tupe,butheoverlooked theushnu placed in the agricultural .eld. 
With this data from the same region (central Andes, Lima), a similar setting (agricultural .eld), and thesame ecologicallevel(quechua), itis possibletoproposetheexistenceofakindof altar, different fromthe capac ushnu and yllapa ushnu, called the chacra ushnu. In the case of thealtarfrom chapter20oftheHM,wealsocan identifythe huaca to whichthis potential chacra ushnu was devoted: Llocllayhuancupa. Since location and function are rather clear, its precise shape could probably be resolved analogically, butthe citedevidence already suggests thatitwas different fromthe ushnus at the center of major Inca sites. This challenges Zuidema’s concept and method, suggesting that the general de.ni­tion of ushnu must be closer to that proposed by Bertonio, thatof “Altarofthe guacas” sensu lato.Therefore,if theCheca husno was an altar, it was neither central nor for the sun; rather, it was an altar for a local huaca. This revised de.nitionsupports the possibility that theremay be multiple mundi (Rykwert 1985:54–55). 


Conclusion 
Theimplicationsof our second option—theexis­tence of a chacra ushnu—couldbeexplored at length, but the path is already clear. As Taylor argued, all translations are hypotheses: at the current stage of our knowledge of the ushnu, and of the HM, both options (the deep hole and the chacra ushnu)are highlyprobable,but Arguedas’s de.nition(“deep hole”) prevails for theHM,mainly becausethe closest geographical reference (Melo) de.nes husno clearly as “hole.” Thereisalso,of course,thetheoretical possibility that the two options intersect: the chacra ushnu (an altarin a chacra)could be, or couldinclude, a deep hole. But neither the HM nor the other sources reviewed in these pages have provided any evidence to con.rm that possibility. The analysis presented in this article has demon­strated a general approach to the de.nition of objectsfromlateprecolonial and early colonial timesin termsofbothform and function.It sug­gests twoworkinghypotheses forthe de.nition of the husno in the HM, and in so doing, illu­minatesa completelyignored typeof ushnu (the chacraushnu). This is possible not only because more historical information was incorporated into the discussion but also because variability in ushnus was considered from the outset. 
Itisevident that thedifferent translationsof theHM, fromTrimborntoSalomon and Urioste, require careful handling of the relationship between general and local uses of de.nitions and names in the Andes. When describing the analytical techniques used in his several trans­lations of the HM, Taylor explicitly indicated that he wanted to illuminate local categories. Meanwhile, Zuidema followed the opposite approach to explain the ushnu: he combined all of the information related to this subject from different parts of the Andes to construct a macroconcept that disregarded variability (for example, Zuidema 1989b [1977/1978]:90, 171–176). It is only because of the .ndings of both perspectives that thepresent discussion has been possible. Nonetheless, the interpretative issues regarding the case of the husno from the HM show the clash between the two, as well as the limitations of Zuidema’s approach when dealing with Andean material culture. When local cases differ from the supposedly pan-Andean concepts, they pose the issue of anomaly: we need to explain the difference to improve the de.nitionofthe whole category. 
There are still many unanswered questions regarding the concept(s) of ushnu, but it is clear that themostproductiveway to approach new evidence on this topic is with an opera­tional de.nition that includes several types of ushnu.Ideally,inthe future, each case couldbe compared against a systematic inventory of the archaeological,ethnographic, and historical data that considersformalfeaturesand potentialastro­nomic alignmentsaswellasregional,altitudinal, and latitudinal variability. In this way, intra-Andean cultural and socialvariability couldbe ef.cientlyexplored through material culture,and viceversa. Certainly,the categoryof ushnu could unite numerous characteristics, but to identify

them in the Andes we need to stop imposing Cuzco features upon every new case found in the documents or in the .eld. This peripheral case from Huarochirí shows the necessity of considering intra-Andean variability, not just with regard to ushnus, but when dealing with any other kind of object, particularly from the precolonial past.

Notes 
1. 
Thespellingofthis termincolonial and ethnographic sourcesvaries: husno,husnu,osno,ozno, ushnu,ushñu,usno, usnu,usño, uzno. Ushnu is considered thestandard academic term. The hof husno isapeculiar featureoftheHM,probably attributable to the scribe (Durston 2007:236–7), although Bertonio(1984 [1612]) also spells it with an initial h,as husnu.In this article,I use husno when discussing theHM and ushnu as thegeneral termof reference.
