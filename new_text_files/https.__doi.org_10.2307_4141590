In addition to the story of the yarn paintings and the presentation of Benftez's works, Furst includes infor­mation on Huichol culture, the biography of Benitez, a summary of Huichol religion including major spirit figures, information on rituals, a description of a pey­ote pilgrimage, and the texts of two key myths, "How the Sun Father Came into the World" and "How the Ani­mal People Stole Fire." The book is enhanced by excel­lent color photos of the Huichol, many taken by the author. I found the work to be well written and engag­ing and I have no major criticisms. It would be inter­esting to hear what an art historian or art critic has to say about Furst's contention that the Huichol now pro­duce fine art. I would also like to learn more about how the Huichol market their works, who the middlemen are in the Mexican folk art market, how income from art has affected the Huichol local economy, the relation between traditional productive systems and the reli­gious system, and something about what the author thinks the future holds for the Huichols. As it stands, I find the book to be informative, beautifully produced, well organized, and a pleasure to read. 
Art and Archaeology of Pre-Columbian Cuba. RAMON DACAL MOURE and MANUEL RIVERO DE LA CALLE. DANIEL H. SANDWEISS, translator, DANIEL H. SANDWEISS and DAVID R. WATTERS, editors. University of Pittsburgh Press, 1996. 134 pp., 102 plates. $35.00 (cloth).

Anyone who embarks on the task of producing a sum­mary of the archaeology of a region or an ancient soci­ety sets out on a very dark and choppy sea, and at some point in the endeavor will undoubtedly wonder why the task seemed attractive and feasible in the first place. Consider, then, the plight of Ramon Dacal and Manuel Rivero, who set themselves the task of summarizing events in Precolumbian Cuba. In addition to the usual problems of the automatic delay between discovery and reporting, of results that languish unpublished, and of claims that cannot be checked against the data, the authors were confronted by a world in which publica­tion is very often impossible because a mindless block­ade has deprived the country of both ink and paper. In such daunting circumstances the authors are to be con­gratulated for having managed to assemble even so compressed and cursory an examination of Cuba's past as is contained in this slim volume. 
The book came into being as one of the memorials to the First Encounter event of Columbus's initial voy­age, and it has much about it that bespeaks an orienta­ti on toward a general audience. The chapters given over to archaeology, under the rather curious title "The Set­ting," subsume within their 31 pages a history of work in Cuba, general discussions of the country's recorded sites, and exceedingly brief discussions of the Ciboney and the Taino. No work of such brevity could hope to encompass the vast variety of archaeological discover­ies in Cuba as well as the broader Antillean context in which they exist. Even in this slim coverage, however, one might have hoped for less of an orientation toward migration, that ever-present and sometimes all-con­suming Caribbean archaeological fixation. More impor­tant, one would have good reason to hope for a treatment of Cuba's ancient inhabitants that moved away from the unrealistically static picture-eight centuries and more of supposedly minimal change in material culture and social organization-to a more dynamic, more anthro­pologically sound view of cultures that unquestionably moved with the times. 
If the volume does not serve particularly well as a summary of Cuba's archaeology beyond the most gen­eral popular level, it may have somewhat greater value as a presentation of the country's ancient art. More than half of the book-70 pages-consists of plates of Cuban artifacts, which although they do not span the wide range of decorative objects known from the coun­try, do give the reader a good initial impression of the nature of the art of the Ciboney and Taino, as the authors identify it. Unfortunately the accompanying 17 pages of text are primarily devoted to description and possi­ble significance, and offer little in the way of cultural context for the objects illustrated. In addition, the cov­erage scants the wooden artifacts that formed so large and impressive a part of Cuba's ancient material cul­ture; although much in that area has come to light since the book was written, there were many more objects known at the time than the two pieces shown. The result is that one comes away from the volume with a mod­erately good sense of ancient Cuban decoration of both non-utilitarian and some utilitarian artifacts, but with­out a full appreciation of the breadth and richness of the island's artistic tradition. 
The references cited are not intended as an exhaus­tive list, and indeed the authors are quite correct in say­ing, even in 1992, that much more space would be required if all of the publications over the years were to be listed. The list is, however, a good introduction to what had been written about Cuba's past through the 1980s, with one entry as late as 1991. The percipient reader will, of course, realize that a good many things may have occurred between the original publication and the appearance of the English version four years later. It will take some digging, however, almost entirely on the web, to unearth what has appeared in print since the beginning of the 1990s, and beyond that one would
