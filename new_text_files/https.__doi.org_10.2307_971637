OF LOST CIVILIZATIONS AND PRIMI TIVE TRIBES, AMAZONIA: 
REPLY TO MEGGERS 

Michael J. Heckenberger, James B. Petersen, and Eduardo Goes Neves 

Meggers's critique of views presented by DeBoer et al. ( 1996). Wiist and Barreto (1999), and Heckenberger et al. (1999) in : Latin American Antiquity misrepresents these authors and others. Her criticisms, largely directed at the present authors, obfus­cate fundamental points raised regarding the nature and variability of cultural formations and economic patterns in Amazo­nia. By conflating indigenous resource management systems, which we discuss, with mechanized development strategies of the modern world, she creates an unnecessarily polemical atmosphere for debate. 
La crftica de Meggers sabre los puntos de vista presentados por DeBoer et al. ( 1996), Wiist and Barreto ( 1999) y Heckenberger et al. ( 1999) en Latin American Antiquity, dirigida principalmente a estos auto res, confunde asuntos fundamentales hechos en lo que se trata de la naturaleza y variabilidad de las formaciones culturales y los modelos econ6micos de la Amazonia. Al entremezclar nuestro tratamiento de los sistemas indfgenas de/ manejo de Los recursos con las estrategias de desarrollo mecanizadas de/ mundo moderno ella da Lugar a una atm6sfera polemica, innecesaria, para el debate. 
here is little novelty in Meggers's commen­Ttary, The Continuing Quest for El Dorado: Round Two. Her comments largely reiterate earlier views without providing further empirical jus­tification. The tone of her critique, however, demands response. We commend Meggers for recognizing the grave implications of unrestrained development in the Amazon and for noting the potential relevance of archaeology for constructing deeper understand­ings of ecological and cultural variation in this vast region. Evaluating cultural variability and its signif­icance to diverse interest groups involves issues not nearly as simple and straightforward as she seems to believe. To address these issues, a productive dia­logue between varied perspectives and in-depth inter­disciplinary research strategies must be developed. We agree with Meggers that "reconstructions of pre­historic population density and cultural complexity must be based on the most accurate scientific evi­dence we can obtain," but sharply disagree with her on what that evidence is and how it ought to be obtained and presented. 
Before proceeding, we reassert our main points. We conclude that "fully sedentary and relatively large populations emerged in a variety of Amazonian set­tings prehistorically, not necessarily correlated with the distribution of one or another narrowly defined ecological variable (e.g., high fertility soils)" (Heck­enberger et al. 1999:352). To clarify, relatively large and sedentary refers to settlements numbering into the low thousands, occupied over generations, and articulated in regional systems of other large and smaller communities that potentially numbered in the tens of thousands. Thus, we felt that "[t]he wirzea/terrafirme dichotomy (or vdrzea model [for riverine chiefdoms]) and the standard model from ethnography (i.e., the tropical forest culture) ... per­petuate images of homogeneity where it has not been demonstrated and undoubtedly grossly oversimplify Precolumbian patterns" (Heckenberger et al. 1999: 371). We did not suggest that there are no environ­mental constraints in the Amazon, particularly in the face of modem development strategies. Instead, we argue that there is far greater variability, both in eco-

Reconstructing Ancient Amazonian Lifeways: 
Contrasting Approaches 
The nature of past Amazonian social formations is, in large part, an archaeological question. The long­standing and well-articulated views of Meggers and her Brazilian colleagues, pioneers in the development of regional archaeology, are therefore particularly important. But, we disagree with the assertion that "three decades of survey of the Programa Nacional de Pesquisas Arqueol6gicas na Bacia Amazonica [PRONOPABA]" document that "surviving indige­nous groups perpetuate settlement and social behav­ior adopted at least 2000 years ago." We believe there is solid evidence for dramatic cultural change over the past two millennia and substantial prehistoric cultural variability, including the presence of "chief­doms" or "kingdoms." Most researchers currently working in Amazonia share these views (including DeBoer et al. 1996, and Wiist and Barreto 1999; see also Neves 1999; Roosevelt 1999; Viveiros de Cas­tro 1996; Whitehead 1996). 
Meggers's portrayal of the PRONAPABA as a cohesive, long-term enterprise, involving in-depth, regional-level studies is misleading, since much of it actually involved only brief episodes of fieldwork at small samples of sites encountered along vast stretches of major rivers. Furthermore, its primary protagonist, Mario Simoes (Brazilian head of the PRONAPABA at the Museu Paraense Erru1io Goeldi, MPEG), passed away in the mid-l 980s, and the effort languished afterwards. 1 This is not intended as a crit­icism of PRONAPABA investigations, the first of their kind in much of Amazonia, but we emphasize that they were designed to discern archaeological pat­terns at the broadest regional levels. They are not what we had in mind as "detailed archaeological field studies and research methodologies designed to identify regional-level settlement patterns," which we suggested are generally lacking in Amazonia (Heckenberger et al. 1999:354 ). 2 In our own research, in the central Amazon and Upper Xingu, ongoing surveys have identified numerous additional sites in areas studied by the PRONAPABA and document substantial regional variability in the setting, size, and composition of settlements (Heckenberger et al. 
3
1999: Figure 2).Furthermore, we do not "dispute the validity of the data collected ... by participants of the PRON­

APABA." Quite simply, we don't know what these data are in most cases. "Continuing revision of ear­lier seriations" may justify "failure to publish more PRONAPABA data," as Meggers suggests, but pri­mary data, including site descriptions, maps, surface distributions, excavation results, stratigraphy, asso­ciations, and basic ceramic attributes, remain largely 
4
unreported.Site-level studies, such as those at the Santa Rosa site (AM-MA-9), which Meggers pre­sents as a model example of very general patterns in Amazonia, must be considered preliminary. Santa Rosa, located in the middle Rio Negro basin, was briefly studied over a few days in 1969 and again in 1982 (Simoes 1970, 1983). These brief investigations have generated at least five published seriations, including that critiqued by DeBoer et al. (1996; see also Meggers 1991; Simoes 1974; Simoes and Kalk­man 1987). Such discordance may, in part, be explained by mechanical mixing within the partially (at least) disturbed deposits of Santa Rosa (Simoes 1970, 1974:179), but it surely casts doubt on the 
5validity of any one interpretatton.
Careful evaluation of Meggers's seriations, including the integrity of contexts, scale of investi­gations, and disparity of interpretations, is important since her reconstructions of past settlement and social behaviors, and, by a great leap, evaluation of the "right" way to use the Amazon today, depends so much on them (see DeBoer et al. 1996). Meggers's detachment from recent field research, nol having worked in the region herself since the 1950s, per­haps underlies her continued belief that "[p lottery is the only widespread and abundant source of archae­ological evidence throughout most of tropical low­land South America" and that, therefore, "seriated sequences provide more precise chronologies than radiocarbon dates." Combined with other sources of information, which are, in fact, widely represented in Amazonian sites, seriation is a useful tool, but in regions as large and poorly known as the Amazon it should be used cautiously and, as DeBoer et al. (1996) suggest, is unlikely to reveal the minute (ethnographic-like) detail of settlement and social patterns Meggers expects. 
Settled Life and Village Structural Elaboration 
Surely Meggers overstates her case in saying that "abbreviated pottery type descriptions and prelimi­nary seriated sequences from several widely sepa­rated regions . . . contain far more ecological and archaeological data than have been provided by

Heckenberger et al. or by Wiist and Barreto." This is simply untrue and confuses general interpretations (pottery types and seriations) from a broad region with specific evidence (e.g., artifact distributions, radiocarbon dates, stratigraphy, soil chemistry, ceramic attributes, etc.) from surveys and site-level investigations in discrete regions. 
Ac,:utuba and the Upper Xingu sites, discussed in Heckenberger et al. (1999), all document major struc­tural elaboration, including large earthen mounds, extensive excavated ditches, and major cleared pub­
6
lic areas (roads and plazas).Furthermore, the inte­grated site plans at these sites, documented by the layout of earthworks and the correlations between them and distributions of artifacts and anthropic soils ("terra preta"), document the contemporaneity of most late-prehistoric deposits (i.e., at least at the time of abandonment) across the surface of the sites. This degree of landscape alteration, including substantial alteration of archaeological sediments considered typical of intensive occupation and agriculture (Petersen et al. 2001; Woods and McCann 1999), is common among fairly large communities of settled agriculturalists. Contrary to what Meggers suggests, we do not say that small, mobile, or egalitarian groups are incapable of constructing significant monuments, but simply that they are less likely to do so than set­tled populations, particularly those with some form of social hierarch)l! 

In the case of Ac,:utuba, Meggers questions its uniqueness in a regional context, but we emphasize that it is the only major plaza site of Guarita age (ca. 
A.D. 
900-1500, or later) of numerous sites thus far located in our ongoing surveys. 8 Even if Ac,:utuba was regularly abandoned prior to Guarita times, the inten­sity of use, clearly shown in artifact frequencies and sediment composition, the scale of structural elabo­ration, and the plaza-centric configuration after c. 

A.D. 
1000, make it highly unlikely that the site was typically abandoned, in favor of some structurally equivalent site elsewhere, after this time. In other words, the variability suggests a pattern rather dif­ferent than that proposed by Meggers and one that accords well with local ethnohistoric accounts, prior to the period of extensive slaving and disease-related depopulation (after ca. 1600-1650). 


Ethnographic Analogs or Archetypes? 
Meggers seems to accuse the authors "of prejudging surviving groups as decimated and decultured rem­nants," suggesting that instead "we can identify the 
extent to which they have preserved their Pre­columbian heritage." This assertion is ironic since the best way to understand this heritage, most would likely agree, is through relatively in-depth involve­ment in ethnographic and archaeological contexts, that is the type of "immersion" typified by the authors she critiques (e.g., Heckenberger 1996; Neves 1998; Wiist 1990). In the Upper Xingu, specifically, Meg­gers is not justified in claiming that "[n ]either cita­tions nor tangible evidence are provided for 'heavy dependence on agriculture' ... nor is its feasibility documented by ecological or ethnographic observa­tions." One might at least note the citation to Man­ioc Agriculture and Sedentism in Amazania: The Upper Xingu Example (Heckenberger 1998), where the argument is more fully laid out. Most ethnogra­phers who have worked in the region, in fact, have noted the sedentary lifeways and productivity of Xin­guano agricultural economies, from the time they were first studied (e.g., Carneiro 1983; Galvao 1953; Oberg 1953). Xinguanos are indeed notable among Amazonian economies insofar as they depend so heavily on one staple crop (manioc)-stored in the ground as tubers and sometimes in household silos of 1 OOs, even l ,OOOs of kilos (also storing produced piqui fruit sub-aqueously in basketry "tubes"). But, to clarify our position, we do not propose the Xin­guanos ever clear-cut large tracts of forest in a man­ner similar to present-day cattle ranchers, soy-bean farmers, lumber companies, or the like, but instead practiced a pattern of long-term crop rotation of diverse tended plants within a relatively fixed area (and still do) rather different (i.e., more intensive) than the extensive slash-bum-and-abandon pattern that Meggers (1996) suggests. 
Meggers' s optimism that her general models pro­vide a solid basis to address specific cases, e.g., the Upper Xingu, is based on her belief that broad con­ditions and processes (uniform causes), in this case the behemoth of Amazonian environment, so directly affect final outcomes that specific history is, quite simply, irrelevant. Her ethnographic analogs from across Amazonia and beyond are selected without any precise historical or behavioral justification. But, one might ask why Australian aborigines, the Mapuche, or even the Jivaro are better analogs for the Xinguano past than the present-day Xinguanos themselves, who today are sedentary, have fairly intensive economies, and have institutional forms of social hierarchy within their regional social system. Did these other groups live around central plazas?

Did they build earthworks (up to four meters deep, 10 m across, and 2 km in length) and related above­ground features around villages? Did they articulate these with major causeways (some over 20 m wide, 1 OOs of meters long, and with "curbs" up to two meters high)? Did these articulate with highly con­structed agricultural landscapes, as documented on the ground and in aerial photographs and satellite imagery? Regardless, if we cast our analogical net so widely, to the Andes or Old World, for instance, our original contention stands: "[s]tructural elabo­ration of a village to this degree is exactly what would be expected of large, fully sedentary populations, but seems less typical of small, semi-sedentary groups" (Heckenberger et al. 1999:369). We need not belabor the point here (see Heckenberger l 996, 1998, 1999, 2000), but suffice it to say that the Xinguanos never fit the "standard model," as proposed by Meg­gers, even when they reached their demographic nadir in the 1950s-60s. 
The View from Afar 
Meggers appears to represent the "voice of author­ity" when she states that: "If local subsistence resources sustained dense sedentary populations in the past, then biologists, ecologists, climatologists, agronomists, and other experts are wrong in their assessment of the environment." Some may believe that the very notion of prehistoric complex societies in Amazonia is untenable, a "lingering myth of Ama­zonian empires" (Foresta 1991:265, cited in Meg­gers, this volume), but there is far less consensus than Meggers implies. In fact, "natural" scientists often neglect humans and human-induced changes of "nature," seeing the Amazon as something relatively pristine, a view no longer tenable by any measure (Balee 1989; Denevan 1992). Other "experts," equally informed as those Meggers cites (in fact some of the same people), have suggested that "Ama­zonia has the potential to be a major agricultural zone, while still maintaining a broad range of habi­tats for native flora and wildlife," and, in fact, argue that extensive land-use has more deleterious impacts than more intensive utilization of select areas, based on traditional resource management strategies (e.g., Anderson 1990; Sanchez et al. 1982; Smith et al. 1995:251; see Mann 2000 for a brief overview). 
Some areas do present significant constraints for large population aggregates, as we readily admit (Heckenbergeret al. 1999:372; see also Neves 1998), but this does not preclude dramatically different eco­logical parameters and opportunities for human use in other settings, especially along resource rich rivers. The consensus, if we can speak of one, is that, con­trary to what Meggers implies: (1) many "surviving indigenous groups are under-exploiting their habi­tats," since Amazonia was not insulated from the staggering population losses that occurred across the Americas after 1492 (cf. Meggers 1992); and (2) sometimes "modem efforts to intensify agricultural productivity are incompetent," in large part because they fail to employ resource management strategies tailored to the specific conditions of one or another part of the neo-tropics (citations from Meggers, this volume, authors' emphasis). Our position does not imply that "developers are entitled to operate with­out constraint," but instead that only systematic study of alternative resource management strategies, which may well be staunchly "conservationist" in certain cases, will provide clues about what are and what are not appropriate ways of approaching Amazon­
ian development. 
A detached "view from afar" is useful to synthe­size materials over large sweeps of time and space and it certainly aids in the recognition of broad pat­terning, sometimes hidden from fieldworkers mired in the day-to-day operation of actual fieldwork. Nev­ertheless, we might be suspicious of such a view when it so clearly conflicts with that espoused by most on-the-ground researchers, which in this case it does. 
A Phoenix from the Ashes? 
The accusation that the authors, collectively, raise a phoenix from the ashes, the European myth of El Dorado, and, in so doing, have unwittingly (or worse) aided in unshackling the beast of unrestrained exploitation upon the Amazon, is not only unflatter­ing but out of stride with regional anthropology. Pugilistic debate is not uncommon in Amazonian archaeology, but the suggestion that we provide "sup­port for the unconstrained deforestation of the region" is excessive. Regional specialists have long agreed that there were past Amazonian societies significantly larger than anything reported over the past 100-200 years (see Carneiro 1970; Lathrap 1970; Levi-Strauss 1973; Meggers 1996). This does not mean that there were no small, impermanent, egalitarian, and politi­cally autonomous villages in late prehistoric times. Nor do we suggest that there are no environmental

limits to economic development in the Amazon region. Surely we do not suggest that prehistoric agri­cultural economies were anything like the present­day non-indigenous systems that are sometimes implemented there. 
The one myth that needs to be put to rest, in light of recent work on all fronts, is that Amazonia con­stitutes a discrete, bounded area with common eco­logical and cultural patterns. It is unwise to ignore the immense biodiversity recognized in recent decades and the cultural variability and alternative resource management strategies, including highly productive economies, that most specialists agree characterized the region in the past. To do otherwise risks promoting a hollow protectionism that will surely have little impact on policy-makers or devel­opers. Thus, while we must avoid an "archaeologi­cal perversion" that, in positing the widespread presence of prehistoric chiefdoms, severs contem­porary people from their unique histories (Viveiros de Castro 1996), we can no longer assume that the massive forces of European colonialism well docu­mented elsewhere (e.g., depopulation, culture change, and ethnogenesis) somehow bypassed the Amazon. 
In sum, we should not expect to find "lost civi­lizations" (i.e., regional hierarchical social forma­tions) or "primitive tribes" (small, egalitarian villages) in one or no th er portion of Amazonia. Both were likely present in some parts of the region in 1492. Few specialists share Meggers 's optimism that we have the requisite data to generally evaluate the variability of Precolumbian social and economic for­mations. Understanding the past is a complex process, involving myriad perspectives and diverse analytical problems, archaeological and otherwise, which will not be resolved through appeal to estab­lished (but typically untested) orthodoxy, much less through hyperbole or allusion to out-dated myths and shopworn cliches. As our understanding improves over time, we are optimistic that the type of constructive dialogue and archaeological know­ledge that can truly impact views on such things as economic development, long-term sustainability, bio-diversity, and indigenous rights will become available.

l. The Setor de Arqueologia of the MPEG has flourished in the 1990s, but not through the influence of the PRONAPABA. 
2. 
More recent investigations by PRONAPABA participants, for instance investigations related to hydroelectric dam con­struction by Miller (1992), are more comprehensive, but like­wise largely unpublished. 

3. 
This includes the large (30-50 ha) occupation sites, like Aqutuba and the Upper Xingu sites, and a prehistoric cemetery of several hundred urns recently discovered (and destroyed) in our study area near Manaus. 

4. 
Perusal of field reports by many PRONAPABA projects in the archives of the MPEG, indicate that many such data are in fact lacking or were only minimally recorded for numerous, if not the majority, of the sites identified. 

5. 
Meggers states that "[i]n the initial seriation constructed by Simoes . . . the Pajura and Apuau phases were combined (Simoes and Kalkman 1987, Figure )," but, in fact, Simoes originally separated Apuau from Pajura and only later rejected the separation: "another stratigraphic cut (cut 3) [was con­ducted] to try to resolve problems of stratigraphy [at Santa Rosa] and the inclusion in the Apuau Phase of material tem­pered with sponge-spicule, then considered (Simoes 1974) as an independent phase (Pajura Phase)" (Simoes 1983:2, authors' translation). 

6. 
Elevated "curbs" alongside causeways were areas of refuse accumulation and, thus, surface collection units that over­lap these ridges often produce large quantities of ceramics, which may appear on the small-scale maps as lying within roads. At the site of Kuhikugu, road 2 was abandoned prehistor­ically and re-occupation of portions of the site (including road 5 and the central plaza and adjacent areas of all roads), after the site was abandoned c. 1650-1850, by later Xinguano villages (c. 1860-1960) resulted in considerable accumulations of relatively recent surface ceramics in these areas. 

7. 
Suggesting that these villages represent "vacant" centers, as Meggers seems to do, is incorrect, although such supra-local integration may occur in some areas. 

8. 
The plaza configuration of Aqutaba was apparently in place by c. A. D. 1 or earlier, but this remains to be demonstrated. Research conducted under the principal direction of Eduardo Neves in 1999 revealed the circular plaza village of Osvaldo (dat­ing to as early as the late first millennium B.C.), large artificial mounds at other sites in the study area, and even more structural elaboration of the A<;:utuba site than previously recognized.
