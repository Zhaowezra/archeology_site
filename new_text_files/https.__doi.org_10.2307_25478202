gation in the Moche culture that has only grown over the last decade. Research on the Moche culture (approx. 
A.O. 200-700) of Peru's north coast has a long history stretching back into the late nineteenth century, but much of it traditionally focused on the Moche art style with its seemingly realistic portrayals of the natural world and its human inhabitants. Gradually, investigators became more aware of the religious content of the iconography and considerable progress was made in interpreting Moche art by Christopher Donnan and his colleagues. More standard site surveys and excavations were also carried out, but it was only with the Sipan discoveries that art historical and archaeological approaches were forced into a single discourse. 
The volume under review highlights the most excit­ing results of the first decade of this boom in Moche archaeology and explicitly focuses on the relationship between the visual arts and the political organization (and its representations) of the Peruvian coast during Moche times. Originally published in hardcover in 2001, it brings together 15 papers from a two-day symposium at the National Gallery's Center for Advanced Study in the Visual Arts. Most of the major North American and Peruvian archaeologists and art historians working on the Moche are represented in this carefully edited, sump­tuously illustrated, and finely produced volume. The editor, Joanne Pillsbury, deserves praise for uniformly high quality of the contributions and for an introduction that makes the book accessible to nonspecialists. While many of the research projects have continued since the book's publication, this volume remains the best single source in English on what will someday probably be viewed as the Golden Age of Moche archaeology. The new paperback edition should make this book attractive for use in anthropology and art history courses on the prehispanic world.

Michael Coe's The Maya, published in 2005, is the sev­enth edition of his 1966 volume. The book continues to remain true to the author's original objectives in 1966 of creating a "concise" and "complete" book on the archaeology and culture of the Maya useful to students, travelers, and the inquisitive public. Written by an archaeologist who has been a leader in Mesoamerican studies for 50 years, this is an authoritative reference that is the best, concise book available on this complex culture at this time. It is an excellent overview of the prehistory of the Maya area with a focus on sites with monumental constructions and art. Coe's selection of architectural centers from the Preclassic, Classic, and Postclassic periods is informed by his broad knowledge of hieroglyphic texts, dynastic histories, paintings, ceramics, codices, religion, chronicles and myths. 
The book has ten chapters and three useful appen­dices. It is beautifully illustrated with 186 items, 20 of which are in color, integrated into the text. Maps pro­vide information on the distribution of language groups and the locations of sites. Chapter 1 introduces the cul­ture area and the next seven chapters are an updated review of the cultural developments in the Maya area from the Paleoindian through Late Postclassic periods. The new major updates in these sections include the Late Preclassic San Bartolo with the earliest Maya murals; Classic Calakmul, a Tikal rival; and Terminal Classic defensive Ek' Balam with a rich, royal tomb. The last three chapters, largely unchanged from the previous ver­sion, review the Maya culture at the time of the Span­ish Conquest, the modern Maya and Classic Maya achievements. The appendices, handy for travelers and students alike, concern (1) the museums and the most interesting sites to visit in the Maya area, (2) the chronol­ogy of the Classic period rulers and, (3) a list of signif­icant books on these enduring people. 
If a reader is looking for comprehensive studies treat­ing contemporary research themes, he or she should turn to The Ancient Maya by Heather McKillop (2004 ); Ancient Maya by Arthur Demarest (2004), and The Ancient Maya by Robert Sharer (2006).
