Contemporary research on prehispanic Maya landscapes has focused on caves as core features of the cultural geography. Investigations within a number of large caves have suggested that they served as the loci for important rituals, legitimized inhabitants· claims to their territory, and helped establish the authority of a sites ruling elite. The ubiquity and centrality of caves in the Maya worldview raises questions about what happened in regions where large caves did not naturally form. Recent investigations at the site of Maax Na in northern Belize suggest that small caves, despite their diminutive size, still functioned to establish legitimacy and uphold power. The results serve to demonstrate the pervasive power of key ideolog­ical concepts in shaping the cultural landscape and indicate the need to take these into account in documenting landmarks at Maya sites, as even the less imposing ones may have been important to their inhabitants.

Most of this research, however, has taken place in the large and extensive caves that exist in the western and southern regions of Belize and Guatemala. Given the apparent importance of caves to the Maya, serious questions arise about how they coped in areas that either were devoid of caves, such as the southern Maya highlands, or had only small caves, such as northern Belize, the target of our investigations. A lack of cave rituals in these areas would belie the centrality of caves in Maya beliefs. The contention here is that there was no such absence. Caves were so vital to the Maya that they created or modified spaces to incorporate these fea­tures and all they symbolized into both their con­ceptualized and constructed (Knapp and Ashmore 1999) landscapes, even in "cave-poor" areas. 
Already, investigations in the non-karstic parts of the highlands have shown that the Maya com­pensated for the lack of caves by creating artificial ones (Brady 2004; Brady and Veni 1992; Hermes Cifuentes 1993; Ishihara-Brito and Guerra 2012). They seem to have met the same ends by using small caves in other areas, such as northern Belize and the adjacent northeastern Peten, where the local limestone is too soft to support the development of large voids. In these areas continual ceiling collapse creates only a few caves that are small and often transient in their existence. Research at the north­ern Belizean site of Maax Na suggests that these small spaces were adapted for use by the Maya and served the same purposes as their larger counter­parts to the south. These conclusions have specific implications for the conduct of research in parts of the Maya area where, lacking large and spectacu­lar caves, archaeologists have tended to ignore sub­terranean features and the role they played in local settlement patterns. In doing so, they miss an impor­tant dimension of prehispanic Maya life. More gen­erally speaking, the results underscore the enduring power of core beliefs in sculpting cultural geogra­phy. They suggest that archaeologists in all areas need to pay close attention to identifying the key cultural concepts that shaped the landscape within which daily living took place. 
The Role of Caves in the Maya Landscape 
In recent years there has been a surge of interest in the importance of worldview for understanding cultural landscapes. Whereas before landscape was viewed as a mere backdrop to human events, today it is seen to play a more active role in the way that people construct their realities (Arnold 1999; Ash­more and Knapp 1999; Knapp and Ashmore 1999). No longer just a provider of the resources essen­tial for daily life, landscape helps frame and is itself framed by a people's worldview. Archaeologically, this means that researchers no longer look at just settlement patterns, or the way people distributed themselves on the landscape (Willey 1953: 1 ), but at how different features of the landscape were inte­grated into the social and religious life of prehis­toric peoples, as well as into their economics (Knapp and Ashmore 1999). 
Nowhere have landscape studies had a greater impact than in the Maya area, where the idea of a differentiated countryside was slow to take root. The obvious differences between the highland and lowland areas of prehispanic Maya habitation were taken for granted. However, for years the dominant priest-peasant paradigm (Becker 1979) and a view of the rainforest as redundant in resources pre­vented archaeologists from discriminating the more subtle variability that existed within the lowland area of major Maya occupation (Potter and King 1995). With the discovery that Maya settlements were denser than thought and the rainforest more diverse, Maya landscape studies were able to come into their own. Within the last 20 years investiga­tions ranging from the patterned layout of cere­monial site cores to the ritual use of natural features have indicated that ideology was as strong an influ­ence as topography on how the Maya used and modified their environment (Ashmore 1991; Ash­more and Sabloff 2002; Houk 1996; Lucero and Fash 2006; Prufer 2002). Of particular importance has been the discovery of the key role caves played in the construction and manipulation of cultural landscape (Smith and Schreiber 2006: 19). The exis­tence of caves with vestiges of ritual activity has long been known in the Maya area (see Brady 1989. 1996; Brady and Prufer 2005a; McNatt 1996 for histories of cave research), but these were viewed as isolated features, separate and distinct from sites. Recent research, building on archaeological, eth­nohistoric, and ethnographic studies of cave use, suggests that, on the contrary, caves were an inte­gral part of Maya sites and a crucial component of their cultural landscape. 
Prehispanically, caves were central to the

Amerindian concern with a sacred, animate Earth (Brady I 989, 1996; Brady and Prufer 2005; Prufer 2002; Prufer and Brady 2005). They were thought to be both sacred and dangerous places (Sharer and Traxler 2006:731), a part of the Earth itself (Brady and Prufer 2005b). They linked it and all its gen­erative forces to the human world, and served as significant loci for rituals directed to the Earth and these forces (Brady 1989, 1996; Brady and Prufer 2005b; Prufer 2002; Prufer and Brady 2005). Among contemporary Maya groups, they are seen as the dwelling places of the most important indige­nous deities that control rain and crop fertility. Caves, thus, host numerous rituals associated with the agricultural cycle. They are additionally the set­ting for rituals to cure illness, in part because they are also the places where the witchcraft that causes illness often takes place (Hanks 1984: 134; Uke 1970). Finally, caves are foci for individual devo­tion that are approached in myriad rites of passage and life crises (Adams and Brady 2005:307; Hey­den I 976, 2005). 
On a more profound level, caves are intimately woven into Maya cosmology. They are often tied to the creation of the universe as the place where the sun and moon were created or emerged (Brady 2005: f-9; Duby and Blom 1969:292; Garza 2009:49; Millon 1981 :232-233; Villa Rojas 1945: 156). Because all of the great acts of creation are thought to take place at the cosmic center, the presence of a cave becomes the material manifes­tation of the belief that one's settlement occupies that place. Furthermore, settling in relation to such a sacred landmark fosters the belief that the loca­tion was supernaturally ordained. 
These beliefs, documented in the ethnographic record, are still common and permeate other aspects of Maya life. LaFarge (1947:64, 162) found that residents of Santa Eulalia considered themselves to reside at the center of the cosmos because of the cave ofYalan Na'. This location, however, carried with it additional sociopolitical attributes that neatly illustrate the role of sacred landmarks in the devel­opment of hierarchical relationships. Indeed, LaFarge (1947: 162) found evidence that the com­munity's claim of centrality did in fact appear to be accepted within the region, thereby giving Santa Eulalia an elevated status. Within the town, con­trol over access to the community's sacred land­marks, notably Yalan Na', was restricted to the alcaldes rezadores, who had great personal power. As a reflection of that power and the importance of their position, the community supported them during their service by providing for their mater­ial needs (Brady and Garza 2009). Many of these aspects of the alcalde rezador position appear to have considerable time depth as they were already recorded at the beginning of the eighteenth century (Schwartzkopf 2009). 
The ethnographic data neatly complement eth­nohistoric research that documents the fact that caves were important in validating not only settlers' claims to territory but also in legitimizing rulers' authority over that area (Garcia-Zambrano 1994; Vogt and Stuart 2005). In addition to stars and plan­ets, humans were also created within the earth and groups often identify a specific cave as their place of emergence (Guiteras Holmes 1952:103). The link with a cave of emergence gives legitimacy to the group's claim to the land on which they live, because the implication is that the group has resided there since the time of creation (Garza 2009:49). Such a link thereby reinforces the elite's control over that territory. Thus, the cave is a multi vocalic symbol that speaks to the community at large but also carries different messages that address the spe­cific concerns of various segments of the society. 
Archaeologically, the materialization of this process of validation has been observed in the appropriation of caves by specific sites and their incorporation into the layout of the settlement. The clearest examples are cases of important surface architecture being built directly over caves (Ander­son 1962; Brady 1997; Brown 2005; Carter 1935:58;Digby 1958;Garcia Cruz 199l;Halperin 2005; Joyce 1929; Joyce et al. 1928; Lothrop 1924:109-110; Lundell 1934:177; Mason 1927:278; Morales Lopez 1987:77-78; Morales Lopez and Sumner-Faust 1986:17-22; Patton 1987; Prufer and Kindon 2005; Pugh 2001, 2005; Sanders 1955:191-192; Seier 1901; Terrones Gonzalez 1990:90-91; Thompson 1938).At other sites, caves are adjacent to the main ritual areas, sometimes connected to them by causeways (e.g., Actun Nak Beh; Halperin 2005). Significantly, many archaeological sites in the Maya highlands have been found to contain artificial caves (Brady 2004; Brady and Veni 1992; Ishihara-Buto and Guerra 2012). At the site of La Lagunita a cave, excavated during the Late Preclassic, ran from the

foot of one of the principal pyramids to terminate in the center of the main plaza. At Utatlan, three caves were excavated into the side of the barranca, with the longest one terminating under the Central Plaza (Brady 199 1; Brady and Veni 1992). Hermes Cifuentes (1993) has even reported an artificial cave from the southern lowlands where natural caves occur. This pattern appears to have great longevity. Recently, Brady (20 12) has identified a pattern of architectural cave construction in the Maya Lowlands dating to as early as the close of the Middle Preclassic (Brady 2012). Outside of the 
Maya area, well-known examples of artificial caves connected with architecture include the cave beneath the Pyramid of the Sun at Teotihuacan and the Observatorio at Xochicalco. 
Artificial caves are significant because there can be no doubt that the cave and architecture were being intentionally linked. Such cases underscore the importance of the use of caves to imbue land­scape with specialized meaning. Where the cave and architecture command prominent public space within the site's central core one must suspect that the intended message is one which validates and legitimizes the local ruling elite who had appro­priated that space. The fact that considerable effort went into creating caves where none existed also suggests that archaeologists need to look more closely at how the Maya accommodated their beliefs about caves in karstic environments that did not support the formation of large voids. Recent cave research at the site of Maax Na in northern Belize offers some insights into this issue. 
At Maax Na a number of small caves and rock shelters were recorded during the initial mapping of the site (King and Shaw 2003) and subsequent fieldwork revealed additional caves (Shaw 200 1). Although only a cursory investigation of these features was carried out, the caves' strategic loca­tion immediately around the core civic and cere­monial areas indicates that they played a key role in strategic decisions about the placement and development of the site. Their apparent impor­tance to site planners was further emphasized by the discovery that the bulk of the Maax Na set­tlement was located west of the site center, closer to prime agricultural areas. This supports the pos­sibility that the placement of the center may have been tied to the location of the caves (King and Shaw 2003:7 1-73). 
One cave in particular drew investigative atten­tion. Located directly under a structure along the east side of the main ceremonial plaza, Spider Cave appeared to replicate the cave-architecture rela­tionships noted elsewhere in Mesoamerica (Brady 1997, 2005). The cave also borders the south side of the main entryway into the North Plaza. Ini­tially, only a small surface sample of ceramic sherds was collected from inside Spider Cave, dating from the Late Preclassic through the Late Classic. Other ceramics could be seen embedded in the cave floor and what looked like construction fill was visible at the very back of the feature. Such evidence indi­cated that the cave was actively used by the Maya of Maax Na over a long period of time, possibly even predating site construction. To clarify the nature of the relationship between this subterranean feature and the built environment above it, a short, 10-day field season involving the Maax Na Archae­ology Project's staff combined with a crew of cave archaeologists investigated both the cave interior and the overlying structure. The results suggest that the imprint of the underground is visible in the 
Maya area even in regions where caves are small and rare. 
MaaxNa 
The site of Maax Na in northern Belize is one of a group of large Maya centers in the recently defined Three Rivers Region (Scarborough et al. 2003; Valdez 1995). It was first discovered by the Pro­gramme for Belize Archaeological Project, directed by Fred Valdez, Jr., in 1995. Research at Maax Na by Shaw and King (King and Shaw 2003, 2006, 2007; Shaw et al. 2005) began in 1996 and has con­tinued through several short seasons, investigating the settlement and testing to document the chronol­ogy and function of the site center. Maax Na is located in the La Lucha Uplands (Figure 1), the highest part of the escarpment that forms the east­ern edge of the Peten Karst Plateau, overlooking the Belizean floodplain (Dunning et al. 2003: 15). This escarpment is composed of back-reef or lagoonal Lower Eocene limestones and dolostones that were later uplifted (King et al. 2004). On a microgeographic level, the site is situated in rough terrain, characterized by sharp microvariations in topography and a highly friable and weathered limestone, which a recent analysis using scanning

electron microscopy (SEM) has classified as dolomitic. Like the nearby site of La Mil pa (Ham­mond 1991; Hammond and Tourtellot 2004), only 7 km distant, Maax Na had access to the vast resources of neighboring upland wetlands, which were early foci for intensive agriculture (Dunning et al. 2002, 2003; Kunen 2001, 2004). Prominent among these is the La Lucha Bajo, to the north and west of the ceremonial core, around which the bulk of the Maax Na settlement is concentrated. Because only a few, small mounds and groups can be found east of the core, it seems that proximity to agricul­tural land is what dictated the location of residen­tial households. Curiously, as noted, the center of the site was not situated close to the main area of habitation, although there are places nearer the La Lucha Bajo where it could have been established. The decision to place it at the very eastern edge of settlement argues that other factors influenced its location. The presence of Spider Cave right in the heart of the ceremonial area may explain this place­ment. 
Maax Na's center consists of three major plazas, linked by causeways or other features and sur­rounded by elite residential areas (Figure 2). Like other sites in the Belizean part of the Three Rivers Region, Maax Na's initial growth appears to date to the Early Classic, although there are indications that the site, like the region, was initially settled ear­lier, in the Late Preclassic. The bulk of the major architecture, however, was initiated in the Early Classic and the site seems to have grown rapidly at that time, unlike other centers in the area, such as La Milpa (Hammond and Tourtellot 2004) and Dos Hombres (Houk 2003). Maax Na is also dissimilar in that, although construction continued into the Late Classic, it did not do so on the scale seen at other sites. In fact, Maax Na may have been aban­doned early in the eighth century, as there is limited indication of Terminal Classic use or growth.

pair of structures and the associated cave would have dominated the eastern entry into that plaza. This primary site entryway, with the cave-architec­ture feature on the south side and a prominent hill on the north, is a powerful representation of the cave-mountain symbolism that is prevalent in Maya architecture (Vogt and Stuart 2005). As noted else­where (King and Shaw 2003), the cave and hill fea­tures at this entrance to the main ceremonial plaza may be what distinguished Maax Na from its neigh­bors, attracting both initial settlers and later visitors. 
The East Building itself is a massive range struc­ture that faces into the North Plaza. This structure appears to have two outset staircases, with two plat­forms breaking the slope of the stairways. Corbel­vaulted rooms, now partially collapsed, are visible on top of the structure. A looter's trench on the back side caused the collapse of one of these rooms, and profiling of the trench revealed at least six dif­ferent construction phases. The two earliest floors are fragmentary and it is unclear what kind of struc­ture may have been associated with them. The next three floors are directly linked to the construction and remodeling of the range structure. A decorated polychrome sherd found directly on top of the mid­dle of these three floors indicates a terminus post quern of Early Classic (A.D. 250-600) for that con­struction phase. The very last episode of construc­tion involved only the refurbishing of an exterior platform or floor to the east of the room that likely dates to the Late Classic. 
The companion structure to the East Building appears to be a small shrine (lA-9) directly asso­ciated with Spider Cave located beneath it (Figure 3). This building had an extensive platform adja­cent to the east, the direction in which it may have faced. Excavation of the northwest comer revealed that the structure was built directly on top of the pitted bedrock and underwent at least two distinct phases of construction/remodeling as represented

by two retaining walls standing on bedrock. Ceramic analysis suggests a date of Early Classic for the initial construction. The outermost or later wall was composed of small, well-made and care­fully laid marl blocks. Associated with this wall is a large boulder or remnant of bedrock that pro­trudes from the west side of the structure and faces the East Building. It appears to have been shaped, although erosion makes the form difficult to inter­pret with certainty. 
Most significant for the purposes of the project was the discovery of a second opening to Spider Cave under the rubble fall immediately next to the platform at the northeast corner of the shrine. A 2.5 x 2.5 m unit placed here enabled the coordi­nation of the surface investigations with the exca­vations in the cave occurring at the same time. The finding of this opening is discussed below in the context of the cave. 
Spider Cave 
Spider Cave is a relatively small cavern, 8 m Jong x 7 .5 m wide, located on the north side of Struc­ture lA-9 (Figure 4). At the time of discovery, the only known entrance was a 6-m-wide fissure at the base of the hill in which the cave is located (Fig­ure 5). This opening was low enough to make entry into the cave a rather arduous squeeze between the low ceiling and blocks of stone that had been cemented into the floor with travertine. Because this area has not seen significant deposition of soil since the site was abandoned, it is clear that entry would have been just as difficult in prehistoric times. 
A trench 2.5 m x 1.5 m was excavated in fronl of the cave entrance intersecting the cave drip line along the western side of the fissure. A heavy con­centration of unslipped and monochrome slipped

sherds was recovered, most belonging to jar forms. Many showed heavy fire blackening on the interior surface, which Brady and Peterson (2008) have argued is associated with the burning of copal incense.Although the sherds have not yet been ana­lyzed for copal residue, it is tempting to see a link between past activities here and the presence of a large copal tree directly overlooking the excavation. 
After the initial squeeze at the northern entrance to the cave, the ceiling rises to between 1 m and 
1.5 m, which allows a person to crawl or squat but not to stand. The floor rises in two general levels as one moves from north to south. Ceiling collapse in the central part of the cave also tends to divide the chamber into an eastern and a western corridor. Excavation lots were defined using these natural boundaries and a systematic surface collection was conducted. In certain areas, pockets ofloosely com­pacted, fine-grained, powdery soil, 15-30 cm deep, were encountered. Excavation yielded cultural material but no evidence of stratigraphy within the deposits. 
Recovery efforts in the cave produced a dense concentration of ceramics ( 1,015 sherds) from a range of slipped and unslipped vessel forms, includ­ing jars, bowls, plates, and censers. Some but not all sherds were burned, unlike the sherds at the entrance. Also found within the cave were two obsidian blades, some biface fragments, a shell orna­ment, and several speleothems that did not origi­nate there. The distribution of artifacts showed a break between the materials inside the cave and those outside that corresponds to the entrance pas­sage, where little material was recovered. It also showed that, while the entire inside chamber was used, the western corridor saw considerably more activity than the eastern corridor. The reason for this pattern became evident with the discovery of a blocked entrance at the end of that western passage. 
At the south end of the western corridor, exca­vators encountered a raised shelf, choked with large stone blocks and soil. They removed some of this matrix to inspect the shelf more closely. It was clear that this area must be close to the surface near struc-
