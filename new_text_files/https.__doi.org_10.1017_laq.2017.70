KAMINALJUYU CHRONOLOGY AND CERAMIC ANALYSIS: 
AN ALTERNATIVE VIEW 

Michael Love 
Recently,Inomata and colleagues(2014)proposed arevision to Shook andPopenoede Hatch’s(1999)chronology of Kaminaljuyu,recommendinganewchronologybased on detailed Bayesian analysisof thecalibrated dates.Inthisarticle,I present datasuggestingthat Inomata and colleagues’proposedchronology shouldbe viewedwith caution, especially with regardtothe apogeeofKaminaljuyu,theVerbena andArenal phases.Furthermore,the impactoftheirrevisedchronologyis overstated becausethe modelofhighland-to-lowland diffusionthat theyattackhas long been moribund.

hronology is the backbone of archae­ology, and for most regions and time periods of Mesoamerica, pottery is used for dating. There is universal agreement that better chronologies enable stronger analyses, so pottery sequences and chronologies should be under constant revision. In that regard,Inomata and colleagues(2014)reopen thediscussionof Kaminaljuyu, a site vital to understanding the Preclassic period of southern Mesoamerica, by proposingrevisionstotheShookand Popenoede Hatch(1999)chronology andextrapolatingwhat theydescribe as “important implications for our understanding of social processes in the Maya area” (Inomata et al. 2014:402). Although the chronology of Kaminaljuyu needs fresh exam­ination, a critical analysis of radiocarbon dates is not enough. The datapresented heresuggest that Inomata and colleagues’revisions shouldbe viewed with caution, especially with regard to theVerbena and Arenal phase apogee of Kam­inaljuyu. Although Inomata and colleagues at timesoverstatethe implicationsof their chronol­ogy,theirresearch raises important methodolog­ical questions abouthow bestto achievere.ned chronologies and also highlights the need for pottery analyses that matchthe qualityof current chronometric methods. 
The proposals by Inomata and colleagues should be viewed with caution for several rea­sons. First, the majority of the dates they used are unreliable because they (1) are old non-AMS dates with unknown collection methods and unknown laboratorypretreatments;(2) come from contexts lacking good stratigraphic rela­tionships; or(3) are associated with uncertain phase assignments. Second, the use of Bayesian methodologies is problematic because nearly all of the chronological information from Kami­naljuyu, other than the most recent, represents “uninformativepriors,”to usethe termproffered by Efron(2013). Third, the comparativeanalysis by Inomata and colleagues linking Kaminaljuyu to other regions is not suf.ciently re.ned.

Giventhe.awswithdatesfromolder projects, we should now adopt a frequentist approach (sensu Efron 2013)rather than a Bayesian one (Supplemental Material 1). Very simply, we need newhigh-quality dates such as thosefrom Arroyo’s(2010)recent work at Naranjo rather than analysis of dates from older projects. Kam­inaljuyu demands the type of “chronometric hygiene” employedbyTaché and Hart(2013) and anextreme cullingofthe data. 
Similarly, the comparative analysis of sequences requires precisely de.ned traits and should employfrequencies rather than the mere presenceor absenceof them.Many ofthe traits used by Inomata and colleagues (2014)are long lived or too generalized to offer precise comparisons. Furthermore, using frequencies rather than presence or absence yieldsadifferent perspective, as will be shown. 
The Poor State of Kaminaljuyu Chronology 
Getting the chronology of Kaminaljuyu correct and aligned with other sites and regions of south­ernMesoamericaisimportant,but constructing chronologies forthe latter halfofthe Preclassic era throughout southern Mesoamerica is com­plicated by several factors. First, the pottery sequence of much of Mesoamerica is one of gradual change from 400 cal BC to cal AD 200. The boundaries between one phase and the next areimpreciseand subjecttothe natureofdeposits at any given site. The gradualism of ceramic change duringthe Late Preclassicera underpins the pottery-tradition approach used in analyses of highland and coastal pottery and is made manifest in the Kaminaljuyu sequence, where Providencia, Verbena, Arenal, and Santa Clara phases were originally viewed as subphases of theMira.ores culture (Popenoe de Hatch 1993, 1997; Shook and Kidder 1952). The second problemis attaching absolute datestoanypottery traditions, phases, or complexes de.ned. Many sequences are still based on pottery from the .ll ofmonumental constructions, and theprobability of mixture of materials in such contexts is high. 
Another signi.cant challenge is posed by theplateauin theradiocarbon calibration curve for the period of 2300–2700 BP because it is, essentially,.at (Reimeretal. 2013).Inomata and colleagues(2014)addressedthisintheirsupple­mental materials,but onlyasregards separating the Las Charcas and Providencia phases. The problem is severe and goes well beyond de.ning the limits between two phases. We need to be very carefulhowweevaluateradiocarbon assays forthat time period, particularly older non-AMS dates.The impact of theplateau is to pull dates to either side, as simulation data(Inomataet al. 2014:Supplemental Materials) show.Therefore, the full range of problematic dates probably extends another one hundred years before and afterthe plateau, from roughly 2200BPto 2800 BP.Inthe Kaminaljuyu chronology,the plateau has anextremeimpact for datingthe Providencia phase, alsoaffectingthe earlyVerbena phase. 
Archaeological chronology is never about dates alone, and advances in dating methods will never resolve all of our problems (Love 1993). Even the best chronometry and statistical modeling cannot overcome fundamental .aws in pottery analysis, vague phase attributions, or poor stratigraphy. For Kaminaljuyu, a persis­tent dif.culty is that the traditional phases of the chronology are very broadly de.ned and based on the presence or absence of limited ceramic types or wares. Those vagaries render reconsiderationofinformationfromprior studies nearly impossible unless the full collections are availableforexamination, whichis not the case forKaminaljuyu. 
The Use and Abuse of Uninformative Priors: The Kaminaljuyu Ceramic Sequence 
Efron(2013)emphasizes that Bayesian analysis rises or falls on the quality of previous infor­mation, and he labels unreliable older data as “uninformative priors.”Applying that terminol­ogy broadlytoKaminaljuyu, we might sayitis riddledwith uninformativepriorsintherealmsof pottery analysis, stratigraphic excavation, radio­carbon dating, and regional comparisons. The following section examines each of those areas. 
CeramicAnalysis 
The published ceramic chronology of Kam­inaljuyu remains incomplete. There is still no de.nitive study of pottery sequence that fully documents the assemblage by phase and

completely describes the types, decorative modes, and vessel forms. Certainly, there are phase names and dates attached to them,but com­plete listingsof types(orwares),vesselforms, and decorativemodes—and thefull illustration of those data—are not to be found. Shook and Popenoede Hatch(1999)provided thebriefest descriptions of key pottery attributes for each of thePreclassic phases.Wetherington(1978a) is more comprehensive,butthatworkis deeply .awed, omits major phases de.ned in other studies, and lacks complete illustrations. 
Popenoe de Hatch’s (1997) magni.cent analysisofthe potteryfromtheSanJorgeProject, where the Shook/Hatch chronology was .rst published, provides the most complete descrip­tions and illustrations for the Late Preclassic period, describing in great detail differences between the Verbena and Arenal phases. The work also provides insight into thedevelopment of the Kaminaljuyu chronology based on the pioneering work of Edwin Shook. A question mayberaised,however, aboutthe possibilityof someof thevariability noted being spatialrather than chronological.The quantitativeinformation presentedbyPopenoede Hatchislaudable,butit focuses on tabulations by area rather than strati­graphic analysis. Unfortunately, the San Jorge Project did not publish any radiocarbon dates and played no role in Inomata and colleagues’ analysis(2014). 
The de.nitions of the major phases at Kam­inaljuyu have changed little since 1961 (Kidder 1961). The phases arelengthy, and many diag­nostic wares have long lives, spanning mul­tiple phases. Undoubtedly, there is basis for re.nement, but few criteria have been pub­lished (see Popenoe de Hatch 1987, 1991), and to my knowledge none have been applied analytically. 
Long ceramic phases and limited criteria mean that we cannot be certain two publications discussingagiven phaseare,infact,discussing assemblages that are contemporary with one another. Variability in assemblage composition across the site of Kaminaljuyu or within the Valley of Guatemala is rarely addressed in the published literature, and emphasis is instead placed on the shared attributes of an ideal­ized cultural pattern. In short, the published recordprovidesapoor understandingofvariation beyond differences between major phases. 
The de.nition of the Providencia phaseisa caseinpoint.Arroyo(2010)de.nedtwoPreclas­sic phasesat Naranjo, whereshe identi.edProv­idencia materials with superposition over Las Charcas phase pottery. Inomata and colleagues (2014)rebrand the Providencia phase of occu­pation at Naranjo as “Late Las Charcas” with little discussion. The pottery of Naranjo from 600–400 calBC maydiffer fromthe de.nition ofProvidenciaofferedbyShookand Popenoede Hatch(1999)but clearly has manysimilarities, or elseArroyowouldnothave labeleditasshedid. Itmaybemore appropriateto labeltheNaranjo material “EarlyProvidencia”thantocallit “Late LasCharcas.”Regardless,thepointis that many ceramic traits arelongerlived than represented in idealized phase de.nitions. 
Given the problems in de.ning phases and assigning contexts to them, we cannot be con­.dentofthe chronological assignmentsmadeby many projects. Theproblem is especially acute for the Pennsylvania State University (PSU) project, which provides a major portion of the radiocarbon dates forthe site.Inomata and col­leagues(2014)are only partially correct when they assert thereisnoreason to doubt the PSU carbon dates.The assays mayre.ect the ageof thesamples (albeitwithlargeerror terms),butthe phaseassignmentsof the contexts arein doubt. It is important to notethat both pottery analysis and radiocarbon dating were given secondary rolesinthe PSU project,with obsidianhydration used as the primary dating tool (Michels and Wetherington1978). 
RonaldWetherington(1978a), author of the PSU pottery analysis,was notatrained ceramic analyst. His experience as a physical anthro­pologist provided a background in taxonomy and quantitative analysis, and hisattribute-based analysis of the Kaminaljuyu assemblages was pioneering in Mesoamerica, but in reading his descriptionsofthe pottery characteristicsofeach phase, one doubts the strength of his analysis and chronological assignments. Wetherington’s descriptions of the Charcas and Providencia phases read reasonably well, but for the later phases there are signi.cant problems. First, he does not recognize what others consider to be

clear differences between theVerbena and Arenal phases,statinghefound “…fewsigni.cant dif­ferences eitherinthepresenceof particulartypes or in their relative frequencies”(Wetherington 1978a:129). Second, his analysis does away completely with the Majadas and Santa Clara phases, meaning that in the PSU analysis, the post-Providencia occupationuptothebeginning of theClassic periodiseffectivelyasingle phase. Thatis more thanjusta little problematic—itis disastrous. 
Thedivision between Preclassic and Classic within the PSU chronology is also questionable. Wetherington(1978a:131) sees many continu­ities between the Arenal and Aurora phases, statingthat “the severalUsulutantypes andvari­eties remain essentially unchanged through the TerminalFormative and, indeed, into theEarly Classic,averaging between 4–5%of theinven­toryofthetwosubphasesandtheAurora phase.” Wetherington noted continuities in Osuna Red and asserted that “Amatle Brown-Grey, in its distinctivejar form with .lletshoulder applique, is introduced in minor quantities in Arenal as well.” In contrast, Popenoe de Hatch (2002; Shook and Popenoe de Hatch 1999) sees a profound transformation in the Kaminaljuyu ceramic assemblage at the beginning of the Aurora phase, with thearrival of a newgroupof people who bring their own ceramic wares and forms. If this latter view is correct, then many contexts labeledbyWetherington as Arenal are mixedand probablyEarly Classicin date. 
Dif.culties are also confronted in using the data from the project of the Tobacco and Salt Museum (MTS; Ohi, ed. 1994), which priori­tized stratigraphyand architecture over ceramic analysisinde.ning phases.Theexcavations were impeccable,butthe chronologywascreated sui generis, based onlyonthe contextsexcavatedby the MTS project and divorced from traditional phases.The descriptionofceramic methodology says thattwoprimary criteriawereusedtode.ne types: “El acabado, que incluyen la decoración, con o sin engobe, color y tono, pulimiento, etc.,” and “La forma” (Ohi et al. 1994:505). Forms were classi.ed very broadly because, in thewordsofOhiand colleagues(1994:506),“Al analizar lasformasde cerámicano encontramos dos iguales.” 
Looking at the published illustrations of the pottery may get one close in correlating the MTS chronology with traditional phases, but in this case, close is not enough for clarity. The Kaminaljuyu III period de.ned by MTS maybelargely,but not precisely, equivalent to the combinedVerbena, Arenal, and SantaClara phases, so the problem is then the same as with the PSU data. We cannot place contexts more precisely within a 400-year period, and that inability renders .ne-grained analysis of radiocarbon dates moot. 
Stratigraphy 
Bayesian chronological analysis is extremely successfulin caseswithgood stratigraphicinfor­mation. Stratigraphic relationships were key to Bayesian models de.ning the calibration curve (Reimer et al. 2013), as they provide a .rm basis for narrowing the probability distribution for a given assay and calculating a posterior probability.Stratigraphic relationships can also check the appropriateness of the uniform phase model used to estimate phase boundaries in OxCal(Bronk Ramsey 2001, 2009). However, if stratigraphic context is lacking, how does oneverify therelationship between two contexts placedin thesame phase? Thelonger the phase, the higher the probability of error, if we con­sider all such contexts to be contemporary. The need for good stratigraphic controls is especially salientin theMiddletoLatePreclassictransition, when the calibration curve plateau produces bi­modal probability distributions for most assays. 
Nearlyallworkdoneat Kaminaljuyu, includ­ingtheexcavationsbytheCarnegieInstitutionof Washington, has been salvage archaeology, car­ried out under dif.cult circumstances; everyone who hasworked at Kaminaljuyu deservespraise for confronting the many challenges posed by thesite’s urban setting. Thedictatesof salvage work have prevented systematic investigation of the chronology, and most Guatemala-based work, which is the majority of research at the site, has lacked funding for radiocarbon assays. Work has always been biased toward largepublic constructions, where mixed deposits are more likely than in domestic structures; entire phases have been de.ned opportunistically and on the basis of small deposits (Popenoe de Hatch 1997,

2002; Shibata 1994). In no case has the entire Preclassic sequence been found in a single stratigraphic cut, and it is rare is to .nd cases with radiocarbon dates from sequential phases within thesamestratigraphic column. Thelack of solid stratigraphicrelationships between dated samples ampli.es errors stemming from long­livedphases. 
The massive construction efforts at Kam­inaljuyu in the Arenal phase and during the Classic period mean that many of the contexts containing Late Preclassic materials are mixed (Demarest 2015). Identifying mixed contexts is dif.cultat any time,butitisexacerbated when the analytical emphasis is on the presence or absence of a limited number of artifact types. Such mixing problemsclearly plaguedWether­ington (1978a, 1978b). In addition to issues already mentioned,Wetherington identi.ed .g­urines that are Preclassic in style as belonging to theClassic period(Wetherington 1978b:Fig­ures2i,o;5h,i,j).Demarest(2015)believed theproblemssoseverethathe advocated forthe chronological data from the PSU project to be completelydiscarded. 
Inomata and colleagues (2014) rely upon Robinson’s data fromUrías for datingthe Prov­idencia phase and theProvidencia/Verbena tran­sition, yet Urías’ stratigraphy seems too weak to supportsucha heavy load; thetransitions are gradual and not sharp. Robinson acknowledges as much when she writes, “aunque sabíamos de antemano que trabajamos con contextos mixtos, con Braswell tomamos la decisión de modi­.car la cronología Shook-Hatch…”(Robinson 2015:1193).Braswell(2015)concurredthat the stratigraphic contextatUríasisnot strongenough tobethesole basisforarevised chronology.In addition, Braswell noted: 
The stratigraphy at Urías does not contain a single, sharp break that separates all ‘Mid­dle’ from ‘Late’Formative artifacts. Instead, thereisagradient wherethe relativefrequen­ciesofearlierFormativematerialsincreaseas one progressesdownthe column.Given the mixing of materials, it is dif.cult to say with certainty if a particular radiocarbon assay pertainstoallthe culturalmaterialassociated with it. (Personal communication 2016) 
The stratigraphic contexts at Naranjo are much clearer, and Arroyo(2010)unequivocally excavatedProvidencia pottery(as de.nedin that publication) with superpositionoverLas Charcas materials. More recently, her excavations in the Palangana at Kaminaljuyu have obtained good dates forAurora phasematerials superimposed over SantaClara (Arroyo et al. 2014). Building on the analytical work of Popenoe de Hatch (1997) and Robinson (Braswell and Robinson 2011; Robinson et al. 2006), Arroyo has gen­erated high-quality pottery analysisofverylarge ceramic lots.Forthekindof.ne-grained chrono­logical analysis championed by Inomata and colleagues(2014), Arroyo’sworkmustbethe starting point because of the combination of stratigraphy, quality of ceramic data, and AMS dates. 
The Radiocarbon Assays 
No one doubtsthat recent AMS dates areprefer­abletothose derived fromgas-countingmethods, especially ones fromseveral decades past. Older assays are plagued by both larger estimates of error andby inconsistencies causedby unknown variations in pretreatment procedures (Bayliss 2015; Buck 2004; Pettit et al. 2003; Taché and Hart 2013; Taylor and Bar-Yosef 2014). Recent assays dated by conventional methods using standardized pretreatment procedures can be employed in Bayesian analysis with good out­comes,ifthe contexts aresound. The uncertainty of within-phase dating, thelack of stratigraphic context, and the problematic nature of the cal­ibration curve duringalarge partof the period under consideration, support my assertion that all non-AMS dates for Kaminaljuyu should be considered uninformative priors. Unfortunately, at present, there are no AMS dates from Kam­inaljuyu for the Verbena and Arenal phases, meaning that we lack good datafor thecrucial phases in the sequence. 
Regional Comparisons 
Inomata and colleagues (2014) bolster their analysis through a comparison of ceramic traits from Kaminaljuyu and the Petén. I will not presumetoevaluatethe Petén sequence nor de.­nitional problems concerning theProtoclassicor Terminal Preclassic(Bradyetal.1998).I assert

that the traits used by Inomata and colleagues (2014)to linkthe highlands to thelowlands are notatallsecure.Forexample,theylabelone trait as a “labial .ange/medial .ange” and use it to correlate theProvidencia phaseofKaminaljuyu to the Chicanel phase of the Maya Lowlands. That comparisonisextremelyimprecise.Alabial .ange is quite distinct from a medial .ange, and each has different distributions through time. Even the labial .ange cannot be treated as a homogeneous trait. At El Ujuxte, there are at least six distinct forms with labial .anges, and each has a different chronological pro.le. One needs to know the ware or type on which a .ange is found, the vessel form (complex vs. simple silhouette, hemispherical vs. .aring body, .at vs. rounded base), and the form of the .ange (.at or rounded, straight or curving, smoothor.lleted)tomakeagood chronological assessment.Moreover, antecedentstothe labial .ange occur in the .at-bottomed bowls with evertedrimsfoundintheearly MiddlePreclassic assemblages of the Guatemalan highlands and Paci.c coast(ArroyoandPaiz2010:Figures 6.34 and 6.36; Love 2002a:Figures 58 and 59). The .rst appearanceofatruelabial .ange occurslate in the Conchas phase, circa 600 cal BC, so a beginning dateof500calBCfortheProvidencia stylelabial .angeis plausible. 
Similarly, pre-slip grooving, which appears in the Mamom phase in the Maya Lowlands, according to Inomata and colleagues (2014), is found during the Conchas phase by 1000 cal BC (Love 2002a:Figures 57–63). It is not dif.culttoimagine that this trait occurs earlierat Kaminaljuyu thanit doesintheMayaLowlands. 
Nubbinfeet mayalsobe earlierinthe High­lands andPaci.c coastthanin the Petén. Solid and hollowconical supports appear on thePaci.c coast during the Middle Preclassic Conchas phase(Love 2002a:Figures 51 a, b, c).Smaller rounded and solid supports are present at El Ujuxte in the earliest levels (see below), dated to about 500 cal BC. Small, solid, hemispherical supports (what most would deem ‘true’ nubbin feet) are present in the .rst century cal BC. 
Alarger questioniswhether or not thepres­enceof any trait trulyindicates full contempo­raneity between assemblages. My data suggest that manytraits,including thoseusedbyInomata and colleagues(2014),havevaryingfrequencies through time. Some may peak, decline, and rise again in frequency, without ever disappearing completely. Hence, simple presence or absence can leadtofalseequivalencies.Frequencyanaly­sismay enableustotrack theorigin and spread of traits,rather than relying upon thesupposition that they appear almost simultaneously across broad regions. 
However impressive in scope, the cross-dating discussion presented by Inomata and colleagues (2014) is ultimately unconvincing. Indeed, allthe links between the SouthernHigh­lands of Guatemala and theMaya Lowlands are generic rather than speci.c.In contrast,the links between Kaminaljuyu and the Paci.c coastal plain are both strong and speci.c, offering better evidence for evaluating the Kaminaljuyu sequence. 
Kaminaljuyu and the Paci.c Coast 
During theLatePreclassic period(including the Terminal Preclassic),Kaminaljuyuwasarguably thelargestcityinthe “SouthernCity-State Cul-ture”(Love 2011b), whichincluded portions of the highlands, piedmont, and Paci.c plains of Chiapas, Guatemala, and El Salvador. Within that zone were a number of small city-states that interacted in complex webs of cultural and economic exchange. Any proposed chronology for Kaminaljuyu and reconstruction of culture historymustbe consistent with chronologiesof other settlements within that sphere. Here, the chronology proposedby Inomata and colleagues (2014)falls short. 
ThePaci.c coast(Figure1)provides chrono­logical sequences that are bothmorere.ned and better dated than Kaminaljuyu. HereIdrawupon the ceramic sequence de.ned at thesitesofLa Blanca (Love 2002a)and El Ujuxte(Love and Castillo 2016). TheLaBlanca sequence covers the .rst part of the Middle Preclassic period (ca. 1000–600 cal BC), known as the Conchas phase.TheElUjuxtesequencebeginsjust after the Conchas phase, spanning from the latter portionofthe MiddlePreclassictotheTerminal Preclassic, roughly 600 cal BC to cal AD 200. 
My previous descriptions of the El Ujuxte sequence (Love 2002b) were preliminary and

based only on the seriation of a few large features. The new data here greatly revise and re.ne the chronology.AlthoughI use thesame phase names, the de.nitions and chronological placement of those phases are changed. The Sierra phaseis described herefor the.rst time. 
Themajorwaresinthe highland and coastal regions have strong similarities. The major monochrome and bichrome wares at La Blanca greatly resemble thoseofNaranjo(Arroyo and Paiz 2010; Love 2002a). Likewise, the major wares of El Ujuxte are analogues to those at Kaminaljuyu, Chalchuapa, and other sitesofthe Providencia and Mira.ores spheres de.ned by Demarest and Sharer(1986).Speci.c correspon­dences are considered below. 
Additionally,wares imported fromProviden­cia and Mira.ores ceramic spheresitesare found at La Blanca and El Ujuxte. At La Blanca, trade waresinclude Charcas WhiteWare and Cuchillo (also calledEsgarraRojoat Naranjo[Arroyoand Paiz 2010]). At El Ujuxte, trade wares include MonteAlto Red, Xuc, Ro.no, Kaminaljuyu Fine IncisedBlack/Brown, Mar.l, Mor.no, Sacrojo, SantaTeclaRed, and multiple Graphite-on-Red types.The stratigraphicplacementof thesetrade wares provides chronological links that are far stronger than the comparative traits used by Inomata and colleagues(2014). 
The dating of the Las Charcas phase at Naranjo and Kaminaljuyu, and its contempo­raneity with the Conchas phase at La Blanca, is not in doubt, so I will focus on the El Ujuxte sequence. There, chronological control comes from 12 radiocarbon assays from strati-graphically securefeatures (caches,burials, and trash pits), with most placed within a single stratigraphic column. The sequence is divided into four major phases (Caramelo, Cataluña, Pitahaya, and Sierra), anchored by two 7 m deep excavations within Mound 35, an elite residential context(Figure2).Thesetwin2x2m excavations within a single structure contain all the phases and subphases of the sequence with radiocarbon dates forallbutthe Sierra phase. 
Within Mound 35 there are 12 strata, de.ned by soils or thepresence of .oors (Figure3). The deposits were excavated in a combination of10 cm arbitrarylevels and natural strata;the data were subsequently tabulated by stratum. Arbitrary levels that mixed materials from two stratahavebeen eliminated; neither unit obtained

Major chronological phases at El Ujuxte were de.ned initially through variables show­ing monotonic increase or decrease in relative frequency through the stratigraphic sequence. Subsequently, variables following the classic battleship curve distribution were added. Where multiple strata were assigned the same phase, trait frequencies provide the basis for de.n-ingsubphases.Thevariables analyzed included ware (the combination ofpaste and slip), vessel form, and decorative attributes such as incised motifs, Usulután resist decoration, or plastic modi.cation.

Thebeginningof theElUjuxtesequence lies some time prior to 500 cal BC. The earliest date is a conventional radiocarbon date with a wide probability distribution. Nonetheless, the mean of the unimodal probability distribution falls at 600 cal BC. For the present purpose, I willbe conservative and stipulatethat the dateis probablyprior to 500 cal BC.

Operation 12, there is one problematic date (CAMS-32702), taken from Stratum G. The 1-s con.dence interval is later than the dates from Stratum B, for which there are two dates in agreement with one another,but the2-s con­.dence interval yields a range that is consistent with stratigraphic order and other dates for the phase. 
There are six dates from the Pitahaya phase, placed circa 100 cal BC to cal AD 100. One of those dates (CAMS 32701) comes from Op 12 StratumB.A solid pluralityof dates forthe Pitahaya phase has means in the .rst century BC. Asingle datefor theSierra phase hasamaximal probability at cal AD 115. The date comes from Feature 115/125, thelarge trash deposit in Sub-op 17-1. 
CorrelatingtheEl Ujuxte Sequence with Other Sites 
TheCaramelo phaseatElUjuxteshares many traits with the Providencia phase of highland Guatemala. The links areStreakyRedWare,Xuc Ware,Waxy OrangeWare,MonteAlto Red, and bowls with sublabial .anges. Con.rmation for a starting date of at least 500 cal BC for the Caramelo phase comes from correlations with theIzapa sequence. Caramelo-phasebowls with wide everted rims match Mundet Red of the Frontera phase of Izapa, dated to 500–300 cal BC(Clarkand Cheetham 2005;Loweetal.1982; Mendelsohn 2015,2017;Rosenswigetal.2017). Waxywaresprovide further linkstotheEscalón and Frontera phases at Izapa. 
El Ujuxte’sCataluña phaseis contemporary withVerbena at Kaminaljuyu.Typological links to theMira.ores sphereare providedby Monte Alto Red, Santa Tecla Red at Chalchuapa, or Sacrojo Red at Kaminaljuyu. Izote ware at Kaminaljuyu is very similar to Bejucal and GuapinolwaresatElUjuxte. Theverydistinctive thick band at the base ofjar necks links Izote and Navarro wares at Kaminaljuyu to Guapinol at El Ujuxte. Moreover, there are technological attributes,such asaprominent kick-up on jars, and evidence of the use of molds to form the vessels.The incised decorativemotifssharedby thetwo sitesincludethe line/box suiteof motifs, the “peak” motif series, and the scallop motif (Figure5). 
Theplacementof Cataluñaat 300–100calBC is con.rmedby connections to Izapa.A strong linktothe Guillén phase(300–100 cal BC) is Lirio Ware, which is equivalent or identical to Tuzantan at Izapa (Clark and Cheetham 2005; Lowe et al. 1982, 2013; Mendelsohn 2015, 2017). Another tieis theclosedbowl with sharp angles(Form111atEl Ujuxte, Figure4i) found in the Frontera phase at Izapa (Lowe et al. 2013:Figure 20). At El Ujuxte, the maximum occurrenceoftheformwas duringthe Cataluña A subphase (Supplemental Material Table 1), which may indicate borrowing from Izapa. 
The equivalencies of Pitahaya to Arenal are broad, as discussed. Trade wares from the Mira.ores sphere region in Pitahaya levels at El Ujuxte include Mira.ores Fine Incised Black/Brown, Mar.l, and white-painted orange ware (shown in Shook and Kidder 1952:Figure 75 o, p). 
Beyond typological comparisons, vessel forms and decorative motifs strongly connect Arenal and Pitahaya. Two examples with high frequencies during the Pitahaya phase include forms with straight upper walls (Bowl Forms 8 and9 atUjuxte; see Figures4a,b) and the complex silhouette bowls with bolstered angle break (BowlForm18 atElUjuxte; Figure4c). BowlsidenticaltoBowlForm9are illustratedby Shookand Kidder fromTombIIat Kaminaljuyu

(Shook and Kidder 1952:Figures 65g, h, k). The maceta (.owerpot) form is widespread at both sites at this time. The highest frequency of Usulután decoration at El Ujuxte is in the Pitahaya phase, whichmatchesVerbena. Other decorative modes such as plastic deformation (pressinginof therim while theclayismoist) linkPitahaya to Arenal. 
The datingofPitahayais con.rmedby com­parison to the Hato Phase at Izapa (Clark and Cheetham 2005;Loweetal. 1982;Mendelsohn 2015, 2017). Hato is placed from 100 BC to AD 100 by Lowe and colleagues (2013), a range supported by an AMS date obtained by Mendelsohn(2017a, 2017b). 
TheSierra phaseatElUjuxteismoredif.cult to link to the Mira.ores sphere and sites to the east. Broadly, theSierra phaseshows some continuity with thepreceding phase,butit also showsa declineinsomeofthe hallmarksofthe Pitahaya phase. The dif.culty in matching the Sierra phasewith the SantaClara phaseatKam­inaljuyu re.ects a breakdown of the economic and political structures that tied Kaminaljuyu to the coast (Love 2011b; Popenoe de Hatch 2002) and the end of the Southern City-State Culture during the second century AD. The radiocarbon datefor theSierra phaseisthe only one from El Ujuxte with a mean after cal AD 100, and its probability distribution supports the

proposal thattheAurora-liketraitsoftheClassic period at Kaminaljuyu and Escuintla appear at approximately cal AD 200 (Bove et al. 1993; Chinchilla et al. 2009). 
Discussion 
El Ujuxte provides a bridge between the Izapa and Kaminaljuyu sequences that has eluded previous comparisons. Mendelsohn (2015, 2017)prefers to linkVerbena and Arenal phases at Kaminaljuyu to theHato and Itstapa phases at Izapa, respectively,but she also equates Guillén and Hato at Izapa to Caramelo and Pitahaya at El Ujuxte, respectively. Both equivalencies cannot be true, and the factors that connect El Ujuxte to Kaminaljuyu are far stronger than the generalized trait comparisons of Izapa to Kaminaljuyu. Hence,ElUjuxteprovidesthebest route for matching the Izapa and Kaminaljuyu sequences. 
The El Ujuxte chronology is imperfect because there are only single radiocarbon dates forthebeginning and endof thesequence, and the Caramelo phaseassayis not an AMS date.Even if we exclude the radiocarbon date, stratigraphy and tiestoIzapa show that theCaramelo phase begins well before 300 cal BC. The Cataluña and Pitahaya phases are securely anchored by ceramic analysis, strong stratigraphy, and multi­pleradiocarbon dates fromsecure contexts.The datingofthosetwo phases directly bearsonthe propositionbyInomata and colleagues(2014) thattheVerbena phaseatKaminaljuyubeginsat cal 100 BC. 
Regardlessoftheidealizedphase descriptions forKaminaljuyu and their dates,the El Ujuxte data demonstrate that some traits of the Provi­denciaphaseexistpriorto300calBC, something likeVerbena takesshape circa 300 cal BC, and something likeArenal begins circa 100 cal BC. The data place the peak of the Southern City-StateCulture between the .rst centuryBC and .rst centuryAD. Kaminaljuyu,likethe restofthe Southern City-State Culture, had a tumultuous period during the “Late Preclassic Collapse” between AD 100 and 200 (Love 2007, 2011a, 2011b), afterwhich thenew traitsof theClassic PeriodAuroraphase appear,beginningatcalAD 
200. 
Implications of Chronological Relationships for Social Process 
My goal certainly is not to defend theprecocity of the Guatemalan Highlands or the broader “Southern Maya Region” relative to the Maya Lowlands, a position correctly criticized by Inomata and colleagues(2014). Indeed,Ihave proposed that the “Maya” elements of the “SouthernMaya Region” were intrusive(Love 2002a:619; 2004). Given the discoveries of the past thirty years in the Maya Lowlands, any scenario by which Classic Maya culture diffusedfrom highlandstolowlandsis untenable, even using the Shook/Hatch chronology (Love 2011a). Present evidence cannot rule out some variant of the “Chiapas Model” proposed by Gareth Lowe (1977; see also Clark and Pye 2011), wherein a migration brought “Maya” traits fromthelowlandstothehighlands(Love 2011a). More complex formsofinteraction are probable, however, and undoubtedly there were southern contributions to pan-Mesoamerican high culture that included theLowland Maya.A one-way street is unlikely. 
The “baton theory,”bywhichcivilizationwas transmittedfromthe OlmectoIzapa and thence to theLowland Maya has been dead andburied forsolong thatitis trulysurprisingtoseeanyone botherto attackit,orevenpartsofit.Thatmodel of sequentialOlmec-Izapan-Maya cultures was soundly refuted by the 1980s (Demarest 1986, 1989,2011;Demarestand Sharer1986),anditis troublingtosee outdated opinions,such as those of Coe(1962)orGifford(1976), citedasthough they represent current thinking among scholars workinginthe Highlands andPaci.c coast. 
Inomata and colleagues further propose that the Central Highlands of Guatemala collapsed at 400 cal BC. Political cycling undoubtedly occurred throughout the Preclassic period of Mesoamerica(Love 2002c), and theValley of Guatemala experienced such episodes. Some­thing signi.cant happened in the Valley of Guatemala at about 400 cal BC (Arroyo, ed. 2010; Love 2011b, 2016; Popenoe de Hatch etal. 2011), manifestedintheshiftin paramount settlement fromNaranjotoKaminaljuyu and the disruptionintrade routes to the east,butthose political and economic changes fall short of a

collapse(Supplemental Material2).The deusex machina summoned by Inomata and colleagues (2014), invoking the putative collapse of La Venta, contributes nothing. 
For many, the most important conclusion of Inomata and colleagues (2014) is that the conceptof “DivineKingship”expressedthrough signi.cant bodies of sculptural art at Kami-naljuyu,Takalik Ab’aj, and Izapa,beganinthe “Protoclassic.” This interpretation rests on (1) the datingofTombsIandII from Kaminaljuyu Mound E-III-3, and (2) the assumption that tombs represent the best evidence of this ideol­ogy. The focus on royal burials distracts from a larger body of evidence that shows political centralization and ideological change beginning much earlier. Changes in settlement patterns, monumental construction, sculptural form and content, domestic ritual, public ritual, and site planning allindicateimportant political and ideo­logical shifts within SouthernCity-State Culture by 300 cal BC (Guernsey 2012; Guernsey and Love 2005; Love 2002c). 
There is no doubt that many of the major sites of the Southern City-State Culture wit­nessed large programs of sculpture and monu­mental construction duringthe .rst century AD. Nonetheless, the trajectory of political central­ization began much earlier, and material indi­cations of ideological change predate the .rst appearanceof royal tombs. Muchof theevidence forsocial inequality and the natureofideology at Kaminaljuyu, and within SouthernCity-State Culture more broadly, comes from sculpture (Guernsey 2006,2012;Henderson2013;Parsons 1986).Evenif theroyal tombsatKaminaljuyu and at Takalik Ab’aj date to the .rst century AD, their dates provide little insight into the chronology of the sculpture. First and foremost, pottery does not date the sculpture; at best the excavated context of a sculpture provides a terminus ante quem.Nearly allofthe Preclassic sculptureatKaminaljuyu andTakalik Ab’aj, to givetwoexamples,was foundinlater contexts,so changing the ceramic chronology does nothing to date the sculpture in and of itself (contra Inomata and Henderson 2015). Second, thereis solid evidence of sculptural programs as early as the Providencia phase within the Valley of Guatemala, as already mentioned. 
Inomataand colleagues(2014)suggestaneed to reevaluatethe datingofthe Guillén phase and the apogeeof Izapa. Nonetheless, recentworkat Izapa has con.rmed the Guillén phase at 300– 100 cal BC, and Hato at 100 cal BC–cal AD 100 (Mendelsohn 2017;Rosenswigetal. 2017). Stylistic similarity makes it likely that at least someoftheworksat relatedsitessuchasTakalik Ab’aj and Kaminaljuyu is contemporary with those of Guillén phase Izapa (Guernsey 2006; Parsons 1986). Long Count dates at Takalik Ab’aj andEl Baúl document the persistenceofa sculptural traditionintothe .rst and second cen­turies,but manyanalysts viewthoseworks as the endpoint of the Preclassic sculptural sequence, not the beginning (Parsons 1986; Popenoe de Hatch et al. 2011). 
With the dating of the apogee of Izapa to theGuillén phase now con.rmed (Rosenswig and Mendelsohn 2016; Rosenswig et al. 2013, 2015), the irony is clear. If Inomata and col­leagues’(2014)chronologyis correct,then the Izapa corpus predates the early “Maya” art at Kaminaljuyu and the baton model would be reborn. That possibility seems unlikely, given the manypoints of multidirectional stylistic and symbolicexchange suggestedby the sculptural corpus (Guernsey 2006, 2012). 
Conclusion 
The work of Inomata and colleagues (2014) makes clear the need for a reexamination of chronology throughout southern Mesoamerica. Theirdiligent reviewof dates and ceramic com­plexes from the highlands of Guatemala and neighboring areas is signi.cant and stimulating. 
Advances in the chronology of thehighlands andPaci.c coastwill comefrom ongoingwork, with new dates for the major phases at Kami­naljuyu likelytobe determined through current work within the Valley of Guatemala. We can hope that other projects will also recognize the need for new chronological studies and take up the challenge. Whatever those results may be, radiocarbon dates alone will not produce thekind of re.ned sequences that we need.

absenceofafewwaresortypes simply are not adequate to answer new questions that demand re.ned chronologies (see Cowgill 2015). 
Formal models and Bayesian analyses of radiocarbon assays unquestionably will be cen­tral to chronologybuildinginthe future.Models that integrateBayesian approaches to attribute-based ceramic analysis shouldalsobeexplored. Bayliss(2015)providesa checklistofthe proto­cols needed to conductagood Bayesian analysis of chronological data, which are standards to whichwe can aspire;few projectsinMesoamer­ica, mine included, have reached them. Until those conditions aremet,wewillbe wiseto heed Efron’s(2013)admonitions andavoid theuseof uninformative priorinformation.As Efronsug­gests,inthe absenceofvalid priorinformation, we shouldfocus on collectingnew data.
