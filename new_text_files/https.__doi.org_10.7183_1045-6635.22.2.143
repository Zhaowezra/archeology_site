
PEOPLE WHO LIVED IN STONE HOUSES: LOCAL KNOWLEDGE AND 
SOCIAL DIFFERENCE IN THE CLASSIC MAYA PUUC REGION OF 
YUCATAN, MEXICO 

Kelli Carmean, Patricia A. McAnany, and Jeremy A. Sabloff 
This study builds on the premise that local knowledge of limestone-and its workable characteristics-was foundational to landscape inhabitation in the Puuc region ofYucatan, Mexico. Classic Maya architecture of the northern Yucatan generally is considered to represent the apogee of Maya construction prowess with extensive use of core-veneer masonry and the cre­ation of tall, wide corbelled vaults. Less commonly discussed is the variable distribution of high-quality limestone across the Yucatan, the social matrix that undergirds the quarrying, transporting, and working of limestone, and the pronounced social differences 
materialized in stone architecture. This study explores these three topics by bringing to bear Yucatec Mayan linguistic evidence and excavation data from the archaeological site ofSayil, in the hilly Puuc region ofYucatan. That infor­mation provides a basis for understanding the development of a sprawling residential complex, the role that variable lime­stone quality played in its expansion, and serves as an index of intra-compound social difference. Late additions to the dwellings indicate that recognition of the cultural value of carved stone persisted long after masonry skills became atten­uated. The durability of stone renders it a particularly effective-if underutilized-medium for interpreting social land­scapes of the past. 
Este estudio amplifica la premisa de que el conocimiento de la piedra caliza-y sus propiedades arteseanales-fue una base fundamental para la ocupaci6n de! paisaje de la Region Puuc, Yucatan, Mexico. En general, la arquitectura de los mayas de la epoca Clasica de! norte de Yucatan se considera representativa del apogeo de su proeza arquitect6nica con el uso exten­sivo de nucleos de piedra burda recubiertos de piedra labrada y la creaci6n de habitaciones con b6vedas altas y anchas. Menas mencionados son la distribuci6n geografica variable de piedra caliza de alta calidad a traves de Yucatan, la matriz social que permite la explotaci6n de canteras y el transporte y trabajo de los bloques, y la diferencia social profunda que se nota en la arquitectura en piedra. Este estudio explora estos tres temas usando evidencia de la lengua maya yucateca y datos de excava­ciones de! sitio arqueol6gico de Sayil, en la serranfa Puuc. Esta informaci6n proporciona las bases para entender el desa­rrollo de un grupo residencial expansivo y el papel que la calidad variable de la piedra caliza tuvo en su expansion, y sirve coma fndice de diferencias sociales entre los habitantes del mismo grupo. Adiciones tardfas a los edificios indican que el reconocimiento de! valor cultural de la piedra trabajada persisti6 mucho tiempo despues de la disminuci6n de las tecnicas especializadas de albanilerfa. La durabilidad de la piedra la hace un buen instrumento, aunque poco utilizado, para inter­pretar los paisajes sociales de! pasado. 
lassie Maya architecture has long been con­commented upon except in situations of change or Csidered animpressive achievement of Maya failure of transmission (Sahlins 1981), such as civilization. Less often explored, however, occurred at the end of the Classic period. In some is the profound and highly local knowledge of parts of the Maya region-such as the northern landscape-including its stony places-that Yucatan-stone was plentiful, even if of variable enabled the creation of Maya stone structures. The quality for construction. That variable limestone transmission of knowledge-of both stony places quality placed a premium on those locales at which and skills of stone working-between generations durable and workable limestone could be readily is an equally impressive achievement that is rarely quarried.

working, and the social webs within which stone was allocated form the substance of this study. 
The durability of stone means that it is a medium through which social hierarchy could be effectively expressed and maintained (Touraine 1977:461)­cast within a local notion of monumental time (Ricoeur 1985:110). This is particularly the case in the Puuc region of the Yucatan in which a hallmark of Classic Maya social difference centered on inhabiting a stone house (McAnany 2008) crafted with extraordinary masonry skills that included core-veneer masonry walls and tall, wide corbelled vaulted roofs (see Figure 1 for an example from Sayil). The efficacy with which stone houses indexed and materialized social difference refers to only one dimension of the meaning of stone houses, however; also highly relevant are the social 
processes by which stones came to be quarried, shaped, carved, stacked, and stuccoed. Such social relations gave rise to a habitus of appropriation and allocation that is central to understanding ancestral Maya economies (McAnany 2004, 20 10). In this paper, the co-residential relations, tributary oblig­ations, and terms of patronage entangled with the construction and maintenance of stone houses are theorized in detail, and empirically applied to a particular case. 
The stony place on which this study is based is Sayil, Yucatan, Mexico, a Late-Terminal Classic Maya political capital in the hilly Puuc region of Yucatan (Figure 2), an area renowned for the high frequency of both stone houses and bottle-shaped pits used for water storage in this karstic landscape. 
In the mid-l980s, Jeremy Sabloff and Gair Tourtel­lot initiated one of the first full-coverage surveys in this region. Thousands of basal platforms, foun­dation braces for perishable structures, and vaulted stone buildings later, the Sayil Project produced one of the most extensive maps then made of a North­ern Maya Lowland site (Sabloff and Tourtellot 
1991; Figure 3). This study focuses on the resi­dential architecture of Sayil in an effort to under­stand varying limestone quality, its conceptual meaning, and the significance of differential access to building stone. 
Archaeological Research at 
Sayil, Yucatan, Mexico 

"[F]iguratively from top to bottom of the social scale and literally side to side of the community." Such was the goal of the Sayil Archaeological Pro­ject: to produce a site map comparable to those of Tikal, Seibal, Mayapan, Dzibilchaltun, and Coba, and thus to begin adding the Puuc settlement story to the broader Maya mix (Sabloff and Tomtellot 1991). Three years (1983-1985) of survey and mapping revealed what many had already sus­pected: Sayil was a site of urban proportions with a residential core that extended out 4.5 km2• The project's second phase (1987-1988) shifted to intensive surface collection and excavation. Shal­low soils and highly visible artifact scatters facili­tated systematic 2-x-2-m surface collections, producing a bounty of surface refuse in discrete toss zones clearly associated with specific identifiable

of residential buildings, producing a summary sta­tistic for a sample of basal platforms that quanti­fied their quarrying, shaping, transportation, and construction labor (Carmean 1991, 1998). The widely varying quantities of stone-expressed as estimates of person-day labor investment­documented the extent to which higher-ranking individuals were able to muster greater food resources to support more people for longer peri­ods to build large and grand stone houses, while other Sayil residents could not. Carmean's study identified six ranks of nonroyal palace residences: Rank I basal platforms contained the highest quan­tities of full stone vaulted architecture, while Rank VI basal platforms contained none, consisting instead of only small and low foundation braces 
(Carmean 1991, 1998). 
The current study, however, goes beyond an analysis of differing quantities of stone and labor investments to consider the quality of the con­struction materials themselves and the cultural meaning that variable stone quality may have held for the residents of Sayil. Inspiration for this analy­sis originated with the senior author who has lived in the Bluegrass Region of central Kentucky for the past seventeen years-a region known for natu­rally occurring limestone and limestone architec­ture.

foundation built in 1911. Recent repair work offered the opportunity to notice that its builders placed the better-cut and finished pieces of lime­stone in the most visible parts of the foundation, i.e., the front and exterior walls. Noticeably poorer stone was used on interior walls, and interior rear walls were little more than poor-quality field stones. This strategic pattern of limestone placement in a Kentucky basement sparked memmies of a sprawl­ing millennia-old Sayil compound that all three authors excavated during the 1987 field season. 
Not All Limestone Is Created Equal 
The Yucatan Peninsula is essentially one large 
limestone slab slanting northwards and down into 
the sea. Within the peninsula lies the hilly Puuc 
region, with its highest peak near Tekax: Cerro de 
Xal at 250 m (820 feet). Limestone along the low­
lying coast is relatively young: Quaternary 
deposits of less than 2 million years. In contrast, 
limestone of the Puuc is older-of Miocene­
Pliocene age or roughly between 24 and 2 million 
years ago (Ward 1985). Older sedimentary rocks 
are more likely to have undergone burial and com­
paction during which it acquires a dense and fine 
grain (as voids fill with carbonate cement) that 
translates into higher-quality construction mate­
rial. Very young limestone, on the other hand, is 
soft and highly friable. 
In addition to age, limestone quality also depends on purity and bedding thickness. These characteristics of limestone vary considerably from outcrop to outcrop but also within individ­ual outcrops. Universally, stoneworkers under­stand the variable qualities of raw material and, whenever possible, prefer to work with stone that exhibits superior qualities (see Patrois 2008:27-29 _for Yucatan). Michelangelo, for example, pre­, ferred marble from a particular quarry near Flo­rence, because the properties of that stone were highly desirable, and produced excellent results (see Attanasio et al. 2005). Although Sayil's stonework is far from that of Michelangelo, some of the most elaborate Rank I and II vaulted stone buildings do contain finely carved architectural elements, as do the palaces and temples of the cen­
tral zone (Figure 1). 
For the Mirador Basin of the Southern Maya 
Lowlands, Hansen (1998:63, 105) has presented 
architectural evidence that complex quarry spe­cialization with full-time stonemasons existed by the late Middle Preclassic Period (ca. 600-400 B.C.). Abrams (1994, 1998) also has discussed the presence of specialist stoneworkers and plasterers for Classic Period Copan. As well, Terminal Clas­sic Puuc mosaic faades depended upon the avail­ability of dense and hard limestone raw material for the chisels of specialized Puuc stonemasons. The extraordinary skills of both Colonial and Pre­his panic stonemasons were recognized by Spaniards (McAnany 1995: 137) as attested by the incorporation of large quantities of Puuc veneer stones in Colonial churches throughout the Yucatan. 
Yucatec Mayan Terms for Stone 
The premise that local knowledge of limestone­and its workable characteristics-was foundational to the inhabitants of the Puuc Region of Yucatan, Mexico is supported by linguistic evidence. The Yucatec-language Diccionario Maya Cordemex (Barrera 1980) provides a wide range of adjectives, verbs, and modifiers that occur in conjunction with many words for stone, particularly with the root word tun. The following sampling of Colonial Yucatec terms provides a linguistic window into the practice of distinguishing, categorizing, and dis­cussing the stony landscape inhabited by Colonial and contemporary Yucatec Maya people.

The Puuc Region can be characterized as a land­scape of craggy stone. The karstic valley depres­sion that contains the architectural core of Sayil (Figure 3)-including the North Palace, South Palace and linking sacbe (causeway) as well as deep and highly productive kancab soils (Dunning 1994)-soon gives way to a hilly landscape that is rugged and stony. Across this undulating terrain of limestone outcrops-characterized by hard caprock underlain by soft, chalky sascab material-sprawling residential units were con­structed during the Late Classic period (A.D. 700-900). Builders worked with existing outcrops, leveling, extending, and puncturing to dig water cis­terns (locally called chultunob, singular chultun). At Sayil, our excavations of one complete resi­dential compound revealed the full extent and sequencing of bedrock modifications-a topic to which we now tum. 
Excavations within Four Sectors of a Residential Compound 
The 1987 excavations at Sayil focused in large part on the full exposure of a residential basal platform (Feature Cluster N7860 E5350) and its immediate surroundings in the Miguel T hectare (Figures 4, 5, and 6). Located about 250 m east of the sacbe and southeast of the North Palace, the size and architectural features of this basal platform com­plex places it in the lower mid range of Sayil's spectrum of architectural differentiation (a Rank V designation [Carmean 1991, 1998]). The basal plat­form is polygonal in outline with maximum dimen­sions of some 55 m east-west and 40 m north­south. The surface of the platform was raised 2.5 m above the current ground surface. The absence of full-height stone buildings, corbelled vaulting, and mosaic faades can be cited as evidence that these residents never held elite status. 
Our excavations revealed that artifactual debris was not evenly spread across the basal platform, but rather formed three discrete concentrations, each clearly associated with specific residential architecture. An additional small platform was located immediately to the southeast-physically unattached to the main basal platform-although we believe it may have been linked socially and eco­nomically to the main basal platform complex. We have defined within these excavations four linked but discrete residential sectors, which are discussed in the following order: the Northeast Sector, the West Sector, the unattached Small Platform Sec­tor, and the Southeast Sector. Evidence indicates that all four sectors served residential functions and were not special-use structures; that is, none was a place where people did not actually live. For rea­sons discussed shortly, we believe these four sec­tors likely composed one household. While the sectors contained comparable kinds and quantities of residential artifactual debris, they exhibited quite varying kinds and quantities of residential archi­tecture. We interpret these four areas as separate but kin-linked residences arrayed around the high­ranking residence in the Southeast Sector. 
Northeast Sector 
Stratigraphic evidence gained through near-com­plete exposure suggests the Northeast Sector was built as a later addition to the main portion of the basal platform. The residences built on top of the Northeast Sector's basal platform extension con­sist of three small, discrete, and well-defined low rubble platforms composed of relatively small stones, known locally as bak ch'ich. The rubble platforms are arranged in an orthogonal plaza grouping that opens to the east (Figure 5, north­east area). Near the center of the plaza was a par­tially intact chultun with a surrounding catchment surface. A pita (limestone water basin) was recorded for this sector, but no metates (grinding stones), although that does not mean they were never present. One burial (Burial 1) was recovered from the Northeast Sector: a secondary, disarticu­lated, incomplete bundle burial with two whole ceramic vessels (Muna Slate polychrome serving bowls, one inverted and one upright). As was the case with all sectors, common domestic residen­tial debris was closely associated with all three rub­ble platforms. 
West Sector 
The residential dwellings of the West Sector con­sist of two low rubble platforms and a simple, two­to-three course foundation brace constructed with
