MarxNavarro-Castillo,Alejandro Sheseña, and SophiaPincemin 
The last 20 years have seen a great increase in the awareness of and interest in ancient Maya graf.ti. Such graf.ti have recently been rediscovered at the site of Plan de Ayutla, in the Lacanjá river basin of Chiapas, and add to the known Maya corpus. The Plan de Ayutla graf.ti exhibit a diversity similar to that found at other Maya sites, including production by specialists as well as non-specialists, and themes ranging from daily activities to ceremonial events. 
En los últimos 20 años se ha incrementado el interés en los gra.tos prehispánicos Mayas. Esta clase de manifestación recientemente redescubierta en el sitio de Plan de Ayutla en la cuenca del río Lacanjá, Chiapas, se ha incorporado al corpus ya existente. Los gra.tos en Plan de Ayutla exhiben similitudes con aquellos hallados en otros sitios Mayas, donde se incluyen creaciones hechas tanto por especialistas como no especialistas, y cuyos temas varían de actividades diarias a eventos ceremoniales. 
N
avarro-Castillo began the Rancho Ojo de Agua Archaeological Project in 2015 with the goal of investigating low-ranking sites in the Lacanjá river basin in the Lacandon jungle. When local students noti.ed project members about the deteriorationofPre­hispanic graf.ti (by both human and natural agents) at the site of Plan de Ayutla, we vis­ited it to record and preserve what remained. Seven incised images were rediscovered, some of which had been previously publishedby Mar­tos(2015:10–11).Video footage, photographs, and direct tracings were takentofully document each image. 
The site ofPlandeAyutla 

ThisLate Classicsiteis locatedinthe ejido of the same name, near the town of Nueva Palestina. It encompasses about 25 ha, and includes 74 structures distributed across three acropoli. The graf.tiare locatedin Structures2and13, both of whichare still standingintheNorth Acropolis (Figure1). 
Structure2isathree-room temple with three front entryways: a central door accessed by a small staircase and two .anking doors. The central door opens into a hallway through which one can access each of the three temple rooms. Eachofthesideroomshastwo pointsofentry – one fromthe frontof thebuilding andasecond from the central hallway. Access to the central roomis more restricted.It canbe entered through thesingle dooratthe backofthe hallway,directly behind the main entrance. 
Structure 13 is an administrative building composed of front and reargalleries connected bya narrowdoorwayatthe eastern end.Asingle benchis locatednexttothe entranceonthewest­ernsideofthe frontgallery.Duetothelayoutof thebuilding, thefrontgalleryis well lit from the entrance,butthereargalleryisquite dark(Martos 2005, 2009, 2015; Tovalín Ahumada y Ortiz Villareal2003;Tovalín Ahumada et al.2004).

Theface has two vertical incisions behind the mouth and twoV-shaped incisions behind theeye, perhaps to represent age. The image measures 36.5 cm high by 40.0 cm wide and was crudely exe­cuted in open, rounded strokes, perhaps using an instrument with a wide, blunt tip. Some of the features of this drawing were damaged by previous archaeological consolidation.

66.5 cm high and 31.1 cm wide. The incision lines are thin, likely created using a sharp tool. Its executionis rough. 
Graf.to6alsoisonthe northeastwallofthe rear gallery of Structure 13. It is an image of a male drawn in left pro.le. He seems to sit ona bench atopahighplatform(Figure6).It is noteworthythat although theindividual’s feet restontheplatform,the bench appearssuspended in midair above it. He wears a turban depicted withajaw containing two upperfangs, beneath which four long feathers trail down his back. The artist took advantage of the wall on which the image was drawn; aspects of the stone are visible within the circle element of the turban. Theindividual’sfaceis adorned witha design, perhaps achieved through scari.cation, consist­ing of a curved band extending from the head­dress along the cheek bone, below his pupiled eye, and acrossthe nose. Threetriangles,similar in shape to the beads hanging from his collar, are suspended from this band. The character is richlyattired, witharounded noseplug, tubular earplug, and circular earspool. A skirt is tied around his waist and knotted at the back, from whichafeatherfanextends outward toward the headdress plumes. His left arm extends down­ward, seemingly grasping something soft. His expression is haughty and proud, likely that of a ruler. The image measures 33.5 cm high by 
22.4cmwide. The outlineofthis .gureisrather shallowbut masterfully crafted, perhapsthework ofaprofessional artist. Thethicknessofthe lines of the platform suggest it was made using a different instrument than the .gure.

schematic representation of a structure with a high, vaulted ceiling situated atop two large steps, perhaps representingStructure13itself— it has the same external appearance (Martos 2015:11).The image measures 48.0cmhighby

Discussion 

The themes represented in these graf.ti coin­cide with those observed at other Maya sites: enthroned rulers, membersofthe nobility,super­natural beings, and architecture(Andrews 1980; Patrois and Nondédéo Zralka
2009; ´2014). As we now understand, these images depict eventsorlocations importantto elite individuals. The graf.ti portray a more domestic perspec­tive than the of.cially commissioned scenes depicted on polychromes or in mural paintings (Andrews 1999:241; Mayer 2009:26–27;Patrois and Nondédéo 2009:59). Thus, they provide evidence supporting the idea that their creators were residents of the Late Classic settlement, who rendered these images in a private setting (Andrews, 1999:223;Ková.c, 2014:41).Indeed, Mayagraf.titendtobe located nearthe .oorin places whereinhabitants mayhave been sitting (Kampen1978:163),whichisthe casefor Struc­ture 13. The representations of rulers depicted heresuggestthatthebuildingmayhave beenthe residenceof thegovernorof this political entity, as proposedby Martos(2009). Consideringthe level of execution in most cases of graf.ti, their creators were individuals without artis­tic training, as argued by Dominique Michelet (2009:97).Theserepresentations mayevenhave been created by relatives of the portrayed ruler. One exception may be the image of the seated ruler represented in Graf.to 6, whose quality indicates that it may have been the work of a trained artist. 
The interest of the nobility in representing issues related to their courtly life as private images suggestsadesiretokeepavisual recordor family archiveto retain memoryof themesorper­spectives that mayhave had no place in of.cial or public art(Ková.c2014:41; ´
Zralka and Hermes 2009:155). Thus, graf.ti could have been used to preserve thesememoriesasprivate, personal “snapshots” or “family albums”(Vidal Lorenzo and Muñoz Cosme 2009:116).Incidentally,the graf.ti discussed here contain the only images wehaveof PlandeAyutla royalty. 
The presence of Graf.to 1 in Structure 2 is noteworthybecausethe functionofthisstructure wasritualratherthan administrative.Thisgraf.to is the well-executed representation of the god Itzamnaj as an anthropomorphicbird, an image that also appearsatthe siteof Tz’ibatnah, north­east of Uaxactun, although not inside a temple (Ková.c 2014:38).The skillexhibitedinGraf.to 1 may indicate that only skilled artisans were

allowedto decoratethe temple.Thefact that the graf.to is located higher above the .oor than most graf.tialsois noteworthy. UnlikePatrois’ proposal(2013),it seemsthat thereisnoassoci­ationamong height and masteryofthe drawings at thesite.All thesespeci.cs concerning Graf­.to1,along with its location and iconographic content, provide evidence that this image had a ritual function that was different from those located in domestic architecture(Hermes et al. 2001:66). 
Priortothe discovery of thePlandeAyutla graf.ti, we had limited information about this type of art in the Usumacinta basin. We can now incorporate images from this region into theexisting corpusof Maya graf.tifromother areas such as Palenque (Robertson 1983;Ruz Lhuiller 1955), La Mar, El Cayo, and Piedras Negras (Andrews 1980;Maler1903). This col­lection enables us to further delve into the peculiarities and richness of this artistic man­ifestation of the ancient Maya. The Plan de

Ayutla graf.ti additionally provide evidence regardingthe culturalpractices representedinthe images, such as the participation of the site in political spheres extending beyond the regional level.
