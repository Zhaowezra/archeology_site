THE EL GIGANTE ROCKSHELTER: 
PRELIMINARY OBSERVATIONS ON AN EARLY TO 
LATE HOLOCENE OCCUPATION IN SOUTHERN HONDURAS 

Timothy E. Scheffler, Kenneth G. Hirth, and George Hasemann 
The El Gigante rockshelter in highland Honduras was occupied as early as 10,000 years B.P. and provides information pre­viously lacking about the earliest periods of Honduran and Central American prehistory. Three distinct cultural horizons were identified and dated at the site using conventional and accelerator mass spectrometry radiocarbon dates that corre­spond to the Early Archaic, the Middle Archaic, and the Formative to Classic periods. Dry conditions within the rockshel­ter resulted in excellent archaeological preservation across all time periods. Excavations documented a clear sequence of residential activity represented by well-defined cultural strata containing hearth and pit features as well as dense deposits oflithic, macrobotanical, and faunal remains. The variety of food items found throughout the transition from foraging to food production suggests the long-term maintenance of diet breadth in the context of a mixed and flexible subsistence econ­omy. The El Gigante site reveals key information regarding the early occupation of Central America, the flora and fauna 
resources used by middle Holocene foragers, and the domesticated plant species cultivated during the late Holocene occu­pation of the rockshelter. 
La cueva de El Gigante en las tierras altas de Honduras Jue ocupada tan temprano como 10,000 anos a.P. y da informaci6n previamente desconocida sobre la prehistoria de Honduras. Las condiciones climaticas secas resultan en una excelente preser­vaci6n de esta area residencial. Las excavaciones documentaron una clara secuencia de ocho estratos culturales bien definidos que contienen hogares, as{ como dep6sitos densos de Utica, y restos microbotanicos y faunfsticos. Basandose en metodos de fechamiento de radiocarbon convencional y AMS, se identificaron tres horizontes culturales distintos. La ocupaci6n mas antigua es de la Jase Esperanza, la cual representa ocupaci6n delArcaico Temprano que se extiende entre 10,040--9100 a.P. La segunda es la fase Marca/a que corresponde al periodo Arcaico Media, entre 7350-6050 a.P. La tercera y mas reciente ocupaci6n en estas cuevas es en la Jase Estanzuela, entre 3900-1500 a.P. El Gigante Jue usado como residencia durante los dos periodos def Arcaico. Varias puntas de proyectil largas fueron recuperadas en niveles estratigrdficos claramente identificados coma def Paleoindio. El examen de los datos faunfsticos muestra que, mientras disminuyen los hue sos de mamiferos grandes, aumen­tan los de mamiferos de menor tamano y los de animates no mamiferos. Una gran cantidad de mafz (Zea sp.) esta presentc en el sitio durante el periodo Estanzuela. La variedad de materiales de comida encontrados entre la transici6n sugiere el man­tenimiento a largo plazo de una amplitud dietetica en el contexto de una economfaflexible y mezclada. El Gigante es un sitio que revela informaci6n clave en relaci6n a la colonizaci6n inicial de Centroamerica y la incorporaci6n de especies domesti­cadas dentro de una base de forrajeo que acompana a la transici6n a la agricultura.

Costa Rica (Clark and Cheetham 2002; but see 
Snarskis 1979). This vacuum needs to be filled if 
we are to develop a comprehensive understanding 
of human adaptation during the early and middle 
Holocene periods throughout middle America. 
Late Paleoindian occupations have been reported from several sites in Central America. The evidence for late Paleoindian occupations consists largely of fluted bifaces recovered in stratigraphic contexts at sites such as Los Tapiales in highland Guatemala (Gruhn et al. 1977) and Cueva de Los Vampiros on the southern coast of Panama (Pear­son 2002; Pearson and Cooke 2003). Investiga­tions have also documented manufacturing locales of fluted points at quarry sites at both Turrialba, Costa Rica (Snarskis 1979), and the sites of Nieto (Pearson 2003) and La Mula West (Ranere 2006) on the Pacific coast of Panama. It is clear that Paleo­indian foragers carrying Clovis technology extended throughout Central American and reached as far south as Panama during the late Pleistocene. 
Less well known are sites where the Late Paleo­indian-to-Early Archaic transition can be identi­fied and followed into the early Holocene. Recent excavations at the El Gigante rockshelter in the Marcala region of southern Honduras (Scheffler 2008) have identified the presence of Early Archaic foragers who represent the early stages of this tran­sition. The Early Archaic foragers at El Gigante occupied the rockshelter periodically throughout the year where they hunted, collected tree fruits, and exploited maguey and other resources. Their hunting technology included both fluted and unfluted projectile points that they used to exploit deer and arange of other large and small mammals. Research at El Gigante documents the adaptation of Early and Middle Archaic foragers to a mid-ele­vation highland valley of southern Honduras. 
Of particular interest to researchers is the devel­opment and spread of maize agriculture from south­ern Mexico into adjacent areas of Guatemala and Central America. The earliest dated macroremains of maize from southern Mexico are from the Tehuacan Valley in Puebla and Guila Naquitz in the Valley of Oaxaca, where cob fragments have been dated to between 5400 and 4 700 B .P. (Piperno and Flannery 2001:2101). Phytolith and starch grains recovered from stone tools and stratigraphic levels at the Xihuatoxtla rockshelter document the earlier presence of maize in the central Balsas River drainage by 8700 B .P. (Piperno et al. 2009; Ranere et al. 2009). Maize spread south into Central Amer­ica, reaching Panama perhaps as early as 7600 B .P. (Piperno and Pearsall 1998; Ranere et al. 2009:5014). Pollen cores from western Honduras suggest that maize was cultivated by slash-and-bum agriculturalists in this region by 5000-4500 B .P. (Rue 1989; Webster et al. 2005). The excavations at El Gigante have recovered a sample of more than 9,000 maize cobs, cob fragments, husks, and stalk segments from late Holocene deposits, indicating that maize agriculture was a central component of the subsistence system by 2300-2200 B.P. 
Explorations at El Gigante reveal a discontinu­ous occupation spanning nearly 9,000 years dur­ing the early to late Holocene periods. This report provides a broad outline of the major occupation episodes at El Gigante and demonstrates what the ongoing analysis of excavation remains can reveal about the human occupation and adaptation in the region beginning as early as I 0 ,000 B .P. El Gigante straddles the transition from Paleoindian forgers to the appearance of sedentary agricultural popula­tions and can significantly broaden our under­standing of cultural adaptations in central Honduras during the early to late Holocene. 
El Gigante Rockshelter 
El Gigante is located at 1,300 m asl along the west side of the Estanzuela River north of the town of Marcala, La Paz (Figure 1). The area is dominated by pine-oak (Pinus-Quercus) forest, which transi­tions to a sweet gum forest (Liquidambar styraci­flua) above 1,500 m. The Estanzuela River is an upper tributary of the Lempa River and forms part of the greater Pacific watershed. Bedrock through­out the region is an ignimbrite tuff composed of welded ash,purnice, and pyroclastic debris. This tuff is part of the Padre Miguel Formation, which orig­inated in the Miocene and Pliocene epochs from 23 to 1.5 million years ago. El Gigante was formed by a relic channel of the Estanzuela River that under­cut the ignimbrite tuff to carve out the rockshelter. Observations indicate that there was little to no ero­sion of the rockshelter during the Holocene. As a result cultural materials deposited here over the last 
10,000 years have been well preserved. Downcutting by the Estanzuela River has iso­lated the rockshelter on an elevated shelf within the

face of a 6-m vertical scarp. The rockshelter mea­sures 42 m across its mouth, 17 m deep, and more than 12 m high (Figure 2). The site's location in the vertical cliff face has made access difficult through­out the length of human occupation, and a ladder is required to enter it today. The cave has approx­imately 357 m2 of horizontal floor area, which slopes from north to south, with the north end 3-5 m higher than the south. On the basis of physical evidence collected during stratigraphic excava­tions, we believe that the rockshelter existed much

as it does today throughout the period of human occupation. 
The possibility of early occupation in the region was first suggested by Bullen and Plowden (1963) and later reiterated by MacNeish (1986; MacNeish and Nelken-Temer 1983). Bullen and Plowden originally argued for a Paleoindian occupation based on the presence of aceramic sites with bifa­cial projectile points made of obsidian. This pos­sibility was questioned because the La Esperanza obsidian source is located just 22 km northwest of
