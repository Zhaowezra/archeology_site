hen Amerindians colonized theWest Indies beginning 6,000–8,000 years ago, they encountered a terrestrial fauna rich in endemic species but poor in large-bodied taxa. Unsurprisingly, they sought to “stock the larder” by introducing a suite of non-nativemammals fromthe continental Amer-icas,including the dog(Canislupus familiaris), agouti (Dasyprocta sp.), opossum (Didelphis marsupialis), and domestic guinea pig(Cavia

Most species introductions occurred duringthe CeramicAge (ca. 500 BC–AD 1500) when an in.ux of Saladoid migrants associated with pottery and crop cultivation moved into the islands from northern South America (Wilson 2007). While often considered a historic introduction (e.g., Baker et al. 2015; Heffel.nger 2011; Long 2003), deer (family Cervidae) are among the exotic taxa appearingintheWest Indian archae­ological record of this period. Their skeletal remains are typically attributed to white-tailed (Odocoileus virginianus)and brocket(Mazama spp.) deer,which are nativetoCentral America and northern lowland South America, raising questions about their origins, mode of intro­duction, and the cultural stimulus for their anthropogenicdispersal(Figure1). Comprehen­sivereconstructionofprehistoric insular deer dis­tributionhasbeen complicatedbyunderreporting and incomplete publication of .nds, thwarting broader syntheses that could advance under­standing of the economic and socio-symbolic signi.canceof deerintheregion’sprehistory.By comparison, in lowland South America and the lowerOrinoco interaction sphere—theultimate source of the Saladoid diaspora—indigenous peoples’ engagement with deer is known to have been multifaceted. In these areas, deer are a source of prey and industrial raw material but also mythological actors, allegorical .gures, and, as iegue, persons in their own right, tamed, adopted, and socially assimilatedinto communi­ties(Cormier 2003;Erikson2000;Fausto2007; Norton 2015;Olsen 2013; Viveiros de Castro 2005). A critical question for the West Indies is whether this ontological framework accom­panied deer transportedfromthe continent into theislands and, more fundamentally,whether we can even be certain that live deer, as opposed to body parts,wereintroduced.Were Amerindians moving large-bodied game across signi.cant watergaps?Weretheyengagingin theexchange of products derived from deer bone and antler? Or were theyperhaps doing both? 
The issue of live introduction versus the import of parts arises wherever exotic animal remains appearinthearchaeological record,par­ticularly when associated relativeabundances are low, therangeofskeletal elementsisrestricted, specimens show modi.cation consistent with being exchange items, or written records are lacking (e.g., Giovas 2017;Giovaset al. 2016; Laffoon et al. 2014, 2016; Miller et al. 2016; Pluskowski 2004;Sykes et al.2006,2011).Here, I review known prehistoric deer records for the West Indiesand presentthe.rstfull reportinpub­licationoffour newrecords for cervidspecimens fromthe Sabazan and Grand BaysitesonCar­riacou and Pearls site on Grenada.Idiscussthe

Biogeographic and Archaeological 
Background 

TheWestIndies (hereusedsynonymously with the Caribbean) comprise the Greater Antilles, LesserAntilles, Bahamas, andTurks and Caicos archipelagos, along with Trinidad and Tobago, Aruba, Bonaire, Curaçao, and the Los Roques group (a cluster of ~350 small cays) lying offoftheVenezuelan coast(Figure2). Due to Pleistocene connection with South America, Trinidadian faunal communities are continen­tal and are excluded from the biogeographic Caribbean (Ricklefs and Bermingham 2008). Red brocket deer (Mazama americana) occur naturallyonTrinidadandare listedashistorically extirpated for Tobago (Kenny 2008; Murphy 2004), where the natural versus anthropogenic origin of their presence is unclear (Steadman and Stokes 2002). They do not have a native distribution in the Antilles.1 A subspecies of white-tailed deer(O. v. margaritae, sometimes elevated to species status, O. margaritae)is considered endemic to Isla Margarita, which once joinedVenezuelavialand bridge (Eisenberg 1989; Molina and Molinari 1999; Rodríguez and Rojas-Suárez 1995). White-tailed deer are notedasaprecolumbian introductiononCuraçao (Heffel.nger 2011), wheretheyalso occur today (Eisenberg 1989), and on Cubagua (Reitz 1992), butthese determinationsareproblematic.2 This

study focuses on the culturalgroups of thepre­columbianWest Indies.Eastern Central Ameri­can islands arethereforeexcluded. 
The West Indies was .rst settled around 6200BC with thearrivalof peopletoTrinidad, probablyfromVenezuela(Boomert 2013).Cuba, Hispaniola, and Puerto Rico were colonized in the 5th and 4th millennia BC, and most remaining islands were subsequently settled in a series ofcomplex, asynchronous events possi­blyoriginatingfrommultiple mainland sources (Giovas and Fitzpatrick 2014;Keegan and Hof­man 2017). Exotic mammaltranslocations post­date 500 BC and the onset of the Ceramic Age, a catchall cultural chronological unit that extends up to European contact (Giovas 2016, 2017;Giovaset al. 2012;Grouard 2002, 2010; Grouardet al. 2013;Kimuraetal. 2016;LeFeb­vre and deFrance 2014; Newsom and Wing 2004; Stahl 2009;Wing 2008). A review of CeramicAge culturaldiversity (seeKeeganetal. 2013;Wilson2007)isbeyond thescopeof this article, but it may be noted that most island peoples were forager-horticulturalists who pro­duced .ne ceramics(Petersenet al. 2004); cul­tivatedcrops likemanioc(Manihot escuelenta), sweet potato(Ipomoea batatas), and maize(Zea mays;Berman and Pearsall 2008;Mickleburgh andPagán-Jiménez 2012); andexploiteda range of marineand terrestrialresources(Newsomand Wing 2004).

Methods 
I performed an extensive—primarily English, French, and Spanish language—literature review to compile all possibleprehistoric and protohis­toric Amerindian records of deer remainsfrom theWestIndies. Selected databases and museum collections were also consulted. Full details of the literature search and analytic methods are provided in Supplemental File S1. I cannot claimtohaveidenti.ed allrecords as thereare undoubtedlyinstances wheretheseweremissed due to under-publication and accessibility issues. SupplementalTableS2compilesrecords forpre­viously reported specimens, representing a total of27 sitesonsix islands,and includes datafrom areviewofElizabethWing’s zooarchaeological analysis cards for multiple sites on Trinidad and Curaçao, archived by the Environmental Archaeology Program,Florida Museum of Nat­ural History(FLMNH; see Supplemental File S1 for additional details). These datawereusedwith Wing’skind permission (cited hereas “unpub­lished data”); any errors in their rendition are myown. SupplementalTableS2lists the number of identi.ed specimens (NISP) and minimum number of individuals(MNI), whereavailable; unknown or ambiguous quantitative information is indicated as “data de.cient.” Reported speci­mens include instances of worked bone, de.ned as any skeletal element exhibiting modi.cation consistent with intentional subtraction of bone that occurs secondaryto carcass butchery(i.e., initial butchery cutmarks are not considered “working”),including formal artifacts, preforms, and production waste. 
Four new records from Carriacou and Grenada and a .fth unpublished Grenadian record (Stokes 1990) are presented here (SupplementalTable S2).These.ve records are the sole instances of which I am aware for the occurrence of deer specimens in theprehistoric LesserAntilles. Identi.cationprotocolsfor these specimens considered morphology, size, current problems in Neotropical deer phylogeny, and possible con.ation with historically introduced sheep (Ovis aries) and goats (Capra hircus; Supplemental File S1). Size differences may be used to tentatively distinguish between two candidate deer taxa: the generally smaller Mazama spp. and larger O. virginianus (Figure1). Neotropical O. virginianus (30– 50 kg) tend to be more gracile than theirNorth American counterparts,however,overlappingin body mass with the larger brockets, especially the red brocket, M. americana (24–48 kg, up to

65 kg; Emmons and Feer 1997);thus attributions basedonsize aregivenwitha confer designation. Forpreviously published specimens,Imaintain the original taxonomic attributions given (Supplemental Table S2) but caution against placing undue con.dence in these, especially at the species or subspecies level. 


NewRecordsof Cervid Specimensin the 
West Indies 

Grenada 
The Ceramic Age site of Pearls, on Grenada’s Atlantic coast, provides two new deer records originating from excavations conducted by WilliamKeeganandAnnCodyin 1989(Keegan 1991;Figure2).Radiocarbon assays datethe site toabout230 BC–AD400(Haviser 1997;Keegan 1991), although recent critical appraisalofthese dates suggests they may be several centuries too old (Hanna 2017). Artifacts such as ceramic wares and greenstone pendants exhibit stylistic af.nitieswith EarlyCeramicAgesiteselsewhere in the Lesser Antilles, as well as Puerto Rico and South America (Keegan 1991). Disturbance from development, cultivation, and looting has affected the Pearls site since its initialexcavation by Bullen (1964) in 1962, necessitating cau­tious considerationofdeer specimen contextand provenance, discussed below. Direct dating of specimenswasprecludedby theirsmall sizeand rarity.Vague reportsof historic white-tailed deer introductionexistforGrenada(Lever 1985;Long 2003)but withoutanyevidenceforestablishment in the wild. No deer are present on the island today (Heffel.nger 2011). 
The .rst cervid specimen from Pearls is a worked, distal metatarsal identi.ed by the author to cf. Odocoileus sp. based on larger size(Figure3a–b and Supplemental Figure S3; Supplemental Table S2). The “confer” desig­nation re.ects the potential for size overlap with Mazama spp., while attribution only to genus re.ects current uncertainty about the num­ber of species within Neotropical Odocoileus. Keegan received the metatarsal from a local individual who reported recovering it from the site (William Keegan, personal communication 2015). It shows a groove-and-snap technique for separation of the distal articular end from theshaft. Thetransverse cut,located wherethe proximal endof theartifactwouldhavejoined the shaft,exhibitsabeveled edge. Modi.ed epiphy­sesofthistype are commoninitialwaste products in the manufacture of long bone shafts into tubes and blanks intended forfurther re.nement into beads, pins, needles, and perforators/awls (Choyke and Tóth 2013;Emery 2008; Lyman 2015; Stahl and Athens 2001). The metatarsal has beenburnishedtoahighluster,however,with thebeveled edge .nely .nished, suggestingthis object couldhave been the desired .nal product. It may have been a pendant, with the anterior foramen employed for suspension, although no macroscopic signs of wear are evident along the foramen margin. Alternatively, the polish and .nished edge couldbemodi.cations added laterby the collector.Theworked metatarsalis virtually identical in form and manufacturing technique to a specimen from a secure archae­ological context onCarriacou described below. Itis also similartoworkedlong bone specimens illustrated by Wing for the Quinam site on Trinidad (Wing, unpublished data) and nearly identicaltoworkedmetapodialsfromtheSt.John and Quinam collections heldbytheYalePeabody Museum(Figure4). This consistency with .nds elsewhere in the region suggests that despite missing provenience, this object maywellbeof prehistoric Grenadian origin. 
The second Pearls specimen, previously describedinan unpublishedfaunal report(Stokes 1990),is thediastema portionof a left mandible securelyidenti.ed to Artiodactyla witha “con­fer” designation to O. virginianus that re.ects the specimen’s fragmentary nature (“confer” was subsequently omitted in Stokes’s [1990] report; Figure3c and Supplemental Figure S4; SupplementalTable S2).Exclusionofovicaprids is possible based on the relatively smaller size and more sharply de.ned anterior margin of the mental foramen in Mazama sp. and O. virginianus compared to O. aries and C. hircus, as well as gracility of the diastema (length relativeto breadth),whichtendstobethickerand stockier in ovicaprids. The “cf. O. virginianus” attribution was con.rmed by the author based on FLMNH Environmental Archaeology refer­ence collections; the specimen was considered

Regarding context, Stokes (1990:6) noted the absence of signs for recent cultivation in the excavatedareabut, due to concernsoverlooting, chose to analyze faunal samples solely “from deep levels which appear to be pristine.” The mandibular specimen derives from these “pris­tine” samplesrecovered fromthe4 mmscreen fraction of sediments excavated 120–130 cm below datum. 
Carriacou 
Cervid .nds from Carriacou, 27 km north of Grenada, come fromthe contemporaneous Late CeramicAge village sitesofSabazan and Grand Bay(ca. AD 400–1400; Fitzpatrick and Giovas 2011;Giovas2013,2016;Figure2).Excavations at the Sabazan site were led by the author between 2005 and 2014 (Giovas 2013, 2016) and at Grand Bay by Scott Fitzpatrick, Quetta Kaye, and Michiel Kappers between 2003 and 2014 (Fitzpatrick et al. 2009a,2014)and indicate signi.cant interactionwith boththe northern and southernCaribbean. 
The Sabazan specimen(Find 08CSZ000158) is the most elaborately worked ofthe new .nds described here and was recovered in situ at a depth of105 cm below datum from stratigraph­ically intact deposits.Anassociated AMSassay providesadateofAD890–990 (OS-71464, 1100 ± 20BP;Giovas 2013, 2016).Thespecimenisa left mandible with the anterior body, coronoid process, condyle, and superior portion of the ramus removed(Figure3d and Supplemental Figure S5; SupplementalTable S2).The lateral (buccal) surface has been incised with curvi­linear designs reminiscent of pottery motifs in the region, while the medial (lingual) aspect has three triangularly arranged, drilled holes recallingsimilartri-pointed and chevron patterns seen in Caribbean artifacts of shell, stone, and other media(Bercht et al. 1997;Mol 2006:107; Petersen et al. 2004). Function is unknown, but perforations suggest ornamental suspension or attachment to another object. Perforation

margins show no macroscopic signs of wear, however. Like the Pearls metatarsal, the mandible has been burnished to a high luster. Teeth are absent, but a single remaining root fragment indicates these may have been pur­posefullyextractedinthemanufacturingprocess.

Like that specimen, it may have beena pendantbut does not show any signsof polishorattritionalongtheforamen margin.This specimen has not beenburnished, however, and the worked(proximal) edge is slightly ragged.

Review:Distribution and Natureof PrecolumbianWest Indian Cervid Specimens 
Including the new records, deer specimens are recorded for a total of 29 sites from seven West Indian islands: Trinidad, Tobago, Aruba, Curaçao, IslasLos Roques,Grenada, and Carriacou (Supplemental Table S2). Excluding Trinidad andTobago, therecordforWest Indian deer specimens comprises 11 known sites on .ve islands lying outside the natural range of cervids. It remains possible that deer skeletal material is more widely distributed in the pre­historic Caribbean than appears based on this summary.Under-publication(gray literature)of deer records, fragmentationormodi.cationthat impedes taxonomic attribution of skeletal spec­imens, and lack of systematic screening of sed­iments in older excavations may have all con­tributed to missed specimens and distributional bias. 
Notwithstanding these issues, some general patterns emerge. Insular records for deer spec­imens are con.ned to the southern Caribbean, particularly the islands along the Venezuelan coast(Figure2). At leasttwo genera, Mazama and Odocoileus, appear to have been introduced to non-native contexts,with Carriacou, IslasLos Roques, and Curaçao possessing records for both.As discussed below, collectiverecords also suggests cervidspecimens areassignableto one of three categories: 1) unmodi.ed specimens consistent with food remains; 2) worked spec­imens,including formal artifacts; and3)worked specimens with possibleritual or socio-symbolic signi.cance.Available quantitative dataindicate the distribution of these specimen types is not uniform acrossislands. 
Unmodi.ed Cervid Specimens 
Larger cervid assemblages composed primarily of unmodi.ed specimens with occasional traces of burning and cutmarks, such as those from Cedros (NISP = 73),Erin(NISP = 238),Man­zanilla (NISP = 169),Palo Seco (NISP = 936), Quinam (NISP = 626), St. Catherines (NISP = 76), and possibly St. John (NISP unknown, MNI = 24),all onTrinidad, are consistent with subsistence-focused exploitation of deer (see SupplementalTableS2and references therein). The human behavioral implications of assem­blages with very low (NISP = 2) counts of unmodi.ed bone arelessclear. Suchlow counts areseen atTanki Flip,Aruba; Pearls,Grenada; Grand Bay, Carriacou; and DosMosquises and Domusky Norte, Islas Los Roques—all non­native contexts—and may relate to artifact pro­duction,a considerationtowhichIreturn below. 
Worked Cervid Specimens 
Worked deer bones, including formal artifacts, comprise at least 26 and possibly 38 or more specimens, with no evident bias toward taxon (Table1and SupplementalTable S2).Acrossall islands,workedmetapodials, likethoserecorded forCuraçao, Carriacou, Grenada, andTrinidad, areacommonform(n= 10).OnTrinidad, trans­versely and longitudinally split long bone shaft fragments, frequently derived from metapodials (n= 7)and tibiae(n= 3), occur with comparative regularity,asdomodi.ed antlers(Figure4;Sup­plementalTable S2).Harris(1973:121, Figure 3k),forexample, reports “splintersof deer bone ofvaryinglength” from theTrinidadian Banwari Trace site, the size and shape of which suggest intentional splittingtoprovide rawmaterialfor themanufactureofobjects, such as the48bone projectile points also recovered there. Modi.ed antler from Erin(n = 1) and Quinam(n = 1; Figure4) and “suspiciously smooth deer horn tips” (Harris 1973:121, sic) fromBanwariTrace (n = 4) and St.John(n = 2), all on Trinidad, mayrepresentawls,tattooing implements, antler punches, or knapping tools (Boomert 2000). The Banwari Trace and St. John assemblages also contain worked bone in the form of pins, needles, and possible noseor ear ornaments,but thesource fortheseis uncertain and potentially attributabletoother largeTrinidadian mammals, such as peccaries.

personal adornment that might signify identity or rank. Beyond theproblem of taxonomic recog­nitionpresentedby highlymodi.ed bone (e.g., vonHolsteinet al. 2014), thesubjectivenessof this categorymakes quanti.cationdif.cult.For example,aperforated,workedvertebra fromDos Mosquises, Los Roques (Antczak and Antczak 2006:Figure 412), and the Pearls burnished metatarsal(Figure3a–b) areincluded here as possible pendants/ornaments,but not theGrand Baymetacarpal(Figure3e),which, while similar in form to the Pearls metatarsal,lacks “.nishing” and is more consistent with debitage resulting from bone tool production(Emery 2008;Stahl and Athens 2001). Likewise, antler fragments from a burial urn at the Savaneta site, Aruba (van Heerkeren 1960), are excluded because although a mortuary association is evident, the ritual signi.cance is uncertain. 
At most, seven or eight symbolically signi.cant specimens from four sites on threeislands are recorded (Table1; due to small sample size, relative frequencies are not considered).Foremostamong theseisthe incised mandiblefrom Sabazan. While precise function is unknown, its .ne workmanship, iconographic consistency with the wider region, and lustrous surface—an aesthetic property prized by Caribbean Amerindians (Oliver 2000)—point to socio-symbolic status correlates, which the object mayhaveserved toreify.The remaining symbolically charged objects consist of .ve Mazama and Odocoileus bone aerophones (wind instruments) fromDos Mosquises and Cayo Sal, LosRoques,recoveredfrom contexts radiocar­bon dated between about AD 1200 and European contact (Antczak 1995; Antczak and Antczak 2006:Figure 408).Theyare made from deer radii andpossessthreeorfour perforationsononeside, with a single perforation near the area of mouth placement on the opposing side. One specimen shows traces of red paint (Antczak 1995). Aerophone use is ethnographically widespread among South American indigenous peoples (e.g., Stahl and Athens 2001), includinginVenezuela, which lies 130 km south of Islas Los Roques. AmongtheWaraoof northeasternVenezuela,for instance, men today construct muhusemoituma “.utes” fromthetibiaofdeer obtainedbyhunting (Olsen 2013). Because of physical variation in the deer and theinstrument maker/player,notwo aerophones are the same, and each possesses a unique tonal property that blends with others when played together at festivals and other specialevents(Olsen 2013). Curiously,all .ve aerophones and all unmodi.ed appendicular elementsreportedfor DosMosquises and Cayo Sal areleft-sided (NISP = 8;Antczak1995).The

selective retention ofanimal parts from one side ofa carcass for speci.c usein ceremonial rites has previously been recorded in Amerindian societies(e.g.,Ingraham et al. 2015). Laterality in the Los Roques deer assemblages may thus re.ect adherence to ritual prescriptions. Alternatively, this pattern could represent a functional constraintof aerophone useor, taking into account the small sample size, simply the chance result of carcass handling decisions. Interestingly, the Sabazan incised mandible is also left-sided, although the unmodi.ed mandiblefromDomusky Norte, also in theLos Roques islands,isright. 


Synthesis:Patterninginthe Precolumbian 
West Indian Cervid Record 

While prehistoricWest Indian cervidrecords are relatively few, the available data signal three trendsin cerviddistributionfor theregion. First, theproportionofworkedtounworkedbone tends to be much greater on islands where deer are exotic. Second, the range of skeletal elements present in exotic contexts is low and gener­ally limited to a similar restricted set of bones (e.g., radii, metapodials, mandibles, podials). This contrasts with the high element diversity for locations where deer are native. Finally, unmodi.ed skeletal elements recovered from islands where deer are exotic tend to correspond to thesameelementsusedinthe productionof formal artifacts (e.g., radii, mandibles) or are consistent with bone debitage orwasteproducts anticipated in the manufacture of such objects or bone blanks (e.g., metapodial and mandibular fragments, podials). 
Quantitative datashowincreased relative fre­quencies of worked to unworked bone for sites on islands where deer are not native(50–100%: Curaçao, Islas Los Roques, Grenada, and Car­riacou; Aruba excluded) compared to Trinidad (< 4%), wherelivedeer occurredprehistorically (Table1).Theformer cases include sites, such as Sabazan and Cayo Sal, where deer bones occur exclusively as formal artifacts. While assem­blage size for non-native contexts is small, this in itself may be meaningful: when deer occur in exotic locales, their skeletal remains tend to be worked in some fashion and are introduced in limited quantities. That absolute numbers of worked bone are actually similar across sites (n = 1to6 specimens)irrespectiveof whether they occur on nativeor non-nativeislands rein­forces this interpretation and gives the impres­sion that assemblages from the latter settings have been expunged of unmodi.ed specimens constituting subsistence remains. Notably, there is no a priori reason to expect that non-native animals consumed for food will necessarily be rare in the record. The fragmented remains of introduced agouti and opossum, for instance, occur throughout the Lesser Antilles in much larger quantitiesthan deer,typically in middens and with cutmarks andburningthat substantiate theirdietary contribution(Giovas 2013, 2016; Grouard 2001, 2002, 2010;Newsom andWing 2004). The absence of subsistence-correlated cervidspecimens for non-nativeislands suggests deerwerenotregularly consumedintheseplaces. 
Element diversity offers additional evidence. Delsol and Grouard’s (2016; see also Delsol et al. 2015)analysis of element representation for M. americana at the Manzanilla site (ca. AD 400–1400) onTrinidad (Boomert 2000)pro­vides quantitativedatasupportingthe association between a diversity of deer elements present and assemblages representing dietary remains in a context where live deer are available for exploitation. In the Manzanilla cervid assem­blage (NISP = 169), femora, pelvic elements, scapula, humeri, radii,and tibiaeexhibitthehigh­estincidencesof occurrence(> 10% NISP each), while metatarsals,tarsals, andvertebral elements arelower(< 6% NISP each; Delsol and Grouard 2016;Delsoletal. 2015). Based on a similarly broad rangeofelements, Stahland Athens(2001) inferred theintroductionofwhole deer carcasses for consumptionattheLa Chimbasite(700BC– AD 250) in the Andean highlands of Ecuador. While not quanti.ed,Wing’s(unpublished data) zooarchaeological data likewise reveal a full complement of M. americana axial and appen­dicular elementsatQuinam,Palo Seco, and Erin onTrinidad. 
TheTrinidadian data can be contrasted with element representation at the 11 sites on .ve islands where deer are not native (Aruba, Curaçao, LosRoques,Grenada, and Carriacou). Here, most of the elements seen at sites like

Manzanilla are absent. Among the21specimens present, radii are the most common (n = 7), followedbymetapodials(n= 4),mandibles(n= 3),tarsals(n = 2),vertebrae(n= 2), andasingle example each of a femur, frontal, and antler fragment (excluding the unquanti.ed Savaneta antlers). There is a lack of element diversity and a heavy emphasis on cortically dense, rel­atively straight bones (radii, metapodials, and the single femur), which are often favored for artifact manufacture (Choyke and Tóth 2013; Emery 2008;Lyman2015).Indeed, most,though not all, of these specimens have been worked. The sample is small, but this pattern suggests that bones entered sites as raw material for artifact manufactureoras .nished objectsrather than live animals or semi-whole carcasses. This seeminglylow-utility element pattern is not the product of carcass scavenging by Amerindians (e.g., Binford 1984;Blumenschine1986), since scavenging opportunities can only exist where animals areviablyestablishedinthewild.High skeletal element diversity at Manzanilla and the otherTrinidadian sitesindicates good preserva­tionfor theregion, suggestingthat the observed patterningisalso not drivenbydensity-mediated bone attrition (Grayson 1989; Lyman 1993), although additional con.rmation is needed. A similar pattern of selective element representa­tion with increased distance from native source has been observed for Iron Age fallow deer (Dama dama)remainsin northernEurope, where itis suggestedthatthedisproportionatepresence of antlerand metapodialsrelatesto theirimport fromthe Mediterraneanformagico-religiousand medicinal use(Miller et al. 2016; Sykes et al. 2006, 2011). 
A .nal trend for non-nativeislands involves a correspondence between the elements occur­ringas unmodi.ed/minimallyworked specimens and those occurring as .nished artifacts or as anticipated wasteproductsintheir manufacture. This correlation suggests the restricted intro­duction of skeletal parts associated with craft production. The radii aerophones (Cayo Sal and Dos Mosquises, Los Roques), the worked metatarsals (St. Jan, Curaçao; Pearls,Grenada), and theworked mandible(Sabazan, Carriacou), forinstance,havecounterpartsinthe unmodi.ed radii(Cayo Sal,Los Roques), distal metapodials (GrandBay,Carriacou),and unworkedmandibu­larspecimens (Pearls,Grenada; DomuskyNorte, Las Roques). The presence of deer tarsals at Tanki Flip,Aruba, and DosMosquises couldbe explained as riders associated with metatarsals targeted for bone tool production. 
At the Dos Pilas site in the Maya lowlands of Guatemala, Emery(2008) has documented a manufacturing sequence for specialized pro­duction of blanks and .nished bone tools that begins with the removal of debitage (typically long bone epiphyses), moves to core (bone tube) production, and is followed by reduction to blanks and further re.nement into .nished objects. These sequential stages are associated with characteristic modi.ed forms and debris, some of which are seen in the West Indian cervid assemblages. Stage 1 transversely cut epiphyses (waste), Stage 2 cores, and Stage 3 and 4 blanks are recorded at Palo Seco and Quinam,Trinidad, forexample(Supplemental TableS2).Fewerof theseforms occuron islands where deer are exotic, however. When formal artifacts in these latter contexts are excluded from consideration, the remaining specimens correspond to bone debris generated in the early stageoftheproductionsequence, withevidence for Stages 2 through 4 lacking. This curious pattern for initial and terminal stage materials absent intervening products couldbedrivenby sample size or bias against the recovery and identi.cation of fragmentary remains—the Los Roques assemblages,forexample, include taxo­nomically unidenti.ed bone splinters attributed to manufacturing debris (Antczak 1995;Laffoon et al. 2016). Alternatively, formal artifacts may not have been manufactured at most sites, as suggestedbythe absence of certain production-favored elements like tibiae (Emery 2008). Strongevidence forwaste products(e.g.,Grand Baydistalmetapodials),however,suggests local manufacture, albeit perhaps on a limited scale that makes recovery of evidence for the full production sequence unlikely. Either way, the close correlation between elements present in worked and unworkedcategoriesis not apparent in Trinidadian sites because of their greater diversity in unmodi.ed elements. 
The overall pattern for non-native contexts to exhibit a restricted set of select elements with

biastowardworked bone impliesthat whole deer are not reaching theseislands.Apparently, bones and not bodies are being introduced into insular Caribbean sites. This does not preclude thelive introductionofdeer into theprecolumbianWest Indies per sebutdoes implythisscenariois less parsimonious. Recent multi-isotope analysis of one of the deer specimens considered here, the DomuskyNorte mandiblefromthe LasRoques group, indicatesa continental origin,most likely northern Venezuela, but does not provide evi­dence for or against live introduction(Laffoon et al. 2016). 


Discussion and Conclusion 
ContemporaryWestIndian ethnozoogeography is the cumulative product of long-term inter­action between diverse peoples and an ever-changing landscape. The place of deer in the deeper antiquity of this narrative has remained elusive. This investigation has sought to redress our limited understanding of the material and socio-symbolic signi.cance of deer among Amerindian groups in the insular Caribbean. Data synthesis is complicated by underreporting of .nds and limited quantitativeinformation,but some conclusions about the record and interpre­tation ofits patterning are possible. 
Insular cervidspecimens arerestrictedtothe extreme southern Caribbean, with the newly reported Carriacou and Grenada .nds repre­senting the .rst known instances of deer in the precolumbian Lesser Antilles. These new records extend the distribution of deer skeletal remains northward,beyond continentaloffshore islands, where deer would have been easier to acquire given shorter overwater distances to the mainland. Transport of animals or their parts to Carriacou and Grenada from South Amer-ica,Trinidad, Margarita,orTobagowouldhave entailedcrossingaseagapof130–180km.Wider Antillean dispersal of cervids is possible given thehighdegreeofinteraction acrossthe region during the Ceramic Age (García-Casco et al. 2013;Hofmanetal.2007,2008;Paviaetal.2013; Rodríguez Ramos 2013)andfar-.ung distribu­tion of other exotic animals, including pecca­ries(Tayassu/Pecari), jaguars(Panthera onca), armadillos(Dasypus novemcinctus), and guinea pigs, which occur both as worked specimens and subsistence refuse (Giovas 2017;Giovas et al. 2012;Grouard2002, 2010;Laffoon et al. 2014; LeFebvre and deFrance 2014;Newsom andWing 2004). 
In the South American lowlands, households often tame and keep brocket deer as pets or adoptive “children” (Antczak 1995; Cormier 2003; Erikson 2000;Norton 2015), a reminder that potential transport of tamed deer into the insular Caribbean should not be entirely dis­counted.Yet,availableevidence does not support prehistoric live deer introductions. Instead, the data1)indicateanincreaseinthe proportionof worked bone and formal artifacts to unworked or minimally modi.ed bone on islands where deer are not native;2) demonstratea contraction in the range of elements represented in these contexts, with a bias toward elements often favored for industrial use, such as radii and metapodials;and3)in thesesame contexts,show a correlation between the skeletal parts present in the workedand unworkedbone assemblages. These patternsarenotevidentonTrinidad,where livedeer were established and whereassemblage characteristicsindicatesubsistence-focused use of deer.Small sample size must temper .rm con-clusions,but takentogether,thesetrends indicate that deer parts and artifacts made from these— notlive animals—were being importedintothe islands. 
This determinationissigni.cant fortheWest Indies, where well-developed Amerindian inter­action networksfacilitatedthe dispersalof more than a dozen exotic animals (Giovas 2017; Giovasetal. 2012,2016;Kimuraetal.2016;Laf­foon et al. 2014, 2015;LeFebvre and deFrance 2014; Masseti 2011; Newsom and Wing 2004; Wing 2008). Theirarchaeological remains occur with varying abundance and degrees of mod­i.cation but without established methods for distinguishing the introduction of animal parts fromliving animals.The trends enumerated here may be used as criteria for discriminating live translocationfromthe importofbody parts.This approach, which may serve as a model for other settings, provides a foundation for parsing the differingsocioculturaltraditions and beliefs that mayhavecharacterizedthetwopractices(Giovas 2017).

It now becomes appropriate to ask questions about the trade networks through which deer parts passed and the cultural context of their use in artifact production in the prehistoric Caribbean. How were these objects viewed, and what signi.cance did they hold to warrant transport across the open ocean? This study suggests deer bone and antlerserveda utilitarian purpose, used possiblyinthe productionofawls, punches,pins, and projectile points. Other deer bone objectsfunctionedinasymbolic capacity linked to Amerindian ritual and ideology, as attested by their associations with music, per­sonal adornment, and iconographic expression, as well as possible af.liation with the dead. The luster exhibited by the polished mandible and metatarsal from Carriacou and Grenada accordwith ethnohistoric accountsofCaribbean Amerindian esteemforobjectswithshiny,re.ec­tive properties, such as shell, iridescent feathers, and guanín (a gold-copper alloyimportedfrom South America), and the bodily display of such objectsbyculture heroesand caciques (chiefs)to epitomize numinous power(Oliver 2000). Such symbolic associations nestwithin thelarger pan-Amerindian ‘aesthetic of brilliance’ in which light and shimmering objects—understood as the solid embodimentsoflight—bestowvitality and fertility and mark high status (Saunders 2005). Oliver (2000:203) has argued with respect to guanín that its value in the West Indies may have been “measured in terms of real as well as symbolic distance from its source of origin and byit being thoroughlyexotic.”Asimilar calculus ofvaluationmayhaveheldfor deer bone objects. I suggest that it was the socio-symbolic rather than strictly the material signi.cance of deer remains/artifactsthat underwrotetheirworth and drove theirdispersal northward into theislands duringthe precolumbian era. 
Moving forward it will be incumbent upon Caribbeanists to not only recognize but also appropriately document the archaeological occurrence of deer in the islands. This process may entail questioning assumptions about the taxa represented by fragmentary mammal bones or reconsideration oftaxonomic attributions for highly modi.ed artifacts. Collagen .ngerprint­ing (Cooke et al. 2016; von Holstein et al. 2014) may help in this respect as a low-cost, high-throughput alternative to aDNA analysis in a tropical region where DNA preservation is poor. In this way, we may begin to inte­grate deer bone as an artifact class into a larger framework of evidence documenting the ways in whichprecolumbian peoples acrossthe circum-Caribbean were dynamically linked by the movement of material goods, animals, and ideology.

Notes 
1. 
White-tailed deer has been reported for Trinidad (Boomert 2000;Wing 1962)butis not includedonmodern species checklists (e.g., Murphy 2004). 

2. 
Heffel.nger (2011) posits precolumbian establish­ment of white-tailed deer(O. v. curassavicus)on Curaçao basedonSpanish reports forabundant deer at contact (AD 1499). Archaeological support for this is thin, however (see Supplemental Table S2). White-tailed deer may have occurred prehistorically on Cubagua (Reitz 1992), which lies close to potential Isla Margarita andVenezuelan source populations,butWing(1961)considersdeer tobeasixteenth­century Spanish import associated with the pearl-diving industry.
