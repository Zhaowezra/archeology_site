HOUSES ON A HILL: 
CLASSIC PERIOD LIFE AT EL PALMILLO, OAXACA, MEXICO 

Gary M. Feinman, Linda M. Nicholas, and Helen R. Haines 
The increasing attention devoted to the investigation of prehispanic houses in Mesoamerica owes much theoretically and methodologically to the early household archaeology undertaken decades ago in the Valley of Oaxaca. Yet despite the large sample of Formative period houses excavated in this region, little is known about domestic life during the later Classic and Postclassic periods. In this paper we broaden the database of Classic period houses by reporting on excavations on five resi­dential terraces at El Palmillo, one of many large hilltop terraced sites in the valley that collectively housed as much as two­thirds of the region's Classic period population. Occupied for centuries, the terraces and their associated domestic compounds at El Palmillo underwent a series of coordinated episodes of wall construction, repair, and spatial modification. Craft activi­ties-especially the production of chipped stone tools and maguey fiber for cordage and cloth-were an important part of domes­tic life. The relative importance of these different household economic activities varied from terrace to terrace, indicating that domestic production was specialized and operated at the household level. Maguey and other xerophytic plants also provided important subsistence resources. Differences in access to nonlocal goods have been documented between terraces, although the extent of such variation is not marked in the present sample. Although preliminary, the El Palmillo findings provide a new empirical basis from which to examine domestic life and the economic and organizational foundations of Classic period hill­top terraced settlements in Oaxaca. These findings reflect on larger issues about the basic economy of later prehispanic Mesoamerica and the articulation of domestic units and household production into larger socioeconomic networks that theo­retically extended well beyond ancient Oaxaca.

house-to-house variation that serves as a key dimen­sion for comparing and understanding community and regional differences and change in past eco­nomic and political organizations (Flannery and Mar­cus 1994). 
Since 1976 a large corpus of literature has been published in Mesoamerica on prehispanic house­holds (e.g., Drennan 1976; Flannery 1976; Flannery and Marcus 1994; Hendon 1989; Manzanilla 1986, 1993, 1996; Marcus 1989; Santley and Hirth 1993; Sheets et al. 1990; Smith 1992; Whalen 1981; Wilk and Ashmore 1988). Through these studies, schol­ars have amassed increasing evidence that special­ized economic production in ancient Mesoamerica was centered principally (although not necessarily exclusively) in domestic/household settings (e.g., Balkansky et al. 1997; Charlton et al. 1991, 1993; Feinman 1999; Feinman and Nicholas 1993, 1995a; Hirth 1993; Smith 1993). Researchers have identi­fied a range of basic goods and products, including pottery, chipped and ground stone tools, textiles, mir­rors, and shell ornaments, that were manufactured prehispanically in residential contexts (e.g., Evans 1988; Healan 1986; Hirth 1995; Roemer 1982; Shafer and Hester 1983:529; Smith 1994; Widmer 1991). Many of these items were produced in vol­umes much greater than needed by the producing domestic unit and so likely were intended for exchange (see Costin 1991). This key economic role of prehispanic Mesoamerican households underlies a necessity to examine these domestic units, focus­ing on the nature and extent of their spatiotemporal diversity and the varied ways that they were inter­connected as the fundamental components or "build­ing blocks" of larger social entities (e.g., Small and Tannenbaum 1999). 
In the Valley of Oaxaca (Figure 1), long recog­nized as a key demographic and political region in Mesoamerica (Palerm and Wolf 1957), the large sam­ple of Early and Middle Formative (ca. 1600-500 B.C.) houses excavated by Flannery's Human Ecol­ogy Project (e.g., Drennan 1976; Flannery and Mar­cus 1994; Marcus 1998; Parry 1987; Whalen 1981; Winter 1972) has provided a perspective largely unavailable for many other regions of ancient Mesoamerica. Yet in this heartland of The Early Mesoamerican Village, little is known about "village or community life" following the Formative period (1600 B.C.-A.D. 200). The few complete Classic period (A.D. 200-800) houses excavated in the val­ley have been uncovered at the capital, Monte Alban. Yet these investigations, focusing on residential con-

texts (and terraces) (Kuttruff and Autry 1978; Martinez Lopez and Winter 1994; Winter 1974, 1995; Winter and Payne 1976), form only a small proportion of the extensive excavation at this large hilltop center (Caso et al. 1967). Outside of Monte Alban, few Classic period houses have been exca­vated; our excavations at El Palmillo augment this tiny sample, which consists largely of a domestic complex in the Ejutla Valley at the southern margins of the Valley of Oaxaca (Feinman and Nicholas 1995a, 2000b). 
In this paper, we add to the growing corpus of Classic period Valley of Oaxaca houses by present­ing findings from another large hilltop site, El Palmillo (Figure 2). Through the broad horizontal and stratigraphic excavation of five terraces at El Palmillo, we can address a series of questions regard­ing residential layout and organization, occupational duration, and subsistence practices at these hilltop terrace sites. Because hilltop sites with terraces are 
such a significant part of the Classic period landscape in Oaxaca, these findings also provide a perspective on that period's domestic economy. 
Here, our central focus is empirically grounded on terraces and how they were used, as well as unrav­eling the organization and activities associated with Classic period domestic units in Oaxaca. Neverthe­less, the larger issues that we touch on--questions about the domestic economy, the nature of systems of production, how households are articulated into larger economic units, the interdependence of house­hold units-are not restricted to Oaxaca or prehis­panic Mesoamerica (e.g., Halperin 1994; Hendon 1996; Small and Tannenbaum J 999). 
Terrace Sites 
Positioned on a hill at the nexus of the three arms that form the Valley of Oaxaca, Monte Alban has been a prime focus for archaeology in Oaxaca for the last century (Blanton J 978; Caso J 982; Caso et al. 1967). This attention is understandable given the size and extent of the site (with more than 2,000 ter­races) as well as its architectural monumentality, which is unmatched in the region. More than a cen­tury ago, Holmes ( 1897) noted that there were a large number of hilltop terraced settlements in the valley, but subsequent research has shown that none had the volume and scale of public construction found in Monte Alban's Main Plaza. 
Regional settlement pattern surveys implemented in the Valley of Oaxaca and its environs during the 1970s through 1990s (Blanton et al. 1982; Feinman and Nicholas 1990, 1996; Finsten 1996; Kowalewski et al. 1989) have provided a systematic record of the

nature and number of terraced hilltop sites in the Southern Highlands. To date, more than 100 such communities have been recorded in the central val­leys of Oaxaca. Although the practice of positioning houses on artificially flattened spaces may have begun as early as the Early Formative (ca. 1150-850 
B.C. ) (Marcus and Flannery 1996: 103 ), the first ter­raced hilltop sites were settled later (ca. 500-200 B.C.), coinciding with the initial occupation at Monte Alban (Blanton 1978; Feinman and Nicholas 1996). It was during the Classic period, however, that ter­raced hilltop communities greatly expanded in size, frequency, and geographical extent (Kowalewski et al. 1989). Many new terrace settlements were estab­lished, and some, like Monte Alban, grew markedly in size. In the Classic period, as much as two-thirds of the valley's population may have resided in these terraced sites (Kowalewski et al. 1989), with most of the region's largest Classic period communities situated above and off the valley floor. 
Given these population estimates, the function of terraces at hilltop sites and the nature and intensity of their domestic occupation are important for under­standing the demography and economy of Classic period Oaxaca. Although archaeologists working in Oaxaca generally agree that the terraces at these hill­top settlements were largely residential in function (Blanton 1978; Kowalewski et al. 1984; Winter 1974 ), this interpretation has been questioned by Santley ( 1980), who asserts the terraces were largely flattened fields or spaces for growing maize. The agricultural use of terraces in other regions of the Americas (Donkin 1979; Downum et al. 1985; Fish et al. 1984; Huntington 1912; Smith and Price 1994; Turner 1983; Wilken 1987) has lent an aura of plau­sibility to Santley's argument. 
In the Valley of Oaxaca, findings over the last sev­eral decades support the residential function of most prehispanic terraces. In his excavation of several ter­races at Monte Alban, Winter (1974) recovered domestic architectural complexes, burials, house­hold debris, and other indications that the terraces were residential. In addition, lower courses of stone foundations and other signs of domestic use have been found on a large number of terrace surfaces dur­ing intensive site-based surveys of Monte Alban (Blanton 1978), Jalieza (the region's second-largest terraced settlement [Finsten 1995]), and three hill­top communities at the extreme eastern end of the valley (Guinin, El Palmillo, and the Mitla Fortress [Feinman and Nicholas 2000a]). Such stone foun­dations and other indications (including hearths) of the domestic role of terraces also were documented at numerous settlements above the valley floor dur­ing the earlier extensive regional surveys (Blanton et al. 1982; Kowalewski et al. 1989). 
Although the findings from Winter's excavations, along with the information gained from settlement surveys, support the domestic use of terraces, the excavated sample of houses on terraces is small, pri­marily coming from just one site, Monte Alban. At the same time, our understanding of the duration of terrace occupation remains largely unknown. Were these often remote and sometimes fortified hilltop communities (e.g., Bittier 1975; Elam 1989) only short-term redoubts (Armillas 1951) or continuously occupied towns spanning decades or centuries? Strik­ingly similar debates abound over terrace function and the occupational longevity of terrace sites in northern Mexico and the American Southwest (Downum 1986; Downum et al. 1993, 1994; Fish and Fish 1989; Hard et al. 1999; McGuire and Villal­pando 1998; O'Donovan 1997; Wallace and Doelle 2001; Wilcox 1979), indicating that these queries and the stream of research toward their eventual res­olution may ramify beyond the Valley of Oaxaca. 
Because most Classic period terraced hilltop sites in the Valley of Oaxaca were situated off the valley floor where the region's most productive and well­watered farmlands are located (Kirkby 1973), ques­tions concerning the demographic profile of these sites also have subsistence and politicoeconomic implications. Many of the larger terraced hilltop set­tlements were situated in agriculturally marginal areas of the valley such as the eastern Tlacolula ann (Kowalewski et al. 1989). As a consequence, the esti­mated local populations for these sites (assuming that most terraces served as residences) and their immediate surrounds may have regularly exceeded the agricultural potential of their sustaining areas, based on the potential productivity of maize fann­ing (Nicholas 1989). The modeling of population and productivity at various scales (Feinman and Nicholas 1992; Nicholas 1989) raises significant questions concerning how the past inhabitants of these pied­mont and mountain sites fed themselves, made a liv­ing, and met all their water needs. 
During the regional and site surveys at these hill­top settlements, ample evidence of craft manufac­ture (especially ceramic production and a range of

stone-working activities) has been found repeatedly (Blanton 1978; Feinman and Nicholas 1997, 1998a, 1998b, 2000a; Finsten 1995 ; Kowalewski et al. 1989:240-245). Such production is most evident at (though certainly not limited to) terrace settlements in dry Tlacolula (Kowalewski et al. 1989:243). It therefore appears that the occupants of some ter­raced sites relied on the production of a variety of goods and likely exchanged these items for food and other needs. Although terrace-by-terrace (Blanton 1978; Finsten 1995) and site-to-site distinctions in surface debris seem to indicate that individual ter­races/social entities focused on the manufacture of different products, these distributional patterns were previously unverified by excavation prior to investi­gations at El Palmillo. In addition, how these spe­cialized manufactured goods were circulated both within and between valley sites remains poorly doc­

umented. 
Furthermore, we still understand little about the 
intrasite organization of terrace settlements, which 
in general (Monte Alban is a principal exception) 
have relatively few (and small) civic-ceremonial 
buildings relative to their areal extent. At the same 
time, these sites are composed of a series of modu­
lar units (the terraces), which in their totality form 
artificially carved hillside towns. Based on his site 
survey, Blanton (1978:66-93) proposed that Monte 
Alban was divided into 15 barrios, each composed 
of contiguous sets of terraces. Yet the social compo­
sition of these subdivisions and how they were linked 
internally and externally (intrasite) have received lit­
tle attention in Classic contexts. For example, the 
nature and extent of status and access differences 
between dwellers on different terraces has been lit­
tle defined. 
To enhance our understanding of Classic period 
household organization and domestic economy in the 
Valley of Oaxaca, we must first address a series of 
basic questions concerning terraces and terrace sites. 
We must clearly ascertain terrace function (were they 
residential or agricultural?) and define occupational 
duration (were they short-term fortifications/ 
encampments or long-term settlements?). Given that 
so many of these large hilltop communities were not 
prime localities for maize farming, more informa­
tion is needed regarding subsistence practices at these 
centers, as well as the other ways that people at these 
communities could support themselves economi­
cally. At the same time, we still know little about the ways in which the occupants of terrace sites were connected, economically or sociopolitically, with each other, or how these settlements as a whole tied into the larger regional settlement system. A better understanding of the nature of these sites can con­tribute to debates about terrace utilization and ques­tions of economic and political organization that extend beyond Oaxaca. In the remainder of this paper, we address the above issues by presenting the findings from three seasons of excavation at El Palmillo. 
El Palmillo 
Site Background 
El Palmillo was first visited and mapped by archae­ologists during the 1980 regional survey of the Val­ley of Oaxaca (Kowalewski et al. 1989; see also Feinman and Nicholas l 995b, 1996). Although the site has long been known to local inhabitants, there is no mention of El Palmillo in the accounts of early explorers and travelers who visited other ancient ruins in the region. Ignacio Bernal (1 965) included the Tlacolula subvalley in his regional reconnais­sance of prehispanic sites in Oaxaca in the 1960s, yet there is no evidence that he visited El Palmillo either, perhaps because it is in a remote location on a rocky ridge at the extreme eastern edge of the val­ley. 
In the 1990s the senior authors completed inten­sive mapping and terrace-by-terrace surface survey at three large hilltop terrace sites in eastern Tla­colula-Guirun (Feinman and Nicholas 1997, 2000a; Saville 1900, 1909), the Mitla Fortress (Bit­tier 1975; Feinman and Nicholas l 998b; Holmes 1897), and El Palmillo (Feinman and Nicholas 1998a). Although all of these sites have been affected to a degree by post-occupation activity, consisting largely of unmechanized farming on some of the larger terraces and expansive animal grazing across much of the site, the overall preservation of these ter­race sites is far better than for most prehispanic set­tlements on the valley floor. The excellent preservation in many parts of El Palmillo was one important consideration that encouraged us to initi­ate household excavations at the site. 
Based on the intensive mapping of the site (Fein­man and Nicholas 1998a), El Palmillo, with more than 1,400 terraces, is the largest Classic period ter­race site in eastern Tlacolula (Figure 3). Also called

Cerro de Sangre (or Guielreni in Zapotec ), the site is situated between 1760-2010 m on the top and western slopes of a steep rock cliff on lands of San­tiago Matatlan. On the north and east, this rock cliff is almost impassable. From the south and southeast, access to the site also is difficult, due to deep gullies and steep slopes. El Palmillo is most accessible from thewest, although to reach the top of the site requires a long uphill climb. 
The rocky ridge top is separated into two sectors by a low saddle. The northern hill, the highest part of the site, has steeply sloping sides, with bedrock outcropping over much of the surface. Most of the public architecture, incorporating this natural bedrock, was constructed along the top of this cen­tral ridge. Most of the terraces are densely packed on the western face descending from this ridge top. The smaller southern section of the ridge has a flat­ter top and fewer bedrock outcrops. There is less monumental architecture on the lower southern ridge, consisting primarily of broad low platforms, and many fewer terraces were placed on its descend­ing slopes. 
Although access into the core of the site is easi­est on the western face, passage up this slope is impeded by strings of terraces connected by high stone retaining walls. In some areas, it is possible to trace narrow roads and access ways that cut through rock walls and strings of terraces. Generally, these access ways were adjacent to small structures or plat­forms that probably controlled the movement of peo­ple entering or leaving the site (e.g., Hirth 1982:323). Many of the roads included a number of stairs or short stairways for navigating the steep routes. Especially near the bottom of the slope, several strings of 10 or more terraces share single unbroken retaining walls built up as high as 2--4 m. These long, high walls encircle the more accessible western face, abutting steep impassable bedrock outcrops at either end. Many of these walls are much more substantial than

is necessary to provide flat living spaces on the slope. Based on the site's location and constructed stone walls, constraints on access and defense were con­cerns forthe inhabitants of El Palmillo (Feinman and Nicholas l 998a, 1999, 2000a), yet the relative sig­nificance of a military threat and the specific nature of any defensive activities remain in question. 
Based on survey findings (Feinman and Nicholas I 998a), El Palmillo was initially settled during Monte Alban Late I (300-200 B.C.), when there was a sig­nificant but dispersed settlement of at least 3.9 ha at the higher reaches of the site, especially on the ridge top saddle and southern apex. In Monte Alban II (200 B.C.-A.D. 200), the site expanded to 8.4 ha, and settlement shifted primarily to the northern ridge top and the slopes immediately below it. The site was probably a small center or regional head town dur­ing Monte Alban Late I and II. 
Monte Alban Illa (the Early Classic, A.D. 200-500) was a time of intense settlement expan­sion in the eastern sector of the Valley of Oaxaca, when many terrace sites were densely settled. El Palmillo reached its greatest extent in Illa, extend­ing over 90 ha and including all habitable areas on both ridge tops and the descending slopes. Ceramic distributions indicate that most of the terraces at the site were occupied at that time, with an estimated population of around 5,000 people. 
Although El Palmillo retained a considerable pop­ulation in Monte Alban Illb-IV (ca. A.D. 500-900) and V (A.D. 900-1520), it was markedly smaller than during the Early Classic. The Illb-IV occupa­tion, extending over 33 ha, was focused primarily on the higher sections of the site. The Monte Alban V occupation was smaller still, around 16 ha, and even more dispersed. Although some settlement remained on the top of the hill, the Period V site was focused on the lower slopes. The lowest reaches on this west­ern face continued to be occupied at least until the outset of the Colonial period. 
Background to the Excavations 
and Field Methods 
We began our study at El Palmillo in 1999 after com­pleting excavations at Ejutla, a large multicomponent site in the Ejutla Valley at the southern margin of the Valley of Oaxaca. During three field seasons at this valley-floor site, we exposed a Classic period house and its immediate exterior space (Feinman and Nicholas 1993, 1995a; Feinman et al. 1991, 1993). 
The excavated complex included a structure with a small subfloor tomb in which at least four individu­als were interred (Middleton et al. 1998; see Winter 197 4, 1995 for other Classic period domestic tombs in Oaxaca), a probable cooking area (including a firepit) located just outside the house, and adjacent middens. 
The occupants of this Ejutla house were involved in a range of craft activities, producing marine-shell ornaments (Feinman and Nicholas 1993, 1995a, 2000b; Feinman et al. 1991, 1993), ceramics (par­ticularly figurines, coma/es, and sahumadores) (Balkansky et al. 1997; Feinman and Balkansky 1997), and a range of lapidary goods (making heav­iest use of onyx and greenstone) (Feinman and Nicholas 1993, 1995a; Middleton 1998). Based on the presence of chert reduction debris, it appears that the ancient Ejutlefios also made the chert microdrills that they used to perforate the shell ornaments. 
Several complementary lines of evidence helped tie this range of craft activities directly to the exca­vated house. Microartifactual (heavy fraction) analy­ses of the earthen structure floor yielded microscopic flecks of shell, chert flakes, and tiny pieces of green­stone, all too small to be brushed away during sweep­ing (Feinman et al. 1993; Middleton 1998). In addition, chemical analyses of soil samples taken systematically from the house floor revealed traces of repeated firings (possibly from a series of adja­cent pit kilns) in addition to probable signatures from shell working (Balkansky et al. 1997; Middleton 1998; Middleton and Price 1996). In concert, these fine-grained analyses along with the macroartifac­tual debris place this range of craft activities in a domestic setting. 
Based on the very high ratio of shell debris to fin­ished shell ornaments in the E jutla excavations (Fein­man and Nicholas 2000b), it appears that much of the production was for exchange. The most abundant shell species in the debris at Ejutla also were the most common taxa used for finished shell ornaments at Monte Alban. Stylistically, many of the ornament varieties at Monte Alban and Ejutla were similar, at least leaving open the possibility that goods made in Ejutla were transported some distance away. Mold­made Classic period figurines made in Ejutla also were produced for exchange. Ceramic figurines col­lected from several sites within 10 km of the Ejutla site during the regional survey of the Ejutla Valley (Feinman and Nicholas 1990) are nearly identical to

figurine forms found during excavations at the site. Through petrographic analysis, two of the surface­collected figurines have been shown to be almost identical compositionally to similar figurines recov­ered at the Ejutla site (Carpenter and Feinman 1999). 
In sum, the occupants of the excavated Classic period house carried out a variety of craft activities (Feinman and Nicholas 2000b; see also Shimada 1998). Significantly, the production of shell items and a range of pottery forms was enacted at the domes­tic scale (Costin 1991), but in high volumes greater than needed by the residents of a single house and so likely for exchange. Although based on a limited sample, the evidence of specialized household-cen­tered craft production in Ejutla provides context for understanding our research program and findings at El Palmillo and for unraveling the nature of the Clas­sic period economy in the Valley of Oaxaca. Unfor­tunately, the location of the Ejutla site beneath a modem town limited the opportunity for additional excavation there and hence the number of prehis­panic houses that could be located and unearthed. 
To increase the sample of excavated Classic period houses in the Valley of Oaxaca, we turned to terrace sites, and specifically El Palmillo. As noted above, the findings from both the regional and inten­sive surveys at El Palmillo yielded surface indica­tions of both residential architecture and craft production debris. But in contrast to valley-floor Ejutla, the prospect of exposing a larger sample of Classic period residences was more promising; we could open up terrace after terrace, with no modem structures obstructing our investigations. 
Because of our interest in household and domes­tic economy, we began excavations at El Palmillo on several terraces located near the bottom of the hill, far from the site's civic-ceremonial core on the ridge top. We excavated three adjacent terraces in 1999 (Terraces 1147, 1148, and 1162) and a fourth adjoin­ing terrace (1163) in 2000, exposing approximately 500 m2 in the two field seasons (Figure 4). These excavations revealed two residential complexes that had been rebuilt a number of times during the occu­pation of the terraces. In association with these com­plexes were 26 human burials, 15 offerings, and 9 fire installations (including hearths, ash pits, and two

large ovens that appear to have been used to roast maguey) (Feinman and Nicholas 2001, 2002; Fein­man et al. 2000, 2001b). 
In 2001, on a fifth terrace (Terrace 925) 100 m upslope, we exposed an additional 160 m2 (Feinman et al. 2001a). On this upper terrace we identified another residential complex that also had been rebuilt several times, as well as 14 burials including a small subfloor tomb, 3 offerings, and several hearths. The location of this terrace upslope and apart from the previous set of terraces gave us the opportunity to examine potential differences in subsistence patterns and domestic/economic activities in distinct sectors of the site. Although still situated well below the top of the hill, Terrace 925's position higher on the slope also allowed us to explore potential differences in social status between the residents of the two sets of terraces. 
Our excavation strategy was to open large con­temporaneous surfaces, or "living floors." We began with a small trench on each terrace to expose the stratigraphy and to isolate contiguous, contempora­neous areas or surfaces across each terrace. We fol­lowed natural stratigraphic levels whenever possible. To facilitate recording, mapping, and the collection of artifacts, these broad horizontal exposures were excavated in a series of contiguous 2-x-2-m units gridded across the terrace surface. All features and discontinuous or distinct contexts were excavated separately. 
All deposits were screened with either a  inch or /.\ inch mesh (depending on context and the nature of the excavated materials) to recover by-products and residues of manufacturing and other activities. Soil samples for flotation and for chemical analysis of residues were taken from all floor deposits and from other selected contexts (e.g., Metcalfe and Heath 1990; Widmer 1991 ). The flotation samples were processed with an Ankara-style flotation machine (Pearsall 1989). Light fractions were collected to recover plant remains, and the heavy fraction was sorted into 1-2 mm and larger than 2 mm sizes and bagged separately for microdebitage analysis. For the chemical analy­ses, a spatially distributed set of small soil samples was taken when room floors were defined to facilitate the definition of different activity loci within rooms (e.g., Manzanilla and Barba 1990; Middleton 1998; Middleton and Price 1996). Analyses of these sam­ples and materials are ongoing. Charcoal samples were taken as deemed appropriate. 
As part of the 2001 field season, we also con­ducted a botanical census of El Palmillo (Middleton et al. 2001 ). Many of the plant species identified on site are (or were until recently) considered econom­ically useful by the current inhabitants of the area. Identified plants include subsistence resources and medicinal plants, as well as sources for other com­modities such as fiber. To evaluate whether the plant community on site is a relict of prehispanic garden­ing (e.g., Folan et al. 1979; Martinez y Ojeda 1996), we compared the dominant plant species at El Palmillo with the results of a botanical census com­pleted on a "control site," a nearby hill that was sim­ilar in elevation, slope, and orientation. 
Principal Findings 
Terrace Site Function 
After visiting Monte Alban for the first time, William Henry Holmes (1897:211-212) described the con­struction of hilltop terrace sites as a process of "destroying traces of natural contour and making the mountains actual works of art." This description aptly describes El Palmillo, where rows upon rows of ter­races cover entire slopes. The initial construction of the terraces was a substantial undertaking involving the building of massive stone walls and filling the upslope space behind them with sediment, a tech­nique referred to as "pure fill" as opposed to "cut and fill" (Hard et al. 1999). This process results in taller terrace cross-sections and higher retaining walls (Kowalewski et al. 2001 ). Most of the terraces at El Palmino appear to have been built directly on bedrock, situated to take advantage of natural rises in the rock foundation of the hill. In some instances up to 1 m of sediment was brought in to level the often undulating and steeply sloping bedrock. 
In excavating the flat spaces behind the retaining walls of the five terraces, we found that architectural features (rooms, patios) occupied virtually the entire terrace surface. Little, if any, space was left open for gardens or other cultivation except along the rock retaining walls of the terraces themselves. The basic architectural layout was a residential complex com­posed of three or four structures or rooms surround­ing three sides of a small central patio (Figure 5), similar to the plan of several Classic period domes­tic complexes excavated at Monte Alban (Winter 197 4). The three intact multiroom complexes that we exposed included a long, narrow rectangular struc-

The interment of individuals in household con­texts was a common practice in prehispanic Mesoamerica (Feinman and Nicholas 2000b; McAnany 1995; Middleton et al. 1998; Winter 1974). At El Palmillo we recovered 40 burials (with the remains of at least 49 individuals) on the five exca­vated terraces. Most of the individuals (both males and females were represented) were interred in the patios or under room floors, although children often were buried in the terrace walls, including two who were interred in large jars that were placed in retain­ing walls on the lower set of terraces. 
As Winter (1974) reported for several household clusters at Monte Alban, the northern structure of the complexes often had a mortuary function. This pat­tern was clearest on the lower set of terraces, where more than half of the adult burials (10 of 16) were interred in or adjacent to a northern structure. The northern structure on Terrace 114 7 (Feature 15) was a low stone construction where four adults had been buried, in separate stone-lined cists that were arranged roughly in the shape of a roman numeral II (see F.15 in Figure 5). Another adult was interred in an earlier level of this structure. Three adults also were interred in two more formal stone-lined cists in the northern structure of Terrace 1163 while two others were buried at its southern edge. 
Although a mortuary function for the northern structure on the upper terrace (Terrace 925) is less clear (there were no formal burial cists in the struc­ture), several children were buried in the western part of the structure late in its occupation. We also recovered evidence that an individual had been buried in the structure and later was removed (while the res­idential complex was still in use) to be reburied else­where. 
The most formal burial feature on all the exca­vated terraces was a small subfloor tomb placed beneath the floor of the eastern structure of the upper terrace (Figure 6). This tomb was constructed dur­ing the final of three building/rebuilding episodes for this structure. The burial contents of the tomb included one adult male (still largely articulated) along with two other individuals (represented only by disarticulated bones). The entombed male had a trephined skull, the opening of which had partially healed and may not have been the cause of death. 
The burials, the prevalence of domestic debris, and the variety of fire installations (especially small hearths and ash pits) on the excavated terraces indi­cate that the terraces were residential. A small pit kiln on one of the lower terraces (Terrace 1162) was employed to fire ceramics; several ash pits on the other lower terraces also may have been used at one time or another to fire small quantities of pottery. On the lower terraces, we also uncovered two large circular ovens that were utilized to roast maguey (Figure 7). Both of these fire installations were filled with dark black ash and charcoal, and the stones in them were blackened and fire cracked (a similar round stone feature with dark sediment was noted on the surface farther downslope at the site). These circular features closely resemble ovens used today in Santiago Matatlan for cooking maguey hearts (see also Flannery and Marcus 1983). The ancient features were wider than fire installations associated with the manufacture of pottery at El Palmillo or elsewhere in Oaxaca (Balkansky et al. 1997; Win­ter and Payne 1976), and the nature of the black soot, ash, and artifactual deposits was entirely different. It also would have been exceedingly difficult to con­trol the temperature in these broad features, and so it is unlikely that they were associated with ceramic firing. 
Based on the broad horizontal excavation of five terraces, at least three residential units were defined. The bulk of the excavated flat terrace space was occu­pied by domestic architecture and activity areas asso­ciated with those residential units. The burial population, composed of young and old, and an almost balanced ratio of identifiable males to females, would seem to conform with the expecta­tions for household composition, much like that found for the terraces at Monte Alban (Winter 197 4 ). 
Terrace Construction, Organization, and Occupational Duration 
After initial construction, the terraces and the resi­dential structures on them were periodically rebuilt and renovated. Some of these rebuilding episodes involved considerable movement of earth and stone to create new and larger level surfaces. The residen­tial complexes often were rebuilt in the same basic configuration but were repositioned just a small way up the slope (Figure 8). At junctures between major episodes of reconstruction, structure floors often were replastered. 
Based on ceramic associations, the excavated ter­races at El Palmillo were first constructed at the end of Monte Alban II or early in Monte Alban IIIa (ca.

150-250). These early terraces were narrower than they were to become later (following renova­tion and rebuilding). The earliest residential archi­tecture on the terraces consisted of single-room structures, with stone foundations and cobble fill, placed at the center of the terraces near the front retaining walls. 

During early-to-middle Monte Alban Illa (ca. 


A.D. 
400), the five excavated terraces underwent major episodes of rebuilding. Front terrace walls were raised, and tremendous amounts of fill were brought in to bring the front surfaces of the terraces closer to the level of exposed bedrock higher up slope, doubling the area of flattened space. The basic layout of the residential complexes-three or four 


rooms on three sides of a small patio--began to take shape at that time (Figure 9). The residential com­plexes were constructed toward the back of the ter­races, increasing the size of the patios and open areas at the front of the terraces. 
This rebuilding activity, coinciding with the growth of the site in Monte Alban illa, involved coor­dination between the inhabitants of adjacent terraces. For example, the front walls of two of the lower ter­races (Terraces 1162 and 1163) were rebuilt upslope from their prior locations. Collectively, these new retaining walls were part of a continuous massive wall that encircled the entire western face of the hill. Located near the base of the main part of the hill, this wall had defensive and traffic-control functions.

Figure 7. Excavating the maguey oven at El Palmillo. 
Access through the wall was limited to a few entrances. One such small access way passes between Terraces 1162 and 1163, continuing up the slope behind Terrace 1163 and beyond. As a conse­quence, the rebuilding of Terraces 1162 and 1163 appears to have affected the reconstruction of the ter­races immediately behind them, including 1147 and 1 148. Terrace 925 also was part of a string of seven terraces that shared a massive retaining wall. 
During middle-to-late Illa, another major build­ing episode occurred on all the terraces we excavated (Figure 10). Front terrace walls were raised higher still and more fill was brought in. Although the basic form of the residential complexes remained the same, all of the complexes underwent relatively minor changes in the arrangement and size of some rooms. Most of the complexes were shifted to the east, higher upslope. 
During late Illa or early Illb-IV (ca. A.D. 500--700), the terraces underwent their final renova­tions. There were few changes to the layouts of the residential complexes on the lower terraces, although most structures were repaired and replastered at least once. The most significant addition to the lower ter­races was a stone-lined oven that was placed at the southern edge of Terrace 1163, in an area bounded by walls that may have directed the smoke away from the residences (see Figure 5).

Figure 9. Plan of an earlier occupation surface on the lower excavated terraces. 
The residential complex on the upper terrace underwent more significant rebuilding as the three­room complex was replaced by a more formal L­shaped structure surrounding the north and east sides of a sunken patio with a plastered banquette (Figure 11 ). The patio was expanded to the south to cover part of the earlier southern structure (see Figures 6 and 10). Both structures and the patio were plas­tered. A small subftoor tomb that was entered through the patio was placed beneath the eastern structure. The house floor and the patio had been replastered several times, likely after each opening of the tomb.

I)! 

The residential occupation of the upper terrace continued in Monte Alban Illb-IV, at a time when the lower terraces were in the process of being aban­doned. During the final use of the lower terraces, two small firing features were placed on top of aban­doned residential structures. The stone-lined oven on Terrace 1163 was covered by a much larger, shallow one that crossed the former boundary between the two terraces (1162 and 1163). The final use of the lower terraces likely was for roasting maguey, a key xerophytic (drought-toletant) plant on site. This last use of the lower excavated terraces probably coin­cided with a partial abandonment of the site and set­tlement contraction toward the crest of the hill that was indicated by findings from the earlier intensive survey. 
Based on our excavations, we not only see El Palmillo as largely residential in function, but it appears that the domestic use of its terraces endured for centuries. The terraces were ever changing, with refurbishments and enlargements made during the lifespan of each terrace. The residential character of the settlement does not in any sense diminish El Palmillo's defensibility. It does, however, provide support for the view that many Valley of Oaxaca ter­raced settlements were principally towns or sizable residential communities having significant popula­tions as opposed to redoubts, forts, short-term out-

posts, or sets of isolated agricultural features. Like most human settlements, El Palmillo underwent episodes of growth and decline, and these cycles affected the use histories of specific terraces. Based on the excavation and prior survey, we suspect that settlement descended down the hill during times of growth/expansion and then clustered nearer the top when the site's population contracted. 
Economy and Subsistence 
If El Palmillo was indeed a densely inhabited town for centuries, then we need to address questions concerning the economic foundation and subsis­tence of the community. Rainfall today in the east­ern end of the valley's dry Tlacolula arm is barely adequate to grow maize even in a wet year. The nearest patches of flat, well-watered bottomland lie several kilometers from the site (Kirkby 1973; Nicholas 1989). Although water is available in sev­eral springs at the base of the hill, and in at least one small spring on site, none of these water sources are directly adjacent to extensive patches of level/farmable terrain. Consequently, while maize may have been planted in small fields on and near the site, it is unlikely that it could have largely sus­tained this Classic period settlement on a perma­nent basis (Nicholas 1989). 
The importance of craft manufacture at terraced settlements, especially in drier sections of the val­ley, long has been suspected (Feinman and Nicholas 2000a; Finsten 1995; Kowalewski et al. 1989). The excavations at El Palmillo help flesh out the variety and importance of craft production at this site; as we found at Ejutla, these production activities were car­ried out in and near houses (at the domestic scale). 
The production of chipped stone tools from local chert was a major livelihood at El Palmillo. Overall, the lithic assemblage is dominated by chert (93 per­cent of the entire stone assemblage). The chipped stone tools manufactured at El Palmillo include abraders, generalized bifaces and unifaces, perfora­tors, projectile points, scraper planes (or raspadores, see Hester and Heizer 1972; Robles 1994 ), and other generalized scrapers. These tools and other finished chert artifacts account for less than 2 percent of the total chert assemblage (over 20,000 pieces of chert have been recovered from excavated deposits). The very low proportion of tools compared to flakes and debris (and the ubiquity of chert, mostly debris) would seem to indicate that chert reduction was an

important activity on the studied terraces. Such reduction likely was associated with stone-tool man­ufacture (and possibly stone-core preparation) for exchange, at least to other parts of El Palmillo if not to other sites in the region. 
The distribution of stone tools and debris was not uniform across the excavated terraces, indicating at least some minor variation in activities among resi­dents of the various terraces. The highest quantity of chert debris was found on one of the lower terraces (Terrace 1162), in areas that appear to have been out­door work areas (immediately adjacent to rooms). Relative to the lower terraces, there were more for­mal tools on the upper terrace and less chert pro­duction debris and fewer informal tools (a potential side-product of production debris), raising the like­lihood that stone tool reduction was a less-common activity on the upper terrace and that its residents engaged in fewer activities involving informal tools. More in-depth analysis of the production debitage (and microdebitage) is required to refine our under­standing of lithic reduction and tool use in the two terrace areas. It is apparent, however, that the inhab­itants of Terrace 925 had greater access to tools and to finer-made tools that required more labor to pro­duce. 
The production of maguey fiber (ixtle) and tex­tiles also was a significant activity at El Palmillo. An abundant class of chert scraper at the site-scraper planes ( raspadores)-long have been associated with maguey and the extraction of fiber from the plant's pulpy leaves (Hester and Heizer 1972; Robles 1994 ). Large ceramic spindle whorls, in the size range typ­ically used to spin maguey fibers (Parsons and Par­sons 1990; Parsons 1972), also are fairly common, especially on the lower terraces (Figure 12). Many of the bone tools recovered during the excavations, including battens, needles, perforators, and bone spindle whorls, also likely were associated with sewing and weaving. 
Although the overall composition of the faunal assemblages on the two sets of terraces was relatively similar, bone tools were more abundant on Terrace 
925. The types of formal stone tools also varied between the two sets of terraces. Terrace 925 pos­sessed a greater proportion of soft stone abraders with

striated surfaces (believed to have been used in maguey fiber production) and chert raspadores and perforators than the lower terraces. The lower ter­races, however, included a larger number of spindle whorls, most of which were used for coarse maguey fiber. In contrast, six spindle whorls, all small, were found on the upper terrace. These smaller whorls may have been used to spin fine maguey thread (or pos­sibly cotton, either a wild perennial variety [Kandt 1972:61-62], which still is present on site, or imported domestic cotton). 
In contrast to chert tool and fiber/cloth produc­tion, only limited evidence for ceramic production was recovered. The manufactured ceramics were largely utilitarian wares for local consumption. Although at least a few kiln wasters were present on all the excavated terraces, the best evidence for ceramic production was a small pit kiln and several ash pits on the lower terraces that appear to have been used at least sporadically to fire pottery. These fea­tures are dispersed over most of the occupation lay­ers on the lower terraces, so the intensity of pottery manufacture does not seem to have been high on any of the El Palmillo terraces at any specific time. 
At El Palmillo, total chert weight, the abundance of bone implements, and the prevalence of large (coarse maguey fiber) spindle whorls far exceed the volume and percentage of these items at Ejutla. In contrast, marine shell, ceramic figurines, and onyx debris are far more prevalent in the excavated sam­ples from Ejutla compared to El Palmillo excavation contexts. These differences appear to evidence dis­tinct economic specializations at the two settlements. 
At present, however, we still know little about how these finished craft goods circulated both within and between communities. Here it is worth considering the range of goods that El Palmillo's residents received (likely through exchange) from outside the immediate vicinity. Finished marine shell ornaments and obsidian blades clearly were imported; there is no evidence from survey or excavation to suggest they were produced in any quantity at El Palmillo. Tools made from nonlocal chert and a limited num­ber of exotic ceramic artifacts also are present in the collections. 
It seems plausible, perhaps even likely, that maize was periodically imported by El Palmillo households in exchange for chert artifacts and/or craft products derived from drought-resistant plants such as maguey. Nevertheless, based on several lines of evi­dence we suspect that xerophytic plants composed a larger part of the El Palmillo diet than we envisioned at the start of this study. Even on casual observation, the floral community at El Palmillo differs from what one sees on the neighboring hills and in the remain­der of the terrain of Santiago Matatlan. Many of the plant species on site are recognized as sources of food, medicine, or fiber. 

The botanical survey of El Palmillo and the nearby control hill revealed a set of plant species that were identified at both locations (Middleton et al. 2001). Most of these species, which also are present throughout the immediate area, form the backbone of the local natural floral community (see Martinez y Ojeda 1996). We also documented several eco­nomically useful species that are present only at El Palmillo or are considerably more common at El Palmillo than in the surrounding environs. In con­trast, there are no economically significant species present on the control hill that were not also observed at El Palmillo. 
One of the notable species present in much greater abundance at El Palmillo is palmillo (Yucca pericu­losa), a source of food, fiber, and flowers. Yet even more significant is the distribution of different maguey species (Figure 13). Of eight species of maguey reported in the Tlacolula arm of the valley (Gentry 1982; Sanchez Lopez 1989:34), all occur today at El Palmillo while only two are present on the nearby con­trol hill (Middleton et al. 2001) (Table 1). All are sources of food, liquid, or fiber (Gentry 1982; Sanchez Lopez 1989). In addition, various cacti, succulents, bushes, and trees of economic importance (fruits, nuts, fiber, and medicinal herbs) are far more com­mon on the site than elsewhere in the immediate region. Based on the marked abundance of these flo­ral resources on the site and not elsewhere, it appears that El Palmillo's plant community is a relict of the prehispanic habitation of the hill and that these eco­nomic species were present on site when the hill was inhabited. 
Although most of the flattened space on the ter­races was occupied by domestic architecture, there still were areas along the walls and edges of terraces where plants could have been fostered and culti­vated. Although rocky, some of the terrace walls are broad and gently sloping; these walls currently sup­port dense vegetation, particularly in the wet season. Many xerophytic plants, especially cacti and maguey, probably were planted on the sloping retaining walls

of the residential terraces, providing not only some privacy (Parsons 1936) but also reinforcing the walls and preventing erosion (Ortiz de Montellano 1990; Patrick 1985; Wilken 1987:105). These plants also would have thrived on unterraced slopes at El Palmillo. 
The role of these economically valuable drought­tolerant plants, especially maguey, was likely mul­tifaceted, based on this sixteenth-century account: 
As a whole it [maguey] can be used as fuel or to fence fields. Its shoots can be used as wood and its leaves as roofing materials, as plates or plat­ters, to make paper, to make cord with which they make shoes, cloth and all kinds of clothes ... 
From the sap ... they make wines, honey, vine­
gar and sugar .... From the root, they also make 
very strong ropes which are useful for many things. The thicker part of the leaves as well as the trunk, cooked underground ... are good to eat and taste like cidra (a citruslike fruit) with sugar. ... This plant, by itself, could easily furnish all that is needed for a simple, frugal life since it is not harmed by storms, the rigors of the weather, nor does it wither in drought. There is nothing which gives a higher return [Hernandez 1959, vol. 1, pp. 348-349 (1577)]. 
Maguey can be a highly productive crop, pro-
vi ding not only key economic resources such as fiber that can be processed into rope and cloth for local consumption and exchange, but also an important component of the diet, particularly when its sap or aguamiel is utilized along with roasted hearts and leaves (Evans I 990; Parsons 200 1 ; Parsons and Par­sons 1990). The availability of maguey, along with various cacti and other gathered wild plants, could have helped offset maize and other food shortfalls in dry years. Although El Palmillo 's residents may have grown limited amounts of corn, they probably obtained more through trade, some of which may not have come from very far away. Hunting and animal domestication provided additional food resources. Dog, deer, jackrabbit, rabbit, and turkey were the most common species on the excavated terraces based on MNI calculations (Middleton et al. 2002). At present, we do not suspect that any one class of food resource was key, but that a suite of resources, including maguey and other xerophytic plants, likely had critical roles in both subsistence and economic production for exchange. The importance of maguey as food and economic resource is already well doc­umented for central Mexico, particularly in Aztec times (Brumfiel 1991 ; Evans 1990; Gon9alves de

Here we extend the empirical record for the significance of these drought-resistant plants to prehispanic Oaxaca during the earlier Classic period. 
Patterns qf"Access, Consumption, and 
Organization at El Palmillo 
To this point, we have touched briefly on the intra­community organization of Classic period El Palmillo. Some of the differences in craft activities between terraces have been noted, with the inference that intra-and intersettlement mechanisms of eco­nomic circulation were important. Coordination between adjacent terrace residents during episodes of renovation and remodeling also was surmised. General similarities in building layout between ter­races, and from one occupation to the next on some terraces, was observed, indicating that there does not appear to be a great tendency for households to dif­ferentiate themselves through architecture. Each of these observations would seem to signal a high degree of interdependence among domestic units at El Palmillo, and perhaps with households at other sites. 
An exception to this relative architectural homo­geneity at El Palmillo is a more significant shift in residential plan associated with the last occupational surface of Terrace 925. A slightly more elaborate architectural layout that included a sunken patio, the surrounding banquette, and the subfloor tomb was built. Nevertheless, until we expand our sample of excavated terraces, it is difficult to assign this archi­tectural change to the relative role and significance of minor status distinctions between terrace resi­dents, small but perhaps important chronological dis­tinctions, andlor locational variation across the site. 

Nevertheless, slight differences in status between the two groups of terraces (the lower cluster of ter­races compared to Terrace 925) have been discerned. We recovered more mortuary offerings per capita on the upper terrace, and this difference was not simply reflected by the tomb and its contents. All the adults on Terrace 925 were interred with at least one ceramic vessel (and a few with jade beads) as were the major­ity of children on that terrace. This contrasts with the lower terraces where both adults and children were often buried with few or no accompanying mortu­ary offerings, and no greenstone or jade beads accom­panied any burial. 
In fact, during the 1999 and 2000 excavations on the lower terraces, no stone beads were found in any context. In contrast, a chert bead and four jade beads (all associated with burials or burial pits) were exca­vated on the upper terrace in 2001, yet the overall burial population was smaller. Although very little marine shell is present at the site, a higher propor­tion of the shell from Terrace 925 (compared to the lower terraces) was worked into ornaments.

Obsidian, another nonlocal exotic material, also 
was present in greater quantities on Terrace 925 than 
on the lower terraces. Roughly twice as many obsid­
ian blades were recovered on Terrace 925 as were 
found on any of the lower terraces. Obsidian also 
accounted for a larger percentage of the formal tool 
assemblage on the upper terrace. Although the fre­
quency of obsidian could indicate economic activ­
ity differences between terraces, it more directly 
reflects the ability of Terrace 925 inhabitants to 
acquire greater amounts of this exotic good. 
The quality of the chert recovered on the differ­ent terraces illustrates a similar pattern. Although raw chert is widely available across the site, most of this local material is not of very high quality. Better-qual­ity material, which produces sharper, finer blades, is less commonly available. In comparison to the lower terraces, a higher proportion of the chert on Terrace 925 was from finer-grade and/or nonlocal sources. 
The residents of both sets of terraces spun fiber into thread. Yet the inhabitants of the upper terrace employed smaller spindle whorls, either for making finer maguey thread or possibly for spinning cotton (see Figure 12). Either of these lighter, finer threads were higher status items than the coarse maguey thread (Berdan 1987:244-245) spun with the larger spindle whorls that were found on the lower terraces. 
Based on all of these differences, the inhabitants of Terrace 925 had slightly better access to exotic and higher-status items than did the residents of the lower terraces. These differences likely reflect some minor status distinctions, which could account for the more elaborate architectural plan associated with the final building stage of the upper terrace. Such differences were more of degree (minimal) than kind. And they do not seem to have translated into marked disparities in meat consumption, which appears comparable on the two groups of terraces. Of course, our perspective remains very much bottom-up, in the sense that even the upper terrace (925) is still well below the apex of the hill (and the settlement's largest civic-ceremonial architecture). Yet at the same time, the scale of the site's public architecture is not all that monumental com­pared to the size of the site and the amount of effort that was invested in domestic construction. So whether people who lived near the top of El Palmillo were all that much better off when it came to exotic and labor­intensive goods or whether their diets had more pro­tein, calories, or variety than people living on lower terraces remain prime questions for future study. 
Discussion and Conclusions 
The three field seasons at El Palmillo have gener­ated new empirical data on Classic period houses and terraces at hilltop sites in the Valley of Oaxaca. These new findings have helped resolve a number of long-standing issues and debates, while opening up new questions for future study. The long-term res­idential nature of El Palmillo now seems clear. Because houses and courses of structure foundations have been recorded on terraces at the great major­ity (if not all) terrace sites in Oaxaca, most of these sites would seem to have been towns rather than tem­porary outposts, fortifications, or strictly agrarian features. At the same time, El Palmillo (and many other terrace sites in Oaxaca) was compact and defensible, with numerous high stone retaining walls. The defensibility of these hilltop sites was an important element in their character, and the reasons behind these military considerations are something that needs to be researched further. Were they responses to rivals or threats of force against popu­lations outside of the valley? 
Based on surface findings, we also have long been aware that the size and configuration of individual terraced settlements changed over time. Now, how­ever, we can more clearly document how these shifts were effected through the actions and building deci­sions of terrace dwellers. El Palmillo's residents did not simply follow or tinker with the contour of the natural hill when building terraces. The construction of terrace sites (even in entirely domestic areas) was a significant enterprise that purposely shaped and cre­ated human landforms. Terrace sites were at once holistic architectural entities (giant stepped or tiered features that modified and reshaped large natural hills) and modular settlements composed of a series of roughly similar units (the terraces themselves). 
Residential terrace life involved regular episodes of wall construction, terrace repair, and spatial mod­ification. Over time, the use of space on terraces, and even the specific dimensions of terraces, changed. On the lower excavated terraces, what began as two distinct adjacent terraces became one architec­tural/domestic unit with a shared patio. When the front retaining walls of the excavated terraces were massively rebuilt, it generally occurred in a way that would have required the cooperation of the occupants of adjacent terraces. Although we tend to view these sites as well-designed architectural entities that kept

a basic site plan for years, the actual record of each terrace was more dynamic. Nevertheless, at the same time, a basic architectural layout for residential com­pounds was apparently followed at the site for cen­turies; this basic domestic plan in tum shares certain key features with contemporaneous residences at Monte Alban. 
At El Palmillo, artificially leveled terraces were used continuously by domestic units for centuries. At the same time, these domestic units were densely packed along the western face of the hill, with resi­dential complexes often abutting one another. Ear­lier survey-produced estimates that proposed that roughly 4,000--6,000 people may have resided at El Palmillo during the height of Early-Middle Classic occupation now appear reasonable, even conserva­tive. Yet these estimates raise questions concerning the sustenance and economic underpinnings of the site's inhabitants. The important subsistence role of maguey and other xerophytic plants at El Palmillo in conjunction with their significance as economic resources for production and exchange is becoming clear. Their exploitation for fiber along with local chert working were key economic specializations at El Palmillo. As at Ejutla, specialized production of these goods was carried out at the household level (Feinman 1999). House-based specialized produc­tion requires mechanisms of integration and exchange, and these still must be elucidated at intra­and intersite scales. Unraveling these mechanisms of circulation provide a necessary next step for under­standing the prehispanic economies of ancient Mesoamerica. 
Site layout and patterns of rebuilding illustrate that a high level of cooperation must have existed between the dwellers of adjacent and neighboring ter­races at El Palmillo. It also appears that status dis­tinctions, although rather minimal overall, had a spatial manifestation. Near neighbors were more similar in access and status than were people who lived farther apart. The inhabitants of Terrace 925 acquired a few more imported goods than the dwellers on the four terraces below. Our findings at El Palmillo offer tentative support for Blanton's (1978) hypothesis for the presence of some kind of barrio or ward organization at Oaxaca terrace sites, although clearly additional terrace excavations are needed to fully assess and clarify the nature of these social arrangements. 
Our investigations at El Palmillo are providing a baseline for building a published corpus of material regarding Classic period houses for the Valley of Oaxaca (outside of Monte Alban). In the future, we hope to move our excavations further upslope (pre­sumably toward even higher-status terrace dwellers situated closer to the public core at the hill's sum­mit) to understand a fuller range of domestic differ­ences and similarities at this ridge top settlement. By supplementing existing Classic period Valley of Oax­aca investigations at the community and regional levels, we aim to contribute to an improved under­standing of prehispanic households, both in Oaxaca and beyond, and to further sharpen our multiscalar perspective on the economic and political networks in which these domestic units participated (Feinman 1997; Sanders 1993; Smith 1997).

"McKillop has completed a re­markable task in bringing out significant new data concerning ancient Maya salt making. The implications of environmental exploitation, technological development, and economic possibilities provide the op­portunity to revisit these issues on more solid ground." -Fred Valdez Jr., 
University of Texas, Austin 
In Salt: White Gold of the Ancient Maya, Heather McKillop 
reports the discovery, excavation, and interpretation of Late Classic Maya salt works on the coast of Belize, transforming our knowledge of the Maya salt trade and craft specialization while providing new insights on sea­level rise in the Late Holocene as well. 
Salt, basic to human existence, was scarce in the tropical rainforests of Belize and Guatemala, where the Classic Maya civilization thrived between AD. 300 and
900. The prevailing interpretation has been that salt was imported from the north coast of the Yucatan. However, the underwater discovery and 
excavation of salt works in Punta 
Ycacos Lagoon demonstrate 
that the Maya produced salt by 
boiling brine in pots over fires 
at specialized workshops on 
the Belizean coast. The Punta 
Y ca cos salt works are clear 
evidence that craft specializa­
tion took place in a non-domes­
tic setting and that production oc­

curred away from the economic and po­litical power of the urban Maya rulers, thus providing new clues to the Maya economy and sea trade.
