4 of 6 such heads have been excavated to date. In addition, he assumes that there is a long construction history at the site when excavations have shown that most of the site was built during one major construc­tion phase. 
To Burger's credit, he portrays the Initial period as a much more important time period in Peruvian pre­history than most previous scholars. He correctly as­signs most of the major coastal monumental sites (Gar­agay, La Florida, Carda!, Sechin Alto, Pampa de las Llamas-Moxeke, Punkuri, and Huaca de los Reyes) to the Initial period and acknowledges their immense size and careful planning. As recently as a few years ago, many scholars would still have dated these monuments to the Early Horizon and associated them with the Chavin phenomenon. 
In our opinion, however, he has not gone far enough in portraying the cultural dynamism of the Initial pe­riod. While acknowledging that Initial-period monu­ments are some of the largest ever built in Peru, Burger insists that such monuments, no matter how large, could have been built by relatively small groups of people over long periods of time using a generalized religious ideology and collective will as guiding forces. Clearly, he has used his personal excavation data from Carda! and Mina Perdida on the central coast as the basis for a comprehensive reconstruction of ancient coastal so­cieties. These sites contain multiple, relatively small, construction phases that coincide with such a model. Nevertheless, he is in error in trying to apply such a model to all monumental construction along the coast. 
For example, at Pampa de las Llamas-Moxeke, Hu­aca A contains two construction phases, an earlier one containing ca. 85,000 m3 of construction fill and a later one of about 38,000 m3. At Caballo Muerto, Huaca Cortada contains an estimated 192,000 m3 of fill, all belonging to a single construction phase. In both cases, coordinated direction of substantial amounts of cor­porate labor over a relatively short time period was necessary. It is evident that one single model for Initial­period societies will not account for the variation in the archaeological record. 
For the Initial period, Burger again uses the relative 
lack of exotic grave goods to argue for a lack of social 
class distinctions during that time period. It should be 
noted that where exotic items do appear in burials at 
sites such as La Galgada, Burger goes to great lengths 
to downplay their potential importance. He is not the 
first archaeologist to rely heavily on burial-pattern ev­
idence to reconstruct ancient social organization, but 
he does so almost to the exclusion of other evidence. 
Clearly, more work needs to be carried out at Initial­
period sites, especially in domestic contexts, to clarify 
the situation. Based on the available data, however, 
we would argue that the size and careful planning of 
Initial-period monumental architecture necessarily re­
flects a certain degree of social differentiation and cen­
tralized control. 
Chapters five and six focus on Chavin de Huantar, 
the type site for the Chavin culture. The descriptions 
and illustrations are excellent. Many of the interpre­
tations concerning the architectural layout and asso­
ciated sculpture are interesting and provocative, par­
ticularly the hypothesis that the numerous and varied tenoned heads at the site represent various stages in shamanistic transformations into jaguars, eagles, or monkeys. Burger sees both coastal and montane forest influences in the architecture, ceramics, and iconog­raphy of the site and postulates that the site served as an important trade and religious center serving the highlands, coast, and montane forest. 
Much information in these chapters is presented con­fidently-as if there were no doubt about interpreta­tions of the available evidence. Such is not the case. Many theories concerning Chavin de Huantar and the society that built it rest on very shaky evidence. For example, Burger presents the traditional Old Temple-­New Temple architectural sequence and sculptural se­riation postulated by John Rowe in the 1960s. Close examination of the supporting evidence for both the architectural sequence and the sculptural seriation, however, shows that neither is solidly grounded. Ad­ditionally, Burger sees class stratification at Chavin de Huantar based on differential distribution of Spondy/us shell and stone artifacts as well as fish, shellfish, and. llama-bone remains. Again, this evidence is not es­
pecially convincing. 
Chapter seven discusses the florescence and collapse ofChavin civilization. Here, Burger runs into difficulty. His idea that Chavin was a regional cult somewhat akin to examples ethnographically documented in Af­rica is intriguing, but it is also deceptive because this view includes the idea that the symbols of such regional cults can be extensively modified by local cult leaders to suit local needs. When applied to Chavin this means its iconography could be substantially altered yet sup­posedly mean more or less the same thing. Such flexible interpretation of Chavin iconography has always been a major problem within Chavin studies, and Burger's interpretation does not solve the problem. Neither does he offer a definition of what the Chavin art style is. To his credit, he has reefined the time span of the Early Horizon and the spread of the Chavin cult to 500-250 B.C., thus making the Early Horizon more of a horizon in a temporal sense. However, with the reassignment of most of the monumental coastal sites with friezes to the Initial period, the "Chavin cult" hardly exists along the central and north coast. Burger is reduced to citing examples from looted or isolated contexts, such as the Chongoyape gold or the Karwa textiles, to doc­ument the spread of the Chavin cult. Clearly there is 
still a definitional problem concerning the Chavin phe­
nomenon, but the question now is not how widespread 
was its "horizon" style, but rather, is it widespread 
enough even to be called a horizon style? We agree 
with Burger that much more work needs to be done 
on Early Horizon sites to resolve this problem. 
Despite our reservations about some interpretations, 
Burger's book is truly a superb volume that belongs on 
all Andeanists' bookshelves. The book is probably too 
detailed for textbook use except in specialized upper­
level undergraduate and graduate-level courses. The 
price tag is quite high for Thames and Hudson, but the 
illustrations and information provided make it worth 
the price.

The Papagayo site, located on the Bay ofCulebra on the Pacific coast of Costa Rica, was excavated from 1957 to 1959 by Claude F. Baudez. The ceramic ty­pology was previously published in 1988 by the three junior authors, and the present volume is a more com­prehensive site report prepared under Baudez's super­vision. Papagayo was the first site to be extensively excavated in northwestern Costa Rica, and the report has been long awaited and is very welcome. The vol­ume contains a discussion of the excavations at the site, as well as discussions of the architectural, sculp­tural, mortuary, and ceramic data. The volume is in French, and, while it is generously illustrated for those who are nonliterate in the language, a summary in 
English and/or Spanish would also have helped to in­
crease the utility of the report. The original plan was 
to publish the report completely in Spanish, but un­
fortunately this was not possible. 
The Papagayo site presents prima facie evidence for taking the same attitude toward sites in developing countries that the cultural-resource-management ethic has engendered in the United States: that every single site is important until it has been professionally eval­uated. As the authors point out, Papagayo cannot be understood as an isolate-it must be interpreted within the context of other sites in the bay area and beyond. Of the more than 60 sites identified around the Bay of Culebra, Papagayo presents unique features and pat­terns, both in comparison with six other excavated sites and with what can be deduced from evaluation of sur­face indications at non tested sites. This is an important dimension to keep in mind, as the Bay of Culebra tourist project seems once again to be back on track and hotel and recreational development is imminent. 
The site is located on the north side of the bay, on 
a narrow mesa top 120 m above the level of the bay. 
The site area measures 400 m east-west and 300 m 
north-south. Habitable space is limited by extensive 
rocky areas. The authors suggest that the location was 
easily defensible, which may be true. To date, however, 
archaeological investigations have yielded little, if any, 
evidence for warfare or conflict. The site consisted of 
four circular structures, numerous shell accumulations, 
and three cemetery areas. The site was occupied from 
A.D. 500 to 1520, and the mortuary remains relate to the entire time period; each of the three cemeteries dates to one of the principal temporal periods in the Greater Nicoya sequence (Early, Middle, and Late Pol­ychrome). The nearest water source is approximately 100 m away, and, based on data from other research, we can speculate that the site may not have been oc­cupied during the height of the dry season when many water sources run dry. The excavations were conducted before there was much emphasis on the recovery of pollen, fauna, phytolith, or other specialized remains, and the report focuses on the more standard artifact categories of ceramics, stone sculpture, and burials. There are also brief discussions of roller stamps, notched sherds, spindle whorls, carved bone, crude pendants, and polished-and chipped-stone artifacts that should be of comparative interest to regional specialists. An appendix by Jean-Louis Heim analyzes the human re­mains. 
Social organization is interpreted as multifamily oc­cupation of communal dwellings, based on the dimen­sions of the large circular houses. It is unclear whether or not these houses were initially constructed as early as A.D. 500, or whether they only came into use later, around A.D. 1200. During the Early Polychrome pe­riod, burials were placed outside the houses and also outside the areas identified as being of special religious significance; in the succeeding Middle Polychrome pe­riod, burials were placed in graves under the floors of the houses. Illustrations are sufficiently numerous and 
detailed that in most cases individual artifacts can be 
referred to their original context in the burial and other 
excavation plan views. Religious activity is suggested 
by the numerous stone sculptures, and participation in 
external (local and regional) networks is shown by the 
presence of nonlocal polychrome ceramics, obsidian, 
and other less frequently represented exotic artifacts or 
materials. 
The collection of sculpture from the site is the largest 
published from a northwestern Costa Rican site. While 
there are looters' reports from the site of Nacascolo 
(also on the Bay ofCulebra) and travelers' reports from 
the Bay of Salinas, this is the first large assemblage to 
be described from a scientifically excavated context. 
All of the sculptures appear to have been made from 
locally available materials and are interpreted as rep­
resenting the local cosmology. Forms and motifs are 
primarily crocodilian, with minor attributions of jag­
uar imagery. 
A minor chronological point is that the ceramic­
chronology chart (p. 216) should show the occupation 
of the Papagayo site running through to at least A.D. 
1500, rather than ending at around A.D. 1100, as is 
shown. The later dating is suggested by the presence 
of two late ceramic types (Luna Polychrome and Mu­
rillo Applique) in one of the burials at the site. 
The authors point out that research and interpreta­
tion in lower Central America has too long been bogged 
down in debates over the mesoamerican or South 
American nature of various sites and traits, while new 
research and the analysis and publication of previously 
excavated materials suggest the need for much more 
emphasis on local development. With the combination 
of mesoamerican and South American inspired motifs 
on some ceramics, locally derived motifs on others and 
on some stone sculpture, circular houses, obsidian, par­
ticipation in regional ceramic-distribution patterns, and 
clear evidence of changes in mortuary practices through 
time, the Papagayo site is an excellent example oflocal, 
though not isolated, development in Greater Nicoya 
and lower Central America. This publication is an ex­
ample for other archaeologists, in whatever area, of the 
importance of bringing out reports on previously ex­
cavated materials, no matter how long the delay. The 
volume is a must for anyone working in this area and

This book represents the final report of Karen Stoth­ert's long-term investigations of the Vegas culture of coastal Ecuador. It is a welcome addition to the all­too-few contributions to our understanding of the pre­ceramic cultures of South America. The book is both detailed in its discussion of the excavation and analysis of the type site for the Vegas culture and broad in its exploration of the significance of the discoveries there for our comprehension of the early occupation of west­ern South America. In short, it provides the kind of comprehensive report all investigators should strive to produce. 
The heart of the book is found in Chapters II, III, and IV, where the author details the excavation tech­niques used at the Vegas site, interprets the absolute dates obtained, and describes the materials recovered from the site. The major problem that Stothert con­fronted in her excavations was the lack of recognizable stratigraphy. The fact that intrusions of later ceramics and interments could not be identified in the soil made chronological interpretations troublesome, especially those regarding the early appearance of cultigens. Still, the presence of continuous levels of shells and the good sequence of radiocarbon dates from the bottom of the midden to the top supports her contention that the site accumulated gradually, and that the overwhelming ma­jority of the remains are in fact preceramic. She arbi­trarily divides the Vegas occupation into an Early phase ( 10,000-8000 B.P.) and a Late phase (8000-6600 B.P.). Stothert provides a large number of profile drawings of the excavations to allow the reader to evaluate her arguments. 
A major contribution of this study is the detailed 
description of the Vegas lithic assemblage. Stothert's 
principal conclusion is that the basic technology is sim­
ple and expedient. There are very few heavily re­
touched tools. In fact, by her definition of retouch, 
there were only 200 retouched artifacts from the site. 
However, this discounts the much larger number of 
lightly modified or utilized tools that formed the bulk 
of the assemblage. Like other early coastal assemblages 
from Panama to northern Peru, Vegas is a unifacial 
complex. Stothert interprets the Vegas assemblage as 
being one that was satisfactory for the activities un­
dertaken, which included the processing of terrestrial 
and marine fauna as well as vegetal material. She also 
found a small number ofnonlithic artifacts that suggest 
the presence of tools of perishable materials. The ef­
fectiveness of the industry is indicated by the fact that it changed little through the 3,400 years of its existence. 
Her descriptions do allow for greater comparisons of the Vegas complex to others already defined, and it is readily apparent that both similarities and differ­ences exist. Contemporary coastal complexes from northern Peru to Panama share a general similarity in being unifacial, simple, and made of locally available materials. However, thanks to Stothert's detailed de­scriptions, differences can now be seen to exist, es­pecially between the assemblages from Ecuador north and those in Peru. The most notable of these differences is the presence of mortars and distinctive ground-stone tools as well as a greater number of retouched tools (although the latter may be a function of differences in opinion concerning what constitutes retouch) in the Peruvian sites. 
The description of materials recovered from the site is good, with an ample number of photographs of the artifacts. However, some detailed drawings of the lith­ics would have facilitated comparisons with other ar­eas. It is unfortunate that Stothert did not have at her disposal a use-wear specialist to examine the flakes used in her experimental studies. I do not agree with her (or other authors') views that such studies would not provide worthwhile results. The potential benefits of such studies have recently been supported by Jack Rossen and Tom Dillehay's examination of tools from the upper Zana Valley (see Rossen's dissertation, Ec­otones and Low-Risk Intensification: The Middle Pre­ceramic Habitation of Nanchoc, Northern Peru, 1991 ). 
Chapters V-XI provide specialized analyses of the human remains, the fauna! remains, and the phytolith and other vegetal evidence. These analyses resulted in significant new information concerning preceramic cultural patterns in Ecuador. Douglas Ubelaker's skel­etal analysis adds to the growing body of literature indicating that post-Pleistocene hunters and gatherers had fewer pathologies than their horticultural descen­dants, implying better health. Unfortunately, the writ­ing of this book was completed before the publication ofJeffrey Quilter's analysis of the preceramic mortuary population from Paloma, Peru (Life and Death at Pal­oma, 1989). Comparisons between these two sites would have been interesting. Elizabeth Wing's analysis of the desert fox (Dusicyon sechurae) suggests not only that it may have had ritual importance for the Vegas in­habitants but also the possibility that it was domesti­cated. Thomas Chase's analysis of the fauna! remains indicate that Vegas people existed on a diet of terres­trial and marine resources. Stothert notes that there was a slight shift during the Late Vegas phase toward a greater importance of fishing and less reliance on small mammal exploitation, and that this change was associated with a decrease in the use of concha prieta (Anadara tuberculosa) and an increase in other kinds of shellfish. 
Probably the most controversial result of the anal­
yses concerns the evidence for cultivation of maize 
during the Late Vegas phase. Using techniques pio­
neered by Deborah Pearsall, Dolores Piperno suggests 
that maize can be differentiated from closely related 
wild forms by the presence of high percentages of large 
or extralarge phytoliths coupled with high percentages
