lar in Mesoamerica and deserves all the attention it receives. Brown's chapter on karst terrain and caves and cenotes at Mayapan is the third study linking archaeo­logical settlement data with subterranean features that appear in ethnohistoric documents. Brown's perspective is at once geological, with a detailed discussion of karst terrain, and anthropological, drawing upon survey data from this Postclassic center and utilizing passages from the Books of Chilam Balam that describe rites con­ducted at Mayapan involving sacrifice and caves. As with Acatzingo Viejo, Mayapan was founded (or, more appro­priately, centered) at a location bearing caverns beneath key architectural components. 
Thematically related to these chapters is the one by Evon Z. Vogt and David Stuart, "Some Notes on Ritual Caves among the Ancient and Modern Maya." The authors discuss the importance of caves and mountains in ancient Maya religion and present evidence for the reading of a glyph common to Classic inscriptions as CH'EEN or "cave." Citing textual evidence from Tikal and Palenque, one implication of this reading is that some emblem glyphs may have been specified as cave names, or that some kingdoms and polities were metaphorically perceived as caves. The association between the CH'EEN glyph with place names suggests that caves may have been seen as places of political and communal foundation among the Classic Maya. In bridging between the Classic past and the present, the bulk of the chapter presents abundant accounts of Chi­apas communities that continue to view caves and moun­tains, and the deities that inhabit them, as intimately tied to local prosperity. Communities express variations on central themes and beliefs associated with caves, and the authors attribute these differences to "different his­torical episodes between the Pre-Columbian Maya and the conquering Spaniards" (p. 178). We should be care­ful, though, not to presume that there were not also vari­ations among Classic Maya centers and their ritual practices resulting from their own political histories or unique features of their sacred landscapes. 
Another theme that makes headway in understand­ing cave rites involves examining the roles and identi­ties of individual practitioners. Keith M. Prufer' s chapter "Shamans, Caves, and the Role of Ritual Specialists in Maya Society" compares data from near-entrance twi­light zones with those from remote dark zones. Prufer suggests that cave rituals conducted near entryways, modified in some cases to accommodate large congre­gations, were performed by elites, while dark zones were the purview of non-elite shamans largely respon­sible for rites of healing, illness, and matters occurring "outside of mainstream political institutions or at the margins of society" (p. 214). Relying heavily on ethno­graphic comparisons, Prufer's analysis of shamans will 
be significant for scholars concerned with understand­ing the fluid, situational, and contextual nature of ritual practice. Alan R. Sandstrom's chapter "The Cave­Pyramid Complex among the Contemporary Nahua of Northern Veracruz" also places individuals in a medi­ating role between natural forces, such as rainfall, and people. Sandstrom deals with a great many topics, including cultural continuity in Mesoamerica, with tra­ditional knowledge and practice being preserved through both ritual specialists and syncretized beliefs shared by the local populace. In the case of regional Nahua and Otomi villages, these beliefs reflect the strong associa­tion between natural and social events and the earth's deities (which inhabit the surrounding caves and moun­tains), and emphasize the reciprocal relationship between the two. While the narrative that runs through Sandstrom's chapter features a male ritual specialist, Cir­ilo, who is responsible for maintaining traditional ritual knowledge, Doris Heyden's chapter, "Rites of Passage and Other Ceremonies in Caves" describes a woman, Josefina Romero, who inherits the role of curandero, healer, from her father who performed many of his rites in caves outside of Mexico City. Heyden's chapter has two central themes: the different life stages of people associated with cave ritual, especially birth and death, and natural phenomena ascribed to caves. As with Sand­strom's chapter, emphasis is placed on the reciprocal relationships between people and the natural world. Dominique Rissolo's study "Beneath the Yalahau: Emerging Patterns of Ancient Maya Ritual Cave Use from Northern Quintana Roo, Mexico" provides further discussion of cave ritual practitioners in presenting new data from this poorly understood region. Rissolo pre­sents many new caves, including shallow rockshelters and collapsed domes, and includes a focus on the ritual significance of water found in these features to regional populations. He sees architectural modification oflarger caverns as evidence of their "appropriation" by elite rit­ualists and argues that the shallow rockshelters were likely the purview of non-elites. These statements asso­ciate greater size and elaboration, even of natural spaces, with higher social ranking and appear at odds with Prufer's consideration of similar issues from southern Belize. Is this simply a matter of varying interpretation, or were there real differences in the kinds of ancient prac­titioners that utilized these underground spaces from one part of the Maya world to another? This is an inter­esting question that future research might address. The chapter by Abigail E. Adams and James E. Brady, "Ethnographic Notes on Maya Q'eqchi' Cave Rites: Implications for Archaeological Interpretation," focuses heavily on the identity of ritual performers, both for cer­emonies in caves as well as those that preceded cave­specific rites and that were conducted in aboveground

contexts. Adams and Brady argue correctly that the sur­face and Underworld realms, and the social behaviors that are to be found in each, are best understood in rela­tion to each other. Reiterating the theme that caves, mountains, and their resident deities are specific to regional traditions, the authors note that many deities in the Alta Verapaz have quite specific gendered identities. Interestingly, while women never perform cave rites (in contrast to Heyden's chapter), they are central to cere­monies performed in domestic or communal contexts that accompany or are in preparation for cave rites. I found the discussion of muxuq, "what is hidden under Q'eqchi' Maya women's cortes (skirts)" (p. 315-316), and of the importance of this nuanced gender ideology that underscores the complementary ritual roles of men and women to be among the most interesting passages in the entire volume. 
Yet another theme shared among several chapters involves describing patterned deposits and special assemblages that comprised ritual cave practice. Many scholars observed elements of the pan-Mesoamerican cosmological quincunx in caves, including the study by Holley Moyes entitled "Cluster Concentrations, Bound­ary Markers, and Ritual Pathways: A GIS Analysis of Artifact Cluster Patterns at Actun Tunich Muknal, Belize." Moyes employs powerful GIS analysis to derive meaning from meticulously recorded spatial data to con­clude that, over time, the prescribed movements of rit­ual practitioners at Actun Tunich Muknal generated patterned deposits demarking cardinal focal points, a central element, and conjoining pathways. Moyes argues that these components together make up a highly sym­bolic circuit that was traversed repeatedly in ceremo­nial events. Similarly, in her chapter "A Cognitive Approach to Artifact Distribution in Caves of the Maya Area," Andrea Stone presents information suggesting that vertical, as well as horizontal, relationships were expressed in ritual deposits in caves. Both of these chap­ters potentially face palimpsest problems in interpret­ing material remains from surface contexts inside of caves in this fashion, although the strength of Moyes's analysis makes her case particularly persuasive. The beautifully illustrated chapter by Jaime J. Awe, Cameron Griffith, and Sherry Gibbs, "Cave Stelae and Megalithic Monuments in Western Belize," presents data from sev­eral caves describing a cave stela cult that appears to have been a regional tradition. This practice spans the 
Late Classic to Early Postclassic periods, representing 
important evidence of continued ritual practice after the 
abandonment of virtually all of the nearby surface sites. 
Janet Fitzsimmons's chapter "Pre-Hispanic Rain Cere­
monies in Blade Cave, Sierra Mazateca, Oaxaca, Mex­
ico" presents what can only be described as a stunning 
assemblage of cave offerings that were recorded between 
1985-1987. Forty-three cache vessels were found in one part of one chamber alone. Indeed, virtually the entire cavern is littered with offerings containing a vari­ety of materials and animal remains, as well as the strate­gic relocation of speleothems, as evidence of frequent ceremonial visitation to this locality. It would be inter­esting to see whether spatial analyses of some of these deposits would demonstrate patterns similar to those recorded by Moyes. 
In the Maw of the Earth Monster poses one of the more comprehensive and multiperspective approaches to ritual and ideological practice to emerge from Mesoamerica in recent years. This volume will present some challenges to readers, as the many uses and inter­pretations of data that are offered are uneven at times and even contradictory. What the volume does accom­plish, however, is an effective presentation of different beliefs regarding caves and underground spaces and the roles of ritual practitioners to be found in Mesoamer­ica. While elements of cultural continuity are clearly demonstrated in these chapters, so too is the adaptive and fluid nature of ritual practice and belief that were and remain associated with caves.

This book brings together the results of excavations and various studies directed and commissioned by Elizabeth Righter on the Tutu archaeological site, located on St. Thomas in the United States Virgin Islands. The site was discovered in 1990 during preliminary construction activities for a shopping mall and subsequently reported to Righter, who was then the territorial archaeologist for the U.S. Virgin Islands. Since the mall development was privately funded and located on privately owned land, the project did not trigger Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act. Through negotiations with the developer, Righter was afforded the opportunity to con­duct salvage excavations prior to the obliteration of the site. 
Righter is to be commended for marshaling volun­
teers locally and abroad to assist in excavating and doc­
umenting the site and for obtaining contributions from 
local businesses and hotels to complete the project. She 
also assembled specialists from a number of disciplines 
to analyze selected bodies of data that are discussed in 
this book.
