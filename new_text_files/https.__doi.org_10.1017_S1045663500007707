Gasco presents documentary and archaeological data on pre-and post-conquest periods at five communities in Chiapas. 
Mark Lycett discusses a seventeenth-century mission in New Mexico. Although it does not deal with "Mesoamerica," this chapter provides a nice contrast with the others in terms of archaeological remains and social dynamics. It makes one wonder whether Mesoamerica is a useful scale of analysis for research on the social expressions of Spanish imperialism. Mov­ing to the Maya realm, Susan Kepecs applies world sys­tem theory to the Late Postclassic and Early Colonial periods in northern Yucatan. Don Rice and Prudence Rice describe documentary data and limited architec­tural data on Postclassic and Colonial sites in the Peten. Rani Alexander compares a detailed archaeological study of a Postclassic site (Isla Cilvituk) to documen­tary data (supplemented by one day of archaeological survey) at a Colonial site (Sahcabchen) in Campeche. Finally, Joel Palka analyzes archaeological remains from nineteenth-century Lacandon Maya sites. There is no synthesis or concluding chapter. 
Several chapters present little or no archaeological data, and in most of the remaining chapters the archae­ological coverage of the Colonial period is rudimentary and spotty. Where are the basic data on Colonial period settlement patterns, demography, trade, production, urbanism, and household consumption, topics that are staples of Mesoamerican archaeology? Although there are special problems of post-conquest archaeological data that hinder the analysis of some of these topics, I am disappointed at the "Great Wall" between Postclas­sic and Colonial archaeology that runs through many of the chapters in the book. It is not clear to what extent the minimal discussion of Colonial archaeological data in the book is compensated for by more extensive pre­sentations of data in other publications. 
For some chapters, the "archaeological perspectives" of the book's subtitle refer to archaeologists interpret­ing Colonial documentary data (usually from secondary sources and transcriptions of documents). Yet few Mesoamericanist archaeologists have sufficient training or experience in Colonial historiography to produce credible analyses. Archaeologists need to work harder to collaborate with historians (and ethnohistorians) who have much to offer but may avoid interaction with archaeologists. Only one research project described in the book (the Rice's "Proyecto Maya-Colonial") has a historian as a major collaborator-Grant Jones­although he is not a coauthor on the chapter. Archaeol­ogists should either improve their historiographic skills or else collaborate actively with professional historians; otherwise it will be hard to take their interpretations of Colonial-period archaeological sites seriously. 
Much of the research described in The Postclassic to Spanish-Era Transition in Mesoamerica would ben­efit from a more explicit use of theory and comparative studies of imperialism and colonialism. Two chapters show a very effective use of social theory: Kepecs applies a world system perspective to explore the wider connections of northern Yucatecan salt producers and others, and Alexander uses household ecology theory to compare agrarian patterns in the Postclassic and Colo­nial periods. Two authors (Lycett and Rodrfguez­Alegria) devote space to postmodern posturing, which leads them to some rather unremarkable conclusions (e.g., that Spanish colonial processes and outcomes were not identical throughout the New World). There is a real need in Spanish Colonial studies for social theory that is less polemic and less speculative in tone. 
In their introductory chapter, Kepecs and Alexander suggest that archaeologists "are in an excellent position to contribute to theories of culture contact, resistance, changing ethnic identity, and the progress of colonial­ism and globalization" (p. 12). The chapters in this book, for the most part, bear out their optimism, although most of these contributions remain in the realm of the poten­tial rather than the actual. The chapters that provide the most balanced and rigorous comparisons of Postclassic and Colonial archaeological remains are those of Charl­ton et al., Gasco, Kepecs, and the Rices. These chapters most faithfully adhere to the goals and themes of the volume, and they suggest something of the potential for continuing research in this area. 
The situation in Mesoamerican archaeology has cer­tainly come a long way since my undergraduate days, when I recall being told to ignore glazed pottery because it was modem garbage of little interest to archaeologists. At that time, Tom Charlton was one of the only Mesoamericanist archaeologists taking Colonial period archaeology seriously. In The Postclassic to Spanish-Era Transition in Mesoamerica, he is joined by 12 like­minded colleagues, and this book should help assure that their numbers continue to increase in the future.

the challenge to produce synthetic and integrated expla­
nations of human remains and their importance for 
understanding diet, health, demography, and related­
ness in the archaeological record. 
This intellectual goal is well-executed in Vera Tiesler andAndrea Cucina's new edited volume on the life his­tory of the enigmatic Maya ruler, Janaab' Pakal. Through a focused, interdisciplinary effort, this volume tries to answer some of the most pressing questions about the Maya ruler, and to place the resulting conclusions within a framework of geographic and regional variation, as well as within the dynastic tradition of the Classic Maya. The problem-driven focus of their research is centered on the questions of how old Pakal was at his death, whether he suffered from congenital deformities and supernumerary digits, and his history of residence and geographic origin. Chapters 1 (Tiesler and Cucina) and 2 (Tiesler) provide important historical and contextual information on the study of the skeletal remains from the Temple of the Inscriptions and the reader will find themselves referring back to these chapters often. 
Chapters 3, 4, 5, and 9 concern the question of the age of the skeleton found in the Tomb of the Inscriptions, derived from estimates of age-related morphological change, histomorphological change, demographic con­text and comparative morphological and epigraphic evi­dence, respectively. The question of Pakal's age at death has provoked controversy since his discovery in 1952, and stems largely from disagreement over the interpre­tation of the glyphs and inscriptions commemorating his reign and the physical anthropologist's accounts of the tomb contents at discovery. Whereas early accounts seemed to agree on an age-at-death between the fourth and fifth decade, reevaluation of the epigraphic evidence and calendrical dates argue for an age-at-death of just over 80 years. Buikstra and colleagues (Chapter 3) assess the skeletal material using standard indices for age esti­mates and compare them with estimates derived from Transition Analysis. They conclude that it is likely that 
Pakal lived at least into his later sixth decade, and pos­sibly older. While the confidence of age estimates pre­clude the ascription ofPakal's death in his eightieth year, their analysis indicates that he lived significantly longer than the early estimate of 40-50 years. Stout and Streeter (Chapter 4) examine the histomorphology of cortical bone from Pakal and conclude that his bones reflect advanced osteopenia, or decrease in bone mineral den­sity, coincident with Tiesler's bioarchaeological assess­ment in Chapter 2. While osteopenia can occur from multiple causes not directly ascribed to advanced age, the preponderance of histological findings support the conclusion that Pakal was indeed much older than the early accounts suggested. 
In Chapter 5, Marquez et al. attempt to place Pakal in the demographic context of Late Classic Palenque to 
determine if there is a demographic precedent for an individual of his apparently advanced age. In their analy­sis of both high and low status individuals from Palenque, they find no evidence of any having lived beyond their fifth decade, making the putative age of Pakal a remarkable outlier in his cohort. However, the presence of occupational markers and high prevalence of osteoarthritis in younger age groups in both high and low status individuals suggests that many of the stresses in evidence among the population at large were not vis­ited on Pakal. It would be interesting to investigate the patterns of dental wear and attrition in this population with that observed for Pakal, to provide additional evi­dence for determining the utility of Late Classic 
Palenque demography as comparative data. The geographic origin of Pakal and the companion 
interment of the so-called "Red Queen" are taken up by Price and colleagues in Chapter 7. They test the hypoth­esis that most male Maya nobility were derived locally and that females could represent either local or distant marriage arrangements to satisfy regional alliances. By examining the strontium isotope values in both bones and tooth enamel, which distinguish recent and natal areas of residence, respectively, they conclude that Pakal appears to have been raised in and was a long-term res­ident of the Palenque area. The Red Queen's slightly depressed 87Srl86Sr ratio is nonetheless consistent with a local or nearby derivation. While the results do not specifically identify the location of birth of either Pakal or the Red Queen, they are consistent with the epigraphic record. Additional strontium isotope analysis of the tooth enamel from skeletal remains found in Palenque should help to create a regional signature of isotopic variation for the area and indentify broad scale patterns of migra­tion in the Palenque region. 
Perhaps the most interesting chapter in this volume concerns the inconographic evidence for congenital deformities, supernumerary digits, and other malfor­mations in Pakal and his lineage (Romano, Chapter 6). Although no osteological evidence has been discovered that Pakal was afflicted with any of these conditions, the notion that physical abnormalities were regular and repeated iconographic motifs in Mesoamerican cultures is a fascinating statement about the possible meaning of physical difference or handicap and social status. These depictions seem at odds with the concept of iconographic rendering of Maya rulers "as young, potent juveniles, emulating the beauty and unblemished face of the young Maize God" (Grube, Chapter I 0: 164 ). Perhaps the meaning of epigraphic symbols that depict Maya elite as physically deformed or different has as much to do with signaling on a broad scale as with the reporting of the pertinent facts of noble birth, ascension, and death. 
In sum, Janaab' Pakal of Palenque presents an illu­minating, synthetic perspective of Maya nobility through

The volume assesses the con­clusions of the original 1952 study without judgment and maintains an introspective stance on what evalua­tion the next generation of bioarchaeologists-with new theoretical and methodological frameworks for the study of the osteology and interment of Pakal-will have on the present work.

This volume presents the results of recent investigations into Maya ritual in cave contexts. Perhaps the central theme of the volume is that caves are religious contexts, and that the vast majority of archaeological data within caves represent the material remains of ritual activity. Following a brief introduction by Prufer and Brady, 18 chapters are organized into three sections, and present some of the most recent data on ancient Maya cave use. 
Section 1, "Sacred Landscape and Artificial Caves," examines the integration of caves as sacred locales within architectural groups. Topics include the integra­tion of natural cenotes and caves into the built environ­ment, the use of artificial caves that replicate the sacred landscape, and the control of access to caves as sources of social power. In addition, one of the contributors examines religious, rather than economic, aspects of settlement on Cozumel Island, through an examination of the role of caves and cenotes in the orientation of the site's ritual pilgrimage circuit. 
Section 2, ''Reconstructing Ritual and Cosmology;' examines a variety of ways in which the material remains of ritual action are manifested in cave contexts. Indi­vidual chapters discuss the use of caves as ritual sweat­baths, evidence of scribal pilgrimages to caves, and epigraphic and archaeological evidence of caves as a tar­get of deliberate desecration in ancient Maya warfare. Of particular interest are two chapters that examine the ritual use of cave formations (speleothems) outside of caves by documenting both the patterns of breakage and removal of speleothems within caves, as well as their distribution in surface archaeological contexts. 
Section 3, "Interpretations of Human Skeletal Mate­rial in Caves," presents current interpretations of oste­ological data from both caves and cenotes in the Maya lowlands. Chapters within this section discuss the intriguing possibility that rockshelters may have been a preferred location for burials among the ancient Maya. In addition, chapters examine bioarchaeological evi­dence for human sacrifice in caves, as well as the tapho­nomic processes involved in the deposition of osteological materials within cenotes. 
Prufer and Brady's edited volume is an important contribution to the small but growing body of literature on ancient Maya cave use. Although this volume is rel­evant primarily to Maya archaeologists, it is of broader relevance to all scholars interested in the study of reli­gion through the material remains of ritual activity.
