THE "INVISIBLE" MAYA: MINIMALLY MOUNDED RESIDENTIAL 
SETTLEMENT AT ITZAN, PETEN, GUATEMALA 

Kevin J. Johnston 
Through analyses of data recovered at Itzdn, Guatemala, this paper examines the architectural morphology and the prob­able functions of" invisible" building remains in the Maya Lowlands. Invisible building remains are buried, leave no sur­face traces, and cannot be detected during surface survey, which is the principal settlement detection technique employed by Mayanists. Data at ltzdn and other sites suggest that Maya invisible buildings are a more abundant settlement category 
than many archaeologists have supposed.

or 50 years archaeologists have collected settlement data in the Maya Lowlands almost exclusively through surface survey. While it is true that subsurface testing has been an important component of many settlement sur­veys, generally it has been conducted with the goal of dating and establishing the function of surface-visible mounds rather than discovering buried architectural remains that leave no surface traces. Even as they rely on surface survey, archae­ologists have expressed concern that culturally important components of the Maya settlement system could be buried and that surface-collected survey data, consequently, could be incomplete and nonrepresentative. In the literature, this pos­sibility is described as the "invisible settlement" problem (Bullard 1960; A. Chase 1990; D. Chase 1990; Culbert et al. 1990; Fash 1986; Kurjack et al. 1965; Pyburn 1990; Tourtellot 1993; Webster and Gonlin 1988). 
A growing number of archaeologists special­izing in complex society are acknowledging that in their regions of study, invisible settlement could be a significant research issue. For example, in the Mediterranean (Cherry et al. 1991; Given et al. 1999; Terrenato and Ammerman 1996), Mesopotamia (Banning 1996; Brooks et al. 1982), the Levant (Simmons 1998), and the Nile Valley (Hassan 1997), where settlement data have been collected predominantly through surface survey, archaeologists are expressing doubts about how representative those data may be. Partly in response to these concerns, study of the environ­mental and archaeological factors that affect the exposure (or the lack thereof) of settlement remains on landscapes has emerged during the last two decades as a major research topic (e.g., Balek 2002; Perring 1992; Fish and Gresham 1990; Hen­don 1992; Johnson and Watson-Stegner 1990; Kil­lion et al. 1989; Schiffer 1987; Stafford 1995; Sullivan 1998; Van Nest 2002; Wandsnider and Camilli 1992). Nonetheless, in the Maya Low­lands and elsewhere much basic research on the problem remains to be done.

ing discoveries at the site of Itzan, Guatemala. Specifically, I examine the architecture and arti­fact assemblages of eight invisible structures, sev­eral of which are clustered in patio groups. As indicated by their architecture and artifacts, the structures are house remains. The discovery at Itzan and other sites of invisible structures has important ramifications for Maya archaeology. 
"Invisible settlement" consists of largely or completely buried settlement remains that leave no or very few surface traces and therefore are very difficult or impossible to detect during sur­face survey. Only the issue of invisible architec­tural remains is examined here, although nonarchitectural remains potentially could be an abundant invisible settlement component in the Maya Lowlands. 
The discussion of Maya invisible settlement is divided into two sections. In the first I identify the major methodological challenges that invisible settlement presents to Maya archaeology. Promi­nent among these is the reconstruction of ancient population dynamics and their implications for interpretations of key processes of cultural change, including the ninth-century "collapse" of southern lowland complex society. If archaeolo­gists' reconstructions of Maya population dynam­ics are grounded in faulty or incomplete settlement data, then their explanations of culture changes, which are linked to those reconstructions, could be faulty, too, and thus may require re-evaluation and adjustment. 
In the second section, I examine the Itzan invis­ible structures, documenting, first, their primary architectural features, and, second, their artifact assemblages and other features that are informa­tive about structure function. The ltzan structures, I conclude, are house remains. Combined with data recovered at other sites, the Itzan information indi­cates that prior to the Late Classic collapse, the low­land Maya population was larger, denser, and more complex than surface data alone would suggest. Most current reconstructions of ancient Maya pop­ulation trends fail to account adequately for the presence of an invisible population sector, whose size, age, and geographical distribution has yet to be established (A. Chase 1990; D. Chase 1990; Johnston 2002; Pyburn 1987, 1989, 1990, 1996, 1997). 

Surface Survey, Sampling Representativeness, and Parameter Inference 
In settlement research, the archaeologist's primary objective is to detect during survey a sample of ele­ments from the target population (the total settle­ment system or some sector of it) for the purpose of drawing inferences about some properties (or tar­get parameters) of that population (Lightfoot 1986; McManamon 1984; Nance 1983; Orton 2000; Stu­art 1984). To accomplish this, the archaeologist must (a) detect a sample of settlement elements and 
(b) generate from that sample an estimate of target parameters. That estimate will be accurate (a mea­sure of the correspondence between the sample's estimation and the parameter's true value [Orton 2000:26]) and reliable (the degree to which vari­ance in the sample population reflects variance in the target population [Nance 1987 :249)) only if the sample of elements is representative. If the archae­ologist detects an incomplete or biased sample­for example, one composed only of architecturally prominent settlement remains where nonpromi­nent remains also are present-the estimate of tar­get parameters generated from the sample will be inaccurate. 
Among the most important target parameters that Mayanists estimate from settlement data are periodized population size, density, and growth trends. Archaeologists link these estimates to expla­nations of processes of cultural adaptation and change, including the ninth-century "collapse" of complex society in the southern Maya Lowlands. According to the model endorsed by most archae­ologists, that collapse was in large part a demo­graphic and political crisis precipitated by profound anthropogenic change set in motion by an intensi­fication of agriculture necessitated by population growth (Abrams et al 1996; Culbert 1988; Morley 1946; Paine and Freter 1996; Rice 1993; Sanders 1973; Sanders and Webster 1994; Santley et al. 1986; Sharer 1994; Webster 2002; Willey and Shimkin 1973). 
Mayanists, who collect settlement data almost exclusively through surface survey, estimate ancient population trends using a "house mound count" method (Turner 1990:304-305; Willey 1981:388). They count all surface-visible mounds identified as house remains within a study area,

multiply that number by a constant thought to rep­resent average family size, and factor in adjust­ments to account for variations in length of occupation, structure function, and other variables (Turner 1990). The product is the total number or density of persons per square kilometer per time period.1 As Pyburn (1987: 111) notes, the house mound count method rests on an undeclared and largely untested assumption: that all Maya houses, and by implication all Maya social and economic groups, are represented in the archaeological record by surface-visible mounds. If the Maya settlement record contains substantial numbers of house remains that leave no surface traces-then the sur­vey samples of settlement will be biased and incom­plete and the estimated population parameters will contain unidentifiable and potentially significant errors (A. Chase 1990; D. Chase 1990; Drennan 1996:79-97; Nance 1983:293-300; Pyburn 1989, 1990, 1997). 
Mayanists are deeply divided about the poten­tial significance of the invisible settlement problem. Some believe that few if any invisible structures are present in the Maya Lowlands (Bullard 1960:359; Tourtellot 1988:349-351, 1993:233; Willey et al. 1965:272-276). Others conclude that invisible structures are a logical settlement category for which there is little conclusive published docu­mentation (Ashmore 1981 b:61; Fash 1986:84-85, 1994:188; Haviland 1985:186; Rice 1988:233; Rice and Culbert 1990:14-15; Santley 1990:332; Tourtellot 1983:44-45; Webster and Gonlin 1988: 173, 185). Still others caution that the prob­lem may be spatially and chronologically hetero­geneous: invisible structures may exist in some Maya lowland regions (Ashmore 1981b:61; Har­rison 1990:106; Webster and Gonlin 1988:185) or may have been occupied during some time periods (Lucero2002:821; RingleandAndrews 1988:172) but not others. 
Among those who endorse the hypothesis that invisible settlement exists in the Maya Lowlands, estimates of the size of the invisible Maya popula­tion vary widely. Some posit that to account for the presence of invisible houses, current estimates of Maya population must be increased by 10 percent (Culbert et al. 1990: 115); others propose a lOOper­cent increase (D. Chase 1990:205, 208).2 In other words, some archaeologists believe there is no need to adjust current estimates of lowland Maya pop­ulation size, while others foresee upward adjust­ments of between several hundred thousand and several million people. The implications are strik­ing. If archaeologists discover that substantial num­bers of invisible structures are present in the Maya Lowlands, then adjustments will have to be made to current models of (a) Maya population growth and density trends, (b) the anthropogenic effects of population dynamics, and (c) the relationship between population trends and processes of cultural change, including the collapse, all of which are linked to surface-collected settlement data (see A. Chase 1990; D. Chase 1990; Pyburn 1996). 

Invisible Settlement: The Research Challenge 

Invisible settlement-whether in the Maya Low­lands or elsewhere-presents archaeologists with six principal research challenges, each of which can be phrased as a question. I review five of these questions as they pertain to lowland Maya invisi­ble settlement below and one in the paper's con­clusions. 
First, where settlement includes invisible struc­tures, how do these structures become buried (invis­ible)? Elsewhere (Johnston 2002:5-12) I have suggested that in bottomland settings, such as slope bases and floodplains, the principal environmental causes are alluviation and colluviation (see also Pyburn et al. 1998). In upland settings, including those favored by the Maya for residential settlement (Ashmore 1981a), building remains are buried pri­marily by bioturbation (Johnston 2002:5-12). (Cul­tural processes, too, can bury building remains, but they are not examined in this discussion.) During bioturbation, soil matter is vertically and horizon­tally mixed and reorganized by the burrowing activ­ities of faunal agents, including earthworms and other agents, and the lateral movement and uproot­ing of tree roots (Halek 2002; Johnson and Wat­son-Stegner 1990; Van Nest 2002; Wood and Johnson 1978). Subsurface soil matter is vertically translocated to the ground surface, which con­stantly is being buried and reformed. As an out­come, architectural remains can become buried by sinking to the bottom of the "biomantle," or the uppermost, organic-rich soil layer in which the fau­na! and floral agents of bioturbation are most active (Halek 2002; Johnson 1989, 2002; Peacock and Fant 2002; Van Nest 2002). In most areas of the

Maya Lowlands, including the Peten region of Guatemala, noncoastal Belize, and large areas of the central and southern zones of Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula, the average depth of the biomantle is about 30 to 40 cm (Johnston 2002:21-27). 
Second, what types of structure remains become buried through bioturbation, colluviation, and allu­viation, and other environmental processes? Whether a structure leaves surface traces is deter­mined by the relationship between two factors: (a) biomantle depth and (b) building height. The lat­ter I define as the height of the ruined structure in the archaeological record rather than during its use. Building height is measured from the base of a ruined structure (e.g., the bottom of its foundation stones) to its uppermost surviving architectural sur­face (e.g., the top of standing walls or collapsed construction debris). In bottomlands, where allu­vium and colluvium can be several meters deep, buried structures can include "mounds" (Ashmore 1990; Fash 1986:84-85; Sanders and Webster 1994:100-100; Webster and Gonlin 1988:185; Webster et al. 2000: 109), which I define as struc­tures that have building heights greater than 30 cm (the average biomantle depth in much of the Maya Lowlands). Most "house mounds" detected during surface survey have building heights in the 1 to 3 m range (Willey 1989:170-171). In upland set­tings, in contrast, the building type mostly likely to be buried because of bioturbation is the mini­mally mounded structure, defined as any structure whose building height is less than 30 cm (Johnston 2002). Thus, a distinction is drawn between moundedstructures, minimally mounded structures, and nonmounded structures. Nonmounded struc­tures are architectural remains that have no build­ing height because their floors were placed directly upon the ancient surface. Their archaeological sig­natures include tamped earth surfaces, nonplat­formed plaster floors, and posthole lines (Johnston 2002:35-38). Nonmounded structures and nonar­chitectural artifact scatters are distinct settlement entities. 
In upland settings where the average biomantle depth is greater than 30 cm, and in the absence of erosion or significant cultural modifications of the ground surface, most minimally mounded struc­tures eventually become completely or almost com­pletely buried through bioturbation. 3 To distinguish between grades of buried buildings, archaeologists 

may find it useful to describe building remains in terms of their protrusion characteristics. "Protru­sion" describes the degree to which building remains protrude above the modem surface and thus are visible during surface survey (Johnston 2002: 12-17). Protrusive remains have building heights that are greater than biomantle depth. In the archaeological record, they are represented by prominent surface remains that can be detected without difficulty during surface survey. Minimally protrusive remains protrude above the surface but : only slightly. In the archaeological record, they often are represented by lines of foundation stones, the uppermost surfaces of which are flush with or protrude a centimeter or two above the surface. Nonprotrusive remains are buried (invisible), leave no surface traces, and so cannot be detected dur­
ing surface survey. 

Also useful is the terminological distinction between invisible sites and invisible structures. Invisible sites are composed entirely of buried architectural and nonarchitectural remains. Invisi­ble structures, in contrast, may be isolated (distant from other sites, whether visible or invisible) or they may be components of sites otherwise represented by mounded and visible remains. Following a sug­gestion by David Webster (personal communica­tion 1994), I draw a distinction between (a) isolated invisible structures that are distant from mounded sites detected during surface survey and (b) invis­ible structures that are part of the mounded sites detected during surface survey. The former are invisible structures; the latter are proximate invis­ible structures, or components of surface-visible patio groups.4 
Proximate invisible structures pose few method­ological challenges to archaeologists' attempts to estimate target parameters (e.g., population trends) from survey data. To obtain representative samples of proximate invisible remains, the archaeologist simply excavates test pits along the margins of sur­face-visible architectural groups. Furthermore, the discovery of proximate invisible structures is not likely to dramatically affect population estimates because archaeologists generally generate those estimates from counts of whole sites (or clusters of associated buildings) rather than counts of the indi­vidual buildings of which those sites consist. In con­trast, invisible structures and the invisible sites to which they belong present archaeologists with a

formidable methodological challenge. Because potentially they could be anywhere on the land­scape their discovery is likely to be difficult. When archaeologists refer to the problem of invisible set­tlement, generally they have in mind the problem of invisible sites rather than proximate invisible structures. 
Third, how many invisible structures are present in the Maya Lowlands? Ancient residential settle­ment is located predominantly in upland settings, where the average biomantle depth is 30 to 40 cm. The remains most likely to be buried in upland set­tings are those that are minimally mounded. In these settings, are nonprotrusive minimally mounded structures a component of the Maya set­tlement system, and if so, are they abundant? That at least some "invisible" minimally mounded struc­tures are present is indicated by archaeologists' dis­covery and excavation of more than 77 of them at I 0 sites (Table 1).5 Of these, 68 percent (n :?: 53) were nonprotrusive when discovered and 32 per­cent (n:?: 25) were minimally protrusive (Table 1). Whether nonprotrusive minimally mounded struc­tures are abundant in regions where the biomantle depth on average exceeds 30 cm is not known. What archaeologists do know is that in well-sur­veyed regions where the average biomantle depth is less than 30 cm, minimally mounded structures constitute approximately 30 percent of all rural set­tlement (Johnston 2002:49-55). This is the case at Dzibilchaltun and Komchen, in Mexico's northern Yucatan Peninsula, where the average soil depth to bedrock is only 10 cm (Ringle and Andrews 1988:173), and in the Copan Valley, where slope topsoil depths have been reduced by modem and ancient erosion (Abrams and Rue 1988:378; Gonlin 1993; Sanders and Webster 1994; Webster et al. 1992:196, 198; Webster and Freter 1990:38; Wil­ley and Leventhal 1979:79). 6 Are buried minimally mounded structures comparably plentiful in regions with deeper biomantles? This remains to be deter­mined. Also unknown is whether invisible struc­tures are present in all the diverse environmental zones that comprise the Maya Lowlands (Dunning et al. 1998) and whether such structures were occu­pied during all periods of Maya prehistory (see Ringle and Andrews 1988: 172). 
Fourth, in profile and in plan view, what is the appearance of invisible structures? Given that recognition in archaeology often presupposes familiarity (Gibbon 1990:6), will archaeologists recognize invisible structures when they uncover them during excavations? I suspect that in the past archaeologists have dug test pits through invisible structures without recognizing them. This failure to recognize invisible structures occurs because in profile many look like noncultural pebble or lime­stone marl lenses (see below). What, then, are the primary architectural forms, features, and tech­niques of construction of invisible structures, and does their architecture differ significantly from that of surface-visible mounds? 

Archaeologists might be able to answer the fourth question by examining the 77 "invisible" minimally mounded structures listed in Table 1 if all were well documented, but many are not. For example, archaeologists have published pho­tographs of invisible structures excavated at Santa Rita Corozal (D. Chase 1981 :33), Cuello (Gerhardt and Hammond 199l:Figures 5.1, 5.4-5.7, 5.9, 5.10), Nohmul (Hammond et al. 1988a:Figure 11; Hammond et al. 1988b:Figures 4, 7, 8), Caye Coco (Masson 1999:Figure 5), Pulltrouser Swamp (Har­rison and Fry 2000:Figure 13), and Tikal (Harri­son 1999: 115), but the literature contains few detailed descriptions of their architecture. The Tikal (Bronson 1968; Day 1964) and Pull trouser Swamp (McQuarie 1990) invisible settlement finds are among the most important in the Maya Lowlands but they are not yet published.7 In some publica­tions, descriptions of invisible structure finds are brief or cursory (see Table 1). What might be described as an underdocumentation of invisible finds generally can be attributed to a necessary pri­oritization. On only a few projects has the search for invisible settlement been a primary (as opposed to a secondary or even a tertiary) research objec­tive, and this priority is reflected in the allocation of space in project publications. 
There are several important exceptions. Ger­hardt and Hammond (1991 :Table 5.1) list the dimensions and provide photographs of nine min­imally mounded structures unearthed at the base of a deep trench excavated through monumental architecture at Cuello. Wilk and Wilhite (1991) provide a detailed description of subsurface arti­fact scatters sampled in test pit operations at Cuello that they hypothesize constitute evidence of invis­ible residential settlement.

ments two invisible structures (T61 and Feature 32) and several nonmounded plaster floors dis­covered at Nohmul during her ambitious and ground-breaking subsurface settlement study. Non­protrusive minimally mounded structures exca­vated at Cerros, Belize (Cliff 1982, 1986, 1988) and in the Copan Valley (Gonlin 1993; Webster et al. 2000; Webster and Gonlin 1988) are exceptionally well documented. 
To address the fourth question, archaeologists must examine the architecture of invisible struc­tures that have been completely exposed through excavations. Of the more than 77 "invisible" min­imally mounded structures excavated in regions where the average biomantle depth exceeds 30 cm (Table 1), only 44 percent (n = 34) were intact and completely exposed. The other 36 percent (n  28) were either structure fragments that archaeologists exposed completely or they were intact structures that archaeologists only partly exposed.8 
Several related issues are pertinent to the fourth question. The seven invisible structures unearthed at Copan are proximate invisible structures (invis­ible outliers of otherwise mounded groups) rather than invisible components of completely invisible sites. Are isolated invisible structures and the invis­ible buildings that comprise invisible sites archi­tecturally similar to proximate invisible structures, or are these forms architecturally distinct? The more than 20 minimally mounded structures exca­vated at Tayasal (A. Chase 1983, 1985, 1990) and Santa Rita Corozal (D. Chase 1981, 1990; Chase and Chase 1986, 1988) are minimally protrusive (visible) rather than nonprotrusive (invisible) remains.9 Do nonprotrusive and minimally protru­sive structures resemble one another architecturally, or should they be classified as distinct architectural forms? To answer these questions archaeologists must compare the architectural forms and features of proximate invisible structures, minimally pro­trusive structures, and the invisible structures that comprise invisible sites. The sample of intact, com­pletely excavated, and well-documented structures that are both nonprotrusive and not proximate invis­ible structures is small. Archaeologists' under­standing of Maya invisible settlement will advance only when more structures with these attributes are exposed and documented. 
The fifth question examines structure function: Are all invisible structures houses, or are some of them facilities where the Maya engaged in non­residential activities, including activities not rep­resented by visible remains? Might some invisible structures be the remains of drying racks, animal pens, storage facilities, sweatbaths, shrines, field huts, or specialized production, exchange, or resource extraction locales? To determine a struc­ture's function archaeologists must analyze its architecture and artifact assemblage. In the Maya Lowlands, nonarchitectural evidence of residential remains can include (but is not limited to) the pres­ence of middens (defined by artifacts that reflect specific ranges of economic activities), hearths, and burials. Because of the organization of refuse dis­posal in residential sites, the strongest artifactual evidence of residential function often is recovered from the structure's houseyard area (Deal 1985; Hayden and Cannon 1983; Killion 1992; Lightfoot 1994 ). Thus, to establish structure function archae­ologists ideally should excavate both the structure and its toft area (Johnston and Gonlin 1998). 

Although all of the 77 structures listed in Table 1 have been identified as houses, the number whose functions have been established on the grounds of well-documented artifact and architectural analy­ses is small. Invisible structures and their toft areas have been excavated at Cerros, Copan, Dos Pilas, and Tikal. However, the Tikal data remain unpub­lished, as do reportedly detailed analyses of the Pulltrouser Swamp artifact assemblages (see Walling 1993:183). From publications it is difficult to determine whether archaeologists excavated toft areas at Caye Coco (Masson 1999), Santa Rita Corozal (D. Chase 1981, 1990; Chase and Chase 1986, 1988), and Tayasal (A. Chase 1983, 1985, 1990), and at these sites there are few published descriptions of invisible structure artifact assem­blages. At Nohmul (Feature 32 [Hammond et al. 1987:105]) and Cuello (Gerhardt and Hammond 1991 ), archaeologists excavated extramural sur­faces adjacent to invisible structures and recovered from them artifact assemblages, but it is not clear whether these assemblages are intact and in situ. Sometime after the Nohmul structure was aban­doned builders demolished its remains and buried them beneath a ballcourt (Hammond et al. 1987:105-106).

1991). If during their demolition or during subse­quent construction these invisible structures and the spaces that surround them were disturbed, then the artifact assemblages recovered from their sur­faces would be disturbed, too, in which case archae­ologists would not be able to confidently draw inferences from them about structure function. Finally, at Copan, archaeologists recovered defin­itive artifactual evidence for the residential func­tion of invisible structures. But because these were proximate invisible structures, the settlement unit to which residential function can be assigned is the mounded patio group, of which the proximate invis­ible structures are simply outliers (Webster et al. 2000:Table 7-2). Under-represented in the literature are detailed, well-documented analyses of artifact assemblages, from which archaeologists can confi­dently and independently establish the functions of some previously excavated invisible structures. 
This paper addresses the fourth and fifth research questions. It asks, what are (a) the primary architectural attributes and (b) the probable func­tions (as established through analyses of artifact assemblages and other features) of the invisible structures unearthed at Itzan? Together with data from other sites, the Itzan data contribute to the development of a database of invisible settlement finds, from which archaeologists will be able to determine what range of variation in architectural forms, artifact assemblages, and functions is typi­cal of Maya invisible structures. 
The Itzan Invisible Structures 

Once the capital of a small, independent polity (Mathews 1991), Itzan lies in the southwestern cor­ner of the Department of Peten, Guatemala, approx­imately 13 km northeast of Altar de Sacrificios, 47 km west of Seibal, and 6 km north of the Rio de la Pasion (Figure 1). The site first was investigated by a Harvard University reconnaissance team in 1960 (Tourtellot et al. 1978), and since 1988 has been a focus of settlement research by the author (John­ston 1994, 1996, 2002; Johnston et al. 1992; John­ston and Gonlin 1998; Johnston and Martinez 1999; Johnston and Roman 1992). 
The earliest detected occupation at Itzan dates to the Middle Preclassic period (ca. 500 B.C.), and occupation continued without interruption into the Terminal Classic period 10 (Mathews and Willey 1991), when the site was abandoned (Johnston 1994 ). The ceremonial center-a collection of tem­ples, one large palace, several plazas, and 35 inscribed and plain stone monuments-sits atop the crest of a lengthy limestone escarpment, which, like most escarpments in the Pasion drainage, has a NW-SE strike (Figure 2). The ceremonial center overlooks an extensive lagoon and marsh system, several hundred meters to the east, which drains into the Rio de la Pasion through an arroyo. 

In 1988 a prospecting company preparing to drill for oil several kilometers south of Itzan con­structed a road that cuts through the center of ancient settlement for a distance of approximately 20 km. Engineers prepared the road by bulldozing a wide trench to bedrock. Maya farmers cut back the forest on either side of the road for a distance of 100 to 200 m. For archaeologists, the road con­stituted a great trench and the cleared strip a mas­sive survey line cut through the rainforest. 
While the road was being constructed, I walked its length south of the Itzan ceremonial center, searching soil profiles for buried archaeological materials. At several locations I observed what appeared to be flat, minimally mounded floors cov­ered and surrounded by a thin layer of Classic period artifacts. Adjacent to or cutting through sev­eral of these floors were trash-filled pits. All were several kilometers south of the Itzan ceremonial center in what would have been the site's rural periphery. None were associated with mounded architectural remains or left visible surface traces. 
In 1990 and 1998, I excavated the structures exposed in roadside soil profiles with two objec­tives in mind: (1) to determine the layout and con­struction style of the buried structures, and (2) to determine each structure's function from the arti­fact assemblage recovered from its toft area. The three roadside sites excavated in 1990 are desig­nated IT3A, IT3B, and IT4A (in Figure 2 they are designated Op. [Operation] 3, Op. 4, and Op. 5), and all were located in recently fallowed agricul­tural fields. IT5A is a minimally mounded group discovered in 1998 during the surface survey of a field recently denuded of vegetation by farmers.

pendicular to and intersects the Itzan escarpment 
(Figure 3). My attention initially was directed to 
the site by a subsurface pit, whose dark soil, quad­
rangular shape, and contents of sherds, flakes, and 
carbon were clearly visible in the roadside profile 
against a background of light-colored clay. Scat­
tered on either side of the pit (the top of which lay 
24 cm beneath the surface) was abundant Classic 
period cultural debris. The nearest mounded 
remains lie approximately 200 m to the east. 
In an excavated area of 142 m2 we exposed one 
minimally mounded patio group composed of three 
structures that flank a central patio (Figure 4). In 
contrast to most archaeologically known patio 
groups, wherein an elevated basal platform supports 
the central patio and surrounding structures, the 

IT4A patio group lacks a basal platform and so has 
no appreciable elevation. The Maya built the cen­tral patio and its flanking structures directly atop the ancient ground surface. 
Before excavating the site, we sectioned a 32-m length of the roadside profile. The structures were visible in the profile as thin, level lenses of small densely packed stones littered with ceramics, lithics, and groundstone fragments (Figure 5).Prior to exca­vation, we cleared the site area of all vegetation except low grasses, swept it clean, and inspected the surface. We observed no architectural or artifactual evidence of the underlying buildings. 
The road that revealed the patio group severely damaged it (Figure 4 ), partially destroying its north and south structures, and removing both the west structure, if one ever existed, and the western half of the patio. Only the east structure was undisturbed. The east structure is a small minimally mounded platform, the interior floor of which originally was elevated 10 cm above the surrounding ground sur­face (Table 2). The Maya buiit the platform by pack­ing soil and limestone pebbles and cobbles inside a one-course, square retaining wall of rough lime­stone blocks. That platform supports a small room, 

2.6 by 2.4 m, elevated 20 cm above the surface. An infant of undetermined sex (Wright 1994:429) was interred beneath the floor (Table 3). The north struc­ture rises in three steps to a floor once elevated 20 cm above the surrounding surface. The size and configuration of the south structure, which was only 
partially excavated, could not be determined. 
At the center of the structures are single-course lines of limestone blocks that mark the north, south, and east edges of the central patio. Retained within this wall is a densely packed flat pavement of stones, soil, and artifacts. In mounded patio groups, the patio's edge is marked by the walls of the build­ings that surround it and by the upper edges of the basal platform. In patio groups lacking basal plat­forms, such as this one, the patio edge is marked schematically by lines of stones. IT4A, with its central patio and three flanking structures, repli­cates all the basic structural attributes of patio

groups except that it has no basal platform. For the Maya, the patio group served as a basic residential template (Ashmore 198lb) and, as the ltzan data indicate, they produced it in both mounded and minimally mounded forms. 
Excavations south of the central patio revealed a cluster of six to eight large fragments of broken Tinaja Red and Encanto Striated jars, all of which had been placed inside the broken lower half of a large storage jar (Figure 4). Sandwiched between the nested vessels were ashy layers of debris con­taining burned bones, shell fragments, and clay­a practice that recalls the modem Maya use of broken ceramic vessels for ash storage (Hayden and Cannon 1983:132) and as ash-mixing containers (Deal and Hagstrum 1995:114). We interpret this deposit as evidence of provisional discard and reuse behavior (Deal 1985; Deal and Hagstrum 1995). 
Four m south of the jar fragments, and sur­rounded by a pavement of stones and cobbles, is a spring-fed well that had a lengthy history of use, maintenance, and repair (Johnston 2004). During the Late Classic period, occupants of the site lined the sides and base of the well with a protective sleeve of clay, into which they pressed limestone pebbles. This created a shaft-like cavity 70 cm wide and 60 cm deep, into which water flowed from an underlying spring. Judging from its ceramic con­tents below 90 cm, the well also had been used nine or ten centuries earlier, during the Late Preclassic and Protoclassic 1 periods (ca. 300 B.C. to A.D. 150). From 90 to 190 cm, the well cavity decreases to a width of 20 cm, below which it penetrates bedrock, expands to a larger chamber, and contin­ues an unknown distance to the east. The nearby jar fragments presumably are the remains of ves­sels used by the sites' occupants to store water drawn from the well. 

Operation JT3 
The road that cuts through IT4A divides Operation IT3, located 400 m north of IT4A, into two sub­operations, designated A-located east of the road-and B-located west of the road (Figure 6).

The IT3A site consists of a fragmentary non­protrusive minimally mounded structure (Figure 7), of which only the southeast comer and sections of the south and east foundation walls are intact. Road building equipment destroyed the remainder of the structure. Constructed of rectangular lime­stone blocks, the building's wall fragments are one to two courses high, more than 3 m long, and retain a marl and soil fill that once elevated its floor l0 to 
15 cm above the surrounding surface. 
Overlaying but stratigraphically distinct from the structure's foundation stones and floor was an amorphously shaped pavement of dense, pebble-embedded clay that continued beyond the founda­tion stones for as much as 1.85 m. Judging from its appearance, this pavement is the remains of a slumped adobe or wattle-and-daub wall brace. Prob­ably the brace rose about 50 cm and supported walls of sticks, planks, or other perishable material. 

Horizontal excavations exposed 162 m2 of space, more than 90 percent of which lies in the toft area immediately east of the structure. From several meters to approximately 14 m east of the structure, the houseyard is blanketed with sheet midden, or a thin debris of artifacts probably dis­tributed by broadcast scattering (Killion 1992;

The 51-cm-deep pit contained the fragmentary skeleton of an unsexed adult (Wright 1994:429) buried in a flexed position on its right side. The nearby Burial 11 was similarly disposed: an adult female (Wright 1994:429) lay on her right side in a pit dug into bedrock.

poorly preserved remains of one or two femurs and tibia, whose positioning suggests that at the time of burial the legs were intact but separated from the torso. No osteological evidence was found of a torso or arms. Evidently this fragmentary adult male was buried in a dismembered or partially defleshed state. The distinctive treatment of the burial may recall the ritualized curation of skele­tons at Caracol (Chase and Chase 1996) and Tikal (McAnany 1995:47-48). 
Archaeologists discovered the IT3B buried structure while excavating randomly placed test pits 40 m west of IT3A (Figure 6). After uncover­ing a comer of the buried structure, the overlying surface was cleared of vegetation and inspected for artifacts and evidence of architecture. None were observed. Excavations exposed a square, com­pletely buried minimally mounded building plat­form (Figure 9) that in form, layout, and construc­tion style closely resembles the IT4A and IT3A structures. A foundation wall one stone high and wide retained a cobble and soil fill that elevated the floor 10 cm. So low is the structure that a thin over­lying stratum of topsoil rendered it invisible prior to excavation (Figure 10). A gap in the west wall marks the doorway, west of which are two circu­lar concentrations of stones, each heaped around the mouth of a shallow posthole, which probably supported an exterior roof or ramada over a porch or work area. This suggests that the structure may be the easternmost component of a buried patio group, the remainder of which has yet to be exca­vated.

rich inventory of ceramic bowl, plate, and jar frag­ments, chert hammerstones, cores, bifaces, and debitage, and mano and metate fragments (Tables 4, 5, and 6). IT3B, like IT3A, dates to the Late Clas­sic period, ca. A.D. 600 to 800. 
Operation IT5A 
Site IT5A consists of three minimally mounded structures, discovered while surveying a recently burned agricultural field to determine whether min­imally protrusive building remains can be detected in high-visibility (vegetation-free) environments. The site is located approximately 400 m southwest of the ltzan ceremonial center (Figure 2). 
The three IT5A structures are minimally pro­trusive and minimally mounded. At the time of dis­covery, the ground was completely denuded of vegetation, and each structure was revealed by a short length of rectangular limestone blocks-each a section of foundation wall-the tops of which were elevated no more than a centimeter or two above the surface. Ten days later when we returned to the site area we found it difficult to relocate the structures because they had been obscured by the growth of about one inch of grass. As we discov­ered, even small amounts of vegetation can render the surface remains of minimally protrusive struc­tures invisible. Figure 11 shows Structures 1, 2, and 3 of IT5A before and after excavation. 
Because of time constraints, we did not exca­vate the IT5A toft areas, nor did we trench the structures for subfloor burials. Although some of the structures' foundation stones left surface traces, most were buried beneath 10 to 15 cm of soil. The construction style of the IT5A structures resem­bles that of IT3A, IT3B, and IT4A except that the IT5A structures are larger (Table 2). Each has a single-course foundation wall of rough limestone blocks, and the floors of Structures 1 and 3 are composed of packed soil, marl, and pebbles. Struc­ture 2 has a limestone slab floor and a function­ally distinctive artifact assemblage that includes metate fragments, mano fragments, complete fig­urines, figurine molds, and numerous chert bifaces. Structure 2 may have served as a specialized activ­ity area for processing and manufacturing tasks. As indicated by chronologically diagnostic ceram­ics-including Cameron Incised, Toro Gouged­Incised, and Fine Orange (Table 6)-IT5A was occupied during the Terminal Classic period, dated at Petexbatun area sites from A.D. 830 to 950 (Foias 1996). 
The Function of the Itzan Invisible Structures 
As settlement studies in the Maya Lowlands and elsewhere have demonstrated (Berman 1994:29-32; Brown and Sheets 2000; Haviland 1963, 1968, 1970:190, 1985; Inomata et al. 2002; Sheets et al. 1990; Stenholm 1979; Tourtellot 1983, 1988:247-267; Wauchope 1938; Webster et al. 1997; Wilk and Rathje 1982), houses can be dis­tinguished from nonresidential buildings on the basis of their artifact assemblages and architectural features. In this discussion the term "house" refers not only to a dormitory, or sleeping structure, but to the entire architectural unit (e.g., patio group) to which the dormitory belongs. Seven lines of evi­dence suggest that the ltzan minimally mounded invisible structures are house remains: (1) their patio group form, (2) their commodious size, (3) the presence of middens, (4) the composition of their ceramic assemblages, (5) the composition of their lithics assemblages, (6) evidence of cooking and eating, and (7) the presence of subfloor and extra-mural burials in which both sexes and sev­eral age groups are represented. 
Patio Group Form and Commodious Size 
Sites IT4A, IT5A, and perhaps IT3B are patio groups that differ from those detected during sur­face survey primarily in the respect that they are not supported by basal platforms. As settlement analyses demonstrate, the patio group is the most common ancient Maya residential form (Ashmore 198lb:48-50;Bullard 1960:359; Willey 1989). The patio group form continues in some modem Maya communities (Wilk 1990:39; Wisdom 1960:119), where families occupy several residential struc­tures clustered around a central courtyard. 
Also consistent with residential function is the roofed floor space of the Itzan structures (Table 7). Ashmore (1981b:47) proposes that for a Maya struc­ture to qualify as a "minimum residential unit" -the smallest architectural unit identifiable as a dwelling­it must have at least 20 m2 of roofed space. As is the case with the Rio Bee "farmsteads" that Eaton (1975) excavated, that 20 m2 roofed area can be divided among several structures that together compose a single patio group. The floor space of Itzan's invisi-

ble structures falls well within the range characteris­tic of non-elite residences at Classic period sites and in modem Maya communities (Table 7). 
Middens 
Archaeologists widely agree that one of the best indicators of domesticity is the presence near structures of middens, which contain the hard material detritus of residential production, distri­bution, and consumption activities (Boone 1987; Lightfoot 1994; Santley and Knee bone 1993; Tourtellot 1988:236-238; Wilk and Rathje 1982). Particularly diagnostic of dwellings is food prepa­ration and consumption debris (Haviland 1963:474-476; Stenholm 1979:58-62; Wauchope 1938: 117-120). To constitute evidence of resi­dential activities, middens should contain ash, burned animal bone, and a range of ceramic types appropriate for cooking, serving, and storage. 
Manos and metates (stone food-grinding imple­ments) should be present, as should stone artifacts useful for cutting, pounding, slicing, and scrap­ing and the by-products of simple tool production and maintenance (e.g., cores, hammerstones, and flakes). 
Extensive testing determined that the houseyard east of IT3A is covered with sheet midden. Origi­nally the midden may have had a ring-like shape, recalling the refuse rings that surround ancient and modern rural residences elsewhere in the Maya Lowlands (Ball and Kelsay 1992; Hayden and Can­non 1983; Killion 1992; Killion et al. 1989). Mid­dens also were exposed adjacent to the IT4A and IT3B structures. In IT5A, midden was not exposed because only the invisible structures were cleared. The ceramic and lithic contents of the Itz::in invis­ible structure middens are consistent with a domes­tic function.

The Ceramics Assemblage 
Sherds recovered from the Itzan middens were clas­sified (a) using the type-variety system (Gifford 1960; Rice 1987; Smith et al. 1960), and (b) on the grounds of physical attributes known to be diag­nostic of particular Maya vessel body forms (Foias 1996; Forsyth 1989; Sabloff 1975; Smith 1955), including rim form, orifice diameter, wall form and thickness, wall height, shoulder and neck form, and base form. All ltzan ceramics with recognizable rim, wall, shoulder, neck, and base forms were clas­sified, and the results were cross-tabulated with type-variety classifications of the same sherds (Johnston 1994:441--454, 477-489). Ceramic forms were linked to ranges of vessel uses on com­parative grounds (Hally 1986; Lesure 1998; Rice 1987:207-243; Smith 1985). 
With some (mostly chronologically based) exceptions, the same general range of ceramic types and varieties occurs in the middens of (or, in the case ofIT5A, directly atop) all four excavated struc­ture groups (Table 6). Also comparable in each group is the range of vessel forms and sizes (Table 5). The middens of all the invisible structures yielded large quantities of fragments of jars (large and medium sizes), bowls (small, medium, and large sizes), plates, dishes, vases, and griddles-a mixture of vessel forms characteristic of house­hold subsistence activities. The most numerous components of the ceramic assemblages are large jar, large bowl, and medium bowl forms, all appro­priate for the bulk storage of liquids and foods, food preparation, and cooking. Present in smaller quantities were plate, dish, and small bowl forms useful for food serving. Highly valued polychrome vessels are rare, inadequately fired, and mostly painted with poor quality pigments. One "inexpen­sive" polychrome plate decorated with a rim text of "pseudo-glyphs" -glyph-like decorations that have no phonetic, pictographic, or logographic value­probably was produced by an illiterate craftsperson. Evidently persons of modest socioeconomic means occupied the Itzan invisible structures. 
The Lithics Assemblage 
The ltzan middens also contained substantial quan­tities of chipped stone tools and some ground stone tools. The chipped stone tools are predominantly chert, a locally available material, and obsidian, an import. The middens yielded thousands of chert flakes, hundreds of obsidian prismatic blades, chert cores, and chert biface fragments, and dozens of chert hammerstones, mano fragments, and metate fragments (Table 4 ). Their inventory also included chert drills, polished greenstone axes, chert scrap­ers, chert unifaces, eccentrics, slate palettes, spin­dle whorls, and oval bifaces of the "general utility" form (Hester et al. 1991:69-72; Thompson 1991; Willey 1972:157-161). Chert flakes and debitage indicate stone tool manufacture and maintenance. Tool types and macroscopic wear patterns suggest that those who occupied the invisible structures manufactured and maintained tools useful for food preparation (including grain grinding), weaving, and agricultural practices. This mixture of stone tool types is characteristic of residences. 
Evidence of Cooking and Eating 
Although no intact hearths were unearthed (they are rare in Maya non-elite residential contexts), cooking and eating in and around the invisible struc­tures is indicated by quantities of burned and frag­mented animal bones and by the ceramic forms recovered. Species represented in the faunal inven­tory include Dasyprocta punctata (agouti), Maza americana (brocket deer), Odocoileus virginianus (white tailed deer), Canis f amiliaris (domestic dog), and Testudines (turtle).12The presence of charring on 25 percent of the turtle carapace fragments indi­cates roasting of the animal in its shell prior to eat­ing. Also abundant in middens are freshwater mollusc species, including Pomocea flagellata (a lagoon snail), Pachychilus largillierti, and an unidentified river clam. Ash lenses are interspersed through the middens. 
Burials 
Mayanists generally regard subfloor and houseyard burials as definitive evidence of residential func­tion (Haviland 1963:478-479; Tourtellot 1988:254), although there was considerable inter­site variation in Maya residential burial practices (Webster and Gonlin 1988:187). Diego de Landa describes subfloor burial as a common residential practice in sixteenth century Yucatan (Proskouri­akoff 1962: 181 ), and the practice survives in some modern Maya communities (Haviland 1963: 478--479). Although the Itzcin burial sample is small, the four IT3A and IT 4A interments meet the

requirement that domestic interments represent both sexes and all age groups. Interred individuals include an infant, a young adult female, a middle age male, and an old adult (50 years or older) male (Table 3). 
Summary 
Viewed together, the ltzan architectural and arti­factual data suggest that all or most of the ltzan invisible structures functioned as non-elite resi­dences. Their patio group form, roofed floor space, accompanying middens, inventories of ceramic and lithic artifacts diagnostic of cooking, eating, stor­age, and simple tool manufacture and maintenance activities, as well as their kitchen debris and burial assemblages are all characteristic of Maya resi­dences. 
These data are not diagnostic of nonresidential activities. There is no artifactual evidence that the structures served as specialized manufacturing locales. Indeed, the artifact assemblages of all the structures are generalized rather than specialized. While it is true that the IT4A midden yielded notably large numbers of chert cores and ham­merstones, this concentration probably reflects the comparatively large size of IT4A excavations and the fact that all over the ltzan escarpment chert cob­bles useful for chipped tool manufacture are abun­dant. At the IT4A site, knappers discarded numerous cores marred by inclusions after remov­ing only a few flakes. The large number of cores seems to reflect not large-scale household produc­tion but poor stone quality and limited knapping success. The middens did not yield artifactual evi­dence of specialized religious or ceremonial activ­ities (e.g., abundant censor fragments). 
The Itzan structures are not "field huts," defined as small structures that farmers maintain near or in their fields for situational shelter and storage (Web­ster et al. 2000:82-83). Because field huts are spe­cial purpose structures (Webster et al. [2000:83] describe them as "spatially distant extensions of the normal domestic facilities of farming households"), their artifact assemblages do not contain the full complement of artifacts expected of domestic activ­ities. At Copan, for example, field huts lack manos and metates and have very low frequencies of chert flakes and obsidian blades (Webster et al. 2000: 83 ). The ceramics and lithics recovered from the ltzan middens indicate that a full rather than a restricted range of domestic activities took place in and around the invisible structures. The Itzan structures have all the artifactual attributes of houses, and that undoubtedly was their function. 
Conclusions 
Although only a small number of invisible struc­tures (n = 8) has been unearthed at ltzan, the doc­umentation of their architecture, artifact assemblages, and probable functions constitutes a substantive contribution to the development of the burgeoning field of Maya invisible settlement stud­ies. Through comparisons of the Itzan data and data recovered at Nohmul, Santa Rita Corozal, Tayasal, Copan, Cerros, Cuello, Dos Pilas, Tikal, and other sites, several generalizations about Maya invisible structures can be proposed. These generalizations apply, on the one hand, both to the invisible struc­tures that comprise invisible sites and to proximate invisible structures, and, on the other hand, to min­imally mounded structures that are both nonpro­trusive and minimally protrusive. 
In the uplands that the Maya preferred for res­idential settlement, where the average biomantle depth is more than 30 cm, most invisible buildings are minimally mounded structures (Johnston 2002). The diagnostic architectural features that distin­guish these structures include single-course, lime­stone block foundation walls and rectangular and square floors composed of soil, pebbles, cobbles, and limestone marl that in antiquity would have been elevated 10 to 25 cm above the surrounding surface. Whether visible or invisible, minimally mounded structures did not sit atop basal platforms, and most had walls and roofs made of perishable materials. Some, including the IT3A structure, may have had low adobe or wattle-and-daub wall bases. In profile, buried minimally mounded structures often are visible as thin, fiat lenses of stones that are overlain or surrounded by artifacts. 
At least some invisible structures are house remains. At ltzan, Dos Pilas (Demarest et al. 1989: 185), Santa Rita Corozal (D. Chase 1981:30), and Tikal (Bronson 1968), nonprotrusive and min­imally protrusive minimally mounded structures are arranged in patio groups-a characteristically residential architectural form. Similarly, at Copan (Webster et al. 2000:99-109) the non protrusive and minimally protrusive minimally mounded struc-

tures are proximate invisible structures-non­mounded outliers of mounded patio groups. At Itzan, Cerros (Cliff 1988:210), Nohmul (Pyburn 1989:287-288), and Tayasal (A. Chase 1983:788), invisible structures are accompanied by subftoor and extra-mural burials. The location and age and sex distribution of the Itzan burials suggests that their occupants inhabited the invisible structures. The hearths unearthed at Nohmul, Cerros, Pull­trouser Swamp, Copan, and Tayasal also are con­sistent with domestic function. Judging from their architectural forms and artifact assemblages, all eight ltzan invisible structures were houses rather than field huts or nonresidential buildings. 
How abundant are Maya invisible structures? Were invisible houses occupied by a particularly poor or landless sector of Maya society, as Pyburn et al. (1998) and Wilk and Wilhite (1991) suggest? Are there significant spatial or chronological vari­ations in the distribution and frequency (vis-a-vis mounded structures) of invisible structures? Did some (or many) invisible structures have nonresi­dential functions? To answer these questions, archaeologists must detect, excavate, analyze, and thoroughly document the architecture and artifacts of a spatially and temporally diverse sample of invisible structures. 
What survey methods are most appropriate for detecting representative samples of structures that leave few or no surface traces? To discover invisi­ble structures archaeologists almost certainly will need to employ two complementary subsurface surveying strategies. First, they will need to sam­ple the subsurface probabilistically and intensively through the excavation of test pits or trenches. Until archaeologists become experienced at recognizing the signatures of invisible structures in soil profiles (many resemble natural pebble or marl layers), they probably should not attempt to detect such struc­tures by augering, shovel testing, coring, or exca­vating shallow holes with posthole diggers (cf. Pyburn 1987, 1989; Pyburn et al. 1998). Test pits 
and trenches provide soil profiles of the length 
needed to see and recognize invisible structures. Where on landscapes should archaeologists search for invisible settlement? Structures will be rendered invisible only where the biomantle depth is suffi­cient to ensure their burial (Johnston 2002)-for example, a depth of 30 cm where the average build­ing height of minimally mounded structures is less than 30 cm. To maximize the probability that sur­veyors will detect invisible structures, archaeolo­gists may need to develop predictive models in cooperation with geomorphologists, who can help to identify the deposits and landscape features where buried structures could be concealed (Ban­ning 2002:231). Archaeologists have previously conducted subsurface testing surveys at several Maya sites, but almost all were carried out at scales too small to yield significant results or they were nonrandom (Johnston 2002:29-30). Currently archaeologists cannot draw reliable inferences from these samples about broad (e.g., regional or pan­lowland) invisible settlement trends. 
Second, archaeologists should survey the sub­surface using geophysical prospecting techniques, including magnetometry, electrical resistivity and conductivity, and, where appropriate (e.g., in flood­plains, where soils can be deep), ground-penetrat­ing radar. Elsewhere in the world, including Europe and North America (Bawaya 2001; Carr 1982; Clark 1990; Hasek 1999), electrical resistivity­which measures the electrical resistance of soil and its contents-has been used to locate buried archi­tectural remains, including stone foundations com­parable to those of Maya invisible residences. Magnetometry is also promising as a surveying tool. Because the magnetic susceptibilities of soils and rocks are very different (Clark 1990:64-66), magnetometry instruments, including the light­weight and easily used fluxgate gradiometer, can be used to detect invisible remains that include stone building materials, such as stone foundations (Clark 1990:64-98; Doneus et al. 2001; Hasek 1999). Magnetometry is a particularly useful tool for detecting stone foundations buried close to the surface. Archaeologists should bear in mind that geophysical techniques produce the best results when used not in forests but in terrain that lacks dense stands of trees and shrubs-for example, in fields repeatedly cleared of vegetation for agricul­ture or cattle pasturing. 
Previously within the Maya region, archaeo\o­
gists have employed geophysical prospecting tech­niques only outside the lowlands-for example, in highland El Salvador (Loker 1983; Sheets 1979) and eastern Honduras (Luke and Brady 1997; Sheets 1979), where soil, geological, and ecologi­cal conditions differ from those found in the Maya Lowlands. Within the Maya Lowlands, geophysi-

cal prospecting techniques have been used to search for invisible settlement only at Chau Hiix, Belize (Sweely 1996); here the results were suggestive but not conclusive. Archaeologists have yet to deter­mine whether geophysical prospecting techniques can be used to detect Lowland Maya buried struc­tures. 
This paper discusses buried house remains only, but it is possible that these are only one component of an invisible Maya settlement universe that is large and diverse in composition. Other known components of that universe include extramural pits and hearths (Johnston 1994 ); limekilns (Abrams and Freter 1996; Johnston et al. 1989; MacKinnon and May 1990) and other specialized production facilities; extramural burials and caches (Johnston et al. 1989); garden, orchard, and agri­cultural field system features (Ball and Kelsay 1992); and water control facilities (Johnston 2003). These invisible settlement features, too, probably can be detected through geophysical prospecting and test pit excavation. 
Archaeologists do not know how many invisi­ble structures are present in the Maya Lowlands, but they do know that such structures exist and that at least some are house remains. During the last two decades, archaeologists have reached a consensus about the size, density, and composition of the ancient southern lowland population (Culbert and Rice 1990; Turner 1989, 1990; Whitmore et al. 
1990). Most agree that during the Late Classic period (ca. A.D. 600 to 800) the Maya population grew to an extraordinary size and density, and they point to reconstructed population trends to explain key aspects of the development and demise of southern Maya society, including the ninth century 
A.D. collapse that affected some but not all low­land areas. Mayanists still generate population esti­mates primarily from surface-gathered settlement data. Is a substantial segment of the ancient Maya population represented in the archaeological record by invisible residential remains? Archaeologists will not be able to answer this question until they acquire a larger, better-documented sample of invis­ible remains whose representativeness they can more accurately and reliably assess. What archae­ologists can predict is that where invisible houses are present, surface survey will produce only biased and incomplete estimates of ancient population parameters. The issue of invisible settlement is the fulcrum of population estimates, their reliability, and evaluations of the role of population dynam­ics in Classic Maya cultural development and change.

Notes 
1. 
Some archaeologists note structure densities only, rather than infer population densities from mound counts (e.g., A. Chase 1990; Ford 1990; Lucero 1999, 2001). 

2. 
For a review of estimates of Maya population under­numeration due to invisible settlement see Johnston (2002:32). 

3. 
Whether building remains become mostly or com­pletely buried is determined by four factors: (I) the height of the building remains, (2) the depth of the biomantle, (3 ) the rate and character of bioturbation, and ( 4) the amount of time passed since building construction. 

4. 
Webster (personal communication 2003) concludes that the problem of invisible structures is serious only when surveys are superficial or carried out under very sub-optimal conditions, and are not followed up by extensive testing and horizontal exposures. Each research project differs greatly in these respects. He thinks the distanllinvisible dimension is the most potentially troublesome, but not likely to cause derange­ments of large scale. 

5. 
In Table 1, ">" indicates that at these sites archaeolo­gists found at least the specified number of minimally mounded structures. Thus, the total number of invisible struc­tures unearthed by archaeologists in the Maya lowlands is greater than 77. As noted below, precise counts are difficult to establish from the literature. 

6. 
At Albion Island, Belize, Pyburn (Pyburn 1996; Pyburn et al. 1998) has detected substantial numbers of residential structures represented in the archaeological record by "rubble mounds" and "small rubble" piles (Pyburn et al. 1998:44, 47), all of which are visible. Most date to the Protoclassic and Early Classic periods, when the island was occupied, she hypothesizes, by specialized producers who cultivated crops for export. Although it is possible that many of these struc­tures are minimally mounded, infonnation on their building heights is not available, and so I do not include them in this discussion.

Access to the Tikal and Pulltrouser Swamp data, avail­able in field notes and unpublished preliminary reports, was generously provided to the author by Christopher Jones and Peter Harrison, respectively. 

8. 
All of the Cerros finds, for instance, are fragments of buildings otherwise destroyed by shoreline erosion (Cliff 


1982, 1986, 1988). 

9. The one minimally protrusive, or "line-of-stone," struc­ture at Tayasal that A. Chase (1985 :Figure 6) illustrates had a building height of 60 cm, and thus, according to my typology, constitutes a mounded rather than a minimally mounded structure. 
10. The latest hieroglyphically inscribed date at the site, 
9.19.19.16.0, or A.O. 829, recorded on Stela 6, belongs to this period (Mathews and Willey 1991). 
11. All human skeletal materials were aged and sexed by Lori Wright (1994), Texas A &M University, and Licda. Nora Lopez Olivares (1990), lnstituto de Antropologfa e Historia de Guatemala. 
12. Allfaunal remains were analyzed by Kitty Emery (1991).
