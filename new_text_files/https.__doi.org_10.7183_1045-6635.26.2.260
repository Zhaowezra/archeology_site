POTTERY VESSEL FUNCTION AND FOODWAYS 
AT EL CHORRO DE MAITA, CUBA 

Vernon James Knight and Roberto Valcarcel Rojas 
Our approach assumes that pots are tools, containers whose performance characteristics are adjusted to their primary uses. Traditional agricultural peoples generally distinguish among multiple vessel shapes that have distinct intended uses. In this article, we present a functional analysis of vessel shapes and sizes performed on a sample of 160 rim sherds from the site of El Chorro de Ma{ta, Cuba. These were assigned to 13 defined vessel shapes, most of which displayed more than one size mode based on estimated orifice diameters. The majority of specimens from El Chorro de Maita are low-profile, compos­ite-contour bowls made in medium and large size modes,followed in frequency by simple-contour bowls and plates. Late Ceramic Age peoples in the Greater Antilles are historically documented as participating in the manioc breadcake-cassa­reep-stewpot foodway common to much of the tropical lowlands of northern South America. Consequently, it should be possible to show how the container assemblage of El Chorro de Maita is adapted to the requirements of that foodway. We note that, ethnographically, the elaborate processing of bitter manioc itself to produce breadcakes as a staple food does not necessarily require pottery vessels at all. Nonetheless, common stewing as a key component of the foodway-including the production of the condiment called cassareep in the Guianas-can require several containers with potentially distinct per­formance requirements: one to collect the juice below the sleeve press, another to reduce the expressed juice to the thickened sauce over afire, and a third, the stewpot itself, adapted to simmering vegetable and meat stews. We provisionally suggest that some of the most common shape-size classes at El Chorro de Maita are suited to producing and serving stews and cas­
sareep, the traditional complement to eating manioc breadcake. 
Nuestro acercamiento asume que las alias son herramientas, recipientes cuyas caracteristicas de fabricaci6n se ajustan a sus usos primarios. Las comunidades agricultoras tradicionales generalmente distinguen entre multiples formas de vasijas que tienen usos intencionales distintos. Un analisis funcional de formas y tamafios de vasijas de ceramica Jue ejecutado usando una muestra de 160 fragmentos de hordes del sitio El Chorro de Maita, Cuba. Estas se asignaron a I 3 formas de vasijas, gran parte de las cuales muestran mas de un modo de tamafio basado en las diametros estimados para la boca. La mayoria de los especimenes de El Chorro de Maita son de perfil baJo, cuencos de contorno compuesto hechos en modos de tamafio mediano y grande, seguidos en frecuencia par cuencos de contorno simple y platos. En tanto se ha documentado hist6ricamente a la gente de la Edad Ceramica Tard{a en las Antillas Mayores coma participantes en las practicas alimentarias de! pan de yuca­cassareep-vasiJa de guiso, comun a gran parte de las tierras baJas tropicales de! norte de Suramerica, debe ser posible mostrar c6mo este conJunto de contenedores se adapta a las requisitos de esa practica alimentaria tradicional. Nosotros notamos que etnograficamente el compleJo procesamiento de la yuca amarga para producir tortas de casabe como una comida principal no necesariamente requiere de vasijas de ceramica. Sin embargo, el guisado comun, como un componente clave de la practica alimentaria, incluyendo la producci6n del condimento llamado cassareep en las Guyanas, eventualmente requiere varios reci­pientes con requisitos de funcionamiento distintos: uno para colectar el Jugo debaJo de la prensa para la yuca, otro para reducir, una vez colocado sobre el fuego, el Jugo de yuca al nivel de espesado de la salsa, y un tercero, la propia vasija de guiso, adaptada para cocer afuego lento verduras y estofado de came. Provisionalmente sugerimos que algunas de las clases de forma-tamafio mas comunes en El Chorro de Maita satisfacen los requerimientos de la producci6n y servido de guisos y

by 160 m-and its central location relative to a cluster of nearby contemporaneous settlements. The site has also produced a notable concentration of finely crafted ritual goods and body ornaments. The ceramics are assigned to the regional Banf culture by Rouse (1942) and are customarily con­sidered to be of Meillacan affiliation. Spatially, the site consists of a broad area of domestic debris surrounding a probable plaza, a space within which a syncretic cemetery was established during the early decades of Spanish dominance (Persons 2013; Valcarcel 2002, 2012; Valcarcel and Ro­driguez 2005). 
In this article we present an analysis of ceramic container forms, sizes, and performance charac­teristics from El Chorro de Maita. We do so from a foodways perspective, including a preliminary attempt to link these characteristics to Greater An­tillean foodways, as known ethnohistorically. 
The concept of foodways is a simple one, yet its potential is still underappreciated in archaeo­logical practice. It encourages the dissolution of artificial boundaries between customary practices regarding food choice, acquisition, technology, preparation, taste, and sociality, treating all these as coordinated aspects of a broader cultural do­main (Goody 1982; Welch and Scarry 1995). The concept also encourages us to work across bound­aries between analytical domains usually separated due to the specializations of archaeological prac­tice: ceramic analysis, archaeobotanical analysis, zooarchaeological analysis, and chemical residue analysis, among others. 
We assume that ceramic pots are tools (Braun 1983). Like all tools, pots are implements whose morphology, size, and performance characteristics are adjusted by their makers to intended tasks. Any given pot may have a number of different uses over the span of its existence, but the majority of its use is restricted to the specifiably narrow range of tasks for which that form was designed (Hally 1983, 1986). Pottery-using traditional hor­ticulturalists typically make and distinguish among a variety of container shape and size combinations, which are commonly given names based on their projected use (Rice 1987:278). For example, in NordenskiOld's (1920:139) compilation for north­em South America, the majority of tribes surveyed knew between three and nine pottery shapes, al­though some tribes knew considerably more. 
There are well-established procedures for re­constructing vessel shapes and sizes from archae­ological materials and, within limits, for inferring the practices for which those vessel shapes were designed (e.g., Hagstrum and Hildebrand 1990; Hally 1984, 1986). Methodologically, we agree with Hally (1986) that it is preferable to recon­struct the full range of vessel shapes that were in contemporaneous use by a community, together with the modal sizes of each and to consider what roles those shape-size classes played in the domain of foodways. Most foods are produced, prepared, and served in several steps, each potentially re­quiring containers with different performance characteristics. The size of the group being served has additional bearing on the size of the containers required to prepare and serve the food (Blitz 1993:84-85). Everyday meals might entail one set of simple, utilitarian pottery containers, while meals prepared for guests, feasts, or ritual occa­sions might entail containers that are considerably different in form, size, and decoration. It follows that, in such an analysis, one must pay attention not only to the full range of shapes and sizes pre­sent, but also to the presence and relative fre­quency of decoration. 
Because people tend to optimize the perfor­mance characteristics of their cookware for the tasks before them, full container assemblages are a direct reflection of the foodways of which they are a part. For example, pottery container assem­blages of the late Ceramic Age Greater Antilles are highly distinctive in hemispheric perspective, because they arise from a manioc breadcake-cas­sareep-stewpot domestic foodway held in common with much of northern South America (Espenshade 2000). These container assemblages could hardly be more different from those of indigenous Eastern North America, where relatively tall jars were needed for the slow boiling of maize in a hominy­pottage foodway (Hally 1986; Linton 1944). Both of these, in tum, can be easily distinguished from the maize-beans-tortilla foodway ofMesoamerica, which requires necked olla forms in which to process the maize and beans and the dish-like co­ma! for toasting tortillas (Arnold 1991; Deal 1998). We can make these generalizations because tradi­tional foodways are both widely shared and re­silient, firmly embedded in the routines of domestic life that have persisted for centuries.

A great deal of information about vessel func­tion can be recovered from potsherds (Smith 1985). In what follows, we attempt to reconstruct the matrix of pottery vessel shape classes and size modes using rim sherds from the site of El Chorro de Maita (Guarch 1994; Valcarcel 2012). We then characterize the numerically dominant classes by their performance characteristics, such as stability, effective capacity, manipulation of the contents, heat absorption efficiency, evaporation, strength, and resistance to spillage (see Hally 1986). Finally, we make preliminary suggestions as to the roles of these classes within traditional Antillean food­ways as documented in the ethnohistorical record. 
Methods 
During May of 2010, a workshop in ceramic analysis was hosted by the Central-Eastern De­partment of Archaeology, CISAT, Holguin, Cuba. A sample of indigenous pottery rim sherds from the site of El Chorro de Maita was recorded and photographed over a period of several days by workshop participants under the direction of the authors. The sample (Figure 1) was drawn from both major episodes of excavation at the site: the collections obtained by Jose M. Guarch Delmonte during 1986-1988 (Units 1-8; Guarch 1994; Guarch et al. 1987; Valcarcel 2012:92-95) and the more recent collections obtained by Valcarcel Rojas and colleagues during 2007-2009 (Units 9-18; Valcarcel 2012:125-144; Valcarcel et al. 2007, 2008). Generally, the sample derives from a variety of domestic middens surrounding the cemetery. 
Because in many cases it was not possible to differentiate Late Prehistoric (A.D. 1300-1500) from early Colonial (A.D. 1500-1550) contexts at the site, for the purposes of this study we ana­lyzed the collection as one large sample. We rec­ognize that indigenous pottery vessel function probably did change somewhat over the course

of occupation, especially due to the effects of col­
onization. Nonetheless, we made this decision to 
lump the data together in order to maximize the 
overall sample size. 

We selected rim sherds that constituted at least five percent of the original rim circumference as estimated from a template; sherds whose lips were regular enough to determine a resting position when inverted on a flat surface, revealing the orig­inal rim angle relative to the plane of the orifice; and sherds that showed enough of the vessel wall to reveal something of the vessel morphology. 
Before proceeding, we note that pottery griddle (buren) fragments are not considered in this study, only because they are not containers and not be­cause they are unimportant. Griddle fragments are found in all excavated contexts at El Chorro de Maita, and no doubt played a major role in foodways there. They have been quantified by Valcarcel (2012:Tables 8-15, 32). 
We estimated orifice diameter in two comple­mentary ways. Our preferred method used a dial indicator in the manner described by Plog ( 1985), in which a curve is calculated from three points precisely measured on the exterior rim. We also used the more common curve-fitting method (Rice 1987 :222-223) in which the sherd is visually matched to concentric circles of known diameter on a template. In cases where the two estimates diverged markedly due to irregularities, we de­ferred to the curve-fitting method as likely the more accurate of the two because of our ability to visually spot anomalies on a given rim. 
We took photographs of each rim sherd in­verted in its "resting posture," with a scale, from three standard aspects: (1) tangent to the outer profile at its tallest point on the vertical axis; (2) edge-on, revealing the thickness, and (3) frontally from the exterior side. To complement the data on thickness obtained from photography, thickness was measured with a caliper and recorded at the lip, midpoint, and bottom-most point of each sherd. Finally, a rough profile sketch of each sherd was made, and notes were taken on such things as probable vessel shape, lip form, any incised, applique, or slip decoration, temper variations, and any evidence of sooting or visible residues. We carefully inspected the photographs to ver­ify that the rims were recorded at their proper rest­ing posture and that each rim was large enough to

be assigned to a shape class. A culling of ques­tionable cases resulted in a smaller sample of 174 rims. Rim profiles were digitized and then printed out at 100 percent scale on index cards (Figure 2). 
The next step was to create a new classification by vessel shape. This was a matter of sorting the rim profiles visually according to likeness on a large table, so that the entire range of variation could be viewed simultaneously. Bearing in mind the previous vessel shape classifications for the region undertaken by Guarch ( 1972) and Aguero and Valcarcel (1994), a satisfactory sorting was obtained; the outcome is a tree-type classification of 13 shape classes (Figures 3, 4). This quantity of shape classes is comparable to the 15 recog­nized by Aguero and Valcarcel (1994) based on whole vessels in regional museum collections. Overall, we felt that 160 rim profiles fell com­fortably into one of these 13 shape classes, leaving only 14 unclassified. 
Following this classificatory exercise, his­tograms of orifice diameters were prepared for each vessel class in order to analyze the size modes in which each shape was produced. The next step in the analysis was to select one or two type specimens for each vessel shape class. In or­der to better visualize the original appearance of these, as well as to calculate their modal effective vessel capacities (Hally 1986:279), three-dimen­sional models of each type specimen were pro­duced using computer automated design (CAD) software by rotating the profile around the central axis of the vessel. Missing bases were interpolated by electronically continuing the body curvature

Vessel Shape Classes 
Characterization of the shape classes defined for this study follows the terminology used by Shep­ard (1956:224-248) and Rice (1987:213). The first level of our classification separates open bowls from the much rarer "pots." Open bowls are then divided into two main groups: those with simple contour and those with composite contour. Simple-contour bowls are then subdivided into those with unrestricted versus slightly restricted orifices, while composite-contour bowls are sim­ilarly subdivided into those with restricted versus unrestricted orifices. The resulting shape classes were given alphanumeric designations starting with Type A 1 (Figures 5-7). A summary presen­tation of the class criteria is provided in Table 1. Detailed descriptions of each class may be found in Supplemental Text 1.

common with other late Ceramic Age vessel as­semblages in the Greater Antilles. More broadly, it belongs within a pan-regional potting tradition lasting several centuries-a tradition arguably shared with many of the tropical forest tribes of northern South America. Shapes represented at El Chorro de Maita are unelaborate, utilitarian, and without much stylistic variety. The dominant ware is uniform, relatively thin, sandy, and coarsely smoothed without burnishing. Pending thin-section analysis, like Guarch before us (1972:15) we are not fully convinced that the sandy clay body is intentionally tempered. Use wear is difficult to see, due to the general sandiness and coarseness of the ware. Evidence of sooting is present but uncommon in the collection, sug­gesting that cooking vessels were more often heated over coals than subjected to open flame.2 Preliminary studies of absorbed and visible residues on sherds from El Chorro de Mafta (Re­ber 2010, 2012, 2013) have shown unusually high incidences of the biomarkers of resins. These were found on 11 out of 27 sherds analyzed, amounting to 42 percent of the sample. Although we are not prepared to interpret this phenomenon definitively, it is conceivable that Chorro potters were partici­pants in the northern South American tradition of resin-glazing utilitarian vessels (Farabee 1918:25;

Just a few container shapes dominate the as­semblage, with only slight differences between many of them (Figure 8). It is striking, in com­parative perspective, that there are no necked or collared vessels in the assemblage at all; this is also true of a number of other late Ceramic Age Cuban assemblages (e.g., Bashilov and Golenko 1992;Martinez 1997). Dwelling for the moment on what is not present shapewise, it is worth noting that the assemblage lacks at least two forms that are routinely found at contemporaneous sites in neighboring Hispaniola: the short necked jar with an outflaring rim and the water bottle or potiza (e.g., Cusick 1989; Dominguez 1991; Rouse 1941:58, 117, 140-145; Veloz 1972:132-133). We may suppose that perishable gourd containers were ordinarily used at El Chorro de Maita for water transport and drinking, as is documented for the Antillean culture area generally (Conrad et al. 2001; de Las Casas 1875:327; Fernandez de Oviedo 1851:296; Loven 1935:409) and is near­universal among the tropical forest tribes of north­ern South America (Linton 1948:27). Nor is there anything answering to the properties of a long­term storage vessel for either dry or liquid con­tents. In cross-cultural perspective, storage vessels tend to be large, thick-walled, thick-based, tall, and relatively narrow to conserve space (Hally 1986:279; Henrickson and McDonald 1983:632­633; Rice 1987:227). At El Chorro de Maita dur­ing the post-contact era, non-traditional forms mimicking Spanish wares were rarely used; Val­carcel (2012:407) describes only five such pieces from the site.3 
Returning now to what is more typical, we may describe Type Al vessels as "plates" (shallow vessels having a height-to-breadth ratio of less than .25) and Types Fl and F2 as "pots" (relatively tall, restricted vessels with simple contours and height-to-breadth ratios between .85 and 1.00), with the remainder being "open bowls." The sam­ple proportions are as follows: 9 percent plates, 3
