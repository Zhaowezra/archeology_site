tag? Does this volume need to exist when synthetic reviews are widely available in journals from Plenum Press, or from theHandbook of Middle American Indian supplements and general textbooks? 
To start with the positive: R. E. W. Adams has done a superb job editing the papers and guiding them to a con­sistent format. Each chapter follows a general chronolog­ical structure and contains useful bibliographical essays. Books from the Cambridge University Press tend to be handsome and easy to read, and this volume is no excep­tion. The maps are legible and excellent. Even the pho­tographs, in most books as murky as a Dashiell Hammett mystery, come across with good contrast and tone. My spe­cial favorite was of a younger, rakish William Sanders, lounging among the miniature tombs of Hiahuiztlan, Ver­acruz, probably giving the dead a lesson or two about cul­tural ecology. 
Two of the chapters in particular, by George Cowgill and Thomas Charlton, are exceedingly interesting, for dif­ferent reasons. Cowgill's chapter on Teotihuacan and its compeers resonates with good sense and clear writing. Charlton's is one of the best and most cogent syntheses I have read, since it navigates a novel course-importantly here, an openly interpretative one -through the difficult but rich data from Postclassic of Central Mexico. Charl­ton offers a fascinating glimpse of secondary state forma­tion and political re-crystallization against a backdrop of archaeological survey and historical exegesis. I concur with Charlton's interpretation that historical documents and archaeology are not necessarily commensurate, since both lead, in his words, to "different forms of reality" (p. 515). Anyone confronting Classic Maya inscriptions will agree that the liturgical politics of royal dynasties usually fail to elucidate quarry sites or household activities. A final honorable mention must go to Robert and Judith Zeitlin, who do a heroic job of juggling the recalcitrant evidence for the early and archaic occupation of Mesoamerica. Implicit in their discussion of MacNeish's Tehuacan sequence is a suggestion I would endorse. Why not return to the type sites of key investigations and recover infor­mation by using more recent techniques? Unfortunately, to judge from recent exchanges in journals such as Cur­rent Anthropology, restudies are not particularly welcome to those with a stake in earlier work. 
I was less taken with some of the other chapters. It seems strange, in light of SAA initiatives to embrace Latin American colleagues, that none are represented here as authors. The bibliographic essays, excepting Cowgill's and Charlton's, build on the assumption that English-lan­guage sources are in all cases preferable to Spanish ones. I know from personal experience that this is intensely irri­tating to scholars south of the Rio Grande. Adams wears his views candidly, extolling "the newer and more sophis­ticated constructions of ... Northamerican colleagues" (p. 12). The title of the volume is the Cambridge History, but history per se is only spottily discussed in the chapter by Hammond on the Maya, who were surely as historical as Anglo-Saxon England or Shang China. In Adams' intro­duction, perhaps the most overtly opinionated of chapters in the volume, he jabs at post-processualism, a "philo­sophical nihilism" "espoused by armchair archaeologists" and "rejected by most if not all field archaeologists work­ing in Mesoamerica and most investigators working in the New World" (p. 6). As Dr. Johnson would say, "and that's an end on the matter!" 
In truth, quarrels in one generation become the back­ground noise of succeeding ones. I suspect that most archaeologists of a younger generation, and quite a few of the old, would accept the proposition that all observations are situated observations. Narratives compiled in this book are inherently subjective, informed by the fact that most authors are influenced heavily by their training in the processualism and cultural ecology of the 60s and 70s. "Humanism" is something of a dirty word in this volume, needing the necessary corrective and cold-eyed vigor of "social science research" (Sheets, p. 444). Adams attacks again. Epigraphy and iconography, occasionally brilliant in his estimation, also incline to "fatuity" and "unbridled speculations" presented falsely as "original insights" (pp. 23, 25). It is perhaps inevitable that certain contributors would stress their own research or region, but Hammond's emphasis on northern Belize in discussing the Maya seems disproportionate. Nitpicking about details is tiresome, yet I cannot resist pointing out that Tikal Stela 29 does not record "the ruler's identity," only that of his father (p. 213), or that the purported ruler at Copan is U Cit Tok', not U Ci Tok' (p. 234 )-if indeed this personage is even a king. 
Would I buy this book? No. The journals mentioned before are a more supple or agile device for handling this information. Some of the chapters duplicate other treat­ments. The contribution by Marcus and Flannery is eerily similar to other works of theirs, down to the many famil­iar illustrations. Yet some of the chapters are well-deserv­ing of close study. Wait for your library to acquire this volume, and read it selectively.

first time in a paperback edition. In the last two decades, much of our understanding of the trajectory of Maya civilization has been based upon stunning developments in the translation of Maya glyphs and the genealogies of political fortune they relate. Although I have been totally enthralled by these advances, at the same time I have missed the rough-and-tumble of large-scale archaeological theories concerning the vicis­situdes of cultural development that written records often seem to smother with the dramatic details of the individ­ual lives of the rich and famous. I'm glad to say that McAnany 's archaeological insights have not been cowed. Rather than allow the details of arti­facts and architecture to take a back seat to the obvious attraction of documents, she has carefully built a book on the changing roles of local lineage groups relative to cen­tralized political powers. Amazingly, she does this based on excavations at the relatively unpretentious site of K'axob in northern Belize, a long occupied ruin totally devoid of textual records concerning kinship structures or named ancestors. There is no reliance here on the tired, but probably true, old saw of identifying status differences based on the quan­tity and "quality" of grave goods. One reason, of course, is that at K'axob, McAnany didn't find many-nothing, at least, that would be worthy of a National Geographic photographer. Instead, the author concentrates on the in situ positioning of the buried remains of"ancestors" within household compounds. She pulls off this "less is more" miracle by using the concept of"genealogy of place"-as expounded by Michel de Certeau, Colin Renfrew, Ian Morris, David Freidel, and others-to usurp the podium of elite players and build a theoretical structure to "give voice to those who lived in relationships of dependency and not just to those wield­ing power" (p.119). Stating that "our models direct our research," the foundation of her model is that household compounds, their shrines, and associated interments express a genealogy of place "that is only less explicit than the hieroglyphic texts because we lack methods to link these refurbishments to specific individuals" (p. 99). That's 
archaeological chutzpah with a sense of direction! 
When she clearly states her goal, it comes as no sur­
prise: "What I am trying to do here is to move our per­
ception of Maya society away from simple dichotomies 
of inequality, as between elites and nonelites, and to exam­
ine the specific social contexts in which asymmetrical rela­
tionships develop ... " (p. 111). In the process, she makes 
a strong argument for keeping "dirt archaeology" in Maya 
studies. To make her case, she has compiled a wide range 
of studies that focus on the contentious dynamic between 
kinship and kingship in running complex societies. It seems 
ironic that after so many others have tried-at Barton 
Ramie, at Seibal, and elsewhere-to focus on the voice­
less Maya, McAnany's arguments depend heavily on 
expounding and expanding the implications of William Haviland's work among household complexes at Tikal, home to some of the Classic 's most elite personages. This is a real tribute to Haviland's decades old reports of the data he collected and his subsequent interpretations of their meaning. But, just as much, it exemplifies the scope of the author's vision, which includes ethnography, eth­
nohistory, and myths from the Maya and from research reports that are far more afield. 
This breadth of vision leads to interesting insights aplenty. After arguing for the creation of ancestors as a social practice through key burial positions and related architectural embellishments within lineage compounds, McAnany asserts that such practices are a visible indica­tor of the enclosure of land into exclusionary tracts with inherited entitlements. From this emerges a schema for interpreting vicissitudes in the dynamic between local lin­eages and more voracious and centralized hierai:chies out to enfold them and systematically extract a portion of their resources base. Much more follows. 
For example, McAnany describes the depiction of orchard species on Pakal 's sarcophagus as an elegant metaphor, expropriated from lineages' control of land and its products, for royal inheritance and descent. With Hav­iland, she argues that since only elite compounds-not nonelite compounds-at Late Classic Tikal had ancestral shrines, by this time "kingly" centralized authorities had usurped the power of lineage organizations among their constituents. She then uses this type of material change at textless sites in Belize and elsewhere to document the struggle between local lineage authorities and more dis­tant supra-kin elites. Most interesting to me, McAnany argues that the desecration of ancestor burials was a key sociopolitical statement in the past. She notes that at the first sign of rebellion, Imperial China did not send to troops. Instead, "agents" were dispatched to destroy thefeng-sui (read "good karma") of rebel leaders by despoiling their ancestral tombs. For years, David Freidel has been inter­ested in this and other kinds of "despoiling" that took place at Maya sites at their abandonment. For the Maya, like the Chinese, the Greeks, and so many others-both today and in the past-the bad karma of breaking the link with the ancestors who own the land and protect their descendants makes sense. 
But McAnany is not through yet. Perhaps most impor­
tant to her argument for the continued value of dirt archae­
ology in the now "historic" Maya area is the future role of 
DNA testing of ancient human remains, something she 
does not mention until the end of the book. Such a devel­
opment could be the double-helix insight into giving vocal 
chords to the voiceless among the ancients. Of course, 
DNA testing will be extremely interesting in determining 
the "blood" relationships of all those rulers who so grandly 
utilized glyphs to pronounce their kin positions relative to 
their progenitors. Indeed, what Maya archaeologist would

not be excited to cross-validate the family ties of Tikal greats Curl-Snout and Stormy Sky (recorded as Curl­Snout's son) or Shield-Skull and Ah-Cacaw (recorded as Shield-Skull's son) and then further attempt to discern their biological relationships with both their allies and their enemies at other major centers, such Pacal the Great of Palenque and his recorded line of descent! In this kind of examination of royalty, the discovery of one or more inter­loper would hardly be a surprise to historians of Europe and other parts of the globe, where kinship in the inheri­tance of rulership was often extremely distant or altogether fictive. 
Exciting it is, but no more so to McAnany or this reviewer than the potential of learning about the lines of gene flow within key lineage positions among the "nonelite." Did elder sons usually take over, or was lin­eage leadership and the role of"ancestors" as fluid as that among ancient Maya royalty and many of the world's other elites. In fact, DNA is the new method McAnany seems to have in mind to give the voiceless Maya of the past vocal timbre today. But, the costs of such an endeavor aside, will the archaeological dream of comprehensive DNA testing of ancient Maya human remains ever come to pass? 
Ever mindful of the voiceless and the importance of their heritage-and, of course, of "repatriation" in the United States-McAnany closes with a message con­cerning the contemporary impact of archaeologists and their investigations. Her conclusion may seem obvious, but it is one that most archaeologists-those working in the Maya area and elsewhere-need to ponder carefully. We must recognize, she writes, "that the ancestral presence gives power, economic clout, dignity, and social identify to descendents. . . . In this light the endeavor of archae­ology ... is more of a sacralized privilege than it is a sci­entific right. And we should treat it as just that." 
For the sake of archaeology, both the Maya descendants of our revered study populations and McAnany's book on the critical role played in Maya society by ancestral remains should be given the same respect. 
Reconstructing Ancient Maya Diet. CHRISTINE D. WHITE, editor. University of Utah Press, Salt Lake City, 1999.xxviii + 260 pp., figures, tables, bibliographies, glos­sary, index. $45.00 (cloth).

This edited volume on ancient Maya diet has 12 chapters divided among three different genres of subsistence stud­ies: botanical and fauna! remains, skeletal pathology, and bone chemistry. The primary geographical focus of the arti­cles is the Southern Maya Lowlands. The chapters range from general summaries of current data through data-based case studies of one or more sites to broader-based inter­pretive syntheses using multiple lines of evidence and regional comparisons. This is a book on ancient health and nutrition as much as it is a book on ancient Maya diet, and in that sense it both complements and duplicates some con­tent in Bones of the Maya (1997, edited by Stephen L. Whit­tington and David M. Reed). 

One strength of several of the articles is that the authors include a variety of other kinds of archaeological data when assessing human skeletal pathologies; these data include settlement size, socioeconomic class, age at death, and sex, as well as information from intrasite and inter­regional comparisons. It is exciting that multiple lines of subsistence evidence are accumulating for different sub­regions of the Maya area, and that these are allowing for comparative analyses of changes in diet and the relation­ships of those changes to environmental, economic, and political degradation. It is becoming clear from these and other studies that geographically broad generalizations of chronological trends in Maya subsistence-related activi­ties misrepresent the variability in the dynamics of the Late Classic decline in population and political power in the Southern Low lands. About half of the chapters use pri­mary data from masters theses or doctoral dissertations, which suggests that more in-depth discussions of data can be obtained elsewhere by interested parties. 
The two studies based on fauna! remains are particu­larly thorough. Kitty F. Emery focuses on Postclassic vs. Colonial animal use at Lamanai and Tipu, Belize, and Leslie C. Shaw addresses social and economic aspects of Preclassic meat consumption at Colha. Particularly note­worthy in the two chapters on botanical studies are David 
L. Lenz 's comprehensive summary table of food remains recovered from sites across the Maya area and extensive bibliographical references, and ScottAtran 's detailed tables of contemporary Northern Yucatecan Maya milpa staples, intercropped plants, and palms. 
The five chapters on paleopathology examine human skeletal remains for indicators of environmental stressors as a means to assess individual nutrition and health. Marie Elaine Danforth takes a new look at the extent of stature change through time in the Southern Lowlands, and finds that there is no consistent Late Classic trend for a decline in stature until the last 500 years. David M. Glassman and James F. Garber examine land use, protein consumption, and several skeletal indicators of nutritional stress and gen­eral health off the coast of northern Belize. They conclude that except for general infectious diseases the coastal Maya from Ambergris Cay were healthier because they had a more reliable and nutritious diet than their inland con­temporaries. Ann L. Magennis's chapter on dental health at Kichpanha, Belize shows that dental caries increase markedly in frequency during the Late(ferminal Classic period, suggesting increased maize consumption, and that dental calculus increases steadily over time indicating that dietary consistency was increasingly softer and less abra-
