A RESPONSE TO THE COMMENTARY BY KAREN OLSEN BRUHNS, 
WILLIAM E. BROOKS, AND DEBORAH TRUHAN ON “ECUADORIAN 
CINNABAR AND THE PREHISPANIC TRADE IN VERMILION 
PIGMENT: VIABLE HYPOTHESIS OR RED HERRING?” 

RichardL.Burger,KrisE.Lane, and ColinA. Cooke 
Our LAQ paper concluded that cinnabar pigment found by archaeologists in northern Peru was produced at Huancavelica in south-central Peru. In contrast, Bruhns and her colleagues suggest the mines near Azogues in southern Ecuador were an important cinnabar source for prehispanic Ecuador and Peru. In their commentary, they introduce new historic and geologic information to support their view, but a critical analysis demonstrates that it does not undermine our conclusions. 
Nuestro manuscrito publicado recientemente en LAQ concluyó que el cinabrio encontrado por los arqueólogos en el norte de Perú fue producido en Huancavelica, en el centro-sur de Perú. En contraste, Bruhns y sus colegas sugieren en su comentario que las minas cercanas a Azogues, en el sur de Ecuador, eran una importante fuente de cinabrio para Ecuador y Perú prehispánicos. En su comentario, introducen nueva información histórica y geológica para apoyar su propuesta, pero un análisis crítico demuestra que sus resultados no socavan nuestras conclusiones. 
welcome this opportunity to 
respond to the comments by Karen 
Olsen Bruhns and her colleagues (2017). Our Latin American Antiquity article concluded that cinnabar pigment found by archaeologistsin northern Peruwas producedat Huancavelicainsouth-central Peru.In contrast, Bruhns and her colleagues suggest the mines near Azogues in southern Ecuador were an important cinnabar source for prehispanic Ecuador and Peru. In their commentary, they introduce newhistoric and geologicinformation to support their view, but a critical analysis demonstrates that it does not undermine our conclusions. 
In our article, we present geological and historicevidence indicatingthat cinnabar (HgS) wasneverminedintheAzogues areaandthatthe name of the town near the mines is misleading (Burger et al. 2016:25–29).The rumorthat the area is rich in cinnabar resulted from a colo­nial hoax by individuals seeking to pro.t from 
W
e 
Spanish Crown policies designed to encourage mercuryproduction. 
In 2013, Bruhns and her colleagues took advantageofabulldozer tracktostudythemines near Azogues, and in 2016 they returned to collect samplesfromthe Boquerón mine referred to in historical documents. They were unableto .nd cinnabarintheminingarea,buttheysampled sandstone at theBoquerón mine and analyzed it totestthehypothesisthatit once hostedcinnabar deposits. They found high mercury concentra­tions (11–111 ppm). Nonetheless, these results do not prove the existence of cinnabar ore. Many hydrothermal polymetallic ore deposits and their host rocks such as sandstone contain high concentrations of mercury. Indeed, some of thehighestvalues(>2,000ppmHg)are foundin theChilean Andesin rocksdevoidof signi.cant cinnabar. Documenting 10s to 100s (or even 1,000s) ppm of Hg does not provide evidence for the occurrence of a cinnabar deposit in the pastorthe present.

LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 28, No. 4, 2017 
The authorsgoontodismiss therelevanceof work done by one of us who cored lakes near Azogues, Ecuador. They fail to appreciate that cinnabar mining leftalegacyofregionalHg pol­lutionthatis recordedbylakesregardlessofpre­vailingwinddirection. Thisis becauselakecores offeranintegratedarchiveof regional pollutant deposition over years to decades. These time spans capture the mercurial nature of regional winds.Agoodexampleisthe presenceof mer­cury pollutioninElJuncoLakeintheGalápagos, which has been .ngerprinted isotopically as coming frompreindustrialmininginHuancavel­ica(Cookeet al. 2009). The absenceof mercury pollutioninthelakesnear Azoguesis interpreted as supporting our assertionthat signi.cant mer­curyminingnever occurredinthe area. 
The newly introduced historical material is no more a repudiation of our conclusions than the geological evidence. The estanco document proves nothing about mercury production. It is simplyaformal approvalby King PhilipIIofa decreeby Peru’sViceroyCondede Nievaover­turningamonopolygrant to Cuenca corregidor GilRamírez Dávalosthatgaveexclusiverights to produce mercury from his mine claims near Cuenca,andforEnrique Garcéstohavethesame rightsfor hisclaim near Huamanga(presumably Huancavelica).Both hadwonmonopoliesfrom Nieva’s predecessor that stated no one else was to work their claims or even search for other mercury deposits.Thereisnomentionof mer­cury production at either site. Both men had soughtexclusiverightsfor mining mercury,but theattemptedmonopolywas deemed prejudicial to theroyal treasury and the “public good.”This decree therefore states that anyone wishing to developmercurymines coulddosothroughout theViceroyaltyof Peruaslongastheyregistered claims and paid the tax to the Spanish Crown known as the quinto real (“royal .fth”). 
The 1799 drawing presented in Bruhns and colleagues’(2017)commentaryalsosays noth­ing of mercury production. It is a typical late-Bourbon document demonstrating that royally appointed intendantswere desperatetoraise rev­enues.Inthis case, Cuenca’sambitious intendant was José Antonio de Vallejo. The captions on thedrawingdo not saythat mercuryorcinnabar is being producedbut rather that theold mining shaftsarebeingexplored.Othersare describedas collapsed. Theimage includes cartouche draw­ingsof mines,mills,and furnaces,but theseare merely suggestive. 
In the commentary, thereisastriking absence of archaeological evidence from Ecuador that might suggest a local cinnabar source. No sci­enti.cally con.rmed cinnabar pigment has been recoveredatanyEcuadorianarchaeological site, nor has it been identi.ed on the multitude of prehispanic objects in archaeological museums and private collections in Ecuador. We never denied the possibility that geological deposits of cinnabarexistinEcuador, onlythat thereisno evidence that such deposits were ever exploited in prehispanic times. 
In contrasttothelackofevidenceforEcuador, thereisabundant informationindicatingprehis­paniccinnabar mining occurredinsouth-central Peru. Thisevidence includes recordsof cinnabar mining in lakesediment cores, colonial historical records referringtoprehispanicuseoftheHuan­cavelicamines, accountsbySpanish chroniclers about theuseof cinnabar body paintby theInca elite, and cinnabar pigment residues in burials and on precolumbian artifacts. Cinnabar from the Huancavelica mercury mining district has adistinctiveisotopicsignature, and analysisof the artifactual cinnabar in the elite burials at Pacopampa and Chongoyape (700–500 BC) and onaLambayeque goldburialmask(AD 1000– 1300) yielded results consistent with theisotopic signatureofthe Huancavelica deposits. 
Finally, Bruhns and her colleagues (2017) assert that we “mistakenlyclaim that Huancavel­ica in Peru was the only source of vermilion pigmentin prehispanic Peru.”Thisstatementis incorrect.While we argue that Huancavelicawas the “preeminent source” of cinnabar in prehis­panic Peru, at least one other source of cinnabar was exploited in late prehistoric times. As we stateinour article, “samplesofcinnabar pigment takenfromthree digging boards from thesouth coastofPeru duringthe periodofIncaexpansion (ca. AD 1430–1532) produced [isotopic] results that indicated that the objects had been adorned with cinnabar from geological sources other than the one in Huancavelica” (Burger et al. 2016:30).
