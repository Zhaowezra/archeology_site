
TIME, POWER, AND THE MAYA 
Prudence M. Rice 

Time is an abstract concept that has been examined relatively less by Americanist archaeologists as compared to Euro­peanists. The lack of consideration of time is particularly curious among Mayanists, because the Classic Maya assiduously recorded events in the lives of rulers and their kingdoms according to time's passage in multiple, precisely calibrated cal­endars. This essay examines some of the ways in which time has been conceptualized, and its political and economic roles explored, by anthropologists, sociologists, historians, and others. I apply these findings to the evolution of calendars in Mesoamerica and their function in underwriting early leadership positions, such as that of shamans or "daykeepers." I explore the role of time in structuring late ( Postclassic) Maya geopolitical organization and the possibility that such prin­ciples also guided that of the Classic Maya. Time, calendars, and particularly the movements of the sun came to be viewed as being "controlled" by Maya sacred kings, aided by their retinue of daykeepers/calendar priests. This awesome cosmo­political power led to the identification of the king with the sun and his legitimization through control of the means of social and cosmic reproduction.

hat was the power base of Classic­Wperiod (ca. A.D. 200-900) lowland Maya "divine" kings? Some assert that it was economic (agricultural production, trade, water resource management); others declare that it resided in skills in warfare, relations with ances­tors, impersonation of deities, or various other phe­nomena. I argue that the foundation of Maya kings' power and divinity was esoteric knowledge about time or, better said, Time. This is not a new idea. Maya kings have been called "rulers of time" (Miller 1986) and "embodiments of time and its passage" (Stuart 1996: 165), whose "dynasties owed their mandates to the control of time" (Edmonson 1988: 196). But because these 
metaphors have not been fully scrutinized or deployed analytically, they are little more than tit­illating tropes. 
Until very recently, time was not problematized or theorized by Americanist archaeologists, who continued to view time primarily in the context of periodization and chronology (cf. Leone 1978). This contrasted with the theorizing of time by Euro­peanists and especially British archaeologists (e.g., Bailey 1983; Bourdieu 1977:8-9; Bradley 1991; Giddens 1981; Gosden and Lock 1998; Hodder 1993; Lucas 2005; Shanks and Tilley 1987; van der LeeuwandMcGlade 1997;Williams 1998). World Archaeology devoted two issues to temporal themes: "Conceptions of Time and Ancient Soci-

ety" (vol. 25, no. 2, 1993) and "The Past in the Past: The Reuse of Ancient Monuments" (vol. 30, no. 1, 1998). In other disciplines-including anthropol­ogy (e.g., Gingrich et al. 2002), sociology, history, psychology, philosophy, etc.-time has been inves­tigated in terms of its cognition (time conscious­ness), politicization (including relations to capitalism), measurement (development of clocks), social memory, and so on (for historical overviews, see Aveni 2002; Bailey 1983; Chazan 1995; Waugh 1999; Whitrow 1988). Scholars in these fields, par­ticularly the "sociology of time," enjoy the advan­tage of consulting historical writings or living informants about time's meaning in a given society. 
For ancient societies like the Classic Maya, such direct inquiry is not possible. With few exceptions (e.g., Cohodas 1985:66; Houston et al. 2006:81-89; Miller 1986), scholars have evinced scant theoret­ical interest in time and its manipulation by the ancient Maya. This is striking, because archaeolo­gists increasingly have depended on the Mayas' own historical writings, dated by their complex cal­endars, to reconstruct their histories. Mayanist archaeologists today address time primarily as it is revealed in dynastic and architectural succession, having long ago distanced themselves from the effusive excesses of early studies of "that sym­phony of time which is the Maya calendar" by J. Eric S. Thompson (1960:1), Sylvanus G. Morley, Herbert J. Spinden, and others. Consequently, we rarely comprehend more about the meaning of time in Classic lowland Maya culture beyond the anchor­ing of key events in rulers' lives and their domains through time's passage in multiple calendars. What was it about time that inspired the Maya to labori­ous! y carve limestone monuments with 15 or more glyphs in order to temporally situate royal events? 
My answer is that, for the Maya, time not only represented cosmic order (Farriss 1987 :57 4 ), it pro­vided cosmic sanction for social order and politi­cal power. Here I move beyond generalized assertions about time and Maya rulership based on iconography and epigraphy to support this position by, first, establishing cross-cultural and cross­disciplinary contexts for the relations between time and power, and then by reviewing aspects of Clas­sic Maya rulership and political organization in relation to later Postclassic, Colonial, and ethno­graphically known descendants. I argue that a care­fully crafted illusion of "control" of time constituted the armature of an ideology of the sacred king as an embodiment of the sun, and that powerful and precise calendars and time itself were politico­ritually deployed and manipulated as instruments of power by the ruling dynasties. 
Time and Its Analysis 
"Most people relate to time much as a fish relates to water-uncritically swimming through it," com­ments Michael Kearney (1984:98). Time is diffi­cult to define succinctly; on www.dictionary.com, time as a noun has 20 listings. These, of course, are its English definitions; other languages may lack terms equivalent to our word "time." Scholars have construed time in various binary oppositions: nat­ural versus social, linear versus cyclical, sacred/pro­fane (Eliade 1987), ecological/structural (Evans-Pritchard 1940), abstract/substantial (Shanks and Tilley 1987: 128), ideational/sensate (Sorokin 1962), subjective/objective (Hall 1980), reversible/irreversible, durational/non-durational, and so on.1 
Time's conceptualization as a subject of acad­emic study is typically attributed (e.g., Bloch 1977; Gell 1996:3-14;Munn 1992)toEmileDurkheim's 
The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life 
( 1915: 10-1 1 ), in which he asserts that "We cannot conceive of time except by distinguishing its dif­ferent moments" which "are taken from social life. The divisions into days, weeks, months, years, etc. correspond to the periodical recurrence of feasts and public ceremonies." Two salient elements for Durkheim and his many intellectual descendants, sociologists as well as anthropologists (e.g., Evans­Pritchard 1940; Gell 1996; Leach 1961; Levi­Strauss 1966; Zerubavel l 982a), are that time is a social construct-an artifact-and that time becomes socially "real" in relation to recurrent rit­ual activities. 
Time Duration and Time-Reckoning: Cross­
Cultural and Cross-Disciplinary Perspectives 
"Duration" is closely related to time, although they are not synonymous (Howe 1981 :223). Dictionar­ies define duration in terms of something's exis­tence, continuance, or persistence through time, often with some sense of boundedness (e.g., the duration of a game or a performance). Perhaps first introduced into scholarly studies of time by

Durkheim (1915:441), duration can be conceptu­alized as the subjective consciousness of the flow of time, thereby opposed to social or objective (and formally partitioned) time (cf. Sorokin and Merton 1937:619). Duration also lies at the core of what is sometimes dubbed "linear" time: the perception of continuity or "on-goingness" gives time its direc­tional flow (Bloch 1977:282). Thus, extended dura­tions are often measured in nonliterate societies by generations ("generational time"; Dietler and Her­bich 1993 :252-253), age-grades or life-cycle stages (Evans-Pritchard 1940), kingly reigns, or other "processes whose cycles are roughly coterminous with the human lifespan, or with stages in the devel­opmental cycle of the domestic unit" (Gell 1996:17-1 8). 
As Leopold E. A. Howe (1981:231; emphasis added) explains, "[D]uration, the succession of events, is something the members of all societies experience although they represent it differently." In other words, although we cannot study time­consciousness and duration directly among ancient individuals or societies, we can examine how time is represented: how time's passage is reckoned, "how the intervals are obtained, the systems by which such units are counted, ... how the units are conceptualised and what images and metaphors are employed" (Howe 1981 :222; also Durkheim 1915: 10). This operationalist perspective provides a convenient avenue for exploring concepts of time and their relation to power among the ancient Maya. 
"Time-reckoning" is a critical component. It refers to various ways of "telling" time by coordi­nating an event with particular reference points (Munn 1992:102-103), which may be based on astronomical, meteorological, or cultural phenom­ena (Malinowski 1927 :204 ). Early time-reckoning was probably grounded in various natural processes-"the apparent motions of the heavenly bodies, i.e. the sun, the moon, and the most impor­tant of the fixed stars, ... the phases of the climate and the life of animals and plants" (Nilsson 1920:3)-but these are always culturally inter­preted. Time-reckoning may be discontinuous, based on "time indications," or continuous, based on a calendar. 
Time indications were likely the earliest and simplest references to time in deep antiquity (see Nilsson 1920:9; Pocock 1967:305-307). These ref­erences are typically imprecise: whether pre­dictable or unpredictable, they refer to an event(s) "of fluctuating and unequal duration" but person­ally or culturally significant. Time indications con­tinue in common use today, for example: when Dad gets (or got) home from work, when Susan gradu­ates (or graduated) from college, the time to pick peaches or harvest soybeans, or high or low tide. Millennia ago, time-indications might have refer­enced a feud or war, great blizzard, comet or eclipse, position of the Pleiades, pestilence or epidemic, vol­canic eruption, catastrophic flood, and so on: events that persist in social memory. 
Continuous time-reckoning depends on clocks and calendars, which calibrate time into equal inter­vals. A calendar is a cognitive tool, 2 a device or sys­tem for reckoning time, consisting of a hierarchy of standard and equal sequential units (in Western systems: days, weeks, months; or seconds, minutes, and hours, in the case of clocks) that are tallied and accumulated into the next larger unit. Calendars are particularly associated with calibrating the year: its beginning and ending, its divisions, and its accu­mulation into larger units (decades, centuries, and millennia, in Western calendars). They are based on or correlated with easily observable and recur­rent natural-especially astronomical-events (e.g., cycles of the sun or moon). 
Calendars provide a fundamental element of social life: a "standard temporal reference frame­work" shared throughout society (Zerubavel 1977: 868), which integrates a society's concepts of time indication, duration, and reckoning into for­mal calendrical systems. These systems, by exten­sion, can "be regarded as products of the interaction between mathematical divisions of time and sym­bolic frameworks of meaning" unique to the soci­ety (Zerubavel 1977:872). Calendars therefore reinforce the notion that time is fundamentally a cultural construct and continuous time-reckoning is explicitly social: "it is only through interaction with others that I am subject to time . ... activities are not meaningful in terms of time except insofar as other people are concerned" (Pocock 1967 :306). 
It follows, then, given the rich and deep-seated sociocultural basis of time concepts, that the tem­poral framework(s) manifest in a group's calendar constitutes a basic component of their worldview (Kearney 1984:94-106) and identity, and can be manipulated politically to buttress a sense of "us" versus "them." Examples of such manipulation in

the Western world can be seen in the temporal and ideological separation of early Christian Easter from related Jewish Passover holidays (Zerubavel 1982b) and the establishment of the short-lived French Revolutionary calendar to replace its pre­decessor (Zerubavel 1977). 
Time, Social Organization, and 
Politico-economic Power 
In analyzing the relations between time and power among the Maya, I consider time to be part of their politico-religious ideology. Ideology may be defined as "a set of interrelated ideas that provides the members of a group with a rationale for their existence" (Conrad and Demarest 1984:4), in the sense of legitimizing an existing social order by explaining its power relations (see Godelier 1978:766; Knapp 1988:137; Santos Granero 1986:660). It can also be considered, in a more strictly Marxist sense, to represent the imagined relationships or assumptions about those relation­ships between individuals and the realities of exis­tence, and the "real" relations of production (Leone 1978:26--27). An ideology based on time and its reckoning is, I argue, an important means of accu­mulating and exercising power and would have played a critical role in early (pre-Formative) soci­eties. 
For example, it is widely agreed that a society's temporal reference network is closely related to its mode of production (Bourdillon 1978:595; Evans­Pritchard 1940; Gell 1996:85, 89; Maxwell 1971:51; Smith 1996) and its level of complexity. Small hunter-gatherer bands have comparatively few social structural features (e.g., leadership or sta­tus roles) and little requirement for precise obser­vations of time to organize their activities. For them, time "has little economic value" (Movahedi 1985:388). Time indications are basically local and discontinuous, with little durational or widespread geographical impact. 
Systems of continuous time-reckoning, on the other hand, can be seen to arise out of socioeco­nomic needs. They are associated generally with more complex economic endeavors such as horti­culture: "any somewhat complicated work which has to be distributed over a prolonged period of time, and in which a number of people have to cooperate" (Malinowski 1927:203; also Sorokin and Merton 1937). In sedentary, horticulturally based, rank societies, time tends to be conceived in terms of the weather and activities associated with the economic round of the agricultural cycle (e.g., Malinowski 1927:209), and temporal con­cepts are commonly task-oriented within the sub­sistence round. Calendrical feasts "represent the agrarian year in ideal form as regular, repetitive and presided over by more or less reliable and benefi­cent gods, who must be thanked and propitiated" (Gell 1996:91). For example, the Muria Gonds in southern India (Gell 1996:88-92) are largely illit­erate but possess an elaborate ritual calendar ori­ented around first-fruits ceremonies, "life-crisis" ceremonies (naming, marriage, etc.), feasts, pro­cessions of deities, and so on. Thus the Muria "rit­ualize time in cyclical form" (Gell 1996:90). How do "socioeconomic needs" and power relations intersect in such societies? Time, power,3 author­ity, and agricultural scheduling are all linked within "the nature of the established regime of peasant pro­duction .... Exercising 'power' in the peasant milieu is equivalent to having control over time, being able ... to organize (i.e., schedule) the activities of a productive household" (Gell 1996:89). 
Extending the Marxist concern with control of the means of production, Maurice Godelier pro­poses specialization in services as one factor con­tributing to the development of internal social differentiation. In such cases, "the services ren­dered by the dominant individuals or group must have involved ... invisible realities and forces con­trolling (in the thought of these societies) the repro­duction of the universe and of life" (Godelier 1978:767; emphasis added).4They involved an ide­ology, in other words. As an example, certain shamans among the Piaroa in Venezuela's Orinoco basin accrue political power from the belief that they possess '"mystical means ofreproduction ' ­the mystical knowledge and ritual operations which are thought, symbolically and literally, to ensure the well-being and reproduction of both the social group and the natural environment" as well as the cosmos (Santos Granero 1986:658, 659). It is easy to envision time-keeping-the "service" rendered to a larger group of predicting the coming of the rains or the rise of the new moon-as falling into this category. 
Continuous time-reckoning within a formal cal­endrical system is a matter of political economy in relatively complex societies: production under con-

ditions of asymmetrical power between the pro­ducers and those for whom they labor. Large, com­plex agricultural societies have multiple social structural segments, roles, ranks or statuses, and relationships, all of which need to be coordinated to ensure efficient functioning and productivity. Typically such coordination is effectuated through a hierarchy of roles and functions manifest simul­taneously in social, economic, and political spheres. Hierarchically oriented, stratified societies thus construct more complex representations and ide­ologies of time (Bloch 1977; Gell 1996:80--81), many manifest in its actual or illusory "control" through various material representations, including clocks and calendars. Nancy Munn (1992: 109) observes that "[C]ontrol over time is not just a strat­egy of interaction; it is also a medium of hierarchic power and governance." That is, those who hold authority over the calendar of daily and seasonal economic and ritual activities of the society also hold authority over individuals' daily lives. This control extends farther, merging the daily and indi­vidual with the annual and social, leading ulti­mately "to a more comprehensive universe that entails critical values and potencies in which gov­ernance is grounded. Controlling these temporal media variously implies control over this more comprehensive order and its definition, as well as over the capacity to mediate this wider order into the fundamental social being" (Munn 1992: 109). 
More explicitly, for those at the top of the socio­politico-economic hierarchy, time is power. As Ross Hassig (2001 :7 1; emphasis added) com­mented in his study of Aztec calendars, a formal calendar is 
a means of imposing social control, whether religious or political.... Its maintainers are reli­gious or statal, and it is they who are its pri­mary beneficiaries .... In short, the calendar does not generate a temporal structure that pat­terns events, nor is it simply a temporal back­drop against which political events can be set; rather, political concerns create the calendar, manipulate it, and use it for practical pur ­poses. The calendar has been one of the most effective instruments for exercising power in human society. 
In complex, hierarchical societies,5 the past (or pasts) may be accorded considerable salience in determining courses of action by providing social charters: "collectively held, publicly expressed and ideologically charged versions of the past, which are likely to vary within the groups that form a society" (Appadurai 1981:202). In many societies the ancestors confer supreme authority on the past. In others, the landscape, particularly the built envi­ronment, animates time, social memory, and iden­tity (Bender 2002; Gosden and Lock 1998; Umberger 1987; Williams 1998). Within this land­scape, ancient temples or monuments-themselves displaying celestial orientations or hierophanies­may be the focus of ceremonial processions or pil­grimages.6 In such public settings, it is typically the role of rituals, regularly scheduled according to the rhythms of a calendar, to recall the past and cele­brate the continuities between past and present. 
Linear and Cyclical Time 
Some authors (e.g., Bloch 1977:282) assert that there are only two notions of time: linear and cycli­cal. Others (e.g., Howe 1981:231) disagree, sug­gesting that time is not either cyclical or linear; rather, a society may possess both types but each operates in different domains. Maya historian Nancy Farriss (1987:572) argues that one of the two must be subordinated to or incorporated into the other. 
Linear time is generally considered "durational time," but also sometimes historical, irreversible, secular, or profane time. It is envisioned as a con­tinuous, unidirectional, chronological line or flow from past to present to future. It is time as widely experienced from day-to-day and year-to-year, and in the modem world it is registered by clocks and calendars. 
Cyclical time, for those who do not formally observe it, can be difficult to conceptualize. How­ever, most phenomena of the natural world used for time indications and the passage of so-called lin­ear time are recurring or cyclical, such as the sea­sons and the phases of the moon. Agriculture is also cyclical in its rhythms of planting, weeding, har­vesting, and planting anew. Cycles may be defined as intervals in which events repeat in roughly the same order or as periodically recurring sequences of events. This has led to the conceptualization of cyclical time as "oscillating" (Kearney 1984:98-99) or "zig-zagging" time, a "repetition of repeated reversal" between polar opposites in

which "all past is equally past; it is simply the oppo­site of now" (Leach 1961 : 126). These notions are misleading and a better image of cyclical time is an extensile coil rather than a closed circle: a spi­ral (Hassig 2001:3) or a Slinky™ toy (Farriss 1987:572). Within a cycle, time proceeds linearly and successive cycles do not begin at the same tem­poral points; instead, they begin at the same logi­cal point (Howe 1981:231). 
Cyclical time is usually contrasted with linear time-as non-durational and ahistorical-but it is also agreed to be particularly associated with rit­ual expression and the sacred. According to Mircea Eliade (1987: 68; emphasis in original), sacred time structures rituals and festivals and is "reversible" because it is "a primordial mythical time made pre­sent." That is, rituals always take the participants back to the same point in the mythical past, which may be the beginning of time or "beyond time" in a strictly chronological sense (Eliade 1987 :69-72). They summon sacred history, a time of the gods and the ancestors and an era of mythic heroes, and they re-enact the creation and re-creation of the cosmos. Cyclical time is a '"succession of eterni­ties,' periodically recoverable during the festivals that made up the sacred calendar" (Eliade 1987:104). 
Time-Reckoning in 
Early Mesoamerican Prehistory 

"For the Maya and the rest of Mesoamerica, time is cosmic order, its cyclical patterning the coun­terforce to the randomness of evil," writes Nancy Farriss (1987 :57 4 ). How and when did such a pow­erful ideology develop and endure for several thou­sand years? I contend that it developed early in the prehistory of the area-Mexico, Guatemala, and Belize-that was later to become Mesoamerica (Rice 2007). 
The "Archaic" stage (ca. 7000-1500 B.C.) in Mesoamerica was a protracted interval in which complex processes transformed mobile, acephalous, hunting-gathering-fishing societies into sedentary villages and chiefdoms. Archaeolo­gists have reconstructed this transition in arid high­land environments in temporal terms-the "seasonality" and "scheduling" of subsistence activities-accompanied by settlement shifts between small microbands and larger macrobands (Flannery 1966; MacNeish 1972). During the dry "winter" season, small groups moved into various niches to forage for scarce foodstuffs; with the com­ing of the rains these microbands gathered in areas of plentiful food. Similar settlement shifts based on seasonal subsistence activities are known ethno­graphically (Maxwell 1971 :65-67) as well as archaeologically in other types of environments, revealing that such patterns are not unique to high­land Mexico. The periods of settlement aggrega­tion (macrobands) in late summer and fall apparently were gradually extended as tended plant foods came to be domesticated, yielding storable surpluses. Eventually these large encampments became permanent, year-round-occupied hamlets and villages. 
Analogies with hunter-gatherer groups such as the Shoshone in the Southwestern United States suggest that seasonal settlement aggregations were occasions for rituals, dances, feasting, "marriage," commemorations of ancestors, gaming, and so on. When such festivals are planned, preparations must be accommodated within regular activities and summoning people from distant locale requires that a future date must be clearly specified (Malinowski 1927:203). Thus, scheduling festivities would necessitate attention to environmental time­indications, perhaps the ripening of certain plants like maize or the length of a person's shadow, or solar events such as the late summer zenith (sun directly overhead) or later fall equinox. Whatever the mechanism, "festivals and time-reckoning are from the beginning inseparably bound" (Nilsson 1920:336). 
The increasing size and permanence of settle­ments resulted in larger, denser horticulturally based communities with more roles and relation­ships, including divisions oflabor. Insights into the role of time among Early and Middle Formative/ Preclassic-period (ca. 2000-400 B.C.) tribal and chiefdom-level societies in Mesoamerica are sug­gested by ethnographic accounts. For example, hor­ticultural societies tend to reckon time meteorologically, on the basis of seasons and the cycle of planting, weeding, and harvesting. Ritu­als are scheduled in accordance with this cycle and typically consist of propitiatory activities toward the supernaturals associated with the rains and the crops. 
Of particular interest in the relations between

time and power is the process by which individu­als or groups came to be identified with time and its manipulation and "control." It is not difficult to envision that such individuals emerged in the way Godelier (1978:767; also Sahlins 1968:12) described, having accumulated sufficient special­ized knowledge to "monopolize the means ... of reproduction of the universe." An individual or group came to serve as a "specialist"-perhaps a shaman or priest-as the scheduling of camp move­ments or crop duties came to have ever greater salience in socioeconomic life. An example (albeit one not concerned with time), concerns Piaroa spe­cialized shamans, who own the "mystical means ofreproduction": special ritual knowledge that con­fers political power (Santos Granero 1986). A time­related example comes from the Kenyah of Borneo, where a man in every village has the sole respon­sibility to determine the time for sowing. He accom­plishes this by observing the length of the sun's shadow every midday using a special tool: a notched pole as a gnomon. One notch marks the shadow's maximum length, the next its length three days after it has begun to shorten, and so on. His specialized time-reckoning service is recompensed, as he "need not cultivate rice himself, for he will receive his supplies from the other inhabitants of the village" (Nilsson 1920:318). 
Farmers, of course, do not literally need calen­dar priests to inform them when to plant and when to harvest. This they capably ascertain from their own observations of seasonal cycles, weather, and accumulated experience. What farmers do need, however, is supernatural blessing on their enter­prise, translated through human agency-that is, priestly authority-as to the most favorable day or days to carry out such activities and related rituals. 
In sum, major decisions about social and eco­nomic affairs can be based on observations of nat­ural phenomena, such as the sun's position in the sky or on the horizon, and the responsibility for making these observations can be held by a single individual or a group of individuals socially assigned such duties. These individuals may have special titles (sun priest; daykeeper) and may be full-time specialists who do not produce their own sustenance. Also, they may utilize specialized devices, not available to others, for precise astro­nomical measurements (see Smith 1996). Shamans of various sorts, whether or not daykeepers, con­trol power objects used in curing rituals or other ceremonies: the Piaroa specialist, for example, wears "beads of knowledge" on his chest, legs, and wrists (Santos Granero 1986:663). Tools for time­reckoning (or similarly specialized activities) are instruments of power, manipulable by their own­ers for political, economic, social, or ideological ends. 
It is not clear, however, if prehistoric Mesoamer­icans charged with observing the sky employed specialized instruments. Sticks, poles, or other tools of perishable materials-such as the wooden "cal­endar board" in twentieth-century Chamula, Mex­ico (Gossen 1974a) or a crossed-trapezes device (Digby 1974; associated with Teotihuacan head­dresses but also worn by Xiuhtecuhtli, the central Mexican god of fire and time; Solis 2004:28; Rice 2007:50-51)-are unlikely to have survived the millennia until archaeological recovery. Concave, ground, iron-ore mirrors in early Isthmian Mesoamerica, depicted as head or pectoral orna­ments (Carlson 1981; Heizer and Gullberg 1981), might have been somehow used in capturing the sun's rays or as equivalents to "beads of knowl­edge." As exotic prestige goods symbolizing wealth and power, these mirrors can be considered "not mere representations but actual encapsulations or embodiments of cosmological power ... [which can either] enhance social order within or energize the expansion of social-political order outward" (Helms 1993:215). 
Time and the Maya 
The foregoing cross-cultural and cross-disciplinary perspectives on time drawn from sociology, anthro­pology, and history can be applied to the lowland Maya civilization to show how they illuminate rela­tions of power during the Classic period. This dis­cussion focuses on "state views" of time, in which time and calendars were tools of Maya elites in the creation of "heroic histories," because what was recorded on surviving public monuments concerns events in the lives of rulers and their kingdoms. In the absence of time representations in domestic, non-elite contexts, it is difficult to know how ordi­nary Maya might have viewed time. Commoners were probably illiterate in terms of hieroglyphic texts (see Brown 1991; Houston and Stuart 1992), relying, in the case of calendrics and divinatory

knowledge, on local priests or day keepers for guid­ance about such esoterica. Farmers likely were pri­marily concerned with deities of nature and the agricultural cycle (Cohodas 1985 :66), maintaining the kinds of time orientations associated with non­hierarchically organized horticultural societies the world over. Time was expressed primarily from a male point of view, as Maya sculptors and callig­raphers and most (but not all) rulers were male (see Houston et al. 2006:52), and, despite great interest in gender roles among the Maya, there has been lit­tle attention to time and gender (cf. Tedlock 1992a, 2005). 
Classic Maya Calendars 
The Maya promulgated elite histories in hiero­glyphic texts inscribed on freestanding stelae and architectural slabs, and on carved or painted portable objects such as jade ornaments and pot­tery. A salient element of these records was the dat­ing of the occurrences portrayed and/or described textually, typically key events in the lives of rulers of individual sites. 
These affairs were dated by their positions in two concurrently running calendars,7 one of 365 days and one of260 days, frequently (though not always) augmented by reference to their occurrence in lunar cycles. The 260-day calendar, which archaeolo­gists call the tzalk'in ('count of days') and assumed to be the older of the two, consists of a sequence of 20 day names preceded by the numerals 1 through 13. The 365-day calendar (ja 'ab ') com­prises 18 "months" of 20 days numbered from 0 through 19 for a total of 360, plus an additional five "unlucky" days to more closely approximate the solar year (actually 365.2422 days). Each day was identified by both number and name in the 260-day calendar and number and "month" name in the 365-day calendar, as, for example, 13 Ajaw 18 Kumk' u. Only four days of the tzalk 'in could begin the annual cycle and these are anthropomorphized as "yearbearers": deities bearing the burden of time on their backs for a year-long journey. Any partic­ular day named and numbered in both calendars (such as a day 13 Ajaw 18 Kumk'u) recurred every 18,980 days (365 x 260), an interval of 52 years known as the Calendar Round. 
Both calendars were widespread throughout Mesoamerica (see Edmonson 1988) from ancient times through the twentieth century. They are typ­ically modeled by scholars as two cogged wheels of different circumferences (i.e., numbers of days, 260 vs. 365), turning together (Figure 1; but note that the Maya did not possess pivoted wheel tech­nology). These calendars represent observation and measurement of so-called cyclical time, and the names of the months and days-known from Clas­sic inscriptions and ethnographic investigation­are largely drawn from natural phenomena, including plants, animals, and weather. Each day had favorable or unfavorable auguries, deter­

minable only by trained specialists, for various activities depending on the confluence of cosmic forces governing their destinies. Because of these portents, the Calendar Round emphasized qualita­tive aspects of time (Miller 1986:24). 
Besides recognizing cyclical and qualitative time, the Classic Maya also recorded linear, dura­tional, and quantitative time through the Initial Series or Long Count (Figure 2), which dated events by tallying the number of elapsed days since an arbitrary starting point of August 11, 3114 B.C.8 In this system, days were counted in bundles, pri­marily multiples of 20 days, arranged in vertical order in inscriptions: 
B 'ak'tun = 144,000 days (20 k' atuns; -400 Gre­gorian years) 
K'atun = 7,200 days (20 tuns; -20 years) 
Tun= 360 days (18 winals; -1 year) 
Winal = 20 k'ins 
K'in = 1 day Thus an event was dated by the number of b'ak'­tuns completed since this starting date, then the number of completed k'atuns, completed tuns or "years," completed winals or "months," and finally "leftover" days (k'ins). These units were followed by glyphs representing patrons of the Lords of the Night and information about lunations. All told, an Initial series date might include 15 or more glyphs marshaled to record the synchronization of the memorialized event in the many flows of Maya time.9 
Texts often identify sequences of events, which may require specification of temporal intervals between, for example, the inauguration of a ruler and another event such as a war. These intervals are indicated in inscriptions by so-called distance numbers: the number of days to be counted back­ward or forward from another given date. Distance numbers can be considered "the most purely dura-

and the 52-year Calendar Round were widespread throughout ancient Mesoamerica, the Classic Maya took continuous time-reckoning to a different plane in the Long Count. Their concern was clearly "about" something significantly above and beyond collective needs to determine times to plant and har­vest, schedule a festival, or record a king's birth for posterity. Maya elites were acutely and reveren­tially conscious of their own history and dedicated to situating it within cosmic eternity. 

Maya Creation Myths 
The centrality of calendars and temporal cycling among the Maya is evident in their creation sto­ries.11 One well-known Maya myth of cosmogen­esis is the Popol Vuh (Christenson 2003; Tedlock 1996), the creation myth of the K'iche' Maya in highland Guatemala, which was committed to writ­ing in the Maya language, using the Latin alpha­bet, in the mid sixteenth century (Tedlock 1996:56 ). It is likely, however, that this myth was brought to the K'iche' through contacts with the lowland Maya during the Postclassic period (Tedlock 1996: 16, 46, 51, 21 ln30). The Popol Vuh, like origin myths in general, is a sacred history manifest as "part of the ceremonial calendar that mapped social rela­tions in space and time" (Gillespie 1989:209). 
I believe that the Popol Vuh was structured by time and constitutes an allegory encoding the major developments of the Mesoamerican and Maya cal­endars (Rice 2007). A key element is that the gods fashioned multiple creatures who were expected to praise them and give them offerings "according to the rhythms of a calendar" (Tedlock 1996:32). The earliest of these-pre-humans made of mud and wood, who could not speak intelligibly or keep the days of a calendar-were destroyed. The current era, dominated by humans who keep calendars and praise the gods, was born with the rising of the sun over the primordial darkness. In Godelier's (1978:767) terms, keeping the days according to a calendar exemplifies the importance of specializa­tion in services relating to "forces controlling ... the reproduction of the universe and of life." 
Early foundational stories in this myth's antecedents were probably public performances, eventually staged alongside narrative scenes carved on stelae in the plazas of major ceremonial centers such as Izapa in the Late Preclassic period (Guernsey Kappelman 2001 ; Laughton 1997; Rice 
Downloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core. YBP Library Services, on 22 Aug 2018 at 17:38:40, subject to the Cambridge Core terms of use, available at https://www.cambridge.org/core/terms. https://doi.org/10.1017/S1045663500007951 

2007). Such performances reinforced social and cosmic order through the telling and retelling of the history of the world and its creatures, and of the origins of time itself. Thus the Papal Vuh was a sacred charter underwriting cosmic order. 
Unlike Preclassic Izapa and its monuments, the Classic Maya made few public references to the creatures and events in the Po pol Vuh, including the adventures of the Hero Twins. Instead, such refer­ences are largely confined to scenes on painted pot­tery, most unprovenienced but thought to originate in tombs (Coe 1978). Other creation stories, which appear only rarely in public contexts, such as on carved monuments, mention the setting of stones and could reference calendrical creation. These stones, whether real or metaphorical, originally might have been gnomons used to aid observation. A hint comes from Yukatekan near-homophones tun and tuun, which mean "year" (of360 days) and "stone," respectively. These related senses may stretch back to the middle Late Preclassic period (Justeson and Mathews 1983:587), reinforcing a connection between stones and calendrical com­memorations 12 that dates well before the beginning of the Common Era. 
Classic Representations of Time 
Because societies experience and represent time and duration differently, time's role can begin to be understood through an examination of the ways in which it is subdivided and what constructs, images, and metaphors are used to represent time, its units, and their duration (Howe 1981 :231; Leach 1961 : 135). Such representations convey a good deal about a society's attitudes toward time and its value. For example, time can be an arrow or a river or sand; in North America, the new year is anthro­pomorphized as an infant who ages into decrepit Father Time 365 days later. Time has been com­modified and can be spent, wasted, or killed; "time is money," to quote Ben Franklin. Here I examine Maya representations of a time-based ideology: their concepts, beliefs, and values as materialized in physical form in art, artifacts, monuments, archi­tecture, ritual, and performance (see DeMarrais et al.; Santos Granero 1986:660). 
The most distinctive characteristic of Classic Maya representations of time is that temporal units were animate. Moreover, all units--days, bundles of days, and even the numbers by which they were counted-were presented in three ways: symbolic (geometric), head variant ("personified"), and full­figure. 
Numbers, in simplest, symbolic form, are depicted in a bar-dot system, in which a dot (a fin­gerprint?) stands for 1 and a bar (thumb? hand held flat?) stands for 5; a shell-like symbol stands for 0. Positional notation was used to denote ever larger counts (e.g., tuns, k'atuns, b'ak'tuns). Numbers also could be represented by head variants: the heads of the gods of those numbers, either anthro­pomorphic or zoomorphic. 
Temporal units or bundles may be shown as symbolic, head-variant (Figure 3), and full-figure (Figure 4) signs. Sometimes these seem related­for example, the symbolic form might appear as an infix in a personified head glyph-but in other cases the relationship is difficult to discern. Head-variant glyphs typically are animal heads, while the rarely seen full-figure glyphs depict anthropomorphic deities of the numbers plus a zoomorphic creature for the temporal unit. In these full-figure glyphs, almost exclusively from the southeastern sites of Copan (Honduras) and Quirigua (Guatemala), the anthropomorphic deities of the numbers are shown interacting with full-figure zoomorphic represen­tations of the temporal units, sometimes bearing them on their backs by a tumpline and other times seeming to wrestle with them. 
K'in. The word k'in means day, sun, or time. The symbolic form is a quadripartite glyph represent­ing a four-petaled flower (Figure 3e, left; Macri and Looper 2003:36, 197), but is usually taken as one of several Maya symbols meaning "completion" or "whole" in the sense of the four cardinal directions (Coggins 1980). The most common head variant of the k'in glyph is the head of the sun god, char­acterized by a squarish eye, a looped cruller-like ornament above a Roman nose, and tau-shaped incisors (Figure 3e, right; see Thompson 1960: 142, Figure 27.58-66). Other head variants are monkey­like creatures and the full-figure glyph for the k'in is either a human (sun god?) or a monkey (Thomp­son 1960:43, Figure 29.5-10). 
Winal. The winalof 20 days appears to be related to the moon, but the symbolic glyph representing this period is difficult to read (Figure 3d, left; see Thompson 1960:143, Figure 26.41-48). Head­variant and full-figure representations of the winal are signified by the head and full body, respec-

Tun. The Maya tun refers to a period of360 days

(a "year") as well as a slit drum, held horizontally in play. Its symbolic glyphic referent is a drum (Macri and Looper 2003: 190): a cartouche with two vertical black bands in the upper half and a circle in the lower half (Figure 3c, left). The same glyphic sign may refer to the 360-day year as well as to the 365-day one (ja'ab'). Zoomorphic versions show a composite creature-a supernatural bird-with an elongated beak or snout, bony mandible, and sometimes a tun grapheme in the headdress (Fig­ures 3c, right, 4c; Macri and Looper 2003:36, 153-154). Thompson (1960: 145) believes the head tufts signify the ear tufts of a screech owl, and thus the avian is the Muwan Bird of Classic iconogra­phy, sometimes identified with rain. Full-figure glyphs may depict a peculiar creature that Thomp­son identifies as a crab and at least one shows an avian; as in the head variant, the tun sign may appear as a headdress (Figure 4c; Thompson 1960:145, Figure 28.12-17). 
K'atun. The word k'atun is often thought to derive from k'al tun, meaning 20 tuns or years (Thompson 1960: 145-146), but more recent read­ings suggest that it was k' altuun 'closing stone, stone-binding' (Houston et al. 2006:81-82). The glyphic form is a tun sign with a superfix consist­ing of a day-sign, Kawak, flanked by comb-like ele­ments meaning "count" (Figure 3b, right; Thompson 1960: 146, Figure 26.24-32). The head variant depicts the head of a bird (Figure 3b, left) (Macri and Looper 2003: 153), sometimes with the kawak-comb superfix as a headdress and a human-
