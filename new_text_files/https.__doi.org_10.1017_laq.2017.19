T
he Recorrido Arqueológico de Coixt­lahuaca(RAC)systematically surveyeda key region in Mesoamerica. The settle­ment patterns that emerged shed light on prob­lems in ecological and political anthropology. Theseproblemsweresuccinctly phrasedintwo questions that citizens of Coixtlahuaca posed to usatapublic forumatthe conclusionofour 2008 pilotproject:How couldsuchalarge numberof peoplehavelived hereinthe past, when today, with a much lower population, we can barely makealiving? And,howwereall those people organized? The questions are important today becauselivingonthisspectacularly eroded land is dif.cult, and peopleare constantly confronted with the costs and bene.ts of social coopera­tion, withdrawal,or con.ict.Local communities sometimes alternate between impressive collec­tive action and paralyzingfactionalism. 
Our research was not based on the local citizens’ questions—our goal from the start was to surveytheregion. Buttheir questions coincide with more general anthropological concerns, and the problems are signi.cant academically and practically.Wemade these questions the central themeofour successful proposal to theNational ScienceFoundationfor theregional survey.The population questioninvolvesagroecosystempro­cesses that we are treating in detail, as are our colleagues the geomorphologists David Leigh andGenevieveHoldridge.Inthis articlewefocus on the question of social organization, although inevitably we refer to making a living as we addresshow peoplewereorganized. 
¿Cómoseorganizaron? ¿Cómofueron orga­nizados? Spanish and Englishsharethe ambigu­ityof the passivevoice:Howdid they organize themselves? Or, how were they organized (by someone else)? A common perspective is that theelite organize society; theyarethe generative and mostpowerfulforce.Theelite lead, establish cities, and populate them with their subjects. This is the perspective of the texts produced by Mesoamerican rulers. Nevertheless, recent studies using cooperationtheoryemphasizevari­ationindegreesof autocraticor collective action (Blanton and Fargher 2008; Carballo 2013a). Coixtlahuaca settlement archaeology and his­torical sources show that community organiza­tion existed prior to king and state, and was powerful and enduring enough to contest both. Society was a complicated dynamic of opposed strategies. 

Study Area and Chronology 
The valley of Coixtlahuaca is the upper basin of the Río Xiquila, the northernmost valley of theMixteca Alta(Figure1).Valley.oorsinthe Mixteca Alta are about 2,100masl and mountain crests rise to 2,800 m asl. The Mixteca Alta is in the geographical center of Mesoamerica and within it the Coixtlahuaca valley has the best access to the Gulf Coast lowlands. Soil and water management have been key factors in Mixteca Alta cultural ecology (Kirkby 1972; Spores 1969).Valleys have deep deposits of the Yanhuitlán and similarsedimentaryformations. Soils derived from these are fertile but noto­riously erodible, and these two characteristics have played a major part in the human history of this region. Climate is temperate and semi­arid.Althougheachvalleyhas permanentsurface water, precipitation is erratic and, on average, marginal for rainfall agriculture, which places a premium on water control. 
We selected this area becauseit wasalarge and powerful city-state in Late Postclassic times (e.g., Durán 1967:2:185–195). It had received little archaeological attention since Bernal’s impressive study (Bernal 1948–1949; Spores 2007:50–51, 470). Surveying Coixtla­huaca would further expand the approximately 9,000 km2 area of archaeological coverage extending from centralvalleysof Oaxaca through muchof theMixteca Alta (Balkansky 2006). 
In the past, the Coixtlahuaca valley was hometospeakersofChocholtec(Ngigua, Ngiwa; Huesca et al. 1984:2:3–18). Some towns also had speakers ofMixtec(vanDoesburg 2001). Today only a few people speak an indigenous language. Many tell legends about the past,but the oral history has not been compiled and studied as fully as it shouldbe(GrosserLerner 2004; Jiménez García 2000; Rincón Mautner 1999). Coixtlahuaca has an important corpus of 13 native lienzos, which are graphic represen­tations of geography and royal dynasty made in the sixteenth century. Below we juxtapose thearchaeological and historical data,but more

detailed research should be done now that the archaeology is better known. 
The ceramic chronology(Table1)ofCoixt­lahuaca valley is similar to the adjacent Nochixtlán andTamazulapanvalleys (Blomster 2004; Byland 1980; Kowalewski et al. 2009; Plunket 1983;Spores1972). Bernal carried out stratigraphic excavations at the Late Postclas­sic center in 1948–1949 and documented the ceramics. Our 2008–2011 work found evidence of MiddleFormativethrough EarlyClassic occu­pation and pottery resembling ceramics from neighboring areas in the Mixteca Alta and the ValleyofOaxaca (Casoetal.1967;Flannery and Marcus 1994). Thereare also linkstoTehuacan, 60 km to the north (MacNeish et al. 1970). 

Field and LabMethods 

The RAC survey began in 2008 at the ancient cityof Coixtlahuaca.Weused systematic surface survey,controlled collection, and multitechnique prospection, thelatter carried outbyour collabo­ratorsattheLaboratoriodeProspección, Instituto de Investigaciones Antropológicas,Universidad Nacional AutónomadeMéxico(UNAM-IIA), under thedirectionofLuísA.Barba Pingarrón. We studied the history and internal makeup of the city, mapped its limits over time, improved our understanding of the chronology, and inves­tigated residential density in 10 places. This work showed that Coixtlahuaca extended con­tinuously,withoutgaps,over3,000 ha. 
In 2009, along with the UNAM-IIA team, we focused on threeLate Postclassicresidences and carried out test excavations to evaluate the remote sensing data. These studies provided a provisional estimate of residential density of four to seven houses per hectare for the Late Postclassic city (Kowalewski et al. 2011). 
The 2011 projectwasthe full-coverage survey of the whole valley; we have described the methods elsewhere(Kowalewski et al. 2009:15– 27).Wewere abletomakeimportant improve­ments in data management in this phase by using GIS more extensively to organize infor­mation, including GPS points and tracks, col­lections, photographs, notes,features,municipal boundaries, and other data. Each three-or four-person .eld crew was responsible for data entry using a common template. In earlier regional projects, phase-by-phasesettlement pattern maps were not completed until months after .eldwork, but in 2011 we drew component boundaries within a few days of a site being mapped, updatingthe .eldinformationas ceramic collec­tions were initially classi.ed and later reviewed. Early decision on component boundariesgreatly

improves data quality.Ourexperience suggests that regional surveys should make full use of databases and GIS, concurrent with .eldwork, for all information and research products. Arti­factswere described and typedup withinafew days of their collection and reviewed several times (by SAK and LRS). We photographed everyartifact,front and back,by collection. 
For each of 18 communities, we wroteindi­vidual reports describing the objectives, meth­ods,results,signi.cance, and need forpreserva­tion, and attached maps showing site locations. Fieldcrews submittedthe reportsto communities in June 2011. 
Regional surveys are always a tense balance betweentwocompeting objectives that cannotbe maximized at the same time: covering as much area as possible and collectingmoreinformation on each site.Itistoofacile to conclude that the optimal solution depends on research objectives. In practice, research objectives do not anticipate every situation. The tension between extensive coverage and richer information does not disap­pear.Especially near the endof the .eldseason, crews had too much to do and too little time. Later we found omissions and inconsistencies that we shouldhave caught during earliererror­checking.Wehadhopedto survey1,000km2,but completed about 660 km2 due to local political dif.culties, because sites were more extensive than anticipated, and because of limitations on project resources and .exibility.The most signif­icantgapincoverageisTepelmeme, notablefor theprecolumbian paintingsinthecaveknownas the PuenteColosal (Rincón Mautner 2005;Urcid 2004). 
We collected 579 lots of artifacts at Co­ixtlahuaca in 2008. The 2011 regional survey

collected 264 lots, and many hundreds of col­lections were inspected but not taken. Because smaller collections affect chronological discern­ment, more collections are desirable, and this requiresstandardized procedures forinspecting and collecting, which should be made clear in the research plan. Crews need to know about the ceramicsatthe outset. 
Time spenton nonresearch issuesisaconcern. Project diplomacyhas becomemoredif.cult and time-consuming in Oaxaca in the last several decades,withtheweakeningof federaland state government authorities and sometimes unpre­dictable local disputes and factions. In most instances the time spent in local diplomacy is rewarding, however. We learned a lot from community members and we appreciatehaving hadthe opportunitytoworkwith them.Dealing with administrative obstacles imposed by one’s university is also dif.cult and time-consuming, but in no sense rewarding. Many of the dif.­culties just cited should be anticipated at the proposal stage and dealt with in the budget. A projectofthis complexity requiresmoreattention to managementtodaythanwasoncethe case,and this should be addressed early in the planning stage. 

SettlementPatterns overTime 

PaleoindianandArchaic(Priorto 2000BC) 
Wefoundnoevidenceof occupationinthePaleo­indian period. Pleistocene megafaunal remains areoften foundin this partofMexico,butthus far not in association with humans. Rock art (e.g., Ramírez 2014)and charcoal from a hearth dated to 3290–2920 cal BC (Rincón Mautner 1999:681–691, 694) are the only documented evidence forthe Archaic. 
EarlyFormative(2000–700 BC) 
We have only three small habitation sites (Figure2). These are onlowhillsoverlooking the valley .oor. In each case there are a few Middle Cruz sherds (ca. 1000 BC). One site wasidenti.ed onlyafter visiting colleague Marc Winter spotteda coupleofsherds onalab table. This site and another required revisits, and the third was quite disturbed, being in the middle of a present-day village. Early Formative sites aredif.culttoidentify becausediagnostics are sparse,thereis heavy later occupation, and early occupations aremore likelytobeerodedaway orburiedby sediments. 
Our geomorphological study suggests that more thanafewfarming households had settled here by 1500 BC. In a deeply incised stream bank near San Juan Bautista Coixtlahuaca, Leigh and Holdridge founda6 m high cross-channel check dam.Ten radiocarbon samples dateitto 3500–3400calBP (Leighetal. 2013).A series of dams was built to control the force of the water during storms. This implies that there was cooperation among farmers, the number dependent on the size of the stream. Perhaps people had committedtosedentismbythis early date,as MacNeishhas proposedforTehuacan,in “(linear)waterwayhamlets” near moist barranca bottoms (MacNeish et al. 1972:155–160, 499– 500). 
MiddleFormative(700–300 BC) 
TheMiddleFormativewasaperiodofexpansion (Figure2). The number of settlementsjumped to 245. Total settlement area exceeded 3,000 ha. One site alone extended continuously over 1,300 ha. Along the Río Grande de Ihuitlán, settlementcoveredlarge partsofthemunicipali­tiesofTeopan, Jicotlán,Tepetlapa, and Ihuitlán. Tequixtepec and Naduza-Ñiaxugue in Coixt­lahuaca (García Ayala 2011) were also major towns. These sites are extensive and offer dense scatters of pottery and chert debitage, with bell-shaped pits, house foundations, and residential terraces. 
Middle Formative ceramics resemble Rosario, Monte Albán Ia, and Monte Albán Ib in the Valley of Oaxaca (Caso et al. 1967; Drennan 1976) and Late Cruz (Spores 1972) and theYucuita phase(Blomster 2004)inthe Mixteca Alta.Our collections are not suf.cient in size or number to map change in settlement size by shorter phases, since many diagnostics are relatively rare, but our impression is that settlement began in the early third of the Late Cruz period andwasmostextensiveinthe late third. 
Most occupations are in open valley .oors. There are also hilltop villages, some with

The largest and best-preserved of the hilltop sites are Naduza-Ñiaxugue, Cerro La Flor at the northern edge of the region, and Tlapiltepec, where the center of the1,300ha settlementisan impressivehilltown withringsof6mhigh terracewallsontheslopes and a small civic-ceremonial precinct on top of thehill.

Radiocarbon and stratigraphic dating of check dams exposed in stream pro.les indicatethat agriculturalterracing wasextensive duringthis period.

distributed. A few are at the centers of large settlements but most are at small sites or in boundary situations on hilltops at the edges of drainages. 
Late andTerminalFormative(300 BC–AD 200) 
This period(theEarly and Late Ramos phases, coeval with Monte Albán Late I and II) saw a demographic trough(Figure3). In theLate Formative, most of the valley was abandoned, except for the town of Naduza-Ñiaxugue (more than 100 ha); Cerro La Flor, a lingering small occupation at the formerly huge settlement at Tlapiltepec; and a few small sites that were probably not occupied for very long. In the TerminalFormative, Naduza-Ñiaxugue persisted as a large town (over 180 ha), Cerro La Flor was abandoned, and therewerejustafewother smallsites. Naduza-Ñiaxugue resembles its peer Yucuita, 20 km to the south in the Nochixtlán valley(Plunket 1983). 
In sum, except for Naduza-Ñiaxugue, the Coixtlahuaca region was little occupied from about 300 BC to about AD 200. This decline wasextreme,but it seems to coincide with the militarization and population stasis or decline seen in neighboring regions in the same period. It would be dif.cult to attribute the partial abandonment of Coixtlahuaca to de.ciency in the ceramic chronology, since the same

time-sensitive styles occur in Coixtlahuaca, the centralMixteca Alta, and theValley ofOaxaca throughout theFormative.Contemporary pottery assemblages from Naduza-Ñiaxugue are equal in quality and frequency of decoration to those from theValley ofOaxaca, and many examples could serve as type illustrations in the standard work on Monte Albán ceramics (Caso et al. 1967). 
EarlyClassic(AD 200–600) 
From about AD 200, people began settling at more places in the southern part of the val­ley(Figure4).A new mountaintop townwas founded at CerroVerde. The northern halfofthe valley was only lightly and ephemerally settled, andwasprobablya political frontier. 
Weidenti.ed some surface collections asTer­minalFormative–Early ClassicTransition(Caso et al. 1967;Stiver 2001).Other collections,espe­ciallysmallones,are ambiguousandareassigned to EarlyLas Flores.Collections withTransition attributes comefromthe southernvalley,at Cerro Verde and Coixtlahuaca, so it is likely that the growth in settlement began .rst in that area. 
Cerro Verde (Nudo Mixteco) is the divide between the Paci.c-draining Ríos Balsas and Verde, and the Gulf-draining Río Papaloapan.

Settlementwasonthe peaks,ridges, and slopes eastofCerroVerde, 500maboveand2kmdistant from the valley .oor. We recorded 678 stone terrace walls, the total length of which is 31.7 km.Mostterraces were residentialbut some were built as ramps or defensive walls, for planting, or to stabilize slopes. Settlement began in the Transitionperiodandspreadtocoveramaximum of 197 ha in theEarly Classic.We identi.ed no Late ClassicorEarly Postclassic settlementsin this region. 
The distribution of civic-ceremonial archi­tecture (CCA) at Early Classic Cerro Verde is decidedly noncentralized. Modest-sized plat­form mounds occur on six different peaks and one saddle. One group has three mounds, one has two, and .vehave one. Smallplazas areat each of these groups and on two other peaks. Thetownthus looks likea collectionofbarrios, a pattern found elsewhere in the Mixteca Alta (Kowalewskiet al. 2009;Stiver 2001). 
ThetownofNaduza-Ñiaxugue continued to be densely settled and was a secondary center to CerroVerde.Foundedby700BC,itwasthe longest continuously occupied settlement in the region. 
Thesettlement patternin thesouthernCoixt­lahuaca valley has a form similar to the con­temporaneous polities in the central Mixteca Alta: a territory of 50–150 km2; a population of 5,000–15,000 inhabitants; a civic-ceremonial center, usually on a high, defendable moun­tain; secondary centers or barrios with public buildings at lower elevations; and a variety of settlementsclose to thevalley.oor.This pattern wasinterpreted as the ñuu, the Mixtec term for the small state (Kowalewski et al. 2009:305– 314).InChocholtec, the corresponding term is saçê (see below). 
LateClassic, Epiclassic, and EarlyPostclassic (AD 600–1200) 
TheLateClassicisproblematic in theMixteca Alta. Excavations at Yucuñudahui (Caso 1938; Spores 1974)andYucundaa (Spores and Robles García 2014)found abundant EarlyClassic and Late Postclassic occupation,butLateClassicand Early Postclassic contexts are rare and not well documented. Radiocarbon dates arelacking. The nearestplacewith substantialassemblagesinthe AD600–1000timerangeisPeñolesinthe eastern Mixteca Alta (Finsten 1996). 
In 19 of our collections, we found sherds similartoaware identi.edinVeracruz, Puebla, and elsewhere in Oaxaca as metálica or false plumbate, which should date to about AD 1000 (Bey and Ringle 2007; Fahmel 1988). Pastes are .ne-tempered, hard, and .red orange; sur­faces areslipped darkgray andburnished, with pre-.ringincisingof medium-width simple lines or post-.ring thin lines scratched through the slip. Vessels are mostly bowls—slightly out-leaning, cylindrical, or barrel-shaped—and rims aresimple and direct. Furtherwork maybe able to identify co-occurring wares. 
Figure5 shows that collections having metálica sherds are widespread, but none are fromthe Coixtlahuaca urban center.Tentatively we suggesta repopulationofthevalleyinEarly Postclassic times. Sites where metálica occurs are generally small and located on hilltops in the upper reachesof drainages,a situationsuitedfor small populations lacking thelabor to maintain terrace systems covering whole basins. This scenario requirestesting. 
LatePostclassic(AD 1200–1520) 
This was the time of heaviest occupation (Figure6).We mapped 10,215 ha of settlement. Societywasatits most urbanized; rural economic developmentwasgreater than at anytime before or since. 
Some Late Postclassic sites are remarkably extensive.Thecityof Coixtlahuacahasan unbro­ken spread of Late Postclassic artifacts covering 30 km2, not counting nearby barrios such as the 6km2 of Suchixtlahuaca. The central sectors aloneofTequixtepecand Ihuitláncovered9km2 each. Essentially thewholevalleyofTulancingo is one archaeological site of 8 km2.Togive an idea of demographic scale, a density of 10 to 25 persons per hectare(compact low-density village in the Basin of Mexico [Sanders et al. 1979:38–39] and therange used most frequently in highland Oaxaca surveys[Kowalewski et al. 1989:35]) would yield a range of 100,000 to 250,000 people in the valley of Coixtlahuaca, 10 to 25 times the population today. Further re.nements in population estimates could be made by considering sites of higher density

TheMixteca Alta asawholewas quite urban­ized and theCoixtlahuaca valley evenmoreso. About85%ofits populationlivedin settlements greater than 40 ha. Using an urban threshold of 100ha (1,000to 2,500 people),the urbanization ratewouldbe77%,whichishigh comparedto other urban societieshistorically(deVries 1984). 
Thelargestsiteswereurbaninphysical and demographicsize. Theywere top-ranked central places in a system of cities that extended well beyond this valley. But what portion of their inhabitants was engaged in providing goods and services not found in other places? How socially heterogeneous were these centers?Was this an “agrarian urbanism”(Kowalewski et al. 2009:346–348)?Our systematic surface collec­tions at Coixtlahuaca identi.ed no zones of spe­cialized production nor any obviously poor sec­tors.Therewasafairdegreeofcost-uniformity in household refuse over the city, rather than concentration of wealth in the center (Steere and Kowalewski 2012).

.rst step, and surface collections are not suf­.cient in themselves to answer these complex questions. 
Were these places just overgrown villages? Did people have milpas next to their houses? Perhaps,but theresidential densitywassuch that the urban space was not suf.cient to provide the amount of food required. Most of the urban dwellers may have been farming outside the city limits, as in traditional Yoruba cities, but the rural areas were already heavily populated and city residents would have been competing for land with many thousands of rural people (Figure6). 
What activities and functions went on in cities such as Coixtlahuaca, especially at the householdlevel?Thisisabroader,Mesoamerica­wide problem brought to light when systematic surveys began documenting the scale of cities and the characterof theirhinterlands. 
The Late Postclassic saw intensive rural development. Settlementsweredistributed so as to locatefarmers near the .elds that requiredthe most labor and attention. This meantadispersed settlement pattern—81% of sites(325) were less than 10 ha in size. Rural settlements were more dispersedinsomedrainages and more nucleated in others. In the Teopan tributary, we found

44 sitestotaling93ha; Concepción Buenavista, outsidethecityof Ihuitlán,had51 sitestotaling 87 ha. Nativitas had 41 sites totaling 487 ha, including two of 113 ha each. Coixtlahuaca’s immediate hinterland had the same pattern of numerous hamlets and small villages plus seven midsizeplacesof40to200haor more. 
Smallholders and communities were embed­ded in a large-scale commercial economy. Sixteenth-century sources tell of a major inter­national market in Coixtlahuaca (Códice Chi­malpopoca 1945; Durán 1967:2:185–195), and there were other markets as well (van Does-burg 2002). Given the large population and degreeof urbanization, undoubtedlytherewasa high degree of market dependence. Comparative urban and rural household studies are needed to document this economy. 
Evidence of specialized production and dis­tributionof goodsis limited.We identi.edtwo andesite quarry-workshops for making manos and metates(one at Cerro Nata covers2ha) and severalsitesusedfor chertworking. All obsidian was imported and most was recovered from Late Postclassic contexts.Obsidian densitiesare higher in the city of Coixtlahuaca than in other places,but obsidianiswidelydistributed across all neighborhoods.Wefound none of thestan­dardevidenceforplacesof pottery making,yet the quantities ofceramic refuse are astounding. In historic times, pottery-making villages in the Mixteca Alta were not located in the wide and fertilevalleysbutinmore agriculturally marginal places such asTonaltepec, just outside our survey area. Onehypothesis is that potters andfarmers were engaged in market exchange in which therewere zonesof specialization, followingthe principleofcomparativeadvantage(Kowalewski 2016). 
The CCA is revealing in several respects (Figure7).Our analysis attemptsto capturepub­lic buildings as opposed to ordinary domestic structures.Our criteriaare size,aplatformgreater than1min height,and placementinaprominent positionorassociationwithaplaza. Thetopof theplatformre.ectsthe potentialsize and form of thebuildingit once supported. Platform tops aredistributedin threeclasses: “small”(n = 49) havetops less than10minlength(thesmallestis 24m2); “medium”(n = 32) have one dimension greater than 10 m but top areas less than 200 m2;and “large”(n = 26) have top areas greater than 200 m2. Dating is by associated ceramics fromthe surface or fromexposed .ll, thus “Late Postclassic” may mean platform construction or continued useof an earlierplatform. Structures that we could not date by associated sherds, suchastwosmall platformsonthe CerroVerde peak, are not included here.By thesecriteriathe CCA count is 107. The “?” symbol in Figure7 indicates places where publicbuildings probably existed but are obscured, such as under the sixteenth-centuryConventodeSan Juan Bautista Coixtlahuaca. 
TheValleyofCoixtlahuacahas relativelyfew CCA structures.The countis onlya quarterof that in the central Mixteca Alta (Kowalewski et al. 2009:412–483). Its major center has fewer platform mounds than the Pueblo Viejo at Teposcolula, a much smaller city (Stiver 2001:93). 
The platforms are small. The tallest is 7 m high. The largest are smaller than their con­temporariesinthe centralMixteca Alta and the ValleyofOaxaca.Thesmall numberof platforms and their small size is characteristic of the entire Coixtlahuaca sequence after the Forma­tive. Public architectureofimposingdimensions concentrateslabor,symbolic meaning, and psy­chologicaleffectin singular, centralplaces (e.g., Burger and Rosenswig 2012).This concentration wasweakin thevalleyofCoixtlahuaca.Yetthere wasabuiltenvironment thatwasimposing,fullof symbolic meaning, and perhaps psychologically moving—the completely terraced, monumental landscape (cf.

Small groups of buildings on hilltops mark the edgesof territories.Forexample, the edges of the small valley at Teopan have two nearly identical four-mound-and-patio groups.Similar groupsarefoundinthe centralMixtecaAltaand intheValley ofOaxaca,sothisisa patternthat crossed regional and linguistic lines. Northeast of Tequixtepec, the Cerro Dade (hill of the market in Chocholtec) and Cerro de Enmedio, both defensible, have formal mound groups. A single small platform in an enclosure was built on the summit of the forti.ed Cerro de La Campana south of Tulancingo. The limits of some large settlements also may be marked by mound groups.Coixtlahuaca has four-mound groups at its north and south ends, and its major barrio of Suchixtlahuaca to the west has two formal groups. 
Itis not clear what scaleofterritoryororga­nizationthese boundarysitesmayhave marked. Each potentially pertained to a local territorial organization; for example, Teopan could have had an eastern and a western barrio. Or a ruling housemighthave placeda cadet lineageat some remove from itself, in which case the group of buildings,saythethreeat Otla,wouldbeabranch pertainingtoaruling dynasty. 

Terracing and LandTenure 

It has long been known that farmers in the MixtecaAltacoveredthelandwith cross-channel (lama-bordo)and contour terraces to retain and buildupsoiland moisture.Terraced .elds,espe­cially lama-bordos, were more productive than extensive rainfall-dependent .elds (Spores and Balkansky 2013:8–79, 108–109). In the banks of down-cut arroyos we recorded 284 ancient check dams. This number is almost meaningless becausewe could not search forthem systemati­cally and manythat onceexistedare nowburied or eroded away. A more methodical search by Leighand Holdridge found50onasinglestream (Leigh et al. 2013). Every inhabited stream drainage had chains of check dams. 
Identifying ancient hillside terraces is more problematic.Farmers constantly shiftthe stone walls to cope with soil movement and changing land tenure, so theterraces in places with active .elds are recent creations. Slopes where .elds were abandoned in the past have been scoured by sheet and gulleyerosion. Recent reforestation projectsfurther modify slopes. 
Theexperienceof recentfarmers teaches us two key principles. First, terraces and check dams are made and maintained by small, usu­ally household task-groups (Pérez Rodríguez 2006). Second, because unchecked .oodwaters are destructive,awholedrainagesegmenthasto be managed—thehillsides as well as thestream. Therefore, check dams are made in conjunction with contour terraces,beginning at the heads of drainages, not at the midpoint or downstream. These two principles, smallholder labor and whole-drainage management,haveimplications for social organization. 
Investment of labor in landesque capital, that is, investment in long-term material improve­ments to land (Håkansson and Widgren 2014), apparentlybeganinthe EarlyFormative.Acom­mitment of many cooperating households must have been thekeyto theNeolithic revolutionin this part of Mesoamerica. Why the investment of labor in terracing? With these fertile but erodible soils, erratic rains, and sloping terrain, terracing would be the best way to farm under most conditions of population density or market demand. It was not a technological innovation made reluctantly under conditions of population pressure aftera long periodofextensivefarming (Boserup 1966), but a practical solution for normalriskmanagement,inuse almost fromthe beginning. The agricultural consequence of this commitmentwashighyield.The population con­sequence was a positive feedback loop between higher yields andalarger labor force. 
Someresearchers(Barker 2002;Håkansson 2014;Loiske 2004)have associated landesque capital with world-system demands. The idea is that farmers will not intensify their labor if they do not need cash or there is no external market demandfortheir output.Weare opento consideringmarketdemand from theMesoamer­icanworld-system as onefactor promotinglan­desque capital. The external demands would likelyhavehadtodowiththetextile sector(cf. Starketal. 2016).Nonetheless,it seemsprobable that most market demandwasendogenous, com­ing fromthe Mixteca Alta and its nearby trading partners.

Apart from the origin of demand, landesque capitalstudieshaveobservedregularitiesinprop­erty and land tenure. In general, small farmers will not invest their own labor in land improve­ments if they do not have some assurance of long-term tenure(Brook.eld 1984).Forexam­ple, sharecroppersonyear-to-year contractsmay work hardtosow and reap as much as theycan, but they have no interest in picking up stones (Svensson 2014). Sixteenth-century wills from Tulancingo in the valley of Coixtlahuaca show that smallholders did have long-term, heritable rights to their .elds (van Doesburg 2004). An implicationwouldbethat the tay situndayu (the Mixtec term for landless laborers) would have been a small proportion of the commoner class inplaces with intensiveagriculturalterracing.We cannot seethe formof property archaeologically, but the intensive rural development is consis­tent with thehistoricalevidence forsmallholder control. Future archaeological study of house­holds could measure relative economic wealth and degree of permanence (Pérez Rodríguez 2006). 
Local communities and landesque capital have a long history in Coixtlahuaca. Yet there is a paradox: the population experienced high-amplitude swings of growth and decline, cycles that coincide with demographic rise and decline elsewhereinhighland Oaxaca. Periods of great growth and decline are hardly uncommon in the archaeological record in Mesoamerica or on other continents. We are not yet able to account for such cycles at Coixtlahuaca. One factorthatcould accountforthehigher amplitude in this broad valley, as opposed to the small valleys, is the positive feedback loop of inten­sive agriculture—demand—population growth. This loop may have been hard to initiate (as it would be today), but when operating, it could be powerful and self-sustaining. Nevertheless, it was vulnerable to rapid collapse, conceivably from external military force and certainly from an entirely exogenous factor such as European diseases (cf. Brook.eld 1986;Widgren2007). 

¿Cómo seOrganizaron? 

The commitmentto landesque capitalby small­holders shaped social organization and religion. 
In sixteenth-century Coixtlahuaca, smallholder households were organized in barrios(sindi in Chocholtec) that controlled and allocated rights touseand inherit.elds(vanDoesburg 2004;van Doesburg and Swanton 2011). Sindi were terri­torial and participatory,and theirlands coincided withasegmentofastream drainage.Territories were marked by shrines or temples. Sindi were corporatein this sense,but thereis no evidence that they were corporate descent groups. 
Sindi were sections of communities (saçê; Spanish pueblo), the minimal state correspond­ingto ñuu or altepetl (van DoesburgandSwanton 2011).Thesaçê hadaterritory that corresponded toadrainage basin.Thatis, barrios were situated along adjacent .rst-order streams. Communities (saçê)encompassedseveraloftheseand included adownstream,second-order reach. Thisis ideal­ized,butthe logicisthat thelabor and capitalin theland were situatedin speci.c stream basins. 
A concrete example can be traced along the stream from Tulancingo to Tequixtepec, where each communitywasin itsown basin separated fromits neighborsby adivide.TheRío Grande de Tulancingo heads at the western end of the valley, and the.rst communitywasTulancingo, consistingofseveral barriosalongthestreamand its tributaries.Tulancingo is separated from the next community to the east, Suchixtlahuaca, as the two are in different drainage basins. Down the Río Grande are two smaller communities, Capulalpam and Tepetlapa, each centered on a permanent tributarystream.Thesetwo arevery small places now, but in the Postclassic each had several barrios. Farther downstream, the Río Grande is joined by two important tribu­taries at the community of Tequixtepec. Here as elsewhere in the valley, larger towns are on the downstream reaches and smaller ones are upstream. As the Río Grande descends east of Tequixtepec,it.ows through narrowvalleysand itswaterismostly inaccessibleforfarming. The Tequixtepec border sites(Cerro Dade and Cerro de Enmedio) areatthe point wheretheriverdrops into a steep and rockygorge. 
In Late Postclassic and probably earlier times, asimilarnexus bound together intensiveagricul­ture, smallholders, strong communities, ritual, and institutions analogous to thehistoric tequio and faena (community collective work service),

as Carballo(2013b) notes for centralMexico. Noble lords and ladies, through their marriage alliances, conquests, and other deals, couldhave holdingsinvarious places,andin this sensethe city-state was not necessarily territorial (Hirth 2003; Romero Frizzi 1996; Terraciano 2001). But from the point of view of commoners, the saçê was a speci.c physical space. This tangleoflocal and cacique interests added fuel to territorial disputes that continued after the colonial period (Dennis 1987; Mendoza Gar­cía 2005). The entire valley and some places beyond were drawn together by alliance or conquest in a greater state (curhuña) headed by Coixtlahuaca (van Doesburg and Swanton 2011). Coixtlahuaca,Tequixtepec, Ihuitlán, and Tulancingo,in that order,werethe main centers, followed by tiers of secondary centers (e.g., Suchixtlahuaca, Nativitas) and tertiary centers (e.g., Capulalpam,Nata). 
The lienzos show the names and locations of subject towns and barrios, many of which can be identi.ed as speci.c clusters of archae­ological sites. Prehispanic, pre-congregación Otla, Suchixtlahuaca, Nativitas, Tequixtepec, and most of the barrios of Ihuitlán (Brown­stone 2015)are nowidenti.ableonthe ground. Other communities seen archaeologically have not yet been identi.ed on lienzos.Insome cases, the palaces or temples shown on the lienzos are speci.c, known archaeological places, as at Coixtlahuaca,Tequixtepec, Nativitas, Otla, and Tulancingo. 
Organization tended to be segmentary at all levels. Cities and smaller communities were aggregations of barrios and centralization was weak. We think this was due to the inward-facing, localizing tendencies of the communal landholding units. The noble class tended to segment by descent and marriage alliance, and did notdevelopmuchbureaucracy(Lind 2000). A distinctive feature of government detailed in the Coixtlahuaca lienzos is that the large centers had not onebut several ruling lineages. Coixtlahuacahadtwomajorruling lineages,each with its palace-temple (e.g., Caso 1977:1:118– 136) on opposite sides of the river about the centerofthecity.Therewasalesser noble palace­templeatthe northedgeofthecity.Tequixtepec likewisewas composedofseveralruling houses, according to the lienzos and sixteenth-century documents (Rincón Mautner 2007, 2012;van Doesburg 2002, 2010; van Doesburg and van Buren 1997). This feature of multiple ruling lineages in one city closely parallels the earlier description above, showing that the CCA were distributed in multiple places instead of being concentratedin single areas. 
Each of these three levels—sindi, saçê, and curhuña—has archaeological correlates. Sindi areclustersofsettlement located along drainage segments. Often there are hilltop shrines or temples,or settlements onhillsattheedgesof the barrio. Saçê are clusters of barrios along the same stream drainage, usually with a few publicbuildings distributedinthe larger barrios. The curhuña is seen archaeologically in the settlement hierarchy of the whole valley. The hierarchyofpublicbuildingsbynumber and size also re.ectsthe organizationofthe curhuña.

TheRACproject made improvements in ef.ciency, data management, and public edu­cation over similar previous surveys. It did not achieveallitsgoalsintheextentof area surveyed or quality and richnessofinformation.We rec­ommend that regional survey designs take into account both the improvements we made and the de.ciencies of the research design.

Thearchaeological recordofthe Coixtlahuaca valleyis enormous. One site on theRío Grande de Ihuitlán extends unbroken for14km, andit is not the largest. That distinction belongs to Coixtlahuaca, at 30 km2. The valley of Coixt­lahuacahas someofthelargestMiddleFormative sitesreported(oneis13km2). Artifactsare often abundant. The valley had neither big buildings nor stelae, and even the wealthy and powerful were stuffed into tombs less than a meter in diameter (Bernal 1948–1949). The real monu­mentof Coixtlahuacawasits completelyterraced landscape,aspatially and temporally distributed

work thatin its aggregatewasfarlarger than the pyramids ofTeotihuacan. 
The survey provides on-the-ground context forethnohistorical accounts. Aztecsources (e.g., Durán 1967:2:185) speak of the major inter­national market at Coixtlahuaca. The physical marketplace has not been located, although there are possibilities that might be investigated. A conquestofCoixtlahuacabyMotecuhzomaIwas chronicled by the Aztecs (e. g., Códice Chi­malpopoca 1945:52).Nonetheless, thearchaeo­logical imprintofAztec presence seemsminimal (Kowalewskiet al. 2010). 
Therichestethnohistorical sources arelocal and consist of the lienzos and some sixteenth-century texts in archives. Our archaeological survey is in accord with the lienzos,often in speci.c detailregarding named places,hierarchy, andthesegmentary characterofthestate.There is one important point on which the lienzos are totally silent, and that is the demographic and urban scale of society. This is true of royal dynastic texts elsewhere, too. When one sees thegraphicimageof lords carrying outaritual at a place named Tulancingo, one has no idea thatitwasa city9kmlong, covering thewhole Tulancingovalley.Thearchaeology suggeststhat 200,000 people was the approximate magni­tude of Late Postclassic Coixtlahuaca regional society. 
We have described how a population of this sizewasorganizedin theLate Postclassic.Key elements of this organization are older. Cross-drainage check dams dated to 1500 BC indicate an early age for the social commitment to ter­race systems. Investment in landesque capital increased in the Middle Formative, when we also seelocal communities centered on drainage basinsand shrinesor templesatthe boundariesof territories.The patternoffew, small, and widely distributed rather than centrally concentrated civic-ceremonialbuildingsbeganinthe Middle Formative. The city-state seems to have been presentin theEarly Classic,but almost nothing is known about political organization above the level of the local community in the Middle Formative. In this “moment” of Mixteca Alta society, local communities organize themselves. 
Important structural features have persisted over the longue durée: the strong linkage between smallholders and intensiveterrace agri­culture; cooperating, territorially based barrios and local communities; localist religion; and resistance to centralizing authority. These per­sistent structural features aremaintained through collectiveactiondrawing on internally generated resources (Blanton andFargher 2008). 
Persistence of the collective community does not translate into collective actionfor societyas awhole. Thestate had greater accesstoexternal resources, supra-local authority, and military power. Kings employed aggrandizing, individ­ualizing network strategies; they appropriated land and people(well attested in the sixteenth centuryasthesystemwascollapsing, e.g., Spores 2007; Terraciano 2001). This was the moment of Mixteca Alta societyemphasizedbyFargher et al.(2011). 
Society as a whole is neither self-organized nor organized by rulers. Mutually dependent, competing classes have distinct interests and strategies. In the Mixteca Alta the dialectic between rulers and the collectiveagencyofcom­moners was itself a persistent structural feature, and this case is not unique. Balinese history displays a similar struggle between rulers with external resources and communities that gener­ated internal resources through a self-governing agroecosystem(Covarrubias 1956;Geertz1980; Lansing 1995). Returning to the question asked by Coixtlahuacans abouthow peoplewereorga­nized in the past, and in light of what we have learned, we observethat theproblems and strate­gies, although not identical to those of today, were suf.ciently similarastomakethe answers interesting.
