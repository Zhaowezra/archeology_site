Thisstructural innovation resonates with Geros main theoreticalfocus,theinevitableambiguitythatexistsindoingarchaeologyandthedifficultyofproducingarchaeological knowledge about the past.
TheuseofbitsmakesitpossibleforGerotovarythestyle of writing in ways that would be inconceivable ina standard monograph. Some sections adopt a literarystyle bordering on the poetic that evokes the beauty oftheAndeanlandscape,theexcitementofarchaeologicaldiscovery, and the complexities of social interactionsbetweenarchaeologistsandlocalresidents.Inothersections, Gero adopts a descriptive style resembling thatusedbyethnographerstodescribelocalAndeanlifewayssuchastheritualsmadebyworkmentothePachamamaat the initiation and conclusion of excavations. In still other sections, Geroemploys the academicstyle oflanguageemployedincriticalarchaeologyinordertoarguethat all archaeological fieldwork carried out in LatinAmericabyforeignersfromrichandpowerfulnationssuchastheUnitedStatesandEuropeancountriesisinherentlyimperialistic,regardlessoftheirmotivationsorthewaytheytreatthelocalpopulation.Instillotherbits,drydetailed descriptions of excavations are offered in thestyle typical of field reports.
Yutopian isbasedonextensivefieldworkcarriedout attwoEarlyFormativesitesin1994,1996,1998,1999,and 2004 within the District of Catamarca in northwest Argentina.Theculturesfromthisperiodoftime(approximately 200 B.C.A.D. 500) were poorly understoodwhenGerobeganherresearchbutwereusuallyconceptualized as smallscale societies lacking in state organization and surviving on a mixed economy of maize,herding, and hunting. The populations were thought tohave been organized into dispersed homesteads. At3,200 m above sea level, the site ofYutopian is locatedin a high arid valley with barely enough water for subsistenceagriculture.Todaythisremoteareaisonlylightlyinhabited,butthearchaeologicalinvestigationsreportedhere suggest a larger population in the prehistoric past.
The archaeological efforts by the binational U.S.Argentine team directed by Gero and Cristina Scattolinwere largely devoted to the excavation of householdunitsandpublicspacesatYutopian;forpurposesofcomparison,fieldworkwasextendedtothecoevalandnearbysite of Cardonal. The results by Gero and Scattolin collectivelydemonstratedtheexistenceofEarlyFormativeridgetopvillagesmadeupofpatiogroupseachconsistingof an open, unroofed courtyard area and two to threesubterraneanhousesconnectedtoit.ThesevillagesparticipatedinlongdistanceexchangenetworksthatlinkedthemprobablyviallamacaravanstothePacificcoasttothe west (the source of lapis lazuli beads) and forested lowlandstotheeast(thesourceof Anadenathera sp.for hallucinogenic snuff).
In this book special attention is paid to the sequenceofinvestigationandthelogicbehindtheseriesofstrategicdecisions that were made. The end product is a muchmore realistic depiction offield research than is usuallypresented. Gero takes this one step further by showinghow what we know about the past at Yutopian is ultimately a product of the decisions that were made, consciously and unconsciously, and therefore that thisknowledge is contingent upon the frameworks andassumptions that shaped those decisions.
Despite Geros caveats about the difficulty of producing knowledge, I emerged from reading her volumewithamuchricherunderstandingoftheEarlyFormativeinnorthwestArgentina.Atthesametime,thebookholdsthe practice of archaeology up to the light in a way thatis rare in archaeological monographs. This heighteneddegreeofselfrevelationandselfawarenessissometimesdisturbing and often messy. Gero never fully reconcilesherharshcondemnationofcolonialistarchaeologywithher repeated field seasons in Argentina. Similarly, herdiscussionofthesouringofherfriendshipswithArgentine colleagues fails to fully explore the difficulty ofnegotiating collaborative relationships within the contemporary sociopolitics ofArgentina. Yet perhaps thisiswhatismostnoteworthyaboutthisbook:noeasysolutions are proposed and no absolute interpretations areadvanced. The ambiguity and uncertainty of doingarchaeology and producing archaeological knowledgearefacedsquarelyandhonestly.Perhapsforthisreason,one of the best audiences for this volume will be those archaeology students whose ideas about the disciplineare still in the process of being formed.

Spanning several centuries to thepresent day, the sites history is critical to interpretingwhatremainsoftheIncaimprint.Acleartheoreticalperspective is also delineated, as are Nairs objectives.Anideographic approach to architecture grounded in phenomenological theory serves as the framework for thestudy.

These monuments may befamiliar to students of Inca architecture, but here, Nairencourages us to experience Topa Incas heavyhandedpresencefromtheinsideandpersuadesusthatthepathsand routes by which we are directed are highly choreographed.
The great stage on which the Inca established communication betweenthe stateanditslocalinhabitantsis discussed in Chapter 3, Pampa/Plaza. Nair underscoresthe importance of these enormous open spaces as morethan meeting places for pageants and large crowds.Instead, her detailed analysis addresses how the plazaswere used and by whom, the entrances and exits thatdirected the royals and their crowds, and the sacredandquotidian spaces often overlooked in their analysis.
