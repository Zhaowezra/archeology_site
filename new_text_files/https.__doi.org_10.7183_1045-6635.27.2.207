Hunter­gatherer occupations of the forests of Patagonia are still not well understood compared to those of the open steppeand the coasts. The paucity of forest sites with a thorough chronological framework and the incomplete picture of climate­human dynamics in such environments pose a challenge to understanding the occupations of such habitats. This paperpresents recent work at the Las Quemas rockshelter, an archaeological site located in the Andean forests of theAisén region(44°38’S) dating between 6100 and 2400 cal B.P. We examine the context of the site, its rock art, and the technological andfunctional dimensions of its lithic assemblage. By comparing these records with local environmental reconstructions thatreport forest area fluctuations after the Post­Glacial period, this study provides novel data for a comprehensive regional­scale model of human occupations in central Patagonian forests. Following an initial mid­Holocene occupation, recurringoccupationaleventsatthesitecoincidewithasignificantcontractionofforestedareaintheregionduringthelateHolocene.The results are discussed in regard to regional archaeological data and current models of forest occupation in Patagonia.

Archaeological contexts in the temperateforests of western South America date to as earlyas the terminal Pleistocene (Dillehay 1997). Sitereoccupation, raw material selection, particulartechnologies, and settlement choices, among oth­ers, have been discussed for the Araucanía regionnorth of 42° S for distinct periods and at differentspatial scales (e.g., Campbell and Quiroz 2015;Dillehay 2007; García 2009). In the same latitu­dinal region on the eastern slopes of the Andes,the number of radiocarbon dates from archaeo­logical sites located in forests increases suddenlyafter 3500 cal B.P. (Barberena et al. 2015; Fer-nández et al. 2011), probably as the result of theloss of earlier datable material. Several scholars have identified characteristics of forest occupationin southwest Río Negro and west Chubut (Ar­gentina), with a specific focus on settlement pat­terns, subsistence, technology, rock art, and rawmaterial use (e.g., Fernández 2008; Fernández etal. 2011; López et al. 2009; Pérez and Smith 2007;Scheinsohn et al. 2010, 2015; Scheinsohn andMatteucci 2004). Others have investigated thepossible contact between the eastern and westernslopes of the Andes through mountain corridors(Bellelli et al. 2008).
This scholarly focus contrasts sharply with theamount of data published on the forests of theAisén region (43°40’ to 49° S), which comprisesroughly one-third of the Patagonian forests (Figure1). In this area where the Western Andes descenddirectly into the ocean, systematic archaeologicalexplorations have been limited to the coastal fringe(Méndez and Reyes 2015:21). Although the initialdates for the coastal human occupation extendback to the mid-Holocene, radiocarbon datesmainly fall into the period after 2000 cal B.P.(Reyes et al. 2015:217). The steppe and the for­est-steppe transition to the east of the Andes havehigher site frequencies than the western slopes;intermittent human presence has been documentedthere throughout the Holocene (Mena and Stafford2006; Méndez et al. 2011). In contrast, immenseareas within the forested Andean valleys remainwithout survey coverage. Few sites there havebeen excavated, and knowledge of the spatiotem­poral dimensions of human occupation is limited.
Two main scenarios have been proposed forunderstanding human occupations of forests inAndean Patagonia and the changes in their inten­sity (Scheinsohn et al. 2009). First, forests in thisarea are less productive (cervids are often solitary,unpredictable prey), more difficult to movethrough, have visibility constraints, and are muchmore abrupt in their topography than neighboringhabitats. Therefore, occupation of the Andean for­est must have complemented that of the steppe,most likely on a seasonal basis. The intensity ofhuman occupation of forest regions is low com­pared to open spaces (e.g., Belardi and Campán1999; Belardi et al. 2010; Borrero and Muñoz1999; Reyes et al. 2009). Accordingly, westernforests have been interpreted as marginally settledby populations principally located in the steppes(Borrero 2004:59). These populations may haveintensified their occupation of forests during cer­tain periods, but continued to do so in a comple­mentary fashion (e.g., Bellelli et al. 2000; Fer-nández et al. 2013; Méndez and Reyes 2008;Silveira 1999).
An alternative scenario proposes that forestswere permanently inhabited during specific peri­ods, as suggested by the study of archaeofaunalassemblages (Pérez and Smith 2007), rock art de­signs, and biogeographical constraints. For exam­ple, in the case of Aisén, Mena (2013:187) hasproposed that a microidentity developed duringthe late Holocene in the middle Ibáñez basin(~46°10’ S).
Only few archaeological sites, however, haveproduced well-dated stratigraphic sequences inforest settings. The use of multiple radiocarbondates is an appropriate method for defining occu­pational redundancy and for assessing the spa­tiotemporal dimensions of human presence andactivities in specific environments. The latter re­quires comparison with similar data sets fromneighboring areas that provide a regional context.Moreover, it is important to develop a compre­hensive understanding of environmental fluctua­tions on a local and regional scale. In this case,the spatial extent of forests, their properties (closedor open canopies), available resources, and therole of fires in these environments provide valu­able comparative paleoenvironmental data for in­terpreting the archaeological record. Finally, as­sessing the role of key resources is critical forunderstanding human occupations in forests. Inthis study, we employ use-wear analyses and anewly developed experimental program to assess

that the region was intermittently occupied at vary­ing degrees of intensity and in connection withareas to the east (Méndez et al. 2012, 2014). Theearliest forest occupations have been recorded inthe Ibáñez River Basin. Las Guanacas cave andFontana rockshelter yielded basal dates of 6450–5640 and 5620–5320 cal B.P. (Mena 1983:72,2000:34). The evidence of occupation for this areais not continuous; it is sparse until the last millen­nium (Fuentes and Mena 2010; Reyes 2002).
This paper presents recent work at the LasQuemas rockshelter, which is a key location forunderstanding forest occupations of the CisnesValley of Central Western Patagonia. The CisnesRiver is the only river that crosses the Aisén regioneast to west, covering the range of vegetationzones. As such, it is theoretically suitable for rec­ognizing potential incursions into different typesof forest environments (Méndez and Reyes 2008).The distribution of the 50 sites recorded in the Cisnes basin shows a marked drop in the numberof sites moving from east to west (steppe: 26; for­est-steppe transition: 17; deciduous forest: 6; ever­green forest: 1). The contemporaneous occupationof sites between 2800 and 2300 cal B.P. in the steppe (El Chueco 1) and in deciduous (Las Que-mas rockshelter) and evergreen (El Toro rockshel­ter) forests along the Cisnes basin has been inter­preted as a rise in seasonal or sporadic forestoccupation. It was possibly triggered by disad­vantageous environmental conditions in the steppewhere groups dwelled permanently (de Porras etal. 2014; Méndez and Reyes 2008). After this rise,there are no more records of occupations in theCisnes basin forests (Reyes et al. 2009:20). Thisarticle describes recent excavations conducted at Las Quemas, the geoarchaeological context of thesite, radiocarbon dates, rock art evidence, and acomplete study of lithic evidence. The results ofthis study are discussed in the context of local pa­leoenvironmental reconstructions and regional ar­chaeological data. As a result, the Las Quemasrockshelter provides a new perspective for under­standing certain aspects of the human occupationof central Patagonian forest environments. 

Regional Setting and Paleoenvironment 
To the west of central Patagonia, the environmentof the Aisén region is primarily shaped by the prevailing westerly winds and the orographic ef­fect produced by their interaction with the Andesmountain range (Garreaud 2009). In the westernpart of the region, abrupt escarpments descenddirectly into the ocean, whereas to the east of theAndes, the landscape consists primarily of exten­sive sedimentary plains. Precipitation values inexcess of 3,000 mm/yr in the western archipelagosand coastal mountains, 1,500–850 mm/yr in thedeciduous forests, and less than 400 mm/yr in theeastern semiarid open steppes reflect a markedwest-to-east decrease in precipitation (Pliscoff2003). In the Cisnes River Basin, this rainfall gra­dient takes place across less than 140 km. Themain vegetation communities are dominated byMagellan’s coigüe beech (Nothofagusbetuloides), mistletoe (Desfontainia), and quila (Chusquea)in the evergreen forests; lenga beech (N. pumilio)in the deciduous forests; ñirrebeech (N.antarctica)and calafate (Berberis) in the forest-steppe eco­tone type transition; and coirón (Festuca pallescens) and neneo (Mulinumspinosum) in thegrass steppe (Luebert and Pliscoff 2006). Potentialanimals of prey include the guanaco(Lamaguanicoe)in the open settings. The forests are inhabited bycervids, such as the South Andean deer, or huemul,and the pudú (Hippocamelus bisulcus and Pudu puda). A wide array of smaller fauna (carnivores,dasypods), including birds (Muñoz-Pedreros andYáñez 2009) are common to most environments.
Sedimentary records from the local LakeShaman and Mallín El Embudo have been used to reconstruct climate variability since the Post-Glacial period in the Cisnes River Valley (de Porraset al. 2012, 2014; Figure 2). The pollen recordfrom Mallín El Embudo, located in a forested areanear the Las Quemas rockshelter (~13 km), re­flects the varying overlap of the forest canopy onthe horizontal plain. This indicates closed-or open-forest environment. At the beginning of thelake core sequence dating to between 13,000 and11,200 cal B.P., grass taxa accompanied by herbsand shrubs with minor Nothofagus pollen suggesta local grass steppe environment (de Porras et al.2014:1071). The presence of Nothofagus pollenmay be explained either by scant forest patchesor long-distance transport from the western coastalforests (Bennett et al. 2000). This pollen assem­blage is consistent with effective moisture levelsthat were lower than modern levels. It is partially

sudden vegetation change to open forest condi­tions in Mallín el Embudo (de Porras et al.2014:1071). Finally, during the last 2,000 years,the frequency of Nothofagus increased. This in­crease was not as pronounced as the change thatoccurred during the early to mid-Holocene.Nonetheless, it is marked enough to suggest thepresence of a closed forest. Modern climatic con­ditions characterized by dynamic shifts in vege­tation were established by 400 cal B.P.
The sedimentary record at Mallín El Embudo shows a highly variable Charcoal AccumulationRate (CHAR) with periods of low accumulationthat are punctuated by high-magnitude fire episodes (de Porras et al. 2014). High fire fre­quencies and high magnitude episodes were char­acteristic for the period from 13,000 to 10,500cal B.P., with a distinguishable maximum fireepisode at ~12,000 cal B.P. High fire frequenciesalso occured from 8200 to 3800 cal B.P. In con­trast, between 10,500 and 8000 cal B.P., and againfrom 3800 to 400 cal B.P., fire frequencies weregenerally low and the magnitudes were variable. 


Methods 
Archaeological fieldwork at the Las Quemas rock-shelter focused on the excavation of a 12-m2 area near a 1-m2 test pit initially excavated by Mena(1996). The excavators used 10-cm arbitrary levelsto identify distinct stratigraphic layers. Carefulexcavation included the tridimensional location of all artifacts larger than 3 cm and the identifica­tion of features to understand the horizontal rela­tions between them. Excavation was restricted to 9 m2 after a 50-cm depth. All of the sedimentswere sieved with a 4-mm mesh. We used 14C (ra­diocarbon) AMS dating to establish the chronol­ogy of human occupation at the site and to under­stand site formation processes. Whenever severalradiocarbon ages were statistically indistinguish­able at e = .05, occupational events were calcu­lated by averaging them (Ward and Wilson 1978).The radiocarbon dates that are discussed in this paper were corrected by calibrating the ages intoyears before present (cal B.P.) with Calib 7.0.0(Stuiver et al. 2013) applying the ShCal13 curve(Hogg et al. 2013); the dates are reported as 2a. 
The rock art analysis followed methods usedfor other sites in the region (Nuevo Delaunay et al. 2013), including image enhancing with the useof the D-Stretch program (Harman 2008). Rockart elements are defined as discrete units limited by the edges of the rock panels. These units weregrouped into simple or complex motifs. The fre­quencies of elements and motifs should be re­garded as a minimum number, given the advanceddeterioration of the rock art. 
Lithic material was analyzed using technolog­ical criteria that focused on assessing complete­ness, cortex index, tool and debitage classes, anddesign attributes (Andrefsky 1998). Lithic rawmaterial identification was performed macroscop­ically (25 samples). The identifications were cross­checked with thin-section petrography (6 samples)and geochemical trace-element composition forselected obsidian samples using ELAN D CRICP-MS at the University of Colorado. Trace-el­ement compositions are considered accurate to± 5 percent at the level of concentrations, basedon repeated analysis of standard rock samples ofknown composition. Obsidian types were definedby comparing these data with the trace-elementchemistry of obsidian samples from knownsources (Stern 2004). Given the specific natureof forest resources, use-wear analyses were per­formed on retouched and unretouched lithics to identify particular actions and substances (Keeley1980). These analyses included an experimentalprogram that was designed for identifying ex­pected uses of tools on different raw materials,targeting specifically the wear produced by wood­working (Hormazábal 2015). Microscopic obser­vation at 200x of all lithics with edges longer than3 cm was conducted with a digital polarized hand-held Dino-Lite (model AM413ZTA) device. 


Site Context, Stratigraphy, and Chronology 
The Las Quemas rockshelter (44°37’42’’ S, 71°51’37’’W, 724 m asl; Figure 3) is located at theheadwaters of Las Quemas creek (Mena 1996;Méndez and Reyes 2006), which runs a length of
12.5 km. The creek first continues parallel to theCisnes River and then drains into the mid-section of the river from northeast to southwest. This small valley is limited to the north by the Las Quemasrange (> 1,600 m asl) and can be accessed onlyfrom the Cisnes juncture or along a wide terrace atthe creek’s headwaters. The site is fairly accessible

and visible from afar, although the view has prob­ably been enhanced by forest clearance in the twen­tieth century. The shelter faces northeast, is 40 mlong (E-W), and provides a protected horizontalarea of ~200 m2. The site is still used for herding.
Excavations were conducted in the center of the shelter, where occupants would have receivedmaximum protection. The excavated section ex­posed six distinctive stratigraphic units (SU) thatwere horizontally superimposed, as shown in thesouthern profile (Figure 4). Roof fall particles,sometimes in excess of 125,000 cm3, complicatedthe observation of layers, specifically in the west­ern sector. As such, different SUs were occassion­aly represented at the same depth or artificial level.Given the large number of volcanoes in the region,ash may be one of the main components of aeolianparticles (Mena and Buratovic 1997; Vandekerk­hove 2014).
SU1 was primarily composed of coarse andmid-size sand that was slightly compacted andhad a minor presence of clasts. The topsoil wasimmature, with a 3-cm deep O-horizon and rootsthroughout the A-horizon. SU1 and SU2 wereseparated by a clear boundary. SU2 consisted offiner, slightly more compacted sand that had minorclast and was of brown color. It yielded a minorpresence of charcoal speckles. The boundary be­tween SU2 and SU3 was diffuse. SU3 was com­posed of fine sands that were probably moreweathered than the overlaying strata because itincluded buried thin A-and B-horizons. Clasts were rare and charcoal particles were abundant inthis dark-brown layer, which shared a diffuseboundary with the underlying SU4. The matrixof SU4 contained larger grain-size particles thatincluded small granules in minor proportion, es­pecially in the southern sector. In this unit, char­coal flecks were the most common and extended across the excavation area. This is likely the resultof local fires that may have caused the higher or­ganic content (black in color) of the layer as wellas the abundance of roof fall particles observed atthe base of SU4 and in the southern profile. Thebase of SU4 also yielded small (10–13 cm) peb­bles; it differs sharply from the unit beneath. SU5was composed of heavily compacted finer sandsand smaller grain-size particles with a small pro­portion of exogenous pebbles (3–15 cm). It yielded no charcoal and was inorganic and yellowin color. The stratigraphic boundary between SU5and SU6 was diffuse. The last layer, SU6, wasalso a heavily compacted layer of inorganic finesands, which may have been deposited by normalgrading in a subaquatic environment, as suggestedby weak layering.

Group 2 displays motifs that consist of one setof concentric circles, two individual circles, twosmall parallel lines (occasionally interpreted as guanaco tracks), four tri-digit tracks (attributed tothe flightless lesser rhea, or Rhea pennata), andalarge, diffuse red paint stain (which may have re­sulted from the weathering of otherwise recogniz­able motifs). The aforementioned elements showthe three different levels of wear. Group 3 consistsof two heavily worn tri-digit tracks (Figure 6b).This is the only panel facing upward; the rest werepainted on the main wall oriented north. Group 4is composed of one large tri-digit, two parallellines, and one complex abstract motif depicting arectangular form with attached lines (Figure 6c).They all show light wear. Finally, Group 5 consistsof several (~11) parallel lines, of which one islarger than the others. This group includes a largered stain, and the paintings show moderate wear.We do not presuppose that a distinct wear level isassociated with particular motifs or panels.
Five hundred meters to the east, the researchteam identified Las Quemas 2 (44°37’36’’S,71°51’59’’W, 724 m asl), a significantly smallerrockshelter that depicts similar rock art in onepanel. The elements include parallel lines andsmaller tri-digit tracks (N = 4), which arearranged in opposing directions. The character­istics of this shelter did not allow for excavation to be conducted. 


The LithicAssemblage 
The excavation at Las Quemas yielded very lowartifact frequencies, with fragmentation rates rang­ing between 35 and 50 percent per level (Table2). Because high fragmentation increases the po­tential for overrepresenting data, the artifact countspresented here include only the pieces that bearstriking platforms, such as flakes (Andrefsky1998:83). Lithics were preliminarily assigned tochronological blocks that encompassed severalstratigraphic units. Two hundred and fifty lithicartifacts were associated with the three stratigraph­ically indistinguishable events that constituted thelate Holocene occupational block, whereas 56lithics were assigned to the mid-Holocene occu­pation. The reduced discard of lithics thereforeindicates a human occupation of low intensity.
The assemblage is largely represented by deb­itage classes, which are mainly flakes producedduring edge modification (e.g., marginal debitage;Table 2). Core flakes are less represented, whichsuggests that most lithics must have entered thesite as flakes instead of being locally extracted fromcores. This indicates that rocks were introduced to the site at an advanced stage of processing and im­plies that the initial stages of reduction occurred atother locations in the area. Other debitage classesare even less frequent. Activities such as bifacialthinning and edge retouching were not conductedsystematically at the site. Judging from the lithicassemblage, cores were not discarded at the site.
Only a very minor part of the assemblage dis­plays attributes of recognizable formal or informal

technological attributes of debitage on these stone-tools and on granite are consistent with the localprocurement.
Chalcedony must have been obtained fromafar; the intention to curate this high quality non­local lithic material is indicated by formal attrib­utes on the discarded tools. Three obsidian artifacts from the late Holocene occupational block wereanalyzed using ICP-MS. These artifacts producedsignatures consistent with two cases of PDA1 typefrom Pampa del Asador, a high-quality sourceeast of Perito Moreno National Park, and one caseof CIS, a low-quality source in the upper CisnesBasin (Méndez et al. 2012:370; Stern et al. 2013:245).
An assessment of the knapping quality of thedifferent lithic resources suggests a slightly higher-quality selection of materials associated with theearlier occupational block. Here, ~60 percent ofthe lithics were produced using good and excellentraw materials. The assemblage of the latter occu­pation contained only ~33 percent of such mate­rials and was instead dominated by mid-to-coarsegrain lithic resources. The choice of raw materialis consistent with the high frequency of attributesindicating hard-hammer percussion among thelate occupation (~79 percent). In the earlier occu­pation, this technology is used only half as much
(37.5 percent).
The occupational blocks also shared severaltechnological attributes. For example, the platformtypology, which consisted of simple designs, re­mained the same over time. To a lesser degree,there are similarities in the proportion of lithic ar­tifacts without cortex (93 percent in the mid-Holocene, 81 percent in the late Holocene). Bladetechnology also remained similar, as suggestedby the incidence of ridges parallel to the techno­logical extraction axis. The slight difference inthe overall size of measureable flakes across oc­cupational assemblages indicates smaller artifactsin the mid-Holocene occupational block.
Given the small size of the assemblage—es­pecially of edge-modified tool-types—we con­ducted a systematic functional analysis. An ex­perimental program designed with raw materialsof equivalent quality (obsidian, basalt, silex) al­lowed us to identify the used edges and patternsthat resulted from specific activities (scraping,cutting). We reproduced these activities with ex­pected local substances (woods, hide, bone, andmeat) using both retouched and unretouchededges. Additional details, including direction, time,angles, state of worked substances, and kinematicmotion have been discussed elsewhere (Hor­mazábal 2015).
Of the 338 analyzed edges, only 55 edges
(16.27 percent) on 44 lithics yielded traces attrib­utable to use-wear (edges without traces: 81.95percent; altered edges 1.78 percent). Only fouredges on three unretouched artifacts belonged tothe mid-Holocene occupational block. Althoughspecific actions were identified for all 55 edges,only 49 yielded sufficiently clear attributes fordetermining worked substances (Table 3). Scrap­ing was the most frequently performed action.Use-wear traces also indicated activities on hard and semi-hard substances. Most of the clear traces were identified on unretouched blades or flakes. The unmodified edges may have aided in the iden­tification of use-wear traces. 
Because the site is located in a forest, one ob­jective was to assess work with site-specific re­sources, such as wood. Identifiable traces of wood­working, specifically bright and smooth micro-polish attributable to scraping, were recorded in only four cases, and only on unre­touched edges. Other identifiable traces indicativeof activities on hard or semi-hard substances mayalso have been produced by woodworking. This

observation is tentative, because more detailedindicators require the use of higher magnifications.Lithic edges predominantly showed evidence ofother actions and substances (i.e., cutting andscraping on soft, semi-hard, and hard materials)attributable to tasks expected at campsites. 


Discussion 
Located in a biogeographical corridor along theCisnes River that transverses different ecologicalzones (Méndez and Reyes 2008), the Las Quemasrockshelter presents a useful case study for re­constructing human adaptation to forest environ­ments in Central Western Patagonia. Research atthe site elucidates the role of forest environments in the settlement choices and mobility patterns ofhunter-gatherers during the Holocene. The artifactassemblage of the site reveals limited raw materialdiversity, predominantly close-range procurementof stonetools, low discard rates, low tool frequen­cies, and few utilized edges. This assemblage alsorepresents the discarded material from at leastfour occupational events, highlighting the reducednature of tasks performed at the campsite. It isalso indicative of the scarcity of archaeologicalevidence in the Aisén forests and of the traces ofhuman activity in the forests in Patagonia.
The main problem of the Las Quemas rock-shelter is the lack of an archaeofaunal assemblage.Archaeofauna have been used to highlight the im­portance of forest adaptations in Patagonia (e.g.,Mena 1992; Mena et al. 2004; Pérez and Smith2007) and elsewhere (e.g., Yesner 1989). Faunalrecords at archaeological sites tend to representlocally procured prey instead of the overall sub­sistence choices of mobile peoples (Barberenaand Borrero 2005:192). In an earlier paper, weaddressed average regional dietary choices by an­alyzing stable isotope data from available humanremains. We preliminarily concluded that terres­trial mammals from steppe environments werethe primary source of protein (Méndez et al. 2014).This view is consistent with the low contribution of forest prey, such as huemul, to the overall ar­chaeofaunal record in Patagonia (Fernández et al.2015).
Other sites in the forests and on the forest-steppe boundary in Aisén between 45°20’ and 47°S, e.g., Punta del Monte cave, the Fontana rock-shelter, Las Guanacas cave, and the Gianella rock-shelter, share the limited evidence for human oc­cupation that we have described for Las Quemas(Fuentes et al. 2012; Mena 1983, 1992; NuevoDelaunay et al. 2013). Punta del Monte yieldedno archaeological material in its stratigraphic de­posits (Nuevo Delaunay et al. 2013:132). Datarecovered from the Gianella rockshelter revealed a density of 28.5 lithics per m2 (Fuentes et al.2012), which is very similar to the 25.3 lithics per m2 recovered at Las Quemas. Despite archae­ological testing, other caves in the region, such asLomo de Dragón and El Divisadero, have yieldedno archaeological remains (Méndez et al. 2013).Visibility may be one of the major factors that in­fluence an archaeologist’s ability to locate sitesin this area. Even though the main population cen­ters and the vast majority of rural communities inthis region are currently located in forests, fortu­itous findings of archaeological sites are not com­mon (Méndez and Reyes 2015).
In summary, despite the availability of naturallysheltered venues, human presence in the forestsin continental Patagonia south of 42° S appearsto be of low intensity. This has been suggestedfor several other forested regions (e.g., San Martín,Tar, Viedma, and Argentino lakes, and the Galle­gos headwaters) that were sampled with differentmethodological approaches, including the studyof regional taphonomy and targeting erosional ar­eas (e.g., Belardi and Carballo Marina 2014; Bor­rero and Muñoz 1999; Charlin et al. 2011). Indeed,Borrero and Borrazzo (2011) have indicated, basedon historical accounts, that more recent popula­tions in this area of Patagonia avoided the forestsand its main resource, the huemul. 
The most plausible scenario for explaining thebasal age of 11,810–12,070 cal B.P. is the occur­rence of a significant fire episode. This may havebeen the cause of the intense black charcoal asso­ciated with SU4 and would have been contempo­raneous with the maximum fire episode recordedby de Porras et al. (2014:1070) in Mallín El Em­budo no more than 13 km away. We cannot com­pletely rule out human agency in producing suchdatable material, given that the El Chueco 1 siteyielded one dated human occupational event at11,500 cal B.P. (Méndez et al. 2011). At Las Que-mas, however, no archaeological material was as­sociated with the earliest radiocarbon date. Be-

cause the sample was located directly under rooffall particles, a non-human origin of the charcoalis quite likely.
The depositional rate at Las Quemas limits ourunderstanding of sedimentary dynamics. Withinclose depth proximities, we recorded dates of~11,940, 6110, and 2950–2400 cal B.P. This sug­gests either a possible interruption in sedimenta­tion or an erosive disconformity. During the periodof maximum forest expansion caused by an in­crease in effective moisture between ~9500 and 3000 cal B.P. (de Porras et al. 2012, 2014), thesedimentation rate appears to have stopped. Themassive rock fall does not present an easily inter­preted, horizontally layered context.
The first occupation at Las Quemas dating to5990–6270 cal B.P. coincides with radiocarbon dates obtained at the base of the Fontana rock-shelter and Las Guanacas cave for the initial oc­cupations of the Ibáñez basin (Mena 1983, 1992)and, to a lesser extent, the 5590–5750 cal B.P. dateat Punta del Monte (Nuevo Delaunay et al. 2013).All these occupations are significantly limited intheir extent and discard rates. In each case, lateHolocene reoccupations are separated by millen­nia-long hiatus (e.g., Las Guanacas hiatus: ~5620years; Fontana first hiatus: ~3440 years; Fontanasecond hiatus ~1400 years; Lucero and Mena2000) similar to the one recorded at Las Quemas(~3160 years). During the mid-Holocene occupa­tions of these sites, forests reached their maximumeastward extensions, coverage, and density, as sug­gested by paleoenvironmental data in Cisnes andareas further south (de Porras et al. 2012, 2014;Villa-Martínez et al. 2012). Closed-canopy condi­tions may have constrained exploration in this en­vironment (Borrero 1989–1990). As ethnographicstudies have shown, the exploration of new terri­tory is challenging and has low success rates dueto limited environmental experience and inade­quate information networks (Borrero 2015).
At least three occupational events were recordedin the occupational block that dated from 2400 to2950 cal B.P. These are interpreted as recurringvisits over a ~550-year period. Initially, it was ar­gued that the limited carrying capacity of the steppeduring that period acted as a trigger for expandingmobility ranges into the west (Méndez and Reyes2008). This hypothesis is now supported by localpaleoenvironmental reconstructions on centennial to millennial scales, which show lower effectivemoisture beginning around 3000 cal B.P. (de Porraset al. 2012). The paleoenvironmental data coincidewith the onset of the documented human occupa­tions in the area and provide a strong case for thecollation of human and environmental records (Sandweiss and Quilter 2012). Paleoenvironmentalrecords indicate that the forest-steppe ecotone-typeboundary moved westward by that time (de Porraset al. 2012) and that forests in the central Cisnesbasin had an open canopy (de Porras et al. 2014).Lower productivity and cooler winters on thesteppe (~900 m asl) may have promoted seasonallivelihoods at lower elevations and along routessuch as the Cisnes River. The open canopy wouldhave facilitated resource acquisition, orientation,and information gathering and enabled repeatedvisits to sites like Las Quemas.
The lithic material (e.g., blades, frontal scrap­ers) found at Las Quemas is not distinguishablein terms of typology from assemblages of similarage recovered in the nearby steppe (e.g., ElChueco 1, Méndez et al. 2011). The obsidianfound at the site was procured from sources inthe eastern Cisnes Valley and from Pampa delAsador, the most exploited source in the region(Stern et al. 2013:248). Rock art is also a sharedtrait. The main motif at Las Quemas is the tri­digit, which is interpreted as a flightless bird track.Rhea pennata inhabits only open steppes (Kusch and Henríquez 2011). Although animal represen­tations do not necessarily reflect the immediateenvironment, it is suggestive that forest occupantsin Aisén (including Las Guanacas, Fontana, andPunta del Monte) used motifs characteristic of thesteppe. This case has been argued for northernPatagonia, where a cladistic analysis of rock artshowed no clear distinction between rock art from the forest and the steppe (Scheinsohn et al. 2009).
Use-wear traces positively identified wood­working at Las Quemas. The low frequency ofutilized edges, however, does not indicate a tar­geted use of wooden materials. The performanceof distinct activities at the Las Quemas rockshelter,working of wood with different types of tools(blade and flake), and edge modifications (re­touched and unretouched), suggest non-specificfunctional orientations. This differs from the coast of Aisén, where occupations show forest-specifictechnologies (Reyes et al. 2015).

Conclusions 
There is no unique way to occupy forests (e.g.,Gamble 1999). This variability may be caused bythe range in population densities of hunter-gath­erers living in cold forests (Kelly 1995:222). Thediversity in human occupation of forest environ­ments is undoubtedly related to carrying capacity(Steele et al. 1998). The Cisnes River Basin is anideal corridor for accessing different ecologicalzones and acts as an appropriate scale for mea­suring the differential human uses of environmentsin Central Western Patagonia. Sites within thisbasin reveal change in human occupation overtime, which can be compared to the evolution offorests regionally. The decrease in available re­sources caused by low effective moisture levelsaround 3000 cal B.P. may have triggered a seriesof human excursions into the forest. The lower-elevation open-canopy forests around Las Quemaslikely attracted populations living on the cold, drysteppes on a seasonal basis. Overlapping datesfrom the Las Quemas and El Toro rockshelters(Méndez and Reyes 2008) identify an 800-yeartime span during which mobility ranges through­out the Cisnes basin expanded into forests.
With respect to the mid-Holocene occupation,years of archaeological research in the regionshow similar dates for the initial occupations ofthe forest and the forest margins in Aisén. Giventhe paleoenvironmental reconstructions of theCisnes basin and surrounding region, the forestwas dense and closed by that time. As a result,people would have faced major challenges in re­source acquisition, displacement, and communi­cation. Because all of the sites show evidence of a millennium-long hiatus after their initial humanoccupation, human use of this environment shouldalso be viewed as discontinuous. 
The data from the Aisén region suggests thatthe human occupation of forests was linked toareas farther to the east. This study has shownthat seasonal occupations of forests were of lowintensity and did not constitute year-round forestdwellings. Borrero (2004:60) suggests that forestswere geographically marginal areas that were oc­cupied by hunter-gatherers associated with pop­ulation nuclei located in the open steppes. Mar­ginal areas can provide information about processes that occurred at larger scales (Veth 1993); they may be more sensitive to changes inmobility and settlement patterns at local and re­gional scales, as shown by the archaeologicalrecords at the Las Quemas rockshelter and theCisnes Basin.
