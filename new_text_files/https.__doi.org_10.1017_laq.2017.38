TEMPORALITIESOFLATECLASSICTOPOSTCLASSIC (CA.AD 600–1521)MAYAFIGURINESFROMCENTRAL PETÉN,GUATEMALA 
ChristinaT.Halperin 
Maya .gurine styles from the Late Classic to Postclassic periods (ca. AD 600–1521) from central Petén, Guatemala undergo an abrupt change at the Terminal Classic-Postclassic transition (ca. AD 830–1000). Despite the intimate association of .gurines with households, such shifts parallel those on stone monuments and decorated vessels, underscoring the role of .gurines in processes of political upheaval. Documenting .gurine chronologies over broad periods of time, however, tells us little about how people in the past may have experienced temporal changes. Thus, in concert with a focus on .gurine chronologies, this article explores the temporalities of .gurines as manifested through their discard, the simultaneous experience of old and new .gurine styles, and tensions between personal and monumental time. 
Los estilos de las .gurillas Mayas del centro de Petén, Guatemala, desde el Clásico tardío hasta el Posclásico (ca. 600–1521 dC), muestran un cambio abrupto en la transición entre el Clásico terminal y el Posclásico (830–1000 dC). A pesar de la estrecha asociación entre .gurillas y espacios domésticos, tales cambios son análogos a los que ocurrieron en monumentos de piedra y vasijas polícromas, lo cual resalta el papel de las .gurillas en los procesos de crisis política. Sin embargo, el registro cronológico de las .gurillas durante largos períodos de tiempo nos ofrece pocas indicaciones sobre las experiencias individuales de dichos cambios temporales. Por lo tanto, en conjunto con un enfoque sobre la cronología de las .gurillas, este artículo explora cómo se mani.estan las temporalidades de las mismas a través de las prácticas de descartar .gurillas, la experiencia simultánea de viejos y nuevos estilos de .gurillas y las tensiones entre tiempo personal y tiempo monumental.

rchaeological conceptions of timehave increasingly regarded temporality— humanexperiencesof time—asameans of thinking about ancient societies and the mak­ingofhistory.Forexample, archaeological and historical research has turned to smaller, more personal time-scales of history to understand how large-scale structural changes were repro­duced by human agents in particular social, cultural, and historical contexts (Braudel 1992; Pauketat 2001; Robb and Pauketat 2013). In addition, a focus on memory, ruins, and the multiplicity of temporal scales has challenged our conceptions of a neat progression of time to underscore the temporal mixing and unevenness of social experience (Dawdy 2010; Stanton and Magnoni 2008; Van Dyke and Alcock 2003). These approaches represent a shiftawayfrom cultural-historytypologies and sweeping chronologies in which ancient peoples are seen as undifferentiated masses whose accu­mulated actions unknowingly changed material culture styles—and thus “culture”—over the course of manycenturies. 
These different temporal perspectives relate to tensions in the scales, paces, and conscious­ness of time. Rather than discard one approach for another, this paper captures the temporal multiplicity of the past to tease out where such tensions may lie. Such a multiscalar approach is particularly .ttingforexaminingthe Classic to Postclassic period transition in the Southern Maya Lowlands, because there are continued effortstowardviewing this period not asasingle moment when ClassicMaya polities collapsed, butasavaried and complex processexperienced

Critical Re.ections on Chronology and 
Temporality 

Figurines have often been denigrated as some of the most static components of culture. Per­haps the most extreme of such characteriza­tionsis theirblanket associationwitha “mother goddess” and concepts of female fertility tran­scendingvast geographic, cultural, and temporal zones,stretchingovermanythousandsof years, fromthe UpperPaleolithic to theNeolithic and beyond (Gimbutas 1982, 1989), a characteriza­tion much critiqued on a number of grounds (ConkeyandTringham 1998;Meskell 1995).In turn, because .gurines in manyparts of ancient Mesoamericaare recoveredindomestic contexts, itis often easytointerpret such material objects as the bearersoflong-term householdtraditions, in contrasttotheevent-drivenpoliticsofthe state documented by the erection of monuments and by hieroglyphictexts detailinghistory withina formal calendar system (Clark and Colman 2008; Iannone 2002). Nonetheless, Maya ceramic .g­urines and thepractices surrounding them were anything but static. Such changes need to be viewed on a human scale to understand how

different peopleexperienced theirlives, and the material culture thatwasa partofthem. 
One of the foundations of archaeological conceptionsof timeisa progressive chronology, identi.ed through gradual changes in artifact styles, architecture, and archaeological assem­blages. In general, Enlightenment notions of history underscore a linear movement of time, in which events and, in turn, material culture patterns, are seen as sequential. The etic chronologies of ceramic styles embody broad periodsoftimecreated notbyasingle generation, but by the seemingly unconscious collective actions of many generations (Binford 1981). These large-scale temporal periods capture particular traditions, habitus, and structures (Bourdieu 1977; Braudel 1960; Sahlins 1985). The .gurine chronologies established here are identi.ed by ceramic vessel cross-dating, whichhave been tiedtoradiocarbon dates with assessmentsfor theLateClassic(Tepeu1 and 2 ceramic phases; ca. AD 600–830), Terminal Classic(Tepeu3 ceramic phase, ca. AD 830– 950/1000), and Postclassic(ca.AD 1000–1521) (seeRiceandForsyth 2004fora comparisonof ceramic phase chronologiesbyregion).Because of poor stratigraphy and overlapping ceramic styles between the Early and Late Postclassic periods, the Postclassic is treated collectively here with some notes on whether or not .gurine styles persistoverthe entire period. 
One of the critiques of culture-historical typologiesisthatthepeopleofthepastare treated as undifferentiated masses with little agency. Thus, a major shift in archaeological conception of time has been to adoptapractice-based per­spectivefollowing theworkofPierreBourdieu, AnthonyGiddens, and Marshall Sahlins, among others, in which change is centered on the day­to-day practices and actions of people who are structuredby theweightof traditionbut simul­taneously rework these traditions, their habitual behaviors,andthestructuresof society(Hegmon andKulow 2005;Pauketat2001;Robb2008). 
Such reproductions may manifest on differ­ent temporal scales. Ruth Van Dyke (2008), for example, refers to small-scale quantitative changes asaprocessofdialectical tensions that revolvearound an attempttomaintainthe status quo (compare also evolutionary biology ideas of punctuated equilibrium and Romer’s rule). Small-scale quantitative changes,however, may intentionally or unintentionally lead to a tip­ping point in which dialectical tensions must be resolved by a total transformation, a large-scale qualitative change.Although the qualita­tive change appears abrupt,itemerges within the context of small, repetitive quantitative trans­formations. Indeed, changes in Maya ceramic .gurines alsoexhibitdifferent scalesof change, with some shifts more abrupt than others. 
Moreover, the experience of time is often unevenorjumbled because not allthings start and end simultaneously and because references tothepastareevokedto manageand reconstitute thepresent.The recent focus on social memory in archaeology,forexample, has underscored the centralroleofheirlooms,forgottenorlost objects that are found, ruins, and ancient landscapes in remaking the present (Stanton and Magnoni 2008;Van Dyke and Alcock2003). Rather than a progression from old to new, older objects and landscapes coexist with newer ones.Walter Benjamin (2002:461), for example, promoted the idea of history as a montage in which a singlemoment holds elementsofmultiple,differ­ent pasts.Whereas many previous studies have examinedthewaysin which ancient peoplehave treated objects and landscapes from distant pasts as sacred and as a means to evoke notions of ancestors and otherworlds,Iconsider thejuxta­position and overlap of temporally close objects with social meanings and values that may be ambiguousdueto theircloserproximitiesinage. 
Anotherway of examiningtemporal uneven­nessistoconsider multiple scalesoftimeandthe intersection or tension between them. Annales School historian Fernand Braudelfamously rec­ognized multiple temporal scales in which his­tory unfolds: the longue durée of geological and environmental structures, the medium-term socioeconomic cycles of conjunctures, and the short-term sociopolitical events or l’histoire événementielle (Braudel 1960; Knapp 1992). Despite his tendency to view the large-scale structures as determining, Braudel and other Annales School historians sought to bring ordinary peopleintohistory—peoplepreviously eclipsedby of.cial historiespresented asevent­based narrativesofkings and conquests (Bloch

1966; Braudel 1960, 1992). Likewise, Michael Herzfeld’s(1991:10) study of cultural heritage on theCretan coastaltownofRethemnos points to the ways in which social time, “the grist of everyday experience,” often comes into con.ict with monumental time, an of.cial history and conceptualizationofthe pastpromoted and con­trolledbythe state.Forthe ancient Maya, rulers and priestsmeticulously recorded, presidedover key ceremonial events and associated monu­mental publicworksprojectsmarkedinvarious calendar systems(Clark and Colman 2008;Rice 2008). In doing so, they sancti.ed a particular “monumental” temporal order and a collective way of experiencing the world. 
What Herzfeld calls social timeoverlaps with what feminist and phenomenological studies have referred to as personal time (Gilchrist 1999;Gosden1994)—thetemporalitiesformed through more personaland moreeverydayevents and routines.Inturn,Iuse theterm personal time to think about how .gurines were implicated in everyday householdroutinesand ritualsandhow such temporalities were linked to or contrasted with themonumental timeoflarge-scale collec­tive activities, public ceremonies, and of.cially sanctioned timekeeping. Before I explore such temporalities, I outline the chronology of .g­urinestylesfromthe Late Classicto Postclassic periods. 
Figurine Chronologies 
Although changes in ceramic .gurine pastes, technologies,iconographies, and formsare sub­tle between theLateClassic(Tepeu1and2) and Terminal Classic(Tepeu 3) periods, an abrupt shiftin ceramic .gurinestyle occurred between the Terminal Classic and Postclassic periods. These changes roughly coincide with thosefound on decorated pottery and stone monuments. In contrast, utilitarian vessels and, to some extent, monochromeservingvessels oftenexhibitamore gradual progression and overlap between these temporal phases, at least in regions with con­tinuous occupation(Cecil 2001;Graham 1987; Howie 2012;Rice 1987:90–91). 
In most cases, Terminal Classic period ceramic .gurines from central Petén were indis­tinguishable versions of earlier Late Classic precedents(Table2).Terminal Classic .gurine producers continued to make .gurines with the same Petén GlossWare pastesasinearlier times. These pastesare similartothoseusedtoproduce serving wares and often contain ash temper or relatively .ne-sized inclusions. Terminal Clas­sic producers also continued to shape .gurines using the same techniques to create the same arrayof.gurinemanufacturingtypes.Likewise, manyoftheiconographicthemes werethesame, with similar gender ratios, supernatural .gures, zoomorphic characters, and human representa­tions (Halperin 2012, 2014a; Horcajada 2011; Sears 2016). 
Nonetheless, a new suite of “diagnostic” Terminal Classic .gurines appears alongside Terminal Classic period .gurines that were replicationsof earlierLateClassic .gurinestyles (Figure2). ThediagnosticTerminal Classic .g­urines are a mix of Late Classic and new Terminal Classic features rather than a com­plete transformation. In this sense, they seem to manifest small, quantitative changes.Asin earlierLateClassic .gurinetraditions,they are hollow, molded ocarinas (Type 1) with Petén Gloss Ware pastes, but they differ slightly in a number of features. One of their de.ning features is that they arelarger in size than Late Classic .gurines, although even size differences occur onacontinuum (Supplementary Figure1). They also sometimes depict long hair, parted in the center, with detailing of hair strands. Some possess tubular nose ornaments; or wear relatively simple clothing or adornment. Some of the male .gurines wear decapitated heads, either around the neck or hanging from the belt, in additiontothe holdingof weapons(Figures3, 4,5).Although noneof thesefeatures arewithout earlierprecedent, certain trends referenceapref­erenceaway fromelaborate costuming, coiffures (such as the stepped haircut seen commonly on women or short bangs found on men), and headdresses (large, masked headdresses with fan-shaped feather sprays). This emphasis away fromelaborateornamentationand dressisshared by imagery in some Terminal Classic molded and modeled carvedvesselsandTerminal Classic stone monuments(Adams 1971;Graham1973; Just 2006;Proskouriakoff1950)(Figures3e,5e, Supplementary Figure5d).

In comparison to other .gurines in theMaya area, the diagnostic Terminal Classic .gurines from central Petén aresimilartoFineOrange or near Fine Orange “Jimba” .gurines fromAltar de Sacri.cios, with theJimba phase designated as circaAD900–948(Willey 1972:55–57), and rare Fine Orange .gurines from Ceibal (Wil­ley 1978:21–22). These Fine Orange .gurines sharefeatures with the central Petén diagnostic Terminal Classic .gurines,albeitproduced with different pastes. AdoptionofdiagnosticTerminal Classic .gurine styles, however, was uneven acrossthe SouthernMayaLowlands.Although they appear at the sites of Nixtun-Ch’ich’, Nakum, San Clemente,Tikal, and Zacpeten, with parallels at Altarde Sacri.cios and Ceibal,they have not been identi.ed among .gurine collec­tions from other neighboringsiteswithTerminal Classic occupation, such as MotuldeSan José or Tayasal.Likewise, although diagnosticTerminal Classic .gurineshave been foundatTikal, none of these .gurines appear to possess the tubular nose ornament. Thus, such new, albeit subtle, .gurine changes were not homogeneously adop­tedinthe sameway everywhere. 
Although the above discussion focuses on anthropomorphic .gurines, another Terminal Classic .gurine shift that occurred was the widening adoption of wheeled zoomorphic .g­urines throughout Mesoamerica. They appear in the Terminal Classic .gurine assemblages from San Clemente (SC177, SC022),Nixtun­Ch’ich’ (NC087), and Tikal (PP7TT206; see also Sears 2016:100–101 for the site of Can­cuén; Figure5). The earliest known appear­anceof wheeled .gurinesin Mesoamericaisat the end of the Classic period, in central Ver­acruz and at Teotihuacan. During the Terminal Classic/Early Postclassic period(ca. AD 950– 1100), their distribution widened to northern Veracruz, other partsof centralMexicosuch as Tula, and El Salvador (Diehl and Mandeville 1987). 
In contrast to the .gurine changes from the Late to Terminal Classic periods, a substantial rupturein.gurinestyle and use occured between the Terminal Classic and Postclassic periods, underscoringwhatVanDyke(2008)callsalarge­scale quantitative change.Most Postclassic .gu­rines from central Petén are not ocarinas.Instead they are hollow .gurines that either stood on a .at surface or were suspended on a string. Perforated suspension holes are a common feature among Postclassic .gurines throughout Mesoamerica(Klein and Lona 2009;Overholtzer 2012; Parsons 1972; Patel 2012:245–246), and the hollow shape with open base is a form shared with Postclassic .gurines from northern Yucatan and northernBelize(Chase and Chase 2008; Graham 1991; Masson and Peraza Lope 2011, 2010:85–88; Smith 1971:56–59, 98–99), as well as Late Classic .gurines from thePaci.c Coast of Guatemala (Castillo Aguilar et al. 2008). 
Twomajor Postclassic .gurinemanufacturing types are noted: Type I and Type II (use of Roman numeralstodistinguish them from earlier Late Classictypologies,but such an application should notbe confused with CentralMexican or Veracruz typologies). Bothversions were slipped to some degree. Such surface treatment is in contrast with earlierLateClassic andTerminal Classic .gurines, which were unslipped, but sometimes post-.re painted.1 The Type I .gu­rines arethe most common and are characterized by molded fronts, plain, modeled backs, and openings at the base(Figures6,7,8, Supple­mentary Figure2). Theirsuspension holes indi­catethat the .gurines mayhave been strung or hung, adding to their capacity to stand upright on a bench, altar, or some other type of .at surface. It is unlikelythat these .gurines served as rattlessimilartoAztecTypeI.gurines (Otis Charlton 2001;Overholtzer2012;Parsons1972), becausethe central Petén .gurine bases were left open.2 Thesuspension holes for centralMexican .gurines have sometimes been interpreted in relation to Diego Durán’s remarks that Aztec children wore .gurines around their necks and wristsaspartofritualstowardoffeviland illness and that Aztec people suspended idols over corn.elds to ensure health and fertility (Klein and Lona 2009;Otis Charlton2001;Overholtzer 2012).Similarpractices mayhaveexisted forthe PostclassicMaya. 
A variety of sizes and styles exist among the central Petén Postclassic Type I .gu­rines. Nonetheless, they share general traits with Postclassic styles broadly seen through­out Mesoamerica, such as stocky bodily forms,

sharp angular facial features, and stiff poses (Boone and Smith 2003;Roberston1970),stray­ing from Classic period Maya artistic works in their realistic and more .uid treatments of the body.

anatomical features),alarge majority appear to represent females(85%, n = 11 female .gurines; 15%, n = 2male .gurines; .gurines with gender unidenti.ed not included [comparealsoMaya­pan with 88%, n = 143 female .gurines; 12%, n = 18 male .gurines;31 .gurines with gender unidenti.ed not included, Masson and Peraza Lope 2011:Table1]). This emphasis on molded feminine .gures differs from earlier Late and Terminal Classicperiodsinwhichbothmalesand femalesweremore equally represented (Halperin 2014a). It also contrasts with other forms of Postclassic iconographic media, such as ef.gy ceramic censers, stone sculptures, murals, and manuscripts,whichoverwhelmingly depict male deities, noblemen, and warriors (Milbrath 2007; Vail and Stone2002;cf. Chase and Chase2008). Nonetheless, this new focus on feminine .gu­rines is shared by Postclassic molded .gurines throughout Mesoamerica, such as theGulfCoast and Central Mexico (Klein and Lona 2009; Masson and Peraza Lope 2010;Patel2012). 
All Type I female .gurines from the cen­tral Petén collection examined here wear a quechquemitl and skirt(Figure7a–d, g). Such clothing styles were present in CentralMexico, Oaxaca, and theGulfCoastregionasearly as the Classic period(Anawalt 1982;Martínez López and Winter 1994), but did not become popular in the Petén until the Postclassic period. In most parts of Mesoamerica, this triangular tunic is reserved primarily for female deities, ritual specialists, and ceremonial wear (Anawalt 1982), and women engaged in quotidian activities are more often depicted with a skirt and exposed chest or a nontriangular huipil.Thus,the central Petén female .gurines may depict esteemed and sacred .gures because they also wear elaborate necklaces and headdresses (albeit often very eroded).One female .gurinealso holdsacircular object, perhaps a mirror, and another holds a smallbag, perhapsacopalbag(Figure7b,c). 
Despite the predominance of Type I female .gurines,Ihave identi.edasmall percentageof maleTypeI .gurines(Figure8). They possess .at exposed chests, loincloths, and necklaces. Because no complete examples in the collection exist,itis dif.culttoidentifywho these .gures appeartohaverepresented.Acompletespecimen housed in theMuseo San Bernabé(Figure8a), a private museum just off the shore of Flores, depictsthe Late Postclassic deityof .re, Xiuhte­cuhtli, identi.edby his horned headdress,fang­liketeeth, and seated position, allfeatures found on the Xiuhtecuhtli stone sculptures cached in the Templo Mayor from Tenochtitlan (López Luján 2005:139–148, 241–242).Another seated Xiuhtecuhtli .gurine with red slip is currently housed at the American Museum of Natural History(Cat.No. 30.0/2217),andis reportedas derivingfromFlores, Guatemala. Thesemuseum specimenshaveathick redslip,similartosome of the Postclassic .gurines in the archaeological collectionstudied here, including thefew male .gurine bodies identi.ed.

Theothermanufacturingtype amongthePost­classic .gurines from central Peténisamodeled .gurinelabeled hereasTypeII(Figure6i–k). Modeled .gurines can be divided into zoomor­phic specimens and extremely crude anthropo­morphicspecimens.In both cases,the .gurines tend to have coarse pastes used for utilitarian vessels (such as Uaxactun unslipped wares and Montículo unslippedwares).Forthe zoomorphic .gurines, modeling is relatively simple with globularly shaped bodies and facial forms that oftenfollowthe stylistic conventionsof modeled Postclassic .gurines from northernBelize, such as the bead-shapedeyes (Chase and Chase 1988, 2008;Pendergast1998).Thecrude anthropomor­phic examples are extremely abstract with little detailing and resemble other crude examples from centralMexico(Brum.el and Overholtzer 2009:303–307; Olson 2007:Fig 9.3). Although crudelymodeled .gurine-whistles and -ocarinas do not appear to have received any special treatment duringthe Late andTerminal Classic periods,theseseeminglysimple .gurinestakeon important sacred rolesinthe Postclassic period, as elaborated further below.

Classicto Postclassic periods,Isituate .gurines within the context of practice. As such, broad-based changes can be understood at the level of human decision-making, agency, and expe­rience. Indeed, many material culture changes mayhavegone unnoticed, as Maya communities gradually reproduced and altered their prac­tices, production techniques, and worldviews over time. Nonetheless, critical events can also encapsulate and serve to punctuate such broad changes in step-like fashion. One of the many critical events in the lifecycle of Maya house­holds was the creation of termination deposits. I argue that these events disrupted the habitual routine of daily life to allow ancient people to re.ect on theirlives, and thus provided moments to either reproduce existing practices or shift course. 
Ethnohistorical sources suggestthat termina­tion deposits were tiedtokeyeventsinthe calen­dar system.Forexample,DiegodeLanda(Tozzer 1941:151–152) reports thatYucatec Maya New Year’s festivities were celebrated by throwing out householdimplements, sweeping homes, and discarding trash in a dump outside of town. Likewise,Bernardinode SahagúnandhisNahua collaborators detail how Nahua peoples com­memorated the 52-year cycle with a New Fire ceremony in which household members ritu­ally broke their household goods and disposed of them as part of a broader cycle of ritual cleansing and renewal events led by the Aztec state(Hamann 2008;Sahagún1970).Thesewere key moments when personal and monumental time intersected, as the discarding practices of household routines were also coordinated and objecti.ed on a more grandiose scale by the Aztec state. 
In the archaeological record, termination deposits, sometimes labeled “termination ritu­als,” “ritual deposits,” and “special deposits” (Halperin and Foias 2016; Lucero 2008;New­man 2015; Stanton et al. 2008), are recog­nized as on-.oor trash deposits scattered and dumpedoverpreviously usable occupationsur­faces. These deposits were often accompa­nied by extensive evidence of burning, deposi­tions of white marl, or architectural destruction. The intentionality and meaning behind these deposits,such as whether or not theywere actsof reverential destruction by building inhabitants, timed events related to ceremonial period end-ings,orviolent acts, perhaps undertakenbythose external to the household, remain controversial. Itisnotmy intentionheretoaddtothese debates. Rather,I point to the underlyingimportance of these deposits in marking critical moments in the lives of those living in such buildings or participatinginsuch acts,regardlessoftheinten­tionality behind them.They are critical because they mark a change from usable to unusable space and a disruption in the lives of those living there. Furthermore, the amount of trash left behind was often enormous, underscoring a substantial removal of goods from use and circulation. 
Many of the Terminal Classic .gurines within the archaeological collections examined here were a part of such domestic termination deposits.Inthe Plazade losSieteTemplosatthe site ofTikal,Terminal Classic(Eznab ceramic phase, ca.AD 850–950) peoplerecon.gured the Late Classic architectural layout of the southern buildings to convert them from open temples or administrativebuildings to closed-room palaces suitable for habitation (Gómez 2007; Supple­mental Figure3).Overthe courseofliving there, theseTerminal Classicinhabitantsleftmiddens behind (to the south of) these buildings, as is typical of domestic midden deposition patterns in the Maya area. Archaeologists recovered 95 .gurines (47% of Late-Terminal Classic .g­urines excavated from the Siete Templos exca­vations; 22,291 ceramic sherds were recovered with the .gurines)inlarge on-.oor trash deposits blocking the entrance of the southern palaces, with theirgreatest concentrationinfront of Str. 5D-90. This deposit was the .nal act before thebuildingwas permanently abandoned. These domestic trash deposits were unlikethe domestic middens found behind the building; the size of the ceramic sherds was much larger, and there was a higher quantity of re.ts (some­times as much as 95% of a vessel could be reconstructed). 
Similarly, at the site of San Clemente, the largest quantitiesof artifactsrecovered fromthe site derived from threelarge middens within an elite residential courtyard(Salas 2006; Supple­mental Figure 4). They were located directly

on the patio .oor and steps in front of Build­ings III, IV, VII and XXIV as well as within the room of Building VII. Such heavy traf.c areas would normally have been swept clean, but archaeologists recovered huge deposits of domestic trash 13–15 cm deep and containing over 23,000 sherds.Two hundred and .fty-.ve .gurines were excavated from these on-.oor deposits.LiketheTikalexample above,a large numberof ceramicvesseland .gurinere.tswere identi.ed.Inaddition,the deposit appearstohave beenburntorassociated withburning activities because the artifacts were mixed with a gray soil containing high concentrations of ash. These deposits were the .nal act before inhabitants abandoned this living space. 
At Nakum, archaeologists uncovered .gu­rines fromalargeTerminal Classic(Tepeu3) midden deposit interpretedby archaeologiststo be theresultofa possibleterminationritual.The deposit coveredthe .oorof Structure99inthe NorthAcropolis (Zralka and Hermes 2012:174). In addition to .gurines, it contained broken ceramic vessels, adzes, and fragments of manos (groundstone tools). Like the other deposits, someof thevessels couldbealmostfully recon­structed (Zralka and Hermes 2012:Figure 21). 
Although the Terminal Classic termination deposits clearly marked abrupt endings to some prominent households,such actsare not without precedent. Even though termination deposits are most abundant in the archaeological record during the Terminal Classic period, they have a long history dating back to the Preclassic period and were often part of the cycle of building dedication, destruction, and rebuilding (Lucero 2008; Stanton et al. 2008). Regardless of whether or not such deposits were part of rituals timed to calendar-period endings, part of violent actsbynon-householdmembers,oraway to dispose of household items before moving elsewhere,I suggestthat they presented critical moments to reject or forget earlier practices and material culture, especially when such acts were paired with the physical displacement of inhabitantstonew locations,suchasinthe cases mentioned above.Thus,whileTerminal Classic periodtermination depositshave the potentialto stimulate qualitative changes, they derive from larger structural patterns. 
TemporalJuxtapositions 
Some things change, but others may stay the same. In this sense, our experience of time is not just as a progression (cyclical or linear), but also as mixed and jumbled. Such temporal juxtapositions are apparent in the simultaneous useofdiagnosticTerminal ClassicandLateClas­sic style .gurines during the Terminal Classic period. Juxtaposed styles haveoften been treated as differences between cultures, ethnicities, regional groups, or communities of producers. I propose that diagnostic Terminal Classic and Late Classic styles may have referenced ideas of newness and traditionthat were contemplated in relationto one another.Unlike curated items, heirlooms, and ancient ruins which make refer­enceto distantand sacred pasts,the “traditional” examined heremay reference conservatism(Late Classic style within Terminal Classic contexts) caught within a changing social and political order (diagnosticTerminal Classicstyles). 
Both diagnostic Terminal Classic and Late Classic style .gurines are found mixed in the same levels and in the same middens (Adams 1971:144; Willey 1972:55–57). Such mixing includes termination deposits, which appear to derive from use contexts rather than as a grad­ual accumulation of trash over the course of many generations. In this sense, the two styles appear to reference a co-existence during the Terminal Classic period rather than a simple replacement of one by the other. Likewise, while GordonWilley(1972:55–57) placed the stylistically different Jimba phase(ca. AD 900– 948) .gurines in a later time period than the more traditional Late Classic style Boca phase .gurines (ca. AD 800–900), he found that the two were consistently found mixed with each other and suggestedthat they were coeval. Such juxtapositions mayeven occur on thesame .gu­rine.Forexample, oneTerminal Classic .gurine fromthe site ofYaxha depictstwo hairstyles on thesamemale .gure: long .owing hair, whichis more typical duringtheTerminal Classic period, and a short, fringed hairstyle, which is more typical of .gurines of the Late Classic period (Supplementary Figure5). 
Such simultaneous temporal juxtapositions can be seen in other media, such as the ninth-

century stone monuments of Ceibal, Petén, Guatemala.3 Many of these monuments exhibit non-Classic traits, what John Graham ear­lier characterized as ‘Facies B’ representations (Figure3e),which mayhave not onlyembodied a sense of foreignness, as has been previously considered, but also a sense of newness that contrastedwithamoretraditionalor conservative order identi.ed with a long history of Classic renderingsofMaya rulership(Graham 1973;Just 2006;Proskouriakoff1950:150–153).Bryan Just (2006).nds that the emergence of non-Classic traits (such as the ¾ pose, square hieroglyphs, necklaces as a single string of round beads, as well as simply rendered clothing and hairstyles) in the ninth-century Ceibal monuments was piece-meal and eclectic, interspersed chrono­logically with more “Classic” stelae styles. In one unique example, these different styles are juxtaposed side-by-side on thesamemonument, Stela17(Supplementary Figure5d).And as at many sites, older and newer monuments could be experienced simultaneously, as peo­ple moved through the different parts of the site (O’Neil 2012). Site inhabitants and visitors from afar could re.ect upon and reconstitute notionsof old and newwithin thesamephysical space. 
Such temporal juxtapositions also mayhave occurred in the Postclassic, although no clear examples of simultaneous use of Classic and Postclassic style .gurines have been iden­ti.ed in the .gurine sample under investi­gation. More evident, however, is the con­trast between these two periods in the way in which .gurines were incorporated into everyday life and of.cial public rites and performances. 
Personal and MonumentalTime 
Because .gurinesaresmalland unimposing,itis easy to assume that they were implicated in the intimate and personal experiences of those who produced and handled such objects.Yet, Maya .gurines were both a part of monumental time, the collective experiences and objecti.cation of a temporal order through of.cial practices and media, and personal time, the more everyday, real-lifeexperiencesofindividualsand moreinti­mate social groups.Thewaysin which .gurines intersected these domains,however,was differ­ent forthe Late/Terminal Classic and Postclassic periods. 
Most ceramic .gurines were a component of the everyday imagery and material culture found in and around the household. Late and Terminal Classic period ceramic .gurines from central Petén are most commonly recovered from domestic contexts where they have been excavatedwith other householdtrash in,around, and within the architectural .ll of household compounds (Halperin 2014a). In general, they were notof.cial instrumentsofthe state because they are not depicted in monumental media, are absent from royal or public ritual caches, and are not recovered from on-.oor contexts within temples datingtothe Classic period.For example, archaeologistsworkingin thePlazaof theSevenTemplesofTikal recoveredTerminal Classic .gurines from primary middens almost exclusively from the 5D-90, 5D-91, and 5D-92 southern buildings (97.5%, n = 195 .gurines), which had domestic functions during the Ter­minal Classic period. In contrast, they found only minute frequencies in primary middens surrounding the temples lining the eastern side of theplaza (2.0%, n = 4from eastern temples; 0.5%, n = 1 from the central patio). Although their exact meanings and uses undoubtedly var­ied, their numerical frequency associated with household contexts indicates that .gurines were likelyseen,if not handled,by multiple members of the household(perhaps old and young, adults and children, menandwomen)onaregular basis. 
Despite their ubiquity in household contexts in central Petén during this period, these same .gurines bridged personal and monumental time. AsIhaveargued elsewhere(Halperin 2014a, 2014b), manyofthe .gurines depictedthelively publicaffairsofstate pomp and ceremony,which likely included kingly accession ceremonies, period-ending events, and public festivities. In this sense, .gurines brought monumental time andtheideologiesofthestate intotheeveryday household domains of work, ritual, entertain­ment, and play.Thefact that Late andTerminal Classic .gurines were likely centrally distributed (perhaps at festival-fairs, state ceremonies, or at markets in site centers) also suggests that

even if they were used most commonly in the household, .gurines may also have evoked monumental places and events long after their moment of acquisition(Halperin et al. 2009). Most of the .gurines during this period were ocarinas, wind instruments with the capacity for a limited musical repertoire. Although of.­cial musical ensembles are not depicted with musicians playing .gurine-ocarinas, they may have been played in an unof.cial capacity at large-scale ceremonial events as noisemakers by the crowd (Halperin 2014a, 2014b). In this sense,even peoplealong thesidelines mayhave contributed to the overall success of public events. 
During the Postclassic period, .gurines con­tinued to be an important part of household material cultureandfamily practice(Massonand Peraza Lope 2011; Smith 1971). In contrast to theLate andTerminal Classic periods,I.nd that the role of Postclassic .gurines became more specialized within households, perhaps serving as ritual implements used during speci.c rites of passage, curing rituals, or other household-organized rituals(Klein and Lona 2009;Over­holtzer 2012;Smith2002). Suchashiftis most apparent in the decrease in .gurine frequen­cies from the Late and Terminal Classic to the Postclassic period(Table3), signifyingthat such objectsnolonger possessedtheirprevious ubiquity and accessibility.Nolonger were these .gurines seen all the time. For example, at the Late Classic site of Aguateca, where there is evidence of rapid abandonment, .gurines were found not only in kitchen and storage spaces, but also on benches and sleeping areas where everyday activities were undertaken (Triadan 2007). 
In contrast,Isuggestthat the Postclassic .gu­rines mayhave been partofdiviningor healing kits, and perhaps were taken out and handled duringtimesofneed, illness,orlifecrisesrequir­ing safe passage into new states of being. At Tayasal, one of thefemale .gurines(Figure7b) was recovered with a crystal bead, celt, and projectile point from a possible altar found at the backofaresidentialbuilding, T1106 (Shira­tori 2017). Kingsley(2014:184–186) found that Early Postclassic .gurines fromElZotzclustered near the largest of the Postclassic residential buildings,L9-11, the onlystructurewithasmall altar. At the site of Mayapan, .gurines were found not only in domestic middens, but also in household caches.For instance,a Postclassic female .gurine was cached with .ve skulls in front of a small household shrine in Str. R­100 (Smith and Ruppert 2011:114–115; Figure 10.2, 10.9e).Inturn, their common occurrencein residentialburials at thesite indicates that they commemoratedthe lifecycleofindividualsatthe .nal stage of their earthly existence (Masson and Peraza Lope 2011:120–121). Such practices are in contrast to Late and Terminal Classic .gurinepracticesin central Peténin that ceramic .gurines were common componentsofmiddens, but only rarely deposited in household burials and caches (with theislandof Jaina, Campeche, as an exception) (Halperin 2014a). 
Ethnographicstudies indicatethat some con­temporaryMaya peoples manage and makesense of personal time with the aid of the 260-day calendar,thecycleof20 days and13 numbers whose use dates back to the Preclassic period (Tedlock 1992).Forexample, theK’iche’ Maya residentsofMomostenango consult with Maya day-keepers (ritual specialists) to understand the supernatural forces that rule particular day-number combinations and their relation to per­sonal events such as births, illnesses, business affairs, marriage proposals, omens, and dreams. During the sixteenth century, Bishop Diego de Landa noted that Maya midwives or “sorcer­esses” put “idols of a goddess called Ix Chel” underthebedsofwomenwho wereabouttogive birth(Tozzer 1941:129).IxChel idolswerekept inphysicians’ and sorcerers’ medicinebundles, which also contained divining stones called am (Tozzer 1941:154). These .gurines appear to have been different from the ceramic incense-burning idols that were used during festivi­ties and rituals centered at the temples (Tozzer 1941:131, 157–161). 
Some Postclassic .gurines were also part of monumental time, however, in that they were used in of.cial public rituals performed by priests, priestesses, and political leaders. Inter­estingly, it appears that Postclassic Maya peo­ples acrossthe MayaLowlands viewed modeled zoomorphic .gurines as particularly appropriate for specialized, calendrically timed rituals, a

contrast from the Late and Terminal Classic period.Forexample, atTayasal,my excavations ofasmall Late Postclassicshrine(T247) recov­ered a modeled feline .gurine head in the .ll of thebuilding(Figure6k).Becausethe .gurine head was located at the exact center-point of the building, and because the .ll was clean of other debris,itappearstohave been deliberately cachedintheshrine.This shrinewaslocatedat thevery easternedgeof Postclassicsettlementat thesite and mayhavebeenaboundaryshrinefor the site. 
Many of the central Petén modeled zoomor­phic .gurines resemble thoserecoveredin cache contexts from northernBelize(Pendergast 1998: Figure6.7,6.8). Diane Chase and ArlenChase (2008) argue that Postclassic structure caches were part of the celebration of calendar rituals at Santa Rita Corozal, Belize. These caches contained special vessels .lled with modeled ceramic .gurines and other ritual items. On the basis of their spatial arrangements, number of .gurines, and .gurine imagery, they argue that such deposits were a part of Uayeb or MayaNewYear’sceremoniesas identi.edinthe PostclassicMaya codices and DiegodeLanda’s descriptions of such rites. Modeled zoomorphic .gurines were the most dominant type of .gu­rine in these contexts (73% of the ceramic .gurines from caches [Structures 2, 5, 6, 24, 36, 37, 58, 81, 183, 213, and 218] were mod­eled zoomorphic .gurines; 21% were modeled anthropomorphic humans or deities; theremain­ing 6% were modeled composite zoomorphic­anthropomorphic .gurines). Similarly, Marilyn Masson and Carlos Peraza Lope(2011:121–122) note that the majority of zoomorphic ceramic .gurines at Mayapan were recovered from pub­lic ceremonial architecture(temples, halls, and public shrines) alongside the debris of ef.gy incenseburners, whereas anthropomorphic .gu­rines dominated in domestic contexts. 
Conclusion 
Similartothe relatively abrupt changesof stone monuments and prestige goods (e.g., decorated pottery, ef.gy censers), pronounced shifts in Maya .gurine practices, imagery, and styles occurred between the Classic and Postclas­sic periods in central Petén, Guatemala. Such changes contrast with other types of material cul­ture,such as utilitarian and monochromevessels, whose styles and uses underwent more gradual alterations between the Classic and Postclassic periods.Thus, despite theintimateassociationof .gurines with households, .gurine expressions and practices appear to have been tied to the changing political dynamics occurring between the Classic and Postclassic periods. Perhaps, people rejected Classic forms of political rule and thesocial formsof expressions relatedto it. In turn,the upheavaltothe ceremonial systemof pomp and festivities, which partly stimulated the large-scaleproductionand distributionofClassic period .gurines,mayhave sti.edtheproduction of .gurines and shifted household practices to other types of material expressions. 
Nevertheless, the abrupt or gradual tempos of material-culture style changes tell us little abouthowMaya peoplemayhaveexperienced them. Although some changes may indeed go by unnoticed, I underscore the pivotal role of “trashing” one’s home as one important way ancient Maya peoples experienced and internal­ized change. Regardless of whether or not these were imposed by others or self-in.icted, these acts would have been momentous occasions in the lifecycle of a household or community, allowing people to re.ect on which aspects of their lives were unsatisfactory and which they wanted to continue. These depositional practices were particularly prevalent duringtheTerminal Classic period, and .gurines were commonly a partofthem.Undoubtedly, not all people across the Petén or even across the same settlement may have contemplated the need for change in the same way, and thus, such moments of re.ection and renewal would have been quite diverse. Whereas these deposits have been the focusofmuchpreviousstudy,their possiblerole as linked to decisions and dispositions in the production of material culture styles has been underappreciated. 
The changes in .gurine styles and other forms of material culture, however, were not always neat progressions from one periodtothe next, but jumbled such that new and old could be contemplated in relation to one another. I suggest that “older” Late Classic and “newer”

Terminal Classic .gurine styles were in use simultaneously,creatingtemporal juxtapositions whereby people could contemplateideasof con­servatisminreferencetonewformsof foreign-inspired expressions. Unlike other studies of social memory wheretemporally distant artifacts or landscapes were treated as sacred or linkedto ancestors,the Late Classic andTerminal Classic stylejuxtapositions were temporally closer and allowed tension between more traditional and newer forms of “lived” ideologies. In some cases, such style differences were scalar, such as differences in .gurine size. In other cases, theywere iconographic and emphasizedagrow­ing trend away from the ostentatious display of wealth and power embodied in dress and ornamentation. Such juxtapositions do not indi­cate that one swept in and completely replaced another.Rather, peoplewereawareof and likely contemplated newer and older aesthetics, ideas, and ways of doing things. 
Lastly,.gurines bridgethe personal temposof everyday life and the of.cial and public events of collective life,butdid so differently in each period. During the Late and Terminal Classic periods, ceramic .gurines brought the pomp and circumstance of monumental timeinto both elite and commoner homes. In the home, Late and Terminal Classic ceramic .gurines appear to have been both ubiquitous and accessible to any household member, adults and children alike.Yetduringthe Postclassic period, .gurines were less abundant and more commonlyplaced in caches and burials. Their locations imply a more specialized role in house dedications, births, illnesses, and other lifecycle events of household members, recording and helping the transitions of personal time. Postclassic .gurines also were part of sanctioned and of.cial cer­emonies of monumental time, although priests and other of.cials appear to have preferred to incorporatemodeled zoomorphic .gurines more than other .gurine categories duringtheseevents, a pattern that needs to be con.rmed with further research. 
Although the chronology of .gurines helps us further re.nehowmaterial culture styles changed over this critical time period in Maya history, my focus on practice underscores the varied ways these small objects helped shape and were shapedby temporalexperiences. Such temporal­ities were as much juxtaposed and intersecting as they were changing.

Theyalsocontrast with Postclassic.gurines fromthe northernMayaLowlands in that the latter were often post­.repainted rather than slipped(ChaseandChase 2008;Smith 1971vol2:216).

One notableexceptiontothe openbaseformisasmall Postclassicperiod .gurine(Type I-L) fromSan Clemente (SCFC#029),which possesseda small holeatthe base anda ceramic rattlein its hollowinterior, indicatingthatit served as a rattle.

Other possible conceptual juxtapositions of old and newmayhave occurredwith ceramicvessels.Forexample, HelmkeandReents-Budet(2008).ndthat Ahk’utu’ Molded-carved vases, which are conservative in style with legible texts and Classic style presentation scenes, were coeval with Fine Orange Pabellon Molded-carved vessels, whose iconographicprogramsintroduced newtypesofpresentation scenes and whose texts were not legible. At some sites in eastern Petén, such as Nakum, Pabellon Molded-carved vessels arefound alongsideAhk’utu’ Molded-carved vases (Zralka and Hermes 2012:166–167).
