English translation, and the author does an excellent job of locating each work within the missionaries’ biographies. 
Howthissubstantial documentarymaterialisana­lyzed is problematic at times, with colonial reports of Maya belief and practice not subjected to ade­quate criticism. For example, we are told that “in thelatePost-Classic(AD 1250–1524), cross-shaped tree stones called yax che’el kab (.rst tree of the world) weresetupas markers” (52).AlthoughMaya cosmological tree symbolismdates back to Preclassic times,the term yax che’elkab does not appear in the known epigraphicrecord.Ratheritappearsincolonial documents, especially Christiantexts whereitisthe Tree of Eden (e.g. Mark Christensen’s The Teabo Manuscript 2016, 50).Eventhe ceiba tree(yax che) of theDresden CodexNewYear’s pagesisjust one of many different kinds of trees associated with the cardinaldirectionsin colonialMaya ritualtexts.Over thepastdecade, ethnohistorianshavedocumentedjust how extensive and subtle the impact of the Spanish colonial project was on Maya space, conduct, and even language (e.g., Hanks’ 2010 work Converting Words). Among contemporary ethnohistorians, most arguments of historical continuity require a more explicit critical apparatus than Christenson’s work provides here. 
The third chapter explores a linkage between the timingofSpanish military campaigns andEaster, fol­lowedbyafourth chapteronaccountsofpost-conquest world renewal ceremonies. Christenson argues that the Maya interpreted the Spanish conquest much like the period endings of the indigenous calendar and “as a result, Easter came to replace the ancient MayaWayeb’ observancesasthefocusfor ceremonies meant to regenerate the world” (111). Given the importance ofthe ancient calendars from the earliest epigraphicrecordstocontemporaryK’iche’ ajq’ijab’, manyMayanistswouldexpectasubstantivediscussion ofthesyncretismoftheindigenous calendarswiththe SpanishChristian ones.IfWayeb’ rites weremerged with Easter, one couldbe(andindeed would need tobe)veryprecise about when this occurred. Thisis because Easterisamoveable feast, andsoHolyWeek rarelyoverlapswiththe.ve“nameless”daysofMayan language speaking groups’ calendars. In Breath on theMirror (1993:221–222), DennisTedlock notes this correlation possibly occurred in the late eighteenth century.Surprisingly,Christenson’sargument focuses almostexclusively on theSpanish Christiandatesof conquest and early Colonial-era events, after which “theMaya probablyadoptedtheChristiansymbolof thecross willinglyasa symbolofregenerationthat.t wellwith theirown indigenous beliefs” (127).Ifinthe aftermathof military conquest theWayeb’rites were replacedby Easterregardlessofthelatter’sdateinthe ancient calendar,woulditnotbe bettertocharacterize this transition as acculturation or localization rather than syncretism? 
Although his principal argument is a historical one, over half of Christenson’s work is an excel­lent ethnography of Santiago Atitlán’s Holy Week rites based on the author’s decades of research in highlandGuatemala.Chapters.ve through nine each describe and analyze the Tz’utujil ceremonies of a different weekday(MondaytoFriday), witha.nal tenthchapterdevotedtothe aftermathofHolyWeek and concluding remarks. The lore of contemporary traditionalists surrounding RilajMamin Christenson’s narrative and photographs are among the most evoca­tive descriptions of these rites ever published. The analysis, however, is more problematic. When the author assertsthat one elementoranotherofmodern Tz’utujil ritesare “related”(301)or “analogous”(311) to the Dresden Codex New Year’s pages or Bishop Landa’s accounts of Maya rituals in Yucatan four centuries earlier, what is meant here? The structure of the book suggests direct historical continuity, but in most cases the reader is provided intimation rather thanevidence. Theincompleteness of the epigraphic andhistorical record maymakethis unavoidable,but thelackofanexplicit theoryof syncretism limitsthe plausibilityof theclaimsofthisambitiouswork.

It is speci.cally that problem that TheEarly Olmec and Mesoamerica aimsto address.Ifwe areto under­stand the different ways that societies across Mesoamerica copied, adapted, and manipulated theEarly Olmecstyle,thenweneedtohavea more detailed understanding of the material record of San Lorenzo than has been available until now. We also need more of a shared descriptive vocabulary concerning vessel forms, decorative techniques, and motifs.Toward that end, theeditors proposeto “focus primarily on data, with interpretation downplayed” 
(p. 1). Overall, the book makes signi.cant strides toward its general goals. The chapters all provide extensive empirical description—in some cases of rather smallsetsof materials (forinstance, acouple hundred sherds). Passion for descriptive detail is particularly evident in chapters authored by one or bothofthe editors. 
The book consistsof10 chapters.David Cheetham and Jeffrey Blomster (chapter 1) summarize the archaeological recordof SanLorenzo basedon pub­lished materials.In chapter2,Blomsterand Cheetham, along with Rosemary Joyce and Christopher Pool, propose “a common lexicon for technological and stylistic aspectsofEarly Olmec pottery”(p. 37).This chapterisreally theheartofthe book. Theauthorspro­vide clear de.nitions(forinstance,ofgroovingversus excising)anddescribe12motifspresentinthe pottery of SanLorenzo.Subsequent chapters referencethose consistentlyby name and/or number. Chapters3 and 4deal with assemblages fromthe Gulf Coastregion. Carl Wendt describes a residential assemblage from El Remolino,5km fromSan Lorenzo. Characteristic elements of the Early Olmec style are rare in what looks likeapeasantcommunity.ChristopherPool and .ve colleagues describe pottery and .gurines of the EarlyOlmec era fromTresZapotes. 
Five chapters focus on collections outside the Gulf Coast. In one of the highlights of the volume, LouiseParadisreviews whatisknownof EarlyOlmec materials from Central Mexico—and what can be discovered with a little sleuthing (chapter 5). Her efforts to distinguish between “local” and “Early Olmec style” motifs are quite helpful. Blomster describesthe decorated ceramicsofEtlatongoin the Mixteca Alta (chapter6),while MarcusWinter,Victor Zapien López, and Alma Montiel Ángeles exam­ine material from the southern Isthmus of Tehuan­tepec, on the Paci.c coast but just 135 km from San Lorenzo (chapter 7). Rosemary Joyce and John Henderson presentEarly Olmecstyle materials from Honduras, particularly the site of Puerto Escondido (chapter 9). 
Cheethamand Michael Coe,in chapter8,compare the vessel form assemblage of San Lorenzo to that of Canton Corralito, located 400 km away on the Paci.c coastofChiapas.Thisisthe latestinaseries of articlesbyCheethamcomparing differentaspects of the two assemblages. The degree of similarity is astounding. Thenatureofthe relations between these two sites deserves extended discussion and debate. Therewasclearlyclose,activecontact betweenthetwo centers for 150 to 200 years. OneofBarbara Stark’s subspecialtiesistoserve asfair-mindedcommentator oneverything Olmec,ataskshe performsnicelyhere (chapter 10). 
One surprising aspect of this volume, especially given its just-the-facts-please premise, is its casual treatmentof absolute chronology.Mostchaptersdate phasesin uncalibratedradiocarbon “years,”with only passing reference to calibrated equivalents. Trans­lation from radiocarbon to calendar years is a dif­.cult interpretive problem, especially when one is trying to compare sites from different regions. At the empirical level, that task is just as important as distinguishing systematically between grooving and excising. Thereisa theoretical dimensionas well.We need to start thinking more seriously about time as experiencedbyFormativeera villagers.Transitionto calendar years can have signi.cant implications for understanding social process. The early Olmec era is 200–300 radiocarbon “years” long (1200–1000/900 BC), but it expands to about 400 years when dates are calibrated. TheChicharras phase at SanLorenzo is citedherewithout commentary(p. 38) as 1300– 1200 BC (radiocarbon) but 1450–1400 cal BC. In otherwords, calibration shrinks the phasebyhalf, from .ve humangenerations (100 “years”)totwo or three generations (50years). 
There are other issues that might be put down as work for the future. Ongoing problems with the term “Olmec” are not resolved here (consider the incompatible de.nitions usedin chapters4 versus5). The book does not engage in any serious statistical analysis (of, for instance, associations of motifs) despite the appropriateness of the data presented in some chapters.Variabilityin renderingsof individual motifs is also a potential arena for local innovation that has not yet been given attention at the level of empirical detail envisionedhere. 
Overall, though, the very specialized audience to which this book is directed—most immediately, archaeologists actually working on Early Olmec material—will .ndit timelyand important.For such

Thisvolume focusesexclusively on thePuuc region, which rarely gets this kind of attention in academic literature. It contains 11 chapters, 3 of which are in Spanish. The .rst seven chapters have an archaeolog­ical focus, and the last four discuss art and writing. Written for an expert audience, this book provides a much-needed update from an array of projects at various research stages across the states of Yucatán andCampeche. 
Michael Smyth and colleagues discuss the site of Xcoch, whose architectural center clusters around water resources, highlighting the signi.cance that water management played during the Preclassic and Classicperiods.Using settlement pattern studies,sed­imentcores,speleothemanalysis, anddatingmethods, they argue that the site experienced multiple popula­tiondeclines despitetheconstructionand modi.cation of various water catchment features in the face of intense and recurring droughts. Meanwhile, at nearby Uxmal, where they engaged in more intense water management,the populationthrived foracentury after Xcoch’s decline. 
Ken Seligson and colleagues examine lime pow­der(Spanish cal) production, which has been hard to identify in the archaeological record due to the dif.cultyof identifying kiln structures.The discovery of seven possiblekilnsatKiuic provides insight into cal manufacture, the resources needed to create it, andwhatroleitplayedinthe ancientPuuc economy.

Luis Raúl Pantoja Díaz investigates the site of Kabah, one of the largest centers, nestled within the highest elevations of the Yucatán. Despite early attentionbyJohn LloydStephens andminor projects in the 1920s, ’50s, and ’80s, INAH did not initiate a major project there until 1990. Like other sites in the region, Kabah is comprised of dispersed settle­ment on the highest points of terrain, strategically surrounded by water sources such as aguadas and chultunes, quarries for sascab, and rich agricultural lands. Kabah’s positioning of large elite structures on high terrain made this architecture very public, while also restricting accesstoritual space. 
Gustavo Novelo Rincón discusses the restoration work done on theCodz PopbuildingofKabah,which served as theresidence forthe rulingfamily duringthe Terminal Classicperiod. Theproject hasfocused on conserving oneof thebestexamplesof an elaborate Puuc façade, while also attempting to understand thebuilding’siconography,associated materials, and placementwithinthe site.Although theresearchisin progress, theyhave been able to detect sevendistinct construction phases, the presence of ritual activities in theinterior of thebuilding, andevidencethatthe elaborate façades were altered as political powers changed. 
Lourdes Toscano Hernández and José Huchim Herreraexaminethe abandonmentof domestic items in what they call “Architecture ofPower” across the Puuc region during the Terminal Classic period. In buildings onceoccupiedby rulingfamilies, theyhave detected a pattern of trash heaps, including animal bones, brokenbuildingornaments,broken ceramics, lithics, and ash intentionally placed along destroyed stairways. The rituals appear similar at distinct sites and were likely done to show reverence to a space before or afterbeing occupied.
