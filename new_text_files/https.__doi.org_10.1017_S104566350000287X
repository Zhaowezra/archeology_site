BRACKETING THE COPAN DYNAS TY: LATE PRECLASSIC AND 
EARLY POSTCLASSIC SETTLEMENTS AT COPAN, HONDURAS 

T. Kam Manahan and Marcello A. Canuto 
Archaeological research within the Classic Maya center of Copan and in its surrounding rural regions has generated new data relating to the periods both preceding and following the center's Classic period dynasty. Recent excavations at both late Preclassic and Early Postclassic settlements have revealed more similarities between the inhabitants of these two "non­Classic" time periods than to the inhabitants of the intervening and better known Classic period. We explore this striking set of similarities in terms of settlement pattern, spatial organization, architecture, material culture, and ritual deposits and spaces. We suggest that the similarities between the Copan region 's Late Preclassic and Early Postclassic populations and their mutual differences with intervening Classic period peoples reflect a cultural connection between these two populations. 
lnvestigaciones arqueol6gicas en el centro Maya de Copan, Honduras y en sus alrededores rurales han generado sorpren­dentes datos sobre las poblaciones anteriores y posteriores a la epoca dinastica Clasica (D. C. 426-820) de! centro. Excava­ciones recientes de asentamientos de! preclasico tardfo y de! posclasico temprano compararon una variedad de caracterfsticas independientes: patrones de asentamiento, organizaci6n espacial, estilo de arquitectura, tipo de cultura material, y dep6sitos y espacios rituales. Estos datos revelan que los habitantes de los dos periodos "no-Clasicos" se asemejan mas uno al otro que a Los habitantes de! sobresaliente periodo Clasico. Se propone que estas las semejanzas entre poblaciones copanecas del pre­clasico tardfo y del posclasico temprano (y sus divergencias mutuas con la poblaci6n copaneca del periodo clasico) implica que 1) estas dos poblaciones compartieron un vfnculo cultural, y 2) que la poblaci6n del periodo clasico representa una dis­continuidad en las tradiciones locales de la region de Copan.

spheres of influence along the limits of Classic Maya civilization, we suggest that the region's dra­matic transitions may have reflected not only shifts in influence, but perhaps also geographic expan­sions and contractions of two or more culturally dis­tinct populations. In either case, we argue that their differences derive from the distinctive predisposi­tions, affiliations, and cultural identities of their respective members. 
These data also have a wider implication beyond the refinement of Copan's culture history. A cen­tral research question in Maya studies has been to model the processes by which Classic Maya polit­ical authority was centralized, maintained, and finally dissolved. One model derived from Copan data suggests that the Classic Maya polity devel­oped as a result of stresses placed on the ecology of the region by the region's political economy. However, because the elite class was never able to overcome the segmentary tendencies of the Maya kinship system, centrifugal socioeconomic forces eventually led to the dissolution of the elite state and the perseverance of smaller, more stable sociopolitical units throughout the region (Freter 1994, 2004; Gonlin 1994; Sanders 1989; Webster 1989; Webster 2002; Webster and Freter I 990a, 1990b; Webster et al. 2000; Webster et al. 1993; Webster et al. 2004; Webster et al. 1992). 
This so-called "weak state" model is predicated on several claims regarding the culture-history of the Copan region, namely that (I) demographic changes in the region were gradual and processual in nature, (2) prior to the establishment of Copan's dynasty, populations in the region were low, and 
(3) following Copan's dynastic collapse, the region was occupied by rural communities that continued to produce and consume Late Classic ceramics for centuries (see Freter 2004; Webster 2005; Webster et al. 2000; Webster et al. 2004; Wingard 1996). In contradistinction to the "weak state" model, new data presented here challenge each of these claims and demonstrate that both the inception and col­lapse of the Copan dynasty wrought profound demographic changes across the landscape. 
Culture-History of the Copan Region 
Late Preclassic and Protoclassic Periods 
Studies of the southeastern Maya area (Stone I 959: Thompson 1970) have suggested the Copan drainage was a junction for Maya (proto-Ch'olti) and the Lenca groups. Despite occupation dating to Early Preclassic period, ca. 1200 B.C, the first real evidence of a central settlement in the Copan region dates to the Late Preclassic period, also known as the Sebito (350--150 B.C.) and Chabij (150 B.C.-A.D. 50) phases. The ceramics of this

time period belonged to the U apala ceramic sphere that integrated sites from central and western Hon­duras (Andrews 1976, 1977). In fact, Andrews (1 976) suggested that this sphere represented a Lenca rather than Maya cultural area. 
In the Copan valley, Late Preclassic materials have been recovered from several disparate contexts-under the modern town of Copan Ruinas, on various other hilltop areas around the valley (Fash 1986), the main plaza of the Acropo­lis (Cheek 1983), and in the Bosque region of the valley floodplain (Hall and Viel 1994; Viel and Hall 1994). Relative to the dispersed Early and Middle Preclassic data, the Sebito and Chabij phase data were initially interpreted as evidence for a drastic reduction in the valley population during the Late Preclassic period (Fash 1986:76-79). This evidence contrasted with coeval developments through the rest of central Honduras, the Guatemalan High­lands, and the central Peten where the Late Pre­classic period was a time of increasing population concentration and greater settlement hierarchy. 
Recent research of the Bosque region (Hall 2004; Viel and Hall 2004) has corrected this dis­crepancy by showing that "that there was no real decline of population, rather that settlement was more tightly nucleated and subject to considerable disturbance by territorial torrential events and later rearrangements of the landscape" (Viel and Hall 2004). Perhaps located on a higher, more defensi­ble spur of the Copan valley, a nucleated village was established during the beginning of the Late Formative (Carballo 1997; Cummins 2007:166). 
In the adjacent areas around the Copan Valley, several Late Preclassic sites-Los Achiotes (Canuto 2002, 2004a, 2004b ), El Guayabal (Canuto and Bell 2005, 2006; Sharer et al. 2009), Las Orquideas (Canuto and Bell 2003), El Zacatal (Bell and Canuto 2006), and La Florida (Nakamura et al. 1991 )-reflect the same settlement pattern. These centers consist of earthen architecture arranged in large and informally defined open plazas that resemble the spatial pattern of central Honduran sites (Canuto 2002; Schortman and Urban 2004 ). 
Similar patterns of interaction may be seen in the material culture. For the Copan valley, Viel ( 1993) observes that the ceramics-such as censers and resist-decorated vessels-are similar to those found at coeval centers such as Los Naranjos and Chalchuapa of central Honduras and El Salvador. Overall, Copan's Sebito (350-150 B.C.) and sub­sequent Chabij (150 B.C.-AD. 50) phases share more characteristics with the ceramics of Rio Pelo (Wonderley 1991) and Quelepa (Andrews 1976, 1977) than with the coeval Providencia and Miraflores phases of Highland Guatemala (Demarest and Sharer 1986; Schortman and Urban 1991). 
The Late Preclassic populations in the Copan drainage did not drop in regional importance (Fash 2001; Schortman and Urban 2004; Vlcek and Fash 1986; Willey 1986, 1988); rather, the evidence sug­gests that during the Sebito ceramic phase, they were integrated largely with central Honduras. However, it is important to note that the presence of U sulutan-type resist-decorated ceramics throughout the Copan adjacent valleys suggests the region's inhabitants also participated within a broader southeastern Maya exchange network dur­ing the Late Preclassic period (Sharer et al. 2009). 
Evidence for growing interaction between the Copan drainage and highland Maya center of Kam­inaljuyu dates to the end of the Late Preclassic period. At this time, the Kaminaljuyu-centered Miraflores interaction sphere was being heavily disrupted by incursions of hostile populations from Guatemala's northwestern highlands (Popenoe de Hatch 1997:95-100, 2000, 2002:287-290). Given the drastic changes at Kaminaljuyu between the Terminal Preclassic (Santa Clara phase) and Early Classic (Aurora phase) periods, Popenoe de Hatch (2002:290) has suggested that by A.D.100, Kami­naljuyu's Terminal Preclassic populations were forced to flee southeastward, toward the Motagua valley and the Copan region. 
The upheaval of Kaminaljuyu and its conse­quent population displacements eastward are con­sistent with changes observed in the contemporaneous ceramics of the Copan region. During the early Protoclassic period (AD. 50--200), Copan's Bijac I phase ceramics contain some high­land Guatemalan types (such as Aguacate Orange), forms (such as mammiform supports), and styles (such as Linear Dicrome) (Crangle 1994; Viel 1983, 1998, 2006:207; Viel and Hall 2004). In fact, by AD. 100, there was "a creative stimulus from the Miraflores sphere into Copan, either through trade or migration" (Viel and Hall 2004). By Bijac II phase (AD. 200--400), the introduction of basal

flanged polychrome bowls to Copan's ceramic assemblage confirms the growing highland Guatemalan influence in western Honduras (Cas­sandra Bill, personal communication 2007). It is therefore possible that between A.D. 100-200, proto-Ch'olti populations of eastern Guatemala were not only moving eastward into the Copan region, but also "included descendants of the inhab­itants of Kaminaljuyu" (Popenoe de Hatch 2002:290). 
Below, we present new data that are consistent with the idea that the Copan region was populated in the Late Preclassic period by groups culturally affiliated with central Honduras. We will also show how this occupation ended at the time proto-Ch' olti populations would have entered the Copan region 
Terminal Classic and Early Postclassic Periods 
The traditional model of the demise of Classic period Copan has posited a rapid abandonment in the wake of the collapse of centralized authority with some limited most-monumental activities in the site core, perhaps as a pilgrimage destination (Longyear 1952; Morley 1920). Post-dynastic evi­dence at Copan has consisted of several intrusive burials in and around the site center and surface­level sheet middens deposited during ritual activi­ties and perhaps short-term occupation within some temple rooms inside the Acropolis. While it seems reasonable that some secondary elite compounds may have continued to be occupied in the decades following dynastic collapse (e.g. Webster and Freter 1990a:82), extensive testing and horizontal exca­vations at numerous sites have yet to identify a post-dynastic Terminal Classic facet distinguish­able from the Late Classic Coner ceramic phase. 
Only four Fine Orange Ware vessels have been reported from Copan, three of which were found in burial contexts. The fourth vessel was found in the East Court, a primary locus of Early Postclas­sic activity. One unidentified Fine Orange Ware globular jar was recovered a burial placed inside the room of Structure IOL-7 along with an Early Postclassic Plumbate vessel and two probable Las Vegas polychrome vessels (Longyear 1952:44). The other two vessels, both identified as Pabellon Molded-carved cylinders, were recovered from burials within plazas of high-status residential com­pounds, one in Group 8L-10 or the North Group (Ashmore 1991), and the other at the secondary center of Ostuman (Whittington 1991 ). Both buri­als were encountered within the plaza placed along the centerline of a nearby structure. The cylinder from the North Group was associated with four Coner phase Surlo vessels (Ashmore 1991:211), while the burial from Ostuman also contained a sin­gle Plumbate cylinder (Whittington 1991 : 19). 
Proyecto Arqueologico Copan (PAC) I and II excavation and survey conducted throughout the Main Group and surrounding settlement identified only a single additional locus of Early Postclassic activity, centered on Ballcourt B, located within the dense residential settlement to the south of Copan' s Acropolis in the El Bosque zone (Fash and Lane 1983). The Early Postclassic artifacts, containing exotic green Pachuca obsidian, several bifacial points, sherds ofTohil Plumbate, Fine Orange, and Las Vegas Polychrome ceramics, were strewn among the buildings and on the playing surface of Ballcourt B. Also present in the deposit were dis­articulated pieces of carved stone sculptural ele­ments taken from the fac;ade of Structure lOL-18, identified as the likely funerary monument of the final king of the Copan dynasty, Yax Pasaj Chan Yoaat (Baudez 1994). Viel (1 983) used these data to define a limited local Early Postclassic Ejar ceramic phase in keeping with Longyear's obser­vations and based exclusively upon the presence of diagnostic imported goods found in superficial con­texts not associated with the Late Classic Coner phase. Together these data, albeit limited, suggest little cultural continuity between Late Classic and Early Classic populations. 
The limited evidence from the Early Postclas­sic period fueled debate over the timing and sever­ity of the Classic Maya collapse of the site (Braswell 1992; Fash and Sharer 1991; Freter 1992; Webster and Freter 1990a, l 990b; Webster et al. 1993). In revising the chronology of the end of Copan' s history, Webster and Freter ( 1990a, 1990b) have proposed, based upon their obsidian hydra­tion dating program, that the demographic decline was extremely gradual and may have extended into the thirteenth century. According to this model, the site center alone still held between 1,000 and 2,000 inhabitants (Freter 1994:Table 26) in the eleventh century. This model accounted for the lack of any substantial Early Postclassic evidence by arguing that (1) Coner or "Coner-like" ceramics continued to be produced and consumed throughout this

extended period outside of the Main Group, and 
(2) the Ejar phase represented an imported sub­complex within the extended Coner phase, making any Ejar material contemporaneous with the Coner temporal extension. 
Below, we present data that do not reflect a grad­ual in situ transformation but instead present a rad­ical departure consonant with models of population replacement. Specifically, we show that ( 1) the Ejar phase contains both imported fine paste types and a utilitarian assemblage wholly distinct from the Coner phase; (2) Ejar phase occupations, while scarce, occur both within the site center and the rural hinterlands; and (3) multiple lines of evidence concur that the Ejar populations were likely dis­tinct from their Late Classic predecessors. If one were to attempt to resolve the gradualist demo­graphic model with the new data, one would be forced to postulate that two distinct populations of disproportionate sizes lived in separate communi­ties amongst each other all the while maintaining rigidly distinct local production networks without any overlap or interaction. 
Data Comparability 
The data discussed here resulted from separate though methodologically similar research projects focused on the recovery of evidence from both the Late Preclassic and Early Postclassic periods in the Copan region. Canuto investigated the alluvial bot­tomlands of the eastern Copan drainage (the Rio Amarillo valley) while Manahan studied the set­tlement near the Main Group of the Copan Valley (Figure 1 ). Both test excavated several sites within these areas while limiting intensive and horizontal excavations to larger settlements (Los Achiotes and El Bosque). Therefore, data recovered from these two separate research efforts are comparable. 
Canuto (2002) focused on the study of several sites in the rural areas of the eastern Copan drainage (Figure 1). One of these sites, Los Achiotes, was founded and primarily occupied during the Late Preclassic period (i.e., 400 B.C.-A.D. 0).1 Most salient to this discussion was the fact that Los Achiotes was (1) highly distinctive from Classic period sites in terms of architecture and site plan patterns and (2)abruptly abandoned during the Pro­toclassic period (A.D. 50--400). In this manner, Los Achiotes neatly exemplifies the discontinuity seen in the Copan region between the Late Preclassic and Protoclassic periods. 
For the Early Postclassic period, Manahan focused on the dense residential area around the southern and western limits of the Copan Acropo­lis (known as El Bosque). He revealed the existence of an Early Postclassic community living in and among the abandoned and decaying residential structures that had composed the urban core of Copan's Classic period polity. In terms of settle­ment pattern, architecture, and material culture (including a utilitarian ceramic assemblage), this Ejar phase occupation varied greatly from preced­ing Late Classic patterns. 
What follows is a comparison of Late Preclas­sic Los Achiotes and the Early Postclassic settle­ment of El Bosque to their Classic period counterparts based on six archaeologically visible and culturally salient categories: ( 1) chronology of occupation, (2) settlement pattern, (3) spatial orga­nization, ( 4) architectural style, (5) material goods, and (6) special deposits and features. The follow­ing comparison highlights the distinctive nature of these "non-Classic period" populations from the intervening Classic period inhabitants of the drainage, and in turn illustrates the similarities shared by settlements from the two periods. 
Late Preclassic Los Achiotes 
Los Achiotes is located roughly 20 km east of Copan in a small, fertile (Olson 1979) intermon­taine valley straddling the Rio Otuta, a tributary of the Rio Amarillo in the eastern Copan drainage (Figure 2). The architectural, spatial, and material attributes suggest that its Late Preclassic inhabitants were distinct from their Classic period successors. 
Chronological Placement 
Canu to' s research at Los Achiotes demonstrated the existence of a large Late Preclassic occupation. Four radiometric assays-including carbonized pieces of roof posts associated with the final con­struction phases of the structures-were conducted (Table 1). The calibrated intercept dates cluster within a range of cal 370-115 B.C. while the 2a ranges constitute a time span of cal 410-30 B.C. (Canuto 2002). Furthermore, Los Achiotes ceram­ics include diagnostic resist-decorated vessels known as Izalco Usulutan (Sharer 1978) that date

leys of Rfo Sesesmil, Rfo Amarillo (Webster et al. 2000:23), and the El Parafso valley (Cagnato 2008; Canuto et al. 2003; Fash 1983). Current research in the El Parafso valley is demonstrating the exis­tence of a three-tiered hierarchy of Late Preclassic settlement for the entire Copan region (Los Achiotes represents a middle-tier site) centered around the monumental site of El Guayabal in the El Parafso valley (Cagnato 2008; Canuto et al. 2003; Sharer et al. 2009). It would now seem rea­sonable to suggest the Copan region was domi­nated from the El Parafso valley rather than the Copan valley in the Late Preclassic period. 
All this recent evidence further suggests that a discontinuity in occupation between the Late Pre­classic and subsequent periods. For instance, at Los Achiotes, the radiocarbon date ranges and the absence of Early Classic (Acbi phase) ceramics suggest that its Late Preclassic occupation ended long before Copan's dynastic rise. Furthermore, widespread evidence of final-phase burning of in situ architectural features (such as posts and struc­ture fa<;ades) implies that the end of this center's occupation was sudden and perhaps even violent. The abrupt demise of Los Achiotes coincides with a hypothesized incursion of highland Maya groups of the Protoclassic period (Sharer and Traxler 2006; Viel and Hall 2004 ). The initial nucleation of rural settlements during the Protoclassic period (Viel and Hall 2000)and subsequent termination of some may be explained if the interaction between groups was violent. 
Settlement Pattern 
The Los Achiotes settlement was located exclu­sively on hilltops overlooking the small floodplain of its valley, the preferred location for many of the Copan drainage's Late Preclassic sites, such as Cerro Chino, Cerro de las Mesas, and Las Orquideas (Canuto et al. 2003; Fash 1983, 2001; Fash and Fash 2000; Hall and Viel 2004). Perhaps the threat of insecurity shaped the preference for higher ground (ca. 30m above their fields) and the decision to refrain from living near the floodplain. Given that a Protoclassic highland Maya incursion could have caused the destruction of Los Achiotes, it is reasonable to consider this hilltop settlement pattern as a response to intra-drainage conflict (Fash 2001; Fash and Fash 2000). Moreover, hilltop loca­tions also provided good vantage points to control the exchange routes connecting the Copan, El Parafso, and Motagua river valleys.

The hilltop preference could also have been a practical response to local hydrological factors within the drainage. Recent geomorphological research has shown that the Copan Valley during the Late Preclassic phase was more hydrologically volatile and marshy than at present (Hall and Viel 2004 ). With a shallower river bed and increased flooding (annual flooding still effects parts of the Los Achiotes valley), inhabitants would have favored the naturally flat areas within the higher and drier piedmont zones. 
This settlement pattern may also reflect cultural preferences. During the subsequent Protoclassic period, settlement was entirely re-organized around the growing and centralizing polity-shifting from hilltops to the valley bottom (Canuto 2002). This change was eventually complemented by the estab­lishment of the monumental Acropolis along the Copan River's edge in the early A.D. fifth century (Cheek 1983; Fash 2001; Fash and Fash 2000; Sharer et al. 1999; Traxler 2004). Eventually, dur­ing the Classic period, settlement spread through­out the floodplains of the various valleys within the drainage (Canuto 2002; Fash 1983; Willey and Lev­enthal 1979; Willey, Leventhal, and Fash 1979) and only returned to the piedmont zones of the drainage once the floodplains had been filled (Canuto 2002; Fash 1983; Wingard 1996).

ning of anything found in the Copan Valley, and appear[ing] to reflect distinct conceptualizations of space" (Vlcek and Fash 1986: 109-10). Its lay­out consisted of stand-alone range structures in a linear arrangement along the edges of a hilltop. This organization defined a large, open, and acces­sible interior plaza of ca. 100m2. Moreover, this spa­tial plan was replicated at a smaller scale by the surrounding residential sites. 
This spatial pattern was not unique to Los Achiotes. Cerro Chino (Canuto and McFarlane 2000; Fash and Fash 2000:447), for instance, was located on a flat hilltop with platforms arranged around a plaza roughly 50m in diameter (Figure 3 ).

Outside the Copan drainage, this spatial plan is characteristic of central Honduran sites (Figure 4 )-such as La Sierra (Schortman and Urban 1994), Viejo Jalapa, El Coyote (Mcfarlane 2002), Gualjoquito (Ashmore et al. 1987, Schortman et al. 1986), Las Vegas (Stone 1957), Los Naranjos (Baudez and Becquelin 1973), Tenampua (Dixon 1989; Popenoe 1936), and Yarumela (Dixon et al.

that the site was constructed in multiple episodes of synchronized labor efforts involving architec­tural construction, plaza clearing, resource gather­ing, and landscape modification. The people of Los Achiotes, therefore, not only shared a spatial aes­thetic, but also developed mechanisms of co­operation that enhanced a sense of local, autonomous, community identity. 
In terms of the use of space, the open patios were almost clear of cultural debris. Survey and test­excavation inside these patios recovered an aver­age artifact density of only ca. 15 per cubic meter, while outside the patios the artifact density was three times greater. Killion (1992) has noted that modem agricultural families in Mexico whose res­idences are surrounded by a large and artifact-free patio often use land immediately surrounding their residences for agricultural purposes. He contrasts this pattern with families living in residences with smaller patios surrounded by land littered with refuse. These latter families practice intense horti­culture in the land immediately adjacent to their res­idences while supplementing their diet with subsistence crops grown in fields distant from their residence. Killian's patterns suggest that the agri­cultural fields of the Los Achiotes inhabitants were communally accessible and intermixed among the community's residences. 
These Late Preclassic organizational tenets were replaced initially by the imposition of a highland Maya spatial template, then subsequently a Peten­influenced pattern (though eclectic in form [see Bell et al. 2004]) through the Protoclassic to Clas­sic periods. By the Classic period, the settlers in the Copan drainage constructed residences with smaller patios and restricted access ceremonial structures (Canuto 2002). If spatial organization represents a salient marker of social identity (Schortman and Nakamura 1991 ), then the sharing of this attribute among different groups reflects their affiliation to one another. These shared spa­tial patterns suggest that a distinct local (Lenca) tra­dition flourished in the Copan drainage long before the rise of dynastic power at Copan in the Classic period. 
Architectural Style and Construction 
In terms of architecture, Los Achiotes consisted of earthen platforms supporting multiple pole-and­thatch superstructures. Some of the larger sub­structures were terraced and surrounded by an apron-flooring extending up to 3m from the base of the platform. Measuring roughly l 5-20m in length and 8-12m in width, these residential plat­forms were wider and longer than their Classic equivalents. In fact, Classic period sites of similar size had smaller and more tightly-packed buildings (Figure 5). The architectural fill consisted mainly of clayey soil with some river cobble, covered in some instances by a thick layer of fine reddish clay. Some platforms were finished with a thin clayey film. Similarly, earthen structures from the earliest phases of the Copan Acropolis often exhibited a similar clay film, often colored red (Sharer et al. 1999; Traxler 2004 ). Those of Los Achiotes, how­ever, were often black, as if burnt. Only one struc­ture at Los Achiotes contained cut-stone masonry. 
In the Late Preclassic, earthen architecture was common throughout southeast Mesoamerica. Large highland monumental sites like Chalchuapa (Sharer 1978) and Kaminaljuyu (Kidder et al. 1946) had abundant examples of earthen architecture. Non­Maya sites farther to the east-such as Quelepa (Andrews 1976), Yarumela (Dixon et al. 1994 ), La Florida (Nakamura et al. 1991), and El Guayabal (Canuto et al. 2002)-were also composed almost entirely of earthen structures. Even the earliest monumental phases of the Copan Acropolis included earthen architecture (Sharer et al. 1999). Los Achiotes's contemporaries in the drainage. such as Cerro Chino, El Guayabal, El Zacatal, and Las Orquideas, also consisted exclusively of earthen architecture. Considering that both high­land Maya and central Honduras groups used earthen architecture in the Late Preclassic, it is dif­ficult to assess the cultural affinity of the Copan drainage inhabitants based solely on their archi­tectural practices. However, its ubiquity within the Copan drainage before the Protoclassic period is consistent with older architectural traditions of cen­tral Honduras. 
Material Culture 
The material culture of Los Achiotes also suggests that it was composed of a group 1) indigenous to the southeastern Mesoamerica periphery, and 2) antecedent to traditions attributed to Maya groups or others whom eventually dominated the drainage. Although the families of Los Achiotes were not able to acquire a wide array of exotic goods, they did

enjoy some flexibility in the selection and mainte­nance of regional trading partners. Furthermore, the distribution of recognizable prestige goods, such as polychrome ceramic serving vessels, amongst the residences of the community suggests that Los Achiotes was overtly egalitarian and regionally autonomous. 
The technological production, acquisition, and consumption behaviors of the Los Achiotes inhab­itants were different from later Classic period pat­terns. The ceramic assemblage includes a substantial number of imports from central Hon­duras, while a significant fraction of their obsidian blades originated from sources little used in Clas­sic Copan. These patterns parallel those character­izing coeval centers of central Honduras rather than of Classic period Copan. 
Ceramics. The Los Achiotes ceramic assem­blage included Izalco Usulutan fine wares (see Schortman and Urban 2004) characteristic of the Late Preclassic ceramic phases of Sebito and Chabij (Canuto 2002; Cummins 2007), although it lacked the fine-line painted vessel types typical of these phases. Even more than their contemporaries liv­ing in the Copan valley, the inhabitants of Los Achiotes used pottery that belonged to the south­eastern and central Honduras ceramic traditions (see Demarest and Sharer 1986; Sharer 1974; Sharer and Gifford 1970). 
The majority of the site's utilitarian wares con­sists of either unslipped, burnished, red-pasted ves­sels (some with incisions in zones), or simple red­/orange-slipped vessels also common to the Late Preclassic period. This utilitarian assemblage dif­fers only in terms of surface treatment and deco­rative style to that found in the Copan Valley. The differences likely reflect both localized production techniques as well as the use of different clay sources, a question which promises to be better understood after the conclusion of an ongoing com­prehensive INAA compositional analysis (see Bishop et al. 1982). There is scant evidence for cen­tralized or even standardized pottery production within the Copan drainage for this period, in con­trast to Classic period pattems2• 
Another salient characteristic of the Los Achiotes ceramic assemblage is its lack of griddles. The general presence of griddles has been attrib­uted to the inclusion into the diet of griddle­prepared staple foods such as the com tortilla-a food present in highland Guatemala during the Pro­toclassic. This vessel form was relatively rare, how­ever, during the Late Preclassic period throughout the Copan drainage, perhaps because of the differ­ent culinary practices of the local inhabitants. Since basic differences in culinary practices between groups are often reliable indices of ethnic differ­ence, the absence of griddles at Los Achiotes is con­sistent with the interpretation that its inhabitants were different from the Maya groups in highland

Guatemala. In the Copan region, griddles become 
progressively more common during the Bijac 
phase: increasing from 4 percent (early Bijac) to 
32 percent (early Acbi) of all utilitarian wares (Cas­
sandra Bill, personal communication, 2007; Viel 
and Hall 2000). This increase in the Copan region 
coincides with the hypothesized migration of high­
land Maya groups into the Copan drainage from 
the west. 

Chipped Stone Industry. The LosAchiotes lithic assemblage consisted of four different chipped stone technologies: prismatic blade reduction, expedient percussion, bipolar percussion, and bifa­cial reduction (Canuto 2002; Mcfarlane 2001; Mcfarlane and Canuto 2000). Inhabitants of Los Achiotes predominantly used percussion (direct and bi-polar) methods to produce flake tools. As for raw material, they relied on imported obsidian as well as local chert (61 percent vs. 36 percent by number; see Table 2a). Their heavy emphasis on chert suggests that they did not acquire sufficient amounts of obsidian for all their needs. Reliance on chert diminishes in the Classic period-for example, the inhabitants of the Classic period rural 
community of El Raizal relied almost completely on obsidian over chert (93 percent vs. 7 percent by number; see Table 2b ). 
Relative to the entire obsidian tool assemblage, prismatic obsidian blades were rare at Los Achiotes (20 percent of all obsidian tools; compare to Clas­sic period El Raizal, where blades comprised 70 percent of all obsidian tools). Since no evidence of local obsidian blade production was encountered, it is likely that blades were imported already man­ufactured (Mcfarlane and Canuto 2000). In fact prismatic blade production within the Copan Val­ley only commenced during the Bijac phase, ca. 
A.D. 200 (Aoyama 1999). Blade technology has been correlated to the Protoclassic migration of highland Maya into the Copan drainage from Guatemala where prismatic blade production had already developed (Braswell 2001 ). 
Obsidian at Los Achiotes originated from two sources-Ixtepeque (to the southwest of Copan) and the more distant El Chayal (near Kaminaljuyu ). At Los Achiotes, the level of El Chayal obsidian (ca. 7 .5 percent of sample; see Table 2a) was nearly twenty times higher than that of the Copan Valley in the Classic period (less than 1 percent of sam­ple; Aoyama I 999; Canuto and Mcfarlane 2000; see Table 2b ). The elevated quantities of El Chay al obsidian indicate that Los Achiotes participated in an exchange network different from the one con­trolled by the Copan dynasty during the Classic period. It is unknown, however, whether Los Achiotes acquired its foreign goods directly from foreign trading partners, or if there existed some unidentified Late Preclassic distribution center that helped distribute these goods to the Copan drainage's rural communities. Recent research at El Guayabal in the El Parafso valley (Bell and Canuto 2007; Canuto and Bell 2003) suggests it 

might have functioned as the Copan region's pri­mary site during this time.

Special Deposits and Ritual Spaces 
Evidence for ritual activity within Los Achiotes was centered in public spaces rather than house­holds. The openness of ritual spaces at Los Achiotes reflects communal access to the ritual activity asso­ciated with these contexts. Conversely, during the Classic period, household cists, patio altars, and shrine structures were often hidden from public view and restricted to members of a single house­hold (Canuto 2002; Gonlin 1994). This emphasis on communal access to public space reflects the salience of an egalitarian ideology during the Late Preclassic that disappeared during the Classic period. 
Caches. Caches at Los Achiotes were associated with the axes of its ballcourt, located just south of the plaza. Introduced during the construction of the ballcourt's end-zone walls and playing surface, they functioned both as axis markers for the ballcourt and as the creation of a ritual space. These caches were composed of mundane and communally accessible objects such as river cobbles and peb­bles rather than prestige goods. The salience of these caches was the communal activity they engen­dered to create them rather than the intrinsic value of their contents. These caches represent the coor­dination of materials, resources, labor, and exper­tise at a scale that resulted in the congregation of the community, prestation and service exchange, and even some form of ceremonial sacralization of the work effort. Consequently, they represent the embedding (Rathje 2002) of resources into the community for the likely advantage of incipient elites, but with the concomitant consequence of reinforcing communal identity. 
Monuments. Another indicator of ritual behav­ior was the placement of several large plain cut­stone monuments in the site's main plaza. Given their shape and scale, these monuments likely func­tioned as thrones or altars. The largest monument (Monument 1) was located on a prepared floor in the middle of the central plaza. Its distance from all residences suggests that activities undertaken near it were communally accessible and visible, helping to maintain a semblance of egalitarianism vis-a-vis access to and participation in group activ­ities. One smaller altar, however, was located near the site's largest residential structure. This monu­ment might reflect the development of socio­political stratification as public ritual became conflated with individual (or lineal) privilege. 
Ritual spaces. The most distinctive structure at Los Achiotes was the enclosed I-shaped ballcourt that is the earliest known ballcourt within the Copan drainage. Its function as an arena for competition enhanced the local group identity (see Schortman and Nakamura 1991) by emphasizing internal sim­ilarity in relation to external groups. Furthermore, this ballcourt suggests that Los Achiotes was a politically autonomous entity (see Santley et al. 1991), a characteristic not shared by any rural site from the Classic period. The ballcourt middens contained an elevated concentration of Usulutan­style dishes. Functioning as ceremonial serving vessels for feasting activities in association with the ballgame ritual (Fox 1996), these vessels confirm the communal and ceremonial nature of ball court activities. Despite its special functions and associ­ated practices, however, the ballcourt belonged to the same earthen architectural tradition dominant at the site. 
The Late Preclassic Los Achiotes population expressed an ideology of communalism that was abruptly discarded in the Classic period in favor of different aesthetics, traditions, and practices. These cultural, socio-political, and economic discontinu­ities strongly suggest a change occurred in the pop­ulation living and dominating the Copan drainage during the Protoclassic period. Importantly, this type of comprehensive discontinuity occurs again in the Copan drainage-shortly after the collapse of Copan's Classic period dynasty. 
Early Postclassic El Bosque 
Copan Postclassic Archaeological Project (CPAP) research has identified a local Ejar phase residen­tial occupation within the El Bosque area located approximately 200 meters south of the Acropolis. The community was surrounded by abandoned Coner architecture, some of which served as quar­ries for building materials. The small El Bosque Early Postclassic community represented a radical departure from Classic period patterns while show­ing strong influence, interaction, and perhaps affil­iation with groups living beyond the Southeastern Maya periphery.

exclusively upon the presence of diagnostic fine paste imports including Tohil Plumbate, Las Vegas Polychrome, and Fine Orange in several deposits within the Principal Group, primarily intrusive buri­als. While the limited funerary contexts precluded Viel from defining a utilitarian component, Viel nonetheless placed the phase chronologically after the Late Classic Coner phase based upon a) the superficial and limited nature of the deposits, and b) their lack of association with Coner material. The current identification of a local Ejar occupation provides the missing utilitarian assemblage to the ceramic phase and demonstrates its distinctiveness from the preceding Coner phase, a conclusion con­firmed by its chronological placement via radio­carbon dating. 
In all, nine radiometric assays (three samples from each of three Ejar phase buildings) were con­ducted (Table 3). Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS) was used for all but two of the samples. Six assays originated from carbonized pieces of wat­tle and daub walls as well as one sample of car­bonized cotton seeds (Gossypium sp.) recovered from a floor context. Three additional samples were run on osteological material from a cist encountered in the Ejar Structure l lL-137. Calibrated intercept dates cluster within a range of cal A.D. 970 to cal 
A.D. 1085, with a single outlier of cal A.D. 1260 (Manahan 2004 ). Utilizing all nine dates, 2cr ranges fall between cal A.D. 723 and cal A.D. 1292. Based upon these chronometric dates and the material evidence, Manahan dates the Ejar phase to A.D. 950-1100, a span of perhaps five to seven genera­tions. The chronometric dates correspond with the distribution of diagnostic Terminal Classic/ Early Postclassic ceramic markers originally used by Viel (1983) to define the Ejar phase, including Fine Orange, Tohil Plumbate, and Las Vegas Poly­
920+40 1021(1061, 1086, 1123, 1138, 1156)1217 780+40 1190(1263) 1292 
chrome, the latter related to the Nicoya Poly­
chromes of lower Central America. 
The Ejar phase appears to have begun approx­imately a century after the fall of the Copan dynasty (ca. A.D. 822) and in cultural material terms appears to be intrusive. Abrupt changes in Ejar phase patterns of lithic and ceramic production and distribution are readily distinguishable from Coner trends and instead share strong material and ideo­logical ties with contemporaneous populations residing to the east in central Honduras. The Ejar occupation is also associated with extensive reuse and modification of several structures within the Acropolis, confirming its post-dynastic date. 

The identification of Ejar imported ceramic markers originally identified by Viel ( 1983) in situ from both habitational and funereal contexts asso­ciated with Ejar utilitarian types (and significantly without any associated Coner types, including the distinctive and ubiquitous Copador Polychrome) illustrates that Coner ceramics were no longer pro­duced when Tohil Plumbate and Las Vegas Poly­chrome vessels were exchanged into the Copan Valley. Neither type has been recovered from any Coner contexts. 
The Ejar phase seems to have ended as abruptly as it began within little more than a century of its inception. Evidence for a sudden, violent end to the Ejar occupation can be inferred from several lines of evidence. Every Ejar phase structure investi­gated had been burned to the ground, and a cist in Structure 1 lL-137 was violated, its capstones pried open and its contents smashed and strewn about the surface of the building. Moreover, Ejar structures contain a high frequency (2.5 percent overall) of bifacial projectile points, with as many as 100 points recovered from a single Ejar building. While bifacial points are more generally diagnostic of

Early Postclassic shifts in subsistence, a strong case for warfare may be made with the Ejar data. The 100 points were found strewn across the surface of Structure 1 1L-77, with 85 percent of them within the uppermost 20 cm of excavations. An additional seventeen points were also recovered from the adja­cent Ballcourt B (Fash and Lane 1983:540). The quantity and context of the projectile points, com­bined with the evidence for burning and destruc­tion of Ejar buildings suggests that warfare may have played a role in the downfall of Copan's Ejar occupation. 
Settlement Pattern 
The known Ejar phase settlement appears to have been quite limited both in spatial and temporal pat­terning, particularly when compared to the immense Coner occupation. This single Ejar com­munity, containing a total of nine structures, is cur­rently the most extensive Early Postclassic settlement known in the Copan region. Although Ejar remains can be found both within the site cen­ter and the rural periphery, the limited amount of Ejar settlement compared to the extensive investi­gations that have been conducted both within and around the Copan Valley and beyond suggest that the density of Ejar occupation in the area was low, especially when compared to Coner patterns. Sub­sequent testing of structures exhibiting similarities in size or layout from throughout the entire Bosque area and the Copan Valley from Ostuman in the west to Rastrojon east of the Principal Group failed to identify any new Ejar phase settlement beyond those mentioned here. 
Limited Ejar settlement has been identified out­side of the Bosquesettlement, where Canuto (2003) identified at Los Achiotes a limited Ejar reoccupa­tion consisting of a shallow lens of Ejar occupa­tional debris found deposited on top of five Late Preclassic structures, with no evidence for occu­pation during the intervening Classic Period. A sec­ond likely Ejar occupation was reported by Webster and Gonlin (1 988) at the group 7D--6-2, located on a piedmont spur approximately 1 km from the regional center of Rio Amarillo, although the Ejar utilitarian ceramic component had not been defined when the group was excavated. In fact multiple lines of evidence documented by Webster and Gonlin suggest that at least one structure in the group pertained to the Ejar phase: "An unexpected third building appeared on the east side of the plaza­a strange T-shaped platform, possibly a kitchen­which is well-defined but so low that it was com­pletely buried .... Seventeen fragments of green obsidian blades-undoubtedly from Central Mex­ico-were unearthed. Green obsidian is extremely rare in other contexts at Copan. Also unusual were the 18 bifacially-flaked projectile point or knife fragments found at 7D-6-2. These are seldom found at rural sites in any numbers" (Webster and Gonlin 1988: 177). 
While a Coner phase Copador vessel was found cached underneath another structure in the same group, the Bosque data demonstrates that Ejar set­tlers intentionally targeted abandoned Coner archi­tecture as a source of construction materials. Extensive reuse of construction materials typifies the Ejar phase, as all excavated structures were built utilizing reused Coner cut stone. At 7D-6-2, the presence in the group of "what appeared to be a stockpile of cobble building material" stacked to one side of the group (Webster and Gonlin 1988: 177) may have been a remnant of the Ejar dis­mantling and reuse of an abandoned Coner struc­ture. Such a case would argue against the possibility of a temporal overlap between Ejar and Coner phases. 
Spatial Organization 
The spatial organization of the Ejar settlement in the Bosque shared many of the same organiza­tional tenets with the Late Preclassic communities. This trait is noteworthy in terms of adhering to a shared linear arrangement of individual structures oriented around a large, unmodified open plaza toward which most structures faced, rather than forming individual closed patio groups so ubiqui­tous during the Coner phase. The Ejar structures cluster within an area delimited by Ballcourt B to the north and the Copan River to the east and south (Figure 6). 
Ejar structures appear to have been intention­ally sited near abandoned Coner-phase architectural compounds, including the elite Group 1 lL-12, an extensive Type 3 settlement in the local settlement hierarchy (Willey and Leventhal 1979). Perhaps the most striking example of this was Ejar Struc­ture l lL-109, an unassuming platform that origi­nally stood less than one meter above the ancient ground surface. The back of the structure almost

abutted the base of the stairway of Structure l lL-108, the principal entrance to Group l lL-12. The stairway rose almost three meters to the sum­mit of Structure l lL-108, so that Structure l lL-109 was built literally in the shadow of aban­doned Coner architecture, towering over the sim­ple structure. A second example comes from Structure l lL-142, on the southwestern comer of the Ejar settlement. While the building was not extensively investigated, surface wall lines suggest that the distinct shape of the structure results from a rectangular Ejar-phase building that partially enveloped one side of an earlier Coner-phase con­struction along the northeastern edge. 
While limited Ejar activity was documented within temples in the Acropolis (Longyear 1952), the Ejar population apparently eschewed living in abandoned Coner architecture in favor of utilizing the structures as a ready source of construction materials. Despite decades of intensive investiga­tion both within the Main Group and the Copan region, virtually no evidence for Ejar reoccupation of Coner buildings has been reported. Instead, it appears that the Ejar inhabitants chose to construct their residences anew in distinctive architectural forms, including T-shaped platforms such as Struc­tures l lL-77 and llL-137. 
The linear pattern of settlement organized around a broad plaza bears a close resemblance both to local Late Preclassic hilltop centers in the valley such as Los Achiotes and Cerro Chino, as well as to Late Preclassic and Early Postclassic central Honduran sites in and around the Comayagua Valley (Agurcia Fasquelle 1986) including the centers of Tenampua (Dixon 1987, 1989b: Figure 8), Las Vegas (Dixon 1989b: Figure 9; Stone 1957), and Yarumela, among others (Dixon 1989b: Figure 3; Dixon et al. 1994). 
Architectural Style and Construction 
The Ejar structures consisted of large, relatively low (approximately 1-1.5 m above the ancient ground surface) substructures or platforms that originally supported wattle and daub superstructures with per· ishable thatched roofs. The interior rear walls of two superstructures were constructed of stone (Structures llL-141 and l lL-137). While the El Bosque buildings varied in their size and propor­tions, most were rectangular measuring between 6 and 10 m wide and 6 and 20 m long. 
Excavations revealed that the substructures were composed of between 0.5-1 .5 m of loose con­struction fill capped by a layer of clay. The build­ing fill consisted of a matrix of unmodified river

cobbles, cut stones, dressed stone blocks, and occa­sionally even fragments of carved stone sculpture. All substructure far;ades were constructed from reused cut or dressed stones. Ejar builders also incorporated pieces of reset carved stone sculpture into several of these far;ades. The stone walls and earthen floors lacked any evidence of plaster. 
Although activity areas on the platforms' sur­face were poorly preserved, excavations demon­strated that a variety of daily activities were conducted within the Ejar household. During the Coner phase individual structures within a patio group each served distinct functions, including as dormitories, kitchens, workshops, ritual buildings, and places to receive guests. This discrete use of space also extended both to the patio itself and to the terraced exteriors of the structures (Hendon 
1989). In contrast, the Early Postclassic data sug­gest that most activities were conflated and con­ducted under a single roof. Documented activities included food preparation, cooking, lithic tool pro­duction, storage, and ritual events. Perhaps the best preserved floor assemblage came from the interior surface of Structure 11 L-141, where excavations revealed two distinct grinding areas, each consist­ing of a stone platform supporting a metate, one with two associated manos (Figure 7). In addition to these food preparation areas, the surface also con­tained a concentration of charred cotton seeds, iden­tified as Gossypium sp.

Valley, the closest known correlates may be found among Late Preclassic structures from Los Achiotes, separated in time by more than a mil­lennium, although T-shaped structures appear to be a distinctive Early Postclassic style. Outside of the immediate area, similar architectural styles have been reported from central Honduras at contem­poraneous sites including Los Naranjos (Baudez and Becquelin 1973), El Coyote, in the department of Santa Barbara (Mcfarlane 2001 ), Las Vegas (Stone 1957), and Tenampua (Dixon 1987, 1989). Additionally, a T-shaped structure of almost iden­tical form to that of Structures 11 L-77 and 
11 L-137 was reported from Cihuatan in El Sal­vador (Fowler 1981: Figure 4 ). 
Material Culture 
Two important conclusions about the Ejar occupa­tion may be drawn from the material culture. First, the utilitarian artifact assemblages, in concurrence with other Ejar phase data, demonstrate that the Ejar phase represented a complete disjunction of mate­rial culture from the preceding Coner phase. The lack of any continuity between the two phases also raises the possibility that the Bosque site may have been abandoned for some period of time before the arrival of the Ejar population, since there is no evi­dence to suggest that the Ejar peoples were con­querors of the region. Second, the presence of imported Early Postclassic markers demonstrates that the residents were actively participating in long distance exchange. While the Ejar occupation was on a small scale, the substantial quantities of pres­tige goods recovered demonstrates that although the local economy had suffered a dramatic transfor­mation, prestige goods continued to funnel through the Copan Valley, perhaps as a node connecting the southern Maya lowlands with the Southeastern Mesoamerican Periphery during the Early Post­classic. 
Artifactual analysis has revealed insights into patterns of Ejar phase technologies, procurement, production, and consumption of material goods. In particular, a stark contrast can be seen in the pro­duction technologies of both ceramic and chipped stone industries between imported and locally pro­duced goods. Another salient trend of the assem­blages concerns the relatively high frequencies of imported goods from diverse sources. The ceramic assemblage contains imported types from central Honduras as well as widespread diagnostic trade wares such as Tohil Plumbate, while the obsidian assemblage contains significant amounts of blades from exotic central Mexican sources. This pat­terning, consistent with Terminal Classic/Early Postclassic sites in Mesoamerica, contrasts sharply with the decidedly insular Coner phase material culture. 
Ceramics. The Ejar ceramic complex consists of both fine paste elite wares and a full range of utilitarian forms, defined on the basis of 5,635 newly excavated sherds (Manahan 2003). Diag­nostic imported ceramic types include Fine Orange, Tohil Plumbate, and Las Vegas Polychrome. While the former was found in limited quantities, the lat­ter two types appeared in Ejar contexts in approx­imately equal frequencies. In midden contexts, Tohil Plumbate and Las Vegas Polychrome sherds each constituted between 2 percent and 6.5 percent of the Ejar ceramic assemblage. The three types together formed 6 percent of the overall Ejar assem­blage from all contexts. Diagnostic markers were recovered from all contexts, including construc­tion fill and burials, securing the dating of the Ejar structures. Interestingly, imports included not only the polychrome and fine paste types mentioned above, but also vessels of types less widely dis­tributed, including some that were unslipped, pos­sessed thicker pastes, or were traditionally thought to be utilitarian forms, such as Tamoa Red-on-Buff defined at Cihuatan (Fowler 1982). These vessels show ties to both central Honduras and Highland El Salvador and in all formed 2 percent of the over­all assemblage. 
Significantly, ceramic analysis of the materials has established a small but complete Ejar phase util­itarian component, something that previously was lacking from the original definition of the phase (Viel 1983 ). The new typology of the Ejar complex (Manahan 2003, 2004) includes 11 types within 6 groups. Ceramic forms include hourglass shaped censers with fillet rims and appliqued spikes, ladle censers, globular storage or water jars, perifonn vessels, small hemispherical serving bowls, and crudely finished griddles (Figure 8). Overall the utilitarian vessels have pastes with chunky, poorly sorted temper which sometimes penetrates the sur­face. Aesthetically, production appears to have favor expedience over standardization of forms and attention to finishing techniques among the locally

manufactured materials. The Ejar ceramic assem­blage is one of contrast between fine paste and other imported wares and the locally made, gener­ally cruder utilitarian types. 
Finally, contextual analysis demonstrates that no Coner types continued to be produced alongside the Ejar material. Furthermore, from a chronological perspective, the Ejar complex lacks the modal trends and other characteristics documented to have evolved through the Coner phase (Bill 1997). Instead, the Ejar complex shows innovations in both forms and modes never before documented at Copan. 
Chipped Stone Industry. Perhaps the most salient distinctions between Ejar and Coner phase obsidian assemblages may be seen in obsidian sources and the technologies of obsidian tool pro­duction. During the Coner phase, inhabitants of Copan utilized obsidian almost exclusively from the nearby Ixtepeque source. The frequency of Ixtepeque obsidian from Coner residential con­texts averages over 99 percent, with the remain-

der from the two other major Maya sources, El Chaya! and San Martin Jilotepeque (Aoyama 1999: 136). In contrast, the Ejar phase assemblage comprises a greater diversity of obsidian sources (Table 4) visually identified by Kazuo Aoyama (1999) and Geoffrey Braswell (Manahan and Braswell 2001). While the Ixtepeque obsidian source formed the majority of the Ejar assemblage, many other sources were also present. In addition to El Chayal and San Martin Jilotepeque, Ejar assemblages also contained significant quantities of obsidian from La Esperanza, Honduras, as well as central Mexican sources at Pachuca, Hidalgo; Pico de Orizaba, Veracruz; Ucareo, Michoacan; and possibly Zaragoza, Puebla. The relative fre­quency of Mexican obsidian from Ejar midden contexts reached as high as 13.3 percent of the assemblage, a greater percentage than found even during the Early Classic Ac bi phase, the only other time in Copan's history when obsidian was imported from the Pachuca source. The diversity of obsidian sources represented in the Ejar assem­blage, particularly the suite of exotic Mexican sources, is consistent with assemblages from larger contemporaneous Mesoamerican centers such as Chichen Itza (Braswell 2003) and smaller centers such as the aforementioned site of El Coyote, Hon­duras (Mcfarlane 2005). 
Analysis of obsidian tool technoiogies revealed the most dramatic differences between Coner assemblages, in which 75 percent of obsidian arti­facts are prismatic blades or production debitage (Aoyama 1999), and the more diverse production techniques seen in the Ejar phase. While approxi­mately half of the obsidian artifacts recovered from Ejar midden contexts represent a prismatic blade industry (Table 5), no polyhedral cores or debitage from blade production were recovered from any excavated context. Thus there is no evidence to suggest that local prismatic blade production con­tinued in the Ejar phase. 
The absence oflocal prismatic blade production seems unlikely to be a result of a lack of techno­logical knowledge, since blades were produced at contemporaneous sites in the region. Rather, obsid­ian suitable for blade production may have been unavailable or deemed too costly, especially given the widespread local distribution of used Coner prismatic blades available for scavenging at virtu­ally no cost. Whatever the case may have been, the lack oflocal blade production during the Ejarphase may have significant implications for resolving ongoing debates over the use of obsidian-hydration dating at Copan, since this chronometric method limited analysis to the proximal ends of prismatic blades from the Ixtepeque source and assumed that access to obsidian was constant through time (Freter 1988, 1994; Webster and Freter l 990a). The prismatic obsidian blades subjected to obsidian­hydration dating at Copan by Freter and Webster cannot have included any Ejar phase prismatic blades since the data demonstrate that prismatic blade production had ceased in the Copan Valley by Ejar times.

Special Deposits and Ritual Spaces 
The archaeology of the Ejar phase suggests that the El Bosque inhabitants conducted their ritual activ­ities within the household and among abandoned temples in the Acropolis. In contrast to the Los Achiotes data, no public ritual construction was found from the Ejar phase. Instead, it appears that the Bosque community performed most rituals within the household setting, judging from the quantity of censer fragments recovered. The aban­doned central core of Copan, and particularly the East Court, clearly held great significance to the Bosque population, since this area was utilized as a necropolis and a source of sculptured stones from building fai;ades for use in their households. 
These carved stone elements originally deco­rated several of the most sacred and significant Classic era buildings within the East Court. The Ejar people gathered numerous pieces of carved stone from Coner phase buildings and hauled them some two hundred meters to reset them within their Bosque settlement. In total, 29 pieces of Late Clas­sic stone sculptural elements were recovered from Ejar contexts. The original architectural prove­nience of twenty of these stones was identified based on motif, style, and depth of relief by com­paring them with provenienced pieces housed within the Copan IHAH bodega. The pieces of scavenged sculpture originated primarily from the facades of five specific structures from the Acrop­olis and adjacent area, each of which was closely associated with the sixteenth and final ruler of the Copan dynasty, Yax Pasaj Chan Yoaat (Table 6). 
The Ejar residents incorporated the recycled sculptures in a variety of household contexts (Table 7). The sculptures were most often placed into exte­rior walls, where they would have been visible from outside the house. In other cases, sculpture was used in burial contexts by being incorporated into grave walls, a pattern first reported by Longyear (1952:47), and within the household shrine of Structure 1 1L-77. Other pieces were simply incor­porated within the construction fill of the buildings themselves. Another instance involved reuse of half of a square masonry cache box. Stone cache boxes are extremely rare, and have been associated with offerings for monumental architecture within the Acropolis (Sharer et al. 1992). This particular box had been broken in half, inverted, and placed as the middle riser at the entrance to Structure l lL-77. 
A Culture-History of 
Ethnic Discontinuity at Copan 

All these data suggest that the culture-history of Copan is marked by several major discontinuities. Research at Los Achiotes demonstrates that during the Late Preclassic period (350 BC-AD 50), the populations of the Copan drainage were active com­petitors within the southeastern Maya area, trading with central Honduran and highland Guatemalan centers. By the subsequent Protoclassic period

(A.D. 50-400), the disappearance of many of these sites and the increasing interaction with (highland) Maya centers coincide with a shift away from the Late Preclassic patterns of the region's indigenous populations. 
During the Protoclassic period, a growing bot­tomland settlement in the Copan Valley developed a political center exhibiting highland Maya style architecture (Traxler 2004 ), sculpture (Fash 2004 ), ceramics (Crangle 1994; Viel 1998; Viel and Hall 2000, 2004) and lithic technology (Crangle 1994). All these changes suggest that there had developed, by AD 400, a southern Maya-style center in the Copan valley (Sharer and Traxler 2006). In fact, ret­rospective Late Classic texts indicate that a Maya royal center with its own emblem glyph had already been established at Copan by A.D. 159 (Schele 1988; Stuart 1991, 2004). This first Maya ascen­dancy in the Copan drainage was also possibly marked by prolonged antagonism with the indige­nous populations of the region (Fash and Fash 2000), as the evidence of an abrupt and violent end at Los Achiotes suggests. 
This process of conflict and intensive competi­tion likely ended in theA.D. fifth century when the founding of a new foreign-influenced (Sharer 2003, 2004; Stuart 2003) dynasty, the establishment of a new dynastic center on the Copan Valley (see Bell et al. 2004), and the concentration of resources, labor, and settlement within the Copan drainage all coalesced into the developing Classic period polity of Copan: its Classic Maya expression.

Centuries later, the end of the Copan dynasty signaled a radical departure from its Late Classic hegemony. By the onset of the Early Postclassic period (AD 950-1 100), the polity's civic­ceremonial center (if not the entire valley) was mostly empty. The ephemeral Ejar phase occupa­tion exhibited a break from Late Classic traditions and illustrated a different network of affiliations that recalled the Late Preclassic traditions shared with groups living along the southeastern periphery. 
This small Ejar phase population living amongst the abandoned Late Classic ruins of Copan shared basic precepts of community, household, and over­all spatial organization with coeval groups living to the east. This final phase of pre-Columbian occu­pation of the Copan Valley shared more similari­ties with coeval groups living in central Honduras than with their Copan Valley predecessors. These traits hint at shared cultural and ideological beliefs that united disparate groups across a broad swath of central Honduras, similarities that extended much deeper than superficial trade connections.

(Jones 1996, 1997). Therefore, the cultural affilia­tion(s) of these pre-and post-dynastic groups of the Copan region will remain open to debate. However, to account for the discontinuities of the Copan region's culture-history, we suggest that there occurred several major disruptions to the valley's populations. We also note some unexpected simi­larities between the Late Preclassic and Early Post­classic populations of the Copan region which are also shared with contemporaneous groups living beyond the eastern reaches of Maya civilization. We suggest that the deep history of certain basic organizational tenets of these two populations are consistent with groups ancestral to present-day Lenca speakers inhabiting Honduras and El Sal­vador, and not with Mayan groups to the west. 
Processes of Classic Maya 
Political Centralization 

We have presented independent data from pre-and post-dynastic contexts that illustrate how com­prehensively culture change occurred in the Copan region. We suggest that the importance of these changes cast doubt on models for the development and decline of Copan's Classic period polity that are based solely upon processual principles. Espe­cially for the Copan region, models must consider the role of radically transformative events (Viel 1983; Viel and Hall 1998) along with long-term sys­temic processes of social change (Sanders 1989; Webster 1989). 
The data we have presented do not speak to the nature of the Classic Maya political system directly. Nonetheless, they do suggest that the Classic period dynasty of Copan, however organized, represents a short-lived and discrete episode in the region's history. Moreover, complex culture-history eluci­dated by these data suggests that the centralization of political authority during the Classic period was a phenomenon imposed upon, rather than evolved from, the region's existing populations. It is clear, therefore, that the development of Copan' s Classic period state was more than the result of gradualist behavioral adaptation to ecological and socio­economic processes. 
As for the Copan state's final dissolution, our data argue for a political collapse that was quickly followed by population abandonment. The effects of the state's demise were so widespread that little over a century later, different populations were reoccupying areas abandoned in the Classic period. Our data do not support a model of a weak state that had little impact on its supporting population upon its dissolution. Rather, its quick collapse and abandonment are consistent with a highly central­ized state supported by dependent populations. Although our data are indirect, they are not con­sistent with a "weak state" model for Classic period Copan. We hope that this article opens a produc­tive discourse that will ultimately lead to a more dynamic and nuanced model for the tumultuous rise and decline of Copan's political authority during the Classic period.

Notes 
1. Los Achiotes was originally classified as a Terminal Classic and Early Postclassic site by Freter (1 988). Canuto's 
extensive excavation program (2002) demonstrated that the site's main occupation dated to the Late Preclassic period. Freter's limited test excavations (1988) had recovered only a later component of the site which Canuto also recovered. The ceramics associated with this later component were similar in 
style, form, and composition to the Ejar phase ceramics recovered by Manahan (2003) in the Copan valley (Canuto 2003). 
2. Region-wide consistency in ceramic forms and styles ' suggests production and distribution patterns were central­ized in the Copan valley during the Classic period. For instance, the Late Classic agrarian community of El Raizal in the Rio Amarillo valley as well as the satellite center of El Paraiso both have utilitarian assemblages that consists mostly of vessels made in the Copan valley (Cassandra Bill, personal communication, 2007; Canuto 2002; Canuto and Bell 2006).
