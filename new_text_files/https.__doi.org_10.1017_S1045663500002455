most samples under 20 individuals) these results should be taken as working hypotheses for future studies. 
In Chapter 6, Richard Callaghan questions the accepted view that two Archaic traditions migrated from continental regions into the Caribbean. According to this view, the first migration traveled from the Central Amer­ica/Yucatan region (Casimiroid series) and the second from northeastern South America (Ortoroid series). How­ever, within the Caribbean islands the latter is present only in Trinidad and Tobago and north of the Guadeloupe Passage; it is not found in the southern Lesser Antilles. Callaghan argues that this non-contiguous distribution results from the misidentification of sites nrnth of Guade­loupe as Ortoroid and suggests that they should be reclas­sified as Casimiroid. If this conclusion is supported by future studies, we will have to revisit many of our inter­pretations concerning the early colonization of the islands and their impact in later migrations. 
Menno Hoogland and colleagues (Chap1ter 7) present the results of an isotopic analysis conducted on human remains from Anse a la Gourde, Guadeloupe. Through the analysis of strontium isotope ratios they identified 14 (28 percent) nonlocal individuals. Interestingly, the authors note that "all of the nonlocal objects are exclu­sively found with nonlocal females or individuals of undetermined sex" (p. 159), which they interpret as evi­dence of direct transmission. They conclude that these data suggest "virilocal residence among members of the local elite while maintaining the principle of matrilineal descent" (p. 161). 
In Chapter 8,Scott Fitzpatrick and colleagues test the "southward route hypothesis"; e.g., that the early Ceramic Age groups migrated from South America directly to the northeastern Caribbean (Puerto Rico and northern Lesser Antilles) and from there migrated to islands farther south. The authors report the presence of early ceramic traits unearthed in late deposits on the island of Carriacou; they suggest that this evidence sup­ports the southward route hypothesis and they attribute the early ceramic traits to a case of heirloom curation. 
In Chapter 9, Theodore Schurr discusses the limited genetic data (ancient and modern) available for the Caribbean within the context of the evidence for the rest of the Americas. Although he finds some patterns in the data that need to be explained, he cautions us about the limitations in the evidence and notes that more studies are needed. 
The final chapter by Scott Fitzpatrick synthesizes the volume and presents a very optimistic view of the direc­tion of migration studies in the Caribbean that can be obtained by combining multiple lines of evidence. 
I would like to close this review with some brief com­ments. According to the editors' introduction: "We (Caribbeanists) have now reached a stage where contri­butions from numerous scholars within anthropology, not just archaeologists, can incrementally expand our abil­ity to trace the movement of human populations into and within the Caribbean islands" (p. 9). I cannot agree more. However, in order for this to work, we (the numerous scholars) have to learn the "language" of all the disci­plines involved. In reading the various chapters in this volume, I am left with the feeling that most of them did not have a basic understanding of each other disciplines. As a matter of fact, some of the papers actually ignored the warnings or conclusions of other chapters. For a mul­tidisciplinary approach to be successful all the disci­plines involved have to have a good understanding of the basic terminology, concepts, epistemology, and methodology of the other disciplines. 
One example of this problem is the uncritical assump­tion that units of analysis used by archaeologists, such as cultures or series (e.g., Tafno, Arawak, Saladoid), are analogous to biological populations in genetic studies. Moreover, in order to make strides in the study of colo­nization and settlement we have to go beyond simply determining the source of migrations and their routes and, as Keegan (Chapter 1) argues, we have to cease treating colonizers as objects and pay more attention to social processes and social groups. This volume provides a good beginning by bringing scholars from different dis­ciplines together to talk about colonization and settle­ment. Now we have to make sure we are all speaking the same language.
