WATER, MAIZE, SALT, AND CANOES: AN ICONOGRAPHY OF
ECONOMICS AT LATE PRECLASSIC IZAPA, CHIAPAS, MEXICO 

Julia Guernsey 
Images on Late Preclassic (300 B.C.–A.D. 250) monuments from I apa, Chiapas, Mexico, featuring canoe scenes, mai edeities, and water gods, have long been interpreted as representing mythic passages. While significant, such interpretationsneglect other aspects of the scenes, including environmental and socioeconomic concerns that revolve around rain, subsis­tence, and water transport. By contextuali ing these images and linking them to recent archaeological investigations thatilluminate aspects of the Late Preclassic economy of I apa, I argue that the scenes strategically situated economic activi­ties—mai e agriculture, the trade and transport of goods in canoes, even salt production—within a mythic framework. Theimages constitute an artistic program that entwined mythic tales, industries of salt production, and traditions of water nav­igation and that phrased them as part of a system of social order during a period of incipient state formation.

well as on Stelae 3, 6, and 26 (see Norman1973:Plates 6, 12, and 44). This canoe imagerywas conceptualized in tandem with imagery ref­erencing water and rain, such as Stela 5 (Norman1973:Plates9and10,1976:165–236),whosebasalpanel undulates with water scrolls, and Stela 1(Figure 2a), which features an antecedent of therain­and­lightning god known as Chahk in theMaya region (Taube 1995). The imagery reflectsthe watery environment in which Izapa was lo­cated, adjacent to the Río Izapa, a tributary of theRío Suchiate, and 44 km from the Pacific Ocean(Figure 3).The piedmont setting of Izapa recedesinto the coastal plains. These complementaryzones comprise the Soconusco region, renownedforitscacaoproductionduringthePostclassicpe­riod (Voorhies 1989). The nearby coastal lagoonenvironment,anintersectionofocean,rivers,man­groveswamps,andcanals,providedanimportantsubsidiary zone for foodstuffs and transportation(Coe 1961:4; Coe and Flannery 1967:127; Loweet al. 1982:57; Orellana 1995:16).

The Iconography of Water at Izapa 
Before returning to the canoe scenes, it is impor­tant to contextualize the theme of water at Izapa,particularly as associated with the rain deity por­trayed on Stela 1 (Figure 2a), located at the baseofMound 58inGroupA.Actualwater, mirroringthecarvedaquaticband,flowedfromaplazadrainnear Stela 1 to a reservoir at the base of Mound 60 as part of a more elaborate hydraulic system(Gómez 1995; Lowe et al. 1982:171).The role ofthedeityasrain­bringerwasmaterializedinsculp­tural form, yet the consequences of his power— the run­off of torrential rains—were channeled by drains constructed under the authority of aruler. Izapa rulers appear to have recognized thatthe high annual precipitation of this region wascritical to agricultural fertility but also needed tobe managed in the urban environment. This leit­motif—a contest of sorts between rain gods andthe rulers in the urban environment—alludes to the complex relationship between rain, sustain­ability, and water control at Izapa.
Stela 3 (Figure 2b), also at the base of Mound58, features another rain god, one of several LatePreclassic pluvial deities whose traits overlap(Guernsey 2006:124, 2010a; Henderson 2013;Norman 1976:97; Saturno et al. 2005:650). Therain god on Stela 3 is wielding an axe much likeChahk during the Classic period.The serpent ris­inginfrontofhisrightlegcloselyresemblesMis­cellaneous Monument 3 (Figure 2c), one of twozoomorphic/serpent drain troughs at Izapa (Nor­man 1976:259). I have argued elsewhere that theserpentonStela3symbolizedananimatedversionof the Miscellaneous Monument 3 drain (Guernsey 2010a:212–214).
The distinct ways in which water is renderedare significant: on Stela 1, it teems with marinelife, yet on Stela 3, it is alluded to only throughthe portrayal of the animated drain trough, whichwould have channeled the water attributed to the aggressivebehaviorof theaxe­wieldingrain god.

While Stelae 1 and 3 invoke the rain­conjuringabilitiesofpluvialgods,Stela3clarifiesthattheiractions needed to be tamed within the urban en­vironment via the hydraulic system that drainedthe plazas. 


Canoes, the Maize God,and the Taming of Nature 
Other images speak to the agricultural and eco­nomicpotential ofthewatery worldofIzapa, asifthe tension between the necessity of water and itsoverabundance were key to sculptural program­ming. Taube (1996:62) argued that Izapa Stelae22and67(Figure1a,b),foreshadowinglaterClas­sic­period scenes, depict a Late Preclassic maizegod transported in a canoe as part of a larger andwell­known mythic saga of the god’s life, death,andrebirth(seeQuenonandLeFort1997:Figures4, 18, 21, 24). Nonetheless, Braakhuis (2014) re­cently contended that the episodes of the maizegod story most frequently retold by scholars failto account for the full range of events involvingthisdeity.Theseneglectedepisodes,Iargue,betteraccommodate key aspects of the Izapa imagery.
Braakhuis(1990,2014)focusedonGulfCoastmyths in which a maize god is challenged bythunder and lightning deities whose actions heneeds to harness so that agriculture—and social orderorcivilizationmoregenerally—canproceed.In these stories, the maize god tames the deities,reducingthemtoforcesofbeneficialrain,byplay­inghismusic.AsBraakhuisrecognized,thisstoryappears in the Late Preclassic San Bartolo mural,where the maize god holds a drum and rattle,flanked by aquatic deities (Figure 4) (see Saturnoet al. 2005:650 for discussion). On Izapa Stela67, the individual in the canoe also clasps objectsthat may represent rattles. According to the GulfCoast tales, the music made by the maize god isinitially a terrible irritant to the rain deities, wholash out for fear of being lulled into subserviencetothemaizegod.Thisresultdoes,however,ensue,and the deities not only are tamed by the maizegod but become subservient to the humans whopractice agriculture (Braakhuis 2009, 2014).
Asimilar narrative appears to be expressed onIzapa Stelae 22 and 67. In both scenes, the maizedeityridesinastrangely “lidded”canoe,discussedbelow. Zoomorphic creatures that resemble theaquatic deities at San Bartolo and the protagoniston Izapa Stela 3 brandish serpentine ropes thatrun beneath the canoes. The scene on Stela 67 is relatively tranquil, that on Stela 22 more chaotic.If we follow the contours of the story outlined byBraakhuis, the Izapa scenes are about the maizegodononelevelbut,onaperhapsmoreprofoundone, about civilization and social order, in which

agriculture triumphs over natural forces. Stelae22 and 67 thus provide logical counterparts toother monuments at Izapa that reference the con­trol of water. 
In short, while I do not doubt that the Izapaimagery was linked to the well­known maize godstoriesfurtherelaboratedduringtheClassicperiod,I contend that an even closer fit can be found in the less­familiar narratives involving the maizedeity discussed by Braakhuis (1990, 2014).Whatwe see at Izapa are the loose contours of an en­during myth that was widely shared for millenniaand that was manipulated to serve any number ofsite­orregion­specificagendas.Infact,Braakhuis(1990:136) noted that fragments of maize godtales, which closely parallel those from the GulfCoast, appear in Classic­period imagery(Braakhuis 2014:Figure 3), as well as in Mayaethnographies, for example, in a Tzotzil story inwhich a maize goddess slays an aquatic serpent(Guiteras 1961:216–218). 


From Myth and Maize to Salt 
The narrative of the transportation of the maizedeityin a canoe may also have been visualizedatIzapaforreasonsgroundedinaneconomicreality.For example, there is ethnohistorical documen­tation thatagriculturalgoodssuchasmaizewere,attimes,transportedincanoes, whichwouldhelpexplain the link between canoes and maize gods.Edwards(1978:204)citedGonzalodeSandoval’s account of the interception of a canoe carrying acargo of salt and maize. Such sixteenth­centurydocumentation of the transportation of maize ina canoe is not surprising; presumably the pre­conquesticonographyof the transportationof themaize god in a canoe bore some relationship toeconomicreality.Thementionofsaltinthecanoeis, perhaps, even more intriguing and, as dis­cussedbelow, relatedto maizebotheconomicallyand mythically.
Salt is, as Kepecs (2003a:126) described, the“perfect commodity,” because its production anddistribution are easily controlled due to the factthatsourcesarelocalizedbutdemandwidespread.Saltisvitaltohealth,cooking,andthepreservationof perishable goods, and it serves medicinal andotherpurposes(alsoseeAndrews1983;Castellón2007; Ewald 1985; McKillop 2002; Williams2010). There is ethnohistorical documentation ofcanoe trade between salt­producing locales alongthe coasts of Yucatán and Tabasco (Berdan1978:196;Chapman1957;Edwards1978;Scholesand Roys 1968:30–31). McKillop’s (2007) dis­covery of an ancient wooden canoe paddle at asaltwork in Belize pushes the link between canoenavigation and the salt trade back to at least theLateClassicperiod.Butlong­distancecanoetradein salt was not limited to the Caribbean or Gulf coasts.Feldman(1978:144)describedasixteenth­century account of a market in Aguacatlan, Na­yarit, in which the arrival of salt from the Pacificcoastwasrecorded,whileFowler(1989:179–183)

addressed the salt trade in the Pipil region of ElSalvador. Gasco and Berdan (2003:114) notedthat Zacatula, Michoacan, “was in an area rich in high­quality salt and cacao orchards.” Neverthe­less,Edwards(1978)lamentedthatdataforPacificmaritime trade are less plentiful and pertaintore­gions far to the east or west of Chiapas.
Inspiteofalackofethnohistoricalinformation,archaeological data indicate that salt did, indeed,factor into the economy of Late Preclassic Izapaand the south coast. Coe and Flannery (1967:91–92)addressedPreclassicsaltproductionincoastalGuatemala, as did Shook, who documented largequantities of ceramics related to the productionof salcocida atAcapán,nearChamperico(Alcinaand García 1985; Shook 1971). The sal cocida process—as opposed to the sal solar process of solarevaporation—entails “filteringestuarywaterthroughlargecanoesfullofsaltymarshsoil,whichyields a salty brine. The brine is then cooked inlarge [ceramic] vessels, producing the final prod­uct, sal cocida” (Andrews 1983:16).
Most recently, Neff’s (2014) investigationshave amassed more refined data to demonstrate that the mangroveswampsdownriver from Izapawere focused on the extraction of salt. The data indicate that the coastal zone to the northeast of the Río Cahuacan became increasingly focusedon salt extraction during the Late Preclassic pe­riodbasedonpyro­technicevidenceandanabun­dance of potsherds from utilitarian wares used toboil brine (Neff 2014). Late Preclassic salt­pro­ducingcommunitiesundoubtedlybenefitted fromknowledge gleaned from centuries of salt pro­duction along the coast (Coe and Flannery 1967;Lesure and Wake 2011; Love 2002:19; Nance1989,1992;Pye1995;Pyeetal.2011).Moreover,similarities between ceramic assemblages foundby Neff and those at Izapa suggest that coastalpopulations participatedin asystem of economicinteractionwith inlandcommunities.Nefffurther noted thatthe absence ofindicationsoffood pro­cessingsuggeststhatcoastalgroupswerefocusedon supplying their products to the interior popu­lations (Neff 2014:6).
Thissituation,inwhichcoastalgroupsengagedin salt production were linked to inland capitals,compares to that of Chichén Itzá, the port of IslaCerritos,andtheEmalsaltworks,orotheroutpostssuch as Xcopté and Xcambó during the Terminal Classic period (Andrews 1983:33;Andrews et al.1988; Graham and Pendergast 1989; Kepecs2003a, 2007:137, 2015). It also calls to mind ev­idence from Late Classic Belize (McKillop 1995,2002, 2005, 2007, 2010), as well as modern par­allels in Guerrero (Good 1995:9).The location ofIzapa not far from the coast was crucial, becausethe weight and bulk of salt resulted in its trans­portation by water whenever possible (Andrews1983:118). Although it is tempting to postulatethat major inland centers along the south coastwere economically connected to a specific saltproduction locale—like the mouth of the RíoCahuacan for Izapa (Neff 2014), Salinas Tilapafor El Ujuxte (Nance 1992), and Salinas AcapánandSalinasdeIxtán,nearChamperico,forTakalikAbaj(AlcinaandGarcía1985;Andrews1983:71;Coe 1961:148–19; Kidder 1940; Shook 1971)—it would be premature to do so. Such correlationsdo not fully account for the plethora of saltworksalong the south coast or the fluctuations in pro­duction that surely existed due to natural and so­ciopolitical factors. 


An Iconography of Salt? 
To return to Stelae 22 and 67, it would be prudentto concede that—at first glance—they have littleto do with salt or regional economics. Althoughthey do feature a canoe, it is a maize deity withinit. The iconography of maize gods is rich and en­duringinMesoamerica;theiconographyfordeitiesof other subsistence­related commodities pales incomparison.McAnany(2010:127)recognizedthispredicament, observing that there is no “iconog­raphyofsalt” inthecorpusofMayaart,inspiteofthe obvious importance of salt.As she phrased it,“[w]e can presume that elites had an appetite forsalt, but neither the method of its manufacture(evaporation or cooking) nor its essential qualityasaresidueapparentlywereconducivetotheper­formanceorportrayaloftimelessdynasticpower.”
The closest we come in southeastern Mesoamerica to an iconography of salt is in themurals on Chiik Nahb Structure Sub1­4 at Calak­mul(Figure5a),whereamanholdsaspoonabovea large basket while extending his other hand to­wardawomanacrossfromhim.Thetextbetween themspellsatz’aam,“saltperson,”theonlyattestedappearanceofthisfoodstuffinMayawriting(Mar­

tin 2012:68–69). Martin argued that these murals,which dramatize the social exchange of goods,may represent a marketplace. Other data supporta strong relationship between salt and market ex­change. Bartolomé de Las Casas (1909:621, citedinFeldman 1971:77)recordedhisobservations ofamarket,commentingthat“especiallysaltinmanyplaces is exchanged very high” (also see Blom1934 [1932]:435; Feldman 1985). Although theiconography of salt in southeastern Mesoamericais slim,theCalakmulevidence links salt to poten­tialmarketexchangeor,attheveryleast,avibrantClassic­period economic sphere.
Notwithstanding this limited iconographic ev­idence, I believe that a subtle iconography of saltat Izapa was woven into the maize god and canoeimagery. But it is only recognizable as such ifcontextualized alongside several environmentaland social factors, including seasonally restrictedsubsistence activities, changing dietary require­ments,andmethodsusedinthesalcocida process.
Salt production occurs during the dry periodthat corresponds to roughly January to June insoutheastern Mesoamerica; the wetness of therainy season is a practical deterrent. Salt produc­tion is typically balanced with agricultural worksuch as the sowing and harvesting of maize, cre­ating a symbiotic rhythm of life grounded in theacquisitionofknowledgethroughcollectiveprac­tice—by both men and women—that is transmit­ted generationally (Andrews 1983:82, 112–113;Brumfiel 1998:150; Castellón 2007:78–79; Feld­man 1985:105; Good 1995:2, 5; Kepecs2003b:265; McKillop 1995, 2002:23; Quiroz1995:197; Reina and Monaghan 1981).Andrews(1983:112)explainedthatthisschedulingwaspar­ticularlysignificantforcommunitieswithinwalk­ing distance of the coast, who would travel therefor a few weeks during the dry season, when notengaged with agriculture, and gather a supply ofsalt sufficient for a year.
Following Andrews, I suggest that the alter­nating rhythms of maize agriculture and salt pro­duction were closely linked in the minds of theancientinhabitantsofSoconusco.Thissuggestionis made more compelling by data that indicatethat demand for salt rose considerably during thePreclassic as a result of an increased reliance on maize (Andrews and Mock 2002:323; Lesure2009:247;Nance1992;Pye1995:312–313;Sant­ley 2004; Williams 2002). Previously, a diet richin fish and animals prepared or preserved withsalt helped to meet dietary requirements for thismineral. It is quite possible that there was a re­duction in animal protein by the Late Preclassicin the Soconusco, which created a need to obtainalternative sources of salt intake (Chisholm andBlake 2006:166–167). Thus, a conceptual rela­

tionship between maize and salt may have beenentirely logical and predicated upon a variety ofsocioeconomic factors, including seasonal rhythms and changing dietary needs.
This evidence warrants consideration of the possibility that the maize god at Izapa was notonly a symbol of maize, per se, but a more en­compassingsymbolofbountythatembodiedotherproducts related to subsistence more generally.Martin(2009:163;alsoseeBraakhuis1990:Foot­note 3; McAnany 2010:166; Miller and Martin2004:63;TokovinineandBeliaev2013:187),not­ing that the Classic­period maize god can appearin the guise of a cacao tree, concluded that thedeity was at “the center of wider concepts of fe­cundity and abundance.” There is also consistent overlapduringtheClassicperiodandethnograph­ically between the maize god, watery realms, andthe bounty of the ocean (Braakhuis 1990; Girard1966;Quiroz1995:187;Stross1994;Taube1996).
AparticularlycompellinganalogybetweenthemaizegodimageryatIzapaandAztecmythexists;it closely parallels the Gulf Coast stories of anepic battle between the maize god and the raindeities, which I believe offer a more convincingexplanation for the imagery on Izapa Stelae 22and67.IntheAztecversionofthemyth,thebattleensues between a salt goddess and rain deities.According to Sahagún (1950–1982:2:91; seeKepecs 2003a:126; Mendizábal 1928:205–206;Osorio 1998), celebrations dedicated to the god­dessofsalt,Huixtocihuatl(Figure5b),weremadeby those engaged with salt extraction during themonth of Tecuilhuitontli. Following a disagree­ment with her brothers, who were rain gods, shewasexpelledtosaltbeds,whereshetheninventedsalt. As in the other narratives in which maize— and sustenance more generally—emerged tri­umphant over pluvial deities, so too the goddessof salt outwits her opponents in this story. More­over, as Mendizábal (1928:206) recognized, themonth of Tecuilhuitontli corresponded to earlyJune,whenhigh tides filledthe lagoons,enablingthe production of salt in the Tehuantepec salt de­posits. During the ceremonies in honor of Huix­tocihuatl, a female impersonator of the deity (ix­iptla) was adorned with ears of maize andaccompanied by captives and women involved insalt production. Carrasco (2002:208–210) noted,quoting Sahagún (1950–1982:2:91–95), that, as theHuixtocihuatl ixiptla danced,shethrustastaffinto the ground as though opening the earth forplanting.Justbeforethe ixiptla andcaptiveswerekilled, participants in the ceremony were “giventhe names of huixtotin, or salt people.” The con­flation between a deity of salt and maize is clear,and calls to mind Kepecs’s (2003a:126) assertionthat, for theAztecs, “maize and salt went hand in hand.” Moran (2007:123) also noted that the lan­guage in Sahagún (1950–1982:2:94) describingthe sacrifice of Huixtocihuatl, in which her blood“rose” and “boiled up,” is that of cooking, indi­cating the association between the salt deity, sus­tenance, and food preparation. Parallels exist inthe Maya region: McKillop (1995:222–223,2002:93)linkedthepresenceofamano and metate at saltworks in Belize to Reina and Monaghan’s(1981:32) description of the addition of corn tosalt brine at Sacapulas, Guatemala, in order tomake the salt more fine­grained.
McKillop (2002:95, 2007) also documentedevidence for rituals, in the form of pottery ocari­nas,whistles,incenseburners,andservingvessels,atLateClassicsaltworksinBelizefocusedonthe provisioningofinlandcities.Modernethnographicaccounts likewiseemphasize the useof salt in rit­ual (Osorio 1998; Reina and Monaghan 1981;Vogt1969;Williams1998).Good(1995:12)notedthat sea salt is still used in “dry season rituals as­sociatedwithagricultureandcommerce” andrec­ognized that this may be due to instability andannual fluctuations in production. Gossen (1974:287–288) recorded a story from Chamulain which salt served as a form of protection fortravelers. A certain amount of pragmatism sur­rounds such ritualized uses. Modern Maya inQuintanaRoocarrysaltwhiletendingmaizefieldstocombatthedepletionofsodiumduetoexcessivesweatingintherelentlessheat(EugeneAnderson,personalcommunication2015).AccordingtoAn­derson, agriculturalists add salt to a simple pozol,creating a “corn­salt union” both symbolic andpractical.

exchange of salt during the Postclassic seems tohave always involved merchants due to its bulkyweight, limited production locations, and wide­spread demand.
Such evidence testifies to the significance ofsalt through time as a good that was both eco­nomically and ritually charged. Many stories areremarkably consistent, and I would suggest that alarger symbolic complex—incorporating rituals,myths, commerce, long­distance travel, salt, andmaize/sustenance more generally—conceptuallyunites them. I argue that this narrative complex isanticipated by the imagery at Izapa, to which Inow return. 


Salt, Stacked Canoes, Quatrefoils,and the Maize God 
There may be additional overlap between theiconographyatIzapaandprocessesofsaltextrac­tion.McBryde(1947:58–60,Plate1)documentedsalt­making traditions in the coastal town ofTahuesco,Guatemala,inthe1930sand1940sthatutilized a process virtually identical to one de­scribedbyJuandeEstrada(1955)inthesixteenthcentury, which suggests continuity in the methodofsaltproductionsincePrecolumbiantimes(Fig­ure 6): 
Oneachsalina therearetwooldcanoesofthe type used in lagoon navigation. These areplaced horizontally upon racks built of poles,onedirectlyabovetheother.Thelower,calledthe recibidora, is usually about 3 or 4 feetabove the ground. The upper, the coladera (colander), is a little more than a foot higher;itsbottomisperforatedandcoveredwithpalmmats.Athicklayerofsandisputinitasafilter,withplaya saltcrustspreadoverthat.Wateriscarried to it, up a small ladder or ramp in abrace of buckets attached to a pole placedacross the shoulders... 
When the lower canoe has been filled with water that is high in dissolved salt, leachedfromthecoladera,thesalinesolutionistrans­ferred by buckets to an adjacent iron vat. 
This process involved two canoes, one placedabove the other (also see Andrews 1983:68;Fowler 1989:179; Fuentes y Guzmán 1932–1933 [1690]:102–103; García de Palacio 1927 [1576]:72).AlthoughitisimpossibletoprovethatasimilartechniquewasemployedduringtheLatePreclassic, given the time depth and nature of theevidence, the imagery on Stelae 22 and 67 istemptingtocontemplateinlightofthis.Asecond,inverted canoe­shaped object, mirrors the lower,properlyorientedcanoeonbothStelae22and67.In each image, it looks as if a canoe­shaped “lid” has been pried off of the lower canoe in order toreveal or accommodate the emergence of themaize god inside.There is nothing comparable inlater Classic Maya imagery; those canoes are never “lidded” like the Izapa ones. I have arguedelsewhere (Guernsey 2010b:83) that theartistde­liberately rendered the canoe at Izapa in a recti­linearformand capped itwithitsmirrorimagesothat the two canoes—one right side up, the otherupside down—together formed a quatrefoil. Al­readybythePreclassicperiod,thequatrefoilmotifsymbolized a supernatural portal, and it could berendered with equally rectilinear contours as onChalcatzingo Monuments 9 and 13 (Figure 7)(Grove andAngulo 1987). I suggest here that thestacked canoes at Izapa allude to a salt­makingprocesslikethatdocumentedethnographically,inwhich two canoes—not inverted, but with prowspointing in opposite directions—were used toprocessthesalt­encrustedsilt.IfIamcorrect,thenthe imagery at Izapa was deliberately polyvalent,intended to encompass a variety of meaningsrather than a single story.
By the Late Preclassic period, the quatrefoilshape was employed, like a framing device, tofeature the story of the maize god, as on the westwallatSanBartolo(Figure4).Acloserelationshipbetween quatrefoils and the maize god narrativealso persisted into later periods (Fash 2005;Guernsey 2010b:Figure 13d). The parted or“cracked open” quatrefoil that frames the maizedeityatIzapaanticipatestheseClassic­periodim­ages,whilealsoportrayingcanoeswhoseangularforms foreshadow other rectilinear canoes in the iconography (Figure 8) (see Andrews 1998;Romero 1998; Shatto 1998).But the doubled ca­noes at Izapa, beyond forming a quatrefoil also,perhaps, alluded to processes of salt production.

of agriculture, would have been equally relevantto salt production, which also entailed a conquer­ingofthenaturalenvironment,fromitsextractiontoitstransportationviacanoe.AlthoughtheIzapaimagery by no means offers a one­to­one corre­spondence with the process documented by JuandeEstradaandMcBryde,Ineverthelessthinkthattheinversionoftheuppercanoewasdonesothat,together, the two canoes formed a quatrefoil orsymbolic portal that marked supernaturallycharged events and, in particular, the victory ofthe maize god. The imagery encoded both eco­nomic and mythic meanings, framing the processof salt production and its use of stacked canoeswithin a pan­Mesoamerican mythology of maizegods and quatrefoils.Apottery stamp from a Be­lize saltworks, bearing partial and complete qua­trefoils,mayconnotesimilarmeanings(McKillop2002:Figure 3.38).
There is linguistic evidence to support theseassertions. Stone (1995:35) noted a correlationbetween canoes, containers, caves, altars, holes,andobjectsthat serve asreceptacles for people orfoodstuffsinYucatecMaya.Likewise,Finnamore(2010:154) observed that “the word for boat,chem, is related to the word for a trough used inpreparingthedoughmasa, chemche’.Thecolonial Tzotzil word jom was used for something hol­lowedoutinformandprobablyconveysthesame notion of ‘dugout.’” Similar associations exist inMixe­Zoquean languages, in which *?aha “ca­noe” canalsosignifya “comederoparaanimales”(Wichmann 1995:244). On Stelae 22 and 67, thisconceptual interplay is visualized through the ca­noe that is a quatrefoil, a vessel that transportsthemaize god, and,I argue, acontainerforleach­ing salt. The inversion of the canoe, to form acomplete quatrefoil, is not anomalous.There wasa tendency during the Classic period for scribestomanipulate,turn,andinvertthepartialquatrefoilshapewithnoapparentchangeinmeaning(Hous­ton et al. 2006:145–146). Accordingly, I wouldsuggest that the imagery of Stelae 22 and 67 in­vokesthesepunsandcleverlycloaksafundamen­tally economic activity in the language of myth.
My proposal that the scenes on Stelae 22 and67 allude to the process of salt production alignswithaconclusionreachedbyNance(1989)basedonhisexcavationsatGuzmánMound,aLatePre­classic saltworks located 2 km north of Tilapa onthe south coast of Guatemala with radiocarbon assaysbetweenca.200B.C.andA.D.150.Basedontheabsenceoffoodpreparationandanimalre­mains, in addition to evidence of sal cocida pro­ductionandanaccumulationofsoilonthemound duetotheleached­outtailingsofthesaltfiltrationprocess, Nance proposed that a process utilizingstacked canoes was employed.

So, too,MacKinnon and Kepecs (1989:529–530) dis­cussed comparable Late Classic evidence of salt­making refuse and leached earth in Belize, at­tributingittoa salcocida processutilizingstackedcanoes. The scenes on Izapa Stelae 22 and 67,with their oddly stacked canoes, offer additionalsupport for the potential antiquity of this methodof salt processing along the south coast. I offerthis suggestion tentatively bearing in mind thecautionary warning voiced by Dillon et al.(1988:44)thatAndrews’s(1983)research “pointsout the remarkable diversity in current methodsof salt manufacture … and serves as a caution againstoverly­simplisticreconstructionsofancientsaltmaking industries based upon limited ethno­graphic information.”
Given the range of evidence, which draws ontheLatePreclassicarchaeologicalrecordandcon­temporaneous monuments as much as later eth­nohistorical and ethnographic accounts, I would advocate,contraMcAnany(2010:127),thatthereis an iconography of salt. We have just failed torecognize it previously, as it is far from obvious.But close scrutiny of the Late Preclassic iconog­raphy, as ancillary evidence to a robust body ofarchaeological and ethnohistorical data, revealsthat a case can be made for a Late Preclassic deity that carried associations with both salt andmaize. 
Nevertheless,itisimportanttoresistthetemp­tation to treat the monuments as documents, in avery literal­minded sort of way. While I arguethat Izapa Stelae 22 and 67 reference economiesof salt production—and, to my mind, Neff’s ar­chaeological evidence strongly supports this in­terpretation—it is also possible that the rulers atIzapa chose to exaggerate, through imagery suchas this, their control over this coastal economy.RecentreconnaissancebyRosenswigetal.(2012)has documented other sites of significant scalelocated between Izapa and the coast. At present,it is impossible to know whether these representsecondary sites within the Izapa polity, or rivals

who would have posed a challenge to coastal ac­cess. The imagery does not answer these ques­tions: while it invokes the coastal prowess ofIzapa, it is unclear whether it is an accurate por­trayal or an exaggerated, idealized vision of therelationshipofIzapatothecoastanditsresources. 
WhileNeff’s datalendcredencetothesuggestionthat Izapa’s relationship to the coast was indeedpredicated on economic symbiosis, future exca­vations stand to contribute significantly to ourunderstandingofthepoliticalandeconomiccom­plexities that surely existed due to the sheer den­sity of sites that dot the south coast from theplains to the piedmont. In truth, there were prob­ably many sites of varying scale engaged in saltextraction, a multiplicity of ways in which thisresourcewasproducedandexchanged,andacon­tinuum of quality that affected demand. The bot­tomline,however,isthatrulersatIzapaemployeda rhetoric of water, salt, maize, and canoes thatarticulatedtheir relationshipto thecoast,whetherexaggerated or not. 


Conclusions 
Therecurrenceofthecanoemotifwithinthissym­bolic scheme is important to underscore. Canoesappear on stelae at Izapa despite the fact that thesiteislocatedsomedistancefromtheocean,albeitconnected to it via the Río Izapa. It was clearlyvital to leaders to reference seafaring abilities asanassertionofcontroloveradomainthatextended beyond the piedmont location of Izapa to includethe coastal estuaries and lagoons. Canoes mightalsohaveconnotedcivilizationandculture.Munn (1977:41, 51, cited in Helms 1993:21; also seeMalinowski 1961) described how, for the Gawaof Papua New Guinea, canoes enabled the islanddwellers to travel and obtain access to outside things. The canoes signified acts of skilled craft­ing, in which trees were transformed intoculturalartifacts. Canoes for Mesoamericans may havecarried similar associations with skilled crafting,travel, and economics. Tokovinine and Beliaev(2013:178–179) noted that, among the ClassicMaya of the Usamacinta River basin, individualscarriedtitlessuchas “heofthecanoe” (aj­jukuub),although they qualified that it was not clearwhether these titles referenced trading activitiesor military offices.
Centuries later, at Chichén Itzá, canoes alsoappear with regularity in the mural program, inspite of the inland location of that site (Andrews1990:161–162; Lombardo de Ruiz 1998; Miller1977; Romero 1998; Thompson 1949, 1970).Scholars (Finnamore 2010; Kepecs 2003b:267–

268, 2015; Lombardo de Ruiz 1998; McKillop1995, 1996, 2010; Miller 1977; Tokovinine andBeliaev 2013:178) have recognized that canoesin Mesoamerican art attest to the importance ofnavigationnotonlyinmythologicalaccounts,butinthehistory of commerce,warfare, politics, andurbanization. Scholes and Roys (1948:149), forexample, noted that in a Chontal text assembledbetween1565and1628,canoesandpaddleswerelisted as tribute items. Beyond their economicvalue, canoes may have lent themselves well tomythological narratives because of their liminalnature, moving asthey do through wateryrealmsthat were otherwise unnavigable and, at times,distant. On a purely pragmatic level, canoes atIzapa were vessels that facilitated the movementof goods. But more than mere emblems of trans­port and trade, they also symbolized the victoryof the maize god over the volatile gods of rain.In this region of torrential storms, moving goodsalong the coast in canoes would have constituteda battle of sorts against the forces of nature orthe will of the rain gods. Coastal travel was leasttreacherousduringthedryseason.Saltproductionalso coincided with the dry season as, undoubt­edly, did the bulk of the transportation of thiscommodity by water. Canoes were thus morethan a fundamental economic tool, but one rifewithmythic implicationsof the victory over rain,of rhythms of agricultural production, and eco­nomicstability.Classic­periodwoodenboatmod­els found at the Punta Ycacos, Belize, saltworksmay evince similar associations (McKillop2002:Figure 3.38).
During the Late Preclassic along the Pacificcoast, economic assertions appear to have beencleverly intertwined with the acts of gods. Thesenarrativesplayedakeyroleinmonumentalsculp­ture programs that were the hallmark of the mostpowerfulsiteswithintheregion(Guernsey2010a,2012; Love 2010). The elaborate sculpture pro­gramatIzapatestifiestotheenergyandresourcesexpended to craft an urban environment in whichmessages of water, its control, and its vital role insubsistence strategies of all kinds—from maizeto salt—reverberated at a moment of incipientstate formation. The impact of these argumentsextends beyond the confines of Mesoamerica,however, and speaks to the need to explore thesociopoliticalandeconomicimplicationsofartistic programs,whichthroughouttheAmericasplayeda significant role in the formulation of the urbanenvironment.
